'''Adaptive [[feedback]] cancellation''' is a common method of cancelling [[audio feedback]] in a variety
of electro-acoustic systems such as digital [[hearing aid]]s. The time varying acoustic feedback leakage paths can only be eliminated with adaptive feedback cancellation. When an electro-acoustic system with an adaptive feedback canceller is presented with a correlated input signal, a recurrent [[distortion]] artifact, [[Entrainment (physics)|entrainment]] is generated. There is a difference between the system identification and feedback cancellation. 

Adaptive feedback cancellation has its application in [[echo cancellation]]. The error between the desired and the actual output is taken and given as feedback to the adaptive processor for adjusting its coefficients to minimize the error.

In hearing aids, feedback arises when a part of the receiver (loudspeaker) signal is captured by the hearing aid microphone(s), gets amplified in the device and starts to loop around through the system. When feedback occurs, it results in a disturbingly loud tonal signal. Feedback is more likely to occur when the hearing aid volume is increased, when the hearing aid fitting is not in its proper position or when the hearing aid is brought close to a reflecting surface (e.g. when using a mobile phone). Adaptive feedback cancellation algorithms are techniques that estimate the transmission path between loudspeaker and microphone(s). This estimate is then used to implement a neutralizing electronic feedback path that suppresses the tonal feedback signal.

'''Aortic valve replacement''' is a procedure in which a patient's failing [[aortic valve]] is replaced with an [[artificial heart valve]]. The aortic valve can be affected by a range of diseases; the valve can either become leaky ([[aortic insufficiency]]) or partially blocked ([[aortic stenosis]]). Current aortic valve replacement approaches include open heart surgery via a sternotomy, minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).

== Medical uses ==
As risk of aortic valve surgery has decreased and long term data on the survival and quality of life of people after valve replacement has become available, evidence-based guidelines for aortic valve replacement have been developed.  The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Valvular Heart Disease are a widely accepted source of information for cardiologists and surgeons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=1838843|title = 2014 AHA/ACC Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aortic stenosis ===
Patients with severe aortic stenosis, where the aortic valve is narrowed and blood flow from the heart is obstructed are candidates for surgery when they develop symptoms or when the heart function is impacted.  Certain asymptomatic patients may also be candidates for surgery, especially if exercise stress testing is positive.

=== Aortic insufficiency ===
Patients with leaky aortic valves (aortic insufficiency) often tolerate even severe degrees of insufficiency for a relatively long time before symptoms develop.  Surgery is indicated for symptoms such as shortness of breath, and in cases where the heart has begun to enlarge (dilate) from pumping the increased volume of blood that leaks back through the valve.

==Types of valves==
{{Main article|Artificial heart valve}}

There are two basic types of artificial heart valve: mechanical valves and tissue valves.

===Tissue valves===
Tissue heart valves are usually made from animal tissue, either animal heart valve tissue or animal pericardial tissue. The tissue is treated to prevent rejection and calcification.

There are alternatives to animal tissue valves. In some cases a [[homograft]] - a human aortic valve—can be implanted.  Homograft valves are donated by patients and recovered after the patient dies. The durability of homograft valves is comparable to porcine and bovine tissue valves.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Another procedure for aortic valve replacement is the [[Ross procedure]] (or pulmonary [[autograft]]). In a Ross procedure, the aortic valve is removed and replaced with the patient's own [[pulmonary valve]]. A pulmonary homograft (pulmonary valve taken from a cadaver) is then used to replace the patient's own pulmonary valve.  This procedure was first used in 1967 and is used primarily in children, as the procedure allows the patient's own pulmonary valve (now in the aortic position) to grow with the child.

===Mechanical valves===
Mechanical valves are designed to outlast the patient, and have typically been stress-tested to last several hundred years.  Although mechanical valves are long-lasting and generally present a one-surgery solution, there is an increased risk of blood clots forming with mechanical valves. As a result, mechanical valve recipients must take anticoagulant (blood thinning) drugs such as [[warfarin]] for the rest of their lives, making the patient more prone to bleeding.  The sound of mechanical valves may be heard and decrease the quality of life.&lt;ref name=valvenoise&gt;{{cite journal|last=Golczyk|first=K|author2=Kompis M |author3=Englberger L |author4=Carrel TP |author5=Stalder M |title=Heart valve sound of various mechanical composite grafts, and the impact on patients' quality of life.|journal=The Journal of heart valve disease|date=March 2010|volume=19|issue=2|pages=228–232|pmid=20369508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Valve selection===
Tissue valves tend to wear out faster with increased flow demands - such as with a more active (typically younger) person. Tissue valves are increasing lasting longer - now typically approximately 20 years, but they might wear out faster in younger people.&lt;ref name="foroutan"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Foroutan F, Guyatt GH, O'Brien K, et al | year = 2016 | title = Prognosis after surgical replacement with a bioprosthetic aortic valve in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis: systematic review of observational studies | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/354/bmj.i5065.long | journal = BMJ | volume = 354 | issue = | pages = i5065 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.i5065 | pmid = 27683072 | pmc=5040922}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When a tissue valve wears out and needs replacement, the person must undergo another valve replacement surgery. For this reason, younger patients often receive mechanical valves to prevent the increased risk (and inconvenience) of another valve replacement. {{Citation needed|reason=medical claim with no citation. Does this apply to children? Probably not|date=November 2015}}

==Surgical procedure==
[[File:Diagram of the human heart (cropped).svg|thumb|right|Diagram of the opened heart, viewed from the front. The aortic valve separates the [[left ventricle]] from the [[aorta]].]]
[[File:Gray495.png|thumb|right|Heart viewed from above, with atria removed to expose the valves.]]
Aortic valve replacement is most frequently done through a [[median sternotomy]], meaning the incision is made by cutting through the [[Human sternum|sternum]]. Once the [[pericardium]] has been opened, the patient is put on a [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] machine, also known as the heart-lung machine. This machine takes over the task of breathing for the patient and pumping their blood around while the surgeon replaces the heart valve.

Once the patient is on bypass, a cut is made in the aorta and a crossclamp applied. The surgeon then removes the patient's diseased aortic valve and a mechanical or tissue valve is put in its place. Once the valve is in place and the aorta has been closed, the patient is taken off the heart-lung machine. [[Transesophageal echocardiogram]] (TEE, an ultra-sound of the heart done through the esophagus) can be used to verify that the new valve is functioning properly. Pacing wires are usually put in place, so that the heart can be manually paced should any complications arise after surgery. Drainage tubes are also inserted to drain fluids from the chest and pericardium following surgery. These are usually removed within 36 hours while the pacing wires are generally left in place until right before the patient is discharged from the hospital.

== Hospital stay and recovery time ==
After aortic valve replacement, the patient will frequently stay in an [[intensive care unit]] for 12–36 hours.  The patient is often able to go home after this, in about four days, unless complications arise. Common complications include [[heart block]], which typically requires the permanent insertion of a [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker|cardiac pacemaker]].

Recovery from aortic valve replacement will take about three months, if the patient is in good health. Patients are advised not to do any heavy lifting for 4–6 months after surgery, to avoid damage to the sternum (the breast bone).

== Outcomes ==
The risk of death or serious complications from aortic valve replacement is typically quoted as being between 1-3%, depending on the health and age of the patient&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.heart-valve-surgery.com/valve-mortality-surgery-repair-replacement.php|author = Pick, Adam|title = Dispelling The Patient Fear Of Heart Valve Surgery|accessdate = 2018-05-23|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Older patients, as well as those who are frail and/or have multiple comorbidities (i.e. other health problems), may face significantly higher surgical risk.

== Minimally invasive surgery ==
More recently, some cardiac surgeons have been performing aortic valve replacement procedures using an approach referred to as minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS), in which the surgeon replaces the valve through small incisions between two and four inches in length using specialized surgical instruments rather than by cutting a six to ten-inch incision down the center of the sternum. MICS typically involves shorter recovery time and more attractive cosmetic results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Torracca, MD |first=Lucia |title=Totally Endoscopic Atrial Septal Defect Closure with a Robotic System: Experience with Seven Cases |url=http://static.cjp.com/gems/pdfs/2001-6731.pdf |work=The Heart Surgery Forum #2001-6731 5 (2):125–127, 2002 |publisher=Forum Multimedia Publishing, LLC |display-authors=etal }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another promising alternative for many high risk and older patients is [[percutaneous aortic valve replacement|transcatheter aortic valve replacement]] (TAVR), which delivers a new valve to the site of the diseased valve through a catheter.&lt;ref name="siemieniuk"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Siemieniuk RA, Agoritsas T, Manja V, et al | year = 2016 | title = Transcatheter versus surgical aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis at low and intermediate risk: systematic review and meta-analysis. | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/354/bmj.i5130.long | journal = BMJ | volume = 354 | issue = | pages = i5130 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.i5130 | pmid = 27683246 | pmc=5040923}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement valve is collapsed and packaged in a way similar to a stent. Once in place it is expanded, pushing the old valve’s leaflets out of the way, and functions in place of the old valve. The catheter may be inserted through the femoral artery or through a small incision in the chest and then through a large artery or the tip of the left ventricle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/HeartValveProblemsandDisease/What-is-TAVR_UCM_450827_Article.jsp| title = What is TAVR?| access-date = 2015-08-15| year = 2014| publisher = American Heart Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guidelines suggest TAVR for most patients over 75 and surgical replacement for most patients less than 75.&lt;ref name="vandvik"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Vandvik PO, Otto CM, Siemieniuk RA, Bagur R, Guyatt GH, Lytvyn L, Whitlock R, Vartdal T, Brieger D, Aertgeerts B, Price S, Foroutan F, Shapiro M, Mertz R, Spencer FA | year = 2016 | title = Transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement for patients with severe, symptomatic, aortic stenosis at low to intermediate surgical risk: a clinical practice guideline | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/354/bmj.i5085.long | journal = BMJ | volume = 354 | issue = | pages = i5085 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.i5085 | pmid = 27680583 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the best treatment choice is a decision based on many individual factors.&lt;ref name="vandvik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lytvyn"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Lytvyn L, Guyatt GH, Manja V, Siemieniuk RA, Zhang Y, Agoritsas T, Vandvik PO | year = 2016 | title = Patient values and preferences on transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement therapy for aortic stenosis: a systematic review | url = http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/9/e014327 | journal = BMJ Open | volume = 6 | issue = 9 | pages = e014327 | doi = 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014327 | pmid = 27687903 | pmc=5051506}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Early surgical approaches to aortic valve disease were limited by the necessity of operating with the heart beating.  In the 1950s the [[Hufnagel]] valve was implanted in the descending thoracic aorta in patients with [[aortic insufficiency]].  The first successful replacement of the aortic valve was reported in 1960 by Harken, and early adoption of this technique proceeded slowly based on the limitations of available replacement valves and relatively primitive techniques for protecting the heart during surgery which were available at the time.  With the evolution of mechanical heart valves and gradual developments in cardiopulmonary bypass (the heart lung machine) and cardioplegia which allow the heart to be stopped safely during surgery, aortic valve replacement became accepted therapy for patients with severe aortic insufficiency or regurgitation.

'''Avid DS''' (which was called '''Avid DS Nitris''' until early 2008) is a high-end offline and finishing system comprising a [[non-linear editing system]] and [[visual effects]] software.  It was developed by [[Softimage (company)|Softimage]] in Montreal.  Softimage was owned by Microsoft at the time of the launch of DS v1.0 and the company was acquired by Avid Technology Inc shortly thereafter.

DS was discontinued on September 30, 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Avid Pulls the Plug on the DS|url=http://www.studiodaily.com/2013/08/avid-pulls-the-plug-on-the-ds/|accessdate=10 June 2015|agency=studiodaily|date=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with support ending on September 30, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Avid DS Support Center |url=http://aviddssupport.avid.com/ |accessdate=10 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610110257/http://aviddssupport.avid.com/ |archivedate=10 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==

DS was called ‘Digital Studio’ in development.  It was envisioned to be a complete platform for video/audio work.  The first previews of the system were on the SGI platform, but this version was never released.  The system was rewritten on Windows NT with different video hardware platforms (Matrox DigiSuite or Play Trinity running on a NetPower system) before the final system was released on Intergraph/StudioZ hardware in January 1998.

After its acquisition by Avid, DS was always positioned as a high end video finishing tool. However, many users found it to be uniquely soup-to-nuts in its capabilities.  From version 1.0 of the product, it competed with products like [[Autodesk Smoke]], [[Quantel]] and [[Avid Symphony]].  The toolset in DS offered video timeline editing, an object-oriented vector-based paint tool, 2D layer compositing, sample based audio and starting with version 3.01 of the product, a 3D environment.  Originally, a subset of the [[Autodesk Softimage|Softimage{{pipe}}XSI]] 3D software was planned to become part of the DS toolset, both were built on the same software foundation, but over time the code bases divided between the applications and the integration never happened.

While the first version of the DS still lacked a few key features (no 3D, poor keying, no real-time effects), it had some significant features compared to the competing products at the time.  It offered a large number of built in effects.  Avid OMF import was available, positioning Softimage DS as a strong finishing tool for then typical off-line Avid systems.  Lastly the integration of the toolset of Softimage DS was beyond what other product offered.  A Softimage DS user could quickly go from editing, to paint, to compositing with a few mouse clicks all inside the same interface.  Some of the lacking features where quickly resolved, within months of version 1.0 a new chroma keyer was released.

Early versions of the software (up thru 4.0) added additional key features.  Development continued with one of the first uncompressed HD editing systems (version 4.01) and an attempt to make the system more friendly to Media Composer editors in version 6. In later versions (v7.5 on beyond)  DS was criticized for slow development of compositing tools, mainly lack of a new 3D environment and better tracking tools.  Many DS users felt that Avid had not been giving DS the attention that it deserved.

On July 7, 2013 Avid sent out an email marking the end of life of the DS product.

''"To Our Avid DS customers, We are writing to inform you that Avid will be realigning our business strategy to focus on a core suite of products to best leverage our developmental and creative resources. As part of this transition, we will be ceasing future development of Avid DS with a final sale date of September 30th, 2013"''

==Hardware==

Up until version 10.5, DS was sold as a turn-key system; the software was not available without purchasing CPU, I/O and storage hardware from Avid. Beginning with 10.5, customers were able to configure their own systems using widely available components, based on recommended system requirements. In turn-key systems, there were many hardware refreshes over time.

'''StudioZ single stream:''' Intergraph TDZ-425 with 30&amp;nbsp;minutes of uncompressed SCSI storage.  CPUs at the time were Pentium II/300&amp;nbsp;MHz.

'''StudioZ dual stream:''' Intergraph TDZ-2000 GT1 with one hour of fibre channel storage.  CPUs on first systems were Pentium II/400&amp;nbsp;MHz, but last shipping systems had Pentium III/1&amp;nbsp;GHz.  DS was one of the first applications to show that real-time effects could be processed with just the CPUs of the system, not requiring special video cards with real-time effect hardware.

'''Equinox:'''  Developed by Avid, it was one of the first uncompressed HD video cards available.  Systems were available on CPUs from Pentium III/1&amp;nbsp;GHz to Pentium 4/2.8&amp;nbsp;GHz.  Storage was typically SCSI, but fibre channel was also supported.

'''Nitris DNA:'''  Developed by Avid, the Nitris hardware was probably the largest hardware update to the system since it was released.  10-bit HD and SD support was standard.  Real-time down and cross convert.  This was the only hardware for DS that had on-board effect processing.  This allowed a system at the time to play back dual-stream uncompressed HD effects in real-time at 16-bit precision.  This was also the first hardware from Avid to support the DNxHD codec.  Starting with Pentium 4, Intel Core Xeons were supported.  SCSI storage was primarily used.

'''AJA Video Systems:'''  First available as a 4:4:4 option to be used in conjunction with Nitris hardware.  Final-generation DS systems used the AJA Video Systems [https://www.aja.com/products/kona-3g Kona 3] (Xena 2K) card as the only I/O for the system.  The last systems shipped with two Intel Core Xeon 6-core processors.  [[Serial attached SCSI|SAS]] is the recommended storage for these systems.

The [[Blaw-Knox]] company was a manufacturer of steel structures and construction equipment based in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].  The company is today best known for its [[mast radiator|radio towers]], most of which were constructed during the 1930s in the [[United States]].  Although Blaw-Knox built many kinds of towers, the term '''Blaw-Knox tower''' (or radiator) usually refers to the company's unusual "diamond cantilever" design, which is stabilized by guy wires attached only at the vertical center of the mast, where its cross-section is widest.&lt;ref name="Radio-Craft"&gt;{{cite journal

The distinctive diamond-shaped towers became an icon of early radio. Several are listed on the US [[National Register of Historic Places]],&lt;ref name=tennesseeanNatRegister&gt;[http://www.tennessean.com/article/20110414/WILLIAMSON01/304140049/WSM-tower-gets-historic-status WSM tower gets 'historic' status], ''The Tennessean'', April 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20110325.htm |title=Weekly list of actions taken on properties: 3/14/11 through 3/18/11 |date=March 25, 2011 |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the distinctive diamond antenna design has been incorporated into logos of various organizations related to radio and a very large (scale) replica of the [[WSM (AM)]] Blaw-Knox tower has been built into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum#Architecture and design|Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]].

==Design==
The diamond-shaped tower was patented by Nicholas Gerten and Ralph Jenner for Blaw-Knox July 29, 1930.&lt;ref name="Patent"&gt;US patent 1897373, Nicholas Gerten, Ralph Lindsay Jenner, ''[https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/viewer?url=www.google.com/patents/US1897373.pdf    Wave Antenna]'', filed July 29, 1930, granted March 14, 1933&lt;/ref&gt;  and was one of the first [[mast radiator]]s.&lt;ref name="Radio-Craft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Siemens"&gt;{{cite journal

The distinguishing feature of the Blaw-Knox tower was its wide diamond (or [[rhomboidal]]) shape, which served to make it rigid, to resist shear stresses.  One advantage of this was to reduce the number of guy wires needed.  Blaw-Knox masts required only one set of 3 or 4 guy cables, attached at the tower's wide "waist".&lt;ref name="Radio-Craft" /&gt;   In contrast, narrow masts require 2 to 4 sets of guy cables, attached at different heights, to prevent the tower from buckling.  The advantage of fewer guy cables was to simplify the electrical design of the antenna, because conductive guy cables interfered with its [[radiation pattern]].  If not insulated at their bottom end, guy wires acted as additional "antennas" and conducted the power radiated by the antenna to ground, wasting power.  Even when insulated from ground, the sections of guy cable could act as "[[parasitic element|parasitic]]" resonant elements, reradiating the radio waves in other directions and thus altering the antenna's [[radiation pattern]].  In some Blaw-Knox mast designs ''(see WBT towers, right)'' the upper pyramidal section was made longer than the lower, to keep the attachment point of the guys as low as possible, to minimize their interference.

Another advantage mentioned in the patent was that the tower could be erected in two parts.  Half of the mast could be built, then its wide central section could be used as a stable base on which to erect the other half.

== Extant examples ==
Many Blaw-Knox towers, of both conventional (uniform cross-section) and diamond design, remain in use in the [[United States]].  Few of the diamond towers were built, and several remain; all transmit [[AM radio]] signals:
* [[WSM (AM)|WSM]], [[Nashville, Tennessee]]: 808&amp;nbsp;ft (246 m); originally 874&amp;nbsp;ft (267 m); tower located in [[Brentwood, Tennessee]].
* [[WLW]], [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]: 747&amp;nbsp;ft (227 m); originally 831&amp;nbsp;ft (253 m); tower located in [[Mason, Ohio]].
* [[WBT (AM)|WBT]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]: three towers, 428&amp;nbsp;ft (130 m) each (one original, two reproductions from the original plans after the originals were destroyed by [[Hurricane Hugo]])
* [[WFEA]], [[Manchester, New Hampshire]]: 400&amp;nbsp;ft (121 m); tower located in [[Merrimack, New Hampshire]].
* [[WBNS (AM)|WBNS]], [[Columbus, Ohio]]: 380&amp;nbsp;ft (116 m)

Several additional diamond-cantilever towers were built at stations in the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] of [[California]] but are less well known.  These towers were much smaller in both height and cross-section than the towers listed elsewhere; only one&amp;nbsp;— [[KSTN (AM)|KSTN]], [[Stockton, California|Stockton]]&lt;ref name="Fybush"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Historic AMs of Stockton, California|first=Scott|last=Fybush|work=Fybush.com|date=2005-11-18|accessdate=2009-01-19|url=http://www.fybush.com/sites/2005/site-051118.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— remains in use for broadcasting.

The following Blaw-Knox diamond-cantilever towers remain standing in Europe:
*[[Lisnagarvey transmitting station|Lisnagarvey Mast]] (constructed: 1936) at [[Lisnagarvey]], Northern Ireland
*[[Lakihegy Tower]] (constructed: 1933, height: 314 metres, 1030&amp;nbsp;ft) at [[Szigetszentmiklós]]-Lakihegy, [[Hungary]] (The tallest Blaw-Knox tower ever built)
*[[Vakarel Transmitter]] (constructed: 1937, height: 215 metres, 705&amp;nbsp;ft) at Vakarel, Bulgaria

The 480-foot self-supporting tower (four legs up to 400&amp;nbsp;ft., topped with an 80-foot pole), of WKQI (FM) Detroit is a Blaw-Knox tower.  It began transmitting in 1949, when the station was WLDM.  It is located on Ten Mile Rd. in the suburb of Oak Park.

== Timeline of the initial incident ==

The incident began when a server used by the Climatic Research Unit was breached in "a sophisticated and carefully orchestrated attack",&lt;ref name="Norfolk Police"/&gt; and 160&amp;nbsp;{{abbr|MB|megabytes}} of data&lt;ref name="HickmanRanderson2009-11-20" /&gt; were obtained including more than 1,000 emails and 3,000 other documents.&lt;ref name="WaPo 21 Nov" /&gt; The University of East Anglia stated that the server from which the data were taken was not one that could be accessed easily, and that the data could not have been released inadvertently.&lt;ref name="NEN 1 Dec" /&gt; Norfolk Police later added that the offenders used methods that are common in unlawful internet activity, designed to obstruct later enquiries.&lt;ref name="Norfolk Police"/&gt; The breach was first discovered on 17 November 2009 after the server of the [[RealClimate]] website was also hacked and a copy of the stolen data was uploaded there.&lt;ref name="Revkin2009-11-20" /&gt; RealClimate's [[Gavin Schmidt]] said that he had information that the files had been obtained through "a hack into [CRU's] backup mail server".&lt;ref name="Arthur-Hacking into" /&gt; At about the same time, a short comment appeared on Stephen McIntyre's [[Climate Audit]] website saying that "A miracle has happened."&lt;ref name="Climate emails"/&gt;

On 19 November, an archive file containing the data was uploaded to a server in [[Tomsk]], Russia,&lt;ref name="Mail 6 Dec" /&gt; and then copied to numerous locations across the Internet.&lt;ref name="HickmanRanderson2009-11-20" /&gt; An [[anonymous post]] from a Saudi Arabian [[IP address]]&lt;ref name="timesonline20091206" /&gt; to the [[Global warming controversy|climate denialist]] blog ''The Air Vent''&lt;ref name="Revkin2009-11-20" /&gt; described the material as "a random selection of correspondence, code, and documents", adding that climate science is "too important to be kept under wraps".&lt;ref name="Webster2009-11-21" /&gt; That same day, [[Stephen McIntyre]] of Climate Audit was forwarded an internal email sent to UEA staff warning that "climate change sceptics" had obtained a "large volume of files and emails". Charles Rotter, moderator of the climate-sceptic blog ''[[Watts Up With That]]'', which had been the first to get a link and download the files, gave a copy to his flatmate Steve Mosher. Mosher received a posting from the hacker complaining that nothing was happening and replied: "A lot is happening behind the scenes. It is not being ignored. Much is being coordinated among major players and the media. Thank you very much. You will notice the beginnings of activity on other sites now. Here soon to follow." Shortly afterwards, the emails began to be widely publicised on climate-sceptic blogs.&lt;ref name="Climate emails"&gt;{{cite news | title = Climate emails: were they really hacked or just sitting in cyberspace? | url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/04/climate-change-email-hacker-police-investigation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909112253/http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/04/climate-change-email-hacker-police-investigation |archivedate=9 September 2013|last1 = Arthur | first1 = Charles | last2 = Evans | first2 = Rob | last3 = Leigh | first3 = David | last4 = Pearce | first4 = Evans | date = 4 February 2010 | work=The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 November, the story emerged in mainstream media.&lt;ref name="HickmanRanderson2009-11-20" /&gt;

[[Norfolk Constabulary|Norfolk police]] subsequently confirmed that they were "investigating criminal offences in relation to a data breach at the University of East Anglia" with the assistance of the Metropolitan Police [[Organisation and structure of the Metropolitan Police Service#Gangs and Organised Crime|Central e-Crime unit]],&lt;ref name="Mail 6 Dec" /&gt; the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO), and the [[National Domestic Extremism Team]] (NDET).&lt;ref name="NEN 11 Jan" /&gt; Commenting on the involvement of the NDET, a spokesman said: "At present we have two police officers assisting Norfolk with their investigation, and we have also provided computer forensic expertise. While this is not strictly a domestic extremism matter, as a national police unit we had the expertise and resource to assist with this investigation, as well as good background knowledge of climate change issues in relation to criminal investigations." However, the police cautioned that "major investigations of this nature are of necessity very detailed and as a consequence can take time to reach a conclusion".&lt;ref name="BBC 11 Jan" /&gt; On 18 July 2012, the Norfolk police finally decided to close its investigation because they did not have a "realistic prospect of identifying the offender or offenders and launching criminal proceedings within the time constraints imposed by law". They also said that the attack had been carried out "remotely via the internet", and that there was "no evidence to suggest that anyone working at or associated with the University of East Anglia was involved in the crime".&lt;ref name="Norfolk Police"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norfolk.police.uk/newsevents/newsstories/2012/july/ueadatabreachinvestigation.aspx |title=Police closes UEA investigation |last=Norfolk Constabulary |date=18 July 2012 |accessdate=18 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719071718/http://www.norfolk.police.uk/newsevents/newsstories/2012/july/ueadatabreachinvestigation.aspx |archivedate=19 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content of the documents ==

{{details|Climatic Research Unit documents}}

The material comprised more than 1,000 emails, 2,000 documents, as well as [[Comment (computer programming)|commented]] [[source code]], pertaining to [[climate-change]] research, covering a period from 1996 until 2009.&lt;ref name="Reuters_23_Nov" /&gt; According to an analysis in ''[[The Guardian]]'', the vast majority of the emails related to four climatologists: [[Phil Jones (climatologist)|Phil Jones]], the head of the CRU; [[Keith Briffa]], a CRU climatologist specialising in tree ring analysis; Tim Osborn, a climate modeller at CRU; and [[Mike Hulme]], director of the [[Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research]]. The four were either recipients or senders of all but 66 of the 1,073 emails, with most of the remainder of the emails being sent from mailing lists. A few other emails were sent by, or to, other staff at the CRU. Jones, Briffa, Osborn and Hulme had written high-profile scientific papers on climate change that had been cited in reports by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].&lt;ref name="Arthur-Hacking into" /&gt;

Most of the emails concerned technical and mundane aspects of climate research, such as data analysis and details of scientific conferences.&lt;ref name="Flam2009-12_08" /&gt; ''The Guardian's'' analysis of the emails suggests that the hacker had filtered them. Four scientists were targeted and a concordance plot shows that the words "data", "climate", "paper", "research", "temperature" and "model" were predominant.&lt;ref name="Arthur-Hacking into"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/feb/05/cru-climate-change-hacker | title = Hacking into the mind of the CRU climate change hacker | last = Arthur | first = Charles | date = 5 February 2010 |work=The Guardian |location=UK | quote = | accessdate =19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy has focused on a small number of emails&lt;ref name="Flam2009-12_08" /&gt; with "climate sceptic" websites picking out particular phrases, such as one in which [[Kevin Trenberth]] said, "The fact is that we can’t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can’t".&lt;ref name = "Revkin2009-11-20" /&gt; This was actually part of a discussion on the need for better monitoring of the energy flows involved in short-term climate variability,&lt;ref name="Trenberth-NCAR" /&gt; but was grossly mischaracterised by critics.&lt;ref name="EPA 1.2.2.2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian 9 Feb part2" /&gt;

Many commentators quoted one email in which Phil Jones said that he had used "Mike's ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' trick" in a 1999 graph for the [[World Meteorological Organization]] "to hide the decline" in proxy temperatures derived from tree-ring analyses when measured temperatures were actually rising. This "decline" referred to the well-discussed tree-ring [[divergence problem]], but these two phrases were taken out of context by [[global warming sceptics]], including US Senator [[Jim Inhofe]] and former Governor of Alaska [[Sarah Palin]], as though they referred to some decline in measured global temperatures, even though they were written when temperatures were at a record high.&lt;ref name="Guardian 9 Feb part2" /&gt; [[John Tierney (journalist)|John Tierney]], writing in ''The New York Times'' in November 2009, said that the claims by sceptics of "hoax" or "fraud" were incorrect, but that the graph on the cover of a report for policy makers and journalists did not show these non-experts where proxy measurements changed to measured temperatures.&lt;ref name=Tierney/&gt; The final analyses from various subsequent inquiries concluded that in this context "trick" was normal scientific or mathematical jargon for a neat way of handling data, in this case a statistical method used to bring two or more different kinds of data sets together in a legitimate fashion.&lt;ref name="Randerson2010-03-31" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PSU Findings" /&gt; The EPA notes that in fact, the evidence shows that the research community was fully aware of these issues and that no one was hiding or concealing them.&lt;ref name="EPA 1.1.4" /&gt;

== Responses ==
Former Republican [[House Science Committee]] chairman [[Sherwood Boehlert]] called the attacks a "manufactured distraction", and the dispute was described as a "highly orchestrated" and [[manufactured controversy]] by ''Newsweek'' and ''The New York Times''. Concerns about the media's role in promoting early allegations while also minimising later coverage exonerating the scientists were raised by journalists and policy experts. Historian [[Spencer R. Weart]] of the [[American Institute of Physics]] said the incident was unprecedented in the history of science, having "never before seen a set of people accuse an entire community of scientists of deliberate deception and other professional malfeasance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Freedman |first=Andrew |date=23 November 2009 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/science-historian-reacts-to-hacked-climate-e-mails/2010/12/20/ABoXx3F_blog.html |title=Science historian reacts to hacked climate e-mails |work=The Washington Post |quote=The theft and use of the emails does reveal something interesting about the social context.

In the United Kingdom and United States, there were calls for official inquiries into issues raised by the documents. The British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician [[Nigel Lawson|Lord Lawson]]&lt;!--his new "foundation" not formed then, not mentioned in source: and founder of the [[Global Warming Policy Foundation]]--&gt; said: "The integrity of the scientific evidence ... has been called into question.

[[Bob Ward (communications director)|Bob Ward]] of the [[Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment]] at the [[London School of Economics]] said that there had to be a rigorous investigation into the substance of the email messages, once appropriate action has been taken over the hacking, to clear the impression of impropriety given by the selective disclosure and dissemination of the messages.&lt;ref name="Guardian 23 Nov" /&gt; [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Jim Inhofe]], who had previously stated that global warming was "the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=298&amp;articleid=20091118_298_0_WSIGOS499419 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20091120185715/http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=298&amp;articleid=20091118_298_0_WSIGOS499419 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 20 November 2009 | title = Inhofe declares victory in speech on global warming | publisher=Tulsa World | accessdate =26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; also planned to demand an inquiry.&lt;ref name="Inhofe 23 Nov" /&gt; In a debate in the [[United States House of Representatives]] on 2 December 2009, Republicans read out extracts from eight of the emails, and Representative [[Jim Sensenbrenner]] said: "These e-mails show a pattern of suppression, manipulation and secrecy that was inspired by ideology, condescension and profit". In response,  the president's science adviser [[John Holdren]] said that the science was proper, and the emails only concerned a fraction of the research. Government scientist [[Jane Lubchenco]] said that the emails "do nothing to undermine the very strong scientific consensus" that the Earth is warming, largely due to human actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Borenstein | first = Seth | title = Business &amp; Technology : Obama science advisers grilled over hacked e-mails  | url = http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2010411091_apsciclimatehearing.html | publisher = Seattle Times Newspaper | date = 3 December 2009 | accessdate = 11 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate change sceptics gained wide publicity in blogs and news media,&lt;ref name="Guardian 9 Feb part2" /&gt; making allegations that the hacked emails showed evidence that climate scientists manipulated data.&lt;ref name="HickmanRanderson2009-11-20" /&gt; A few other commentators such as [[Roger A.

An editorial in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' stated that "A fair reading of the e-mails reveals nothing to support the denialists' conspiracy theories." It said that emails showed harassment of researchers, with multiple [[Freedom of Information requests to the Climatic Research Unit]], but release of information had been hampered by national government restrictions on releasing the meteorological data researchers had been using. ''Nature'' considered that emails had not shown anything that undermined the scientific case on [[Anthropogenic global warming|human-caused global warming]] or raised any substantive reasons for concern about the researchers' own papers.&lt;ref name="Nature_2009-12-03" /&gt; [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] reported that academics and climate change researchers dismissed the allegations, saying that nothing in the emails proved wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="Moore2009-11-24" /&gt; Independent reviews by [[FactCheck]] and the [[Associated Press]] said that the emails did not affect evidence that man-made global warming is a real threat, and said that emails were being misrepresented to support unfounded claims of scientific misconduct. The AP said that the "[e]-mails stolen from climate scientists show they stonewalled sceptics and discussed hiding data".&lt;ref name="fc_2009-12-10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ap_2009-12-12" /&gt; In this context, John Tierney of ''The New York Times'' wrote: "these researchers, some of the most prominent climate experts in Britain and America, seem so focused on winning the public-relations war that they exaggerate their certitude&amp;nbsp;— and ultimately undermine their own cause".&lt;ref name=Tierney&gt;Tierney, John.

=== University of East Anglia ===
The [[University of East Anglia]] was notified of the security breach on 17 November 2009, but when the story was published in the press on 20 November, they had no statement ready.&lt;ref name="Monbiot 11-25" /&gt; On 24 November, Trevor Davies, the University of East Anglia pro-vice-chancellor with responsibility for research, rejected calls for Jones' resignation or firing: "We see no reason for Professor Jones to resign and, indeed, we would not accept his resignation. He is a valued and important scientist." The university announced that it would conduct an independent review into issues including [[Freedom of Information requests to the Climatic Research Unit]]: it would "address the issue of data security, an assessment of how we responded to a deluge of Freedom of Information requests, and any other relevant issues which the independent reviewer advises should be addressed".&lt;ref name="Hickman2009-11-24" /&gt;

The university announced on 1 December that Phil Jones was to stand aside as director of the Unit until the completion of the review.&lt;ref name="UEA 01&amp;nbsp;Dec" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph2009-12-01" /&gt; Two days later, the university announced that Sir [[Muir Russell]] would chair the inquiry, which would be known as the Independent Climate Change Email Review, and would "examine email exchanges to determine whether there is evidence of suppression or manipulation of data". The review would also scrutinise the CRU's policies and practices for "acquiring, assembling, subjecting to peer review, and disseminating data and research findings" and "their compliance or otherwise with best scientific practice". In addition, the investigation would review CRU's compliance with Freedom of Information Act requests and also "make recommendations about the management, governance and security structures for CRU and the security, integrity and release of the data it holds".&lt;ref name="BBC 3 Dec" /&gt; The Independent Climate Change Email Review report was published on 7 July 2010.&lt;ref name="2010-06-21_cce-review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cce-review.org/News.php | title = The Independent Climate Change Email inquiry | accessdate =17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 March 2010 the university announced the composition of an independent Science Assessment Panel to reassess key CRU papers that have already been peer-reviewed and published in journals. The panel did not seek to evaluate the science itself, but rather whether "the conclusions [reached by the CRU] represented an honest and scientifically justified interpretation of the data". The university consulted with the [[Royal Society]] in establishing the panel. It was chaired by [[Ronald Oxburgh, Baron Oxburgh|Lord Oxburgh]], and its membership consisted of Huw Davies of [[ETH Zurich]], Kerry Emanual of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], Lisa Graumlich of the [[University of Arizona]], [[David Hand (statistician)|David Hand]] of [[Imperial College London]], and [[Herbert Huppert]] and [[Michael Kelly (physicist)|Michael Kelly]] of the University of Cambridge. It started its work in March 2010 and released its report on 14 April 2010. During its inquiry, the panel examined eleven representative CRU publications, selected with advice from the [[Royal Society]], that spanned a period of over 20 years, as well as other CRU research materials. It also spent fifteen person-days at the UEA carrying out interviews with scientists.&lt;ref name="SAP-Report" /&gt;

=== Climatologists ===
Among the scientists whose emails were disclosed, the CRU's researchers said in a statement that the emails had been taken out of context and merely reflected an honest exchange of ideas. [[Michael E. Mann|Michael Mann]], director of [[Pennsylvania State University]]'s Earth System Science Center, said that sceptics were "taking these words totally out of context to make something trivial appear nefarious"&lt;ref name="WaPo 21 Nov" /&gt; and called the entire incident a careful, "high-level, orchestrated smear campaign to distract the public about the nature of the climate change problem".&lt;ref name="NYTimes 24 Nov" /&gt; [[Kevin E. Trenberth]] of the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] said that he was appalled at the release of the emails but thought that it might backfire against climate sceptics, as the messages would show "the integrity of scientists".&lt;ref name="Revkin2009-11-20" /&gt; He also said that climate change sceptics had selectively quoted words and phrases out of context and that the timing suggested an attempt to undermine talks at the December 2009 [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Copenhagen global climate summit]].&lt;ref name="AP 22 Nov" /&gt; [[Tom Wigley]], a former director of the CRU and now head of the US [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]], condemned the threats that he and other colleagues had received as "truly stomach-turning", and commented: "None of it affects the science one iota. Accusations of data distortion or faking are baseless. I can rebut and explain all of the apparently incriminating e-mails that I have looked at, but it is going to be very time consuming to do so."&lt;ref name="Guardian 8 Dec" /&gt; In relation to the harassment that he and his colleagues were experiencing, he said: "This sort of thing has been going on at a much lower level for almost 20 years and there have been other outbursts of this sort of behaviour&amp;nbsp;– criticism and abusive emails and things like that in the past. So this is a worse manifestation but it's happened before so it's not that surprising."&lt;ref name="ABC Collins 9 Dec" /&gt;

Other prominent climate scientists, such as [[Richard Somerville]], called the incident a smear campaign.&lt;ref name="Reuters 25 Nov" /&gt; [[David Reay]] of the [[University of Edinburgh]] said that the CRU "is just one of many climate-research institutes that provide the underlying scientific basis for climate policy at national and international levels. The conspiracy theorists may be having a field day, but if they really knew academia they would also know that every published paper and data set is continually put through the wringer by other independent research groups. The information that makes it into the IPCC reports is some of the most rigorously tested and debated in any area of science."&lt;ref name="Guardian 8 Dec" /&gt; [[Stephen Schneider]] compared the political attacks on climate scientists to the [[witch-hunt]]s of [[McCarthyism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tollefson |first=Jeff |date=9 March 2010 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100309/full/464149a.html |title=Attack sparks memories of McCarthy witch-hunt |journal=Nature News |publisher=Nature Publishing Group |volume=464 |issue=149 |doi=10.1038/464149a |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Hansen]] said that the controversy has "no effect on the science" and that while some of the emails reflect poor judgment, the evidence for human-made climate change is overwhelming.&lt;ref name="Newsweek blog James Hanse 25 Nov" /&gt;

One of the IPCC's lead authors, [[Raymond Pierrehumbert]] of the [[University of Chicago]], expressed concern at the precedent established by this incident: "[T]his is a criminal act of vandalism and of harassment of a group of scientists that are only going about their business doing science. It represents a whole new escalation in the war on climate scientists who are only trying to get at the truth... What next? Deliberate monkeying with data on servers? Insertion of bugs into climate models?"&lt;ref name="Revkin2009-11-22" /&gt; Another IPCC lead author, [[David Karoly]] of the [[University of Melbourne]], reported receiving hate emails in the wake of the incident and said that he believed that there was "an organised campaign to discredit individual climate scientists". [[Andrew Pitman]] of the [[University of New South Wales]] commented: "The major problem is that scientists have to be able to communicate their science without fear or favour and there seems to be a well-orchestrated campaign designed to intimidate some scientists."&lt;ref name="ABC O'Neill 9 Dec" /&gt;

In response to the incident, 1,700 British scientists signed a joint statement circulated by the UK [[Met Office]] declaring their "utmost confidence in the observational evidence for global warming and the scientific basis for concluding that it is due primarily to human activities".&lt;ref name="Times statement 9 Dec" /&gt;

[[Patrick Michaels|Patrick J. Michaels]], who was criticised in the emails and who has long faulted evidence pointing to human-driven warming, said: "This is not a smoking gun; this is a mushroom cloud". He said that some emails showed an effort to block the release of data for independent review and that some messages discussed discrediting him by stating that he knew his research was wrong in his doctoral dissertation, "This shows these are people willing to bend rules and go after other people's reputations in very serious ways."&lt;ref name="Revkin2009-11-20" /&gt;

[[Judith Curry]] wrote that, in her opinion, "there are two broader issues raised by these emails that are impeding the public credibility of climate research: lack of transparency in climate data, and 'tribalism' in some segments of the climate research community that is impeding peer review and the assessment process". She hoped that the affair would change the approach of scientists to providing their data to the public and their response to criticisms of their work. She had herself learned to be careful about what to put in emails when a "disgruntled employee" made a freedom of information request. Mann described these comments as "somewhat naive" considering that in recent years scientists had become much more open with their data. He said that sceptics "will always complain about something else, want something more. Eventually, as we see, they've found a way to get access to private communications between scientists."&lt;ref name="NYTimes 24 Nov" /&gt;

[[Hans von Storch]], who also concurs with the mainstream view on global warming,&lt;ref name="Storch" /&gt; said that the University of East Anglia (UEA) had "violated a fundamental principle of science" by refusing to share data with other researchers. "They play science as a power game," he said.&lt;ref name="wsjms" /&gt; On 24 November 2009 the university had stated that 95% of the raw station data was accessible via the [[Global Historical Climatology Network]], and had been for several years. They were already working with the Met Office to obtain permissions to release the remaining raw data.&lt;ref name="update 2"&gt;{{Cite web | title = CRU update 2  | url = http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2009/nov/CRUupdate | publisher=University of East Anglia (UEA)  | date = 24 November 2009 | accessdate =23 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scientific organisations ===

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group I issued statements that the assessment process, involving hundreds of scientists worldwide, is designed to be transparent and to prevent any individual or small group from manipulating the process. The statement said that the "internal consistency from multiple lines of evidence strongly supports the work of the scientific community, including those individuals singled out in these email exchanges".&lt;ref name="IPCC WGI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IPCC RKP" /&gt;

The [[American Meteorological Society]] stated that the incident did not affect the society's position on climate change. They pointed to the breadth of evidence for human influence on climate, stating:&lt;ref name="AMS clarification" /&gt;
{{quote|For climate change research, the body of research in the literature is very large and the dependence on any one set of research results to the comprehensive understanding of the climate system is very, very small. Even if some of the charges of improper behavior in this particular case turn out to be true—which is not yet clearly the case—the impact on the science of climate change would be very limited.}}

The [[American Geophysical Union]] issued a statement that they found "it offensive that these emails were obtained by illegal cyber attacks and they are being exploited to distort the scientific debate about the urgent issue of climate change". They reaffirmed their 2007 position statement on climate change "based on the large body of scientific evidence that Earth's climate is warming and that human activity is a contributing factor. Nothing in the University of East Anglia hacked e-mails represents a significant challenge to that body of scientific evidence."&lt;ref name="AGU Statement" /&gt;

The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) reaffirmed its position on global warming and "expressed grave concerns that the illegal release of private emails stolen from the University of East Anglia should not cause policy-makers and the public to become confused about the scientific basis of global climate change. Scientific integrity demands robust, independent peer review, however, and AAAS therefore emphasised that investigations are appropriate whenever significant questions are raised regarding the transparency and rigour of the scientific method, the peer-review process, or the responsibility of individual scientists. The responsible institutions are mounting such investigations." [[Alan I. Leshner]], CEO of the AAAS and executive publisher of the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', said: "AAAS takes issues of scientific integrity very seriously. It is fair and appropriate to pursue answers to any allegations of impropriety. It’s important to remember, though, that the reality of climate change is based on a century of robust and well-validated science."&lt;ref name="AAAS" /&gt;

=== UK Met Office ===
On 23 November 2009, a spokesman for the [[Met Office]], the UK's national weather service, which works with the CRU in providing global temperature information, said that there was no need for an inquiry. "The bottom line is that temperatures continue to rise and humans are responsible for it. We have every confidence in the science and the various datasets we use. The peer-review process is as robust as it could possibly be."&lt;ref name="Guardian 23 Nov" /&gt;

On 5 December 2009, however, the Met Office indicated its intention to re-examine 160 years of temperature data in the light of concerns that public confidence in the science had been damaged by the controversy over the emails.&lt;ref name="Webster2009-12-05" /&gt; The Met Office would also publish online the temperature records for over 1,000 worldwide weather stations.&lt;ref name="Guardian 5 Dec 09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MetOffice" /&gt; It remained confident that its analysis would be shown to be correct&lt;ref name="Webster2009-12-05" /&gt; and that the data would show a temperature rise over the past 150 years.&lt;ref name="Guardian 5 Dec 09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN 6 Dec" /&gt;

===Other responses===
[[Rajendra K. Pachauri|Rajendra Pachauri]], as chairman of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], told the BBC in December 2009 that he considered the affair to be "a serious issue" and that they "will look into it in detail".&lt;ref name="2009-12-04_BBC" /&gt; He later clarified that the IPCC would review the incident to identify lessons to be learned and rejected suggestions that the IPCC itself should carry out an investigation.

In a series of emails sent through a [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) [[listserv]], apparently forwarded outside the group by an unknown person, scientists discussing the "Climategate" fallout considered launching advertising campaigns, widening their public presence, pushing the NAS to take a more active role in explaining climate science and creating a nonprofit to serve as a voice for the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2010/03/05/05greenwire-e-mails-show-scientists-planning-push-back-aga-33296.html | title = E-Mails Show Scientists Planning Push-Back Against 'McCarthyite' Attacks on Climate Science | last = Kaplun | first = Alex | date = 5 March 2010 |work=The New York Times | accessdate =11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper by [[Reiner Grundmann]] used a limited account of the events to discuss norms of scientific practice in relation to two [[science ethics]] approaches, the [[Mertonian norms]] as of [[Robert K. Merton]], and [[Roger Pielke Jr.]]'s concept of [[honest broker]]ing in science policy interactions. Sources for the paper were chosen for accessibility, emphasising "critical accounts".&lt;ref&gt;[[Reiner Grundmann]].

Footnote 3, p. 88–89, "The story presented here does not attempt to provide an in-depth account of the climategate affair. It is based on a limited number of textual sources (such as Montford 2010; Pearce 2010, blog content, commentary, reports from official inquiries, and a subset of released climate emails). These limitations in the data need to be noted. The paper raises the question of how to assess knowledge production in a highly politicized context. Sources were selected on accessibility criteria with a special emphasis on critical accounts. The aim of the paper is not to adjudicate who was right and who was wrong about the science, but to discuss norms of scientific practice in the light of two theoretical frameworks." Footnote 5 cites "Wikipedia entry on 'Climatic Research Unit E-mail Controversy'".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inquiries and reports ==
Eight committees investigated the allegations and published reports, finding no evidence of fraud or scientific misconduct.&lt;ref name="6committees" /&gt; The scientific consensus that global warming is occurring as a result of [[Human impact on the environment|human activity]] remained unchanged by the end of the investigations.&lt;ref name="scientificamerican" /&gt; However, the reports urged the scientists to avoid any such allegations in the future, and to regain [[Public opinion on climate change|public confidence]] following this media storm, with "more efforts than ever to make available all their supporting data – right down to the [[Source code|computer codes]] they use – to allow their findings to be properly [[Verification and validation|verified]]". Climate scientists and organisations pledged to improve scientific research and collaboration with other researchers by improving [[data management]] and [[Open access|opening up access]] to data, and to honour any [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|freedom of information]] requests that relate to climate science.&lt;ref name="IWR"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Venkatraman|first=Archana|date=September–October 2010|title=Data Without the Doubts|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Data+without+the+doubts%3A+the+climategate+furore+has+galvanised+the...-a0257556897|journal=[[Information World Review]]|publisher=Bizmedia Ltd.|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== House of Commons Science and Technology Committee ===
On 22 January 2010, the [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|House of Commons]] [[Science and Technology Select Committee]] announced it would conduct an inquiry into the affair, examining the implications of the disclosure for the integrity of scientific research, reviewing the scope of the independent Muir Russell review announced by the UEA, and reviewing the independence of international [[Climate Data Records|climate data sets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/science_technology/s_t_pn14_100122.cfm | title = Science and Technology Committee Announcement: The Disclosure of Climate Data from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia | accessdate =22 January 2010 | date = 22 January 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125134148/http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/science_technology/s_t_pn14_100122.cfm|archivedate=25 January 2010}}.

They included submissions from the [[University of East Anglia]], the [[Global Warming Policy Foundation]], the [[Institute of Physics]], the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]], the [[Met Office]], several other professional bodies, prominent scientists, some climate change sceptics, several [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] and other interested parties.&lt;ref name="HoC memoranda"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmsctech/memo/climatedata/contents.htm | title = Science and Technology&amp;nbsp;– Memoranda | publisher=House of Commons | accessdate =27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An oral evidence session was held on 1 March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date = 31 March 2010| author=Official Shorthand Writers to the Houses of Parliament| title = House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee, Session 2009–10: Uncorrected oral evidence, 1 March 2010, "The disclosure of climate data from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia," HC 387-i.

The Science and Technology Select Committee inquiry reported on 31 March 2010 that it had found that "the scientific reputation of Professor Jones and CRU remains intact". The emails and claims raised in the controversy did not challenge the scientific consensus that "global warming is happening and that it is induced by human activity". The MPs had seen no evidence to support claims that Jones had tampered with data or interfered with the peer-review process.&lt;ref name="ST"/&gt;

The committee criticised a "culture of non-disclosure at CRU" and a general lack of transparency in climate science where scientific papers had usually not included all the data and code used in reconstructions. It said that "even if the data that CRU used were not publicly available—which they mostly are—or the methods not published—which they have been—its published results would still be credible: the results from CRU agree with those drawn from other international data sets; in other words, the analyses have been repeated and the conclusions have been verified." The report added that "scientists could have saved themselves a lot of trouble by aggressively publishing all their data instead of worrying about how to stonewall their critics." The committee criticised the university for the way that [[Freedom of Information requests to the Climatic Research Unit|freedom of information requests were handled]], and for failing to give adequate support to the scientists to deal with such requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmsctech/387/387i.pdf | title = The disclosure of climate data from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia | publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom | work=House of Commons Science and Technology Committee |pages=52–54 | date = 31 March 2010 |quote =The committee's report was not unanimous; Labour MP [[Graham Stringer]] voted against several of its recommendations including an amendment by Evan Harris declaring that Dr Jones' scientific reputation remained intact.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee chairman [[Phil Willis]] said that the "standard practice" in climate science generally of not routinely releasing all raw data and computer codes "needs to change and it needs to change quickly". Jones had admitted sending "awful emails"; Willis commented that "[Jones] probably wishes that emails were never invented," but "apart from that we do believe that Prof. Jones has in many ways been scapegoated as a result of what really was a frustration on his part that people were asking for information purely to undermine his research."&lt;ref name="Randerson2010-03-31" /&gt; In Willis' view this did not excuse any failure to deal properly with FOI Act requests, but the committee accepted that Jones had released all the data that he could.&lt;ref name="Randerson2010-03-31" /&gt; It stated: "There is no reason why Professor Jones should not resume his post. He was certainly not co-operative with those seeking to get data, but that was true of all the climate scientists".&lt;ref name="Webster2010-03-31" /&gt;

The committee was careful to point out that its report had been written after a single day of oral testimony and would not be as in-depth as other inquiries.&lt;ref name="ST"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2011482792_climate31.html? | title = 'Climategate' inquiry largely clears scientists | agency=Associated Press | location = London | newspaper=[[Seattle Times]] | last = Satter | first = Raphael G. | date = 30 March 2010 | accessdate =17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Science Assessment Panel ===

The report of the independent Science Assessment Panel was published on 14 April 2010 and concluded that the panel had seen "no evidence of any deliberate scientific malpractice in any of the work of the Climatic Research Unit." It found that the CRU's work had been "carried out with integrity" and had used "fair and satisfactory" methods. The CRU was found to be "objective and dispassionate in their view of the data and their results, and there was no hint of tailoring results to a particular agenda." Instead, "their sole aim was to establish as robust a record of temperatures in recent centuries as possible."&lt;ref name="SAP-Report" /&gt;

The panel commented that it was "very surprising that research in an area that depends so heavily on statistical methods has not been carried out in close collaboration with professional statisticians." It found that although the CRU had not made inappropriate use of statistical methods, some of the methods used may not have been the best for the purpose, though it said that "it is not clear, however, that better methods would have produced significantly different results." It suggested that the CRU could have done more to document and archive its work, data and algorithms and stated that the scientists were "ill prepared" for the amount of public attention generated by their work, commenting that "as with many small research groups their internal procedures were rather informal." The media and other scientific organisations were criticised for having "sometimes neglected" to reflect the uncertainties, doubts and assumptions of the work done by the CRU. The UK Government's policy of charging for access to scientific data was described as "inconsistent with policies of open access to data promoted elsewhere." The panel was also stated that "Although we deplore the tone of much of the criticism that has been directed at CRU, we believe that this questioning of the methods and data used in dendroclimatology will ultimately have a beneficial effect and improve working practices." It found that some of the criticism had been "selective and uncharitable" and critics had displayed "a lack of awareness" of the difficulties of research in this area.&lt;ref name="SAP-Report" /&gt;

Speaking at a press conference to announce the report, the panel's chair, Lord Oxburgh, stated that his team had found "absolutely no evidence of any impropriety whatsoever" and that "whatever was said in the emails, the basic science seems to have been done fairly and properly." He said that many of the criticisms and allegations of scientific misconduct had been made by people "who do not like the implications of some of the conclusions" reached by the CRU's scientists. He said that the repeated FOI requests made by climate change sceptic Steve McIntyre and others could have amounted to a campaign of harassment, and the issue of how FOI laws should be applied in an academic context remained unresolved.&lt;ref name="Guardian_re_oxburgh"&gt;{{cite news | last = Adams | first = David | title = Scientists cleared of malpractice in UEA's hacked emails inquiry | url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/apr/14/oxburgh-uea-cleared-malpractice | work=The Guardian | date = 14 April 2010 | accessdate =14 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another panel member, Professor David Hand, commended the CRU for being explicit about the inherent uncertainties in its research data, commenting that "there is no evidence of anything underhand&amp;nbsp;– the opposite, if anything, they have brought out into the open the uncertainties with what they are dealing with."&lt;ref name="Telegraph2010-04-14"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/climatechange/7589715/Climategate-scientists-criticised-for-not-using-best-statistical-tools.html|title='Climategate' scientists criticised for not using best statistical tools|author=Louise Gray|date=14 April 2010|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=27 August 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the press conference, Hand also commented on the well publicised 1998 paper produced in the United States by scientists led by [[Michael E. Mann]], saying that the [[hockey stick graph]] it showed was a genuine effect, but he had an "uneasy feeling" about the use of "inappropriate statistical tools" and said that the 1998 study had exaggerated the effect. He commended McIntyre for pointing out this issue. Mann subsequently told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that the study had been examined and approved in the US National Academies of Science [[North Report]], and described Hand's comment as a "rogue opinion"  not meriting "much attention or credence".&lt;ref name="Guardian_re_oxburgh"/&gt;

The UEA's vice-chancellor, Edward Acton, welcomed the panel's findings. Describing its report as "hugely positive", he stated that "it is especially important that, despite a deluge of allegations and smears against the CRU, this independent group of utterly reputable scientists have concluded that there was no evidence of any scientific malpractice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 'No malpractice' by climate unit | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8618024.stm |publisher=BBC News | date = 14 April 2010 | accessdate =14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He criticised the way that the emails had been misrepresented, saying that "UEA has already put on record its deep regret and anger that the theft of emails from the University, and the blatant misrepresentation of their contents as revealed both in this report and the previous one by the Science and Technology Select Committee, damaged the reputation of UK climate science."&lt;ref name="Webster2010-04-14" /&gt; The UEA issued a statement in which it accepted that "things might have been done better." It said that improvements had already been undertaken by the CRU and others in the climate science community and that the University would "continue to ensure that these imperatives are maintained."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Response by the University of East Anglia to the Report by Lord Oxburgh's Science Assessment Panel | url = http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/CRUstatements/oxburgh | date = 14 April 2010 | accessdate =14 April 2010 | publisher=University of East Anglia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It later emerged that the Science Assessment Panel was not assessing the quality but instead the integrity of the CRU's science. Phil Willis described this a "sleight of hand" and was not what the Parliamentary Committee he had chaired had been led to believe. There were also questions about the selection of publications examined by the panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_8795000/8795643.stm |title=Third 'Climategate' inquiry to report, Today programme, BBC Radio 4, 7&amp;nbsp;July 2010 |publisher=BBC News |date=7 July 2010 |accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Oxburgh said that Acton had been wrong to tell the Science and Technology Select Committee in March that his inquiry would look into the science itself. "I think that was inaccurate," Oxburgh said. "This had to be done rapidly. This was their concern. They really wanted something within a month. There was no way our panel could evaluate the science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/sep/08/uea-emails-inquiry-science | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Oxburgh: UEA vice-chancellor was wrong to tell MPs he would investigate climate research | first=James | last=Randerson | date=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pennsylvania State University===
[[Pennsylvania State University]] announced in December 2009 it would review the work of [[Michael E. Mann]], in particular looking at anything that had not already been addressed in the 2006 [[North Report]] review by the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] which had investigated Mann's  "[[hockey stick graph]]" studies and found some faults with his 1998 methodology but agreed with the results which had been reaffirmed by later studies using different methods.&lt;ref name="Broder2009-12-01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PSU Mann review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP 3 Dec" /&gt; In response, Mann said he would welcome the review.&lt;ref name="AP 3 Dec" /&gt; The inquiry committee determined on 3 February 2010 that there was no credible evidence Mann suppressed or falsified data, destroyed emails, information and/or data related to the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]], or misused privileged or confidential information. The committee did not make a definitive finding on the final point of inquiry&amp;nbsp;— "whether Dr Mann seriously deviated from accepted practices within the academic community for proposing, conducting, or reporting research or other scholarly activities". The committee said that the earlier NAS inquiry had found "that Dr Mann’s science did fall well within the bounds of accepted practice", but in light of the newly available information this question of conduct was to be investigated by a second panel of five prominent Penn State scientists from other scientific disciplines.&lt;ref name="PSU Findings" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kintisch |first=Eli |title=Climate Scientist Mann Partially Absolved by Penn State |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2010/02/climate-scienti-1.html |publisher=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=3 February 2010 |accessdate=3 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925191452/http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2010/02/climate-scienti-1.html |archivedate=25 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second Investigatory Committee reported on 4 June 2010 that it had "determined that Dr Michael E. Mann did not engage in, nor did he participate in, directly or indirectly, any actions that seriously deviated from accepted practices within the academic community." Regarding his sharing unpublished manuscripts with colleagues on the assumption of implied consent, it considered such sharing to be "careless and inappropriate" without following the best practice of getting express consent from the authors in advance, though expert opinion on this varied. It said that his success in proposing research and obtaining funding for it, commenting that this "clearly places Dr Mann among the most respected scientists in his field. Such success would not have been possible had he not met or exceeded the highest standards of his profession for proposing research." Mann's extensive recognitions within the research community demonstrated that "his scientific work, especially the conduct of his research, has from the beginning of his career been judged to be outstanding by a broad spectrum of scientists." It agreed unanimously that "there is no substance" to the allegations against Mann.&lt;ref name="PSU Report"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://live.psu.edu/fullimg/userpics/10026/Final_Investigation_Report.pdf | title = Final Investigation Report Involving Dr. Michael E.

Mann said he regretted not objecting to a suggestion from Jones in a 29 May 2008 message that he destroy emails. "I wish in retrospect I had told him, 'Hey, you shouldn't even be thinking about this,'" Mann said in March 2010. "I didn't think it was an appropriate request." Mann's response to Jones at the time was that he would pass on the request to another scientist. "The important thing is, I didn't delete any emails. And I don't think [Jones] did either."&lt;ref name=Warner_2010_03_28&gt;{{cite news | last = Warner | first = Frank | title = Penn State climate professor: 'I'm a skeptic' | url = http://www.mcall.com/news/local/all-global-warming-penn-state-0328,0,777593,print.story | date = 3 January 2010 | accessdate = 28 March 2010 | work = The Morning Call | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5r1sXRN45?url=http://articles.mcall.com/2010-03-28/news/all-a1_5warming.7216773mar28_1_mails-e-mails-global-warming | archivedate = 6 July 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Independent Climate Change Email Review ===
First announced in December 2009, a British investigation commissioned by the UEA and chaired by Sir Muir Russell, published its final report in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cce-review.org/ The Independent Climate Change Email Review], an independent review funded by the UEA, chaired by [[Sir Muir Russell]]&lt;/ref&gt; The commission cleared the scientists and dismissed allegations that they manipulated their data. The "rigour and honesty" of the scientists at the Climatic Research Unit were found not to be in doubt.&lt;ref name="Gillis2010-07-07" /&gt; The panel found that they did not subvert the peer review process to censor criticism as alleged, and that the key data needed to reproduce their findings was freely available to any "competent" researcher.&lt;ref name="guardian_cleared"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jul/07/climategate-review-clears-scientists-dishonesty | title = 'Climategate' review clears scientists of dishonesty over data | last = Adam | first = David | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date = 7 July 2010 | accessdate =7 July 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The panel did rebuke the CRU for their reluctance to release computer files, and found that a graph produced in 1999 was "misleading," though not deliberately so as necessary caveats had been included in the accompanying text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Adam | first = David | title = 'Climategate' review clears scientists of dishonesty over data | url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jul/07/climategate-review-clears-scientists-dishonesty |work=The Guardian |location=UK | accessdate =11 July 2010 | date=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It found evidence that emails might have been deleted in order to make them unavailable should a subsequent request be made for them, though the panel did not ask anyone at CRU whether they had actually done this.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2010/jul/07/climategate-scientists Climategate: No whitewash, but CRU scientists are far from squeaky clean], Fred Pearce, The Guardian 7 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

At the conclusion of the inquiry, Jones was reinstated with the newly created post of Director of Research.&lt;ref name="Gillis2010-07-07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian_cleared" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cce_report"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cce-review.org/pdf/FINAL%20REPORT.pdf | title = The Independent Climate Change Email Review | date = 7 July 2010 | accessdate =7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States Environmental Protection Agency report===
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) had issued an "endangerment finding" in 2009 in preparation for climate regulations on excessive greenhouse gases. Petitions to reconsider this were raised by the states of [[Virginia]] and [[Texas]], conservative activists and business groups including the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]], the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] and the coal company [[Peabody Energy]], making claims that the CRU emails undermined the science.&lt;ref name="hill"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Geman | first = Ben | title = EPA rejects 'Climate-gate' bid to scuttle carbon rules | url = http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/677-e2-wire/111733-epa-rejects-climate-gate-bid-to-scuttle-carbon-rules- | publisher = [[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] | date = 29 July 2010 | accessdate = 16 September 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130105031117/thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/677-e2-wire/111733-epa-rejects-climate-gate-bid-to-scuttle-carbon-rules- | archivedate = 5 January 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA examined every email and concluded that there was no merit to the claims in the petitions, which "routinely misunderstood the scientific issues", reached "faulty scientific conclusions", "resorted to hyperbole", and "often cherry-pick language that creates the suggestion or appearance of impropriety, without looking deeper into the issues."&lt;ref name="beeb 6 August 2010"&gt;{{Cite news | last = | first = | title = Scientists' 'Climategate' e-mails 'just discussions' | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-10899538 | publisher = BBC News | date = 6 August 2010 | accessdate =16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement issued on 29 July 2010, EPA Administrator [[Lisa P. Jackson]] said the petitions were based "on selectively edited, out-of-context data and a manufactured controversy" and provided "no evidence to undermine our determination. Excess greenhouse gases are a threat to our health and welfare."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = | first = | title = 07/29/2010: EPA Rejects Claims of Flawed Climate Science | url = http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/0/56EB0D86757CB7568525776F0063D82F | publisher = EPA Newsroom | date = 29 July 2010 | accessdate =16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA issued a detailed report on issues raised by petitioners and responses, together with a fact sheet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://epa.gov/climatechange/endangerment/petitions.html | title = Denial of Petitions for Reconsideration of the Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act / Regulatory Initiatives / Climate Change / U.S. EPA | accessdate =16 September 2011 | date = 14 April 2011 | publisher = Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "myths versus facts" page stating that "Petitioners say that emails disclosed from CRU provide evidence of a conspiracy to manipulate data. The media coverage after the emails were released was based on email statements quoted out of context and on unsubstantiated theories of conspiracy. The CRU emails do not show either that the science is flawed or that the scientific process has been compromised. EPA carefully reviewed the CRU emails and found no indication of improper data manipulation or misrepresentation of results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://epa.gov/climatechange/endangerment/myths-facts.html | title = Myths vs. Facts: Denial of Petitions for Reconsideration of the Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act / Regulatory Initiatives / Climate Change / U.S. EPA | accessdate =16 September 2011 | date = 14 April 2011 | publisher = Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Commerce===
In May 2010 [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Jim Inhofe]] requested the [[Inspector General]] of the [[United States Department of Commerce]] to conduct an independent review of how the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) had dealt with the emails, and whether the emails showed any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca 110224"&gt;{{Cite news | title = U.S. scientists cleared in 'climategate' – Technology &amp;amp; Science | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2011/02/24/science-climategate-noaa.html | publisher = CBC News | date = 24 February 2011 | accessdate =3 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report, issued on 18 February 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oig.doc.gov/OIGPublications/2011.02.18_IG_to_Inhofe.pdf |title=Examination of issues related to internet posting of emails from Climatic Research Unit |accessdate=3 January 2012 |last=Zinser |first=Todd J. |date=18 February 2011 |format=pdf |publisher=Office of the [[Inspector General]] of the [[United States Department of Commerce]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110330133202/http://www.oig.doc.gov/OIGPublications/2011.02.18_IG_to_Inhofe.pdf |archivedate=30 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; cleared the researchers and "did not find any evidence that NOAA inappropriately manipulated data or failed to adhere to appropriate peer review procedures". It noted that NOAA reviewed its climate change data as standard procedure, not in response to the controversy. One email included a cartoon image showing Infofe and others marooned on a melting ice floe, NOAA had taken this up as a conduct issue. In response to questions raised, NOAA stated that its scientists had followed legal advice on FOIA requests for information which belonged to the IPCC and was made available by that panel. In two instances funding had been awarded to CRU,&lt;ref name="cbc.ca 110224" /&gt; NOAA stated that it was reviewing these cases and so far understood that the funds supported climate forecasting workshops in 2002 and 2003 assisting the governments of three countries.&lt;ref name="NOAA 110224"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Inspector General’s Review of Stolen Emails Confirms No Evidence of Wrong-Doing by NOAA Climate Scientists | url = http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2011/20110224_climate.html | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | date = 24 February 2011 | accessdate =3 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Science Foundation ===
The [[Office of the Inspector General]] (OIG) of the [[National Science Foundation]] closed an investigation on 15 August 2011 that exonerated [[Michael E.

==ICO decisions on Freedom of Information requests==
{{main|Freedom of Information requests to the Climatic Research Unit}}

In two cases, the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO) issued decisions on appeals of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests which had been turned down by the university.

David Holland, an electrical engineer from [[Northampton]], made a 2008 FOI request for all emails to and from [[Keith Briffa]] about the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]]; the university's information policy and compliance manager refused the request. On 23 November 2009, after the start of the controversy, he wrote to the Commissioner explaining in detail the relevance of the alleged CRU emails to his case,&lt;ref name="guardian 2010-02-25"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010 news reports highlighted that FOI legislation made it an offence to intentionally act to prevent the disclosure of requested information, but the [[statute of limitations]] meant that any prosecution had to be raised within 6 months of the alleged offence. This was discussed by the House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee.&lt;ref name=hocFOIA&gt;{{cite web | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmsctech/387/38706.htm#a16 | title = The disclosure of climate data from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia | publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom | work=House of Commons Science and Technology Committee |pages=28–31 | date = 31 March 2010 |quote =We regret that the ICO made a statement to the press that went beyond that which it could substantiate and that it took over a month for the ICO properly to put the record straight.

On the issue of the university failing to provide responses within the correct time, no further action was needed as Holland was content not to proceed with his complaint.&lt;ref name="FOI2010-07-07guardian" /&gt;

The Climatic Research Unit developed its gridded [[HadCRUT|CRUTEM]] [[data set]] of land air temperature anomalies from [[instrumental temperature record]]s held by [[:Template:National Meteorological Organisations|National Meteorological Organisations]] around the world, often under formal or informal confidentiality agreements that restricted use of this raw data to academic purposes, and prevented it from being passed onto third parties. Over 95% of the CRU climate data set had been available to the public for several years before July 2009,&lt;ref name="update 2"/&gt; when the university received numerous FOI requests for raw data or details of the confidentiality agreements from [[Stephen McIntyre]] and readers of his [[Climate Audit]] blog.

Though some National Meteorological Organisations gave full or conditional agreement to waive confidentiality, others failed to respond, and the request was explicitly refused by [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Poland]]. In discussions with the ICO, the university argued that the data was publicly available from the Met organisations, and the lack of agreement exempted the remaining data. In its decision released on 23 June 2011, the ICO stated that the data was not easily available, and required the university to release the data covered by the FOIA request.&lt;ref name="FER0280033" /&gt; On 27 July 2011 CRU announced that the raw instrumental data not already in the public domain had been released and was available for download, with the exception of Poland which was outside the area covered by the FOIA request. The university remained concerned "that the forced release of material from a source which has explicitly refused to give permission for release could have some damaging consequences for the UK in international research collaborations."&lt;ref name="beeb 27 July 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cru3 11"&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Climate data released – University of East Anglia (UEA) | url = http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2011/July/crutem3 | accessdate =4 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011 the ICO issued new guidance to universities, taking into account issues raised in relation to the CRU information requests. This describes exceptions and exemptions to protect research, including allowance for internal exchange of views between academics and researchers, leaving formulation of opinions on research free from external scrutiny. It notes the benefits of actively disclosing information when it is in the public interest, and disclosure of personal email information related to public authority business.&lt;ref name="guidance Sept 11"&gt;{{Cite web   | title = ICO issues FoI guidance for universities : Guardian Government Computing : Guardian Professional | url = http://education.governmentcomputing.com/news/2011/sep/26/higher-education-freedom-information-guidance | publisher =''[[The Guardian]]''  | date =26 September 2011  | accessdate = 26 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial story about the hacking originated in the [[blogosphere]],&lt;ref name="Leiserowitz"/&gt; with columnist [[James Delingpole]] picking up the term "Climategate" from an [[anonymous blogger]] on ''[[Watts Up With That?]]'', a blog created by climate sceptic [[Anthony Watts (blogger)|Anthony Watts]]. The site was one of three blogs that received links to the leaked documents on 17 November 2009. Delingpole first used the word "Climategate" in the title of his 20 November article for ''The Telegraph'': "Climategate: the final nail in the coffin of 'Anthropogenic Global Warming'?" A week later, his co-worker Christopher Booker gave Delingpole credit for coining the term.&lt;ref name="Delingpole1"&gt;Allchen 2010, p. 591: "James Delingpole, in a blog for England's ''Telegraph'', promptly dubbed it "Climategate." See: Allchen, Douglas. (2010). "Sacred Bovines: The Nature of Science From Test Tubes to YouTube". ''American Biology Teacher''. '''72''' (9):590–592. {{doi|10.1525/abt.2010.72.9.15}}; Booker 2009: "A week after my colleague James Delingpole , on his Telegraph blog, coined the term 'Climategate' to describe the scandal revealed by the leaked emails from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit, Google was showing that the word now appears across the internet more than nine million times." See: Booker, Christopher (2009) "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/christopherbooker/6679082/Climate-change-this-is-the-worst-scientific-scandal-of-our-generation.html Climate change: this is the worst scientific scandal of our generation]". ''The Telegraph''. 28 November; For the original article see: Delingpole, James (2009). "[http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100017393/climategate-the-final-nail-in-the-coffin-of-anthropogenic-global-warming/ Climategate: the final nail in the coffin of 'Anthropogenic Global Warming'?]" ''The Telegraph''. 20 November; Nine days after his original article, Delingpole clarified how he came up with the name. Although he has been given credit for coining and popularizing the term (Booker 2009; Allchin 2010, etc.) he got the original idea from an anonymous blogger named "Bulldust" on the [[Watts Up With That]] blog. See: Delingpole, James (2009). "[http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100018246/climategate-how-the-greatest-scientific-scandal-of-our-generation-got-its-name/ Climategate: how the 'greatest scientific scandal of our generation' got its name]". ''The Telegraph''. 29 November; Delingpole told [[Dennis Miller]], "Climategate was the story that I helped to break..." See [[The Dennis Miller Show#The Dennis Miller Show 2|The Dennis Miller Show]]. (28 June 2011). "James Delingpole Interview". Event begins at 2:45.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the release of documents in the blogosphere, unproven allegations and personal attacks against scientists increased and made their way into the traditional media. Physicist [[Mark Boslough]] of the University of New Mexico noted that many of the attacks on scientists came from "bloggers, editorial writers, Fox News pundits, and radio talk show hosts who have called them liars and vilified them as frauds". According to [[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris Mooney]] and Sheril Kirshenbaum in their book ''[[Unscientific America]]'' (2010), the accusations originated in right-wing media and blogs, "especially on outlets like Fox News". Journalist [[Suzanne Goldenberg]] of ''The Guardian'' reported that according to an analysis by [[Media Matters for America|Media Matters]], "Fox had tried to delegitimise the work of climate scientists in its coverage of the hacked emails from the University of East Anglia" and had "displayed a pattern of trying to skew coverage in favour of the fringe minority which doubts the existence of climate change".&lt;ref name="Fox1"&gt;Mooney &amp; Kirshenbaum p. xi: "In the ensuing scandal after the e-mails became public, top climate scientists were accused of withholding information, suppressing dissent, manipulating data, and worse, particularly by right wing media and blogs. The controversy garnered dramatic press attention, especially on outlets like Fox News; and because Climategate occurred just before the critical United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, it knocked the whole event off rhythm in the media sphere." See: Mooney, Chris; Kirshenbaum, Sheril (2010) ''Unscientific America: How Scientific Illiteracy Threatens Our Future''. Basic Books. {{ISBN|0-465-01917-X}}; Boslough 2010: "As evidence for human-caused climate change has mounted, global warming denialists have responded by blaming the messengers. Climate researchers have endured abuse by bloggers, editorial writers, Fox News pundits, and radio talk show hosts who have called them liars and vilified them as frauds. The attacks had become increasingly vile as the past decade, the hottest in human history, came to an end. Angry activists have called for firings and criminal investigations, and some prominent scientists have received physical threats." Boslough, Mark (2010). "Mann bites dog: why 'climategate' was newsworthy". ''Skeptical Inquirer''. March–April. '''34''' (2): 14; Goldenberg 2010: "Journalists at Fox News were under orders to cast doubt on any on-air mention of climate change, a leaked email obtained by a media monitoring group revealed today. According to the email, obtained by Media Matters, Fox News's Washington bureau chief, Bill Sammon, imposed an order to make time for climate sceptics within 15 minutes of the airing of a story about a scientific report showing that 2000–2009 was on track to be the hottest decade on record. Media Matters said the bureau chief's response to the report exhibited a pattern of bias by Fox News in its coverage of climate change. It also noted the timing of the directive. The email went out on 8 December last year, when the leaders of nearly 200 countries met in Copenhagen to try to reach a deal on climate change...In addition to the email, it said Fox had tried to delegitimise the work of climate scientists in its coverage of the hacked emails from the University of East Anglia. The network had displayed a pattern of trying to skew coverage in favour of the fringe minority which doubts the existence of climate change, Media Matters said." See Goldenberg, Suzanne. (15 December 2010). "[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/15/fox-news-climate-change-email Fox News chief enforced climate change scepticism – leaked email]". ''guardian.co.uk''. Guardian News and Media Limited; In addition to the 24/7 news coverage, Fox News created a 17 minute documentary starring climate sceptic [[Patrick J. Michaels]]. See: [[Bret Baier|Baier, Bret]]. (2010) [http://www.cato.org/multimedia/video-highlights/patrick-j-michaels-discusses-climategate-fox-news-documentary Fox News Reporting: Global Warming...or a lot of Hot Air?] Fox News.&lt;/ref&gt;

The intense media coverage of the documents stolen from climate researchers at the University of East Anglia created public confusion about the scientific consensus on climate change, leading several publications to comment on the propagation of the controversy in the media in the wake of a series of investigations that cleared the scientists of any wrongdoing. In an editorial, ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the coverage as a "manufactured controversy" and expressed hope that the investigations clearing the scientists "will receive as much circulation as the original, diversionary controversies".&lt;ref name="TimesEditorial"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/opinion/11sun2.html?_r=1 | title = A Climate Change Corrective | date = 7 November 2010 | work=The New York Times | accessdate =11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Newsweek]]'', journalist [[Sharon Begley]] called the controversy a "highly orchestrated, manufactured scandal", noting that the public was unlikely to change their mind. Regardless of the reports exonerating the scientists, Begley noted that "one of the strongest, most-repeated findings in the psychology of belief is that once people have been told ''X'', especially if ''X'' is shocking, if they are later told, 'No, we were wrong about ''X'',' most people still believe ''X''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Newspapers retract Climategate claims but damage still done | series=The Gaggle blog|work=Newsweek | url = http://www.newsweek.com/blogs/the-gaggle/2010/06/25/newspapers-retract-climategate-claims-but-damage-still-done.html | date = 25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Pascal van Ypersele]], vice-chair of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) and science historian [[Naomi Oreskes]] said that the "attacks on climate science that were made ahead of the Copenhagen climate change summit were 'organised' to undermine efforts to tackle global warming and mirror the earlier tactics of the tobacco industry".&lt;ref&gt;Carrington, Damian (28 October 2010). "[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/28/ipcc-climate-science-attacks-tobacco?mobile-redirect=false IPCC vice-chair: Attacks on climate science echo tobacco industry tactics]". ''guardian.co.uk''. Retrieved 27 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Noting the [[media circus]] that occurred when the story first broke, Oreskes and Erik Conway writing about [[climate change denial]], said that following the investigations "the vindication of the climate scientists has received very little coverage at all. Vindication is not as sexy as accusation, and many people are still suspicious. After all, some of those emails, taken out of context, sounded damning. But what they show is that climate scientists are frustrated, because for two decades they have been under attack."&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Erik. Oreskes, Naomi (1 June 2010). "[http://www.newstatesman.com/global-issues/2010/05/climate-scientists-science Climate change denial: a history]". ''[[New Statesman]]''. Print version published 31 May 2010. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill Royce, head of the European practice on energy, environment and climate change at the United States communications firm [[Burson-Marsteller]], also described the incident as an organised effort to discredit climate science. He said that it was not a single scandal, but "a sustained and coordinated campaign" aimed at undermining the credibility of the science. Disproportionate reporting of the original story, "widely amplified by climate deniers", meant that the reports that cleared the scientists received far less coverage than the original allegations, he said.&lt;ref name="swissinfoch"&gt;Häne, Justin; Etienne Strebel (19 July 2010). [http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/specials/climate_change/news/Climate_scientists_still_trying_to_restore_trust.html?cid=17990364 "Climate scientists still trying to restore trust"]. ''[[swissinfo.ch]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Curtis Brainard of the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' criticised newspapers and magazines for failing to give prominent coverage to the findings of the review panels and said that "readers need to understand that while there is plenty of room to improve the research and communications process, its fundamental tenets remain as solid as ever".&lt;ref name="Brainard2010-07-07" /&gt; [[CNN]] media critic [[Howard Kurtz]] expressed similar sentiments.&lt;ref name="Brainard2010-07-13" /&gt;

==Public opinion and political fallout==
[[Jon Krosnick]], professor of communication, political science and psychology at [[Stanford University]], said that scientists were overreacting. Referring to his own poll results of the American public, he said: "It's another funny instance of scientists ignoring science." Krosnick found that "Very few professions enjoy the level of confidence from the public that scientists do, and those numbers haven't changed much in a decade. We don't see a lot of evidence that the general public in the United States is picking up on the (University of East Anglia) emails. It's too [[Inside baseball (metaphor)|inside baseball]]."&lt;ref name="krosnick_usatoday"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/columnist/vergano/2010-03-05-global-warming-doubt_N.htm "Some scientists misread poll data on global warming controversy"], 9 March 2010, Dan Vergano, ''USA Today''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', in an article titled "Climate scientists exonerated in 'climategate' but public trust damaged", stated: "While public opinion had steadily moved away from belief in man-made global warming before the leaked CRU emails, that trend has only accelerated."&lt;ref name="Jonsson"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2010/0707/Climate-scientists-exonerated-in-climategate-but-public-trust-damaged | title = * Climate scientists exonerated in 'climategate' but public trust damaged | last = Jonsson | first = Patrik | date = 7 July 2010 | work=The Christian Science Monitor | accessdate =12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Krugman]], columnist for ''The New York Times'', argued that this, along with all other incidents that called into question the scientific consensus on climate change, was "a fraud concocted by opponents of climate action, then bought into by many in the news media".&lt;ref name="Krugman2010-07-25" /&gt; But UK journalist [[Fred Pearce]] called the slow response of climate scientists "a case study in how not to respond to a crisis" and "a [[public relations]] disaster".&lt;ref&gt;[http://e360.yale.edu/content/feature.msp?id=2221 Climategate: Anatomy of A Public Relations Disaster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125131655/http://e360.yale.edu/content/feature.msp?id=2221 |date=25 November 2010 }} by Fred Pearce, ''Environment 360'' at [[Yale University]], 10 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A. A. Leiserowitz, Director of the [[Yale University]] Project on Climate Change, and colleagues found in 2010 that:&lt;ref name="Leiserowitz"&gt;Leiserowitz et al., 2010, "[http://environment.yale.edu/climate/publications/climategate-public-opinion-and-the-loss-of-trust/ Climategate, Public Opinion, and the Loss of Trust]". Working Paper, Subject to Revision. Yale University.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Climategate had a significant effect on public beliefs in global warming and trust in scientists. The loss of trust in scientists, however, was primarily among individuals with a strongly individualistic worldview or politically conservative ideology. Nonetheless, Americans overall continue to trust scientists more than other sources of information about global warming.}}

In late 2011, [[Steven F. Hayward]] wrote that "Climategate did for the global warming controversy what the [[Pentagon Papers]] did for the Vietnam war 40 years ago: It changed the narrative decisively."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/climategate-part-ii_610926.html Climategate (Part II)] by Steven F. Hayward, The ''[[Weekly Standard]]'', 11 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] said that many in the media "were led by the nose, by those with a clear agenda, to a sizzling scandal that steadily defused as the true facts and context were made clear".&lt;ref name="Nature2011-11"/&gt;

== Further release, 2011 ==
On 22 November 2011, a second set of approximately 5,000 emails, apparently hacked from University of East Anglia servers at the same time as those in the 2009 release, was posted on a Russian server, with links distributed to the message boards on several climate-sceptic websites.&lt;ref name=GLH/&gt; A message accompanying the emails quoted selective passages from them, highlighting many of the same issues raised following the original incident. Juliette Jowit and Leo Hickman of ''The Guardian'' said that the new release was "an apparent attempt to undermine public support for international action to tackle climate change" with the start of the 2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference scheduled in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]], a week later.&lt;ref name=GLH&gt;{{cite news | title = Climate scientists defend work in wake of new leak of hacked emails | url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/23/climate-scientists-hacked-emails-uea | accessdate =2 December 2011 | first = Juliette | last = Jowit | publisher = [[guardian.co.uk]] | location=London | date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TGraph-2011-1125"&gt;{{cite news | date = 25 November 2011 | title = Climategate II: the scientists fight back | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/8915689/Climategate-II-the-scientists-fight-back.html# | accessdate =2 December 2011 | newspaper = The Daily Telegraph | location=London | first=Geoffrey | last=Lean}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] described the further release as a "poor sequel" and claimed that "it is hard for anyone except the most committed conspiracy theorist to see much of interest in the content of the released e-mails, even taken out of context".&lt;ref name="Nature2011-11"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A poor sequel |journal=Nature |volume=480 |page=6 |date=December 2011 |doi=10.1038/480006a |issue=7375 |pmid=22129685|bibcode = 2011Natur.480....6. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |quote=Dr Pachauri told BBC Radio 4's The Report programme that the claims were serious and he wants them investigated. "We will certainly go into the whole lot and then we will take a position on it," he said. "We certainly don't want to brush anything under the carpet. This is a serious issue and we will look into it in detail. [...] Saudi Arabia's lead climate negotiator has said the email row will have a "huge impact" on next week's UN climate summit in Copenhagen. [...] Mohammad Al-Sabban told BBC News that he expects it to derail the single biggest objective of the summit&amp;nbsp;– to agree limitations on greenhouse gas emissions. [...] "It appears from the details of the scandal that there is no relationship whatsoever between human activities and climate change," he told BBC News."

Here is the quote: "''The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can't.''" It is amazing to see this particular quote lambasted so often. It stems from a paper I published this year bemoaning our inability to effectively monitor the energy flows associated with short-term climate variability. It is quite clear from the paper that I was not questioning the link between anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and warming, or even suggesting that recent temperatures are unusual in the context of short-term natural variability. The paper on this is available here...|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611224809/http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/Trenberth/statement.html|archivedate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2749">In measurement, the '''Coggeshall slide rule''', also called a '''carpenter's slide rule''', was a [[slide rule]] designed by [[Henry Coggeshall]] in 1677 to help in measuring the dimensions, surface area, and volume of [[timber]]. With his original design and later improvements, Coggeshall's slide rule brought the tool its first practical use outside of mathematical study. It would remain popular for the next few centuries.&lt;ref name="Oughtred"&gt;''[http://www.oughtred.org/history-new.shtml Slide Rule History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709072617/http://www.oughtred.org/history-new.shtml |date=July 9, 2007 }}''. The Oughtred Society. URL accessed 2006-06-09&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coggeshall rule consisted of two rulers, each a foot (30 cm) long, which were put together in various ways. The most common and convenient arrangement was to have one of the rulers slide within a groove made along the middle of the other, like an ordinary linear slide rule, as shown in the figure below. Another form had one ruler sliding alongside the other, and a third form had a common two-foot folding ruler with a groove along one side in which a thin sliding piece was inserted that carried Coggeshall's lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{1728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Coggeshall slide rule.jpg|center|550px|The most common form of a Coggeshall slide rule]]

Coggeshall first described this apparatus in a paper he released in London titled, "Timber-measure by a line of more ease, dispatch and exactness, then any other way now in use, by a double scale : after the countrey-measure, by the length and quarter of the circumference in round timber, and by the length and side of the square in squared timber, and square equal in flat timber : as also stone-measure and gauging of vessels by the same near and exact way, likewise a diagonal scale of 100 parts in a quarter of an inch, very easie both to make and use."&lt;ref name="Cajori"&gt;[[Cajori, Florian]]. ''[http://www.remanley.clara.net/cajori.doc History of the Logarithmic Sliding Rule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709165915/http://www.remanley.clara.net/cajori.doc |date=2006-07-09 }}." Colorado College. 1909. URL accessed 2006-06-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

After improving the design, he republished his work under the title "A Treatise of Measuring by a Two-foot Rule, which slides to a Foot" (1682). He released a highly modified version in 1722 titled "The Art of Practical Measuring easily performed by a Two-foot Rule which slides to a Foot." By 1767, seven revised editions had been released.&lt;ref name="Cajori"/&gt;

'''Confit''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɒ|n|f|i}}, {{IPA-fr|kɔ̃fi}}) comes from the [[French language|French]] word ''[[wikt:confire#French|confire]]'' which means literally "to preserve,"&lt;ref name="IP"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3RsgAQAAQBAJ | title=Irish Pantry: Traditional Breads, Preserves, and Goodies to Feed the Ones You Love | publisher=Running Press of the Perseus Books Group | author=McMeel, Noel | year=2013 | location=Orange-Onion Confit | pages=44 | isbn=0762445750}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaucer"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bts-AAAAYAAJ | title=Chaucer: The tale of the Man of Lawe, The Pardoneres Tale, The Second Nones Tale, The Chanouns Yemannes Tale | publisher=Macmiillan and Co. | author=Skeat, Walter William | authorlink=Walter William Skeat | year=1923 | pages=222 | isbn=1330317475}}&lt;/ref&gt; a confit being any type of food that is cooked slowly over a long period of time as a method of preservation.&lt;ref name="IP" /&gt; 

Confit as a cooking term describes when food is cooked in grease, oil or sugar water (syrup), at a lower temperature, as opposed to deep frying. While deep frying typically takes place at temperatures of {{convert|325|-|450|F|C|-1|order=flip}}, confit preparations are done at a much lower temperature, such as an oil temperature of around {{convert|200|F|C|-1|order=flip}}, sometimes even cooler. The term is usually used in modern cuisine to mean long slow cooking in oil or fat at low temperatures, many having no element of preservation such as dishes like confit potatoes.

In meat cooking, this requires the meat to be salted as part of the preservation process. After salting and cooking in the fat, sealed and stored in a cool, dark place, confit can last for several months or years. Confit is a specialty of southwestern [[France]].

==Etymology==
The word comes from the French verb ''confire'' (to preserve), which in turn comes from the [[Latin]] word (''conficere''), meaning "to do, to produce, to make, to prepare".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/confit|title=CONFIT : Etymologie de CONFIT|website=www.cnrtl.fr|language=fr|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French verb was first applied in medieval times to fruits cooked and preserved in sugar.

==Fruit confit==
Fruit confit are [[candied fruit]] (whole fruit, or pieces thereof) preserved in [[sugar]]. The fruit must be fully infused with sugar, to its core; larger fruit take considerably longer than smaller ones to candy. Thus, while small fruit such as [[cherry|cherries]] are ''confits'' whole, it is quite rare to see whole large fruit, such as [[melon]] ''confits'', since the time and energy involved in producing large ''fruit confits'' makes them quite expensive.

==Meat confit==
[[Image:MCB-duck-leg-confit.jpg|thumb|upright|Duck leg confit]]
[[Image:Fete Huma 2006 p1140018.jpg|thumb|Canned duck confit and [[cassoulet]]]]
Confit of [[goose]] (''confit d'oie'') and [[duck]] (''[[Duck confit|confit de canard]]'') are usually prepared from the legs of the bird. The meat is salted and seasoned with herbs, and slowly cooked submerged in its own rendered fat (never to exceed {{convert|85|C|F|disp=sqbr}}), in which it is then preserved by allowing it to cool and storing it in the fat. Turkey and pork may be treated in the same manner. Meat confit is a specialty of the southwest of France ([[Toulouse]], [[Dordogne]], etc.) and is used in dishes such as [[cassoulet]]. Confit preparations originated as a means of preserving meat without refrigeration.

In a restaurant context, confit is usually served after further preparation. Whole confit leg is baked to crisp the skin or added to a casserole type dish. Confit duck leg is used to make [[rillette]].

=== History ===
Traditional  meat for confit include both waterfowl such as goose and duck, and pork. Duck gizzards are also commonly cooked in the confit method. Varying forms of this delicacy thrive throughout southern France.

"Confit country" is the area of [[Occitania|Occitan]] France where goose fat is used to cook, as opposed to olive oil which is used in [[Provence]] where olives were plentiful and thus cheap.

Confit country is divided roughly into regions where one type of meat predominates the confit preparations. Goose confit is associated with the [[Béarn]] and [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] regions with their classic specialties of [[cassoulet]] and [[garbure]], hearty and earthy dishes of confit and beans. [[Saintonge]] and [[Brantôme,_Dordogne|Brantôme]] feature duck confit, often with potatoes and [[Tuber (genus)|truffle]]s. 

Non-waterfowl meats are frequently treated to the confit process, but they are not classically considered true confits. The French refer only to duck and goose confits as true confits; other meats poached in duck or goose fat are considered ''en confit'' ("in confit"). For example, chicken cooked in goose fat is called ''poulet en confit''.&lt;ref&gt;Plummer, Paul. ''Sensual Preservation: The Art of Confit''.&lt;/ref&gt; Pork is often confit and shredded to create rillettes.

==Condiment confit==
Italian cooking uses a number of "condiment confits," such as onion confit, chili confit, and garlic confit.

The term '''cordless''' is generally used to refer to electrical or electronic devices that are powered by a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[battery pack]] and can operate without a [[power cord]] or cable attached to an [[electrical outlet]] to provide [[mains power]], allowing greater mobility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordreference.com/definition/cordless Yahoo!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/cordless cordless: Definition and Much More from Answers.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cordless cordless - definition of cordless by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aceworkgear.com/blogpage/guide-to-cordless-drills Guide To Cordless Drills&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;    The development of more powerful [[Rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]] in recent years has allowed the production of battery-powered versions of tools and appliances that once required a power cord, and these are distinguished by the term "cordless", as in [[cordless drill]]s, cordless [[saw]]s, and [[cordless iron]]s.

The term "cordless" should not be confused with the term "[[wireless]]", although it often is in common usage, possibly because some cordless devices (e.g., [[cordless telephone]]s) are also wireless. The term "wireless" generally refers to devices that use some form of energy (e.g., [[radio]] waves, [[infrared]], [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]], etc.) to transfer ''[[information]]'' or ''commands'' over a distance without the use of communication [[wire]]s, regardless of whether the device gets its power from a power cord or a battery. The term "[[wikt:portable|portable]]" is an even more general term and, when referring to electrical and electronic devices, usually means devices which are totally self-contained (e.g., have built-in power supplies, have no base unit, etc.) and which may also use wireless technology.

'''ESSA-8''' was a [[weather satellite]] launched by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) on December 15, 1968, from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]], [[California]]. Its name was derived from that of its oversight agency, the [[Environmental Science Services Administration]] (ESSA).

ESSA-8 was an 18-sided polygon. It measured {{convert|42|in|cm}} in diameter by {{convert|22|in|cm}} in height, with a mass of {{convert|290|lb|kg|order=flip}}. It was made of [[aluminum]] alloy and [[stainless steel]] covered with 10,020 solar cells. The cells charged 63 [[nickel–cadmium battery|nickel–cadmium batteries]], which served as a power source. The satellite could take 8 to 10 pictures every 24 hours. Each photo covered a {{convert|2000|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} area at a resolution of {{convert|2|mi|km}} per pixel.

ESSA-8's mission was to replace [[ESSA-6]], and provide detailed cloud pattern photography to ground stations worldwide.  Partners in the project included NASA, ESSA, [[RCA]], the [[National Weather Service]], and the [[National Centers for Environmental Prediction]] (NMC).

ESSA-8 operated for 2,644 days until it was deactivated on March 12, 1976.

===Music===
After finding his lead actors, Lee Daniels set out to find a producer to craft the music for the series. Because he felt his own musical tastes and desires would be a little too dated for the show, Daniels consulted with people he thought could give him a little more insight, his children. At the urging of his son and daughter, Daniels contacted super producer [[Timbaland|Timothy "Timbaland" Mosley]], known for scoring hits with some of pop's biggest artists including [[Missy Elliott]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], [[Destiny's Child]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Nelly Furtado]], [[Ginuwine]] and [[Aaliyah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/category-songs_produced_by_timbaland.php|title=SONGS PRODUCED BY TIMBALAND|publisher=Songfacts.com|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As executive music Producer, Timbaland, co-songwriter/producer [[Jim Beanz]], and a team of other musical collaborators took their cues from the writing team, which gave them an idea of where the plot is headed, and craft songs to fit those themes. However, the musical aspect of the series is very reality based, unlike Fox's last musical series, ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', performances come with the organic development of the characters as artists, much like the performances featured in the ABC prime-time country musical drama ''[[Nashville (2012 TV series)|Nashville]]''.&lt;ref name=EWStack010715&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2015/01/07/empire-fox-lee-daniels/|title='Empire': Inside Fox's ambitious, groundbreaking musical soap|first=Tim|last=Stack|date=January 7, 2015|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alistarrecords.com/track/731526/what-the-dj-spins-from-empire?feature_id=157084&amp;trackship_id=833644 |title=What the DJ Spins (Empire) |publisher=Alistar Records |access-date=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any licensed songs and composer Fil Eisler's score are added after the episodes are filmed. The pilot itself consists of 12 songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/features/timbaland-gives-lee-daniels-empire-hip-hop-cred-1201393126/|title=Timbaland Gives Lee Daniels' 'Empire' Hip-Hop Cred|first=Melinda|last=Newman|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=January 6, 2015|accessdate=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Columbia Records]] releases weekly soundtracks of ''Empire'' on the [[iTunes Store]], the same strategy used with ''Glee''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/1860247/empire-tv-show-on-fox-empire-soundtrack-music-soars-on-itunes-ratings-break-records/ |title=‘EMPIRE’ TV SHOW ON FOX: ‘EMPIRE’ SOUNDTRACK MUSIC SOARS ON ITUNES, RATINGS BREAK RECORDS |last=Mooney |first=Paula |date=February 20, 2015|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2015, Fox announced that [[Ne-Yo]] and [[J.R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12373">The '''free-piston linear generator''' ('''FPLG'''), is a [[free-piston engine]] coupled with a [[linear alternator]]. It converts chemical energy from fuel into electric energy. Because of its versatility, low weight and good efficiency, it can be used in a wide range of applications, although it is of special interest to the mobility industry as [[Range extender (vehicle)|range extenders]] for electric vehicles.

== Description ==
The free-piston engine linear generators can be divided in 3 subsystems:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Der Freikolbenlineargenerator - Theoretische Betrachtungen des Gesamtsystems und experimentelle Untersuchungen zum Teilsystem der Gasfeder|last = Pohl|first = Sven-Erik|publisher = Helmut-Schmidt-Universität|year = 2007|isbn = |location = Hamburg|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Entwicklung und Untersuchung eines Freikolbenlineargenerators unter besonderer Berücksichtigung des verbrennungsmotorischen Teilsystems mit Hilfe eines neuartigen vollvariablen Prüfstands|last = Ferrari|first = Cornelius|publisher = Universität Stuttgart|year = 2012|isbn = |location = Stuttgart|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* One (or more) combustion chamber with a single or two opposite pistons
* One (or more) linear electric generator, which is composed of a static part (the stator) and a moving part (the magnets) connected to the connection rod.
* One (or more) return unit to push the piston back due the lack of the crankshaft (typically a gas spring or an opposed combustion chamber)
The FPLG has many potential advantages compared to traditional electric generator powered by an internal combustion engine. One of the main advantages of the FPLG comes from the absence of [[crankshaft]]. It leads to a smaller and lighter engine with fewer parts. This also allows a variable [[compression ratio]], which makes it possible to design an engine that works ideally with different kinds of fuel.

The linear generator also allows the control of the resistance force, and therefore a better control of the piston's movement and of the combustion. The total efficiency (including engine and generator) of free-piston linear generators is around 40%,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Sven-Erik Pohl: ''Der Freikolbenlineargenerator - Theoretische Betrachtungen des Gesamtsystems und experimentelle Untersuchungen zum Teilsystem der Gasfeder'', Helmut-Schmidt-Universität, Hamburg, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Cornelius Ferrari: ''Entwicklung und Untersuchung eines Freikolbenlineargenerators unter besonderer Berücksichtigung des verbrennungsmotorischen Teilsystems mit Hilfe eines neuartigen vollvariablen Prüfstands'', Universität Stuttgart, Stuttgart 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.digitaltrends.com/features/road-rave-free-piston-engines-power-next-plug-hybrid/|title = Why ‘Free Piston’ engines could power your next plug-in hybrid|date = 2015|website = Road Rave|publisher = Digital Trends|last = Braun|first = Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing a significant improvement compared to conventional combustion engines, which reach about 20% under typical US driving conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://courses.washington.edu/me341/oct22v2.htm|title = Improving IC Engine Efficiency|date = |website = Courses.washington.edu|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is a variety of names and abbreviations for the technology, the terms "Free-piston linear generator" and "FPLG" particularly refer to the project at German Aerospace Center.

== Operation ==
The free-piston linear generator generally consists of three subsystems: combustion chamber, linear generator and return unit (normally a gas spring), which are coupled through a connecting rod.

In the combustion chamber, a mixture of fuel and air is ignited, increasing the pressure and forcing the moving parts (connection rod, linear generator and pistons) in the direction of the gas spring. The gas spring is compressed, and, while the piston is near the [[bottom dead centre|bottom dead center]] (BDC), fresh air and fuel are injected into the combustion chamber, expelling the exhaust gases.

The gas spring pushes the moving parts assembly back to the [[top dead center]] (TDC), compressing the mixture of air and fuel that was injected and the cycle repeats. This works in a similar manner to the [[two-stroke engine]], however it is not the only possible configuration.

The linear generator can generate a force opposed to the motion, not only during expansion but also during compression. The magnitude and the force profile affect the piston movement, as well as the overall efficiency.

== Variations ==

The FPLG has been conceived in many different configurations, but for most applications, particularly for the automotive industry, focus has been on two opposed pistons in the same cylinder with one combustion chamber with a gas spring at the end of each cylinder. This balances out the forces in order to reduce vibration and noise. In the simplest case, a second unit is just a mirror of the first, with no functional connection to the first. Alternatively, a single combustion chamber or gas spring can be used, allowing for a more compact design and easier synchronization between the pistons.

The gas spring and combustion chamber can be placed on the ends of the connection rods, or they to share the same piston, using opposite sides in order to reduce space.

The linear generator itself has also many different configurations and forms. It can be designed as round tube, a cylinder or even flat plate in order to reduce the center of gravity, and/or improve the heat dissipation.

The free-piston linear generator's great versatility comes from the absence of a crankshaft, removing a great pumping loss, giving the engine a further degree of freedom. The combustion can be [[two-stroke engine]] or [[four-stroke engine]]. However, a four-stroke requires a much higher intermediate storage of energy, the rotational inertia of the crankshaft, to propel the piston through the four strokes. With the absence of a crankshaft, a gas spring would need to power the piston through the intake, compression and exhaustion stokes. Hence the reason why most of the current research focuses on the two-strokes cycle.

Several variations are possible for combustion:
* Spark Ignition ([[Spark-Ignition|Otto]])
* Compression Ignition ([[Compression-ignition engine|Diesel]])
* Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition ([[HCCI]] ignition)

== The DLR research ==

The Institute of Vehicle Concepts of the [[German Aerospace Center]] is currently developing a FPLG (or Freikolbenlineargenerator - FKLG) since 2002, and has published several papers about this subject.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Free Piston Linear Generator - Development of an Innovative, Compact, Highly Efficient Range-Extender Module|author1=Kock, F. |author2=Haag, J. |author3= Friedrich, H. |last-author-amp=yes |publisher = SAE International|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Steuerung und Regelung des Freikolbenlineargenerators - Entwicklungsmethode und Regelungskonzept für den Betrieb eines neuartigen Energiewandlers|last = Kock|first = F.|publisher = Deutsche Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt|year = 2015|isbn = |location = Stuttgart|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first few years of research, the theoretical background along with the 3 subsystems were developed separately. In 2013, the first entire system was built and operated successfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.greencarcongress.com/2013/02/dlr-20120220.html|title = DLR team develops demonstrator of free-piston linear generator as range extender for EVs|date = 2013-02-20|accessdate = |website = Green Car Congress|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The German center is currently into its 2nd version of the entire system, on which two opposed cylinders will be used in order to reduce vibration and noise, making it viable for the automotive industry.

The '''Function-Behaviour-Structure ontology''' – or short, the FBS ontology – is an [[ontology (information science)|ontology]] of design objects, i.e. things that have been or can be [[design]]ed. The Function-Behaviour-Structure ontology conceptualizes design objects in three ontological categories: function (F), behaviour (B), and structure (S). The FBS ontology has been used in [[design science]] as a basis for modelling the process of designing as a set of distinct activities. This article relates to the concepts and models proposed by John S. Gero and his collaborators. Similar ideas have been developed independently by other researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Umeda et al. (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekaran and Josephson (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bhatta and Goel (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ontological categories composing the Function-Behaviour-Structure ontology are defined as follows:&lt;ref name="GeroKannengiesser"&gt;Gero and Kannengiesser (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GeroKannengiesser_b"&gt;Gero and Kannengiesser (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Function'' (F): the [[teleology]] (purpose) of the design object. For example, the functions of a [[turbocharger]] include increasing the power output of an engine, providing reliability, and providing affordability.
* ''Behaviour'' (B): the attributes that can be derived from the design object’s structure. For example, the behaviour of a turbocharger includes attributes such as [[Airflow|air mass flow]], efficiency ratio, thermal strength, and weight.
* ''Structure'' (S): the components of the design object and their relationships. In the turbocharger example, structure includes the turbocharger components ([[Centrifugal compressor|compressor]], [[Radial turbine|turbine]], shaft, etc.) and their spatial dimensions, interconnections and materials.
The three ontological categories are interconnected: Function is connected with behaviour, and behaviour is connected with structure. There is no connection between function and structure.

== Ontological Models of Designing ==
The Function-Behaviour-Structure ontology is the basis for two frameworks of designing: the FBS framework, and its extension, the situated FBS framework. They represent the process of designing as transformations between function, behaviour and structure, and subclasses thereof.

=== The Function-Behaviour-Structure Framework ===
The original version of the FBS framework was published by John S. Gero in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Gero (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; It applies the FBS ontology to the process of designing, by further articulating the three ontological categories. In this articulation, behaviour (B) is specialised into ''expected behaviour'' (Be) (the "desired" behaviour) and ''behaviour derived from structure'' (Bs) (the "actual" behaviour). In addition, two further notions are introduced on top of the existing ontological categories: ''requirements'' (R) that represent intentions from the client that come from outside the designer, and ''description'' (D) that represents a depiction of the design created by the designer. Based on these articulations, the FBS framework proposes eight processes claimed as fundamental in designing,&lt;ref name="GeroKannengiesser" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GeroKannengiesser_a"&gt;Gero and Kannengiesser (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; specifically:

[[File:The Function-Behaviour-Structure Framework.png|thumb|alt=Image showing the Function-Behaviour-Structure Framework.|The Function-Behaviour-Structure Framework]]

# '''Formulation''': formulates the problem space, by transforming requirements into a function [[state space]] (R → F), and transforming functions into a behaviour state space (F → Be).
# '''Synthesis''': generates structure based on expectations of the behaviour state space (Be → S).
# '''Analysis''': derives behaviour from the generated structure (S → Bs).
# '''Evaluation''': compares expected behaviour with the behaviour derived from structure (Be ↔ Bs).
# '''Documentation''': produces descriptions of the design based on structure (S → D).
# '''Reformulation type 1''': modifies the structure state space, based on a re-interpretation of structure (S → S’).
# '''Reformulation type 2''': modifies the behaviour state space, based on a re-interpretation of structure (S → Be’).
# '''Reformulation type 3''': modifies the function state space, based on a re-interpretation of structure and subsequent reformulation of expected behaviour (S → F’ via Be).

==== Example ====
The eight fundamental processes in the FBS framework are illustrated using a turbocharger design process.

# Formulation: External requirements (R) for a turbocharger are interpreted by the designer as functions (F) including to increase the power output of an engine. A set of behaviours (Be) is then produced that are expected to achieve this function. They include the air mass flow and efficiency ratios for a range of engine speeds.
# Synthesis: Based on the expected behaviours (Be), a structure (S) is produced that includes components such as a compressor, a turbine, a core assembly, a shaft, and their interconnections. It also includes their geometry and materials.
# Analysis: After the structure (S) is produced, the "actual" behaviours (Bs) can be derived based on that structure. This may include the physical testing of prototypes (e.g. for measuring air mass flow), and computational simulations (e.g. for calculating thermal behaviours).
# Evaluation: The "actual" behaviours (Bs) of the turbocharger are compared against the expected behaviours (Be), to assess whether the current turbocharger design performs as required.
# Documentation: The turbocharger design is documented by generating a description (D), commonly a [[Computer-aided design|CAD model]], based on the structure (S).
# Reformulation type 1: The designer modifies the space of possible design structures (S) by including a new component such as a variable sliding ring inside the turbine.
# Reformulation type 2: The designer modifies the space of expected behaviours (Be) by introducing a new control behaviour that allows varying the air mass flow. This is a consequence of introducing the variable sliding ring into the design structure (S).
# Reformulation type 3: The designer modifies the function space (F) by adapting it to serve the needs of an engine with increased exhaust temperature. This is based on the discovery of a high thermal strength (Be) of existing design materials (S).

=== The Situated Function-Behaviour-Structure Framework ===
The situated FBS framework was developed by John S. Gero and Udo Kannengiesser in 2000&lt;ref name="GeroKannengiesser_a" /&gt; as an extension of the FBS framework to explicitly capture the role of [[situated cognition]] or situatedness in designing.&lt;ref name="Schon"&gt;Schön (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clancey (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Situatedness ====
The basic assumption underpinning the situated FBS framework is that designing involves interactions between three worlds: the external world, the interpreted world and the expected world. They are defined as follows:&lt;ref name="GeroKannengiesser" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GeroKannengiesser_b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GeroKannengiesser_a" /&gt;
* ''External world'': contains things in the “outside” world (for example, in the physical environment of the designer)
* ''Interpreted world'': contains experiences, percepts and concepts, formed by the designer’s interactions with the external world
* ''Expected world'': contains expectations of the results of the designer’s actions, driven by goals and hypotheses about the current state of the world

The three worlds are interconnected by four classes of interaction:
* ''Interpretation'': transforms variables sensed in the external world into variables within the interpreted world
* ''Focussing'': selects subsets of variables in the interpreted world and uses them as goals in the expected world
* ''Action'': changes the external world according to the goals and hypotheses composing the expected world
* ''Constructive memory'': produces memories as a result of re-interpreting past experiences. It is based on a constructivist model of human memory.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey (1896)&lt;/ref&gt; in which new memories are generated by reflection&lt;ref name="Schon" /&gt;

==== Situatedness and FBS Combined ====
The situated FBS framework is a result of merging the three-world model of situatedness with the original FBS framework, by specialising the ontological categories as follows:&lt;ref name="GeroKannengiesser" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GeroKannengiesser_b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GeroKannengiesser_a" /&gt;

{|
|-
| valign="top" |
* Fe&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;: expected function
* F&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;: interpreted function
* F&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;: external function
* FR&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;: external requirements on function
| valign="top" |
* Be&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;: expected behaviour
* B&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;: interpreted behaviour
* B&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;: external behaviour
* BR&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;: external requirements on behaviour
| valign="top" |
* Se&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;: expected structure
* S&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;: interpreted structure
* S&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;: external structure
* SR&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;: external requirements on structure
|}

[[File:The Situated Function-Behaviour-Structure Framework.png|thumb|alt=Image showing the situated Function-Behaviour-Structure Framework.|The Situated Function-Behaviour-Structure Framework]]

20 processes connect these specialised ontological categories. They elaborate and extend the eight fundamental processes in the FBS framework, providing more descriptive power with regards to the situatedness of designing.

# '''Formulation''': generates a design state space in terms of a function state space (process 7 in the image showing the situated Function-Behaviour-Structure Framework), a behaviour state space (processes 8 and 10), and a structure state space (process 9). It is based on the interpretation of external requirements on function (process 1), behaviour (process 2), and structure (process 3), and on the construction of memories of function (process 4), behaviour (process 5), and structure (process 6).
# '''Synthesis''': produces a design solution that is a point in the structure state space (process 11) and an external representation of that solution (process 12).
# '''Analysis''': interprets the synthesised structure (process 13) and derives behaviour from that structure (process 14).
# '''Evaluation''': compares the expected behaviour with the interpreted behaviour (process 15).
# '''Documentation''': produces an external representation of the design, which may be in terms of structure (process 12), behaviour (process 17) and function (process 18).
# '''Reformulation type 1''': generates a new or modified structure state space (process 9). Potential drivers of this reformulation include processes 3, 6 and 13.
# '''Reformulation type 2''': generates a new or modified behaviour state space (process 8). Potential drivers of this reformulation include processes 2, 5, 14 and 19.
# '''Reformulation type 3''': generates a new or modified function state space (process 7). Potential drivers of this reformulation include processes 1, 4, 16 and 20.

== Applications ==
The FBS ontology has been used as a basis for modelling designs (the results of designing) and design processes (the activities of designing) in a number of design disciplines, including engineering design, architecture, construction and software design.&lt;ref&gt;Deng (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christophe et al. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clayton et al. (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kruchten (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard et al. (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yan (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colombo et al. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; While the FBS ontology has been discussed in terms of its completeness,&lt;ref&gt;Galle (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorst and Vermaas (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vermaas and Dorst (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; several research groups have extended it to fit the needs of their specific domains.&lt;ref&gt;Cascini et al. (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uflacker and Zeier (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cebrian-Tarrason et al. (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gu et al. (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eichhoff and Maass (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russo et al. (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Begoli, PRS-ABA, ABA Ontology"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Begoli|first1=Edmon|title=Procedural-Reasoning Architecture for Applied Behavior Analysis-based Instructions|date=May 2014|publisher=University of Tennessee, Knoxville|location=Knoxville, Tennessee, USA|pages=44-79|edition=1|url=http://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/2749|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has also been used as a schema for coding and [[Protocol analysis| analysing behavioural studies]] of designers.&lt;ref&gt;Jiang (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kan (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kan and Gero (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNeill (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lammi (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6981">The '''Governance Interoperability Framework''' (GIF) is an open, standards-based specification and set of technologies that describes and promotes interoperability among components of a [[service-oriented architecture]] (SOA). GIF integrates SOA ecosystem technologies to achieve heterogeneous service lifecycle governance and is supported by [[Hewlett-Packard|Hewlett-Packard Company]] and by GIF partners.

== SOA Governance and creating a system-of-record ==

[[SOA Governance|Governance]] is recognized as a foundational requirement for successful enterprise adoption of SOA: Gartner has stated that “governance isn’t an option but an imperative”, and predicts that the dominant mode of SOA project failure will be a lack of adequate governance.&lt;ref&gt;Paolo Malinverno, Gartner Research  Service-Oriented Architecture Craves Governance, January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary products used by most organizations to achieve SOA governance are based on an integrated registry-repository, and provide support for managing and communication information in an SOA as well as automating key governance activities.&lt;ref&gt;Philip J. Windley, [http://akamai.infoworld.com/pdf/special_report/2006/04SRsoagov.pdf SOA Governance: Rules of the Game] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724200254/http://akamai.infoworld.com/pdf/special_report/2006/04SRsoagov.pdf |date=2008-07-24 }}, InfoWorld.com, 23 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These SOA governance systems provide a central system-of-record for all services and related information in an SOA, and are the place where services can be advertised by providers and discovered by consumers. As such, they act as a key control point for governing service availability, versioning, service lifecycle management, and for ensuring compliance with business and technical policies.

To be effective, SOA governance systems need a mechanism for exchanging information between all the disparate technologies that support an SOA. Interoperability is a fundamental requirement for the visibility, trust and control required for effective SOA governance.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Kenney, Daryl Plummer, Magic Quadrant for Integrated SOA Governance Technology Sets, 2007, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of GIF is to drive interoperability through the adoption of standards and common approaches to modeling and exchanging information.

== GIF Overview ==

GIF represents a collection of [[API]]s defined by standards organizations, data mappings and classifications and leverages [[UDDI]] and [[WS-Policy]] standards, among others, as building blocks. In order to promote commonality of approaches and understanding of the information represented, GIF also defines vocabularies for the purpose of applying [[metadata]] to service information.

Integration with the Governance Interoperability Framework is based on two primary pillars of integration: Control Integration and Service Data Integration. These themes are based on the famed [[Model-View-Controller]] (MVC) pattern:

'''Control integration''' - Consists of alerting and notification integration; launching events and actions; and integration of business service governance and lifecycle.

'''Data integration''' - Consists of leveraging the Business Service Registry as the primary service description, characteristic, and policy catalog.

GIF provides control and data integration needed to support activities such as the governance of business service provisioning and lifecycle management. Aspects of this are:

'''Provisioning integration''' - Leverage the SOA governance system as part of the provisioning and deployment process of business services.  Once integrated, bi-directional exchange of service information between participants is enabled.

'''Deployment integration''' - Upon deployment of services, any party should have the ability to alert others to the existence of the service and the need to put the service and its definitions under management.

'''Lifecycle management''' - Lifecycle management of all facets of a business service is required. This means collaborating and integrating components for the purpose of managing:
* service and artifact versioning
* lifecycle information (e.g. development, test, production, deprecated)
* lifecycle status and state of the service (availability)
* deployment information including up-time, first deployed date, last deployment date
* contact and support information about the service or template (owner, responsible organization, support contact, manager, etc.)
* compliance status
* dependencies and relationships between:
** services – those dependencies that the partner creates partner
** proxies and the services they proxy
** services consumed by another service

GIF has been driven by several use cases, including:

* SOA governance system acting as the authoritative source of service descriptions and metadata to other components of an SOA ecosystem.
* SOA governance system as the recipient of service descriptions, metadata and policy information, including but not limited to publishing service descriptions (typically [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]] documents and associated metadata) and lifecycle information.
* Publish service characteristics to the SOA governance system to enable the searching and reporting of services and their artifacts. This may include publishing performance data, historical trends and other facets of service information such as constraints and capabilities of the service.
*Make service characteristics, such as configuration, constraints and capabilities typically expressed as policy, discoverable.
*Publishing and making available protocol and binding information, such as the WSDLs of proxied services by security or management partners, and their associated business service (functional) WSDLs.

== GIF organization and membership ==

GIF is not a standard itself, but rather leverages existing standards to support SOA governance interoperability. GIF is supported by [http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/ Hewlett-Packard Company] and by GIF partners.

Group technology is based on a general principle that many problems are similar and by grouping similar problems, a single solution can be found to a set of problems, thus saving time and effort.

The group of similar parts is known as '''part family''' and the group of [[machineries]] used to process an individual part family is known as '''machine cell'''. It is not necessary for each part of a part family to be processed by every machine of corresponding machine cell. This type of manufacturing in which a part family is produced by a machine cell is known as [[cellular manufacturing]]. 
The manufacturing efficiencies are generally increased by employing GT because the required operations may be confined to only a small cell and thus avoiding the need for transportation of in-process parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition from All Data Labs|url=http://www.alldatalabs.com |publisher=www.alldatalabs.com|accessdate=1 Jan 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Group technology is an approach in which similar parts are identified and grouped together in order to take advantage of the similarities in design and production. Similarities among parts permit them to be classified into part families.

The advantage of GT can be divided into three '''groups''':
# Engineering
# Manufacturing
# Process Planning

Disadvantages of GT Manufacturing :

#Involves less manufacturing flexibility
#Increases the machine down time as machines are grouped as cells which may not be functional throughout the production process.

'''''Hell's Kitchen''''' is an American [[reality competition]] [[television series]] based on the British [[Hell's Kitchen (UK TV series)|series of the same name]]. Broadcast on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], it is hosted by [[celebrity chef]] [[Gordon Ramsay]]. Two teams of chefs compete for a job as head chef at a restaurant.

A typical episode begins with a challenge between the teams; the winning team gets some sort of a reward that usually involves some sort of recreational activity outside the Hell's Kitchen, while the losers are given a "punishment" that usually involves some sort of menial task.

The second part is a dinner service, where each team works in their own kitchen, attempting, under close and hypercritical supervision from Chef Ramsay, to complete the service without getting kicked out before finishing for too many errors.

The usual wrap-up involves whichever team is declared the loser of the dinner service choosing two of their own to be up for elimination.

There are many possible variations; both teams being kicked out before the end of dinner service is an example that has occurred on several occasions.

On September 9, 2016, Fox renewed ''Hell's Kitchen'' for seasons 17 and 18. The seventeenth season, titled ''All-Stars'', premiered on September 29, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gelman|first1=Vlad|title=TVLine Items: Hell's Kitchen Renewed, PLL Vet to Hunt Supernatural and More|url=http://tvline.com/2016/09/09/hells-kitchen-renewed-season-17-18-fox/|website=Variety|publisher=Littleton, Cynthia|accessdate=September 9, 2016|date=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eighteenth season, titled ''Rookies vs. Veterans'', premiered on September 28, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hell's Kitchen on Twitter: "Tensions will boil over when an all-new season of #HellsKitchen premieres September 28 on @FOXTV. 🌡..."|url=https://twitter.com/HellsKitchenFOX/status/1012389269254520832|publisher=Hell's Kitchen Twitter|date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hell's Kitchen on Twitter: "Enter the inferno with a brand-new season of #HellsKitchen premiering September 28 on @FOXTV. 🔥..."|url=https://twitter.com/HellsKitchenFOX/status/1027638142847700992|publisher=Hell's Kitchen Twitter|date=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format ==

''Hell's Kitchen'' is a reality television show that uses a progressive elimination format to narrow down a field of 12 to 20 aspiring chefs to a single winner over the course of one season. The U.S. version of ''Hell's Kitchen'' follows the format of the UK version though the show is recorded and not performed live, nor is there audience participation in the elimination of chefs. The show is produced at Hell's Kitchen, a modified warehouse in Los Angeles that includes the restaurant, dual kitchen facilities and a dormitory where the chefs reside while on the show. They are also given knife sets that they get to keep, regardless of their progress.{{sfn|Perkins, Jr.|2011|p = 7}}

At the start of each season, [[Gordon Ramsay]] breaks the chefs into two teams. With the exception of the [[Hell's Kitchen (U.S. season 1)|first]] and [[Hell's Kitchen (U.S. season 18)|most recent]] seasons, this puts women on the red team and men on the blue team; each is given a chef's jacket with panels of that color on the shoulders. The chefs remain on these teams throughout most of the competition; Ramsay may reassign a chef to the other team if the team numbers are uneven or if he feels the chef will perform better on the other team. Each episode typically includes a challenge and a dinner service, followed by the elimination of a chef. When only five or six chefs remain, they are brought into a single common team wearing black-panelled jackets. From this point onward, they compete individually to be one of the final two.

=== Challenges ===

In challenges, the teams or individual is tasked with a cooking challenge by Ramsay. The type of challenges are varied, including ingredient preparation, meal preparation and taste tests. The first challenge of each season is a [[signature dish]] cook-off, giving the chefs an opportunity to show Ramsay their cooking.

Each season typically includes one or more challenges that allows teams to construct several dishes either for a banquet to be held the next dinner service or as part of designing their own menus. Other challenges typically include a "taste it, now make it" task, where chefs must attempt to recreate a dish Ramsay has prepared after tasting it only, and a "blind taste-test" where chefs identify ingredients while blindfolded and wearing sound-blocking earcovers. Some challenges have been full breakfast or lunch services, where the team completing the service first is declared the winner.

The winner of the challenge is determined by either a scoring system set for that challenge or by Ramsay's and/or guest judges' opinions. The winning team or chef receives a reward (a recreational activity away from Hell's Kitchen and other potential prizes), while the losing team or chefs are forced to do a mundane task, such as cleaning the kitchens, preparing a specific ingredient for the following dinner, having to prepare the food for both kitchens, and sometimes eating something unsavory (such as food waste blended into a smoothie) for lunch.

=== Dinner service ===

For dinner services, the chefs are expected to work their station (such as appetizers, meat, fish, or garnish) on the kitchen line to prepare food in coordination with their teammates and to Ramsay's high standards for quality and presentation. Dinner service is for about 100 guests (volunteers for the show), with each diner expecting to receive an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert. The chefs are given menus and recipe books by Ramsay to study and memorize, which include some of Ramsay's more difficult dishes including [[risotto]] and [[Beef Wellington]]. The chefs spend several hours before each service preparing their ingredients.

Menus may be customized for a specific dinner service, such as ethnic-themed dishes or plates that resulted from the earlier challenge. Some seasons feature a service allowing for the teams to develop their own menus, which are reviewed by Ramsay for quality and presentation beforehand. Later seasons may feature a private dinner service, where each team must serve a five course meal to 12 guests, with each member leading their teammates to prepare one course. Dinner services may include additional challenges. A chef from each team may be asked to serve a table-side meal for their team, serve celebrities sitting at the kitchen's [[Restaurant#Chef's table|chef's table]], or act as a server for the evening taking and fulfilling orders. After the chefs are on a single black team, Ramsay will use one dinner service to ask each chef to run the pass to test their quality control, including deliberate mistakes made by the sous chefs or Ramsay himself.

During a service, Ramsay demands that all orders for each course for a table go out together, and will send back entire orders if one item is improperly prepared, such as being over- or undercooked or not [[seasoning|seasoned]] correctly. While the chefs are in two teams, Ramsay is assisted by two trusted sous-chefs, each monitoring one of the kitchens, demanding the same standards and alerting Ramsay to any issues. Ramsay's goal is to complete every dinner service, but exceptionally poor kitchen performance by one or both teams will cause him to close one (or both sides) of the kitchen early and send the team(s) back to the dorms. Ramsay may also evict individual chefs from the kitchen based on repeated poor performances during a service, and on rare occasions (once every two seasons on average), may eliminate a chef on the spot.

=== Elimination ===

Once the dinner service is complete, Ramsay gathers everyone in the kitchen, announces which team is the losing team, and directs them to select two chefs from their team as nominees for elimination. Often, both teams are declared losers, or a different number of chefs may be requested for nomination. In some cases, Ramsay has named both teams winners, but still requires both teams to nominate someone for elimination. This is a group consensus, but Ramsay may occasionally name a chef "best of the worst" on their team and instruct them to choose the nominees. This concept, however, has faded away over time due to the "best of the worst" sometimes making nominations based on personal bias rather than kitchen performance. Ramsay has also on some occasions declared that nobody would be sent home, but those cases are generally followed by a double-elimination, a team reassignment, or occur after someone has been sent home immediately due to malfeasance.

Ramsay reassembles the teams in the dining hall and hears out the nominations from the losing team(s). Ramsay may also nominate other chefs for elimination if he believes it appropriate. After giving these nominees the chance to defend themselves, Ramsay selects one to hand over their jacket and "leave Hell's Kitchen." On rarer occasions, Ramsay can overrule nominations or even eliminate a chef who has not been nominated, even a chef on a winning team.

The eliminated chef is shown leaving the restaurant, providing some last thoughts on the experience. After dismissing the chefs, Ramsay goes back upstairs to his office. He symbolically hangs the chef's jacket on a sharp hook below their picture in a row with the others, igniting the chef's picture and signaling their departure. During this scene, there is a voiceover of Ramsay explaining his reasons for eliminating the chef. If an eliminated chef has performed exceptionally well, Ramsay may allow them to keep their jacket as a token of their success up to that point, if he sees fit.

Chefs may be eliminated from the competition due to medical reasons, both voluntarily and involuntarily. Chefs that violate the competition's rules may be immediately eliminated. Chefs may also exit the competition voluntarily for any other reason; though this is not encouraged, their wishes are ultimately granted (with reasons by Ramsay explained, if applicable).

Once the number of chefs drops below a certain level (usually once 5 or 6 are left) they are awarded black jackets and assembled into a single team. Eliminations continue until two are left.

=== Final service ===

In the finale, the final two chefs are each given the opportunity to develop their own menus and lead a brigade of former competitors through a full dinner service on their own. In the first five seasons, this included the opportunity to decorate half of the Hell's Kitchen restaurant to their liking. Prior to the dinner service, the two chefs compete in a challenge to prepare their menus, and the winner will earn the advantage of picking their brigade of chefs first. Ramsay will ensure that all menu items meet his standards for high cuisine prior to service, and he and his sous chefs will oversee the service to make sure that his high quality standards are retained, but does not otherwise get involved, allowing the two remaining chefs to demonstrate their ability to run the line. The finalists are allowed to reassign stations, or even kick their teammates out of the kitchen should they see fit; the latter has happened four times in the show's history.

Ramsay uses his own observations and those from the diners and other sources to decide who is the winning chef. He has two doors in his office leading out to the balcony above the Hell's Kitchen seating area. Each chef stands at a door and Ramsay tells them to both turn their handles at the same time. After a commercial break, only the door of the winning chef is unlocked allowing the winner to walk through and be greeted by the crowd below. The winning chef receives two prizes including the opportunity to work as the head chef or executive chef at a restaurant of Ramsay's choosing, as well as a cash prize of $250,000.{{sfn|Perkins, Jr.|2011|p = 5}} In a similar manner to the voiceover at each elimination, Ramsay has a voiceover to explain his reasons for choosing that chef as the winner.

Gordon Ramsay is the head chef. Jason Thompson is the narrator. [[Jean-Philippe Susilovic]], a Belgian [[maître d'hôtel]], comes from Petrus, one of Ramsay's London restaurants and appeared in the first seven seasons and later returned for Season 11. He left after Season 12 and was replaced by Marino Monferrato for Season 13. Susilovic was also the [[maître d'hôtel]] for the first series of the original British version. James Lukanik replaced Susilovic for Seasons 8–10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/bios/staff/james-lukanik|title=James Lukanik – Hell's Kitchen on FOX|work=FOX Broadcasting Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each team also has the services of one of two [[sous-chef]]s. The current sous-chefs are Season 10 winner Christina Wilson and James "Jocky" Petrie. Previous sous-chefs were Mary Ann Salcedo, Gloria Felix, Season 2 winner Heather West, [[Scott Leibfried]], James Avery, Aaron Mitrano and Andi Van Willigan. In Season 15, Wilson filled in for Van Willigan-Cutspec who was getting married at the time of filming but returned for one episode when her reception was one of the themed dinner services for that season. Van-Willigan returned in season 16 but was replaced by Wilson again for Seasons 17 and 18 to spend time with her infant son.

== Production ==

=== Broadcasting ===

The theme song is ''[[Fire (Ohio Players song)|Fire]]'' by the [[Ohio Players]]. When the U.S. version is broadcast in the U.K., Italy, Portugal and some countries (shown on the table below), it features only the instrumental version. The instrumental version also appeared in the uncensored DVD release for the U.S. version.

=== Setting ===

For the show's first two seasons, the ''Hell's Kitchen'' restaurant set itself was housed in the former studios of Los Angeles television station [[KCOP]] at 915 North La Brea Avenue, in Hollywood, which at one time hosted production of game shows  ''[[Tic Tac Dough]]'' and ''[[The Joker's Wild]]''.&lt;ref name="realitytvcalendar"&gt;Reality TV Calendar. June 3, 2007. "Hell's Kitchen&amp;nbsp;— Everything You Want To Know".[http://www.realitytvcalendar.com/shows/hk3/preseason/allabout-8921.html]&lt;/ref&gt; KCOP was acquired by [[News Corporation]] in 2001 and its studios were integrated with those of Fox affiliate [[KTTV]] in 2003, leaving the La Brea facility vacant.&lt;ref name="labizjournalstudio"&gt;Latzman, Darrell. ''Los Angeles Business Journal''. June 30, 2003. "KCOP studio sale is latest chapter in duopoly shifting. (Up Front).(Fox Broadcasting puts television studio facility up for sale)".[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-105476931.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the studio was put up for sale, but in the end they were retooled for the production of ''Hell's Kitchen''. The dining room area was the location of the former KCOP news studios, and living quarters for the contestants were built behind the restaurant.&lt;ref name="nypostkcop"&gt;Kaplan, Don. New York Post. June 29, 2005 (TV Wednesday section). "DRESSED TO GRILL ; 'HELL' ISN'T A REAL RESTAURANT".[https://web.archive.org/web/20120120101455/http://pqarchiver.nypost.com/nypost/access/860499481.html?dids=860499481:860499481&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun+29%2C+2005&amp;author=DON+KAPLAN&amp;pub=New+York+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=099&amp;desc=DRESSED+TO+GRILL+%3B+%27HELL%27+ISN%27T+A+REAL+RESTAURANT]&lt;/ref&gt; Before season three, the Hell's Kitchen facility was moved to Century Studios at 3322 La Cienega Place in [[Los Angeles]]. Since the fourth season, Hell's Kitchen's venue has been located at 8660 Hayden Place in [[Culver City, California|Culver City]].{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} According to Arthur Perkins, the soundstage is only open for audience members when taping is taking place.{{sfn|Perkins, Jr.|2011|p = 3}} The studio sits on the former location of the famous [[RKO Forty Acres]] backlot, which was used in movies such as ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With The Wind]]'' and television series such as ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' and ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]''. The studio building sits on the location of the military camp seen in the television series ''[[Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C.]]''.

=== Accusations of staging ===

The series has drawn numerous online and editorial accusations of staging and dramatic license,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2006/08/16/is-hells-kitchen-too-fake-even-for-a-reality-show/ |title=Is Hell's Kitchen too fake, even for a reality show? |publisher=Aoltv.com |date= |accessdate=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly due to editing techniques of the producers, who splice together several hours of footage from a dinner service, in order to make certain contestants appear as poor performers, later justifying their elimination.  This was most obvious when one episode featured clips showing an already eliminated contestant in the background, still cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/archives/hells_kitchen_6/2009_Sep_02_tek_back|title=Tek appears in Hell's Kitchen weeks after being eliminated, probably because of editing error – reality blurred|author=|date=September 2, 2009|website=realityblurred.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most controversial accusations of staging on ''Hell's Kitchen'' relates to an incident with contestant Joseph Tinnelly from Season 6, who, during one elimination round, angrily confronted Ramsay, challenging him to fight, and was then escorted off the set. The incident drew immediate fire from critics as an overplayed and possibly faked scene, conducted to cause action and tension on the show in order to spark viewer interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/hells-kitchen/joseph-just-a-ploy-on-hells-ki-30416.aspx |title=Joseph Just a Ploy on 'Hell's Kitchen'? |publisher=Buddytv.com |date=July 30, 2009 |accessdate=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 interview, Ramsay admitted that the vast majority of his anger towards contestants was acting, his on-camera rage being done to force contestants to give their all and that when off-camera he treated all contestants with friendliness and respect. Ramsay further stated he would often meet with eliminated contestants after their departure from the show, offering positive criticism and advice. Staff and production members further affirmed that in real life, Ramsay was a sociable and friendly person and most of the on-camera drama is played out for the benefit of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Boucher, G. (June 2013). ''Gordon Ramsay's Bark Worse Than His Bite'', Entertainment Weekly&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim''' is an environmental activist and geographer. She is the Coordinator of the Association of Peul Women and Autochthonous Peoples of Chad (AFPAT) and served as the co-director of the pavilion of the World Indigenous Peoples’ Initiative and Pavilion at [[COP21]], [[COP22]] and [[COP23]].

== Activism &amp; Advocacy ==
Ibrahim is an environmental activist working on behalf of her people, the [[Mbororo]] in [[Chad]].&lt;ref name="blog.nationalgeographic.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2017/05/29/national-geographic-emerging-explorer-hindou-oumarou-ibrahim-raising-the-voice-of-indigenous-climate-knowledge/|title=National Geographic Emerging Explorer Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim Raising the Voice of Indigenous Climate Knowledge – National Geographic Blog|website=blog.nationalgeographic.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was educated in Chad's capital city of [[N'Djamena]] and spent her holidays with the indigenous Mbororo people, who are traditionally nomadic farmers, herding and tending cattle.&lt;ref name="blog.nationalgeographic.org"/&gt; During the course of her education, she became aware of the ways in which she was discriminated against as an indigenous woman and also of the ways in which her Mbororo counterparts were excluded from the educational opportunities she received. So in 1999, she founded the Association of Indigenous Peul Women and Peoples of Chad (AFPAT), a community-based organization focused on promoting the rights of girls and women in the Mbororo community and inspiring leadership and advocacy in environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afpat.net/nos-membres/|title=Nos membres – AFPAT|website=www.afpat.net|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.globallandscapesforum.org/28833/hindou-oumarou-ibrahim-bridging-worlds-through-environmental-activism/|title=Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim: Bridging worlds through environmental activism - Landscape News|date=2018-08-13|work=Landscape News|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization received its operating license in 2005 and has since participated in international negotiations on climate, sustainable development, biodiversity, and environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://climatdeveloppement.org/lercd/afpat-tchad/|title=AFPAT Tchad {{!}} Réseau climat et developpement|website=climatdeveloppement.org|language=fr-FR|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her focus on environmental advocacy stemmed from her firsthand experience of the effects of global climate change on the Mbororo community, who rely on natural resources for their own survival and for the survival of the animals they care for. For years, they have been experiencing the effects of [[Lake Chad]] drying up; the lake is a vital source of water for people from Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria, and is now 10% of its size from the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/36100566/why-is-one-of-the-world-s-largest-lakes-disappearing|title=Why is one of the world's largest lakes disappearing?|website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a written testimony to the [[International Organization for Migration]], Ibrahim emphasized that her people, and indigenous communities like her own, are "direct victims of climate change," which has worked to displace them, forcing them to abandon their own lands in search of ones that can sustain their way of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.iom.int/jahia/webdav/shared/shared/mainsite/microsites/IDM/workshops/climate-change-2011/Report-EN.pdf|title=International Dialogue on Migration: Climate Change, Environmental Degradation, and Migration|author=Ibrahim|authors=|first=Hindu Oumarou|date=2012|publisher=International Organization for Migration|issue=|doi=|location=|edition=|volume=18|page=|pages=51–53|pmid=|docket=|quote=|author-link=|access-date=October 8, 2018|format=|others=|chapter=|section=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that testimony, she also spoke of the consequences of climate change migration, which disproportionately leaves migrant communities vulnerable.

Ibrahim has written on the importance of recognizing indigenous people's rights when crafting global climate change for a variety of outlets, including [[Quartz (magazine)|Quartz]] and the [[World Economic Forum]]'s Agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/541700/global-climate-change-policy-must-recognize-indigenous-rights/|title=Global climate-change policy must recognize indigenous rights — Quartz|website=qz.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/03/indigenous-people-forest-preservation/|title=Why indigenous people are key to protecting our forests|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular concern to Ibrahim is the legal right of indigenous peoples to own and manage the lands where they live. Such legal rights guarantee that indigenous community have legal agency in economic developments that might displace them, such as oil drilling projects, mining, and hydropower plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/hindou-oumarou-ibrahim-and-lene-kielsen-holm-talk-paris|title=Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim and Lene Kielsen Holm talk Paris COP21|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibrahim has worked collaboratively with [[UNESCO]] and the [[Indigenous Peoples of Africa Co-ordinating Committee|Indigenous Peoples of Africa Coordinating Committee]] (IPACC) on a project to 3D map Chad's [[Sahel]] desert region, where 250,000 Mbororos currently live, relying on subsistence farming.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-41887971|title=The women championing their scientific ancestors|last=Halton|first=Mary|date=2017-11-07|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.globallandscapesforum.org/25828/hindou-oumarou-ibrahim-urges-more-rights-for-indigenous-people-to-benefit-landscapes/|title=Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim urges more rights for indigenous people to benefit landscapes - Landscape News|date=2018-01-13|work=Landscape News|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project combined 3D mapping technologies with indigenous scientific knowledge to develop a tool to sustainably manage the environment and empower indigenous voices—particularly those of women—to make decisions on planning for a future of climate adaptation and mitigation. In an interview with [[BBC]] for ''BBC's 100 Women'' project, Ibrahim noted: "Every culture has a science. So it's really important for the indigenous voice to be there."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2016, Ibrahim was selected to represent civil society at the signing of the historic [[Paris Agreement|Paris Climate Agreement]] on April 22, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2016/04/indigenous-mbororo-woman-to-speak-at-paris-agreement-signing-ceremony-on-22-april/|title=Indigenous Mbororo woman from Chad to speak alongside world leaders at Paris Agreement signing ceremony at UN on 22 April|website=www.un.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her statement at the signing, she noted: "Climate change is adding poverty to poverty every day, forcing many to leave home for a better future."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-36108194|title=Nations sign historic Paris climate deal|last=McGrath|first=Matt|date=2016-04-22|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leadership ==
Ibrahim serves in a number of leadership capacities advocating for the importance of indigenous knowledge in mitigating the effects of climate change. She is co-Chair of the [[International Indigenous Peoples Forum on Climate Change]], representing the group at the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD) and of the Pan-African Alliance Climate Justice (PACJA), where she also acts as the chair of recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/people/hindou-oumarou-ibrahim|title=Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also a member of the Policy Board United Nations: Indigenous Peoples Partnership (UNIPP) and of the Executive Committee for the [[Indigenous Peoples of Africa Co-ordinating Committee|Indigenous Peoples of Africa Coordinating Committee]] (IPACC).

== Awards &amp; Honors ==
In 2017, Ibrahim was recognized as a [[National Geographic Society]] Emerging Explorer, a program that recognizes and supports outstanding scientists, conservationists, storytellers, and innovators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/explorers-festival/2017/emerging-explorers/|title=2017 Emerging Explorers|last=Society|first=National Geographic|website=www.nationalgeographic.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, she was also featured as part of BBC's ''100 Women'' project, recognizing 100 influential and inspiring women every year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Hush-a-phone pedestal model.jpg|thumb|Hush-A-Phone attached to a [[candlestick telephone]] on display at [[Museum of Communications]] in [[Seattle]]]]
The '''Hush-A-Phone''' was a device designed to attach to the transmitter of a [[telephone]] to reduce [[noise pollution]] and increase privacy. Sold by the Hush-A-Phone company, the device was frequently described in its commercial advertisements as "a voice silencer designed for confidential conversation, clear transmission and office quiet. Not a permanent attachment. Slips right on and off the mouthpiece of any phone".

The device was the topic of a landmark court case, ''[[Hush-A-Phone v. United States]]''. The Hush-A-Phone was regularly referred to in telecommunications policy analysis in the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilsford|first1=David|title=Exit and Voice: Strategies for Change in Bureaucratic-Legislative Policymaking|journal=Policy Studies Journal|date=March 1984|volume=12|issue=3|page=435|doi= 10.1111/j.1541-0072.1984.tb00319.x|issn= 1541-0072}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vietor|first1=Richard|last2=Davidson|first2=Dekkers|title=Economics and Politics of Deregulation: The Issue of Telephone Access Charges|journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management|date=Fall 1985|volume=5|issue=3|pages=3–23|doi= 10.2307/3323410|issn= 0276-8739}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bernard|first1=Keith E.|title=Regulatory Development in the U.S.|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science|date=November 1986|volume=37|issue=6|pages=409–414|doi= 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(198611)37:6&lt;409::AID-ASI6&gt;3.0.CO;2-Z|issn= 2330-1635}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Melody|first1=William|title=Efficiency and Social Policy in Telecommunication: Lessons from the U.

Advertisements for the Hush-A-Phone not only argued for its importance as an aid to privacy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Display Ad 194|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=June 23, 1922|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also noted the device improved clarity of sound,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Display Ad 27|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=June 26, 1922|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[AT&amp;T]] would directly argue against.

==History==

===1920–1948: early years===
The manufacture of Hush-A-Phones began in 1921,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gordon|first1=John Steele|authorlink=John Steele Gordon|date=April 1997|title=The Death of a Monopoly|journal=American Heritage|volume=48|issue=2|page=16|issn= 0002-8738}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Hush-A-Phone company was first mentioned in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in a 1922 classified advertisement for a "typist-dictaphone operator".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Classified Ad 207|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=February 26, 1922|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Hush-A-Phone was located in New York's [[Flatiron District]], at 41 Union Square. Only a month later, the company advertised for a salesman, noting that 500 Hush-A-Phones were sold in one week at a business show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Classified Ad 229|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=March 19, 1922|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was still seeking a salesman in April 1922, but stopped posting dedicated sales openings until January 1923, this time noting several thousand Hush-A-Phones had already sold in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Classified Ad 42|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=April 5, 1922|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Classified Ad 4|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=January 16, 1923|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's first classified advertisement for the product appeared June 7, 1922, pricing the product at $10 and offering a free 5-day trial offer. Between the end of June 1922 and January 16, 1923, the company moved eleven blocks closer to the Empire State Building, to 1182 Broadway, and the "free trial" changed to "free demonstration offer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Display Ad 15|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=January 16, 1923|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A capital increase to the "Hush-A-Phone Sales Corp." company was announced on December 22, 1922, from $250,000 to $500,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Incorporations|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=December 23, 1922|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 1923, the company's name changed from Hush-A-Phone Sales Corp., Manhattan, to Hush-A-Phone Corp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stock Quote 15|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=March 6, 1923|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time between May 30, 1923, and October 18, 1923, Hush-A-Phone moved halfway back toward its original Union Square location, to 10 Madison Avenue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Classified Ad 4|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=May 30, 1923|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Display Ad 11|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=October 18, 1923|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by May 1924, the company had started suggesting that potential customers outside of New York wanting a demonstration would instead be sent a booklet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Display Ad 59|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=May 11, 1924|page=SM12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] brought trouble to many companies. On October 20, 1929, Hush-A-Phone was advertised along with several other companies on the first page of ''The New York Times'' as part of the "National Business Show" being held in Grand Central Palace from October 21 to 24. The company was showing its handset model for the first time. The ad noted that Mr. H. C. Tuttle, President of the Hush-A-Phone Corporation, had just returned from a European tour of ten countries where the product would be distributed. The product was described as being "beautiful," made of bakelite, and "embellished with a work of art in bas-relief. It appears as a handsome desk clock, nine inches high, concealing its function as a Hush-A-Phone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Classified Ad 15|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=October 20, 1929|page=N6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time between October 1927 and December 1929, Hush-A-Phone moved from its Madison Avenue location to about seven blocks southwest to 43 W. 16th Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Display Ad 52|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=October 13, 1927|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Display Ad 135|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=December 8, 1929|page=N10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although one more advertisement appeared in 1929 (December 8, just in time for the holidays), Hush-A-Phone was absent from the ''Times'' until July 1934, when a four-line, text-only advertisement appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Classified Ad 1|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=July 12, 1934|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisements in 1936 noted a new model "for French phone" was out,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Display Ad 31|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=May 11, 1936|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in October 1937 the Hush-A-Phone company was exhibiting again, this time showing a 200-foot elastic telephone wire at the National Business Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Models Lead At Business Show: Improvements of Office Devices Featured in Exhibits of 100 Producers Attendance 'Gratifying' But Effect of Decline in Stocks Is Detected at Some Booths in Lower Sales Security Law Devices Attract Types in Reverse|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=October 19, 1937|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the four-line classified advertisements continued to be the company's public appearances after the show, appearing between ads for cigars and baldness cures, until 1942, when their product appeared in photographs in a few ads run by houseware store Lewis &amp; Conger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Display Ad 21|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=November 29, 1942|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Display Ad 24|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=December 6, 1944|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944 the company noted "Models for E-1 and F-1 Handset Phone; Pedestal Phone; Switchboard and Dictating Machines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Display Ad 39|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=December 7, 1944|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, Hush-A-Phone ads began appearing in ''The Washington Post'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Display Ad 1|work=The Washington Post|date=April 3, 1945|page=2|issn= 0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hush-A-Phone consulted with acoustics expert [[Leo Beranek]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], who began work to design an improved silencer. Beranek would later bring in [[J. C. R. Licklider]] to help demonstrate the Hush-A-Phone retained clarity of sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wu|first1=Tim|title=The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires|date=2010|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=New York|isbn=0307594653|pages=103, 120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

125,796 Hush-A-Phone sets were sold between 1922 and 1949.&lt;ref name=hitsback&gt;{{cite news|title=Hush-A-Phone Hits Back at A.T.&amp;T.: Corporation Files Answer to F.C.C.'s Decision Sustaining Prohibition of Device|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=March 24, 1951|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1948–1957: legal battles with AT&amp;T===
During the 1940s, telephone service was seen as a "[[natural monopoly]]", and [[AT&amp;T]] was the sole provider of all aspects of telephone service in much of the U.S., including [[telephone]] equipment. In the late 1940s, phone company repairmen began warning customers that using devices like the Hush-A-Phone could result in termination of phone service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wu|first1=Tim|title=The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires|date=2010|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=New York|isbn=0307594653|pages=101-102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 1948, Hush-A-Phone and Harry C. Tuttle, its president, protested to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), asking them to order the phone company to authorize use of the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Phone Company Upheld in Ban on Hush-a-Phone|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=February 17, 1951|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hearing occurred in 1950, but the original hearing examiner involved died, delaying the initial recommendation.&lt;ref name="phonedeviceban"&gt;{{cite news|title=Phone Device Ban by A.T.&amp;T. Upheld: F. C. C. Rules Company Can Bar Use of Attachments Made by Others|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=December 24, 1955|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time between May 3 and 12, 1949, the company moved a few doors down, to 65 Madison Ave.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Display Ad 2|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=May 3, 1949|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Display Ad 2|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=May 12, 1949|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally advertisements exceeded the four-line standard, in Oct 1949 offering free tickets to the "Business Show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Display Ad 34|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=October 24, 1949|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1951, the FCC decided Hush-A-Phone's complaint should be dismissed, but held the case open for the next seven years, permitting further pleadings and reconsideration.&lt;ref name="phonedeviceban"/&gt; A letter to the editor of ''The Washington Post'' by John P. Roberts, a communications engineer, described the FCC decision "an invasion of the rights of the individual", adding "even if this quality deterioration had been satisfactorily demonstrated, it is hard to understand why the FCC should have the power to forbid my use of the Hush-A-Phone if I choose to accept the deterioration in quality for the sake of increased privacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=John|title=Hush-A-Phone|work=The Washington Post|date=February 26, 1951|page=6|issn= 0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 23, 1951, Hush-A-Phone and Harry C. Tuttle submitted filings to the FCC reporting scientific tests proving that the Hush-A-Phone "actually causes a net increase in 'transmission efficiency  of the telephone circuit" and that AT&amp;T and affiliates were "public utility monopolies unlawfully interfering with the natural and inherent rights of a subscriber".  FCC official Jack Werner's suggestion was that the telephone company should suspend service to any consumer failing to comply with the regulation prohibiting foreign attachments.&lt;ref name=hitsback/&gt;

The FCC's final decision was issued on December 23, 1955, and stated "The unrestricted use of the 'Hush-A-Phone' could result in a general deterioration of the quality of interstate and foreign telephone service. Accordingly, it is not an unjust and unreasonable practice upon the part of the defendants to prohibit its use in connection with their telephone services."&lt;ref name="phonedeviceban"/&gt;  While the commission agreed that the Hush-A-Phone did provide protection against eavesdroppers and noise from telephone circuits, "the device sometimes results in loss of voice intelligibility and also has an adverse affect [sic] on voice recognition and naturalness."&lt;ref name="phonedeviceban"/&gt;

The FCC's 1955 decision was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals on November 8, 1956, in the landmark case ''[[Hush-A-Phone v. United States]]'', with the decision stating it was an "unwarranted interference with the telephone subscriber's right reasonably to use his telephone in ways which are privately beneficial without becoming publicly detrimental".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Court Removes Ban Against Phone Device|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=November 9, 1956|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC followed up on February 6, 1957 to officially direct AT&amp;T and Bell System subsidiaries to permit subscribers to use the Hush-A-Phone and similar devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hush-A-Phone Backed: F.C.C. Directs Bell System to Permit 'Privacy' Device|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=February 7, 1957|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisements proudly noted "Use of the Hush-A-Phone on telephone is permitted by Federal Appellate Court ruling" beginning in March 1957,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Display Ad 114|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=March 4, 1957|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by July were stating "Bell System Approves Use of Hush-A-Phone by tariffs Effective May 16, 1957".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Display Ad 124|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=July 8, 1957|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1958–present===
Hush-A-Phone was still featured in advertisements by the company during the early 1960s in ''[[The New York Times]]'', but their last direct ad seems to have been on March 13, 1962,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Display Ad 256|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=March 13, 1962|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which the product was featured in catalog-type ads posted by stationer's store Goldsmith Brothers through 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Display Ad 326|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=September 23, 1962|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Display Ad 110|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=October 4, 1970|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the last classified ad for Hush-A-Phone was listed by Harrison-Hoge Industries, Inc. for $13.95 in black and $15.95 in green, ivory, or beige.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Display Ad 164|work=The New York Times|issn= 0362-4331|date=August 27, 1972|page=S28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hush-A-Phone appears to no longer be for sale except as a collector's item.

      <comment>Added additional content regarding jacketed vessels.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6760">[[File:Final half coil vessel.JPG|thumb|250px|External view of a half-pipe coil jacketed vessel]]
{{double image|right|Autoclave.svg|120|Half pipe reactor.svg|125|Symbols used in [[P&amp;ID]] to represent a jacketed agitated vessel (left) and a half-pipe jacketed agitated vessel (right).}}

In [[chemical engineering]], a '''jacketed vessel''' is a container that is designed for controlling  [[temperature]] of its contents, by using a cooling or heating "jacket" around the vessel through which a cooling or heating [[fluid]] is circulated.

In specifying jacketed pressure vessels, the choice of a jacket usually comes down to economy, weight and versatility of the heating or cooling requirement. Heat transfer efficiency is another important consideration when deciding on which jacketed pressure vessel option best suits your needs. Each jacket option provides different benefits to the overall function and performance of the pressure vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kennedytank.com/jacketed-pressure-vessels/|title=Jacketed Pressure Vessels {{!}} Kennedy Tank|website=www.kennedytank.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A jacket is a cavity external to the vessel that permits the uniform exchange of heat between the fluid circulating in it and the walls of the vessel. There are several types of jackets, depending on the  design:&lt;ref name=Singh&gt;[http://www.cheresources.com/jacketed_vessel_design.shtml Santosh Singh, "Jacketed Vessel Design"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Conventional Jackets'''. A second shell is installed over a portion of the vessel, creating an annular space within which cooling or heating medium flows. A simple conventional jacket, with no internal components, is generally very inefficient for heat transfer because the flow media has an extremely low velocity resulting in a low heat transfer coefficient. Condensing media, such as steam or Dowtherm A, is an exception because in this case the heat transfer coefficient doesn't depend on velocity or turbulence, but instead is related to the surface area upon which the media condenses and the efficiency of removing condensate. Internals include baffles that direct flow in a spiral pattern around the jacket, and agitating nozzles that cause high turbulence at the point where the fluid is introduced into the jacket.
* '''Half-Pipe Coil Jackets'''. Pipes are split lengthwise, usually with an included angle of 180 degrees (split evenly down the middle) or 120 degrees, then wound around the vessel and welded in place. Half-pipe coil vessel jackets are preferred for high-temperature industrial processing applications. These jackets are also excellent for heat transfer and thermal fluid heating systems, particularly when the utility fluid is a liquid. These jackets can be divided into multi-pass zones for maximum flexibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sigmathermal.com/jacketed-vessels/|title=Jacketed Vessels - Sigma Thermal|work=Sigma Thermal|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Dimple Jackets'''. A thin external shell is affixed to the vessel shell with spot welds located in a regular pattern, often about 50 mm on center both horizontally and vertically. These so-called dimples impart turbulence to the heating or cooling media as it flows through the jacket.
* '''Plate Coils'''. Often very similar to dimple jackets, but fabricated separately as fully contained jackets that are then strapped to a vessel. They are slightly less efficient than dimple jackets because there is a double layer of metal for the heat to traverse (the plate coil inside surface and the vessel shell). They also require good bonding to the vessel jacket, to prevent an insulating gap between the plate coil and the vessel.

Jackets can be applied to the entire surface of a vessel or just a portion of it. For a vertical vessel, the top head is typically left unjacketed. Jackets can be divided into zones, to divide the flow of the heating or cooling medium. Advantages include: ability to direct flow to certain portions of the jacket, such as only the bottom head when minimal heating or cooling is needed and the entire jacket when maximum heating or cooling is required; ability to provide a higher volume of flow overall (zones are piped in parallel) because the pressure drop through a zone is lower than if the entire jacket is a single zone.

Jacketed vessels can be employed as [[chemical reactors]] (to remove the elevated [[heat of reaction]]) or to reduce the [[viscosity]] of high viscous fluids (such as [[tar]]).

[[Agitation (action)|Agitation]] can be also used in jacketed vessels to improve the [[wikt:homogeneity|homogeneity]] of the fluid properties (such as [[temperature]] or [[concentration]]).

== Industries and Applications ==
The closed-loop heating system of a jacketed vessel allows for great convenience in batching processes. Many industries require that a vessel be both heated and cooled as part of a single process; a well-designed jacket with a thermal fluid system is a seamless way to achieve the necessary temperatures.

Glass-clad vessels and setups that require frequent cleaning also benefit from jacketed systems, as it’s difficult to equip such vessels with internal coils for heating or cooling. Below are just a few of the many industries benefitting from the convenience and reliability of thermal fluid heating in jacketed vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sigmathermal.com/jacketed-vessels/|title=Jacketed Vessels - Sigma Thermal|work=Sigma Thermal|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1958{{ndash}}1960s===
In 1958, LG Electronics was founded as ''[[GoldStar]]'' ([[Hangul]]:금성). It was established in the aftermath of the [[Korean War]] to provide the rebuilding nation with domestically-produced [[consumer electronics]] and home appliances. LG Electronics produced South Korea's first radios, TVs, refrigerators, washing machines, and air conditioners. GoldStar was one of the LG groups with a brethren company, Lak-Hui (pronounced "Lucky") Chemical Industrial Corp. which is now LG Chem and LG Households. GoldStar merged with [[LG Chem|Lucky Chemical]] and [[LS Cable]] on 28 February 1995, changing the corporate name to Lucky-Goldstar, and then finally to LG Electronics.

===1970s{{ndash}}1990s===
In 1978, LG Electronics earned US$100&amp;nbsp;million in revenue from exports for the first time in its history. Rapid growth by globalization saw the company establish its first overseas production, based in the United States, in 1982. In 1994, GoldStar officially adopted the LG Electronics brand and a new corporate logo. LG Electronics acquired the US-based TV manufacturer [[Zenith Electronics|Zenith]]. In 1995, LG Electronics made the world's first [[CDMA]] digital mobile handsets and supplied [[Ameritech]] and [[GTE]] in the US. The company was also awarded UL certification in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.lg.com/global/about-lg/corporate-information/at-a-glance/history |publisher=LG's official website |title=LG's History}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, LG developed the world's first 60-inch [[plasma TV]], and in 1999 established a joint venture with [[Philips]] {{ndash}} LG.Philips LCD {{ndash}} which now goes by the name [[LG Display]].

===2000{{ndash}}present===
In order to create a holding company, the former LG Electronics was split off in 2002, with the "new" LG Electronics being spun off and the "old" LG Electronics changing its name to LG EI. It was then merged with and into LG CI in 2003 (the legal successor of the former LG Chem), so the company that started as Goldstar does not currently exist.

LG Electronics plays a large role in the global consumer electronics industry; it was the second-largest LCD TV manufacturer worldwide as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/statistics/267095/global-market-share-of-lcd-tv-manufacturers/ Global market share held by LCD TV manufacturers from 2008 to 2013]. Retrieved 26 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2005, LG was a Top 100 global brand, and in 2006 LG recorded a brand growth of 14%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bwnt.businessweek.com/brand/2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704121513/http://bwnt.businessweek.com/brand/2006|date=4 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its display manufacturing affiliate, [[LG Display]], as of 2009 was the world's largest LCD panel manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.lge.com/ir/html/ABboards.do?action=read&amp;group_code=AB&amp;list_code=PRE_MENU&amp;seq=5458&amp;page=1&amp;target=pressreleases_read.jsp|title=LG.com|website=|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, LG Electronics entered the [[smartphone]] industry. Since, LG Electronics continued to develop various electronic products, such as releasing the world's first 84-inch [[Ultra high definition television|ultra-HD]] TV for retail sale.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2012/10/26/lg-84-inch-4k-tv-goes-on-sale-in-the-us-for-19999/ LG's 84-inch 4K TV goes on sale in the US for $19,999, home mortgage optional]. 26 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 December 2012, the antitrust regulators of the [[European Union]] fined LG Electronics and five other major companies (Samsung, Thomson since 2010 known as Technicolor, Matsushita which today is Panasonic Corp, Philips, and Toshiba) for fixing prices of TV [[cathode-ray tube]]s in two cartels lasting nearly a decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Philips, LG Electronics, 4 others fined 1.47&amp;nbsp;billion Euros for EU cartel |url= http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international-business/philips-lg-electronics-4-others-fined-1-47-billion-euros-for-eu-cartel/articleshow/17493208.cms|work=The Economic Times |date=5 December 2012 |accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing and public relations==

===Sponsorships===

LG owns the [[Korean Baseball Organisation]] (KBO) [[LG Twins]] (LG 트윈스). The team is one of the founding members of the KBO, established in 1982, although LG took over ownership of the team in 1989. The team has won two Korean Series (1990 and 1994), although their loyal and large fan base has been starved of success since relative to the budget and size of the club in the KBO. That said, LG continues to attract the largest average attendance out of all KBO teams and has emerged from its slump to become regular playoff contenders in recent years. 

In August 2013, LG Electronics announced that it would sponsor German [[Bundesliga]] club [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen]] for the next three years with an option to extend for one more year. In the U.S., LG Electronics' brand and product advertisements can be seen in Dodger Stadium of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] and Great American Ball Park of the [[Cincinnati Reds]].

During the period 2001–2003, LG sponsored the snooker [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]]. During these years the tournament was known as the ''LG Cup''.

==Environmental record==
[[Choice magazine]], in independent tests of popular LG fridge models in 2010, found the energy consumption in two models was higher than claimed by LG.

LG gave undertakings to the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] (ACCC) to provide appropriate corrective notices and upgrade and maintain its trade practices compliance program. In 2006, LG overstated energy efficiency on five of its air conditioner models and was again required to offer consumers rebates to cover the extra energy costs.&lt;ref name="choicelg" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7865">A '''laser surface velocimeter''' (LSV) is a non-contact optical [[speed sensor]] measuring velocity and length on moving surfaces. Laser surface velocimeters use the laser Doppler principle to evaluate the laser light scattered back from a moving object. They are widely used for process and quality control in industrial production processes.

==Principle of operation==
===The differential Doppler process===
[[File:Differenz-Dopplerverfahren.jpg|thumb|The differential Doppler process]]
The Doppler effect (or Doppler shift) is the change in [[frequency]] of a [[wave]] for an [[observer (special relativity)|observer]] moving relative to the source of the wave. The wave has a frequency f and propagates at a speed c When the observer moves at a velocity of v relative to the source, he receives a different frequency f' according to

:&lt;math&gt;f' = f ( c-v ) = f \left( 1-\frac{v}{c} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The above analysis is an approximation for small velocities in comparison to the speed of light which is fulfilled very well for practically all technically relevant velocities.

To make a measurement on moving objects, which can in principle be of any length, requires a measurement design with an observation axis for the sensor which is at a right angle to the direction of movement of the object under investigation.

Laser surface velocimeters work according to the socalled Difference Doppler Technique. Here, 2 laser beams which are each incident to the optical axis at an angle φ, are superimposed on the surface of the object. For a point P, which moves at velocity v through the intersection point of the two laser beams, the frequencies of the two laser beams are Doppler shifted in accordance with the above
formula. At the point P of the object which is moving at the velocity ''v'', the following frequencies therefore occur:

:&lt;math&gt;f_\text{P1,2} = f_\text{1,2} \left( 1- \vec v \ast \frac{\vec e_\text{1,2}}{c}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\vec e_\text{1,2,e}&lt;/math&gt; = Unit vectors of laser beams 1 and 2 and in direction detector

:''f''&lt;sub&gt;1,2&lt;/sub&gt; = Frequencies of the laser beams 1 and 2

:''f''&lt;sub&gt;P1,P2&lt;/sub&gt; = Doppler shifted frequencies of laser beams 1 and 2 in point P

The point P now emits scatter waves in the direction of the detector. As P is moving with the object, the scattered radiation in the direction &lt;math&gt;\vec e_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt; of the detector is also Doppler shifted. Thus for the frequency of the scatter waves in the direction of the detector, it can be said:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f_\text{e1,e2}
&amp; = f_\text{P1,P2} \left( 1 - \frac{\vec v \ast \vec e_\text{e}}{c} \right) \\
&amp; = f_\text{1,2} \left( 1 - \frac{\vec v \ast \vec e_\text{1,2}}{c} \right) \left( 1 - \frac{\vec v \ast \vec e_\text{e}}{c} \right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The scatter waves are superimposed on the detector. Due to the interference of the scatter waves from the two laser beams, there are different frequency components in the superimposition. The low-frequency beat frequency of the superimposed scatter radiation which corresponds to the Doppler frequency ''f''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; is analyzed metrologically. When both incidental laser beams are at the same frequency (same wavelength), this is seen as a difference of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;e2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;e1&lt;/sub&gt; to:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f_\text{D}
&amp; = f_\text{e2} - f_\text{e1} \\
&amp; = f \left(\vec v \ast \frac{\vec e_\text{1} - \vec e_\text{2}}{c} \right) \left( \frac{\vec v \ast \vec e_\text{e}}{c} \right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If point P moves vertically with reference to the optical axis and at the same angle of incidence φ, it can be said that:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec v \ast (\vec e_\text{1} - \vec e_\text{2}) = 2 v \sin \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\vec v \ast \vec e_\text{e}=0&lt;/math&gt;

This means the final result is:

:&lt;math&gt;f_\text{D} = \frac{v}{\Delta s} &lt;/math&gt;

The Doppler shift is thus directly proportional to the velocity. A graphic explanation which leads to the same result follows:

===Graphic representation===
[[File:LSV-Principle.jpg|thumb|Principle of laser surface velocimetry]]
Both the laser beams are superimposed in the measurement volume and in this spatial area, generate an interference pattern of bright and dark fringes.

The fringe spacing Δ'''s''' is a system constant which depends on the laser wavelength λ and the angle between the laser beams 2φ:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta s = \frac{\lambda}{2 \sin \varphi} &lt;/math&gt;

If a particle moves through the fringe pattern, then the intensity of the light it scatters back is modulated.

As a result of this, a photo receiver in the sensor head generates an AC signal, the frequency f&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; of which is directly proportional to the velocity component of the surface in measurement direction v&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and it can be said that:

:&lt;math&gt;f_\text{D} = \frac{v_\text{p}}{\Delta s} = \frac{2v}{\lambda} \sin \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

:''f''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = Doppler frequency
:''v''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = Velocity component in the direction of measurement
:Δ''s'' = Fringe spacing in the measurement volume

===The heterodyne technique===
Laser surface velocimeters work in the so-called heterodyne mode, i.e. the frequency of one of the laser beams is shifted by an offset
of 40&amp;nbsp;MHz, e.g.. This makes the fringes in the measurement volume travel with a velocity corresponding to the offset frequency f&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;. This then makes it possible to identify the direction of movement of the object and to measure at the velocity zero. The resulting modulation frequency f&lt;sub&gt;mod&lt;/sub&gt; at the photo receiver in heterodyne mode is:

:&lt;math&gt;f_\text{mod} = f_\text{b} + \frac{v_\text{p}}{\Delta s} = f_\text{b} + \frac{2v}{\lambda} \sin \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

The modulation frequency is determined in the controller using Fourier transformation and converted into the measurement value for the
velocity v&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. The length measurement is made by integrating the velocity signal.

==Applications==
Laser surface velocimeters measure speed and length of moving surfaces on coils, strips, tubes, fiber, film, paper, foil, composite lumber, or almost any other moving material, including hot steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title =Polytec InFocus 2/2010 page 19 | url =http://www.polytec.com/fileadmin/user_uploads/Applications/InFocus/Documents/OM_InFocus_2010_02_E.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; LSVs can accomplish various tasks like cut-to-length control, part length and spool length measurement, speed measurement and speed control, differential speed measurement for mass flow control, encoder calibration, ink-jet marker control, and many others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8265">An incomplete list of parts making up '''STEP''' ([[ISO 10303]]):

==Descriptions methods==
* Part 1 - ''Overview and fundamental principles'' (1994). Unfortunately outdated, not covering the role of AICs and modules.
* '''Part 11 - ''[[ISO 10303-11|EXPRESS]] language reference manual'''''
* Part 12 - ''EXPRESS -I language reference manual (withdrawn)''
* Part 14 - ''EXPRESS -X language reference manual''

==Implementation methods==
* '''Part 21 - [[ISO 10303-21|STEP-File]] ''Clear text encoding of the exchange structure'''''
* '''Part 22 - [[ISO 10303-22|SDAI]] ''Standard data access interface specification'''''
* Part 23 - ''C++ [[language binding]] of the standard data access interface''
* Part 24 - ''C language binding of the standard data access interface''
* Part 25 - ''EXPRESS to OMG XMI binding''
* Part 26 - ''Binary representation of EXPRESS-driven data'' using [[Hierarchical Data Format|HDF5]]
* Part 27 - ''Java TM programming language binding to the standard data access interface with Internet/Intranet extensions''
* '''Part 28 - [[ISO 10303-28|STEP-XML]] ''XML representation for EXPRESS-driven data'''''

==Conformance testing methodology and framework==
* Part 31 - ''General concepts''

The original design intend was that data according to this part could be displayed by computer systems supporting the [[Graphical Kernel System]] or [[PHIGS]]. Today other display interfaces such as [[OpenGL]] for 3D and [[Java 2D]] are more appropriate to display part 46 based data.
* Part 47 - ''Shape variation tolerances'': This part supports the representation of [[Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing]] principles for computer sensitive data exchange. But it does not cover how to present the data for humans.
* Part 49 - ''Process structures and properties''

==Application Protocol==
The 'APs' utilize the lower-level information of integrated resources in well defined combinations and configurations to represent a particular data model of an engineering or technical application.
* Part 201 - ''Explicit draughting''. Simple 2D drawing geometry related to a product. No association, no assembly hierarchy. Practically a subset of AP202 and 214.
* Part 202 - ''Associative draughting''. 2D/3D drawing with association, but no product structure. Practically a subset of AP214.
* '''Part 203: ''Configuration controlled 3D designs of mechanical parts and assemblies'''''. Mainly used for 3D design and product structure. A subset of AP214 but most widely used.

* Part 235 - ''Materials information for the design and verification of products''
* Part 236 - ''Furniture catalog and interior design''
* Part 237 - ''Fluid dynamics''
* '''Part 238 - [[STEP-NC]] ''Application interpreted model for computerized numerical controllers'''''
* Part 239 - ''Product life cycle support''
* Part 240 - ''Process plans for machined products''
* Part 242 - ''Managed model-based 3D engineering''

==ATS - Abstract test suite==
An ATS is a formal description on how to test STEP implementations for conformance. They contain a test plan for postprocessors (exporting STEP data) and preprocessors (importing STEP data). The structure of an ATS is defined in part 34. 

The original plan of STEP was to have for every AP 2xx a corresponding ATS 3xx, but only a few were finally realized till today.

==AIC - Application interpreted constructs==
AICs are specializations of the integrated application and generic resources. This is done by subtyping interfaced entities and adding further constraints and rules. No new stand-alone entities are created and no new explicit attributes are added. Most AICs are specializations in the geometric area. AICs did not exist back in 1994 when the first release of STEP got published. But when the 2nd generation of APs grows up it becomes clear that APs do not only share not only the IRs but also a lot of specializations. AICs are a big step towards AP interoperability.
* Part 501 - ''Edge-based wireframe''
* Part 502 - ''Shell-based wireframe''
* Part 503 - ''Geometrically bounded 2D wireframe''
* Part 504 - ''Draughting annotation''
* Part 505 - ''Drawing structure and administration''
* Part 506 - ''Draughting elements''
* Part 507 - ''Geometrically bounded surface''
* Part 508 - ''[[non-manifold model|Non-manifold surface]]''
* '''Part 509 - ''Manifold surface'''''
* Part 510 - ''Geometrically bounded wireframe''
* '''Part 511 - ''Topologically bounded surface'''''
* Part 512 - ''Faceted boundary representation''
* Part 513 - ''Elementary boundary representation''
* '''Part 514 - ''Advanced boundary representation'''''
* Part 515 - ''[[Constructive solid geometry]]''
* Part 517 - ''Mechanical design geometric presentation''

The '''London Green500''' is [[London]] mayor [[Boris Johnson]]’s pioneering carbon mentoring programme. With the aim to lead London’s top organisations to reduce [[carbon emissions]] in the capital by 60% by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.green500.co.uk/cms/about/ About&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The London Green500 is led by a consortium on behalf of the [[London Development Agency]]. [[AEA Technology]] is the lead contractor, with [[Mouchel]], [[National Energy Foundation]], Futerra and Future Considerations.

== What is Green500? ==

The aim of Green500 is to enlist some of London’s largest and most prestigious organisations and mentor them through their carbon reduction commitments.

Green500 is one of a number of London Development Agency (LDA) [[London Development Agency]] initiatives, including Better Buildings Partnership, which aim to reduce London’s CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.  

Members of Green500 receive an initial assessment of their London specific carbon footprint from an expert Green500 Carbon Mentor.  Members are then presented with a tailored Action Plan outlining how they can reduce their carbon emissions.  
The individual Action Plans not only aim to reduce the member’s carbon footprint, but also estimates financial savings for energy, waste, water and transport.  The Green500 Action Plan also gives information on expected payback periods for each change, if implemented successfully. 

As well as providing a company specific Action Plan, Green500 also offers significant benefits to members including awards, networking opportunities and access to specialist suppliers.

== What does Green500 provide? ==

* Support from a Carbon Mentor
* A tailored Carbon Reduction Action Plan
* Financial savings through carbon footprint reduction
* Networking opportunities
* Opportunities for awards
* Access to specialist suppliers
* Help with CRC and other environmental legislation compliance
* Boost in environmental credentials

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology is not responsible for the regulation of content for the media industry. This is administered by the [[State Administration of Radio, Film and Television]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sarft.gov.cn/index.html 国家广播电影电视总局&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The responsibility for regulating the non electronic communications industry in China falls on the [[General Administration of Press and Publication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.gapp.gov.cn/GalaxyPortal/inner/zsww/frame.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060110051135/http://www.gapp.gov.cn/GalaxyPortal/inner/zsww/frame.jsp |archivedate=2006-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The state council announced during the [[2008 National People's Congress]] that the '''Ministry of Industry and Information Technology&lt;ref&gt;http://news.xinhuanet.com/tech/2008-06/27/content_8450738.htm&lt;/ref&gt;''' will supersede the Ministry of Information Industry. The new ministry will also include the former Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, the State Council Informatization Office and the State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23363624-11949,00.html Beijing opens green super-ministry | The Australian&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the ministry's '[[Made_in_China#Development_plan|Made in China 2025]]' plan was  approved by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]. It took over two years to complete by one hundred and fifty people. The plan's aim is to improve production efficiency and quality.{{r|csis}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12806">A '''mobile virtual private network''' (mobile VPN or mVPN)  is a [[Virtual private network|VPN]] which is capable of persisting during sessions across changes in physical connectivity, point of network attachment, and IP address.&lt;ref name="Mobile VPN: Closing the Gap"&gt;Phifer, Lisa. [http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid40_gci1210989_mem1,00.html "Mobile VPN: Closing the Gap"], ''SearchMobileComputing.com'', July 16, 2006. Accessed July 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The "mobile" in the name refers to the fact that the VPN can change points of network attachment, not necessarily that the mVPN client is a mobile phone or that it is running on a wireless network.&lt;ref name="media.wiley.com"&gt;http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/10/04712190/0471219010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile VPNs are used in environments where workers need to keep application sessions open at all times, throughout the working day, as they connect via various wireless networks, encounter gaps in coverage, or suspend-and-resume their devices to preserve [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] life. A conventional [[Virtual private network|VPN]] cannot survive such events because the [[network tunnel]] is disrupted, causing applications to disconnect, time out,&lt;ref name="Mobile VPN: Closing the Gap"/&gt; fail, or even the computing device itself to [[Crash (computing)|crash]].&lt;ref name="Cheng"&gt;Cheng, Roger. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119717610996418467 "Lost Connections"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', December 11, 2007. Accessed July 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile VPNs are commonly used in [[public safety]], [[home care]], [[hospital]] settings, [[field service management]], [[Public utility|utilities]] and other industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.netmotionsoftware.com/case-studies/|title=Industry Case Studies of NetMotion Wireless Software|last=|first=|date=|website=NetMotion|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, they are being adopted by mobile professionals and [[white-collar worker]]s.&lt;ref name="Cheng" /&gt;

==Comparison with other VPN types==
A [[Virtual private network|VPN]] maintains an authenticated, encrypted tunnel for securely passing data traffic over public networks (typically, the [[Internet]].) Other VPN types are [[IPsec]] VPNs, which are useful for [[Point-to-point (network topology)|point-to-point]] connections when the network endpoints are known and remain fixed; or [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] VPNs, which provide for access through a [[Web browser]] and are commonly used by remote workers ([[telecommuting]] workers or business travelers).&lt;ref name="netmotionwireless.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.netmotionsoftware.com/software-defined-mobility/|title=Software Define Mobility|last=|first=|date=2017-06-07|website=NetMotion|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Makers of mobile VPNs draw a distinction between remote access and mobile environments.  A remote-access user typically establishes a connection from a fixed endpoint, launches applications that connect to corporate resources as needed, and then logs off. In a mobile environment, the endpoint changes constantly (for instance, as users roam between different [[cellular network]]s or [[Wi-Fi]] [[Wireless access point|access point]]s). A mobile VPN maintains a virtual connection to the application at all times as the endpoint changes, handling the necessary network logins in a manner transparent to the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lisa Phifer, Contributor |url=http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid40_gci1210989_mem1,00.html |title=Mobile VPN: Closing the gap |publisher=Searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In telecommunications==
In [[telecommunication]], a mobile VPN is a solution  that provides data user mobility and ensures secure network access with predictable performance.  Data user mobility is defined as uninterrupted connectivity or the
ability to stay connected and communicate to a possibly remote data network while changing the network access medium or points of attachment.&lt;ref name="media.wiley.com"/&gt;

In 2001, [[Huawei]] launched a product named "MVPN".  In this case "MVPN" had a different meaning from the way that later industry sources would use the term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huawei.com/publications/view.do?id=131&amp;cid=79&amp;pid=61 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525044440/http://www.huawei.com/publications/view.do?id=131&amp;cid=79&amp;pid=61 |date=May 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Huawei product was focused on delivering a seamless corporate phone system to users whether they were on desktop phones or mobile devices.  Although the web page is no longer available, the company advertised that their MVPN had the following advantages over a standard phone system:
* Direct connectivity – the corporate network becomes part of [[Mobile phone operator|mobile operator]]'s network through direct connection
* Private numbering plan – the communication is tailored to company organization
* Corporate Business Group – all offices and employees are part of one common group, that includes all mobile and desk phones
* Short dialing – a short [[Telephone numbering plan|number]] to access each employee, no meter on his mobile or desk phone
* Smart Divert – easy divert within company group
* Groups and subgroups – Several sub-groups could be defined within the group with different changing as well as with separate [[Telephone numbering plan|numbering plan]]
* Calls control – certain destinations could be allowed or barred both on mobile and desk phones.

'''Molecular scale electronics''', also called '''single-molecule electronics''', is a branch of [[nanotechnology]] that uses single molecules, or nanoscale collections of single molecules, as [[electronic component]]s. Because single molecules constitute the smallest stable structures imaginable, this miniaturization is the ultimate goal for shrinking [[electrical circuit]]s.

The field is often termed simply as "[[molecular electronics]]", but this term is also used to refer to the distantly related field of [[conductive polymer]]s and [[organic electronics]], which uses the properties of molecules to affect the bulk properties of a material.  A nomenclature distinction has been suggested so that ''molecular materials for electronics'' refers to this latter field of bulk applications, while ''molecular scale electronics'' refers to the nanoscale single-molecule applications treated here.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Petty |first=M.C. |author2=Bryce, M.R. |author3=Bloor, D. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Introduction to Molecular Electronics |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1995 |location=New York |pages=1–25 |isbn=0-19-521156-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tour |first=James M. |authorlink=James Tour |title=Recent advances in molecular scale electronics |journal=[[Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences]] |volume=852 |pages=197–204 |date=1998 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb09873.x |bibcode=1998NYASA.852..197T |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamental concepts ==
Conventional electronics have traditionally been made from bulk materials.  Ever since their invention in 1958, the performance and complexity of [[integrated circuit]]s has undergone [[exponential growth]], a trend named [[Moore’s law]], as feature sizes of the embedded components have shrunk accordingly. As the structures shrink, the sensitivity to deviations increases. In a few technology generations, when the minimum feature sizes reaches 13&amp;nbsp;nm, the composition of the devices must be controlled to a precision of a few atoms&lt;ref name=concepts&gt;{{cite book |last=Waser |first=Rainer |author2=Lüssem, B. |author3=Bjørnholm, T. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Nanotechnology. Volume 4: Information Technology II|chapter=Chapter 8: Concepts in Single-Molecule Electronics|publisher=Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA|date=2008|location=Weinheim |pages=175–212 |isbn=978-3-527-31737-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
for the devices to work.  With bulk methods growing increasingly demanding and costly as they near inherent limits, the idea was born that the components could instead be built up atom by atom in a chemistry lab (bottom up) versus carving them out of bulk material ([[Top-down and bottom-up design|top down]]).  This is the idea behind molecular electronics, with the ultimate miniaturization being components contained in single molecules.

In single-molecule electronics, the bulk material is replaced by single molecules.  Instead of forming structures by removing or applying material after a pattern scaffold, the atoms are put together in a chemistry lab.  In this way, billions of billions of copies are made simultaneously (typically more than 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; molecules are made at once) while the composition of molecules are controlled down to the last atom.  The molecules used have properties that resemble traditional electronic components such as a [[wire]], [[transistor]] or [[rectifier]].

Single-molecule electronics is an emerging field, and entire electronic circuits consisting exclusively of molecular sized compounds are still very far from being realized.  However, the unceasing demand for more computing power, along with the inherent limits of lithographic methods {{as of|2016|lc=y}}, make the transition seem unavoidable.  Currently, the focus is on discovering molecules with interesting properties and on finding ways to obtain reliable and reproducible contacts between the molecular components and the bulk material of the electrodes.

==Theoretical basis==
Molecular electronics operates in the [[quantum realm]] of distances less than 100 nanometers. The miniaturization down to single molecules brings the scale down to a regime where [[quantum mechanics]] effects are important. In conventional electronic components, [[electron]]s can be filled in or drawn out more or less like a continuous flow of [[electric charge]]. In contrast, in molecular electronics the transfer of one electron alters the system significantly. For example, when an electron has been transferred from a source electrode to a molecule, the molecule gets charged up, which makes it far harder for the next electron to transfer (see also [[Coulomb blockade]]). The significant amount of energy due to charging must be accounted for when making calculations about the electronic properties of the setup, and is highly sensitive to distances to conducting surfaces nearby.

The theory of single-molecule devices is especially interesting since the system under consideration is an open quantum system in [[nonequilibrium]] (driven by voltage).  In the low bias voltage regime, the nonequilibrium nature of the molecular junction can be ignored, and the current-voltage traits of the device can be calculated using the equilibrium electronic structure of the system. However, in stronger bias regimes a more sophisticated treatment is required, as there is no longer a [[variational principle]]. In the elastic tunneling case (where the passing electron does not exchange energy with the system), the formalism of [[Rolf Landauer]] can be used to calculate the transmission through the system as a function of bias voltage, and hence the current.  In inelastic tunneling, an elegant formalism based on the non-equilibrium [[Green's function]]s of [[Leo Kadanoff]] and [[Gordon Baym]], and independently by [[Leonid Keldysh]] was advanced by [[Ned Wingreen]] and [[Yigal Meir]]. This Meir-Wingreen formulation has been used to great success in the molecular electronics community to examine the more difficult and interesting cases where the transient electron exchanges energy with the molecular system (for example through electron-phonon coupling or electronic excitations).

Further, connecting single molecules reliably to a larger scale circuit has proven a great challenge, and constitutes a significant hindrance to commercialization.

==Examples==
Common for molecules used in molecular electronics is that the structures contain many alternating double and single bonds (see also [[Conjugated system]]). This is done because such patterns delocalize the molecular orbitals, making it possible for electrons to move freely over the conjugated area.

===Wires===
[[File:Kohlenstoffnanoroehre Animation.gif|thumb|This animation of a rotating carbon nanotube shows its 3D structure.]]

The sole purpose of [[molecular wire]]s is to electrically connect different parts of a molecular electrical circuit. As the assembly of these and their connection to a macroscopic circuit is still not mastered, the focus of research in single-molecule electronics is primarily on the functionalized molecules: molecular wires are characterized by containing no [[functional group]]s and are hence composed of plain repetitions of a conjugated building block. Among these are the [[carbon nanotube]]s that are quite large compared to the other suggestions but have shown very promising electrical properties.

The main problem with the molecular wires is to obtain good electrical contact with the electrodes so that electrons can move freely in and out of the wire.

===Transistors===
Single-molecule [[transistor]]s are fundamentally different from the ones known from bulk electronics. The gate in a conventional (field-effect) transistor determines the conductance between the source and drain electrode by controlling the density of charge carriers between them, whereas the gate in a single-molecule transistor controls the possibility of a single electron to jump on and off the molecule by modifying the energy of the molecular orbitals. One of the effects of this difference is that the single-molecule transistor is almost binary: it is either ''on'' or ''off''. This opposes its bulk counterparts, which have quadratic responses to gate voltage.

It is the quantization of charge into electrons that is responsible for the markedly different behavior compared to bulk electronics. Because of the size of a single molecule, the charging due to a single electron is significant and provides means to turn a transistor ''on'' or ''off'' (see [[Coulomb blockade]]). For this to work, the electronic orbitals on the transistor molecule cannot be too well integrated with the orbitals on the electrodes. If they are, an electron cannot be said to be located on the molecule or the electrodes and the molecule will function as a wire.

A popular group of molecules, that can work as the [[semiconducting]] channel material in a molecular transistor, is the oligopolyphenylenevinylenes (OPVs) that works by the Coulomb blockade mechanism when placed between the source and drain electrode in an appropriate way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kubatkin |first=S. |title=Single-electron transistor of a single organic molecule with access to several redox states |journal=Nature |volume=425 |pages=698–701 |date=2003 |doi=10.1038/nature02010 |pmid=14562098 |issue=6959|bibcode=2003Natur.425..698K |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fullerene]]s work by the same mechanism and have also been commonly used.
 
Semiconducting carbon nanotubes have also been demonstrated to work as channel material but although molecular, these molecules are sufficiently large to behave almost as bulk [[semiconductor]]s.

The size of the molecules, and the low temperature of the measurements being conducted, makes the quantum mechanical states well defined. Thus, it is being researched if the quantum mechanical properties can be used for more advanced purposes than simple transistors (e.g. [[spintronics]]).

Physicists at the [[University of Arizona]], in collaboration with chemists from the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]], have designed a single-molecule transistor using a ring-shaped molecule similar to [[benzene]]. Physicists at Canada's [[National Institute for Nanotechnology]] have designed a single-molecule transistor using styrene. Both groups expect (the designs were experimentally unverified {{as of|2005|06|lc=y}}) their respective devices to function at room temperature, and to be controlled by a single electron.&lt;ref&gt; Anderson, Mark (2005-06-09) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090625140343/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2005/06/67769 "Honey, I Shrunk the PC"].

===Rectifiers (diodes)===
[[File:Dehydrogenation of H2TPP by STM.jpg|thumb|300px|Hydrogen can be removed from individual [[tetraphenylporphyrin]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP) molecules by applying excess voltage to the tip of a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STAM, a); this removal alters the current-voltage (I-V) curves of TPP molecules, measured using the same STM tip, from [[diode]]-like (red curve in b) to [[resistor]]-like (green curve). Image (c) shows a row of TPP, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP and TPP molecules. While scanning image (d), excess voltage was applied to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP at the black dot, which instantly removed hydrogen, as shown in the bottom part of (d) and in the re-scan image (e). Such manipulations can be used in single-molecule electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/srep08350|pmid=25666850 |pmc=4322354 |title=N and p type character of single molecule diodes |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=5 |pages=8350 |year=2015 |author1=Zoldan, Vinícius Claudio |author2=Faccio, Ricardo |author3=Pasa, André Avelino  |lastauthoramp=yes |bibcode=2015NatSR...5E8350Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Molecular [[rectifier]]s are mimics of their bulk counterparts and have an asymmetric construction so that the molecule can accept electrons in one end but not the other. The molecules have an [[electron donor]] (D) in one end and an [[electron acceptor]] (A) in the other. This way, the unstable state D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; – A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; will be more readily made than D&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; – A&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The result is that an [[electric current]] can be drawn through the molecule if the electrons are added through the acceptor end, but less easily if the reverse is attempted.

==Methods==
One of the biggest problems with measuring on single molecules is to establish reproducible electrical contact with only one molecule and doing so without shortcutting the electrodes. Because the current [[photolithographic]] technology is unable to produce electrode gaps small enough to contact both ends of the molecules tested (on the order of nanometers), alternative strategies are applied.

===Molecular gaps===
One way to produce electrodes with a molecular sized gap between them is break junctions, in which a thin electrode is stretched until it breaks. Another is [[electromigration]]. Here a current is led through a thin wire until it melts and the atoms migrate to produce the gap. Further, the reach of conventional photolithography can be enhanced by chemically etching or depositing metal on the electrodes.

Probably the easiest way to conduct measurements on several molecules is to use the tip of a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM) to contact molecules adhered at the other end to a metal substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gimzewski |first=J.K. |author2=Joachim, C. |title=Nanoscale science of single molecules using local probes |journal=Science |volume=283 |pages=1683–1688 |date=1999 |doi=10.1126/science.283.5408.1683 |pmid=10073926 |issue=5408|bibcode=1999Sci...283.1683G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anchoring===
A popular way to anchor molecules to the electrodes is to make use of [[sulfur]]'s high [[chemical affinity]] to [[gold]]. In these setups, the molecules are [[Organic synthesis|synthesized]] so that sulfur atoms are placed strategically to function as [[crocodile clip]]s connecting the molecules to the gold electrodes. Though useful, the anchoring is non-specific and thus anchors the molecules randomly to all gold surfaces. Further, the [[contact resistance]] is highly dependent on the precise atomic geometry around the site of anchoring and thereby inherently compromises the reproducibility of the connection.

To circumvent the latter issue, experiments has shown that [[fullerene]]s could be a good candidate for use instead of sulfur because of the large conjugated π-system that can electrically contact many more atoms at once than one atom of sulfur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isis.ku.dk/kurser/index.aspx?kursusid=25537&amp;xslt=simple6&amp;param1=140150&amp;param8=false Sørensen, J.K.]. (2006). "Synthesis of new components, functionalized with (60)fullerene, for molecular electronics". 4th Annual meeting – CONT 2006, University of Copenhagen.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fullerene nanoelectronics===
In [[polymer]]s, classical organic molecules are composed of both carbon and hydrogen (and sometimes additional compounds such as nitrogen, chlorine or sulphur). They are obtained from petrol and can often be synthesized in large amounts. Most of these molecules are insulating when their length exceeds a few nanometers. However, naturally occurring carbon is conducting, especially graphite recovered from coal or encountered otherwise. From a theoretical viewpoint, [[graphite]] is a [[semi-metal]], a category in between metals and semi-conductors. It has a layered structure, each sheet being one atom thick. Between each sheet, the interactions are weak enough to allow an easy manual cleavage.

Tailoring the [[graphite]] sheet to obtain well defined nanometer-sized objects remains a challenge. However, by the close of the twentieth century, chemists were exploring methods to fabricate extremely small graphitic objects that could be considered single molecules. After studying the interstellar conditions under which carbon is known to form clusters, [[Richard Smalley]]'s group (Rice University, Texas) set up an experiment in which graphite was vaporized via laser irradiation. Mass spectrometry revealed that clusters containing specific ''magic numbers'' of atoms were stable, especially those clusters of 60 atoms. [[Harry Kroto]], an English chemist who assisted in the experiment, suggested a possible geometry for these clusters – atoms covalently bound with the exact symmetry of a soccer ball. Coined [[buckminsterfullerene]]s, buckyballs, or C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;, the clusters retained some properties of graphite, such as conductivity. These objects were rapidly envisioned as possible building blocks for molecular electronics.

==Problems==

===Artifacts===
When trying to measure electronic traits of molecules, artificial phenomena can occur that can be hard to distinguish from truly molecular behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Service |first=R.F. |title=Molecular electronics – Next-generation technology hits an early midlife crisis |journal=Science |volume=302 |pages=556–+ |date=2003 |doi=10.1126/science.302.5645.556 |pmid=14576398 |issue=5645}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before they were discovered, these artifacts have mistakenly been published as being features pertaining to the molecules in question.

Applying a voltage drop on the order of volts across a nanometer sized junction results in a very strong electrical field. The field can cause metal atoms to migrate and eventually close the gap by a thin filament, which can be broken again when carrying a current. The two levels of conductance imitate molecular switching between a conductive and an isolating state of a molecule.

Another encountered artifact is when the electrodes undergo chemical reactions due to the high field strength in the gap. When the [[voltage bias]] is reversed, the reaction will cause [[hysteresis]] in the measurements that can be interpreted as being of molecular origin.

A metallic grain between the electrodes can act as a single electron transistor by the mechanism described above, thus resembling the traits of a molecular transistor. This artifact is especially common with nanogaps produced by the electromigration method.

===Commercialization===
One of the biggest hindrances for single-molecule electronics to be commercially exploited is the lack of methods to connect a molecular sized circuit to bulk electrodes in a way that gives reproducible results. At the current state, the difficulty of connecting single molecules vastly outweighs any possible performance increase that could be gained from such shrinkage. The difficulties grow worse if the molecules are to have a certain spatial orientation and/or have multiple poles to connect.

Also problematic is that some measurements on single molecules are carried out in [[Cryogenics|cryogenic temperatures]] (near absolute zero), which is very energy consuming. This is done to reduce [[signal noise]] enough to measure the faint currents of single molecules.

==History and recent progress==
[[File:Rotaxane cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|Graphical representation of a [[rotaxane]], useful as a molecular switch.]]

In their treatment of so-called ''donor-acceptor'' complexes in the 1940s, [[Robert Mulliken]] and [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] advanced the concept of charge transfer in molecules. They subsequently further refined the study of both charge transfer and energy transfer in molecules. Likewise, a 1974 paper from [[Mark Ratner]] and Ari Aviram illustrated a theoretical molecular [[rectifier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0009-2614(74)85031-1 |bibcode=1974CPL....29..277A |title=Molecular rectifiers |journal=Chemical Physics Letters |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=277–283 |year=1974 |last1=Aviram |first1=Arieh |last2=Ratner |first2=Mark A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, Aviram described in detail a theoretical single-molecule [[field-effect transistor]]. Further concepts were proposed by Forrest Carter of the [[Naval Research Laboratory]], including single-molecule [[logic gate]]s. A wide range of ideas were presented, under his aegis, at a conference entitled ''Molecular Electronic Devices'' in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, F. L.; Siatkowski, R. E. and Wohltjen, H. (eds.) (1988) ''Molecular Electronic Devices'', pp. 229–244, North Holland, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt;  These were all theoretical constructs and not concrete devices. The ''direct'' measurement of the electronic traits of individual molecules awaited the development of methods for making molecular-scale electrical contacts. This was no easy task. Thus, the first experiment directly-measuring the conductance of a single molecule was only reported in 1995 on a single C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; molecule by C. Joachim and J. K. Gimzewsky in their seminal Physical Revie Letter paper and later in 1997 by Mark Reed and co-workers on a few hundred molecules. Since then, this branch of the field has advanced rapidly. Likewise, as it has grown possible to measure such properties directly, the theoretical predictions of the early workers have been confirmed substantially.

Recent progress in [[nanotechnology]] and nanoscience has facilitated both experimental and theoretical study of molecular electronics. Development of the [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM) and later the [[atomic force microscope]] (AFM) have greatly facilitated manipulating single-molecule electronics. Also, theoretical advances in molecular electronics have facilitated further understanding of non-adiabatic charge transfer events at electrode-electrolyte interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/jp8090045|title=Mechanisms of Charge Transport through Monolayer-Modified Polycrystalline Gold Electrodes in the Absence of Redox-Active Moieties|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry C|volume=113|issue=11|pages=4687–4705|year=2009|last1=Gupta|first1=Chaitanya|last2=Shannon|first2=Mark A.|last3=Kenis|first3=Paul J.

A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of molecular electronics was first published in 1974 when Aviram and Ratner suggested an organic molecule that could work as a rectifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aviram |first=Arieh |author2=Ratner, M.A. |title=Molecular rectifiers |journal=Chemical Physics Letters |volume=29 |pages=277–283 |date=1974 |doi=10.1016/0009-2614(74)85031-1 |bibcode=1974CPL....29..277A |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Having both huge commercial and fundamental interest, much effort was put into proving its feasibility, and 16 years later in 1990, the first demonstration of an intrinsic molecular rectifier was realized by Ashwell and coworkers for a thin film of molecules.

The first measurement of the conductance of a single molecule was realised in 1994 by C. Joachim and J. K. Gimzewski and published in 1995 (see the corresponding Phys. Rev. Lett. paper). This was the conclusion of 10 years of research started at IBM TJ Watson, using the scanning tunnelling microscope tip apex to switch a single molecule as already explored by A. Aviram, C. Joachim and M. Pomerantz at the end of the 80's (see their seminal Chem. Phys. Lett. paper during this period). The trick was to use an UHV Scanning Tunneling microscope to allow the tip apex to gently touch the top of a single {{chem|C|60}} molecule adsorbed on an Au(110) surface. A resistance of 55 MOhms was recorded along with a low voltage linear I-V. The contact was certified by recording the I-z current distance property, which allows measurement of the deformation of the {{chem|C|60}} cage under contact.  This first experiment was followed by the reported result using a mechanical break junction method to connect two gold electrodes to a sulfur-terminated [[molecular wire]] by [[Mark Reed (physicist)|Mark Reed]] and [[James Tour]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reed|first=M.A. |title=Conductance of a Molecular Junction |journal=Science |volume=287 |pages=252–254 |date=1997 |doi=10.1126/science.278.5336.252 |issue=5336|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A single-molecule amplifier was implemented by C. Joachim and J.K. Gimzewski in IBM Zurich. This experiment, involving one {{chem|C|60}} molecule, demonstrated that one such molecule can provide gain in a circuit via intramolecular quantum interference effects alone.

A collaboration of researchers at [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) and [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA), led by James Heath, Fraser Stoddart, R. Stanley Williams, and Philip Kuekes, has developed molecular electronics based on [[rotaxane]]s and [[catenane]]s.

Work is also occurring on the use of single-wall carbon nanotubes as field-effect transistors. Most of this work is being done by International Business Machines ([[IBM]]).

Some specific reports of a [[field-effect transistor]] based on molecular [[self-assembled monolayer]]s were shown to be fraudulent in 2002 as part of the [[Schön scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jacoby|first=Mitch|title=Molecule-based circuitry revisited|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/topstory/8104/8104notw1.html|accessdate=24 February 2011|newspaper=Chemical and Engineering News|date=27 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently entirely theoretical, the Aviram-Ratner model for a [[unimolecular rectifier]] has been confirmed unambiguously in experiments by a group led by Geoffrey J. Ashwell at [[Bangor University]], UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ashwell |first1=Geoffrey J. |last2=Hamilton |first2=Richard |last3=High |first3=L. R.

[[Supramolecular electronics]] is a new field involving electronics at a [[supramolecular chemistry|supramolecular]] level.

An important issue in molecular electronics is the determination of the resistance of a single molecule (both theoretical and experimental). For example, Bumm, et al. used STM to analyze a single molecular switch in a [[self-assembled monolayer]] to determine how conductive such a molecule can be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bumm |first1=L. A. |last2=Arnold |first2=J. J. |last3=Cygan |first3=M. T. |last4=Dunbar |first4=T. D. |last5=Burgin |first5=T. P. |last6=Jones |first6=L. |last7=Allara |first7=D. L. |last8=Tour |first8=J.

'''Neutron-induced swelling''' is the increase of volume and decrease of [[density]] of materials subjected to intense [[neutron radiation]]. Neutrons impacting the material's lattice rearrange its atoms, causing buildup of [[dislocation]]s, [[Vacancy defect|void]]s, and [[Wigner energy]]. Together with the resulting strength reduction and [[embrittlement]], it is a major concern for materials for [[nuclear reactor]]s.

Materials show significant differences in their swelling resistance.

'''Operation Ruthless''' was the name of a deception operation devised by [[Ian Fleming]] in the British [[Admiralty]] during [[World War II]], in an attempt to gain access to [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#German naval Enigma|German Naval Enigma]] [[codebooks]].

==Background==
With the help of their [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Polish disclosures|Polish allies]], British codebreakers at [[Bletchley Park]] had considerable success in decoding the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]]-enciphered traffic of the German air force, army and intelligence and counter-espionage service (''Abwehr''), but had made little progress with German naval messages. The methods of communicating the choice and starting positions, of [[Rotor machine#The Enigma machine|Enigma's rotors]], the ''[[Enigma machine#Indicator|indicator]]'', were much more complex for naval messages.  In 1940 [[Dilly Knox]], the veteran [[World War I]] codebreaker, [[Francis Birch (cryptographer)|Frank Birch]], head of Bletchley Park's German Naval Department, and the two leading codebreakers, [[Alan Turing]] and [[Peter Twinn]] knew that getting hold of the German Navy Enigma documentation was their best chance of making progress in breaking the code.&lt;ref name=SinghS &gt;{{Citation | last = Singh | first = Simon | author-link = Simon Singh | publication-date = 1999 | title = [[The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography]] | publication-place = London | publisher = Fourth Estate | pages = 143–189 | isbn = 1-85702-879-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal Navy|Royal Navy's]] Operational Intelligence Centre (OIC) was a leading user of [[Ultra]] intelligence from Bletchley Park's [[decrypt]]s. [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Ian Fleming]] of the [[Admiralty|Admiralty's]] Naval Intelligence Division, who later wrote the [[James Bond]] novels, was the personal assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence, [[John Henry Godfrey|Rear Admiral John Godfrey]]. Fleming liaised with the naval department at Bletchley Park, visiting about twice a month, and was well aware of this problem.&lt;ref name=BateyM&gt;{{ citation | last = Batey | first = Mavis | author-link = Mavis Batey | title = From Bletchley with love | year = 2008 | publisher = Bletchley Park Trust | isbn = 978-1-906723-04-0 | pages = 2–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The plan==
In September, Fleming wrote a note to Godfrey which read:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I suggest we obtain the loot by the following means:&lt;br /&gt;
1.    Obtain from Air Ministry an air-worthy German bomber.&lt;br /&gt;
2.    Pick a tough crew of five, including a pilot, W/T operator and word-perfect German speaker.   Dress them in German Air Force uniform, add blood and bandages to suit.&lt;br /&gt;
3.    Crash plane in the Channel after making S.O.S. to rescue service in P/L.&lt;br /&gt;
4.    Once aboard rescue boat, shoot German crew, dump overboard, bring rescue boat back to English port.&lt;br /&gt;
In order to increase the chances of capturing an R. or M. with, its richer booty, the crash might be staged in mid-Channel.  The Germans would presumably employ one of this type for the longer and more hazardous journey.

F.      12.9-40.&lt;ref name=BateyM /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The plan was that the German bomber would follow on behind aircraft returning from a night bombing raid. When crossing the middle of the [[English Channel]], it would cut one engine and lose height with smoke pouring from a 'candle' in the tail, send out a [[SOS]] distress signal and then ditch in the sea. The crew would then take to a [[Inflatable boat|rubber dinghy]], having ensured that the bomber sank before the Germans could identify it, and wait to be rescued by a German naval vessel. When on board the 'survivors' would then kill the German crew, and hijack the ship, thus obtaining the Enigma documentation.&lt;ref name=SmithM &gt;{{citation | last = Smith  | first = Michael |title = Station X: The Codebreakers of Bletchley Park |edition = Pan Books |series = Pan Grand Strategy Series |year = 2007 |origyear = 1998 |publisher = Pan McMillan Ltd |location = London |isbn = 978-0-330-41929-1 | pages = 70–71  | author-link = Michael Smith (newspaper reporter) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Heinkel 111]] was available for this operation. The aircraft, ''Werk Nr.'' 6853, had been captured in airworthy condition after being operated by the German bomber unit, [[Kampfgeschwader 26]]. On 9 February 1940, it had made a forced landing near [[North Berwick Law]] after being damaged by a Spitfire over the [[Firth of Forth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=22391 | title=ASN Wikibase Occurrence # 22391 | publisher=Aviation Safety Network | accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently assigned the Royal Air Force serial number ''AW177'' and flown by the RAF's [[Air Fighting Development Unit]] and [[No. 1426 Flight RAF|1426 Flight]].

Fleming had proposed himself as one of the crew but, as someone who knew about Bletchley Park, he could not be placed at risk of being captured. The aircraft was prepared with an aircrew of German-speaking Englishmen. The operation was planned for the early part of the month because it was known that the code sheets were changed at the start of each month.&lt;ref name=SinghS /&gt;

==Outcome==
Fleming took his team to [[Dover]] to await the next suitable bombing raid, but [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[wireless telegraphy]] monitoring failed to find any suitable German vessels, and the operation was called off.&lt;ref name=SmithM /&gt; That this was a major disappointment to the codebreakers can be judged by what [[Francis Birch (cryptographer)|Frank Birch]] wrote in a letter dated 20 October 1940.

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Alan Turing|Turing]] and [[Peter Twinn|Twinn]] came to me like undertakers cheated of a nice corpse two days ago, all in a stew about the cancellation of operation Ruthless. The burden of their song was the importance of a pinch.&lt;ref name=BateyM /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An alternative account of why the operation did not take place was given when his niece, Lucy Fleming, visited his old office in the Admiralty. ''The Bond Correspondence'', a [[BBC Radio 4]] radio programme broadcast on 24 May 2008, includes an interview there. Her subject in the Admiralty says that the idea was that the Germans would see the floating bomber and the "survivors" and send out a rescue vessel; but someone at the [[RAF]] pointed out that a downed Heinkel bomber would sink rather than float.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00bfczy BBC Radio 4 Web site: The Bond Correspondence, programme.] Last broadcast Sat 28 Mar 2015 02:30 BBC Radio 4 Extra.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20546">'''Organic semiconductors''' are solids whose building blocks are [[pi-bond]]ed [[molecule]]s or [[polymer]]s made up by [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]] atoms and – at times – [[heteroatom]]s such as [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]] and [[oxygen]]. They exist in form of [[molecular crystal]]s or amorphous [[thin films]]. In general, they are [[electrical insulator]]s, but become [[semiconducting]] when charges are either injected from appropriate [[electrode]]s, upon [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]] or by [[photoexcitation]].

== General properties ==
In molecular crystals the energetic separation between the top of the [[valence band]] and the bottom [[conduction band]], i.e. the [[band gap]], is typically 2.5–4&amp;nbsp;eV, while in inorganic [[semiconductor]]s the band gaps are typically 1–2&amp;nbsp;eV. This implies that they are, in fact, insulators rather than semiconductors in the conventional sense. They become semiconducting only when [[charge carrier]]s are either injected from the electrodes or generated by intentional or unintentional doping. Charge carriers can also be generated in the course of [[optical excitation]]. It is important to realize, however, that the primary optical excitations are neutral [[exciton]]s with a [[Coulomb]]-binding energy of typically 0.5–1.0&amp;nbsp;eV. The reason is that in organic semiconductors their [[dielectric constant]]s are as low as 3–4. This impedes efficient photogeneration of charge carriers in neat systems in the bulk. Efficient photogeneration can only occur in binary systems due to [[Charge-transfer complex|charge transfer]] between donor and acceptor moieties. Otherwise neutral excitons decay radiatively to the ground state – thereby emitting photoluminescence – or non-radiatively. The optical [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] edge of organic semiconductors is typically 1.7–3&amp;nbsp;eV, equivalent to a spectral range from 700 to 400&amp;nbsp;nm (which corresponds to the visible spectrum).

In 1862, [[Henry Letheby]] obtained a partly conductive material by anodic oxidation of [[aniline]] in sulfuric acid. The material was probably polyaniline.&lt;ref name=nobel&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2000/chemadv.pdf The Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 2000: [[Conductive polymers]]], nobelprize.org.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, researchers discovered that polycyclic aromatic compounds formed semi-conducting [[charge-transfer complex]] salts with halogens. In particular, high conductivity of 0.12&amp;nbsp;S/cm was reported in [[perylene]]–[[iodine]] [[Coordination complex|complex]] in 1954.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Herbert Naarmann "Polymers, Electrically Conducting" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002 Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a21_429}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This finding indicated that organic compounds could carry current.

The fact that organic semiconductors are, in principle, insulators but become semiconducting when charge carriers are injected from the electrode(s) was discovered by Kallmann and Pope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bulk Conductivity in Organic Crystals|last1=Kallmann|last2=Pope|journal=Nature|volume=186|issue=4718|pages=31|year=1960|bibcode = 1960Natur.186...31K |doi = 10.1038/186031a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Positive Hole Injection Into Organic Crystals|last1=Kallmann|last2=Pope|journal=J. Chem. Phys. |volume=32|issue=1|pages=300|year=1960|bibcode = 1960JChPh..32..300K |doi = 10.1063/1.1700925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that a hole current can flow through an [[anthracene]] crystal contacted with a positively biased electrolyte containing iodine that can act as a hole injector. This work was stimulated by the earlier discovery by Akamatu et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Organic Semiconductors with High Conductivity. 1. Complexes Between Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Halogens|last1=Akamatu|last2=Inokuchi|last3=Matsunage|journal=Bull.Chem.Soc.Jap.|volume=29|issue=2|pages=213|year=1956|doi=10.1246/bcsj.29.213}}&lt;/ref&gt; that aromatic hydrocarbons become conductive when blended with molecular iodine because a charge-transfer complex is formed. Since it was readily realized that the crucial parameter that controls injection is the [[work function]] of the electrode, it was straightforward to replace the electrolyte by a solid metallic or semiconducting contact with an appropriate work function. When both electrons and holes are injected from opposite contacts, they can recombine radiatively and emit light ([[electroluminescence]]). It was observed in organic crystals in 1965 by Sano et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Electroluminescence and Band Gap in Anthracene|last1=Sano|last2=Pope|last3=Kallmann|journal=J. Chem. Phys. |volume=43|issue=8|pages=2920|year=1965|doi=10.1063/1.1697243|bibcode=1965JChPh..43.2920S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, researchers found metallic conductivity in the charge-transfer complex TTF-TCNQ. [[Superconductivity]] in charge-transfer complexes was first reported in the [[Bechgaard salt]] (TMTSF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1051/jphyslet:0198000410409500|title= Superconductivity in a synthetic organic conductor (TMTSF)2PF 6|year= 1980|last1= Jérome|first1= D.|last2= Mazaud|first2= A.|last3= Ribault|first3= M.|last4= Bechgaard|first4= K.|journal= Journal de Physique Lettres|volume= 41|issue= 4|pages= 95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 Dr. [[John McGinness]] produced the first device incorporating an organic semiconductor. This occurred roughly eight years before the next such device was created. The "[[melanin]] ([[polyacetylenes]]) bistable switch" currently is part of the chips collection of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=John McGinness,|last2=Corry|first2=Peter|last3=Proctor|first3=Peter|title=Amorphous Semiconductor Switching in Melanins|journal=Science|date=March 1, 1974|volume=183|issue=4127|pages=853–855|jstor=1737211|accessdate=|doi=10.1126/science.183.4127.853|bibcode=1974Sci...183..853M}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Gadget128.jpg|thumb|An organic polymer voltage-controlled switch from 1974. Now in the Smithsonian Chip collection]]

In 1977, Shirakawa ''et al.'' reported high conductivity in oxidized and iodine-doped polyacetylene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/C39770000578|title=Synthesis of electrically conducting organic polymers: halogen derivatives of polyacetylene, (CH) x|year=1977|last1=Shirakawa|first1=Hideki|last2=Louis|first2=Edwin J.|last3=MacDiarmid|first3=Alan G.|last4=Chiang|first4=Chwan K.|last5=Heeger|first5=Alan J.|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Chemical Communications|issue=16|pages=578}}&lt;/ref&gt; They received the 2000 Nobel prize in Chemistry for "The discovery and development of [[conductive polymers]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2000/index.html |title=Chemistry 2000 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |accessdate=2010-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, highly conductive polypyrrole was rediscovered in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/C39790000635|title=Electrochemical polymerization of pyrrole|year=1979|last1=Diaz|first1=A. F.|last2=Kanazawa|first2=K. Keiji|last3=Gardini|first3=Gian Piero|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Chemical Communications|issue=14|pages=635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rigid-backbone organic semiconductors are now used as active elements in [[optoelectronics|optoelectronic]] devices such as [[organic light-emitting diode]]s (OLED), [[organic solar cell]]s, [[organic field-effect transistor]]s (OFET), electrochemical transistors and recently in biosensing applications.  Organic semiconductors have many advantages, such as easy fabrication, mechanical flexibility, and low cost.

The discovery by Kallman and Pope paved the way for applying organic solids as active elements in semiconducting electronic devices, such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) that rely on the recombination of electrons and hole injected from "ohmic" electrodes, i.e. electrodes with unlimited supply of charge carriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Recombination Radiation in Anthracene Crystals|last1=Sano|last2=Pope|last3=Kallmann|journal=J. Chem. Phys. |volume=14|issue=7|pages=229|year=1965|doi=10.1103/physrevlett.14.229|bibcode=1965PhRvL..14..229H}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next major step towards the technological exploitation of the phenomenon of electron and hole injection into a non-crystalline organic semiconductor was the work by Tang and Van Slyke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Organic Luminescent Diodes|last1=Tang|last2=Van Slyke|journal=Appl. Phys. Lett.|volume=51|issue=12|pages=913|year=1987|doi=10.1063/1.98799|bibcode=1987ApPhL..51..913T}}&lt;/ref&gt; They showed that efficient electroluminescence can be generated in a vapor-deposited thin amorphous bilayer of an aromatic diamine (TAPC) and Alq3 sandwiched between an indium-tin-oxide (ITO) anode and an Mg:Ag cathode. Another milestone towards the development or organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) was the recognition that also conjugated polymers can be used as active materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Light-Emitting Diodes Based on Conjugated Polymers|last1=Burroughes|last2=Bradly|last3=Brown|journal=Nature|volume=348|issue=6293|pages=539|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efficiency of OLEDs was greatly improved when realizing that phosphorescent states ([[Triplet state|triplet]] excitons) may be used for emission when doping an organic semiconductor matrix with a phosphorescent dye, such as complexes of iridium with strong [[spin–orbit coupling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Measuring the efficiency of organic light-emitting devices|last1=Forrest|last2=Bradley|last3=Thompson|journal=Adv. Mater.|volume=15|issue=13|pages=1043|year=2003|doi=10.1002/adma.200302151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on conductivity of anthracene crystals contacted with an electrolyte showed that optically excited dye molecules adsorbed at the surface of the crystal inject charge carriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Surface-Controlled Bulk Conductivity in Organic Crystals|last1=Kallmann|last2=Pope|journal=Nature|volume=185|issue=4715|pages=753|year=1960|bibcode = 1960Natur.185..753K |doi = 10.1038/185753a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying phenomenon is called sensitized photoconductivity. It occurs when photo-exciting a dye molecule with appropriate oxidation/reduction potential adsorbed at the surface or incorporated in the bulk. This effect revolutionized electrophotography, which is the technological basis of today’s office copying machines.&lt;ref name="Borsenberg"&gt;{{cite book|title=Organic Photoreceptors for Xerography|last1=Borsenberger|last2=Weiss|year=1998|publisher=Marcel Dekker Inc. New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the basis of [[organic solar cell]]s (OSCs), in which the active element is an electron donor, and an electron acceptor material is combined in a bilayer or a bulk [[heterojunction]].

Doping with strong electron donor or acceptors can render organic solids conductive even in the absence of light. Examples are doped [[polyacetylene]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Solitons in Conducting Polymers|last1=Heeger|last2=Kivelson|last3=Schrieffer|journal=Rev. Mod. Phys.|volume=60|issue=3|pages=781|year=1988|bibcode = 1988RvMP...60..781H |doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.60.781 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and doped light-emitting diodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Highly efficient organic devices based on electrically doped transport layers|last1=Walzer|last2=Maennig|last3=Pfeifer|journal=Chem. Rev.|volume=107|issue=4|pages=1233|year=2007|doi=10.1021/cr050156n}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Today organic semiconductors are used as active elements in [[organic light-emitting diode]]s (OLEDs), [[organic solar cell]]s (OSCs) and [[organic field-effect transistor]]s (OFETs).

== Materials ==

=== Amorphous molecular films ===
Amorphous molecular films are produced by evaporation  or spin-coating.  They have been investigated for device applications such as OLEDs, OFETs, and OSCs. Illustrative  materials are [[tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminium]], C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), [[pentacene]], [[carbazole]]s, and [[phthalocyanine]].

=== Molecularly doped polymers ===
Molecularly doped polymers are prepared by spreading a film of an electrically inert polymer, e.g. polycarbonate, doped with typically 30% of charge transporting molecules, on  a base electrode. Typical materials are the [[triphenylene]]s. They have been investigated for use as photoreceptors in electrophotography.&lt;ref name="Borsenberg"/&gt; This requires films have a thickness of several micrometers that can be prepared using the doctor-blade technique.

=== Molecular crystals ===
In the early days of fundamental research into organic semiconductors the prototypical materials were free-standing single crystals of the acene family, e.g. anthracene and [[tetracene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electronic processes in organic crystals and polymers|last1=Pope|last2=Swenberg|year=1999|publisher=Oxford Science Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The advantage of employing molecular crystals instead of amorphous film is that their charge carrier mobilities are much larger. This is of particular advantage for OFET applications. Examples are thin films of crystalline rubrene prepared by hot wall epitaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Field-effect transistors on rubrene single crystals with parylene gate insulator|last1=Podzorov|last2=Pudalov|last3=Gershenson|journal=Appl. Phys. Lett.|volume=82|issue=11|pages=1739|year=2003|arxiv = cond-mat/0210555 |bibcode = 2003ApPhL..82.1739P |doi = 10.1063/1.1560869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Organic single-crystal field-effect transistors|last1=de Boer|last2=Gershenson|last3=Morpurgo|journal=Physica Status Solidi A|volume=201|issue=6|pages=1302|year=2004|doi=10.1002/pssa.200404336|arxiv=cond-mat/0404100|bibcode=2004PSSAR.201.1302D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neat polymer films ===
They are usually processed from solution employing variable deposition techniques including simple spin-coating, ink-jet deposition or industrial reel-to-reel coating which allows preparing thin films on a flexible substrate. The materials of choice are [[conjugated polymer]]s such as poly-thiophene, poly-phenylenevinylene, and copolymers of alternating donor and acceptor units such as members of the poly(carbazole-dithiophene-benzothiadiazole (PCDTBT) family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thermally stable, efficient polymer solar cells with nanoscale control of the interpenetrating network morphology|last1=Ma|last2=Yang|last3=Gong|journal=Adv. Funct. Mater.|volume=15|issue=10|pages=1617|year=2005|doi=10.1002/adfm.200500211}}&lt;/ref&gt; For solar cell applications they can be blended with C60 or PCBM are electron acceptors.

== Characterization ==
To design and characterize organic semiconductors used for optoelectronic applications one should first measure the absorption and photoluminescence spectra using commercial instrumentation. However, in order to find out if a material acts as an electron donor or acceptor one has to determine the energy levels for hole and electron transport. The easiest way of doing this, is to employ cyclic voltammetry. However, one has to take into account that using this technique the experimentally determined oxidation and reduction potential are lower bounds because in voltammetry the radical cations and anions are in a polar fluid solution and are, thus, solvated. Such a solvation effect is absent in a solid specimen. The relevant technique to energetically locate the hole transporting states in a solid sample is UV-photoemission spectroscopy. The equivalent technique for electron states is inverse photoemission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electronic Processes in organic semiconductors|last1=Köhler|last2=Bässler|year=2015|publisher=Wiley – VCH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several techniques to measure the mobility of charge carriers. The traditional technique is the so-called [[time of flight]] (TOF) method. Since this technique requires relatively thick samples it is not applicable to thin films. Alternatively, one can extract the charge carrier mobility from the current flowing in a field effect transistor as a function of both the source-drain and the gate voltage. One should be aware, though, that the FET-mobility is significantly larger than the TOF mobility because of the charge carrier concentration in the transport channel of a FET (see below). Other ways to determine the charge carrier mobility involves measuring space charge limited current (SCLC) flow and "carrier extraction by linearly increasing voltage (CELIV).&lt;ref name="AK_HB_CurrToCh"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Charge Transport in Organic Semiconductors|last1=Köhler|last2=Bässler|journal=Topics in Current Chemistry|volume=312|pages=1|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to characterize the morphology of semiconductor films, one can apply [[atomic force microscopy]] (AFM) [[scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM) and [[Grazing-incidence small-angle scattering]] (GISAS).

== Charge transport ==
In contrast to organic crystals investigated in the 1960-70’s, organic semiconductors that are nowadays used as active media in optoelectronic devices are usually more or less disordered. Combined with the fact that the structural building blocks are held together by comparatively weak van der Waals forces this precludes charge transport in delocalized valence and conduction bands. Instead, charge carriers are localized at molecular entities, e.g. oligomers or segments of a conjugated polymer chain and move by incoherent hopping among adjacent sites with statistically variable energies. Quite often the site energies feature a Gaussian distribution. Also the hopping distances can vary statistically (positional disorder). A consequence of the energetic broadening of the density of states (DOS) distribution is that charge motion is both temperature and field dependent and the charge carrier mobility can be several orders of magnitude lower than in an equivalent crystalline system. This disorder effect on charge carrier motion is diminished in organic field-effect transistors because current flow is confined in a thin layer. Therefore, the tail states of the DOS distribution are already filled so that the activation energy for charge carrier hopping is diminished. For this reason the charge carrier mobility inferred from FET experiments is always higher than that determined from TOF experiments.&lt;ref name="AK_HB_CurrToCh"/&gt;

In organic semiconductors charge carriers couple to vibrational modes and are referred to as polarons. Therefore, the activation energy for hopping motion contains an additional term due to structural site relaxation upon charging a molecular entity. It turns out, however, that usually the disorder contribution to the temperature dependence of the mobility dominates over the polaronic contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Unified description for hopping transport in organic semiconductors including both energetic disorder and polaronic contributions|last1=Fishchuk|journal=Phys. Rev. B|volume=88|pages=12|year=2013|doi=10.1103/physrevb.88.125202|bibcode=2013PhRvB..88l5202F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PSEG Kearny Peak across Hacky jeh.jpg|thumb|[[Kearny Generating Station]], a former coal-fired [[base load power plant]], now a gas-fired peaker, on the [[Hackensack River]] in New Jersey]]
'''Peaking power plants''', also known as '''peaker plants''', and occasionally just "peakers", are [[power plant]]s that generally run only when there is a high demand, known as [[peak demand]], for [[electricity]].&lt;ref&gt;Renewable and Efficient Electric Power Systems by Gilbert M. Masters&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opc.com/PoweringGeorgia/TypesofPowerPlants/PeakingPlants/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101220232/http://www.opc.com/PoweringGeorgia/TypesofPowerPlants/PeakingPlants/index.htm |archivedate=2009-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because they supply power only occasionally, the power supplied commands a much higher price per kilowatt hour than [[base load]] power. Peak load power plants [[Dispatchable generation|are dispatched]] in combination with [[base load power plant]]s, which supply a dependable and consistent amount of electricity, to meet the minimum demand.

==Peak hours==
Peak hours usually occur in the morning or late afternoon/evening depending on location. In temperate climates, peak hours often occur when household appliances are heavily used in the evening after work hours. In hot climates, the peak is usually late afternoon when [[air conditioning]] load is high, during this time many workplaces are still open and consuming power. In cold climates, the peak is in the morning when space heating and industry are both starting up.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=M0EnqtFxW3cC&amp;q=peak+time#v=snippet&amp;q=peak%20time&amp;f=false pg 284&lt;/ref&gt;

A peaker plant may operate many hours a day, or it may operate only a few hours per year, depending on the condition of the region's [[electrical grid]]. Because of the cost of building an efficient power plant, if a peaker plant is only going to be run for a short or highly variable time, it does not make economic sense to make it as efficient as a base load power plant. In addition, the equipment and fuels used in base load plants are often unsuitable for use in peaker plants because the fluctuating conditions would severely strain the equipment. For these reasons, [[nuclear power|nuclear]], [[geothermal power|geothermal]], [[waste-to-energy]], [[coal]] and [[biofuel|biomass]] are rarely, if ever, operated as peaker plants.
[[Image:Tagesgang engl.png|thumb|right|Power production in Germany during a day in 2005, without any solar and wind power]]

==Renewable Energy==
For countries that are trending [[Fossil fuel phase-out#Coal|away from coal fired]] baseload plants and towards [[intermittent energy source]]s such as wind and solar, there is a corresponding increase in the need for peaking or load following power plants and the use of a grid intertie.

==Types==
Peaker plants are generally [[gas turbine]]s that burn [[natural gas]]. A few burn [[biogas]] or [[petroleum]]-derived liquids, such as [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] oil and [[jet fuel]], but they are generally more expensive than natural gas, so their use is limited to areas not supplied with natural gas. However, many peaker plants are able to use petroleum as a backup fuel, as storing oil in tanks is easy. The [[thermodynamic efficiency]] of simple-cycle gas turbine power plants ranges from 20 to 42%, with between 30 and 42% being average for a new plant.

For greater efficiency, a [[heat recovery steam generator]] (HRSG) is added at the exhaust. This is known as a [[combined cycle]] plant. [[Cogeneration]] uses waste exhaust heat for process, [[district heating]] or other heating uses. Both of these options are used only in plants that are intended to be operated for longer periods than usual. Natural gas and [[diesel generator]]s with [[reciprocating engine]]s are sometimes used for [[Diesel generator#Grid support|grid support]] using smaller plants.

Another option for increased efficiency and power output in gas turbines is installing a [[Turbine Inlet Air Cooling|turbine inlet air cooling]] system, that cools down the inlet air temperature increasing mass flow ratio. This option, in combination with a [[thermal energy storage]] tank, can increase the turbine power output in on-peak periods up to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Enhancing gas turbine output through inlet air cooling. |publisher=Sudan Eng. Soc. J., 52(4-6): 7-14. |year=2006 |vauthors=Kamal NA, Zuhair AM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hydroelectric Dams''' are intentionally variable; they can generate less during off-peak and quickly respond to peak demands, consequently hydroelectricity may function as load following or a peaking plant and with sufficient water, a baseload plant. Natural gas turbines or pumped storage are often used where there is not enough hydroelectricity to respond to daily and weekly variations in generation and consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=18271 | title=California drought leads to less hydropower, increased natural gas generation - Today in Energy - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not unusual for a dam to be built with more capacity than can be sustained by the water supply, allowing for a higher peak output. Upgrading equipment at existing dams can be one of the least expensive ways of increasing peak generation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usbr.gov/power/edu/pamphlet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to vary the amount of electricity generated is often limited by the requirement that minimum or maximum flows downstream are satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://deq.nc.gov/instream-flow-unit | title=NC DEQ: Instream Flow Unit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity]]''' is the largest-capacity form of grid energy storage available, used for averaging off-peak and peak electrical demands. The site stores energy using the gravitational potential of water stored in a reservoir. Low-cost off-peak electric power from baseload or intermittent sources is used to pump water at a low elevation to storage in a high elevation reservoir. During periods of high electrical demand, the stored water is released through turbines to produce electric power. Start up times are only a few minutes, and some can start in a few tens of seconds.

'''[[Battery storage power station|Batteries]]''' are used in some cases where conditions favor it to smooth flow (avoiding a costly powerline upgrade) as well as supplying peak power&lt;ref name=gupta2016&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eqmagpro.com/mitsubishi-electric-delivers-high-capacity-energy-storage-system-to-kyushu-electric-powers-buzen-substation/ |title=Mitsubishi Electric Delivers High-capacity Energy-storage System to Kyushu Electric Power's Buzen Substation|work=EQ Int'l Magazine |date=4 March 2016|accessdate=24 January 2017|quote=The facility offers energy-storage capabilities similar to those of pumped hydro facilities while helping to improve the balance of supply and demand}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://electrek.co/2017/01/23/tesla-mira-loma-powerpack-station-southern-california-edison/ |title=Tesla quietly brings online its massive – biggest in the world – 80 MWh Powerpack station with Southern California Edison |first1=Fred|last1=Lambert |date=23 January 2017|work=Electrek |accessdate=24 January 2017 |quote=capacity of 20 MW/80 MWh . the system will charge using electricity from the grid during off-peak hours, when demand is low, and then deliver electricity during peak hours}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other grid services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.utilitydive.com/news/5-battery-energy-storage-projects-to-watch-in-2016/409624/ |title=5 battery energy storage projects to watch in 2016 |first1=Krysti |last1=Shallenberger |date=30 November 2015|work=Utility Dive|accessdate=24 January 2017|quote=manage demand during peak periods, provide reliable back-up power, and reduce their peak demand charges during the day.

Battery power is by far the fastest responding of all powerplants, and can respond to grid conditions at millisecond timescales, giving slower responding equipment a chance to react to outages.

Pumped-storage and batteries are net consumers, as they have no inherent energy source, and the conversion between electricity and storage and back incurs some losses.

'''Solar thermal peaker plants''' were proposed in 2017, under a US Department of Energy Technology 2 Market&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://energy.gov/eere/solar/technology-market|title=Technology to Market {{!}} Department of Energy|website=energy.gov|accessdate=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; award to Hank Price of SolarDynamics, whose paper Dispatchable Solar Power Plant&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.solarpaces.org/wp-content/uploads/Hank-Price-Dispatchable-Solar-Power-Plant-.pdf|title=Dispatchable Solar Power Plant|last=Price|first=Hank|date=|website=http://www.solarpaces.org|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  proposed utilizing the thermal energy storage inherent in a solar thermal energy power plant, that enables this heat-based form of solar to generate like a gas peaker, to supply dispatchable power on demand day or night, and in return be controlled by the utility and paid in capacity payments to be available when needed, like a traditional peaker. A solar thermal power plant makes electricity in a steam cycle power plant like a traditional power plant but the heat for steam is supplied by solar energy heating a material such as molten salts and storing the heat until needed to make steam for power generation.

==Base load power plants==
The opposites of peaking plants are [[base load power plant]]s. Nuclear and coal burning plants operate continuously, stopping only for maintenance or unexpected outages. Intermediate [[load following power plant]]s such as hydroelectric operate between these extremes, curtailing their output on nights and weekends when demand is low. Base load and intermediate plants are used preferentially to meet electrical demand because the lower efficiencies of peaker plants make them more expensive to operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opc.com/PoweringGeorgia/TypesofPowerPlants/BaseAndIntermediatePlants/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031110015/http://www.opc.com/PoweringGeorgia/TypesofPowerPlants/BaseAndIntermediatePlants/index.htm |archivedate=2009-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="623">A '''peripheral DMA controller''' ('''PDC''') is a feature found in modern [[microcontroller]]s. This is typically a [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] with automated control features for driving implicitly included modules in a microcontroller such as [[UART]]s.

This takes a large burden from the [[operating system]] and reduces the number of [[interrupt]]s required to service and control these type of functions.

A '''plastic worm''' (or '''trout worm''') is a plastic fishing lure, generally made to simulate an earthworm. Plastic worms can carry a variety of shapes, colors and sizes, and are made from a variety of synthetic polymers. Some are even scented to simulate live bait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fishing Tips for Freshwater|author1=Gene Kugach |author2=Thomas Power Lowry |author3=John W. G. Wellham |year=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=0-8117-2654-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plastic worms can be rigged on the line many different ways. Commonly they are used with a small [[fish hook]] and a split shot weight to keep the lure deeper in the water. The fishing equipment recommended is a 7-foot [[fishing rod]] with 8 to 10&amp;nbsp;lb fishing line.

A common fishing strategy is to configure them as a [[Texas Rig]], and bounce them off the bottom.  The key is to jig near or in cover such as weeds and trees, this technique is commonly referred to as flipping and pitching.
[[File:white-twister.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A typical twister worm or twister tail.]]

"Twister Worm" is commonly called a grub, not a "twister worm", even though the action of the tail is defined as a twisting motion of the body resembling that of a grub.

Generally there is but one type of worm, the plastic worm. This worm comes in a variety of lengths, styles, and colors to attract different fish species. The plastic worm, sometimes called a "trout worm ", is often unreliable as a lure for trout fishing, and therefore many anglers do not use them for trout fishing. Bass and panfish species (bluegill, sunfish, etc.) tend to bite these lures more than other species.

'''Reem Al Marzouqi''' ({{lang-ar|ريم المرزوقي}} ) is an [[Emiratis|Emirati]] engineer and the first citizen of the UAE to be granted a patent in the United States of America for designing a car that can be driven without hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://youngplusmag.net/teen-stuff/young-achievers/young-achiever-reem-al-marzouqi/|title = Young achiever: Reem Al Marzouqi|date = |accessdate = 2015-03-19|website = |publisher = Young+|last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402103530/http://youngplusmag.net/teen-stuff/young-achievers/young-achiever-reem-al-marzouqi/|archivedate = 2015-04-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
She received a bachelor's degree in architectural engineering from [[United Arab Emirates University]] (UAEU).&lt;ref name=Aamera&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jiwaji|first1=Aamera|title=Patent experience|url=http://www.bqdoha.com/2014/12/patent-experience|accessdate=25 March 2015|work=bq magazine|date=Dec 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While studying at UAEU she worked with engineering consultants in [[Abu Dhabi]] and [[Dubai]], including Musanada&lt;ref&gt;http://www.musanada.co.ae/English/OurServices/BuildingsConstructionManagement/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; at buildings construction management and design in [[facilities management]] firm. For hands-on engineering, she won second place in Emirates Skills national carpentry competition and she was the only and first female participating.

Reem received the granted U.S. patent for her original invention, a "Lower Extremity Vehicle Navigation Control System".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/WO2012112897A1?cl=en|title=Lower extremity vehicle navigation control system|work=patent WO 2012112897 A1|date=2012-08-23|accessdate=2015-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system uses a steering lever, an acceleration lever and a brake lever which are entirely foot-controlled, allowing people to drive a car without the use of their upper body.&lt;ref name=Aamera/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sinclair|first1=Kyle|title=Expect more Emirati women in engineering, young UAE inventor says|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/technology/expect-more-emirati-women-in-engineering-young-uae-inventor-says|accessdate=19 March 2015|work=The National|date=15 November 2013|location=Abu Dhabi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The system is the first of its kind, and the UAEU intends to seek patents for it in Japan, China and the European Union.,&lt;ref name=Vadayar&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vadayar|first1=Mohan|title=UAE team invents car with hands-free driving|url=http://gulftoday.ae/portal/095c0de4-5fa4-44e9-ab6d-2570a6613db3.aspx|work=The Gulf Today|date=October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has become one of the remarkable success of Takamul program &lt;ref&gt;http://www.takamul.gov.ae/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenational.ae/business/industry-insights/technology/abu-dhabi-on-track-with-a-patently-good-idea-with-takamul#page1&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of Reem's invention crossed her mind when she watched a TV interview on [[Inside Edition]] with [[Jessica Cox]], the world's first licensed armless pilot as she mentioned in her interview difficulties of driving cars for long distances using only her feet. Also she mentioned how it got suspended due to violation in safety rules.

Reem has since participated in the Expo Science International exhibition.  Her invention was included in the British Museum's [[A History of the World in 100 Objects]] exhibition, as displayed at Manarat Al Saadiyat, Abu Dhabi, from April–August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hunter|first1=Joanna|title=Object lesson|url=http://vision.ae/articles/object_lesson|accessdate=19 March 2015|work=Vision Magazine (UAE)|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Embassy&gt;{{cite news|title=TCA Abu Dhabi to exhibit 100 world's most compelling objects for 100 days at Saadiyat|url=http://uae-embassy.ae/Embassies/uk/news/2014/03/27/4942|accessdate=25 March 2015|work=Embassy of the United Arab Emirates in London|date=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It represented the future, and was heralded by [[Neil MacGregor]], Director of the British Museum, as "a brilliant example of human beings striving to find new things."&lt;ref name=Oasis2014&gt;{{cite news|title=Local student's invention goes on show to the world|url=http://myoasisliving.com/oasis_living_magazine/show_detail/encid/9qd/opt/features/offset/20|accessdate=25 March 2015|work=Oasis Living|date=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Homenet.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.4 |An example of a simple home network]]
[[File:EPC3925.jpg |thumb |right |[[Cisco]] EPC3925 EuroDOCSIS 3 wireless residential gateway with embedded digital voice adapter]]
In [[telecommunications network]]ing, a '''residential gateway''' (more commonly known as a '''home router''' or '''home gateway''') is a device that allows a [[local area network]] (LAN) to connect to a [[wide area network]] (WAN) via a [[modem]]. The WAN can be a larger [[computer network]] (such as a municipal WAN that provides a connection to residences within the municipality) or the [[Internet]].  The connection to the WAN may use [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]], [[cable modem]], a broadband [[mobile phone]] network, or other connection. 

The term "residential gateway" was originally used to distinguish the inexpensive networking devices designated for use in the home from similar devices used in corporate LAN environments (which generally offered a greater array of capabilities). In recent years, however, the less expensive "residential gateways" have gained many of the capabilities of corporate gateways and the distinctions are fewer. Many home LANs now are able to provide most of the functions of small corporate LANs.

Since the early 2000s the residential or home gateway has been used by [[Telecommunications]] Multiple Service Operators [MSOs]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercecable.com/story/set-top-box-dead-long-live-home-gateway/2011-05-02|title=The set-top box is dead; long live the home gateway|work=FierceCable}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a termination device for connecting consumer premises to a [[broadband]] delivery network. As a part of the [[carrier network]], the home gateway supports remote control, detection and configuration.

==Devices==
[[File:ResidentialGatewayCloseup.jpg|thumb|A typical residential gateway. A single internet connection is shared by multiple devices connected through a LAN.]]
Multiple devices have been described as "residential gateways":

* [[Cable modem]]
* [[DSL modem]]
* [[Wireless router]]&lt;ref&gt;Wireless router is a combination of wired router and wireless access point.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Network switch]]
* [[Voice over internet protocol]] (VoIP) [[analog telephone adapter]]
* [[Wireless access point]]
* [[Router (computing)|Wired router]]

or certain combinations of the above.

A [[modem]] (e.g. [[DSL modem]], [[Cable modem]]) by itself provides none of the functions of a router. It merely allows [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] or [[Ethernet]] or [[Point-to-point protocol|PPP]] traffic to be transmitted across telephone lines, cable wires, optical fibers, or wireless radio frequencies. On the receiving end is another modem that re-converts the transmission format back into digital data packets.

This allows network bridging using telephone, cable, optical, and radio connection methods. The modem also provides [[Challenge-handshake authentication protocol|handshake protocols]], so that the devices on each end of the connection are able to recognize each other. However, a modem generally provides few other network functions.

*A [[USB]] modem plugs into a single PC and allows a connection of that single PC to a WAN. If properly configured, the PC can also function as the router for a home LAN.
*An [[modem|internal modem]] can be installed on a single PC (e.g. on a [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI card]]), also allowing that single PC to connect to a WAN. Again, the PC can be configured to function as a router for a home LAN.

A [[wireless access point]] can function in a similar fashion to a modem. It can allow a direct connection from a home LAN to a WAN, if a wireless router or access point is present on the WAN as well.

However, many modems now incorporate the features mentioned below and thus are appropriately described as residential gateways.

==Features==
A residential gateway usually provides
* configuration via a web interface,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Jim|title=Can’t access 192.168.1.1: how to change router settings including Wi-Fi password|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/how-to/network-wifi/how-connect-your-router-change-settings-3515634/|publisher=PC Advisor|accessdate=December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[router (computing)|routing]] between the home network and the Internet,
* connectivity within the home network like a [[network switch]],
* [[network address translation]] (NAT) for [[IPv4]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NAT Router Security Solutions|url=https://www.grc.com/nat/nat.htm|publisher=Gibson Research Center|accessdate=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[DHCP]] for IPv4 and increasingly router advertisements for [[IPv6]], and
* [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] functions.
* May also have an internal modem, most commonly for DSL or Cable ISP.

It may also provide other functions such as [[Dynamic DNS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ou|first1=George|title=Make your home PCs accessible anywhere with Dynamic DNS for free|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/make-your-home-pcs-accessible-anywhere-with-dynamic-dns-for-free/|publisher=Techrepublic|accessdate=December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most routers are self-contained components, using internally stored firmware. They are generally OS-independent, i.e., they can be accessed with any [[operating system]].

[[Wireless router]]s perform the same functions as a router, but also allow connectivity for wireless devices with the LAN, or between the wireless router and another wireless router. (The wireless router-wireless router connection can be within the LAN or can be between the LAN and a WAN.)

Low-cost production and requirement for user friendliness makes the home routers vulnerable to network attacks, which in the past resulted in large clusters of such devices being taken over and used to launch DDoS attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lax Security Opens the Door for Mass Scale Abuse of SOHO Routers {{!}} Incapsula.com|url = https://www.incapsula.com/blog/ddos-botnet-soho-router.html|website = www.incapsula.com|accessdate = 2015-06-16|first = Ofer|last = Gayer}}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of the vulnerabilities were present in the web administration consoles of the routers, allowing unauthorised control either via [[default password]]s, vendor [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoors]], or [[Web application security|web vulnerabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1506/1506.04112.pdf|title = Owning Your Home Network: Router Security Revisited|date = |accessdate = |website = Arxiv.org|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sequence of events recorder''' (SER)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sequence of events recorder|url=http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/Sequence+of+events+recorder|publisher=The Free Dictionary by Farlex}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an intelligent standalone microprocessor based system, which monitors external inputs and records the time and sequence of the changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sequence of events recorder facility for an industrial process control ...|url=http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=vM_bAAAAEBAJ|publisher=[[Google Patents]]|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Utility Communications Architecture (UCA) glossary|url=http://www.nettedautomation.com/glossary_menue/glossary_uca.html|publisher=NettedAutomation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sequence of events recorders usually have an external time source such as a [[GPS]] or [[radio clock]]. When wired inputs change state, the time and state of each change is recorded.

SERs enable rapid [[root cause analysis]] after multiple events have occurred due to the secure recording of the [[sequence of events]] in the order of occurrence. SERs are therefore utilized as a diagnostic tool to minimize plant downtime. SERs are often interfaced with a [[SCADA]] system, [[distributed control system]] (DCS),or [[programmable logic controller]] (PLC). 

SER reports are used by electrical engineers to analyze large and small electrical system blackouts. After the [[Northeast blackout of 2003]], the [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]] (NERC) specified that electrical system data should be time-tagged to the nearest [[millisecond]]. 

In 1984 The Tetragenics Company, a subsidiary of the Montana Power Company, introduced the first [[remote terminal unit]] (RTU) that time-tagged events to the nearest millisecond, and now there are also other RTUs with this capability. [[Digital protective relay]]s and some PLCs now also include time-tagging to the nearest millisecond; SCADA systems that incorporate these devices provide SER functions without a dedicated SER device.

''' SMARC (‘Smart Mobility ARChitecture’)''' is a specification published by the Standardization Group for Embedded Technologies e.V. (SGET) for [[computer-on-module]]s (COMs).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sget.org/news/view/article/sget-team-sdt01-has-passed-its-specification-with-the-smarc-standard.html?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=24 ''SGET team SDT.01 has passed its specification with the SMARC standard.'']. SGET.org. Retrieved 2013-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt; SMARC Computer-on-Modules are specifically designed for the development of extremely compact low-power systems. Generally, SMARC modules are based on [[ARM architecture|ARM]] processors, they can, however, also be fitted with other low-power [[System on a chip|SoC]] architectures, like, for example, ones based on [[x86]] SoCs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.vdcresearch.com/embedded_hw/2013/02/vdc-initiating-coverage-on-smarc-embedded-coms.html''VDC Initiating Coverage on SMARC Embedded COMs '']&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, SMARC modules’ power requirement is in the range of a few watts, which opens up avenues to markets which to date could not be addressed due to processor designs with much higher power consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.iccmedia.com/pdf/ecefeb13/ecefeb13-page46-49-smarc_new-computer-on-module-standard-for-arm-soc-designs.pdf''SMARC – new Computer-on-Module standard for ARM/SoC designs'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer-on-Modules integrate the core function of a bootable computer, like SoC, as well as additional circuitry, including DRAM, boot-flash, voltage distribution, [[Ethernet]] and display transmitter. The modules are deployed together with an application-specific carrierboard, whose size and form can be defined to meet customer-specific requirements. The carrierboard executes the required interfaces and can integrate, if required, any further functionalities, such as audio codecs, touch controller, wireless communication interfaces, etc.

The SMARC specification outlines both the dimensions of the module and the positioning of the anchor points as well as the connector to the carrierboard and, most importantly, the executed interfaces with the pin-out. The pin-out is optimized for ARM and low-power SoC interfaces and is distinguished from classical PC interfaces by its target-oriented focus on low-power and mobile applications.

SMARC is based on the ULP-COM form factor&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.kontron.com/about-kontron/news-events/kontron+announces+the+release+candidate+of+the+ultra+lowpower+module+standard+for+arm+and+socbased+coms+.html''Kontron announces the release candidate of the ultra low-power module standard for ARM- and SoC-based COMs'']&lt;/ref&gt; which was introduced by the companies Kontron and Adlink in 2011. During the specification process by the SGET the standard was renamed to SMARC.

== Dimensions ==

SMARC defines two module sizes: 
* 82&amp;nbsp;mm × 50&amp;nbsp;mm for extremely compact low-power designs 
* 82&amp;nbsp;mm × 80&amp;nbsp;mm for SoCs with higher performance and with increased space and cooling requirement

== Connector ==

SMARC Computer-on-Modules have 314 card edge contacts on the [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) of the module which is plugged via a low-profile connector on the carrierboard. In most cases, the connector has a construction height of 4.3&amp;nbsp;mm. It is also used for [[Mobile PCI Express Module]] 3.0 graphic cards, which naturally have completely different pin assignments.

== Signal lines and pin assignments ==

Signal transmission is carried out via a total of 314 pins. 33 of these are reserved signal lines for power supply and grounding, so that with SMARC a total of 281 signal lines are effectively available. ARM- and SoC-typical energy-saving interfaces, like, for instance, parallel LCD for display connection, mobile industry processor interfaces for cameras, [[Serial Peripheral Interface]] (SPI) for general peripheral connection, [[I²S]] for audio and [[I2C]] are included. Besides these, classical computer interfaces such as [[USB]], [[Serial ATA|SATA]] and [[PCI Express]] are also defined.

In the current version of the SMARC specification not all of the 314 signal lines are assigned to fixed I/Os. The Alternate Function Block (AFB) has free pins available for different requirements. This is to ensure that the SMARC specification can flexibly accommodate up and coming technical developments which today are not foreseeable while remaining fully compatibility to previous designs. On the one hand, extended versions of the SMARC specification can assign new standard functions to these 20 AFB signal lines. On the other hand, the SMARC specification 1.0 currently lists the MOST (Media Oriented System Transport) bus, Dual [[Gigabit Ethernet]], Super Speed USB, or industrial network protocols which from a current point of view could be imagined as or might be assigned as interfaces of the AFB.

== Specification ==

The SMARC hardware specification V1.0 is supervised by the SGET. The specification is freely available as a download on the SGET website.

'''Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education''' or ('''SARE''') is a competitive grant program established by the [[USDA]] agency, the [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service]]. The program is subdivided into regional areas (North Central, Northeast, South, and West), each with their own leadership. The purpose of SARE is to promote research and education on sustainable agriculture practices and ensure the economic viability of the agricultural industry in the United States for future generations.&lt;ref name="State of NJ Department of Ag"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (SARE)|url=http://www.nj.gov/agriculture/grants/sare.html|website=Grants, Financial Services|publisher=State of New Jersey Department of Agriculture|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

"SARE's mission is to advance, to the whole of American agriculture, innovations that improve profitability, stewardship and quality of life by investing in groundbreaking research and education."&lt;ref name="USDA SARE"&gt;{{cite web|title=SARE Vision and Mission|url=http://www.sare.org/About-SARE/Vision-and-Mission|website=Sustainable Agriculture Research &amp; Education|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Beginnings===
Congress created the Agricultural Productivity Act in response to the need for government establishment of a sustainable agriculture program in 1985.&lt;ref name="GovTrack Summary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Summaries for the Agricultural Productivity Act of 1985|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/99/hr1383/summary|website=GovTrack|publisher=Civic Impulse, LLC.|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, the first congressional appropriation was made to the program in the form of $3.9 million.&lt;ref name="SARE 20/20"&gt;{{cite web|title=SARE 20/20|url=http://www.sare.org/Learning-Center/SARE-Biennial-Reports/Archives-of-Biennial-Reports-Highlights/SARE-20-20|website=Sustainable Agriculture Research &amp; Development|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) dedicated $1 million to a joint EPA and USDA subproject of SARE entitled [[Agriculture in Concert with the Environment]].&lt;ref name="SARE 20/20" /&gt;

===1990s===

In the early 1990s, SARE created a national outreach office to spread public awareness to their cause. They created publications to disperse that contained information on how to begin the conversion from traditional to sustainable agriculture methods.&lt;ref name="SARE 20/20" /&gt;  Additionally, SARE began funding farmer-led research while Congress contributed funding to a SARE Professional Development Program, which provides members of the agriculture industry with training, grants, and resources to build awareness, knowledge, and skills related to sustainable agriculture practices.&lt;ref name="SARE professional development"&gt;{{cite web|title=Professional Development Program|url=http://www.sare.org/Professional-Development|website=Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, national attention began to be brought to sustainable and organic agriculture methods. The program began to shift its focus towards marketing, local production, and the use of efficient, renewable energy sources on farms. The [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]] was influenced by the program to issue a memorandum pledging to make sustainability a key focus of all USDA policies and programs.&lt;ref name="SARE 20/20" /&gt; The USDA National Agroforestry Center co-funded a program that lasted for 6 years, which assisted farmers in the development of [[agroforestry]] plans. Meanwhile, SARE furthered their funding of research on revolutionary agricultural methods and technology by awarding grants to graduate students' research projects nationwide.&lt;ref name="SARE 20/20" /&gt;

===2000s===

On November 18, 2000, the program supported the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] [[National Museum of Natural History]] in their opening of an exhibit entitled "''Listening to the Prairie: Farming in Nature's Image''". The exhibit featured the techniques used by farmers to maximize their output while preserving the surrounding prairies. It ran until March 31, 2001.&lt;ref name="Listening to the Prairie"&gt;{{cite web|title=Listening to the Prairie: Farming in Nature's Image|url=http://www.si.edu/Exhibitions/Details/Listening-to-the-Prairie-Farming-in-Nature's-Image-4380|website=Smithsonian Exhibitions|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, SARE celebrated its 20th anniversary. To that date, the program had funded 3,700 projects and was operating with an annual budget of approximately $19 million.&lt;ref name="SARE 20/20" /&gt;

==Evaluation of the program's effectiveness==

As of 2008, 64% of farmers who had received SARE grants stated that they had been able to earn increased profits as a result of the funding they received and utilization of sustainable agriculture methods. Additionally, 79% of grantees said that they had experienced a significant improvement in soil quality though the environmentally friendly, sustainable methods that they were utilizing on their farms.&lt;ref name="SARE 20/20" /&gt;

[[File:Underwood-overview.jpg|thumb|Typewriter]]
"'''The Typewriter'''" is a short composition of [[light music]] by American composer [[Leroy Anderson]], which features an actual typewriter as a percussion instrument.

==Composition==
Anderson completed "The Typewriter" on October 9, 1950 in [[Woodbury, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;"Leroy Anderson: A Bio-Bibliography", Praeger 2004, Chapter 2 – "Works", Pages 25–81.&lt;/ref&gt; "The Typewriter" received its first performance on September 8, 1953 during a recording Anderson and [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] made in [[New York City]] for [[Decca Records]].&lt;ref&gt;"Leroy Anderson: A Bio-Bibliography", Praeger 2004, Appendix H – "Recording Sessions and Musicians", page 411&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson composed melody for [[symphony orchestra|symphony]] and [[pops orchestra]]s, William Zinn and Floyd Werle arranged it for [[string orchestra]]s and [[Concert band|wind band]]s respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leroyanderson.com/publishedmusic.php Published Music] // Leroy Anderson's official website&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rezeptionsglocke.jpg|thumb|Bell structure]]
Its name refers to the fact that its performance requires a typewriter. Performer uses 3 basic typewriter sounds: the sound of typing, the "ring" of the carriage return (a [[Call bell|standard desk bell]] is used for it), and the sound of the typewriter carriage returning. In some case the sound of the typewriter carriage returning is made by musical gourd&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/sleighride/Biography/Evening_at_Pops.htm Evening at Pops with Leroy Anderson], transcript of episode of [[Evening at Pops]] broadcast in May 1972, at [[PBS]], retrieved June 23 2012&lt;/ref&gt;, flute, string or other instrument.

The typewriter was modified so that only two keys work to prevent the keys from jamming. According to composer himself and other musicians typewriter part is hard because of typing speed: even professional [[stenographer]]s can not do it, and only professional [[drummer]]s have the necessary [[wrist]] flexibility.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91935049 Leroy Anderson: Master of the Miniature], at [[National Public Radio]], by Pat Dowell, published June 29, 2008, retrieved June 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been called one of "the wittiest and most clever pieces in the orchestral repertoire".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compactdiscoveries.com/CompactDiscoveriesScripts/13LeroyAnderson.html "Compact Discoveries: #13, Leroy Anderson"], by Fred Flaxman, broadcast 2005, transcript posted 2009, retrieved June 23 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Author Steve Metcalf has written that "Despite the almost total disappearance of typewriters in everyday life, the statistics show that "The Typewriter" is still a favorite Anderson item."&lt;ref&gt;"Leroy Anderson: A Bio-Bibliography", Praeger 2004, Chapter 1 – "Biography", Page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Typewriter is used in composition as [[percussion instrument]] from the standpoint of music theory&lt;ref&gt;Thomas D Rossing, Science of Percussion Instruments // World Scientific Pub Co Inc, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;, and typewriter part is performed by percussionist/drummer usually or by conductor&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiKfHXVfWBI&amp;t=1594 New Year with] [[Vladimir Spivakov]] // [[Russia-K]], December 31, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; rarely.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;

==Cultural references==
The piece was featured in the [[Jerry Lewis]] film ''[[Who's Minding the Store]]'' (1963), although his first recorded performance was on a January 1954 episode of [[The Colgate Comedy Hour]]. The [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] satirical programme ''[[The News Quiz]]'' has adopted the tune as its theme song. The original MS-DOS version of ''[[Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing]]!'' played a portion of the piece on startup.  For several decades the tune was also the opening theme for [[Kol Yisrael|Israel Radio]]'s weekly news journal, which is broadcast on its "Network B" (''"Reshet Bet"'') every Saturday morning. It was also featured as a title theme for the German comedy TV series ''[[Büro, Büro]]'', and in [[Adam Elliot]]'s 2009 Australian film ''[[Mary and Max]]''.  It was integrated into the ''Animaniacs'' cartoon segment "Temporary Insanity" (Season 1, episode 6, 1993), mimed by [[Yakko Warner]] as being typed on a nonexistent typewriter.  The piece also appears in the Amazon series ''[[The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel]]'' (season 1, episode 4).

The variant of Russian name for composition "Соло на пишущей машинке" (''Solo na pishushchey mashinke'', Solo on typewriter) is used for same-named self-help [[touch typing|touch typewriting]] manual by Vladimir  Shakhidzhanyan (1991) and later for his touch keyboarding computer trainer "Соло на клавиатуре" (''Solo na klaviature'', Solo on keyboard) and for notebooks "Соло на ундервуде" (''Solo na undervude'', Solo on [[Underwood Typewriter Company|underwood]], 1980) and "Соло на IBM" (''Solo na IBM'', Solo on [[IBM PC|IBM]], 1990) by [[Sergei Dovlatov]].

'''Tovex''' (also known as '''Trenchrite''', '''Seismogel''', and '''Seismopac''') is a [[water-gel explosive]] composed of [[ammonium nitrate]] and [[methylammonium nitrate]] that has several advantages over traditional [[dynamite]], including lower toxicity and safer manufacture, transport, and storage. It has thus almost entirely replaced [[dynamite]].
There are numerous versions ranging from [[Shearing (physics)|shearing]] charges to [[aluminium|aluminized]] common blasting agents. Tovex is used by 80% of international [[petroleum|oil]] [[corporation|companies]] for [[seismic exploration]].

==History==
The Tovex family of products, sometimes generically called "water gels," were developed by the old Explosives Department at [[DuPont]] (E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company, Inc.) in the mid-to-late 1960s when pelletized [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] was included in aqueous gels to create a slurry form of [[ANFO]] that displayed water-resistant properties in wet bore holes.&lt;ref&gt;E. I du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company. Blasters' Handbook. Fifteenth Edition, 1966, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; TNT-sensitized water gels were commercially successful, but the TNT led to problems with oxygen balance: namely elevated amounts of combustion by-products such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen-dioxide complexes. Not only was TNT "dirty," it was also expensive. TNT was eliminated through the work of DuPont chemists Colin Dunglinson, Joseph Dean Chrisp Sr. and William Lyerly along with a team of others at DuPont's Potomac River Development Laboratory (PRDL) at Falling Waters, West Virginia, and at DuPont's Eastern Laboratories (EL) at Gibbstown, New Jersey. These chemists and engineers formulated a series of water gel-base products that replaced the TNT with methyl ammonium nitrate, also known as monomethylamine nitrate, or PR-M, (which stands for "Potomac River – monomethylamine nitrate"), creating the "Tovex Extra" product line.

In late 1973, DuPont declared "the last days of dynamite" and switched to the new Tovex formula. The "Tovex" (that replaced nitroglycerin-based dynamite) had evolved into a cap-sensitive product. Even though it bore the same name as the earlier "Tovex," it was quite different from the precursors, which could only be initiated in large diameters (5 inches) with a one pound TNT booster. The new Tovex of the mid-to-late 1970s could be detonated in (critical) diameters much smaller than 5-inches by utilizing DuPont's [[Detasheet#Deta_Flex|Detaflex]], thus making the new Tovex a realistic replacement for dynamite.

Until then, only nitroglycerin-based explosives were commercially feasible for blasters who wanted cap-sensitive explosives that could be initiated with a #6 [[blasting cap]] in bore holes as small as 3/4 of an inch in diameter, sometimes less. The new Tovex satisfied that requirement.

Atlas, Hercules, IRECO, Trojan-US Powder and several other explosives manufacturing firms of the era created emulsions, gels and slurries which accomplished the same end, but it was the DuPont patent of PR-M based explosives ({{US patent|3431155}}) that gave the DuPont Company a competitive edge.

DuPont stopped producing nitroglycerine-based dynamite in 1976, replacing it with Tovex. In 1980, it sold its Tovex technology to Explosive Technology International (ETI), a Canadian company. One ETI licensee is Biafo Industries Limited, headquartered in [[Islamabad]], Pakistan.

{{As of|2008}}, explosives sold under DuPont's original "Tovex" trade name are distributed in [[Europe]] by Societe Suisse des Explosifs, Brigue, in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, Josef and Rudolf Meyer, ''Explosives'', 4th edition, p. 377. {{ISBN|1-56081-266-4}} (VCH Publishers).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Tovex is a 50/50 [[aqueous solution]] of [[ammonium nitrate]] and [[methylammonium nitrate]] (sometimes also called monomethylamine nitrate, or PR-M), sensitized [[fuel]]s, and other ingredients including sodium nitrate prills, finely divided (paint-grade) aluminum, finely divided coal, and proprietary materials to make some grades [[blasting cap|cap]] sensitive, and [[thickening agent]]s to enhance water resistance and to act as crystal modifiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles1/nij/178913.txt Guide for the Selection of Commercial Explosives Detection].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[detonation velocity]] of Tovex is around 4,000 to 5,500 [[Metre per second|m·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;]]. The [[specific gravity]] is 0.8–1.4. Tovex looks like a fluid gel which can be white to black in color.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hazard.com/msds/f2/bnr/bnrwt.html MSDS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927020754/http://www2.hazard.com/msds/f2/bnr/bnrwt.html |date=2007-09-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sample applications==

[[File:TovexUpperBearCreek.jpg|thumb|270px|Tovex Fire Break II applied by Bear Divide Hot Shots on Upper Bear Creek Trail to remove granite in the Angeles National Forest.]]

The blasting product is malleable to the extent that it can be cut to length, laid out, or bundled for a wide variety of applications. Because the material requires heat and fast compression to detonate, it is safe to transport and manipulate once in the field, even if dropped from high altitudes, set on fire, or peppered with high velocity rifle bullets.

For dead trees which are considered too hazardous to remove utilizing [[crosscut saw]]s or [[chainsaws]], one or two wraps of Tovex around the base of the trunk is often enough to fell the tree safely so that the remains may be safely bucked and removed from hiking trails, parks, or other places where people recreate.

For firebreaks, the product is simply uncoiled and laid along the ground to follow the ridge line or contours of the hillside or mountain along which the fire crews wish to establish a line of defense. Fire crews then follow-up by clearing debris along the blasted line to establish a fuel-free line.

For more technical blasting which requires greater planning and finesse, Tovex is often bundled according to weight into or up against a solid material, then a [[detonation cord]] is applied to the Tovex to create a fast moving, heated dynamo effect within the Tovex when one or more blasting caps ignite the detonation cord, thus accelerating the Tovex, which causes it to detonate.

Blasting caps are ignited utilizing hand-held intrinsically safe control boxes which employ a series of safety interlocks and switches which require a strict radio sessioning handshake protocol between the unit which ignites the cap and the unit used by the Master Blaster controlling the shot, ensuring that the emplaced Tovex, detonation cord, and caps cannot ignite prematurely.

After detonation, the material is completely utilized; there is no discernible residue, unless one employs microscopic analysis. Typically, Tovex and other commercial explosives employ embedded [[taggant]]s which identify the product and often the agency which purchased the material.

==Features==
* [[blasting cap|cap]] sensitive
* wide range of [[bore hole]] [[density|densities]]
* improved flexibility in loading
* water-resistance
* no [[nitroglycerin]] and noxious fumes
* reduced handling, transportation and storage hazards
* high bubble energy ([[underwater explosion]])
* reduced sound levels and better control on [[vibration]]s

== Legality ==
Most jurisdictions consider the obstruction of traffic an illegal activity and have developed rules to prosecute those who ''block, obstruct, impede, or otherwise interfere with the normal flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic upon a public street or highway''. Some jurisdictions also penalize slow moving vehicle traffic. The unimpeded flow of traffic in the public road-space is often considered a common right.

== Examples ==
Examples of intentional traffic obstructions aimed to articulate a protest agenda include the [[Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (1968)|air traffic controller strike]], [[highway revolts]], [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] bicycle rides corking intersections, obstruction of rail transport of nuclear fuel in Germany, road blockades by farmers or truckers in France and other countries, impact on [[Eurotunnel]] operations by the [[Migrants around Calais|Migrant Crisis]] around Calais, pipeline protests (e.g. [[Dakota Access Pipeline protests|Dakota Access Pipeline]]), etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7188">'''Vitrified forts''' are stone enclosures whose walls have been subjected to [[vitrification]] through heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brigantesnation.com/VitrifiedForts/VitrifieedForts.htm |title=Vitrification of Hill Forts |accessdate=2008-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was long thought that these structures were unique to Scotland, but they have since been identified in several other parts of western and northern Europe.

Vitrified forts are generally situated on hills offering strong defensive positions. Their form seems to have been determined by the contour of the flat summits which they enclose. The walls vary in size, a few being upwards of {{convert|12|ft}} high, and are so broad that they present the appearance of [[levee|embankments]]. Weak parts of the defence are strengthened by double or triple walls, and occasionally vast lines of [[rampart (fortification)|ramparts]], composed of large blocks of unhewn and unvitrified stones, envelop the vitrified centre at some distance from it.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Vitrified Forts |volume=28 |pages=149–150 |first=Robert |last=Munro |authorlink=Robert Munro (archaeologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The walls themselves are termed vitrified ramparts.&lt;ref&gt;Darvill, Timothy (2008). ''Oxford Concise Dictionary of Archaeology'', 2nd ed., Oxford University Press, Oxford and New York, p. 376. {{ISBN|978-0-19-953404-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

No [[lime (mineral)|lime]] or [[cement]] has been found in any of these structures, all of them presenting the peculiarity of being more or less consolidated by the fusion of the rocks of which they are built. This fusion, which has been caused by the application of intense heat, is not equally complete in the various forts, or even in the walls of the same fort. In some cases the stones are only partially melted and [[calcined]]; in others their adjoining edges are fused so that they are firmly cemented together; in many instances pieces of rock are enveloped in a glassy enamel-like coating which binds them into a uniform whole; and at times, though rarely, the entire length of the wall presents one solid mass of vitreous substance.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

It is not clear why or how the walls were subjected to vitrification. Some [[antiquarian]]s have argued that it was done to strengthen the wall, but the heating actually weakens the structure. Battle damage is also unlikely to be the cause, as the walls are thought to have been subjected to carefully maintained fires to ensure they were hot enough for vitrification to take place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeology.about.com/od/vterms/g/vitrified_forts.htm Vitrification temperatures]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benderloch.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=1139 More information and the vitrification debate]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most archaeologists now consider that vitrified forts are the product of deliberate destruction either following the capture of the site by an enemy force or by the occupants at the end of its active life as an act of ritual closure.&lt;ref name="Ralston_143"&gt;Ralston 2006, 143-63{{full citation needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process has no chronological significance and is found during both Iron Age and Early Medieval Forts in Scotland.&lt;ref name="Ralston_143"/&gt;

Since [[John Williams (geologist)|John Williams]], one of the earliest of British [[geologist]]s, and author of ''The Natural History of the Mineral Kingdom'', first described these singular ruins in 1777, over 70 examples have been discovered in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The most remarkable are:

For a long time it was supposed that these forts were peculiar to Scotland; but they are found also in the Isle of Man (Cronk Sumark) [[County Londonderry]] and [[County Cavan]], Ireland; in [[Upper Lusatia]], [[Bohemia]], [[Silesia]], [[Saxony]], and [[Thuringia]]; in the provinces on the [[Rhine]], especially in the neighbourhood of the [[Nahe (Rhine)|Nahe]]; in the [[Uecker|Ucker Lake]]; in Brandenburg, where the walls are formed of burnt and smelted [[brick]]s; in Hungary; in several places in France, such as Châteauvieux (near [[Pionnat]]), Péran, [[La Courbe]], [[Sainte-Suzanne, Mayenne|Sainte-Suzanne]], [[Puy de Gaudy]], and [[Thauron]]; also rarely in the north of England. [[Broborg|Barksdale]] is a vitrified hill-fort in [[Uppland]], Sweden.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Appearance in Media==

The 16 September 1980 episode of this series features a segment in which the archaeologist Ian Ralston examines the mystery of the vitrified fort Tap o' Noth and tries to recreate how it might be accomplished by piling stones and setting a massive bonfire, repeating the work of [[V. Gordon Childe]] and [[Wallace Thorneycroft]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur C. Clarke|Clarke, A. C]], Welfare, S and Fairley, J. ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World]]''.

The museum offers a glimpse of the mighty Himalaya, its origin, evolution in time and space, natural resources, life in the geological past, earthquakes and environmental aspects, basic objective in organising the museum is to educate students and general public as well as to highlight the Institute activities.
Museum, the educative wing of the Institute had a large number of student visitors from different universities, local schools and general public and as usual remained the main centre of attraction for the national and international visitors. Students in large groups from different schools, universities, colleges and from other institutions visited the Museum and guided tours were provided to them. A relief model of the Himalaya and paintings depicting the impact of human activities on the environment displayed in the Museum remained a point of attraction for the visitors. Also, over the years visitors from USA, Austria, U.K, Ukraine, Thailand, Australia, England, Japan, Nepal, France, Russia, Moscow, Israel and Canada visited the Museum.&lt;ref name="wihg2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wihg.res.in/details.php?pgID=sb_19|title=Museum  &amp;#124; Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, Dehradun, Uttarakhand (INDIA)...|publisher=wihg.res.in|accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Center for Glaciology==
The Centre for Himalayan Glaciology was inaugurated by the Hon'ble Minister for Science and Technology and Earth Sciences, Shri Prithviraj Chavan on 4 July 2009 in the benign presence of the Secretary, DST, Dr. T. Ramasami and Joint Secretary, Shri Sanjiv Nair.
The primary mission of the Centre is to "Mount a coordinated research initiative on Himalayan [[glaciology]] to understand the factors controlling the effects of climate on glaciers in order to develop strategies for climate change adaptability for sustained growth of society". In addition, the Centre shall take up programmes of capacity building in this very specialized field, which will eventually nurture the independent Indian Institute of Glaciology.&lt;ref name="wihg3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wihg.res.in/details.php?pgID=sb_6|title=Center For Glaciology  &amp;#124; Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, Dehradun, Uttarakhand (INDIA)...|publisher=wihg.res.in|accessdate=2014-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2652">'''Web help''' is a type of [[online help]] that can either be delivered through the [[internet]] or as a stand-alone set of HTML files on a computer. This approach, mixing internet and local resources, is also used in [[Windows XP]]'s Help and Support feature.

==History==
The original URL was WebHelp.Com (ca. 1994, also known as webhlp.Com or webhelp.us.com) owned by Tom Weaver, Palo Alto,Ca. until 1999 and 2009.

==File format==
Simple web help may consist of a series of [[web page]]s, while more sophisticated web help solutions feature a [[Frameset (HTML)|frameset]] sidebar that provides a [[table of contents]] and occasionally search capability, emulating local help resources such as [[HTML Help]].

There are a number of tools that are used to make web help, like [[DocBook XSL]], [[HelpSmith]], [[MadCap Software]]'s "Flare," Adobe's [[RoboHelp]], [[Macrobject|Macrobject Word-2-Web]], [[XDocs Knowledgebase]], [[Help &amp; Manual]], [[chm2web]], [[FAR HTML]], [[HelpMapper]], SuiteHelp, Author-it or Help Explorer Server.

==Advantages==
The advantages of web help solutions are that they permit content to be continually updated and that they sometimes give prospective buyers a deeper preview of products. Web help can be considered as a [[cross-platform]] solution since it can be viewed using a regular [[internet browser]], while local online help runs only on a help viewer, and often only on a specific platform.

Additionally, if using a [[DocBook XSL]] system it allows the adoption of [[single source publishing]] whereby technical or other documentation (such as product manuals) can be produced in PDF format for printing as well as HTML for on-line publication and WebHelp to be distributed on CD-ROMs.

==Disadvantages==
The main disadvantage of web help is that if it is exclusively on-line it may become difficult or impossible to access depending on the user's internet connection. Also, it is difficult to effectively implement [[context-sensitive help]] with web help. However, most modern tools offer solutions to this problem, making it possible to provide context-sensitive web help. For example, web help systems created with [[HelpSmith]], [[MadCap Flare]], [[RoboHelp]], etc., support a number of URL parameters that can be used for integration with a web or desktop application.
