'''ASCI White''' was a [[supercomputer]] at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in [[California]].

It was a [[computer cluster]] based on [[IBM]]'s commercial [[RS/6000]] SP computer. 512 of these machines were connected together for ASCI White, with 16 [[central processing unit|processor]]s per node and 8,192 375&amp;nbsp;MHz processors in total with 6 [[terabyte]]s of memory and 160 terabytes of disk storage. It was almost exclusively used for large-scale computations requiring dozens, hundreds or thousands of processors. The computer weighed 106 tons and consumed 3 MW of electricity with a further 3 MW needed for cooling. It had a theoretical processing speed of 12.3 [[Flops|teraflops]]. The system ran IBM's [[IBM AIX|AIX operating system]].

ASCI White was made up of three individual systems, the 512 node White, the 28 node Ice and the 68 node Frost.

The system was built in [[Poughkeepsie, New York]]. Completed in June 2000 it was transported to specially built facilities in California and officially dedicated on August 15, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sc2001_fliers/ASCI_White/ASCI_White01.html The World's Fastest Computer - Meeting the Challenge of Stockpile Stewardship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111101755/http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sc2001_fliers/ASCI_White/ASCI_White01.html |date=November 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Claimed performance was 12,300 gigaflops, although this was not achieved in the widely accepted [[LINPACK]] tests. The system cost $110 million.

It was built as stage three of the [[Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative]] (ASCI) started by the U.S. [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and the [[National Nuclear Security Administration]] to build a simulator to replace live [[nuclear weapon|WMD]] testing following the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty|moratorium]] on testing started by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1992 and extended by [[Bill Clinton]] in 1993.

The machine was decommissioned beginning July 27, 2006.

The '''abyssal zone''' or '''abyssopelagic zone''' is a layer of the [[pelagic zone]] of the ocean. "Abyss" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ἄβυσσος}}, meaning bottomless. At depths of {{convert|4000|to|6000|m|ft}}, this zone remains in perpetual darkness. These regions are also characterized by continuous cold and lack of nutrients. The abyssal zone has temperatures around {{convert|2|to|3|C|F}} through the large majority of its mass.&lt;ref name="biome"&gt;{{cite web |title=Deep Sea Biome |url=http://www.untamedscience.com/biology/world-biomes/deep-sea-biome |publisher=Untamed Science |accessdate=2009-04-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331095054/http://untamedscience.com/biology/world-biomes/deep-sea-biome |archivedate=31 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the deeper part of the ''midnight zone'' which starts in the [[bathyal zone|bathypelagic]] waters above.&lt;ref name="biome"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zone"&gt;{{cite web |title=Abyssal |last=Nelson |first=Rob |url=http://www.thewildclassroom.com/biomes/abyssal.html |publisher=The Wild Classroom |date=April 2007 |accessdate=2009-04-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325100618/http://www.thewildclassroom.com/biomes/abyssal.html |archivedate=25 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trenches==
{{main|Hadal zone}}
[[File:Pelagiczone.svg|thumb|200px|left|Layers of the pelagic zone]]

The deep trenches or fissures that plunge down thousands of metres below the ocean floor (for example, the midoceanic trenches such as the [[Mariana Trench]] in the [[Pacific]]) are almost unexplored.&lt;ref name=zone/&gt; Previously, only the [[bathyscaphe]] ''[[Bathyscaphe Trieste|Trieste]]'', the [[teleoperated|remote control]] [[submarine]] ''[[Kaikō ROV|Kaikō]]'' and the ''[[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|Nereus]]'' have been able to descend to these depths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Bathyscaph Trieste|url=http://www.bathyscaphtrieste.com/|publisher=Bathyscaphtrieste.com|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World's deepest-diving submarine missing|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2003-07-01-Sub-missing_x.htm|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company Inc.|date=2003-07-02|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of March 25, 2012 one vehicle, the ''[[Deepsea Challenger]]'' was able to penetrate to a depth of 10,898.4 metres (35,756&amp;nbsp;ft).

==Biology==

Overall, the deep sea is a very food-limited environment. In the abyssal zone, biomass is directly related to the amount of food either supplied from transporting [[ocean currents]] or from the water column above. The [[biological pump]] is thought of as the main driver for cycling organic matter (e.g. particulate organic carbon or [[dissolved organic carbon]]) from the atmosphere into the surface ocean, and eventually to the deep ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glover|title=Temporal Change in Deep-Sea Benthic Ecosystems: A Review of the Evidence From Recent Time-Series Studies|journal=Advances in Marine Biology|date=2010|volume=58|pages=10–12|doi=10.1016/S0065-2881(10)58001-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the fact that organisms in the abyssal zone have no access to sunlight, they rely heavily on nutrients sinking from above (known as [[marine snow]]). These nutrients can be in the form of sediments, algae, fecal pellets, or fish carcasses, to name a few. Spatially, the abundance of organisms in the deep ocean is hypothesized to be highest where the surface productivity is the highest, as long as there is efficient export from surface ocean to deep ocean. Studies have shown that marine snow alone does not supply an adequate amount of nutrients to support the population of [[Benthos|benthic organisms]]. However, population booms of algae or animals near the surface ocean can result in heavy pulses of [[particulate organic matter]] that, in a few weeks, will deliver as many nutrients as would normally be delivered over decadal timescales of marine snow transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marine biology: Feast and famine on the abyssal plain|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/11/131111185518.htm|website=ScienceDaily|publisher=Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sea floor locations, such as [[mid-ocean ridges]], are unique in that they contain [[hydrothermal vents]]. These vents emit geothermically reduced sulfur compounds that allow for microbial [[primary production]], sustaining many benthic organisms in absence of the sunlight required for photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karl|first1=D.M.|last2=Wirsen|first2=C.O.|last3=Jannasch|first3=H.W.|title=Deep-sea primary production at the Galapagos hydrothermal vents|journal=Science|date=March 21, 1980|volume=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Continuum mechanics}}
'''Charles's law''' (also known as the '''law of volumes''') is an experimental [[gas laws|gas law]] that describes how [[gas]]es [[Thermal expansion|tend to expand when heated]]. A modern statement of Charles's law is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When the [[pressure]] on a sample of a dry gas is held constant, the Kelvin temperature and the volume will be in direct proportion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This [[Proportionality (mathematics)#Direct proportionality|directly proportional]] relationship can be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;V \propto T&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{T} = k,&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:''V'' is the [[volume]] of the gas,
:''T'' is the [[temperature]] of the gas (measured in [[kelvin]]s),
:''k'' is a [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]].

This law describes how a gas expands as the temperature increases; conversely, a decrease in temperature will lead to a decrease in volume. For comparing the same substance under two different sets of conditions, the law can be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2} \qquad \text{or} \qquad \frac {V_2}{V_1} = \frac{T_2}{T_1} \qquad \text{or} \qquad V_1 T_2 = V_2 T_1.&lt;/math&gt;
The equation shows that, as absolute temperature increases, the volume of the gas also increases in proportion.

==Discovery and naming of the law==

The law was named after scientist [[Jacques Charles]], who formulated the original law in his unpublished work from the 1780s.

In two of a series of four essays presented between 2 and 30 October 1801,&lt;ref&gt;J. Dalton (1802), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3qdJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA595#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Essay II. On the force of steam or vapour from water and various other liquids, both in vacuum and in air"  and Essay IV.  "On the expansion of elastic fluids by heat," ] ''Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester'', vol. 8, pt. 2, pages 550–574 and pages 595–602.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dalton]] demonstrated by experiment that all the gases and vapours that he studied expanded by the same amount between two fixed points of temperature.   The [[France|French]] [[natural philosopher]] [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] confirmed the discovery in a presentation to the French National Institute on 31 Jan 1802,&lt;ref name="GL02"&gt;{{citation | author = Gay-Lussac, J. L. | authorlink = Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac | year = 1802 | title = Recherches sur la dilatation des gaz et des vapeurs |trans-title=Researches on the expansion of gases and vapors | journal = Annales de chimie | volume = 43 | pages = 137–175 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6ctSn3TIeYC&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}. [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/gaygas.html English translation (extract).]&lt;br&gt;
On page 157, Gay-Lussac mentions the unpublished findings of Charles: "''Avant d'aller plus loin, je dois prévenir que quoique j'eusse reconnu un grand nombre de fois que les gaz oxigène, azote, hydrogène et acide carbonique, et l'air atmosphérique se dilatent également depuis 0° jusqu'a 80°, le cit. Charles avait remarqué depuis 15 ans la même propriété dans ces gaz ; mais n'avant jamais publié ses résultats, c'est par le plus grand hasard que je les ai connus''." (Before going further, I should inform [you] that although I had recognized many times that the gases oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbonic acid [i.e., carbon dioxide], and atmospheric air also expand from 0° to 80°, citizen Charles had noticed 15 years ago the same property in these gases; but having never published his results, it is by the merest chance that I knew of them.)&lt;/ref&gt; although he credited the discovery to unpublished work from the 1780s by [[Jacques Charles]]. The basic principles had already been described by [[Guillaume Amontons]]&lt;ref name=Amontons&gt;See:

Dalton was the first to demonstrate that the law applied generally to all gases, and to the [[vapour]]s of volatile liquids if the temperature was well above the boiling point. Gay-Lussac concurred.&lt;ref&gt;Gay-Lussac (1802), from [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6ctSn3TIeYC&amp;pg=PA166#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 166]:&lt;br&gt;
"''Si l'on divise l'augmentation totale de volume par le nombre de degrés qui l'ont produite ou par 80, on trouvera, en faisant le volume à la température 0 égal à l'unité, que l'augmentation de volume pour chaque degré est de 1 / 223.33 ou bien de 1 / 266.66 pour chaque degré du thermomètre centrigrade.''"&lt;br&gt;
If one divides the total increase in volume by the number of degrees that produce it or by 80, one will find, by making the volume at the temperature 0 equal to unity (1), that the increase in volume for each degree is 1 / 223.33 or 1 / 266.66 for each degree of the centigrade thermometer.&lt;br&gt;

"'' … elle nous porte, par conséquent, à conclure que tous les gaz et toutes les vapeurs se dilatent également par les mêmes degrés de chaleur.''"&lt;br&gt;
 … it leads us, consequently, to conclude that all gases and all vapors expand equally [when subjected to] the same degrees of heat.&lt;/ref&gt; With measurements only at the two thermometric fixed points of water, Gay-Lussac was unable to show that the equation relating volume to temperature was a linear function.   On mathematical grounds alone,  Gay-Lussac's paper  does not permit the assignment of any law stating the linear relation.     Both Dalton's and Gay-Lussac's main conclusions can be expressed mathematically as:
:&lt;math&gt;V_{100} - V_0 = kV_0\,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''V''&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume occupied by a given sample of gas at 100&amp;nbsp;°C; ''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume occupied by the same sample of gas at 0&amp;nbsp;°C; and ''k'' is a constant which is the same for all gases at constant pressure. This equation does not contain the temperature and so has nothing to do with what became known as Charles' Law. Gay-Lussac's value for ''k'' ({{frac|2.6666}}), was identical to Dalton's earlier value for vapours and remarkably close to the present-day value of {{frac|2.7315}}. Gay-Lussac gave credit for this equation to unpublished statements by his fellow Republican citizen J. Charles in 1787.  In the absence of a firm record, the gas law relating volume to temperature cannot be named after Charles.
Dalton's measurements had much more scope regarding temperature than Gay-Lussac, not only measuring the volume at the fixed points of water, but also at two intermediate points.  Unaware of the inaccuracies of mercury thermometers at the time, which were divided into equal portions between the fixed points, Dalton, after concluding in Essay II that in the case of vapours, “any elastic fluid expands nearly in a uniform manner into 1370 or 1380 parts by 180 degrees (Fahrenheit) of heat”, was unable to confirm it for gases.

==Relation to absolute zero==
Charles' law appears to imply that the volume of a gas will descend to zero at a certain temperature (−266.66&amp;nbsp;°C according to Gay-Lussac's figures) or −273.15&amp;nbsp;°C. Gay-Lussac was clear in his description that the law was not applicable at low temperatures:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
but I may mention that this last conclusion cannot be true except so long as the compressed vapours remain entirely in the elastic state; and this requires that their temperature shall be sufficiently elevated to enable them to resist the pressure which tends to make them assume the liquid state.&lt;ref name="GL02" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
At  absolute zero temperature the gas possesses zero energy and hence the molecules restrict motion.
Gay-Lussac had no experience of [[liquid air]] (first prepared in 1877), although he appears to have believed (as did Dalton) that the "permanent gases" such as air and hydrogen could be liquified. Gay-Lussac had also worked with the vapours of volatile liquids in demonstrating Charles' law, and was aware that the law does not apply just above the boiling point of the liquid:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I may however remark that when the temperature of the ether is only a little above its boiling point, its condensation is a little more rapid than that of atmospheric air. This fact is related to a phenomenon which is exhibited by a great many bodies when passing from the liquid to the solid state, but which is no longer sensible at temperatures a few degrees above that at which the transition occurs.&lt;ref name="GL02" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first mention of a temperature at which the volume of a gas might descend to zero was by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (later known as Lord Kelvin) in 1848:&lt;ref name="Kelvin48"&gt;{{citation | author = Thomson, William | authorlink = William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin | year = 1848 | title = On an Absolute Thermometric Scale founded on Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of Heat, and calculated from Regnault's Observations | url = http://zapatopi.net/kelvin/papers/on_an_absolute_thermometric_scale.html | journal = Philosophical Magazine | pages = 100–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is what we might anticipate, when we reflect that infinite cold must correspond to a finite number of degrees of the air-thermometer below zero; since if we push the strict principle of graduation, stated above, sufficiently far, we should arrive at a point corresponding to the volume of air being reduced to nothing, which would be marked as −273° of the scale (−100/.366, if .366 be the coefficient of expansion); and therefore −273° of the air-thermometer is a point which cannot be reached at any finite temperature, however low.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, the "absolute zero" on the Kelvin temperature scale was originally defined in terms of the [[second law of thermodynamics]], which Thomson himself described in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Thomson, William | authorlink = William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin | year = 1852 | title = On the Dynamical Theory of Heat, with numerical results deduced from Mr Joule's equivalent of a Thermal Unit, and M. Regnault's Observations on Steam | journal = Philosophical Magazine | volume = 4}}. [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/KELVIN1.html Extract.]&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson did not assume that this was equal to the "zero-volume point" of Charles' law, merely that Charles' law provided the minimum temperature which could be attained. The two can be shown to be equivalent by [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Ludwig Boltzmann's]] [[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|statistical view of entropy]] (1870).

However, Charles also stated:

:The volume of a fixed mass of dry gas increases or decreases by {{frac|1|273}} times the volume at 0&amp;nbsp;°C for every 1&amp;nbsp;°C rise or fall in temperature. Thus:

::&lt;math&gt;V_T=V_0+(\tfrac{1}{273}\times V_0 )\times T&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;V_T=V_0 (1+\tfrac{T}{273})&lt;/math&gt;

:where ''V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the volume of gas at temperature ''T'', ''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume at 0&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;!-- and possibly also by Clausius, I haven't checked --&gt;

==Relation to kinetic theory==
The [[kinetic theory of gases]] relates the [[macroscopic]] properties of gases, such as pressure and volume, to the [[microscopic]] properties of the molecules which make up the gas, particularly the mass and speed of the molecules. In order to derive Charles' law from kinetic theory, it is necessary to have a microscopic definition of temperature: this can be conveniently taken as the temperature being proportional to the average [[kinetic energy]] of the gas molecules, {{overline|''E''}}&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;T \propto \bar{E_{\rm k}}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Under this definition, the demonstration of Charles' law is almost trivial. The kinetic theory equivalent of the ideal gas law relates ''PV'' to the average kinetic energy:
:&lt;math&gt;PV = \frac{2}{3} N \bar{E_{\rm k}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

'''Cognitive ethology''' is a branch of [[ethology]] concerned with the influence of conscious awareness and intention on the behaviour of an animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Harber|title=Collins COBUILD Advanced Dictionary of English|year=2012|publisher=Higher Education Press|isbn=9787040327878}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Griffin]], a [[zoology]] professor in the United States, set up the foundations for researches in the cognitive awareness of animals within their habitats.&lt;ref&gt;Ristau, C, Erlbaum L, et al. (1991). Cognitive Ethology. "Biological Psychology",  32 (2-3): 220-222&lt;/ref&gt;

The fusion of [[cognitive science]] and classical [[ethology]] into cognitive ethology "emphasizes observing animals under more-or-less natural conditions, with the objective of understanding the evolution, adaptation (function), causation, and development of the species-specific [[behavioral repertoire]]" ([[Niko Tinbergen]] 1963).

According to Jamieson &amp; Bekoff (1993),&lt;ref&gt;: Dale Jamieson and Marc Bekoff
Source: Analysis, Vol. 52, No. 1 (Jan., 1992), pp. 23-28&lt;/ref&gt; "Tinbergen's four questions about the evolution, adaptation, causation and development of behavior can be applied to the cognitive and mental abilities of animals."  Allen &amp; Bekoff (1997, chapter 5)&lt;ref&gt;Dittrich, W.H. (1998) Book review of Allen &amp; Bekoff (1997) on Cognitive Ethology.&lt;/ref&gt; attempt to show how cognitive ethology can take on the central questions of cognitive science, taking as their starting point the four questions described by Barbara Von Eckardt in her 1993 book ''What is Cognitive Science?'', generalizing the four questions and adding a fifth. Kingstone, Smilek &amp; Eastwood (2008) suggested that cognitive ethology should include human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Kingstone, A., Smilek, D. &amp; Eastwood, J. D., (2008) 'Cognitive Ethology: a new approach for studying human cognition'. British Journal of Psychology, 99, 317-340&lt;/ref&gt; They proposed that researchers should firstly study how people behave in their natural, real world environments and then move to the lab. Anthropocentric claims for the ways non-human animals interact in their social and non-social worlds are often used to influence decisions on how the non-human animals can or should be used by humans.&lt;ref&gt;Bekoff, M. (1994) "Cognitive ethology and the treatment of non-human animals: How matters of mind inform matters of welfare." Animal Welfare, Vol 3(2),75-96&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to laboratory experimental psychology ==
Traditionally, cognitive ethologists have questioned research methods that isolate animals in unnatural surroundings and present them with a limited set of artificial stimuli, arguing that such techniques favor the study of artificial issues that are not relevant to an understanding of the natural behavior of animals.  However, many modern researchers favor a judicious combination of field and laboratory methods.&lt;ref&gt;Shettleworth, S. J. (2010) ''Cognition, Evolution, and Behavior'' New York: Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to ethics ==
Bekoff, M and Allen, C (1997) "identify three major groups of people (among some of whose members there are blurred distinctions) with different views on cognitive ethology, namely, slayers, skeptics, and proponents." The latter seemingly convergent with [[animal rights]] thinking in seeing animal experience as worthy in itself.

[[Ethicist]] [[Peter Singer]] is an example of a "proponent" in this sense, as is biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] who coined the term [[biophilia hypothesis|biophilia]] to describe the basis of a direct [[moral cognition]], that 'higher' animals would use to perceive moral implications in the environment directly.

==Three views==
According to Marc Bekoff, there are three different views towards whether a science of cognitive ethology is even possible. Slayers deny any possibility of success in cognitive ethology, proponents keep an open mind about animal cognition and the utility of cognitive ethological investigation, and skeptics stand somewhere in between.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bekoff|first=Marc|title=Cognitive Ethology and the Explanation of Nonhuman Animal Behavior|journal=Comparative Approaches to Cognitive Science. J.A. Meyer and H. L. Roitblat, eds .|year=1995|pages=119–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3589">'''Combustion analysis''' is a method used in both [[organic chemistry]] and [[analytical chemistry]] to determine the [[chemical element|element]]al composition (more precisely [[empirical formula]]) of a pure organic compound by combusting the sample under conditions where the resulting combustion products can be quantitatively analyzed. Once the number of [[Mole (unit)|mole]]s of each combustion product has been determined the empirical formula or a partial empirical formula of 
the original compound can be calculated.  

Applications for combustion analysis involve only the elements of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S) as combustion of materials containing them convert these elements to their oxidized form (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, NO or NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) under high temperature high oxygen conditions. Notable interests for these elements involve measuring total nitrogen in food or feed to determine protein percentage, measuring sulfur in petroleum products, or measuring [[total organic carbon]] (TOC) in water.

==History==
The method was invented by [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]]. [[Justus von Liebig]] studied the method while working with 
Gay-Lussac between 1822 and 1824 and improved the method in the following years to a level that it could be used as standard procedure for organic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Combustion train==
A '''combustion train''' is an analytical tool for the determination of [[elemental analysis|elemental composition]] of a [[chemical compound]]. With knowledge of elemental composition a [[chemical formula]] can be derived. The [[combustion]] train allows the determination of [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]] in a succession of steps:

* [[combustion]] of the sample at high temperatures with [[Copper(II) oxide]] as the [[oxidizing agent]],
* collection of the resulting gas in a [[hygroscopic]] agent ([[magnesium perchlorate]] or [[calcium chloride]]) to trap generated water,
* collection of the remainder gas in a strong [[base (chemistry)|base]] (for instance [[potassium hydroxide]]) to trap generated carbon dioxide.

Analytical determination of the amounts of water and carbon dioxide produced from a known amount of sample gives the empirical formula. For every [[hydrogen]] atom in the compound 1/2 equivalent of [[water]] is produced, and for every [[carbon]] atom in the compound 1 equivalent of [[carbon dioxide]] is produced.

Nowadays, modern instruments are sufficiently automated to be able to do these analyses routinely. Samples required are also extremely small &amp;mdash; 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg of sample can be sufficient to give satisfactory CHN analysis.

== Modern methods ==

The water vapor, carbon dioxide and other products can be separated via [[gas chromatography]] and analysed via a [[thermal conductivity detector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to spectroscopy |last=Pavia |first=Donald |authorlink= |year=2008 |publisher=Brooks Cole |location= |isbn=978-0495114789 |page=2 |pages= |url=}}&lt;!--|accessdate=September 28, 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1976">The '''curvaton''' is a hypothetical [[elementary particle]] which mediates a [[scalar field]] in early universe [[cosmology]].   It can generate fluctuations during [[inflation]], but does not itself drive inflation, instead it generates curvature perturbations at late times after the [[inflaton field]] has decayed and the decay products have redshifted away, when the curvaton is the dominant component of the energy density. It is used to generate a flat spectrum of CMB perturbations in models of inflation where the potential is otherwise too steep or in alternatives to inflation like the pre-Big Bang scenario.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22718">[[File:Saros 136 animation.gif|thumb|right|250px|Paths of totality for [[Solar Saros 136|Solar Saros Series 136]]. The interval between successive eclipses in the series is one saros, approximately 18 years.]]
[[Eclipse]]s may occur repeatedly, separated by certain intervals of time: these intervals are called '''eclipse cycles'''.&lt;ref&gt;properly, these are periods, not cycles&lt;/ref&gt;  The series of eclipses separated by a repeat of one of these intervals is called an '''eclipse series'''.

== Eclipse conditions ==
[[Eclipse]]s may occur when the [[Earth]] and the [[Moon]] are aligned with the [[Sun]], and the shadow of one body cast by the Sun falls on the other.  So at [[new moon]], when the Moon is in [[Astronomical conjunction|conjunction]] with the Sun, the Moon may pass in front of the Sun as seen from a narrow region on the surface of the Earth and cause a [[solar eclipse]].  At [[full moon]], when the Moon is in [[Astronomical opposition|opposition]] to the Sun, the Moon may pass through the shadow of the Earth, and a [[lunar eclipse]] is visible from the night half of the Earth. Conjunction and opposition of the Moon together have a special name: [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]] (from [[Greek language|''Greek'']] for "junction"), because of the importance of these [[lunar phase]]s.

An eclipse does not happen at every new or full moon, because the plane of the [[orbit of the Moon]] around the Earth is tilted with respect to the plane of the orbit of the Earth around the Sun (the [[ecliptic]]): so as seen from the Earth, when the Moon is nearest to the Sun (new moon) or at largest distance (full moon), the three bodies usually are not exactly on the same line.

This [[inclination]] is on average about 5°&amp;thinsp;9′, much larger than the apparent ''mean'' diameter of the Sun (32′&amp;thinsp;2″), the Moon as seen from the surface of the Earth right beneath the Moon (31′&amp;thinsp;37″), and the shadow of the Earth at the mean lunar distance (1°&amp;thinsp;23′).

Therefore, at most new moons the Earth passes too far north or south of the lunar shadow, and at most full moons the Moon misses the shadow of the Earth.  Also, at most solar eclipses the apparent angular diameter of the Moon is insufficient to fully obscure the solar disc, unless the Moon is near its [[apsis|perigee]], ''i.e.'' closer to the Earth and apparently larger than average. In any case, the alignment must be close to perfect to cause an eclipse.

An eclipse can only occur when the Moon is close to the plane of the orbit of the Earth, i.e. when its [[ecliptic latitude]] is small.  This happens when the Moon is near one of the two [[lunar node|node]]s of its orbit on the ecliptic at the time of the [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]].  Of course, to produce an eclipse, the Sun must also be near a node at that time: the same node for a solar eclipse, or the opposite node for a lunar eclipse.

== Recurrence ==
[[Image:Lunar eclipse diagram-en.svg|240px|thumb|A symbolic orbital diagram from the view of the Earth at the center, showing the Moon's two nodes where eclipses can occur.]]
Up to three eclipses may occur during an [[eclipse season]], a one- or two-month period that happens twice a year, around the time when the Sun is near the nodes of the Moon's orbit.

An eclipse does not occur every month, because one month after an eclipse the relative geometry of the Sun, Moon, and Earth has changed.

As seen from the Earth, the time it takes for the Moon to return to a node, the [[draconic month]], is less than the time it takes for the Moon to return to the same ecliptic longitude as the Sun: the [[synodic month]]. The main reason is that during the time that the Moon has completed an orbit around the Earth, the Earth (and Moon) have completed about {{frac|13}} of their orbit around the Sun: the Moon has to make up for this in order to come again into conjunction or opposition with the Sun. Secondly, the orbital nodes of the Moon [[lunar precession|precess]] westward in ecliptic longitude, completing a full circle in about  18.60 years&lt;!--- 18.59948 a ---&gt;, so a draconic month is shorter than a [[sidereal month]]. In all, the difference in period between synodic and draconic month is nearly {{frac|2|1|3}} days&lt;!--- 2.31837 d ---&gt;. Likewise, as seen from the Earth, the Sun passes both nodes as it moves along its ecliptic path. The period for the Sun to return to a node is called the [[eclipse year|eclipse or draconic year]]: about 346.6201 d, which is about {{frac|20}} year&lt;!--- 0.05102 ---&gt; shorter than a [[sidereal year]] because of the precession of the nodes.

If a solar eclipse occurs at one new moon, which must be close to a node, then at the next full moon the Moon is already more than a day past its opposite node, and may or may not miss the Earth's shadow. By the next new moon it is even further ahead of the node, so it is less likely that there will be a solar eclipse somewhere on Earth. By the next month, there will certainly be no event.

However, about 5 or 6 [[lunation]]s later the new moon will fall close to the opposite node. In that time (half an eclipse year) the Sun will have moved to the opposite node too, so the circumstances will again be suitable for one or more eclipses.

== Periodicity ==

These are still rather vague predictions.  However we know that if an eclipse occurred at some moment, then there will occur an eclipse again ''S'' synodic months later, ''if'' that interval is also ''D'' draconic months, where ''D'' is an integer number (return to same node), or an integer number + ½ (return to opposite node).  So an eclipse cycle is any period ''P'' for which approximately holds:

:  ''P'' = ''S''×(synodic month length) = ''D''×(Draconic month length)

Given an eclipse, then there is likely to be another eclipse after every period ''P''.  This remains true for a limited time, because the relation is only approximate.

Another thing to consider is that the motion of the Moon is not a perfect circle.  Its orbit is distinctly elliptic, so the lunar distance from Earth varies throughout the lunar cycle. This varying distance changes the apparent diameter of the Moon, and therefore influences the chances, duration, and type (partial, annular, total, mixed) of an eclipse.  This orbital period is called the [[anomalistic month]], and together with the synodic month causes the so-called "[[full moon cycle]]" of about 14 lunations in the timings and appearances of full (and new) Moons. The Moon moves faster when it is closer to the Earth (near perigee) and slower when it is near apogee (furthest distance), thus periodically changing the timing of syzygies by up to ±14 hours (relative to their mean timing), and changing the apparent lunar angular diameter by about ±6%.  An eclipse cycle must comprise close to an integer number of anomalistic months in order to perform well in predicting eclipses.

== Numerical values ==

These are the lengths of the various types of [[month]]s as discussed above (according to the lunar [[ephemeris]] ELP2000-85, valid for the [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] J2000.0; taken from (''e.g.'') Meeus (1991) ):

:    SM =  29.530588853 days   (Synodic month)&lt;ref&gt;Meeus (1991) form. 47.1&lt;/ref&gt;
:    DM =  27.212220817 days   (Draconic month)&lt;ref&gt;Meeus (1991) ch. 49 p.334&lt;/ref&gt;
:    AM =  27.55454988  days   (Anomalistic month)&lt;ref&gt;Meeus (1991) form. 48.1&lt;/ref&gt;
:    EY = 346.620076    days   (Eclipse year)

Note that there are three main moving points: the Sun, the Moon, and the (ascending) node; and that there are three main periods, when each of the three possible pairs of moving points meet one another: the synodic month when the Moon returns to the Sun, the draconic month when the Moon returns to the node, and the eclipse year when the Sun returns to the node.  These three 2-way relations are not independent (i.e. both the synodic month and eclipse year are dependent on the apparent motion of the Sun, both the draconic month and eclipse year are dependent on the motion of the nodes), and indeed the eclipse year can be described as the [[Beat (acoustics)|beat period]] of the synodic and draconic months (i.e. the period of the difference between the synodic and draconic months); in formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{EY} = \frac{\mbox{SM} \times \mbox{DM}}{\mbox{SM}-\mbox{DM}}&lt;/math&gt;

as can be checked by filling in the numerical values listed above.

Eclipse cycles have a period in which a certain number of synodic months closely equals an integer or half-integer number of draconic months: one such period after an eclipse, a [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]] ([[new moon]] or [[full moon]]) takes place again near a [[lunar node|node]] of the Moon's orbit on the [[ecliptic]], and an eclipse can occur again.  However,the synodic and draconic months are incommensurate: their ratio is not an integer number. We need to approximate this ratio by [[common fraction]]s: the numerators and denominators then give the multiples of the two periods&amp;nbsp;– draconic and synodic months&amp;nbsp;– that (approximately) span the same amount of time, representing an eclipse cycle.

These fractions can be found by the method of [[continued fractions]]: this arithmetical technique provides a series of progressively better approximations of any real numeric value by proper fractions.

Since there may be an eclipse every half draconic month, we need to find approximations for the number of half draconic months per synodic month: so the target ratio to approximate is: SM / (DM/2) = 29.530588853 / (27.212220817/2) = 2.170391682

The continued fractions expansion for this ratio is:

 2.170391682 = [2;5,1,6,1,1,1,1,1,11,1,...]:&lt;ref&gt;2.170391682 = 2 + 0.170391682 ; 1/0.170391682 = 5 + 0.868831085... ; 1/0.868831085... = 1 + 0.15097171... ; 1/0.15097171 = 6 + 0.6237575... ; etc. ;  Evaluating this 4th continued fraction: 1/6 + 1 = 7/6; 6/7 + 5 = 41/7 ; 7/41 + 2 = 89/41&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these is an eclipse cycle.  Less accurate cycles may be constructed by combinations of these.

== Eclipse cycles ==

This table summarizes the characteristics of various eclipse cycles, and can be computed from the numerical results of the preceding paragraphs; ''cf.'' Meeus (1997) Ch.9.  More details are given in the comments below, and several notable cycles have their own pages.

Any eclipse cycle, and indeed the interval between any two eclipses, can be expressed as a combination of saros (''s'') and inex (''i'') intervals.  These are listed in the column "formula".

''Notes'':

;Fortnight: Half a synodic month (29.53 days). When there is an eclipse, there is a fair chance that at the next [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]] there will be another eclipse: the Sun and Moon will have moved about 15° with respect to the nodes (the Moon being opposite to where it was the previous time), but the luminaries may still be within bounds to make an eclipse.&lt;br&gt;For example, partial [[solar eclipse of June 1, 2011]] is followed by the total [[June 2011 lunar eclipse|lunar eclipse of June 16, 2011]] and partial [[solar eclipse of July 1, 2011]].
:''For more information see [[eclipse season]].''
;Synodic Month: Similarly, two events one synodic month apart have the Sun and Moon at two positions on either side of the node, 29° apart: both may cause a partial eclipse.
;Pentalunex: 5 synodic months. Successive solar or lunar eclipses may occur 1, 5 or 6 synodic months apart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/eclipse/eclipsecycles.htm#Sar%20%28Half%20Saros%29 A Catalogue of Eclipse Cycles], Robert Harry van Gent&lt;/ref&gt;
;Semester: Half a lunar year. Eclipses will repeat exactly one semester apart at alternating nodes in a cycle that lasts for 8 eclipses. Because it is close to a half integer of anomalistic, draconic months, and tropical years, each solar eclipse will alternate between hemispheres each semester, as well as alternate between total and annular. Hence there can be a maximum of one total or annular eclipse each in a given year.
;Lunar year: Twelve (synodic) months, a little longer than an eclipse year: the Sun has returned to the node, so eclipses may again occur.
;Octon: This is {{frac|5}} of the Metonic cycle, and a fairly decent short eclipse cycle, but poor in anomalistic returns. Each octon in a series is 2 saros apart, always occurring at the same node.
;Tzolkinex: Includes a half draconic month, so occurs at alternating nodes and alternates between hemispheres. Each consecutive eclipse is a member of preceding saros series from the one before. Equal to ten [[tzolk'in]]s. Every third tzolkinex in a series is near an integer number of anomalistic months and so will have similar properties.
;Sar (Half saros): Includes an odd number of fortnights (223). As a result, eclipses alternate between lunar and solar with each cycle, occurring at the same node and with similar characteristics. A long central total solar eclipse will be followed by a very central total lunar eclipse. A solar eclipse where the moon's penumbra just barely grazes the southern limb of earth will be followed half a saros later by a lunar eclipse where the moon just grazes the southern limb of the earth's penumbra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/eclipse/eclipsecycles.htm#Sar%20%28Half%20Saros%29 A Catalogue of Eclipse Cycles], Robert Harry van Gent&lt;/ref&gt;
;Tritos: A mediocre cycle, relates to the saros like the inex. A triple tritos is close to an integer number of anomalistic months and so will have similar properties.
;Saros : The best known eclipse cycle, and one of the best for predicting eclipses, in which 223 synodic months equal 242 draconic months with an error of only 51 minutes.  It is also close to 239 anomalistic months, which makes the circumstances between two eclipses one saros apart very similar.
;Metonic cycle or Enneadecaeteris: This is nearly equal to 19 [[tropical year]]s, but is also 5 "octon" periods and close to 20 eclipse years: so it yields a short series of eclipses on the same calendar date. It consists of 110 hollow months and 125 full months, so nominally 6940 days, and equals 235 lunations (235 [[synodic months]]) with an error of only around 7.5 hours.
;[[Inex]]: Very convenient in the classification of eclipse cycles. Inex series, after a sputtering beginning, go on for many thousands of years giving eclipses every 29 years or so. One inex after an eclipse, another eclipse takes place at almost the same longitude, but at the opposite latitude.
;Exeligmos: A triple saros, with the advantage that it has nearly an integer number of days, so the next eclipse will be visible at locations near the eclipse that occurred one exeligmos earlier, in contrast to the saros, in which the eclipse occurs about 8 hours later in the day or about 120° to the west of the eclipse that occurred one saros earlier.
;Callippic cycle: 441 hollow months and 499 full months; thus 4 Metonic Cycles minus one day or precisely 76 years of {{frac|365|1|4}} days. It equals 940 lunations with an error of only 5.9 hours.
;Triad: A triple inex, with the advantage that it has nearly an integer number of anomalistic months, which makes the circumstances between two eclipses one Triad apart very similar, but at the opposite latitude. Almost exactly 87 calendar years minus 2 months. The triad means that every third saros series will be similar (mostly total central eclipses or annular central eclipses for example). Saros 130, 133, 136, 139, 142 and 145, for example, all produce mainly total central eclipses.
;Hipparchic cycle: Not a noteworthy eclipse cycle, but [[Hipparchus]] constructed it to closely match an integer number of synodic and anomalistic months, years (345), and days. By comparing his own eclipse observations with Babylonian records from 345 years earlier, he could verify the accuracy of the various periods that the Chaldeans used.
;Babylonian: The ratio 5923 returns to latitude in 5458 months was used by the Chaldeans in their astronomical computations.
;Tetradia: Sometimes 4 total lunar eclipses occur in a row with intervals of 6 lunations (semester), and this is called a [[Tetrad (astronomy)|tetrad]]. [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] noticed that there are eras when such tetrads occur comparatively frequently, interrupted by eras when they are rare.  This variation takes about 6 centuries. [[Antonie Pannekoek]] (1951) offered an explanation for this phenomenon and found a period of 591 years.  Van den Bergh (1954) from [[Theodor von Oppolzer]]'s ''Canon der Finsternisse'' found a period of 586 years. This happens to be an eclipse cycle; see Meeus [I] (1997).  Recently Tudor Hughes explained the variation from secular changes in the [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of the Earth's [[orbit (celestial mechanics)|orbit]]: the period for occurrence of tetrads is variable and currently is about 565 years; see Meeus III (2004) for a detailed discussion.

==Saros series and inex series==
Any eclipse can be assigned to a given [[saros series]] and [[inex]] series. The year of a solar eclipse (in the [[Gregorian calendar]]) is then given approximately by:&lt;ref&gt;Based on [https://web.archive.org/web/20070630062339/http://user.online.be/felixverbelen/cycles.htm Saros, Inex and Eclipse cycles].&lt;/ref&gt;

:year = 28.945 × number of the saros series + 18.030 × number of the inex series − 2882.55

When this is greater than 1, the integer part gives the year AD, but when it is negative the year BC is obtained by taking the integer part and adding 2. For instance, the eclipse in saros series zero and inex series zero was in the middle of 2884 BC.

'''''Freud: His Life and His Mind''''' is a 1947 biography of [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], by Helen Walker Puner. The book was reprinted in 1959 with a new foreword by the psychoanalyst [[Erich Fromm]]. The work was praised by Fromm, but has also received criticism from scholars.

==Summary==
Puner attempts to explain Freud's life and his accomplishments.{{sfn|Puner|1955|page=12}}

==Publication history==
''Freud: His Life and His Mind'' was first published in 1947 by [[Dell Publishing]]. It was reprinted in 1959 with a new foreword by the psychoanalyst Erich Fromm.{{sfn|Fromm|Puner|1955|pages=4, 9–10}}

==Reception==
===Responses from Freud's family===
The psychoanalyst [[Anna Freud]] was outraged by Puner's work, describing it as "horrible" in a letter to [[Ernest Jones]]. Oliver Freud had a less negative view of the book, believing that Puner's errors were the result of citing [[Carl Jung]], [[Wilhelm Stekel]], and [[Fritz Wittels]].{{sfn|Borch-Jacobsen|Shamdasani|2012|pages=257, 350}}

===Mainstream media===
The poet [[Maurice English]] gave ''Freud: His Life and His Mind'' a negative review in ''[[The Nation]]'', describing it as "sloppily written" and printed. English wrote that the book contained "elementary mistakes in grammar" and that Puner's claim that Freud's father was stern and aloof was contradicted by "the examples she gives of his actual behavior toward his son."{{sfn|English|1948|pages=159–160}}

The critic [[Frederick Crews]], writing in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', described Walker's book as "astute". According to Crews, Anna Freud commissioned Jones to write ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' as a response to Puner's book.{{sfn|Crews|2017}}

===Evaluations in books===
Fromm, in his foreword to ''Freud: His Life and His Mind'', commented that, "although it was not written by a professional psychologist, it shows a sensitivity and grasp of Freud's personality and cultural function which is quite unusual." He welcomed the book's republication, crediting Puner with having provided "a more analytical and realistic" picture of Freud than previous authors and with recognizing both Freud's personal psychological problems and the pseudo-religious character of psychoanalysis. He wrote that Puner's book, "will help greatly to disseminate a true and inspiring picture of the founder of psychoanalysis."{{sfn|Fromm|1955|pages=9–10}} The historian [[Peter Gay]] wrote in ''[[Freud: A Life for Our Time]]'' (1988) that Puner's biography is "fairly hostile and neither very scholarly nor very reliable", but that it was sufficiently influential for Ernest Jones to criticize it in ''[[The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud]]'' (1953).{{sfn|Gay|1995|page=744}}

The psychologist [[Louis Breger]] called ''Freud: His Life and His Mind'' a perceptive work for its time, writing that Puner managed to construct a balanced account of Freud despite her ignorance of key facts, including the existence of [[Wilhelm Fliess]]. Breger considered Puner's version of Freud "more human" than those of Jones and Gay.{{sfn|Breger|2000|page=384}}

'''Incompatibility thesis''' is an argument in [[research methodology]] about incompatibility of [[quantitative research]] and [[qualitative research]] [[paradigm]]s in the same research. This thesis is based on philosophies of [[post-structuralism]] and [[post-modernism]] (among others). Arguments from those philosophies support exclusive superiority of one orientation (usually, the qualitative one) are oppose mixing it with quantitative research (as is advocated by the proponents of [[mixed-method research]] who support the [[compatibility thesis]]).

==Information==
[[Incompatibilism|Incompatibilists]] maintain that problems arise not so much at the level of practice, but at the level of [[Epistemology|epistemological]] [[Paradigm|paradigms]]. In particular, they propose that quantitative and [[Qualitative research|qualitative methods]] are incompatible on an epistemological level; therefore, the two kinds of methods are incompatible. HOWE 1998,{{full|date=September 2018}} argues that a principle implicit in the incompatibilist's argument ‘that abstract paradigms should determine research methods in a one-way fashion—is untenable’. That paradigms must demonstrate their worth in terms of how they inform, and are informed by, research methods that are successfully employed. Given such a two-way relationship between methods and paradigms, paradigms are evaluated in terms of how well they square with the demands of research practice and incompatibilism vanishes.

== Overview {{Anchor|Overview}} ==
Pollution is a large problem and is growing rapidly. The majority of the modern descriptions of ''information pollution'' apply to computer based communication methods, such as [[e-mail]], [[instant messaging]] (IM) and [[RSS feeds]]. The term acquired particular relevance in 2003 when [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]], a leading web usability expert, published a number of [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3171376.stm articles discussing the topic]. However, as early as 1971 researchers were expressing doubts about the negative effects of having to recover “valuable nodules from a slurry of garbage in which it is a randomly dispersed minor component.”&lt;ref name=ETTINGER&gt;
{{cite journal|author=Ettinger, M.B.|year=1971|title= A solution to the ''information pollution'' problem|journal=Chemical Technology|volume= 1|issue=6|pages= 330–331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People use information in order to make decisions and adapt to the circumstances. Yet, cognitive studies have demonstrated that there is only so much information human beings can process before the quality of their decisions begins to deteriorate.&lt;ref name=BRAY /&gt;  The excess of information is commonly known as [[information overload]] and it can lead to decision paralysis, where the person is unable to make a judgment as they cannot see what is relevant anymore.&lt;ref name=ORMAN /&gt;&lt;ref name=BRAY /&gt; Although technology has clearly exacerbated the problem, it is not the only cause of information pollution. Anything that distracts our attention from the essential facts that we need to perform a task or make a decision could be considered an ''information pollutant''.

The use of the term ''information pollution'' also draws attention to the parallels between the [[information revolution]] that began in the last quarter of the 20th century and the [[industrial revolution]] of the 18th–19th century.&lt;ref name=CAI /&gt;&lt;ref name=NAYAR&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/14783360410001680224|title=Information Integrity (I*I): The Next Quality Frontier|journal=Total Quality Management &amp; Business Excellence|volume=15|issue=5–6|pages=743|year=2004|last1=Nayar|first1=Madhavan K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CAPURRO&gt;Capurro, R.

London: Taylor Graham. pp. 122–139&lt;/ref&gt; Information pollution is seen as the equivalent of the [[environmental pollution]] generated by industrial processes. Some authors claim that we are facing an information overload crisis of global proportions, in the same scale of the threats faced by the environment. Others have expressed the need for the development of an information ecology to mirror [[environmental management]] practices.&lt;ref name=BRAY&gt;Bray, D.A. (2008). [http://ssrn.com/abstract=962732 Information Pollution, Knowledge Overload, Limited Attention Spans, and Our Responsibilities as IS Professionals]. ''Global Information Technology Management Association (GITMA) World Conference''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manifestations of information pollution {{Anchor|Manifestations}}==
Although information pollution can present itself in many formats, its manifestations can be broadly grouped into those that provoke disruption and those that affect the quality of the information.

Typical examples of disrupting information pollutants include unsolicited electronic messages ([[E-mail spam|spam]]) and instant messages, particularly when used in the workplace.&lt;ref name=NIELSEN /&gt; Mobile phones (the ring tones and also the actual conversation) can be very distracting in certain environments. Disrupting information pollution is not always technology based. A common example is unwanted publicity in any format.&lt;ref name=MITCHELL /&gt; Superfluous messages, for example unnecessary labels on a map, also constitute an unnecessary distraction.&lt;ref name=NIELSEN /&gt;

Alternatively, the information supply may be polluted when the quality of the information is reduced. This may be due to the information itself being inaccurate or out of date&lt;ref name=CAPURRO /&gt; but it also happens when the information is badly presented. For example, when the messages are unfocused or unclear or when they appear in cluttered, wordy or poorly organised documents that make it difficult for the reader to understand their meaning.&lt;ref name=MI /&gt; This type of information pollution can be addressed in the context of [[information quality]]. Another example is in government work. Laws and regulations in many agencies are undergoing rapid changes and revisions. Government workers' handbooks and other sources used for interpreting these laws are often outdated ( sometimes years behind the changes ) which can cause the public to be misinformed, and businesses to be out of compliance with regulatory laws.

== Causes and sources {{Anchor|Causes and sources}} ==

===Cultural factors===
A number of cultural factors have contributed to the growth of information pollution:

Information has been seen traditionally as a good thing. We are used to statements like “you cannot have too much information”, “the more information the better”&lt;ref name=NIELSEN&gt;
{{cite journal|author=Nielsen, J. |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=966712.966731 |year= 2003|title= IM, Not IP (Information Pollution)|journal=ACM Queue|volume= 1|issue=8|pages= 75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and “information is power”.&lt;ref name=CAPURRO /&gt; The publishing and marketing industries have been used to printing excessive copies of books, magazines and brochures regardless of customer demand, just in case they were needed.&lt;ref name=MITCHELL&gt;
{{cite journal|author=Mitchell, A.|year= 1999|title= High prize for tackling information pollution|journal=Marketing Week|volume= 22|issue=17|pages= 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As new technologies made it easier for information to reach the furthest corners of the planets, we have seen a democratisation of information sharing. This is perceived as a sign of progress and individual empowerment, as well as a positive step to bridge the divide between the information poor and the information rich.&lt;ref name=NAYAR /&gt;&lt;ref name=CAPURRO /&gt; However, it also has the effect of increasing the volume of information in circulation and making it more difficult to separate valuable from waste. It is a form pollution that makes senses constantly assaulted by marketing and advertising, information pollution from a cultural context is known as "cultural pollution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gary Armstrong|author2=Stewart Adam|author3=Sara Denize|author4=Philip Kotler|title=Principles of Marketing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UKyaBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA463|year=2014|publisher=Pearson Australia|isbn=978-1-4860-0253-5|page=463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of information technology===

As already mentioned, information pollution can exist without technology, but the technological advances of the 20th century and, in particular, the internet have played a key role in the increase of information pollution. [[Blogs]], [[social networks]], [[personal website]]s and [[mobile technology]] all contribute to increased “noise” levels. Some technologies are seen as especially intrusive (or polluting), for example [[instant messaging]].&lt;ref name=NIELSEN /&gt; Sometimes, the level of pollution caused depends on the environment in which the tool is being used. For example, e-mail is likely to cause more information pollution when used in a corporate environment than in a private setting.&lt;ref name=MI&gt;Managing Information. 2008. In Focus: Managing the 'Information Pollution'. ''Managing Information'', 14(10), pp. 10–12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mobile phones]] are likely to be particularly disruptive when used in a confined space like a train carriage.

== Effects {{Anchor|Effects}} ==
The effects of information pollution can be seen at a number of levels, from the individual to society in general. The impact on a commercial organisation is likely to be particularly detrimental.

===Effects on the individual===
At a personal level, information pollution will affect the capacity of the individual to evaluate options and find adequate solutions. In the most extreme case it can lead to information overload and this in turn to anxiety, decision paralysis and [[stress (biological)|stress]].&lt;ref name=MI /&gt; There also seem to be some negative effects on the learning process.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|author=Doomen, J.|year= 2009|title= Information Inflation|journal= Journal of Information Ethics|volume= 18|issue= 2|pages= 27|url=https://www.ris.uu.nl/ws/files/18774491/10._Information_Inflation.pdf|doi=10.3172/JIE.18.2.27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on society===
Aside from its impact on the individual, some authors argue that information pollution and information overload can cause loss of perspective and moral values.&lt;ref name=ARTHUR&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/01972243.1993.9960131|title=Zen and the art of ignoring information|journal=The Information Society|volume=9|pages=51|year=1993|last1=Arthur|first1=Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been used to explain the indifferent behaviour that modern society shows towards certain topics such as scientific discoveries, health warnings or politics.&lt;ref name=ORMAN /&gt; Because of the low quality and large quantity of the information received, people are becoming less sensitive to headlines and more cynical towards new messages.

===Impact on business===
As decision making is a key part of the business world. Information pollution may cause employees to become burdened with information overload and stress and therefore make slower or inadequate decisions.  Increased information processing time easily translates into loss of productivity and revenue. Flawed decision making will also increase the risk of critical errors taking place.&lt;ref name=ORMAN /&gt;&lt;ref name=MI /&gt;

Work interruptions caused by e-mail and instant messaging can also add considerably to wasted time and efficiency losses.&lt;ref name=MI /&gt;

== Proposed solutions {{Anchor|Proposed solutions}} ==
A number of solutions to the problem of information pollution have been proposed. These range from those based on personal and organisational management techniques to the type based on technology.
* Among the technology-based alternatives are the use of [[decision support systems]]&lt;ref name=ORMAN /&gt; and internet control panels which enable prioritisation of information.&lt;ref name=NIELSEN /&gt; It has also been advocated that technologies that create frequent interruptions should be replaced with less “polluting” options.&lt;ref name=BRAY /&gt;
* At an organisational level, some of the solutions proposed include the enforcement of e-mail usage policies&lt;ref name=MI /&gt; and the development of an information integrity assurance strategy, in similar lines to existing [[quality assurance]] frameworks.&lt;ref name=ORMAN /&gt;[[Time management]] and [[stress management]] techniques can be applied at a personal or organisational level. This would involve setting priorities and minimising the opportunities for interruptions. As an individual, writing clearly and concisely would also help to minimise information pollution effects on others.
* At a society level, in connection with the development of the [[information society]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/events/infoday/2007/gares.shtml Resolution A/RES/60/252], dated 27 April 2006, adopted by the UN General Assembly on World Summit on the Information Society.&lt;/ref&gt; appeared information pollution, evolving [[information ecology]] – associated with information [[hygiene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00207239808711157|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240515256_Information_ecology__a_viewpoint?ev=prf_pub |title=Information ecology ‐ a viewpoint |journal=International Journal of Environmental Studies |volume=54 |issue=3–4 |pages=241 |year=2007 |last1=Eryomin |first1=Alexei L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10394">Across the many fields concerned with '''interactivity''', including [[information science]], [[computer science]], [[human-computer interaction]], [[communication]], and [[industrial design]], there is little agreement over the meaning of the term "interactivity", although all are related to [[interaction]] with computers and other machines with a [[user interface]].

Multiple views on interactivity exist. In the "contingency view" of interactivity, there are three levels: 
#Not interactive, when a message is not related to previous messages; 
#Reactive, when a message is related only to one immediately previous message; and
#Interactive, when a message is related to a number of previous messages and to the relationship between them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheizaf Rafaeli]] defined Interactivity as "an expression of the extent that in a given series of communication exchanges, any third (or later) transmission (or message) is related to the degree to which previous exchanges referred to even earlier transmissions. Rafaeli, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

One body of research has made a strong distinction between interaction and interactivity. As the suffix 'ity' is used to form nouns that denote a quality or condition, this body of research has defined interactivity as the 'quality or condition of interaction'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Sedig | first=K. | last2=Parsons | first2=P. | last3=Babanski | first3=A. | year=2012 | title=Towards a characterization of interactivity in visual analytics | journal= Journal of Multimedia Processing and Technologies, Special Issue on Theory and Application of Visual Analytics | volume=3 | issue=1 | pages=12–28 | url=http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~pparsons/papers/JMPT2012.pdf | accessdate=July 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Parsons | first=P. | last2=Sedig | first2=K. | year=2014 | title=Adjustable properties of visual representations: Improving the quality of human-information interaction | journal= Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | volume=65 | issue=3 | pages=455–482 | doi=10.1002/asi.23002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Liang | first=H.-N. | last2=Parsons | first2=P. | last3=Wu | first3=H.-C. | last4=Sedig | first4=K. | year=2010 | title=An exploratory study of interactivity in visualization tools: 'Flow' of interaction | journal= Journal of Interactive Learning Research | volume=21 | issue=1 | pages=5–45 | url=http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~pparsons/papers/JILR2010.pdf | accessdate=July 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers suggest that the distinction between interaction and interactivity is important since interaction may be present in any given setting, but the quality of the interaction varies from low and high.

==Human to human communication==
Human communication is the basic example of [[interactive communication]] which involves two different processes; human to human interactivity and human to computer interactivity. Human-Human interactivity is the communication between people.

On the other hand, human to computer communication is the way that people communicate with [[new media]]. According to Rada Roy, the "[[Human Computer interaction]] model might consists of 4 main components which consist of HUMAN, COMPUTER, TASK ENVIRONMENT and MACHINE ENVIRONMENT. The two basic flows of information and control are assumed. The communication between people and computers; one must understand something about both and about the tasks which people perform with computers. A general model of human - computer interface emphasizes the flow of information and control at the human computer interface."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Rada | first1 = R. | last2 = Michailidis | first2 = Antonios | title = Interactive media | year = 1995 | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = New York | isbn = 0-387-94485-0 | page = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human to Human interactivity consists of many conceptualizations which are based on anthropomorphic definitions. For example, complex systems that detect and react to human behavior are sometimes called interactive. Under this perspective, interaction includes responses to human physical manipulation like movement, body language, and/or changes in [[:wikt:mental state|mental state]]s.

Media theorist Fernando Arturo Torres defined interactivity as, "a particular medium's ability to facilitate the properties necessary in an ideal conversation" ("Towards A Universal Theory Of Media Interactivity:  Developing A Proper Context," 1995, "Definition of Interactivity," para. 1).  His research determined that interactivity should be defined by "how well a medium facilitates two-way communication rather than by the technology of the medium."

==Human to artifact communication==
In the context of communication between a human and an [[Cultural artifact|artifact]], interactivity refers to the artifact’s interactive behaviour as experienced by the human user. This is different from other aspects of the artifact such as its visual appearance, its internal working, and the meaning of the signs it might mediate. For example, the interactivity of an [[iPod]] is not its physical shape and colour (its so-called "[[design]]"), its ability to play music, or its storage capacity—it is the behaviour of its [[user interface]] as experienced by its user. This includes the way the user moves their finger on its input wheel, the way this allows the selection of a tune in the playlist, and the way the user controls the volume.

An artifact’s interactivity is best perceived through use. A bystander can imagine how it would be like to use an artifact by watching others use it, but it is only through actual use that its interactivity is fully experienced and "felt". This is due to the [[kinesthetic]] nature of the interactive experience. It is similar to the difference between watching someone drive a car and actually driving it. It is only through the driving that one can experience and "feel" how this car differs from others.

New Media academic Vincent Maher defines interactivity as "the relation constituted by a symbolic interface between its referential, objective functionality and the subject."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nml.ru.ac.za/maher/?p=7 Vincent Maher - Media in Transition » Towards a definition of interactivity suitable for Critical Theory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computing science ==
The term "[[look and feel]]" is often used to refer to the specifics of a computer system's [[user interface]]. Using this [[metaphor]], the "look" refers to its visual design, while the "feel" refers to its interactivity. Indirectly this can be regarded as an informal definition of interactivity.

For a more detailed discussion of how interactivity has been conceptualized in the human-computer interaction literature, and how the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of the French philosopher [[Merleau-Ponty]] can shed light on the user experience, see (Svanaes 2000).

In [[computer science]], interactive refers to software which accepts and responds to input from people—for example, data or commands. Interactive software includes most popular programs, such as [[word processor]]s or [[spreadsheet]] [[application software|applications]]. By comparison, '''noninteractive''' programs operate without human contact; examples of these include [[compiler]]s and [[batch processing]] applications. If the response is complex enough it is said that the system is conducting social interaction and some systems try to achieve this through the implementation of [[social interface]]s.

Also, there is the notion of kinds of user interaction, like the [[Rich UI]].

==Creating interactivity==
Web page authors can integrate [[JavaScript]] coding to create interactive web pages. Sliders, date pickers, drag and dropping are just some of the many enhancements that can be provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://friendlybit.com/js/improving-interactivity-with-javascript/ |title=Improving interactivity with Javascript |publisher=Friendly Bit |date= |accessdate=2011-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various authoring tools are available for creating various kinds of interactivities. Some common platforms for creating interactivities include [[Adobe Flash]] and [[Microsoft Silverlight]]. Notable authoring tools for creating interactivities include Harbinger's [[Elicitus]].

eLearning makes use of a concept called an [[interaction model]]. Using an interaction model, any person can create interactivities in a very short period of time. Some of the interaction models presented with authoring tools fall under various categories like games, puzzles, simulation tools, presentation tools, etc., which can be completely customized.

The '''International Social Cognition Network''' (ISCON) was formed in 2003 as a joint enterprise between the [[European Social Cognition Network]] (ESCON) and the [[Person Memory Interest Group]] (PMIG) to act as an umbrella society to advance the international study of [[social cognition]]. Among the objectives of ISCON are to advance the understanding of social cognition by encouraging research and the preparation of papers and reports, holding meetings for the presentation of scientific papers, sponsoring or issuing publications containing scientific papers and other relevant material, establishing professional honors and awards to recognize excellence in social cognition research, and cooperating with other scientific and professional societies.&lt;ref&gt;(International Social Cognition Network: http://www.socialcognition.info)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official Journal==

The official journal of ISCON is ''[[Social Cognition (journal)|Social Cognition]]'', published bimonthly by [[Guilford Press]].&lt;ref&gt;(Social Cognition journal: http://guilfordjournals.com/loi/soco)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conferences==

ISCON sponsors the Social Cognition Preconference that precedes the annual conference of the [[Society for Personality and Social Psychology]]. It organizes a similar preconference for the tri-annual meeting of the [[European Association of Social Psychology]]. ISCON also is a sponsor of the annual conference of the Person Memory Interest Group that precedes the annual conference of the [[Society of Experimental Social Psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;(Person Memory Interest Group: http://www.pmigconference.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

In cooperation with the Personal Memory Interest Group, ISCON honors career contributions to the study of social cognition with the [[Thomas Ostrom|Thomas M. Ostrom]] Award. Contributions of junior scientists are honored annually with the Early Career Award. Each year, ISCON also gives an award for the Best Social Cognition Paper and recognizes outstanding research by graduate students with the Best Poster Award.&lt;ref&gt;(International Social Cognition Network: http://www.socialcognition.info)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4166">'''Iso-damping''' is a desirable system property referring to a state where the open-loop phase [[Bode plot]] is flat—i.e., the phase derivative with respect to the frequency is zero, at a given frequency called the "tangent frequency", &lt;math&gt;{\omega}_c&lt;/math&gt;.  At the "tangent frequency" the [[Nyquist plot|Nyquist curve]] of the open-loop system tangentially touches the sensitivity circle and the phase Bode is locally flat which implies that the system will be more robust to gain variations. For systems that exhibit iso-damping property, the [[Overshoot (signal)|overshoots]] of the closed-loop [[step response]]s will remain almost constant for different values of the controller gain. This will ensure that the closed-loop system is robust to gain variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Yang Quan|last1=Chen|first2=K. L.|last2=Moore|title=Relay feedback tuning of robust PID controllers with iso-damping property|journal=IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics|doi=10.1109/TSMCB.2004.837950|volume=35|issue=1|year=2005|pages=23–31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The iso-damping property can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;\frac{d \angle G(s)}{ds}{|}_{s = j\omega_c} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently:

: &lt;math&gt;\angle \frac{dG(s)}{ds}{|}_{s = j\omega_c} = \angle G(s){|}_{s = j\omega},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega_c&lt;/math&gt; is the tangent frequency and &lt;math&gt;G(s)&lt;/math&gt; is the open-loop system transfer function.

==Bode's ideal transfer function==
In the middle of the 20th century, [[Hendrik Wade Bode|Bode]] proposed the first idea involving the use of [[fractional-order control]]lers in a feedback problem by what is known as '''Bode’s ideal transfer function'''. Bode proposed that the ideal shape of the [[Nyquist plot]] for the open loop frequency response is a straight line in the complex plane, which provides theoretically infinite [[Bode plot#Gain margin and phase margin|gain margin]]. Ideal open-loop transfer function is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;L(s) = \left(\frac{s}{\omega_{gc}}\right)^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\omega}_{gc}&lt;/math&gt; is the desired gain cross over frequency and &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt; is the slope of the ideal cut-off characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=H. W.|last=Bode|title=Network Analysis and Feedback Amplifier Design|publisher=Van Nostrand|location=New York|year=1945}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bode diagrams of &lt;math&gt;L(s)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;-2 &lt; \alpha &lt; -1&lt;/math&gt;, are very simple. The amplitude curve is a straight line of constant slope &lt;math&gt;20\alpha &lt;/math&gt; dB/dec, and the phase curve is a horizontal line at &lt;math&gt; \frac{\alpha \pi}{2} &lt;/math&gt; rad. The [[Nyquist plot|Nyquist curve]] consists of a straight line through the origin with &lt;math&gt;\arg(L( j\omega)) = \frac{\alpha \pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; rad.

The major benefit achieved through this structure is iso-damping, i.e. overshoot being independent of the payload or the system gain. The usage of fractional elements for description of ideal Bode's control loop is one of the most promising applications of [[fractional calculus]] in the [[process control]] field.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=R. S.|last1=Barbosa|first2=J. A.|last2=Tenreiro Machado|first3=I. M.|last3=Ferreira|title=Tuning of PID controllers based on Bode's ideal transfer function|journal=[[Nonlinear Dynamics (journal)|Nonlinear Dynamics]]|volume=38|issue=1|pages=305–321|year=2004|doi=10.1007/s11071-004-3763-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bode's ideal control loop frequency response has the fractional integrator shape and provides the iso-damping property around the gain crossover frequency. This is due to the fact that the [[phase margin]] and the maximum overshoot are defined by one parameter only (the fractional power of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;), and are independent of open-loop gain.

Bode's ideal loop transfer function is probably the first design method that addressed [[Robust control|robustness]] explicitly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33090">'''Job characteristics theory''' is a [[theory]] of [[work design]]. It provides “a set of implementing [[principle]]s for [[job enrichment|enriching jobs]] in organizational settings”.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham2005"&gt;Hackman, J. R. &amp; Oldham, G. R. (2005). How job characteristics theory happened. The Oxford handbook of management theory: The process of theory development, 151-170.&lt;/ref&gt; The original version of job characteristics theory proposed a [[model theory|model]] of five “core” job characteristics (i.e. skill variety, task identity, task significance, [[autonomy]], and [[feedback]]) that affect five work-related [[outcome (probability)|outcome]]s (i.e. [[motivation]], [[Contentment|satisfaction]], [[performance]], and [[absenteeism]] and [[turnover (employment)|turnover]]) through three psychological states (i.e. experienced meaningfulness, experienced responsibility, and knowledge of results).&lt;ref name=HackmanOldham1975&gt;Hackman, J. R. &amp; Oldham, G. R. (1975). Development of job diagnostic survey. Journal of Applied Psychology, 60, 159-170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Work redesign first got its start in the 1960s. Up until then, the prevailing [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]] was that jobs should be simplified in order to maximize [[production (economics)|production]], however it was found that when subjected to highly routinized and repetitive tasks, the benefits of simplification sometimes disappeared due to worker dissatisfaction. It was proposed that jobs should be enriched in ways that boosted motivation, instead of just simplified to a string of repetitive tasks.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham2010"&gt;Oldham, G. R., &amp; Hackman, J. R. (2010) Not what it was and not what it will be: The future of job design research. Journal of Organizational Behavior, 31, 463-479.&lt;/ref&gt; It is from this viewpoint that Job Characteristics Theory emerged.

In 1975, Greg R. Oldham&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.tulane.edu/faculty/facinfo.php?RecordID=goldham@tulane.edu/ http://business.tulane.edu/faculty/facinfo.php?RecordID=goldham@tulane.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; and J. Richard Hackman&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~hackman/ http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~hackman/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925052537/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~hackman/ |date=2013-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; constructed the original version of the Job Characteristics Theory (JCT), which is based on earlier work by Turner and Lawrence&lt;ref name="TurnerandLawrence1965"&gt;Turner, A. N., &amp; Lawrence, P. R. (1965).  Industrial jobs and the worker. Boston: Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; and Hackman and Lawler.&lt;ref name="HackmanandLawler1971"&gt;Hackman, J. R., &amp; Lawler, E. E. (1971). Employee reactions to job characteristics. Journal of Applied Psychology Monograph, 55(3), 259-286.&lt;/ref&gt; Turner and Lawrence,&lt;ref name="TurnerandLawrence1965"/&gt; provided a foundation of objective characteristics of jobs in work design. Further, Hackman and Lawler&lt;ref name="HackmanandLawler1971"/&gt; indicated the direct effect of job characteristics on employee's work related attitudes and behaviors and, more importantly, the individual differences in need for development, which is called Growth Need Strength in Job Characteristics Theory.

In 1980, Hackman and Oldham presented the final form of the Job Characteristics Theory in their book ''Work Redesign''. The main changes included the addition of two more [[moderator variable|moderators]]- ''Knowledge and Skill'' and ''Context Satisfaction'', removal of the work outcomes of absenteeism and turnover, and increased focus on ''Internal [[Work Motivation]]''. Several of the outcome variables were removed or renamed as well. Concentration was shifted to the affective outcomes following results from empirical studies that showed weak support for the relationship between the psychological states and behavioral outcomes.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cleave, S. (1993). A test of the job characteristics model with administrative positions in physical education and sport. Journal of Sport Management, 7(3), 228-242.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rungtusanatham, M., &amp; Anderson, J. C. (1996). A clarification on conceptual and methodological issues related to the job characteristics model. Journal of Operations Management, 14(4), 357-367.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the theory, Oldham and Hackman also created two [[Measuring instrument|instrument]]s, the Job Diagnostic Survey (JDS) and the Job Rating Form (JRF), for assessing constructs of the theory.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham1980"&gt;Hackman, J. R. &amp; Oldham, G. R. (1980). Work redesign,(Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA).&lt;/ref&gt; The JDS directly measures jobholders' perceptions of the five core job characteristics, their experienced psychological states, their Growth Need Strength, and outcomes. The JRF was designed to obtain the [[Educational assessment|assessment]]s from external observers, such as [[supervisor]]s or [[researcher]]s, of the core job characteristics.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham1975"/&gt;

==Important variables==
According to the final version of the theory, five core job characteristics should prompt three critical psychological states, which lead to many favorable personal and work outcomes. The moderators Growth Need Strength, Knowledge and Skill, and Context Satisfaction should moderate the links between the job characteristics and the psychological states, and the psychological states and the outcomes.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham1980"/&gt;

===Core job characteristics===
* ''Skill Variety'': The degree to which a job requires various activities, requiring the worker to develop a variety of skills and talents. Jobholders can experience more meaningfulness in jobs that require several different skills and abilities than when the jobs are elementary and routine.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham1975"/&gt;
* ''Task Identity'': The degree to which the job requires the jobholders to identify and complete a workpiece with a visible outcome. Workers experience more meaningfulness in a job when they are involved in the entire process rather than just being responsible for a part of the work.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham1975"/&gt;
* ''Task Significance'': The degree to which the job affects other people’s lives. The influence can be either in the immediate organization or in the external environment. Employees feel more meaningfulness in a job that substantially improves either psychological or physical [[well-being]] of others than a job that has limited effect on anyone else.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham1975"/&gt;  
* ''Autonomy'': The degree to which the job provides the employee with significant freedom, independence, and discretion to plan out the work and determine the procedures in the job. For jobs with a high level of autonomy, the outcomes of the work depend on the workers’ own efforts, [[initiative]]s, and decisions; rather than on the instructions from a manager or a manual of job procedures. In such cases, the jobholders experience greater personal responsibility for their own successes and failures at work.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham1975"/&gt;
* ''Feedback'': The degree to which the worker has [[knowledge of results]]. This is clear, specific, detailed, ''[[Action item|actionable]]'' information about the effectiveness of his or her job performance. When workers receive clear, actionable information about their work performance, they have better overall knowledge of the effect of their work activities, and what specific actions they need to take (if any) to improve their productivity.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham1975"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Ralph. Motivating Technical Professionals Today. ''[[IEEE Technology Management Council|IEEE Engineering Management Review]]'', Vol. 41, No. 1, March 2013, pp. 28-38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical psychological states===

* ''Experienced Meaningfulness of the Work'': The degree to which the jobholder experiences the work as intrinsically meaningful and can present his or her value to other people and/or the external environment.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham1975"/&gt;
* ''Experienced Responsibility for Outcome of the Work'': The degree to which the worker feels he or she is accountable and responsible for the results of the work.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham1975"/&gt;
* ''Knowledge of Results of the Work Activities'': The degree to which the jobholder knows how well he or she is performing.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham1975"/&gt;

===Outcomes===

Adopted from earlier work&lt;ref&gt;Blauner, R. (1964). Alienation and freedom. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, C. R., and Guest, C. H. (1952). The man on the assembly line. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hackman, J. R., &amp; Lawler, E. E. (1971). Employee reactions to job characteristics. Journal of Applied Psychology, 55(3), 259.&lt;/ref&gt; the personal and work outcomes of the initial theory were: ''Internal Work Motivation'', ''Job Satisfaction'', ''Absenteeism and Turnover'', and ''Performance Quality''. However, the 1980 revisions to the original model included removing absenteeism and turnover, and breaking performance into ''Quality of Work'' and ''Quantity of Work''.

===Moderators===

* ''Growth Need Strength (GNS)'': GNS is the strength of a person's need for personal [[accomplishment]], learning, and development”.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham2005"/&gt; The theory posits that Growth Need Strength moderates both the relationship of core job characteristics and psychological states, and the relationship between psychological states and outcomes.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham1975"/&gt;
* ''Knowledge and Skill'': The level of knowledge and skill the worker possesses can moderate the relationship between the mediators and the job characteristics and outcomes. For motivating jobs, adequate knowledge and skill lead to experiencing the critical psychological states and better outcomes, while insufficient knowledge and skill discourage the psychological states and result in more negative outcomes. Unmotivating jobs don’t allow the worker to experience the psychological states at all, thus knowledge and skill have no effect.&lt;ref name="Kulik1987"&gt;Kulik, C. T., Oldham, G. R., &amp; Hackman, J. R. (1987). Work design as an approach to person-environment fit. Journal of vocational behavior, 31(3), 278-296.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Context Satisfaction'': The context of the job also affects employees’ experience. The authors suggest that when workers are satisfied with things like their managers, pay, co-workers, and job security they respond more positively to highly motivating jobs and less positively when they are not satisfied. The reason being that they must use attentional resources to handle the undesirable work context, which distracts from the richness otherwise inherent in the job.&lt;ref name="Kulik1987"/&gt;

==Propositions==
The three critical psychological states of job characteristic theory (JCT) draw upon cognitive motivation theory and some previous work on identifying the presence of certain psychological states could lead to favorable outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Argryis, C. (1964). Integrating the individual and the organization. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawler, E. E. (1969). Job design and employee motivation. Personnel Psychology, 22, 426-435.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porter L. W., &amp;  Lawler, E. E. (1968). Managerial attitudes and performance. Homewood, Ill.: Irwin.&lt;/ref&gt; JCT provided the chance to systematically assessed the relationship between the previously discovered psychological states ('Experienced Meaningfulness, 'Experienced Responsibility, and Knowledge of Results) and outcomes. More importantly, previous work on work design showed job characteristics can predict individual performance, but did not provide “why” and “how” this relationship existed. Job Characteristics Theory filled this gap by building a bridge between job characteristics and work-related outcomes through the use of the three critical psychological states.
 
The three psychological states, which are also the conceptual core of the theory, include (1) Experienced Meaningfulness of the Work, (2) Experienced Responsibility for the Outcomes of the Work, and (3) Knowledge of the Results of Work Activities. These psychological states are theorized to mediate the relationship between job characteristics and work-related outcomes. According to the theory, these three critical psychological states are noncompensatory conditions, meaning jobholders have to experience all three critical psychological states to achieve the outcomes proposed in the model.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham1976"&gt;Hackman, J. R. &amp; Oldham, G. R. (1976). Motivation through the design of work: Test of a theory. Organizational Behavior and Human Performance, 16, 250-279.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when workers experience the three psychological states, they feel good about themselves when they perform well. These positive feelings, in turn, reinforce the workers to keep performing well.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham2005"/&gt;

According to the theory, certain core job characteristics are responsible for each psychological state: skill variety, task identity, and task significance shape the experienced meaningfulness; autonomy affects experienced responsibility, and feedback contributes to the knowledge of results. Previous research found that four job characteristics (autonomy, variety, identity, and feedback) could increase workers’ performance, satisfaction, and attendance.&lt;ref name="TurnerandLawrence1965"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HackmanandLawler1971"/&gt; Task significance was derived from Greg Oldham’s own work experience as an assembly line worker. Though his job did not provide task variety or identity, he still experienced meaningfulness through the realization that others depended on his work. This realization led to the inclusion of task significance as another job characteristic that would influence experienced meaningfulness of the job. Thus, job characteristics theory proposed the five core job characteristics that could predict work related outcomes.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham2005"/&gt;

===Motivating potential score===
When a job has a high score on the five core characteristics, it is likely to generate three psychological states, which can lead to positive work outcomes, such as high internal work motivation, high satisfaction with the work, high quality work performance, and low absenteeism and turnover. This tendency for high levels of job characteristics to lead to positive outcomes can be formulated by the motivating potential score (MPS). Hackman and Oldham explained that the MPS is an index of the “degree to which a job has an overall high standing on the person's degree of motivation...and, therefore, is likely to prompt favorable personal and work outcomes”:

The motivating potential score (MPS) can be calculated, using the core dimensions discussed above, as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;{\text{MPS}}=\frac{\text{Skill Variety + Task Identity + Task Significance } }{\text{3} }{\text{ x Autonomy x Feedback}}&lt;/math&gt;

Jobs that are high in motivating potential must be also high on at least one of the three factors that lead to experienced meaningfulness, and also must be high on both Autonomy and Feedback.&lt;ref name=Steel2012&gt;Steel, Piers. Motivation: Theory and Applied. Boston, MA: Pearson Learning Solutions, 2012. Print. pp. 49&lt;/ref&gt; If a job has a high MPS, the job characteristics model predicts that motivation, performance and job satisfaction will be positively affected and the likelihood of negative outcomes, such as absenteeism and turnover, will be reduced.&lt;ref name=Steel2012 /&gt;

According to the equation above, a low standing on either autonomy or feedback will substantially compromise a job's MPS, because autonomy and feedback are the only job characteristics expected to foster experienced responsibility and knowledge of results, respectively. On the contrary, a low score on one of the three job characteristics that lead to experienced meaningfulness may not necessarily reduce a job's MPS, because a strong presence of one of those three attributes can offset the absence of the others.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham2005"/&gt;

===Individual difference factor===
In response to one of the disadvantages of [[Two-factor theory|Motivator–Hygiene Theory]],&lt;ref name="Herzberg1959"&gt;Herzberg, F., Mausner, B., &amp; Snyderman, B. (1959). The motivation to work. Wiley. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Job Characteristics Theory added an individual difference factor into the model. While Herzberg et al. took into account the importance of intrinsically and extrinsically motivating job characteristics there was no consideration of individual differences.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham1976"/&gt; The importance of individual differences had been demonstrated by previous work showing that some individuals are more likely to positively respond to an enriched job environment than others.&lt;ref&gt;Hulin, C. L. (1971). Individual differences and job enrichment: The case against general treatments. New perspectives in job enrichment, 159-191.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the original version of the theory posits an individual difference characteristic, Growth Need Strength (GNS), that moderates the effect of the core job characteristics on outcomes. Jobholders with high Growth Need Strength should respond more positively to the opportunities provided by jobs with high levels of the five core characteristics compared to low GNS jobholders.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham1975"/&gt;

[[Frederick Herzberg|Herzberg]] et al.’s&lt;ref name="Herzberg1959"/&gt; Motivator–Hygiene Theory, aka Two-factor Theory, an influence on Job Characteristics Theory, sought to increase motivation and satisfaction through enriching jobs.The theory predicts changes in “motivators”, which are intrinsic to the work, (such as [[Recognition (sociology)|recognition]], [[advancement (inheritance)|advancement]], and [[achievement (heraldry)|achievement]]) will lead to higher levels of employee motivation and satisfaction; while “hygiene factors”, which are extrinsic to the work itself, (such as company policies and [[salary]]) can lead to lower levels of dissatisfaction, but will not actually effect satisfaction or motivation.

===Adaptive structuration theory===
{{Main| Structuration theory}}
Adaptive structuration theory&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerardine DeSanctis|DeSanctis, G.]], &amp; Poole, M. S. (1994). Capturing the [[complexity]] in advanced technology use: Adaptive structuration theory. Organization Science, 5 (2), 121–147.&lt;/ref&gt; provides a way to look at the interaction between technology’s intended and actual use in an organization, and how it can influence different work-related outcomes.

==Variations==

===Reverse scoring correction===
Idaszak and Drasgow&lt;ref name="IdaszakDrasgow1987"&gt;Idaszak, J. R., &amp; Drasgow, F. (1987). A revision of the Job Diagnostic Survey: Elimination of a measurement artifact. Journal of Applied Psychology, 72(1), 69.&lt;/ref&gt; provided a corrected version of the Job Diagnostic Survey that corrected for one of the measurement errors in the instrument. It had been suggested that reverse scoring on several of the questions was to blame for the inconsistent studies looking at the factors involved in the Job Diagnostic Survey.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, R. J., Billings, R. S., &amp; Nilan, K. J. (1985). Confirmatory factor analysis of the Job Diagnostic Survey: Good news and bad news. Journal of Applied Psychology, 70(3), 461.&lt;/ref&gt; Following a [[factor analysis]], Idaszak and Drasgow found six factors rather than the theorized five characteristics proposed by the Job Characteristics Theory. Upon further investigation, they were able to show that the sixth factor was made up of the reverse coded items. The authors rephrased the questions, ran the analysis again, and found it removed the [[measurement error]].&lt;ref name="IdaszakDrasgow1987"/&gt;

===GN–GO model===
Due to the inconsistent findings about the validity of Growth Need Strength as a moderator of the Job characteristic-outcomes relationship, Graen, Scandura, and Graen&lt;ref name="Graen1987"&gt;Graen, G. B., Scandura, T. A., &amp; Graen, M. R. (1986). A field experimental test of the moderating effects of growth need strength on productivity. Journal of Applied Psychology, 71(3), 484.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the GN–GO model, which added Growth Opportunity as another moderator. They suggested there isn’t a simple positive relationship between motivation and Growth Need Strength, but instead there is an underlying incremental (stairstep) relationship with various levels of Growth Opportunity. Growth Opportunity increments are described as “events that change either the characteristics of the job itself or the understanding of the job itself”.&lt;ref name="Graen1987"/&gt; It was hypothesized that as people high in Growth Need Strength met each level of Growth Opportunity they could be motivated to increase their performance, but when people low on Growth Need Strength met these same increments their performance would either maintain or degrade. Field studies found more support for the GN–GO model than the original Growth Need Strength moderation.&lt;ref name="Graen1987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Medcof, J. W. (1991). A test of a revision of the job characteristics model. Applied Psychology, 40(4), 381-393.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extension of characteristics and outcomes===
Humphrey, Nahrgang, and Morgeson&lt;ref name="Humphrey2007"&gt;Humphrey, S. E., Nahrgang, J. D., &amp; Morgeson, F. P. (2007). Integrating motivational, social, and contextual work design features: A meta-analytic summary and theoretical extension of the work design literature. Journal of Applied Psychology, 92(5), 1332.&lt;/ref&gt; extended the original model by incorporating many different outcomes and job characteristics. The authors divided the revised set of Job Characteristics into three sections- Motivational, Social, and Work Context Characteristics; and the outcomes were portioned out into four parts- Behavioral, Attitudinal, Role Perception, and Well-being Outcomes. Results showed strong relationships between some of the expanded characteristics and outcomes, suggesting that there are more options for enriching jobs than the original theory would suggest.&lt;ref name="Humphrey2007"/&gt;

===Psychological ownership===
Taking from earlier empirical research on Job Characteristics Theory and [[ownership (psychology)|Psychological Ownership]], researchers developed a model that combined the two theories.&lt;ref name="Pierce2009"&gt;Pierce, J. L., Jussila, I., &amp; Cummings, A. (2009). Psychological ownership within the job design context: Revision of the job characteristics model. Journal of Organizational Behavior, 30(4), 477-496.&lt;/ref&gt; They replaced the psychological states of the Job Characteristics Theory with Psychological Ownership of the job as the mediator between job characteristics and outcomes. In addition to the positive personal and work outcomes of Job Characteristics Theory, negative outcomes (e.g. [[Territory (animal)|Territorial Behaviors]], [[change management|Resistance to Change]], and Burden of Responsibility) were added.&lt;ref name="Pierce2009"/&gt;

==Empirical tests==
Since its inception, Job Characteristics Theory has been scrutinized extensively.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham2005"/&gt; The first empirical tests of the theory came from Hackman and Oldham themselves. The authors found the “internal consistency [[reliability theory|reliability]] of the scales and the [[discriminant validity]] of the items” to be “satisfactory”.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham1975"/&gt; They also tried to assess the [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] of the measure by having the supervisors and the researchers evaluate the job in addition to the jobholders. More importantly, the authors reported the relationships predicted by the model were supported by their analysis.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham1976"/&gt;

Following these publications, over 200 empirical articles were published examining Job Characteristics Theory over the next decade.&lt;ref name="Fried1987"&gt;Fried, Y., &amp; Ferris, G. R. (1987). The validity of the job characteristics model: A review and meta‐analysis. Personnel Psychology, 40(2), 287-322.&lt;/ref&gt; Fried and Ferris&lt;ref name="Fried1987"/&gt; summarized the research on Job Characteristics Theory and found “modest support” overall. Fried and Ferris&lt;ref name="Fried1987"/&gt; mentioned seven general areas of criticism in their review, which are discussed below:

* '''Relation of objective and perceived job characteristics''': Whether or not there is accuracy in the worker's perceptions of job characteristics is an important topic of concern for Job Characteristics Theory. Inaccurate ratings of the five job characteristics can be detrimental to the job enrichment process because the Job Diagnostic Survey, which is instrumental in determining what enrichment needs to take place, relies on jobholders' perceptions.&lt;ref name="Fried1987"/&gt;
* '''Influential forces on job perceptions''': [[Social cue]]s, personal factors, and what order the portions of the Job Diagnostic Survey is given can influence job perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Salancik, G. R.]], &amp; [[Jeffrey Pfeffer|Pfeffer, J.]] (1977). An examination of need-satisfaction models of job attitudes. Administrative Science Quarterly, 22, 427-456.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Salancik, G. R.]], &amp; [[Jeffrey Pfeffer|Pfeffer, J.]] (1978). A social information processing approach to job attitudes and job design. Administrative Science Quarterly, 23, 224-253.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, C. A., Parlette, G. N., &amp; Bloom, J. R. (1980). Perceptual measures of task characteristics: The biasing effects of differing frames of reference and job attitudes. Academy of Management Journal, 23(1), 118-131.&lt;/ref&gt; These “irrelevant cues” could color one’s perception of the job characteristics.&lt;ref name="Fried1987"/&gt;
* '''Perceived versus objective job characteristics-outcomes relationships''': Researchers have also been concerned about the objectivity of jobholders’ assessment of job characteristics and work outcomes, however studies have tended to show that this fear is largely unfounded.&lt;ref&gt;Spector, P. E., &amp; Jex, S. M. (1991). Relations of job characteristics from multiple data sources with employee affect, absence, turnover intentions, and health. Journal of Applied Psychology, 76(1), 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oldham, G. R., Hackman, J. R., &amp; Pearce, J. L. (1976). Conditions under which employees respond positively to enriched work. Journal of Applied Psychology, 61(4), 395.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Factors of the Job Diagnostic Survey''': The support for the five dimensions of job characteristics in Job Characteristics Theory have mixed support among the studies examining the factor solutions of the Job Diagnostic Survey.&lt;ref&gt;Champoux, J. E. (1978). A preliminary examination of some complex job scope-growth need strength interactions. Proceedings of the Academy of Management, 38, 59-63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wall, T. D., Clegg, C. W., &amp; Jackson, P. R. (1978). An evaluation of the job characteristics model. Journal of Occupational Psychology, 51(2), 183-196.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The job characteristics-outcomes relationships''': Researchers have argued job characteristics have a stronger relationship with personal outcomes, than with work outcomes.&lt;ref name="Humphrey2007"/&gt; More importantly, it was found that the Motivating Potential Score was not as predictive as adding up rater's assessment of the five job characteristics.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fried1987"/&gt;
* '''Mediator effects of critical psychological states''': Researchers have found support for the mediating role of psychological states between job characteristics and personal outcomes, but didn’t find similar evidence for the mediation on work outcomes.&lt;ref name="Humphrey2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnold1980"&gt;Arnold, H. J., &amp; House, R. J. (1980). Methodological and substantive extensions to the job characteristics model of motivation. Organizational Behavior and Human Performance, 25, 161-183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renn, R. W., &amp; Vandenberg, R. J. (1995). The critical psychological states: An underrepresented component in job characteristics model research. Journal of Management, 21(2), 279-303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Behson, S. J., Eddy, E. R., &amp; Lorenzet, S. J. (2000). The importance of the critical psychological states in the job characteristics model: A meta-analytic and structural equations modeling examination. Current research in social psychology, 5, 170-189.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Growth Need Strength’s use as a moderator''': There have been several studies investigating the validity of Growth Need Strength as a moderator. Many of the studies reported the moderating effect of Growth Need Strength to be low.&lt;ref name="Graen1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnold1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans1979"&gt;Evans, M. G., Kiggundu, M. N., House, R. J. (1979). A partial test and extension of the job characteristics model of motivation. Organizational Behavior and Human Performance, 24, 354-381.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New developments==
Over the years since Job Characteristics Theory’s introduction into the organizational literature, there have been many changes to the field and to work itself. Oldham and Hackman suggest that the areas more fruitful for development in work design are social motivation, job crafting, and teams.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham2010"/&gt;

Social sources of motivation are becoming more important due to the changing nature of work in this country. More jobs are requiring higher levels of client-employee interaction, as well as increasing interdependence among employees. With this in mind, it would make sense to investigate the effect the social aspects have on affective and behavioral outcomes.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham2010"/&gt;

While Job Characteristics Theory was mainly focused on the organization’s responsibility for manipulating job characteristics to enrich jobs there has been a considerable buzz in the literature regarding job crafting. In job crafting the employee has some control over their role in the organization. Hackman and Oldham point out there are many avenues of inquiry regarding job crafting such as: what are the benefits of job crafting, are the benefits due to the job crafting process itself  or the actual changes made to the job, and what are the negative effects of job crafting?&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham2010"/&gt;

Finally, they brought up the potential research directions relevant to team work design. Specifically, they discuss the need to understand when to use work-design aimed at the individual or team level in order to increase performance, and what type of team is best suited to particular tasks.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham2010"/&gt;

==Practical implications==
Job Characteristics Theory is firmly entrenched within the work design (also called job enrichment) literature, moreover the theory has become one of the most cited in all of the [[organizational behavior]] field.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham1976"/&gt; In practical terms, Job Characteristics Theory provides a framework for increasing employees’ motivation, satisfaction, and performance through enriching job characteristics.

Job Characteristics Theory has been embraced by researchers and used in a multitude of professions and organizations.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham2005"/&gt; In the applied domain, Hackman and Oldham have reported that a number of [[consulting firm]]s have employed their model or modified it to meet their needs.&lt;ref name="HackmanOldham2005"/&gt;

Many [[gas]]es have [[toxicity|toxic]] properties, which are often assessed using the [[LC50]] (median lethal dose) measure. In the United States, many of these gases have been assigned an [[NFPA 704]] health rating of 4 (may be fatal) or 3 (may cause serious or permanent injury), and/or exposure limits [Threshold limit value|TLV], [[Permissible exposure limit|TWA]] or [[Short-term exposure limit|STEL]]) determined by the [[ACGIH]] professional association. Some, but by no means all, toxic gases are detectable by [[odor]], which can serve as a warning. Among the best known toxic gases are [[carbon monoxide]], [[chlorine]], [[nitrogen dioxide]] and [[phosgene]].

==Definition==
*Toxic: it is a chemical that has a median lethal concentration (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) in air of more than 200 [[parts per million]] (ppm) but not more than 2,000 parts per million by volume of gas or vapor, or more than 2 milligrams per liter but not more than 20 milligrams per liter of mist, fume or dust, when administered by continuous inhalation for 1 hour (or less if death occurs within 1 hour) to albino rats weighing between 200 and 300&amp;nbsp;grams each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Fire Code California Code of Regulations,Title 24, Part 9, Chapter 2 - Definitions|url=http://www.ecodes.biz/ecodes_support/free_resources/2013California/13Fire/PDFs/Chapter%202%20-%20Definitions.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[NFPA 704]]: Materials that, under emergency conditions, can cause serious or permanent injury are given a Health Hazard rating of 3. Their acute inhalation toxicity corresponds to those vapors or gases having LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values greater than 1,000 ppm but less than or equal to 3,000 ppm. Materials that, under emergency conditions, can be lethal are given a Health Hazard rating of 4. Their acute inhalation toxicity corresponds to those vapors or gases having LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values less than or equal to 1,000 ppm.

'''Michael C. B. Ashley''' is an Australian astronomer and professor at the [[University of New South Wales]], in [[Sydney]]. He is most famous for his work in Antarctica,  with the study of the [[Astronomical seeing|seeing]] capability at [[Dome C#Astronomical observatory|Dome C]].

==Antarctica and Dome C==
In September 2004, [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] published a report written by Jon Lawrence, Michael Ashley, Andrei Tokovinin, and Tony Travouillon on the seeing abilities of astronomical telescopes in Antarctica. The paper concluded that Dome C would be "the best ground-based site to develop a new astronomical observatory."&lt;ref name="Nature1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Exceptional astronomical seeing conditions above Dome C in Antarctica|last1=Lawrence|first1=Jon|last2=Ashley|first2=Michael|last3=Tokovinin|first3=Andrei|last4=Travouillon|first4=Tony|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=431|date=Sep 16, 2004|url=http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~mcba/pubs/a60.pdf|accessdate=June 30, 2009|doi=10.1038/nature02929|issue=7006|pmid=15372024|pages=278–81|bibcode = 2004Natur.431..278L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The data used in this report was collected by a remote control experiment run through the French-Italian Concordia Station near Dome C.&lt;ref name="Ashley3"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Why has it taken so long to measure the seeing at Dome C? |url=http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/nature/#13 |publisher=University of New South Wales |date=Sep 16, 2004 |accessdate=June 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215183040/http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/nature/ |archivedate=February 15, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ashley and his team have been to Antarctica on four separate trips, in 1995, 1998, 2001, and 2004 for earlier experiments, such as measurements of the near-infrared quality of the brightness of the sky.&lt;ref name="Ashley"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Michael C.

'''''Micrographia: or Some Physiological Descriptions of Minute Bodies Made by Magnifying Glasses. With Observations and Inquiries Thereupon.''''' is a historically  significant book by [[Robert Hooke]] about his observations through various lenses. It is particularly notable for being the first book to illustrate insects, plants etc. as seen through microscopes. Published in January 1665, the first major publication of the [[Royal Society]], it became the first scientific best-seller{{fact|date=February 2017}}, inspiring a wide public interest in the new science of [[microscopy]].  It is also notable for coining the biological term ''[[cell (biology)|cell]]''.

==Observations==
Hooke most famously describes a [[fly]]'s eye and a plant [[cell (biology)|cell]] (where he coined that term because plant cells, which are walled, reminded him of the cells in a [[honeycomb]]&lt;ref name="Hooke"&gt;"&lt;cite&gt;... I could exceedingly plainly perceive it to be all perforated and porous, much like a Honey-comb, but that the pores of it were not regular [..] these pores, or cells, [..] were indeed the first microscopical pores I ever saw, and perhaps, that were ever seen, for I had not met with any Writer or Person, that had made any mention of them before this. . .&lt;/cite&gt;" – Hooke describing his observations on a thin slice of cork. [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/hooke.html Robert Hooke]&lt;/ref&gt;). Known for its spectacular copperplate engravings of the miniature world, particularly its fold-out plates of [[insect]]s, the text itself reinforces the tremendous power of the new [[microscope]]. The plates of insects fold out to be larger than the large [[Book size|folio]] itself, the engraving of the [[louse]] in particular folding out to four times the size of the book. Although the book is best known for demonstrating the power of the microscope, ''Micrographia'' also describes distant [[planet|planetary bodies]], the [[wave theory of light]], the organic origin of [[fossil]]s, and other philosophical and scientific interests of its author.

Hooke also selected several objects of human origin; among these objects were the jagged edge of a honed razor and the point of a needle, seeming blunt under the microscope.  His goal may well have been as a way to contrast the flawed products of mankind with the perfection of nature (and hence, in the spirit of the times, of biblical creation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fara P |title=A microscopic reality tale |journal=Nature |volume=459 |issue=4 June 2009 |pages=642–644 |date=June 2009 |doi=10.1038/459642a |url= |pmid=19494897|bibcode = 2009Natur.459..642F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Published under the aegis of [[Royal Society|The Royal Society]], the popularity of the book helped further the society's image and mission of being the UK's leading scientific organization. ''Micrographia'''s illustrations of the miniature world captured the public's imagination in a radically new way; [[Samuel Pepys]] called it "the most ingenious book that ever I read in my life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pepys.info/1665/1665jan.html | title=Samuel Pepys Diary, 21 January 1665 | access-date=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

In 2007, [[Janice Neri]], a professor of art history and visual culture, studied Hooke's artistic influences and processes with the help of some newly rediscovered notes and drawings that appear to show some of his work leading up to ''Micrographia.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/feb/09/science.research |title=Eureka! Lost manuscript found in cupboard |last=Sample |first=Ian |date=8 February 2006 |website=https://www.theguardian.com |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She observes, "Hooke's use of the term "schema" to identify his plates indicates that he approached his images in a [[Diagram|diagrammatic]] manner and implies the study or visual [[dissection]] of the objects portrayed." Identifying Hooke's schema as 'organization tools,' she emphasizes:&lt;ref name="Neri"&gt;{{cite book |last=Neri |first=Janice |editor1-last=O'Malley |editor1-first=Therese |editor2-last=Meyers |editor2-first=Amy R.

{{quote|Hooke built up his images from numerous observations made from multiple vantage points, under varying lighting conditions, and with lenses of differing powers. Similarly his specimens required a great deal of manipulation and preparation in order to make them visible through the microscope.}}

Additionally: "Hooke often enclosed the objects he presented within a round frame, thus offering viewers an evocation of the experience of looking through the lens of a microscope."&lt;ref name="Neri"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ohio State University Radio Observatory''' was a  [[Kraus-type]] [[radio telescope]] located on the grounds of the [[Perkins Observatory]] at [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] from 1963 to 1998.  Known as '''Big Ear''', the observatory was part of The [[Ohio State University]]'s [[SETI|Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence]] (SETI) project. Construction of the Big Ear began in 1956 and was completed in 1961, and it was finally turned on for the first time in 1963.    

The main reflector of Big Ear {{mdash}} The Flat Reflector {{mdash}} measured approximately 103 metres by 33 metres, giving it the sensitivity equivalent to a circular dish measuring nearly 53 metres in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bigear.org/about.htm|title=Big Ear Radio Observatory|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

The observatory completed the [[Ohio Sky Survey]] in 1971, and from 1973–1995, Big Ear was used to search for extraterrestrial radio signals, making it the longest running SETI project in history.  In 1977, the Big Ear received the [[Wow! signal]].  The observatory was disassembled in 1998 when developers purchased the site from the university and used the land to expand a nearby [[Golf|golf course]].&lt;ref name="flat"/&gt;  

==Big Ear==
From 1965–1971, the Big Ear was used to map wideband radio sources for the [[Ohio Sky Survey]], its first sky survey for extraterrestrial radio sources.&lt;ref name="flat"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kelley |first=Susan |date=1998 |url=http://www.bigear.org/flatdown.htm |title=Last remains of Big Ear telescope removed |work=[[Delaware Gazette]] |publisher=Big Ear Radio Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972, the United States Congress voted to stop funding the Ohio Sky Survey with support from the [[National Science Foundation]] resulting in many people losing their jobs. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In 1977, the Big Ear recorded an unusual and apparently [[Extraterrestrial intelligence|extraterrestrial]] radio signal, which became known as the [[Wow! signal]]. The observation would prove to be unique, since no similar signals were ever detected afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kawa |first=Barry |date=1994-09-18 |url=http://www.bigear.org/wow.htm |title=The "Wow!"

The Big Ear was listed in the 1995 [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]] under the category of "Longest Extraterrestrial Search":
&lt;blockquote&gt;The longest-running full-scale SETI (search for extraterrestrial intelligence) project is the Ohio SETI Program at Ohio State University in Columbus, OH, which has searched the universe for extraterrestrial radio signals for 22 years, beginning in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2005 |url=http://www.bigear.org/guinness.htm |title=Big Ear Entered in Guinness Book of Records |publisher=Big Ear Radio Observatory and North American AstroPhysical Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''PGM-11 Redstone''' was the first large American [[ballistic missile]]. A [[short-range ballistic missile]] (SRBM), it was in active service with the [[United States Army]] in [[West Germany]] from June 1958 to June 1964 as part of [[NATO]]'s [[Cold War]] defense of Western Europe. It was the first missile to carry a live [[nuclear weapon|nuclear warhead]], in the 1958 Pacific Ocean weapons test, [[Hardtack Teak]].  Chief Engineer [[Wernher von Braun]] personally witnessed this historic launch and detonation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLbyY76zt9w&amp;t=8 REDSTONE ROCKET, HARDTACK-TEAK TEST, AUGUST 1958 (French narration)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Redstone was a direct descendant of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[V-2 rocket]], developed by a team of predominantly [[List of German rocket scientists in the United States|German rocket engineers]] brought to the United States after World War II as part of [[Operation Paperclip]]. The design used an upgraded engine from [[Rocketdyne]] that allowed the missile to carry the [[Mark 39 nuclear bomb|W39]] warhead which weighed {{convert|6900|lbs}} with its reentry vehicle to a range of about {{convert|175|miles}}. Redstone's prime contractor was the [[Chrysler]] Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allpar.com/history/military/missiles.html Redgap, Curtis ''The Chrysler Corporation Missile Division and the Redstone missiles'', 2008  Orlando, Florida. Retrieved Oct 8 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

A major effort to improve Redstone's reliability produced one of the most reliable rockets of the era. Dubbed "the Army's Workhorse", it spawned an [[Redstone (rocket family)|entire rocket family]] which had an excellent launch record and holds a number of firsts in the US space program, notably launching the first US astronaut. It was retired by the Army in 1964 and replaced by the [[solid-fuel rocket|solid-fueled]] [[MGM-31 Pershing]]. Surplus missiles were widely used for test missions and space launches, including the first US man in space, and in 1967 the launch of [[WRESAT|Australia's first satellite]].

==History==
[[Image:Redstone 04.jpg|left|thumb|US Army field group erecting Redstone missile]]

A product of the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] (ABMA) at [[Redstone Arsenal]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]] under the leadership of [[Wernher von Braun]], Redstone was designed as a surface-to-surface missile for the U.S. Army. It was named for the arsenal on 8 April 1952, which traced its name to the region's [[Iron(III) oxide|red]] [[Hematite|rocks]] and [[Geography of Alabama#Climate and soil|soil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Cagle | first = Mary T. | authorlink =  | title = The Origin of Redstone's Name | work =  | publisher = US Army, Redstone Arsenal | year = 1955 | url = http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/studies/ix.html | accessdate = 9 October 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20000519105836/http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/studies/ix.html | archivedate = 19 May 2000 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysler was awarded the prime production contract and began missile and support equipment production in 1952 at the newly renamed Michigan Ordnance Missile Plant in Warren, Michigan. The navy-owned facility was previously known as the Naval Industrial Reserve Aircraft Plant used for jet engine production.  Following the cancellation of a planned jet engine program, the facility was made available to the [[Chrysler Corporation]] for missile production. [[Rocketdyne]] Division of North American Aviation Company provided the rocket engines; Ford Instrument Company, division of [[Sperry Rand Corporation]], produced the guidance and control systems; and [[Reynolds Metals Company]] fabricated fuselage assemblies as subcontractors to Chrysler. The first Redstone lifted off from LC-4A at Cape Canaveral on 20 August 1953. It flew for one minute and 20 seconds before suffering an engine failure and falling into the sea. Following this partial success, the second test was conducted on 27 January 1954, this time without a hitch as the missile flew 55 miles. After these first two prototypes were flown, an improved engine was introduced to reduce problems with LOX turbopump cavitation.

The third Redstone flight on 5 May was a total loss as the engine cut off one second after launch, causing the rocket to fall back on the pad and explode. After this incident, Major General [[Holger Toftoy]] pressured Wernher von Braun for the cause of the failure. The latter replied that he had no idea, but they would review telemetry and other data to find out. Toftoy persisted, asking "Wernher, why did the rocket explode?" An exasperated von Braun said "It exploded because the damn sonofabitch blew up!"

Von Braun pressured the ABMA team to improve reliability and workmanship standards, allegedly remarking that "Missile reliability will require that the target area is more dangerous than the launch area." Subsequent test flights went better and the Army declared Redstone operational in mid-1955. Testing was moved from LC-4 to the bigger LC-5 and LC-6.

In 1955, the [[Jupiter-C]] rocket (not to be confused with the later, unrelated Jupiter IRBM) was developed as an enhanced Redstone for atmospheric and reentry vehicle tests. It had elongated propellant tanks for increased burn time and a new engine that burned a fuel mixture known as [[hydyne]] and under the name of the Jupiter C/Juno 1 was used for the first successful US space launch of the [[Explorer 1]] satellite in 1958.

The [[Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle]] was a derivation of the Redstone with a fuel tank increased in length by {{convert|6|ft|m}} and was used on 5 May 1961 to launch [[Alan Shepard]] on his sub-orbital flight to become the second person and first American in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turnill|1972|pp=81–82, 147–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It retained the Jupiter C's longer propellant tanks, but went back to using ethyl alcohol/water for propellant instead of hydyne.

The Redstone program proved to be a bone of contention between the Army and Air Force due to their different ideas of nuclear warfare. The Army favored using small warheads on mobile missiles as tactical battlefield weapons while the Air Force, which was responsible for the ICBM program, wanted large cross-continental missiles that could strike Soviet targets and rapidly cripple the USSR's infrastructure and ability to wage war.

With the arrival of newer solid-fueled missiles that could be stored and not require fueling before launch, Redstone was rendered obsolete and production ended in 1961. The 40th Artillery Group was deactivated in February 1964 and 46th Artillery Group was deactivated in June 1964, as Redstone missiles were replaced by the [[Pershing missile]] in the U.S. Army arsenal.  All Redstone missiles and equipment deployed to Europe were returned to the United States by the third quarter of 1964. In October 1964, the Redstone missile was ceremonially retired from active service at Redstone Arsenal.

From 1966 to 1967, a series of surplus modified Redstones called [[Sparta (rocket)|Spartas]] were launched from [[Woomera, South Australia]] as part of a joint U.S.–United Kingdom–Australian research program aimed at understanding re-entry phenomena.  These Redstones had two solid fuel upper stages added. The U.S. donated a spare Sparta for Australia's first satellite launch, [[WRESAT]], in November 1967.

==Description==
Redstone was capable of flights from {{convert|57.5|mi|km}} to {{convert|201|mi|km}}. It consisted of a thrust unit for powered flight and a missile body for overall missile control and payload delivery on target.  During powered flight, Redstone burned a fuel mixture of 25 percent water–75 percent [[ethyl alcohol]] with [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) used as the [[oxidizer]].  Later Redstones used Hydyne, 60% [[unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine]] (UDMH) and 40% [[diethylenetriamine]] (DETA), as the fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sutton |first=George P. |date=2006 |title=History of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines |url= |location=Reston, Virginia |publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |page=413 |isbn=1-56347-649-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCutcheon |first=Kimble D. |date= |title=The Redstone Engine |url=http://www.enginehistory.org/Museums/USSRC/USSRC_Redstone.shtml |location=Huntsville, Alabama |publisher=Aircraft Engine Historical Society |page= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hullard, |first=John W., |date=1965 |title=History of the Redstone Missile System |url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA434109 |location=Redstone Arsenal, Huntsville, Alabama |publisher=Army Missile Command |page=66 (60) |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The missile body consisted of an aft unit containing the instrument compartment, and the warhead unit containing the payload compartment and the [[radar altimeter]] fuze.  The missile body was separated from the thrust unit 20–30 seconds after the termination of powered flight, as determined by the preset range to target.  The body continued on a controlled [[ballistic trajectory]] to the target impact point.  The thrust unit continued on its own uncontrolled ballistic trajectory, impacting short of the designated target.

The nuclear-armed Redstone carried the [[Mark 39 nuclear bomb|W39]], either a MK 39Y1 Mod 1 or MK 39Y2 Mod 1, warhead with a yield of 3.8 megatons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hansen |first=Chuck |date=1995 |title=The Swords of Armageddon |url= |location=Sunnyvale, California |publisher=Chucklea Publications |page=Volume VII Pg 297 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hansen |first=Chuck |date=1995 |title=The Swords of Armageddon |url= |location=Sunnyvale, California |publisher=Chucklea Publications |page=Volume VII Pages 293–299 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hansen |first=Chuck |date=1995 |title=The Swords of Armageddon |url= |location=Sunnyvale, California |publisher=Chucklea Publications |page=Volume VII Pg 299 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Peter Siebold''' (born 1971) is a member of the [[Scaled Composites]] astronaut team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/php/multimedia/imagegallery/igviewer.php?imgid=1858&amp;gid=154 |accessdate=March 6, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524044812/http://www.space.com/php/multimedia/imagegallery/igviewer.php?imgid=1858&amp;gid=154 |title=X PRIZE: The Competition is Heating Up|archivedate=May 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is their Director of Flight Operations,&lt;ref name=Scaled-2014-11-01-300pm&gt;{{cite web |title=Press Release – 3:00pm, November 1, 2014 |publisher=[[Scaled Composites]] | url=http://www.scaled.com/images/uploads/news/Press_Release_20141101b.pdf |date=November 1, 2014 |accessdate=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the test pilots for [[SpaceShipOne]] and [[SpaceShipTwo]], the experimental [[spaceplane]]s developed by the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/spaceshipone__secretpilot_040618.html |accessdate=March 6, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115195337/http://space.com/missionlaunches/spaceshipone__secretpilot_040618.html|title=Big Secret: Who Will Fly SpaceShipOne?  |archivedate=November 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 8, 2004, Siebold piloted the second powered test flight of SpaceShipOne, [[SpaceShipOne flight 13P|flight 13P]], which reached a top speed of Mach 1.6 and an altitude of 32.0 kilometers. On October 31, 2014, Siebold and [[Michael Alsbury]] were piloting the SpaceShipTwo [[VSS Enterprise|VSS ''Enterprise'']] on [[VSS Enterprise crash|flight PF04]], when the craft came apart in mid-air and then crashed, killing Alsbury and injuring Siebold.

==Career==
Peter Siebold, a 1990 graduate of [[Davis Senior High School (California)|Davis Senior High School]] in [[Davis, California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2014/11/01/surviving-pilot-in-spaceshiptwo-crash-said-to-be-alert-and-talking/ |title=Surviving Pilot In SpaceShipTwo Crash Said To Be ‘Alert And Talking’ |journal=Sacramento CBS local |date=November 1, 2014 |accessdate=November 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; obtained his pilot's license at age 16.&lt;ref name=DailyMail-2014-10-31&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2816224/Virgin-Galactic-SpaceShipTwo-exploded-45-000ft-One-pilot-dead-critical-Richard-Branson-s-500m-space-tourism-plane-blows-testing-new-fuel-California-desert.html |title=Moment Virgin Galactic spaceship exploded at 45,000ft |journal=[[Daily Mail]] | first1=Mark |last1=Prigg |first2=Chris |last2=Spargo |first3=Lydia |last3=Warren |first4=Kieran |last4=Corcoran |date=October 31, 2014 |accessdate=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a design engineer at Scaled Composites since 1996. Siebold holds a degree in [[aerospace engineering]] from [[California Polytechnic State University|California Polytechnic University]] at San Luis Obispo, from 2001.&lt;ref name=DailyMail-2014-10-31 /&gt;

Siebold was responsible for the simulator, navigation system, and [[ground control system]] for the SpaceShipOne project at Scaled. Although he was one of four qualified pilots for SpaceShipOne, Siebold did not pilot the craft during the flights later in 2004 to meet the requirements of the [[Ansari X Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web1-xprize.primary.net/downloads/ScaledComposites.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=January 9, 2006|website=archive.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109005156/http://web1-xprize.primary.net/downloads/ScaledComposites.pdf|archivedate=January 9, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Siebold flew SpaceShipOne to an altitude of 32&amp;nbsp;km (just under 20 miles), he did not cross the 100&amp;nbsp;km [[Kármán line]]—the international standard for reaching space.

For his contribution to the SpaceShipOne project, Siebold, along with [[Mike Melvill]] and [[Brian Binnie]], received the 2004 [[Iven C. Kincheloe Award]] presented by the [[Society of Experimental Test Pilots]].

Siebold became the Director of Flight Operations at Scaled.&lt;ref name=Scaled-2014-11-01-300pm /&gt; He was the pilot who flew the [[White Knight Two]] on its maiden flight on December 21, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scaled.com/news/wk2_21_12_08.pdf |title=Scaled Composites: News – Mike Alsbury Memorial Fund |publisher=Scaled Composites}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the Iven C. Kincheloe Award a second time in 2009, this time individually, for his work on the first WhiteKnightTwo, [[VMS Eve|VMS ''Eve'']], as chief test pilot.&lt;ref name=DailyMail-2014-10-31 /&gt;

===SpaceShipTwo VSS Enterprise crash===
{{main|VSS Enterprise crash}}
On October 31, 2014, Siebold was one of the two pilots flying the [[Virgin Galactic]] [[SpaceShipTwo]], [[VSS Enterprise|VSS ''Enterprise'']], along with Michael Alsbury, on a test flight, which suffered an anomaly, resulting in the death of Michael Alsbury and loss of ''Enterprise''. VSS ''Enterprise'' crashed in the California [[Mojave Desert]]. Thrown clear of the ''Enterprise'' when it broke up in mid-air, Siebold survived a descent from about 50,000 feet at Mach 1 speed with just a flightsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-virgin-survivor-20141105-story.html#page=1 |last1=Vartebedian |first1=Ralph |last2=Petersen |first2=Melody |title=Virgin Galactic pilot defied the odds to survive crash |journal=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=November 5, 2014 |accessdate=November 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parachute deployed automatically at about 20,000 feet, and, after landing, he was taken to the hospital for treatment.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/space-flight-history/spaceflight-heritage-spaceshipone-government-zero-13-years-later/ |last1=Rhian |first1=Jason |title=IMAGE: SPACESHIPONE, GOVERNMENT ZERO |journal=[[Space Flight Insider]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered from eyesight degradation and eye pains. He was unable to keep his eyes open and he did not open his right eye until emergency personnel arrived.

Siebold's flight suit was saturated with blood from bleeding in his right arm. He did not feel any lower body injuries. As Siebold removed his parachute harness a “clunking noise” was felt in his chest and Siebold became concerned about a potential spinal fracture. Upon arrival at the ER his flight suit was cut away. 

Siebold experienced a non-compound four-part fracture of his right humerus. The ball of his ankle was also dislocated and fractured. He had a non-displaced fracture of his right clavicle, a small gash in his right elbow (source of the blood on his flight suit), a deep scrape on his right wrist, and multiple scrapes on the back of his right shoulder. There was considerable bruising on his right chest but he did not know how it occurred. He did not recall any bruising on his left side. He had an abrasion under his chin which he felt was consistent with the location of his chin strap, and had multiple contusions and scrapes on his face. He was diagnosed with corneal scratches and doctors removed a piece of fiberglass from his left eye during a hospital stay. The eyes did not improve so he saw an ophthalmologist after being discharged. The ophthalmologist removed some foreign matter from his left eyelid and a “silver sliver” from his right cornea. His eyes improved immediately post procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parabolicarc.com/2015/07/29/detailed-account-pete-siebolds-survival-spaceshiptwo-crash/|title=A Detailed Account of Pete Siebold’s Survival in the SpaceShipTwo Crash – Parabolic Arc|author=|date=|website=www.parabolicarc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{broader|Science communication}}
'''Popular science''' (also called '''pop-science''' or '''popsci''') is an interpretation of [[science]] intended for a general audience. While [[science journalism]] focuses on recent scientific developments, popular science is more broad-ranging. It may be written by professional science journalists or by scientists themselves. It is presented in many forms, including books, film and television documentaries, magazine articles, and web pages.

== Role ==
Popular science is a bridge between [[scientific literature]] as a professional medium of scientific research, and the realms of popular political and cultural discourse. The goal of the genre is often to capture the methods and accuracy of science, while making the language more accessible. Many science-related controversies are discussed in popular science books and publications, such as the long-running debates over [[biological determinism]] and the biological components of intelligence, stirred by popular books such as ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' and ''[[The Bell Curve]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Murdz William McRae, "Introduction: Science in Culture" in ''The Literature of Science'', pp. 1–3, 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of scientific literature is to inform and persuade peers as to the validity of observations and conclusions and the [[forensic]] efficacy of methods. Popular science attempts to inform and convince scientific outsiders (sometimes along with scientists in other fields) of the significance of data and conclusions and to celebrate the results. Statements in scientific literature are often qualified and tentative, emphasizing that new observations and results are consistent with and similar to established knowledge wherein qualified scientists are assumed to recognize the relevance. By contrast, popular science emphasizes uniqueness and generality, taking a tone of factual authority absent from the scientific literature. Comparisons between original scientific reports, derivative science journalism and popular science typically reveal at least some level of distortion and oversimplification which can often be quite dramatic, even with politically neutral scientific topics.&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne Fahnestock, "Accommodating Science: The Rhetorical Life of Scientific Facts" in ''The Literature of Science'', pp. 17–36&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular science literature can be written by non-scientists who may have a limited understanding of the subject they are interpreting and it can be difficult for non-experts to identify misleading popular science, which may also blur the boundaries between real science and [[pseudoscience]]. However, sometimes non-scientists with a fair scientific background make better popular science writers because of their ability to put themselves in the layperson's place more easily.

== Common threads ==
Some usual features of popular science productions include:
* Entertainment value or personal relevance to the audience
* Emphasis on uniqueness and radicalness
* Exploring ideas overlooked by specialists or falling outside of established disciplines
* Generalized, simplified science concepts
* Presented for an audience with little or no science background, hence explaining general concepts more thoroughly
* Synthesis of new ideas that cross multiple fields and offer new applications in other academic specialties
* Use of metaphors and analogies to explain difficult or abstract scientific concepts

[[File:West Bank Access Restrictions.pdf|thumb|250px|Map of Israeli settlements (magenta) in the [[West Bank]] in 2014]]
The '''population statistics for Israeli settlements in the West Bank''' are collected by the [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]]. As such, the data contains only population of settlements recognized by the Israeli authorities. [[Israeli outpost]]s are not tracked, and their population is hard to establish. In addition to these, [[Nahal settlement]]s are formally considered military outposts, and their population is counted, but not reported. Once a Nahal settlement becomes a civilian locality, it starts to be reported.

While all settlements in the West Bank were advised by the [[International Court of Justice]] to be [[International law and Israeli settlements|unlawful]] in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;See the advisory opinion in ''[[Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory]]'' [2004] [http://www.worldlii.org/int/cases/ICJ/2004/3.html ICJ 3]&lt;/ref&gt; the construction of the [[West Bank Barrier]] keeps a significant number of settlements behind it. The largest settlements left beyond the barrier includes [[Kiryat Arba]] (population 7,593 in 2012), [[Kokhav Ya'akov]] (6,476), [[Beit El]] (5,897), [[Geva Binyamin]] (4,674), [[Eli, Mateh Binyamin]] (3,521), [[Ofra]] (3,489), [[Talmon]] (3,202), [[Shilo, Mateh Binyamin]] (2,706), [[Tekoa, Gush Etzion]] (2,518), and [[Mitzpe Yeriho]] (2,115). The total number of settlers east of the barrier lines in 2012 was at least 67,702, plus 11,528 in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]]. By comparison, the number of [[Gaza Strip]] settlers in 2005 who refused to move voluntarily and be compensated, and that were forcibly evicted during the [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza]] was around 9,000.&lt;ref&gt;For prior statistics, see [[Population statistics for Israeli Gaza Strip settlements]].&lt;/ref&gt; The total population of all settlements in the West Bank was nearly 400,000 in 2014, excluding [[East Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.breakingisraelnews.com/26966/jewish-population-in-judea-and-samaria-growing-significantly/#ddFGqPD1D4W2vaaT.97&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2015, altogether over 800,000 Israeli Jews resided over the 1949 Armistice Lines (including east-Jerusalem neighborhoods), constituting approximately 13% of Israel's Jewish population.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/18210#.VpK885scTIU&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Russian and Eurasian Security Network (RES)''' was an open-source service that encouraged the exchange of information among [[international relations]] and security professionals worldwide. It maintained a large digital library of documents related to Russia and Eurasia and provided the framework for studies of security-related developments in Russia and the states of the Eurasian region ([[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Moldova]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]).

It was based at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] and was part of the [[International Relations and Security Network]] (ISN) and the [[Center for Security Studies (CSS)]]. The RES website was closed down in August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;ISN website,[http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Communities-and-Partners/Partner-Network/Detail/?lng=en&amp;id=44522 Communities and Partners]&lt;/ref&gt;

The two RES in-house publications were migrated to the website of the Center for Security Studies:  

*The '''Russian Analytical Digest''', an electronic journal covering political, economic and social developments in Russia and its regions. 
*The '''Caucasus Analytical Digest (CAD)''', a monthly internet publication analyzing the political, economic, and social situation in the three South Caucasus states of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia within the context of international and security dimensions of this region’s development.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6775">The '''Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia''' ('''SADS''')&lt;ref group=note&gt;The SADS is not available via the major psychological test companies, but must be obtained directly from one of its coauthors, Jean Endicott, PhD, Professor of Clinical Psychology (in Psychiatry) at Columbia University Medical Center via email (je10 [at] columbia [dot] edu) or fax (212-543-5386). Keep in mind that the SADS does not map as precisely onto current nosology, i.e., DSM-5, compared to diagnostic structured interviews such as the [[Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV]].&lt;/ref&gt;  is a collection of psychiatric diagnostic criteria and symptom rating scales originally published in 1978.&lt;ref name= Endicott&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Endicott | first1 = J | last2 = Spitzer | first2 = RL | year = 1978 | title = A diagnostic interview: the schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia | url = http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/35/7/837 | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 35 | issue = 7| pages = 837–43 | pmid = 678037 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.1978.01770310043002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is organized as a semi-structured diagnostic interview. The structured aspect is that every interview asks screening questions about the same set of disorders regardless of the presenting problem; and positive screens get explored with a consistent set of symptoms. These features increase the sensitivity of the interview and the inter-rater reliability (or reproducibility) of the resulting diagnoses. The SADS also allows more flexibility than fully structured interviews: Interviewers can use their own words and rephrase questions, and some clinical judgment is used to score responses. There are three versions of the schedule, the regular SADS, the lifetime version (SADS-L) and a version for measuring the change in symptomology (SADS-C). Although largely replaced by more structured interviews that follow diagnostic criteria such as [[DSM-IV]] and DSM-5, and specific mood rating scales, versions of the SADS are still used in some research papers today.

==Diagnoses covered==
The diagnoses covered by the interview include [[schizophrenia]], [[schizoaffective disorder]], [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[anxiety disorders]] and a limited number of other fairly common diagnoses.&lt;ref name=Endicott/&gt;

==Relationship with the Research Diagnostic Criteria==
The SADS was developed by the same group of rearchers as the [[Research Diagnostic Criteria]] (RDC). While the RDC is a list of diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorders, the SADS interview allows diagnoses based on RDC criteria to be made, and also rates subject's symptoms and level of functioning.&lt;ref name=Endicott/&gt;

==K-SADS==
The '''[[Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia|K-SADS]]''' (or '''Kiddie-SADS''') is a version of the SADS adapted for [[school-age]]d children of 6–18 years. There are various different versions of the K-SADS, each varying slightly in terms of disorders and specific symptoms covered, as well as the scale range used. All of the variations are still semi-structured interviews, giving the interviewer more flexibility about how to phrase and probe items, while still covering a consistent set of disorders.

The K-SADS-E (Epidemiological version) was developed for epidemiological research. It focused on current issues and episodes only. Most of the items used a four point rating scale.

The [http://www.psychiatry.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/Documents/assessments/ksads-pl.pdf K-SADS-PL] (Present and Lifetime version) is administered by interviewing the parent(s), the child, and integrating them into a summary rating that includes parent report, child report, and clinical observations during the interview. The interview covers both present issues (i.e., the reason the family is seeking an evaluation) as well as past episodes of the disorders. Most items use a three point rating scale for severity (not present, subthreshold, and threshold—which combines both moderate and severe presentations). It has been used with preschool&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Birmaher|first=Boris|last2=Ehmann|first2=Mary|last3=Axelson|first3=David A.|last4=Goldstein|first4=Benjamin I.|last5=Monk|first5=Kelly|last6=Kalas|first6=Catherine|last7=Kupfer|first7=David|last8=Gill|first8=Mary Kay|last9=Leibenluft|first9=Ellen|date=2009-04-01|title=Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS-PL) for the Assessment of Preschool Children- A Preliminary Psychometric Study|journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research|volume=43|issue=7|pages=680–686|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2008.10.003|issn=0022-3956|pmc=2736874|pmid=19000625}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as school-aged children. A [http://www.psychiatry.pitt.edu/node/8234 2009 working draft] removed all reference to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-III-R]] criteria (which were replaced with the publication of the DSM-IV in 1994) and made some other modifications. A DSM-5 version is being prepared and validated.

The WASH-U K-SADS (Washington University version) added items to the depression and mania modules and used a six point severity rating for severity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geller|first=B.|last2=Zimerman|first2=B.|last3=Williams|first3=M.|last4=Bolhofner|first4=K.|last5=Craney|first5=J.

A '''Smith's fracture''', also sometimes known as a '''reverse [[Colles' fracture]]''' or '''Goyrand-Smith's''', is a fracture of the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] [[radius (bone)|radius]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Clayton L., M.D., M.P.H. (1993). Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary, Edition 18. F.A. Davis. {{ISBN|0-8036-0194-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is caused by a direct blow to the dorsal forearm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = First Aid: Emergency Medicine |author1=Stead, LG |author2=Stead, SM |author3=Kaufman, MS | publisher = McGraw-Hill | edition = 2nd | isbn = 0-07-144873-X | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; or falling onto flexed wrists, as opposed to a Colles' fracture which occurs as a result of falling onto wrists in extension. Smith's fractures are less common than Colles' fractures.

The distal fracture fragment is displaced volarly ([[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|ventrally]]), as opposed to a Colles' fracture which the fragment is displaced dorsally. Depending on the severity of the impact, there may be one or many fragments and it may or may not involve the articular surface of the [[wrist joint]].

==Eponym==
This fracture is named after the [[orthopedic surgeon]], [[Robert William Smith (surgeon)|Robert William Smith]] (1807–1873) in his book ''A Treatise on Fractures in the Vicinity of Joints, and on certain forms of Accidents and Congenital Dislocations'' published in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatment of this fracture depends on the severity of the fracture. An undisplaced fracture may be treated with a cast alone. A fracture with mild angulation and displacement may require [[Reduction (orthopedic surgery)|closed reduction]] (putting into place without surgery). Significant angulation and deformity may require an open reduction and internal fixation. An open fracture will always require surgical intervention.

Of the 270 Apollo 11 Moon Rocks and Apollo 17 [[Goodwill Moon Rock]]s that were given to the nations of the world by the Nixon Administration, approximately 180 are unaccounted for. Many of the Moon rocks that are accounted for have been locked away in storage for decades. The location of the rocks has been tracked by researchers and hobbyists because of their rarity and the difficulty of obtaining more. [[Moon rocks]] have been subjects of theft and forgery as well.

==Investigations==
In 1998, a unique federal law enforcement undercover operation was created to identify and arrest individuals selling bogus Moon rocks. This [[sting operation]] was known as Operation Lunar Eclipse. Originally two undercover agents were involved in this sting, Senior Special Agent [[Joseph Gutheinz]] of [[NASA Office of Inspector General|NASA's Office of Inspector General]] (NASA OIG), posing as Tony Coriasso, and Inspector Bob Cregger of the [[United States Postal Inspection Service]], posing as John Marta. This sting operation was later expanded to include Agents from the [[United States Customs Service]], namely, Special Agent Dwight Weikel and Special Agent Dave Atwood. Agents posted a quarter page advertisement in ''[[USA Today]]'' asking for Moon rocks. The Agents were targeting individuals selling bogus Moon rocks, which con artists sell to the elderly and to space enthusiasts. The sting operation was led by NASA OIG Senior Special Agent Joseph Gutheinz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hennessy-Fiske |first=Molly |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-moon-rock-20120208,0,4633684,full.story |title=Finding Lost Moon Rocks is His Mission |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=February 7, 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time in history the sting operation recovered an Apollo era Moon rock, the Honduras Goodwill Moon Rock. This Moon rock had been given to Honduras by President Nixon, fallen into private hands, and then offered to the Agents for $5 million. In order to recover this Moon rock, the agents had to come up with the $5 million requested by the seller. Billionaire and one-time Presidential Candidate [[H. Ross Perot]] was asked by one of the agents to put up the money, and did so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kloc |first=Joe |url=http://atavist.net/the-case-of-the-missing-moon-rocks/ |title=The Case of the Missing Moon Rocks |publisher=The Atavist |date=February 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving NASA for a teaching position at the [[University of Phoenix]], in Arizona, Gutheinz challenged his [[criminal justice]] graduate students to locate the goodwill Moon rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gutheinz|first=Joseph Richard|title=In Search of the Goodwill Moon Rocks: A Personal Account|url=http://www.geotimes.org/nov04/trends.html|accessdate=November 14, 2012|newspaper=Geotimes Magazine|date=November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fernandez |first=Manny |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/science/space/nasa-tackles-problem-of-missing-moon-rocks.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all |title=NASA Searches for Loot That Traveled from Space to Another Void |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 21, 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dasgupta |first=Debarshi |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?280382 |title=A Few Lunaroids: One man’s quest for pieces of the moon gifted by US to govts across the world |publisher=Outlookindia.com |date=April 9, 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He subsequently extended this project to also cover the missing Apollo 11 Moon rocks President Nixon gave to the states and nations of the world in 1969. Hundreds of graduate students have participated in this project from 2002 to the present and while many Moon rocks have been found, others are now known to be missing, stolen, or destroyed. Gutheinz patterned this college project after NASA's earlier Operation Lunar Eclipse, which he had participated in. Beginning in 2002, his graduate students began reporting to him that both the [[Cyprus]] [[Apollo 11]] Moon rock (which is actually a collection of lunar dust in a Lucite ball) and Cyprus Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rock (a pebble-size Moon rock) were missing. Operation Lunar Eclipse and the Moon Rock Project were the subject of the book ''[[The Case of the Missing Moon Rocks]]'' by Joe Kloc.

He advised that only an amateur thief would have taken the Maltese Goodwill Moon Rock and left the plaque and flag behind, as all three together would have been self-authenticating and eliminated the risk of a geologist needing to authenticate the Moon rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grech|first=Herman|title=Ex-NASA officer urges Malta amnesty to repossess moon rocks|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20040523/local/ex-nasa-officer-urges-malta-amnesty-to-repossess-moon-rock.122314|accessdate=November 14, 2012|newspaper=The Sunday Times (Malta)|date=May 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Micallef|first=Keith|title=Malta's Moon Rock Not Among the 79 Recovered|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/news.asp?newsitemid=144384|accessdate=November 14, 2012|newspaper=Malta Independent|date=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====
{{Main article|Spain lunar sample displays}}
Evidence surfaced that both Spain’s Apollo 11 Moon Rock and Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rock which were given to General [[Francisco Franco]]’s Administration by the Nixon Administration were missing. Pablo Jáuregui, the Science Editor of ''El Mundo'', a Spanish newspaper, disclosed in a July 20, 2009 story entitled: "Franco's grandson:  My mother lost Moon stone given her by Grandfather" that the Spanish Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rock had finally been given back to the people of Spain in 2007 by the family of Admiral [[Luis Carrero Blanco|Luis Carrero]]; and Jáuregui suggested that Spain’s Apollo 11 Moon Rock, as referenced in the title of the story, was last known to be in the Franco’s families hands, and is now unaccounted for. Jáuregui wrote, as translated: "As for the stone that Kissinger gave Carrero Blanco, confirmed yesterday" by "the son of …Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco"… "the stone was in possession of the family (first in the home of his widow, and after that of his eldest son ), until in 2007 they decided to donate it to the Naval Museum, where it is"…on display…. "today, along with a Spanish flag which traveled aboard the Apollo 17 mission to the moon. " My son told me that the gift was dedicated to 'Spanish people', so it seemed right to donate it," recalls Luis Carrero Blanco." Blanco was assassinated while in Office by [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], a [[Basque nationalism#Political violence and devolved autonomy|Basque separatist]] organization recognized as terrorist by Spain, France,&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [https://pastel.diplomatie.gouv.fr/editorial/actual/ael2/bulletin.asp?liste=20040601.html#Chapitre14 French list of terrorist organizations, in the annex of Chapter&amp;nbsp;XIV]&lt;/ref&gt; the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/counter-terrorism/proscribed-terror-groups/proscribed-groups?view=Binary|title=Proscribed terrorist groups|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the US,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs)].

As for Spain’s Apollo 11 Moon Rock the trail is more confused. Jáuregui relates the following from Franco’s grandson: "The grandson of Franco stressed that neither he nor any other member of his family" had been told "that there might be some legal or ethical problem" regarding "the Moonstone. If you get anything and it's yours, why not going (translation) to sell?" He said. "In any case the rock never sold, but according to Franco, now" he does "not know where it is. As my mother is a woman with many things in many houses, in a move or redecorate a room, in the end had to go astray," he explains.&lt;ref name = "motherlost"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/07/20/ciencia/1248121248.html |title=Franco’s grandson: My mother lost the moonstone that was given to her by grandfather |date=July 20, 2009 |first1=Pablo |last1=Jáuregui |work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|location=Madrid |accessdate=November 5, 2012|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jauregui"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/07/20/ciencia/1248121248.html |title=El hijo de Carrero Blanco donó otra roca al Museo Naval |work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |first1=Pablo |last1=Jáuregui |date=July 20, 2009|location=Madrid |accessdate=November 5, 2012|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jauregui2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/07/19/ciencia/1248023409.html |title=El misterio de la roca lunar que EEUU regaló a España |work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |first1=Pablo |last1=Jáuregui |date=July 20, 2009|location=Madrid |accessdate=November 2, 2012|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students assigned to the Moon Rock Project are currently{{when|date=March 2013}} looking for leads to Spain’s Apollo 11 Moon Rock in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://muzi.com/cc/english/10314,19931.shtml?q=10093341 |title=Apollo moon rocks lost in space?

In 1973, there was a massive fire at the Alaska Transportation Museum where the Moon rocks were being housed. Coleman Anderson (a crab-fishing captain who was on the TV show ''Deadliest Catch'') claimed to have gone to the museum to scrounge through the garbage from the fire to see if there would be anything worth saving. Anderson, who was a child at the time, claimed to have found the Moon rocks and cleaned them up over the next few years.

To clear title to the rocks he filed a lawsuit against the State of Alaska, asking the Court to deem the rocks his sole property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18058827/Complaint.pdf] The Official Complaint&lt;/ref&gt;

The missing Moon rocks were returned by Anderson as of December 7, 2012.&lt;ref name=Pearlman2012&gt;{{Cite web

In a front-page story, the ''[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]'' listed numerous sources suggesting the Arkansas Goodwill Moon Rock had gone missing noting that the rock was potentially worth five million dollars. The rock was presented to the state by astronaut [[Richard H. Truly]] in 1976 at a Boy Scout event in Little Rock. Its whereabouts remained unknown until September 21, 2011, when it was discovered by Michael Hodge, an archivist with the [[Butler Center for Arkansas Studies]], while processing the gubernatorial papers of [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Breaking: Moon Rock Found!|url=http://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2011/09/21/breaking-moon-rock-found/|newspaper=Arkansas Times|date=September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2010/dec/31/hunt-high-low-moon-rock-state-got-apollo--20101231/ "Hunt is on high, low, for moon rock state got from Apollo 17 "] ''[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]'', Sarah Wire, December 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Toni Dowdell, a graduate student at the University of Phoenix, was assigned the task of hunting down the [[Oregon]] Apollo 11 Moon Rock while two of her teammates were charged with hunting down the Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rocks of Oregon and Louisiana. Toni Dowdell and her two teammates received this assignment from her professor, a retired Senior Special Agent with NASA's Office of Inspector General. This assignment was part of an ongoing assignment known as the Moon Rock Project, where students are assigned the task of hunting down Moon rocks all over America and the world. In a February 19, 2010 article Toni Dowdell wrote for the ''Daily News'' of [[Greenville, Michigan]], Dowdell described how her teammates in this investigation discerned that both the Apollo 17 Goodwill Moon Rocks of Oregon and of Louisiana remain unaccounted for, but how she successfully tracked down her assigned Moon rock, the Oregon Apollo 11 Moon Rock. As with many Moon rock gifts the Nixon Administration gave to the states and the nations of the world the first problem she encountered was a lack of a document trail. However, by reaching out to people, to include an operator in the state Capitol, she found the Moon rock hidden in the ceremonial Governor’s Office of Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailynews.cc/Main.asp?SectionID=2&amp;SubSectionID=11&amp;ArticleID=32846 Search for the "missing" Apollo 11 moon rocks  ""] The Daily News, Toni Dowdell, February 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; According to moon rocks researcher [[Robert Pearlman]], the Oregon Apollo 17 rock display is on permanent exhibit in the Earth Science Hall of the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectspace.com/resources/moonrocks_goodwill.html |title=Where today are the Apollo 17 goodwill lunar sample displays|publisher=collectspace.com |first1=Robert |last1=Pearlman|date=1999–2012 |accessdate=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
{{Main article|Canada lunar sample displays}}
In 1972, then 13-year-old Jaymie Matthews, now Astronomy Professor at the [[University of British Columbia]],  lied about his age in order to compete in an essay contest, the winner of which would serve as a participant in a "10-day International Youth Science Tour, in which all the countries in the United Nations were invited to offer up "youth ambassadors" aged 17 to 21. These youth ambassadors were to witness first-hand the launch in Florida..." of Apollo 17…" Eighty countries accepted the invitation, including Canada. Matthews won the contest, and when his true age came out, Canadian officials decided to let him go anyway. As the student ambassador, it was decided that Canada's Goodwill Moon Rock was mailed to him where he kept it at his home.  Eventually he was asked to turn the Moon rock over to Canada, which he did. The rock was reportedly stolen in 1978, while on tour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vancouversun.com/travel/astronomy+professor+kept+moon+rock+several+months/1801808/story.html "UBC astronomy professor kept moon rock for several months"] ''Vancouver Sun'', Pete McMartin, July 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, University of Phoenix graduate students tracked down the rock to a storage facility at the [[Canadian Museum of Nature]]. After 30 years of sitting in storage, the Canadian Goodwill Moon Rock finally went on display at the [[Canada Science and Technology Museum]] in [[Ottawa, Canada|Ottawa]], on July 23, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/travel/Canada+goodwill+moon+rock+going+back+display/1813881/story.html "Canada's 'goodwill moon rock' going back on display "] ''Ottawa Citizen'', Cassandra Drudi, July 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cyprus====
{{Main article|Cyprus lunar sample displays}}
Moon rocks from Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 presented to the island nation of Cyprus were believed to have been destroyed or stolen in 1974 during the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish invasion]]. In September 2009, while cooperating with a worldwide hunt for Moon rocks with [[Associated Press]] reporter Toby Sterling (Netherlands Bureau) and ''[[Cyprus Mail]]'' reporter [[Lucy Millett]], the daughter of the British Ambassador to Cyprus, Gutheinz was advised by his friend and space memorabilia expert Robert Pearlman (CollectSpace.com) that Pearlman had learned in 2003 that the Cyprus Goodwill Moon Rock was never presented to Cyprus, but retained by the son of an American diplomat. The American government was advised about this situation in 2003 and did nothing. Upon learning the truth Gutheinz reached out to both the American Embassy in Cyprus and the Cyprus Government to convey the facts; he then filed a request for a Congressional Inquiry into the case of the missing Cyprus Goodwill Moon Rock. Subsequently, he caused the facts about the Moon rock to be published in the press in order to motivate the person who had the Moon rock to do the right thing, and return it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyprus-mail.com/cyprus/moon-rocks-went-missing-around-world-0 Moon rocks went missing around the world].

During "Lunar Eclipse", Florida businessman Alan H. Rosen, attempted to sell agents the 1.142&amp;nbsp;gram Goodwill Moon rock presented to [[Honduras]] for 5 million dollars. After two months of negotiations with Rosen, the Moon rock was seized from a [[Bank of America]] vault. The rock immediately became the subject of a 5-year civil suit, ''United States of America v. One [[Lucite]] Ball containing Lunar Material (one Moon Rock) and One Ten Inch by Fourteen Inch Wooden Plaque'', which resulted in the forfeiture of the rock to the Federal Government on March 24, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703957904575252870014487364 "Honduran Official Led in Soccer War."] [[Wall Street Journal]], Stephen Miller, May 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The rock was refurbished at Johnson Space Center, to be once again presented to the people of Honduras.

===Texas===
On April 23, 2012 at a restaurant in Buffalo, Texas, "Moon Rock Hunter" [[Joseph Gutheinz|Joe Gutheinz]] met with a 67-year-old former toy manufacturer named Rafael Navarro, who claimed to have an Apollo 11 Moon rock given to him by "a maid, now elderly and in failing health, who worked for a Venezuelan diplomat who told people it was a Moon rock". Navarro was offering shavings from the rock for $300,000 on [[eBay]]. After looking at the sample through a microscope and later examining documents given him by Navarro, Gutheinz is skeptical of Navarro's claim, stating "...this is a train wreck waiting to happen for him, and he's inviting it.

In an October 23, 1999 story entitled "Atlanta Man Admits Trying to Sell Bogus Moon Rock", [[Reuters]] reported two brothers, Ronald and Brian Trochelmann, who were previously charged in 1998 in "U.S. District Court in Manhattan…"for…"a scheme to sell a phony moon rock for millions of dollars,"  both plead guilty to wire fraud, a felony, for perpetrating that scheme. "The brothers claimed that their father had invented a space-food packaging process that was used by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration during the Apollo moon missions of the 1960s. The Trochelmann’s alleged that the rock had been brought from the moon by Apollo 12 astronaut [[Alan Bean]] and given to [[John Glenn]]. They claimed Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth and later a U.S. senator, had given the rock to their father in recognition of his supposed invention." …" The brothers had negotiated a consignment agreement with [[Phillips Son &amp; Neale]], a Manhattan auction house, to sell the rock in December 1995. However, before the auction took place, the rock was confiscated by FBI agents in December 1995 prior to the scheduled auction."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/business/moonrock_bogus_991025_wg.html  " Atlanta Man Admits Trying to Sell Bogus Moon Rock "] [[Reuters]], Published in [[Space.com]], October 23, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; This story first broke in a ''New York Times'' Article written by [[Lawrence Van Gelder]] on December 2, 1995. At that time NASA expressed the belief that the Moon rock might have been real as it matched the general description of a Moon rock that was stolen in 1970. "Eileen Hawley, a spokeswoman for NASA, said of the sample offered through Phillips &amp; Neale: We have a rock that is classified as lost, an Apollo 12 lunar sample of approximately the same weight. With that information, we need to look at this—that this might be a true lunar sample. Ms. Hawley said a rock sample collected during the Apollo 12 mission had been part of a shipment of registered and certified mail that was stolen while en route to a researcher at the University of California in Los Angeles in 1970. The space agency received a call on Thursday from the Postal Investigative Service in New York, she said, after articles about the impending auction had been published. The service passed along a tip from the retired inspector, who was not identified, about a possible connection between the theft and the rock to be auctioned."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/02/nyregion/fbi-revisits-earthly-theft-of-moon-rock.html "FBI Revisits Early Theft of Moon Rock" [[New York Times]], December 2, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  This scheme and schemes like it were the inspiration for the undercover sting operation known as Operation Lunar Eclipse, which resulted in the acquisition of the Honduras Goodwill Moon Rock in December 1998.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geotimes.org/nov04/trends.html "In Search of the Goodwill Moon Rocks: A Personal Account" ''Geotimes Magazine'', Joseph Gutheinz, November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alvinsun.net/articles/2009/11/08/news/doc4af1a52ed11fb946825653.txt " Hunting Moon Rocks"] ''Alvin Sun Advertise'', Judy Zavalla, November 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Door-to-door salesman===
In his November 4, 1969 article appearing in the ''Fort Scott Tribune'' entitled "Fake Lunar Rock Racket Feared" NEA Staff correspondent Tom Tiede first predicted a market for fake Moon rocks, a market subsequently given extra momentum as Moon rocks began to be reported lost and stolen. Tiede gave a few examples to support his prediction: "In [[Miami]] Florida a housewife had been approached by a door to door salesman dealing in lunar rocks. She bought five dollars worth;" "In [[Redwood City]], Calif., a woman [published an advertisement] announcing moon dust for sale. At $1.98 an ounce;" "In New York, the Harlem Better Business Bureau [was] cautioning consumers against purchasing any kind of obviously fake moon substances."&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LtMfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EtkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=866,3786882&amp;dq=moon-rock+lost+mail&amp;hl=en  "Fake Lunar Rock Racket Feared"] ''Fort Scott Tribune'', Tom Tiede, November 4, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his August 28, 2009 Associated Press story appearing in the ''[[Brisbane Times]]'', Toby Sterling recounted how a spokesman for the Dutch National Museum, Amsterdam's [[Rijksmuseum]], acknowledged on August 26, 2009, "that one of its prized possessions, a rock supposedly brought back from the moon by"…Apollo 11… "US astronauts, is just a piece of petrified wood.."… "The museum acquired the rock after the death of former prime minister [[Willem Drees]] in 1988. Drees received it as a private gift on October 9, 1969 from then-US ambassador [[J.

===Theft of NASA rocks===
In June 2002, 101&amp;nbsp;grams of Moon rocks were stolen from the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]] by interns [[Thad Roberts]] and Tiffany Fowler.  The pair used knowledge of the security around the rocks gained during their internship to remove a {{nowrap|272 kg}} {{nowrap|(600 lb)}} safe in building 31 North containing the samples.&lt;ref name="orlando1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0803/nasa_interns.asp|title=Judge spares NASA interns from prison time|date = 2003-08-06 | publisher = Jewish World Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts is a certified pilot and scuba diver who was an ambitious student pursuing degrees in physics, geology, and anthropology who aspired to be an astronaut.&lt;ref name="sltrib"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SLTB&amp;p_theme=sltb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=100EF601C96079F2&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Aspiring Astronaut Counts Down On Grueling Bike Trip for Charity|last=Wagner|first=N |date=August 8, 1999 |publisher=Salt Lake Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fellow interns Shae Saur and Tiffany Fowler, as well as accomplice Gordon McWhorter were also arrested for their roles in the theft and attempted sale of the rocks.&lt;ref name=orlando&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2002-07-29/news/0207290209_1_moon-nasa-interns-rockhound|title=Rockhound helped FBI get stolen moon rocks|date=2002-07-31|publisher=Orlando Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theft also included a meteorite that may have revealed information about life on Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldstein |first=Michael |url=http://www.latimes.com/features/printedition/magazine/la-tm-moonrocks23jun06,1,1392690.story?coll=la-home-magazine&amp;ctrack=1&amp;cset=true |title=Sheer Lunacy - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimes.com |date=2004-06-06 |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts advertised the rocks on a Belgian mineralogy club website which was forwarded to the FBI who, with the help of Belgian amateur rock collector Axel Emmermann, set up a sting. On July 20, 2002, the 33rd anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing, a number of FBI agents posed as diners at a chain Italian restaurant on Orlando's International Drive for a pre-arranged meeting with Roberts.&lt;ref name=FBI&gt;{{cite web|title=The Case of the Stolen Moon Rocks|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2003/november/apollo_111803|publisher=FBI}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roberts met and spoke with one of the Special Agents at length.  A second Agent--posing as the husband of the first--joined the two, and then two of the three accomplices joined them.  The meeting moved to a nearby hotel where dozens of FBI agents arrested Roberts, McWhorter, and Fowler and recovered the missing lunar samples.&lt;ref name=orlando/&gt;  Roberts was also charged with stealing dinosaur bones and other fossils from his school, the [[University of Utah]].&lt;ref name="Financial Times Ltd.

The theft was the subject of Ben Mezrich's book ''[[Sex on the Moon|Sex on the Moon: The Amazing Story Behind the Most Audacious Heist in History]]''. Axel Emmermann, Gordon McWhorter, NASA Principal Investigator Dr. Everett Gibson and investigating officers of the FBI and NASA Office of the Inspector General were interviewed on camera for a [[National Geographic (U.S. TV channel)|National Geographic Channels]] ''[[National Geographic Explorer|Explorer]]'' special called "Million Dollar Moon Rock Heist", first broadcast in the US on March 4, 2012. Testimony given therein is at odds with some of the key claims made in Mezrich's account.

===National Air and Space Museum===
In an Aviation and Space Technology article published on September 27, 1976 entitled "Lunar Sample Damaged by Vandals" the author addresses a vandalism and possible theft attempt against a 40&amp;nbsp;gram Apollo 17 Moon rock. The author states that the "[[Apollo 17]] lunar sample on open display at the [[Smithsonian]] Institution's [[National Air and Space Museum]] was slightly damaged…during an apparent vandalism attempt. It is possible that theft was the object of the attack on the sample, but both museum and [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] officials believe vandalism was the primary objective. About two cubic millimeters of the triangular fine-grained basalt were chipped away during the incident that involved a hard blow to the sample with a sharp object.  NASA believes no part of the sample was obtained by the vandal. The area around the sample's display case was swept immediately after the incident, and the sweeper bag is now at the [[Johnson Space Center]], where it is being sifted in an attempt to obtain the missing material."

The author stated that "The 40-gram sample on display is the first touchable moon rock. Museum visitors are able to feel directly the texture of the lunar material, a departure from strict NASA policy that dictates that no individual ever handle lunar samples directly as a guard against contamination. "&lt;ref&gt;[http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_sic_2707?back=%2Fcollections%2Fsearch%3Fquery%3D%2522Astronautics%2522%26facets%3DMRC_2%26page%3D8%26perpage%3D10%26sort%3Drelevancy%26view%3Dlist "Lunar Sample Damaged by vandals"] ''[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]'', Page 16, September 27, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memphis, Tennessee===
In an August 8, 1986 article written by [[United Press International]] entitled "Police Look for Stolen Moon Rocks" the author wrote: "Memphis police are looking for some moon rocks taken from a NASA van that was stolen." The van was assigned to Louis Marshall of Memphis, who conducts education programs for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The van was stolen from outside his home Tuesday night, driven to a field and set afire, police said Friday. A space suit in the van was left to burn. But thieves took some lunar rock and soil specimens, police said. Marshall said it was hard to put a value on them. It's stuff that belongs to all of us,' he said.' I'm out of business right now,' said Marshall. It will take a while to replace the items, he said. NASA officials said that out of {{convert|384|kg}} of Moon rock retrieved through the years, the sample was not a big loss. I don't know what value it would be except just to gloat over it personally,' said NASA spokesman Terry White about the theft. White said theft is not a common problem with the NASA exhibits, which are shown to schools around the country.’ I’d always thought, Who's going to mess with a big red van with NASA on it?'  Marshall said."&lt;ref&gt;"Police Look for Stolen Moon Rocks" [[United Press International]], August 8, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no indication that this theft was related to a Moon rock theft that followed just a few days later in Louisiana.

===Louisiana Science and Nature Center===
A set of six fragments of Moon rocks used in educational programs were stolen from the Louisiana Science and Nature Center by ripping a small safe out of a wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1986-08-18/news/mn-18224_1_moon-rocks "Six Moon Rocks Stolen from New Orleans Center"]  The Associated Press, August 18, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The case remains unsolved.

===Virginia Beach===
On January 10, 2006, Rudo Kashiri, an education specialist employed by NASA, reported that someone broke into a van that was parked in the driveway of her home in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]] and made off with a collection of NASA Moon rocks. The rocks were in a safe that was bolted to the van. The safe may or may not have been properly locked. As an Education Specialist for NASA, Kashiri’s job involved bringing the Moon rocks to schools and showing them to students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://six.pairlist.net/mailman/listinfo/meteorite-list " Faulty safe cited in moon rock theft: Educator whose van was broken into says safe didn't always lock"] RICHMOND TIMES-DISPATCH ), A.J.

'''Structural folding''' is the network property of a cohesive group whose membership overlaps with that of another cohesive group.&lt;ref name="De Vaan"&gt;De Vaan, M., Stark, D., &amp; Vedres, B. (2014). Game Changer: The Topology of Creativity. American Journal of Sociology.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea reaches back to [[Georg Simmel]]'s argument that individuality itself might be the product of unique intersection of network circles.&lt;ref name="Simmel"&gt;Simmel, Georg. 1922 [1955]. Conflict and the Web of Group Affiliations, translated and edited by Kurt Wolff. Free Press: Glencoe, IL, USA&lt;/ref&gt;
==Network structures in the business world==

It has been proposed that successful firms often cluster together in cohesive groups, as dense ties among the group members reduce transaction cost by providing a basis for trust and coordination amongst the firms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Useem|Useem, Michael]]. (1980) "Corporations and the Corporate Elite" Annual Review of Sociology 6:41-77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uzzi, B. (1997). Social Structure and Competition in Interfirm Networks. Administrative Science Quarterly, 447-504.&lt;/ref&gt; Cohesive ties also enable the firms to implement projects beyond their capacity and cushions them against great uncertainty &lt;ref&gt;Granovetter, Mark (2005) "Business Groups and Social Organisations" p429-450 Handbook of Economic Sociology , 2nd ed,Edited by Neil Smelsner and Richard Swedberg, Princeton, N.J. Princeton University Press, New York: Russel Sage&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
However, another logic suggests that business groups might choose to forgo high density within the group in favour of maintaining some weaker ties to other firms outside the group. This way firms can reduce redundant ties and form long-distance links to other firms who can provide novel information to them.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, R. (1992). Structural Holes. Cambridge: MA Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; This logic rests on the assumption that the conservatizing strategy of in-group cohesion is maladaptive as it risks locking the businesses into early success and strategies, which in the absence of new information can easily become detrimental in a rapidly changing business environment.

A third, different, strategy would be to combine the benefits of the previous two. Such solutions can be termed either “closure and brokerage” or “cohesion and connectivity” and the benefits of the complementarity of these distinctive network features is common to them, especially for entrepreneurship. Actors at structural folds are multiple insiders, benefiting from dense cohesive ties that provide familiarity with the operations of the members in their group. However, due to being part of more than one group they also have access to diverse information. This combination of familiarity and diversity facilitates innovation and creative success through recombining resources.&lt;ref name="Vedres"&gt;Vedres, B., &amp; Stark, D. (2010). Structural Folds: Generative Disruption of in Overlapping Groups. American Journal of Sociology, 1150-1190.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intercohesion==

Intercohesion is a distinctive network structure built from intersecting cohesive groups. It rests on the theoretical principle that cohesive group structures are not necessarily exclusive, but network structures can actually be cohesive and overlapping.&lt;ref name="Vedres" /&gt; This idea originates from Georg Simmel's who, in one of his works, argued that a person is often a member of more than one cohesive group in the same time, and these multiple group memberships are part of both individuation and social integration of the person.&lt;ref name="Simmel" /&gt; Intercohesion thus refers to mutually interpenetrating, cohesive structures, while the resulting distinctive network position at the intersection is a structural fold.&lt;ref name="Vedres" /&gt;

==Innovation==

As actors at structural folds can be considered multiple insiders, who benefit from both dense cohesive ties that provide familiarity with the operations of the members in their group and from access to non-redundant information, they are believed to be in a better position for innovation and creative success. 
Based on the Schumpeterian understanding of the term, entrepreneurship is conceptualised as knowledge production through recombination, rather than just importing new ideas. Thus, actors at structural folds occupy a privileged position for successful innovation and creativity. On the one hand, they are part of a cohesive group that provides deeply familiar access to knowledge bases and productive resources, which are essential for generative recombination. On the other hand, they also have the opportunity to interact across different groups and have access to a diverse set of sources, which are also considered key for innovative recombination of already existing resource.&lt;ref name="Vedres" /&gt; Vedres and Stark (2010) in their study indeed found that structural folding contributed to higher performance of business groups.

Moreover, entrepreneurship also has dynamic properties along the temporal dimension. As [[Schumpeter]] observed entrepreneurship also brings along what he called [[creative destruction]]. Applied to network analytical terms, structural folding may in fact destabilise groups &lt;ref name="Vedres" /&gt;  as overlapping membership can disrupt group coordination and reciprocal trust. On an empirical level, it was found that in the case of Hungarian businesses, groups with more structural folds are more likely to break up, and when they do so they are likely to fragment into smaller groups.

==Creativity==

It has also been argued that structural folding also contributes to creative success in the case of cultural products especially, when the overlapping groups are cognitively distant.&lt;ref name="De Vaan" /&gt; For creative innovation, teams need to have a diversity of stylistic elements for recombination. In cultural fields, where teams periodically assemble, dissolve and reassemble the knowledge base of team resides in the previous experience of its members with various styles. Cognitively diverse groups held in tension by structural folds have both a greater repertoire of action and the ability to recontextualize knowledge. Thus, structural folding improves the likelihood of creative success and innovation by increasing the possibility to override things that are taken for granted and to think more reflexively.Therefore cognitively distant but overlapping cohesive group structures are productive because of the mixing, ambiguities and tensions they encounter.&lt;ref name="De Vaan" /&gt;

'''Tadeáš Polanský''', {{lang-la|'''Thaddaeus Polansky'''}}, {{lang-de|'''Thaddäus Polansky'''}} (1713 – 1770) was a [[Jesuit order|Jesuit]] theologian and scientist in the field of physics.

== Life ==
Tadeáš Polanský was since 1734 lecturing at a [[Gymnasium (school)]] in [[Uherské Hradiště]]. Later he became professor of [[dogmatics]] at [[University of Olomouc]]. Apart from theology, he was, together with [[Polanský Jan Nepomuk]] (1723 – 1776), active in the field of physics, researching lightning and thunder, colors, phases of Venus, primary and secondary [[rainbow]], and other.&lt;ref name="Nespor"&gt;{{cite book

|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In years 1760 – 1761, Polanský became dean of the University's [[Palacký University of Olomouc#Saints Cyril and Methodius Faculty of Theology|Faculty of Theology]].

He was lecturing in Olomouc at the time when [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]] stepped up his fight for absolute power, effectively restricting the Jesuit monopoly in education. At the University of Olomouc, the struggle was taking place particularly between the conservative Jesuits and a proponent of enlightenment ideas [[Josef Vratislav Monse]].

Polanský's book ''Manudictio sacerdotis ad com-modissime subeundum examen pro approbatione et jurisdictione'', printed in 1762, was banned in 1769. Later, in February 1771, a directive explicitly ordered ''Ausrottung'' (extermination) of the book, while another one from May 1771 introduced heavy fines for mere possession of the book.&lt;ref name="geryk"&gt;{{Citation

'''''The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets''''' is a 2013 book by [[Simon Singh]], which is based on the premise that "many of the writers of ''The Simpsons'' are deeply in love with [[number]]s, and their ultimate desire is to drip-feed morsels of [[mathematics]] into the [[subconscious]] minds of viewers".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/24/simpsons-mathmatical-secrets-simon-singh-review | title=The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets by Simon Singh – review | publisher=The Guardian | date=24 October 2013 | accessdate=20 March 2014 | author=Jones, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book compiles all the mathematical references used throughout the [[television show|show's]] run, and analyzes them in detail. Rather than just explaining the mathematical concepts in the context of how they relate to the relevant [[television episode|episodes]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', Singh "uses them as a starting point for lively discussions of mathematical topics, anecdotes and history".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/science/investigating-the-simpsons-and-their-mathematical-secrets.html|title=Examining the Square Root of D’oh!|work=The New York Times|date=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
''The Guardian'' described it as a "readable and unthreatening introduction to various [[number theory|mathematical concepts]]".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; ''The New York Times'' described it as a "highly entertaining book".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

'''Unidentified decedent''' or '''unidentified person''' (also abbreviated as '''UID''' or '''UP''') is a term in [[American English]] used to describe a corpse of a person whose identity cannot be established by police and medical examiners. In many cases, it is several years before the identities of some UIDs are found, while in some cases, they are never identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolved Cases|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/identifiedindex.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=18 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022035042/http://www.doenetwork.org/identifiedindex.html|archivedate=22 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A UID may remain unidentified due to lack of evidence as well as absence of personal identification such as a driver's license. Where the remains have deteriorated or been mutilated to the point that the body is not easily recognized, a UID's face may be [[forensic facial reconstruction|reconstructed]] to show what it had looked like before death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Ellen L.|last=Slott|title=Sculptor Reconstructs Faces to Aid Police|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/61189146/?terms=unidentified+murder+victim|newspaper=The Evening Review|date=21 December 1977|page=3|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = 21 July 2014 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; UIDs are often referred to by the [[placeholder name]]s "John Doe" or "Jane Doe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Are Unidentified People Called John or Jane Doe?|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/29996/why-are-unidentified-people-called-john-or-jane-doe|website=mentalfloss.com|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

There are approximately 40,000 UIDs in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=John|title=Missing/inaction Morgues hold about 40,000 sets of unidentified remains.

===Location===

[[File:Jock Doe.jpg|thumb|150px|"Jock Doe," one of the [[Sumter County Does]], may have been from Canada but was found in the United States]]

Some UIDs die outside their native state. The [[Sumter County Does]], murdered in South Carolina, may have been Canadian.&lt;ref name=bodies/&gt; [[Death of Barbara Precht|Barbara Hess Precht]] died in Ohio in 2006 but was not identified until 2014. She had been living as a transient with her husband in California for decades but returned to her native state of Ohio, where she died of unknown circumstances.&lt;ref name=new&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dixon|first1=Deb|title=New Clues about 'Pearl Lady's' Husband|url=http://www.local12.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/new-clues-pearl-ladys-husband-20609.shtml|accessdate=20 November 2014|work=WKRC Cincinnati|agency=CBS|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141119034054/http://www.local12.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/new-clues-pearl-ladys-husband-20609.shtml|archivedate=19 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both of these cases, the UIDs were found in a recognizable state and had their fingerprints and dental records taken with ease. It is unknown if the Sumter County Does' DNA was later recovered, since their bodies would require exhumation to recover DNA.&lt;ref name=bodies&gt;{{cite news|via=Newspapers.com|title=Bodies Remain Unidentified|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/53605031/|accessdate=7 August 2014|agency=The Daily Times-News|date=19 September 1976|page=10}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lourdes, France, a corpse believed to have been native to a different country was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 354UFFRA|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases-int/354uffra.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=6 March 2015|date=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many illegal immigrants that die in the United States after crossing the border from Mexico remain unidentified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stryker|first1=Ace|title=In Southwest, illegal immigrants often die anonymously|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/nation-world/article/In-Southwest-illegal-immigrants-often-die-1653188.php|accessdate=23 July 2015|work=Seattle Pi|publisher=''Associated Press''|date=2 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decomposition===

Many UIDs are found long after they die and have decomposed severely. This significantly changes their facial features and may prevent identification through fingerprints. Environmental conditions often are a major factor in decomposition, as some UIDs are found months after death with little decomposition if their bodies are placed in cold areas. Some are found in warm areas shortly after death, but hot temperatures and scavenging animals deteriorated the features.&lt;ref name="Mummies of the World"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 10566|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/10566|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=December 22, 2014|date=August 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pima Arizona Jane Doe April 1981|url=http://canyouidentifyme.org/PimaArizonaJaneDoeApril1981|website=canyouidentifyme.org|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, warm temperatures mummify the corpse, which also distorts its features, though the tissues have survived initial decomposition. One example is the "[[Persian Princess]]", who died in the 1990s but, in an act of [[archaeological forgery]], was untruthfully stated in Pakistan to have been over 2,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Romey |first= Kristin M. |last2= Rose |first2= Mark |date=January–February 2001 |url= http://www.archaeology.org/0101/etc/persia.html |title= Special Report: Saga of the Persian Princess |journal= Archaeology |volume= 54 |issue= 1 |publisher= Archaeological Institute of America|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A man found in Idar-Oberstein, Germany, in 1994 had died months before his body was found, yet in some places, his skin had not deteriorated and tattoos were found, which are also used to identify the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 197UMDEU|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases-int/197umdeu.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Putrefaction====

[[Putrefaction]] often occurs when bacteria decompose the remains and generate gasses inside, causing the corpse to swell and become discolored.&lt;ref name="Mummies of the World"/&gt; In cases such as the Rogers family, who were murdered in 1989 by [[Oba Chandler]], the bodies were deposited in water but surfaced after gasses in their remains caused them to float to the surface. They were deceased a short period of time but were already severely decomposed and unrecognizable, due to putrefaction that occurred while underwater and high temperatures. It was not until a week later that dental records revealed their identities.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdett, Paul, prod. "Water Logged." ''[[Forensic Files]]''. Dir. Michael Jordan. HLN. 10 Dec. 2010. Television&lt;/ref&gt;

====Skeletonization====

Skeletonization occurs when the UID has decayed to the point that bones and possibly some tissues are all that is found, usually when death occurred a significant amount of time before discovery. If a skeletonized body is found, fingerprints and toeprints are impossible to recover, unless they have survived the initial decomposition of the remains. Fingerprints are often used to identify the dead and were used widely before DNA comparison was possible.&lt;ref name="Mummies of the World"/&gt; In some cases, partial remains limit the available information; for example, a woman's skull found in Frankfurt, Germany, was insufficient to estimate her height and weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 469UFDEU|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases-int/469ufdeu.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeletonized UIDs are often [[forensic facial reconstruction|forensically reconstructed]] if searching dental records and DNA databases is unsuccessful.

===Traumatic injuries===

Some UIDs experience trauma that significantly alters their appearance, especially those who die in vehicular accidents or were murdered in a violent manner. A facial expression often represents the pain, which shifts the face into a position that would not commonly be seen by the public, including those who have seen the person when they were alive. A body found decapitated would also prove to be unrecognizable.&lt;ref name=role/&gt; Many UIDs whose heads were not recovered remain unidentified, like in the [[Whitehall Mystery]], which occurred in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Whitehall Mystery|url=http://www.futilitycloset.com/2007/10/16/the-whitehall-mystery/|website=www.futilitycloset.com|accessdate=22 February 2015|date=16 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burning===
Often, someone who tries to conceal a body attempts to destroy it or render it unrecognizable.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hayes|first1=Ashley|title=How authorities identify a burned body|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/13/health/burned-body-id/|accessdate=1 January 2015|agency=[[CNN]]|date=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The currently unidentified [[Yermo John Doe]] was killed approximately one hour before he was found, but was completely unrecognizable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 918|url=https://identifyus.org/en/cases/918|work=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=19 November 2014|date=12 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Lynn Breeden, a Canadian model, was murdered and set ablaze in a dumpster, her body was so severely damaged that DNA processing and fingerprint analysis were impossible. She was identified sometime later after her unique dentition matched her own dental records, and DNA extracted from her blood at a different scene was matched.&lt;ref&gt;Dowling, Paul. "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXHi3N9NjWA Charred Remains]." ''Forensic Files'' HLN. Atlanta, Georgia, 13 Nov. 1997. Television.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linda Agostini]]'s body was found burned near Albury, Australia in 1934. Her remains were identified ten years later through dental comparison.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{Citation| first=Bruce| last=Pennay| title =Agostini, Linda (1905 - 1934)| publisher =[[Australian National University]]| work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]| url =http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A130703b.htm| accessdate = 2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification process==

Usually, bodies are identified by comparing their usually unique [[DNA]], fingerprints and dental characteristics.&lt;ref name=idvic&gt;{{cite web|last1=Claridge|first1=Jack|title=Identifying the Victim|url=http://www.exploreforensics.co.uk/identifying-the-victim.html|website=Explore Forensics|accessdate=1 January 2015|date=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA is considered the most accurate, but was not as widely used until the 1990s. It is often obtained through hair follicles, blood, tissue and other biological material.&lt;ref name=eight&gt;{{cite web|title=8 Body Parts Forensic Scientists Use to ID a Body|url=http://www.forensicsciencetechnician.org/8-body-parts-forensic-scientists-use-to-id-a-body/|website=Forensic Science Technician|accessdate=1 January 2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bodies can also be identified with other physical information, such as illnesses, evidence of surgery, breaks and fractures, and height and weight information.&lt;ref name=three&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valk|first1=Diana|title=3 Ways to Identify a Body When DNA is Not An Option|url=http://forensicoutreach.com/three-ways-to-identify-a-body-when-dna-is-not-an-option/|website=Forensics Outreach|accessdate=1 January 2015|date=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A medical examiner will often be involved with identifying a body.&lt;ref name=virtual&gt;{{cite web|title=IDENTIFICATION PROCESS|url=http://www.sfu.museum/forensics/eng/pg_media-media_pg/identification/|website=virtualmuseum.com|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lib&gt;{{cite web|title=POSTMORTEM IDENTIFICATION|url=http://www.crimemuseum.org/crime-library/postmortem-identification|website=Crime Library|accessdate=1 January 2015|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mortuary photographs===

{{Double image|right|Valentine Doe body.jpg|150|Valentine Doe 1993 Comp.jpg|190|Reconstructions are considered to be more accurate with representing a UID when they were alive, especially with violent deaths, like "[[Valentine Doe]]"}}

Many police departments and medical examiners have made efforts to identify the deceased by placing mortuary photographs of the UID's face online. In some instances, the mortuary photographs would be retouched of wounds if they are to be released to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friess|first1=Steve|title=To identify 'John Doe' victims, investigators turn to the Web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/01/25/to_identify_john_doe_victims_investigators_turn_to_the_web/|accessdate=23 July 2015|work=Boston Globe|date=25 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dismembered corpses may also be digitally altered to appear attached to the body.&lt;ref name=role&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pravir Bodkha, Bishwanath Yadav|title=A Role of Digital Imaging in Identification of Unidentified Bodies|journal=J Indian Acad Forensic Med|date=December 2012|volume=34|issue=4|accessdate=31 December 2014|url=http://medind.nic.in/jal/t12/i4/jalt12i4p318.pdf|issn=0971-0973}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not considered to be the most effective method, as the nature of death often distorts the UID's face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Question: Why don't you share photos from the coroner's office?|url=https://www.facebook.com/HelpIDMe/photos/a.830100223684553.1073741890.698376120190298/830098297018079/?type=1&amp;theater|website=Help ID Me|publisher=[[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]]|accessdate=9 April 2015|date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is that of "[[Grateful Doe]]," who was killed in a vehicular crash in 1995. He sustained extreme trauma that disfigured his face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lohr|first1=David|title=Grateful Dead Fan Remains Nameless, 18 Years After Fatal Crash|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/25/grateful-doe_n_5208512.html|accessdate=5 September 2014|agency=[[Huffington Post]]|date=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Milwaukee County Jane Doe|Jane Doe found in a river]] in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, had died months earlier, but was preserved by the cold temperatures. Her morgue photographs were displayed publicly on a medical examiner's website, but her face had been distorted by swelling after absorbing water, with additional decomposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luthern|first1=Ashley|title=Investigators trying to solve mystery of woman found in 1982|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/investigators-trying-to-solve-mystery-of-woman-found-in-1982-b99396464z1-284101131.html?ipad=y|accessdate=13 December 2014|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|agency=Journal Sentinel|date=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death masks have also been used to assist with identification, which have been stated to be more accurate, as they are required to display "relaxed expressions," which often do not illustrate the faces of the UIDs as they were found, such as that of [[L'Inconnue de la Seine]], a French suicide victim found in the late 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Angelique|last=Chrisafis  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Ophelia of the Seine |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/art/visualart/story/0,,2219993,00.html |work=The Guardian Weekend magazine, page 17 - 27 |publisher=The Guardian  |date= December 1, 2007 |accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a death mask will still depict sunken eyes or other characteristics of a long-term illness, which do not often show how they would have looked in life.&lt;ref name="Mummies of the World"&gt;Madea, Burkhard, Johanna Preuss, and Frank Musshoff. "From Flourishing Life to Dust-The Natural Cycle." ''Mummies of the World''. Ed. Alfried Wieczorek and Wilfried Rosendahl. First ed. 2010. 28. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstructions===

{{main article|Forensic facial reconstruction}}

When a body is found in an advanced state of decomposition or has died violently, reconstructions are sometimes required to receive assistance from the public, when releasing images of a corpse is considered taboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Izadi|first1=Elahe|title=Can this computer generated image of a ‘Baby Doe’ lead investigators to her identity?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/07/08/can-this-computer-generated-image-of-a-baby-doe-lead-investigators-to-her-identity/|accessdate=4 August 2015|work=The Washington Post|date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, those in a recognizable state will often be reconstructed due to the same reason.

Faces can be reconstructed with a three-dimensional model or by 2D, which includes sketches or digital reconstructions, similar to [[facial composite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kilgannon|first1=Corey|title=Through Art and Forensics, Faces of Unidentified Victims Emerge|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/nyregion/through-art-and-forensics-students-give-unknown-victims-an-identity.html?smid=fb-share|accessdate=21 January 2015|work=New York Times|date=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Rick|last= Martinez|title=Sculptor Reconstructs Faces to Aid Police|url=https://www.newspapers.com/search/#query=unidentified+murder+victim&amp;offset=1|newspaper=San Bernardo County Sun|date=9 May 1979|page=27|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = 21 July 2014 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sketches have been used in a variety of cases. Forensic artist [[Karen T. Taylor]] created her own method during the 1980s, which involved much more precise techniques, such as estimating locations and sizes of the features of a skull. This method has been shown to be fairly successful.&lt;ref&gt;Dowling, Paul. "Saving Face." ''[[Forensic Files]]''. Prod. Paul Bourdett and Vince Sherry. Dir. Michael Jordan. 28 Nov. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has developed methods to estimate the likenesses of the faces of UIDs whose remains were too deteriorated to create a two-dimensional sketch or reconstruction due to the lack of tissue on the bones. A skull would be placed through a CT scanner and the image would then be manipulated with a software that was intended for architecture design, to add digital layers of tissue based on the UID's age, sex and race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hicks|first1=Brad|title=Unraveling the Jane Doe Mystery|url=http://fox6now.com/2012/02/29/unraveling-the-jane-doe-mystery/|accessdate=25 July 2014|publisher=Fox News|date=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examples====

The following gallery depicts various ways UIDs have been reconstructed. None of those shown have been identified.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Problems===

In some cases, such as that of [[Christopher Wilder|Colleen Orsborn]], the true identity of the unidentified person is excluded from the case. In Orsborn's case, she had fractured one of the bones in her leg, but a medical examiner who performed the autopsy on her remains was not able to discover evidence of the injury and subsequently excluded her from the case.

'''Unitary theories of memory''' are hypotheses that attempt to unify mechanisms of [[short-term memory|short-term]] and [[long-term memory]]. James Nairne proposed the first unitary theory, which criticized [[Alan Baddeley|Alan Baddeley's]] [[working memory|working memory model]],&lt;ref name=a&gt;Nairne, J. (1990) A feature model of immediate memory. ''Memory &amp; Cognition'' 18 (3), 251-269&lt;/ref&gt; which is the dominant theory of the functions of short-term memory. Other theories since Nairne have been proposed; they highlight alternative mechanisms that the working memory model initially overlooked.

==Background==

===Overview===

{{Main|Working memory}}

'''Working memory''' is the system that is responsible for the transient holding and processing of new and already stored information, an important process for reasoning, comprehension, learning and memory updating. Working memory is generally used synonymously with [[short term memory]], but this depends on how the two forms of memory are defined.&lt;ref name="Cowan"&gt;{{cite journal | title = What are the differences between long-term, short-term, and working memory? | author=Cowan, Nelson | journal=Prog Brain Res. | year=2008 | issue=169 | pages=323–338 |pmid=18394484 | doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(07)00020-9 | pmc=2657600 | volume=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working memory includes subsystems that store and manipulate visual images or verbal information, as well as a central executive that coordinates the subsystems. It includes visual representation of the possible moves, and awareness of the flow of information into and out of memory, all stored for a limited amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Daniel|title=Psychology Second Edition|origyear=2009|year=2011|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=United States of America|isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Baddeley's model of working memory}}

In 1974, [[Alan Baddeley|Baddeley]] and [[Graham Hitch|Hitch]]&lt;ref name="Baddeley Hitch 1974"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Baddeley    | first1 = Alan D.  | last2 = Hitch | first2 = Graham  | title = Working Memory | volume = 2 | editors = Gordon H. Bower | work = The psychology of learning and motivation | publisher = Academic Press | year = 1974 | pages = 47–89 | isbn = 978-0-12-543308-2 |oclc = 777285348 |doi= 10.1016/S0079-7421(08)60452-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  introduced and made popular the [[Baddeley's model of working memory|multicomponent model of working memory]]. This theory proposes a [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Central executive|central executive]] that, among other things, is responsible for directing [[attention]] to relevant information, suppressing irrelevant information and inappropriate actions, and for coordinating cognitive processes when more than one task must be done at the same time. The central executive has two "slave systems" responsible for short-term maintenance of information, and a "central executive" is responsible for the supervision of information integration and for coordinating the slave systems. One slave system, the [[phonological loop]] (PL), stores phonological information (that is, the sound of language) and prevents its decay by continuously articulating its contents, thereby refreshing the information in a [[memory rehearsal|rehearsal]] loop. It can, for example, maintain a seven-digit telephone number for as long as one repeats the number to oneself again and again. The other slave system, the [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Visuospatial sketchpad|visuo-spatial sketchpad]], stores visual and spatial information. It can be used, for example, for constructing and manipulating visual images, and for the representation of mental maps. The sketchpad can be further broken down into a visual subsystem (dealing with, for instance, shape, colour, and texture), and a spatial subsystem (dealing with location).

In 2000, Baddeley extended the model by adding a fourth component, the [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Episodic buffer|episodic buffer]], which holds representations that integrate phonological, visual, and spatial information, and possibly information not covered by the slave systems (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;semantic information, musical information). The component is episodic because it is assumed to bind information into a unitary episodic representation. The episodic buffer resembles Tulving's concept of [[episodic memory]], but it differs in that the episodic buffer is a temporary store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://nbu.bg/cogs/events/2002/materials/Markus/ep_bufer.pdf | title=The episodic buffer: a new component of working memory? | author=Baddeley, A. D. | journal=Trends Cogn. Sci. | year=2000 | volume=4 | pages=417–423 | doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01538-2 | pmid=11058819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==

===Feature model===

The feature model was first described by Nairne (1990)&lt;ref name=a /&gt; The primary feature of this model is the use of cues for both short term memory and long term memory. Cues become associated with a memory and can later be used to retrieve memories from long term storage.
When a memory is formed, cues associated with the formed memory form a constellation of nerve networks in which the memory is stored. While the cues are present, the nerves that form the constellation are active and the memory is being worked on in short term memory. When the cues are no longer present, the constellation is no longer active and is waiting in long term memory storage for when the cues are once again present.
Rather than using the theory of decay for explaining how memories get forgotten, the feature model focuses on item based interference instead. This means that other items that use the same or similar constellations of cues get in the way of remembering other memories. For example, if you are trying to remember a fruit from a list of electronics, you will find that the fruit is easy to recall. Recalling a fruit from a list of other fruit, on the other hand, will prove a far more difficult task. This is the theory behind memory loss used in the feature model.

===OSCAR model===

The Oscillator Based Associative Recallolation (OSCAR) Model was proposed by Browne, Preece and Hulme in 2000 &lt;ref name=b&gt;Brown GDA, Preece T, Hulme C. 2000. Oscillator-based memory for serial
order. ''Psychological Review'' 107:127-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The OSCAR Model is another cue driven model of memory. In this model, the cues work as a pointer to a memory’s position in the mind. Memories themselves are stored as context vectors on what Brown calls the oscillator part of the theory. While a memory is not being used in short term memory, the context vector oscillates further away from the starting position. When a cue becomes present, the context vector that the cue points to gets oscillated back to the starting point, where the memory can then be used in short term memory. There is no theory of decay in this model, so to account for memory loss or fading the theory states that memories move further and further from the starting point, and retrieval becomes more difficult the further the memory is from the gas station (starting position). Furthermore, some memories oscillate faster than others. The theory behind this is that memories frequently accessed and used will move slower away from the starting point since the probability of the memory being retrieved is relatively high.

==Differences==

Unlike the standard models of short term/working memory, unitary theories do not assume a direct connection between activation level and memory success. They also do not propose role rehearsal, and they focus more on item based interference rather than memory decay.&lt;ref name=c&gt;Nairne, J. (2002) Remembering Over the Short-Term: The Case Against the Standard Model. ''Annu. Rev. Psychol''. 53:53–81&lt;/ref&gt; Unitary theories also generally have only one loop or no loop at all, whereas the Working Memory model relies on multiple loops to explain the different forms of memory input.
Because of the multiple loop theory, Working Memory has a more difficult time explaining how short term memory gets consolidated into long term memory, whereas the Unitary Theories generally explain long term memory using the same single principle that they use to explain short term memory. On the other hand, Unitary Theories have more trouble explaining situations where short term memory differs such as the word length effect,&lt;ref name=d&gt;Nairne, J., &amp; Neath, I. (1995) Proactive interference plays a role in the word-length effect. ''Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review''
December 1997, Volume 4, Issue 4, pp 541-545&lt;/ref&gt; which can be more easily explained by the Working Memory model.

==Criticisms ==

The most prevalent criticism of the unitary models is that they try to oversimplify many complex processes into a single mechanism. Studies have shown that short-term memory and long-term memory are two distinct processes that emphasize different levels of activation in the brain among different cortical areas. Furthermore, the rate of decay is much faster in short-term memory as opposed to long-term memory. The OSCAR model in particular does not account for this phenomenon. It also makes an assumption that memories are always circulating to different areas of the brain—never having a definite cortical space that stores the memory. While this transfer of storage is occurring, the rate of decay in the OSCAR model is either constant or non-existent. 
Both rates are implausible, as a constant rate of decay neglects all external factors that may contribute to a faster rate of decay (e.g. stress, focusing attention on other things). Failing to neglect decay at all is even more implausible as it makes two wrong assertions—memories are not forgotten, and when the information is remembered, it is remembered perfectly every time.
While the unitary theories of memory may give attention to alternate factors that the working memory model had initially overlooked, new data has surfaced and the model has adapted to new findings. It is still the standard model of how short-term memory works, and it will continue to be the standard model until new evidence overturns it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1048">A '''[[weed]] of cultivation''' is any plant that is well-adapted to environments in which land is  [[Tillage|cultivated]] for growing some other plant. 

Many are quite specialised and can only thrive and reproduce where the ground has been broken by plough or spade. They are invariably [[Annual plant|annual]] and [[reproduction]] is by [[seed]] alone, which can in many species lie [[dormancy|dormant]] for years in the [[soil]] until brought to the surface during cultivation. They have fast reproduction cycles, usually in one year from seed to seed, though some species can have more than one generation in one season. A few species such as groundsel (''[[Senecio vulgaris]]''), shepherd's purse (''[[Capsella bursa-pastoris]]''), red deadnettle (''[[Lamium purpureum]]'') and chickweed (''[[Stellaria media]]'') can survive unharmed through very cold weather and are often able to seed even in winter.

The '''World Health Organisation Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)''' is a structured interview for psychiatric disorders. As the interview is designed for [[epidemiological studies]], it can be administered by those who are not clinically trained and can be completed in a short amount of time. Versions of the CIDI were used in two important studies, the [[National Comorbidity Survey]] (NCS)&lt;ref name="NCS"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blazer |first1=DG |last2=Kessler |first2=RC |last3=McGonagle |first3=KA |last4=Swartz |first4=MS |name-list-format=vanc |date=July 1994 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/151/7/979 |url-access=subscription |title=The prevalence and distribution of major depression in a national community sample: The National Comorbidity Survey |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=151 |issue=7 |pages=979-86 |pmid=8010383 |doi=10.1176/ajp.151.7.979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R)&lt;ref name="NCSR"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kessler |first1=Ronald C. |last2=Chiu |first2=Wai Tat |last3=Demler |first3=Olga |last4=Merikangas |first4=Kathleen R. |last5=Walters |first5=Ellen E. |name-list-format=vanc |date=June 2005 |url=http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/208671 |title=Prevalence, Severity, and Comorbidity of 12-Month DSM-IV Disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=62 |issue=6 |pages=617-27 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.62.6.617 |doi-access=free |pmid=15939839 |pmc=2847357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
which are often used as a reference for estimates of the rates of psychiatric illness in the USA.
The first version of the CIDI was published in 1988,&lt;ref name="CIDI"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Lee N. |last1=Robins |first2=John |last2=Wing |first3=Hans Ulrich |last3=Wittchen |first4=John E. |last4=Helzer |first5=Thomas F. |last5=Babor |first6=Jay |last6=Burke |first7=Anne |last7=Farmer |first8=Assen |last8=Jablenski |first9=Roy |last9=Pickens |first10=Darrel A. |last10=Regier |first11=Norman |last11=Sartorius |first12=Leland H. |last12=Towle |name-list-format=vanc |url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/45/12/1069 |url-access=subscription |title=The Composite International Diagnostic Interview: An Epidemiologic Instrument Suitable for Use in Conjunction With Different Diagnostic Systems and in Different Cultures |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=45 |issue=12 |pages=1069-1077 |date=December 1988 |pmid=2848472 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1988.01800360017003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been periodically updated to reflect the changing diagnostic criteria of [[DSM-IV|DSM]] and [[ICD-10|ICD]].

The '''Composite International Diagnostic Interview – Short Form''' ('''CIDI-SF''') was first published by [[Ronald C. Kessler]] and colleagues in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Ronald C. |last1=Kessler |author1-link=Ronald C. Kessler |first2=Gavin |last2=Andrews |first3=Daniel |last3=Mroczek |first4=Bedirhan |last4=Ustun |first5=Hans-Ulrich |last5=Wittchen |name-list-format=vanc |date=November 1998 |title=The World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview short-form (CIDI-SF) |journal=International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=171-185 |doi=10.1002/mpr.47 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the [[PhenX Toolkit]] uses this as its adult protocol for general psychiatric assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=31 January 2017 |title=Protocol Overview: General Psychiatric Assessment - Adult |website=PhenX Toolkit, Ver 20.0 |publisher=RTI International |url=https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/index.php?pageLink=browse.protocoldetails&amp;id=120101 |dead-url=no |archive-date=31 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131155302/https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/index.php?pageLink=browse.protocoldetails&amp;id=120101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the CIDI-SF is no longer supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/wmhcidi/about-the-who-wmh-cidi/|title=About the WHO WMH-CIDI|last=|first=|date=2017|website=World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920000344/https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/wmhcidi/about-the-who-wmh-cidi/|archive-date=20 September 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2007 memo by Kessler, this decision was based on decreased need for the CIDI-SF following the introduction of other short interviews (specifically, [[Patient Health Questionnaire|PRIME-MD]] and [[Mini-international neuropsychiatric interview|MINI]]) and a lack of funding to refine the instrument.&lt;ref name=KesslerMemo2007&gt;{{cite web |last=Kessler |first=Ron |name-list-format=vanc |date=17 August 2007 |title=CIDI-SF Memo |website=World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview |url=https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/wmhcidi/ftpdir_public/CIDI-SF%20memo.pdf |format=PDF |dead-url=no |archive-date=21 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021065136/http://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/wmhcidi/ftpdir_public/CIDI-SF%20memo.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
