'''Alfredo Ottaviani''' (29 October 1890 – 3 August 1979) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. [[Pope Pius XII]] named him cardinal in 1953. He served as Secretary of the [[Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith|Holy Office]] in the [[Roman Curia]] from 1959 to 1966 when that [[dicastery]] was reorganised as the [[Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith]], of which he was Pro-Prefect until 1968.

Ottaviani was a prominent figure in the Church during his time and was the leading [[Conservatism|conservative]] voice at the [[Second Vatican Council]].

== Early life ==
Ottaviani was born in [[Rome]]; his father was a [[baker]]. He studied with the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|Brothers of the Christian Schools]] in [[Trastevere]], at the [[Pontifical Roman Seminary]] and the [[Pontifical Roman Athenaeum S. Apollinare|Pontifical Roman Athenaeum ''S. Apollinare'']], from where he received his [[doctorate]]s in [[philosophy]], [[theology]], and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]].  He was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] on 18 March 1916.

== Holy Office/Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith ==
[[File:Coat of arms of Alfredo Ottaviani.svg|thumb|left|200px|Arms of Ottaviani]]
On 12 January 1953, he was both appointed Pro-Secretary of the [[Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith|Holy Office]] and created [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal-Deacon]] of [[Santa Maria in Domnica]] by [[Pope Pius XII]].  He participated as a cardinal-elector in the [[Papal conclave, 1958|1958 conclave]] which elected [[Pope John XXIII]].

On 7 November 1959, he was named the [[Holy See|Vatican's]] chief doctrinal guardian as Secretary of the Holy Office. Ottaviani was appointed [[Titular bishop|Titular Archbishop]] of [[Veria|Berrhoea]] on 5 April 1962, receiving his [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|episcopal consecration]] on the following 19 April from [[Pope John XXIII]] himself, with Cardinals [[Giuseppe Pizzardo]] and [[Benedetto Aloisi Masella]] serving as [[Consecrator|co-consecrators]]. His episcopal [[motto]] ''Semper idem'' ("Always the same") reflected his conservative theology. He resigned his titular see in 1963.

=== Second Vatican Council ===
Ottaviani was the leader of the [[Roman Curia|curial]] [[Conservatism|conservatives]] during the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–1965), despite being nearly [[Blindness|blind]] throughout the entire course of the council and afterwards. At the council Ottaviani worked with, amongst others, Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]]. During the last of the council's preparatory sessions, Ottaviani engaged in a heated debate with Cardinal [[Augustin Bea]] over the subject of [[Freedom of religion|religious liberty]].&lt;ref&gt;SSPX. [http://www.sspx.org/miscellaneous/role_of_sspx_in_heart-church.htm The Role of the Priestly Society of St. Pius X in the Heart of the Church] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813090303/http://www.sspx.org/miscellaneous/role_of_sspx_in_heart-church.htm |date=2007-08-13 }} January 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Ottaviani, while opposed to the [[Separation of church and state|separation of Church and State]] and granting equal rights to all [[religion]]s, supported [[Religious toleration|religious tolerance]]—suppressing public manifestations of non-Catholic religions when possible. Their confrontation became so intense that Cardinal [[Ernesto Ruffini]] had to intervene, noting his disappointment at such a "serious discussion". Ottaviani also argued during the debates on the liturgy&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,829504-1,00.html The Cardinal's Setback] November 23, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EWTN. [http://www.ewtn.com/library/Theology/SIPVAT2.HTM What Went Wrong With Vatican II] 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and on the sources of [[Revelation|Divine Revelation]],&lt;ref&gt;Vatican II – Voice of the Church. [http://vatican2voice.org/symp/hurley.asp Council Reminiscences] January 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; which are understood as [[Bible|Scripture]] and [[Sacred Tradition|Tradition]] in Catholic theology.

During the council the news media often went to Ottaviani for colorful reactions to stormy working sessions. In one speech at the council, reacting to repeated mentions of "collegiality" of bishops, Ottaviani pointed out that the Bible only records one example of the apostles acting collegially – at the Garden of Gethsemane when "They all fled."&lt;ref name="Enforcer"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cardinal Ratzinger: The Vatican's Enforcer of the Faith|author=John L. Allen, Jr.|publisher=The Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd|year=2000}}. Of this book, Allen later said: "If I were to write the book again today, I'm sure it would be more balanced, better informed, and less prone to veer off into judgment ahead of sober analysis"; and he accepted that the book had correctly been described as "Manichean journalism" ([http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/word042605.htm John L. Allen, Jr, "Pondering the first draft of history" in ''National Catholic Reporter'', 26 April 2005]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ottaviani was opposed in his movements for a rapid council by [[Germany|German]] Cardinal [[Josef Frings]] of Cologne. Frings often clashed with Ottaviani on which direction the council should take. In this, he was assisted by "a [then] progressive firebrand"&lt;ref name="Enforcer" /&gt; who was "dissatisfied with many of the answers offered by the Church's official authorities",&lt;ref name="Enforcer" /&gt; a young theological advisor named Joseph Ratzinger, who would later become prefect of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] and then [[Pope Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref name="Enforcer" /&gt; Frings had heard a lecture of the young Ratzinger on issues the upcoming council could address. It seemed to Frings that Ratzinger had set forth a complete agenda for the council that was exactly what Frings himself had in mind. Frings had Ratzinger prepare the text of a lecture that Frings was to give in Rome. After the lecture, which Pope John XXIII complimented warmly, Frings told the Pope that he did not deserve credit for the speech, as it was written by one of his priests. Pope John admitted that he too delegated much of his work. The key thing was to select the right person for the job. After this conversation, Ratzinger became Frings's lead assistant during the entire council and thereafter never left Frings's service.&lt;ref&gt;"My Brother, the Pope", Georg Ratzinger, pp. 190-1"&lt;/ref&gt;

The acrimony felt by such liberal members of the council against Ottaviani spilled out into international news in a dramatic incident on November 8, 1963, which Protestant observer Robert MacAfee Brown described as having "blown the dome off St. Peter's": in a working session of the council, Frings declared Ottaviani's [[dicastery]] a "source of [[Stumbling block|scandal]]" to the whole world.&lt;ref name="Enforcer" /&gt;

With continued worldwide interest in Vatican II, another internal matter concerning the proceedings of the council concerning Ottaviani found its way into international news. During the October 30, 1962 session concerning changes to the Mass, he went beyond the 10-minute limit imposed on all speakers. Upon Ottaviani passing this mark Cardinal [[Eugène Tisserant]], Dean of the Council Presidents showed his watch to the council president for the day [[Bernardus Johannes Alfrink|Cardinal Bernard Alfrink]] of Utrecht (whom the Associated Press described as "one of the most outspoken members...who want to see far-reaching changes inside the church."&lt;ref name="boycott" /&gt;).  Ottaviani engrossed in his topic went on condemning the proposed changes, saying "Are we seeking to stir up wonder, or perhaps scandal, among the Christian people, by introducing changes in so venerable a rite, that has been approved for so many centuries and is now so familiar? The rite of Holy Mass should not be treated as if it were a piece of cloth to be refashioned according to the whim of each generation."&lt;ref name="EWTN"&gt;{{cite web|title=What Went Wrong with Vatican II:The Catholic Crisis Explained|author=Ralp M. McInerny|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/Theology/SIPVAT2.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he had reached fifteen minutes Alfrink rang a warning bell. When Ottaviani kept speaking, Alfrink signalled to a technician who switched off the microphone. After tapping the microphone to determine it was off, the half-blind Ottaviani stumbled back to his seat in humiliation while "there was scattered applause in the council hall" by members of the council fathers who held that he had gone on too long.&lt;ref name="boycott"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cardinal Ottaviani Boycotting Council| author=Herald Tribune News Service|publisher=St Petersburg Times|date=November 12, 1962|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0Z4oAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=J1IDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2896,1214486&amp;dq=ottaviani&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EWTN" /&gt;

Scandalized by the reaction of his fellow council fathers, Ottaviani boycotted the next six council working sessions. When Cardinal [[Ernesto Ruffini]] of Palermo presided over the 11 November session he announced that "Ottaviani had been grieved by the 30 October incident" and asked council fathers to refrain from voicing approval or disapproval with applause. The Associated Press noted that "Ironically, the incident...[was] favorably commented on by the non-Catholic observers attending the council, who were struck by the {{as written|Democratic}} process and freedom of expression at the council".&lt;ref name="boycott" /&gt; As he was president of the Theological Commission responsible for amending the schema on sources of religion, Ottaviani returned to the working session to champion the position of those the Associated Press called "the static traditionalists".&lt;ref name="boycott" /&gt;

=== Papal conclave of 1963 ===
Ottaviani was one of the [[Cardinal electors in Papal conclave, 1963|cardinal electors]] who participated in the [[Papal conclave, 1963|1963 papal conclave]], which selected [[Pope Paul VI|Giovanni Battista Montini]] as Pope Paul VI. He was also the ''[[Protodeacon]]'' (senior Cardinal-Deacon) during the conclave, and as such, he [[Habemus Papam|announced]] Montini's election and [[Papal Coronation|crowning]] him on 30 June with the [[Papal tiara|triregnum]].

=== Work and retirement from the Roman Curia ===
Upon the changing of the name of the Holy Office to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 1965, Ottaviani was named Pro-Prefect of the congregation; the [[pope]] held the title of "Prefect" until 1968. He was raised to the rank of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal-Priest]] (with the same title) on 26 June 1967. As Pro-Prefect Ottaviani had described himself as a "policeman" who protected traditional doctrine.&lt;ref name=Stanford /&gt;

On 8 January 1968 Ottaviani resigned from the church's central administration. Pope Paul VI accepted the resignation and appointed Cardinal [[Franjo Seper]] of Yugoslavia to take his place as Pro-Prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. The event was seen as "a major turning point" by the [[Associated Press]], noting he was being replaced "by a prelate from a Communist country that [[Aloysius Stepinac|once imprisoned a Catholic cardinal]]...In dramatic fashion it signified the move of the half-billion-member church away from rigid conservatism toward new experiments in modernism and changing relations with Communist countries."&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite news|title=Prelate Resigns Post |first = David | last = Mazzarella |agency =Associated Press|publisher=The Stanford Daily |date=January 8, 1968|url= http://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&amp;d=stanford19680109-01.2.6&amp;e=------197-en-20--1--txt-txIN-stanford+yearbook+------ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, when Paul VI restricted voting in [[papal conclave]]s to cardinals under the age of 80, Ottaviani, already 80, said the Pope's action was "an act committed in contempt of tradition that is centuries old" and that he was "throwing overboard the bulk of his expert and gifted counselors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work= New York Times| accessdate = 9 January 2017 | date = 27 November 1970 | first= Alfred | last = Friendly Jr. | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/27/archives/ottaviani-deplores-papal-action-barring-vote-of-aged-cardinals.html | title = Ottaviani Deplores Papal Action Barring Vote of Aged Cardinals }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ottaviani died on 3 August 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = New York Times | accessdate = 10 January 2017 | date = 4 August 1979 | title = Alfredo Ottaviani, 88; Cardinal Who Headed Vatican's Holy Office | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1979/08/04/archives/alfredo-ottaviani-88-cardinal-who-headed-vaticans-holy-office.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impacts and influences ==

=== Karl Rahner ===
At the beginning of 1962, Ottaviani notified the Jesuit superiors of theologian Karl Rahner that Rahner had been placed under Roman pre-censorship. That meant that the prolific theology professor could no longer publish or lecture without permission. A few months later, in November 1962, Pope John XXIII appointed Rahner to be ''peritus'' (an expert advisor) to and at the Second Vatican Council. Since Rahner accompanied the Cardinal Archbishop of Vienna, Franz König, as a theological consultant, Ottaviani did not throw Rahner out of the council in spite of the earlier silencing.&lt;ref name="Rahner with Krauss"&gt;I Remember: An Autobiographical Interview With Meinold Krauss, Crossroad Publishing, 1985, pages 13 and 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Ottaviani Intervention" ===
{{Main|Ottaviani Intervention}}
On 25 September 1969, Ottaviani and Cardinal [[Antonio Bacci]] wrote a letter to Paul VI in support of a study by a group of theologians who under the direction of Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] criticized the new [[Order of Mass]] (in [[Latin]], ''novus Ordo Missae''), and the new [[GIRM|General Instruction]] (in Latin, ''Institutio Generalis''), two sections (in not quite definitive form) of the revision of the [[Roman Missal]] that was promulgated on 3 April of that year but that actually appeared in full only in 1970. This letter became widely known as the "[[Ottaviani Intervention]]" and is often appealed to by [[Traditionalist Catholics]] as support for their opposition to the [[Mass of Paul VI|revision]] of the [[Roman Rite]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/reformof.htm Text of the "Ottavani Intervention"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecclesiastical procedure in cases of solicitation ===
In 1962, as head, under the Pope, of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Holy Office]], Ottaviani signed its document known by its [[incipit]] ''[[Crimen sollicitationis (document)|Crimen sollicitationis]]'', which had as subtitle ''On the Manner of Proceeding in Cases of the Crime of Solicitation''. It laid down detailed rules about the procedure for ecclesiastical tribunals to follow if a priest was accused of making sexual advances connected in any way with the sacrament of Confession.&lt;ref&gt;"Vel in actu sacramentalis confessionis; vel ante aut immediate post confessionem; vel occasione vel praetextu confessionis; vel etiam extra occasionem confessionis in confessionali sive in alio loco ad confessiones excipiendas destinato aut electo cum simulatione audiendi ibidem confessionem" (opening paragraph of the document).&lt;/ref&gt; Judges and other officials of the tribunal ("each and everyone pertaining to the tribunal in any way") would be subject to automatic excommunication if they revealed anything about the conduct of the trial, even after the verdict had been declared and put into effect.&lt;ref&gt;Preliminaries 11 of the document&lt;/ref&gt; This penalty did not apply to accusers and other witnesses;&lt;ref&gt;Preliminaries 13 of the document&lt;/ref&gt; on the contrary, anyone with knowledge of the crime who failed to denounce it within one month was subject to automatic excommunication and could be absolved only after actually denouncing the priest or at least promising seriously to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Preliminaries 18&lt;/ref&gt; Violation of secrecy by the accused was also punished not by excommunication but by suspension.&lt;ref&gt;Preliminaries 13&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, 24 years after Ottaviani's death, media reports presented this document as an attempt to "hide sexual abuse".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/07/1060145760398.html The Age: "Hide sex abuse, secret Vatican paper instructs"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advancedchristianity.com/Pages/CBS/CBS.htm 1962 Vatican Document]&lt;/ref&gt; Some reported that even accusers were subjected to excommunication if they made their accusations known, and that the document was stored in the ''[[Vatican Secret Archives]]'', where it was discovered by a lawyer pursuing cases on behalf of victims of abuse by Catholic priests.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/aug/18/uk.religion The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/08/06/eveningnews/main566978.shtml CBS News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/apr/30/yehey/opinion/20080430opi5.html Manila Times] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210101415/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2008/apr/30/yehey/opinion/20080430opi5.html |date=2009-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the 69-page document was sent to "all [[Patriarch#Patriarchs of the Catholic Church|Patriarchs]], [[Archbishop#Catholic Church)|Archbishops]], [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishops]] and other [[Ordinary (officer)|Local Ordinaries]], including those of [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]]" and was to be found, even if after forty years it was generally forgotten, among the papers in their successors' offices. While media reports also suggested that the ecclesiastical verdict was never to be made known, the document itself spoke of the verdict being "declared" and "put into effect",&lt;ref&gt;Section 11 of the document&lt;/ref&gt; and the punishments laid down in canon law were: "He is to be suspended from celebrating Mass and hearing sacramental confessions and, if the gravity of the crime calls for it, he is to be declared unfit for hearing them; he is to be deprived of all benefices and ranks, of the right to vote or be voted for, and is to be declared unfit for all of them, and in more serious cases he is to be reduced to the lay state."&lt;ref&gt;"Suspendatur a celebratione Missae et ab audiendis sacramentalibus confessionibus vel etiam pro delicti gravitate inhabilis ad ipsas excipiendas declaretur, privetur omnibus beneficiis, dignitatibus, voce activa et passiva, et inhabilis ad ea omnia declaretur, et in casibus gravioribus degradationi quoque subiiciatur" ([http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/_P8L.HTM Canon 2368).]&lt;/ref&gt; These punishments were of public character and not subject to secrecy.

=== Forbidden books ===

As Secretary of the [[Holy Office]], Ottaviani was responsible for the banning of a number of books, which would accordingly have been included in any new edition of the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' (Index of Prohibited Books). The ''Index'', the last edition of which had been published in 1948, was abolished by [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1966.

==== Faustina Kowalska ====

On 6 March 1959, the Holy Office issued a notification that forbade circulation of "[[Divine Mercy image|images]] and writings that promote devotion to [[Divine Mercy]] ''in the forms proposed by Sister Faustina''" (emphasis in the original).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS%2051%20%5B1959%5D%20-%20ocr.pdf ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' LI (1959), p. 271] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303052712/http://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS%2051%20%5B1959%5D%20-%20ocr.pdf |date=March 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faustina Kowalska]] was a Polish nun who in her diary recounted conversations with [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref name=Odell&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NORyG_JzRBwC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=Odell+%22confusion+about+her+work%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cBvVUaftB4a6hAe-44DgDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Odell%20%22confusion%20about%20her%20work%22&amp;f=false Catherine M. Odell, ''Faustina'' (Our Sunday Visitor  1998 {{ISBN|978-0-87973-923-2}}), p. 157]&lt;/ref&gt; The negative judgement of the Holy Office was based on reasons that included its use of a faulty French&lt;ref name=Odell /&gt; or Italian&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;[http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2002c/083002/083002f.htm John L. Allen Jr, "A saint despite Vatican reservations" (''National Catholic Reporter'', 30 August 2002)]&lt;/ref&gt; translation of the diary. However, it was with Ottaviani's approval that Archbishop [[Pope John Paul II|Karol Wojtyła]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kraków|Kraków]] began in 1965 the informative process on Faustina's life and virtues,&lt;ref name=Odell /&gt;&lt;ref name=Allen /&gt; and the ban on her work was reversed by [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=Allen /&gt;

==== Maria Valtorta ====
Ottaviani was critical of the writings of the bed-ridden Italian mystic [[Maria Valtorta]], who reported [[visions of Jesus and Mary]].

When the typed version of the 15,000 handwritten pages of Valtorta's notebooks was prepared by Romualdo Migliorini and Corrado Berti (both [[Servite]] priests), they sought Vatican guidance for procedural advice on presenting the reputed revelations to the proper ecclesiastical hierarchy, as the local bishop's (Fontevecchia) vision was fading. At the Vatican they encountered Monsignor [[Alphonso Carinci]] and Cardinal [[Augustin Bea]], [[Pope Pius XII]]'s confessor, who advised presenting the typed manuscript directly to Pope Pius XII, through a recommended intermediary, which was accomplished in 1947. Ten months later, Carinci and Bea facilitated a meeting between the Servite priests and Pope Pius XII and it was recorded in ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', February 27, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the papal audience, [[Pope Pius XII]] reportedly said: "Publish this work as it is. There is no need to give an opinion about its origin, whether it be extraordinary or not. Who reads it, will understand."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exdeo.com/brC/berti/index.php Father Berti Events]&lt;/ref&gt; Berti signed an affidavit to this effect, stating that he had a verbal papal approval. However, once he approached the Vatican Press, he was summoned to the Holy Office, was seriously rebuked, and the Holy Office attempted to confiscate the original copies of Valtorta's writings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bardstown.com/~brchrys/Valepic.htm Valepic]&lt;/ref&gt; Valtorta's notebooks were published in 1950 by Michele Pisani as  "[[Poem of the Man God]]".

Ottaviani ordered Berti to silence. Augustin Bea, was a consultor of the Holy Office at the time it condemned the book, as was Dominican theologian [[Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange]].&lt;ref name=Likoudis&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cathtruth.com/documents/medj.htm |title=Paul Likoudis, "Does Blessed Mother Recommend A Book Church Placed on Index?" in ''The Wanderer'' |access-date=2015-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918161657/http://www.cathtruth.com/documents/medj.htm |archive-date=2015-09-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A year after the death of Pius XII, Ottaviani placed the work among the list of books he presented to the newly appointed [[Pope John XXIII]], who signed the decree banning all the books on the list.&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Berti's annotations to Maria Valtorta's ''Libro di Azaria'' (Book of Azaria), Edizioni Pisani, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:21-manasses-chronicle.jpg|thumb|Miniature from the [[Constantine Manasses]] portraying Amulius' rape of his niece Ilia(14th century)]]
{{Latin kings of Alba Longa family tree}}
In [[Roman mythology]], '''Amulius''' was king of [[Alba Longa]] who ordered the death of his infant, twin [[grandnephew]]s [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]], the eventual [[Foundation of Rome|founder]] and [[king of Rome]], and Remus.  He was deposed and killed by them after they survived and grew to adulthood.

He is the brother and [[usurper]] of [[Numitor]] and son of [[Procas]]. He was said to have reigned 42 years before his death (794-752 BC).&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] ''Roman Antiquities'' 1.71&lt;/ref&gt;  His brother, had been king, but Amulius overthrew him, killed his son, and took the throne. He forced [[Rhea Silvia]], [[Numitor]]'s daughter, to become a [[Vestal Virgin]], a priestess of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], so that she would never bear any sons that might overthrow him. However, she was raped or seduced by the god [[Mars (god)|Mars]], resulting in the birth of the twins. Rhea was thrown into prison and her sons ordered to be thrown into the river [[Tiber]]. The twins washed up onto dry land and were found by a [[she-wolf (Roman mythology)|she-wolf]] who suckled them. Later their mother was saved by the river god [[Tiberinus (god)|Tiberinus]] who ended up marrying her. Romulus and Remus went on to found [[Rome, Italy|Rome]] and overthrow Amulius, reinstating their grandfather [[Numitor]] as king of Alba Longa.

==Dionysius of Halicarnassus==

[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]] was a Greek historian and librarian who wrote in the first century BC.  He writes that Amulius' father, [[Proca|King Proca]], willed the throne to [[Numitor]] but Amulius deposed him.  For fear of a threat to his rule, the king had Numitor's son, Aegestus killed, blaming thieves.  The truth about the crime was known by some, including Numitor, who feigned ignorance.  Amulius then appointed Numitor's daughter to the [[Vestal virgins|Vestal priestesshood]], where her vow of chastity would prevent her from producing any further children.  Despite this, she became pregnant a few years later, claiming to have been raped.&lt;ref name="DoH I-76"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dionysius of Halicarnassus|accessdate=13 November 2016|title=Roman Antiquities vol I ch 76|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/dionysius_halicarnassus-roman_antiquities/1937/pb_LCL319.253.xml|doi=10.4159/DLCL.dionysius_halicarnassus-roman_antiquities.1937}} {{Subscription needed|via=[[Loeb Classical Library|digital Loeb Classical Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the sources, Amulius himself (in full armor to conceal his identity) commits the rape.&lt;ref name="DoH I-77"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dionysius of Halicarnassus|accessdate=13 November 2016|title=Roman Antiquities vol I ch 77|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/dionysius_halicarnassus-roman_antiquities/1937/pb_LCL319.257.xml|doi=10.4159/DLCL.dionysius_halicarnassus-roman_antiquities.1937}} {{Subscription needed|via=[[Loeb Classical Library|digital Loeb Classical Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ilia hid her pregnancy with claims of illness so as to avoid her vestal duties.  But Amulius was suspicious and employed physicians and his own wife to monitor her for signs of being with child.  When he discovered the truth, he placed her under armed guard.  After being informed of the delivery of Romulus and Remus, Amulius suspected that she had in fact given birth to triplets.  The third child having been concealed from the guards present.  Ilia was either put to death, or kept secretly in a hidden dungeon for the rest of her life.&lt;ref name="DoH I-78"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dionysius of Halicarnassus|accessdate=13 November 2016|title=Roman Antiquities vol I ch 78|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/dionysius_halicarnassus-roman_antiquities/1937/pb_LCL319.257.xml|doi=10.4159/DLCL.dionysius_halicarnassus-roman_antiquities.1937}} {{Subscription needed|via=[[Loeb Classical Library|digital Loeb Classical Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing [[Quintus Fabius Pictor|Fabius Pictor]], [[Lucius Cincius Alimentus|Cincius]], [[Cato the Elder|Cato]], and [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi (consul 133 BC)|Piso]], Dionysius writes that the king ordered the twins to be tossed into the Tiber.  When his servants arrived at the riverbank, high waters had made it impossible to reach the stream.  So they left the twin's basket in a pool of standing water on the site of the [[ficus Ruminalis]].  After the waters of the Tiber had carried the twins away, their basket was overturned by a rock and they were dumped into the mud.  It was there, that a she-wolf famously found them and [[Breastfeeding|nursed]] them in front of her lair (the ''[[Lupercal]]'').  Amulius' servant [[Faustulus]], happened upon the scene.  He took the boys home, and brought them up with his wife.  Later, quoting Fabius' account of the overthrow of Amulius, Plutarch claims that Faustulus had saved the basket in which the boys had been abandoned.&lt;ref name="DoH I-79"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dionysius of Halicarnassus|accessdate=13 November 2016|title=Roman Antiquities vol I ch 79|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/dionysius_halicarnassus-roman_antiquities/1937/pb_LCL319.269.xml|doi=10.4159/DLCL.dionysius_halicarnassus-roman_antiquities.1937}} {{Subscription needed|via=[[Loeb Classical Library|digital Loeb Classical Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fabius, when the twins were 18, they became embroiled in a violent dispute with some of Numitor's herdsmen.  In retaliation, Remus was lured into an ambush and captured while Romulus was elsewhere.&lt;ref name="DoH I-79"/&gt;  In [[Quintus Aelius Tubero|Aelius Tubero's]] version, the twins were taking part in the festivities of the [[Lupercalia]], requiring them to run naked through the village when Remus, defenseless as he was, was taken prisoner by Numitor's armed men.&lt;ref name="DoH I-80"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dionysius of Halicarnassus|accessdate=13 November 2016|title=Roman Antiquities vol I ch 80|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/dionysius_halicarnassus-roman_antiquities/1937/pb_LCL319.273.xml|doi=10.4159/DLCL.dionysius_halicarnassus-roman_antiquities.1937}} {{Subscription needed|via=[[Loeb Classical Library|digital Loeb Classical Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After rounding up the toughest herdsmen to help him free Remus, Romulus rashly set out for Alba Longa.  To avoid tragedy, Faustulus intercepted him and revealed the truth about the twins' parentage.  With the discovery that Numitor was family, Romulus sets his sights on Amulius instead.  He and the rest of his village set out in small groups toward the city so that their arrival would go unnoticed by the guards.  Meanwhile, after Amulius turned Remus over to Numitor to determine his punishment, Remus was told of his origins by the former king and eagerly joined with him in their own effort to topple Amulius.  When Romulus joined them, they began to plan their next move.&lt;ref name="DoH I-80"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DoH I-81"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dionysius of Halicarnassus|accessdate=13 November 2016|title=Roman Antiquities vol I ch 81-82|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/dionysius_halicarnassus-roman_antiquities/1937/pb_LCL319.277.xml|doi=10.4159/DLCL.dionysius_halicarnassus-roman_antiquities.1937}} {{Subscription needed|via=[[Loeb Classical Library|digital Loeb Classical Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faustulus is caught by the Alban guards trying to sneak the infant twins' basket into the city and is brought before Amulius by none-other-than the servant who had taken the boys to the river those many years before.  Amulius questions his man and insincerely claims he means the twins no harm.  Faustulus, trying to protect Romulus and Remus, and escape the king's clutches, claimed he had been bringing the basket to the imprisoned Ilia at the twins request and that they were at the moment tending their flocks in the mountains.

Amulius sent Faustulus and some of his men to find the boys.  He then tried to trick Numitor into coming to the palace so that the former king could be kept under guard until the situation had been dealt with.  Unfortunately for the king, when the man he sent to lure Numitor into his clutches arrived at the deposed king's house, he betrayed Amulius and revealed everything that had happened at the palace.&lt;ref name="DoH I-82-83"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dionysius of Halicarnassus|accessdate=13 November 2016|title=Roman Antiquities vol I ch 82-83|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/dionysius_halicarnassus-roman_antiquities/1937/pb_LCL319.283.xml|doi=10.4159/DLCL.dionysius_halicarnassus-roman_antiquities.1937}} {{Subscription needed|via=[[Loeb Classical Library|digital Loeb Classical Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The twins and their grandfather led their joint supporters to the palace, killed Amulius, and took control of the city.&lt;ref name="DoH I-83"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dionysius of Halicarnassus|accessdate=13 November 2016|title=Roman Antiquities vol I ch 83|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/dionysius_halicarnassus-roman_antiquities/1937/pb_LCL319.287.xml|doi=10.4159/DLCL.dionysius_halicarnassus-roman_antiquities.1937}} {{Subscription needed|via=[[Loeb Classical Library|digital Loeb Classical Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4847">'''Aql bi'l fil''' ({{lang|ar|عقل بالفعل}}) is a kind of [[intellect]] in the [[Islamic philosophy]]. This level deals with readiness of soul for acquiring the forms without receiving them again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eshia.ir/feqh/archive/text/heshmatpour/shavareq/92/930214/|title=مدرسه فقاهت|work=eshia.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==
[[Al Kindi]] also pointed out to a kind of intellect could reach from the state of potentiality, to the state of actuality.&lt;ref name="Shṿarts2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shṿarts|first=Dov|title=Central Problems of Medieval Jewish Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sqmMqbZwTXEC&amp;pg=PA63|year=2005|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-14805-1|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Farabi]] pointed out the first level of actualization of intellect is the potential intellect. the second stage is to Aql bi'l fil or actual intellect.

'''''Arjunawiwāha''''' was the first ''[[kakawin]]'' appeared in the [[East Java]]n period of the Javanese classical Hindu-Buddhist era in the 11th-century. Arjunawiwaha was composed by Mpu [[Kanwa]] during the reign of King [[Airlangga]], king of the [[Kahuripan]] Kingdom, circa 1019 to 1042 CE. Arjunawiwaha is estimated to be finished in 1030.

The Kakawin tells the story of [[Arjuna]] when he was engaged in meditation and performing a severe practice of [[asceticism]] on [[Mount Meru]]. During his meditation he was tested by the Gods by sending two of the most beautiful [[apsara]]s — [[Supraba]] and [[Tilottama]] — to seduce him. Arjuna was not budging and firmly continued his meditation despite of the apsara's seduction. Then the god [[Indra]] descented to earth disguising as an old [[Brahmin]]. They discussed about religious matters and Arjuna succeeded to answer Indra's questions, then he revealed his true identity and went back to svargaloka. Suddenly, a wild [[boar]] came raging, then Arjuna shot it with an arrow. But at the same time, an old hunter appeared that claimed that he also shot the boar, Arjuna and the old hunter were quarrelling about who killed the boar. As it turns out that the hunter is actually the god [[Shiva]]. Arjuna is given the task to kill [[Niwatakawaca]], an [[asura]] that disturbed the peace and order of [[svarga]]loka. To do this task, the gods give Arjuna powerful weapons. Arjuna was eventually successful in his task to kill Niwatakawaca, and as the reward the Gods awarded Arjuna seven apsaras to mary and he allowed to enjoy the pleasure of svargaloka for a while.

The bas-reliefs of Arjunawiwaha were carved on East Javanese [[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]s (temples), such as Candi Kedaton in [[Probolinggo Regency]], [[Surawana|Candi Surawana]] near Kediri, and [[Candi Jago]] near Malang.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2296">'''Barzabod''', was the [[Mihranids|Mihranid]] prince of [[Gardman]] from c. 430 to 440. He was the son and successor of [[Khurs of Gardman|Khurs]]. 

According to the [[Georgian Chronicles|Georgian chronicler]] [[Juansheriani|Juansher]], Barzabod married off her daughter [[Sagdukht]] to his [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberian]] neighbor, [[Mihrdat V of Iberia|Mihrdat V]], then heir apparent to King [[Archil of Iberia]], and eventually king in his own right. The marriage helped to seal peace between the once hostile neighbors. After Mihrdat's death c. 535, Sagdukht relied on her father for support during her regency for her underage son, [[Vakhtang I of Iberia]].    

Barzabod died around 440, and was succeeded by his son [[Varaz-Bakur]].

The '''Bishopric of Ösel–Wiek''' ({{lang-et|Saare-Lääne piiskopkond}}; {{lang-de|Bistum Ösel–Wiek}}; [[Low German]]: ''Bisdom Ösel–Wiek''; contemporary {{lang-la|Ecclesia Osiliensis}}) was a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] diocese and semi-independent [[prince-bishop]]ric (parto of [[Terra Mariana]], i.e. [[Livonia]]) in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], covering what are now [[Saare County|Saare]], [[Hiiu County|Hiiu]] and [[Lääne County|Lääne]] counties of [[Estonia]].

== History ==
[[File:Haapsalu linnuse varemed2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Haapsalu Episcopal Castle.|[[Haapsalu Castle|Haapsalu Episcopal Castle.]]]]
The bishopric was created on 1 October 1228 as a [[Latin rite]] (initially exempt?) diocese by [[papal legate]] [[William of Modena]] and simultaneously as a state of [[Holy Roman Empire]]—making it a [[prince-bishopric]]—by [[Henry (VII) of Germany|Henry]], [[King of the Romans]] (1220-1242; not Emperor). Due to the repeated shift of the seat of the bishops, it was also successively known as bishopric of [[Lihula|Leal (Lihula)]] from 1234, [[Vana-Pärnu|Perona (Vana-Pärnu)]] from 1251, [[Haapsalu Castle|Hapsal (Haapsalu) Castle]] from 1279, and the seat shifted (alone) to the castle of [[Kuressaare|Arensburg (Kuressaare)]] on the island of [[Saaremaa|Ösel (Saaremaa)]]; the [[cathedral]] and [[cathedral chapter]] (canons) remained in Hapsal. It was a [[suffragan diocese]] in the [[ecclesiastical province]] of the Metropolitan [[Archbishopric of Riga]] from 1253.

One of the five members of the [[Livonian Confederation]], the state was administratively divided into two [[bailiwick]]s (Latin ''advocaciae'', German ''Vogteien''). The bishop was also the lord of the [[Teutonic Order]] over its fiefs on the bishopric's territory. From 1241 until 1343, Ösel (Saaremaa) Island was an autonomous part of Ösel-Wiek prince-bishopric (autonomy renewed 27 August 1255).

The principality ceased to exist in 1560 when its last [[prince-bishop]], Johannes V von Münchhausen, sold it to [[Denmark]], which vested executive power in royally appointed Governors (styled Lensmaend to 1654, then Statthalter). King [[Frederick II of Denmark]]'s brother [[Magnus of Livonia]], Duke of [[Holstein]], obtained it as an [[appanage]] on 15 April 1560 and was elected bishop on 13 May 1560; the Danish dynasty being [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], he abolished the diocese and assumed the secular feudal style Lord of Ösel (''Stieffte Ozel und Wieck Herr'') on 20 March 1567.

Denmark ceded Wiek ([[Lääne County]]) to the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in exchange for parts of Ösel belonging to the [[Livonian Order]]. Later Ösel became a [[Danish Estonia|Danish possession]].

'''British Muslim TV''' is a UK-based, [[free-to-air]], English language, [[Islam]]ic-focused [[Satellite television|satellite]] [[television channel]] funded by advertising and donations.

==Premise==
British Muslim TV was conceptualised towards the end of 2013 and underwent planning from the start of 2014, having quickly established substantial "pre-sold advertising" to make the concept into a reality, according to Wasim Akhtar, Director of Marketing and Communications. Other members of the senior leadership team include Aamer Naeem, the Editor in Chief, Arshad Ashraf, Director and Danny Lacey, Creative Director of the channel.&lt;ref name="alarabiya"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pathan|first=Nabila|url=http://www.english.alarabiya.net/en/life-style/entertainment/2014/06/06/Confidently-Muslim-comfortably-British-possible-New-TV-channel-thinks-so.html|title=New TV channel launches for 'comfortably British' Muslims|publisher=Al Arabiya News|date=6 June 2014|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="onislam"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.onislam.net/english/news/europe/473473-british-muslims-get-new-tv-channel.html|title=British Muslims Get New TV Channel|publisher=Biz Asia|date=7 June 2014|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="islamtelegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last=Khan|first=Ahmed|url=http://www.islamtelegraph.com/tv-channel-for-british-muslim-set-for-launch/|title=TV channel for british muslim set for launch|work=Islam Telegraph|date=8 June 2014|accessdate=1 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910034255/http://islamtelegraph.com/tv-channel-for-british-muslim-set-for-launch/|archivedate=10 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="saudigazette"&gt;{{cite news|last=Patan|first=Nabila|url=http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentid=20140608207770|title=New TV channel for 'comfortably British' Muslims set for launch|location=Saudi Arabia|work=[[Saudi Gazette]]|date=8 June 2014|accessdate=1 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101034925/http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentid=20140608207770|archivedate=1 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main funders are Adeem Younis the founder of [[SingleMuslim.com]] and his charity Penny Appeal.&lt;ref name="5pillarz"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.5pillarz.com/2014/06/06/british-muslim-tv-due-to-launch-on-sky-this-month/|title=British Muslim TV due to launch on Sky this month|publisher=5Pillarz|date=6 June 2014|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon launching the channel Wasim Akhtar, explained that British Muslim TV aims to be different from the other Muslim based channels in the UK by being: "inclusive of all different views and open to all different types of Muslims. So the channel isn’t just about issues of faith, it's about practical Muslim life here in Britain." He added: "We're really passionate about bringing content that's relative to the generations of today, so we made sure that our programming isn't solely made up from presenters or content from overseas. As a result, we feel we will provide both Muslim and non-Muslim communities with news, views and insights into how [[British Muslim]]s live today."&lt;ref name="alarabiya"/&gt;&lt;ref name="onislam"/&gt;

==Content==
In June 2014, British Muslim TV was launched on the [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky Digital]] platform. It is aimed at showcasing the best the British Muslim community has to offer. It states, "A new Sky channel that provides both Muslim and non-Muslim communities with news, views and insights into how British Muslims live. We will also present content from our community, for our community, with the aim to make British Muslims feel confidently Muslim and comfortably British."&lt;ref name="media247"&gt;{{cite news |last=Baddhan|first=Raj|url=http://www.media247.co.uk/bizasia/british-muslim-tv-to-launch-in-june-on-sky-digital|title=British Muslim TV due to launch on Sky this month|publisher=Biz Asia|date=17 May 2014|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel added, "Viewers will be treated to a range of engaging, entertaining and educational content, aimed at showcasing the best that our British Muslim community has to offer."&lt;ref name="moroccoworldnews"&gt;{{cite news |last=Arbaoui|first=Larbi|url=http://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2014/06/132345/british-muslim-tv-to-launch-in-june/|title=British Muslims Get New TV Channel|location=Morocco|publisher=Morocco World News|date=10 June 2014|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme content has been exclusively funded and made in the UK.&lt;ref name="alarabiya"/&gt;&lt;ref name="saudigazette"/&gt;

The channel has a line-up of programs that include entertainment and educational formats such as ''Teenie Vision'' for younger audiences, lifestyle shows like ''Halal Kitchen'' and political/current affairs based programs. [[Lauren Booth]], a British journalist and sister-in-law of former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], will be hosting her own show called ''Talking Booth'', a one-to-one interview show featuring high profile guests.&lt;ref name="alarabiya"/&gt; The other shows broadcast include ''Marriage Made in Britain'', ''Talking Booth'', ''Halal Kitchen'' and ''British Muslim Teen Vision''.&lt;ref name="media247"/&gt;

In 2016, they financed the production of British romantic comedy film ''[[Finding Fatimah]]'', which will be released in UK cinemas in April 2017.&lt;ref name="findingfatimah"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.findingfatimah.com/|title=Finding Fatimah official website|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Buddhism''' is a small minority [[Religion in Bulgaria|religion]] in [[Bulgaria]], with about a thousand practitioners.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The [[Vietnamese people in Bulgaria|Vietnamese community]] in Bulgaria traditionally practices [[Mahayana Buddhism]] alongside [[Ancestor Worship]], but the population of this community, which mostly hails from [[North Vietnam]], has declined from tens of thousands before 1990 to around 1,000 now.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Some Buddhist believers in Bulgaria are of [[Han Chinese|Chinese descent]]. A small number of native Bulgarians are converts to [[Theravada]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

There is an officially recognised Bulgarian Buddhist [[Karma Kagyu]] organization, which is a part of [[Diamond Way Buddhism]] led by [[Karmapa]] [[Trinley Thaye Dorje]]. They have several centers spread over the country.

[[Shechen]] has a mountain retreat center not far away from [[Sofia]]; access is granted to members, and it is not generally open to the public.

'''Chalchitra''' (বাংলা- [[:bn:চালচিত্র|চালচিত্র]]) is a part of ''Bengal Patachitra''. It referred to the ''Debi Chal'' or  ''Durga chala'', the background of the [[Durga]] Pratima or idol. Originally, these were used to give a proper proportion to the structure. This tradition is very ancient and is still maintained.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paschimbanger lokoshilpa o lokosamaj|last=tarapada santra|first=|publisher=Kolkata: lokosanskriti o adibasi sanskriti kendra|year=2000|isbn=|location=Kolkata|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/art-and-culture/durga-puja-chalchitra-patachitra-traditional-backdrop-fading-art-form-5400664/lite/|title=Chalchitra &amp; Patachitra – the fading art forms which form the backdrop of Durga Puja|date=2018-10-13|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of the name==
''Chalchitra'' is a [[Bengali language|Bengali]] word where ''Chal'' means covering. It is drawn in Pratima Chala. So, it is called Chalchitra. [[Patua]], the artists of Chalchitra called it as '''Pata Lekha''', means the writing of [[Pattachitra|Patachitra]].&lt;ref&gt;Giusti, M. and Chakraborty, U. (ed.). ''Immagini Storie Parole.

According to the shape of the Chali, the structure of [[Durga]] Pratima it has some varieties like Bangla chali, Mothchouri Chali, Tanachauri Chali, Sorbosundori chali, Khep chali, Markini Chali etc. Among them, the commonly seen Chali is the Markini Chali.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.anandabazar.com/archive/1121013/13kol-pujo8.html|title=আনন্দবাজার পত্রিকা - কলকাতার আরও খবর|website=archives.anandabazar.com|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bangla chali follows the tradition of temple architecture.

==Theme and style==
[[File:Barisha Nabin Sangha 1 Arnab Dutta 2011.jpg|thumb|Sabeki Durga idol with Chalchitra]]
The main content of the chalchitra is Shib-Parboti, Kail, Shib attending Nandi-Vringi, Mahish-mardini, Dashabatar etc. Such a special Patachitra is seen in Durga Pot in the ''Hatsarandi Sutradhar society'' of [[Birbhum district]], which is called '''''Durga Pot'''''. However, instead of Durga idol, it was worshiped in '''''Durga Pot'''''.&lt;ref&gt;Patua Sanskriti: Parapara O Poribartan by Dr. Dipak Kumar Bara Panda, ph.D., Pustaka Bipani, Kolkata, August, 1999, pg: 87&lt;/ref&gt; Durga Pot has a semi-circular Patachitra where Patachitra of Durga is in the middle position. Ram, Sita, Shib, Nandi-Vringi, Brahma, Vishnu, Shumbha-Nishumbha are painted on this kind of Chalchitra. [[Krishnanagar, Nadia|Krishnanager]] Rajrajeshwari Durga is seen to be uniquely noticed. In the middle of the Chalchitra, there is Panchanan Shib and Parvati is beside him, on one side there is Dasha-mahabidya and the other side, there is [[Dashavatara|Dashabatar]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.anandabazar.com/state/%E0%A6%85%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%95-%E0%A6%B7%E0%A7%9F-%E0%A6%86%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%85%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%B2-%E0%A6%AA-%E0%A6%A4-%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%AE-%E0%A6%9D-%E0%A6%AC-%E0%A6%B2-%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%9A-%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%9A-%E0%A6%A4-%E0%A6%B0-1.74260|title=অবক্ষয় আর অবলুপ্তির মাঝে বাংলার চালচিত্র - Anandabazar|last=ভট্টাচার্য|first=বিভূতিসুন্দর|work=anandabazar.com|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antiquity==
[[File:নৃত্য কালী.jpg|thumb|Nrityo Kali Mata with Chalchitra in [[Shakta Rash]]]]
Two of the most famous forms of idol making in Bengal are [[Bishnupur, Bankura|Bishnupur]] style and Kansanarayan style. Among them, Kangshonarayan style is most popular. At the time of Kangshonarayan, the Chalchitra is true ingridin of Durga Pratima.

300–400 years old idols of [[Shakta Rash|Nabadwip Shakta Rash]] used Chalchitra as a part of Pratima. At a time, the use of Chalchitra became fade, but now it has a great popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.anandabazar.com/district/nadia-murshidabad/portrait-art-s-demand-at-nabadwip-1.700221|title=পটচিত্রের চাহিদা বাড়ছে নবদ্বীপের রাসে|last=বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায়|first=দেবাশিস|work=anandabazar.com|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chalchitra artist of [[Nabadwip]], Tapan Bhattacharya said-
{{cquote|It's good to see a lost painting coming back around.|Tapan Bhattacharya}}

==Tradition==
Rajrajeshwari Durga Pratima of [[Krishnanagar, Nadia|Krishnanager]] Rajbari uses a unique Chalchitra. Baishnavadas Mallik of [[Kolkata|Kolkata's]] Darpanarayan Tagore Street and the tradition of writing pot in the Bose family of Ramkrishnapur is still fine. Bimanbihari Sheel of Ramchan family in Chorabagan, north Kolkata said&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;-
{{Cquote|Āgē cālitē paṭa lēkhā halē'ō bhāla cālacitra śilpī saṅkhyāẏa kamē yā'ōẏāẏa ēkhana dēbīra cālacitrē byabahāra karā haẏa hātē ām̐kā cālacitra|Bimanbihari Sheel}}

Krishnanagar's Chalchitra artist Biswanath Pal wrote pot in various Banedi families of Kolkata. He said-
{{Cquote|Banadi family still enjoy hand painted pot. Before Pujo, there are many places to write pots in Khidirpur and north Kolkata.|Biswanath Pal}}

==Technique==
On the upper surface of the idol, a half-domed [[bamboo]] structure was strapped on it, and the width of the cloth was wrapped in a width of thick cloth and the back part of the cloth was folded behind the [[bamboo]] structure. When the [[clay]]ed cloth dried up, it was given a few layers of Chalk Dust. After that, the planned storyline is drawn on it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Colour===
Natural color is used in color, which is one of the characteristics of the Bengal Patachitra. In general, blue, [[yellow]], [[green]], [[red]], [[brown]], [[black]] and [[white]] are used in the Chalchitra. Indeed, the painting illustration has been imitated by the Patachitra of [[Bengal]]. Chalk dust is used for white color, pauri for yellow color, cultivated indigo for blue,bhushakali for black and mete sindur for red color in chalchitra.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Charles Debrille Poston''' (April 20, 1825&amp;nbsp;– June 24, 1902) was an American [[explorer]], [[Prospecting|prospector]], author, politician, and [[Civil service|civil servant]].  He is referred to as the "Father of Arizona" due to his efforts lobbying for creation of the territory.  Poston was also [[Arizona Territory]]'s first Delegate to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]].

==Background==

Poston was born near [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky]] to Temple and Judith Debrille Poston.  His father was a printer and he served as a [[printer's devil]].{{sfn|Goff|1985|p=17}}  Poston was orphaned at the age of twelve, and was [[Apprenticeship|apprenticed]] to the local [[county clerk]], Samuel Haycraft.{{sfn|Goff|1985|p=17}}{{sfn|Sacks|1963|p=34}}  Following his apprenticeship, he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] where he clerked for the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] while [[reading law]].&lt;ref name=ARobit&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84020558/1902-06-25/ed-1/seq-1/#words=POSTON&amp;proxtext=poston|title=Col. C. D. Poston Died Suddenly|date=June 25, 1902|work=Arizona Republican|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poston married Haycraft's daughter, Margaret, in September 1848 and the couple had a daughter, Sarah Lee Poston, who reached adulthood.  Margaret Poston became paralyzed on February 12, 1851, possibly from a stroke while giving birth to a second child,  and was cared for by relatives until her death from cancer on February 26, 1884.{{sfn|Goff|1985|p=17}}{{sfn|Dillon|1999|pp=735-6}}  On July 27, 1885, Poston married former newspaper typesetter Martha "Mattie" Tucker.  The couple separated shortly afterwards, but there is no evidence they ever divorced.{{sfn|Goff|1985|p=26}}

==Early exploration and mining efforts==

Poston traveled to [[California]] as part of the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] and took a clerk position at the [[San Francisco]] [[Customs House]] in February 1851.  Poston was demoted in 1853 and complained that his replacement was a professional gambler and political appointee.{{sfn|Sacks|1963|p=34}}  While at this 
job, he became involved with a group of French bankers interested in the lands of the recently negotiated [[Gadsden Purchase]].{{sfn|Goff|1985|p=18}}  In late 1853, with the bankers' backing, Poston joined with [[Mining engineering|mining engineer]] [[Herman Ehrenberg]] to organize an expedition into the territory Mexico was expected to sell to the United States.  Taking a ship from San Francisco, the two became shipwrecked near the [[Mexico|Mexican]] port of [[Guaymas]].  They were then detained temporarily by Mexican authorities as suspected [[Filibuster (military)|filibusters]] before heading north to the Gadsden territory.  The expedition visited [[San Xavier del Bac]] and [[Ajo, Arizona|Ajo]], collecting mineral samples along the way, before traveling down the [[Gila River]].{{sfn|Goff|1985|p=18}}{{sfn|Trimble|1977|p=213}}  At [[Fort Yuma]], a U.S. Army post near the confluence of the Gila and [[Colorado River]], Poston first met the fort's commander Major [[Samuel P. Heintzelman]].{{sfn|Dillon|1999|pp=735-6}}  While at Fort Yuma Poston surveyed a townsite on the south side of the river a mile below the fort, at [[Jaeger's Ferry]].  Poston sold the townsite called [[Colorado City (Yuma County, Arizona)|Colorado City]] for $20,000 when he returned to San Francisco.{{sfn|Lingenfelter|1978|p=15}}

[[File:Fort Cerro in Arizona.jpg|250px|left|thumb|''The mining town and fort of Cerro Colorado, established by Poston and Major Heintzelmen.'']]
After returning to San Francisco, Poston left for the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] in search of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] to fund a mining operation in the newly acquired territory.  After several unsuccessful attempts, he was introduced to several [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] investors by Heintzelman.  On March 24, 1856, [[US$]]2&amp;nbsp;million was secured to found the Sonora Exploring and Mining Company with Heintzelman as company president and Poston as managing supervisor.{{sfn|Dillon|1999|pp=735-6}}{{sfn|Goff|1985|p=19}}  The company set up headquarters in [[Tubac, Arizona]] and began mining operations in the nearby [[Santa Rita Mountains]] and elsewhere. Poston served as [[alcalde]] of the settlement and became known as "Colonel" Poston in the town of roughly 800 people.  Using the authority granted to him by the government of New Mexico Territory, he printed his own money and officiated over marriages, divorces, and the baptisms of children.{{sfn|Trimble|1977|p=215}}  This continued until Father Macheboeuf, the [[vicar]] of Bishop [[Jean-Baptiste Lamy]], was sent from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] to investigate the goings-on in Tubac. The validity of the marriages Poston had performed was questioned by the vicar, and a US$700 donation made before Father Macheboeuf sanctified the unions.{{sfn|Powell|1976|p=42}}  Charles Poston's brother, John, was murdered by Mexican outlaws at [[Cerro Colorado, Arizona|Cerro Colorado]] in southern Arizona, the town was established by Charles Poston.{{sfn|Sherman|Sherman|1969|p=23}}

Mining operations produced US $3000 per day in silver until 1861.  With the withdrawal of Union troops due to the [[American Civil War]], Tubac saw an increase in hostilities from local [[Apache]]s and the settlement had to be abandoned.{{sfn|Trimble|1977|p=216}}

==Arizona Territory==
[[File:John Poston's grave.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''John Poston's grave, the brother of Charles Poston who was murdered by Mexican outlaws at Cerro Colorado, Arizona in 1861.'']]
After being forced to leave Tubac due to the Apache [[Siege of Tubac|siege]], Poston went to [[Washington D.C.]] and worked for General Heintzelman as a civilian aide.  During this time Heintzelman introduced him to President [[Abraham Lincoln]].{{sfn|Dillon|1999|pp=735-6}}  Poston in turn used this time to lobby both Lincoln and Congress for creation of an Arizona Territory, advertising the benefits of the area's mineral wealth to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cause.  Toward the end of the process Poston attended an oyster dinner where the [[Slate (elections)|slate]] of territorial positions was divided among [[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] congressmen and Poston was selected as an Indian Agent for the new territory.{{sfn|Goff|1985|p=15}}

Poston commissioned [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]] to create a US$1500 [[inkwell]] from Arizona silver 
and presented the inkwell to Lincoln upon signing of the [[Arizona Organic Act]].  On 12 March 1863 Poston was appointed superintendent of Indian affairs.{{sfn|Powell|1976|pp=43-4}}  This appointment was followed by his election as Delegate to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on 18 July 1864.{{sfn|Goff|1985|p=21}}  During his term of service, Poston submitted bills aimed at settling private land claims and to establish [[Indian reservation]]s along the Colorado river.{{sfn|Dillon|1999|pp=735-6}}  In 1865, Poston chose not to return to Arizona during his run for reelection, and was defeated by [[John Noble Goodwin]].{{sfn|Powell|1976|p=46}}  A final run for election to the territorial delegate position failed in 1866.{{sfn|Goff|1985|p=24}}

==Writing==
After losing his position in Congress, Poston opened a law office in Washington D.C.
In 1867 he traveled to Europe, spending time in both [[London]] and [[Paris]].  He then returned to Washington and in 1868 published a travel book, ''Europe in the Summer-Time''.  This was followed by [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] commissioning Poston to deliver the [[Burlingame Treaty]] to the [[Emperor of China]] and to study irrigation and immigration in Asia. After China, Poston continued to India where he developed a fascination with the [[Parsi people]] and [[Zoroastrianism]].  He reached Egypt by early 1869 and was in Paris by April of that year. After living a year in Paris he moved to London where he spent the next six years.  During this time he worked as an editor of a London newspaper, [[Foreign correspondent (journalism)|foreign correspondent]] to the ''New York Tribune'', and as a "counselor-at-law".{{sfn|Goff|1985|p=24}}  Poston also wrote several books during this time, publishing ''The Parsees'' in 1872, ''The Sun Worshippers of Asia'' in 1877, and his poem ''Apache Land'' in 1878.{{sfn|Goff|1985|p=25}}
His work, ''Building a State in Apache Land'' was published in installments by ''Overland Monthly'' between July and October 1894.{{sfn|Dillon|1999|pp=735-6}}

==Later life==
[[File:Older Charles D. Poston.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Poston in his later years]]
Poston returned to the United States in time for the [[Centennial Exposition]] in [[Philadelphia]].  Through his acquaintance with [[John Bigelow]], he then became a campaign worker for [[Samuel J. Tilden]] during the [[U.S. presidential election of 1876]].  Poston expected a [[Consul (representative)|consul]] position in London if Tilden had won the election, but instead was made register of the United States land office at [[Florence, Arizona]] from July 1877 till June 1879.{{sfn|Goff|1985|p=25}}  During his time in Florence he became interested in building a Parsi [[fire temple]] on a nearby hill, paying for construction of a road to the summit.{{sfn|Goff|1985|pp=25-6}}  The temple itself was decorated with a blue and white flag depicting a red sun and built upon the ruins of an older Indian structure.&lt;ref name="Stanley"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/travel/local/history/2014/03/25/arizona-father-charles-poston/6870811/|title=Arizona Explained: Charles Poston was an eccentric|last=Stanley|first=John|date=March 25, 2014|work=Arizona Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Construction ended when Poston ran out of funds.&lt;ref name="Barney"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=897&amp;dat=19510719&amp;id=_4xaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ElADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6562,1749128|title=Last Days of Charles Poston, State Pioneer|last=Barney|first=James M.|date=July 19, 1951|work=Prescott Evening Courier|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He attempted to raise additional money, even writing to the [[Shah of Iran]], but his efforts failed and the temple's eternal flame failed shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="Stanley"/&gt;  This unusual interest led to Poston being criticized as a crank and eccentric.{{sfn|Dillon|1999|pp=735-6}}

Following his time in Florence he moved to [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] and supported himself with a variety of positions including lecturer, mining and railroad promoter, and writer.{{sfn|Goff|1985|p=26}}  In 1884 he became a consular agent in [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]] followed by an assignment as a civilian military agent in [[El Paso, Texas]] in 1887 and as employee of [[U.S. Geological Survey]] in 1889.{{sfn|Dillon|1999|pp=735-6}}{{sfn|Goff|1985|p=27}}

[[File:PostonButte-inscription.jpg|thumb|Inscription on the tomb of Charles D. Poston on Poston Butte in Florence, AZ.]]
Poston declined into obscurity until 1897 when [[Whitelaw Reid]] published an account detailing Poston's situation.  As a result, the Arizona Territorial legislature awarded Poston a pension of US$25/month in 1899 and increased this to US$35/month in 1901.{{sfn|Goff|1985|p=29}}  Poston died from apparent heart failure on June 24, 1902 in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix, Arizona Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1902-06-25/ed-1/seq-9/#words=Poston&amp;proxtext=poston|title=Father of Arizona Passes to the Beyond|date=June 25, 1902|work=The San Francisco Call|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his previously stated wish to be buried at the summit of [[Poston Butte|Primrose Hill]], Poston was initially buried in a [[pauper's grave]] in Phoenix.&lt;ref name="Barney"/&gt;  His remains were removed from Phoenix and moved to [[Florence, Arizona]], on the 100th anniversary of his birth, and buried on Primrose Hill, renamed, Poston Butte where he had never completed his "Temple to the Sun".  He was entombed in an official ceremony led by Governor [[George W. P. Hunt]].{{sfn|youtuber|1976|p=49}}

==Television depictions==

Poston was portrayed in the 1965 episode "A City Is Born" by later [[governor of California|Governor]] and [[U.S. President]] [[Ronald W. Reagan]] on the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] television series ''[[Death Valley Days]]''. In the story line, Poston is a mining developer and surveyor engaged in a race against time to reach [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], California, for an important meeting with bankers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0556535/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_01|title=A City Is Born|date=October 22, 1965|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=May 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another ''Death Valley Days'' segment in 1966, [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]], Reagan's successor as the series host, played Poston in the episode "The Day All Marriages Were Cancelled". The story stemmed from a dispute between Poston and the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] bishop, who questioned how Poston through his role as [[alcalde]] could perform secular marriages at no costs to the couples involved in the absence of available priests. During a civil trial, the church relents, and the marriages were declared legal once again. Willard Sage played the role of Father McCabe in this episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0556774/?ref_=tt_ep_pr|title="The Day All Marriages Were Cancelled" on ''Death Valley Days''|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chinese temple architecture''' refer to a type of structures used as place of worship of Chinese Buddhism, Taoism or [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese folk religion/Shenism]], where people revere ethnic Chinese gods and ancestors. They can be classified as:
* ''miào'' (庙) or ''diàn'' (殿), simply meaning "temple" and mostly enshrining [[Chinese gods and immortals|gods of the Chinese pantheon]], such as [[Dragon King]], [[Tudigong]] or [[Mazu]]; or mythical or historical figures, such as [[Guandi]] or [[Shennong]]. 
* ''cí'' (祠), ''cítáng'' (祠堂), ''zōngcí'' (宗祠) or ''zǔmiào'' (祖庙), referring to [[ancestral temples]], mostly enshrining the ancestral gods of a family or clan.
* [[Taoist temple]]s and [[monastery|monasteries]]: 觀/观 ''guàn'' or 道观 ''dàoguàn''; and
* [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhist]] temples and monasteries: 寺 ''sì'' or 寺院 ''sìyuàn''
* [[Temple of Confucius]] which usually functions as both temple and town school: 文廟 ''wénmiào'' or 孔廟 ''kŏngmiào''. 
* Temples of [[City God]], which worships the patron God of a village, town or a city. 
* Smaller household shrines or votive niche, such as the worship of [[Zaoshen]] and [[Caishen]]. 

''Gōng'' (宫), meaning "[[palace]]" is a term used for a templar complex of multiple buildings, while ''yuàn'' (院) is a generic term meaning "[[sanctuary]]" or "[[shrine]]".

==Overview==
Shen temples are distinct from [[Taoist temple]]s in that they are established and administered by local [[management|managers]], village communities, lineage congregations and worship associations, and don't have professional [[priest]]s, although [[Taoist priest]]s, ''[[fashi]]'', [[Confucian]] ''lisheng'', and also ''[[wu (shaman)|wu]]'' and ''[[tongji (spirit medium)|tongji]]'' shamans, may perform services within these temples. Shenist temples are usually small and decorated with traditional figures on their roofs (dragons and deities), although some evolve into significant structures.

Chinese temples can be found throughout [[Mainland China]], [[Taiwan]] and also where [[Chinese emigration|Chinese expatriate]] communities settled over centuries. An old name in English for Chinese traditional temples is "joss house".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Diary of a journey overland, through the Maritime Provinces of China from Manchao, on the south coast of Hainan, to Canton in the years 1819 and 1820|last=R.|first=J (Supercargo)|publisher=Sir Richard Philips &amp; Co.|date=1822}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Joss" is an Anglicized spelling of the Portuguese word for "god", ''deus''. "Joss house" was in common use in English in western North America during frontier times, when joss houses were a common feature of [[Chinatown]]s. The name "joss house" describes the environment of worship. [[Joss stick]]s, a kind of [[incense]], are burned inside and outside of the house.

{{Jehovah's Witnesses}}

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] have received criticism from mainstream [[Christianity]], members of the medical community, former members, and commentators regarding [[Jehovah's Witnesses beliefs|their beliefs]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses practices|practices]]. The movement has been accused of doctrinal inconsistency and reversals, failed predictions, mistranslation of the Bible, harsh treatment of former members and autocratic and coercive leadership. Criticism has also focused on their rejection of [[blood transfusions]], particularly in life-threatening medical situations, and claims that they have failed to report cases of [[sexual abuse]] to the authorities. Many of the claims are denied by Jehovah's Witnesses and some have also been disputed by courts and religious scholars.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Failed predictions===
{{Main|Watch Tower Society unfulfilled predictions}}
{{See also|Eschatology of Jehovah's Witnesses}}
The beliefs unique to Jehovah's Witnesses involve their interpretations of the [[second coming]] of Christ, the [[Millenarianism|millennium]] and the [[kingdom of God]]. [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Society]] publications have made, and continue to make, predictions about world events they believe were prophesied in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Crompton | first = Robert | title = Counting the Days to Armageddon | publisher = James Clarke &amp; Co | year = 1996 | location = Cambridge | pages = 9, 115 | ISBN = 0-227-67939-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those early predictions were described as "established truth",&lt;ref&gt;''The Time is at Hand'', Watch Tower Society, 1889, pages 99: "In view of this strong Bible evidence concerning the Times of the Gentiles, we consider it an established truth, that the final end of the kingdoms of this world, and the full establishment of the kingdom of God will be accomplished by A.D. 1914."; cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 193.&lt;/ref&gt; and 'beyond a doubt'.&lt;ref&gt;In 1892 ''Zion's Watch Tower'' stated that God's battle, Armageddon, which was believed to be already under way, would end in October 1914, a date "definitely marked in Scripture" (15 January 1892, page 1355 reprint), and ''Watch Tower'' editor Charles Taze Russell declared: 
: "We see no reason for changing the figures—nor could we change them if we would. They are, we believe, God's dates, not ours." (''The Watchtower'', 15 July 1894, page 1677).
After comparing "unreliable secular chronology" to reliable "Bible chronology", ''The Watchtower'' stated,
: “It was on this line of reckoning [using the chronology of the Bible as an established fact] that the dates 1874, 1914, and 1918 were located; and the Lord has placed the stamp of his seal upon 1914 and 1918 beyond any possibility of erasure....Using this same measuring line, beginning with the entry...of Israel into Canaan, and counting the full 70 cycles...,as clearly indicated by Jehovah's sending of the Jews into Babylon for the full 70 years, it is an easy matter to locate 1925, probably the fall, for the beginning of the antitypical jubilee. There can be no more question about 1925 than there was about 1914.... Looking back we can now easily see that those dates were clearly indicated in Scripture and doubtless intended by the Lord to encourage his people....That all that some expect to see in 1925 may not transpire that year will not alter the date one whit more than in the other cases.” (''The Watch Tower'', May 15, 1922, p. 150; Raymond Franz, Crisis of Conscience, page 224).&lt;/ref&gt;
Witnesses are told to 'be complete in accepting the visible organization's direction in every aspect' and that there is no need to question what God tells them through his Word and organization since love "believes all things."&lt;ref name="FollowingFaithful"&gt;"Following Faithful Shepherds with Life in View", ''The Watchtower'', October 1, 1967, page 591, "Make haste to identify the visible theocratic organization of God that represents his king, Jesus Christ. It is essential for life. Doing so, be complete in accepting its every aspect. We cannot claim to love God, yet deny his Word and channel of communication....Jehovah's visible organization is based firmly on the twelvefold foundation of the apostles of the Lamb with Jesus Christ himself being the foundation cornerstone.(Rev. 21:14,19;Eph 2:20-22) Therefore, in submitting to Jehovah's visible theocratic organization, we must be in full and complete agreement with every feature of its apostolic procedure and requirements."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |magazine= The Watchtower |date=15 July 1974 |page =441 |title= The Godly Qualities of Love and Hate |quote= Christians have implicit trust in their heavenly Father; they do not question what he tells them through his written Word and organization.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raymond Franz 2007, page 174"&gt;Raymond Franz. ''Crisis of Conscience'', 2007, page 174, "No less serious is it when a group of men have divided views on predictions related to a certain date and yet present their adherents an outward appearance of united confidence, encouraging those adherents to place unwavering trust in those predictions."&lt;/ref&gt; If a member advocates views different to what appears in print, they face expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title = Jehovah's Witnesses Proclaimers of God's Kingdom |page= 629}} "people certainly ha[ve] the freedom to believe what they chose. But anyone who publicly or privately advocates views that are divergent from what appears in the publications of an organization, and who does so while claiming to represent that organization, causes division."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Franz| first= Raymond| authorlink = Raymond Franz |title= In Search of Christian Freedom |publisher= Commentary Press| year= 2007| location= Atlanta |pages= 18–28| isbn= 0-914675-17-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last= Botting| first= Heather| author2 = Gary Botting |title= The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses| publisher= University of Toronto Press |year= 1984 |pages= 66–69| isbn= 0-8020-6545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Failed predictions that were either explicitly stated or strongly implied, particularly linked to dates in 1914, 1915, 1918, 1925 and 1975, have led to the alteration or abandonment of some teachings. The Society's publications have at times suggested that members had previously "read into the ''Watch Tower'' statements that were never intended"&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses in the Divine Purpose'', Watch Tower Society, 1959, page 52.&lt;/ref&gt; or that the beliefs of members were "based on wrong premises."&lt;ref&gt;"A Solid Basis for Confidence", ''The Watchtower'', July 15, 1976, page 440.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Professor Edmond Gruss, other failed predictions were ignored, and replaced with new predictions; for example, in the book, ''The Finished Mystery'' (1917), events were applied to the years 1918 to 1925 that earlier had been held to occur prior to 1914. When the new interpretations also did not transpire, the 1926 edition of the book changed the statements and removed the dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Gruss| first = Edmond C.| title = The Jehovah's Witnesses and Prophetic Speculation| publisher = Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Co| year = 1972| pages = 87–88| isbn = 0-87552-306-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raymond Franz, a former member of the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses, has cited publications that claimed God has used Jehovah's Witnesses as a collective prophet.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Crisis of Conscience'', 2002, pg. 173, Franz quotes from "They Shall Know That a Prophet Was Among Them", (''The Watchtower'', April 1, 1972,) which states that God had raised Jehovah's Witnesses as "a prophet to help [people], to warn them of dangers and declare things to come". He also cites "Identifying the Right Kind of Messenger" (''The Watchtower'', May 1, 1997, page 8) which identifies the Witnesses as his "true messengers ... by making the messages he delivers through them come true", in contrast to "false messengers", whose predictions fail. In ''In Search of Christian Freedom,'' 2007, he quotes ''The Nations Shall Know That I Am Jehovah - How?'' (1971, pg 70, 292) which describes Witnesses as the modern Ezekiel class, "a genuine prophet within our generation". The Watch Tower book noted: "Concerning the message faithfully delivered by the Ezekiel class, Jehovah positively states that it 'must come true' ... those who wait undecided until it does 'come true' will also have to know that a prophet himself had proved to be in the midst of them." He also cites "Execution of the Great Harlot Nears", (''The Watchtower'', October 15, 1980, pg 17) which claims God gives the Witnesses "special knowledge that others do not have ... advance knowledge about this system's end".&lt;/ref&gt; Professor James A. Beverley, along with others, has accused the movement of false prophecy for making those predictions, particularly because of assertions in some cases that the predictions were beyond doubt or had been approved by God, but describes its record of telling the future as "pathetic".&lt;ref&gt;James A. Beverley, ''Crisis of Allegiance'', Welch Publishing Company, Burlington, Ontario, 1986, {{ISBN|0-920413-37-4}}, pages 86-91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Criticisms of statements, such as those found below, are found in a number of books including Penton, M. James (1997) ''Apocalypse Delayed'', University of Toronto Press; Franz, Raymond, ''In Search of Christian Freedom'' (2007) Commentary Press; Watters, Randall (2004) ''Thus Saith Jehovah's Witnesses'', Common Sense Publications; Reed, David A. (1990) ''Index of Watchtower Errors'', 1879 to 1989, Baker Books and at websites including [http://www.watchtowerinformationservice.org/index.php/watchtower_quotes/ Watchtower Information Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826172536/http://www.watchtowerinformationservice.org/index.php/watchtower_quotes/ |date=2006-08-26 }}; [http://www.quotes-watchtower.co.uk/ Quotes-Watchtower.co.uk]; [http://www.reexamine.org/quotes/ Reexamine.Quotes].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waldeck, Val ''Jehovah's Witnesses: What do they believe?''.

''Let No One Mislead You''. iUniverse. {{ISBN|0-595-30710-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Beverley says the Watch Tower Society has passed judgment on others who have falsely predicted the end of the world (he cites a 1968 ''Awake!'' article that says other groups were "guilty of false prophesying" after having "predicted an 'end to the world', even announcing a specific date").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watchtowerwiki.org/files/1968_Oct_8_Awake_BW.pdf|title=''Awake!'', October 8, 1968, p. 23.|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James A. Beverley, ''Crisis of Allegiance'', Welch Publishing Company, Burlington, Ontario, 1986, {{ISBN|0-920413-37-4}}, page 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Watch Tower Society rejects accusations that it is a false prophet.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Why So Many False Alarms?", ''Awake!'', March 22, 1993, pages 3-4, footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Reasoning From the Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1989, pg 137.&lt;/ref&gt; It admits its explanations of Bible prophecy are not infallible&lt;ref&gt;''Revelation - Its Grand Climax'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1988, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;March 1, 1904 ''Zion's Watch Tower'' p. 67, "We have in the Scriptures what we think is clear testimony respecting that date [1914], but no particulars or dates for the intervening time. It is not our intention to enter upon the role of prophet to any degree, but merely to give below what seems to us rather likely to be the trend of events."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Views From the Watchtower", ''Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence'', January 1908, "We are not prophesying; we are merely giving our surmises ... We do not even [assert] that there is no mistake in our interpretation of prophesy and our calculations of chronology. We have merely laid these before you, leaving it for each to exercise his own faith or doubt in respect to them."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Preaching Christ—Through Envy or Goodwill?", ''The Watchtower'', May 15, 1976, p. 297, "Jehovah’s Witnesses as modern-day Christians are working hard to get this good news preached to every individual. They do not claim infallibility or perfection. Neither are they inspired prophets."&lt;/ref&gt; and that its predictions are not claimed explicitly as "the words of Jehovah."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; It states that some of its expectations have needed adjustment because of eagerness for God's kingdom, but that those adjustments are no reason to "call into question the whole body of truth."&lt;ref&gt;"Allow No Place for the Devil!", ''The Watchtower'', March 15, 1986, page 19, "Some opposers claim that Jehovah’s Witnesses are false prophets. These opponents say that dates have been set, but nothing has happened. ... Yes, Jehovah’s people have had to revise expectations from time to time. Because of our eagerness, we have hoped for the new system earlier than Jehovah’s timetable has called for it. But we display our faith in God’s Word and its sure promises by declaring its message to others. Moreover, the need to revise our understanding somewhat does not make us false prophets or change the fact that we are living in 'the last days,' ... How foolish to take the view that expectations needing some adjustment should call into question the whole body of truth! The evidence is clear that Jehovah has used and is continuing to use his one organization."&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond Franz claims that the Watch Tower Society tries to evade its responsibility when citing human fallibility as a defense, adding that the Society represents itself as God's appointed spokesman, and that throughout its history has made many emphatic predictions. Franz adds that the organization's eagerness for the Millennium does not give it license to impugn the motives of those who fail to accept its predictions.&lt;ref name="Raymond Franz 2007, page 174" /&gt;

[[George D. Chryssides]] has suggested widespread claims that Witnesses "keep changing the dates" are a distortion and misunderstanding of Watch Tower Society chronology. He argues that, although there have been failures in prophetic speculation, the changing views and dates of the Jehovah's Witnesses are more largely attributable to changed understandings of biblical chronology than to failed predictions. Chryssides states, "For the Jehovah’s Witnesses prophecy serves more as a way of discerning a divine plan in human history than a means to predicting the future."&lt;ref name="Georgie"&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/2010/to-chryssides.htm George Chryssides, ''They Keep Changing the Dates'', A paper presented at the CESNUR 2010 conference in Torino.] [http://www.equinoxjournals.com/IJSNR/article/viewFile/8147/pdf How Prophecy Succeeds: The Jehovah's Witnesses and Prophetic Expectations]&lt;/ref&gt;

Predictions (by date of publication) include:
*'''1877:''' Christ's kingdom would hold full sway over the earth in 1914; the Jews, as a people, would be restored to God's favor; the "saints" would be carried to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taze Russell and Nelson H. Barbour, ''The Three Worlds'' (1907) as cited by James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', pages 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1891:''' 1914 would be "the farthest limit of the rule of imperfect men."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taze Russell, ''The Time Is At Hand'' (1891) as cited by James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', page 44.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1904:''' "World-wide anarchy" would follow the end of the Gentile Times in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin D. Curry, ''Jehovah's Witnesses: The Millenarian World of the Watch Tower'', Garland, 1992, as cited by James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', page 45.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1916:''' World War I would terminate in Armageddon and the rapture of the "saints".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Penton |first=James |title=Apocalypse Delayed: The Story of Jehovah's Witnesses |year=1997 |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]] |location= |isbn=978-0802079732 |page=46 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1917:''' In 1918, Christendom would go down as a system to oblivion and be succeeded by revolutionary governments. God would "destroy the churches wholesale and the church members by the millions." Church members would "perish by the sword of war, revolution and anarchy." The dead would lie unburied. In 1920 all earthly governments would disappear, with worldwide anarchy prevailing.&lt;ref&gt;''The Finished Mystery'', 1917, p. 485, 258, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', pages 206-211.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1920:''' Messiah's kingdom would be established in 1925 and bring worldwide peace. God would begin restoring the earth. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and other faithful patriarchs would be resurrected to perfect human life and be made princes and rulers, the visible representatives of the New Order on earth. Those who showed themselves obedient to God would never die.&lt;ref&gt;J. F. Rutherford, ''Millions Now Living Will Never Die'', 1920, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', pages 212-214.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1922:''' The anti-typical "jubilee" that would mark God's intervention in earthly affairs would take place "probably the fall" of 1925.&lt;ref&gt;''Watch Tower'', May 15, 1922, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 224.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1924:''' God's restoration of Earth would begin "shortly after" October 1, 1925. [[Jerusalem]] would be made the world's capital. Resurrected "princes" such as [[Abel]], [[Noah]], [[Moses]] and [[John the Baptist]] would give instructions to their subjects around the world by radio, and airplanes would transport people to and from Jerusalem from all parts of the globe in just "a few hours".&lt;ref&gt;''The Way to Paradise'' booklet, Watch Tower Society, 1924, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', pages 230-232.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1938:''' Armageddon was too close for marriage or child bearing.&lt;ref&gt;''Face the Facts'', 1938, pp. 46-50&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1941:''' There were only "months" remaining until Armageddon.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', September 15, 1941, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1942:''' Armageddon was "immediately before us."&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', May 1, 1942, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1961:''' ''Awake!'' magazine stated that Armageddon "will come in the twentieth century. ... This generation will see its fulfillment."&lt;ref&gt;''Awake!'', February 22, 1961, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1966:''' It would be 6000 years since man's creation in the fall of 1975 and it would be "appropriate" for Christ's thousand-year reign to begin at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Life Everlasting in Freedom of the Sons of God|publisher=Watch Tower Society|year=1966|url=http://www.strictlygenteel.co.uk/lifeeverlasting/1966_Life_Everlasting.pdf|pages=29–35}}, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', pages 238-239.&lt;/ref&gt; Time was "running out, no question about that."&lt;ref&gt;Talk by F. W.

Although Watch Tower Society literature claims the Society's founder, [[Charles Taze Russell]], was directed by God's Holy Spirit, through which he received "flashes of light",&lt;ref&gt;"Flashes of Light - Great and Small", ''The Watchtower'', May 15, 1995, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; it has substantially altered doctrines since its inception and abandoned many of Russell's teachings.&lt;ref name=Franz184&gt;Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the changes have involved biblical chronology that had earlier been claimed as beyond question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Watchtower|date=July 15, 1894|page=1677|quote=We see no reason for changing the figures—nor could we change them if we would.

*''Date of beginning of Christ's kingdom rule''. Russell taught that Jesus had become king in April 1878.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in the Scriptures Vol. II 1889 p. 239, Studies in the Scriptures Volume III 1891 p. 234, Studies in Scriptures Vol. IV 1897 p. 621.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses - Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', Watch Tower Society, 1993, page 632.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, Joseph Rutherford altered the date to 1914.&lt;ref name=Franz184 /&gt;
*''Date of resurrection of anointed Christians''. After the failure of predictions that Christ's chosen "saints" would be carried away to heaven in 1878,&lt;ref&gt;M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', University of Toronto Press, pages 20, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell developed the teaching that those "dying in the Lord" from 1878 forward would have an immediate heavenly resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', University of Toronto Press, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Watch Tower'' confirmed the doctrine in 1925,&lt;ref&gt;''Watchtower'', February 1, 1925, page 371.&lt;/ref&gt; but two years later asserted this date was wrong&lt;ref&gt;''Watchtower'', May 15, 1927, page 151.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the beginning of the instant resurrection to heaven for faithful Christians was from 1918.&lt;ref&gt;''Watchtower'', June 1, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Great Pyramid as a "stone witness" of God''. Russell wrote in 1910 that God had the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in Egypt built as a testimony to the truth of the Bible and proof of its chronology identifying the "last days".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pastor-russell.com/volumes/V3/Study_10.html "The Corroborative Testimony of God's Stone Witness and Prophet, The Great Pyramid in Egypt", Chapter 10, ''Thy Kingdom Come'', third volume of Studies in the Scriptures, 1910].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Watchtower'', June 15, 1922, page 187, as reproduced by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 225, 226.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 Rutherford rejected the doctrine and claimed the Pyramid had been built under the direction of Satan.&lt;ref&gt;''Watchtower'', 1928, pages 339-45, 355-62, as cited by M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', University of Toronto Press, page 170.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Identity of "faithful and wise servant"''. Russell initially believed the "faithful and wise servant" of Matthew 24:45 was "every member of this body of Christ ... the whole body individually and collectively."&lt;ref&gt;''Watch Tower'', October–November 1881, as cited by ''Jehovah's Witnesses - Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', Watch Tower Society, 1993, page 142.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1886 he had altered his view and began explaining it was a person, not the Christian church.&lt;ref&gt;''The Battle of Armageddon'' by C. T. Russell, 1886, page 613, as cited by M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', footnote, page 345.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell accepted claims by Bible Students that he was that "servant"&lt;ref&gt;''Watch Tower'', December 1, 1916, as cited by M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', page 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Watch Tower'', March 1, 1923, pages 68 and 71, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses - Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', Watch Tower Society, 1993, page 626, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 67.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1909 described as his "opponents" those who would apply the term "faithful and wise servant" to "all the members of the church of Christ" rather than to an individual.&lt;ref&gt;''Watch Tower'', October 1, 1909, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 67.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1927 the Watch Tower Society was teaching that it was "a collective servant."&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses - Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', Watch Tower Society, 1993, page 626.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Beginning of the "last days"''. From the earliest issues of the ''Watch Tower'', Russell promoted the belief that the "last days" had begun in 1799 and would ''end'' in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;''Thy Kingdom Come'', 1891, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1921 Watch Tower publications were still claiming the last days had begun in 1799.&lt;ref&gt;''The Harp of God'', (1921), 1924 ed., p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 that date was abandoned and 1914 was fixed as the ''beginning'' of the last days.
*''Jews' role in God's Kingdom''. Russell followed the view of [[Nelson H. Barbour]], who believed that in 1914 Christ's kingdom would take power over all the earth and the Jews, as a people, would be restored to God's favor.&lt;ref&gt;M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', pages 21, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889 Russell wrote that with the completion of the "Gentile Times" in 1914, Israel's "blindness" would subside and they would convert to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Russell, ''The Time Is At Hand'' (Watch Tower Society, 1889, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 190, 204.&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''Life'' (1929) noted that the return of Jews to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] signaled that the end was very close, because Jews would "have the favors first and thereafter all others who obey the Lord" under God's restoration of his kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;''Life'', Watch Tower Society, 1929, page 170, as cited by Edmond C. Gruss, ''The Jehovah's Witnesses and Prophetic Speculation'', Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Co, 1972, page 87.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 that belief was abandoned and from that date the Watch Tower Society taught that Witnesses alone were the Israel of God.&lt;ref&gt;J.F. Rutherford, ''Vindication - Book II'', pages 257-258, as cited by M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', page 65.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Date of Christ's invisible presence''. The Watch Tower Society taught for more than 60 years that this began in 1874, insisting in 1922 that the date was "indisputable".&lt;ref name="Watch Tower 1922, page 228"&gt;''Watch Tower'', November 1, 1922, page 333, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', March 1, 1922, "The indisputable facts, therefore, show that the time of the end began in 1799; that the Lord's second presence began in 1874".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 the society moved the event to 1914.&lt;ref name=Franz184 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', University of Toronto Press, pages 18-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"No Spiritual Energy Crisis for Discreet Ones", ''The Watchtower'', August 15, 1974, page 507, footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Identity of the "superior authorities"''. Russell taught that the "superior authorities" of Romans 13:1, to whom Christians had to show subjection and obedience, were governmental authorities. In 1929 ''The Watchtower'' discarded this view, stating that the term referred only to God and Christ, and saying the change of doctrine was evidence of "advancing light" of truth shining forth to God's chosen people.&lt;ref name="Raymond Franz 2007, page 484"&gt;Raymond Franz, ''In Search of Christian Freedom'', 2007, page 484.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, ''The Watchtower'' stated that the words of Romans 13 "could never have applied to the political powers of Caesar’s world as wrongly claimed by the clergy of Christendom,"&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', June 15, 1952, page 376.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1960 ''The Watchtower'' described the earlier view as a factor that had caused the Bible Student movement to be "unclean" in God's eyes during the 1914–1918 period. Two years later, in 1962, ''The Watchtower'' reverted to Russell's initial doctrine.&lt;ref name="Raymond Franz 2007, page 484"/&gt;
*''Identity and function of the Governing Body''. Frequent mentions of the term "Governing Body" began in Watch Tower Society literature in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Franz| first = Raymond| title = In Search of Christian Freedom| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| page = 107| isbn = 0-914675-17-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Governing Body was initially identified as the Watch Tower Society's seven-member board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;''Qualified To Be Ministers'', Watch Tower Society, 1955, page 381, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', 2007, page 74.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the time, the board played no role in establishing Watchtower doctrines, and all such decisions since the Society's origins had been made by the Society's president.&lt;ref&gt;Marley Cole, ''Jehovah's Witnesses - The New World Society'', Vantage Press, New York, 1955, pages 86-89, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', 2007, page 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Testimony by Fred Franz, Lord Strachan vs. Douglas Walsh Transcript, Lord Strachan vs. Douglas Walsh, 1954, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', 2007, page 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1923 ''Watch Tower'' noted that Russell alone directed the policy and course of the Society "without regard to any other person on earth"&lt;ref&gt;''Watch Tower'', March 1, 1923, page 68, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', 2007, page 59.&lt;/ref&gt; and both his successors, Rutherford and Knorr, also acted alone in establishing Watch Tower doctrines. An organizational change on January 1, 1976, for the first time gave the Governing Body the power to rule on doctrines&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', 2007, pages 58-79.&lt;/ref&gt; and become the ruling council of Jehovah's Witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', 1997, page 216.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, ''The Watchtower'' in 1971 claimed that a Governing Body of anointed Christians had existed since the 19th century to govern the affairs of God's anointed people.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', December 15, 1971, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', 2007, page 78.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Treatment of disfellowshipped persons''. In the 1950s when disfellowshipping became common, Witnesses were to have nothing to do with expelled members, not conversing with or acknowledging them.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', July 1, 1963, page 412.&lt;/ref&gt; Family members of expelled individuals were permitted occasional "contacts absolutely necessary in matters pertaining to family interests," but could not discuss spiritual matters with them.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', July 15, 1963, page 443.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 ''The Watchtower'', acknowledging some unbalanced Witnesses had displayed unkind, inhumane and possibly cruel attitudes to those expelled,&lt;ref&gt;"Maintaining a Balanced Viewpoint Toward Disfellowshiped Ones", ''The Watchtower'', August 1, 1974, pages 467, "It is right to hate the wrong committed by the disfellowshiped one, but it is not right to hate the person nor is it right to treat such ones in an inhumane way."&lt;/ref&gt; relaxed restrictions on family contact, allowing families to choose for themselves the extent of association,&lt;ref&gt;"Maintaining a Balanced Viewpoint Toward Disfellowshiped Ones", ''The Watchtower'', August 1, 1974, pages 471-472.&lt;/ref&gt; including whether or not to discuss some spiritual matters.&lt;ref&gt;"Maintaining a Balanced Viewpoint Toward Disfellowshiped Ones", ''The Watchtower'', August 1, 1974, page 471, par 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, a reversal of policy occurred, with Witnesses instructed to avoid all spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped ones, including with close relatives.&lt;ref name="The Watchtower 1981, page 28"&gt;"If a Relative Is Disfellowshiped", ''The Watchtower'', September 15, 1981, page 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses were instructed not to greet disfellowshipped persons.&lt;ref name="The Watchtower 1981, page 28"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Disfellowshiping—How to View It", ''The Watchtower'', September 15, 1981, pages 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"If a Relative Is Disfellowshiped", ''The Watchtower'', September 15, 1981, page 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Parents were permitted to care for the physical needs of a disfellowshipped minor child; ill parents or physically or emotionally ill child could be accepted back into the home "for a time". Witnesses were instructed not to eat with disfellowshipped relatives and were warned that emotional influence could soften their resolve.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', September 15, 1981, pages 20-31, as cited by M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', University of Toronto Press, page 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 the Witnesses' Brooklyn headquarters advised traveling overseers that a person need not be ''promoting'' "apostate views" to warrant disfellowshipping; it advised that "appropriate judicial action" be taken against a person who "continues to believe the apostate ideas and rejects what he has been provided" through ''The Watchtower''.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to all circuit and district overseers from Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of New York, September 1, 1980, as reproduced by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 341.&lt;/ref&gt; The rules on shunning were extended in 1981 to include those who had resigned from the group voluntarily.&lt;ref&gt;"Disfellowshiping—How to View It", ''The Watchtower'', September 15, 1981, pages 23, as cited by M. James Penton, ''Apocalypse Delayed'', University of Toronto Press, page 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 357-359.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Fall of "Babylon the Great".'' Russell taught that the fall of the "world empire of false religion" had taken place in 1878 and predicted "Babylon's" complete destruction in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;''Watch Tower'', June 15, 1911, as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', page 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford claimed in 1917 that religion's final destruction would take place in 1918, explaining that God would destroy churches "wholesale" and that "Christendom shall go down as a system to oblivion."&lt;ref&gt;''The Finished Mystery'', 1917, p. 485, 258, 513 as cited by Raymond Franz, ''Crisis of Conscience'', pages 206-211.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 the Watch Tower Society claimed that release from prison in 1919 of senior Watchtower figures marked the fall of Babylon "as far as having any captive hold on God's people was concerned",&lt;ref&gt;''Revelation - It's Grand Climax at Hand!'', Watch Tower Society, 1988, page 209.&lt;/ref&gt; with her "final destruction" "into oblivion, never to recover", expected "in the near future."&lt;ref&gt;''Revelation - It's Grand Climax at Hand!'', Watch Tower Society, 1988, pages 266, 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations association===
{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses and the United Nations}}
Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the United Nations is one of the 'superior authorities' that exist by God's permission, and that it serves a purpose in maintaining order, but do not support it politically and do not consider it to be the means to achieve peace and security. Jehovah's Witnesses also believe that the United Nations is the "[[The Beast (Revelation)#Image of the beast|image of the wild beast]]" of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 13:1-18, and the second fulfilment of the "abominable thing that causes desolation" from Matthew 24:15; that it will be the means for the devastation of organized false religion worldwide;&lt;ref&gt;[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2001844#h=17 "No Calamity Will Befall Us" (Subheading)].

''The Watchtower'', p 14&lt;/ref&gt; and that, like all other political powers, it will be destroyed and replaced by God's heavenly kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;"A World Without War-When?" Oct.1, 1991, pp.5 ''The Watchtower''&lt;/ref&gt; Jehovah's Witnesses have denounced other religious organizations for having offered political support to the UN.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', 1 June 1997, p. 17 par. 15: "In the first place, what lies ahead for the world's false religions that have so often been extremely friendly with the UN? They are the offspring of one idolatrous fountainhead, ancient Babylon. Appropriately, they are described at Revelation 17:5 as "Babylon the Great, the mother of the harlots and of the disgusting things of the earth". Jeremiah described the doom of this hypocritical conglomerate. Harlotlike, they have seduced earth's politicians, flattering the UN and forming illicit relations with its member political powers."&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, 2001, an article was published in the British ''Guardian'' newspaper questioning the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society's registration as a non-governmental organization ([[non-governmental organization|NGO]]) with the [[United Nations]] Department of Public Information and accusing the Watch Tower Society of hypocrisy.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Stephen (Oct. 8, 2001) [https://www.theguardian.com/religion/Story/0,,565199,00.html "Jehovah's Witnesses link to UN queried"], ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt; Within days of the article's publication, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society submitted a formal request for disassociation, removing all association with the United Nations Department of Public Information,&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Stephen (Oct. 15, 2001) [https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4277197,00.html "'Hypocrite' Jehovah's Witnesses abandon secret link with UN"], ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt; and released a letter stating that the reason for becoming associated with the United Nations Department of Information (DPI) was to access their facilities, and that they had not been aware of the change in language contained in the criteria for NGO association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randytv.com/secret/enclosure4USE.jpg Letter to Editor - The Guardian"] (Oct. 22, 2001) ''Office of Public Information''&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the Watch Tower Society sought NGO association, "the organization agreed to meet criteria for association, including support and respect of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations", acknowledging that the purpose of membership is to "promote knowledge of the principles and activities of the United Nations."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from United Nations DPI/NGO Resource Centre&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fall of Jerusalem===
Jehovah's Witnesses assert that Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonians in 607 BC and completely uninhabited for exactly seventy years. This date is critical to their selection of October 1914 for the arrival of Christ in kingly power—2520 years after October 607 BC.&lt;ref&gt;''Pay Attention to Daniel's Prophecy!'' chap. 6 par. 25-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gruss&gt;Edmond C. Gruss, ''Jehovah's Witnesses and Prophetic Speculation'', Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Co, 1972, {{ISBN|0-87552-306-4}} Page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Witness sources do not support 607 BC for the event, placing the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|destruction of Jerusalem]] within a year of 587 BC, twenty years later.&lt;ref name=gruss /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Rogerson, ''Millions Now Living Will Never Die'', Constable, 1969, page 105, "Secular historians put this date as 586 or 587 BC but the Witnesses, following Russell, place it at 607 BC."&lt;/ref&gt; Jehovah's Witnesses believe that periods of seventy years mentioned in the books of Jeremiah and Daniel refer to the Babylonian exile of Jews. They also believe that the gathering of Jews in Jerusalem, shortly after their return from Babylon, officially ended the exile in Jewish month of ''[[Tishrei]]'' (Ezra 3:1). According to the Watch Tower Society, October 607 BC is derived by counting back seventy years from ''Tishrei'' of 537 BC, based on their belief that Cyrus' decree to release the Jews during his first regnal year "may have been made in late 538 B.C. or before March 4–5, 537 B.C."&lt;ref name="WT 10/1"&gt;"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2011736 When Was Ancient Jerusalem Destroyed?—Part One]" ''The Watchtower'', October 1, 2011, page 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=The Watchtower|title=Evidences of the Year’s Correctness|date=May 1, 1952|pages=271–2|quote = It was in this first regnal year of Cyrus that he issued his decree to permit the Jews to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple. (Ezra 1:1) The decree may have been made in late 538 B.C. or before March 4–5, 537 B.C. In either case this would have given sufficient time for the large party of 49,897 Jews to organize their expedition and to make their long four-month journey from Babylon to Jerusalem to get there by September 29–30, 537 B.C., the first of the seventh Jewish month, to build their altar to Jehovah as recorded at Ezra 3:1-3. Inasmuch as September 29–30, 537 B.C., officially ends the seventy years of desolation as recorded at 2 Chronicles 36:20, 21, so the beginning of the desolation of the land must have officially begun to be counted after September 21–22, 607 B.C., the first of the seventh Jewish month in 607 B.C., which is the beginning point for the counting of the 2,520 years.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secular sources assign the return to either 538 BC or 537 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/47693/Babylonian-Exile |title=Babylonian Exile |date=February 26, 2016 |website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/exile2.html |title=Timeline of Judaism after the Babylonian Exile (538 BCE-70 CE) |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Keller | first = Werner | title = The Bible As History| publisher = Bantam; 2 Revised edition | year = 1983| page = 352 | isbn =0-553-27943-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of the Bible: Biographical, Geographical, Historical and Doctrinal'' by Charles Randall Barnes, Page 247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dyer | first = Charles | title = Nelson’s Old Testament survey: Discovering essence, Background &amp; Meaning about Every Old Testament book| year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Gentile Times Reconsidered: Chronology &amp; Christ's Return'', Carl O. Jonsson, a former Witness, presents eighteen lines of evidence to support the traditional view of neo-Babylonian chronology. He accuses the Watch Tower Society of deliberately misquoting sources in an effort to bolster their position.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gentile Times Reconsidered: Chronology &amp; Christ's Return'' by Carl O. Jonsson. {{ISBN|0-914675-06-0}} Publisher: Commentary Press (July, 1998, Fourth edition 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The Watch Tower Society claims that biblical chronology is not always compatible with secular sources, and that the Bible is superior. It claims that secular historians make conclusions about 587 BC based on incorrect or inconsistent historical records, but accepts those sources that identify Cyrus' capture of Babylon in 539 BC, claiming it has no evidence of being inconsistent and hence can be used as a pivotal date.&lt;ref name="WT 10/1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2011810 When Was Ancient Jerusalem Destroyed?—Part Two]" ''The Watchtower'', November 1, 2011, page 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200003156#h=17 ''Insight on the Scriptures''. Vol.2 page 459], "secular chronologers calculate the 16th day of Tashritu (Tishri) as falling on October 11, Julian calendar, and October 5, Gregorian calendar, in the year 539 B.C.E. Since this date is an accepted one, there being no evidence to the contrary, it is usable as a pivotal date in coordinating secular history with Bible history."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rolf Furuli]], a Jehovah's Witness and a lecturer in Semitic languages, presents a study of 607 BC in support of the Witnesses' conclusions in ''Assyrian, Babylonian, Egyptian, and Persian Chronology Compared with the Chronology of the Bible, Volume 1: Persian Chronology and the Length of the Babylonian Exile of the Jews''.&lt;ref&gt;''Assyrian, Babylonian, Egyptian, and Persian Chronology Compared with the Chronology of the Bible, Volume 1: Persian Chronology and the Length of the Babylonian Exile of the Jews'' (2003) {{ISBN|82-994633-3-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lester L. Grabbe, professor of theology at the University of Hull, said of Furuli's study: "Once again we have an amateur who wants to rewrite scholarship. ... F. shows little evidence of having put his theories to the test with specialists in Mesopotamian astronomy and Persian history."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Journal for the Study of the Old Testament]]'' 28:5 [2004], p. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative positions of the moon, stars and planets indicated in the [[Babylonian astronomical diary]] ''VAT 4956'' are used by secular historians to establish 568 BC as the thirty-seventh year of [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]]'s reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stephenson |first1=F.

===Evolution===
The Watch Tower Society teaches a combination of [[gap creationism]] and [[day-age creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Watch Tower Society|title=Is There a Creator Who Cares About You?|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; It dismisses [[Young Earth creationism]] as "unscriptural and unbelievable",&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', April 1, 1986, pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; and states that Jehovah's Witnesses "are not creationists" on the basis that they do not believe the earth was created in six literal days.&lt;ref&gt;''Awake!'', May 8, 1997, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', September 1, 1986, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Watch Tower Society publications attempt to refute the [[scientific theory|theory]] of [[evolution]], in favor of divine [[creationism|creation]].&lt;ref&gt;''Life — How Did It Get Here? By Evolution Or By Creation?'', Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Was Life Created?'', Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Watch Tower Society's views of evolution have met with criticism typical of [[objections to evolution]]. [[Gary Botting]] described his own difficulty as a Jehovah's Witness to reconcile creation with simple observations of species diversification, especially after discussions with [[J.B.S. Haldane]] in India.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Botting, "Preface" to ''The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses'', pp. xiv-xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society's 1985 publication, ''Life—How Did it Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?'' is criticized for its dependency on [[Francis Hitching]], who is cited thirteen times. The book presents Hitching—a TV writer and paranormalist with no scientific credentials—as an evolutionary scientist.&lt;ref&gt;Hitching is first introduced as an "evolutionist" (p. 15). A Hitching quote on page 71 is repeated on page 73, in the latter case presented as the statement of "a scientist". The 1986 Watchtower book ''The Bible — God's Word or Man's?'' likewise refers to Hitching as a scientist (p. 106).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Dawkins]] also criticizes the book for implying that "chance" is the only alternative to deliberate design, stating, "[T]he candidate solutions to the riddle of improbability are not, as falsely implied, design and chance. They are design and [[natural selection]]."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins: ''The God Delusion'', p. 145. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. 2006. {{ISBN|0-618-68000-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Franz and others have described Jehovah's Witnesses' meetings as "catechistical" question-and-answer sessions in which questions and answers are both provided by the organization, placing pressure on members to reiterate its opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Franz |first=Raymond |title=In Search of Christian Freedom |publisher=Commentary Press |year=2007 |edition=2nd |pages = 419–421|isbn = 0-914675-17-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Stevenson | first = W.C.| title = Year of Doom 1975: The Inside Story of Jehovah's Witnesses | publisher = Hutchinson &amp; Co | year = 1967 | location = London | pages = 33–35 | quote= The inevitable result of a person's submitting to (the home Bible study) arrangement is that eventually all his own thoughts will be replaced by the thoughts contained in the book he is studying ... if one were able to watch this person's development ... it would be quite obvious that he was gradually losing all individuality of thought and action ...

&lt;!--Defense from Jehovah's witnesses--&gt;
The Society has described its intolerance of dissident and divergent doctrinal views within its ranks as "strict", but claims its stance is based on the scriptural precedent of 2&amp;nbsp;Timothy&amp;nbsp;2:17, 18 in which the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]] condemns [[Christian heresy|heretics]] [[Hymenaeus (Ephesian)|Hymenaeus]] and [[Philetus (Ephesian)|Philetus]] who denied the [[resurrection of Jesus]]. It said: "Following such Scriptural patterns, if a Christian (who claims belief in God, the Bible, and Jesus) unrepentantly promotes false teachings, it may be necessary for him to be expelled from the congregation ... Hence, the true Christian congregation cannot rightly be accused of being harshly dogmatic."&lt;ref&gt;"Questions from readers", ''Watchtower'', April 1, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Conclusion with scholars--&gt;
Sociologist [[Rodney Stark]] says that Jehovah's Witness leaders are "not always very democratic" and members are expected to conform to "rather strict standards", but that enforcement tends to be informal, sustained by close bonds of friendship, and that Jehovah's Witnesses see themselves as "part of the power structure rather than subject to it".&lt;ref name="Stark"&gt;{{Citation|title=[[Journal of Contemporary Religion]]|contribution=Why the Jehovah's Witnesses Grow So Rapidly: A Theoretical Application|contribution-url=http://www.theocraticlibrary.com/downloads/Why_Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_Grow_So_Rapidly.pdf|year=1997|pages=142–143|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-12-30|author=Stark and Iannoccone|ref=harv|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[James A.

Jehovah's Witnesses state that they are not a cult&lt;ref&gt;"Are Jehovah's Witnesses a Cult?", ''The Watchtower'', February 15, 1994, pages 5-7&lt;/ref&gt; and say that although individuals need proper guidance from God, they should do their own thinking.&lt;ref&gt;"Do Others Do Your Thinking?", ''Awake!'', August 22, 1978, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Who Molds Your Thinking?", ''The Watchtower'', April 1, 1999, page 22, "You have free will.

In 1992, American religious scholar [[J. Gordon Melton]] placed the Jehovah's Witnesses denomination in a list of "established cults".&lt;ref&gt;J. Gordon Melton, 1992, ''Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults in America'', p. v, 81-89&lt;/ref&gt; However, he and others have since been more reluctant to use the term "cult" for various groups, including Jehovah's Witnesses, because the term is considered too controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Joseba Zulaika and William Douglass, ''Terror and Taboo: The Follies, Fables, and Faces of Terrorism'', 1996, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-cult watchdog John Bowen Brown II&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| first=John Bowen | last=Brown II| contribution=Cult Watchdog Organizations and Jehovah’s Witnesses| title=Twenty Years and More: Research into Minority Religions, New Religious Movements and 'the New Spirituality'| editor-first=| editor-last=| publisher=Center for Studies on New Religions| place=London School of Economics, London, UK| pages=| date=2008-04-16 | contribution-url=http://www.cesnur.org/2008/london_brown.htm| accessdate=2010-03-03| editors= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Knocking (documentary)|Knocking]]'' producer [[Joel P.

===Coercion===
Since 1920 the Watch Tower Society has required all congregation members participating in the preaching work to turn in written reports of the amount of their activity,&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses in the Divine Purpose'', page 96, as cited by R. Franz, ''In Search of Christian Freedom'', chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; explaining that the reports help the Society to plan its activities and identify areas of greater need&lt;ref&gt;Question Box, ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', September 1979, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and help congregation elders to identify those who may need assistance.&lt;ref&gt;"Do You Contribute to an Accurate Report?", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', December 2002, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 the Society imposed personal quotas, requiring all active Witnesses to spend at least 60 hours of door-to-door preaching per month, claiming these were "directions from the Lord".&lt;ref&gt;"Righteous requirements", ''Watchtower'', July 1, 1943, pages 204-206, "Jehovah ... has appointed his 'faithful and wise servant, who is his visible mouthpiece ... These expressions of God's will by his King and through his established agency constitute his law or rule of action ... The Lord breaks down our organization instructions further ... He says the requirements for special pioneers shall be 175 hours and 50 back-calls per month ... and for regular pioneers 150 hours ... And for company publishers, he says, 'Let us make a quota of 60 hours and 12 back-calls and at least one study a week for each publisher'. These directions come to us from the Lord through his established agency directing what is required of us ... This expression of the Lord's will should be the end of all controversy ... The Lord through his 'faithful and wise servant' now states to us, ''Let us cover our territory four times in six months''. That becomes our organization instructions and has the same binding force on us that his statement to the Logos had when he said, 'Let us make man in our image'. It is our duty to accept this additional instruction and obey it."&lt;/ref&gt; Although these quotas were subsequently removed, Raymond Franz claims "invisible" quotas remained, obliging Witnesses to meet certain levels of preaching work to remain in good standing in the congregation&lt;ref name=Franz16&gt;R. Franz, ''In Search of Christian Freedom'', chapter 16.&lt;/ref&gt; or to qualify for eldership.&lt;ref name=Franz6 /&gt; Franz describes repeated urging for adherents to "put kingdom interests first" and devote increasing amounts of time to door-to-door preaching efforts as coercive pressure. He says many Witnesses constantly feel guilty that they are not doing more in "field activity".&lt;ref name=Franz6&gt;R. Franz, ''In Search of Christian Freedom'', chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Witnesses Heather and Gary Botting, claiming an emphasis on a personal track record would mean that salvation is effectively being "bought" with "good works", observed: "No matter how long a Witness remains an active distributor of literature, the moment he ceases to be active he is regarded by his peers as good as dead in terms of achieving the ultimate goal of life everlasting in an earthly paradise ... Few realize upon entering the movement that the purchase price is open-ended and that the bill can never be paid in full until death or the advent of Armageddon."&lt;ref name=orwell /&gt;

''The Watchtower'', however, noted that although public preaching is necessary, such works do not "save" a Christian and it urged Witnesses to examine their motive for engaging in preaching activity.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2005404 Saved, Not by Works Alone, But by Undeserved Kindness]", ''The Watchtower'', June 1, 2005, pages 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Andrew Holden, "those who fail to devote a satisfactory amount of time to doorstep evangelism (currently around seventeen hours per month in the United States) soon lose the respect of their co-religionists and may even be disfellowshipped. The Witnesses are thus forced to think quantitatively about their salvation."{{sfn|Holden|2002|p=72}}

Medical and legal commentators have noted cases, claiming that Witness medical patients were coerced to obey the denomination's ban on blood transfusions.&lt;ref name=Vancouver&gt;[https://culteducation.com/group/1267-jehovah-s-witnesses/11230-jehovahs-witnesses-case-heads-to-bc-court.html “Jehovah's Witnesses case heads to B.C. court”, Vancouver Sun, April 1, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pulsus.com/journals/abstract.jsp?HCtype=Consumer&amp;sCurrPg=journal&amp;jnlKy=5&amp;atlKy=6964&amp;isuKy=460&amp;spage=1&amp;isArt=t&amp;|title=Pulsus Group - Journals|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2528596/ Paediatr Child Health, Medical emergencies in children of orthodox Jehovah’s Witness families: Three recent legal cases, ethical issues and proposals for management]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Osamu Muramoto, in the ''Journal of Medical Ethics'', those who unrepentantly receive prohibited blood products are labeled "apostates", expelled, and shunned by other Jehovah's Witness friends or family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1377670 | pmid=9752623 | volume=24 | title=Bioethics of the refusal of blood by Jehovah's Witnesses: Part 1.

In a case involving a review of a Russian district court decision, the European Court of Human Rights found nothing in the judgements to suggest that any form of improper pressure or undue influence was applied. It noted: "On the contrary, it appears that many Jehovah's Witnesses have made a deliberate choice to refuse blood transfusions in advance, free from time constraints of an emergency situation." The court said: "The freedom to accept or refuse specific medical treatment, or to select an alternative form of treatment, is vital to the principles of self-determination and personal autonomy. A competent adult patient is free to decide ... not to have a blood transfusion. However, for this freedom to be meaningful, patients must have the right to make choices that accord with their own views and values, regardless of how irrational, unwise or imprudent such choices may appear to others." However, the court acknowledged that coercion by the group to reject blood transfusion may be involved, stating "even though the Jehovah's Witnesses whose opposition to blood transfusions was cited in evidence were adults having legal capacity to refuse that form of treatment, the findings of the Russian courts can be understood to mean that their refusals had not been an expression of their true will but rather the product of pressure exerted on them by the applicant community. The Court accepts that, given that health and possibly life itself are at stake in such situations, the authenticity of the patient's refusal of medical treatment is a legitimate concern."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=869647&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649|title=HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shunning===
{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses and congregational discipline|Shunning}}

The Watch Tower Society has attracted criticism for disfellowshipping members who decide they cannot conscientiously agree with all the denomination's teachings and practices. Sociologist Andrew Holden says that because the group provides no valid reason for leaving, those who do choose to leave are regarded as traitors.{{sfn|Holden|2002|p=150}} According to Raymond Franz, those who decide they cannot accept Watch Tower teachings and practices often live in a climate of fear, feeling they must constantly be on guard about what they say, do and read. He says those who do express any disagreement, even in a private conversation with friends, risk investigation and trial by a judicial committee as apostates or heretics&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Franz| first = Raymond| authorlink = Raymond Franz| title = In Search of Christian Freedom| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| page = 384| isbn = 0-914675-17-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and classed as "wicked".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Franz| first = Raymond| authorlink = Raymond Franz| title = In Search of Christian Freedom| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| page = 351| isbn = 0-914675-17-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franz argues that the threat of expulsion for expressing disagreement with the Watch Tower Society's teachings is designed to create a sterile atmosphere in which the organization's teachings and policies can circulate without the risk of confronting serious questioning or adverse evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Franz| first = Raymond| authorlink = Raymond Franz| title = In Search of Christian Freedom| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| page = 359| isbn = 0-914675-17-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result, according to Holden, is that individuals may spend most of their lives suppressing doubts for fear of losing their relationships with friends and relatives.{{sfn|Holden|2002|p=151}} Penton describes the system of judicial committees and the threat of expulsion as the ultimate control mechanism&lt;!--does source say "ultimate control mechanism"?--&gt;&lt;!--yes--&gt; among the Witnesses;&lt;ref name="Penton249"&gt;{{Citation|author=Penton, M. J.|title=Apocalypse Delayed|publisher=University of Toronto Press|edition=2nd|year=1997|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holden claims that shunning not only rids the community of defilement, but deters others from dissident behavior.{{sfn|Holden|2002|p=163}} Sociologist Ronald Lawson has also noted that the group allows little room for independence of thought, and no toleration of doctrinal diversity. He said those who deviate from official teachings are readily expelled and shunned.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Lawson, "Sect-State Relations: Accounting for the Differing Trajectories of Seventh-day Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses," ''Sociology of Religion'', 1995, 56:4, pg 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

Watch Tower Society publications defend the practice of expelling and shunning those who "promote false teaching", claiming such individuals must be quarantined to prevent the spread of their "spiritual infection".&lt;ref&gt;"Maintain Your Faith and Spiritual Health", ''The Watchtower'', October 1, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; They have cited a dictionary definition of apostasy ("renunciation of a religious faith, abandonment of a previous loyalty") to rule that an individual who begins affiliating with another religious organization has disassociated from the Witnesses, warranting their shunning to protect the spiritual cleanness of the Witness congregation on the basis of the reference in 1 John 2:19 that those who leave Christianity are "not of our sort".&lt;ref&gt;"Questions From Readers", ''The Watchtower'', October 15, 1986, page 31.&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's acceptance of a blood transfusion is similarly deemed as evidence of disassociation.&lt;ref&gt;Osamu Muramoto, "Bioethical aspects of the recent changes in the policy of refusal of blood by Jehovah's Witnesses", ''British Medical Journal'', January 6, 2001, page 37.&lt;/ref&gt; They say Witnesses also obey the "strong counsel" at 1 Corinthians 5:11 that Christians should "quit mixing in company" with people who unrepentantly reject certain scriptural standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ridley | first1 = Donald T. | year = 1999 | title = Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal of blood: Obedience to scripture and religious conscience | url = | journal = Journal of Medical Ethics | volume = 25 | issue = | page = 470 | doi=10.1136/jme.25.6.469| pmc = 479295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Witnesses' judicial process has also been criticized. Hearings take place in secret,&lt;ref name="Penton249" /&gt; with judicial committees filling the roles of judge, jury and prosecutor.&lt;ref name="Penton, M. J. 1997 89"/&gt; According to Franz, witnesses may present evidence but are not permitted to remain for the discussion.&lt;ref name="Franz38"&gt;{{Citation|author=Franz, Raymond|title=Crisis of Conscience|publisher=Commentary Press|year=2002|page=38|isbn=0-914675-23-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics Heather and Gary Botting have claimed that Witnesses accused of an offence warranting expulsion are presumed guilty until found innocent. They say the onus is on the accused to prove their innocence and if they make no attempt to do so—by failing to appear at a hearing set by the judicial committee—they are assumed to be guilty and unrepentant.&lt;ref name="Botting91"&gt;{{Citation| last = Botting| first = Heather | author2 = Gary Botting| title = The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses| publisher = University of Toronto Press| year = 1984| page= 91|isbn = 0-8020-6545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a decision is made regarding disfellowshipping or disassociation, an announcement is made that the person is "no longer one of Jehovah's Witnesses," at which point shunning is immediate. Members are not told whether the person has disassociated or has been disfellowshipped. Neither testimony nor evidence in support of the judicial decision are provided. Congregation members are told to accept the rulings without question and Witnesses who refuse to abide by a judicial committee decision will themselves suffer expulsion.&lt;ref name="Penton249" /&gt; Members are forbidden to talk with the expelled member, removing any opportunity for the person to discuss or explain their actions.&lt;ref name="Franz38" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Franz| first = Raymond| authorlink = Raymond Franz| title = In Search of Christian Freedom| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| page = 371| isbn = 0-914675-17-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penton claims judicial committee members and the Watch Tower Society frequently ignore established procedures when dealing with troublesome individuals, conspiring to have them expelled in violation of Society rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Penton, M. J.|title=Apocalypse Delayed|publisher=University of Toronto Press|edition=2nd|year=1997|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claim that Witness policies encourage an informer system to report to elders Witnesses suspected of having committed an act that could warrant expulsion, including deviating from organizational policies and teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Franz, ''In Search of Christian Freedom'', Commentary Press, pages 365-385, citing "A Time to Speak – When?", ''The Watchtower'', September 1, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Osamu Muramoto, "Bioethics of the refusal of blood by Jehovah’s Witnesses, Part 1", ''Journal of Medical Ethics'', August 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism has also been directed at the 1981 change of policy&lt;ref&gt;"Disfellowshiping—How to View It", ''The Watchtower,'' September 15, 1981, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; that directed that persons who disassociate from (formally leave) the group were to be treated as though they were disfellowshipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Penton, M. J.|title=Apocalypse Delayed|publisher=University of Toronto Press|edition=2nd|year=1997|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Franz, Raymond|title=Crisis of Conscience|publisher=Commentary Press|year=2002|page=357|isbn=0-914675-23-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holden says that as a result, those who do leave are seldom allowed a dignified exit.{{sfn|Holden|2002|p=163}} Heather and Gary Botting claim inactive Witnesses are often pressured to either become active or to disassociate themselves by declaring they no longer accept key Watch Tower Society doctrines.&lt;ref name="Botting91" /&gt;

===Blood===
{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses and blood transfusions}}
Jehovah's Witnesses reject transfusions of whole allogenic blood and its primary components (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and plasma), and transfusions of stored autologous blood or its primary components. As a doctrine, Jehovah's Witnesses do not reject transfusion of whole autologous blood so long as it is not stored prior to surgery (e.g. peri-operative extraction and transfusion of autologous blood). This religious position is due to their belief that blood is sacred and represents life in God's eyes. Jehovah's Witnesses understand scriptures such as [[Leviticus]] 17:10-14 (which speaks of not eating blood) and Acts 15:29 ("abstain from blood") to include taking blood into the body via a transfusion.&lt;ref name="How Can Blood Save Your Life"&gt;{{cite book|title=How Can Blood Save Your Life?|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy has stemmed, however, from what critics state are inconsistencies in Witness policies on blood, claims that Witness patients are coerced into refusing blood and that Watch Tower literature distorts facts about transfusions and fails to provide information that would allow Witnesses to make an informed decision on the issue.&lt;ref name="Muramoto"/&gt;

====Fractions and components====
In the case of [[Blood plasma fractionation|minor fractions derived from blood]], each individual is directed to follow their own conscience on whether these are acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2004445 Be guided by the Living God]" (Jun. 15, 2004). ''The Watchtower''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2000447 Questions from readers: Do Jehovah's Witnesses accept any minor fractions of blood?]" (Jun. 15, 2000). ''The Watchtower''&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, some Jehovah's Witnesses accept the use of blood fractions and others do not. However, fractions that carry out "the key function of a primary component" or make up "a significant portion of that component" are not permitted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/102006283#h=13 ''Awake!'' August 2006 box on P. 11]&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a stance of dividing blood into major components and minor fractions rather than either accepting all blood or requiring all blood components to be poured out onto the ground has led to criticism from organizations such as the ''Associated Jehovah's Witnesses for Reform on Blood''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajwrb.org/|title=AJWRB.org|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses respond that blood as the fluid ''per se'' is not the real issue. They say the real issue is ''respect'' and ''obedience'' regarding blood, which they perceive as being God's personal property.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'' November 1, 1961, p. 669 Questions From Readers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1102005143#h=16 ''What Does The Bible Really Teach?'' 2005 P.128]&lt;/ref&gt; Members are allowed to eat [[meat]] that still contains small traces of blood remaining. Once blood is drained from an animal, the ''respect'' has been shown to God and then a person can eat the meat. Jehovah's Witnesses view of meat and blood is therefore different from the Jewish view that goes to great lengths to remove even minor traces of blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ok.org/Content.asp?ID=122 |title=OK Kosher Certification — Salting of Meat |publisher=Ok.org |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/daily_life/Kashrut/Overview_Kosher_Food/Kosher_Meat/Making_Meat_Kosher.htm |title=Making Meat Kosher: Between Slaughtering and Cooking |publisher=My Jewish Learning |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to lawyer Kerry Louderback-Wood, a former Jehovah's Witness,&lt;ref&gt;[http://marshall-attorneys.com/Press/2006_01_26_NYT.htm "Religion Today", ''New York Times'', January 6, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427200056/http://www.marshall-attorneys.com/Press/2006_01_26_NYT.htm |date=April 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Watch Tower Society misrepresents the scope of allowed fractions. If taken together, they "total the entire volume of blood they came from".&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses, Blood Transfusions and the Tort of Misrepresentation'', Journal of Church and State Vol 47, Autumn 2005 p. 815&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this can be seen in blood plasma, which consists of 90-96% water. The remaining amount consists mainly of albumin, globulins, fibrinogen and coagulation factors. These four fractions are allowable for use, but only if taken separately. Raymond Franz has likened this to banning the eating of a ham and cheese sandwich but allowing the eating of bread, ham and cheese separately.&lt;ref&gt;Franz, Raymond. "In Search of Christian Freedom" - [http://www.ajwrb.org/misc/ray.htm Chapter Nine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207134306/http://www.ajwrb.org/misc/ray.htm |date=2006-02-07 }}. Atlanta: Commentary Press, 1991. {{ISBN|0-914675-16-8}}. p.732.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Storing and donation====
Jehovah's Witnesses believe that storing blood violates direction from the Bible to 'pour blood out onto the ground'. They do not donate blood except for uses they have individually pre-approved.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2000767 Questions From Readers]", ''The Watchtower'', October 15, 2000, page 31, "Jehovah’s Witnesses...do not donate blood [without preconditions on its use], nor do we store for transfusion our blood that should be ‘poured out.’ That practice conflicts with God’s law. Other procedures or tests involving an individual’s own blood are not so clearly in conflict with God’s stated principles. ...the goal may be to isolate some of a blood component and apply that elsewhere... A Christian must decide for himself how his own blood will be handled... Ahead of time, he should obtain from the doctor or technician the facts about what might be done with his blood during the procedure. Then he must decide according to what his conscience permits."&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are told that acceptance of blood fractions from donated blood is a matter of conscience. A 2006 issue of Jehovah's Witnesses' newsletter ''Our Kingdom Ministry'' stated, "Although [Jehovah's Witnesses] do not donate or store their own blood ''for transfusion purposes'', some procedures or tests involving an individual’s blood are not so clearly in conflict with Bible principles. Therefore, each individual should make a conscientious decision" [emphasis added].&lt;ref&gt;"How Do I View Blood Fractions and Medical Procedures Involving My Own Blood?", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', November 2006, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond Franz has challenged these policies because acceptable blood fractions can only be derived from stored blood provided by donors.&lt;ref&gt;Franz, Raymond. "In Search of Christian Freedom" - [http://www.ajwrb.org/misc/ray.htm Chapter Nine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207134306/http://www.ajwrb.org/misc/ray.htm |date=2006-02-07 }}. Atlanta: Commentary Press, 1991. Pbk. {{ISBN|0-914675-16-8}}. pp.732.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal considerations====
Regardless of the medical considerations, Jehovah Witnesses advocate that physicians should uphold the right of a patient to choose what treatments they do or do not accept (though a Witness is subject to religious sanctions if they exercise their right to choose a blood transfusion).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivanhoe.com/channels/p_channelstory.cfm?storyid=10342 Ivanhoe's Medical Breakthroughs - When Religion and Medicine Collide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125211155/http://www.ivanhoe.com/channels/p_channelstory.cfm?storyid=10342 |date=2005-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, US courts tend not to hold physicians responsible for adverse health effects that a patient incurred out of his or her own requests.&lt;ref name="How Can Blood Save Your Life"/&gt; However, the point of view that physicians must, in all circumstances, abide by the religious wishes of the patients is not acknowledged by all jurisdictions, such as was determined in a [[Jehovah's Witnesses and governments#Other cases|case involving Jehovah's Witnesses in France]].

The situation has been controversial, particularly in the case of children. In the [[United States]], many physicians will agree to explore and exhaust all non-blood alternatives in the treatment of children at the request of their legal guardians. Some state laws require physicians to administer blood-based treatment to minors if it is their professional opinion that it is necessary to prevent immediate death or severe permanent damage.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Even when an adult's life is at stake, some philosophers argue that since blood refusal is based on irrational beliefs, the patient's decision may be challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 1377366 | pmid=9358347 | volume=23 | title=Should informed consent be based on rational beliefs? | journal=J Med Ethics | pages=282–8 | last1 = Savulescu | first1 = J | last2 = Momeyer | first2 = RW | doi=10.1136/jme.23.5.282|quote=we believe that JWs' beliefs are irrational even in terms that should be acceptable to JWs. Firstly, their interpretation is inconsistent with other passages of The Bible and Christian practices. It is inconsistent with the Christian practice of communion. ... Secondly, Paul warns against slavish obedience to law ... Paul himself does not understand The Bible to be literally true, as evidenced when he speaks of the story of the origin of Abraham's sons being "an allegory" ... What is required is rational argument. | year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry Louderback-Wood has claimed that Jehovah's Witnesses' legal corporations are potentially liable to significant claims for compensation if the organization misrepresents the medical risks of blood transfusions. Wood claims that constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion do not remove the legal responsibility that every person or organization has regarding misrepresenting secular fact.&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses, Blood Transfusions and the Tort of Misrepresentation'', Journal of Church and State Vol 47, Autumn 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

====Animal blood====
''The Watchtower'' has stated that "Various medical products have been obtained from biological sources, either animal or human ... Such commercialization of ... blood is hardly tempting for true Christians, who guide their thinking by God's perfect law. Our Creator views blood as sacred, representing God-given life ... blood removed from a creature was to be poured out on the ground, disposed of."&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'' (Feb. 1, 1997) p30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reporting of sexual abuse===
{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses' handling of child sex abuse |Silentlambs}}
Former Jehovah's Witness Bill Bower, founder of [[Silentlambs]], accuses [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] of employing organizational policies of not reporting [[sexual abuse]] cases to authorities to protect the organisation's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silentlambs.org/historyofsl.htm Bill Bowen, "The History of Silentlambs"]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Religioustolerance]] site states that the consequence of keeping the cases secrets is that "there is a very high probability that the abuse will continue."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/witness7.htm "Jehovah's Witnesses (WTS) Handling of Child Sexual Abuse Cases"], ''Religious Tolerance.org'' Retrieved Mar 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Some victims of sexual abuse have asserted that when reporting abuse they were ordered to maintain silence by their local elders to avoid embarrassment to both the accused and the organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/04/29/eveningnews/main551557.shtml "Another Church Sex Scandal"] (Apr. 29, 2003).

The movement's official policy on child protection, which discusses the procedures for reporting child sexual abuse, states that elders obey all legal requirements for reporting sex offenders, including reporting uncorroborated or unsubstantiated allegations where required by law.

While a Witness may lose congregation privileges following a single credible accusation of abuse,&lt;ref&gt;“Let All Things Take Place for Upbuilding”, ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', July 2000, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; Jehovah's Witnesses claim to be scripturally obliged to require corroboration before applying their severest forms of congregational discipline.&lt;ref&gt;"Comfort for Those With a “Stricken Spirit”", ''The Watchtower'', November 1, 1995, page 28, "If the [lone] accusation is denied [by the accused], the elders should explain to the accuser that nothing more can be done in a judicial way. ...The Bible says that there must be two or three witnesses before judicial action can be taken.

==Biblical criticisms==
{{See also|New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures#Critical review}}
The [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Society]] has been criticized for its refusal to reveal the names and academic credentials of the translators of its ''[[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures]]'' (NWT).&lt;ref name="pentonbible"&gt;{{Citation|author=Penton, M. J.|title=Apocalypse Delayed|publisher=University of Toronto Press|edition=2nd|year=1997|pages=174–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society has claimed members of the NWT's translation committee wished to remain anonymous in order to exalt only the name of God,&lt;ref&gt;"New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures", ''The Watchtower'', September 15, 1950, page 320.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Watchtower'' stating that the educational qualifications of the translators were unimportant and that "the translation itself testifies to their qualifications".&lt;ref&gt;Questions from readers, ''The Watchtower'', December 15, 1974, page 767.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raymond Franz]], a former member of the [[Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses|Governing Body]], has claimed that of the four men he says constituted the committee, only one—its principal translator, his uncle [[Frederick William Franz|Frederick Franz]]—had sufficient knowledge of biblical languages to have attempted the project.&lt;ref&gt;In a 1954 court case, Franz was invited to translate a passage of Genesis from English to Hebrew. (Translator's proof, page 102-103). He declined, saying he would not attempt it. Heather and Gary Botting wrongly claim (page 98) he could make no sense of "an elementary passage of Hebrew from Genesis".&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick Franz had studied Greek for two years and was self-taught in Hebrew.&lt;ref name=fred56&gt;{{Citation| last = Franz| first = Raymond| authorlink = Raymond Franz| title = Crisis of Conscience| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| page = 56| isbn = 0-914675-23-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much criticism of the NWT involves the rendering of certain texts considered to be biased towards specific Witness practices and doctrines.&lt;ref name="pentonbible" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Bowman Jr, ''Understanding Jehovah's Witnesses'', (Grand Rapids MI: Baker Book House, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Haas,''Journal of Biblical Literature,'' Vol. 74, No. 4, (Dec. 1955), p. 283, "This work indicates a great deal of effort and thought as well as considerable scholarship, it is to be regretted that religious bias was allowed to colour many passages."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ankerberg&gt;Ankerberg, John and John Weldon, 2003, ''The New World Translation of the Jehovah's Witnesses'', accessible [http://www.johnankerberg.org/Articles/ATRI-Bible-School/Fall-Bible-School/fall-bible-school-jw-new-world-translation.htm online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029043702/http://www.johnankerberg.org/Articles/ATRI-Bible-School/Fall-Bible-School/fall-bible-school-jw-new-world-translation.htm |date=October 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes R, The Challenge of the Cults and New Religions, The Essential Guide to Their History, Their Doctrine, and Our Response, Zondervan, 2001, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M Metzger, "Jehovah's Witnesses and Jesus Christ," Theology Today, (April 1953 p. 74); see also Metzger, "The New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures," The Bible Translator (July 1964)&lt;/ref&gt; These include the use of "torture stake" instead of "cross" throughout the New Testament;&lt;ref name=pentonbible /&gt; the rendering of [[John 1:1]], with the insertion of the indefinite article ("a") in its rendering to give "the Word was ''a'' god";&lt;ref name=pentonbible /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.H. Dodd: "The reason why [the Word was a god] is unacceptable is that it runs counter to the current of Johannine thought, and indeed of Christian thought as a whole."

Also criticized is the NWT's insertion of the name ''[[Jehovah]]'' 237 times in the [[New Testament]] without extant New Testament Greek manuscript evidence that the name existed there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Franz| first = Raymond| authorlink = Raymond Franz| title = In Search of Christian Freedom| publisher = Commentary Press| year = 2007| pages = 494–505| isbn = 0-914675-17-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. HÉBERT/EDS, "Jehovah's Witnesses", ''The New Catholic Encyclopedia,'' Gale, 2005&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, Vol. 7, p. 751.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, Bruce M., The New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures, The Bible Translator 15/3 (July 1964), pp. 150-153.&lt;/ref&gt; Watch Tower publications have claimed that the name was "restored" on a sound basis, stating that when New Testament writers quote earlier Old Testament scriptures containing the [[Tetragrammaton]] (יהוה), "the translator has the right to render [[Kyrios]] ("LORD") as Jehovah."&lt;ref&gt;"God’s Name and the New Testament", ''The Divine Name That Will Endure Forever'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1984, pages 23-27&lt;/ref&gt; The NWT mentions twenty-seven other translations which have similarly rendered ''Kyrios'' as a form of the name ''Jehovah'', stating that there is only one verse where the NWT does so without agreement from other translations.&lt;ref&gt;"Appendix 1D The Divine Name in the Christian Greek Scriptures", ''New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures - With References'', page 1565&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society has claimed its translation "courageously restores God’s name, Jehovah, to its proper place in the Biblical text, is free from the bias of religious traditionalism, and ... gives the literal meaning of God’s Word as accurately as possible."&lt;ref&gt;"Your Bible—How It Was Produced", ''The Watchtower'', December 15, 1981, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jason BeDuhn]], associate professor of religious studies at Northern Arizona University, in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], compared major translations for accuracy. He stated that whilst there are "a handful of examples of bias in the [New World Translation (NW)]", that "most of the differences are due to the greater accuracy of the NW as a literal, conservative translation of the original expressions of the New Testament writers." He also wrote that the NWT's introduction of the name "Jehovah" into the New Testament 237 times was "not accurate translation by the most basic principle of accuracy".&lt;ref&gt;Jason D. BeDuhn, ''Truth in Translation: Accuracy and Bias in English Translations of the New Testament'', 2004, pages 165, 169, 175, 176. BeDuhn compared the ''King James'', the ''(New) Revised Standard'', the ''New International'', the ''New American Bible'', the ''New American Standard Bible'', the ''Amplified Bible'', the ''Living Bible'', ''Today's English'' and the ''NWT'' versions in Matthew 28:9, Philippians 2:6, Colossians 1:15-20, Titus 2:13, Hebrews 1:8, John 8:58, John 1:1.&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that "the NW and [another translation] are not bias free, and they are not perfect translations. But they are remarkably good translations ... often better than [the other six translations analyzed]."&lt;ref&gt;''Truth in Translation: Accuracy and Bias in English Translations of the New Testament'' by Jason BeDuhn, 2004, pages 165, University Press of America, {{ISBN|0-7618-2556-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7618-2556-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his rebuttal, Thomas Howe strongly criticizes BeDuhn's positive review of the ''New World Translation'', stating that the main goal of BeDuhn's book is to deny the deity of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A Howe, ''Bias in New Testament Translations?'', 2010, p. 326 (back cover), "In this critical evaluation, BeDuhn's arguments are challenged and his conclusions called into question." - See also Thomas A. Howe, ''The Deity of Christ in Modern Translations'', 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Desert Mothers''' were female [[Asceticism#Christianity|Christian ascetics]] living in the desert of [[Egypt]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and [[Syria]] in the 4th and 5th centuries AD. They typically lived in the monastic communities that began forming during that time, though sometimes they lived as [[hermits]]. Other women from that era who influenced the early ascetic or monastic tradition while living outside the desert are also described as Desert Mothers.{{sfn|Cardman|2000|p=373}}

The [[Desert Fathers]] are much more well known because most of the early lives of the saints "were written by men for a male monastic audience"{{sfn|King|nd}}—the occasional stories about the Desert Mothers come from the early Desert Fathers and their biographers. Many desert women had leadership roles within the Christian community. The ''[[Apophthegmata Patrum]]'', or ''Sayings of the Desert Fathers'', includes forty-seven sayings that are actually attributed to the Desert Mothers. There are several chapters dedicated to the Desert Mothers in the ''[[Lausiac History]]'' by [[Palladius of Galatia|Palladius]], who mentions 2,975 women living in the desert.{{sfn|King|nd}} Other sources include the various stories told over the years about the lives of saints of that era, traditionally called ''vitae'' ("life").{{sfn|Cardman|2000|pp=373–374}} The lives of twelve female desert saints are described in Book I of ''[[Vitae Patrum]]'' (''Lives of the Fathers'').{{sfn|Beresford|2007|p=10}}

==Notable examples==
[[File:Melania_the_Younger,_nun_of_Rome_(Menologion_of_Basil_II).jpg|thumb|right|[[Melania the Younger]], from the [[Menologion of Basil II]]]]
[[File:Righteous_Syncletica_of_Alexandria_(Menologion_of_Basil_II).jpg|thumb|right|[[Syncletica of Alexandria]] from the [[Menologion of Basil II]]]]
The Desert Mothers were known as ''ammas'' ("spiritual mothers"), comparable to the Desert Fathers (''abbas''), due to the respect they earned as spiritual teachers and directors.{{sfn|Earle|2007|pp=1–2}} One of the most well known Desert Mothers was [[Syncletica of Alexandria|Amma Syncletica of Alexandria]], who had twenty-seven sayings attributed to her in the ''Sayings of the Desert Fathers''. Two other ''ammas'', [[Theodora of Alexandria]] and [[Sarah of the Desert|Amma Sarah of the Desert]], also had sayings in that book. Desert Mothers described in the ''Lausiac History'' include [[Melania the Elder]], [[Melania the Younger]], [[Olympias the Deaconess|Olympias]], [[Saint Paula]] and her daughter [[Eustochium]], and several women whom the author does not name.{{sfn|Cardman|2000|p=374}}

According to written accounts, Amma Syncletica might have been born around AD&amp;nbsp;270, since she is said to have lived to her eighties in about AD&amp;nbsp;350, to wealthy parents in Alexandria and was well educated, including an early study of the writings of Desert Father [[Evagrius Ponticus]]. After the death of her parents, she sold everything she had and gave the money to the poor. Moving outside the city with her blind sister, she lived as a hermit among the tombs outside of Alexandria. Gradually a community of women ascetics grew up around her, who she served as their spiritual mother. Even though she was an ascetic and hermit, Syncletica taught moderation, and that asceticism was not an end in itself.{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|pp=29–32}}

Theodora of Alexandria was the ''amma'' of a monastic community of women near Alexandria. Prior to that, she had fled to the desert disguised as a man and joined a community of monks. She was sought out by many of the Desert Fathers for advice—reportedly [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Bishop Theophilus of Alexandria]] came to her for counsel.{{sfnm |1a1=Earle |1y=2007 |1p=41 |2a1=Swan |2y=2001 |2p=104}}

Sarah of the Desert's sayings indicate that she was a hermit living by a river for sixty years. Her sharp replies to some of the old men who challenged her show a distinctly strong personality.{{sfn|Cardman|2000|p=374}} According to one story, two male anchorites visited her in the desert and decided, "Let's humiliate this old woman." They said to her, "Be careful not to become conceited thinking to yourself: "Look how anchorites are coming to see me, a mere woman." She replied, "According to nature I am a woman, but not according to my thoughts."{{sfn|Forman|2005|p=32}}

Melania the Elder, the daughter of a Roman official, became widowed at a young age and moved to Alexandria, and then to the [[Nitrian Desert]]. She met several of the Desert Fathers, following them in their travels and ministering to them using her own money. At one point she was thrown into prison for supporting them, after several of the Fathers had been banished by the officials in Palestine. She eventually founded a convent in Jerusalem which had about fifty nuns.{{sfn|Palladius|1918}} Her granddaughter, Melania the Younger, was married at the age of thirteen and had two sons, both of whom died at a young age. When she was twenty, she and her husband Pinianus renounced the world, both founding convents and monasteries.{{sfn|Palladius|1918}}

According to [[Averil Cameron]], women were quite prominent in the desert tradition, even though early accounts often leave women nameless. In Cameron’s opinion there is no distinction between the men’s wise sayings and that of Amma Sarah and Amma Syncletia. One text refers to Theodora, who had monks listening to her counsel and asking questions. Some women converted their houses into religious establishments and there were gender-mixed social/religious groups. Women could not obtain ordination as a deacon or a priest.{{sfn|Cameron|1993}}

==Sayings==
*Amma Sarah said, "If I prayed God that all people should approve of my conduct, I should find myself a penitent at the door of each one, but I shall rather pray that my heart may be pure toward all."{{sfn|Swan|2001|p=43}}
*Amma Syncletica said, "In the beginning there are a great many battles and a good deal of suffering for those who are advancing towards God and afterwards, ineffable joy. It is like those who wish to light a fire; at first they are choked by the smoke and cry, and by this means obtain what they seek&amp;nbsp;... so we must also kindle the divine fire in ourselves through tears and hard work."{{sfn|Swan|2001|p=39}}
*Amma Syncletica said, "There are many who live in the mountains and behave as if they were in the town; they are wasting their time. It is possible to be a solitary in one's mind while living in a crowd; and it is possible for those who are solitaries to live in the crowd of their own thoughts."{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=30}}
*Amma Theodora said that neither asceticism, nor vigils, nor any kind of suffering are able to save. Only true humility can do that. There was a hermit who was able to banish the demons. And he asked them: "What makes you go away? Is it fasting?" They replied: "We do not eat or drink." "Is it vigils?" They said: "We do not sleep." "Then what power sends you away?" They replied: "Nothing can overcome us except humility alone." Amma Theodora said: "Do you see how humility is victorious over the demons?"{{sfn|Chryssavgis|2008|p=73}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7194">[[File:Elsőáldozó fortepan 40689.jpg|thumb|A Catholic girl receives First Communion in Hungary.]]

'''First Communion''' is a ceremony in some Christian traditions during which a person first receives the [[Eucharist]]. It is most common in the [[Latin Church]] tradition of the [[Catholic Church]], as well as in many parts of the [[World Lutheran Federation|Lutheran Church]] and [[Anglican Communion]]. In churches that celebrate First Communion, it typically occurs between the ages of seven and thirteen, often acting as a [[rite of passage]].

==Characteristics==
[[File:Prima comunione modificato-1.jpg|thumb|left|A little girl photographed for First Communion in [[Italy]], c. 1919]]

Catholics believe this event to be very important, as the Eucharist occupies a central role in Catholic theology and practice.

First Communion is not celebrated in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches, the [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches, or the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], as they practice [[infant communion]] (which often is simultaneously administered with [[infant baptism]] and [[confirmation]]). Some [[Anglicans]] allow infant communion, while others require the previous reception of confirmation, usually during the teenage years.

Celebration of this ceremony is typically less elaborate in many Protestant churches. Catholics and some Protestants believe that Christ is [[Real Presence|truly present in the Eucharist]], although only Catholics and some Anglo-Catholics of the Anglican Communion believe this is through [[transubstantiation]].

Other denominations have varying understandings, ranging from the Eucharist being a symbolic meal to a meal of remembering Christ's last supper.

==Traditions==
The sacrament of First Communion is an important tradition for Catholic families and individuals. For Catholics, Holy Communion is the third of seven sacraments received. It occurs only after receiving Baptism, and once the person has reached the [[age of reason (canon law)|age of reason]] (usually, around the second grade). First confession (the first [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|sacrament of penance]]) must precede the reception of the Eucharist. This order of the sacraments is practiced universally by all [[Latin rite]] Catholics. In 1910, [[Pope Pius X]] issued the decree ''[[Quam singulari]]'', which changed the age at which First Communion is taken to 7 years old.  Previously, local standards had been 10 or 12 or even 14 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius10/p10quam.htm ''Quam Singulari'']&lt;/ref&gt; Byzantine Catholics (Eastern Rite) celebrate the sacraments of baptism, confirmation (Chrismation), and Holy Communion on the same day as an infant's baptism.

Traditions of celebration surrounding First Communion usually include large family gatherings and parties to celebrate the event. The first communicant wears special clothing. The clothing is often white to symbolize purity, but not in all cultures. Often, a girl wears a fancy dress and a [[veil]] attached to a chaplet of flowers or some other hair ornament. In other communities, girls commonly wear dresses passed down to them from sisters or mothers, or even simply their school uniforms with the veil or wreath. Boys may wear a suit and tie, tuxedo, their Sunday best, or national dress, with embroidered arm bands worn on the left arm and occasionally white gloves.

In many [[Latin America]]n countries, boys wear military-style dress uniforms with gold [[braid]] [[aiguillette]]s. In [[Switzerland]], both boys and girls wear plain white robes with brown wooden [[Christian cross|crosses]] around their necks. In Spain, Germany, Luxembourg, Austria, and [[Guam]], girls are dressed up as little brides, although this has been partly replaced by [[albs]] in recent times.

In [[Scotland]], boys traditionally wear [[kilt]]s and other traditional Scottish dress which accompany the kilt. In the [[Philippines]], First Communion services often occur on or around the Feast of the [[Immaculate Conception]] (the country's [[patron saint]]), with boys donning either the [[Barong Tagalog]] or semi-formal Western dress, and girls a plain white dress and sometimes a veil.

Gifts of a religious nature are usually given, such as [[rosaries]], [[prayer book]]s, religious statues, [[icon]]s, and [[holy card]]s. Monetary gifts are also common.{{r|Kerby (2016)}}

[[File:First communion argentina 1923.jpg|thumb|First Communion photo of a girl in [[Argentina]], 1923]]

Many families have formal professional photographs taken in addition to candid snapshots in order to commemorate the event. Some churches arrange for a professional photographer after the ceremony.

==History==
During the [[communism|communist]] era, initiation into the [[pioneer movement]] in communist countries that had large Catholic populations was an overt attempt to supplant the Catholic ritual (e.g., the [[Union of Pioneers of Yugoslavia]]). In all cases, a child at the age of seven to ten is initiated as a member of a group within which the individuals share certain values and culture.

'''''Frahang-ī Pahlavīg''''' ([[Middle Persian|Middle Persia]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n: 𐭯𐭥𐭧𐭭𐭢 𐭯𐭧𐭫𐭥𐭩𐭪‎‎ "Pahlavi dictionary") is the title of an anonymous [[dictionary]] of unknown date of (mostly) [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] [[Logogram|logograms]] with [[Middle Persian]] translations (in [[Pahlavi script]]) and [[Transliteration|transliterations]] (in [[Pazend]] script).&lt;ref name="West_1904_120"&gt;{{harvnb|West|1904|p=120}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The glossary was previously known to Indian [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] (the [[Parsi people|Parsis]]) as the ''mna-xvatay'' (traditionally pronounced ''mona khoda''), a name derived from the first two words of the first entry/lemma.&lt;ref name="MacKenzie_2001_para1"&gt;{{harvnb|MacKenzie|2001|loc=para. 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Frahang-i Pahlavig'' should not be confused with the ''[[Frahang-i Oim-evak]]'', which is a glossary of [[Avestan language]] terms.


==Manuscripts and interpretations== &lt;!-- This section comes first because references are made below to the MSS --&gt;
The oldest surviving example of a ''Frahang''-like text is a one-page fragment discovered at [[Turpan]] that is believed to date to the 9th or 10th century CE. Several more complete manuscripts exist in Bombay, Oxford, Paris, and Copenhagen, but the oldest of these dates to the 15th century and is missing a second folio and all of folio 28 onwards. In the earliest edition made available to European scholarship, the ''Frahang'' is arranged serially; that is, according to the shape of the [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic characters]]. That edition, obtained by [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Abraham Anquetil-Duperron]] in the mid-18th century, is today in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque nationale]], Paris. In 1867, Hoshangji Jamaspji Asa and [[Martin Haug]] published a transcript of a manuscript that was arranged thematically by chapter.

The existence of similar glossaries from [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian times]] (explaining [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] logograms) led an [[Assyriology|Assyriologist]], Erich Ebeling, to explain that many of the words in the ''Frahang'' were derived from Sumerian or [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]. This led to a number of "far-fetched interpretations,"&lt;ref name="MacKenzie_2001_para5"&gt;{{harvnb|MacKenzie|2001|loc=para. 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which were then subsequently incorporated into a number of later interpretations, including those of Iranists, so effectively making even these unreliable.

==Structure and content==
The glossary encompasses approximately five hundred (not counting variations) [[Semitic language]] [[heterogram (linguistics)|heterograms]] (''huzvarishn'', "probably mean[ing] 'obsoleteness, antiquity, or archaism'"&lt;ref name="West_1904_121"&gt;{{harvnb|West|1904|p=121}}.&lt;/ref&gt;), "in the form used by Zoroastrians in writing Middle Persian (Book Pahlavi), each explained by a "phonetic" writing of the corresponding Persian word."&lt;ref name="MacKenzie_2001_para1"/&gt; Besides heterograms of Aramaic origin, the ''Frahang'' also has a handful of pseudo-heterograms from "Arabic words coined by later scribes" and "scattered examples of historical spellings of [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] words, no longer recognized as such."&lt;ref name="MacKenzie_2001_para5"/&gt; Altogether about 1300 words (including word forms) are represented, "but its original extent appears to have been only 1000 words, excluding the appendices."&lt;ref name="West_1904_120"/&gt; Several heterograms are not attested in any other text.

While the one-page Turpan fragment lists various forms for verbs followed by one Middle Persian translation (in the infinitive), other manuscripts list at most three verb forms, but then provide Middle Persian equivalents of each. The primary elements (logogram(s) and translation) "are then transcribed interlinearly, and more or less corruptly, into [[Avestan alphabet|Avestan letters]], i.e., into [[Pazend|Pāzand]], whereby the heterograms appear in their traditional mnemonic pronunciation. Because of the ambiguity of the Pahlavi script this is often far removed from the original Aramaic spellings."&lt;ref name="MacKenzie_2001_para2"&gt;{{harvnb|MacKenzie|2001|loc=para. 2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the manuscript examined by Asa and Haug, the ''huzvarishn'' and translations are in black, and the Pazend transliterations are in red (the first chapter is an exception, and is entirely in black).

Substituting Latin characters (and written left-to-right) for Pahlavi and Pazend ones (which are written right-to-left), ''Frahang'' glosses look like this:
{| border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" 
|-
| style="background-color:#ccccff;text-align:center;padding:3px" | ''huzvarishn'' heterogram &lt;br /&gt;(Aramaic alphabet, RtL)

| style="border:1px solid #ccccff;text-align:center;" | ''sag''
| style="border:1px solid #ccccff;text-align:center;" |  &lt;span style="color:#600000"&gt;''kalba''&lt;/span&gt; 
| style="background-color:#ccccff;text-align:center;" | "dog"
|-
| style="border:1px solid #ccccff;text-align:center;" | [[Image:Kaph.svg|10px]][[Image:Lamed.svg|10px]][[Image:Mem.svg|10px]]&lt;sup&gt;:= ''MLK''&lt;/sup&gt;
| style="border:1px solid #ccccff;text-align:center;" | ''shāh''
| style="border:1px solid #ccccff;text-align:center;" | &lt;span style="color:#600000"&gt;''malka''&lt;/span&gt;
| style="background-color:#ccccff;text-align:center;" | "king"
|-
| style="border:1px solid #ccccff;text-align:center;" | [[Image:Mem.svg|10px]][[Image:Heth.svg|10px]][[Image:Lamed.svg|10px]]&lt;sup&gt;:= ''LḤM''&lt;/sup&gt;
| style="border:1px solid #ccccff;text-align:center;" | ''nān''
| style="border:1px solid #ccccff;text-align:center;" | &lt;span style="color:#600000"&gt;''laḥma''&lt;/span&gt;
| style="background-color:#ccccff;text-align:center;" | "bread"
|-
|}
Thus, "king" would be written [[Image:Kaph.svg|10px]][[Image:Lamed.svg|10px]][[Image:Mem.svg|10px]] but understood in Iran to be the ''sign'' for 'shāh'.

In the Asa and Haug manuscript, the ''Frahang'' is organized thematically, divided into (approximately) thirty chapters. Eighteen of these chapters have titles (listed below in italics), the others do not. West ends his description at chapter 23 as "no further chapters are indicated."&lt;ref name="West_1904_120"/&gt; The last section/chapter is a collection of older Iranian language words (and variant spellings), with more modern words explaining the older terms.

'''Hinduism''' is a minority faith '''in [[East Timor]]'''. Almost all of them follow [[Balinese Hinduism]]

==History==
Timor has no traditional Hindu population. Hindus are mainly migrants from [[Bali]] who came during the Indonesian occupation. After the end of the occupation, most Hindus left the country.

==Demographics==
In 1992, before the independence of East Timor Hindus constituted 0.5% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Asia-and-Oceania/East-Timor-RELIGIONS.html|title=Religions - East Timor|website=Nationsencyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the occupation,Hinduism decreased to less than 0.1% in East Timor. According to the 2011 census, there are 195 Hindus in East Timor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mof.gov.tl/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Publication-2-English-Web.pdf|format=PDF|title=Population and Housing Census of Timor-Leste, 2010 : Volume 2: Population Distribution by Administrative Areas|website=Mof.gov.tl|accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 2015 Census showed a slight increase in the number of Hindus. According to that census, there were 271 Hindus in East Timor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.tl/category/publications/census-publications/2015-census-publications/|title=2015 - STATISTICS TIMOR-LESTE|website=Statistics.gov.tl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temples==
[[File:Hindu Tempel Dili04.jpg|thumb|[[Pura Girinatha]]]]
'''Pura Girinatha''' is the largest [[Balinese Hinduism|Balinese Hindu]] temple in [[East Timor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebalitimes.com/2009/05/01/pastika-thanks-gusmao-over-dili-temple/|title=Pastika Thanks Gusmao over Dili Temple|date=1 May 2009|website=Thebalitimes.com|accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Berita Bali"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.beritabali.com/read/2016/09/12/201609120008/Pura-Girinatha-SatunyaSatunya-Pura-di-Dili-Timor-Leste.html |title=Pura Girinatha, Satunya-Satunya Pura di Dili Timor Leste |website=Beritabali.com |trans-title=Girinatha Temple, The Only Temple in Dili East Timor |language=Indonesian |date=12 September 2016 |accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temple was built during the Occupation. Now the temple is quite run down,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://binginbanjah.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/pura-di-timor-leste/|title=PURA DI TIMOR LESTE|date=16 March 2011|website=Binginbanjah.wordpress.com|accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some [[Balinese people|Balinese]] from Indonesia and the [[East Timorese]] government have started efforts to revitalize the temple.&lt;ref name = "Berita Bali"/&gt;

The [[Pongal]] celebration of the Malaysian Tamil Hindus were also celebrated in the Pura Giri Natha.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kln.gov.my/web/tls_dili/n2010/-/asset_publisher/ME2g/blog/celebration-of-pongal-sankaranthi-in-dili-timor-leste&lt;/ref&gt;

There is relatively little history of active practice of '''Hinduism in Romania''', although many prominent [[Romania]]n thinkers have had an interest in [[Hindu thought]], and since the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]] there have been some converts.

==Since 1989==

The [[Divine Life Society]] and the [[Vedanta Society]] has a publishing house named Lotus in [[Bucharest]]. They publish  books on Vedic philosophy ([[Vivekananda]], [[Ramacharaka]], [[Krishnananda]]). The leader of Divine Life Society is honorary member A. Russu, accountable to the headquarters in [[Rishikesh]], India.&lt;ref name=Valea&gt;Valea 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transcendental Meditation]] has been in Romania for many years. It was prohibited by the [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] regime, but has flourished again after the revolution, especially among intellectuals. The strongholds of TM are Bucharest and [[Cluj-Napoca]].&lt;ref name=Valea /&gt;

[[ISKCON]] has established small communities at least in [[Bucharest]] and [[Timişoara]]. In the latter city they hold monthly conferences in the Polytechnical Institute.&lt;ref name=Valea /&gt;

ISKCON (the "Hare Krishnas") is the largest Hinduist association in country. &lt;!-- As of what year? Numbers? --&gt;

The [[Theosophical Society]] and the [[Anthroposophical Society]] are represented especially in Bucharest, Timişoara and Cluj. They seldom call themselves by these names, rather they name themselves "Para-Psychological Research groups". Their beliefs are very syncretistic, mixing Eastern beliefs.&lt;ref name=Valea /&gt;

[[Sathya Sai Baba]] devotees are also present in Romania.&lt;ref name=Valea /&gt;

The [[Sahaja Yoga]] movement, is led by a female guru, Sri Mataji Nirvala Devi. The followers of this "instant [[Yoga]]" are numbered by the thousands in about 10 cities.&lt;ref name=Valea /&gt;

==Indians in Romania==

There are currently about 1000 [http://www.mea.gov.in/foreignrelation/romania.htm] Indians living in Romania, most of them in [[Bucharest]] and [[Timişoara]]

[[Muslim]]s in the [[Republic of Macedonia]] follow [[Sunni Islam]] of the [[Hanafi]] [[madhhab]]. Some northwestern and western regions of the country have Muslim majorities. A large majority of all the Muslims in the country are ethnic [[Albanian people|Albanians]], with the rest being primarily [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Romani people|Romani]], [[Bosniaks]] or [[Macedonian Muslims|Torbeš]].

Albanian Muslims, forming roughly 25% of the nation's total population and most of the Muslim population, live mostly in the [[Polog statistical region|Polog]] and western regions of the country. The Turks, who make up about 4% of the country's total population, are scattered throughout the country, but mostly in major cities, as are Roma Muslims. Bosniaks are mostly concentrated within Skopje. [[Macedonian Muslims|Muslims of Macedonian ethnicity]] number roughly 40,000 to 100,000 and can be found in western Macedonia in the [[Centar Župa]], [[Debar]], [[Struga]] and [[Plasnica]] areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nielsen|Akgonul|Alibasic|2009|loc=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical population===
The following table shows the Muslim population and percentage for each given year. The Muslim percentage in Macedonia generally decreased from 1904 to 1961 but began to rise again due to high fertility rate among Muslim families, reaching 33.33% in 2002. According to the 2002 Census, 46.5% of the children aged 0–4 were Muslim.&lt;ref name="stat.gov.mk"&gt;[http://www.stat.gov.mk/publikacii/knigaIX.pdf ''Census of Pupulation, Households and Dwellings in the Republic of Macedonia, 2002'', p. 518]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, 39.3% of the population were Muslim.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''[http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/religious-projection-table/2010/percent/all/ "Religious Composition by Country, 2010-2050"]'' in: ''[[Pew Research Center]]'', Retrieved 10 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;''[http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/countries/republic-of-macedonia#/?affiliations_religion_id=0&amp;affiliations_year=2010&amp;region_name=All%20Countries&amp;restrictions_year=2013 Republic of Macedonia]'', in: ''Pew-Templeton Global Religious Futures'', Retrieved 10 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Islam is predicted to be become the largest religion in the country by 2050, with over half of the country's population adhering to the faith. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/religious-projections-2010-2050/|title=The Future of World Religions: Population Growth Projections, 2010-2050|date=2 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jewish Communist Labour Bund in Poland''' ({{lang-yi|ײדישער קאָמוניסטישנ אַרבעטער בּונד אין פוילין}}), generally referred to as the '''''Kombund''''', was a [[Jew]]ish [[political party]] in [[Poland]]. It was formed in 1922, after a split from the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|General Jewish Labour Bund]] in 1921 (which had seen the emergence of the ''Kombund fraktsie'', 'Communist Bund fraction' inside the Bund).&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Jack Lester. ''Jewish Politics in Eastern Europe: The Bund at 100''. Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2001. p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; The split was provoked by disagreements over whether the Polish Bund should join the [[Communist International]].&lt;ref name="euro"/&gt; At the first Polish Bund conference in 1920 a majority resolution passed, calling for the party to join the Communist International. The decision was never executed however, leading to the split and the formation of Kombund.&lt;ref name="yivo"/&gt; The Kombund was founded in late January 1922, by Communist Bundist groups. The new party affiliated itself to the Communist International, adopting the [[twenty-one conditions]].&lt;ref name="poll"&gt;Johnpoll, Bernard K. ''The Politics of Futility; The General Jewish Workers Bund of Poland, 1917-1943''. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1967. p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Around 25% of the Bund membership in Poland joined the Kombund.&lt;ref name="bund1"/&gt;

According to one account, around 50% of the Bundist membership in [[Łódź]] had joined Kombund. The local Bundist newspaper, ''[[Lodzer veker]]'', was taken over by Kombund.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Jack Lester. ''Jewish Politics in Eastern Europe: The Bund at 100''. Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2001. p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the split, the Bund and Kombund began fighting over control of [[trade union]]s. Important leaders of the textile, leather and paper workers' unions had sided with the Kombund in the split. The leather workers' union was seized by Kombund, soon to be followed by the clothing workers' union.&lt;ref name="poll"/&gt;

Kombund published ''Unser Gedenk'' ('Our Thought') from Łódź.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_46613_204.pdf Leksikon fun Yiddish Shraybers]''. p. 379&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the foundation of the Kombund, negotiations began with the [[Communist Party of Poland]] regarding a merger between the two parties. In September the final decision was taken on the Kombund's merger into the Polish Communist Party. Just before the merger, the Kombund has suffered setbacks in trade union elections in Łódź and [[Cracow]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnpoll, Bernard K. ''The Politics of Futility; The General Jewish Workers Bund of Poland, 1917-1943''. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1967. pp. 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the merger, the Polish Communist Party established its [[Central Jewish Bureau, Communist Party of Poland|Central Jewish Bureau]].&lt;ref name="euro"&gt;Campbell, Joan.

The '''''Jewish Tribune''''' is a privately owned [[Haredi]] weekly newspaper based in [[Stamford Hill]] with offices in Golders Green, [[London]] and Manchester. Founded in 1962, it appears in newspaper form every Thursday, (and NOT on the internet) providing up to date news from UK Jewish community and Israel along with views, social and cultural reports. It also contains editorials and a spectrum of readers' opinions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ggbh.org.uk/pdf/Rabbi%20Greenberg%20-%20Jewish%20Tribune.pdf Jewish Tribune]&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign, military and diplomatic correspondent James J. Marlow writes the Middle East articles including features with analysis and matters concerning British Politics.  Senior UK political and Manchester correspondent is Bezalel Cohen. Eminent historian Dr Yaakov Wise is a contributor.
With a claimed circulation of over 2800 copies being sold each week, the paper is the fifth largest Jewish paper in England after ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'', the ''[[Jewish News]]'', the ''[[Jewish Telegraph]]'' and ''[[Hamodia]]'' and is the third oldest continuously published Jewish newspaper in England.

The ''Jewish Tribune'' is published by [[World Agudath Israel|Agudath Israel of Great Britain]].

It is the only newspaper published in the UK to have a section in [[Yiddish]].

In August 2010, rumours circulated that the newspaper would fold following the [[Rosh Hashana]] edition but the newspaper surmounted its problems and continues to publish.

{{Commons category|Kanjō}}

{{nihongo|'''Kanjō'''|勧請}} in [[Shinto]] terminology indicates a propagation process through which a ''[[kami]]'', previously divided through a process called ''[[bunrei]]'', is invited to another location and there reenshrined.&lt;ref name="Smyers147"/&gt;

== Evolution of the ''kanjō'' process ==
''Kanjō'' was originally a [[Buddhist]] term and later entered the Shinto vocabulary.&lt;ref name="Smyers147"&gt;Smyers (1999:235)&lt;/ref&gt; A ''kanjō'' was the request of the Buddha's sermon with a sincere heart, and later came to mean the urging of a [[Nyorai|buddha]] or [[bosatsu|bodhisattva]] to remain in this world to preach and save other human beings.&lt;ref name="Smyers147"/&gt; The concept then evolved further to mean the act (and the actual words) of asking buddhas or bodhisattvas to descend to the altar during a Buddhist service.&lt;ref name="Smyers147"/&gt; In Japan, the word gradually assumed the present meaning of enshrinement of a ''buddha'' or ''kami'' in a building for the first time.&lt;ref name="Smyers147"/&gt;

==The ''kanjō'' process ==
Before it can be transferred to its new location the ''kami'' must be divided.{{fact|date=August 2018}} The division sub-process and the divided spirit itself are called {{nihongo|''bunrei''|分霊}}, {{nihongo|''go-bunrei''|御分霊}} or {{nihongo|''wakemitama''|分霊}}.&lt;ref name="Smyers147"/&gt;　The process of propagation, described by the priests as akin to the lighting of a candle from another already lit, leaves the original ''kami'' intact in its original place and therefore doesn't alter any of its properties.&lt;ref name="Smyers147"/&gt; The ''wakemitama'' has all the qualities of the original and is therefore "alive" and permanent.&lt;ref name="Smyers147"/&gt; The process is used often, for example during Shinto festivals (''[[Matsuri]]'') to animate temporary shrines called {{nihongo|''mikisho''|神酒所}} and their ''[[mikoshi]]''.&lt;ref name="sonoda12"&gt;Sonoda (1975:12)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inari kanjō ===
The ''kami'' Inari has been subjected to the ''kanjō'' process more often than any other ''kami'',&lt;ref name="Smyers156"&gt;Smyers (1999: 156-160)&lt;/ref&gt; and is therefore a good example of its use.

The transfer does not necessarily take place from a shrine to another: the new location can be a privately owned object or an individual house. The case is recorded of Inari being re-enshrined in a [[kitsune|fox]] hole&lt;ref name="Smyers156"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The fox is Inari's symbol.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the first recorded [[Inari Ōkami|Inari]] ''kanjō'', in 842, involved the ''kami'''s transfer to [[Ono no Takamura]] scepter.&lt;ref name="Smyers156"/&gt; The ''kami'' was then transported to Mutsu no Kuni (Aomori) by its owner.&lt;ref name="Smyers156"/&gt; Some years later he returned to [[Kyoto]], and Aomori's people asked him to leave the spirit behind, which he did in what would become Takekoma Inari.&lt;ref name="Smyers156"/&gt;

In 1194, Emperor [[Go-Toba]] decided that only [[Fushimi Inari Shrine]] could perform any of the parts of the Inari ''kanjō'', however abuses were such that the shrine started providing an authenticity certificate with each divided spirit.&lt;ref name="Smyers156"/&gt;  The process was briefly outlawed nationwide during the Meiji era, but was brought back by popular demand and nowadays most large Inari shrines will perform it for a fee, sometimes decided by the shrine, sometimes left to the discretion of the worshiper.&lt;ref name="Smyers156"/&gt; As of 1990, Fushimi Inari Shrine had performed it eighty thousand times for private citizens.
&lt;ref name="Smyers156"/&gt; The faithful are often given the option to give a personal name to their personal ''kami''. At [[Toyokawa Inari]] the worshiper can buy a statue and then participate in the ceremony, called ''[[kaigen]]'', to animate it.&lt;ref name="Smyers156"/&gt;

When one of Inari's forms is reenshrined with a different name, it may also be worshiped for a specific function.&lt;ref name="Smyers156"/&gt; All the new functions are thereafter assumed to be specialties of the ''kami'', particularly in case of a great success in the reenshrinement, even when those functions are very far from its original nature, as for instance fishing is in Inari's case.&lt;ref name="Smyers156"/&gt;

{{Jainism}}
In [[Jainism]], '''Kashaya''' (loose translation: ''Passion'') are aspects of a person that can be gained during his or her worldly life. According to the Jaina religion as long as a person has Kashayas, they will not escape the cycle of life and death. There are four different kind of Kashayas, each being able to gain their own kinds of intensity.

== Overview ==
According to the Jain text, ''[[Sarvārthasiddhi]]'', "He who has passions causes injury to himself by himself. Whether injury is then caused to other living beings or not, it is immaterial."{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=197}}

Spiritually, the goal of Jainism is to rid oneself of the worldly life and become free from the cycle of [[reincarnation]]. When one develop attachment or passions, this hinders the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] progress of their soul. Jainas believe that by reacting without passion and staying tranquil, one can break the cycle which forms more karma.

==The Four Kashayas==
{{further|Causes of Karma}}
The four ''kasaya'' are: ''krodha'' (anger), ''lobha'' (greed), ''mana'' (ego) and ''maya'' (deceit). Out of the many causes of bondage, emotions or passions are considered as the main cause of ''[[Bandha (Jainism)|bandha]]'' or bondage. The [[Karma in Jainism|karmas]] are literally bound on account of the stickiness of the soul due to existence of various passions or mental dispositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =The Jaina Path of Purification | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass | year =1998 | location =New Delhi | isbn =81-208-1578-5 }} p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The passions like anger, pride, deceit and greed are called sticky (''kaṣāyas'') because they act like glue in making karmic particles stick to the soul resulting in ''bandha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Reichenbach  | first =Bruce  | title =Karma, Causation, and Divine Intervention  | journal =Philosophy East and West  | volume =39  | issue =2  | pages =135–149  | publisher =University of Hawai press  | date =April 1989  | jstor =1399374| doi =10.2307/1399374 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The karmic inflow on account of ''yoga'' driven by passions and emotions cause a long term inflow of karma prolonging the cycle of reincarnations. On the other hand, the karmic inflows on account of actions that are not driven by passions and emotions have only a transient, short-lived karmic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Tatia | first = Nathmal | title =Tattvārtha Sūtra: That Which Is of Vācaka Umāsvāti | publisher =Rowman Altamira | year =1994 | location =Lanham, MD | language =Sanskrit, English | isbn =0-7619-8993-5 }} p.152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Kuhn | first =Hermann | title =Karma, The Mechanism : Create Your Own Fate | publisher =Crosswind Publishing | year =2001 | location =Wunstorf, Germany | isbn =3-9806211-4-6 }} p.33&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the ancient Jain texts talk of subduing these negative emotions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Johnson | first =W.J. | title =Harmless souls: karmic bondage and religious change in early Jainism with special reference to Umāsvāti and Kundakunda | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publishers| year =1995 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-208-1309-X }}  p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Negating kashayas can be done by remembering the opposites of kasahayas : Opposite of Krodha (Anger) is Kshama (Forgiveness). To avoid Krodha kashayas, one needs to remember to forgive. Opposite of lobha (greed) is Daan (Charity), one needs to remember to give away. Opposite of Mana(Ego)  is humility, one needs to be humble. Opposite of Deceit is honesty, one needs to be honest in all conditions to not get deceit kashayas. 

Most difficult Kashaya to overcome is Greed. 

When he wishes that which is good for him, he should get rid of the four faults—anger, pride, deceit and greed—which increase the evil. Anger and pride when not suppressed, and deceit and greed when arising: all these four black passions water the roots of re-birth.

—''Daśavaikālika sūtra, 8:36–39''

==Levels Of Intensity==
* Anantanubadh ('''Extremely Severe''') - This holds back one's ability to have correct beliefs/proper conduct.
* Apratyakhanavarana ('''Severe''') -  This holds back partial renunciation but does not affect true belief. While it is active, one cannot take partial vows.
* Pratyakhanavarana ('''Moderate''') - This holds back total renunciation, but does not affect correct belief and partial renunciation. While it is active, partial renunciation is possible, but monkhood is not.
* Sanjvalana ('''Slight'''): This holds back the attainment of total correct conduct, but does not affect right belief and monkhood. While it is active, initiation into monkhood and spiritual progress are possible, but becoming a [[vitragi]] is not.

The degrees of strength of the kasayas are illustrated by examples. The 4 species of anger are to be likened unto a line drawn in stone, in earth, in dust and in water. The first can only be removed with great effort, each following one always more easily. Likewise also, the lifelong enduring anger is only combated in its effect with exceeding strength and difficulty whilst the effect of the three remaining species accordingly diminishes in power and can, therefore, also more easily be destroyed. The degrees of pride are to be likened unto a pillar of stone, a bone, a piece of wood, and the vine of a creeper; the inflexibility correspondingly decreases. The species of deceitfulness are to be compared to a bamboo root, the horn of a ram, the urine of a cow, and a piece of wood. The crookedness of each of these is removed more easily than in the one preceding it. (The zig zag line of the cow's urine disappears through the influence of wind and weather.) The degrees of greed correspond to scarlet colour, to greater or smaller dirt, and to a spot of turmeric, which soil a garment: the scarlet is hardly removable, the dirt with more or less trouble, and the spot of turmeric can be removed with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Glasenapp | first =Helmuth Von | editor =H.

==Early life and career==
[[File:KNIFER.png|thumb|Sotelo at his 2017 photo shoot on Whittier Boulevard in East L.A.]] Sotelo was born in [[East Los Angeles, California]] to Valentino Sotelo, a security guard who owned several gun dealerships, and Betty Sotelo, a dietary supervisor. Before dropping out of [[Garfield High School (California)|Garfield High School]] his parents supported his musical interests, as he tried a number of instruments; his favorites were the guitar and keyboards. As a teenager, Sotelo frequently ran into trouble with the law. He is a member of the "Juarez Maravilla" street gang in the [[Eastside Los Angeles|Eastside]] of Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bookreadermagazine.com/featured-author-marvin-knife-sotelo/|title=Featured Author Marvin "Knife" Sotelo|date=20 April 2015|website=bookreadermagazine.com|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.axs.com/the-story-behind-rapper-knifer-s-occult-overtones-79326|title=The story behind rapper Knifer's occult overtones|first=|last=Ryan Stabile|date=22 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2017|via=AXS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sotelo released several pre-gangsta demos with his band on Los Angeles-based punk label [[Epitaph Records]]. He made his professional debut as a rap artist in 2005 as a tribute to his rival [[Frost (rapper)|Kid Frost]] and although he is known as a [[Chicano]] rapper,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; he is of [[Filipino people|Filipino]] and [[Spaniard]] descent.&lt;ref name="sleepingbagstudios.ca"/&gt;

In 2006, Sotelo was ordained into the [[Universal Life Church]], and subsequently helped set up the first Satanic branch of the church called The Satanic Chapel.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://satanicchapel.org/|title=The Satanic Chapel|first=|last=Satanic Chapel|date=14 August 2015|website=satanicchapel.org|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from being a former member of several organizations including [[Anton Szandor LaVey]]'s [[Church of Satan]], the [[Typhonian Order|Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis]], [[Order of Nine Angles]] and [[The Satanic Temple]], Sotelo would earn the title Ambassador of the [[Theistic Satanism#Currents within recent and contemporary theistic Satanism|{{Proper name|Sinagogue}} of Satan]] by the founder Michael Shane Margolin and acts as a liaison to the Philippines and all Spanish-speaking countries,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sinagogueofsatan.org&lt;/ref&gt; a title which he would occasionally use in interviews with print media and his tours. That same year Sotelo was picked up by an independent record label called A Dark Philosophy Records, which held Finnish metal band {{ill|Azazel (band)|lt=Azazel|fi|Azazel (yhtye)}} at one time, and soon released So Satan and followed up the album three years later with Morals &amp; Dogma. Though ADP Records did not push the album, it gained infamy when radio stations [[KPCC]]-FM (89.3) of Pasadena, California was fined $23,700 by the FCC for playing Sotelo's rendition of [[MC5]]'s [[Kick Out the Jams (song)|Kick Out the Jams]] and a similar incident five years later when [[WRSO|WEUS]] 810 AM (The Big 810 AM) of Orlando, Florida played Sotelo's version of "We're All In The Same Gang" for its 24th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://knifermusick.com/post/99007936348|title=BIG 810 AM|website=edtyllshow.com/|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, he was featured on two songs off of Ghetto 187's debut album "Return Of the G-Funk Era" which featured appearances from [[Bloods &amp; Crips]], Mr. Chuko and [[O.Y.G Redrum 781]] from the [[Damu Ridas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://play.spotify.com/album/1QDKS9IMRmDxbmGpaH9SAa?play=true|title=Spotify|website=play.spotify.com|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year he also released his first book ''The Condensed Satanic Bible'', which explain the views of his satanist beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-condensed-satanic-bible-knife-sotelo/1106911594?type=eBook|title=The Condensed Satanic Bible|first=Barnes &amp;|last=Noble|website=Barnes &amp; Noble|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his career, Sotelo has collaborated with fellow Chicano rappers like [[X-Raided]]'s Mr. Lil Man and mainstream artists such as [[WC (rapper)|WC]], [[Rittz]] and [[Honey Cocaine]].

Sotelo was the subject of numerous articles in news media throughout the world, including popular magazines such as [[The San Francisco Examiner]], [[Music Connection]], and [[Teen Ink]], and men's magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teenink.com/reviews/hot_new_releases/article/p1f853599fa48288c/Satanic-Combat-Sciences-by-Marvin-Knife-Sotelo/|title=Teen Ink Magazine|website=teenink.com/|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novelist [[Kenneth Grant]] described Sotelo as "A Satanic Buddhist", with comedian and radio personality [[Edward Tyll|Ed Tyll]] describing him as "A business man...his charitable nature benefited such organizations as Music For Hope and United Colors, some of those donations lived through his anonymity, others took on a life of their own."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://knifermusick.com/post/80699653763|title=The Ed Tyll Show|website=edtyllshow.com/|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, his fame had been shortly sidetracked after multiple charges with the law, most notably in 2013 when sheriffs searched his home with possession of illegal firearms and marijuana. After being released from confinement, Sotelo worked hard to get his life back on track by continuing to create and write music about his experiences with crime and the law.

In 2014, he signed a distribution deal with [[Universal Music Group]] and soon released his debut album "Me Against The World" which featured collaborations with artists such as [[Bloods &amp; Crips]] and [[Dresta]]. His single, "I Wish You Would" gained rotation on radio stations throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noisetrade.com/filerro/me-against-the-world|title="Knife" Sotelo : Me Against The World - Free Music Download|website=noisetrade.com|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Tyll]] sponsored Sotelo's version of "We're All In The Same Gang" on [[WRSO|WEUS]] 810 AM (The Big 810 AM) and the Star Com Radio Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://knifermusick.com/post/99007936348|title=BIG 810 AM|website=edtyllshow.com|access-date=2016-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 he released his sophomore album "Magick Without Words" which featured appearances from [[Davina (R&amp;B singer)|Davina]] and Av LMKR. The album's single "Green Tea" wasn't promoted and only charted at No. 87 on the indie charts. The album at this point had sold just under 2 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noisetrade.com/filerro/magick-without-words|title="Knife" Sotelo : Magick Without Words - Free Music Download|website=noisetrade.com|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year Sotelo composed ''Liber Cultris'', a gospel in which he expounds upon various religious texts of cultures past, including [[Jesus Christ]], [[Buddha]], and [[Lucifer]]. Sotelo authored it for his own satisfaction, supporting the Catholic faith as he saw it. Larry Wessel states, "He did not produce his small book to shock or offend a drowsy world; he composed it for himself, for his devotion, for his assurance."

In 2016, he released his third studio album "The Much Requested Letter" with "Playa" as its lead single. This was his first mainstream album available for download from iTunes and had a few guest features like [[Bizzy Bone]] and [[Chris Rivers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noisetrade.com/filerro/the-much-requested-letter|title="Knife" Sotelo : The Much Requested Letter - Free Music Download|website=noisetrade.com|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year he released his book ''Satanic Combat Sciences''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Satanic-Combat-Sciences-Knife-Sotelo/dp/1365232948|title=Satanic Combat Sciences|first=Knife"|last=Sotelo|date=10 August 2016|publisher=Lulu.com|accessdate=16 May 2017|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 he signed a deal with [[Sugo Music Group]].&lt;ref name="facebook.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/knifer.sotelo/posts/1618906931483310|title="Knife" Sotelo|website=www.facebook.com|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year he dropped his fourth studio album "Gangster &amp; The Priest". Released Christmas Day through his own A Dark Philosophy Records (selling 400,000 copies in the US), along with the first single, "The Arrival", produced by [[DJ Hoppa]] and featuring guest vocals by B-Luv.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://noisetrade.com/filerro/gangster-the-priest/|title="Knife" Sotelo : Gangster &amp; The Priest|website=noisetrade.com|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sotelo wrote to Michael Margolin: “My reputation in East L.A. is built upon one minuscule volume of verses, and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in a year. The only thing that matters is that these should be impeccable in their kind, so that each should be an event.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/a-spirit-of-progress-knife-sotelo/1129731099?ean=9781987003505|title=Introduction of A Spirit of Progress|first=Knife”|last=Sotelo|date=31 October 2018|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|accessdate=31 October 2018|via=Barnes &amp; Noble}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, Sotelo first published his poems individually in periodicals or in small books or online, and then collected them and released his first collection entitled ''A Spirit of Progress and Other Poems'' in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/a-spirit-of-progress-knife-sotelo/1129731099?ean=9781987003505|title=A Spirit of Progress|first=Knife”|last=Sotelo|date=31 October 2018|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|accessdate=31 October 2018|via=Barnes &amp; Noble}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, "Knife" Sotelo also promotes and sponsors live Satanic events, shows and concerts. He also hosts a weekly radio show in Los Angeles.

===Modeling===

Sotelo first began modeling in 2010, making his foray into the world of [[street fashion]] working in the street-wear and [[lowrider]] automotive scene as a print and spokesmodel for several companies, magazines and race events. His first mainstream magazine shoot was with ''Alwayz Therro Magazine'' in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.alwayztherro.com/rated-next-marvin-knife-sotelo/|title=Rated Next: Marvin "Knife" Sotelo|publisher=Alwayztherro.com |date=2016-09-01 |accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fighting and martial arts ===
Sotelo took an interest in [[martial arts]] when he was in elementary school, he took a few lessons in [[Taekwondo]] and held the rank of Junior [[Kyū]],&lt;ref name="wwmaa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwmaa.org/wwmaa-online-database/#membership-directory/view-member-details/593191d5bc104c4bb535066a|title= United States Martial Arts Association |website=www.wwmaa.org|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sotelo also had a brief stint in professional [[mixed martial arts]] with the [[International Fight League]] and was scheduled to fight against Ryan McGivern on April 29, 2006, at the IFL: Legends Championship in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. However, Sotelo opted out of the fight and was replaced by [[Amir Rahnavardi]] since he did not appreciate the match getting changed from an MMA fight to an exhibition match with stipulations, and because he felt that an exhibition match where both fighters are declared winners was "meaningless," disenfranchised with the IFL he left and began training in [[Arnis]] under master Jaime "Jim" Sotelo ("Knife" Sotelo's associate, no relation), the head instructor of the Sotelo Arnis Self-Defense Club which is affiliated with [[List of Arnis systems and practitioners|Lapunti Arnis de Abanico]] (LAPUNTI). He would later go on and attain his sixth-degree black belt in [[Arnis]], orange belt in [[Krav Maga]] and he would also teach [[Jeet Kune Do]] to a small group of students. With his knowledge of many different styles and combat sports that include [[Boxing]], [[Wrestling]], [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]], [[Muay Thai]], [[Chun Kuk Do]], &amp; [[Kata]], Sotelo collected applications he deemed practical, modified them with his own philosophies and created his own blend of combat science. In June 2017 Sotelo took the position of Grade 2 Representative, holding control over the World International Martial Arts Association and Organization (WIMAAO) operations for Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref name="worldinternationalmartialarts.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldinternationalmartialarts.com/news-2017/4593476557|title=WIMAAO|website=amazon.com|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art ===
Sotelo's work as a photographer, graphic artist, musician/composer and writer are heavily influenced by the mystical and magical traditions he has lived and edified. Stylistically, he gravitated at a blooming age to artists and mentors whose art was additionally imbued by a non-traditional vision, Sotelo was one of the eleven member-artists of the "Unpop Art Movement" created by Shaun Partridge, Brian M. Clark, and [[Boyd Rice]] in 2004. Rice who is also a musician, encouraged Sotelo to pursue his art. Unpop disbanded as an "art movement" in 2010. Sotelo now calls his art Celebritarian, an [[art movement]] started by his mentor [[Marilyn Manson]]. He states Celebritarianism would be, ironically, a satire of today's civilization; It would be about dying when everyone's watching; doing anything for fame. Sotelo revealed an art installation in 2016 entitled ''#RedSandProject'', a [[guerilla art]] exhibition showcased at the East L.A. Art Walk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fineartamerica.com/pressreleases/red-sand-on-east-la-art-walk-began-as-a-guerilla-act.html|title=Red Sand On East L.A. Art Walk Began As A Guerilla Act|website=fineartamerica.com|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the artist collaborated on with Molly Gochman. Sotelo has also become ardently involved in the [[Inside Out Project]], a global participatory art project aimed at conveying a sense of hope and pride.

=== Other ventures ===
Sotelo launched "Ginger &amp; Mary", his own brand of THC-rich infused [[ginger beer]], which has received mixed reviews; some critics described the taste as being "just plain ordinary", other reviewers, such as critics at Food and Beverage Magazine, have given the beer moderately high praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fb101.com/2015/08/ginger-or-mary-ann-or-was-it-mary-jane/ |title=Ginger or Mary Ann?

* "Joker Brand Clothing"

==Religious groups==
Baptized in his youth to the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Sotelo is a self-identified fan of [[Anton LaVey]] and also an advocate of the writings of Michael S. Margolin and [[Aleister Crowley]] saying "I also like Margolin and Crowley," and quoting Margolin throughout his books. Margolin's hermetic subject matter forms an important leitmotif in much of Sotelo's early work. Sotelo also has a close association with [[Diane Hegarty|Diane LaVey]]'s grandson Stanton LaVey and even helped out a couple of times throughout Stanton's career. Sotelo has been seen as one of "the highest profile Satanist's ever" with strong [[Anti-Catholicism|Anti-Catholic]] views and social [[Cannabis and religion|cantheistic]] leanings. In many interviews he referenced his conversion to [[Sōtō|Sōtō Zen Buddhism]] in the [[Dōgen|Eihei Dogen Kigen Zenji]] lineages, as well as his status as Ambassador of the {{Proper name|Sinagogue}} of Satan.

===Church of Satan===
In 2005, Sotelo became a member of the Church of Satan, and resigned only 2 months later over his dissatisfaction with the direction in which [[Peter H. Gilmore]] was taking the Church – and according to his own claim – he joined the {{Proper name|Sinagogue}} of Satan the very next day. During this period, Sotelo made friends with a number of known Satanists like [[Zeena LaVey]]'s son Stanton Zaharoff LaVey, Szandora LaVey, Larry Wessel, [[Boyd Rice]] and [[Marilyn Manson]].

===Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis===
With inspiration from his religious instructor Michael S. Margolin, Sotelo thought the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]], the order [[Aleister Crowley]] entrusted his legacy to, seemed a likely choice. However this was not the case, he had noticed that degrees would be given in exchange for financial or other contributions to the Order, Sotelo was disillusioned and instead joined the [[Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis]] seeing a common middle-ground since due to the situation prevalent at the time, however, and [[Karl Germer]] not being - on his own admission - the O.H.O., the supposed expulsion of [[Kenneth Grant]] must be considered invalid. More to the point, though, it is surely irrelevant to Sotelo. He would stay with the [[Typhonian Order]] until 2011 after Grant's death and ultimately ending with the organization shifting from a formal hierarchy to a less hierarchical structure.

===Order of Nine Angles===
Sotelo began to pursue other Satanic religious practices and became an associate of the [[Order of Nine Angles]] and remained a member of it until 2013. Sotelo, using Dr. Monette's words, described the ONA as "a fascinating blend of both Hermeticism and [[Traditional Satanism]], with some [[pagan]] elements". Sotelo stated that he can relate to the terms Drecc and Niner which in ONA terminology refer to folk-based or gang-based culture or individuals who support the Order's aims by practical (including criminal) means rather than esoteric ones.{{sfn|Monette|2013|p=89}} White Star Acception being one of those groups accused to have perpetrated rapes, assaults, and robberies in order to advance the group's power. Dr. Monette noted that the reality of these actions has not been verified. He has since resigned from the organization.

===The Satanic Temple===
He would also become a member of [[The Satanic Temple]] in 2014 only to become disenfranchised. He had nevertheless developed concerns about The Satanic Temple, feeling that it had attracted many "hipster-adherents, ego-militant maniacs and assorted oddballs whose primary intrigues to becoming Satanists was to flash their membership cards." He resigned from the organization on September 29, 2016.

==Feuds==
Sotelo was in conflict with [[Serio (rapper)|Serio]] (CEO of [[Serio Controla Records]]), [[Lil Rob]], and Mr. Criminal. Mr. Criminal would malign Sotelo on, "It's Murder". The song was from the album ''Only the Strong Survive''. One of the reasons why Sotelo had problems with Serio was because Sotelo's producer B-Rae claimed that Serio was not from [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Sotelo claimed that he was from Los Angeles. Sotelo felt that Serio was lying to everyone about being raised in [[Yakima, Washington]]. In 2010, Sotelo would speak ill towards Serio, on the song "Who Do I Catch Slip" featuring B-Rae.

==Activism==
===Animal rights===

Sotelo is an animal rights supporter. One of Sotelo's campaigns as a member of the [[International Society for Animal Rights]] has been against the [[cruelty to animals]]. In April 2012, Sotelo was asked to speak at the [[Olvera_Street#Blessing_of_the_Animals|Blessing of the Animals]], hosted by the Olvera Street Merchants Association, a tradition held since the 1930s, stating that even Satanists seems to smile a little at the idea of the tradition. "As Satanists we respect and exalt life," Sotelo said. "Animals are the purest expressions of that life force, and as such are held sacred and precious."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogdowntown.com/2012/04/6673-blessing-of-the-animals-celebrates-gods-creations "Blessing of the Animals celebrates God's creations on Olvera Street Saturday"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408200306/http://blogdowntown.com/2012/04/6673-blessing-of-the-animals-celebrates-gods-creations |date=}}.

===Cannabis reform===

Sotelo had repeatedly supported the legalization of [[cannabis]] and in May 2014 announced that he would be a sponsor to [[Americans for Safe Access]], a [[Washington, D.C.]]-based organization working to ensure safe and legal [[Medical cannabis in the United States|access to cannabis]] for therapeutic uses and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rapper Activist?|url=https://article.wn.com/view/2016/03/12/Knife_Sotelo_descendant_of_Luis_Sotelo_is_leading_the_rap_re/|accessdate=April 1, 2014|newspaper=World News and San Francisco Examiner|date=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gun rights===
Sotelo has been highly vocal in the [[right to keep and bear arms|right to bear arms]] and opposition to [[gun control]] measures that have emerged since his congressional campaign such as [[California Proposition 63 (2016)|California Proposition 63]], the [[Gun laws in California|bullet button and refined definition of a "fixed magazine"]], and numerous other gun control measures on the local, state, and federal level, but while performing he instructs venues to not allow firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sleepingbagstudios.ca/knife-sotelo/|title="Knife" Sotelo - Sleeping Bag Studios|website=sleepingbagstudios.ca|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22%22Knife%22+Sotelo%22?Ntk=P_key_Contributor_List&amp;Ns=P_Sales_Rank&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall|title="Knife" Sotelo - Barnes &amp; Noble®|first=Barnes &amp;|last=Noble|website=Barnes &amp; Noble|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
In 2015 he made headlines when he announced that he would officially be running for a seat on the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] for the [[Grassroots-Legalize Cannabis Party|Grassroots Party]] in the state of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestadsontv.com/ad/74071/Marvin-Sotelo-for-Congress-Marvin-Sotelo-for-Congress|title=Marvin Sotelo for Congress|website=bestadsontv.com|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Being a [[perennial candidate]] he ultimately lost the race and on September 21, 2016, he formally ended his congressional campaign, but said he intends to run again.

In August 2017, Sotelo announced that he would seek election to the United States Senate in the 2018 election. 

In October 2017, Sotelo stated his support for [[alt-lite]] activists and conspiracy theorists [[Gavin McInnes]] and [[Milo Yiannopoulos]] after McInnes and Yiannopoulos were criticized in an [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) report. Sotelo accused the ADL of being a "witchhunt group" and posted "that the ADL are no more better than the groups they demonize, the same group who claimed the [[Jewish Defense League]] consists of nothing but thugs and hooligans."&lt;ref name=lauro&gt;Bohn, Michael K. ''The Achille Lauro Hijacking''. 2004, pp. 176–7&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of Anglican churches''' that are notable as congregations or as church buildings or both.

The '''Anglican Communion''' is an international association of churches consisting of the [[Church of England]] and of national and regional [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches (and a few other episcopal churches) in [[full communion]] with it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stfrancisooltewah.org/id4.html |title=St Francis of Assisi Episcopal Church History |publisher=Stfrancisooltewah.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no single "Anglican Church" with universal juridical authority as each national or regional church has full autonomy.  Some of these churches are known as Anglican, such as the [[Anglican Church of Canada]], due to their historical link to England (''Ecclesia Anglicana'' means "English Church"). Some, for example the [[Church of Ireland]], the [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Scottish]] and [[Episcopal Church (United States)|American]] Episcopal churches, and some other associated churches have a separate name.

In the United States the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], also known formally as the "Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America", is the Anglican church; it separated from the Church of England following the American Revolution. In Scotland the [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopal Church]] is also the name for the Anglican church.

Architect [[Richard Upjohn]] advocated the use of [[Carpenter Gothic]] style for rural Episcopalian churches in the United States through his 1852 pattern book ''Rural Architecture'', and there are numerous examples.&lt;ref&gt;A rare counter-example of a different denomination using this style is the [[Congregational Church of Blair]] in Nebraska.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc&gt;{{cite web |url={{NRHP url|id=79001457}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Congregational Church of Blair |author=Penelope Chatfield |date=1979 |publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NRHP url|id=79001457|title=accompanying photos|photos=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous Methodist Episcopal churches which are not part of the Anglican church;  see [[List of Methodist churches]] for these.

The '''Lord's New Church Which Is Nova Hierosolyma''', usually referred to as the '''Lord's New Church''', is an international, [[Christian church]] based on the [[Old Testament]], the [[New Testament]], and the theological writings of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], which its members view as the Third Testament.

It was founded in 1937 by former members of the [[General Church of the New Jerusalem]], also a [[Swedenborgian]] church, after a doctrinal dispute led to the ousting of Rev. Ernst Pfeiffer of The Hague Society, a branch of the General Church located in the [[Netherlands]].

Headquartered in [[Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania|Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania, U.S.]], the Church maintains an international congregation, with ministries or societies in Africa, Europe, and the United States, and has a total membership of approximately 1,000.&lt;ref name="Commonwealth"&gt;{{cite court| litigants=Pitcairn et al. v.

==History==
The Church was founded in 1937, under the principal leadership of Rev. [[Theodore Pitcairn]] (son of [[PPG Industries]] founder [[John Pitcairn, Jr.|John Pitcairn]]) and the Rev. Ernst Pfeiffer of The Hague Society in the Netherlands, by former members of the [[General Church of the New Jerusalem]] who had left as a result of a doctrinal dispute.

The dispute in question centered on theological ideas proposed by a Dutch layman, H. D. G. Groeneveld, in ''De Hemelsche Leer'' (The Celestial Doctrine), a Dutch periodical started by Pfeiffer in 1929. Emanuel Swedenborg, whose writings compose the distinctive body of material used by the General Church, had proposed the idea that the [[Bible]] had, in addition to its intended material meaning, a spiritual meaning that had been revealed through the communications between Swedenborg and the angelic realm. The General Church placed paramount authority on the writings of Swedenborg, but Groeneveld went beyond this; he proposed that Swedenborg's theological writings themselves were nothing less than a Third Testament, and thus, according to Swedenborg's ideas, must also have an inner, spiritual meaning.

In the United States, Pitcairn emerged as an early proponent of Groeneveld's perspective. In 1927, he wrote a short book entitled ''The Book Sealed with Seven Seals'' to introduce the idea to the American church.&lt;ref name="Novel Guide"&gt;{{cite web | title = Lord's New Church Which Is Nova Hierosolyma | work = | publisher = Novelguide.com | date = Jan 2009 | url = http://www.novelguide.com/a/discover/eop_01/eop_01_02837.html | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:LordsNewChurch BrynAthyn LeftSide.jpg|thumb|300px|The Lord's New Church, in Bryn Athyn, PA]]
In the 1930s, first the leadership of the General Church, and later, its Council of the Clergy, rejected the leading theses propounded in ''De Hemelsche Leer''. Rev. Pfeiffer, whose Hague Society supported the periodical, was thus ordered to stop publication. When he refused, he was forced, in 1937, to leave the General Church by its leading Bishop, the Rev. George de Charms. This led other leading adherents of the theses, including Pitcairn, to resign that year as well. That same year, Pitcairn, Pfeiffer, and others proceeded to establish the ''Lord's New Church Which Is Nova Hierosolyma'', centered in [[Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania]], and [[The Hague|The Hague, The Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="Novel Guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Church history"&gt;{{cite web | title = Lord's New Church Which Is Nova Hierosolyma – History of the Church | work = | publisher = | date =  | url = http://www.thelordsnewchurch.com/history_of_the_lords_new_church.html | accessdate = 23 Jan 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hierosolyma is a Hellenized pronunciation of a Hebrew word for Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jerusalem: The Topography, Economics and History from the Earliest Times to AD 70|last=Smith|first=George Adam|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date= 31 Oct 2013|pages=556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, Rev. Pitcairn established a non-profit corporation for the purposes of promoting and maintaining the new church.&lt;ref name="Commonwealth"/&gt;

The events of the Second World War delayed formalization of the new Church's organization. Finally, in March 1947, the Church's international governmental structure was drawn up by a provisional international council composed of the laymen Groeneveld and Anton Zelling, and the Revs. Pfeiffer, Pitcairn, and Philip N. Odhner, and approved by Church members in America and Holland later that year.&lt;ref name="Church history"/&gt;

==Teachings and practices==
The Church is a branch of what is commonly called the "New Church" or the "Swedenborgian Church",&lt;ref name="About us"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = About Us - The Lord's New Church Which Is Nova Hierosolyma | work = | publisher = | date =  | url = http://www.thelordsnewchurch.com/about_us.html | doi = | accessdate = 1 Feb 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a post-Reformation form of Christianity that bases its [[Swedenborgianism#Beliefs|teachings]] on the [[Old Testament]] (written in Hebrew), the [[New Testament]] (written in Greek), and the theological writings of Emanuel Swedenborg (written in [[Latin]]), the last of which is referred to as the ''Latin Word''. The Lord's New Church differs from the General Church, as its parent denomination is commonly called, and from other Swedenborgian branches, in that the former's members view Swedenborg's theological writings as a Third Testament.

===The Three Essentials===
The Church propounds three essential theological principles:&lt;ref name="Doctrinal Statements"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Doctrinal Statements Found in the Handbook of The Lord's New Church Which Is Nova Hierosolyma | work = | publisher = The Lord's New Church Which Is Nova Hierosolyma | date =  | url = http://www.thelordsnewchurch.com/doctrinal_statements_in_handbook_of_thelordsnewchurch.html
| doi =  | accessdate = Jan 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The acknowledgment of the Lord [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] in His Divine Human as the one only God of [[Heaven#In Christianity|Heaven]] and Earth, in Whom is the [[Trinity|Divine Trinity]].
# The acknowledgment of the Word of the Lord in its three Testaments, the [[Old Testament]], the [[New Testament]], and the Writings of Emanuel Swedenborg, which are the Third Testament. In this Third Testament the Lord has fulfilled His [[Second coming|Second Coming]], and all the Divine Truth of His Divine Human from firsts to lasts is present therein in fullness, holiness and power. What is said in this Testament concerning the Sacred Scripture or Word applies also to itself.
# The life of faith, charity and love into the Lord that is of Heaven, being the Divine essence of eternal life in man and in the Church.

===The Principles of Doctrine===
The Church also identifies three 'Principles of Doctrine':&lt;ref name="Doctrinal Statements"/&gt;
# It is not the Word that makes the Church, but the understanding of it. The Church is according to its Doctrine and the Doctrine is out of the Word. However the Doctrine does not instaurate the Church, but the integrity and purity of the Doctrine, consequently the understanding (intellectus) of the Word.
# The Doctrine is spiritual out of celestial origin not out of rational origin.
# The Third Testament without Doctrine is as a candlestick without light, and those who read that Testament without Doctrine, or who do not acquire for themselves Doctrine out of the Third Testament, are in darkness as to all Truth.

==Church structure and organization==
The Church is essentially organized as an [[episcopal polity]], a form of [[Ecclesiastical polity|church governance]] which is hierarchical in structure, and in which the chief authority over a local Christian church rests with a bishop. The external governmental structure of the Church is based upon a portion of Swedenborg's writings that describes a 'circle of life' composed of a 'descending line' and an 'ascending line'; the priesthood corresponds to the former and the laity to the latter.&lt;ref name="Church history"/&gt;
[[Image:LordsNewChurch BrynAthyn RightSide.jpg|thumb|300px|The Lord's New Church, in Bryn Athyn, PA]]

Headquartered in [[Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania|Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania, U.S.]], the Church has ministries or societies in Africa, Europe, and the United States. It has a worldwide membership of approximately 1000,&lt;ref name="Commonwealth"/&gt; with the majority of these residing in southern Africa.&lt;ref name="Religious Movements"/&gt;

The headquarters of the church, with its main church building, are located adjacent to the Pennypack preserve, west of the [[Pennypack Creek]] and the creek road trail.

The Church is supported by a non-profit corporation of the same name.&lt;ref name="Commonwealth"/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Mitsuo Matayoshi'''|又吉 光雄|Matayoshi Mitsuo|extra=also, '''Iesu Matayoshi'''}} (February 5, 1944 – July 20, 2018) was a Japanese political activist, known for his [[Perennial candidate|perennial candidacy]]. He styled himself ''The only God Matayoshi Mitsuo Jesus Christ'' (唯一神又吉光雄・イエス・キリスト) or ''Jesus Matayoshi'' (又吉イエス) ("Iesu" is the Japanese pronunciation of the Latin pronunciation of "Jesus"). He was the leader of the World Economic Community Party (世界経済共同体党).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/culture/waiwai/archive/news/2005/10/20051027p2g00m0dm018000c.html|title=From One God to the UFO Party, eccentric election campaigners are out of this world – Mainichi Daily News|date=27 October 2005|work=Mainichi Daily News|accessdate=19 March 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020031651/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/culture/waiwai/archive/news/2005/10/20051027p2g00m0dm018000c.html|archivedate=20 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Ginowan, Okinawa]] on February 5, 1944. After graduating from [[Chuo University]] in Tokyo in 1968, he moved back to Okinawa and ran a ''[[Cram school|juku]]'', a private school. Matayoshi was trained as a [[Protestant]] preacher, and through his religious studies developed a particular concept of [[Christianity]] strongly influenced by [[eschatology]]. In 1997, he established the World Economic Community Party (世界経済共同体党), a political party based on his conviction that he was [[God]]. His concept was both religious and political, a mix of [[Christian eschatology]] like [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|De civitate Dei]]'' ("City of God") and [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[collectivism]]. He died from illness on July 20, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=党元代表逝去のお知らせ |url=http://www.matayoshi.org/document/fuhou.html |website=World Economic Community Party |publisher=(in Japanese) |accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political program ==
According to his programme he would have executed{{clarify|date=September 2017}} the [[Last Judgment]] as [[Christ]], but within the current political system. His first step was to have been appointed the [[Prime Minister of Japan]]. Then he would have reformed Japanese society and be offered the post of the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]. Matayoshi would then have reigned over the whole world with two legitimate authorities, not only religious but also political. The world economic system would have been altered to encourage every nation to be self-sufficient, based on agriculture. He condemned{{clarify|date=September 2017}} [[permanent residency]] and the [[naturalisation]] of foreigners because he viewed the abandonment of one's motherland to be wrong. He wanted ethnically non-Japanese people to go back to their ancestral homeland even if they were born in Japan. He wanted the USA to withdraw its army from all overseas positions, including Okinawa. After his Judgment he would have thrown the corrupt into the Fire (see [[Book of Revelation]]).

== Elections ==
Matayoshi presented himself as a candidate in many elections from 1997 through to 2013, despite winning none of them. He became well-known for his eccentric campaigns in which he urged opponents to commit suicide by [[Seppuku|hara-kiri]] (disembowelment; note that he avoided the more polite ''seppuku'') and said that he will cast them into [[Gehenna]]. Like most Japanese politicians, he campaigned in a single small regulation size [[minivan|mini-van]] fitted with oversized loudspeakers. Unlike most, however, he blasted his campaign slogans in a stylised, [[kabuki]]-inspired voice.{{Clarify|date=July 2013}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17040">The '''National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public Schools''' ('''NCBCPS''') is a [[social conservatism in the United States|conservative]] nonprofit organization that promotes the use of its 300-page [[Bible]] curriculum, ''The Bible in History and Literature'', in schools throughout the United States.&lt;ref name="WilsonSilk2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Charles Reagan|last2=Silk|first2=Mark|title=Religion and Public Life in the South: In the Evangelical Mode|date=1 January 2005|publisher=AltaMira Press|language=English |isbn=9780759106345|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCBCPS was founded in 1993,&lt;ref name="WilsonSilk2005"/&gt; and as of 2000 its curriculum has been in use in at least 70 public school districts across the United States.&lt;ref name="USCCR2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rights|first=United States Commission on Civil|title=Schools and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sv_OhVf4ockC|accessdate=25 May 2018|year=2000|publisher=[[United States Commission on Civil Rights]]|language=English |page=19|quote=Mr. Eidsmoe serves as legal counsel to the National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public Schools, a nationwide, nonprofit organization based in North Carolina whose curriculum has been adopted by 70 different school districts and 25 States all over the country, including Alaska and California.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been criticized by separationists as presenting a religious interpretation of the Bible as well as an unbalanced view of American history which promotes specific religious beliefs. The use of the curriculum has been challenged in lawsuits in two school districts, which have withdrawn the course as contravening the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]].&lt;ref name=ACLU/&gt;

==Overview==
NCBCPS was founded on April 8, 1993, by Elizabeth Ridenhour, a [[Greensboro, NC]], paralegal. The organization's annual [[Tax forms in the United States#990|990 tax forms]], available on [[Guidestar]].org, list Ridenhour as an ordained minister.

According to the organization's Web site, "312 U.S. school districts in 37 states have educated 175,000 of their students using the Bible curriculum as a public high school elective."

A 2006 report, "Reading, Writing and Religion: Teaching the Bible in Texas Public Schools," by Bible scholar Dr. Mark Chancey of Southern Methodist University found that in [[Texas]], "the number of Texas school districts using the NCBCPS curriculum, 11, is less than a fourth of the 52 claimed by the NCBCPS itself. Adding the very few school districts known to have used the course in the past... does not significantly change the total number. The NCBCPS markets its course by strongly emphasizing the large number of school districts that supposedly teach it; as of late July 2006, its Web site claimed that its curriculum is currently offered in 362 districts nationwide. Such oft-repeated claims now appear to be quite inaccurate. If the situation in Texas is representative, the curriculum is probably actually taught in only a few dozen districts."

==Curriculum legality==
The NCBCPS web site states that the organization's curriculum "has never been legally challenged",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bibleinschools.net/Biographies/Biography-Elizabeth-Ridenour |title=NCBCPS Web site: Biography of Elizabeth Ridenour |accessdate=October 1, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006073914/http://www.bibleinschools.net/Biographies/Biography-Elizabeth-Ridenour |archive-date=2014-10-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and features an opinion from four lawyers claiming the course to be constitutional. Whilst the NCBCPS itself has not been sued, two school boards have been for adopting the NCBCPS materials in their district:

===''Moreno v. Ector County School Board''===
A federal lawsuit on behalf of eight parents in [[Odessa, Texas]], was filed on May 16, 2007 against the [[Ector County]] school board. The suit was brought by the [[ACLU]] of Texas, the [[People For the American Way]] Foundation and the law firm of [[Jenner &amp; Block]]. The suit alleged that the course promotes certain religious beliefs to the exclusion of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/religion/schools/bibleinpublicschools.html |title=American Civil Liberties Union: ACLU Successfully Helps Parents Challenge Bible Classes in Texas Public Schools |accessdate=March 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Ector County School Board was represented by [[Liberty Legal Foundation]]. In a May 17, 2007 article in the ''Odessa American'', ECISD trustee L.V. "Butch" Foreman III said he did not understand how the parents could sue the school board since they do not have children taking the course. "If they don't have children in the class, they can kiss my butt," Foreman said.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oaoa.com/onset?id=2353&amp;template=article.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829022025/http://www.oaoa.com/onset?id=2353&amp;template=article.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 29, 2007 |title=Odessa American: ACLU, parents sue ECISD |accessdate=March 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 5, 2008, the lawsuit was settled with an agreement by the Ector County School Board to cease teaching NCBCPS materials in its public schools after that current school year. The course offered was taught as an elective in two [[high school]]s and was described as unconstitutionally promoting a particular interpretation of the Bible that is not shared by Jews, Catholics, Orthodox Christians, and most Protestants. Bible scholars had seriously criticized the course as lacking accuracy, ignoring scholarly research, promoting a particular religious interpretation of the Bible, and presenting an unbalanced view of American history which promoted specific religious beliefs.

According to the settlement,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.libertylegal.org/Img/Med%20proposal%20final%20odessa.pdf |title=Settlement of Moreno v. Ector County School Board |accessdate=March 6, 2010 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; any Bible course Ector County schools offer in the future cannot be based on the NCBCPS curriculum, and must follow strict legal standards for objectivity and balance. One of the plaintiffs, an ordained elder and deacon at a local Presbyterian Church, said that it was inappropriate for one set of religious beliefs to be promoted over others, and that "It seems as though a church had invaded the public school system – and it wasn’t my church". The ACLU’s Director of Litigation said in a press release that “We trust that any future curriculum will be appropriate for students of all faiths – including nonbelievers – and that it will respect the religious liberty of all Odessans.”  &lt;ref name=ACLU&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/religion/schools/34356prs20080305.html |title=American Civil Liberties Union : Texas School Board Agrees To Stop Teaching Unconstitutional Bible Class In Public Schools |accessdate=March 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Gibson v. Lee County School Board''===
The Lee County School Board (Florida) was sued while using the NCBCPS curriculum, for "unconstitutionally advancing religion in public school classrooms." According to the website of People for the American Way Foundation, which represented the plaintiffs in the suit (''Gibson v. Lee County School Board''), "In January 1998, the court issued a preliminary injunction that prohibited the teaching of the 'New Testament' curriculum and allowed the '[[Old Testament]]' curriculum to be taught only under strict monitoring. The court also ordered the two sides to begin settlement negotiations.

"After the court's ruling, the Board agreed to settle the case by withdrawing the 'Old Testament' and '[[New Testament]]' curricula it had adopted and replacing them with a new, objective and non-sectarian course based on a textbook called "''An Introduction to the Bible''."

===Winter 2007 ''Baylor Law Review'' article===
In the Winter 2007 issue of the ''Baylor Law Review'', Amanda Colleen Brown reviewed the NCBCPS' ''The Bible in History and Literature'' and the Bible Literacy Project's ''[[The Bible and Its Influence]]'' (59 Baylor L. Rev. 193). The author subjects both curricula to three legal tests used by the Supreme Court to determine the legality of Bible courses, and concludes that the NCBCPS curriculum is "unfit for use in public school classrooms," while the Bible Literacy Project's curriculum "comports with constitutional standards, thus making it a viable alternative to the NCBCPS curriculum."
Brown argues that a key problem with the NCBCPS curriculum is that it consists of only a teacher's guide, with no student textbook. Brown writes:
{{quote|Using only the Bible makes compliance with the Constitution and regulating the classroom instruction much more difficult. If there is a text to follow, then the majority of what will be discussed in class can be scrutinized and approved or disapproved. It also provides a guide by implication for teachers as to the tone and content of course lessons. Using only the Bible makes inadvertent or intentional Constitutional violations much more likely, since the class content is predominantly lectures by the teacher. Given that the curriculum has a sectarian nature and promotes religious viewpoints, the fact that the Bible serves as the only text makes the effect of the advancement of religion even more likely. It is possible, as well, that the NCBCPS intentionally chose not to develop a text, in order to give the teachers more freedom to control the content of the course toward the views expressed by the NCBCPS in the curriculum.}}

===Opinion of the Attorney General of Georgia===
In 1999, the Attorney General of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Thurbert Baker,  issued an opinion stating that the state's proposed adoption of the NCBCPS courses could not be assured that they would survive a legal challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.state.ga.us/ag/read.cgi?searchval=Bible%20electives&amp;openval=99-16 |title=Opinion of the Attorney General of Georgia |accessdate=March 6, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum quality==
On August 1, 2005, Dr. Mark Chancey, professor of Biblical studies at [[Southern Methodist University]], released a report through the Texas Freedom Network detailing his concerns about the scholarly quality of the curriculum. Chancey stated that the curriculum was improperly sectarian, and contained "shoddy research, factual errors and plagiarism." In particular, Chancey wrote that the curriculum "uses a discredited urban legend that NASA has evidence that two days are missing in time, thus 'confirming' a biblical passage about the sun standing still [pp. 116–17];" and that more than one-third of the curriculum's 300 pages are reproduced word-for-word from uncredited sources such as Microsoft's ''[[Encarta]]'' encyclopedia. Hundreds of Biblical scholars at universities around the United States have signed on as endorsers of Chancey's findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tfn.org/site/PageServer?pagename=issues_religious_freedom_bible_course_NCBCPS_report_endorsements |title=Texas Freedom Network - Religious Scholar Endorsements |accessdate=October 1, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006080922/http://www.tfn.org/site/PageServer?pagename=issues_religious_freedom_bible_course_NCBCPS_report_endorsements |archive-date=2014-10-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCBCPS responded with an August 4 press release asking the public to "consider the source." The release described the Texas Freedom Network as "a small group of far left, anti-religion extremists ... desperate to ban one book – the Bible – from public schools.&lt;ref name="bibleinterp.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/Chancey_Bible_Curr_Revised.shtml |title=The Bible and Interpretation: The Revised Curriculum of the National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public Schools |accessdate=March 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a subsequent article,&lt;ref name="bibleinterp.com"/&gt;  Dr. Chancey wrote:
{{quote|As early as August 12, however, the NCBCPS was mailing school districts a revised edition of its curriculum, along with a letter urging them in bold, italicized, underlined letters to 'please discard any previous editions of the curriculum that you may have.' ... Why a purportedly problem-free book that had been published only five months earlier needed to be completely replaced was not explained.}}
&lt;!--
On September 9, 2005, the NCBCPS released this updated curriculum at a press conference led by martial arts expert and Bible curriculum advocate [[Chuck Norris]].
--&gt;
Robert Marus of the [[Associated Baptist Press]] Washington Bureau wrote that the revision of the curriculum "incorporat[ed] many of the changes recommended by an organization [the NCBCPS] characterized as 'anti-religion extremists.'" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baptiststandard.com/postnuke/index.php?module=htmlpages&amp;func=display&amp;pid=3938&amp;print=1 |title=Associated Baptist Press: Controversial Bible curriculum revised |accessdate=March 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspectives of others on the curriculum==
The syllabus of the National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public Schools has endorsed by [[D. James Kennedy]], [[Bill Bright]], [[Joyce Meyer]], [[Jerry Falwell]], [[John Hagee]], [[T.D. Jakes]], [[Dale Evans Rogers]], [[Jane Russell]], [[Pat Boone]], [[ Carman Licciardello]], and [[Scott O'Grady]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://afajournal.org/past-issues/2001/february/courts-pave-way-for-bible-curriculum-in-americas-public-schools/|title=Courts pave way for Bible curriculum in America's public schools|last=Ridenour|first=Elizabeth|year=2001|publisher=AFA Journal|language=English|accessdate=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Chicago Tribune'' Editorial Board, in an editorial published July 7, 2007, stated that "The folks at the National Council are right on one count: The Bible should be taught in public schools. But they shouldn't be the ones to do it." The editorial criticised the NCBCPS for not releasing the names of the authors of the curriculum and for "sloppy editing, factual errors and outright copying, word for word, from sources." The Editorial Board noted that "The National Council is not the only option school districts have. A competing curriculum ([[The Bible and Its Influence]]) offered by the Bible Literacy Project, a non-profit group, has been vetted, accepted and praised by a wide range of scholars, critics and education officials."

''TIME'' Magazine, in the cover story of its April 2, 2007 issue, wrote that the curriculum is not "legally palatable ...  Its spokespeople claim it is refining itself as it goes and its most recent edition, which came out last month, eliminates much literalist bias—but still devotes 18 lines to the blatantly unscientific notion that the earth is only 6,000 years old." By contrast, ''TIME'' stated that "[Public school Bible electives] should have a strong accompanying textbook on the model of (the Bible Literacy Project's) The Bible and Its Influence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1601845,00.html |title=TIME Magazine, The Case for Teaching the Bible |accessdate=March 6, 2010 | work=Time | date=March 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Kadampa Tradition – International Kadampa Buddhist Union (NKT—IKBU)''' is a global Buddhist [[new religious movement]] founded by [[Kelsang Gyatso]] in England in 1991. In 2003 the words "International Kadampa Buddhist Union" (IKBU) were added to the original name "New Kadampa Tradition". The NKT-IKBU is an international organisation registered in England as a charitable, or non-profit, company.&lt;ref name="Cozort, Daniel 2003 p. 230"&gt;Cozort, Daniel (2003). ''The Making of the Western Lama''. Quoted in Heine, S., &amp; Prebish, C. S. (2003). ''Buddhism in the modern world: Adaptations of an ancient tradition''. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/ShowCharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1015054&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 NKT-IKBU Charity overview]. Retrieved 24 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It currently lists more than 200 centres and around 900 branch classes/study groups in forty countries.&lt;ref name="map.kadampa.org"&gt;number of centres as of 29 August 2009, retrieved from [http://www.map.kadampa.org map.kadampa.org]: 3 International Retreat Centres (IRC), 19 Kadampa Meditation Centres (KMC), 196 Kadampa Buddhist Centres (KBC), there may be even some more centres that have not been placed on the map yet, listed here: [http://www.kadampa.org/en/centers kadampa.org/en/centers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The NKT-IKBU describes itself as ‘an entirely independent Buddhist tradition’ inspired and guided by ‘the ancient [[Kadam (Tibetan Buddhism)|Kadampa]] Buddhist Masters and their teachings, as presented by [[Kelsang Gyatso]]’.&lt;ref name="Bluck, R. 2006 p. 129"&gt;Bluck, R. (2006). ''British Buddhism: Teachings, practice and development''. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Its founder, [[Kelsang Gyatso]], has sought to make Buddhist meditation and teaching more readily accessible to twenty-first century living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scotland|first1=Nigel|title=A Pocket Guide to Sects and New Religions|date=2005|publisher=Lions Books|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wanted to ensure that people did not simply study Tibetan Buddhism from an academic point of view, but learned how to extend this knowledge through meditation and practical Buddhist experience.&lt;ref name="Continuum"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oliver|first1=Paul|title=New Religious Movements: A Guide for the Perplexed|date=2011|publisher=Continuum|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NKT-IKBU is described as being "very successful at disseminating its teachings"&lt;ref name="Continuum"/&gt; and Geshe Kelsang's books have been called "very popular".&lt;ref name="Continuum"/&gt;

The NKT-IKBU has expanded more rapidly than any other Buddhist tradition in Britain. It has been described as a "controversial organization"&lt;ref name="Bluck, R. 2006 p. 129"/&gt; and a "controversial" new religious movement,&lt;ref name="Clarke, Peter Bernard p. 92"&gt;Clarke, Peter Bernard.

Retrieved 12 May 2014. "The NKT can be described typologically as a [[cult]] on the basis of its organisational form, its excessive group pressure and blind obedience to its founder."&lt;/ref&gt; or a breakaway Buddhist sect.&lt;ref name="Clarke, Peter Bernard p. 92"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Martin (2003) Identity, Ritual and State in Tibetan Buddhism – The Foundations of Authority in Gelukpa Monasticism, p. 366, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background of the formation of NKT==
In 1976 the students of [[Thubten Yeshe]] founded the [[Manjushri Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;Kay page 56; The Manjushri Institute charity registration number: 271873, Trust Deed, July 1976, 1&lt;/ref&gt; with Lama Yeshe as the Spiritual Director and purchased the assets of Conishead Priory, a neglected Victorian mansion in Ulverston ([[Cumbria]]), England for £70,000.&lt;ref&gt;Bluck 2006: 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="history"&gt;David N. Kay: ''Tibetan and Zen Buddhism in Britain: Transplantation, Development and Adaptation'', London and New York, pages 55, 56&lt;/ref&gt; The same year Thubten Yeshe and [[Thubten Zopa Rinpoche]] visited Kelsang Gyatso in India and invited him over to teach at the Manjushri Institute, which was a part of their [[FPMT]] network.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

According to David N. Kay, Kelsang Gyatso was invited in 1976 by Thubten Yeshe and Thubten Zopa, who sought the advice of the [[14th Dalai Lama]] when choosing Kelsang Gyatso.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Whereas according to a NKT brochure, "Lama Yeshe requested [[Trijang Rinpoche]] to ask Kelsang Gyatso to become Resident Teacher of Manjushri Institute. Kelsang Gyatso later recounted that Kyabje Trijang Rinpoche asked him to go to England, teach [[Shantideva]]'s ''[[Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life]]'', Chandrakirti's ''Guide to the Middle Way'' and [[Lamrim]], and then check whether there was any meaning in his continuing to stay."&lt;ref name=mdk&gt;[http://www.meditateinireland.com/html_pages/Modern%20Day%20Kadampas.htm ''Modern Day Kadampas'' – published by the NKT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617020425/http://www.meditateinireland.com/html_pages/Modern%2BDay%2BKadampas.htm |date=17 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelsang Gyatso was requested by Lama Yeshe to lead the "General Program" of Buddhist study. In 1979 Lama Yeshe asked a Geshe at Manjushri Institute, Geshe Jampa Tekchok, to teach a parallel twelve-year Geshe Studies Programme, recognised and validated by the Dalai Lama and modelled on the program of studies for the traditional [[geshe]] degree.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kay, see note on page 232&lt;/ref&gt; From 1982 to 1990 this program was led by Geshe Konchog Tsewang.&lt;ref&gt;Kay page 53 and 77&lt;/ref&gt; According to a disciple of Lama Yeshe from this time, Lama Yeshe intended the institute "to become the central monastery of the [[FPMT]]... one of the early jewels of the FPMT crown" and "the pioneer among the western centres".&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In the late 1970s, Kelsang Gyatso, without consulting Thubten Yeshe, opened up a Buddhist Centre in [[York]] under his own spiritual direction. Kay sees this as the beginning of a conflict between Thubten Yeshe and Kelsang Gyatso.&lt;ref name="problems"&gt;Kay pages 61,62,63,64&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Kelsang Gyatso, "the opening of the Centre in York caused not one moment of confusion or disharmony".&lt;ref name="eradicating"&gt;"Eradicating wrong views" a letter, dated 27 October 1983, written as a response to the FPMT report "A report on recent events at Manjushri Institute (dated October 1, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsang Gyatso was asked to resign so that another Geshe, described by Kay as "more devoted to FPMT objectives", could take over as a resident teacher of Manjushri Institute.&lt;ref name="problems"/&gt; Many students of Kelsang Gyatso petitioned him to stay and teach them, and on this basis he decided to remain.&lt;ref name="problems"/&gt; In the following years prior 1990 Kelsang Gyatso established 15 centres under his own direction in Great Britain and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Cozort, The Making of Western Lama in "Buddhism in the Modern World", {{ISBN|0-19-514698-0}}, page 230&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Kay and Cozort describe the management committee of Manjushri Institute from 1981 onwards as made up principally of Kelsang Gyatso's closest students, also known as "the Priory group".&lt;ref name="problems"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BIMW&gt;Daniel Cozort, The Making of Western Lama in "Buddhism in the Modern World", {{ISBN|0-19-514698-0}}, page 226&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kay, "The Priory Group became dissatisfied with the FPMT's increasingly centralized organisation."&lt;ref name="problems"/&gt; Cozort states that different disagreements "led to a rift between Lama Yeshe and his students and Geshe Kelsang Gyatso and his, and eventually the Manjushri Board of directors ({{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} Geshe Gyatso's students) severed the connection of the between institute and FPMT."&lt;!--When was this??--&gt;&lt;ref name=BIMW/&gt; According to Kay, Lama Yeshe tried at different times to reassert his authority over the Institute, but his attempts were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=p63&gt;Kay, page 63&lt;/ref&gt; Kay goes on to describe an open conflict of authority which developed between the Priory Group and the FPMT administration in 1983.&lt;ref name="problems"/&gt; In February 1984 the conflict was mediated by the Office of the Dalai Lama in London.&lt;ref name="problems"/&gt; Kay states that after the death of Thubten Yeshe in March 1984, the FPMT lost interest because they saw it as a fruitless case.&lt;ref name=p63/&gt; Since that time, Kay states, the Manjushri Institute has developed mainly under the guidance of Kelsang Gyatso without further reference to the FPMT,&lt;ref name="problems"/&gt; but legally remained part of the FPMT until late 1990.&lt;ref name=p78&gt;Kay page 78&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kay, of the two Geshes at Manjushri Institute, it was Kelsang Gyatso who had always taken the greater interest in the running and direction of the Institute, and most of the students there were closer to him.&lt;ref&gt;Kay 2004 : 66&lt;/ref&gt; The courses offered by both Geshes complemented each other, but as Kay remarked, they "differed in one important respect: only Geshe Kelsang's General Programme included courses on [[Vajrayana|Tantric Buddhism]], and attendance upon these required the reception of a Tantric empowerment."&lt;ref&gt;Kay 2004 : 56&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Kay argues that "Lama Yeshe's and Geshe Kelsang's different ideological perspectives provided the conditions for the organisational dispute between the Institute and the FPMT to escalate. Kelsang Gyatso was already predisposed to support his students in their struggle with the FPMT administration because the organisation was inspired by a vision that he did not totally agree with."&lt;ref&gt;Kay 2004 : 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Kay writes that, "the determination of Geshe Kelsang and the Priory Group to separate from the parent organisation was uncompromising, and this was a position that only hardened during the following years." He goes on to describe the split from the Gelug school and FPMT as follows:
{{quote|Geshe Kelsang's perception of himself and his centres vis-à-vis the contemporary Gelug sect changed dramatically, and he came to believe that he could only uphold the tradition of [[Tsongkhapa]] purely by separating from the degenerate world of Tibetan, and specifically Gelug, Buddhism.&lt;ref name=degeneration&gt;Kay page 59&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Kelsang Gyatso made a three-year [[retreat (spiritual)|retreat]] from 1987 to 1990 in [[Dumfries]], [[Scotland]] and asked Geshe Losang Pende from Ganden Shartse monastery to lead the General Program in his absence, whilst Geshe Konchog Tsewang continued to teach the Geshe Studies Programme at Conishead Priory (Manjushri Institute).&lt;ref name=p73&gt;Kay page 73&lt;/ref&gt; Different Lamas, including Thubten Zopa, were still invited.&lt;ref name=p73/&gt; Especially the visit of Thubten Zopa in 1988 "is significant, indicating the ongoing devotion of the students to this lama and their desire to leave the negativity of the schism with the FPMT in the past."&lt;ref name=p73/&gt; In 1988 and 1990 the uncle of Kelsang Gyatso, Choyang Duldzin Kuten Lama – the oracle of [[Dorje Shugden]] – also visited Manjushri Institute.&lt;ref name=p73/&gt; Before that time Song Rinpoche, Geshe Lhundup Sopa, Geshe Rabten, as well as other Buddhist teachers such as [[Ajahn Sumedho]] and [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]] have taught at Manjushri Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Kay page 68&lt;/ref&gt;

During Kelsang Gyatso's period of retreat he wrote some of his books and worked out the foundations of the NKT. Kay states: "The first major development that took place during Geshe Kelsang's retreat was the introduction of the 'Teacher Training Programme' (TTP) at the Manjushri Institute."&lt;ref&gt;Kay 2004 : 74&lt;/ref&gt; Kay comments the developments at that time: "By giving his study programmes a textual basis, Geshe Kelsang not only provided accessible materials to enhance the focus and commitment of his students, but also laid down structures through which spiritual authority could later be concentrated exclusively on him."&lt;ref&gt;Kay 2004 : 75&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Kay, 
{{quote|At this stage in the development of Geshe Kelsang's network, students were not required to rely on him exclusively...His perspective had yet to harden further, and the decisive shift appears to have taken place shortly after he came out of retreat in 1990 when he began to introduce new and radically exclusive policies within his centres. He had come to believe by this time that he had a central role to play in the preservation of Tsongkhapa's tradition in the modern age. The substance of the various reforms he implemented, therefore, was that the student within his centres were now to rely exclusively upon him for their spiritual inspiration and welfare.&lt;ref&gt;Kay, page 76&lt;/ref&gt;}}
According to Kay, Kelsang Gyatso was gravely concerned that the purity of Tsongkhapa's tradition was being undermined by the lingering inclusivism of his Western students, something he had been outspoken for some years, "but he now acted more forcefully in his opposition to it by discouraging his students both from receiving guidance from teachers of other traditions and from reading their books."&lt;ref name=p77&gt;Kay page 77&lt;/ref&gt; Kay states that another result of these "radically exclusive policies" was that after the foundation of the NKT the Manjushri Institute Library, with over 3000 books,&lt;ref&gt;Kay page 67&lt;/ref&gt; was removed.&lt;ref name=removal&gt;Kay page 76&lt;/ref&gt; Kay goes on to state that, "this began with non-Gelug books being removed, but as Geshe Kelsang's vision crystallised, even books by Gelug teachers became unacceptable to him and the library disappeared altogether. He thus became convinced that the Tibetan Gelug tradition as a whole no longer embodied Tsongkhapa's pure teachings and that he and his disciples must therefore separate from it. From this point onwards, Tibetan Gelug lamas would no longer be invited to teach within his network. This perceived degeneration extended to include its highest-level lamas, and so even veneration for the Dalai Lama was now actively discouraged."&lt;ref name=removal/&gt; The pictures of the Dalai Lama were removed from the [[gompa]]s and shrines of Kelsang Gyatso's centres.&lt;ref name=removal/&gt; In 1990 Kelsang Gyatso became also outspoken against the Geshe Studies Programme,&lt;ref name=p77/&gt; and "made the pursuit of his new programmes compulsory."&lt;ref name=p77/&gt; According to Kay "As it was no longer possible for students to follow the programmes of both Geshes, the basis of Geshe Konchog's teaching programme at the Institute was undermined, and in 1991 he retired to [[Gyuto Monastery]] in Assam, India."&lt;ref name=p77/&gt;

===The foundation of the New Kadampa Tradition===
According to David Kay, "in 1991, through the successful exploitation of a legal loophole, the assets of Manjushri Institute finally fell under the sole control of the Priory Group" (the close disciples of Kelsang Gyatso).&lt;ref name=p78/&gt; In the Spring of that same year, Kelsang Gyatso announced the creation of the 'New Kadampa Tradition', an event which was celebrated in the NKT-Magazine ''Full Moon'' as "a wonderful development in the history of the Buddhadharma."&lt;ref name=p78/&gt; In 1992, the Manjushri Institute developed a new constitution,&lt;ref&gt;The New Kadampa Tradition, charity registration number: 2758093, October 1992 designed to study and experience Kelsang Gyatso's presentation of Buddhism (see page 233 of Kay's research)&lt;/ref&gt; which constituted the formal foundation of the NKT. The Manjushri Institute was renamed the Manjushri Mahayana Buddhist Centre,&lt;ref name="problems"/&gt; and later the Manjushri Kadampa Meditation Centre. Since then, it has remained Kelsang Gyatso's home and the NKT's flagship centre.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Cozort, The Making of Western Lama in "Buddhism in the Modern World", {{ISBN|0-19-514698-0}}, page 234&lt;/ref&gt;

With the foundation of the New Kadampa Tradition (NKT) by Kelsang Gyatso, he established a new and independent religious movement&lt;ref&gt;Kay page 89&lt;/ref&gt; aiming to "principally follow the teachings and example of Je Tsongkhapa".&lt;ref name=mdk/&gt; This also gave a new identity to his followers. The many NKT centres which were built up rapidly by his followers could gather under the common auspices of the NKT and their spiritual guide, distinguishing and disassociating themselves from other Tibetan Buddhist traditions, especially the Gelug school from which Kelsang Gyatso originated. Kay argued that with these changes, Kelsang Gyatso provided a basis for the NKT to become a Western tradition whose "spiritual authority could later be concentrated exclusively on him."&lt;ref&gt;Kay page 74&lt;/ref&gt; Cozort describes this as unusual in the Tibetan tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Cozort, The Making of Western Lama in "Buddhism in the Modern World", {{ISBN|0-19-514698-0}}, page 240&lt;/ref&gt; The NKT described themselves as being "an entirely independent Buddhist tradition with no political affiliations...&lt;ref&gt;NKT brochures before June 2006 and NKT-internet-sites (see [http://www.dharmaforkids.com/Extras/nkt.htm], [http://www.meditationinflorida.org/new-kadampa-tradition.php])&lt;/ref&gt; that is appropriate to the needs and conditions of the modern world".&lt;ref name=mdk/&gt;

David N. Kay comments:

{{quote|In defining the movement in this way, the organisation is not simply maintaining that it represents Buddhism adapted for westerners; it is also striving to underline its separation from the Tibetan Gelug sect and emphasize the point that the West – via the NKT – is now the guardian and custodian of the pure tradition of Tsongkhapa in the modern world. From a NKT viewpoint, Geshe Kelsang has played a unique role in the transmission of Tsongkhapa's pure teachings, and the organisation and study structures he has created in the West are now believed to protect and preserve a tradition that is all but lost in its indigenous Eastern context.&lt;ref name=foundation&gt;Kay pages 88,89&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The identity of the NKT===

====The views of NKT about NKT====
In 1998 Kelsang Gyatso stated in an interview:

{{quote|We are pure [[Gelugpa]]s. The name Gelugpa doesn't matter, but we believe we are following the pure tradition of Je Tsongkhapa. We are studying and practicing Lama Tsongkhapa's teachings and taking as our example what the ancient [[Kadampa]] lamas and geshes did. All the books that I have written are commentaries on Lama Tsongkhapa's teachings. We try our best to follow the example of the ancient Kadampa Tradition and use the name Kadampa to remind people to practice purely.&lt;ref&gt;An Interview With Geshe Kelsang Gyatso by Donald S. Lopez, Jr.; Geshe Kelsang Gyatso discusses Dorje Shugden as a benevolent protector god, [[Tricycle Magazine]], Spring 1998, Vol. 7 No. 3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to an NKT brochure, written by James Belither while secretary of the NKT:

{{quote|Geshe Kelsang first introduced the title 'New Kadampa Tradition' to give the centres under his spiritual direction a distinct identity within the wider Buddhist world. Although the Gelugpas were sometimes referred to as [[new Kadampa]]s, the name New Kadampa Tradition had never been used previously in a formal sense. Nevertheless, by using this title Geshe Kelsang is making it clear that practitioners of this tradition are principally following the teachings and example of [[Je Tsongkhapa]]. The word 'New' is used not to imply that it is newly created, but is a fresh presentation of Buddhadharma in a form and manner that is appropriate to the needs and conditions of the modern world. Furthermore, by using the title 'Kadampa', Geshe Kelsang encourages his disciples to follow the perfect example of simplicity and purity of practice shown by the [[Kadampa]] Geshes."&lt;ref name=mdk/&gt;}}

Nowadays the New Kadampa Tradition describes Kelsang Gyatso's presentation of Buddhism to the West as '''Kadampa Buddhism''' with the following statement:

{{quote|Kadampa Buddhism is a time-honored tradition that for centuries has made Buddha's teachings and meditation practices available to people throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kadampa.org/en/meditation/introduction-to-meditation-buddhism/ Official Kadampa Website at]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|It is an association of Buddhist Centers and practitioners that derive their inspiration and guidance from the example of the ancient [[Kadampa]] Buddhist Masters and their teachings as presented by Geshe Kelsang Gyatso. The New Kadampa Tradition (NKT) is an international non-profit organization registered in England as a charitable company&amp;nbsp;..., and was founded by Geshe Kelsang to provide a vehicle for promoting Kadampa Buddhism throughout the world."&lt;ref name=okws&gt;[http://kadampa.org/en/buddhism/new-kadampa-tradition Official Kadampa Website at]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Moreover, the NKT presents itself as being the continuation of the ancient [[Kadampa]] tradition by naming its school ''Kadampa Buddhism'' and equating this ''Kadampa Buddhism'' with the historical Kadampa School of [[Atisha]]:

{{quote|Kadampa Buddhism is a Mahayana Buddhist school founded by the great Indian Buddhist Master Atisha (AD 982–1054)... The great Kadampa Teachers are famous not only for being great scholars but also for being spiritual practitioners of immense purity and sincerity. The lineage of these teachings, both their oral transmission and blessings, was then passed from Teacher to disciple, spreading throughout much of Asia, and now to many countries throughout the Western world... Kadampa Buddhism was first introduced into the West in 1977 by the renowned Buddhist Master, Venerable Geshe Kelsang Gyatso. Since that time, he has worked tirelessly to spread Kadampa Buddhism throughout the world by giving extensive teachings, writing many profound texts on Kadampa Buddhism, and founding the New Kadampa Tradition – International Kadampa Buddhist Union.&lt;ref&gt;Joyful Path of Good Fortune (p. 622)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Followers of the NKT refer to themselves as '''Kadampa Buddhists''', the temples of the New Kadampa Tradition are referred to as Kadampa Buddhist Temples, and more recently, NKT teachers are named '''Kadampa teachers'''. Additionally, the Dharma centres of the New Kadampa Tradition are called '''Kadampa Buddhist Centres'''.&lt;ref&gt;Official Kadampa Website at [http://kadampa.org/en/buddhism/teachers/], {{cite web |url=http://www.meditateinbirmingham.org/venerable-geshe-kelsang-gyatso.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=26 December 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061218031449/http://www.meditateinbirmingham.org/venerable-geshe-kelsang-gyatso.htm |archivedate=18 December 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Belither, the former secretary of the NKT, described the NKT as "a Mahayana Buddhist tradition with historical connections with Tibet", rather than a Tibetan tradition, and explained that Kelsang Gyatso wishes his followers always "to present [[Dharma]] in a way appropriate to their own culture and society without the need to adopt [[Tibetan culture]] and customs".&lt;ref&gt;Belither, 1997:7—8, see also Bluck&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other views about the NKT====
Whereas the NKT celebrate Kelsang Gyatso as the one who "is primarily responsible for the worldwide revival of Kadampa Buddhism in our time",&lt;ref&gt;[http://kadampa.org/en/buddhism/venerable-geshe-kelsang-gyatso Official NKT website]&lt;/ref&gt; "critics have described The New Kadampa Tradition as a breakaway sect or [[cult]] and argue it is not part of the ancient Kadampa Tradition but a split from the [[Gelug]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]."&lt;ref&gt;BBC (bbc.co.uk), [http://www.bbc.co.uk/northyorkshire/faith/buddhism/index.shtml]; [http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/subdivisions/kadampa.shtml The New Kadampa Tradition]&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetologist Thierry Dodin has described the NKT as a cult, "... on the basis of its organisational form, its excessive group pressure and blind obedience to its founder. The organisation's extreme fanaticism and aggressive missionary drive are typical cult features too."&lt;ref&gt;[http://info-buddhism.com/Dorje_Shugden_Conflict_Dalai_Lama_protests_Thierry_Dodin.html The Dorje Shugden conflict: Interview with Thierry Dodin]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bluck remarks that there remains an apparent contradiction between claiming a pure Tibetan lineage and separating completely from contemporary Tibetan tradition. While the NKT strongly emphasises its unbroken 'lineage', it has no Tibetan followers and claims to stand outside current Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;ref name=Bluck&gt;Bluck, Robert (2006). British Buddhism Teachings, Practice and Development. RoutledgeCurzon, {{ISBN|0-415-39515-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

===Teachings and books===
Bluck lists the specific traditional teachings that are seen as important in the NKT-IKBU: "the nature of the [[Mindstream|mind]], [[karma]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|reincarnation]], the preciousness of human life, the role of meditation, death, and the commitments of [[Refuge (Buddhism)|going for refuge]]", as well as "understanding the [[Four Noble Truths]], developing renunciation, and the [[Threefold Training|training of moral discipline, concentration and wisdom]]", followed by "becoming a compassionate [[bodhisattva]] (by developing [[bodhicitta]] and the [[Paramita#Mahayana Buddhism|six perfections]]), understanding the ultimate truth of [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] and finally attaining [[Buddhahood]]."&lt;ref&gt;Bluck, Robert (2006). ''British Buddhism: Teachings, Practice and Development''. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. pp. 136–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NKT-IKBU's teachings are based exclusively on the teachings and published works of Kelsang Gyatso,&lt;ref&gt;Kay, D. N. (2004). ''Tibetan and Zen Buddhism in Britain: Transplantation, development and adaptation''. RoutledgeCurzon critical studies in Buddhism. London: RoutledgeCurzon. p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn are commentaries on [[Gelug]] works, especially those of its founder [[Je Tsongkhapa]]'s texts.&lt;ref&gt;Cozort, Daniel (2003). ''The Making of the Western Lama''. Quoted in Heine, S., &amp; Prebish, C. S. (2003). ''Buddhism in the modern world: Adaptations of an ancient tradition''. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 230 and p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; According to Helen Waterhouse, Kelsang Gyatso follows the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] custom of studying texts through the teacher's commentaries. With respect to the contents of the teachings she states that "NKT doctrine is not different from that of mainline [[Gelugpa]]", with a [[Prasangika]] Madhyamaka philosophical orientation, and emphasising the teachings on [[Pratitya-samutpada|dependent arising]] and [[Shunyata|emptiness]].&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Helen (1997). ''Buddhism in Bath: Adaptation and Authority''. University of Leeds, Department of Theology and Religious Studies. pp. 150–151.&lt;/ref&gt; The main practice in the NKT-IKBU is [[Lamrim]] (the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment), [[Lojong]] (Training the Mind), and [[Vajrayana]] [[Mahamudra]] (the practices of Highest Yoga Tantra). The books studied in the NKT are published by the Buddhist publishing house [[Tharpa Publications]].

===Study programs===
NKT-IKBU offers three study programs:&lt;ref&gt;Cozort, Daniel (2003). ''The Making of the Western Lama''. Quoted in Heine, S., &amp; Prebish, C. S. (2003). ''Buddhism in the modern world: Adaptations of an ancient tradition''.

''British Buddhism: Teachings, Practice and Development''. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Giving an overview of the purpose of the programs, the NKT-IKBU says: "Venerable Geshe Kelsang Gyatso has designed three special Study Programs for the systematic study and practice of Kadampa Buddhism that are especially suited to the modern world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://kadampa.org/en/buddhism/study-program/ ''Kadampa Education Program'']. NKT-IKBU official website. Retrieved 7 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed by NKT-IKBU followers that the teachings transmit the pure lineage of Je Tsongkhapa in its entirety.&lt;ref name="Bluck, R. 2006 p. 130"&gt;Bluck, R. (2006). ''British Buddhism: Teachings, practice and development''. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three spiritual programs are:

New York: Oxford University Press. p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The ''Foundation Program'' (FP), which includes the study of six commentaries written by Kelsang Gyatso on the following classical texts. Cozort remarks that the format of study resembles that of a British or American University, "with textbooks, lectures, small and large group discussion, and examinations."&lt;ref name="Cozort, Daniel 2003 p. 232"/&gt;

NKT-IKBU meditation practices include traditional [[Lamrim]] subjects such as "precious human life, death and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], [[Karma#Buddhism|karma]] and [[samsara]], [[Refuge (Buddhism)|taking refuge]], the development of equanimity, [[Mettā|kindness]] and [[Karuṇā|compassion]] towards all beings, [[bodhicitta]], understanding [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]], and relying on a [[Guru#Guru in Buddhism|spiritual guide]]."&lt;ref&gt;Bluck, Robert (2006). ''British Buddhism: Teachings, Practice and Development''. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chanted prayers follow "a traditional Tibetan format":&lt;ref&gt;Bluck, Robert (2006). ''British Buddhism: Teachings, Practice and Development''. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Refuge (Buddhism)|going for refuge]],
* generating [[bodhicitta]] and the ‘[[Brahmavihara|four immeasurables]]’ of [[Mettā|boundless love]], [[Karuṇā|compassion]], sympathetic joy and equanimity,
* imagining the Buddhas and bodhisattvas as physically present,
* a seven-limbed prayer of prostration, offerings, confession, rejoicing in virtue, asking holy beings to remain, requesting Dharma teachings and dedicating merit,
* offering the [[Mandala#Buddhism|mandala]] (seeing the universe as a [[Pure Land]] of happiness),
* asking for and receiving blessings (becoming filled with ‘rays of light and nectar’ from the Buddha's heart),
* following specific meditation instructions, and
* dedicating the accumulated [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] for the happiness of all beings.

While the [[Je Tsongkhapa]] and [[Dorje Shugden]] practices are recited daily, NKT-IKBU practitioners also regularly perform a number of other [[Puja (Buddhism)|ritual practices]], including [[Avalokiteshvara]], [[Heruka]], [[Vajrayogini]], [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]], [[Manjushri]], [[Amitayus]] and the [[Medicine Buddha]]. Bluck notes that "All these sādhanas have either been 'compiled from traditional sources' by Geshe Kelsang or translated under his supervision."&lt;ref&gt;Bluck, Robert (2006). ''British Buddhism: Teachings, Practice and Development''. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious observances===
From its inception, NKT-IKBU Dharma centres followed a common calendar for religious observances, including some of the traditional Buddhist religious days. These include the following:

Monthly observances of Buddha [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]], Je Tsongkhapa, [[Five Precepts#Other precepts|Eight Mahayana Precepts]], and Dorje Shugden practices:
* Tara Day (8th of each month)
* Tsog Day (10th and 25th of each month)
* Precepts Day (15th of each month)
* Protector Day (29th of each month)

Annual holidays common to other Buddhist traditions:&lt;ref name="Chryssides, George 1999 p. 237"&gt;Chryssides, George (1999). ''Exploring New Religions''. London: Cassell. p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Buddha's Enlightenment Day (15 April)
* Turning the Wheel of Dharma Day (4 June [49 days after Buddha's Enlightenment Day, and also Kelsang Gyatso's birthday])
* Buddha's Return from Heaven Day (22 September)
* Je Tsongkhapa Day (25 October)

Annual holidays unique to the NKT-IKBU:
* NKT Day (the first Saturday in April)
* International Temples Day (the first Saturday in November)

In 2004, the dates of lunar month observances were changed to the respective days in the common calendar.

NKT Day commemorates the founding of the NKT-IKBU,&lt;ref&gt;[http://kadampa.org/en/buddhism/nkt-day ''NKT Day'']. NKT-IKBU official website. Retrieved 7 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; while International Temples Day is an opportunity to reflect on the importance of building Kadampa Buddhist Temples throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kadampa.org/en/buddhism/international-temples-day/ ''International Temples Day''].

===International Buddhist festivals===

Three annual Buddhist NKT Festivals are held each year: (1) The Spring Festival – held at Manjushri KMC in UK; (2) The Summer Festival – held at Manjushri KMC in UK; (3) The Fall Festival – held at various locations outside the UK. These are taught by the General Spiritual Director of the New Kadampa Tradition, currently Gen-la Kelsang Dekyong,&lt;ref&gt;[http://kadampa.org/en/buddhism/gen-la-kelsang-dekyong1/ ''Modern Kadampa Teachers: Gen-la Kelsang Dekyong'']. Retrieved 28 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and include teachings and empowerments from the Spiritual Director, reviews and meditations led by senior NKT Teachers, chanted meditations and offering ceremonies, and meditation retreats. They are attended by between 2000 and 6000 people from around the world.

===Ordination===
{{POV-section|date=November 2015}}
Within the NKT-IKBU community there are over 700 monks and nuns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kadampa.org/en/buddhism/a-global-spiritual-community/ ''A Global Spiritual Community'']. NKT-IKBU official website. Retrieved 7 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Ordination ceremonies are usually held twice a year in the main NKT Temple at Manjushri Kadampa Meditation Center in Cumbria (UK), Ulverston. To ordain, one must ask Kelsang Gyatso's permission, and also the permission of his or her parents.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Helen (1997). ''Buddhism in Bath: Adaptation and Authority''. University of Leeds, Department of Theology and Religious Studies. p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddha established both lay and ordained Pratimoksha vows, and established several levels of ordination vows.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Helen (1997). ''Buddhism in Bath: Adaptation and Authority''. University of Leeds, Department of Theology and Religious Studies. p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the different levels of ordination are distinguished by the specific number of vows taken, and by the ceremony in which they were received. In the NKT-IKBU, Kelsang Gyatso established a simplified tradition of ordination with ten vows that summarise the entire Vinaya,&lt;ref&gt;Bluck, R. (2006). ''British Buddhism: Teachings, practice and development''. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; and a single ordination ceremony.

The 10 vows in New Kadampa Tradition ordination are identical for both nuns and monks:&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Helen (1997). ''Buddhism in Bath: Adaptation and Authority''. University of Leeds, Department of Theology and Religious Studies. p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

# abandon killing
# abandon stealing
# abandon sexual activity
# abandon lying and cheating
# abandon taking intoxicants
# practice contentment
# reduce one's desire for worldly pleasures
# abandon engaging in meaningless activities
# maintain the commitments of refuge
# practise the three trainings of pure moral discipline, concentration, and wisdom

In ''The Ordination Handbook'', Kelsang Gyatso describes these vows as being easier to integrate into today's society, saying:

{{quote|The verbal explanation of the Kadampa ordination is brief – there are just ten commitments – but their practice is very extensive.  These ten commitments that you promise to keep are the condensation of the entire lamrim teachings.  Although we can finish a verbal explanation of these vows in a few hours, their practice is all-embracing.  You should do like this – saying few words but always practising extensively.&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso, Kelsang. (1999). ''The Ordination Handbook of the New Kadampa Tradition''. p.17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He also says:

{{quote|Western people are well educated; they do not have blind faith but immediately question and try to understand the truth.  I cannot pretend with you.  We cannot be like a fully ordained monk who has taken 253 vows, but who is not even keeping one.  We should never do like this; we need to do everything correctly and purely.  The Kadampa ordination solves all these problems.  Practically speaking, all the 253 vows explained in the ''Vinaya Sutra'' are included within the ten commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso, Kelsang. (1999). ''The Ordination Handbook of the New Kadampa Tradition''. p.20.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ordination tradition of the NKT-IKBU differs from that of other Buddhist groups in that it is based on the Mahayana ''Perfection of Wisdom Sutras''&lt;ref name="Gyatso, Kelsang 1999 p. 16"&gt;Gyatso, Kelsang. (1999). ''The Ordination Handbook of the New Kadampa Tradition''. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; instead of the Hinayana ''Vinaya Sutras''. According to Kelsang Gyatso, "The Perfection of Wisdom Sutras are our Vinaya and [[Lamrim]] is its commentary."&lt;ref name="Gyatso, Kelsang 1999 p. 16"/&gt; Robert Bluck observed that in the NKT-IKBU a ''Vinaya Sutras''-based "full ordination is not available, and those who do ordain remain as novices, though again this is common in Tibet."&lt;ref&gt;Bluck, R. (2006). ''British Buddhism: Teachings, practice and development''. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsang Gyatso explains that when a person is first ordained they receive a [[Rabjung]] (preliminary) ordination; when their renunciation improves and deepens, their ordination naturally transforms into a Getsul ([[sramanera]]) ordination; and when their renunciation becomes "a spontaneous wish to attain nirvana", their ordination naturally transforms into a Gelong ([[bhikkhu]]) ordination.&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso, Kelsang. (1999). ''The Ordination Handbook of the New Kadampa Tradition''. p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Kelsang Gyatso does not require a separate ritual ordination ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso, Kelsang. (1999). ''The Ordination Handbook of the New Kadampa Tradition''. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Monks and nuns in the NKT-IKBU abandon the physical signs of a lay person by shaving their head and wearing the maroon and yellow robes of an ordained person. They are given a new name which starts with "Kelsang", since it is traditional for ordinees to receive part of the ordaining master's name (in this case, Kelsang Gyatso). They also engage in a Sojong ceremony twice a month to purify and restore their vows.

Monastics who break their ordination vows must leave their Centre for a year, with the exception of attending various bigger courses, Celebrations and Festivals. After that year, "with some conditions" they can return but cannot teach or participate in the Teacher Training Program.

Practitioners who wish to ordain approach their Buddhist teacher when they feel ready, and request formal permission once they have their teacher's consent. They may decide to live in one of the NKT-IKBU's many Buddhist centres, but this is not a requirement. They are, in general, not financially provided for by the NKT-IKBU. And, if they live in an NKT-IKBU Dharma centre, they still have to pay rent for their accommodation and pay for meals and the spiritual programs. To finance this, some have part-time or full-time work.&lt;ref name="Bluck, R. 2006 p. 146"&gt;Bluck, R. (2006). ''British Buddhism: Teachings, practice and development''. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-39515-1}}. p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Belither, "a few people are sponsored because of their NKT work but others are on 'extended working visits' or work locally, and some are legitimately on employment benefit."&lt;ref&gt;Bluck, R. (2006). ''British Buddhism: Teachings, practice and development''. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-39515-1}}. p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; When working, they may "wear ordinary clothes if this is more convenient."&lt;ref name="Bluck, R. 2006 p. 146"/&gt;

===Kelsang Gyatso===
{{main|Kelsang Gyatso}}

After leaving Tibet in 1959, Kelsang Gyatso taught and engaged in retreat in India for 18 years.&lt;ref name="Cozort, Daniel 2003 p. 230"/&gt; [[Trijang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso|Trijang Rinpoche]], the root Guru of Kelsang Gyatso,&lt;ref&gt;Kelsang Gyatso. (2000). ''Eight steps to happiness: The Buddhist way of loving kindness. London: Tharpa Publications''. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; asked him to be the resident teacher at [[Manjushri Institute]] (now known as Manjushri Kadampa Meditation Centre) in England.&lt;ref&gt;Cozort, Daniel (2003). ''The Making of the Western Lama''. Quoted in Heine, S., &amp; Prebish, C. S. (2003). ''Buddhism in the modern world: Adaptations of an ancient tradition''. New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 225, 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsang Gyatso taught the General Program at Manjushri from 1976 to 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Kay, D. N. (2004). ''Tibetan and Zen Buddhism in Britain: Transplantation, development and adaptation''. RoutledgeCurzon critical studies in Buddhism. London: RoutledgeCurzon. pp. 56, 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Kelsang Gyatso entered a 3-year [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreat]] at Tharpaland in [[Dumfries]], Scotland. During his retreat, he wrote five books and established the foundations of the NKT-IKBU.&lt;ref name="Bluck, R. 2006 p. 130"/&gt; Since that time, the NKT-IKBU has grown to comprise over 1,100 Centres and groups throughout 40 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kadampa.org/en/centers ''Kadampa Centers'']. NKT-IKBU official website. Retrieved 7 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing his retreat in the spring of 1991, Kelsang Gyatso announced the creation of the NKT-IKBU, an event which was celebrated by his students in the NKT-IKBU magazine ''Full Moon'' as "a wonderful development in the history of the Buddhadharma."&lt;ref&gt;Kay, D. N. (2004). ''Tibetan and Zen Buddhism in Britain: Transplantation, development and adaptation''. RoutledgeCurzon critical studies in Buddhism. London: RoutledgeCurzon. p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the NKT-IKBU was legally incorporated under English law,&lt;ref&gt;Kay, D. N. (2004). ''Tibetan and Zen Buddhism in Britain: Transplantation, development and adaptation''. RoutledgeCurzon critical studies in Buddhism. London: RoutledgeCurzon. p. 233. n26.&lt;/ref&gt; which constituted the formal foundation of the NKT-IKBU. The many Dharma Centres that were following Kelsang Gyatso's spiritual direction were gathered under the common auspices of the NKT-IKBU, with him as their General Spiritual Director (GSD). He remained GSD until August 2009 when he retired and was replaced by his successor, Gen-la Kelsang Khyenrab. Each of the individual Centers is legally and financially independent.&lt;ref&gt;Bluck, R. (2006). ''British Buddhism: Teachings, practice and development''. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Successor to Kelsang Gyatso===

From 1991 to 1995 [[Thubten Gyatso (NKT)|Gelong Thubten Gyatso]] was designated as Kelsang Gyatso's future successor. He disrobed in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;Bunting, Madeleine. [http://tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/archive/old?y=1996&amp;m=8&amp;p=18_1 ''Sect disrobes British monk'']. ''The Guardian''. 15 August 1996. Retrieved 2008-12-08.&lt;/ref&gt; and Kelsang Gyatso provisionally appointed 4 'Gen-las', i.e. Losang Kelsang, Kelsang Jangsem, Kelsang Dekyong and [[Samden Gyatso]]. After about a year, the former two resigned as Gen-las and were re-appointed as Resident Teachers. Samden Gyatso became the Deputy Spiritual Director and successor to Kelsang Gyatso while Kelsang Dekyong was appointed as the US National Spiritual Director. From this time onwards, the Deputy Spiritual Director also held the appointment of Resident Teacher at Manjushri Kadampa Meditation Centre.

In February 2007 Samden Gyatso resigned as Deputy Spiritual Director. Kelsang Khyenrab was appointed as Deputy Spiritual Director and became the General Spiritual Director when Kelsang Gyatso retired in Summer 2009.

In August 2001, Kelsang Gyato established a system of democratic succession for the General Spiritual Director of the NKT- IKBU. The ''Internal Rules'' state:

{{Quote|5§8. The term of office of the GSD shall be four years. At the end of his or her term of office, a person serving as the GSD shall not be eligible for immediate re-election. The term of office of the DSD shall be four years.&lt;ref name="internalrules" /&gt;}}

In 2008, Gen-la Khyenrab became Acting General Spiritual Director, under Kelsang Gyatso's supervision, and assumed the post of General Spiritual Director in August 2009 for a four-year term. Gen-la Dekyong, the National Spiritual Director of the United States of America, has in turn assumed the post of Deputy Spiritual Director,&lt;ref&gt;[http://kadampafestivals.org/fall/festival-teachers/ ''Festival Teachers: Gen-la Kelsang Dekyong'']. Retrieved 23 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; while retaining her post as US National Spiritual Director in accordance with the ''Internal Rules''.&lt;ref name="internalrules"/&gt; Gen-la Khyenrab retired as the General Spiritual Director due to ill health in April 2010 and, in accordance with the ''Internal Rules'', Gen-la Dekyong was appointed as General Spiritual Director.  Her position as Deputy Spiritual Director was taken by Gen-la Kunsang.

===Other teachers===

Alongside Kelsang Gyatso, who as founder and former spiritual director was the main teacher of the NKT-IKBU and his successors, all teachings (i.e. the three study programs) are held by Western students; lay persons and ordained alike. Qualification as an NKT-IKBU Dharma teacher is generally achieved by attending the NKT-IKBU's own Teacher Training Program,&lt;ref&gt;Cozort, Daniel (2003). ''The Making of the Western Lama''. Quoted in Heine, S., &amp; Prebish, C. S. (2003). ''Buddhism in the Modern World: Adaptations of an Ancient Tradition''. New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 231–232.&lt;/ref&gt; which Kelsang Gyatso regards as "a western equivalent to the traditional Tibetan [[Geshe]] degree."&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Helen (1997). ''Buddhism in Bath: Adaptation and Authority''. University of Leeds, Department of Theology and Religious Studies. p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cozort has noted that "Several of the most prominent Tibetan teachers have long recognized themselves the need to train Westerners as Dharma teachers."&lt;ref&gt;Cozort, Daniel (2003). ''The Making of the Western Lama''. Quoted in Heine, S., &amp; Prebish, C. S. (2003). ''Buddhism in the Modern World: Adaptations of an Ancient Tradition''. New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 221, 222.&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsang Gyatso explained the importance of Western Dharma teachers to the flourishing of Dharma in the world, saying that one fully qualified teacher is worth a thousand enlightened students.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Helen (2001). ''Representing Western Buddhism: A United Kingdom Focus''. Quoted in Beckerlegge, G. (2001). ''From Sacred Text to Internet''. Religion today, v. 1. Aldershot, Hants, England: Ashgate. p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; He expounded on the qualifications of NKT-IKBU teachers in 1990:

{{quote|Buddhadharma is beneficial to others only if there are qualified Teachers. Without Teachers, Dharma texts alone are of little benefit. To become a qualified Dharma Teacher requires special preparation and training. It is not easy to become a Dharma Teacher because special qualities are needed: wisdom, correct view, faith, conviction, and pure conduct as an example to others. Also a Teacher needs an inexhaustible reservoir of Dharma knowledge and experience to teach from, otherwise he or she will dry up after one or two years.&lt;ref name="kadampa.org"&gt;[http://kadampa.org/en/buddhism/fulfilling-our-wishes ''Wishfulfilling Jewels for Dharma Practitioners: The Benefits of the Foundation and Teacher Training Programs''] by Geshe Kelsang Gyatso. 1990-10-??. Retrieved 7 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Regarding the qualifications of NKT-IKBU teachers, Kay observed that "Whilst personal experience of the teachings is considered important, the dominant view within the NKT is that the main qualification of a teacher is their purity of faith and discipleship."&lt;ref&gt;Kay, D. N. (2004). ''Tibetan and Zen Buddhism in Britain: Transplantation, development and adaptation''. RoutledgeCurzon critical studies in Buddhism. London: RoutledgeCurzon. p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Robert Bluck, "Most teachers are appointed to centres by Kelsang Gyatso before they have completed the Teaching Training Programme and continue studying by correspondence, with an intensive study programme at Manjushri each summer."&lt;ref name="Bluck, R. 2006 p. 146"/&gt; Daniel Cozort explained that this is "rather like graduate students who teach undergraduate courses while pursuing their own Ph.D.'s."&lt;ref&gt;Cozort, Daniel (2003). ''The Making of the Western Lama''. Quoted in Heine, S., &amp; Prebish, C. S. (2003). ''Buddhism in the modern world: Adaptations of an ancient tradition''. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Kay found that lay people were almost as likely as monastics to be given teaching and leadership roles; and he sees this as an important Western adaptation of Gelug Buddhism, again because this includes tantric practices which Tsongkhapa restricted to those with "a solid grounding of academic study and celibate monastic discipline".&lt;ref&gt;Kay, D. N. (2004, p. 85), quoted in Bluck, Robert (2006). ''British Buddhism: Teachings, Practice and Development''. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kelsang Gyatso has said that monks, nuns, lay men and lay women can all become Spiritual Guides if they have the necessary experience, qualities and training.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsang Gyatso. (1992). ''Great treasury of merit: How to rely upon a spiritual guide''. Ulverston, U.K.: Tharpa Publications. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; All NKT-IKBU teachers, lay and ordained, study on the same study and retreat programmes. The ''Internal Rules'' specify the criteria for completing the programme:

{{Quote|15§6. A practitioner shall be deemed to have completed the Teacher Training Programme if he or she:

* Has attended the classes related to each of the twelve subjects;
* Has memorised all the required materials;
* Has passed examinations in all twelve subjects and received a certificate to that effect; and
* Has completed the required meditation retreats&lt;ref name="newkadampatruth.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newkadampatruth.org/ |title=New Kadampa Truth |work=''newkadampatruth.org'' |publisher=NKT-IKBU |accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition to the TTP commitment, all Resident Teachers have to attend International Teacher Training Program each year, taught in repeated rotation according to a sixteen-year study scheme.

Ordained and lay Resident Teachers who have taught successfully for four years are given the titles 'Gen' and 'Kadam', respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Bluck, Robert (2006). ''British Buddhism: Teachings, Practice and Development''. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former Senior Teachers===

====Kelsang Samden====
Kelsang Samden was appointed by Kelsang Gyatso as the General Spiritual Director of the New Kadampa Tradition in 2005. In 2008 he was disrobed and effectively excommunicated by Kelsang Gyatso following a sexual scandal, whereby Kelsang Samden was accused of attempting to establish his own sexual lineage in the New Kadampa Tradition by engaging in sexual relations with ordained and lay female NKT members, under the guise of such activities being part of Highest Yoga Tantra spiritual practice. It was alleged that his activities had caused great harm to the women concerned, with at least one of the women involved falling pregnant and attempting suicide. Kelsang Samden denied any wrongdoing but disappeared from the organisation into obscurity under a cloud of disgrace.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nktworld.org/NKTinfo.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|is defined as the union of Kadampa Buddhist Centres, the international association of study and meditation centres that follow the pure tradition of Mahayana Buddhism derived from the Buddhist meditators and scholars Atisha and Je Tsongkhapa, introduced into the West by the Buddhist teacher Venerable Geshe Kelsang Gyatso, the Founder of the New Kadampa Tradition – International Kadampa Buddhist Union; and that follow the three New Kadampa Tradition Study Programmes; and that are guided by the code of moral discipline called The Internal Rules of the New Kadampa Tradition – International Kadampa Buddhist Union set out in this document.&lt;ref name="internalrules"/&gt;}}

The New Kadampa Truth website explains: "Its Internal Rules – containing numerous checks and balances on the behavior, election and dismissal of the administrators, teachers, and spiritual directors – also guard against any extreme behavior and are legally binding."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newkadampatruth.org/new-kadampa-tradition/#Smear:%20NKT%20is%20a%C2%A0cult New Kadampa Truth]&lt;/ref&gt; An NBO member describes them:

{{quote|Such guidelines are essential for maintaining the integrity of any organisation (and are also to be found in great detail in the [[Vinaya]]). Reading the booklet later in my room I found that it outlined processes for dealing with possible misdeeds of senior members who may, for example, have misappropriated funds, broke their vows, left the NKT tradition, or disseminated non-NKT teachings.&lt;ref name="Buddhism in Britain"&gt;[http://devworkernbo.typepad.com/nbo_development/2006/11/tara_centre.html Buddhism in Britain]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Growth===
The NKT-IKBU currently lists more than 200 centres and around 900 branch classes/study groups in 40 countries,&lt;ref name="map.kadampa.org"/&gt; with an estimated 8,000 members.&lt;ref name="Waterhouse, Helen 2002. p. 940"/&gt; The centres are independent charitable corporations, and the groups are branches off an established centre which meet weekly in places such as churches and community centres.&lt;ref&gt;Bunting, Madeleine. [http://www.tibet.com/dholgyal/CTA-book/chapter-5-4.html ''Shadow boxing on the path to Nirvana'']. ''The Guardian'', 6 July 1996. Retrieved 2008-12-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, Waterhouse says the NKT-IKBU "is very good at marketing its product", with Centers and branches producing leaflets that advertise local NKT-IKBU groups in their respective towns,&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Helen (1997). ''Buddhism in Bath: Adaptation and Authority''. University of Leeds, Department of Theology and Religious Studies. p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; a level of publicity that according to Jones is comparatively more "forceful and extroverted" with regard to other Buddhist groups, and has helped the NKT-IKBU to achieve "a phenomenal increase in membership and centres."&lt;ref name="bpf.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bpf.org/tsangha/jonesbritbudd.html |title=Many Bodies, One Mind: Movements in British Buddhism |first=Ken |last=Jones |year=1996 |accessdate=21 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207091007/http://bpf.org/tsangha/jonesbritbudd.html |archivedate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another attraction is the high level of activity at an NKT-IKBU Dharma centre, where it is often possible to be taking part at the centre every day of the week, in contrast to other groups "which meet on a weekly basis but provide little other support or activity."&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Helen (1997). ''Buddhism in Bath: Adaptation and Authority''. University of Leeds, Department of Theology and Religious Studies. p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bluck attributes NKT-IKBU's rapid growth to "a wish to share the Dharma rather than ‘conversion and empire-building’."&lt;ref&gt;Bluck, Robert (2006). ''British Buddhism: Teachings, Practice and Development''. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Kay says that the NKT-IKBU is sensitive to criticism on the subject of expansion and cites Kelsang Gyatso's response to any criticisms about its outreach efforts, stating that "every organization 'tries to attract more people with appropriate publicity.'"&lt;ref&gt;Kay, David (2004). ''Tibetan and Zen Buddhism in Britain: Transplantation, Development and Adaptation''. RoutledgeCurzon critical studies in Buddhism. London: RoutledgeCurzon. p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

New Dharma centres are expected to be self-supporting,&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Helen (1997). ''Buddhism in Bath: Adaptation and Authority''. University of Leeds, Department of Theology and Religious Studies. p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; as neither Kelsang Gyatso nor the NKT-IKBU owns the centres.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Helen (1997). ''Buddhism in Bath: Adaptation and Authority''. University of Leeds, Department of Theology and Religious Studies. p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kadampa Meditation Centers===

A Kadampa Meditation Centre (KMC) is a Kadampa [[Dharma]] Center that serves the local, national, and international communities. A KMC is generally more centrally organised than regular Kadampa Buddhist Centers. Besides having a program of courses for the local community, KMCs host major gatherings such as Dharma Celebrations, National Festivals, and International Festivals. They are also home to the International Kadampa Temples. KMCs are non-profit organisations and all their annual profits are donated to the International Temples Project. There are currently 18 KMCs around the world, with several in the US.

===Temples for World Peace, World Peace Cafés, and Hotel Kadampas===

The NKT-IKBU has established a Kadampa Buddhist Temple in the United Kingdom, as well as in Canada, the United States, and Spain; recently opened a Temple in Brazil, with plans to build one in Germany too.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/subdivisions/kadampa.shtml Religion and Ethics, BBC Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The NKT-IKBU states in its publicity that:

{{quote|The International Temples Project was established by Venerable Geshe Kelsang in the early nineties. The vision is to build a Kadampa Temple for World Peace in every major city in the world.

"World Peace Cafés" have opened at some NKT Centers, starting in Ulverston, UK and now in other countries including the United States.

In 2005 the NKT-IKBU opened their first "World Peace Hotel", called "Hotel Kadampa": a no-smoking, alcohol-free hotel in Southern Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kadampa.org/en/centers/hotel-kadampas ''Hotel Kadampas'']. NKT-IKBU official website. Retrieved 7 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; (A second Hotel Kadampa opened in Montecatini in Tuscany, Italy, but has since closed). The hotel "functions as a normal hotel but with the benefit of a shrine room and meditation teaching. The absence of alcohol and loud entertainment attracts those who appreciated a quiet and peaceful atmosphere."&lt;ref name="Buddhism in Britain"/&gt;

===International Retreat Centers===

International Retreat Centers (IRCs) are centres that offer facilities for those wishing to do both long-term and short-term meditation retreats. Tharpaland International Retreat Centre was founded by Kelsang Gyatso in 1985, when he began a three-year retreat there, and has since hosted thousands of people. Kailash International Retreat Center&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nkt-irc-kailash.org Kailash International Retreat Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in Switzerland in 2007.

==Separation from contemporary Tibetan Buddhism==
The NKT-IKBU is one of the largest Buddhist movements in the UK, which describes itself as "a new organization making an ancient tradition accessible to all", by combining Tibetan tradition with western adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;Chryssides, George (1999). ''Exploring New Religions''. London: Cassell. pp. 235, 237.&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] professor Peter Clarke sees a paradox here, and has characterised the NKT-IKBU as a "controversial Tibetan Buddhist [[New Religious Movement]],"&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, P. B. (2006). ''New religions in global perspective: A study of religious change in the modern world''. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-25748-4}}. p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; not because of any moral failings but because of the NKT-IKBU's separation from contemporary Tibetan Buddhism. Madeleine Bunting writes:

{{quote|The NKT is a fascinating, entirely new chapter in the history of Eastern spirituality in the West. There are no salacious sex scandals here, nor any suggestion of material corruption – there are no fleets of Bhagwan-style Rolls Royces. The spiritual naivety of Westerners has not been exploited for spiritual or material gain, but they have become foot soldiers in a Tibetan feud.&lt;ref&gt;Bunting, Madeleine. [http://www.tibet.com/dholgyal/CTA-book/chapter-5-4.html ''Shadow boxing on the path to Nirvana'']. ''The Guardian'', 6 July 1996. Retrieved 2009-05-26.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===New Kadampa Tradition and Gelugpa Tradition===
According to the NKT-IKBU, it is Tibetan in its antecedents and follows the teachings of the historic, "Old" [[Kadampa]] and the "[[New Kadam]]" Tradition of [[Je Tsongkhapa]], the latter of which became the [[Gelug]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="meditationincolorado.org"&gt;Belither, James. [http://www.meditationincolorado.org/history_new_kadampa_tradition.htm ''Modern Day Kadampas: The History and Development of the New Kadampa Tradition''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211123509/http://www.meditationincolorado.org/history_new_kadampa_tradition.htm |date=11 December 2008 }}. Retrieved 7 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics on the other hand characterise the NKT-IKBU as "a breakaway movement and argue that the New Kadampa Tradition, as it is known today, is not part of the ancient Kadampa Tradition but a split from the [contemporary] Gelug school."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/subdivisions/kadampa.shtml ''The New Kadampa Tradition'']. BBC. Retrieved 8 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder of the [[Gelug]] school, [[Je Tsongkhapa]], and his disciples were popularly known as the "new school of Kadam."&lt;ref&gt;Dalai Lama (1988). ''The Union of Bliss and Emptiness: A Commentary on the Lama Choepa Guru Yoga Practice''. Ithaca, N.Y.: Snow Lion Publications. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Je Tsongkhapa himself referred to his monastic order as "the [[New Kadam]]"&lt;ref name="Cozort, Daniel 2003 p. 230"/&gt; (Tib. ''Kadam Sarpa'').&lt;ref name="With Geshe Kelsang Gyatso' 1998, p. 74"&gt;''An Interview With Geshe Kelsang Gyatso'' by Donald S. Lopez, Jr. [[Tricycle Magazine]], Spring 1998, Vol. 7 No. 3. p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The term Gelug came into use only after his death.&lt;ref name="Lopez, Donald S. 1998 p. 193"&gt;Lopez, Donald S. (1998). ''Prisoners of Shangri-La: Tibetan Buddhism and the West''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Je Tsongkhapa's apparent [[eclecticism]] was actually "an attempt to determine which teachings and practices should be considered normative."&lt;ref name="Powers, John 2002. p. 533"&gt;Powers, John. "Gelukpa Tibetan Buddhism" entry in Melton, J. Gordon, and Martin Baumann. 2002. ''Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices''. Santa Barbara, Calif: ABC-CLIO. p. 533.&lt;/ref&gt; In creating a new synthesis of Buddhist doctrine, ethics and practice, Je Tsongkhapa endeavoured "to rid Tibetan [Buddhism] of its [[Bön|pre-Buddhist shamanic elements]],"&lt;ref name="Chryssides, George 1999 p. 237"&gt;Chryssides, George (1999). ''Exploring New Religions''. London: Cassell. p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; and the NKT-IKBU sees itself as continuing to keep Tsongkhapa's unique form of Buddhism free of non-Buddhist teachings and practices.&lt;ref name="Chryssides, George 1999 p. 235"&gt;Chryssides, George (1999). ''Exploring New Religions''. London: Cassell. p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, Kelsang Gyatso explains:

{{quote|It is the tradition of both Atisha and Je Tsongkhapa to base all their teachings on the word of Buddha and never to teach anything that contradicts Buddha's teachings. According to these two great Teachers, unless an instruction is referred to in either the Sutras or the Tantras it cannot be regarded as an authentic Buddhist teaching, even if it is a so-called '[[Terma (Buddhism)|terma]]', or 'hidden treasure text'. Whenever they gave teachings or composed texts, both Atisha and Je Tsongkhapa quoted liberally from both the Sutras and the Tantras. In this way they showed their great respect for Buddha's original teachings and emphasized the importance of being able to trace instructions back to them.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsang Gyatso (1992). ''Great Treasury of Merit: A Commentary to the Practice of Offering to the Spiritual Guide''. London: Tharpa Publications, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In short, Waterhouse says that "the early Gelugpa legacy is one which the NKT wishes to emulate" and that the name of the organisation itself makes a statement about its "perceived roots within the 'pure' transmission of [Atisha's] Indian Buddhism into Tibet."&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Helen (1997). ''Buddhism in Bath: Adaptation and Authority''. University of Leeds, Department of Theology and Religious Studies. p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lopez, "For Kelsang Gyatso to call his group the New Kadampa Tradition, therefore, is ideologically charged, implying as it does that he and his followers represent the tradition of the founder, [[Je Tsongkhapa|Tsong kha pa]], more authentically than the [[Gelug|Geluk]] establishment and the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] himself."&lt;ref name="Lopez, Donald S. 1998 p. 193"/&gt; Kay comments:

{{quote|In defining the movement in this way, the organisation is not simply maintaining that it represents Buddhism adapted for westerners; it is also striving to underline its separation from the Tibetan Gelug sect and emphasise the point that the West – via the NKT – is now the guardian and custodian of the pure tradition of Tsongkhapa in the modern world. From an NKT viewpoint, Geshe Kelsang has played a unique role in the transmission of Tsongkhapa's pure teachings, and the organisation and study structures he has created in the West are now believed to protect and preserve a tradition that is all but lost in its indigenous Eastern context.&lt;ref&gt;Kay, David (2004). ''Tibetan and Zen Buddhism in Britain: Transplantation, Development and Adaptation''. RoutledgeCurzon critical studies in Buddhism. London: RoutledgeCurzon. pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kelsang Gyatso uses the terms New Kadampa and Gelugpa synonymously, in accordance with his lineage gurus&lt;ref&gt;Pabongka (1927), ''Liberation in the Palm of Your Hand: A Concise Discourse on the Path to Enlightenment'' (2006). Boston: Wisdom Publications, pp. 19, 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dorjeshugden.com/articles/musicdelighting.pdf ''Music Delighting the Ocean of Protectors'' (1967)] by Kyabje Trijang Dorje Chang. p. 11. Retrieved 7 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the current Dalai Lama,&lt;ref&gt;Dalai Lama (1997). ''The Gelug/Kagyü Tradition of Mahamudra''. Ithaca, N.Y.: Snow Lion Publications. p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dalai Lama (1995). ''The Path to Enlightenment''. Ithaca, N.Y.: Snow Lion Publications. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; who explained: "So we call the teachings of both Atisha and Je Tsongkhapa the Kadampa tradition, and then slowly this becomes the New Kadampa and then finally it is known as the Gelugpa."&lt;ref&gt;Dalai Lama, quoted in Laird, Thomas (2006). ''The Story of Tibet: Conversations with the Dalai Lama''. New York: Grove Press. pp. 125, 417 (n. 125).&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsang Gyatso refers to NKT-IKBU practitioners as Gelugpas,&lt;ref&gt;Kelsang Gyatso. (1997). ''Heart Jewel: The Essential Practices of Kadampa Buddhism''. London: Tharpa. p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; defining ''Gelug'' as:

{{quote|The tradition established by Je Tsongkhapa. The name 'Gelug' means 'Virtuous Tradition'. A Gelugpa is a practitioner who follows this tradition. The Gelugpas are sometimes referred to as the 'new Kadampas'.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsang Gyatso (2002). ''Clear Light of Bliss: The Practice of Mahamudra Vajrayana Buddhism''. Ulverston [etc.]: Tharpa Publications. p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kadampa.org/en/reference/glossary-of-buddhist-terms-f-j#gelug "Gelug" entry] in Glossary of Buddhist Terms, NKT-IKBU website. Retrieved 8 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When asked about the relationship between the NKT-IKBU and the Gelug tradition, Kelsang Gyatso again self-identified as a Gelugpa:

{{quote|We are pure [[Gelugpa]]s. The name Gelugpa doesn't matter, but we believe we are following the pure tradition of Je Tsongkhapa. We are studying and practicing Lama Tsongkhapa's teachings and taking as our example what the ancient [[Kadampa]] lamas and geshes did. All the books that I have written are commentaries on Lama Tsongkhapa's teachings. We try our best to follow the example of the ancient Kadampa Tradition and use the name Kadampa to remind people to practice purely.&lt;ref name="With Geshe Kelsang Gyatso' 1998, p. 74"/&gt;}}

The closing prayers of all NKT-IKBU spiritual practices include two dedication prayers for the flourishing of the 'Virtuous Tradition' (i.e., the Gelugpas), these being "recited every day after teachings and pujas at all Gelugpa monasteries and Dharma Centres."&lt;ref&gt;Kelsang Gyatso. (1997). ''Heart Jewel: The Essential Practices of Kadampa Buddhism''. London: Tharpa. pp. 109, 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the words, "New Kadampa Tradition", James Belither (NKT Secretary for 20 years) states that the "word 'New' is used not to imply that it is newly created, but that it is a fresh presentation of [[Buddhism|Buddhadharma]] in a form and manner that is appropriate to the needs and conditions of the modern world."&lt;ref name="meditationincolorado.org"/&gt;

===Kadampa Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism===

According to Waterhouse, Kelsang Gyatso "has broken away from the school's representatives in India and [[Tibet]]."&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, Helen (2001). ''Representing western Buddhism: a United Kingdom focus''. quoted in Beckerlegge, G. (2001). ''From sacred text to internet. Religion today'', v. 1. Aldershot, Hants, England: Ashgate. p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Cozort confirms that the NKT-IKBU "is not subordinate to Tibetan authorities other than Geshe Gyatso himself."&lt;ref name="Cozort, Daniel 2003 p. 231"&gt;Cozort, Daniel (2003). ''The Making of the Western Lama''. Quoted in Heine, S., &amp; Prebish, C. S. (2003). ''Buddhism in the modern world: Adaptations of an ancient tradition''. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; James Belither explained that the NKT-IKBU "does not accept the Dalai Lama's authority 'simply because there is no political or ecclesiastical reason for doing so.'"&lt;ref&gt;Belither, James. quoted in Barrett, D. V. (2001). ''The new believers: A survey of sects, cults and alternative religions''. London: Cassell. p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of presenting itself as a Tibetan tradition, James Belither has said that the NKT-IKBU is "a Mahayana Buddhist tradition with historical connections with Tibet", saying it wishes "to present [[Dharma]] in a way appropriate to their own culture and society without the need to adopt [[Tibetan culture]] and customs."&lt;ref&gt;Belither, James. quoted in Bluck, R. (2006). ''British Buddhism: Teachings, practice and development''. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-39515-1}}. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Bluck sees an "apparent contradiction between claiming a pure Tibetan lineage and complete separation from contemporary Tibetan religion, culture and politics."&lt;ref&gt;Bluck, R. (2006). ''British Buddhism: Teachings, practice and development''. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-39515-1}}. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; The NKT-IKBU disagrees that there is a contradiction, saying "It is possible to be a follower of Je Tsongkhapa's lineage but not a Tibetan Buddhist, just as a child of Russian immigrants to America may consider themselves American but not Russian."&lt;ref&gt;[http://newkadampatruth.wordpress.com/2008/12/07/has-the-nkt-broken-away-from-the-mainstream/ ''Has the NKT broken away from the mainstream?'']. New Kadampa Truth blog. 7 December 2008. Retrieved 2008-12-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the NKT-IKBU's separation from contemporary Tibetan Buddhism, the commitments undertaken by its members also include maintaining "a deep respect" for all Dharma teachings and other Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Bluck, R. (2006). ''British Buddhism: Teachings, practice and development''. Routledge critical studies in Buddhism. London: Routledge. p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about sectarianism between the Gelugpas and other schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], Kelsang Gyatso replied:

{{quote|Of course we believe that every [[Nyingma]]pa and [[Kagyu]]pa have their complete path. Not only [[Gelug]]pa. I believe that Nyingmapas have a complete path. Of course, Kagyupas are very special. We very much appreciate the example of [[Marpa Lotsawa|Marpa]] and [[Milarepa]] [in the Kagyu lineage]. Milarepa showed the best example of guru devotion. Of course the Kagyupas as well as the Nyingmapas and the [[Sakya]]pas, have a complete path to enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;''An Interview With Geshe Kelsang Gyatso'' by Donald S. Lopez, Jr. [[Tricycle Magazine]], Spring 1998, Vol. 7 No. 3. p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Dorje Shugden demonstrations==
{{main|Dorje Shugden controversy|}}

Martin Mills states that recent disputes over Shugden are focused on the claims of the British-based New Kadampa Tradition, which broke away from the Gelug school.
{{quote|Recent disputes within the Gelukpa Order over the status of the Dharma Protector Dorje Shugden have focused on claims by a breakaway order of the Gelukpa, the British-based New Kadampa Tradition, that Shugden is of Buddha status (most Gelukpa commentators place him as a worldly deity).&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Martin.

'''''Psilocybe cyanescens''''' (sometimes referred to as '''wavy caps''' or as the '''potent Psilocybe'''&lt;ref name=MD/&gt;) is a species of potent [[psychedelic mushroom]].  The main compounds responsible for its psychedelic effects are [[psilocybin]] and [[psilocin]]. It belongs to the family [[Hymenogastraceae]]. A formal description of the species was published by [[Elsie Wakefield]] in 1946 in the [[Transactions of the British Mycological Society]], based on a specimen she had recently collected at [[Kew Gardens]].&lt;ref name=wakefield&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dennis|first=R.W.G.|author2=Wakefield, E.M. |title=New or interesting British fungi|journal=Transactions of the British Mycological Society|date=1 September 1946|volume=29|issue=3|pages=141–166|doi=10.1016/S0007-1536(46)80038-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had begun collecting the species as early as 1910.&lt;ref name=fieldmyco/&gt;&lt;ref name=duffy&gt;{{cite web|last=Duffy|first=Thomas|title=Toxic Fungi of Western North America|url=http://www.mykoweb.com/TFWNA/P-49.html|work=Myokoweb|accessdate=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Although not a print source, Duffy is a former president of the MSSF and recognized expert.  --&gt; The mushroom is not generally regarded as being physically dangerous to adults.&lt;ref name=GGMM&gt;{{cite book |title=Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms) |year=2000 |author=Paul Stamets |publisher=Ten Speed Press |page=329 |isbn=978-1-58008-175-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gartz1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gartz|first=Jochen|title=Observations on the ''Psilocybe cyanescens'' complex of Europe and America|journal=Ann. Mus. Civ Rovereto|year=1998|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since all the psychoactive compounds in ''P. cyanescens'' are [[Aqueous solution|water-soluble]], the fruiting bodies can be rendered non-psychoactive through [[parboiling]], allowing their culinary use.  However, since most people find them overly bitter and they are too small to have great nutritive value, this is not frequently done.&lt;ref name=GGMM/&gt;

''Psilocybe cyanescens'' can sometimes fruit in colossal quantity; more than 100,000 mushrooms were found growing in a single patch at a racetrack in England.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

==Description==

===Appearance===
''Psilocybe cyanescens'' has a [[hygrophanous]] [[pileus (mycology)|pileus]] (cap) that is caramel to chestnut-brown when moist, fading to pale buff or slightly yellowish when dried.  Caps generally measure from 1.5–5&amp;nbsp;cm (½" to 2") across, and are normally distinctly wavy in maturity.&lt;ref name=MD/&gt;  The color of the pileus is rarely seen in mushrooms outside of the ''P. cyanescens'' species complex.  Most parts of the mushroom, including the cap and [[Lamella (mycology)|Lamellae]] (gills, underneath the cap) can stain blue when touched or otherwise disturbed, probably due to the oxidation of psilocin.&lt;ref name=Gartz1/&gt;&lt;ref name=MP&gt;{{cite book|last=Spoerke|first=edited by David G.|title=Handbook of mushroom poisoning : diagnosis and treatment|year=1994|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=978-0-8493-0194-0|author2=Rumack, Barry H. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lamellae are adnate, and light brown to dark purple brown in maturity, with lighter gill edges.  There is no distinct [[annulus (mycology)|annulus]], but immature ''P. cyanescens'' specimens do have a cobwebby veil which may leave an annular zone in maturity.&lt;ref name=MD/&gt;  Both the odor and taste are [[farinaceous]].

''P. cyanescens'' has smooth, elliptical spores which measure 9 - 12 x 5 - 8&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref name=PMW&gt;{{cite book | first=Paul | last=Stamets | year=1996 | title=Psilocybin Mushrooms of the World | publisher=Ten Speed Press | location=Berkeley | isbn=0-9610798-0-0| page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some authors, the [[holotype]] collection of the species from [[Kew Gardens]] featured no pleurocystidia, but North American collections are characterized by common clavate-mucronate pleurocystidia.&lt;ref name=GGMM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gartz1/&gt; However, pleurocystidia are present in the [[holotype]] collection (but not easily to observe since hymenium is collapsed). In  European collections of ''P. cyanescens'', pleurocystidia are common and their shape is identical to those known from the United States.&lt;ref name=wakefield/&gt;&lt;ref name=JB2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borovička|first=Jan|title=The wood-rotting bluing ''Psilocybe'' species in central Europe - an identification key|journal=Czech Mycology|year=2008|volume=60|issue=2|pages=173–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, an [[epitype]] from Hamburg, Germany was designated.&lt;ref name="Borovička 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borovička J, Rockefeller A, Werner PG |title=''Psilocybe allenii'' – a new bluing species from the west coast, USA |journal=Czech Mycology |year=2012 |pages=181–95 |volume=64 |issue=2 |url=http://czechmycology.org/_cmo/CM64207.pdf &lt;!-- alternate URL: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233864673_Psilocybe_allenii__a_new_bluing_species_from_the_Pacific_Coast_USA/file/d912f50c63f6f8c95c.pdf --&gt; |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fresh sporocarps and mycelia of ''P. cyanescens'' generally bruise blueish or blue-green where damaged, and the staining remains visible after drying.  This staining is most noticeable on the stem (which is white when undisturbed) but can also occur on other parts of the mushroom, including the gills, cap,&lt;ref name=MD/&gt; and mycelium.&lt;ref name=GGMM/&gt;  This staining is due primarily to the oxidation of psilocin.  (Psilocybin cannot be oxidized directly, but is quickly converted via enzymatic action to psilocin at injury sites which can then be oxidized, so even specimens with little psilocin still generally blue.)&lt;ref name=Gartz1/&gt;&lt;ref name=MP/&gt;

===Related species===

Other related species may include ''[[Psilocybe weraroa|P. weraroa]]'', and these relatives are collectively referred to as the "''Psilocybe cyanescens'' complex" or as the "caramel-capped psilocybe complex," due to their extremely similar appearance and habit.&lt;ref name=GGMM/&gt;  There is phylogenetic evidence that there are two distinct clades in the complex, one consisting of ''P. cyanescens'' and ''P. azurescens'' and allies, and the other consisting of ''P. serbica'' and allies (European taxa).&lt;ref name=seco&gt;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borovička|first=Jan|author2=Noordeloos, Machiel E. |author3=Gryndler, Milan |author4=Oborník, Miroslav |title=Molecular phylogeny of ''Psilocybe cyanescens'' complex in Europe, with reference to the position of the secotioid Weraroa novae-zelandiae|journal=Mycological Progress|volume=10|issue=2|pages=149–155|doi=10.1007/s11557-010-0684-3|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been shown that ''[[Psilocybe weraroa]]'' (previously known as ''Weraroa novae-zelandiae'') is very closely related to ''P. cyanescens'' despite its vastly dissimilar appearance.&lt;ref name=seco/&gt;

A very close relative of ''P. cyanescens'' is ''[[Psilocybe allenii]]'' (described in 2012), formerly known as ''Psilocybe cyanofriscosa'', a mushroom found in [[California]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]&lt;ref name=beugmag&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beug|first=Michael|title=The Genus ''Psilocybe'' of North America|journal=Fungi Magazine|year=2011|volume=4|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Borovička|first=Jan |author2=Rockefeller Alan |author3=Werner Peter G. |title=''Psilocybe allenii'' – a new bluing species from the Pacific Coast, USA|journal=Czech Mycology|year=2012|volume=64|issue=2|pages=181–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be distinguished by macromorphological features and/or sequencing of rDNA ITS molecular marker.

It is often difficult or impossible to distinguish between members of the ''P. cyanescens'' complex except by range without resorting to microscopic or molecular characters.&lt;ref name=GGMM/&gt;

Although not closely related, ''Psilocybe cyanescens'' has been at least occasionally confused with ''[[Galerina marginata]]'' with fatal results.{{Citation needed|reason=Need a source for claims of actual fatalities related to mistaken ID.|date=September 2018}}  The two mushrooms have generally similar habits and appearances, and bear a superficial resemblance to each other such that inexperienced mushroom-seekers may confuse the two.&lt;ref name=MD/&gt;  The two species can grow side-by-side, which may add to the chance of confusion.&lt;ref name=beug2&gt;{{cite web|last=Beug|first=Michael|title=POISONOUS AND HALLUCINOGENIC MUSHROOMS|url=http://academic.evergreen.edu/projects/mushrooms/phm/s8.htm|work=Evergreen State College|accessdate=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- this is not a published/peer-reviewed work but Beug is a recognized expert making a simple observation within his own field--&gt;

==Habitat and distribution==
''Psilocybe cyanescens'' grows today primarily on wood chips, especially in and along the perimeter of mulched plant beds in urban areas,&lt;ref name=fieldmyco/&gt; but can also grow on other lignin-rich substrates.&lt;ref name=GGMM/&gt; ''P. cyanescens'' does not grow on substrate that is not lignin-rich.&lt;ref name=MD/&gt;&lt;ref name= GGMM/&gt; Fruitings have been reported in natural settings previously (although most appear to be migrations from mulched plant beds.)&lt;ref name=GGMM/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;  The species does not typically grow on mulch that is made from bark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stamets|first=Paul|title=Mycelium running : how mushrooms can help save the world|year=2005|publisher=Ten Speed Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=978-1-58008-579-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, ''P. cyanescens'' occurs mainly in the [[Pacific Northwest]], south to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].  It can also be found in areas such as [[Western Europe]], [[Central Europe]], New Zealand&lt;ref name="Borovička 2012"/&gt; and parts of west Asia (Iran).&lt;ref name=Asef2010&gt;{{cite book |title=قارچهای سمی ایران (Qarch-ha-ye Sammi-ye Iran) |trans-title=Poisonous mushrooms of Iran |year=2010 |author=Asef Shayan MR. |publisher=Iran shenasi |page=214 |isbn=978-964-2725-29-8 |language=Persian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The range in which ''P. cyanescens'' occurs is rapidly expanding, especially in areas where it is not native as the use of mulch to control weeds has been popularized.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Paul|title=Magic mushrooms thrive as weeds wane|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2001/jan/03/uknews|accessdate=28 August 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This rapid expansion of range may be due in part to the simple expedient of ''P. cyanescens'' mycelium having colonized the distribution network of woodchip suppliers and thus being distributed on a large scale with commercial mulch.&lt;ref name=fieldmyco/&gt; It has been documented to fruit in Spring on the East Coast of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.limyco.org/|title=Long Island Mycological Club|website=www.limyco.org|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it has been speculated that ''P. cyanescens''' native habitat is the coniferous woodlands of the north-western United States&lt;ref name=fieldmyco/&gt;&lt;ref name=GGMM/&gt; or coastal dunes in the PNW, the type specimen was described from mulch beds in Kew Gardens, and there is no widely accepted explanation of ''P. cyanescens'' original habitat.&lt;ref name=fieldmyco&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Peter J.A.|author2=Geoffrey Kibby |title=Aliens in the Flowerbeds: The fungal biodiversity of ornamental woodchips|journal=Field Mycology|date=January 2001|volume=2|issue=1 |url=http://www.fungi4schools.org/Reprints/Mycologist_articles/Post-16/Biodiversity/FM02pp006-011aliens.pdf &lt;!-- alternate URL: http://www.davidmoore.org.uk/Assets/fungi4schools/Reprints/Mycologist_articles/Post-16/Biodiversity/FM02pp006-011aliens.pdf --&gt;|doi=10.1016/s1468-1641(10)60081-3 |pages=6–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fruiting is dependent on a drop in temperature.&lt;ref name=GGMM/&gt; In the San Francisco Bay Area, this means that fruiting typically occurs between late October and February,&lt;ref name=MD&gt;{{cite book|last=Arora|first=David|title=Mushrooms demystified : a comprehensive guide to the fleshy fungi|year=1986|publisher=Ten Speed Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-89815-169-5|pages=371–372|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fruiting in other areas generally occurs in fall, when temperatures are between 10-18 °C (50-65 °F).&lt;ref name=GGMM/&gt;

''P. cyanescens'' often fruits gregariously or in cespitose clusters, sometimes in great numbers. 100,000 ''P. cyanescens'' fruits were once found growing on a racetrack in the south of England.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Solitary fruits are sometimes also found.&lt;ref name=GGMM/&gt;

==Indole content==
The fruits of ''P. cyanescens'' have been shown to contain many different [[indole alkaloids]] including [[psilocybin]], [[psilocin]], and [[baeocystin]].&lt;ref name=GGMM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gartz1/&gt; It has also been shown that ''P. cyanescens'' mycelium will contain detectable levels of psilocin and psilocybin, but only after the formation of [[primordia]].&lt;ref name=fbi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gross|first=Susan|title=Detecting psychoactive drugs in the developmental stages of mushrooms|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|date=May 2000|volume=45|issue=3 |pages=527–537 |pmid=10855955 |url=http://www.fanaticus.com/forensic.htm &lt;!-- alternate URL: http://www.seanet.com/~rwmcpherson/forensic.htm --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indole content has been shown to be higher in North American specimens of ''P. cyanescens'' than in European ones.&lt;ref name=Gartz1/&gt;  This was, however, caused by the fact that Gartz did not analyze the genuine ''P. cyanescens'' but ''P. serbica''.

North American fruiting bodies of ''P. cyanescens'' have been shown to contain between 0.66% and 1.96% total indole content by dry weight.&lt;ref name=beug&gt;{{cite journal|last=BEUG|first=M|author2=BIGWOOD, J |title=Psilocybin and psilocin levels in twenty species from seven genera of wild mushrooms in the Pacific Northwest, U.S.A|journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology|date=1 May 1982|volume=5|issue=3|pages=271–285|doi=10.1016/0378-8741(82)90013-7|pmid=7201053}}&lt;/ref&gt;  European fruiting bodies have been shown to have between 0.39% and 0.75% total indole content by dry weight.&lt;ref name=Gartz1/&gt;

North American specimens of ''P. cyanescens'' are among the most potent of psychedelic mushrooms.&lt;ref name=MD/&gt;&lt;ref name=GGMM/&gt;  Its potency means that it is widely sought after by users of [[recreational drugs]] in those areas where it grows naturally.&lt;ref name=GGMM/&gt;

==Cultivation==
''P. cyanescens'', like many other psilocybin containing mushrooms, is sometimes cultivated.&lt;ref name=GGMM/&gt;

Due to the fruiting requirements of the species, it is challenging but possible to get ''P. cyanescens'' to produce fruits indoors.&lt;ref name=GGMM/&gt; Outdoor cultivation in an appropriate climate is relatively easy.&lt;ref name=GGMM/&gt; Yield per pound of substrate is low when compared to other psilocybin containing mushrooms for both indoor and outdoor cultivation.&lt;ref name=GGMM/&gt;  The combination of poor yield and difficulty may explain why ''P. cyanescens'' is grown less frequently than some other psilocybin containing mushrooms.&lt;ref name=GGMM/&gt;

''P. cyanescens'' mycelium is much easier to grow than actual fruits are, can be grown indoors,&lt;ref name=GGMM/&gt; and is robust enough that it can be transplanted in order to start new patches.&lt;ref name=MD/&gt;  Mycelium can also be propagated via stem butt transplantation.&lt;ref name=GGMM/&gt;

Many of the cultivation techniques used with other members of the genus ''Psilocybe'' can be used to grow ''P. cyanescens'' as well.&lt;ref name=Gartz1/&gt;

Cultivated ''P. cyanescens'' contain approximately the same concentration of psilocin and psilocybin as natural examples do.&lt;ref name=Gartz1/&gt;

[[File:Psilocybe_cyanescens_spores_1000x.JPG|thumb|right|''Psilocybe cyanescens'' spores]]

==Legal status==
{{main|Legal status of psilocybin mushrooms}}

''P. cyanescens'' specimens do not fall under the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] because the convention does not cover naturally occurring plants that incidentally contain a scheduled drug.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite book|last=Lande|first=Adolf|title=Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances|year=1976|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|page=385}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many countries choose to prohibit possession of psilocybin containing mushrooms, including ''P. cyanescens'', under their domestic laws.&lt;ref name=erowid/&gt; &lt;!-- 'plants' here is not used only for kingdom plantae.  this use is consistent with how such documents use it--&gt;

Countries that have banned or severely regulated the possession of ''P. cyanescens'' include the United States, Germany, New Zealand, and many others. Although this is difficult to enforce since no species of Psilocybe mushroom has spores containing psilocybin or psilocin.&lt;ref name=erowid/&gt; Because of this, ''Psilocybe cyanescens'' spores are not illegal to possess in many US states.  (It is illegal to possess spores in Georgia and Idaho, and illegal to possess them with the intent to produce mushrooms in California.) &lt;ref name=erowid&gt;http://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms_law8.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- please add international information.  It belongs here, I just haven't tracked it down yet. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="946">'''Richard Zenor''' was a [[Mediumship|medium]] who channeled the master teacher Agasha and founded the [[Agasha Temple of Wisdom]]. Zenor's teachings were later collected in book form by one of the Temple's members, William Eisen, in the 1980s. The book ''Telephone Between Worlds'', by James Crenshaw, was written about Zenor and Agasha.

Agasha is also mentioned in the ''Churning of the Heart-Vol II'' by [[Swami Shivom Tirtha]], a spiritual guru from India in the [[Shaktipat]] tradition and a disciple of [[Swami Vishnu Tirtha]]. Swami Vishnu Tirth Maharaj was one among the 273 people accompanying Agasha 7000 years ago in Egypt.

The '''Safe Environment Fund''' was a [[Church of Scientology]] organization that raised funds for the defense of the Scientology executives indicted (and ultimately convicted) for their role in a [[conspiracy (crime)|criminal conspiracy]] against the [[United States Government]] and numerous other public and private organizations and individuals. The term "safe environment" was used by Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] to refer to his conception of Scientology's organizations as a bulwark against what he described as "the dangerous environment of the wog [non-Scientology] world, of injustice, sudden dismissals, war, atomic bombs" which would "only persist and trouble us if we fail to spread our safe environment across the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hubbard|first=L. Ron|title=Scientology makes a safe environment|series=Organization Executive Course volume 0|page=162|publisher=Church of Scientology of California Publications Organization|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to a petition submitted to the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] in May 1980, the Safe Environment Fund had "undertaken the responsibility of contributing toward the defendant's legal expenses in this case. The Safe Environment Fund is a charitable organization, associated with the Church of Scientology, and the monies needed for the defendant's legal defense have to be raised by public contributions and donations." The petition requested permission for [[Jane Kember]] and [[Mo Budlong]], two executives of the Church's [[Guardian's Office]] who had been extradited from [[England]] to face trial in the [[United States]], to appear at fund-raising events "to be held in various places in the United States". The petition was opposed by the government, which described the Safe Environment Fund as "an integral arm of the Church of Scientology created for the sole purpose of paying for the legal fees of the defendants, thus hiding the fact that the church was paying for these expenses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stafford|first=Charles|title=Scientology cases drag on and on|work=St. Petersburg Times|date=May 12, 1980|page=3A|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19800512&amp;id=hN8LAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LloDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6765,3304597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Safe Environment Fund was later described by former Guardian's Office staff member Janie Peterson, who had worked in the [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] Guardian Office until 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Girardi|first=Steven|title=Witnesses Tell of Break-ins, Conspiracy|work=Clearwater Sun|date=May 9, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testifying at the [[City of Clearwater Commission Hearing on the Church of Scientology]] on May 8, 1982, she reported that the Church told its members that the indictment of Scientology executives "was a big conspiracy by the government, that these — that was the reason these people were indicted, and that these people had, at no time, ever done anything wrong or not legal, that the government had no information that was correct. We were not told that they were, indeed, guilty of the crimes or that they even later pleaded guilty to the crimes." It was said to have raised "many, many thousands of dollars", though Church members involved in fund-raising were instructed "to tell any public official, the press, or anyone that we did not operate the Safe Environment Fund while we were on what's called Post Time; in other words, we were to say that it was totally separate, it was something we were doing on our time. We were not allowed to say that, in fact, it was a big part of our job." The Safe Environment Fund raised money from Scientologists through "rallies and meetings and that type of thing and [they would] talk about the indictees and how much money it was costing. And then the people were to give donations."&lt;ref&gt;Janie Peterson testimony. City of Clearwater Commission Hearing: The Church of Scientology. Transcript, May 8, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another fund-raising route was described by L. Ron Hubbard's former biographical researcher, [[Gerry Armstrong (activist)|Gerry Armstrong]], during his defense in the 1984 case ''[[Church of Scientology v. Gerald Armstrong]]''. After reading that Hubbard was responsible for writing the screenplay for the 1941 movie ''[[Dive Bomber (film)|Dive Bomber]]'', one of the Safe Environment Fund personnel came up with the idea of holding screenings of the film to raise money for the fund. Armstrong double-checked the provenance of the film to ensure that the fund's attribution of its authorship to Hubbard was accurate and found – despite Hubbard's claims to the contrary – that two other screenwriters were credited with the film. By this time, however, the fund had already put up posters and "glossy promotional items [in which] L. Ron Hubbard was noted as the man behind the scenes", and people had paid money to view the film.&lt;ref name="Miller-3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Russell|title=Bare-Faced Messiah|url=http://www.xenu.net/archive/books/bfm/preface.htm|page=3|publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co.|location=New York|date=1987|isbn=0-8050-0654-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Church of Scientology of California vs. Gerald Armstrong, Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles, no.

'''Sergius Golowin''' (31 January 1930 in [[Prague, Czech Republic]] – 17 July 2006 in [[Bern, Switzerland]]) was a [[Bern]] [[writer]], myths [[researcher]], [[librarian]], recording artist and [[publicist]].

== Life ==

Sergius Golowin was born in 1930 in Prague, Czechoslovakia (now the [[Czech Republic]]). In 1933, he and his mother, poet [[Alla von Steiger]], emigrated to [[Switzerland]], while Golowin’s Russian father, a [[sculptor]], lived in Paris without the family. 

After finishing school, Golowin became a library assistant at the "Berner Stadt- und Universitätsbibliothek" (literally: "Bern City- and University-Library"). He took part in the [[German Youth Movement|"Jugendbewegung"]]. During the 1950s he participated in "Tägel-Leist," one of Bern's subcultural discussion circles. From 1957 to 1968 Golowin worked as an [[archivist]] in [[Burgdorf, Switzerland|Burgdorf]]. From 1971 to 1981 he served in a local government office in Switzerland as a member of the party [[Landesring der Unabhängigen]] ("LdU", which was established by [[Gottlieb Duttweiler]] and others). In his LdU office, Golowin was an advocate for youth culture and worked to solve numerous ecological problems. Afterward, he was a free writer living near Bern.

Sergius Golowin wrote numerous books and articles, primarily about folklore and [[esotericism]]. For his work in folklore and exploring the counterculture, he was awarded the prize of the [[Schweizerische Schillerstiftung]] in 1974.

Golowin was a contemporary of many notable people and events. He provided assistance to [[Timothy Leary]] while Leary was in Swiss exile. Golowin was a friend of [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], and was portrayed by [[H. R. Giger]]. Golowin was present at the first performance of [[Polo Hofer]]'s legendary Bern band "Rumpelstilz" and the band played on behalf of Golowin's election campaign. Golowin was an acquaintance of [[Martin Schippert|Martin "Tino" Schippert]], founder of the Swiss [[Hells Angels]].

In 1973, Golowin teamed up with [[Klaus Schulze]], [[Witthüser &amp; Westrupp|Bernd Witthüser, Walter Westrupp]], Jörg Mierke, Jürgen Dollase and Jerry Berkers (the latter two of [[Wallenstein (band)|Wallenstein]]) to record the album "Lord Krishna von Goloka".&lt;ref&gt;{{discogs artist}}&lt;/ref&gt; This very experimental and highly sought-after album featured chantings by Golowin over improvised electronic instrumentation and acoustic guitar, and is considered by many to be a classic example of cosmic [[krautrock]].

'''[[Maharaja]] Sher Singh''' (4 December 1807 – 15 September 1843) was a son of Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]]. In 1841, he became [[Maharaja]] of the [[Sikh Empire]] and the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. 

In 1820, Maharaja Ranjit Singh granted him the privilege of being seated in the Darbar and bestowed civil and military honours on him. From 1831 to 1834 he acted as Governor of Kashmir and in 1834 he was a commander in the force that captured [[Peshawar]] from the Afghans.&lt;ref name=Hasrat/&gt;

==Birth==
He was the son of Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] and Maharani [[Mehtab Kaur]], who was also the mother of Prince Tara Singh (1807-1859). (Mehtab Kaur, who was also known as Mahitab Kaur, is not to be confused with Maharani Mahtab Devi Sahiba, daughter of Maharaja Sansar Chand of Kangra, another wife, who committed ''sati'' in 1839 with Ranjit Singh lying with his head on her lap.)

==Reign==
[[File:The Maha-raja Shere Singh.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The Maharaja Sher Singh]]
He became Maharaja on 27 January 1841,&lt;ref name=Hasrat&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx |title=Sher Singh, Maharaja |last1=Hasrat |first1=B.J. |work=Encyclopaedia of Sikhism, Editor-in-Chief Harbans Singh |publisher=Punjab University Patiala}}&lt;/ref&gt;  after the sudden death of [[Nau Nihal Singh]] whose death was set in motion, some say purposely, while returning from his father's cremation. He was the half brother of [[Nau Nihal Singh]]'s father, Maharaja [[Kharak Singh]].

Proclaimed Maharaja by his [[vizier|wazir]] (prime minister) [[Dhian Singh]] Dogra, he won the throne after a protracted siege of the [[Lahore Fort]] which was held by the Royal family. Thousands died in the siege. 

[[File:Maharaja Sher Singh (1807-1843) seated, attended by his council in the Lahore Fort..jpg|thumb|300px|Maharaja Sher Singh (1807-1843) seated, attended by his council in the Lahore Fort.]]

Historians record that he was not very smart politically and let the Dogra brothers take charge of all functions of state. The Dogras, like puppet masters, pulled the strings of others to bring about the death of Sher Singh. 

Sher Singh was killed as he reached for a new shotgun held by Ajit Singh Sandhawalia, who pulled the trigger. Sher Singh only had time to utter, "what treachery."  The Sandhawalias also murdered Dhian Singh. The Sandhawalias were thought to have also had designs on the empire.

==Legacy==
His palace is leased to [[Baring Union Christian College]].

==Origins==
Shwegyin Nikaya was founded in the mid-nineteenth century by a chief abbot monk in the village of [[Shwegyin, Banmauk|Shwegyin]]. It formally separated from the Thudhamma Nikaya during the reign of King [[Mindon Min]], and attempts to reconcile the two sects by the last king of Burma, [[Thibaw Min]], were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="phi"/&gt; Monks of the Shwegyin Nikaya did not participate in the nationalist and anti-colonial movement in [[British Burma]] of the early 1900s.

In the 1960s, with the ascent of [[Ne Win]] to power, the Shwegyin Nikaya gained monastic influence in the country, as Ne Win sought counsel from a monk at the [[Mahagandayon Monastery]], a Shwegyin monastery in [[Amarapura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Matthews|first=Bruce|author2=Judith A.

'''Stewardship''' is a [[theology|theological]] belief that humans are responsible for the [[world]], and should take care of it. Believers in stewardship are usually people who believe in one God who created the universe and all that is within it, also believing that they must take care of creation and look after it. Creation includes animals and the environment. Many religions and denominations have various degrees of support for [[environmental stewardship]].{{cn|date=January 2017}}   It can have political implications, such as in [[Christian Democracy]].

Many moderate and [[Progressive Christianity|progressive]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]s, [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], and [[Evangelical environmentalism|Evangelical]] [[Protestantism|Protestants]] see some form of [[environmentalism]] as a consequence of stewardship.  In [[Judaism|Jewish]], Christian and Muslim traditions, stewardship refers to the way time, talents, material possessions, or wealth are used or given for the service of [[God]].

Some [[pagan]] or secular views include a [[Gaia philosophy]] which accepts the Earth as a holy being or goddess.

The Jewish holiday of [[Tu Bishvat]], or “the Birthday of the Trees,” is also known as [[Jewish Arbor Day]]. Some want to expand it to a more global environmental focus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/articles/169926/the-jewish-earth-day/ The Jewish Earth Day]&lt;/ref&gt;

A biblical [[world view]] of stewardship can be consciously defined as:  "Utilizing and managing all resources God provides for the glory of God and the betterment of His creation."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Bugg, “Stewardship” in Holman Bible Dictionary (Holman: Tennessee, 1991), 1303-1304&lt;/ref&gt;   The central essence of biblical world view stewardship is managing everything God brings into the believer's life in a manner that honors God and impacts eternity.

Stewardship begins and ends with the understanding of God's ownership of all:
* "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End." ([[Revelation 22]]:13)
* "The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it." ([[Psalm 24]]:1)
* "To the Lord your God belong the heavens, even the highest heavens, the earth and everything in it." ([[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 10:14)
* "The land must not be sold permanently, because the land is mine and you are but aliens and my tenants." ([[Leviticus]] 25:23)
* "Who has a claim against me that I must pay? Everything under heaven belongs to me." ([[Book of Job|Job]] 41:11)

Stewardship is further supported and sustained theologically on the understanding of God's holiness as found in such verse as: [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:2{{bibleref2c-nb|Gen|1:2}}, [[Psalm 104]], [[Psalm 113]], 1 [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 29:10-20, Colossians 1:16, and Revelation 1:8.

There is a strong link between stewardship and environmentalism. What does it mean for humans 'to take care of the world'? Environmental stewardship is typically thought of as entailing reducing human impacts into the natural world. However, philosopher Neil Paul Cummins claims that humans have a special stewardship role on the planet because through their technology humans are able to save life from otherwise certain elimination. This is a modern-day interpretation of [[Noah’s Ark]], the cornerstone of human stewardship being technological protection and regulation.&lt;ref&gt;2010: Is the Human Species Special?: Why human-induced global warming could be in the interests of life, {{ISBN|978-1-907962-00-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian views==
Christian Stewardship refers to the responsibility that Christians have in maintaining and using wisely the gifts that God has bestowed. God wishes human beings to be his collaborators in the work of creation, redemption and sanctification. Increasingly this has referred to environmental protectionism. This also includes traditional Christian Ministries that share the resources of treasure, time and talent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mckennastewardship.org/Time_and_Talent.html Time &amp; Talent] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120718133823/http://mckennastewardship.org/Time_and_Talent.html |date=2012-07-18 }} McKenna Stewardship Ministry&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical references==
An example of stewardship is in Genesis 2:15{{bibleref2c-nb|Gen|2:15}}. ''"And the L&lt;SMALL&gt;ORD&lt;/SMALL&gt; God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it."'' The drive to "serve the garden in which we have been placed" (also Genesis 2:15) sees Christian influence in political and practical affairs.

The concept is also seen in Leviticus 25:1-5  ''"The L&lt;SMALL&gt;ORD&lt;/SMALL&gt; said to Moses on Mount Sinai, 2 "Speak to the Israelites and say to them: `When you enter the land I am going to give you, the land itself must observe a Sabbath to the L&lt;SMALL&gt;ORD&lt;/SMALL&gt;. 3 For six years sow your fields, and for six years prune your vineyards and gather their crops. 4 But in the seventh year the land is to have a Sabbath of rest, a Sabbath to the L&lt;SMALL&gt;ORD&lt;/SMALL&gt;. Do not sow your fields or prune your vineyards. 5 Do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the grapes of your untended vines. The land is to have a year of rest."''  The implication is that the land is not to be exhausted or abused for short-term gains.

Stewardship in Christianity follows from the belief that human beings are created by the same God who created the entire universe and everything in it. To look after the Earth, and thus God's dominion, is the responsibility of the Christian steward.

A useful quote explaining stewardship can be found in [[Psalms|Psalm]] 24:1: ''"The Earth is the Lord's and all that is in it, the world, and those who live in it"''.

A broader concept of stewardship is illustrated in Jesus’ parable of the “talents”, which refer to an amount of money but by implication (and by common use of the word in English) as “abilities."

Matthew 25.14-30 –

*14 ''"Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his property to them. 
*15 To one he gave five talents of money, to another two talents, and to another one talent, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey. 
*16 The man who had received the five talents went at once and put his money to work and gained five more. 
*17 So also, the one with the two talents gained two more. 
*18 But the man who had received the one talent went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money.''
*''19 After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. 
*20 The man who had received the five talents brought the other five. `Master,' he said, `you entrusted me with five talents. See, I have gained five more.'  
*21 His master replied, `Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'  
*22 The man with the two talents also came. `Master,' he said, `you entrusted me with two talents; see, I have gained two more.'  
*23 His master replied, `Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'  
*24 Then the man who had received the one talent came. `Master,' he said, `I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. 
*25 So I was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.'  
*26 His master replied, `You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? 
*27 Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.  
*28 `Take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents. 
*29 For everyone who has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him. 
*30 And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'''

Additionally, frequent references to the “tithe”, or giving of a “tenth” (the meaning of “tithe) are found throughout the Bible.  The tithe represents the returning to God a significant, specific, and intentional portion of material gain.  However, giving is not limited to the tithe or a specific amount, illustrated by Jesus’ comment that a woman who gave a very small amount had given more than those had given large amounts because ''“while they gave out of their abundance, she gave all she had to live on.”''  ([[Mark 12]].41-44; [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 21.1-4)

==Examples==
The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[political party]] "[[Christian Democratic Appeal|CDA]]" (Christian Democratic Appeal) lists stewardship as one of its four key ideals. This refers not only to taking care of the environment, but also a principled stand towards human as well as [[natural resources]]. A commitment to clear principles, rather than pragmatism, is another facet of stewardship.

Many Christians practice the spiritual discipline of intentional financial stewardship, giving to churches or other ministries.  Fewer, though still a significant number, commit time in service to the needy or in other areas, often utilizing and donating specialized skills and abilities.

'''''The Battle for God: Fundamentalism in Judaism, Christianity and Islam''''' is a book by best-selling author [[Karen Armstrong]] published in 2000 by [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]]/[[HarperCollins]] which the ''[[New York Times]]'' described as "one of the most penetrating, readable, and prescient accounts to date of the rise of the fundamentalist movements in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/26/books/holy-wars.html|date=Mar 26, 2000|title=Holy Wars|author=Chris Hedges|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=2010-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Battle for God'' traces the history of the rise of [[fundamentalism]] in the three major [[monotheistic]] faiths. Armstrong's analysis starts with developments in [[Jewish fundamentalism|Judaism]] and traces it through the creation of fundamentalism in [[Fundamentalist Christianity|Christianity]] to adoption of a similar approach to modernity in [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islam]].

==Synopsis==
Armstrong's central case rests on the confusion between ''mythos'' and ''logos'', using these in the technical sense suggested by [[Johannes Slok]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Slok|title=Devotional Language. Translated by Henrik Mossin.|publisher= Danbury: Walter De Gruyter Incorporated|year= 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myth concerns "what was thought to be timeless and constant in our existence... Myth was not concerned with practical matters but with meaning".&lt;ref&gt;[[Karen Armstrong]]. ''The Battle for God''; page xiv&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast "Logos was the rational, pragmatic and scientific thought that enabled men and women to function well in the world". In religion, logos appears in legal systems and practical action. By the eighteenth century, "people in Europe and America began to think that ''logos'' was the only means to truth and began to discount ''mythos'' as false and superstitious." Armstrong suggests that fundamentalists have turned their mythos into logos using the mindset of the modern scientific age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianethicstoday.com/Issue/029/The%20Battle%20For%20God%20%20By%20Karen%20Armstrong_029_29_.htm|author=Darrel Morgan|title=The Battle for God|date=Aug 2000|accessdate=2010-02-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805015838/http://www.christianethicstoday.com/Issue/029/The%20Battle%20For%20God%20%20By%20Karen%20Armstrong_029_29_.htm|archivedate=2009-08-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first part of the book, "The Old World and the New", compares the progression of the three monotheistic faiths between 1492, when [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] discovered [[Americas|America]], and 1870, when "The Franco-Prussian War had revealed the hideous effects of modern weaponry, and there was a dawning realisation that science might also have a malignant dimension."&lt;ref&gt;Karen Armstrong. ''The Battle for God''; page 136&lt;/ref&gt; It traces the way Jews and Muslims modernized during this period.

This leads to the modern period described in part two, “Fundamentalism”, when there was a growing adoption of a [[Biblical literalism|literalist]] interpretation of scripture in the United States, which eventually gave rise to ''[[The Fundamentals]]'', a series of 12 volumes refuting modern ideas published shortly before and during the [[World War I]], of which 3 million copies  were distributed to every pastor, professor and theological student across America by the largesse of oil millionaires. Though this led to a distinctive ideology, it was not till the 1980s that it emerged as a political force.

In Judaism, the growth of [[Zionism]] was given its biggest boost by the [[Holocaust]] which led to the establishment of the [[State of Israel]] in 1948. Although many traditional Jews migrated there, the most conservative rejected the secular interpretation of Zionism and it wasn't until the emergence of [[Gush Emunim]] after the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1974 that fundamentalism emerged in Israel as a political force.

In Islam, fundamentalism did not emerge until modernization had taken hold, first in [[Egypt]] with the creation of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] by [[Hasan al-Banna]]. Armstrong traces the development of [[Sunni]] fundamentalism under [[Sayyid Qutb]] and [[Shia]] fundamentalism under [[Ayatollah Khomeini]].

==Response==
After [[September 11 attacks|9/11]], Karen Armstrong became one of the best selling authors in the US, as people attempted to understand the culture of men capable of carrying out such acts. One reviewer points out that "9-11 holds a fresh irony. While Osama and Co. wouldn't exist without the hegemony of Western secularism to rally against, their most effective attack on the Great Satan has breathed new life into our own fundamentalist tendencies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=C.

'''Thudhamma Nikaya''' ({{lang-my|သုဓမ္မာနိကာယ}}, {{IPA-my|θudəma̰ nḭkàja̰|IPA}}; also spelt '''Sudhammā Nikāya''') is the largest monastic order of monks in Burma, with 85-90% of Burmese monks (250,000) belonging to this order.&lt;ref&gt;http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/seasia/thuddama.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of 9 legally sanctioned monastic orders (nikaya) in the country, under the 1990 Law Concerning Sangha Organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gutter |first1=Peter |year=2001 |title=Law and Religion in Burma |journal=Legal Issues on Burma Journal |publisher=Burma Legal Council |page=10 |issue=8 |url=http://www.blc-burma.org/pdf/liob/liob8.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thudhamma is considered a more pragmatic order than the [[Shwegyin Nikaya]], with looser rules regarding [[Vinaya]] regulations and is less hierarchical than the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Matthews |first1=Bruce |year=1993 |title=Buddhism under a Military Regime: The Iron Heel in Burma |journal=Asian Survey |publisher=University of California Press |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=411 |jstor=2645106 |doi=10.1525/as.1993.33.4.00p02742}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like all the major orders in Burma, Thudhamma Nikaya prohibits monks from engaging in political activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aung-Thwin |first1=Michael |year=2009 |title=Of Monarchs, Monks, and Men: Religion and the State in Myanmar |journal=Working Paper Series No. 127 |publisher=Asia Research Institute |issue=18 |url=http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/docs/wps/wps09_127.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Origins==
Thudhamma Nikaya was founded in the late 18th century by King [[Bodawpaya]], after a series of [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] reforms by prior [[Konbaung dynasty|Konbaung kings]] to purify and unite the Sangha. The name 'Thudhamma' comes from the Thudhamma Council (an ecclesiastical organization founded by Bodawpaya),  which in turn is named after Mandalay's [[Zayat|Thudhamma Zayats]], the meeting grounds for the Council.&lt;ref name="carb"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carbine|first=Jason A|title=Sons of the Buddha: Continuities and Ruptures in a Burmese Monastic Tradition|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|date=2011|volume=50|isbn=978-3-11-025409-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The office of the Supreme Patriarch ({{lang|my|သာသနာပိုင်}} or ''[[Thathanabaing of Burma|Thathanabaing]]''), similar to the position of [[Sangharaja]] in Thailand and Cambodia, dates back to the 13th century, started by the monk [[Shin Arahan]] in the [[Pagan Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="james"&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Helen|title=Governance and civil society in Myanmar: education, health, and environment|publisher=Psychology Press|date=2005|pages=81|isbn=978-0-415-35558-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Thathanabaing was responsible for managing the monastic hierarchy and education at monasteries. In 1784, King Bodawpaya assembled the Thudhamma Council, led by the Thathanapaing and four elders ({{lang|my|ထေရ်}} or ''thera'') to resolve a longstanding issue on the proper wearing of monk's robes (whether one or both shoulders should be exposed).&lt;ref name="james"/&gt; Toward the end of the [[Konbaung dynasty]], the council, which oversaw religious affairs in the kingdom, including the appointment of monastery abbots, Vinaya regulations, discipline of individual monks, and administration of Pali examination, was expanded to include 8 elders.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;

The '''Virgin of Los Remedios''' ({{lang-es|La Virgen de los Remedios}}) or '''Our Lady of Los Remedios''' ({{lang-pt|Nossa Senhora dos Remédios}}, {{lang-es|Nuestra Señora de los Remedios}}) is a [[Titles of Mary|title of the Virgin Mary]] developed by the [[Trinitarian Order]], founded in the late 12th century. The devotion became tied to the ''[[Reconquista]]'' of Spain, then still at its height. In the following century it spread to other parts of Europe. When Spain began the exploration and conquest of the Americas, it was a favorite devotion of the Spanish [[conquistador]]es. It remains a popular devotion in Spain and Latin America.

== Spain ==
The Virgin of Los Remedios is the patron saint of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Cristóbal de La Laguna]] and the island of [[Tenerife]].

== Mexico ==
It is believed that the best known image in the Western Hemisphere under this title of Mary was brought to Mexico by the ''conquistadores''. It is a small statue, measuring 27&amp;nbsp;cm (about 10.5 inches) in height. This image is strongly linked with the Spanish Conquest, especially the episode known as the ''[[La Noche Triste|Noche Triste]]'' or "Night of Sorrows". It is said [[Hernán Cortés|Cortés]] led his men to an indigenous religious sanctuary to escape the Aztecs, stopping here on their way to [[Otumba de Gómez Farías|Otumba]]. According to legend, one of Cortés's soldiers, Gonzalo Rodríguez de Villafuerte, was carrying a small image of the Virgin Mary and hid her under a [[Agave americana|maguey]] plant in order to retrieve and pay homage to her later if he survived. During a later battle in this area, the Spanish reported seeing a young girl throwing dirt into the eyes of the Aztecs to help the Spanish. Another legend states that this image appeared at the Cerro de los Pajaros, where a chapel was built in 1574, which later was expanded in 1628 with a vaulted roof and cupola.

Being connected with the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Conquest]], this image of the Virgin is considered to be “Spanish” and a patroness to them and to the indigenous who adopt Spanish ways. She is considered one of the Virgins who correlate with the four cardinal directions (in her case, the west), along with the Virgins of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Guadalupe]], of [[la Piedad]] and de la Bala.&lt;ref name="vremedios"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/1820-Virgen-de-los-Remedios |title=Virgen de los Remedios, Estado de México |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Virgin of Los Remedios, Mexico State |accessdate=2010-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205211309/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/1820-Virgen-de-los-Remedios |archive-date=2009-12-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite her importance to the area, this image was kept at the [[Mexico City Cathedral]] until 1810, when it was moved to her sanctuary in Naucalpan, dressed as a general. It was proclaimed a patroness of Spain and the “guardian of the Spanish Army.”&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt; The purpose of this was to counter [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla|Miguel Hidalgo]]’s use of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] as a symbol of his independence movement.&lt;ref name="vremedios"/&gt;

This image was center of one of the first annual processions to be held in Mexico, which went from the [[Santa Veracruz Church, Mexico City|Church of Santa Veracruz in Mexico City]] to her home sanctuary in [[Los Remedios National Park]].&lt;ref name="vremedios"/&gt; Its feast day is celebrated on September 1, when the sanctuary is profusely decorated with white flowers, including a carpet of flower petals in the San Miguel Arcangel esplanade.&lt;ref name="encmuc"&gt;{{cite web |title= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de Mexico Estado de Mexico Naucalpan de Juárez  |publisher=INAFED |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/mexico/mpios/15057a.htm  |language=Spanish |accessdate=2010-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sanctuary is not located in the mountainous western part of the municipality where [[Los Remedios National Park]] stands.&lt;ref name="jquiroz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/4900-Acueducto-de-Naucalpan,-tesoro-arquitect%C3%B3nico-%28Estado-de-M%C3%A9xico%29 |title=Acueducto de Naucalpan, tesoro arquitectónico (Estado de México) |first=José Luis |last=Quiroz T. |author= |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Naucalpan Aqueduct,architectural treasure (Mexico State |accessdate=2010-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112075905/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/4900-Acueducto-de-Naucalpan,-tesoro-arquitect%C3%B3nico-(Estado-de-M%C3%A9xico) |archive-date=2008-11-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her feast day is celebrated with dances knowns as “Los Apaches,” “Los Moros,” “Chichimecas” and “Pastorcitas,”&lt;ref name="vremedios"/&gt; with 450th anniversary of her finding celebrated in 1990.&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt;

In [[Chinese Buddhism]], '''Zhu Zixing''' is described as the first [[Chinese people|Chinese]] to be [[ordination|ordained]] and become a Buddhist via contact with others on the [[Silk Road]]. Zhu first went to [[central Asia]] in 260 to investigate [[Buddhism]], long before other Chinese [[monk]]s and travelers reached [[India]] to study Buddhism.
