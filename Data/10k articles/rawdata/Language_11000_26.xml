[[File:Usaf.e3sentry.750pix.jpg|thumb|A [[United States Air Force|USAF]] [[E-3 Sentry]]]]

An '''airborne early warning and control''' ('''AEW&amp;C''') system is an airborne [[radar picket]] system designed to detect aircraft, ships and vehicles at long ranges and perform [[command and control]] of the [[battlespace]] in an air engagement by directing fighter and attack aircraft strikes. AEW&amp;C units are also used to carry out [[Aerial surveillance|surveillance]], including [[Airborne ground surveillance|over ground targets]] and frequently perform C2BM (command and control, [[battle management]]) functions similar to an [[Air Traffic Control]]ler given military command over other forces. When used at altitude, the radar on the aircraft allows the operators to detect and track targets and distinguish between friendly and hostile aircraft much farther away than a similar ground-based radar.&lt;ref&gt;Neufeld, 1997, p.276&lt;/ref&gt; Like a ground-based radar, it can be detected by opposing forces, but because of its mobility, it is much less vulnerable to counter-attack.&lt;ref&gt;Neufeld, 1997, p.278&lt;/ref&gt;

AEW&amp;C aircraft are used for both defensive and offensive air operations, and are to the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]] and US forces trained or integrated [[Air Force]]s what the [[Operations room|Command Information Center]] is to a [[United States Navy|US Navy]] [[warship]], plus a highly mobile and powerful radar platform. The system is used offensively to direct fighters to their target locations, and defensively, directing counterattacks on enemy forces, both air and ground. So useful is the advantage of command and control from a high altitude, the United States Navy operates [[Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye]] AEW&amp;C aircraft off its [[Supercarrier]]s to augment and protect its carrier Command Information Centers (CICs). The designation ''airborne early warning'' (AEW) was used for earlier similar aircraft,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 2010, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Fairey Gannet AEW.3]] and [[Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star]], and continues to be used by the RAF for its [[Boeing E-3 Sentry|Sentry AEW1]], while AEW&amp;C (airborne early warning and control) emphasizes the [[Command and Control (Military)|command and control]] capabilities that may not be present on smaller or simpler radar picket aircraft. '''AWACS''' (Airborne Warning and Control System) is the name of the specific system installed in the E-3 and Japanese [[Boeing E-767]] AEW&amp;C airframes, but is often used as a general synonym for AEW&amp;C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boeing.mediaroom.com/1998-03-11-Boeing-Delivers-First-Two-767-AWACS-Introduces-Newest-Member-of-AEW-C-Family Boeing Delivers First Two 767 AWACS, Introduces Newest Member of AEW&amp;C Family]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gap /&gt;

==General characteristics==
[[File:Wellington Ic (R1629).jpg|thumb|Wellington Ic "Air Controlled Interception" showing rotating radar antenna]]

Modern AEW&amp;C systems can detect aircraft from up to {{convert|400|km|nmi|abbr=on}} away, well out of range of most surface-to-air missiles. One AEW&amp;C aircraft flying at {{convert|9000|m|abbr=on}} can cover an area of {{convert|312000|km2|abbr=on}}. Three such aircraft in overlapping orbits can cover the whole of [[Central Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nato.int/nato_static/assets/pdf/pdf_publications/20120103_awacs-e.pdf |title=AWACS: Nato's eyes in the sky |publisher=Nato |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; AEW&amp;C systems communicate with friendly aircraft, vectoring fighters towards bogeys, providing data on threats and targets, help extend their sensor range and make offensive aircraft more difficult to track, since they no longer need to keep their own radar active to detect threats.

==History of development==
After having developed [[Chain Home]]--the first ground-based [[early-warning radar]] detection system--in the 1930s, the British developed a radar set that could be carried on an aircraft for what they termed "Air Controlled Interception". The intention was to cover the North West approaches where German long range [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor]] aircraft were threatening shipping. A [[Vickers Wellington]] bomber (serial R1629) was fitted with a rotating antenna array. It was tested for use against aerial targets and then for possible use against German [[E boat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Air-Britain'', Aviation World, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, R "Air controlled interception" ''Radar Development to 1945'' R W Burns (ed)&lt;/ref&gt; Another radar equipped Wellington with a different installation was used to direct [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s toward [[Heinkel He 111]]s, which were air-launching [[V-1 flying bomb]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Flypast'' April 1987: "The First AWACS"&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lockheed EC-121M with F-4B.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lockheed EC-121]]M showing characteristic radar domes above and below fuselage]]
In February 1944, the U.S. Navy ordered the development of a radar system that could be carried aloft in an aircraft under Project Cadillac. A prototype system was built and flown in August on a modified [[Grumman TBF Avenger|TBM Avenger]] [[torpedo bomber]]. Tests proved successful, with the system being able to detect low flying formations at a range in excess of {{convert|100|mi|km}}. The U.S. Navy then ordered production of the TBM-3W, the first production AEW aircraft to enter service. TBM-3Ws fitted with the [[list of radars|AN/APS-20]] radar entered service in March 1945, with some 36–40 eventually being constructed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The [[Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV and EC-121 Warning Star]], which first flew in 1949 served widely with both the US Air Force and US Navy and provided the main AEW coverage for US forces during the Vietnam war. It was to remain operational until replaced with the E-3 AWACS, its intended successor. Developed roughly in parallel, [[N-class blimp]]s were also used as AEW aircraft, filling in gaps in radar coverage for the continental US, their tremendous endurance of over 200 hours being a major asset in an AEW aircraft, although lighter than air operations were discontinued in 1962 following a crash.

In 1958, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Tupolev|Tupolev Design Bureau]] was also ordered to design an AEW aircraft.&lt;ref name=Tu-114.1&gt;Gordon, 2006, p.86&lt;/ref&gt; After determining that the projected radar instrumentation wouldn't fit in a [[Tupolev Tu-95]] or a [[Tupolev Tu-116]], the decision was made to use the more capacious [[Tupolev Tu-114]] instead.&lt;ref name=Tu-114.1 /&gt; This solved the problems with cooling and operator space that existed with the narrower Tu-95 and Tu-116 fuselage.&lt;ref name=Tu-114.1 /&gt; To meet the flight range requirements, production examples were fitted with an air-to-air refueling probe.&lt;ref name=Tu-114.2&gt;Gordon, 2006, p.87&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting system, the [[Tupolev Tu-126]], entered service in 1965 with the [[Soviet Air Forces]] and remained in service until replaced by the [[Beriev A-50]] in 1984.&lt;ref name=Tu-114.2 /&gt;

==Current systems==
[[File:Aeronaves Ágata 7 - FAB - EMB145 Erieye.jpg|thumb|right|[[Embraer R-99|Embraer E-99]] airborne early warning and control]]

Many countries have developed their own AEW&amp;C systems, although the [[Boeing E-3 Sentry]] and [[Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye]] are the most common systems worldwide. The E-3 Sentry was built by the [[Boeing]] Defense and Space Group (now [[Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security]]) and was based on the [[Boeing 707|Boeing 707-320]] aircraft. Sixty-five E-3s were built and it is operated by the United States, NATO, the United Kingdom, France, and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;Neufeld, 1997, p.275&lt;/ref&gt;

The specially designed [[Grumman E-2 Hawkeye]] entered service in 1965 and has been operated by eight different nations. Over 168 have been produced so far and new versions continue to be developed, making it the most widely used AEW system. For the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]], the E-3 technology has been fitted into the [[Boeing E-767]].

After World War 2, the [[United Kingdom]] deployed a substantial AEW capability with American [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|Douglas AD-4W Skyraiders]], designated Skyraider AEW.1, which in turn were replaced by the [[Fairey Gannet AEW|Fairey Gannet AEW.3]], using the same AN/APS-20 radar. With the retirement of the conventional aircraft carriers, the Gannet was withdrawn and the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) installed the radars from the Gannets on [[Avro Shackleton]] MR.2 airframes, redesignated Shackleton AEW.2. To replace the Shackleton AEW.2, an AEW variant of the [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod]], known as the [[British Aerospace Nimrod AEW3|Nimrod AEW3]], was ordered in 1974. However, after a protracted and problematic development, this was cancelled in 1986, and seven E-3Ds, [[British military aircraft designation systems|designated]] Sentry AEW.1 in RAF service, were purchased instead.&lt;ref name="spyflight"&gt;[http://www.spyflight.co.uk/nim%20aew.htm "BAe Nimrod AEW 3."] ''Spyflight.''

[[File:KJ2000 at 2014 Zhuhai Air Show.jpg|thumb|left|[[People's Liberation Army Air Force|PLAAF]] [[KJ-2000]]]]

The Russian Air Force is currently using around 15–20 [[Beriev A-50|Beriev A-50 and A-50U "Shmel"]] in the AEW role. The "Mainstay" is based on the [[Ilyushin Il-76]] airframe, with a large non-rotating disk radome on the rear fuselage. These replaced the 12 [[Tupolev Tu-126]] that filled the role previously. The A-50 and A-50U will eventually be replaced by the [[Beriev A-100]], which features an AESA array in the radome and is based on the updated Il-476.&lt;ref&gt;Butowski, Piotr. "Model Reveals A-100 Configuration". ''[[Air International]]'', April 2014. Retrieved: 21 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1997, Russia and Israel agreed to jointly fulfill an order from China to develop and deliver an early warning system. China reportedly ordered one Phalcon for $250 million, which entailed retrofitting a Russian-made Ilyushin-76 cargo plane [also incorrectly reported as a Beriev A-50 Mainstay] with advanced Elta electronic, computer, radar and communications systems. Beijing was expected to acquire several PHALCON AEW systems, and reportedly could buy at least three more [and possibly up to eight] of these systems, the prototype of which was planned for testing beginning in 2000. Finally, in July 2000 the United States pressured Israel to back out of the $1 billion agreement to sell China four Phalcon phased-array radar systems. Following the cancelled A-50I/Phalcon deal, China turned to indigenous solutions. The Phalcon radar and other electronic systems were taken off from the unfinished Il-76, and the airframe was handed to China via Russia in 2002. The Chinese AWACS has a unique phased array radar (PAR) carried in a round radome. Unlike the US AWACS aircraft, which rotate their rotodomes to give a 360 degree coverage, the radar antenna of the Chinese AWACS does not rotate. Instead, three PAR antenna modules are placed in a triangular configuration inside the round radome to provide a 360 degree coverage. The installation of equipment at the Il-76 began in late 2002 aircraft by Xian aircraft industries (Xian Aircraft Industry Co.). The first flight of an airplane [[KJ-2000]] made in November 2003. All four machines will be equipped with this type. The last to be introduced into service the Chinese Air Force until the end of 2007.&lt;ref name="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/kj-2000.htm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kongjing-2000 (KJ-2000) Mainring|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/kj-2000.htm|website=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=1 April 2015|ref=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/kj-2000.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[Indian Air Force]] (IAF) and [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] (DRDO) began a study of requirements for developing an Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWAC) system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title= Development of Airborne Early Warning and Control System |publisher= Press Information Bureau, [[Government of India|GoI]] |date= 11 December 2003 |url= http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=123 |accessdate = 2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, DRDO delivered 3 AWACs, called Netra, to the air force with indigenous radar systems built on the Brazilian Embraer EMB-145 air frame.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-to-fill-gaps-in-aerial-vigilance/article17372941.ece|title=India to fill gaps in aerial vigilance|last=Peri|first=Dinaker|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-02-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netra gives a 240-degree coverage of airspace.The Emb-145 also has air-to-air refuelling capability for longer surveillance time.The Indian Air Force also operates three Israeli [[EL/W-2090]] systems (Il-76/Phalcon system deal canceled for China), the first of which first arrived on May 25, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3721499,00.html |title=Arms deal underway, first Israeli Phalcon lands in India – Israel News, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=June 20, 1995 |accessdate=June 1, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528073812/http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0%2C7340%2CL-3721499%2C00.html |archivedate=28 May 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India set to decide big military aircraft deals|url=http://www.indiastrategic.in/topstories1068.htm|publisher=India Strategic|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; India subsequently signed with Israel to pick up the A-50I instead of China, therefore, A50I adopted the 3-radar arrangement designed by Chinese team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ausairpower|url=http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-PLA-AWACS-Programs.html|website=Ausairpower.net|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DRDO is now developing a more advanced AWACS with a longer range and with a 360-degree coverage akin to the Phalcon system, based on the Airbus A-330 airframe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Royal Australian Air Force]], [[Republic of Korea Air Force]] and the [[Turkish Air Force]] are deploying [[Boeing 737 AEW&amp;C]] aircraft. Unlike the E-2 and E-3, the Boeing 737 AEW&amp;C does not use a rotating disk [[radome]] (rotodome) but instead has a large dorsal fin.

The [[Swedish Air Force]] uses the S 100B Argus as its AEW platform. The S 100B Argus is based on the [[Saab 340]] with an [[Ericsson]] [[Erieye radar|Erieye PS-890]] radar.

The [[Hellenic Air Force]], [[Brazilian Air Force]] and [[Mexican Air Force]] use the [[Embraer R-99]] with an [[Ericsson]] Erieye PS-890 radar, as on the S 100B.

In early 2006, the [[Pakistan Air Force]] ordered six Erieye AEW equipped [[Saab 2000]] from Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=07-Apr-2008 11:12 EDT |url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/sweden-finalizes-saab-2000-aewc-contract-with-pakistan-02377/ |title=Sweden Finalizes Saab 2000 AEW&amp;C Contract With Pakistan |publisher=Defenseindustrydaily.com |date=April 7, 2008 |accessdate=June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2006, the [[Pakistan Navy]] requested three excess [[P-3 Orion]] aircraft to be equipped with Hawkeye 2000 AEW systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c4isrjournal.com/story.php?F=2416333 |title=C4ISRJournal.com |publisher=C4ISRJournal.com |date=December 11, 2006 |accessdate=June 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708110548/http://www.c4isrjournal.com/story.php?F=2416333 |archivedate=July 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; China and Pakistan also signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] (MoU) for the joint development of AEW&amp;C systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Klasra|first1=Rauf|title=$278m AWACS deal struck with China|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=19041|work=The News International|date=18 December 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218180612/http://www.thenews.com.pk/top_story_detail.asp?Id=19041|archivedate=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel has developed the IAI/Elta [[EL/M-2075]] Phalcon system, which uses an AESA ([[active electronically scanned array]]) in lieu of a rotodome antenna. The system was the first such system to enter service. The original [[EL/M-2075|Phalcon]] was mounted on a [[Boeing 707]] &lt;ref name="B707 Phalcon, Israeli Weapons.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israeli-weapons.com/weapons/aircraft/phalcon/Phalcon.html |title=B707 Phalcon, "Israeli Weapons.com" |publisher=Israeli-weapons.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and developed for the Israeli Defense Force and for export.

==Helicopter AEW systems==
[[File:Royal Navy AEW Seaking Helicopter from 849 Naval Air Squadron MOD 45152082.jpg|thumb|Westland AEW Sea King]]
The British [[Westland Sea King|Sea King ASaC7]] naval helicopter was operated from [[Invincible class aircraft carrier|''Invincible''-class]] [[aircraft carrier]]s. The creation of Sea King ASaC7, and earlier AEW.2 and AEW.5 was the consequence of lessons learnt by the Royal Navy during the 1982 [[Falklands War]] when the lack of AEW coverage for the task force was a major tactical handicap, and left them vulnerable to low level attack. The [[Spanish Navy]] fields the [[SH-3 Sea King]] in the same role, operated from the LPH [[Juan Carlos I (L61)|''Juan Carlos I'']]''.''

The [[AgustaWestland AW101|AgustaWestland EH-101A AEW]] of the [[Italian Navy]] is operated from the aircraft carriers [[Italian aircraft carrier Cavour (550)|''Cavour'']] and [[Italian aircraft carrier Giuseppe Garibaldi (551)|''Garibaldi'']]. In 2018 the British will replace their Sea Kings with a modular "Crowsnest" system that can be fitted to any of their Merlin HM2 fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/thales-bags-selection-for-rn-crowsnest-system-412700/ | title=Thales bags selection for RN Crowsnest system | date=22 May 2015 | first=Craig | last=Hoyle | publisher=Flight Global}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian-built [[Kamov Ka-31]] is deployed by the [[Indian Navy]] on the aircraft carrier [[INS Vikramaditya (R33)|INS ''Vikramaditya'']] and [[Talwar-class frigate|''Talwar''-class frigates]] and will be deployed on the [[Vikrant-class aircraft carrier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ka-31 Radar Picket Airborne Early Warning (AEW) Helicopter, Russia|url=http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/ka31/|publisher=Airforce-technology|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian Navy has two Ka-31R variants, at least one of which was deployed on their aircraft carrier [[Admiral Kuznetsov class aircraft carrier|''Kuznetsov'']] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.combataircraft.net/2016/10/21/carrier-based-ka-52k-bound-for-syria/ | title=Carrier-based Ka-52K bound for Syria | journal=Combat Aircraft | date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is fitted with E-801M Oko (Eye) airborne electronic warfare radar that can track 20 targets simultaneously, detecting aircraft up to {{convert|150|km|abbr=on|-1}} away, and surface warships up to {{convert|200|km|abbr=on}} distant.

{{main article|Boeing E-3 Sentry|l1=Airborne Warning and Control System}}
[[Boeing]] produces a specific system&lt;ref name=gap&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1972/may-jun/pearce.html|title=AWACS to Bridge the Technological Gap|accessdate=14 February 2009 |publisher=Air University}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a rotating radar dome '[[rotodome]]' [[radome]] designed and built by [[Boeing]] (Defense &amp; Space Group) using [[Westinghouse Electronic Systems|Westinghouse]] (now [[Northrop Grumman]]) radar. It is mounted on either the [[E-3 Sentry]] aircraft ([[Boeing 707]]) or more recently the [[Boeing E-767]] ([[Boeing 767]]), the latter only being used by the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]].
When AWACS first entered service it represented a major advance in capability, being the first AEW to use a [[pulse-Doppler radar]], which allowed it to track targets normally lost in ground clutter.&lt;ref name=USAF&gt;Neufeld, 1997, p.271&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, low-flying aircraft could only be readily tracked over water.&lt;ref name=USAF /&gt;

'''Alumu''' is a [[Plateau language]] spoken by approximately 7,000 people in [[Nassarawa State]], [[Nigeria]]. It has lost the nominal affix system characteristic of the [[Niger–Congo family]].

Two varieties, Alumu and Tesu, differ only in intonation.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt; Akpondu is more divergent.

'''Arnaud de Saleta''' was a [[cleric]]  and [[béarnese dialect|Béarnese]] [[poet]] who served during the establishment of a [[Protestant]] state in the [[Kingdom of Navarra]] in the 16th century.

De Salette is one of two poets to be commissioned by Queen [[Jeanne d'Albret]] to translate the [[Psalms]] into [[Occitan language]] in 1568 (the other being [[Pey de Garros]] who made a translation into the [[Gascon dialect]]).  His translation was published in 1583 with its music score under the title "Psalmes de David metuts en rima bernesa".

According to [[critic]] [[Robèrt Lafont]], Arnaud de Salette is the first known Béarnese writer to use the dialect rather than the standard Occitan language.&lt;ref&gt;.''Arnaud de Salette est le premier écrivain béarnais connu qui utilise la langue du pays.'' Op cit, 301. "Arnaud de Salette is the first known Béarnese writer who uses the idiom of the country".&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''axial line''' is the line between two adjacent [[dermatomes]] that are not represented by immediately adjacent spinal levels. Although dermatomes are shown to be discrete segments on dermatomal maps (like in the image opposite), they are in fact not; adjacent dermatomes overlap with one another. This is one of the reasons for the variety of different dermatomal maps proposed. However, at axial lines, adjacent [[dermatomes]] do not overlap. An example of an axial line would be the line between the S2 and L4 dermatomes on the calf.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.inkling.com/read/clinically-oriented-anatomy-moore-agur-dalley-7th/chapter-5/fascia-veins-lymphatics&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a [[Fellow]] with the [[Hoover Institution]] at [[Stanford University]], a Fellow with the Future of Diplomacy Project at the [[Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs]] at The [[Harvard Kennedy School]], a visiting scholar at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] in Washington, D.C., and a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoover.org/profiles/ayaan-hirsi-ali|title=Ayaan Hirsi Ali|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Hirsi Ali was elected a member of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], the [[lower house]] of the [[States General of the Netherlands]], representing the centre-right [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD). A political crisis related to the validity of her [[Dutch citizenship]]—namely the accusation that she had lied on her application for political asylum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Critic of Islam to quit Holland after lies are exposed|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/1518532/Critic-of-Islam-to-quit-Holland-after-lies-are-exposed.html|accessdate=29 October 2017|work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;—led to her resignation from parliament, and indirectly to the fall of the [[Netherlands cabinet Balkenende-2|second Balkenende cabinet]] in 2006.

Hirsi Ali, a former Muslim who [[Apostasy in Islam|abandoned her faith]] and became an [[atheism|atheist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2015 National Convention Keynote Speaker|url=https://www.atheists.org/2014/07/american-atheists-islam-critic-womens-advocate-ayaan-hirsi-ali-to-be-2015-convention-keynote/|accessdate=10 October 2018|work=American Atheists|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been a vocal [[Criticism of Islam|critic of Islam]]. In 2004, she collaborated on a short movie with [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], entitled ''[[Submission (2004 film)|Submission]]'', a film depicting oppression of women under [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] Islamic law, critical of the Islamic canon itself. The film sparked controversy and death threats. Van Gogh was murdered later that year by [[Mohammed Bouyeri]], a Moroccan-Dutch [[Islamic terrorist]]. Hirsi Ali maintains that "Islam is part religion, and part a political-military doctrine, the part that is a political doctrine contains a world view, a system of laws and a moral code that is totally incompatible with our constitution, our laws, and our way of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/hearings/ideology-and-terror-understanding-the-tools-tactics-and-techniques-of-violent-extremism|title=Hearings - Homeland Security &amp; Governmental Affairs Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=hsgac.senate.gov|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having previously argued that Islam was beyond reform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/27/heretic-islam-reformation-ayaan-hirsi-ali-highlights-scale-of-the-task|title=Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now by Ayaan Hirsi Ali – review|first=Andrew|last=Anthony|date=27 April 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; in her latest book ''Heretic'' (2015) she calls for a reformation of Islam by defeating the [[Islamism|Islamists]] and supporting [[Liberalism and progressivism within Islam|reformist Muslims]].&lt;ref name=ReformersvsZealots&gt;{{cite web|title=The Islam reformers vs. the Muslim zealots|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-islam-reformers-vs-the-muslim-zealots/2015/03/27/acf6de6c-d3ed-11e4-ab77-9646eea6a4c7_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|date=27 March 2015|author=Ayaan Hirsi Ali|access-date=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after she was born, her father was imprisoned due to his opposition to the [[Siad Barre]] government.&lt;ref name="dangerwoman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Linklater|first=Alexander|title=Danger woman|url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,1485350,00.html|work=The Guardian|date=17 May 2005|accessdate =15 June 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/8663231 "A critic of Islam:  Dark secrets,"] ''[[The Economist]]''. Volume 382. Number 8515. ( 10–16 February 2007):  p. 87.  "The family's troubles began in 1969, the year Ms Hirsi Ali was born. That was also the year that Mohammed Siad Barre, a Somali army commander, seized power in a military coup. Hirsi Magan was descended from the traditional rulers of the [[Darod]], Somalia's second biggest clan. Siad Barre, who hailed from a lesser Darod family, feared and resented Ms Hirsi Ali's father's family, she says. In 1972, Siad Barre had Hirsi Magan put in prison from which he escaped three years later and fled the country."&lt;/ref&gt; Hirsi Ali's father had studied abroad and was opposed to [[female genital mutilation]], but while he was imprisoned, Hirsi Ali's grandmother had a man perform the procedure on her, when Hirsi Ali was five years old. According to Hirsi Ali, she was fortunate that her grandmother could not find a woman to do the procedure, as the mutilation was "much milder" when performed by men.&lt;ref name="dangerwoman" /&gt;

After her father escaped from prison, he and the family left Somalia in 1977, going to [[Saudi Arabia]] and then to [[Ethiopia]], before settling in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]] by 1980. There he established a comfortable upper-class life for them. Hirsi Ali attended the English-language Muslim Girls' Secondary School. By the time she reached her teens, Saudi Arabia was funding religious education in numerous countries and its religious views were becoming influential among many Muslims. A charismatic religious teacher, trained under this aegis, joined Hirsi Ali's school. She inspired the teenaged Ayaan, as well as some fellow students, to adopt the more rigorous Saudi Arabian interpretations of Islam, as opposed to the more relaxed versions then current in Somalia and Kenya. Hirsi Ali said later that she had long been impressed by the [[Qur'an]] and had lived "by the Book, for the Book" throughout her childhood.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/to-submit-to-the-book-is-to-exist-in-their-hell/2007/06/03/1180809336515.html "To submit to the Book is to submit to their Hell"], extract of speech in ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]],'' 4 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

She sympathised with the views of the [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[Muslim Brotherhood]], and wore a ''[[hijab]]'' with her school uniform. This was unusual at the time but has become more common among some young Muslim women. At the time, she agreed with the ''[[fatwa]]'' proclaimed against [[British Indian]] writer [[Salman Rushdie]] in reaction to the portrayal of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in his novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]''.&lt;ref name="lawcf.org"&gt;Interviewed by David Cohen, published 2 February 2007 [http://www.lawcf.org/index.asp?page=Evening+Standard+article+on+Islam+in+Britain LAWCF.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928140712/http://www.lawcf.org/index.asp?page=Evening+Standard+article+on+Islam+in+Britain |date=28 September 2007 }} and identically here  {{cite web |url=http://www.islamophobia-watch.com/islamophobia-watch/2007/2/7/violence-is-inherent-in-islam-it-is-a-cult-of-death.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716234644/http://www.islamophobia-watch.com/islamophobia-watch/2007/2/7/violence-is-inherent-in-islam-it-is-a-cult-of-death.html |archivedate=16 July 2007 |df=dmy-all }} Retrieved 24 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; After completing secondary school, Hirsi Ali attended a secretarial course at Valley Secretarial College in Nairobi for one year.&lt;ref name="asiantribune.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.asiantribune.com/index.php?q=node/175 |title=Controversial Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Muslim turned atheist, to resign from Dutch Parliament |work=Asian Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; As she was growing up, she also read English-language adventure stories, such as the [[Nancy Drew]] series, with modern heroine archetypes who pushed the limits of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/02/14/books/14grim.html?fta=y |work=The New York Times |title=No Rest for a Feminist Fighting Radical Islam |first=William |last=Grimes |date=14 February 2007 |accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, remembering her grandmother refusing soldiers entry into her house, Hirsi Ali associated with Somalia "the picture of strong women: the one who smuggles in the food, and the one who stands there with a knife against the army and says, 'You cannot come into the house.' And I became like that. And my parents and my grandmother don't appreciate that now - because of what I've said about the Qur'an. I have become them, just in a different way."&lt;ref name="dangerwoman" /&gt;

===Early life in the Netherlands===
Hirsi Ali arrived in the Netherlands in 1992. That year she had travelled from Kenya to visit her family in [[Düsseldorf]] and [[Bonn]], [[Germany]] and gone to the Netherlands to escape an alleged arranged marriage. Once there, she requested [[political asylum]] and obtained a residence permit. She used her paternal grandfather's early surname on her application and has since been known in the West as Ayaan Hirsi Ali. She received a residence permit within three or four weeks of arriving in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.npo.nl/zembla/24-10-2010/VARA_101247450 De heilige Ayaan], Zembla, 11 May 2006 (Includes streaming video; re-broadcast with introduction by the editor, 24 October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/04/weekinreview/04goodstein.html|title=Q.&amp; A. Ayaan Hirsi Ali – Laurie Goodstein|first=Interview By Laurie|last=Goodstein|date=4 February 2007|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first she held various short-term jobs, ranging from cleaning to sorting post.&lt;ref name="asiantribune.com"/&gt; She worked as a translator at a Rotterdam refugee center which, according to a friend interviewed in 2006 by ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper, marked her deeply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/may/21/jasonburke.theobserver |first=Jason |last=Burke |date=21 May 2006 |title=Secrets and lies that doomed a radical liberal |work=The Observer  |accessdate=6 May 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an avid reader, in the Netherlands she found new books and ways of thought that both stretched her imagination and frightened her. [[Sigmund Freud]]'s work introduced her to an alternative moral system that was not based on religion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;"To submit to the Book is to submit to their Hell," extract of speech in ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' 4 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; During this time she took courses in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and a one-year introductory course in [[social work]] at the De Horst Institute for Social Work in [[Driebergen]]. She has said that she was impressed with how well Dutch society seemed to function.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; To better understand its development, she studied at [[Leiden University]], obtaining an MSc degree in [[political science]] in 2000.

Between 1995 and 2001, Hirsi Ali also worked as an independent Somali-Dutch interpreter and translator, frequently working with Somali women in asylum centers, hostels for abused women, and at the Dutch immigration and naturalization service (IND, Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst). While working for the IND, she became critical of the way it handled asylum seekers.&lt;ref name="asiantribune.com" /&gt; As a result of her education and experiences, Hirsi Ali speaks six languages: English, [[Somali language|Somali]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Amharic language|Amharic]], and [[Dutch language|Dutch]].&lt;ref name="dangerwoman" /&gt;

==Political career==
After gaining her degree, Hirsi Ali became a fellow at the [[Wiardi Beckman Stichting]] (WBS), a think tank of the center-left [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA). Leiden University Professor Ruud Koole was steward of the party. Hirsi Ali's writing at the WBS was inspired by the work of the neoconservative Orientalist [[Bernard Lewis]].&lt;ref name="Oudenampsen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oudenampsen|first1=Merijn|date=19 September 2016|title=Deconstructing Ayaan Hirsi Ali: On Islamism, Neoconservatism, and the Clash of Civilizations|journal=Politics, Religion &amp; Ideology|volume=17|issue=2-3|pages=227–248|doi=10.1080/21567689.2016.1232195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She became disenchanted with Islam, and was shocked by the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States in 2001, for which [[al-Qaeda]] eventually [[Responsibility for the September 11 attacks#Osama bin Laden statements after 9/11|claimed responsibility]]. After listening to videotapes of [[Osama bin Laden]] citing "words of justification" in the Qur'an for the attacks, she wrote, "I picked up the Qur'an and the [[hadith]] and started looking through them, to check. I hated to do it, because I knew that I would find Bin Laden's quotations in there."&lt;ref&gt;Hirsi Ali, Ayaan, ''Infidel'', 2007, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time of transition, she came to regard the Qur'an as relative – it was a historical record and "just another book."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"To submit to the Book is to submit to their Hell," speech quoted in part, ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 4 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading ''[[Atheïstisch manifest]]'' ("Atheist Manifesto") of [[Leiden University]] philosopher [[Herman Philipse]] helped to convince her to give up religion. She [[Apostasy in Islam|renounced Islam]] and acknowledged her [[atheism|disbelief in God]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=h071222&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehumanist.com/magazine/january-february-2008/features/absolute-infidel-the-evolution-of-ayaan-hirsi-ali|work=The Humanist|date=22 December 2007|accessdate=3 November 2015|author= David Schaefer |author2= Michelle Koth|title=Absolute Infidel: The Evolution of Ayaan Hirsi Ali}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began to formulate her critique of Islam and [[Islamic culture]], published many articles on these topics, and became a frequent speaker on television news programs and in public debate forums. She discussed her ideas at length in a book entitled ''De Zoontjesfabriek'' (''The Son Factory'') (2002). In this period, she first began to receive death threats.&lt;ref name=h071222/&gt;

In November 2002, after disagreements with the PvdA about what security measures they would offer her as a member, she sought advice from [[Cisca Dresselhuys]], the editor of the feminist magazine ''[[Opzij]],'' on how to gain government funding for what was essentially political protection.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;!--Explanation is needed for how/why Hirsi Ali, as simply a party member, could be covered for personal security by the government – is this commonly provided for members of parties in power if they receive threats?--&gt;

Dresselhuys introduced Hirsi Ali to [[Gerrit Zalm]], the parliamentary leader of the center-right [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD), and party member [[Neelie Kroes|Neelie-Smit Kroes]], then European Commissioner for Competition. At their urging, Hirsi Ali agreed to switch to their party of the VVD and stood for election to Parliament. Between November 2002 and January 2003, she lived abroad while on the payroll as an assistant of the VVD.

In 2003, aged 33, Hirsi Ali became a prominent candidate in the parliamentary election campaign. She said that the Dutch welfare state had overlooked abuse of Muslim women and girls in the Netherlands and their social needs, contributing to their isolation and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simons |first=Marlise |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/22/international/europe/22HOLL.html |title=Muslim Woman Favoured in a Dutch Election |location=Netherlands |work=The New York Times |date=22 January 2003 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won her seat.

During her tenure in Parliament, Hirsi Ali continued her criticisms of Islam and many of her statements provoked controversy. In an [[#Muhammad|interview in the Dutch newspaper ''Trouw'']], she said that by Western standards, Muhammad as represented in the Qu'ran would be considered a [[pedophile]]. A religious discrimination complaint was filed against her on 24 April 2003 by Muslims who objected to her statements. The Prosecutor's office decided not to initiate a case, because her critique did "not put forth any conclusions in respect to Muslims and their worth as a group is not denied".&lt;ref&gt;Ayaan Hirsi Ali niet vervolgd, ''Volkskrant,'' 24 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film with van Gogh===
[[File:TheoVanGogh.jpg|thumb|[[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]]]]
Working with writer and director [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], Hirsi Ali wrote the script and provided the voice-over for ''[[Submission (2004 film)|Submission]]'' (2004),&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=846339861805446088&amp;q=submission+Van+Gogh Submission], on [[Google Video]] 29 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; a short film that criticised the treatment of [[women and Islam|women in Islamic society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/index.php?content=20070104 |title=Voices on Antisemtisim: Interview with Ayaan Hirsi Ali|publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |date=4 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juxtaposed with passages from the [[Qur'an]] were scenes of actresses portraying Muslim women suffering abuse. An apparently nude actress dressed in a semi-transparent ''[[burqa]]'' was shown with texts from the [[Qur'an]] written on her skin. These texts are among those often interpreted as justifying the subjugation of Muslim women. The film's release sparked outrage among many Dutch Muslims.

[[Mohammed Bouyeri]], a 26-year-old [[Dutch Moroccan]] [[Islamist]] and member of the Muslim terrorist organisation [[Hofstad Group]], assassinated van Gogh in an [[Amsterdam]] street on 2 November 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cluskey|first1=Peter|title=Dutch await what they feel will be inevitable terrorist attack|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/dutch-await-what-they-feel-will-be-inevitable-terrorist-attack-1.2763519|accessdate=29 March 2017|work=The Irish Times|date=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bouyeri shot van Gogh with a handgun eight times, first from a distance and then at short range as the director lay wounded on the ground. He was already dead when Bouyeri cut his throat with a large knife and tried to decapitate him. Bouyeri left a letter pinned to Van Gogh's body with a small knife; it was primarily a death threat to Hirsi Ali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/controversial-filmmaker-shot-dead-531777.html|title=Controversial filmmaker shot dead|publisher=''The Independent''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/ayaan-hirsi-ali-my-life-under-a-fatwa-760666.html |title=Ayaan Hirsi Ali: My life under a fatwa |work=The Independent |date=27 November 2007 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[AIVD|Dutch secret service]] immediately raised the level of security they provided to Hirsi Ali.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=48&amp;story_id=29964&amp;name=Battling+the+racists Klausen, J.

In 2004 a rap song about Hirsi Ali was produced and distributed on the Internet. The lyrics included violent threats against her life. The rappers were prosecuted under Article 121 of the Dutch criminal code because they hindered Hirsi Ali's execution of her work as a politician. In 2005 they were sentenced to community service and a suspended prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nu.nl/news.jsp?n=474058&amp;c=15 Werkstraf voor 'Hirsi Ali-rappers'], nu.nl, 27 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirsi Ali went into hiding, aided by government security services, who moved her among several locations in the Netherlands. They moved her to the United States for several months. On 18 January 2005, she returned to parliament. On 18 February 2005, she revealed where she and her colleague [[Geert Wilders]] were living. She demanded a normal, secured house, which she was granted one week later.

In January 2006 Hirsi Ali was recognised as "European of the Year" by ''[[Reader's Digest]],'' an American magazine. In her speech, she urged action to prevent Iran from developing [[nuclear weapon]]s. She also said that [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] should be taken at his word in wanting to organise a conference to investigate objective evidence of the [[Holocaust]], noting that the subject is not taught in the Middle East. She said, "Before I came to Europe, I'd never heard of the Holocaust. That is the case with millions of people in the Middle East. Such a conference should be able to convince many people away from their denial of the genocide against the Jews."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelid=G4SN8CRU Geen Iraanse atoombom toelaten], ''De Standaard'' (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt; She also said that what some have described as "Western values" of freedom and justice were universal. But she thought that Europe has done far better than most areas of the world in providing justice, as it has guaranteed the freedom of thought and debate required for critical self-examination. She said communities cannot reform unless "scrupulous investigation of every former and current doctrine is possible."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=G4SN8CNR Ayaan Hirsi Ali betreurt zelfcensuur Europa], ''De Standaard''. (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt; Hirsi Ali was nominated as a candidate for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] the same month by Norwegian parliamentarian [[Christian Tybring-Gjedde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.siste.no/utenriks/drapstruet-filmskaper-foreslatt-til-nobelprisen/s/1-103-1906381|title=Drapstruet filmskaper foreslått til Nobelprisen [Death-threatened filmmaker suggested for Nobel Prize]|language=Norwegian|work=Siste.no|date=15 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006 she co-signed a letter entitled "[[MANIFESTO: Together facing the new totalitarianism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MANIFESTO Together facing the 'new totalitarianism |work=Toronto Star |date=2 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the eleven other signatories was Salman Rushdie; as a teenager, Hirsi Ali had supported the fatwa against him. The letter was published in response to protests in the [[Islamic world]] surrounding the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]] in Denmark, and it supported freedom of press and freedom of expression.

On 27 April 2006 a Dutch judge ruled that Hirsi Ali had to abandon her current secure house at a secret address in the Netherlands. Her neighbors had complained that she created an unacceptable security risk, but the police had testified that this neighborhood was one of the safest places in the country, as they had many personnel assigned to it for Hirsi Ali's protection.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Hitchens]]: [http://www.slate.com/id/2141276/ "The Caged Virgin – Holland's shameful treatment of Ayaan Hirsi Ali"], ''Slate'', 8 May 2006.

A private trust, the [[Foundation for Freedom of Expression]], was established in 2007 in the Netherlands to help fund protection of Ayaan Hirsi Ali and other Muslim dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pzc.nl/algemeen/binnenland/article2262815.ece |title=Hirsi Ali zamelt bewakingsgeld in |date=4 December 2007 |accessdate=8 May 2010 |work=PZC |first=Lianne |last=Sleutjes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch citizenship controversy===
In May 2006 the TV programme ''[[Zembla (TV series)|Zembla]]'' reported that Hirsi Ali had given false information about her name, her age, and her country of residence when originally applying for asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbxP8Uys8kc|title=Christian Right's Favorite Ex-Muslim Ayaan Hirsi Ali EXPOSED AS FAKE – Dutch Doc " HOLY Ayaan !! "|first=|last=MCDebate|date=7 October 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her asylum application, she had claimed to be fleeing a forced marriage, but the ''Zembla'' coverage featured interviews with her family, who denied that claim.&lt;ref&gt;''The Islamic Challenge: Politics and Religion in Western Europe'', Klausen, J., New York: Oxford University Press, 2005; "She wasn't forced into a marriage. She had an amicable relationship with her husband, as well as with the rest of her family. It was not true that she had to hide from her family for years."&lt;/ref&gt; The program alleged that, contrary to Hirsi Ali's claims of having fled a Somali war zone, the MP had been living comfortably in upper middle-class conditions safely in Kenya with her family for at least 12 years before she sought refugee status in the Netherlands in 1992.

In her version of events, she had fled civil war in Somalia, was forced into an arranged marriage with a man whom she had never met, and was not present at her own wedding. Upon escaping she was forced into hiding in the Netherlands, for her ex-husband and father's brothers would have been by Somali custom, required to perform an honor killing. The accounts of various witnesses varied greatly from hers. According to them, she left Somalia prior to any mass violence, and led a comfortable, upper-middle class life in neighboring Kenya, where she attended a Muslim Girls' school and received a full western-style education with focus on the Humanities and Science, her brother attended a Christian school, she lied to the Dutch immigration service about coming from Somalia in order not to be sent back to Kenya, and they allege she met her husband a few days before her wedding. After several meetings with him, they allege she agreed to the marriage, even though her mother said Ayaan should finish her education so she could afford to leave him if the marriage should prove unsuccessful. They also allege that Hirsi Ali was present at the wedding, something her brother later denied, and according to several witnesses appeared to be enjoying herself. Hirsi Ali denies all of this. On her way to Canada, she says she travelled to Holland by train during a stopover in Germany, and applied for political asylum. During her stay in Holland she regularly received letters from her father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Conway|first=Isabel|title=MP may be deported over claims she lied to win asylum|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/mp-may-be-deported-over-claims-she-lied-to-win-asylum-478265.html|newspaper=''The Independent''|date=15 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary also quoted several native Somalians as saying there is no tradition of honor killing in Somalia, something that is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somaliaonline.com/community/topic/disturbing-news-honor-killings/|title=Disturbing news: honor killings, Somalia Online, 5 January 2006|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirsi Ali admitted that she had lied about her full name, date of birth, and the manner in which she had come to the Netherlands, but persisted in saying she was trying to flee a forced marriage. She noted that her first book, ''The Son Factory'' (2002), provided her real name and date of birth. She had also stated these in a September 2002 interview published in the political magazine ''[[HP/De Tijd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=19&amp;story_id=29954&amp;name=Liberals+don't+care+Hirsi+Ali+lied+to+get+asylum+in+1992 Liberals don't care Hirsi Ali lied to get asylum in 1992], ''Expatica,'' 12 May 2006 Retrieved 24 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,druck-416242,00.html Hirsi Ali verlässt die Niederlande], ''[[Der Spiegel]],'' 15 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tagesschau.de/aktuell/meldungen/0,1185,OID5527658_REF1,00.html Hirsi Ali will die Niederlande verlassen]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Tagesschau (Germany)|Tagesschau]], 15 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and in an interview in the ''VARA gids'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zemblabla.nl/VARA%20TV%20MAGAZINE.pdf Astrid ontmoet Ayaan (PDF)], ''VARA TV Magazine'', 7 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Hirsi Ali asserted in her 2006 autobiography (2007 in English) that she made full disclosure of the matter to VVD officials when invited to run for parliament in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Hirsi Ali| first = Ayaan| title = Infidel| year = 2007| publisher = Free Press| isbn = 978-0-7432-8968-9| pages = 298, 338}} [[Infidel: My Life]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known on what grounds she received political asylum. On the issue of her name, she applied under her grandfather's surname in her asylum application, to which she was entitled; she later said it was to escape retaliation by her clan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/islam-critic-fed-up-with-holland-hirsi-ali-plans-to-move-to-america-a-416299.html|title=Islam Critic: Fed Up with Holland, Hirsi Ali Plans to Move to America|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=15 May 2006|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the later parliamentary investigation of Hirsi Ali's immigration, the Dutch law governing names was reviewed. An applicant may legally use a surname derived from any generation as far back as the grandparent. Therefore, Hirsi Ali's application, though against clan custom of names, was legal under Dutch law. The question of her age was of minor concern.&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/c0d30b34-07d4-11db-9067-0000779e2340.htmlHirsi Ali dispute brings down Dutch government], ''Financial Times,'' 30 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Media speculation arose in 2006 that she could lose her Dutch citizenship because of these issues, rendering her ineligible for parliament. At first, Minister [[Rita Verdonk]] said she would not look into the matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nos.nl/nos/artikelen/2006/05/art000001C6765328EBF3B3.html Onderzoek bepleit naar Hirsi Ali], NOS, 13 May&lt;/ref&gt; She later decided to investigate Hirsi Ali's naturalisation process. The investigation found that Hirsi Ali had not legitimately received Dutch citizenship, because she had lied about her name and date of birth. However, later inquiries established that she was entitled to use the name Ali because it was her grandfather's name. Rita Verdonk moved to annul Hirsi Ali's citizenship, an action later overridden at the urging of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;The controversy over Hirsi Ali's citizenship followed a debate over the deportation of a Bosnian teenager [[Taida Pasić]], who had lied on her visa application in order to return to the Netherlands to complete high school. According to her memoir, Hirsi Ali claims to have spoken up for Pasic in a private conversation with Verdonk and to have told the minister at the time that she had also lied in her own application. Verdonk denies this version of the conversation.{{cite book| last = Hirsi Ali| first = Ayaan| title = Infidel| year = 2007| publisher = Free Press| isbn = 978-0-7432-8968-9| page = 343}} [[Infidel (book)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 May 2006, after the broadcast of the ''Zembla'' documentary, news stories appeared saying that Hirsi Ali was likely to move to the United States that September. She was reported to be planning to write a book entitled ''Shortcut to Enlightenment'' and to work for the American Enterprise Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=19&amp;story_id=30003&amp;name=Hirsi+Ali+to+leave+Netherlands+for+job+with+US+think+tank+ "Hirsi Ali to leave Netherlands for job with US think tank"], ''Expatica'', 15 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 May Hirsi Ali resigned from Parliament after admitting that she had lied on her asylum application. In a press conference she said that the facts had been publicly known since 2002, when they had been reported in the media and in one of her publications. She also restated her claim of seeking asylum to prevent a forced marriage, stating: "How often do people who are seeking refuge provide different names? The penalty of stripping me of my Dutch citizenship is disproportional." Her stated reason for resigning immediately was the increasing media attention. Owing to the fact that a Dutch court had ruled in April 2006 that she had to leave her house by August 2006, she decided to relocate to the United States in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nu.nl/algemeen/733549/hirsi-ali-licht-vertrek-toe-video.html|title=Hirsi Ali licht vertrek toe (video) - NU - Het laatste nieuws het eerst op NU.nl|website=nu.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a long and emotional debate in the Dutch Parliament, all major parties supported a [[motion (democracy)|motion]] requesting the Minister to explore the possibility of special circumstances in Hirsi Ali's case. Although Verdonk remained convinced that the applicable law did not leave her room to consider such circumstances, she decided to accept the motion. During the debate, she said that Hirsi Ali still had Dutch citizenship during the period of reexamination. Apparently the "decision" she had announced had represented the current position of the Dutch government. Hirsi Ali at that point had six weeks to react to the report before any final decision about her citizenship was taken. Verdonk was strongly criticised for her actions in such a sensitive case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/18/AR2006051800202.html |title=Rita Verdonk Dented by Hirsi Ali Affair |first=Toby |last=Sterling |date=18 May 2006 |accessdate=6 May 2010 |work=Washington Post |agency=The Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her Dutch passport, Hirsi Ali retained a Dutch [[residency permit]] based on being a political refugee. According to the Minister, this permit could not be taken away from her since it had been granted more than 12 years before.

Reacting to news of Hirsi Ali's planned relocation to the US, former VVD leader [[Hans Wiegel]] stated that her departure "would not be a loss to the VVD and not be a loss to the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsevier.nl/nieuws/politiek/nieuwsbericht/asp/artnr/98711/index.html Moslims blij met vertrek Ayaan Hirsi Ali], Elsevier, 15 May&lt;/ref&gt; He said that Hirsi Ali was a brave woman, but that her opinions were polarizing. Former parliamentary leader of the VVD, [[Jozias van Aartsen]], said that it is "painful for Dutch society and politics that she is leaving the House of Representatives".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/42398021/Van_Aartsen:_Vertrek_pijnlijk_voor_Nederland.html Van Aartsen: Vertrek pijnlijk voor Nederland], ''Telegraaf''&lt;/ref&gt; Another VVD MP, [[Bibi de Vries]], said that if something were to happen to Hirsi Ali, some people in her party would have "blood on their hands." [[United States Deputy Secretary of State]] [[Robert Zoellick]] said in May 2006, "we recognise that she is a very courageous and impressive woman and she is welcome in the US."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=19&amp;story_id=30119&amp;name=America+to+welcome+Hirsi+Ali+with+open+arms America to welcome Hirsi Ali with open arms], ''Expatica'', 18 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 May 2006, Ayaan Hirsi made available to ''[[The New York Times]]'' some letters she believed would provide insight into her 1992 asylum application.&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0B16F63B5A0C778EDDAC0894DE404482&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fR%2fReligion%20and%20Belief Somali in The Hague Faces a More Personal Attack], ''The New York Times'', 23 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nu.nl/news/740969/11/rss/Brieven_bevestigen_risico%27s_Hirsi_Ali.html Brieven bevestigen risico's Hirsi Ali], nu.nl, 30 May&lt;/ref&gt; In one letter her sister Haweya warned her that the entire extended family was searching for her (after she had fled to the Netherlands), and in another letter her father denounced her. [[Christopher DeMuth]], president of the [[American Enterprise Institute]] (AEI), said that the asylum controversy would not affect the appointment. He stated that he was still looking forward to "welcoming her to AEI, and to America."

On 27 June 2006, the Dutch government announced that Hirsi Ali would keep her Dutch citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justitie.nl/actueel/nieuwsberichten/archief-2006/60627Brief-Hirsi-Ali.aspx?cp=34&amp;cs=2017 Brief minister Verdonk over naturalisatie mevrouw Ayaan Hirsi Ali], [[Rita Verdonk]], 27 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day a letter was disclosed in which Hirsi Ali expressed regret for misinforming Minister Verdonk. Hirsi Ali was allowed to retain her name. Dutch immigration rules allowed asylum seekers to use grandparents' names. Her grandfather had used the last name Ali until his thirties and then switched to Magan, which was her father's and family's surname. This grandfather's birth year of 1845 had complicated the investigation. (Hirsi Ali's father [[Hirsi Magan Isse]] was the youngest of his many children and born when her grandfather was close to 90).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hirsi Ali |first=Ayaan |title=Infidel |year=2007|publisher=Free Press |isbn=978-0-7432-8968-9 |page=15 }} [[Infidel: My Life]]&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same day Hirsi Ali, through her lawyer and in television interviews, stated that she had signed the resignation letter, drafted by the Justice Department, under duress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?lp=nl_en&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nos.nl%2Fnosjournaal%2Fartikelen%2F2006%2F6%2F28%2F280606_hirsi_ali_verklaring.html|title=a translation of the letter|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828204544/http://www.nos.nl/nosjournaal/artikelen/2006/6/28/280606_hirsi_ali_verklaring.html|archivedate=28 August 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She felt it was forced in order for her to keep her passport, but she had not wanted to complicate her pending visa application for the U.S. {{As of|2006}} she still carried her Dutch passport.

In a special parliamentary session on 28 June 2006, questions were raised about these issues. The ensuing political upheaval on 29 June ultimately led to the fall of the [[Second Balkenende cabinet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/06/29/netherlands/index.html |work=CNN |accessdate=6 May 2010 |title=Dutch prime minister to step down |date=30 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in the U.S.==
[[File:Ayaan Hirsi Ali 2006.jpg|thumb|Ayaan with businessman [[Steve Jurvetson]]]]
In 2006 Hirsi Ali took a position at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] in Washington, D.C.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/scholar/117 |title=AEI – Scholars &amp; Fellows |accessdate=9 July 2009 |publisher=American Enterprise Institute for Policy Research |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709064611/http://www.aei.org/scholar/117 |archivedate=9 July 2009 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the Dutch government continued to provide security for her, this required an increase in their effort and costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?subchannel_id=19&amp;story_id=38109|title=Hirsi Ali under threat in US|accessdate=27 March 2007|work=Expatica''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her high public profile and outspokenness continued to attract controversy. On 17 April 2007, the local Muslim community in [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]] protested Hirsi Ali's planned lecture at the local campus of the [[University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown|University of Pittsburgh]]. [[Pittsburgh]] [[imam]] Fouad El Bayly was reported as saying that the activist deserved the [[capital punishment|death sentence]] but should be tried and judged in an Islamic country.&lt;ref name="print_50397"&gt;[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]: [http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/regional/s_503977.html#axzz3VzxSRsUd "Furor over author Ayaan Hirsi Ali's visit stirs debate on religious freedom"], ''Pittsburgh Tribune,'' 22 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 2007, Hirsi Ali received her [[United States Permanent Resident Card]] (green card).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/files/pressrelease/HirsiAliRlease25Sep07.pdf|title=Noted Author Ayaan Hirsi Ali Receives Her Green Card|accessdate=2 October 2007|publisher=[[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]]|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007 she returned to the Netherlands, continuing her work for AEI from a secret address in the Netherlands. The [[Ministry of Justice (Netherlands)|Dutch minister of Justice]] [[Ernst Hirsch Ballin|Hirsch Ballin]] had informed her of his ruling that, as of 1 October 2007, the Dutch government would no longer pay for her security abroad. That year she declined an offer to live in Denmark, saying she intended to return to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/10/16/africa/dutch.php|title=Ayaan Hirsi Ali declines Denmark offer|accessdate=31 January 2008|work=International Herald Tribune| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080208073023/http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/10/16/africa/dutch.php| archivedate= 8 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
====Brandeis University====
In early 2014 [[Brandeis University]] in [[Massachusetts]] announced that Ali would be given an honorary degree at the graduation commencement ceremony. In early April, the university rescinded its offer following a review of her statements that was carried out in response to protests by the [[Council on American–Islamic Relations]] (CAIR) and lobbying by [[Joseph E. B. Lumbard]], Head of the Islamic Studies Department, other faculty members and several student groups that accused Hirsi Ali of "[[hate speech]]". University president [[Frederick M. Lawrence]] said that "certain of her past statements" were inconsistent with the university's "core values" because they were "Islamophobic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement from Brandeis University|url=http://www.brandeis.edu/now/2014/april/commencementupdate.html|publisher=Brandeis University|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others expressed opinions both for and against this decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/04/09/brandeis-university-withdraws-planned-honorary-degree-for-islam-critic-ayaan/|title=Brandeis University withdraws planned honorary degree for Islam critic Ayaan Hirsi Ali|work=Fox News|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university said she was welcome to come to the campus for a dialogue in the future.

The university's withdrawal of its invitation generated controversy and condemnation among some.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2014/04/10/ayaan-hirsi-ali-victim-honor-killing-brandeis-style/|title=Ayaan Hirsi Ali: Victim of an honor killing, Brandeis-style|author=Zev Chafets|work=Fox News|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/national_world&amp;id=9500285|title=abc7chicago.com |work=ABC7 WLS Chicago|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/11/opinion/stanley-brandeis-invite-islam/|title=Opinion: Brandeis' mistake on critic of Islam |author=Timothy Stanley|date=11 April 2014|work=CNN|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, ''The Economist'' noted at the time that Hirsi Ali's "Wholesale condemnations of existing religions just aren't done in American politics." It said that "The explicit consensus in America is ecumenical and strongly pro-religious ..."&lt;ref name="intol"&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2014/04/ayaan-hirsi-ali# "Enlightened intolerance"], ''The Economist'', 16 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The university was distinguishing between an open intellectual exchange, which could occur if Hirsi Ali came to campus for a dialogue, and appearing to celebrate her with an honorary degree.&lt;ref name="intol"/&gt;

A Brandeis spokesperson said that Ali had not been invited to speak at commencement but simply to be among honorary awardees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebrandeishoot.com/articles/14184 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414025237/http://thebrandeishoot.com/articles/14184 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 April 2014 |title=The Brandeis Hoot » Students' outcry prompts Brandeis to reconsider award |publisher= |accessdate=22 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed to have been invited to speak and expressed shock at Brandeis' action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/the-kelly-file/transcript/2014/04/10/exclusive-ayaan-hirsi-ali-withdrawal-honorary-degree |title=Exclusive: Ayaan Hirsi Ali on withdrawal of honorary degree |accessdate=2014-06-17 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Qd8wFQqB?url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/the-kelly-file/transcript/2014/04/10/exclusive-ayaan-hirsi-ali-withdrawal-honorary-degree |archive-date=26 June 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hirsi Ali said CAIR's letter misrepresented her and her work, but that it has long been available on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/ayaan-hirsi-ali-speaks_786719.html Ayaan Hirsi Ali Speaks, blog], ''Weekly Standard''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/08/cair-to-brandeisuniv-idUSnPn5nmHrl+84+PRN20140408 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714192852/http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/08/cair-to-brandeisuniv-idUSnPn5nmHrl+84+PRN20140408 |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}, ''Reuters'', 8 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; She said that the "spirit of free expression" has been betrayed and stifled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/56111/ayaan-hirsi-ali-they-simply-wanted-me-to-be-silenced/ Ayaan Hirsi Ali, "They simply wanted me to be silenced"], ''Time'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Bernstein (law professor)|David Bernstein]], a law professor at George Mason University, criticised the Brandeis decision as an attack on academic values of freedom of inquiry and intellectual independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein |first=David |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/04/10/more-on-the-brandeis-hirsi-ali-controversy/ |title=More on the Brandeis-Hirsi Ali controversy |publisher=Washington Post |date=2014-04-10 |accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the commenters, [[Jeffrey Herf]], a Brandeis alumnus and historian, published an open letter criticizing Lawrence's decision, saying it had "done deep and long-lasting damage to a university."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/2014/jeffrey-herf/brandeis-universitys-disgraceful-act/|title=Brandeis University's Disgraceful Act|work=Frontpage Mag|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence J. Haas, the former communications director and press secretary for [[Vice President]] [[Al Gore]], published an open letter saying that Lawrence "succumbed to political correctness and interest group pressure in deciding that Islam is beyond the pale of legitimate inquiry ... that such a decision is particularly appalling for a university president, for a campus is precisely the place to encourage free discussion even on controversial matters."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com/open-letter-brandeis-university-president-after-school-rescinded-its-invitation-ayaan-1573242], ''IB Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Designation by Southern Poverty Law Center====
In October 2016, the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] accused Ayaan, and the liberal Muslim reformer [[Maajid Nawaz]], of being "anti-Muslim extremists", which caused protests in several prominent newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Branding Moderates as 'Anti-Muslim'|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/branding-moderates-as-anti-muslim-1477866475|accessdate=31 October 2016|work=Wall Street Journal|date=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Graham|first1=David A.|title=How Did Maajid Nawaz End Up on a List of 'Anti-Muslim Extremists'?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/10/maajid-nawaz-splc-anti-muslim-extremist/505685/|accessdate=31 October 2016|work=The Atlantic|date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Nick|title=The white left has issued its first fatwa|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/10/white-left-issued-first-fatwa/|accessdate=31 October 2016|work=The Spectator|date=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lantos Foundation for Human Rights &amp; Justice]] wrote a public letter to the SPLC asking them to retract the listings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lantos Foundation Calls Out Southern Poverty Law Center|url=http://www.lantosfoundation.org/news/2016/11/8/lantos-foundation-calls-out-southern-poverty-law-center|accessdate=10 November 2016|work=Lantos Foundation|date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australia tour====
In April 2017 she cancelled a planned tour of Australia. This followed the Facebook release of a video by six Australian Muslim women who accused her of being a "star of the global Islamophobia industry" and of profiting from "an industry that exists to dehumanize Muslim women" but did not call for her to cancel her trip.  Ali responded that the women in question were "carrying water" for the causes of radical Islamists and stated that "Islamophobia" is a manufactured word. She explained that the cancellation was due to security concerns and organisational problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/hirsi-ali-hits-back-at-australian-critics/news-story/62535c0570a76133f3343578d6e07cb3], ''News.com.au''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/04/ayaan-hirsi-ali-says-australian-opponents-carrying-water-for-radical-islamists], ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-03/ayaan-hirsi-ali-cancels-speaking-tour-amid-security-concerns/8411408], ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2017/04/04/hirsi-ali-hits-back-australian-critics], SBS TV&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.city-journal.org/html/upside-down-down-under-15115.html], ''City Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and political views==
Hirsi Ali joined the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|VVD]] political party in 2002; it combines "classically liberal" views on the economy, foreign policy, crime and immigration with a liberal social stance on abortion and homosexuality. She says that she admires [[Frits Bolkestein]], a former [[European Commission|Euro-commissioner]] and ideological leader of the party.&lt;ref name=nyt050403&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/03/magazine/daughter-of-the-enlightenment.html|title=Daughter of the Enlightenment|work=The New York Times|date=3 April 2005|author=Christopher Caldwell|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirsi Ali is the founder and president of the AHA Foundation, a non-profit humanitarian organisation to protect women and girls in the U.S. against political Islam and harmful tribal customs that violate U.S. law and international conventions. Through the AHA Foundation, Hirsi Ali campaigns against the denial of education for girls, female genital mutilation, forced marriage, honour violence and killings, and suppression of information about the crimes through the misuse and misinterpretation of rights to freedom of religion and free speech in the U.S. and the West.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

===Islam===
Hirsi Ali has criticised the treatment of [[Women and Islam|women in Islamic societies]] and the punishments demanded by conservative [[Islamic scholars]] for homosexuality and [[adultery]]. She publicly identified as Muslim until 28 May 2002, when she acknowledged in her diary that she knew she was not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsevier.nl/nieuws/politiek/dossier/asp/portal/0/sctr/0/dossier/290/hoofdstuk/2/sortering/False/artikel/12785/bt//index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619062015/http://www.elsevier.nl/nieuws/politiek/dossier/asp/portal/0/sctr/0/dossier/290/hoofdstuk/2/sortering/False/artikel/12785/bt//index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 June 2006 |title=Dutch article link: 'Ik geloof niet meer' |publisher=Elsevier.nl |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 interview in the London ''[[Evening Standard]]'',&lt;ref name="lawcf.org"/&gt; Hirsi Ali characterised Islam as "the new fascism":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Just like Nazism started with Hitler's vision, the Islamic vision is a caliphate – a society ruled by Sharia law – in which women who have sex before marriage are stoned to death, homosexuals are beaten, and apostates like me are killed. Sharia law is as inimical to liberal democracy as Nazism ... Violence is inherent in Islam – it's a destructive, nihilistic cult of death. It legitimates murder.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 2007 article in ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine, Hirsi Ali said that Islam, the religion, must be defeated and that "we are at war with Islam. And there's no middle ground in wars."&lt;ref name="reason"/&gt; She said, "Islam, period. Once it's defeated, it can mutate into something peaceful. It's very difficult to even talk about peace now. They're not interested in peace ... There comes a moment when you crush your enemy."&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;{{cite web|author=Rogier van Bakel |url=http://reason.com/archives/2007/10/10/the-trouble-is-the-west/2 |title='The Trouble Is the West' – Reason Magazine |publisher=Reason.com |date=November 2007 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reiterated her position that the problem isn't just a few "rotten apples" in the Islamic community but "I'm saying it's the entire basket." She stated that the majority of Muslims aren't "moderates" and they must radically alter their religion.&lt;ref name=nyp220315&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2015/03/22/activist-argues-for-a-complete-reformation-of-islam/|title='In Islam, they are all rotten apples': Activist ex-Muslim|author= Maureen Callahan|date=22 March 2015|newspaper=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Rodenbeck]], writing in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', notes that Ali's view of Islam has shifted and "mellowed," as she no longer completely rejects Islam. She now narrowly criticizes what she calls "Medina Muslims", meaning the fundamentalists who envision a regime based on sharia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/11/09/islam-is-a-religion-of-violence-ayaan-hirsi-ali-debate-islamic-state/|title=Islam Is a Religion of Violence|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who ignore the more inclusive passages of Muhammad's Meccan period, a small minority of Muslims,&lt;ref name=NYRB151205&gt;{{cite news|title=How She Wants to Modify Muslims|author=Max Rodenbeck|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2015/12/03/ayaan-hirsi-ali-wants-modify-muslims/|work=New York Review of Books|date=5 Dec  2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are, nevertheless, quite influential among young Muslims, according to Hirsi Ali: "These men, I find them to be far more influential in inspiring and mobilising young men to see the religion of Islam the way they see it, than the way either Imam Faisal says he sees it, or [[Maajid Nawaz]] says he sees it."&lt;ref name="Question Everything"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoL2H76Hy9U|title=A True Heroine: Ayaan Hirsi Ali Dismantles Islam|first=|last=Question Everything|date=26 January 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayaan Hirsi Ali stated that, in her opinion, "The Christian extremists here, in the United States, who take the Bible and use it to kill people and hurt people, they are the fringe, but unfortunately, what we are seeing in Muslim countries is that the people who feel they should be governed under the [[Sharia]] Law, are not a fringe. (..) Islam can become a religion of peace, if politics is divorced from religion",&lt;ref name="Question Everything"/&gt; and she stated that: "The individual that wants to kill me because I am an apostate of Islam, is inspired to do that from the scripture of Islam, the example of the prophet Mohammed, the clergy that preached to him, and the reward that he will get in the hereafter."&lt;ref name="Question Everything"/&gt;

She described Islamic societies as lagging "in  enlightened  thinking,  tolerance  and  knowledge  of  other  cultures" and  that  their  history  cannot  cite a single person who "made a discovery in science or  technology, or changed the world through artistic achievement".&lt;ref name="Mahmood"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mahmood|first1=Saba|editor1-last=Herzog|editor1-first=H.|editor2-last=Braude|editor2-first=A.|title=Gendering Religion and Politics: Untangling Modernities|date=2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-230-62337-8|page=197|chapter=Feminism, Democracy, and Empire: Islam and the War on Terror}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 interview with The Guardian, she compared the responses of Christians and Muslims to criticism of their respective religions. While Christians would often simply ignore criticism, Muslims would instead take offence, display a [[victim mentality]] and take criticism as insults.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/08/ayaan-hirsi-ali-interview|title=Ayaan Hirsi Ali: 'Why are Muslims so hypersensitive?'|last=Brockes|first=Emma|date=2010-05-07|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She insists that many contemporary Muslims have not yet transitioned to modernity,&lt;ref name="Yaghi" /&gt; and that many Muslim immigrants are culturally unsuited to life in the West and are therefore a burden.&lt;ref name="Grewal" /&gt; Ali calls upon atheist and Christian Euro-Americans to unite against the Muslim extremism in the  West. She  urges the former to educate Muslims and the latter, especially Western Churches, to convert "as many Muslims as possible to Christianity, introducing them to a God who rejects Holy War and who has sent his son to die for all sinners out of love for mankind".&lt;ref name="Yaghi" /&gt; Hirsi Ali stated that: "Islam needs a reformation. Muslim leaders who are serious about achieving true and enduring peace, need to revise the [[Koran]] and the [[Hadith]], so there is a consistency between what the peaceloving Muslims want and what their religion says."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JTCMwdrpt4#t=127.634177|title=Best of Ayaan Hirsi Ali Amazing Arguments And Clever Comebacks Part 1|first=|last=Agatan Foundation|date=4 April 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirsi Ali speaking in April 2015, on an [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] radio program said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's wrong for Western leaders like [former Prime Minister of Australia] Tony Abbott to say the actions of the Islamic State aren't about religion. I want to say to him 'please don't say such things in public because it's just not true.' You're letting down all the individuals who are reformers within Islam who are asking the right questions that will ultimately bring about change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hack/stories/s4225435.htm|title=Ayaan Hirsi Ali: Stop saying IS isn't about religion|author=Lauder, Jo|date=28 April 2015|work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], [[Triple J]]|accessdate=23 May 2015}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Speaking shortly after the [[2015 San Bernardino shooting]], Hirsi Ali commented on the nature of radicalization within communities of Islamic believers saying, "If we talk about the process of what we now call radicalization, that you see a process where individuals are putting on a religious identity. It's all about being a Muslim, you shed the rest of it or you downplay the rest of it and you try to make everyone else as pious as yourself. And this would be, looking back at San Bernardino, the telltale signs. These changes that the family, the friends, the close circle of relatives should have observed."&lt;ref name="conversationswithbillkristol.org"/&gt;

====Muhammad====
{{See also|Criticism of Muhammad}}
Hirsi Ali criticises the central [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] on morality and personality traits (criticisms based on biographical details or depictions by Islamic texts and early followers of Muhammad). In January 2003 she told the Dutch paper ''[[Trouw]]'', "[[Muhammad]] is, seen by our Western standards, a [[pedophilia|pervert]] and a tyrant", as he married, at the age of 53, [[Aisha]], who was six years old and nine at the time the marriage was [[consummated]]. She later said: "Perhaps I should have said 'a pedophile'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4324/Nieuws/article/detail/1731675/2005/03/16/Rechter-waarschuwt-tevreden-Hirsi-Ali.dhtml|title=Rechter waarschuwt tevreden Hirsi Ali|publisher=''Trouw''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims filed a religious discrimination suit against her that year.&lt;!--As covered earlier in this article in the life section--&gt; The civil court in The Hague acquitted Hirsi Ali of any charges, but said that she "could have made a better choice of words".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rechtspraak.nl/ljn.asp?ljn=AT0303 LJN: AT0303], Rechtbank's-Gravenhage, KG 05/123: "Daarmee is zij in het kader van de haar toegestane overdrijving binnen de grenzen van het toelaatbare gebleven. Het is echter de vraag of een veelvuldig gebruik van deze of soortgelijke woorden nog wel zal vallen binnen de grenzen van de proportionaliteit en subsidiariteit. Hoewel gedaagde heeft aangevoerd dat het gebruik van deze termen precies illustreert dat de Koran géén praktische handleiding is voor het dagelijkse leven, wordt geoordeeld dat zij deze zienswijze ook op andere (doeltreffender) wijze en met betere bewoordingen kan illustreren."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genital mutilation===
Hirsi Ali is a prominent opponent of [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM), which she has criticized in many of her writings. When in Dutch parliament, she proposed obligatory annual medical checks for all uncircumcised girls living in the Netherlands who came from countries where FGM is practised. She proposed that if a physician found that a Dutch girl had been mutilated, a report to the police would be required&amp;nbsp;– with protection of the child prevailing over privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}}"VVD: extra inspectie tegen besnijdenis", ''de Volkskrant'' newspaper, 22 January 2004, frontpage&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 she also criticized [[circumcision|male circumcision]], particularly as practiced by Jews and Muslims, which she regarded as being another variant of mutilation practiced without the consent of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtl.nl/(/actueel/rtlnieuws/)/components/actueel/rtlnieuws/2004/10_oktober/03/binnenland/1003_bijsnijdenis_hirshi_ali_2315.xml RTL]"Make circumcision for boys an offense", 4 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminism ===
Hirsi Ali has criticized Western feminists for avoiding the issue of the subjugation of women in the Muslim world and singled out [[Germaine Greer]] for arguing that FGM needs to be considered a "cultural identity" that western women don't understand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the [[#Brandeis University]] controversy, Hirsi Ali noted that  “an authority on ‘Queer/Feminist Narrative Theory’ siding with the openly homophobic Islamists”.&lt;ref name=loath/&gt;

[[Rich Lowry]] writing for [[Politico]] wrote that while Hirsi Ali had many traits which should have made her a "feminist hero" such as: being a refugee from an abusive patriarchy, being an African immigrant who made her way to a Western country and an advocate for women's rights, this does not happen because she is "a dissident of the wrong religion". Feminists instead criticise Hirsi Ali for "strengthening racism" instead of "weakening sexism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/03/ayaan-hirsi-ali-a-hero-for-our-time-116404#.VRsJllz4tFI|title=Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Hero for Our Time|work=POLITICO Magazine|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom of speech===
In a 2006 lecture in Berlin, she defended the right to offend, following the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]] in Denmark. She condemned the journalists of those papers and TV channels that did not show their readers the cartoons as being "mediocre of mind." She also praised publishers all over Europe for showing the cartoons and not being afraid of what she called the "hard-line [[Islamism|Islamist]] movement."&lt;ref name="lecture"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nl/opinie/article215732.ece|title=The Right to Offend|accessdate=1 February 2008|work=NRC Handelsblad|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117212431/http://www.nrc.nl/opinie/article215732.ece|archive-date=17 January 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political opponents===
In 2006 Hirsi Ali as MP supported the move by the Dutch courts to abrogate the party subsidy to a conservative Protestant Christian political party, the [[Political Reformed Party]] (SGP), which did not grant full membership rights to women and withholds passive voting rights from female members. She stated that "any political party discriminating against women or homosexuals should be deprived of funding."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/634 Paul Belien "What Can This 'European of the Year' Teach Us?" ''Brussels Journal,'' 5 January 2006] Retrieved 25 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to denominational or faith schools===
In the Netherlands about half of all education has historically been provided by [[special school (Netherlands)|sponsored religious schools]], most of them Catholic or Protestant. As Muslims began to ask for support for schools, the state provided it and by 2005, there were 41 Islamic schools in the nation. This was based on the idea in the 1960s that Muslims could become one of the "pillars" of Dutch society, as were Protestants, Catholics and secular residents.&lt;ref name="link"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/may/17/religion.immigration Alexander Linklater, "Danger woman"], ''The Guardian,'' 16 May 2005, accessed 1 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Hirsi Ali has opposed state funding of any religious schools, including Islamic ones.

===Development aid===
The Netherlands has always been one of the most prominent countries that support [[development aid|aiding]] [[developing country|developing countries]]. As the spokesperson of the VVD in the parliament on this matter, Hirsi Ali said that the current aid policy had not achieved an increase in prosperity, peace and stability in developing countries: "The VVD believes that Dutch international aid has failed until now, as measured by [the Dutch aid effects on] poverty reduction, famine reduction, life expectancy and the promotion of peace."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wereldomroep.nl/achtergronden/nederland/hulp031119.html Snijden in bilaterale ontwikkelingshulp], Wereldomroep, 19 November 2003: ''"De VVD is van mening dat het Nederlands ontwikkelingsbeleid tot op heden is mislukt, gemeten aan armoedebestrijding, bestrijding van honger, aan levensverwachting en het bevorderen van vrede."''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration===

====Public statements====
In 2003 Hirsi Ali worked together with fellow VVD MP [[Geert Wilders]] for several months. They questioned the government about immigration policy. In reaction to the [[UN Development Programme]] Arab Human Development Report, Hirsi Ali asked questions of [[Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Jaap de Hoop Scheffer]] and the [[Minister without Portfolio]] for Development Cooperation Agnes van Ardenne. &lt;!-- Which question is that, exactly?! --&gt;Together with parliamentarian [[Geert Wilders]] she asked the government to pay attention to the consequences for Dutch policy concerning the limitation of immigration from the Arab world to Europe, and in particular the Netherlands.&lt;!--What exactly does this mean? Did she want to limit immigration or not?--&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Although she publicly supported the policy of VVD minister [[Rita Verdonk]] to limit immigration, privately she was not supportive, as she explained in a June 2006 interview for ''Opzij.''&lt;ref name="opzij"&gt;Het Nieuwe Leven van Ayaan, [http://www.opzij.nl/opzij/show/id=18755 Opzij] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701113955/http://www.opzij.nl/opzij/show/id=18755 |date=1 July 2007 }}, June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This was given after she resigned from Parliament and shortly after she had moved to the United States.&lt;!--What did she think of Verdonk's policy? This seems incomplete.--&gt;

In parliament, Hirsi Ali had supported the way Verdonk handled [[Taida Pasić|the Pasic case]], although privately she felt that Pasic should have been allowed to stay.&lt;ref name="taida"&gt;[http://www.elsevier.nl/nieuws/politiek/nieuwsbericht/asp/artnr/89153/index.html Hirsi Ali stoort zich aan ophef Taïda], Elsevier, 3 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On the night before the debate, she phoned Verdonk to tell her that she had lied when she applied for asylum in the Netherlands, just as Pasic had. She said that Verdonk responded that if she had been minister at that time, she would have had Hirsi Ali deported.&lt;ref name="taida"/&gt;

====Writings====
Hirsi Ali discussed her view on [[Immigration to Europe|immigration in Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;She puts its population at 450 million, which makes it clear she uses ''Europe'' as shorthand for ''[[European Union]]''&lt;/ref&gt; in an OpEd article published in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;"Europe's Immigration Quagmire", [[Los Angeles Times]], 22 October 2006, M.1, also [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1149331111.html?dids=1149331111:1149331111&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+22%2C+2006&amp;author=Ayaan+Hirsi+Ali&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=M.1&amp;desc=The+ostrich+and+the+owl%3A+a+bird%27s-eye+view+of+Europe "The ostrich and the owl"]. There is a revised version available online at [http://www.europeanfreedomalliance.eu/articles/The_Owl_and_the_Ostrich.htm "The Owl and the Ostrich"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. The original was also published in the Canadian "Toronto Star" on 15 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that immigrants are over-represented "in all the wrong statistics", she wrote that the European Union's [[immigration policy]] contributed to the illegal trade in women and arms, and the exploitation of poor migrants by "cruel employers."

She drew attention to the numerous [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]] already in the [[European Union|Union]]. She believed that current immigration policy would lead to [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] and religious division, nation states will lose their [[Monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force|monopoly of force]], Islamic law (sharia) will be introduced at the level of neighborhoods and cities, and exploitation of women and children will become "commonplace". To avoid this situation, she proposes three general principles for a new policy:
* Admission of immigrants on the basis of their contribution to the economy. The current system "is designed to attract the highest number of people with truly heartbreaking stories".
* Diplomatic, economic and military interventions in countries that cause large migrant flows.
* Introduction of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] programs that acknowledge that "the basic tenets of Islam are a major obstacle to [[Social integration|integration]]".

Regarding unemployment, social marginalization and poverty among certain immigrant communities, Hirsi Ali places the burden of responsibility squarely on Islam and migrant culture.&lt;ref name="Grewal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grewal|first1=Kiran|title=RECLAIMING THE VOICE OF THE 'THIRD WORLD WOMAN'|journal=Interventions|date=December 2012|volume=14|issue=4|pages=569–590|doi=10.1080/1369801X.2012.730861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, she opposed the idea of preventing immigrants from traditional Muslim societies from immigrating, claiming that allowing them to immigrate made the U.S. a "highly moral country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126909914|title='Nomad' Ayaan Hirsi Ali On Reclaiming Islam|date=18 May 2010|work=NPR.org|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native Americans===
"When I speak of assimilation",  Ali  clarifies, "I mean assimilation into civilization. Aboriginals, Afghanis, Somalis, Arabs, Native Americans—all these non-Western groups have to make that transition to modernity".&lt;ref name="Yaghi" /&gt;

===Israel and the Palestinians===
Hirsi Ali has expressed support for [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freebeacon.com/national-security/somalian-human-rights-activist-gives-her-take-on-israel-hamas-conflict/|title=Somalian Human Rights Activist Gives Her Take on Israel-Hamas Conflict|date=1 August 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"I visited Israel a few years ago, primarily to understand how it dealt so well with so many immigrants from different origins," Hirsi Ali says. "My main impression was that Israel is a liberal democracy. In the places I visited, including Jerusalem as well as Tel Aviv and its beaches, I saw that men and women are equal. One never knows what happens behind the scenes, but that is how it appears to the visitor. The many women in the army are also very visible.

I understood that a crucial element of success is the unifying factor among immigrants to Israel. Whether one arrives from Ethiopia or Russia, or one's grandparents immigrated from Europe, what binds them is being Jewish. Such a bond is lacking in the Netherlands. Our immigrants' background is diverse and also differs greatly from that of the Netherlands, including religion."}}

As for Israel's problems, Hirsi Ali says, "From my superficial impression, the country also has a problem with fundamentalists. The [[Haredi Judaism|ultra-Orthodox]] will cause a demographic problem because these fanatics have more children than the secular and the regular Orthodox."

On [[Palestinians]]:

{{quote|I have visited the Palestinian quarters in Jerusalem as well. Their side is dilapidated, for which they blame the Israelis. In private, however, I met a young Palestinian who spoke excellent English. There were no cameras and no notebooks. He said the situation was partly their own fault, with much of the money sent from abroad to build Palestine being stolen by corrupt leaders.

When I start to speak in the Netherlands about the corruption of the Palestinian Authority and the role of Arafat in the tragedy of Palestine, I do not get a large audience. Often one is talking to a wall. Many people reply that Israel first has to withdraw from the territories, and then all will be well with Palestine.}}

On the way Israel is perceived in the Netherlands:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The crisis of Dutch socialism can be sized up in its attitudes toward both Islam and Israel. It holds Israel to exceptionally high moral standards. The Israelis, however, will always do well, because they themselves set high standards for their actions. The standards for judging the Palestinians, however, are very low. Most outsiders remain silent on all the problems in their territories. That helps the Palestinians become even more corrupt than they already are. Those who live in the territories are not allowed to say anything about this because they risk being murdered by their own people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Arts-and-Culture/Books/Ayaan-Hirsi-Ali-on-Israel|author=Manfred Gerstenfeld|title=Ayaan Hirsi Ali on Israel|work=Jerusalem Post|date=3 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==
Hirsi Ali has attracted praise and criticism from English-speaking commentators. Literary critic and journalist [[Christopher Hitchens]] regarded her as "the most important public intellectual probably ever to come out of Africa."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zu9PM_ix8cY |title=Christopher Hitchens on The Left's abandonment of Ayaan Hirsi Ali |date=10 May 2016 |accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patt Morrison]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called Hirsi Ali a [[freedom fighter]] for feminism who has "put her life on the line to defend women against radical Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Feminism's Freedom Fighter|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/oct/17/opinion/oe-morrison17|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2 March 2010 | first=Patt | last=Morrison | date=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; American novelist and screenwriter [[Roger L. Simon]] has praised Ali's defense of women's rights, calling her "one of the great positive figures of our time, a modern [[Joan of Arc]] who surpasses the original Joan in a moral sense and is at least her equal in pure guts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Praise of Hirsi Ali|url=http://pajamasmedia.com/rogerlsimon/2005/08/16/in-praise-of-hirsi-ali/|publisher=[[Pajamas Media]] |date=16 August 2005 |accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tunku Varadarajan]] wrote in 2017 that, with "multiple [[fatwas]] on her head, Hirsi Ali has a greater chance of meeting a violent end than anyone I've met, [[Salman Rushdie]] included."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/ayaan-hirsi-ali-islams-most-eloquent-apostate-1491590469 Interview], Wall Street Journal, 7 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Andrew Anthony of ''[[The Guardian]]'', Ayaan Hirsi Ali is admired by [[Secularism|secularists]] and "loathed not just by Islamic fundamentalists but by many western liberals, who find her rejection of Islam almost as objectionable as her embrace of western liberalism."&lt;ref name=loath&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff writers|title=Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now by Ayaan Hirsi Ali – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/27/heretic-islam-reformation-ayaan-hirsi-ali-highlights-scale-of-the-task|accessdate=8 November 2015|work=The Guardian|date=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Caged Virgin: An Emancipation Proclamation for Women and Islam''===

In his 2006 review of this collection of seventeen essays and articles on Islam by Hirsi Ali, journalist [[Christopher Hitchens]] noted her three themes: "first, her own gradual emancipation from tribalism and superstition; second, her work as a parliamentarian to call attention to the crimes being committed every day by Islamist thugs in mainland Europe; and third, the dismal silence, or worse, from many feminists and multiculturalists about this state of affairs."&lt;ref name="hitchens" /&gt;

He described the activist as a "charismatic figure in Dutch politics" and criticised the Dutch government for how it protected her from Islamic threats after her collaboration with [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] on the short film ''Submission'' and the assassination of the director.&lt;ref name="hitchens"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Caged Virgin: Holland's Shameful treatment of Ayaan Hirsi Ali|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2141276/2006/May/8/Christopher%20Hitchens|publisher=Slate|accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahmood writes that the title of the work is "highly reminiscent of the nineteenth-century literary genre centered on [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] fantasies of the [[harem]]".&lt;ref name="Mahmood" /&gt;

===''Infidel: My Life'' (2007 in English)===
{{main|Infidel: My Life}}
''The Guardian'' summarizes Infidel: "[Hirsi Ali]'s is a story of exile from her clan through war, famine, arranged marriage, religious apostasy and the shocking murder on the streets of Amsterdam of her collaborator, Theo van Gogh. Told with lyricism, wit, huge sorrow and a great heart, this is one of the most amazing adventure narratives of the age of mass migration."&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/13/hirsi-ali-nomad-personal-journey|title=Nomad: A Personal Journey Through the Clash of Civilizations by Ayaan Hirsi Ali – review|author=Alexander Linklater|work=the Guardian|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Grimes wrote in ''The New York Times'': "The circuitous, violence-filled path that led Ms. Hirsi Ali from Somalia to the Netherlands is the subject of "Infidel," her brave, inspiring and beautifully written memoir. Narrated in clear, vigorous prose, it traces the author's geographical journey from Mogadishu to Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia and Kenya, and her desperate flight to the Netherlands to escape an arranged marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/14/books/14grim.html|title=Infidel – Ayaan Hirsi Ali – Books – Review|first=William|last=Grimes|date=14 February 2007|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his critique of the book, [[Christopher Hitchens]] noted that two leading leftist intellectual commentators, [[Timothy Garton Ash]] and [[Ian Buruma]], described Hirsi Ali as an "Enlightenment fundamentalist[s]." Hitchens noted further that, far from being a "fundamentalist," Hirsi escaped from a "society where women are subordinate, censorship is pervasive, and violence is officially preached against unbelievers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2007/03/shes_no_fundamentalist.html|title=She's No Fundamentalist|first=Christopher|last=Hitchens|date=5 March 2007|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Nomad: From Islam to America: A Personal Journey Through the Clash of Civilizations''===
{{main|Nomad: From Islam to America}}
''The Guardian'' observes that Nomad "(describes) a clan system shattering on the shores of modernity". The books expands Hirsi Ali's previous early life descriptions focusing on "the remarkable figure of her grandmother, who gave birth to daughters alone in the desert and cut her own umbilical cord, raged at herself for producing too many girls, rebelled against her husband, arranged for the circumcision of her granddaughters and instilled in them an unforgiving, woman-hating religion." "Hirsi Ali observes that her own nomadic journey has been taken across borders that have been mental as much as geographical. In Nomad she calls her ancestral voices into direct confrontation with her demands for reform of Islamic theology. The result is electrifying."&lt;ref name="theguardian.com" /&gt;

Hirsi Ali calls ''Nomad'' her most provocative book for urging moderate Muslims to become Christians. She later backed off this view. After witnessing the [[Arab Spring]], Hirsi Ali also took back her argument in ''Nomad'' that Islam is beyond reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A fiery dissenter rethinks her views|url=http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/03/25/a-fiery-dissenter-rethinks-her-views/|website=nytlive.nytimes.com|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now''===
{{main|Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now}}

In the book Hirsi Ali quotes statistics such that 75% of Pakistanis favour the death penalty for apostasy and argue that Sharia law is gaining ground in many Muslim-majority nations. Hirsi Ali quotes verses in the Qur'an encouraging followers to use violence and make the argument that as long as the Qur'an is pereceived to be the literal divine words, violent extremists have a justification for their acts.&lt;ref name=loath/&gt;

[[Andrew Anthony]] for the Guardian in 2015 wrote that even her fiercest critics would have problems denying what Hirsi Ali writes about current issues in Islam and since those issues are unpalatable an added difficulty was a cultural practice at the time to "not offend anyone". Anthony concluded that regardless of what critics may think of her solutoin, Hirsi Ali should be commended for her "unblinking determination to address the problem".&lt;ref name="loath" /&gt;

Susan Dominus of ''The New York Times'' wrote: "In "Heretic," Hirsi Ali forgoes autobiography for the most part in favor of an extended argument. But she has trouble making anyone else's religious history&amp;nbsp; – even that of Muhammad himself, whose life story she recounts&amp;nbsp; – as dramatic as she has made her own. And she loses the reader's trust with overblown rhetoric. ... She tries to warn Americans about their naïveté in the face of encroaching Islamic influences, maintaining that officials and journalists, out of cultural sensitivity, sometimes play down the honor killings that occur in the West."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/books/review/ayaan-hirsi-alis-heretic.html|title=Ayaan Hirsi Ali's 'Heretic'|first=Susan|last=Dominus|date=1 April 2015|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Economist]]'' wrote: "Unfortunately, very few Muslims will accept Ms Hirsi Ali's full-blown argument, which insists that Islam must change in at least five important ways. A moderate Muslim might be open to discussion of four of her suggestions if the question were framed sensitively. Muslims, she says, must stop prioritizing the afterlife over this life; they must "shackle sharia" and respect secular law; they must abandon the idea of telling others, including non-Muslims, how to behave, dress or drink; and they must abandon holy war. However, her biggest proposal is a show-stopper: she wants her old co-religionists to "ensure that Muhammad and the Koran are open to interpretation and criticism"."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21648627-controversial-new-book-says-islam-must-change-five-important-areas-thoughts-its|title=Thoughts on its future|work=The Economist|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clifford May of ''[[The Washington Times]]'' wrote: "The West is enmeshed in 'an ideological conflict' that cannot be won 'until the concept of jihad has itself been decommissioned.'" May goes on to suggest that if "American and Western leaders continue to refuse to comprehend who is fighting us and why, the consequences will be dire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/14/clifford-may-ayaan-hirsi-ali-risks-life-with-call-/|title=CLIFFORD MAY: Ayaan Hirsi Ali risks life with call for Islam's reform|first=The Washington Times|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, [[Mehdi Hasan]] wrote an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' arguing that Islam doesn't need a reformation and that she will never win any fans over from Muslims, regardless of whether they're liberal or conservative. Hasan wrote: "She's been popping up in TV studios and on op-ed pages to urge Muslims, both liberal and conservative, to abandon some of their core religious beliefs while uniting behind a Muslim [[Martin Luther|Luther]]. Whether or not mainstream Muslims will respond positively to a call for reform from a woman who has described the Islamic faith as a 'destructive, nihilistic cult of death' that should be 'crushed' and also suggesting that [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] be given the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], is another matter." Hasan also invoked the death toll of the Christian sectarian conflicts of [[Thirty Years' War]] and the [[French Wars of Religion]] to argue that an Islamic reformation would lead to conflicts of a similar scale. Hasan also wrote that Islamic reformation should not be promoted by [[Kafir|non-Muslims]] or [[Apostasy in Islam|ex-Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/17/islam-reformation-extremism-muslim-martin-luther-europe|title=Why Islam doesn't need a reformation|date=17 May 2015|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
{{criticism|date=November 2018}}
Saba Mahmood writes that Hirsi Ali "had no public profile until she decided to capitalize on the [[Islamophobia|anti-Muslim sentiment]] that swept Europe following the events of 9/11".&lt;ref name="Mahmood" /&gt;

Adam Yaghi has questioned her appeal in American society where her "serial autobiographies are treated as honest and reliable testimonies in spite of the troubling inaccuracies, exaggerated descriptions, blunt [[neo-Orientalist]] portrayals, and sweeping generalizations".&lt;ref name="Yaghi" /&gt; Stephen Sheehi writes that in spite of her lack of scholarly credentials and academic qualifications "to speak authoritatively about Islam and the Arab world", Hirsi Ali has been accepted in the West as a scholar, feminist activist, and reformer primarily on the grounds of her "insider claims about Islam".&lt;ref name="Yaghi" /&gt;

Critics have labelled Ali as an "inauthentic ethnic voice",&lt;ref name="Oudenampsen" /&gt; at the service of imperialist feminism.&lt;ref name="Yaghi" /&gt; According to Kiran Grewal, Ali is "a classic enactment of the colonial '[[civilizing mission]]' discourse".&lt;ref name="Yaghi" /&gt; Grewal describes Hirsi Ali's works as using "the language of 'lived experience' to justify an intolerant and exclusionary message".  She notes that Hirsi Ali has generally been ignored or derided by feminists due to her "extremely provocative and often offensive statements regarding Islam and Muslim immigrants in the West". Grewal concludes that "it is not surprising many academics committed to an anti-racist agenda have baulked at engaging with Hirsi Ali".&lt;ref name="Grewal" /&gt;

Yaghi comments that "Ali attributes everything bad to a monolithic Islam, one that transcends geographic and national boundaries ... willfully ignoring her own distinctions between different interpretations of Islam, versions she personally encountered before leaving to the West".&lt;ref name="Yaghi" /&gt; Pearl Abraham makes a similar observation: "[I]n her writings, lectures, and interviews", Ali "reaches for the simple solution and quick answer. Always and everywhere, she insists on depicting Islam and Muslims as the enemy, her tribal culture as backward".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abraham|first1=Pearl|date=Spring 2011|title=The Winged Life of Ayaan Hirsi Ali|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.act2080.0050.220|journal=Michigan Quarterly Review|volume=L|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yaghi" /&gt; Hirsi Ali is also criticized for persistently singling out Islam and Muslims, but never manifestations of [[revivalism|religious revivalism]] present with other religions.&lt;ref name="Yaghi" /&gt;

Despite positioning herself on a mission to fight for her fellow Muslim women, Yaghi states "yet, in her works, she belittles Muslim women and paints them as either perpetrators of oppression or naïve submissive clowns, voiceless and hopeless. These women, Ali insists, will be saved only when they divorce themselves from their native religion and culture and embrace a Western consciousness as she did".&lt;ref name="Yaghi" /&gt;

According to [[Rula Jebreal]], a Palestinian journalist and foreign policy analyst, Ayaan Hirsi Ali's criticism applies mostly to "[[Wahhabism]]", the strain of Islam most familiar to Hirsi Ali, and not to Islam as a whole. Jebreal added that Ali's "outbursts" are originated from her own pains, "physical scars inflicted on her body during childhood," which were justified by a radical version of the religion into which she was born. Jebreal wrote: " To endorse Hirsi Ali so unabashedly is to insult and mock a billion Muslims". "It's time to listen to what is being said by the Muslim voices of peace and tolerance. Ayaan Hirsi Ali is not one of them," she added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/05/04/ayaan_hirsi_ali_is_dangerous_why_we_must_reject_her_hateful_worldview/|title=Ayaan Hirsi Ali is dangerous: Why we must reject her hateful worldview|last1=Jebereal|first1=Rula|website=Salon|accessdate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibrahim Hooper]], a spokesman for the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]], condemned her "one of the worst of the worst of the Islam haters in America, not only in America but worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/09/us/brandeis-cancels-plan-to-give-honorary-degree-to-ayaan-hirsi-ali-a-critic-of-islam.html|title=Brandeis Cancels Plan to Give Honorary Degree to Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Critic of Islam|last1=Perez-Pena|first1=Richard|date=8 April 2014|work=The New York Times|accessdate=8 November 2015|last2=Vega|first2=Tanzina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirsi Ali has continued discussion of these issues in her two autobiographies, published in Dutch in 2006 and in English in 2010. In her first work, she said that in 1992 her father [[arranged marriage|arranged to marry her]] [[cousin marriage|to a distant cousin]]. She says that she objected to this both on general grounds (she has said she dreaded being forced to submit to a stranger, sexually and socially),&lt;ref name="smh.com.au" /&gt; and specifically to this man, whom she described as a "bigot" and an "idiot" in her book.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsi Ali, Ayaan, ''Infidel'', 2007, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

She told her family that she planned to join her husband, who was living in [[Canada]], after obtaining a visa while in Germany. But in her autobiography, she said she spent her time in Germany trying to devise an escape from her unwanted marriage. She decided to visit a relative in the Netherlands, and to seek help after arrival and claim asylum.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsi Ali, Ayaan, ''Infidel'', 2007, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first autobiography, ''[[Infidel: My Life|Infidel]]'' (2006), was published in English in 2007. In a review, American Enterprise Institute fellow [[Joshua Muravchik]] described the book as "simply a great work of literature," and compared her to novelist [[Joseph Conrad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/mesh/2009/07/summer-reading-2009/ |title=Harvard.edu blog |publisher=Blogs.law.harvard.edu |date=18 July 2009 |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her second autobiography, ''[[Nomad: From Islam to America|Nomad]]'' (2010, in English), Hirsi Ali wrote that in early 2006, [[Rita Verdonk]] had personally approached her to ask for her public support in Verdonk's campaign to run for party leader of the VVD. Hirsi Ali wrote that she had personally supported Verdonk's opponent, [[Mark Rutte]], as the better choice. She says that after telling Verdonk of her position, the minister became vindictive. Hirsi Ali wrote that, after the 2006 report of the ''[[Zembla (TV series)|Zembla]]'' TV program, Verdonk campaigned against Ali in retaliation for her earlier lack of support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Hirsi Ali| first = Ayaan| title = Nomad| year = 2010| publisher = Free Press| isbn = 978-1-4391-5731-2| pages = 100–03, 277}} [[Nomad: From Islam to America|Nomad (book)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ayaz Latif Palijo''' ([[Sindhi language|Sindhi]],{{lang-ur|اياز لطیف پلیجو}}) (born 15 November 1968, [[Hyderabad, Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]) is a politician, lawyer, activist, writer and teacher. Palijo is the president of Qomi Awami Tahreek (Peoples Movement) and central convener and founder of the Sindh Progressive Anti-Nationalist Alliance (SPANA). Since 2007, he has represented the left, objecting to the division of the southeastern [[Pakistan]] province of [[Sindh]]. He has often been criticized for his two-faced approach, portraying himself as a Nationalist while supporting MQM under the umbrella of Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) in order to promote his hugely unsuccessful political career. His accomplishments include losing Provincial assembly seat to Jam Khan Shoro of PPP in 2013 General Elections.

{{quote|"Today Sindh is passing famine like situation. Conspiracies are being made for disintegration of Sindh and Pakistan. People are committing suicide and selling their children due man-made price hike, water-shortage, crimes and corruption. We'll let Sindh be divided, How long the rulers embroil the people of Sindh in concocted stories? People are full of hatred and not contributing their part in struggle. Hugely participation of public and political groups irrespective of socio-political and religious affiliations proved that Sindh is divided."}}

=== Kalabagh Dam ===

Palijo is strongly against the construction of [[Kalabagh Dam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Kalabagh Dam is a death warrant for Sindh |last= |first= |date=17 September 2018 |website= tribune.com.pk |publisher=Express Tribune |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |accessdate=22 November 2018 |url= https://tribune.com.pk/story/1805036/1-kalabagh-dam-death-warrant-sindh/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nathaniel B. Halhead of the [[East India Company]] published a Bengali grammar for British officials in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Representing India: literatures, politics, and identities Mukesh Williams, Rohit Wanchoo - 2008 "Nathaniel B. Halhead published the Bengali Grammar in 1776 to aid British officers of the East India Company to converse with the local Bengali population. British orientalist William Carey (1761-1834), who was a professor of Sanskrit ..."&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] of [[Serampore]] translated the Bible into the [[Bengali language]] and published it in 1793 and 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Sisir Kumar Das ''Early Bengali prose, Carey to Vidyāsāgar''  1966 "Nevertheless the translation of the Bible into Bengali was an important event in the history of Bengali prose. Carey's Bible became the parent of a specialised and restricted type of the language which may be called Christian Bengali."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander P. Varghese ''India : History, Religion, Vision And Contribution To The World'' Page 662 2008 "William Carey, a Baptist evangelist who settled down in Serampore, translated the Bible into Bengali and published it in 1793. Later, Carey and his associates translated the Bible into thirty Indian languages."&lt;/ref&gt; The high language Bengali translation in use in Bangladesh is derived from Carey's version, while "common language" versions are newer translations.&lt;ref&gt;In search of Jesus: insider and outsider images - Page 56 Clinton Bennett - 2001 "Similarly, in Bangladesh, the high Bengali translation derived from the efforts of the pioneer Baptist missionary, William Carey, remains for most Bangladeshi Christians the Bible, and more modern, 'common language' translations are looked on with suspicion."&lt;/ref&gt; Fr. Christian Mignon, a Belgian Jesuit, finished a revised version of the Bible in Bengali, named Mangalbarta which has copious footnotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiancatholicmatters.org/fr-mignon-an-unsung-hero-of-the-bengali-bible/|title=Fr.

(Doctoral dissertation, University of Guelph; 489pp.)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Central Solomons languages|Central Solomon language]] spoken by about 9,000 people on the island of [[Vella Lavella]]. It is one of the four non-[[Austronesian languages]] spoken in the [[Solomon Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;A Grammar of Bilua: A Papuan Language of the Solomon Islands, Obata 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of different languages spoken in the Solomon Islands is attributed to the dynamic geographic features of the island and the isolation of its different populations.

"Bilua is sometimes grouped with the other Central Solomons languages and beyond (Wurm 1975b) but closer inspection shows that a genealogical relation is not demonstrable (Dunn and Terrill 2012, Terrill 2011)" (Hammarström, forthcoming).

'''Bulgarian verbs''' are the most complicated part of Bulgarian grammar, especially when compared with other Slavic languages. They are inflected for person, number and sometimes gender. They also have [[lexical aspect]] (perfective and imperfective), [[grammatical voice|voice]], nine [[Grammatical tense|tenses]], three [[Grammatical mood|moods]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;These are the indicative, the imperative and the conditional. Additionally, the inferential is treated as a fourth mood by those linguists who do not include it within the evidential system (e.g. Kutsarov 2007, p. 282-286). And there are a few authors who treat ''da''-forms as constituting a conjunctive mood, but the prevailing opinion is against this view (Kutsarov 2007, p.282, Nitsolova 2008, p. 327)&lt;/ref&gt; four [[evidential]]s and six [[non-finite verb]]al forms. Because the subject of the verb can be inferred from the verb ending, it is often omitted. As there is no infinitive in the contemporary Bulgarian language the basic form of a verb is its present simple tense first person singular form.

==Conjugations==
There are three [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]]s. The conjugation of a verb {{not a typo|is}} determined by the final vowel of the verb in the third person singular present simple tense. Verbs of the first conjugation end in '''e''', of the second in '''и''' and of the third in '''а''' or '''я'''.

==Aspect==
Bulgarian verbs express '''[[lexical aspect]]''' (''вид''). The verbs are either of '''imperfective''' (''глаголи от несвършен вид'') or '''perfective''' (''глаголи от свършен вид'') aspect. The former describe actions in progress (uncompleted actions) and the latter whole completed actions (actions which have a beginning and an end). So in Bulgarian an [[English language|English]] verb is usually translated by two verbs (or sometimes by even three, see [[#Secondary imperfective verbs|below]]). Perfective verbs can be usually formed from imperfective ones by suffixation or prefixation, but when prefixes (or very rarely suffixes) are used the resultant verb often deviates in meaning from the original. There are not any strict rules and irregularities are very common. Nevertheless many verbs can be grouped according to their stem change:

:{| class="wikitable"
!colspan="1"| Perfective
!colspan="1"| Imperfective
!colspan="1"| Perfective
!colspan="1"| Imperfective
!colspan="1"| Perfective
!colspan="1"| Imperfective
|-
| пред'''ложа''' || пред'''лагам''' || от'''говоря''' || от'''говарям''' || '''кажа''' || '''казвам'''
|-
| из'''ложа''' || из'''лагам''' || из'''говоря''' || из'''говарям''' || на'''кажа''' || на'''казвам'''
|-
| с'''ложа''' || с'''лагам''' || пре'''говоря''' || пре'''говарям''' || предс'''кажа''' || предс'''казвам'''
|-
| въз'''ложа''' || въз'''лагам''' || до'''говоря''' || до'''говарям'''  || до'''кажа''' || до'''казвам'''
|-
|}

The verbs from one pair are of different conjugations, for example ''кажа'' is from the first conjugation and ''казвам'' from the third.

In the past imperfect and the present tense perfective verbs cannot stand alone in an [[independent clause]], in these tenses such verbs are used only in [[subordinate clause]]s.

=== Secondary imperfective verbs ===
Very often when a perfective verb is formed from an imperfective one by means of a prefix (or rarely a suffix) this verb can be made again imperfective using a suffix. The resultant verb is called '''secondary imperfective verb''' (''вторичен несвършен глагол''). Here are some examples of such verbs:

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Initial imperfective verb
! Perfective verb
! Secondary imperfective verb
! Meaning
|-
| мета
| '''из'''мета
| измитам
| to sweep
|-
| вадя
| '''из'''вадя
| изваждам
| to take out
|-
| лъжа
| '''из'''лъжа
| излъгвам
| to tell a lie
|-
| мажа
| '''на'''мажа
| намазвам
| to spread, to smear
|-
| уча
| '''на'''уча
| научавам
| to learn
|-
| пиша
| '''на'''пиша
| написвам
| to write
|-
| чета
| '''про'''чета
| прочитам
| to read
|-
| мърдам
| мръдна
| мръдвам
| to move
|-
| топя
| топна
| топвам
| to dip
|}

Verbs from the first type describe uncompleted actions (for example the verb ''мета'' could be roughly translated in English as ''to be sweeping''), verbs from the second describe whole, completed actions. Verbs from the third type are a combination between the first two. Although they are imperfective as the initial ones, they preserve the perfective meaning of the second verbs, they are only grammatically imperfective.

An explanation of the nuances between the three columns follows:
* Initial imperfective – '''мета''' (''meta'') – I'm sweeping (continuing action)
* Perfective – '''ще измета / искам да измета''' – (''shte izmeta / iskam da izmeta'') – I'll sweep up / I want to sweep up  (i.e. I'm announcing that the action will be completed – the perfective form cannot exist in the present indicative as, by definition, it refers to a completed action)
* Secondary imperfective – '''измитам''' – (''izmitam'') – I'm sweeping away ''completely''. (The verbs in this column put the emphasis on the fact that the actions are being carried out in their entirety)

Secondary imperfective verbs are used in cases where it's grammatically incorrect to use perfective verbs (there are tenses, the present tense for example, where perfective verbs cannot stand alone in an independent clause) but one wants to use their meaning, or where the action is complete but repeated over time. See [[#Contrasting imperfective, perfective and secondary imperfective verbs|below]] for examples.

=== Contrasting imperfective, perfective and secondary imperfective verbs ===
;Adverbial participle
* imperfective verb: '''''Четейки''' книгата, срещнах непозната дума'' = "While I was reading the book, I came across an unknown word" (at one single moment of the action I came across an unknown word)
* perfective verb: no adverbial participle
* secondary imperfective verb: '''''Прочитайки''' книгата, научих много нови неща.'' = "By reading the book, I learned a lot of new things" (during the whole action I learned a lot, so after I had read the book I knew a lot of new things)
;[[#Present Tense|Present tense]]
* imperfective verb:
** '''''Чета''' книга'' = "I read a book, I'm reading a book" (uncompleted action)
** ''Когато '''чета''' книга, се удремвам'' = "When I read a book, I become sleepy" (While I'm in the middle of the action; uncompleted action)
** ''Всеки ден '''чета''' книга'' = "I read a book every day" (but this does not necessarily mean that I read a whole book, just a part of it; uncompleted repetitive action)
* perfective verb: ''Когато '''прочета''' книгата, ще ти я върна'' = "When I finish reading the book, I will give it back to you" (when I have read the whole book; completed action)
* secondary imperfective verb: ''Всеки ден '''прочитам''' една книга'' = "I read a whole book every day" (I begin reading and I finish reading a book every day; completed repetitive action)
;[[#Past Imperfect|Past imperfect]]
* imperfective verb:
** '''''Четях''' книга'' = "I was reading a book", "I used to read a book" (but not a whole book; uncompleted action)
** ''Когато '''четях''' книгата, телефонът звънна'' = "When I was reading the book, the phone rang" (uncompleted action)
** ''Всеки ден '''четях''' книга'' = "I used to read a book every day" (but not a whole book, uncompleted repetitive action)
* perfective verb: ''Щом '''прочетях''' нова книга, започвах да се хваля всекиму'' = "Whenever I finished reading a new book, I started boasting about it to everyone" (completed repetitive action, notice that the verb is in a [[dependent clause]])
* secondary imperfective verb: ''Всеки ден '''прочитах''' една книга'' = "I used to read a whole book every day" (I used to begin and finish reading a book every day; completed repetitive action, notice that the verb is in an [[independent clause]])
;[[#Past Aorist|Past aorist]]
* imperfective verb: ''Вчера '''четох''' една книга'' = "Yesterday, I read a book" (but did not necessarily finish it; uncompleted action)
* perfective verb: ''Вчера '''прочетох''' една книга'' = "Yesterday, I finished reading a book" (I read a whole book; completed action)
* secondary imperfective verb: identical with the past imperfect
;[[#Future Tense|Future tense]]
* imperfective verb:
** '''''Ще чета''' книгата'' = "I will read the book" (but not necessarily the whole book), "I will be reading the book" (uncompleted action)
** ''Всеки ден '''ще чета''' книгата'' = "I will read the book every day" (but this does not necessarily mean that I will read the whole book, just a part of it; uncompleted repetitive action)
* perfective verb: '''''Ще прочета''' книгата'' = "I will read the whole book just once" (I will begin and I will finish reading the book only one time; single completed action)
* secondary imperfective verb: '''''Ще прочитам''' книгата всеки ден'' = "I will read the whole book every day" (I will begin and I will finish reading the book every day; completed repetitive action)

== Tenses ==

=== Present Tense (Praesens)===
The present tense is used to:
*describe an action that is happening at the moment of speaking;
*talk about things that are always true;
*talk about habits or things that happen on a regular basis;

Imperfective and perfective verbs are conjugated in the same way.

Verbs form the present tense according to their conjugation. They take the following personal endings:
{|class="wikitable"
!colspan="5" | Personal endings
|-
!rowspan="2" | Person
!colspan="2" | 1st and 2nd

!colspan="2" | 3rd

|}

See [[Bulgarian conjugation|Bulgarian verb paradigm]] for the full conjugation.

==== Discrepancy between spelling and pronunciation ====

Although verbs of the first and second conjugation in first person singular end in -'''а'''/'''я''', and in third person plural in -'''ат'''/'''ят''', when the stress falls on these endings, they are not pronounced '''а'''/'''йа''' and '''ат'''/'''йат''' but '''ъ'''/'''йъ''' and '''ът'''/'''йът''' instead.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book|last1=Murdarov|first1=Vladko|title=Official orthographic dictionary of the Bulgarian language|date=2012|publisher=Prosveta - Sofia|isbn=9789540127019|pages=11-12|editor=Mariya Buneva|language=Bulgarian}} &lt;/ref&gt;

|}
The incorrect pronunciation is considered to be an error.

====Neologisms====
Newly adopted verbs, especially from English, tend to take a '''–ирам''' (''–iram'') ending, in which case they only have one form (the imperfective). Since this is not a native suffix (loaned from German verbal suffix ''-ieren''), recent colloquial formations prefer the native suffixes ''–вам'' (''-vam'') and ''–на''  (''–na'') which do form an imperfective/perfective pair. Examples:
* стартирам (''startiram'' – to start), инициирам (''initsiiram'' – to initiate), нокаутирам (''nokautiram'' – to knock out), and even страницирам (''stranitsiram'' – to paginate, with a native stem and the German suffix);
* кликвам/кликна (''klikvam/klikna'' – to click), даунлоудвам/даунлоудна (''daunloudvam/daunloudna'' – to download), шеървам/шеърна (''shearvam/shearna'' – to fileshare).
These verbs, especially the latter group, are extremely new and have not yet made it into the dictionaries.

=== Past Imperfect (Imperfectum) ===
{{anchor|Past Imperfect}}
Past Imperfect ('''Минало несвършено време''') is used to talk about a temporary situation that existed at or around a particular time in the past. It also expresses past actions that were frequent, repeated, permanent or always true. Its most common use is in story telling to provide a background to other actions which are usually expressed with verbs in the past aorist. In this use it means that the action had begun and was in progress when the other action(s) happened, we do not know whether it stopped or not.

Both imperfective and perfective verbs have past imperfect. They are conjugated in the same way.

Verbs form the past imperfect with the following endings (they are the same for all conjugations):
{|class="wikitable"
!colspan="3" | Personal endings
Past Imperfect
|-
!rowspan="2" | Person
!colspan="2" | Number
|-
! Singular
! Plural
|-
! First
| -х
| -хме
|-
! Second
| -ше
| -хте
|-
! Third
| -ше
| -ха
|}
These endings are added to the past imperfect basis. See [[Bulgarian conjugation|Bulgarian verb paradigm]] for the full conjugation.

=== Past Aorist (Aoristus)===
Past aorist ('''Минало свършено време''') expresses an action that happened at a specific time in the past. Both imperfective and perfective verbs have such tense (there is no difference in their conjugation).

Similarly, as in past imperfect, verbs have past aorist basis to which the following personal endings  are added (they are the same for all conjugations):

{|class="wikitable"
!colspan="3" | Personal endings
Past Aorist
|-
!rowspan="2" | Person
!colspan="2" | Number
|-
! Singular
! Plural
|-

==== Imperfective and perfective verbs ====
Although imperfective and perfective verbs are conjugated in the same way in the past aorist, there is difference in their meaning. Compare the sentences:

{|class="wikitable"
! With an imperfective verb
! Meaning
! With a perfective verb
! Meaning
|-
|Вчера четох една книга||Yesterday, I read a book but I did not finish it||Вчера прочетох една книга||Yesterday, I finished reading a book/I read a whole book.
|}

=== Past Imperfect or Past Aorist ===
Usually the difference between the two tenses is very clear:
*past imperfect is used for habits, things that were always true, actions that happened many times or for background for other actions.
*past aorist is used for single actions that have a beginning and an end.
But imperfective verbs both in past imperfect and past aorist can express actions that have long duration and therefore both tenses can be used to say that one action happened at the same time as another. One should always keep in mind that past aorist means that the action began and stopped, and past imperfect that the action was in progress. Compare the sentences (they all contain the imperfective verb '''играя''' that expresses an action with some duration, but depending on the tense the sentences have different meaning):

{|class="wikitable"
! Sentence
! Meaning
|-
|Докато децата играеха навън, едно от тях си счупи крака.||While the kids were playing outside one of them broke his/her leg. ('''играеха''' is in past imperfect and '''счупи''' is a perfective verb in past aorist. This means that at a single moment of their play the kid broke his/her leg)
|-
|Децата си прекараха чудесно, докато играха навън.||The kids had a great time playing outside. Literal translation: The kids had a great time while they played outside. ('''прекараха''' is a perfective verb in past aorist and '''играха''' is in past aorist. Since '''играха''' is not in past imperfect the sentence means that the kids had a great time during the whole time they played outside, not just at a single moment)
|-
|Децата играха навън, докато не заваля.||The kids played outside until it started raining. (The action ended that's why '''играха''' is in the past aorist, not in the past imperfect)
|-
|Децата играеха навън. Изведнъж заваля, но продължиха да играят.||The kids were playing outside. Suddenly, it started raining but they continued to play. (The action did not end so '''играеха''' cannot be in the past aorist)
|}

=== Present Perfect (Perfectum)===
[[Present perfect]] (in Bulgarian '''минало неопределено време''', past indefinite tense) expresses an action which happened in the past, but the precise moment when it happened is not specified. It is either not known or not important (in contrast with [[#Past Aorist|past aorist]]). What is important is the result of the action. The tense has a lot in common with the English present perfect.

Present perfect is made up of the verb &lt;u&gt;съм&lt;/u&gt;, conjugated in present tense, and the [[#Past active aorist participle|past active aorist participle]] of the main verb. Not only [[Grammatical person|person]] (first, second, third) and [[Grammatical number|number]], but also [[Grammatical gender|gender]] must be taken into account in the process of conjugating. In other words, the corresponding indefinite forms of the participle (masculine, feminine, neuter, singular, plural) are used according to the gender and number of the subject. For the position of the verb &lt;u&gt;съм&lt;/u&gt; see [[Bulgarian grammar#Word order|word order]].

Example (''чета'', to read):

{|class="wikitable"
!colspan="10" |

|-

!colspan="3" | First person

|-
! Plural
|colspan="3" align="center"| чели сме
|colspan="3" align="center"| чели сте
|colspan="3" align="center"| чели са
|}

In contrast with English, in Bulgarian (very rarely) the present perfect can be used even if the moment when the action happened is specified. In such cases the importance of the action or its result is emphasized:
*''Снощи до два часа съм гледал телевизия и тази сутрин съм станал в шест, затова съм изключително изтощен.'' = "Last night, I watched TV until 2 o'clock and this morning, I got up at six, so I'm extremely exhausted."

=== Past Perfect ===
[[Past perfect]] (in Bulgarian '''минало предварително време''', "past preliminary tense") expresses an action that happened before another past action. It is made up of the past tense of &lt;u&gt;съм&lt;/u&gt; and the [[#Past active aorist participle|past active aorist participle]] of the main verb. Again as in [[#Present Perfect|present perfect]] the participle agrees in number and gender with the subject. For the position of the verb &lt;u&gt;съм&lt;/u&gt; see [[Bulgarian grammar#Word order|word order]].

{|class="wikitable"

|-
! Plural
|colspan="3" align="center"| бяхме чели
|colspan="3" align="center"| бяхте чели
|colspan="3" align="center"| бяха чели
|}
Rarely the past perfect can be used for actions that happened at an indefinite time in the past but very long ago, especially in sentences containing the phrase "someone sometimes said":
*''Някой някога беше казал, че любовта ще спаси света.'' = "Someone once said that love will save the world."

=== Future Tense (Futurum primum) ===

The [[future tense]] (in Bulgarian '''бъдеще време''') is formed with the [[Grammatical particle|particle]] &lt;u&gt;ще&lt;/u&gt; (derived from the verb '''ща''', "to want") and the present simple tense (&lt;u&gt;ще&lt;/u&gt; always stands before the present forms). In contrast with the other tenses negation is not expressed with the particle '''не''', but with the construction '''няма да''' + the present tense. Forms with '''не''' are also possible but they are found mainly in the poetry.

Example (''чета'', to read):
{|class="wikitable"

The verb '''съм''' forms the future in two ways. The first one with its present tense, and the second one with its special future form - '''бъда'''.  The latter is more common:

=== Future Perfect (Futurum Secundum exactum)===
[[Future perfect]] (in Bulgarian '''бъдеще предварително време''', future preliminary tense) expresses an action which is to take place in the future before another future action. It is made up of the future tense of the verb &lt;u&gt;съм&lt;/u&gt; (in this tense the form with '''бъда''' is less common than the usual one) and the [[#Past active aorist participle|past active aorist participle]] of the main verb which agrees in number and gender with the subject.

===Past Future Tense===
Past future tense or future in the past (in Bulgarian '''бъдеще време в миналото''', future tense in the past) expresses an action which was to be completed in the past but was future as regards another past action. It is made up of the [[#Past Imperfect|past imperfect]] of the verb '''ща''' "will, want", the particle '''да''' "to" and the [[#Present Tense|present tense]] of the main verb. Negation is expressed with the construction '''нямаше да''' + the present tense, although forms with '''не''' are also possible but found mainly in the poetry.

{|class="wikitable"

The verb '''съм''' forms the future in the past in two ways. The first one with its present tense, and the second one with '''бъда''' (''щях да съм'' and ''щях да бъда'').  The latter is more common.

===Past Future Perfect===
Past future perfect or future perfect in the past (in Bulgarian '''бъдеще предварително време в миналото''', future preliminary tense in the past) expresses a past action which is future with respect to a past action which itself is prior to another past action. It is made up of the [[#Past Imperfect|past imperfect]] of '''ща''' "will, want", the particle '''да''' "to", the present tense of the verb '''съм''' "be" (in other words, the [[#Past Future Tense|past future tense]] of '''съм''', but not the form with '''бъда''') and the [[#Past active aorist participle|past active aorist participle]] of the main verb, which agrees in number and gender with the subject.

== Voice ==
The [[Grammatical voice|voice]] in Bulgarian adjectives is presented not through the auxiliary verb, as it is in English ("I ''have'' eaten" - active; "I ''was'' eaten" - passive), but rather by the ending on the [[past participle]]; the auxiliary remains ''съм'' ("to be"):
* [[Active voice|Active]] - ''ударил съм... - udar'''il''' sum...'' - I have hit...
* [[grammatical voice|Passive]] - ''ударен съм - udar'''en''' sum'' - I have been hit

::''See also [[#Participles|Participles]], below.''

== Mood ==
Modal distinctions in subordinate clauses are expressed not through verb endings, but through the choice of [[complementizer]] -  ''че (che)'' or ''да (da)'' (which might both be translated with the [[relative pronoun]] "that"). The verbs remain unchanged.&lt;ref group=note&gt;In ordinary sentences, the imperfective [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] is most often used for the indicative, and the perfective for the subjunctive, but any combination is possible, with the corresponding change in meaning.
* eg iskam da stanesh (perfective) / iskam da stavash (imperfective) - i want you to get up.
The latter is more insisting, since the imperfective is the more immediate construction.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus:
* [[Indicative mood|Indicative]] - '''че''' -
** e.g. ''знам, че си тук - znam, '''che''' si tuk'' - I know that you are here;
* [[Subjunctive mood|Subjunctive]] - '''да''' -
** e.g. ''настоявам да си тук - nastoyavam '''da''' si tuk'' - I insist that you be here.

The [[Imperative mood|imperative]] has its own conjugation - usually by adding ''-и'' or ''-ай'' (''-i'' or ''-ay'') to the root of the verb:
* e.g. sit - ''сядам → сядай'' (''syadam → syaday'' – [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]]), or ''седна → седни'' (''sedna → sedni'' – [[perfective aspect|perfective]]).

===Conditional mood===
The so-called conditional refers to a possible action, which is usually intentional and under the control of a subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nitsolova|2008|p=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is formed by a special form&lt;ref group=note&gt;Historically, it is the aorist form.&lt;/ref&gt; of the auxiliary 'съм' (to be), and the aorist active participle of the main verb:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nitsolova|2008|p=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidentials==

Bulgarian verbs are inflected not only for [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[Grammatical tense|tense]] and [[Linguistic modality|modality]], but also for [[evidentiality]], that is, the source of the information conveyed by them. There is a four-way distinction between the unmarked (indicative) forms, which imply that the speaker was a witness of the event or knows it as a general fact; the inferential, which signals general non-witness information or one based on inference; the renarrative, which  indicates that the information was reported to the speaker by someone else; and the dubitative, which is used for reported information if the speaker doubts its veracity.{{sfn|Nitsolova|2008|pp=322–323}}{{sfn|Gerdzhikov|2003|pp=5–13}} This can be illustrated with the four possible ways of rendering in Bulgarian the English sentence 'The dog ate the fish' (here {{small|'AORPT'}} denotes the aorist active participle):

'''Indicative''':
:{{fs interlinear|lang=bg
|Ку̀чето изя̀де рѝбата
|kuče-to izjad-e riba-ta
|dog-DEF eat-AOR.3sg fish-DEF
|"I know from my own observation that the dog ate the fish."}}

'''Inferential''':
:{{fs interlinear|lang=bg|abbreviations = AORPT: aorist participle
|Ку̀чето е изя̀ло рѝбата
|kuče-to e izjal-o riba-ta
|dog-DEF be.3sg eat.AORPT-N.SG fish-DEF
|"The dog must have eaten the fish." (The speaker did not witness it, but inferred it, for example, from the fact that the fish was missing and there were a pile of fish bones by the kennel.)}}

'''Renarrative''':
:{{fs interlinear|lang=bg|abbreviations = AORPT: aorist participle
|Ку̀чето изя̀ло рѝбата
|kuče-to izjal-o riba-ta
|dog-DEF eat.AORPT-N.SG fish-DEF
|"I've been told that the dog ate the fish."}}

'''Dubitative''':
:{{fs interlinear|lang=bg|abbreviations = AORPT: aorist participle
|Ку̀чето било̀ изя̀ло рѝбата
|kuče-to bil-o izjal-o riba-ta
|dog-DEF be.AORPT-N.SG eat.AORPT-N.SG fish-DEF
|"I've been told that the dog ate the fish, but I doubt it." (Alternatively, this can be taken to imply that the speaker has heard about it from someone else, who in turn was not a witness of the event). }}

On a theoretical level, there are '''alternatives''' to treating those forms as the four members of a single evidential [[Grammatical category|category]]. I. Kutsarov, for example, posits a separate category, which he terms 'type of utterance' (''вид на изказването''), proper to which is only the distinction  between forms, expressing speaker's own statements (indicative, inferential), and forms  that retell statements of another (renarrative, dubitative).{{sfn|Kutsarov|2007|pp=294–307}} The inferential is then viewed as one of the moods,{{sfn|Kutsarov|2007|pp=282–6}} and the dubitative - as a renarrative inferential, whose dubitative meaning, albeit more frequent, is only secondary.{{sfn|Kutsarov|2007|pp=316–318, 326}} Another view is presented by G. Gerdzhikov - in his treatment there are two distinctive [[Feature (linguistics)|features]] involved - subjectivity and renarrativity. The indicative is unmarked for both, the inferential is marked for subjectivity, the renarrative - for renarrativity, and the dubitative is marked for both subjectivity and renarrativity.{{sfn|Gerdzhikov|2003|pp=24–25}}

===Forms===
An evidential for a given tense is formed by taking the past active participle of the verb (or auxiliary, if there is one) of the corresponding indicative tense, and adding a form of the auxiliary verb ''съм'' (to be). For the inferential and the renarrative it is its present tense form, which, however, is omitted in the 3rd person of the renarrative;{{sfn|Gerdzhikov|2003|pp=40–1}} hence inferential and renarrative forms are generally not distinguished in the 1st and 2nd person.{{sfn|Nitsolova|2008|p=362}} The dubitative is formed from the renarrative by adding the past active participle of the verb ''съм'' (to be).{{sfn|Nitsolova|2008|p=370}} An example paradigm is given in the following table.&lt;ref&gt;It is based on {{Harv|Nitsolova|2008|pp=357–60, 365–69, 372–75}}, and {{Harv|Kutsarov|2007|pp=297–303, 308–321, 388–396}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given for reference are some tenses of the indicative (these are the imperfect, aorist, perfect, future in the past and future perfect in the past). Whenever there are participles involved, they are given in their masculine form, but they have different forms for the three genders in the singular.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Exceptions are the auxiliary ня̀мало in all negative future and future perfect forms, and ня̀мало било̀ in the negative future (perfect) dubitative, which always remain in the neuter singular.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there are also a few '''rare forms''' for some of the future tenses. In some cases, there are less common forms in which the auxiliary ''ще'' remains impersonal instead of being inflected for person and number; thus for the inferential and renarrative future/future in the past rare forms of the type ''ще съм четя̀л'' are possible alongside the more common forms of the type ''щя̀л съм да чета̀'',{{sfn|Kutsarov|2007|pp=300, 312}}{{sfn|Nitsolova|2008|p=368}} for the inferential future perfect in the past - ''ще съм бѝл чѐл'' alongside the usual ''щя̀л съм да съм чѐл'',{{sfn|Kutsarov|2007|p=303}} and for the dubitative future/ future in the past - rare forms of the type ''ще съм бѝл четя̀л'' in addition to the more common forms of the type ''щя̀л съм бѝл да чета̀''.{{sfn|Kutsarov|2007|p=320}} Also, the negative form of the dubitative future perfect/future perfect in the past can be either ''ня̀мало било̀ да съм чѐл'', or ''ня̀мало съм бил да съм чѐл''.{{sfn|Nitsolova|2008|p=275}}

== Participles ==

=== Past active aorist participle ===
Past active aorist [[participle]] ('''минало свършено деятелно причастие''') is used to form the present perfect, in the [[renarrative mood|renarrative]] and [[conditional mood]] and as an adjective. It is formed by adding -'''л''' (this is its [[masculine gender|masculine]] [[indefinite article|indefinite]] form) to the past aorist basis (first person singular past aorist tensе but without the final '''х'''), but additional alterations of the basis are also possible. The [[indefinite article|indefinite]] [[feminine gender|feminine]], [[neuter gender|neuter]] and [[plural]] forms take respectively the endings -'''а''', -'''о''' and -'''и''' after the masculine form. The [[definite article|definite]] forms are formed from the indefinite by adding the [[definite article]]s -'''ят'''/'''я''' for masculine participles, '''та''' for feminine participles, '''то''' for neuter participles and '''те''' for plural participles

The '''Bunjevac dialect''' (''bunjevački govor'' or ''bunjevački jezik''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Vojvodina/17383/Bunjevacki-jezik-u-skolskom-programu&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Shtokavian dialect|Shtokavian]]–[[Western Ikavian]] dialect used by members of the [[Bunjevci]] community. The speakers live in parts of the autonomous province of [[Vojvodina]] in [[Serbia]] as well as in southern parts of [[Hungary]]. The accent is purely [[Ikavian]], with /i/ for the Common Slavic vowel ''[[yat]]''. Its speakers largely use the Latin alphabet, as is illustrated in their locally published newspaper.

==Number of speakers==
In the 2002 census results published by the [[Statistical Office of Serbia]], Bunjevac was not listed among main languages spoken in Serbia, but those that declared that their language is Bunjevac were listed in category "other languages". For example, in the municipality of Subotica, the number of those listed as speaking "other languages" (presumably Bunjevac) was 8,914.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/axd/Zip/VJN3.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

According 2011 census, 6,835 people declared Bunjevac as their native language and it was listed independently.&lt;ref name=census&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Census of Population: Religion, mother toungue and ethnicity |url=http://pod2.stat.gov.rs/ObjavljenePublikacije/Popis2011/Knjiga4_Veroispovest.pdf |publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia |date=2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715000726/http://pod2.stat.gov.rs/ObjavljenePublikacije/Popis2011/Knjiga4_Veroispovest.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
The status of the Bunjevac is vague, and it is considered a dialect of [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] by some linguists. According to the 2002 census in [[Serbia]], some members of the Bunjevac ethnic community declared that their native language to be Serbian or Croatian. This does not mean that they do not use this specific dialect, but merely that they do not consider it sufficiently distinct from the aforementioned [[standard language]]s to register as speakers of a separate language. However, those Bunjevci who declared Bunjevac to be their native language consider it a separate language.

==History==
In the old [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] censuses (for example one from 1910), Bunjevac was declared as a native language of numerous citizens (for example in the city of [[Subotica]] 33,247 people declared Bunjevac as their native language in 1910). During the existence of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], members of the Bunjevac ethnic community mostly declared themselves as speaking [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]].

Today, there is wish among the Bunjevac ethnic community for affirmation of their dialect / language. The ''[[Bunjevačke novine]]'' is a Bunjevac language monthly [[newspaper]] published in [[Subotica]]. The [[Radio Television of Vojvodina]] broadcasts TV programme ("Spektar" TV magazine) in Bunjevac. There are also demands for school classes in Bunjevac.

==Classification==
Attempts have been made to establish links between Burushaski and several different language families, although none has been accepted by a majority of linguists.

Following Berger (1956), the ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage]]'' dictionaries suggested that the word ''*abel'' ‘apple’, the only name for a fruit (tree) reconstructed for [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], may have been borrowed from a language ancestral to Burushaski. ("Apple" and "apple tree" are ''báalt'' in modern Burushaski.)

Other hypotheses posit a genealogical relationship between Burushaski and the [[North Caucasian languages]], [[Kartvelian languages]],&lt;ref&gt;Holst (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yeniseian languages]] and/or [[Indo-European languages]], usually in proposed [[macrofamily|macrofamilies]].
* The proposed "[[Dené–Caucasian languages|Dené–Caucasian]]" macrofamily includes Burushaski as a primary branch alongside North Caucasian and Yeniseian.&lt;ref&gt;John Bengtson, ''Some features of Dene–Caucasian phonology (with special reference to Basque).'' Cahiers de l’Institut de Linguistique de Louvain (CILL) 30.4: 33-54,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Bengtson and V. Blazek, "Lexica Dene–Caucasica". Central Asiatic Journal 39, 1995, 11-50 &amp; 161-164&lt;/ref&gt;
* A proposed macrofamily, known as "[[Karasuk languages|Karasuk]]",&lt;ref&gt;[[George van Driem]] (2001) ''Languages of the Himalayas: An Ethnolinguistic Handbook of the Greater Himalayan Region,'' Brill&lt;/ref&gt; includes Burushaski as part of a branch with North Caucasian,&lt;ref&gt;John Bengtson, ''Ein vergleich von buruschaski und nordkaukasisch,'' Georgica 20, 1997,  88-94 [http://jdbengt.net/biblio.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; with both linked more distantly to Yeniseian.
* Some kind of relationship to the proposed  "[[Indo-Hittite]]" macrofamily has been suggested by [[Eric P. Hamp]].&lt;ref name=hamp2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamp|first=Eric P.|title=The Expansion of the Indo-European Languages: An Indo-Europeanist’s Evolving View|journal=Sino-Platonic Papers|date=August 2013|volume=239|page=8|url=http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp239_indo_european_languages.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There have also been proposals that Burushaski constitutes, or is descended from, a primary branch of Indo-European, albeit one not closely related to its present neighbors in the [[Indo-Iranian languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Casule, Ilija. 2003. Evidence for the Indo-European laryngeals in Burushaski and its genetic affiliation with Indo-European. ''The Journal of Indo-European Studies'' 31:1–2, pp 21–86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Čašule, Ilija. 2012. [http://www.jies.org/DOCS/jies_index/Vol40.html Correlation of the Burushaski Pronominal System with Indo-European and Phonological and Grammatical Evidence for a Genetic Relationship.] ''The Journal of Indo-European Studies'' 40:1–2, pp 59 ''ff'', with review by Hamp, Huld, and Bengtson &amp; Blazek&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Ilija Casule has proposed similarities between Burushaski and the extinct [[Phrygian language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarkriley.com/JIES4012web/059-153Casule.pdf Correlation of the Burushaski pronominal system with Indo-European and phonological and grammatical evidence for a genetic relationship]&lt;/ref&gt;

The linguist Sadaf Munshi stated that Burushaski may have developed alongside the [[Dravidian languages]] before the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Indo-Aryan migration]] to South Asia, mentioning the fact that both possess [[Retroflex consonant|retroflex sounds]].&lt;ref name="Munshi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Munshi|first=Sadaf |title=Jammu and Kashmir Burushashki: Language, Language Contact, and Change|year=2006|publisher=The University of Texas at Austin |language=English|pages=12, 105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(Burushaski was not included in a 2008 attempt by [[Edward Vajda]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/dy2008.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526221250/http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/dy2008.html|date=May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; to revive [[Merritt Ruhlen]]'s proposed "[[Dené–Yeniseian languages|Dené–Yeniseian]] macrofamily",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Merritt Ruhlen|title="The origin of the Na-Dene", ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA''|volume=95|pages=13994–13996|date=November 1998|url=http://www.merrittruhlen.com/files/1998c.pdf|accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which linked Yeniseian and [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene]].)

==Varieties==
Burushaski is spoken  by about 90,000 speakers in Pakistan, and also by a few hundred in India.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; In Pakistan, it is spoken in main valleys: [[Hunza Valley|Hunza]], [[Nagar Valley|Nagar]], and [[Yasin Valley|Yasin]]. The varieties of Hunza and Nagar diverge slightly, but are clearly dialects of a single language. The Yasin variety, also known by the Khowar exonym ''Werchikwar'', is much more divergent. Intelligibility between Hunza-Nagar and Yasin is difficult, and Yasin is sometimes considered a distinct language.&lt;ref&gt;Backstrom &amp; Radloff (1992), Anderson (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Yasin is the least affected by [[language contact|contact with neighboring languages]], though speakers are bilingual in [[Khowar language|Khowar]]. Yasin is spoken by a quarter of Burushaski speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 1997: 1022&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[India]], Jammu &amp; Kashmir Burushaski (JKB) "has developed divergent linguistic features which make it systematically different from the varieties spoken in Pakistan."&lt;ref name="2006Munshi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Munshi|first=Sadaf |title=Jammu and Kashmir Burushashki: Language, Language Contact, and Change|year=2006|publisher=The University of Texas at Austin |language=English|pages=13, 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dialect of Burushashki spoken in India has been influenced by [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], as well as [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Munshi|first=Sadaf |title=Jammu and Kashmir Burushashki: Language, Language Contact, and Change|year=2006|publisher=The University of Texas at Austin |language=English|pages=17–18|quote=Linguistic influence from Urdu on JKB is primarily via second language speakers of Urdu. This is because Urdu is the second language of the people of the state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir. On the other hand, linguistic contact with Kashmiri is mediated through first language or native speakers of Kashmiri. In addition to language contact via spoken interaction, contact with Urdu is also mediated through local media and television. Television is also a source of linguistic influence from Hindi, which is very close to Urdu.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unique to JKB is the features of [[Syncope (phonology)|vowel syncopation]].&lt;ref name="Munshi2006"/&gt; Jammu &amp; Kashmir Burushaski shares more similarities with the dialect spoken in Nagar than with that spoken in Hunza.&lt;ref name="2006Munshi"/&gt;

==Writing system==
{{Arabic-script sidebar|Burushaski}}
Burushaski is a predominantly spoken rather than written language. Occasionally the [[Urdu alphabet]] is used,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2006/06149-bashir-prop.pdf | title=N3117: Proposal to add characters needed for Khowar, Torwali, and Burushaski | first1=Elena | last1=Bashir | first2=Sarmad | last2=Hussain | first3=Deborah | last3=Anderson | publisher=ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2 | date=2006-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but no fixed [[orthography]] exists. Adu Wazir Shafi wrote a book ''Burushaski Razon'' using a [[Latin script]].

[[Tibet]]an sources record a ''Bru-śa'' language of the Gilgit valley, which appears to have been Burushaski, whose script was one of five scripts used to write the extinct [[Zhang-Zhung language]]. Although Burushaski may once have been a significant [[literary language]], no ''Bru-śa'' manuscripts are known to have survived.&lt;ref&gt;[[George van Driem]], ''Languages of the Himalayas,'' Brill 2001:921&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists working on Burushaski use various makeshift transcriptions based on the Latin alphabet, most commonly that by Berger (see below), in their publications.

== Phonology ==
Burushaski primarily has five vowels, /i e a o u/. Various contractions result in long vowels; stressed vowels (marked with acute accents in Berger's transcription) tend to be longer and less "open" than unstressed ones ({{IPA|[i e a o u]}} as opposed to {{IPA|[ɪ ɛ ʌ ɔ ʊ]}}). Long vowels also occur in loans and in a few onomatopoeic words (Grune 1998). All vowels have nasal counterparts in Hunza (in some expressive words) and in Nager (also in proper names and a few other words).

Berger (1998) finds the following consonants to be [[Phoneme|phonemic]], shown below in his transcription and in the [[help:IPA|IPA]]:

==Grammar==
Burushaski is a [[double-marking language]] and word order is generally [[subject–object–verb]].

[[Noun]]s in Burushaski are divided into four [[Grammatical gender|genders]]: human masculine, human feminine, countable objects, and uncountable ones (similar to [[mass noun]]s). The assignment of a noun to a particular gender is largely predictable. Some words can belong both to the countable and to the uncountable class, producing differences in meaning. For example, when countable, ''báalt'' means 'apple' but when uncountable, it means 'apple tree' (Grune 1998).

Noun [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] consists of the noun stem, a [[possession (linguistics)|possessive]] [[prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] (mandatory for some nouns, and thus an example of inherent possession), and [[grammatical number|number]] and [[declension|case]] [[Affix|suffixes]]. Distinctions in number are singular, plural, indefinite, and grouped. Cases include [[Absolutive case|absolutive]], [[Ergative case|ergative]]/[[Oblique case|oblique]], [[Genitive case|genitive]], and several [[Locative case|locatives]]; the latter indicate both location and direction and may be compounded.

Burushaski [[verb]]s have three basic stems: past tense, present tense, and consecutive. The past stem is the citation form and is also used for [[Imperative mood|imperatives]] and [[nominalization]]; the consecutive stem is similar to a past participle and is used for [[grammatical conjunction|coordination]]. [[Agreement (linguistics)|Agreement]] on the verb has both [[Nominative–accusative language|nominative]] and [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergative]] features: transitive verbs and unaccusatives mark both the subject and the object of a clause, while unergatives verbs mark only subject agreement on the verb.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}{{Dubious|date=July 2011}} Altogether, a verb can take up to four prefixes and six suffixes.

== Nouns ==

=== Noun classes ===
In Burushaski, there are four [[noun class]]es, similar to declensional classes in [[Indo-European languages]], but unlike Indo-European, the nominal classes in Burushaski are associated with four grammatical "genders":
* '''m''' = male human beings, gods and spirits
* '''f''' = female human beings and spirits
* '''x''' = animals, [[countable]] nouns
* '''y''' = abstract concepts, fluids, uncountable nouns

Below, the abbreviation "'''h'''" will stand for the combination of the m- and f-classes, while "'''hx'''" will stand for the combination of the m-, f- and x-classes. Nouns in the x-class typically refer to countable, non-human beings or things, for example animals, fruit, stones, eggs, or coins; conversely, nouns in the y-class are as a rule uncountable abstractions or mass nouns, such as rice, fire, water, snow, wool, etc.

However, these rules are not universal – countable objects in the y-class are sometimes encountered, e.g. ''ha'', 'house'. Related words can subtly change their meanings when used in different classes – for example, ''bayú'', when a member of the x-class, means salt in clumps, but when in the y-class, it means powdered salt. Fruit trees are understood collectively and placed in the y-class, but their individual fruits belong to the x-class. Objects made of particular materials can belong to either the x- or the y- class: stone and wood are in the x-class, but metal and leather in the y-class. The [[Article (grammar)|article]], [[adjectives]], [[Numeral (linguistics)|numerals]] and other attributes must be in [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with the noun class of their subject.

=== Pluralisation ===
There are two [[grammatical number|numbers]] in Burushaski: singular and [[plural]]. The singular is unmarked, while the plural is expressed by means of suffix, which vary depending on the class of the noun:
* '''h-class''': possible suffixes -ting, -aro, -daro, -taro, -tsaro
* '''h- and x-class''': possible suffixes -o, -išo, -ko, -iko, -juko; -ono, -u; -i, -ai; -ts, -uts, -muts, -umuts; -nts, -ants, -ints, -iants, -ingants, -ents, -onts
* '''y-class''': possible suffixes -ng, -ang, -ing, -iang; -eng, -ong, -ongo; -ming, -čing, -ičing, -mičing, -ičang (Nagar dialect)

Some nouns admit two or three different prefixes, while others have no distinctive suffix, and occur only in the plural, e.g. ''bras'' 'rice', ''gur'' 'wheat', ''bishké'', 'fur', (cf. [[plurale tantum]]). On the other hand, there are also nouns which have identical forms in the singular and plural, e.g. ''hagúr'' 'horse(s)'. Adjectives have a unique plural suffix, whose form depends on the class of the noun they modify, e.g. ''burúm'' 'white' gives the x-class plural ''burum-išo'' and the y-class plural ''burúm-ing''.

Examples of pluralisation in Burushaski:
* ''wazíir'' (m), pl. ''wazíirishu'' 'vizier, minister'
* ''hir'' (m), pl. ''huri'' 'man' (stress shifts)
* ''gus'' (f), pl. ''gushínga'' 'woman' (stress shifts)
* ''dasín'' (f), pl. ''daseyoo'' 'girl', 'unmarried woman'
* ''huk'' (x), pl. ''huká'' 'dog'
* ''thely'' (x), pl. ''tilí'' 'walnut'
* ''thely'' (y), pl. ''theleng'' 'walnut tree'

=== Declension ===
Burushaski is an [[ergativity|ergative]] language. It has five primary [[case (linguistics)|cases]].

{| class="wikitable"
|- style="background:#c0f0f0;"
!Case
!Suffix
!Function
|-
| [[Absolutive case|Absolutive]] || unmarked || The subject of intransitive verbs and the object of transitive ones.
|-
| [[Ergative case|Ergative]] || ''-e'' || The subject of transitive verbs.
|-
| [[Oblique case|Oblique]] || ''-e''; ''-mo'' (f)|| [[Genitive]]; the basis of secondary case endings
|-
| [[Dative case|Dative]] || ''-ar'', ''-r'' || Dative, [[allative]].
|-
| [[Ablative case|Ablative]] || ''-um'', ''-m'', ''-mo'' || Indicates separation (e.g. 'from where?')
|}

The case suffixes are appended to the plural suffix, e.g. ''Huséiniukutse'', 'the people of Hussein' (ergative plural). The genitive ending is irregular, /mo/, for singular f-class nouns, but /-e/ in all others (identical to the ergative ending). The dative ending, /-ar/, /-r/ is attached to the genitive ending for singular f-class nouns, but to the stem for all others. Examples:
* ''hir-e'' 'the man's', ''gus-mo'' 'the woman's' (gen.)
* ''hir-ar'' 'to the man', ''gus-mu-r'' 'to the woman' (dat.)

The genitive is placed before the thing possessed: ''Hunzue tham'', 'the Emir of Hunza.'

The endings of the secondary cases are formed from a secondary case suffix (or infix) and one of the primary endings /-e/, /-ar/ or /-um/. These endings are directional, /-e/ being locative (answering 'where?'), /-ar/ being terminative (answering 'where to?'), and /-um/ being ablative (answering 'where from?'). The infixes, and their basic meanings, are as follows:

# ''-ts-'' 'at'
# ''-ul-'' 'in'
# ''-aṭ-'' 'on; with'
# ''-al-'' 'near' (only in the Hunza dialect)

From these, the following secondary or compound cases are formed:

{| class="wikitable"
|- style="background:#c0f0f0;"
!Infix
!Locative
!Terminative
!Ablative
|-
| '''-ts-''' || ''-ts-e'' 'at' || ''-ts-ar'' 'to' || ''-ts-um'' 'from'
|-
| '''-ul-''' || ''-ul-e'' 'in' || ''-ul-ar'' 'into' || ''-ul-um'' 'out of'
|-
| '''-aṭ-''' || ''-aṭ-e'' 'on','with' || ''-aṭ-ar'' 'up to' || ''-aṭ-um'' 'down from'
|-
| '''-al-''' || ''-al-e'' 'near' || ''-al-ar'' 'to' || ''-al-um'' 'from'
|}

The regular endings /-ul-e/ and /-ul-ar/ are archaic and are now replaced by /-ul-o/ and /-ar-ulo/ respectively.

=== Pronouns and pronominal prefixes ===
Nouns indicating parts of the body and kinship terms are accompanied by an obligatory pronominal prefix. Thus, one cannot simply say 'mother' or 'arm' in Burushaski, but only 'my arm', 'your mother', 'his father', etc. For example, the root ''mi'' 'mother', is never found in isolation, instead one finds:
* ''i-mi'' 'his mother', ''mu-mi'' 'her mother', "gu-mi" 'your mother'(3f sg.), ''u-mi'' 'their mother' (3h pl.), ''u-mi-tsaro'' 'their mothers'(3h pl.).

The pronominal, or personal, prefixes agree with the person, number and – in the third person, the class of their noun. A summary of the basic forms is given in the following table:

{| class="wikitable"
|- style="background:#c0f0f0;"
!Person/&lt;br&gt;Noun class
!Singular
!Plural
|-
| 1st person || style="text-align:center;"| ''a-'' || style="text-align:center;"| ''mi-'', ''me-''
|-
| 2nd person || style="text-align:center;"| ''gu-'', ''go-'' || style="text-align:center;"| ''ma-''
|-
| 3rd person m || style="text-align:center;"| ''i-'', ''e-'' || style="text-align:center;"| ''u-'', ''o-''
|-
| 3rd person f || style="text-align:center;"| ''mu-'' || style="text-align:center;"| ''u-'', ''o-''
|-
| 3rd person x || style="text-align:center;"| ''i-'', ''y-'' || style="text-align:center;"| ''u-'', ''o-''
|-
| 3rd person y || colspan="2" style="text-align:center;"| ''i-'', ''e-''
|}

Personal pronouns in Burushaski distinguish proximal and distal forms, e.g. ''khin'' 'he, this one here', but ''in'', 'he, that one there'. In the oblique, there are additional abbreviated forms.

== Numerals ==
The Burushaski number system is [[vigesimal]], i.e. based on the number 20. For example, 20 ''altar'', 40 ''alto-altar'' (2 times 20), 60 ''iski-altar'' (3 times 20) etc. The base numerals are:
* 1 ''han'' (or ''hen'', ''hak'')
* 2 ''altó'' (or ''altán'')
* 3 ''isko'' (or ''iskey'')
* 4 ''wálto''
* 5 ''čindó''
* 6 ''mishíndo''
* 7 ''thaló''
* 8 ''altámbo''
* 9 ''hunchó''
* 10 ''tóorumo'' (also ''toorimi'' and ''turma'')
* 100 ''tha''

Examples of compound numerals:

11 ''turma-han'', 12 ''turma-alto'', 13 ''turma-isko'', ... , 19 ''turma-hunti'';
20 ''altar'', 30 ''altar-toorumo'', 40 ''alto-altar'', 50 ''alto-altar-toorumo'', 60 ''iski-altar'' and so on;
21 ''altar-hak'', 22 ''altar-alto'', 23 ''altar-isko'' and so on.

==Verbs==

===Overview===
The verbal morphology of Burushaski is extremely complicated and rich in forms. Many sound changes can take place, including [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], [[deletion (linguistics)|deletion]] and [[Accent (dialect)|accent shift]], which are unique for almost every verb. Here, we can only specify certain basic principles.

The Burushaski [[finite verb]] falls into the following categories:

{| class="wikitable"
|- style="background:#c0f0f0;"
!Category
!Possible forms
|-
| [[Grammatical tense|Tense]]/[[Grammatical aspect|Aspect]] || Present, [[Future tense|Future]], [[Imperfect]], [[Perfect (grammar)|Perfect]], [[Pluperfect]]
|-
| [[Mood (linguistics)|Mood]] || [[Conditional mood|Conditional]], three [[Optative]]s, [[Imperative mood|Imperative]], [[Conative]]
|-
| [[Grammatical number|Number]] || Singular, [[Plural]]
|-
| [[Grammatical person|Person]] || 1st, 2nd and 3rd Person (2nd person only in the imperative).
|-
| [[Noun class]] || the four noun classes m, f, x and y (only in the 3rd person)
|}

For many [[transitive verb]]s, in addition to the subject, the (direct) object is also indicated, also by pronomimal prefixes which vary according to person, number and class. All verbs have negative forms, and many intransitive verbs also have derived transitive forms. The [[infinitive]] forms – which in Burushaski are the absolutives of the past and present, the perfect participle, and two infinitives – admit all the finite variations except tense and mood. Infinitive forms are made together with auxiliary verbs and periphrastic forms.

=== The 11 positions of the finite verb ===
All verb forms can be constructed according to a complex but regular position system. Berger describes a total of 11 possible positions, or slots, although not all of these will be filled in any given verb form. Many positions also have several alternative contents (indicated by A/B/C below). The verb stem is in position 5, preceded by four possible prefixes and followed by seven possible suffixes. The following table gives an overview of the positions and their functions

|-
| 11 || Nominal endings and particles
|}

=== Formation of tenses and moods ===
The formation of the tenses and moods involves the use of several positions, or slots, in complicated ways. The preterite, perfect, pluperfect and conative are formed from the 'simple stem,' whereas the present, imperfect, future and conditional are formed from the 'present stem,' which is itself formed from the simple stem by placing -č- in position 7. The optative and imperative are derived directly from the stem. Altogether, the schema is as follows:

=== Indication of the subject and object ===
The subject and object of the verb are indicated by the use of personal prefixes and suffixes in positions 3, 8 and 10 as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|- style="background:#c0f0f0;"
!Affix
!Position
!Function
|-
| Prefixes || style="text-align:center;"| 3 || direct object of transitive verbs, subject of intransitive ones
|-
| Suffixes || style="text-align:center;"| 8/10 || subject of transitive and intransitive verbs
|}

The personal prefixes are identical to the pronominal prefixes of nouns (mandatory with body parts and kinship terms, as above). A simplified overview of the forms of the affixes is given in the following table:

For example, the construction of the preterite of the transitive verb ''phus'' 'to tie', with prefixes and suffixes separated by hyphens, is as follows :
* ''i-phus-i-m-i'' "he ties him" (filled positions: 3-5-8-9-10)
* ''mu-phus-i-m-i'' "he ties her (f)"
* ''u-phus-i-m-i'' "he ties them (pl. hx)"
* ''mi-phus-i-m-i'' "he ties us"
* ''i-phus-i-m-an'' "we/you/they tie him"
* ''mi-phus-i-m-an'' "you/they tie us"
* ''i-phus-i-m-a'' "I tie it"
* ''gu-phus-i-m-a'' "I tie you"

The personal affixes are also used when the noun occupies the role of the subject or the object, e.g. ''hir i-ír-i-mi'' 'the man died'. With intransitive verbs, the subject function is indicated by both a prefix and a suffix, as in:
* ''gu-ir-č-u-m-a'' "you will die" (future)
* ''i-ghurts-i-m-i'' "he sank" (preterite)

Personal prefixes do not occur in all verbs and all tenses. Some verbs do not admit personal prefixes, others still do so only under certain circumstances. Personal prefixes used with intransitive verbs often express a volitional function, with prefixed forms indicating an action contrary to the intention of the subject. For example:
* ''hurúţ-i-m-i'' "he sat down" (volitional action without prefix)
* ''i-ír-i-m-i'' "he died" (involuntary action with prefix)
* ''ghurts-i-mi'' "he went willingly underwater", "he dove" (without prefix)
* ''i-ghurts-i-m-i'' "he went unwillingly underwater", "he sank" (with prefix)

=== The d- prefix ===
A number of verbs – mostly according to their root form – are found with the d-prefix in position 2, which occurs before a consonant according to [[vowel harmony]]. The precise semantic function of the d-prefix is unclear. With primary transitive verbs the d-prefix, always without personal prefixes, forms regular intransitives. Examples:

A master's thesis research work of a native speaker of Burushaski on Middle Voice Construction in he Hunza Dialect claims that the [dd-] verbal prefix is an overt morphological middle marker for MV constructions, while the [n-] verbal prefix is a morphological marker for passive voice.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc271839/m2/1/high_res_d/thesis.pdf|title=MIDDLE VOICE CONSTRUCTION IN BURUSHASKI: FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A NATIVE SPEAKER OF THE HUNZA DIALECT|last=Karim|first=Piar B.A.|publisher=UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data primarily come from the Hunza dialect of Burushaski, but analogous phenomena can be observed in other dialects. This research is based on a corpus of 120 dd-prefix verbs. This research has showed that position {-2} on the verb template is occupied by voice-marker in Burushaski. The author argues that the middle marker is a semantic category of its own and that it is clearly distinguished from the reflexive marker in this language. The middle marker (MM) means the grammatical device used to "indicate that the two semantic roles of Initiator and Endpoint refer to a single holistic entity" (Kemmer 1993: 47). In the view of that definition, I look at a middle marked verb in Burushaski and illustration follows the example.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Caspar Decurtins''' (23 November 1855 - 30 May 1916) was a politician ([[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland|Catholic-Conservative]]) from the [[Sursilvan dialects (Romansh)|Surselva]] region, up-[[Vorderrhein (river)|river]] to the west of [[Chur]] in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Grisons]].&lt;ref name=CDselonAC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F3565.php|title=Decurtins, Caspar|date=8 May 2009|publisher= Dictionnaire historique de la Suisse, Berne|author=Adolf Collenberg| accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CDlautKF&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/gnd11949339X.html#ndbcontent| title=Decurtins, Kaspar|author= Karl Fry|work=[[Neue Deutsche Biographie]]|volume= 3|date=1957| page= 550| accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Caspar Decurtins was born in [[Trun, Switzerland|Trun]], a small village in the [[Sursilvan dialects (Romansh)|Romansh]] speaking western part of [[Grisons|the canton]].   His father, Laurenz Christian Decurtins, was a physician and one of the local land owners.   His mother, born Margaretha Katharina Latour, also came from a prominent family in the [[Vorderrhein (river)|Vorderrhein (literally: ''"pre-Rhine"'') valley]].   The politician [[:de:Caspar de Latour|Caspar de Latour]] (1827-1861) was a paternal uncle.&lt;ref name=CDRomansh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-lir.ch/index.php?id=693|title=Decurtins, Caspar|author=Adolf Collenberg|publisher=Historischen Lexikon der Schweiz, Bern|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium (secondary school)]] in [[Disentis]] and [[Chur]], before moving to [[German empire|Germany]] in 1875 to conclude his university-level studies.   He studied [[History]], [[Art history]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil Law]]&lt;!--The German article says "[[:de:Staatsrecht]]", which, considering his thesis topic, may or may not be [[:de:Staatsrecht (Schweiz)]]--&gt; at [[Munich University|Munich]] and [[Heidelberg University|Heidelberg]] where after just three (half-year) terms&lt;ref name=CDlautKF/&gt; he received his doctorate in 1876.  His doctoral work concerned the seventeenth century [[Grisons]] [[Landammann]] (''"chief magistrate"'') [[:de:Clau Maissen|Nikolaus Maissen]].&lt;ref name="Göttingen1981"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Leza Uffer|author2=Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen| title=DeCurtins, Caspar|work=Chronikliteratur - Engel und Eremit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RqY8QmdETc4C&amp;pg=PA370|date=1 January 1981|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-084592-1|pages=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He then spent a term at [[Strasbourg University|Strasbourg]].&lt;ref name=CDRomansh/&gt;    In political terms, he had grown up in the liberal enlightenment ambience of his mother's family, the Latours.   He showed early evidence of his own political commitment in 1874, however, when he was expelled from the [[:de:Schweizerischer Zofingerverein|Swiss "Zofinger" students' association]] while still in [[Chur]], after he showed his support for [[Ultramontanism]].   In 1875, he joined an alternative student association, the [[Schweizerischer Studentenverein]].&lt;ref name=CDselonAC/&gt; 

Decurtin returned to [[Grisons]] in 1877 and immediately involved himself in politics.   On 6 May 1877, despite his youth, he was proposed for election by around 1,300 eligible voters and elected to the [[:de:Grosser Rat (Graubünden)|Cantonal parliament (''" Grosse Rat" / "Grand Conseil"'')]], representing the [[Cadi (Swiss region)|Cadi]] electoral district and remaining a member till 1904.&lt;ref name=CDselonAC/&gt;   In the cantonal assembly he took a leadership role within the Catholic-Conservative faction, today seen as the principal forerunner of the [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland|Christian Democratic People's Party]].   Following the [[Swiss federal election, 1881|1881 national election]] he was elected a member of the [[National Council (Switzerland)|lower house]] of the Swiss [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|Federal (i.e. national) parliament]].&lt;ref name=KDsecondoTrecani&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/kaspar-decurtins/|title=Decurtins, Kaspar|publisher=Istituto della Enciclopedia Italiana, Giovanni Treccani S.p.A., Roma|work=Treccani - La Cultura Italiana|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

A principal focus of his contributions was in the area of social reform.&lt;ref name="Göttingen1981"/&gt;   In the national parliament (as in the cantonal one) his was a forceful presence, but he was resolutely non-tribal in his political approach, happy to oppose laissez-faire economic doctrines then in fashion with fellow conservatives, and to work with liberals and socialists in pursuit of social catholic objectives.   "Hunger is neither catholic nor protestant", as he pointed out.&lt;ref name=LaFaimselonCD&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/lesocialismecath00nitt/lesocialismecath00nitt_djvu.txt| title=Decurtins et Le socialisme catholique en Suisse|page=251|publisher=Internet Archive|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;" La faim n'est ni catholique ni protestante. C'est pourquoi quiconque prête son concours à la solution de ces questions, doit être le bienvenu, de quelque confession religieuse qu'il fasse partie, qu'il appartienne à l'école de Bakounine ou de Lassalle, ou bien croie au contraire à l'Evangile du Christ "'Caspar Decurtins addressing the Congrès d'Aarau ca 1888&lt;/ref&gt;   He joined up with [[Georges Favon]], the radical member from [[Geneva]], to draft and argue for a motion supporting an international law for the protection of workers.   His willingness to work with "the left" was believed to be out of keeping with his [[Ultramontanism|catholic ultramontane]] convictions, and attracted lively criticism from within his own party.&lt;ref name=CDselonAC/&gt;

There were socially progressive measures that he backed, designed to protect the most socially disadvantaged members of society.  He supported half-day working on Saturdays and the establishment of Sunday as a day of rest.   On the other hand, he staunchly opposed other "left-wing" goals including railway nationalisation, creation of a Swiss national bank or public subsidy for schools, always fearful of state intervention in school affairs.

Locally, after 1877 he teamed up with [[:de:Placi Condrau|Placi Condrau]] to campaign for the preservation of [[Disentis Abbey]], which had been threatened with closure, as was the fate of many religious houses in Switzerland at this time.&lt;ref name=CDlautKF/&gt;   A cantonal referendum to preserve the foundation having been won, he then back a campaign to fund and implement its restoration.&lt;ref name=CDselonAC/&gt;   He was a major force in the so-called [[:de:Lavina nera|black avalanche (''"Lavina nera"'')]], which was a political backlash against centralising tendencies within and beyond [[Grisons]].  

Decurtins was a leading force in the [[Romansh language|Romansh]] revival.&lt;ref name=CDlautKF/&gt;   He was a co-founder of the "Romania" language association and producer of the "Rätoromanischen Chrestomathie", a 13 volume collection of  [[Romansh language|Romansh]] literature and folk tales.&lt;ref name=3Winde&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.perlentaucher.de/buch/ursula-brunold-bigler-caspar-decurtins/die-drei-winde.html|title=Die drei Winde (review)|publisher=Perlentaucher Medien GmbH, Berlin| accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He was also the driving force in the long running [[:de:Bündner Lehrmittelstreit (1900)|Cantonal Teaching Material Struggle]] which came to a head in 1900.   He had arranged for the young priest, [[:de:Maurus Carnot|Maurus Carnot]], to produce a volume of "Christian soul food" (''"christliche Gesinnungsstoff"'') for the local schools school.   It included a German translation of the story of [[:de:Placidus und Sigisbert von Disentis|Sigisbert of Disentis]], an eighth century hermit credited with having founded what became [[Disentis Abbey]].   The book was introduced to the school replacing a German version of "[[Robinson Crusoe]]" which Decurtins dismissed as "lightweight" (''"zu seicht"'').   Then, in 1899 a version of the Sigisbert story, "Sigisbert en Rezia", was produced in [[Romansh language|Romansh]].  However, Sigisbert came up against the modernising agenda of the education administrators in the cantonal capital, [[Chur]], who had implemented a major school reform in 1890, following the precepts of the influential education reformers [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]] and [[:de:Tuiskon Ziller|Tuiskon Ziller]].   It turned out that the prescriptive cantonal reforms included [[Robinson Crusoe]], internationally admired at the time for his civilising credentials.   Decurtins led support for the Sigisbert text in a sustained campaign that culminated in a mass meeting in the [[Landsgemeinde|public assembly place]] in the main square at [[Ilanz]] (in the local language, "plaz cumin").   2,700 people gathered, including 27 school governors, demanding use of the Sigisbert text and, at the same time, a pay increase for the teachers.  The cantonal government backed down.   Sigisbert was restored to the curriculum and the teachers received a pay increase.&lt;ref&gt;Sabrina Bundi: Wie «Sigisbert en Rezia» den Abenteurer Robinson zu Fall brachte, in: Bündner Tagblatt vom 12. März 2014, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1889 Decurtins worked with his friend [[:de:Georges Python|Georges Python]] over the establishment of a [[University of Fribourg|University at Fribourg]] along the Franco-German language frontier to the west of [[Bern]], described by one source as the university's "spiritual father",&lt;ref name=CDlautKF/&gt; and according to another, personally interviewing and recruiting a number of the university's first professors.&lt;ref name=CDselonAC/&gt;   Although he remained a member of the national parliament till 1904, the tide of election results nationally during the 1890s was moving increasingly against his catholic conservative group, and he himself embarked on a parallel career teaching at the university where he was a professor till 1914.   As a university professor he taught art history and was noted for his dislike of "modernism".&lt;ref name=CDselonAC/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDlautKF/&gt;

'''Dobase''' is an [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] language spoken in the [[Dirashe special woreda]] of the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region]] located in southern [[Ethiopia]]. When Blench (2006) reclassified [[Bussa language|Bussa]] from the Dullay to the [[Konsoid languages|Konsoid]] branch of Cushitic, he left the erstwhile Mashole, Lohu, and Dobase (D'oopace, D'opaasunte) dialects behind as the Dobase language.&lt;ref&gt;Blench, 2006.

'''Entertainment-Education''' is a communication strategy that aims to alleviate a social issue or educate the public through a custom-tailored piece of entertainment. It is defined by a set of techniques and methodologies which all aim to use various levels of mass media to communicate social and behavior change.

In 1950, the UK-based radio soap opera [[The Archers]] broke ground by being specifically designed to educate the British people about farming issues and to help increase productivity in the [[Postwar|postwar era]] of [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing]] and food shortages.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan, Paul (1991), ''The Radio Companion''. London: Grafton; p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the longest-running Soap Opera in the world, and is still broadcast today with millions of listeners.

[[Miguel Sabido]], a Mexican TV producer, further formalized the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.populationmedia.org/product/sabido-history/|title=History of the Sabido Methodology - Population Media Center|website=Population Media Center|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially called it "Entertainment with a proven social benefit" in the 1960s, which [[Everett Rogers]] re-branded as "Entertainment and Education" in 1979, and [[Patrick Coleman]] simplified as "Entertainment-Education", which is the presently used term. 

While the field has evolved in the last 50 years, it is still strongly based on Sabido's specific approach. Nowadays, many practitioners in Entertainment-Education come from a background of [[public health]], [[health communication]] and [[behavior change communication]]. 

Sabido pioneered his method in 1967 by leveraging the Mexican tabloid ''[[Casos de Alarma]]'' to encourage readers to join the social security system of Mexico. The release of the Peruvian telenovela [[Simplemente María (1969 TV series)|''Simplemente María'' (1969)]] validated his assumptions about using mass media for social change, as the sale of sewing machines increased dramatically after the telenovela aired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=A|first=Singhal|last2=EM|first2=Rogers|last3=R|first3=Obregon|date=1994|title=Simplemente Maria and formation of the entertainment-education strategy.|url=https://www.popline.org/node/309874|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabido went on to produce ''[[Ven conmigo (TV series)|Ven conmigo]]'', which was widely successful with a 32 point share and resulted in a million people enrolling in the adult education system of Mexico after the series' 1-year runtime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-09-20/news/mn-8914_1_soap-operas|title=Adult Literacy, Birth Control Addressed in Dramas :  Third World Soaps Tackle Social Problems|last=CRIDER|first=JEFF|date=1987-09-20|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=USS5AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;dq=ven+conmigo+adult+education+mexico&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dcWPFAKIGt&amp;sig=kDB5gPLVIcmBcVZRCaOPhz4dVgA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjuhYmA0MXaAhVEwI8KHQfcDxoQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&amp;q=ven%20conmigo%20adult%20education%20mexico&amp;f=false|title=Created to Learn: A Christian Teacher's Introduction to Educational Psychology, Second Edition|last=Yount|first=William|date=2010-08-15|publisher=B&amp;H Publishing Group|isbn=9781433672811|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sabido-produced, [[family planning]]-themed telenovelas ''[[Acompáñame (TV series)|Acompáñame]]'', ''[[Vamos juntos]]'', ''[[caminemos]]'' and ''[[Nosotros los Mujeres]]'' followed soon after in the 1970s, which collectively resulted in a 34 percent decline of the population growth rate of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.populationmedia.org/product/sabido-history/|title=History of the Sabido Methodology - Population Media Center|website=Population Media Center|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] awarded Mexico with their Population Prize after that run; [[United States Agency for International Development]]'s Thomas Donnelly wrote: "''The Televisa family planning soap operas have made the single most powerful contribution to the Mexican population success story.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.populationinstitute.org/newsroom/press/view/69/|title=The Population Institute|website=www.populationinstitute.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Poindexter]] of [[PCI Media Impact|Population Communications International]] saw great promise in this approach, and introduced him to US-American psychologist [[Albert Bandura]]. Bandura was able to explain some of Sabido's enormous impact through his [[social learning theory]] and later went on to publish many papers on the effects of [[Serial drama|serial (radio and television)]] dramas.

In a series of strategic meetings in the 1970s and 80s, Poindexter invited Sabido to teach his method world-wide in India, China, the Philippines, Egypt, and the Netherlands. Together with [[Sonny Fox]], the president of the [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]], they then organized so-called "Soap Summits" that brought together the CEOs of large American broadcasters, as well as introduce American TV writers to the methods of Entertainment-Education.[[File:SBCC Summit 2018 Crowd in Nusa Dua, Indonesia.jpg|thumb|Over 1,200 attendees came to the 2018 SBCC Summit, where Entertainment-Education was a main topic among [[Social and Behavior Change Communication]] professionals.]]
Since the early days in the 1980s, a number of organizations have flourished, led by Poindexter-heritage non-profits [[PCI Media]] and [[Population Media Center]] on the actively producing side, jointly having made 140 shows that reached more than 2 Billion people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.populationmedia.org/our-approach/impact/|title=PMC Impact - Population Media Center|work=Population Media Center|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mediaimpact.org/who-we-are/|title=Who We Are|date=2012-10-23|work=PCI Media Impact|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had enormous impact on [[prevention of HIV/AIDS]], [[family planning]] and [[women's rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.populationmedia.org/our-approach/impact/|title=PMC Impact - Population Media Center|work=Population Media Center|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mediaimpact.org/what-we-do/|title=What We Do|date=2012-10-23|work=PCI Media Impact|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to systematize health communications in Hollywood content, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] teamed up with [[USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism]], jointly creating [[Hollywood, Health and Society]]. HH&amp;S advises [[Writers Guild of America West]] writers in the inclusion of health-related topics in mainstream television and film.

'''Film-out''' is the process in the [[computer graphics]], [[video production]] and [[filmmaking]] disciplines of transferring images or [[animation]] from [[videotape]] or digital files to a traditional [[film print]]. "Film-out" is a broad term that encompasses the conversion of frame rates, color correction, as well as the actual printing, also called scanning or [[film recorder|recording]].

The film-out process is different depending on the regional standard of the master videotape in question – [[NTSC]], [[PAL]], or [[SECAM]] – or likewise on the several emerging region-independent formats of [[High-definition video|high definition]] video (HD video); thus each type is covered separately, taking into account regional film-out industries, methods and technical considerations.

==Film-out of live action video==
Many modern [[Documentary film|documentaries]] and low-budget films are shot on videotape or other  [[digital video]] media, instead of [[film stock]], and completed as digital video.  [[Video production]] means substantially lower costs than [[16 mm]] or [[35 mm]] film production on all levels. Until recently, the relatively low cost of video ended when the issue of a theatrical presentation was raised, which required a print for [[Movie projector|film projection]]. With the growing presence of digital projection, this is becoming less of a factor.

===Standard definition (SD) video===
Film-out of [[SD video|standard-definition video]] – or any source that has an incompatible frame rate – is the up-conversion of video media to film for theatrical viewing. The video-to-film conversion process consists of two major steps: first, the conversion of video into digital "film frames" which are then stored on a computer or on HD videotape; and secondly, the printing of these digital "film frames" onto actual film. To understand these two steps, it is important to understand how video and film differ.

Film (sound film, at least) has remained unchanged for almost a century and creates the illusion of moving images through the rapid projection of still images, "frames", upon a screen, typically 24 per second. Traditional [[interlaced]] [[SD video]] has no real frame rate, (though the term "frame" is applied to video, it has a different meaning). Instead, video consists of a very fast succession of horizontal lines that continually cascade down the television screen – streaming top to bottom, before jumping back to the top and then streaming down to the bottom again, repeatedly, almost 60 alternating screen-fulls every second for NTSC, or exactly 50 such screen-fulls per second for PAL and SECAM. Since visual movement in video is infused in this continuous cascade of scans lines, there is no discrete image or real "frame" that can be identified at any one time. Therefore, when transferring video to film, it is necessary to "invent" individual film frames, 24 for every second of elapsed time. The bulk of the work done by a film-out company is this first step, creating film frames out of the stream of interlaced video.

Each company employs its own (often proprietary) technology for turning interlaced video into high-resolution digital video files of 24 discrete images every second, called 24 progressive video or 24p. The technology must filter out all the visually unappealing artifacting that results from the inherent mismatch between video and film movement. Moreover, the conversion process usually requires human intervention at every edit point of a video program, so that each type of scene can be calibrated for maximum visual quality. The use of archival footage in video especially calls for extra attention.

Step two, the scanning to film, is the rote part of the process. This is the mechanical step where lasers print each of the newly created frames of the 24p video, stored on computer files or HD videotape, onto rolls of film.

Most companies that do film-out, do all the stages of the process themselves for a lump sum. The job includes converting interlaced video into 24p and often a color correction session – ([[color grading|calibrating the image for theatrical projection]]), before scanning to physical film, (possibly followed by color correction of the film print made from the [[Digital intermediate|digital intermediary]]) – is offered. At the very least, film-out can be understood as the process of converting interlaced video to 24p and then scanning it to film.

====NTSC video====
[[NTSC]] is the most challenging of the formats when it comes to standards conversion and, specifically, converting to film prints.  NTSC runs at the approximate rate of 29.97 video "frames" (consisting of two interlaced screen-fulls of scan lines, called fields, per frame) per second.  In this way, NTSC resolves actual [[live action]] movement at almost – but not quite – 60 alternating half-resolution images every second.  Because of this 29.97 rate, no direct correlation to film frames at 24 [[frame rate|frames per second]] can be achieved.  NTSC is hardest to reconcile with film, thus motivates [[Three-two pull down|its own unique processes]].

====PAL and SECAM video====
[[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] run at 25 interlaced video "frames" per second, which can be slowed down or frame-dropped, then [[deinterlace]]d, to correlate "frame" for frame with film running at 24 actual frames per second.  PAL and SECAM are less complex and demanding than NTSC for film-out.  PAL and SECAM conversions do agitate, though, with the unpleasant choice between slowing down video (and audio pitch, noticeably) by four percent, from 25 to 24 frames per second, in order to maintain a 1:1 frame match, slightly changing the rhythm and feel of the program; or maintaining original speed by periodically dropping frames, thereby creating jerkiness and possible loss of vital detail in fast-moving action or precise edits.

===High definition (HD) digital video===
[[High-definition video|High definition]] digital video can be shot at a variety of frame rates, including 29.97 [[Interlaced video|interlace]]d (like NTSC) or [[progressive video|progressive]]; or 25 interlaced (like PAL) or progressive; or even 24-progressive (just like film). HD, if shot in 24-progressive, scans nearly perfectly to film without the need of a frame or field conversion process. Other issues remain though, based on the different resolutions, [[color space]]s, and compression schemes that exist in the high-definition video world.

==Film-out of computer graphics and animation==

Artists working with CGI-[[Computer-generated imagery]] [[animation]] [[computer]]s create pictures frame by frame. Once the finished product is done, the frames are outputted, normally in a [[DPX]] file. These picture data files can then be put on to [[film]] using a [[film recorder]] for film out. [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] computers started the high-end CGI-[[Computer-generated imagery]] animation stystems, but with faster computers and the growth of [[Linux]]-based systems, many others are on the market now. ''[[Toy Story]]'', and ''[[Tarzan]]'' are two samples of movies which were made in CGI and then film-out. The most CGI work is done in 2K [[Display resolution]] files (about the size of [[QXGA]]), but 4K [[Display resolution]] is on the rise. A 2K movie requires a [[Storage Area Network]] storage several [[terabytes]] in size to be properly stored and played out.

Computer graphics files are handled the same way but in single frames and may use [[DPX]], [[TIFF]] or other [[file format]]s.

==Film-out of digital intermediate==

Film-out-[[film recorder|recording]] is the last step of [[digital intermediate]] work flow. [[DPX]] files that were scanned on a [[motion picture film scanner]] are stored on a [[storage area network]] (often abbreviated as "SAN"). The scanned DPX footage is edited and composited-[[special effect|FX]] on [[workstation]]s, then mastered back on film. [[Film restoration]] is also done this way.

==Film-out of images for the graphic design and print industries==

The days of [[newspapers]] and [[magazines]] shooting [[35mm]] [[film]] are almost gone.  [[Digital camera]]s can now shoot all the images needed, storing them as files (e.g. [[JPG|JPEG]], [[DPX]] or another [[Image file formats|format]]) that are readily [[Editing#Print media|edited]] prior to use.  Once the final [[Copy (written)|copy]] is approved, it can be filmed out for [[publishing]].  Digital stills are not the only way to  get pictures used in the graphic design and print industries.  [[Motion picture film scanner|Film scanners]] and [[computer-generated imagery|computer graphics programs]] are also common sources for graphic design and print industries.

==Types of Film Out Devices==
*[[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] recorder. Camera and a special [[TV]] display
**[[Kinescope]] – early type
*[[Electronic Video Recording]] or EVR – early type
*[[Film recorder#History|EBR]] [[Electron Beam Film Recorder]] 16&amp;nbsp;mm by 3M
* Laser film recorder, like [[Kodak]]'s high-end Lightning II recorder and [[Arri]]'s [[Arrilaser]].
* [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]] Film recorder, like Cinevation's real-time [[Cinevator]].

==History==
Lately it has become possible to transfer video images, including films scanned at high resolution, back to film stocks by making a [[digital intermediate]], which can then be recorded out to fine-grain film intermediate with a laser film printer. The first major live-action film to use this process entirely was ''[[O Brother Where Art Thou]]'', done by Kodak's Cinesite division in Hollywood in the spring of 2000. Prior to this, the video master was transferred from tape to film through one of several methods: CRT recorder, laser film printer, [[Kinescope]], or [[electron beam recorder]] (EBR). Theater performances have been preserved with Kinescope for many years – the 1964 [[New York, New York|New York]] production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' with [[Richard Burton]], for example, was shot on video and printed as a film that was released in [[movie theater]]s using this process. [[Fernando Arrabal]] was the first to use the technique of video-to-film for aesthetic purposes, for the 1971 film ''[[Viva la muerte (film)|Viva la muerte]]'', which used heavily color-adjusted video footage only for the fantasy sequences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arrabal.org/emuert.html arrabal.org's compilation of reviews of the film ''Viva la muerte''].&lt;/ref&gt;  Experimental filmmaker [[Scott Bartlett]] also utilized video footage and effects for portions of his 1972 film ''[[OffOn]]'', by filming such with a 16&amp;nbsp;mm film camera off of a video monitor.

[[Technicolor]] also experimented in the early 1970s with using video gear &amp; videotape to make feature-length motion pictures with, by transferring the videotape to film for final release and distribution.  Films made with this process were the 1973 film ''[[Why (film)|Why]]'', the 1971 film ''The Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler'', and the most famous film using this process, [[Frank Zappa]]'s 1971 film ''[[200 Motels]]'', which was originally shot on [[2 inch Quadruplex videotape]], and then transferred to film by Technicolor, being the first independent film originally to be shot on videotape and distributed theatrically in 35&amp;nbsp;mm.

Also, countless educational, medical, industrial, and promotional videotapes produced from the late 1950s up to the mid-1980s were also transferred to film stock (usually 16&amp;nbsp;mm film) for widespread distribution, using either an EBR or CRT recorder.  This was done due to [[VCR]]s and [[VTR]]s then not being commonplace in most schools, hospitals, boardrooms, and other institutional settings, due to their high cost and the multitudes of proprietary (and incompatible) open-reel, cartridge, &amp; cassette videotape formats in the early years of industrial-market videotape recorders starting in the mid-to-late 1960s.  But 16&amp;nbsp;mm projectors were widely available at the time in such settings, making distribution of such video productions on 16&amp;nbsp;mm film more practical.  One company that specialized in the transfer of videotape-originated programming to 16mm film in the 1970s and 1980s was [[Image Transform]], a company that specialized in and developed its own technologies for video-to-film transfer.  Such transfers were the case until the mid-1980s, when the VCR became affordable enough (and much more standardized in the form of [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]]) to be adopted in such institutional settings on a widespread basis.

[[Digital video]] equipment has made this approach easier; theatrical-release documentaries and features originated on video are now being produced this way. [[High-definition video|High Definition]] video became popular in the early 2000s by pioneering filmmakers like [[George Lucas]] and [[Robert Rodriguez]], who used HD video cameras (such as the [[Sony]] [[HDW-F900]]) to capture images for popular movies like ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]'' and ''Spy Kids 2'', respectively, both released in 2002.

[[Independent film]]makers, especially those participating in the [[Dogme]] movement of filmmaking, have also shot their films on [[MiniDV]] videotape, to be transferred to 35&amp;nbsp;mm film stock for theatrical release.  Some examples of independent movies being shot on videotape are [[Lone Scherfig]]'s ''[[Italian For Beginners]]'' (a Dogme film), [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Full Frontal (film)|Full Frontal]]'' (which was shot on [[PAL]]-standard MiniDV gear in the normally [[NTSC]]-prevalent [[United States|US]], due to its higher resolution of 625 lines and frame rate of 25 frame/s (as opposed to NTSC's 525 line resolution and 30 frame/s frame rate), more closely matching film's 24 frame/s), and [[Mike Figgis]]' ''[[Timecode (film)|Timecode]]''.  Initially due to budgetary concerns, Filmmaker [[Rob Nilsson]] shot his feature drama "Signal 7" in 1984 using Sony portable [[U-matic]] format videocassette decks paired with [[Ikegami Tsushinki|Ikegami]] HL-79 3-tube broadcast video cameras (a setup comparable to [[Electronic News Gathering|ENG]] systems used by broadcast television stations at the time).   The video hardware &amp; taped footage took the place of the traditional cinema camera and it's negatives, which were edited in post-production and transferred to 35mm film for theatrical release &amp; exhibition.  Nilsson liked the visual look of video-to-film transfer, and shot several other of his films the same way.

[[Arrilaser]] [[film recorder]]s are also used for film-out.

'''Finland Swedish''' or '''Fenno-Swedish'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first= | last= | title=Professor Catherine O. Ringen |work=The University of Iowa | date=May 11, 2011  | url=http://clas.uiowa.edu/linguistics/people/catherine-o-ringen | accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-sv|finlandssvenska}}, {{lang-fi|suomenruotsi}}) is a general term for the variety of [[Standard Swedish]] and a closely related group of [[dialect]]s of [[Swedish language|Swedish]] spoken in [[Finland]] by the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Swedish-speaking population]] as their [[first language]]. For the most part, these dialects and the dialects spoken in Sweden are mutually intelligible, although some archaic [[Swedish dialects in Ostrobothnia]] are practically unintelligible to Swedish-speaking people in southern Finland (and in Sweden). Most Swedish-speaking Finns emphasize that Finland Swedish is not a language separate from the Swedish of Sweden. The Swedish dialects in Finland are considered [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of Swedish, and the norm for written [[Standard Swedish]] is completely applicable also for Finland Swedish. Today, Swedish dialects are spoken in four different regions in Finland: Ostrobothnia, Åland Islands, Southwest Finland and Uusimaa.

Swedish as spoken in Finland is regulated by the Swedish Department of the [[Institute for the Languages of Finland]]. This regulation includes the officially stated aim of keeping Finland Swedish close to the Swedish as spoken in Sweden and strongly phrased advice against [[loanword]]s and [[calque]]s from [[Finnish language|Finnish]], which are usually incomprehensible to Swedes.

An often repeated "fact" is that the municipality with the highest proportion of Swedish speakers in the world, [[Larsmo]] (93% {{As of|2017|lc=on}}), is located in Finland. [[Korsnäs]] has also held this title and is often cited as such. However, as there are no official statistics on the mother tongue of inhabitants of Sweden, this is hard or impossible to verify. In addition bilingualism is very common for immigrants in Sweden, so the term ''Swedish-speaking'' may be diffuse in that sense.

In the spoken vernacular, especially among young people in Finnish-dominated areas, Finnish [[loanword]]s as well as [[calque]]s from Finnish are frequently incorporated into Finland Swedish. There are also some words in Finland Swedish that would be considered slightly archaic in Sweden. Some government and public service terms that have been created in recent centuries also differ. The same is true of other new words, notably loanwords from [[English language|English]].

A common misconception among many [[Sweden|Swedes]] is that Finland Swedish is simply Swedish spoken with a [[Finnish language|Finnish]] accent, something that can be a considerable source of frustration to most native Swedish-speakers in Finland. Any language adopts features, especially pronunciation habits, from dominant languages it comes in touch with, but many of the traits of Finland Swedish exist also in monolingual areas and some are in fact preserved features of old Swedish, as with [[Scots language|Scots]] in comparison with [[English language|English]], [[Afrikaans]] in comparison with [[Dutch language|Dutch]], or [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Brazilian Portuguese|Brazilian]] and [[Portuguese in Africa|African]] dialects in comparison with modern mainland [[European Portuguese]].

==History==
{{Main|Swedish-speaking Finns#History|l1=History of Swedish-speaking Finns}}
[[File:Flag of Swedish-speaking Finns.svg|thumb|230px|right|Unofficial flag of the Swedish-speakers in Finland]]
From the 16th century, Swedish was the main language of jurisdiction, administration and higher education in [[Finland]] (which was then a part of [[Sweden]]), but the majority of the population in the Finnish inland spoke [[Finnish language|Finnish]] outside of these sectors of society, i.e. in normal, daily life. In 1809, when Finland was conquered by the [[Russian Empire]] and became an autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Grand Duchy]], Swedish remained the only official language. In 1863, both Finnish and Swedish became [[official language]]s with equal status, and by the time of [[Finnish Declaration of Independence|Finland's independence]] in 1917, after a [[Finnicization]] campaign by the [[Fennoman movement]], Finnish clearly dominated in government and society. See further: [[Finland's language strife]].

Finland has since then been a [[bilingual]] country with a Swedish-speaking [[minority language|minority]] (5.6% of [[mainland Finland]]'s population in 2006) living mostly in the coastal areas of southern, south-western, and western Finland. During the 20th century, the [[urbanization]] following the [[Industrial Revolution]] has led to large majorities of Finnish speakers in all major cities. The capital [[Helsinki]] (in Swedish Helsingfors) became predominantly Finnish-speaking as recently as around 1900. A large and important part of the Swedish-speaking population nevertheless lives in the capital.

The autonomous island province of [[Åland]] is an exception, being monolingually Swedish-speaking according to international treaties. It is a matter of definition whether the [[Åland Swedish|Swedish dialects spoken on Åland]] are to be considered a kind of Finland Swedish or not. Most Swedish-speaking Finns and linguists consider them to be closer to some of the dialects spoken in nearby parts of Sweden.

== Official status ==
{{Further|Languages of Finland}}

Swedish is one of the two national languages of the republic of Finland, the other being Finnish. These two languages have formally equal status in nearly all legislation. The other minority languages (such as [[Sami languages|Sami]]) are regulated separately.

Finland Swedish is regulated by the [[Institute for the Languages of Finland]]. Official Swedish is not supposed to be very different from Swedish as found in Sweden. There are however e.g. words regarded as archaic in Sweden, but commonly used in Finland, and terms that differ from their counterparts in Sweden, often because of slight differences in the related legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Hällström-Reijonen, Charlotta af | author2=Reuter, Mikael | title=Finlandssvensk ordbok | location=Helsingfors | publisher=Schildt &amp; Forskningscentralen för de inhemska språken | year=2008 | isbn=978-951-50-1749-9 | language=Finland’s Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bilingualism of municipalities is regulated by the Language Act of 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Kielilaki 6.6.2003/423 [Language Act of 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt; If the minority has increased into at least 3,000 persons or 8% of inhabitants, then the municipality must become bilingual. If the minority has fallen below 3,000 persons and 6% of inhabitants, then the municipality must become monolingual, unless it decides to keep its bilingual status. At present, only one such municipality has done so, namely [[Lohja]] (''Lojo'' in Swedish). The status is reviewed once in a decade, and enacted by a government decree issued by the [[Finnish Council of State]].

The country's public broadcaster, [[Yle]], provides two Swedish-language radio stations, [[Yle Vega]] and [[Yle X3M]]. The Swedish-speaking TV channel [[Yle Fem]] was merged to [[Yle Teema]] in 2017.

==Phonology==
With the exception of the dialects spoken in [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]] along the west coast, close to the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] (example: the dialect spoken in [[Närpes]]), Finland Swedish is not particularly different from Central Swedish. The phoneme {{IPA|/ʉ/}} is more centralized and pronounced like {{IPA|[ʉ]}}, quite similar to how many [[American English]] speakers pronounce /u/ (as in ''moon''). That should be compared to the Central Swedish {{IPA|[ʉ̟]}}, which is very close to the short vowel {{IPA|[ʏ]}} and is more [[rounding|rounded]].

The highly variable [[Sj-sound|''sj'' sound]] {{IPAslink|ɧ}} varies between {{IPA|[ʂ]}} and {{IPA|[ɕ ~ ʃ]}} on the Finnish mainland, often close to ''sh'' in English ''shoe''. In the Åland Islands, its realization is similar to the velar (and often [[labialization|labialized]]) pronunciations of nearby parts of Sweden. The historic ''k'' sound before front vowels and the ''tj'' sound, in modern Central Swedish a [[Fricative consonant|fricative]]  {{IPA|/ɕ/}}, is an [[affricate]] {{IPA|[t͡ɕ]}} or {{IPA|[t͡ʃ]}} in all Finland Swedish dialects, close to ''ch'' in English ''chin'', except for some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Äldre man, Brändö: Har ätit sälkött|url=http://swedia.ling.gu.se/Finland/Aland/Brando/om.html|publisher=swedia.ling.gu.se/|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Åland Swedish]], in which it is a simple fricative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yngre man, Brändö: Brandlarm på Nordsjön|url=http://swedia.ling.gu.se/Finland/Aland/Brando/ym.html|work=swedia.ling.gu.se/|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clips of spoken Swedish, in different dialects"&gt;{{cite web|title=snabbmeny|url=http://swedia.ling.gu.se/snabbmeny.html|publisher=swedia.ling.gu.se/|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=April 2015}}

The [[Pitch accent|tonal word accent]], which distinguishes some minimal pairs in most dialects of Swedish and Norwegian, is not present in Finland Swedish (except around the parish of Snappertuna, west of Helsinki). The so-called "accent 2", used mainly in words with a two-syllable root, is not used at all; instead, "accent 1" is used in all words. Hence, Sweden Swedish [[minimal pair]]s like {{IPA|/ˈandɛn/}} ("the duck") – with stress on only the first syllable – and {{IPA|/ˌandˈɛn/}} ("the spirit") – with both syllables stressed – are both pronounced {{IPA|[ˈandɛn]}} in Finland.

Finland Swedish lacks the [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated stops]] present in Central Standard Swedish, making the contrast between [[Fortis and lenis|"fortis" and "lenis"]] stops one of voicing only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ringen|first=Catherine|author2=Kari Suomi|title=The voicing contrast in Fenno-Swedish stops|journal=Journal of Phonetics|year=2012|volume=40|issue=3|pages=419–429|doi=10.1016/j.wocn.2012.02.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retroflexion that occurs in many dialects when /r/ precedes a coronal consonant does not occur in certain pairs in Finland Swedish (e.g. /rt/, which is realized as [ʈ] in Standard Swedish but [rt] in Finland Swedish).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuronen|first=Mikko|title=Finns det supradentala konsonanter även i finlandssvenskan?|url=http://users.jyu.fi/~mijukuro/supradentaler.pdf|work=Svenskans beskrivning|publisher=Hallgren &amp; Fallgren|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary==
Finland Swedish mostly has the same vocabulary as Swedish in Sweden, and there is a conscious effort to adopt neologisms from Sweden, to maintain cohesion between the two varieties. Nevertheless, there are differences, which generally fall into two categories: words now considered archaic in Sweden, and [[loanword]]s and [[calque]]s from Finnish or independently borrowed from other languages (nowadays mostly English). There are also some terms differing because of differing legislation.

'''Franko Luin''' (April 6, 1941 in [[Trieste]], [[Italy]] &amp;ndash; September 15, 2005 in [[Tyresö]], [[Sweden]]) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] type designer of [[Slovenians|Slovene]] origin. He studied graphic arts at [[Grafiska Institutet]] in Stockholm, where he graduated in 1967. A [[graphic design]]er at the telecom company [[Ericsson]] (1967–1989), He started his own design shop [[Omnibus Typografi]] in 1989.

Franko Luin had a keen interest in languages, particularly the international auxiliary language [[Esperanto]], and was for many years president of the Swedish Esperanto association [[Swedish Esperanto Federation|SEF]]. He wrote poems, translated songs into Esperanto and organized a well renowned homepage, the ''Kiosk'',&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.esperanto.se/kiosk/ Kiosk]'' list of online newspapers. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103210608/http://www.esperanto.se/kiosk/ |date=November 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which had an enormous link list of online newspapers. In his later years, he collected and digitized many 19th and 20th century works by Slovene classical authors and distributed them on his homepage ''Beseda'' ("Word").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omnibus.se/beseda/ Beseda] website {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219165044/http://www.omnibus.se/beseda/ |date=December 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{German grammar}}
[[German verb]]s are conjugated depending on their use: as in English, they are modified depending on the [[Grammatical person|persons]] (identity) and [[Grammatical number|number]] of the subject of a sentence, as well as depending on the tense and mood.

The citation form of German verbs is the infinitive form, which generally consists of the bare form of the verb with ''-(e)n'' added to the end. To conjugate regular verbs, this is removed and replaced with alternative endings: Radical: mach-
* To do; ''machen''
** I do; ''ich mach'''e'''''
** He does; ''er mach'''t'''''
** I did; ''ich mach'''te'''''
** He did; ''er mach'''te'''''

In general, irregular forms of German verbs exist to make for easier and clearer pronunciation, with a vowel sound in the centre of the word the only part of the word that changes in an unexpected way (though endings may also be slightly different). This modification is often a moving of the vowel sound to one pronounced further forward in the mouth. This process is called the [[Germanic umlaut]]. However, a number of verbs including ''sein'' (to be) are fully irregular, as in English ''I am'' and ''I was'' sound completely different.
* To know; ''wissen'' Radical: wiss- wuss- 
** I know; ''ich w'''e'''iß'' or weiss (vowel change; ''-e'' missing) (irregular)
** I knew; ''ich w'''u'''ss'''te''''' (vowel change; otherwise regular)
* To sing; ''singen''
** I sing; ''ich sing'''e''''' (regular)
** I sang; ''ich s'''a'''ng'' (vowel change; ''-te'' missing)

For many German tenses, the verb itself is locked in a non-varying form of the [[infinitive]] or [[past participle]] (which normally starts with ''ge-'') that is the same regardless of the subject, and then joined to an [[auxiliary verb]] that is conjugated. This is similar to English grammar, though the primary verb is normally placed at the end of the clause. Note that in both the examples shown below the auxiliary verb is irregular.
* I '''buy''' the book; ''Ich '''kaufe''' das Buch.''
* I '''will buy''' the book; ''Ich '''werde''' das Buch '''kaufen'''.''
** She '''will buy''' the book; ''Sie '''wird''' das Buch '''kaufen'''.''
* I '''have bought''' the book; ''Ich '''habe''' das Buch '''gekauft'''.''
** She '''has bought''' the book; ''Sie '''hat''' das Buch '''gekauft'''.''

The following tenses and modi are formed by direct conjugation of the verb:
* [[Present tense|Present]] – ''Präsens''
* [[Imperfect tense|Imperfect]] – ''Imperfekt'' or ''Präteritum''
* [[Imperative mood|Imperative]] – ''Imperativ''
* [[Perfect tense|Perfect]] – ''Perfekt'' ([[past participle]], does not vary by subject)
* [[Conditional mood|Conditional]] I and II – ''Konjunktiv''

Below is a paradigm of [[German language|German]] [[verb]]s, that is, a set of [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] tables, for the model [[regular verb]]s and for some of the most common [[irregular verb]]s, including the irregular auxiliary verbs.

==German tenses and moods==
German verbs have forms for a range of subjects, indicating number and social status:
* [[Grammatical person|First-person]] singular: 'I'; ''ich''
* [[Grammatical person|Second-person]] familiar: 'you' (as used to a friend); ''du''
* Second-person familiar: 'you' (as used to a friend); ''Du'' (possible form in letters, traditionally used for all kinds of addresses)
* [[Grammatical person|Third person]]: 'he', 'she', 'it'; ''(er, sie, es)'' with the same form for all three
* First-person plural: 'we'; ''wir''
* Second-person plural: ''ihr''
* Second-person polite: 'you'; ''Sie'' (which is always capitalised)
* Third-person plural: 'they'; ''sie'' (not capitalised)

The subject does not have to be one of these pronouns, but can instead be anything that has the same person and number. For example, in the sentences ''Der Ball ist rund.'' ("The ball is round.") and ''Es ist rund.'' ("It is round."), the verb is in the same form: third-person singular.

In German, the first-person and third-person plural and second-person plural-polite forms are identical for all verbs in every tense. ''Sie'' in the second person is used to address one or more people of high status.

As a summary of German tenses, moods and aspects:
* The German '''[[present tense]]''' matches both the English present ("I walk to work every day") and also the [[present progressive]] ("I '''am walking''' to work right now"), to which standard German has no direct equivalent. (See below for a colloquial alternative.) It is formed similarly to the English present tense, by directly conjugating the relevant verb to match the subject.
* The '''[[Present perfect|perfect]]''' (''I '''have gone''' to work''; also sometimes called the ''present perfect'') is mostly formed, again as in English, from the appropriate present tense form of 'to have' (''haben'') and a past participle of the relevant verb placed at the end of the clause. Some intransitive verbs involving motion or change take 'to be' (''sein'') instead of ''haben''; this may depend on the exact meaning of the sentence. Note that both ''haben'' and ''sein'' are used in the present tense, and are irregular verbs.
** 'He '''has read''' the book': ''Er '''hat''' das Buch '''gelesen'''.'' (Literally, "He has the book read.")
** 'He '''has gone''' into the cinema': ''Er '''ist''' ins Kino gegangen.'' (but literally, "He '''is''' into the cinema gone.")
* The '''[[imperfect]]''' (''I '''closed''' the door;'' usually avoided when speaking) is formed from the verb, as in English. The verb may be regular or irregular.
* The '''[[pluperfect]]''' (''I '''had read''' the book, when...'') is formed in the same way as in English: identically to the perfect, except with an imperfect form of '''haben''' or '''sein''' instead of a present tense form.
** He '''had read''' the book; ''Er '''hatte''' das Buch '''gelesen'''.''
** He '''had gone''' into the cinema; ''Er '''war''' ins Kino '''gegangen'''.''
* The '''[[future tense]]''' (''I will read the book'' or ''I'm going to read the book'') is formed from the appropriate present tense form of the verb ''werden'' (to become) and, as in English, the infinitive of the relevant verb.
** I '''will read''' the book: ''Ich '''werde''' das Buch '''lesen'''.''
** A classic but easily avoided mistake made by English-speakers learning German is to use "''Ich will"'' – which actually means ''I want to''.
* The '''[[imperative mood|imperative]]''' (''Be quiet!'','' Open the door!'') is formed by direct conjugation of the verb and varies by number and status of the people addressed, unlike English which always uses an infinitive.
** '''Be''' quiet: '''''Sei''' ruhig!'' (when speaking to one person); but '''''Seien''' Sie ruhig!'' when speaking to an authority figure. ''Sei'' and ''Seien'' are both formed from ''sein'' (be).
* The '''[[conditional mood|conditional]]''' (''I '''would do''' it'') can be formed from ''würden'' (''would'') and the infinitive of the relevant verb, placed at the end of the clause.
** I '''would love''' her; ''Ich '''würde''' sie '''lieben'''.''
* Additional forms of the conditional (known as'' '''Konjunktiv I &amp; II''''', for the present and imperfect) also exist. They are equivalent to English forms such as ''If I '''were''' rich'' or ''If I '''loved''' him'', (but also ''It '''would be''' great'') and exist for every verb in the present and imperfect tense. They are often avoided for uncommon verbs. For the future tense conditional, the conditional form of ''werden'' is used with an infinitive.
** If I '''were''' rich; ''Wenn ich reich '''wäre''', ...''
** If I '''had''' more money; ''Wenn ich mehr Geld '''hätte''', ...''
** It '''would be''' fantastic; ''Es '''wäre''' fantastisch''
* The '''[[passive voice|passive]]''' (''It is done'') may be formed for any tense. It is formed from the past participle and the appropriate form of the verb ''werden'' (to become).&lt;ref&gt;German frequently forms a passive-equivalent construction using'' 'Man' ''(anybody; formal English 'one'), followed by the relevant tense.
* It is possible to; ''Man kann'' (lit. ''One can'', more loosely ''Someone can'' or ''Anyone can'')
* Anyone (who wanted to) would have done it: ''Man würde es gemacht haben.''&lt;/ref&gt;
** The lawn '''is being mowed'''; ''Der Rasen '''wird gemäht''''' (Literally, "''The lawn becomes/is becoming mowed.''")
** The lawn was mowed; ''Der Rasen wurde gemäht.'' (Literally, "''The lawn became/was becoming mowed.''")
** The lawn has been mowed; ''Der Rasen ist gemäht geworden.''
** The lawn will be mowed; ''Der Rasen wird gemäht werden.'' (This uses the verb ''werden'' twice in one sentence, but is still quite correct.)
** The lawn would be mowed; ''Der Rasen würde gemäht werden.''
* Many German verbs can be converted into the names of jobs, adjectives and [[verbal noun]]s describing processes (as English ''to clean'' becomes ''the cleaner'', ''the man cleaning the window'' and ''the cleaning process''). These generally follow regular patterns, with endings such as ''-en'' and ''-ung''. Colloquial German, in particular in the [[Rhineland]] and [[Ruhr]] areas, uses these verbal nouns with ''sein'' to create a kind of present progressive known as the ''rheinische Verlaufsform'':
** I'm working; "''Ich bin am Arbeiten.''"
** Note that ''Arbeiten'' is not a verb as in the English equivalent but a noun, and is therefore capitalised. A literal translation would be: "''I'm at the working.''"
* A colloquial method to express future actions is to use present tense with an adjective like ''tomorrow'' showing that the event will happen in the future:
** Tomorrow, I '''am going to buy''' groceries.; ''Morgen '''kaufe''' ich Lebensmittel.'' (Literally, ''Tomorrow, I buy groceries.'')

The ending ''-e'' in the imperative singular is almost obligatorily lost in colloquial usage. In the standard language it may be lost or not: ''lieb!'' or ''liebe!'', ''sag!'' or ''sage!''

The ending ''-e'' in the first-person singular of the present is always kept in normal written style (''ich liebe, ich sage''), but may also be lost in colloquial usage (''ich lieb', ich sag'''). This occurs more often than not in the middle of a sentence, somewhat less frequently if the verb comes to stand in the end of a sentence.

==Regular ''-n'' verbs (weak verbs) (''handeln'', to act)==
When a verb stem ends in ''-el'' or ''-er'', the ending ''-en'' is dropped in favor of ''-n''.

==Separable and inseparable verbs==
In German, prepositions and modifying prefixes are frequently attached to verbs to alter their meaning. Verbs so formed are divided into separable verbs which detach the prefix under certain circumstances and inseparable verbs which do not. The conjugations are identical to that of the root verb, and the position of the prefix for both separable and inseparable verbs follows a standard pattern. The prefix's effect on the verb is highly unpredictable, so normally the meaning of each new verb has to be learned separately. (See [[German verbs]] for further information on the meanings of common prefixes.)

Separable verbs detach their prefixes in the present, imperfect and imperative. The prefix is placed at the end of the clause. The past participle is the prefix attached to the normal past participle. The infinitive keeps the prefix where it is used, for example in the conditional and future tenses.
* ''nehmen'' — "to take" (irregular verb)
** ''Er nimmt das Buch'' — He is taking the book. (Vowel change)
** ''Er '''hat''' das Buch '''genommen''''' — He '''has taken''' the book. (Vowel change and the ''-en'' ending common with irregular verbs)
** ''Er '''wird''' das Buch '''nehmen''''' — He '''will take''' the book. (Future tense)
* ''zunehmen'' — to increase (or put on weight)
** ''Es '''nimmt''' schnell '''zu''''' — It is quickly increasing
** ''Es hat schnell '''zugenommen''''' — It has quickly increased
** ''Er '''wird''' es schnell '''zunehmen''''' — He '''will increase''' it quickly. (Increase is being used in the infinitive as this is the future tense.)

Inseparable verbs retain the prefix at all times. The past participle has the prefix in place of ''ge-'' but keeps any irregularities of the root verb's past participle.
* ''kaufen'' — "to buy" (regular verb)
** ''Ich kaufe es'' — I buy it
** ''Ich '''habe''' es '''gekauft''''' — I '''have bought''' it
* ''verkaufen'' — to sell
** ''Ich '''ver'''kaufe es'' — I sell it
** ''Ich habe es '''ver'''kauft'' — I have sold it (regular apart from ''ver-'' replacing ''ge-'')

A number of verbs are separable with one meaning and inseparable with another. For example, ''übersetzen'' means "to translate" as an inseparable verb but "to ferry" as a separable verb.

{{Loop constructs}}

An '''infinite loop''' (or '''endless loop''') is a sequence of instructions in a [[computer program]] which loops endlessly, either due to the [[control flow#Loops|loop]] having no terminating condition, having one that can never be met, or one that causes the loop to start over. In older [[operating system]]s with [[cooperative multitasking]], infinite loops normally caused the entire system to become unresponsive. With the now-prevalent preemptive multitasking model, infinite loops usually cause the program to consume all available processor time, but can usually be terminated by the user. [[Busy waiting|Busy wait]] loops are also sometimes called "infinite loops". Infinite loops are one possible cause for a computer "[[hang (computing)|freezing]]"; others include [[thrashing (computer science)|thrashing]], [[deadlock]], and [[segmentation fault|access violation]]s.

==Intended vs unintended looping==
Looping is repeating a set of instructions until a specific condition is met. An infinite loop occurs when the condition will never be met, due to some inherent characteristic of the loop.

===Intentional looping===
There are a few situations when this is desired behavior. For example, the games on cartridge-based game consoles typically have no exit condition in their main loop, as there is no operating system for the program to exit to; the loop runs until the console is powered off.

Modern interactive computers require that the computer constantly be monitoring for user input or device activity, so at some fundamental level there is an infinite processing [[idle loop]] that must continue until the device is turned off or reset. In the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]], for example, this outer loop was contained in the Exec program, and if the computer had absolutely no other work to do it would loop run a dummy job that would simply turn off the "computer activity" indicator light.

Modern computers also typically do not halt the processor or motherboard circuit-driving clocks when they crash. Instead they fall back to an error condition displaying messages to the operator, and enter an infinite loop waiting for the user to either respond to a prompt to continue, or to reset the device.

==== Multi-threading ====

In multi-threaded programs some threads can be executing inside infinite loops without causing the entire program to be stuck in an infinite loop. If the main thread exits all threads of the process are forcefully stopped thus all execution ends and the process/program terminates. The threads inside the infinite loops can perform "housekeeping" tasks or they can be in a blocked state waiting for input (from socket/queue) and resume execution every time input is received.

===Unintentional looping===
Most often, the term is used for those situations when this is not the intended result; that is, when this is a [[software bug|bug]]. Such errors are most common among novice programmers, but can be made by experienced programmers as well, because their causes can be quite subtle.

One common cause, for example, is that the programmer intends to iterate over a collection of items such as a [[linked list]], executing the loop code once for each item. Improperly formed links can create a ''reference loop'' in the list, where one list element links to one that occurred earlier in the list. This joins part of the list into a circle, causing the program to loop forever.

While most infinite loops can be found by close inspection of the code, there is no ''general'' method to determine whether a given program will ever halt or will run forever; this is the [[undecidable problem|undecidability]] of the [[halting problem]].

==Interruption==
As long as the system is responsive, infinite loops can often be interrupted by sending a signal to the process (such as [[SIGINT (POSIX)|SIGINT]] in Unix), or an [[interrupt]] to the processor, causing the current process to be aborted. This can be done in a [[task manager]], in a terminal with the [[Control-C]] command, or by using the [[kill (command)|kill]] command or [[system call]]. However, this does not always work, as the process may not be responding to signals or the processor may be in an uninterruptible state, such as in the [[Cyrix coma bug]] (caused by overlapping uninterruptible instructions in an [[instruction pipeline]]). In some cases other signals such as [[SIGKILL]] can work, as they do not require the process to be responsive, while in other cases the loop cannot be terminated short of system shutdown.

==Language support==
{{see also|Control flow}}
Infinite loops can be implemented using various [[control flow]] constructs. Most commonly, in unstructured programming this is jump back up ([[goto]]), while in structured programming this is an indefinite loop (while loop) set to never end, either by omitting the condition or explicitly setting it to true, as &lt;code&gt;while (true) ...&lt;/code&gt;.

Some languages have special constructs for infinite loops, typically by omitting the condition from an indefinite loop. Examples include Ada (&lt;code&gt;loop ... end loop&lt;/code&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;[[b:Ada Programming/Control#Endless Loop|Ada Programming: Control: Endless Loop]]&lt;/ref&gt; Fortran (&lt;code&gt;DO ... END DO&lt;/code&gt;), Go (&lt;code&gt;for { ... }&lt;/code&gt;), and Ruby (&lt;code&gt;loop do ... end&lt;/code&gt;).

==Examples of intentional infinite loops==
A simple example (in [[C (programming language)|C]]):

&lt;source lang="c" line="1"&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
  for (;;) // or equivalently, while (1)
  {
    printf("Infinite Loop\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
The form &lt;code&gt;for (;;)&lt;/code&gt; for an infinite loop is traditional, appearing in the standard reference ''[[The C Programming Language]]'', and is often punningly pronounced "forever".&lt;ref&gt;[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20186809/endless-loop-in-c-c Endless loop in C/C++] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803202212/http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20186809/endless-loop-in-c-c |date=2016-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a loop that will print "Infinite Loop" without halting.

A similar example in 1980s-era [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]]:
&lt;source lang="gwbasic"&gt;
10 PRINT "INFINITE LOOP"
20 GOTO 10
&lt;/source&gt;

A similar example in [[X86 assembly language]]:
&lt;source lang="asm"&gt;
loop:
  ; Code to loop here
  jmp loop
&lt;/source&gt;

Another example is in [[DOS]]
&lt;source lang="asm"&gt;
:A
goto :A
&lt;/source&gt;
Here the loop is quite obvious, as the last line unconditionally sends execution back to the first.

An example in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
while (true) 
    System.out.println("Infinite Loop");
&lt;/source&gt;

An example in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
while True:
    print("Infinite Loop")
&lt;/source&gt;

An example in [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]
&lt;source lang="ruby"&gt;
loop { puts "Infinite Loop" }
&lt;/source&gt;

An example in [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]]
&lt;source lang="bash"&gt;
 $ while true; do echo "Infinite Loop"; done
&lt;/source&gt;

An example in [[Perl 5]]
&lt;source lang="perl"&gt;
print "Infinite Loop\n" while 1
&lt;/source&gt;

An example in [[Perl 6]]
&lt;source lang="perl6"&gt;
loop { say "Infinite Loop" }
 
# Alternatively: 
say "Infinite Loop" while True;
&lt;/source&gt;

An example in [[JavaScript]]
&lt;source lang="javascript"&gt;
while (true) {
    console.log("Infinite Loop");
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Examples of unintentional infinite loops==

===Mathematical errors===
Here is one example of an infinite loop in [[Visual Basic]]:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
dim x as integer
do while x &lt; 5
  x = 1
  x = x + 1
loop

&lt;/source&gt;
This creates a situation where &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; will never be greater than 5, since at the start of the loop code &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is given the value of 1, thus, the loop will always end in 2 and the loop will never break. This could be fixed by moving the &lt;code&gt;x = 1&lt;/code&gt; instruction outside the loop. Essentially what this infinite loop does is to instruct a computer to keep on adding 1 to 1 until 5 is reached. Since 1+1 always equals 2, this will never happen.

In some languages, programmer confusion about the mathematical symbols may lead to an unintentional infinite loop. For example, here is a snippet in [[C (programming language)|C]]:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
   int a = 0;
   while (a &lt; 10) {
      printf("%d\n", a);
      if (a = 5)
         printf("a equals 5!\n");
      a++;
   }
   return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The expected output is the numbers 0 through 9, with an interjected "a equals 5!" between 5 and 6. However, in the line "&lt;code&gt;if (a = 5)&lt;/code&gt;" above, the programmer has confused the = (assignment) operator with the == (equality test) operator. Instead, this will assign the value of 5 to &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; at this point in the program. Thus, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; will never be able to advance to 10, and this loop cannot terminate.

===Variable handling errors===

Unexpected behavior in evaluating the terminating condition can also cause this problem. Here is an example (in [[C (programming language)|C]]):

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
float x = 0.1;
while (x != 1.1) {
  printf("x = %f\n", x);
  x = x + 0.1;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

On some systems, this loop will execute ten times as expected, but on other systems it will never terminate. The problem is that the loop terminating condition &lt;tt&gt;(x != 1.1)&lt;/tt&gt; tests for exact equality of two [[floating point]] values, and the way floating point values are represented in many computers will make this test fail, because they cannot represent the value 1.1 exactly.

The same can happen in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]:
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
x = 0.1
while x != 1:
    print(x)
    x += 0.1
&lt;/source&gt;

Because of the likelihood of tests for equality or not-equality failing unexpectedly, it is safer to use greater-than or less-than tests when dealing with floating-point values. For example, instead of testing whether &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; equals 1.1, one might test whether &lt;tt&gt;(x &lt;= 1.0)&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;(x &lt; 1.1)&lt;/tt&gt;, either of which would be certain to exit after a finite number of iterations. Another way to fix this particular example would be to use an [[integer (computer science)|integer]] as a [[control flow|loop index]], counting the number of iterations that have been performed.

A similar problem occurs frequently in [[numerical analysis]]: in order to compute a certain result, an iteration is intended to be carried out until the error is smaller than a chosen tolerance. However, because of rounding errors during the iteration, the specified tolerance can never be reached, resulting in an infinite loop.

==Multi-party loops==
[[File:Google Home vs. Amazon Echo.webm|thumb|Video of infinite loop by Google Home vs. Amazon Echo]]
Although infinite loops in a single program are usually easy to predict, a loop caused by several entities interacting is much harder to foresee. Consider a server that always replies with an error message if it does not understand the request. Apparently, there is no possibility for an infinite loop in the server, but if there are two such servers (A and B), and A receives a message of unknown type from B, then A replies with an error message to B, B does not understand the error message and replies to A with its own error message, A does not understand the error message from B and sends yet another error message, and so on ''ad infinitum.'' One common example of such situation is an [[email loop]].
An example of an email loop is if someone receives mail from a no reply inbox, but their auto-response is on. They will reply to the no reply inbox, triggering the "this is a no reply inbox" response. This will be sent to the user, who then sends an auto reply to the no-reply inbox, and so on and so forth.

==Pseudo-infinite loops==
A pseudo-infinite loop is a loop that appears infinite but is really just a very long loop.

===Very large numbers===
An example in [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]]:
&lt;source lang="bash"&gt;
for x in $(seq 1000000000); do
#loop code
done
&lt;/source&gt;
===Impossible termination condition===
An example [[for loop]] in [[C (programming language)|C]]:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
unsigned int i;
for (i = 1; i != 0; i++) {
  /* loop code */
}
&lt;/source&gt;
It appears that this will go on indefinitely, but in fact the value of &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; will eventually reach the maximum value storable in an &lt;code&gt;unsigned int&lt;/code&gt; and adding 1 to that number will wrap-around to 0, breaking the loop. The actual limit of &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; depends on the details of the system and [[compiler]] used. With [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]], this loop would continue until the computer's [[memory (computers)|memory]] could no longer contain &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; was a signed integer, rather than an unsigned integer, overflow would be undefined. In this case, the loop could be optimized into an infinite loop.

===Infinite recursion===
Infinite recursion is a special case of an infinite loop that is caused by [[recursion]]. 

The following example in VBA returns a [[stack overflow]] error:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
Sub Test1()
  Call Test1
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

The most trivial example of this is the term Ω in the [[lambda calculus]], shown below in [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]:
&lt;source lang="scheme"&gt;
(define big-omega
  (let ((small-omega (lambda (f) (f f))))
    (small-omega small-omega)))
&lt;/source&gt;
Ω is an infinite recursion, and therefore has no [[normal form (abstract rewriting)|normal form]]. When using [[structural recursion]], infinite recursions are usually caused by a missing base case or by a faulty inductive step. An example of such a faulty structural recursion:
&lt;source lang="scheme"&gt;
(define (sum-from-1-to n)
  (+ n (sum-from-1-to (sub1 n))))
&lt;/source&gt;
The function ''sum-from-1-to'' will run out of [[stack-based memory allocation|stack space]], because the recursion never stops — it is infinite. To correct the problem, a base case is added.
&lt;source lang="scheme"&gt;
(define (sum-from-1-to* n)
  (cond
    ((= n 1) 1)
    (else (+ n (sum-from-1-to* (sub1 n))))))
&lt;/source&gt;
This revised function will only run out of stack space if ''n'' is less than 1 or ''n'' is too large; error checking would remove the first case. For information on recursive functions which never run out of stack space, see [[tail recursion]].

See also: [[Recursion]], for an alternate explanation of infinite recursion.

===Break statement===
A "&lt;code&gt;while (true)&lt;/code&gt;" loop looks infinite at first glance, but there may be a way to escape the loop through a [[break statement]] or [[return statement]].
Example in [[PHP]]:
&lt;source lang="php"&gt;
while (true) {
   if ($foo-&gt;bar()) {
      return;
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Alderson loop===
''Alderson loop'' is a rare slang or jargon term for an infinite loop where there is an exit condition available, but inaccessible in the current implementation of the code, typically due to programmer's error. These are most common and visible while [[debugging]] [[user interface]] code.

A C-like pseudocode example of an Alderson loop, where the program is supposed to sum numbers given by the user until zero is given, but where the programmer has used the wrong operator:
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
sum = 0;
while (true) {
   printf("Input a number to add to the sum or 0 to quit");
   i = getUserInput();
   if (i * 0) { // if i times 0 is true, add i to the sum
      sum += i; // sum never change because (i * 0) is 0 for any i; it would change if we had != in the condition instead of *
   }
   if (sum &gt; 100) {
      break;    // terminate the loop; exit condition exists but is never reached because sum is never added to
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The term allegedly received its name from a programmer who had coded a [[modal window|modal]] [[dialog box]] in [[Microsoft Access]] without either an OK or Cancel button, thereby disabling the entire program whenever the box came up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/A/Alderson-loop.html Alderson Loop] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515053043/http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/A/Alderson-loop.html |date=2006-05-15 }} The Jargon File, Version 4.4.7.

'''Jambo!''' (jam-bo!) is a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] [[greeting]] or [[salutation]] with an [[exclamation mark]]. It is similar in meaning to the English word ''[[Hello|Hello!]]''.

==Linguistically==
Specifically, Jambo is a [[Swahili language]] class 5-6 word which are part of the  "collectives" or dialogic actions among groups of people. Jambo primarily means 'affair.'&lt;ref name="Ashton"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashton, E. O. |title=Swahili Grammar: Including intonation |publisher=Longman House |year=1947 |isbn=0-582-62701-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The English word "affair" not used in the sexual connotation, but in the commercial, professional, public or personal business definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Affair |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/affair |date=November 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nurse, Derek, and Hinnebusch, Thomas J. Swahili and Sabaki: a linguistic history. 1993. Series: University of California Publications in Linguistics, v. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Etymology|Etymologically]] it is from amba (-amba) from to say, ultimately from etyl. It is a [[cognate]] with [[Zulu people|Zulu]]. Secondary meanings include as dealing with a thing, issue or matter.&lt;ref name="Ashton"/&gt;

==First use==
The spoken word "Jambo" was once used as a greeting among traders of the [[Swahili coast]] of [[southeast Africa]].&lt;ref name="Prins"&gt;{{cite book |author=Prins, A. H. J.|title="Swahili The Swahili-Speaking Peoples of Zanzibar and the East African Coast (Arabs, Shirazi and Swahili)" Ethnographic Survey of Africa, edited by Daryll Forde  |publisher= International African Institute, London|year=1961 |isbn= }} See also: Prins, A.H.J. 1970. A Swahili Nautical Dictionary. Preliminary Studies in Swahili Lexicon – 1. Dar es Salaam.&lt;/ref&gt; While less formal, it is in widespread use in East Africa and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Ashton, E. O. Swahili Grammar: Including intonation. Longman House. Essex 1947. {{ISBN|0-582-62701-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; While similar to the English word Hello, it really meant to come and settle ones affairs in the business sense. It was used by [[Merchants|traders]] from [[India]], [[China]] and other lands before the [[Portuguese People|Portuguese]] [[Vasco da Gama]] visited the area in 1498. It is in current use.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite book |author=George L. Campbell and Gareth King|title=The Routledge Concise Compendium of the World's Languages (2nd ed.), |publisher= Milton Park, Abingdon ; New York : Routledge |year=2011 |isbn=9780415478410 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thejambostars.blogspot.com/2010/08/what-is-meaning-of-word-jambo.html What is the meaning of Jambo?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=12Swahili&gt;[http://matadornetwork.com/abroad/12-swahili-words-to-know-before-traveling-in-east-africa/ 12 Swahili words to know before traveling in East Africa by Kelly Lalonde]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Useful&gt;[http://www.masai-mara.com/mmsw.htm Useful Swahili]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial use==
During the [[Europe]]an "[[Scramble for Africa]]" which brought a period of "[[Imperialism#Age of Imperialism|Imperialism]]" and [[East Africa#Period of European imperialism|East African European colonialism]], the Swahili word "[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bwana Bwana]" was used to refer to the Europeans.&lt;ref name="R. Mugo Gatheru 2005"&gt;[[R. Mugo Gatheru]] (2005) ''Kenya: From Colonization to Independence, 1888–1970'', McFarland, {{ISBN|0-7864-2199-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Briefly the word today refers to as "Mister" or big boss or an important person and occasionally  used in a derogatory manner.  But the historical reality it was simply "Master." The British dictionary or older English usage refers the word "Master" as a male person who is in charge of others or of a task.&lt;ref&gt;Concise Oxford Dictionary, Tenth Edition on CD ROM 2001 Version 1.1, from the Oxford University Press, Great Clarendon Street, Oxford OX2 2DP, UK cites:
1 chiefly historical a man who has people working for him, especially servants or slaves. Ø dated a male head of a household. Ø the male owner of a dog, cat, etc.
3 a person who has complete control of something: he was master of the situation.
4 a man in charge of an organization or group. Ø chiefly Brit. a male schoolteacher, especially at a public or prep school. Ø the head of a college or school. ...&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways in [[East Africa]] the combined phrase "Jambo Bwana!" (Hello, Master!) became viewed as "Hello, Slave Driver" or "Hello, Slave Master" by those seeking independence especially in [[East Africa#Period of European imperialism|Colonial East Africa]].&lt;ref name="Wunyabari O. Maloba 1993"&gt;Maloba, Wunyabari O. (1993) ''Mau Mau and Kenya: An Analysis of Peasant Revolt'', Indiana University Press, 0852557450.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pqafAAAAMAAJ Evelyne Jone Rich, Immanuel Maurice Wallerstein , Africa:  Tradition and Change (1971)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post Colonial use==
After independence and over a half century of Independence, many still use the word "Jambo!" And some enterprising East Africans use the old imperialist welcoming phrase "Jambo Bwana!" as a welcome greeting seeking tourist dollars.&lt;ref name="Wunyabari O. Maloba 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Jolliffe |first=Lee |coauthors=|title=Tea and Tourism: Tourists, Traditions and Transformations  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BXl1Q3slvDMC |year=2000 |publisher=Channel View Publications |isbn=1-84541-056-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Jambo Bwana|Jambo Bwana!]]" (translated as "Hello Mister!"), is also notably one of the best internationally known Kenyan [[hotel pop]] songs. That welcoming song, with some local variations including the informal name of the "Jambo! Jambo!", is sometimes used to greet visitors to [[Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUrVeRGo5IM Jambo song in Sawhili from YouTube.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, more traditional greeting or welcoming terms are encouraged for tourists to better understand and to relate to the local people. For example: In [[Tanzania]] and for the Swahili language, there are many tourist guides and educational pages which provide common phrases.&lt;ref name="12Swahili"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Useful"/&gt; Below are four basic ways in Swahili to say "Hello!" and a basic polite reply after the dash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hello in Swahili: 19 Cool Swahili Greetings You Should Know|url=http://tanzaniasafariadvisor.com/hello-in-swahili-greetings/|date=September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Hujambo - more correct than Jambo! (how are you?) – Sijambo (seeJAmbo) (I am fine / no worries) &lt;br&gt;
2. Habari? (any news?) – nzuri (nZOOree) (fine) &lt;br&gt;
3. U hali gani? (oo HAlee GAnee) (how are you) – njema (fine) &lt;br&gt;
4. Shikamoo (a young person to an elder) – marahaba

==Surname use==
"Jambo" is also used as a [[surname]] in southeast Africa. For example, [[Zhaimu Jambo]] (born 23 August 1987 in Harare), aka "Jimmy", is a retired Zimbabwean footballer (soccer player).&lt;ref&gt;{{NFT player|pid=22283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other use==
The word jambo has found its way into different cultures and languages. For example, the word [[Jamboree (scouting)]]. This is the Swahili word Jambo used in English, as a borrowed foreign word, with the ending -ree. The word Jamboree is a [[transitive verb]] with a direct action of the primary word Jambo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hopper|first1=Paul J|last2=Thompson|first2=Sandra A|title=Transitivity in grammar and discourse|journal=Language|date=June 1980|volume=56|issue=2|pages=251–299|url=http://latina.phil2.uni-freiburg.de/raible/Lehre/2006/Materialien/Hopper_Thompson.pdf|accessdate=24 January 2016|doi=10.1353/lan.1980.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an attendee of a Jambo is a Jamboree. The word "Jamboree" is used primarily by the [[Scouting]] program before the first Boy Scout ''Jamboree'' in 1920. The word has also come to mean "a lavish or boisterous celebration or party."&lt;ref&gt;Jamboree. Oxford University Press from the Concise Oxford University Dictionary 10th Edition, 1999. (accessed: November 02, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jamboree. Dictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 10th Edition. HarperCollins Publishers. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/jamboree (accessed: November 02, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of a transitive word is "transferee" which the person receiving a transfer (money or goods) is the transfer-ree dropping the extra r. In contrast the person giving the transfer is the "transferor." Such transitive words are still used in formal terms dealing in legal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/T/Transferee.aspx Duhaime's Law Dictionary]: Transferee Definition:
A person who receives property being transferred.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muni Jinvijayji''' (1888–1976) was a scholar of [[orientalism]], [[archeology]], [[indology]] and [[Jainism]] from India.

==Life==
He was born in Rupaheli, Mewad near [[Udaipur]] on 27 January 1888 to Vriddhisinh and Rajkumari. His birth name was Kishansinh Parmar. He lost his parents at early age and after his contact with Muni Devihans, he was interested in Jainism. He was initiated as [[Sthanakvasi]] Jain monk in 1903. He was later initiated in ''Samvegi'' order of [[Shvetambara]] Jain monk and was given new name, Muni Jinvijay. He learned [[Sanskrit]] and [[Prakrit]] literature under Kantivijay, a Jain ascetic from [[Patan, Gujarat]].&lt;ref name=gsp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gujaratisahityaparishad.com/prakashan/photo-gallery/sahitya-sarjako/Muni-Jinvijayji.html|language =Gujarati |title=Muni Jinvijayji|work=[[Gujarati Sahitya Parishad]] |accessdate =15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Datta1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Amaresh Datta|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&amp;pg=PA1258|year=1988|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1194-0|page=1839}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vishwakosh"&gt;{{cite web | title=Jinvijayji | website=[[Gujarati Vishwakosh]] | url=http://vishwakosh.org/vishvakosh/lekh/jinvijayji.html | language=gu | accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being bored of conventional life of ascetic, he renounced monkhood and decided to live as a professor.&lt;ref name="JhaveriAkademi1978"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mansukhlal Maganlal Jhaveri|author-link=Mansukhlal Maganlal Jhaveri|title=History of Gujarati Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DA0RAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=5 August 2014|year=1978|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|location=New Delhi|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined [[Gujarat Vidyapith]] as a principal of archeology department for few years on invitation of [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhiji]].&lt;ref name="Sharma1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sita Ram Sharma|title=Gujarati|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-IVhAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=6 August 2014|year=1992|publisher=Anmol Publications|isbn=978-81-7041-545-9|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to Germany in 1928 to study [[Indology]]. He returned to India in 1929. He participated in [[Salt March]] of [[Indian independence movement]] in 1930 and was imprisoned at [[Nasik Jail]] where he met [[K. M. Munshi]]. He joined [[Shantiniketan]] as a professor of Jain literature and taught there from 1932 to 1936. He headed archeology department of [[Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan]] in 1939. He became honorary director of [[Rajasthan Oriental Research Institute]] in 1950. He served as a head of history and archeology department of [[Gujarati Sahitya Parishad]].&lt;ref name="Chavda1982"&gt;{{cite book|author=V. K.

He died following lung cancer on 3 June 1976 at [[Ahmedabad]].&lt;ref name=gsp/&gt;&lt;ref name="Datta1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vishwakosh"/&gt;

'''Julia Franck''' (born 20 February 1970 in [[East Berlin]]) is a German writer.

==Life==
Julia Franck, a twin, is the daughter of the actress Anna Franck and of the television producer Jürgen Sehmisch.

In 1978 the family moved to [[West Berlin]] where they spent nine months in a [[Marienfelde refugee transit camp|refugee camp]].  and later to [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. Franck studied German Literature and American Studies at the [[Free University of Berlin]] and spent some time in the United States, Mexico and Guatemala. She worked as an editor for [[Sender Freies Berlin]] and contributed to various newspapers and magazines. She lives with her children in Berlin. 

==Literary works==
Franck is the author of five novels, one short story collections, and the editor of a collection of essays. Her three most recent novels, ''Lagerfeuer'', ''Die Mittagsfrau'', and ''Rücken an Rücken'', as well as the collection ''Grenzübergänge'', engage explicitly with twentieth-century German history. ''Lagerfeuer'' is set in the West Berlin refugee camp Berlin-Marienfelde in the 1970s and follows four main characters, one of whom, Nelly Senff, has fled East Berlin with her two young children. ''Rücken an Rücken'' is also set during the years of Germany's division, ending in the early 1960s, and ''Die Mittagsfrau'' spans from World War I to divided Germany of the 1950s.

Although Franck has not described herself as a feminist author, feminist scholars have noted her presentation of women's experience of history, power structures, sexuality, and relationships (such as motherhood).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Playing House: Motherhood, Intimacy, and Domestic Spaces in Julia Franck's Fiction|last = Hill|first = Alexandra|publisher = Peter Lang|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pocket Books, New York,1977, p. 129.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warren Blatt "presentation first given at the 18th Seminar on Jewish Genealogy, Los Angeles, July 1998" http://www.jewishgen.org/infofiles/givennames/slide6.html&lt;/ref&gt; is the secular name held by Jewish people&lt;ref&gt;Potok, Chaim.

William Morrow and company, New York, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to the language spoken by the country they reside in, differing from their Biblical Hebrew name.

The religious name is in Hebrew (for example, [[Moses ben Maimon]];&lt;ref&gt;Telushkin, Joseph. Jewish literacy. William Morrow and company, New York, 1991, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph ben Gershon;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=440&amp;letter=J&lt;/ref&gt; Shlomeh Arieh ben David HaLevi;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cemeteryscribes.com/getperson.php?personID=I5361&amp;tree=Cemeteries&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gershom ben Judah]]; Devorah bat Avraham), and the secular name is in whatever language is in use in the geographic locality (for example, [[Isaiah Berlin]];&lt;ref&gt;Ignatieff,Michael.''Isaiah Berlin: A Life''. Henry Holt and company, New York, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Solomon Lyon [[Barnard]];&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cemeteryscribes.com/getperson.php?personID=I5361&amp;tree=Cemeteries&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]];&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/freud/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Golda Meir]];&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/meir.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Etta Cone]] &lt;ref&gt;Gabriel, Mary, ''The Art of Acquiring: A Portrait of Etta and Claribel Cone''. Bancroft Press, Baltimore, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;).

==History==

When [[Jews]] arrived in a new country, a secular name was often chosen from the local language. In Central and Eastern Europe, [[Yiddish]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewfaq.org/yiddish.htm&lt;/ref&gt; was the secular language, so a Hebrew name was used in religious and Jewish community contexts and a [[Yiddish]] name was used (the kinnui) in secular contexts. In [[France]], the secular name was in [[French language|French]]; in [[Spain]] in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], in North [[Africa]] and the middle East in [[Arabic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genealoj.org/ENtexte/page15 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005000224/http://www.genealoj.org/ENtexte/page15 |archivedate=2011-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in ancient [[Babylon]], the kinnui was in [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]] and so on. Some kinnuim (the Hebrew plural of "Kinnui") are based on synonyms (words that have the same or similar meaning but are spelled differently); for example, Mikhail = Yekhiel; Menahem = Mendel; Asher = Anshel. Some Kinnuim represent the ancestral tribes of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/296740/Israel&lt;/ref&gt; referencing the animal-like attributes of four of the sons of [[Jacob]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/298924/Jacob&lt;/ref&gt; and one of his grandsons: [[Judah (Biblical person)|Judah]], the [[lion]] (e.g. the family name Lyon, Loewe); Benjamin, the [[wolf]] (e.g. the family name Woolf); [[Naftali]], the [[deer]] (e.g. the family names Hirsch, Hersch, Harris); and [[Issachar]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.israel-a-history-of.com/issachar.html&lt;/ref&gt; the [[donkey|ass]] &lt;ref&gt;Genesis at 49:1-27 http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0149.htm#1&lt;/ref&gt;(or the [[bear]]) (e.g. the family names Bar, Baer, Barell, [[Barnard]], [[Sarah Bernhardt|Bernhardt]], Berthold, Schulter &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=51&amp;letter=N&lt;/ref&gt;); plus [[Ephraim]], the [[fish]] (e.g. the family name Fish).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genealoj.org/ENtexte/page151 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222091621/http://www.genealoj.org/ENtexte/page151 |archivedate=2008-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian Emperor [[Joseph II Habsburg]], who controlled a substantial part of Europe in the late 18th century, was the first head of government in Europe to require Jews to register a permanent family surname. His decree required (on pain of substantial fines for non-compliance) that this surname be (or, at least, sound like) German.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewfaq.org/jnames.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A translation of this 1787 decree is published on the Polish-Jewish genealogy website Shoreshim.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shoreshim.org/en/infoEmperorJoseph.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Jews were compelled to take surnames with a German sound, and usually, they could not choose them. These arbitrary family names generally had no relationship with either the trade or craft, nor the physical attributes, nor the geographic origin of the persons so named. For example, Schwarz, Klug, Weiss, Gross, Klein, Fein and Roth. There are also many names formed with two German roots such as Morgenstern, Morgenstein, Apfelbaum, Birnbaum, Rosenberg, Rosenblum, Rosenbaum, Weinbaum, Weinberg, [[Bernstein]]. The spelling of these names varied considerably, especially when they migrated through Poland or Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genealoj.org/ENtexte/page15.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305134938/http://www.genealoj.org/ENtexte/page15.html |archivedate=2009-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The frequency of German surnames for Jews in the Russian Empire may be due to migration from Western Europe.

Subsequently, in 1808, [[Napoleon]]&lt;ref&gt;Schom, Alan ''Napoleon Bonaparte''.HarperPerennial, New York,1998, {{ISBN|0-06-092958-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; returned from victories in [[Germany]] and proclaimed the religious freedom of the Jews, granting them political rights in [[France]]. He also demanded that all Jews within his empire take a family name. Many Jews were still known only by a Hebrew name or "shem hakodesh" (hakodesh meaning "the sacred"; shem meaning "name") for example, Yaakov ben Yehudah. Under this directive, many Jews took names derived from towns where they traded, such as [[Hamburg]]er, [[Berlin]]er, [[Mainz]] or [[Frankfurt]]er, while others used occupations as names such as Miller, Schuster, Schneider, [[Cantor (surname)|Cantor]] or Bronfenbrenner. Others used characteristics, such as Friedman, or used a patronymic or tribal name such as Jacobs or Benjamin. When [[Napoleon]] conquered [[Province of Westphalia|Westphalen]], a German principality, he imposed these regulations on the Germans as well.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Falk "[http://jbuff.com/c070104.htm Napoleon and Jewish Emancipation]". Retrieved August 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Arabic-speaking Jews, Arabic names were adopted, such as Ḥassan, Abdallah, Sahl; or [[Hebrew]] names were translated into [[Arabic]], for example, Eleazar into Manẓur, Ovadia into Abdallah, Maẓliaḥ into Maimun.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=51&amp;letter=N&lt;/ref&gt;  "Ibn" (analogous to the Hebrew "ben") was used to form a family name. Examples of this formula are Ibn Aknin, Ibn Danan, Ibn Laṭif. In the Jews of Arab lands a linguistic mixing happened and names appear with both Hebrew and Arabic elements in the same name, for example, [[Abraham Ibn Ezra]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/IbnEzra.html&lt;/ref&gt;  A peculiarity of the Arabic names is the [[Kunya (Arabic)|kunyah]], the by-name given to a father after the birth of his son, by which the father is named after the son (using the prefix "Abu"). For example Abu al-Walid is a kunyah for the father of a son named [[Jonah]]. "Abu" also forms family names, as in the case of Abudarham, or Aboab.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=51&amp;letter=N&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabic article "al" appears in quite a number of names, as in Al-Ḥarisi.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=51&amp;letter=N&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

The secular name is the name  that appears in civil documents. The "shem hakodesh"  usually appears only in connection with Jewish religious observances, for example, a record of [[circumcision]] (brit&lt;ref&gt;Telushkin, Joseph. ''Jewish literacy''.William Morrow and company, New York, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;), in a marriage contract ([[ketubah]] &lt;ref&gt;Telushkin, Joseph. ''Jewish literacy''.William Morrow and company, New York, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;), a writ of divorce (get&lt;ref&gt;Telushkin, Joseph. ''Jewish literacy''.William Morrow and company, New York, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;) or on a memorial stone.

'''Kripa Ram khiriya''' was a famous [[Rajasthani Language|Rajasthani]] poet. He wrote the famous 'Rajia Ra Doha' on Ethics (नीति) in Rajasthani during the reign of Rao Raja Devi Singh.

The poet Kripa Ram born to Jagaramji of the [[Charan]] family in the Kharadi village of the then [[Marwar]] empire.  Thakur Jalim Singhji of [[Kuchaman City|Kuchaman]] had given Jagir of Jasuri village to Jagaramji, the poet born there only. Then Rao Raja Laxman Singh Ji of [[Sikar]] had given Jagirs of Maharajpur and Laxmnapura in 1847 and 1858 to the poet after impressing by his great poetry and knowledge of [[Sanskrit]]. The poet Kripa Ram had written couplets "Rajia ra doha" or "Rajia Re saurathe" on ethics to make his servant Rajia immortal as asked by him in return of his great services to the poet. His couplets were 140, now out of that 127 only available.

One of his couplets is:
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|
{{lang|raj|उद्दम करो अनेक, अथवा अनउद्दम करौ {{!}}
होसी निहचै हेक , रांम करै सो राजिया {{!}}{{!}} }}
|
The human does how much or doesn't,
but Rajia only that will happen which is decided by the God!}}

'''Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis''' ({{IPA-pt|ʒwɐˈkĩ mɐˈɾi.ɐ mɐˈʃadu dʒi ɐˈsis|lang}}), often known by his surnames as '''Machado de Assis''', ''Machado,'' or ''Bruxo do [[Cosme Velho]]''&lt;ref name="vainfas3"&gt;Vainfas, p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt; (21 June 1839 – 29 September 1908), was a pioneer [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] novelist, poet, playwright and short story writer. Widely regarded as the greatest writer of [[Brazilian literature]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonio Candido|Candido; Antonio]] (1970), ''Vários escritos.'' São Paulo: Duas Cidades. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, Helen (1970), ''Machado de Assis: The Brazilian Master and his Novels.'' Berkeley, Los Angeles/London: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez, Oscar, "Machado de Assis: The Brazilian Master and His Novels", ''The Modern Language Journal'', Vol. 55, No. 4 (April 1971), pp. 255–256.&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless he did not gain widespread popularity outside Brazil in his own lifetime. In 1897 he founded and became the first President of the [[Brazilian Academy of Letters]]. He was [[multilingualism|multilingual]], having taught himself French, English, German and Greek in later life. 

Machado's works had a great influence on Brazilian literary schools of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1941, the [[Brazilian Academy of Letters]] founded in his honor the [[Prêmio Machado de Assis]] (Machado de Assis Award), the most prestigious literary award in Brazil. For his innovation and audacity in early themes, Assis is often seen as a writer of unprecedented production, being known for his irony and wide vocabulary. Among his most famous works are  ''[[Dom Casmurro]]'' (1899), ''[[Memórias Póstumas de Brás Cubas]]'' ("Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas", also translated as ''Epitaph of a Small Winner'') and ''[[Quincas Borba]]'' (also known in English as ''Philosopher or Dog?''). Machado de Assis was included on American [[literary critic]] [[Harold Bloom]]'s list of the greatest 100 geniuses of literature; and although Machado de Assis was of mixed ethnicity, Bloom considers him the greatest [[Black people|black]] writer in Western literature.

==Biography==

===Birth and adolescence===
[[File:Morro do Livramento, onde Machado nasceu.jpg|thumb|left|Morro do Livramento. The arrow in the right corner shows the house where Machado was probably born and spent his childhood.]]
Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis was born on 21 June 1839 in [[Rio de Janeiro]], then capital of the [[Empire of Brazil]].&lt;ref name="scarano14"&gt;Scarano, p. 766.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vainfas5"&gt;Vainfas, p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enciclop2"&gt;''Enciclopédia Barsa'', p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Francisco José de Assis, a [[mulatto]] wall painter, the son of [[Slavery in Brazil|freed slaves]],&lt;ref name="demografia"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://educacao.uol.com.br/biografias/machado-de-assis.jhtm|title=Machado de Assis |language= |author= |work= |date= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Maria Leopoldina da Câmara Machado, an [[Azorean]] Portuguese washerwoman.&lt;ref name="vainfas5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scarano, p. 765.&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in Livramento country house, owned by ''Dona'' Maria José de Mendonça Barroso Pereira, widow of senator Bento Barroso Pereira, who protected his parents and allowed them to live with her.&lt;ref name="scarano14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vainfas5" /&gt; ''Dona'' Maria José became Joaquim's godmother; her brother-in-law, commendatory Joaquim Alberto de Sousa da Silveira, was his godfather, and both were paid homage by giving their names to the baby.&lt;ref name="scarano14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vainfas5" /&gt; Machado had a sister who died young.&lt;ref name="enciclop2" /&gt; Joaquim studied in a public school, but was not a good student.&lt;ref name="scarano14" /&gt; While helping to serve masses, he met Father Silveira Sarmento, who became his Latin teacher and also a good friend.&lt;ref name="scarano14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vainfas5" /&gt;

When Joaquim was ten years old, his mother died, and his father took him along as he moved to [[São Cristóvão]], [[Sergipe]]. Francisco de Assis met the [[mulatta]] Maria Inês da Silva, and they married in 1854.&lt;ref name="scarano14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vainfas5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="enciclop2" /&gt; Joaquim had classes in a school for girls only, thanks to his stepmother who worked there making candies. At night he learned French with an immigrant baker.&lt;ref name="scarano14" /&gt; In his adolescence, he met the mulatto Francisco de Paulo Brito, who owned a bookstore, a newspaper and typography.&lt;ref name="scarano14" /&gt; On 12 January 1855, Francisco de Paula published the poem ''Ela'' ("She") written by Joaquim, then 15 years old, in the newspaper ''Marmota Fluminense''.&lt;ref name="scarano14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vainfas5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="enciclop2" /&gt; In the following year, he was hired as typographer's apprentice in the ''Imprensa Oficial'' (the Official Press, charged with the publication of Government measures), where he was encouraged as a writer by [[Manuel Antônio de Almeida]], the newspaper's director and also a novelist.&lt;ref name="scarano14" /&gt; There he also met [[Francisco Otaviano]], journalist and later liberal senator, and [[Quintino Bocaiúva]], who decades later would become known for his role as a republican orator.&lt;ref name="scarano15"&gt;Scarano, p. 767.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career and education===
[[File:Imprensa Nacional onde trabalhou como tipógrafo, por Marc Ferrez.jpg|thumb|left|National Press, c.1880, where Machado de Assis began his services as typographer and reviser.]]
Francisco Otaviano hired Machado to work on the newspaper ''Correio Mercantil'' as a proofreader in 1858.&lt;ref name="enciclop2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scarano15" /&gt; He continued to write for the ''Marmota Fluminense'' and also for several other newspapers, but he did not earn much and had a humble life.&lt;ref name="enciclop2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scarano15" /&gt; As he did not live with his father anymore, it was common for him to eat only once a day for lack of money.&lt;ref name="scarano15" /&gt;

Around this time, he became a friend of the writer and liberal politician [[José de Alencar]], who taught him English. From [[English literature]], he was influenced by [[Laurence Sterne]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and [[Jonathan Swift]]. He learned German years later and in his old age, [[Greek language|Greek]].&lt;ref name="scarano15" /&gt; He was invited by Bocaiúva to work at his newspaper ''Diário do Rio de Janeiro'' in 1860.&lt;ref name="vainfas5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scarano16"&gt;Scarano, p. 769&lt;/ref&gt; Machado had a passion for theater and wrote several plays for a short time; his friend Bocaiúva concluded: "Your works are meant to be read and not played."&lt;ref name="scarano16" /&gt; He gained some notability and began to sign his writings as J. M. Machado de Assis, the way he would be known for posterity: Machado de Assis.&lt;ref name="scarano16" /&gt;

[[File:Machado 25 anos.jpg|thumb|right|Machado de Assis when he was 25 years old, 1864.]]

His father Francisco de Assis died in 1864. Machado learned of his father's death through acquaintances. He dedicated his compilation of poems called "''Crisálidas''" to his father: "To the Memory of Francisco José de Assis and Maria Leopoldina Machado de Assis, my Parents."&lt;ref name="scarano9"&gt;Scarano, p. 770.&lt;/ref&gt; With the Liberal Party's ascension to power about that time, Machado thought he might receive a patronage position that would help him improve his life. To his surprise, aid came from the Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Dom Pedro II]], who hired him as director-assistant in the ''Diário Oficial'' in 1867, and knighted him as an honor.&lt;ref name="scarano9" /&gt; In 1888 Machado was made an officer of the [[Order of the Rose]].&lt;ref name="enciclop2" /&gt;

===Marriage and family===

In 1868 Machado met the Portuguese Carolina Augusta Xavier de Novais, five years older than him.&lt;ref name="scarano9" /&gt; She was the sister of his colleague Faustino Xavier de Novais, for whom he worked on the magazine ''O Futuro''.&lt;ref name="enciclop2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scarano15" /&gt; Afflicted with a stammer, Machado was extremely shy, short and lean, but he was very intelligent and well learned.&lt;ref name="scarano9" /&gt; He married Carolina on 12 November 1869; although her parents Miguel and Adelaide, and her siblings disapproved because Machado was mulatto and she was of purely European ancestry.&lt;ref name="vainfas5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scarano9" /&gt; They had no children.&lt;ref name=Scarano780&gt;Scarano, p. 780.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
[[File:MarcFerrez MachadodeAssis.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Machado de Assis around age 41, by [[Marc Ferrez (photographer)|Marc Ferrez]], c. 1880.]]
Machado managed to rise in his bureaucratic career, first in the Agriculture Department. Three years later, he became the head of a section in it.&lt;ref name="vainfas5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scarano13"&gt;Scarano, p. 773.&lt;/ref&gt; He published two poetry books: ''Falenas'', in 1870, and ''Americanas'', in 1875.&lt;ref name="scarano13" /&gt; Their weak reception made him explore other literary genres.

He wrote five [[Romanticism|romantic]] novels: ''[[Ressurreição]]'', ''[[A Mão e Luva]]'', ''[[Helena (Machado de Assis novel)|Helena]]'' and ''Iaiá Garcia''.&lt;ref name="scarano13" /&gt; The books were a success with the public, but literary critics considered them mediocre.&lt;ref name="scarano13" /&gt; Machado suffered repeated attacks of [[epilepsy]], apparently related to hearing of the death of his old friend José de Alencar. He was left [[Depression (mood)|melancholic]], pessimistic and fixed on death.&lt;ref&gt;Scarano, pp. 774–774.&lt;/ref&gt; His next book, marked by "a skeptical and [[Literary realism|realistic]] tone": ''[[Memórias Póstumas de Brás Cubas]]'' (Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas, also translated as ''Epitaph of a Small Winner''), is widely considered a masterpiece.&lt;ref name="scarano10"&gt;Scarano, p. 774.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1880s, Machado had gained wide renown as a writer.&lt;ref name="enciclop2" /&gt;

Although he was opposed to slavery, he never spoke against it in public.&lt;ref name="scarano13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="daniel3"&gt;Daniel, pp. 61–152.&lt;/ref&gt; He avoided discussing politics.&lt;ref name="scarano10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="daniel3" /&gt; He was criticized by the [[slavery in Brazil|abolitionist]] [[José do Patrocínio]] and by the writer [[Lima Barreto]] for staying away from politics, especially the cause of abolition.&lt;ref name="vainfas3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="daniel3" /&gt; He was also criticized by them for having married a white woman.&lt;ref name="vainfas3" /&gt; Machado was caught by surprise with the monarchy overthrown on 15 November 1889.&lt;ref name="scarano10" /&gt; Machado had no sympathy towards [[republicanism]],&lt;ref name="scarano10" /&gt; as he considered himself a liberal [[monarchism|monarchist]]&lt;ref name="bueno1"&gt;Bueno, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; and venerated Pedro II, whom he perceived as "a humble, honest, well-learned and patriotic man, who knew how to make of a throne a chair [for his simplicity], without diminishing its greatness and respect."&lt;ref&gt;Vainfas, p. 201: "Machado de Assis, porém, soube definí-lo em rápidos traços: um homem lhano, probo, instruído, patriota, que soube fazer do sólio uma poltrona, sem lhe diminuir a grandeza e a consideração."&lt;/ref&gt; When a commission went to the public office where he worked to remove the picture of the former emperor, the shy Machado defied them: "The picture got in here by an order and it shall leave only by another order."&lt;ref name="scarano10" /&gt;

The birth of the Brazilian republic made Machado become more critical and an observer of the Brazilian society of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Bueno, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, he wrote "not only the greatest novels of his time, but the greatest of all time of Brazilian literature."&lt;ref name="bueno1" /&gt; Works such as ''[[Quincas Borba]]'' ''(Philosopher or Dog?)'' (1891), ''[[Dom Casmurro]]'' (1899), ''Esaú e Jacó'' (1904) and ''Memorial de Aires'' (1908), considered masterpieces,&lt;ref name="bueno1" /&gt; were successes with both critics and the public.&lt;ref&gt;Scarano, p. 777.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893 he published "A Missa do Galo" ("Midnight Mass"), considered his greatest short story.&lt;ref&gt;Scarano, p. 775.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
[[File:Enterro de Machado de Assis 2 (1908).jpg|thumb|Students and friends, among them Euclides da Cunha, leave the Academy carrying the coffin of Machado de Assis to the Cemetery St. John the Baptist, 1908.]]
Machado de Assis, along with fellow [[monarchist]]s such as [[Joaquim Nabuco]], [[Manuel de Oliveira Lima]], [[Afonso Celso, Viscount of Ouro Preto]] and [[Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay]], and other writers and intellectuals, founded the [[Brazilian Academy of Letters]]. He was its first president, from 1897 to 1908, when he died.&lt;ref name="vainfas3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="enciclop2" /&gt; For many years, he requested that the government grant a proper headquarters to the Academy, which he managed to obtain in 1905.&lt;ref name="scarano11"&gt;Scarano, p. 778.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902 he was transferred to the accountancy's directing board of the [[Brazilian Ministry of Industry|Ministry of Industry]].&lt;ref name="scarano11" /&gt;

His wife Carolina Novais died on 20 October 1904, after 35 years of a "perfect married life".&lt;ref name="vainfas3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scarano11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Enciclopédia Barsa'', p. 267: "vida conjugal perfeita".&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling depressed and lonely, Machado died at 3:20&amp;nbsp;am on 29 September 1908.&lt;ref name=Scarano780 /&gt;

==Narrative style==
[[File:Memorias Posthumas de Braz Cubas.jpg|thumb|left|Volume of [[The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas]] dedicated by the author himself to the [[National Library of Brazil]].]]
Machado's style is unique, and several [[literary critic]]s have tried to describe it since 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, Silvio (1897), ''Machado de Assis: Estudo Comparativo da Literatura Brasileira'', Rio de Janeiro: Laemmert.&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered by many the greatest Brazilian writer of all time, and one of the world's greatest novelists and short story writers. His chronicles do not share the same status. His poems are often misunderstood for the use of crude terms, sometimes associated to the pessimist style of [[Augusto dos Anjos]], another Brazilian writer.
Machado de Assis was included on American [[literary critic]] [[Harold Bloom]]'s list of the greatest 100 geniuses of literature, alongside writers such as [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Shakespeare]] and [[Cervantes]]. Bloom considers him the greatest [[Black people|black]] writer in Western literature; this is based on United States's conceptions of race, which are [[Race and ethnicity in Brazil|not the same in Brazil]],&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, pp. 10–76.&lt;/ref&gt; where he is considered [[mulato]].&lt;ref name="Daniel0"&gt;Daniel (2012): "As a mulatto, Machado experienced the ambiguity of racial identity throughout his life."&lt;/ref&gt; 

His works have been studied by critics in various countries of the world, such as Giuseppe Alpi (Italy), Lourdes Andreassi (Portugal), Albert Bagby Jr. (US), Abel Barros Baptista (Portugal), Hennio Morgan Birchal (Brazil), Edoardo Bizzarri (Italy), Jean-Michel Massa (France), [[Helen Caldwell]] (US), John Gledson (England), Adrien Delpech (France), Albert Dessau (Germany), Paul B. Dixon (US), Keith Ellis (US), [[Edith Fowke]] (Canada), [[Anatole France]] (France), Richard Graham (US), Pierre Hourcade (France), David Jackson (US), G. Reginald Daniel (US), Linda Murphy Kelley (US), John C. Kinnear, Alfred Mac Adam (US), Victor Orban (France), [[Daphne Patai]] (US), Houwens Post (Italy), [[Samuel Putnam]] (US), John Hyde Schmitt, Tony Tanner (England), Jack E. Tomlins (US), Carmelo Virgillo (US), Dieter Woll (Germany) and [[Susan Sontag]] (US).&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sontag, Foreword. ''Epitaph of a Small Winner''. By J. M. Machado de Assis. Trans. William Grossman. New York: [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]], 1990. xi–xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics are divided as to the nature of Machado de Assis's writing. Some, such as Abel Barros Baptista, classify Machado as a staunch anti-realist, and argue that his writing attacks Realism, aiming to negate the possibility of representation or the existence of a meaningful objective reality. Realist critics such as John Gledson are more likely to regard Machado's work as a faithful description of Brazilian reality—but one executed with daring innovative technique. In light of Machado's own statements, Daniel argues that Machado's novels represent a growing sophistication and daring in maintaining a dialogue between the aesthetic subjectivism of Romanticism (and its offshoots) and the aesthetic objectivism of Realism-Naturalism. Accordingly, Machado's earlier novels have more in common with a hybrid mid-19th-century current often referred to as "Romantic Realism."&lt;ref name="daniel2"&gt;Daniel, pp. 190–237.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, his later novels have more in common with another late 19th-century hybrid: literary Impressionism. Historians such as Sidney Chalhoub argue that Machado's prose constitutes an exposé of the social, political and economic dysfunction of late Imperial Brazil. Critics agree on how he used innovative techniques to reveal the contradictions of his society. Roberto Schwarz points out that Machado's innovations in prose narrative are used to expose the hypocrisies, contradictions, and dysfunction of 19th-century Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, pp. 153–218.&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarz,  argues that Machado inverts many narrative and intellectual conventions to reveal the pernicious ends to which they are used. Thus we see critics reinterpret Machado according to their own designs or their perception of how best to validate him for their own historical moment. Regardless, his incisive prose shines through, able to communicate with readers from different times and places, conveying his ironic and yet tender sense of what we, as human beings, are.&lt;ref name="daniel2" /&gt;

Machado's literary style has inspired many Brazilian writers. His works have been adapted to television, theater and cinema. In 1975 the ''Comissão Machado de Assis'' ("Machado de Assis Commission"), organized by the Brazilian Ministry of Education and Culture, organized and published critical editions of Machado's works, in 15 volumes. His main works have been translated into many languages. Great 20th-century writers such as [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Cabrera Infante]] and [[Carlos Fuentes]], as well as the American film director [[Woody Allen]], have expressed their enthusiasm for his fiction.&lt;ref name=rocha&gt;{{cite journal |first=João Cezar de Castro |last=Rocha |url=http://www.plcs.umassd.edu/pdfs/plcs13_14_intro.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625042658/http://www.plcs.umassd.edu/pdfs/plcs13_14_intro.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2008 |title=Introduction |journal=Portuguese Literature and Cultural Studies |volume=13/14 |year=2006 |pages=xxiv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the efforts and patronage of such well-known intellectuals as [[Susan Sontag]], [[Harold Bloom]], and [[Elizabeth Hardwick (writer)|Elizabeth Hardwick]], Machado's books—the most famous of which are available in English in multiple translations—have never achieved large sales in the English-speaking world and he continues to be relatively unknown, even in comparison with other Latin American writers.

In his works, Machado appeals directly to the reader, breaking the so-called [[fourth wall]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

'''Manglish''' ('''Malaysian English''') is an English-based [[pidgin]] or [[Creole language|creole]] spoken in [[Malaysia]].

The vocabulary of Manglish consists of words originating from [[English language|English]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Min Nan|Hokkien]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Malayalam]] and, to a lesser extent, various other European languages, while Manglish syntax resembles southern varieties of Chinese. Also, elements of [[Historical Dictionary of American Slang|American]] and [[Australian slang]] have come through from imported television series.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JgY1CJTKH6gC&amp;pg=PA116 Lingua et Linguistica 1.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Malaysian Manglish is sometimes known as Rojak or [[Bahasa Rojak]], but it differs from the Rojak language by the usage of English as the base language. The East Coast versions (Kelantan and Terengganu) of Manglish may differ greatly, as their accent of Malay and the jargon are particularly alien to regular Malaysian (West Coast) speakers.

Manglish in the West coast of [[West Malaysia]] is very similar (and sometimes identical) to [[Singlish]].

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
Manglish shares substantial linguistic similarities with [[Singlish]] in [[Singapore]], although distinctions can be made, particularly in vocabulary.

Initially, "Singlish" and "Manglish" were essentially the same language, when both Singapore and the states now comprising Peninsular Malaysia were under various forms of direct and indirect British colonial rule, though not forming a single administrative unit except between 1963 and 1965.  (See [[British Malaya|Malaya]]).  In old British Malaya, English was the language of the British administration whilst Malay was the lingua franca of the street.  Even ethnic Chinese would speak Malay when addressing other Chinese people who did not speak the same Chinese dialect.

English as spoken in Malaysia is based on [[British English]] and called [[Malaysian English]]. British spelling is generally followed. However, the influence of [[American English]] modes of expression and slang is strong, particularly among Malaysian youth.

Since 1968, [[Malay language|Malay]] has been the country's sole official language. While English is widely used, many Malay words have become part of common usage in informal English or Manglish. An example is suffixing sentences with ''lah'', as in, "Don't be so worried-lah", which is usually used to present a sentence as rather light-going and not so serious, the suffix has no specific meaning. However, Chinese dialects also make abundant use of the suffix ''lah'' and there is some disagreement as to which language it was originally borrowed from. There is also a strong influence from [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]], [[Hokkien dialect|Hokkien]], and [[Tamil language|Tamil]], which are other major dialects and languages spoken in Malaysia. Manglish also uses some archaic British terms from the era of British colonisation (see "gostan" and "outstation" below).

==Malaysian English and Manglish==

Manglish is considered to be a less-educated form of [[Malaysian English]] used highly informally by the locals which has features of a  [[pidgin]] or a [[Creole language|creole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=juAzDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13 |title=English in Malaysia: Current Use and Status|editor= Toshiko Yamaguchi, David Deterding |page=13 |isbn=9789004314306 |publisher=Brill |date=7 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="star"/&gt; While all varieties of English used by Malaysian may be considered Malaysian English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ngPPJtDJ3gwC&amp;pg=PT70&amp;lpg=PT70#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=English in Southeast Asia: Features, Policy and Language in Use|editors= Ee Ling Low, Azirah Hashim |page=56 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |date=24 January 2012|isbn= 978-9027249029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; some make a distinction between Malaysian English and Manglish; Malaysian English being a form of English that largely follows the standard rules of English grammar but with some local characteristics, while Manglish is a pidgin that does not follow the grammatical rules or structure of English.&lt;ref name="star"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/viewpoints/mind-our-english/2011/10/14/primer-on-manglish/ |title= Primer on Manglish |author=Lim Chin Lam |work= The Star |date= 14 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Malaysians however tend to refer to the colloquialisms used by thse taught in English-medium school as Malaysian English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t2yNAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32 |title=The Routledge concise history of Southeast Asian writing in English|authors= Rajeev Shridhar Patke, Philip Holden |page=32|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some argued for basilect form or the pidgin as as the "real" Malaysian English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/viewpoints/mind-our-english/2013/10/08/just-dont-call-it-manglish/ |title= Just don't call it Manglish! | author=Alistair King|work=The Star |date=8 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the lexical level, limited [[Lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] is used and consequently, a number of words serve a variety of functions, giving extended meanings not normally accepted in standard British English.

There are some differences of contemporary words used between Malaysia and the United Kingdom. The use of Manglish is discouraged at schools, where only Malaysian Standard English is taught.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wOTcr9mrtEUC&amp;pg=PA389&amp;dq=manglish&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=C7L9TpjYGYSyrAeLzcT9Dw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=manglish&amp;f=false The Handbook of Business Discourse, By Francesca Bargiela-Chiappini]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Malaysian English is not used in any official context except for the ever-changing school curriculum modules in attempts to improve the command of English but without going into advanced lessons. Call it English 112, English for Primary Students, Malaysian English, Conversational English etc. but "Malaysian English" is not an official dialect of English.{{According to whom|date=September 2018}} 

It is however, possible to speak Manglish without substituting English words with that from another language.

==Derive influences==
Speakers of Manglish from the country's different ethnic groups tend to intersperse varying amounts of expressions or interjections from their mother tongue – be it [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or one of the  [[Languages of India|Indian]] languages – which, in some cases, qualifies as a form of [[code-switching]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Verbs or adjectives from other languages often have English [[affix]]es, and conversely sentences may be constructed using English words in another language's syntax. People tend to translate phrases directly from their first languages into English, for instance, "on the light" instead of "''turn'' on the light". Or sometimes, "open the light", translated directly from Chinese.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Words and grammar==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}

===Nouns===
*"outstation" – out of town (e.g., going ''outstation'').
*"terrer" – (pronounced as the English "terror") Refers to someone or something being awesomely amazing or good (e.g., "Bloody hell, that guy is ''terrer!''").
*"chop" – stamp (also used as verb). From Malay 'cop' meaning stamp e.g. "Put your company chop on the receipt".
*"dollar" – a loaned currency used especially in vis-à-vis business transactions in lieu of "ringgit" (as in Ringgit Malaysia).

===Adjectives===
*"action/askyen/eksyen" – show-offy (due to confusion of the usage of the Malay word "berlagak", which can either mean "show off" or "to act")
*"aiksy/lan si" – arrogant, overconfident.  'Aiksy' possibly derived from 'acting up'; 'lan si' is of Cantonese origin and is considered rude by some. 
*"blur" – confused, out-of-it. Roughly equivalent to "spacey" in [[American-English|American slang]].
*"chop" – stamp (of approval). (Due to confusion of the usage of the Malay word "cap". [E.g. I got the chop for my letter from the office lah.])
*"cincai" – casually, simply, doing things as one pleases. e.g. "I just cincai order a dish from the menu."
*"geram" – angry, greatly annoyed, irritated, pissed off. Origins from Malay language. e.g. "Eh look at his attitude lah, geram only!"
*"la-la" – flashy, gaudy appearance. "La-la" replaces the older derogatory term "Ah Lien" that is used to describe girls who wear heavy make-up and outstanding clothes and accessories, which usually end up being rather bad taste instead of looking sophisticated or in fashion. They also usually sport brightly coloured hair. "La-la" can also be used to describe the things these girls are known to wear. E.g. "That salegirl was very la-la"/"The clothes are so la-la." These days, the term is also used to describe guys who sports outstanding/bizarre hairstyle and wear outstanding clothes and accessories resulting in bad taste as well. "la-la zai" and "la-la mui" is commonly used to make distinctions between the genders, with the former referring to guys and the latter referring to girls. The "la-la's" also feature rather punkish attitudes.
*"pai-seh" – ashamed, embarrassed/embarrassing. 'pai-seh' is of Hokkien origin [E.g.: I kena punish lah... very pai-seh eh!].
*"slumber" – relaxed, laid-back; possibly a conflation of the Malay "selamba", meaning nonchalant, and the English "slumber".
*"sup-sup sui" – very easy. 'Sup-sup sui' is of Cantonese origin.

===Adverbs===
*"sibeh" – very, extremely. Hokkienised for "super". Used when wanting to put an emphasis on something saying it is great or big -- whether it is in a good or bad way does not matter as long as it is "huge" e.g. : "That guy is sibeh annoying lo."

===Verbs===
*"cabut/cantas" – to run off, flee or to escape ('Cabut' is a Malay word meaning to pull or pulling out as a [[transitive verb]], or to become detached as an [[intransitive verb]].)
*"gostan" – reverse a vehicle, apparently from the [[nautical term]] "go astern" (mostly used in Terengganu, Kelantan, Kedah and Penang) or "go stunt". Sometimes also expressed as "gostan balik" (lit., ''reverse back'').
*"jadi" – happened, succeeded (derived from the Malay word 'jadi', and may sometimes mean 'so' as in, "''Jadi?''" = "So what?")
*"jalan" – to walk (Malay)
*"kacau" – to disturb (Malay) e.g.: Please don't kacau me.
*"kantoi" – to get caught ("I kena ''kantoi''..." means, "I got shafted/reprimanded/caught")
*"kena" – to get caught/punished; often used like a noun ("I sure ''kena'' if I cheat"). From the Malay passive verb "kena".
*"kill" – to punish/scold/cause trouble to someone ("If you're not careful ah, this guy will ''kill'' you")
*"makan" – to eat (Malay), often refer to lunch or dinner (Malay) (e.g. "You makan dy?" means "Have you taken your dinner/lunch?")
*"makan" – Take a bet (e.g. "I makan 1/2 biji on Manchester United" means "I bet 1/2 handicap on Manchester United")
*"mempersiasuikan" - to embarrass (''"mem...per...kan"'' derived from Malay grammar and ''"siasui"'' means shame in Hokkien)
*"minum" – to drink (Malay)
*"on/off" – to ''turn'' something on or off, respectively (e.g. "Don't forget to ''off'' the fan.")
*"pengsan" – to faint (Malay)
*"pon" – to skip school/play truant/apon (from Malay "ponteng", meaning the same)
*"saman" – to issue a fine, usually in relation to a traffic offence, from "[[summons]]".
*"siam" – to avoid (e.g. "Boss is coming. I siam first.")
*"sit" – since this is the word used for riding in a vehicle in Malay and in Chinese dialects, it is used in the same way in English, e.g. "''sit'' bus"
*"wo hen baite" – to be white
*"tahan" – to stand, to bear ("Cannot tahan her perfume! So strong!"). From Malay "tahan", to endure, to withstand.
*"tumpang-ing" – riding in someone else's vehicle or lodging at someone else's house, from the [[Malay language|Malay]] verb "''tumpang''" + "-ing"
*"mamak" / "mamak stall" – from the term mamak (a slang for Indian or Indian Muslims), it is used to refer to Indian Muslim restaurants in Malaysia. Example: let's go eat at a ''mamak'' lah.
*"yam-cha" – socializing with friends usually in "[[mamak stalls]]", but other places also apply. Generally identifies with "go have a drink". Derived from the "[[Yum Cha]]" used in Cantonese.
*"lempang" – literally "bash", it usually refers to a slap. Example: He can ''lempang'' your face.
*(any Malay word) + "ing" – doing a certain action ("''Tengah makan''" or "I'm eating right now" is shortened to "''Makan-ing' and "He's the one cheating me!" equates to 'He's d one dat tipu-ing me leh..' ")
*"Kow-kow" / "Kow kow" / "Kowkow" / "kaukau" – (pron: Kao-kao) used to stress a personal satisfaction on a specific action specified before. The stress can be due to shock, anger, pain, or pleasure. Example: He got it kow kow ("He got it badly")

===Interjections===
*"Alamak" – exclamation of surprise or shock. (E.g. "Alamak!" ''(Oh no!)''). From the [[Malay language|Malay]] exclamation 'alamak'
*"Wei" – exclamation when conversing to a close friend, or used as "hello" when answering phone (from [[Chinese character]] 喂, "wei")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=worddict&amp;wdrst=0&amp;wdqb=%E5%96%82 |title=喂 |work=MDBG }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Best/syok/shiok" – indicates the object as superlatively good. "''Syok''" or "''shiok''" is from the [[Min Nan|Hokkien]] word for pleasure. (syok is also a chain of [[Novelties|novelty]] shops, although it could also be possible that the word stems from the English word "shock" in the context of seeing something shocking).''
*"Bo jio" –  indicates the lack of invitation in Hokkien. The usage is to annoy friends or families when they have a fun time than the speaker.
*"Die/Finish/Gone/Habis/Mampus/Mampui/Sei/See/GG/Pok kai/" – generic exclamations to indicate "trouble", used like the English "dead" or "dead end" – "''sei''" is usually pronounced as its [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] equivalent, "die". (E.g. Today he ''die'' because of that [[loan shark]] ''(Today, he is in trouble because of the [[loan sharks]]. The word "die" does not mean to die literally)''). 
*"Cehwah/Huiyooh/Fuyoh/Fulamak/Aiseh" – exclamation of amazement/wonder/marvel. (E.g. Fuyoooh, his hair so [[jinjang]]!)
*"Jinjang" – a term to explain one's appearance, being out of fashion or old-fashioned. Sometimes it is used to refer to people who act rudely or uncivilized in public. (''[[Jinjang]] is also a sub-urban town in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia''). (E.g. The guys over there are so ''jinjang''!).
*"Kanasai" – "Like Shit" in Hokkien
*"Walao eh"  – also an exclamation of amazement similar to Korean Hul~(usually Chinese)
*"Giler Ah!" – exclamation of shock or amazement. From the [[Malay language|Malay]] word 'gila' which means mad or crazy.
*"Izzit?" – expression of mild unbelief. ("Really? ", basically, "Is it?").
*"Watodo" – rhetorical question (Example, "It has already happened. What can we do?").
*"Podaa!" – from Tamil equivalent to the American phrase, "Get out!" when expressing disbelief
*"Abuden?" – Combination of [[Min Nan|Hokkien]] "A-bo", meaning "if not" in English, and the word "then". It is also equivalent to simply saying "Obviously". Usually used a sarcastic response to an obvious observation or question.
*"Deyh!" – meaning bro. Borrowed from Tamil.

===Grammar===
*"(Subject + predicate), is it?" – this is often used as a question. "It" doesn't refer to the subject, but rather to the entire preceding clause ("Is it so?") This is comparable to the French phrase "n'est-ce pas?" (literally "isn't it?") and the German usage of "..., oder?" (literally "..., or?")

===Phrases===
*"Open collar, pocket no dollar" – expression reflecting linkage between extravagant appearance and persona, and illusion of wealth

==The "Lah" word==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
The ubiquitous word lah ({{IPA-endia|lɑ́|}} or {{IPA|[lɑ̂]}}), used at the end of a sentence, can also be described as a particle that simultaneously asserts a position and entices solidarity.

Note that 'lah' is often written after a space for clarity, but there is never a pause before it. This is because originally in Malay, 'lah' is appended to the end of the word and is not a separate word by itself.

In Malay, 'lah' is used to change a verb into a command or to soften its tone, particularly when usage of the verb may seem impolite. For example, "to drink" is "minum", but "Here, drink!" is "minumlah". Similarly, 'lah' is frequently used with imperatives in Singlish, such as the command, "Drink lah!" (Come on, drink!).&lt;ref name=LimPrimer&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lim|first1=Chin Lam|title=Primer on Manglish|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Lifestyle/Viewpoints/Mind-Our-English/Profile/Articles/2011/10/14/Primer-on-Manglish/|accessdate=5 January 2015|publisher=The Star|date=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Lah' also occurs frequently with "Yah" and "No" (hence "Yah lah" and "No lah"), resulting in a less brusque sound, thus facilitating the flow of conversation. This form is more used by Chinese in Malaysia.

It is also possible that Lah comes from Cantonese. In Cantonese, [[:wikt:啦|Lah]] is placed at the end of a sentence in imperatives making it sound more like a request than an order.

It might have Tamil origin as well. Lah is still used widely in Southern Tamil Nadu (Thirunelveli, Kanyakumari district) in the same manner. Tamil is said to be more pure in this region than northern Tamil Nadu and had ancient trade link with south east Asia.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.asiaoceania.org/pdf/BG/57-OBG-M220.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211033522/http://www.asiaoceania.org/pdf/BG/57-OBG-M220.pdf |archivedate=2006-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lah is often used with brusque, short, negative responses:
*Don't have lah! (Brusque response to, "Lend me some money, can?")
*Don't know already lah! (Brusque response to someone fumbling with an explanation. Mostly by Chinese.)

Lah is also used for reassurance:
*Don't worry, he can do it one lah – Don't worry, he can get it done.
*It's okay lah – It's all right.

Lah can also be used to emphasize items in a spoken list, appearing after each item in the list but is not commonly used in this context. 
*They got sell Nasi Lemak lah, Roti Canai lah, Chapatti lah; Everything got lah!

Although lah can appear nearly anywhere, it cannot appear with a [[yes-no question]]. Another particle should be used instead. For example:
*Where are you ar? (This is especially of Chinese origin.)&lt;ref name=LimPrimer /&gt;

The Chinese influence in Manglish, however, can be seen among other races in Malaysia, especially when conversing with Chinese-speaking people. This principle can be generally applied to all forms of non-standard English spoken in Malaysia.

=="Loh"==
'Loh' or 'lo' is used in the same context as "lah". It serves as a final particle to intensify a decision that is definitive and irrevocable.

In most cases, loh is used in direct response to a question or query with the connotation that the respondent is somewhat impatient or annoying because the person thinks that the answer is so obvious that the question should not have been raised from the start. In fact, the questioner might have no idea beforehand about the rude reply that would be shot back to him/her, though it can be argued that the word 'lah' might deliver stronger emotions from the speaker.

For example, to show argumentative mood or making emphasis, one would say, "You lo (it's your fault), if it's not for you we wouldn't be in trouble now!" and possibly in response, the other would say, "Eh, I never forced you to follow me here loh!" Another example is "traffic jam loh!" when asked by a friend why he or she is late to an occasion. 

Sometimes, loh is used to express insincerity while speaking, for instance when one says "sorry loh" or "thank you loh".

However, in some cases, the use of loh is only intended to give an advice without any notion of impatience. Examples: "I think he’s being unreasonable loh" or "if you ask you will know loh".

In lesser cases, using "loh" can make some emphasis or convey a jovial atmosphere. For example, "I came all the way for you loh" and "Nah, that one loh, that fat chubby one in a yellow shirt loh". 

"Loh" is mostly used by the Chinese community in Malaysia, because of its Cantonese origin.

==Meh==

"Meh" is also a common ubiquitous word that used at the end of a question. It is usually used with a sense of confidence in his or her own statement but the hint of doubt towards the other person. For example," I like her, can not meh?" (meaning "I like her. What's wrong with that?").

"Meh" is of Cantonese origin. In Cantonese or Hakka, "meh" is a final particle that transforms statements into questions that indicate doubt or surprise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cantonese.sheik.co.uk/dictionary/characters/563/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==What==
The particle what {{IPA-endia|wɑ̀t|}}, also spelled wat/wot, is used to remind or contradict the listener, especially when strengthening another assertion that follows from the current one:

==Miscellaneous==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
"There is"/"there are" and "has"/"have" are both expressed using got, so that sentences can be translated in either way back into British / American English. This is equivalent to the Chinese 有 yǒu (to have):
*''Got question?'' – Is there a question? / Do you have a question?
*''Yesterday ar, East Coast Park got so many people!'' – There were so many people at East Coast Park yesterday. / East Coast Park had so many people [there] yesterday.
*''This bus got air-con or not?'' – Is there air-conditioning on this bus? / Does this bus have air-conditioning?
*''Where got!?'' – lit. Where is there [this]?, also more loosely, What are you talking about? or Where did you get that idea?; generic response to any accusation. Derived from Malay sentence "Mana ada" – 'Mana' (Where) 'ada' (got) and also from Chinese sentence "哪里有" – '哪里' (Where) '有' (got).

Can is used extensively as both a question particle and an answer particle. The negative is cannot:
*''Gimme lah, ok or not?'' – (Give it to me, OK?)
*''Can!'' – (Sure!)
*''Can!'' – (Yes, that is possible)
*''Cannot.'' – (No way.)

==Comparing to Singlish==
Manglish and Singlish share a common history and some common characteristics. The difference between Manglish and [[Singlish]] can be subtle and sometimes difficult to be distinguish even among the locals. However, Manglish is markedly more influenced by the Malay language, with the majority population in [[Malaysia]] being the [[Ethnic Malays]]; while Singlish is more influenced by [[Hokkien dialect]] or [[Mandarin Chinese]], with the majority population being the [[Han Chinese|Ethnic Chinese]]. For example, "kena" (a Malay word, somewhat of a prefix added for the sake of turning an action verb into passive form) might be more often used in Manglish; while Singlish more frequently uses words like "liao" (meaning "already" in Hokkien), "nia" (meaning "only" in Hokkien). However, referring the aforementioned example, "kena" is also used in Singlish and "liao" in Mangish, only to a less extent. This shows the huge influences on these two languages on each other as well. There is virtually no difference between the two when heard from foreigner's ears.

==Other usage==
{{Globalize|date=June 2013}}
*The word 'Manglish' is also used to describe the English spoken by [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] speakers from the [[Kerala]] state in [[India]] having a Malayalam accent, mainly by those who have studied in Malayalam-medium schools. This is also propagated by Malayalam media.
*Manglish ([[manga]] in English) is also the name of an interactive cartoon feature in the ''[[Mainichi Daily News]]'', Japan's major English-language online newspaper. Manga, or Japanese comics, are displayed on the Web site in their original format, but English translations of the Japanese characters can be seen by mousing over the [[speech balloons]].

A '''matrix grammar''' is a [[formal grammar]] in which instead of single productions, productions are grouped together into finite sequences. A production cannot be applied separately, it must be applied in sequence. In the application of such a sequence of productions, the rewriting is done in accordance to each production in sequence, the first one, second one etc. till the last production has been used for rewriting. The sequences are referred to as '''matrices'''.

Matrix grammar is an extension of [[context-free grammar]], and one instance of a [[controlled grammar]].

== Formal definition ==
A ''matrix grammar'' is an ordered quadruple

:&lt;math&gt;G = (V_N, V_T, X_0, M).&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;V_N&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of non-terminals
* &lt;math&gt;V_T&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of terminals
* &lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt; is a special element of &lt;math&gt;V_N&lt;/math&gt;, viz. the starting symbol
* &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of non-empty sequences whose elements are ordered pairs

:&lt;math&gt;(P, Q), \quad P \in W(V) V_N W(V), \quad Q \in W(V), \quad V = V_N \cup V_T.&lt;/math&gt;

The pairs are called ''productions'', written as &lt;math&gt;P \to Q&lt;/math&gt;. The sequences are called ''matrices'' and can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;m = [P_1 \to Q_1, \ldots, P_r \to Q_r].&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all productions appearing in the matrices &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; of a matrix grammar &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then the matrix grammar &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is of type-&lt;math&gt;i, i = 0, 1, 2, 3&lt;/math&gt;, ''length-increasing'', ''linear'', ''&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-free'', ''context-free'' or ''context-sensitive'' if and only if the grammar &lt;math&gt;G_1 = (V_N, V_T, X_0, F)&lt;/math&gt; has the following property.

For a matrix grammar &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, a binary relation &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow_G&lt;/math&gt; is defined; also represented as &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;. For any &lt;math&gt;P, Q \in W(V)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; holds if and only if there exists an integer &lt;math&gt;r \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; such that the words

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_1,, \ldots, \alpha_{r + 1}, \quad P_1, \ldots, P_r, \quad R_1, \ldots, R_r, \quad, R^1, \ldots, R^r&lt;/math&gt;

over V exist and
* &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i = P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{r + 1} = Q&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is one of the matrices of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i = R_i P_i R^i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{i + 1} = R_i Q_i R^i.&lt;/math&gt;

If the above conditions are satisfied, it is also said that &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; holds with &lt;math&gt;(m, R_1)&lt;/math&gt; as the ''specifications''.

Let &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow^{*}&lt;/math&gt; be the reflexive transitive closure of the relation &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the language generated by the matrix grammar &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;L(G) = \{P \in W(V_T) | X_0 \Rightarrow^{*} P\}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==
Consider the matrix grammar

&lt;math&gt;G = (\{S, X, Y\}, \{a, b, c\}, S, M)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a collection containing the following matrices:

&lt;math&gt;
m_0 : [S \rightarrow XY], \quad 
m_1 : [X \rightarrow aXb, Y \rightarrow cY], \quad 
m_2 : [X \rightarrow ab, Y \rightarrow c]
&lt;/math&gt;

These matrices, which contain only ''context-free'' rules, generate the ''context-sensitive'' language

&lt;math&gt;L = \{a^nb^nc^n|n \ge 1\}.&lt;/math&gt;
The associate word of 
&lt;math&gt;a^nb^nc^n &lt;/math&gt;
is
&lt;math&gt;Aw(a^nb^nc^n) = m_0m^{n-2}_1m_2 , \forall n \geq 2&lt;/math&gt; and 
&lt;math&gt;
Aw(abc) = m_0m_2
&lt;/math&gt;.

This example can be found on pages 8 and 9 of {{ref|Abraham1965}} in the following form:
Consider the matrix grammar

&lt;math&gt;G = (\{S, X, Y, Z\}, \{a, b, c\}, S, M)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a collection containing the following matrices:

&lt;math&gt;
m_0 : [S \rightarrow abc],  \quad 
m_1 : [S \rightarrow aXbYcZ],  \quad 
m_2 : [X \rightarrow aX, Y \rightarrow bY, Z \rightarrow cZ],  \quad 
m_3 : [X \rightarrow ab, Y \rightarrow b,  Z \rightarrow c]
&lt;/math&gt;

These matrices, which contain only ''context-regular'' rules, generate the ''context-sensitive'' language

&lt;math&gt;L = \{a^nb^nc^n|n \ge 1\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The associate word of 
&lt;math&gt;a^nb^nc^n &lt;/math&gt;
is
&lt;math&gt;Aw(a^nb^nc^n) = m_1m^{n-2}_2m_3 , \forall n \geq 2&lt;/math&gt; and 
&lt;math&gt;
Aw(abc) = m_0
&lt;/math&gt;.

== Properties ==
Let &lt;chem&gt;MAT^\lambda&lt;/chem&gt; be the class of languages produced by matrix grammars, and {{math|MAT}} the class of languages produced by &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-free matrix grammars.
* Trivially, {{math|MAT}} is included in &lt;chem&gt;MAT^\lambda&lt;/chem&gt;.
* All [[context-free languages]] are in {{math|MAT}}, and all languages in &lt;chem&gt;MAT^\lambda&lt;/chem&gt; are [[recursively enumerable]].
* {{math|MAT}} is closed under [[Union (set theory)|union]], [[concatenation]], [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] with regular languages and permutation.
* All languages in {{math|MAT}} can be produced by a [[context-sensitive grammar]].
* There exists a context-sensitive language which does not belong to &lt;chem&gt;MAT^\lambda&lt;/chem&gt; {{ref|Paun}}.
* Each language produced by a matrix grammar with only one terminal symbol is regular.

== Open problems ==
It is not known whether there exist languages in &lt;chem&gt;MAT^\lambda&lt;/chem&gt; which are not in {{math|MAT}}, and it is neither known whether &lt;chem&gt;MAT^\lambda&lt;/chem&gt; contains languages which are not context-sensitive {{ref|Paun}}.

The syllable ''Om'' is first mentioned in the [[Upanishads]], the mystical texts associated with  the [[Vedanta]] philosophy.
It has variously been associated with concepts of  "cosmic sound" or "mystical syllable" or "affirmation to something divine", or as symbolism for abstract spiritual concepts in the Upanishads.&lt;ref name=annette /&gt;
In the [[Aranyaka]] and the [[Brahmana]] layers of Vedic texts, the syllable is so widespread and linked to knowledge, that it stands for the "whole of Veda".&lt;ref name=annette /&gt;
The etymological foundations of ''Om'' are repeatedly discussed in the oldest layers of the Vedantic texts (the early Upanishads).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, page 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Grimes (1995), Ganapati: The Song of Self, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791424391}}, pages 78-80 and 201 footnote 34&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aitareya Brahmana]] of Rig Veda, in section 5.32, for example suggests that the three phonetic components of ''Om'' (pronounced ''AUM'') correspond to the three stages of cosmic creation, and when it is read or said, it celebrates the creative powers of the universe.&lt;ref name=annette /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/vedas/aitereya/the_aitareya_brahmanam_of_the_rigveda__s.pdf Aitareya Brahmana 5.32], Rig Veda, pages 139-140 (Sanskrit); for English translation: See {{cite book|author=Arthur Berriedale Keith|title=The Aitareya and Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇas of the Rigveda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSgYAAAAYAAJ |year=1920|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brahmana layer of Vedic texts equate ''Om'' with ''Bhur-bhuvah-Svah'', the latter symbolizing "the whole Veda". They offer various shades of meaning to ''Om'', such as it being "the universe beyond the sun", or that which is "mysterious and inexhaustible", or "the infinite language, the infinite knowledge", or "essence of breath, life, everything that exists", or that "with which one is liberated".&lt;ref name=annette /&gt; The [[Samaveda|Sama Veda]], the poetical Veda, orthographically maps ''Om'' to the audible, the musical truths in its numerous variations (''Oum'', ''Aum'', ''Ovā Ovā Ovā Um'', etc.) and then attempts to extract musical meters from it.&lt;ref name=annette /&gt;

The syllable ''Om'' evolves to mean many abstract ideas in the earliest Upanishads. [[Max Müller]] and other scholars state that these philosophical texts recommend ''Om'' as a "tool for meditation", explain various meanings that the syllable may be in the mind of one meditating, ranging from "artificial and senseless" to "highest concepts such as the cause of the Universe, essence of life, Brahman, Atman, and Self-knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/n111/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], Oxford University Press, pages 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deussenmeaningofom&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 67-85, 227, 284, 308, 318, 361-366, 468, 600-601, 667, 772&lt;/ref&gt;

== Written representation ==
[[Phonological]]ly, the syllable ओम्  represents {{IPA|/aum/}}, which is regularly [[monophthong]]ised to {{IPA|[õː]}} in [[Sanskrit phonology]]. When occurring within spoken Sanskrit, the syllable is subject to the normal rules of [[sandhi]] in [[Sanskrit grammar]], however with the additional peculiarity that after preceding ''a'' or ''ā'', the ''au'' of ''aum''  does not form [[vriddhi]] (''au'') but [[guna]] (''o'') per [[Pāṇini]] 6.1.95 (i.e. 'om').
It is sometimes  also written ओ३म् (''ō̄m'' {{IPA-sa|õːːm|}}), notably by [[Arya Samaj]], where ३ (i.e., the digit "3") is ''[[Pluti|pluta]]'' ("three times as long"), [[pluti|indicating a length]] of three [[morae]] (that is, the time it takes to say three syllables) — an [[vowel length|overlong]] [[nasalised]] [[close-mid back rounded vowel]].

The ''Om'' symbol [[File:Aum.svg|20px]]  is a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] in [[Devanagari]], combining ओ (''{{IAST|au}}'') and [[chandrabindu]] ([[ँ]], ''{{IAST|ṃ}}''). In  [[Unicode]], the symbol is encoded at {{unichar|0950|Devanagari OM}} and at {{unichar|1f549|OM Symbol}} ("generic symbol independent of Devanagari font").

The ''Om'' or ''Aum'' symbol is found on ancient coins, in regional scripts. In [[Sri Lanka]], [[Anuradhapura Kingdom|Anuradhapura era]] coins (dated from the 1st to 4th centuries) are embossed with ''Aum'' along with other symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Parker, ''Ancient Ceylon''  (1909), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=Nk8xpkY0bqEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA490 p. 490].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Nagari]] or [[Devanagari]] representations are found epigraphically on medieval sculpture, such as   the [[dancing Shiva]] (ca. 10th to 12th century); [[Joseph Campbell]] (1949) even argued that the dance posture itself can be taken to  represent ''AUM'' as a symbol  of the entirety of "consciousness, universe" and "the message that God is within a person and without".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell (1949), ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', 108f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Om'' symbol, with [[epigraphic]]al variations, is also found in many [[southeast Asia]]n countries. For example, it is called ''Unalom'' or ''Aum'' in [[Thailand]] and has been a part of various flags and official emblems such as in the [[Royal Standard of Thailand#Fourth reign|Thong Chom Klao]] of [[Mongkut|King Rama IV]] (r. 1851–1868).&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Wong (2001), ''Sounding the Center: History and Aesthetics in Thai Buddhist Performance'', [[University of Chicago Press]], {{ISBN|978-0226905853}}, page 292&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Cambodia]]n official seal has similarly incorporated the ''Aum'' symbol.&lt;ref&gt;James Minahan (2009), ''The Complete Guide to National Symbols and Emblems'', {{ISBN|978-0313344961}}, pages 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[traditional Chinese characters]], it is written as [[:wikt:唵|唵]] ([[pinyin]] – ǎn), and as [[:wikt:嗡|嗡]] (pinyin – wēng) in [[simplified Chinese characters]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

There have been proposals that the ''Om'' syllable may already have had written representations in [[Brahmi script]], dating to before the Common Era. A proposal by Deb (1848) held that the ''[[swastika]]'' is "a [[monogram]]matic representation of the syllable Om, wherein two Brahmi /o/ characters ({{unichar|11011|Brahmi letter O}}) were superposed crosswise and the 'm' was represented by dot".&lt;ref&gt;HK Deb, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, Volume XVII, Number 3, page 137&lt;/ref&gt; A commentary in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' considers this theory questionable and unproven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|1bMzAQAAMAAJ|The Swastika|page=PA365}}, Nature, Vol. 110, No. 2758, page 365&lt;/ref&gt;
Roy (2011) proposed  that ''Om'' was represented using the Brahmi symbols for "A", "U" and "M" (&amp;#x11005;&amp;thinsp;&amp;#x11009;&amp;thinsp;&amp;#x1102b;), and that this may have influenced the unusual [[epigraphic]]al features of the symbol {{large|ॐ}} for ''Om''.&lt;ref&gt;Ankita Roy (2011), ''[http://www.mrane.com/images/bramhi.pdf Rediscovering the Brahmi Script]''.

[[File:Om Symbol at Kanaka Durga Temple.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Om Symbol at Kanaka Durga Temple, Vijayawada]]
''Om'' came to be used as a standard utterance at the beginning of [[mantra]]s, chants or citations taken from the  [[Veda]]s. For example, the  [[Gayatri mantra]], which consists of a verse from the [[Rigveda]] Samhita ([[Mandala 3|RV 3]].62.10), is prefixed not just by ''Om'' but by ''Om'' followed by the formula '' bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ''.&lt;ref name=mmwpage17&gt;Monier Monier-Williams (1893), Indian Wisdom, Luzac &amp; Co., London, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; Such recitations continue to be in use in Hinduism, with many major incantations and ceremonial functions beginning and ending with ''Om''.&lt;ref name=lipner /&gt;
[[Swami Maheshwarananda|Maheshwarananda]] (2002) suggests that the Om reflects the cosmological beliefs in Hinduism, as the primordial sound associated with the creation of universe from nothing.&lt;ref name=Mahesh&gt;Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda, ''The hidden power in humans'', Ibera Verlag (2002), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Upanishads ===
The syllable "Om" is described with various meanings in  the [[Upanishads]]. Descriptions include "the sacred sound, the Yes!, the Vedas, the ''Udgitha'' (song of the universe), the infinite, the all encompassing, the whole world, the truth, the ultimate reality, the finest essence, the cause of the Universe, the essence of life, the [[Brahman]], the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], the vehicle of deepest knowledge, and Self-knowledge".&lt;ref name=deussenmeaningofom /&gt;

The [[Chandogya Upanishad]] is one of the oldest Upanishads of Hinduism. It opens with the recommendation that "let a man meditate on Om".&lt;ref name=maxmuller11&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/n111/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], The Upanishads, Part I, Oxford University Press, pages 1-3 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; It calls the syllable Om as ''udgitha'' (उद्गीथ, song, chant), and asserts that the significance of the syllable is thus: the essence of all beings is earth, the essence of earth is water, the essence of water are the plants, the essence of plants is man, the essence of man is speech, the essence of speech is the [[Rig Veda]], the essence of the Rig Veda is the Sama Veda, and the essence of Sama Veda is the ''udgitha'' (song, ''Om'').&lt;ref name=pauldeussen11 /&gt;

''Rik'' (ऋच्, Ṛc) is speech, states the text, and ''Sāman'' (सामन्) is breath; they are pairs, and because they have love for each other, speech and breath find themselves together and mate to produce a song.&lt;ref name=maxmuller11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pauldeussen11 /&gt; The highest song is Om, asserts section 1.1 of Chandogya Upanishad. It is the symbol of awe, of reverence, of threefold knowledge because ''Adhvaryu'' invokes it, the ''Hotr'' recites it, and ''Udgatr'' sings it.&lt;ref name=pauldeussen11&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 68-70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Patrick Olivelle 2014 page 171-185"&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2014), The Early Upanishads, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195124354}}, page 171-185&lt;/ref&gt;

The second volume of the first chapter continues its discussion of syllable ''Om'', explaining its use as a struggle between ''Devas'' (gods) and ''Asuras'' (demons).&lt;ref name=pauldeussen12&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 70-71 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; Max Muller states that this struggle between gods and demons is considered allegorical by ancient [[Indian people|Indian]] scholars, as good and evil inclinations within man, respectively.&lt;ref name=maxmuller12&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/n111/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], The Upanishads, Part I, Oxford University Press, pages 4-6 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; The legend in section 1.2 of Chandogya Upanishad states that gods took the ''Udgitha'' (song of ''Om'') unto themselves, thinking, "with this ''song'' we shall overcome the demons".&lt;ref name=hume12&gt;Robert Hume, [https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n199/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], The Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 178-180&lt;/ref&gt; The syllable ''Om'' is thus implied as that which inspires the good inclinations within each person.&lt;ref name=maxmuller12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=hume12 /&gt;

Chandogya Upanishad's exposition of syllable ''Om'' in its opening chapter combines etymological speculations, symbolism, metric structure and philosophical themes.&lt;ref name="Patrick Olivelle 2014 page 171-185" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/n111/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], The Upanishads, Part I, Oxford University Press, pages 4-19 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; In the second chapter of the Chandogya Upanishad, the meaning and significance of ''Om'' evolves into a philosophical discourse, such as in section 2.10 where ''Om'' is linked to the Highest Self,&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/n139/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], The Upanishads, Part I, Oxford University Press, page 28 with footnote 1&lt;/ref&gt; and section 2.23 where the text asserts ''Om'' is the essence of three forms of knowledge, ''Om'' is [[Brahman]] and "Om is all this [observed world]".&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/34/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad], The Upanishads, Part I, Oxford University Press, page 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Katho Upanishad ====
The Katho Upanishad is the legendary story of a little boy, [[Nachiketa]] – the son of sage Vajasravasa – who meets [[Yama]], the Indian deity of death.

The three roots of the syllable, states the Maitri Upanishad, are ''A'' + ''U'' + ''M''.&lt;ref name=maxmuller64&gt;Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 2, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads02ml#page/306/mode/2up Maitrayana-Brahmana Upanishad], Oxford University Press, pages 307-308&lt;/ref&gt; The sound is the body of Soul, and it repeatedly manifests in three: as gender-endowed body – feminine, masculine, neuter; as light-endowed body – [[Agni]], [[Vayu]] and [[Aditya]]; as deity-endowed body – Brahma, Rudra{{efn|later called as Shiva}} and Vishnu; as mouth-endowed body – Garhapatya, Dakshinagni and Ahavaniya;&lt;ref&gt;this is a reference to the three major Vedic fire rituals&lt;/ref&gt; as knowledge-endowed body – Rig, Saman and Yajur;&lt;ref&gt;this is a reference to the three major [[Vedas]]&lt;/ref&gt; as world-endowed body – Bhūr, Bhuvaḥ and Svaḥ; as time-endowed body – Past, Present and Future; as heat-endowed body – Breath, Fire and Sun; as growth-endowed body – Food, Water and Moon; as thought-endowed body – intellect, mind and psyche.&lt;ref name=maxmuller64 /&gt;&lt;ref name=cowell64&gt;[https://www.shemtaia.com/SKT/PDF/Upanishads/cowellmaitriskt.pdf Maitri Upanishad – Sanskrit Text with English Translation]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} EB Cowell (Translator), Cambridge University, Bibliotheca Indica, page 258-260&lt;/ref&gt; Brahman exists in two forms – the material form, and the immaterial formless.&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 2, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads02ml#page/306/mode/2up Maitrayana-Brahmana Upanishad], Oxford University Press, pages 306-307 verse 6.3&lt;/ref&gt; The material form is changing, unreal.

The world is Om, its light is Sun, and the Sun is also the light of the syllable ''Om'', asserts the Upanishad. Meditating on Om, is acknowledging and meditating on the Brahman-Atman (Soul, Self).&lt;ref name=maxmuller64 /&gt;

==== Mundaka Upanishad ====
The [[Mundaka Upanishad]] in the second ''Mundakam'' (part), suggests the means to knowing the Self and the Brahman to be meditation, self-reflection and introspection, that can be aided by the symbol ''Om''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]] (Translator), Sixty Upanisads of the Veda, Vol 2, Motilal Banarsidass (2010 Reprint), {{ISBN|978-8120814691}}, pages 580-581&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Roer, [https://www.shemtaia.com/SKT/PDF/Upanishads/roermundakaeng.pdf Mundaka Upanishad]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Bibliotheca Indica, Vol. XV, No. 41 and 50, Asiatic Society of Bengal, page 144&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mandukya Upanishad ====
The [[Mandukya Upanishad]] opens by declaring, "Om!, this syllable is this whole world".&lt;ref name=pauldeussenfull /&gt; Thereafter it presents various explanations and theories on what it means and signifies.&lt;ref name=humefull /&gt; This discussion is built on a structure of "four fourths" or "fourfold", derived from ''A'' + ''U'' + ''M'' + "silence" (or without an element).&lt;ref name=pauldeussenfull&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814691}}, pages 605-637&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=humefull&gt;{{citation|first=Robert Ernest|last=Hume|url=https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n411/mode/2up|title=The Thirteen Principal Upanishads|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1921|pages=391–393}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Aum as all states of time'''
:In verse 1, the Upanishad states that time is threefold: the past, the present and the future, that these three are "Aum". The four fourth of time is that which transcends time, that too is "Aum" expressed.&lt;ref name=humefull /&gt;
:'''Aum as all states of Atman'''
:In verse 2, states the Upanishad, everything is Brahman, but Brahman is Atman (the Soul, Self), and that the Atman is fourfold.&lt;ref name=pauldeussenfull /&gt; Johnston summarizes these four states of Self, respectively, as seeking the physical, seeking inner thought, seeking the causes and spiritual consciousness, and the fourth state is realizing oneness with the Self, the Eternal.&lt;ref name=johnston&gt;Charles Johnston, [http://www.universaltheosophy.com/pdf-library/Mandukya%20Upanishad_Johnston.pdf The Measures of the Eternal – Mandukya Upanishad] Theosophical Quarterly, October, 1923, pages 158-162&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Aum as all states of consciousness'''
:In verses 3 to 6, the Mandukya Upanishad enumerates four states of consciousness: wakeful, dream, deep sleep and the state of ''ekatma'' (being one with Self, the oneness of Self).&lt;ref name=humefull /&gt; These four are ''A'' + ''U'' + ''M'' + "without an element" respectively.&lt;ref name=humefull /&gt;
:'''Aum as all of knowledge'''
:In verses 9 to 12, the Mandukya Upanishad enumerates fourfold etymological roots of the syllable "Aum". It states that the first element of "Aum" is ''A'', which is from ''Apti'' (obtaining, reaching) or from ''Adimatva'' (being first).&lt;ref name=pauldeussenfull /&gt; The second element is ''U'', which is from ''Utkarsa'' (exaltation) or from ''Ubhayatva'' (intermediateness).&lt;ref name=humefull /&gt; The third element is ''M'', from ''Miti'' (erecting, constructing) or from ''Mi Minati, or apīti'' (annihilation).&lt;ref name=pauldeussenfull /&gt; The fourth is without an element, without development, beyond the expanse of universe. In this way, states the Upanishad, the syllable Om is indeed the Atman (the self).&lt;ref name=pauldeussenfull /&gt;&lt;ref name=humefull /&gt;

==== Shvetashvatara Upanishad ====
The [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]], in verses 1.14 to 1.16, suggests meditating with the help of syllable ''Om'', where one's perishable body is like one fuel-stick and the syllable ''Om'' is the second fuel-stick, which with discipline and diligent rubbing of the sticks unleashes the concealed fire of thought and awareness within. Such knowledge, asserts the Upanishad, is the goal of Upanishads.&lt;ref name=pauldeussen116&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 308&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Muller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads02ml#page/236/mode/2up Shvetashvatara Upanishad], The Upanishads, Part II, Oxford University Press, page 237&lt;/ref&gt; The text asserts that ''Om'' is a tool of meditation empowering one to know the God within oneself, to realize one's Atman (Soul, Self).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hume (1921), [https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n417/mode/2up Shvetashvatara Upanishad 1.14 – 1.16], The Thirteen Principal Upanishads, Oxford University Press, pages 396-397 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aitareya Aranyaka]] in verse 23.6,{{clarify|date=September 2016}}&lt;!--AA has six books. You need to cite book, chapter and verse--&gt; explains ''Om'' as "an acknowledgment, melodic confirmation, something that gives momentum and energy to a hymn".&lt;ref name=wilke435 /&gt;

=== Bhagavad Gita ===
The [[Bhagavad Gita]], in the Epic [[Mahabharata]], mentions the meaning and significance of ''Om'' in several verses. For example, Fowler notes that verse 9.17 of the Bhagavad Gita synthesizes the competing dualistic and monist streams of thought in Hinduism, by using "''Om'' which is the symbol for the indescribable, impersonal [[Brahman]]".&lt;ref name=jfowler164 /&gt;
{{Quote|

The significance of the sacred syllable in the Hindu traditions, is similarly highlighted in various of its verses, such as verse 17.24 where the importance of ''Om'' during prayers, charity and meditative practices is explained as follows,&lt;ref name=jfowler271 /&gt;
{{Quote|

[[Charles Johnston (Theosophist)|Johnston]] states this verse highlights the importance of ''Om'' in the meditative practice of Yoga, where it symbolizes three worlds in the Soul; the three times – past, present and future eternity, the three divine powers – creation, preservation and transformation in one Being; and three essences in one Spirit – immortality, omniscience and joy. It is, asserts Johnston, a symbol for the perfected Spiritual Man (his emphasis).&lt;ref name=charlesj /&gt;

=== Puranas ===
[[File:Ganesha-aum.jpg|thumb|upright|The Hindu deity [[Ganesha]] is sometimes linked to the symbol ''Om'' and as the symbol for [[Upanishad]]ic concept of Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John A Grimes |title=Ganapati: Song of the Self |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aoqB4n95pSoC |year=1995 |publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-7914-2439-1 |pages=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Alter (2004), Elephas Maximus, Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0143031741}}, page 95&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The medieval era texts of Hinduism, such as the [[Puranas]] adopt and expand the concept of ''Om'' in their own ways, and to their own theistic sects. According to the [[Vayu Purana]], ''Om'' is the representation of the Hindu [[Trimurti]], and represents the union of the three gods, viz. ''A'' for [[Brahma]], ''U'' for [[Vishnu]] and ''M'' for [[Shiva]]. The three sounds also symbolise the three [[Vedas]], namely ([[Rigveda]], [[Samaveda]], [[Yajurveda]]).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The [[Shiva Purana]] highlights the relation between deity [[Shiva]] and the ''Pranava'' or ''Om''. Shiva is declared to be ''Om'', and that ''Om'' is Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Beck (1995), Sonic Theology: Hinduism and Sacred Sound, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812611}}, page 154&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jainism ==
In [[Jainism]], om is considered a condensed form of reference to the [[Pañca-Parameṣṭhi]], by their initials ''A+A+A+U+M'' (''{{IAST|o[[pluti|3]]}}{{IAST|m}}''). The [[Dravyasamgraha]] quotes a [[Prakrit]] line:{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1999|pp=410-411}}
:{{lang|sa|ओम एकाक्षर पञ्चपरमेष्ठिनामादिपम्  तत्कथमिति चेत  "अरिहंता असरीरा आयरिया तह उवज्झाया मुणियां"}}{{efn|''{{IAST|oma ekākṣara pañca-parameṣṭhi-nāmā-dipam tatkathamiti cheta "arihatā asarīrā āyariyā taha uvajjhāyā muṇiyā"}}''}}

:''AAAUM'' (or just "Om") is one syllable short form of the initials of the five parameshthis: "[[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihant]], [[Ashiri]], [[Acharya]], [[Upajjhaya]], [[Jain monasticism|Muni]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/om.html Om – significance in Jainism], Languages and Scripts of India, Colorado State University&lt;/ref&gt;
{{lang|sa|ओं नमः}} ''({{IAST|Oṃ namaḥ}}) Siddhanam'' (6 syllables), ''Om Nhi'' (2 syllables) and just ''Om'' (1 syllable) are the short forms of the Paramesthi-Mantra, also called Namokar Mantra or [[Namokar Mantra|Navkar Mantra]] in Jainism.{{sfn|von Glasenapp|1999|pp=410-411}}

In [[Chinese Buddhism]], ''Om'' is often [[Transliteration|transliterated]] as the [[Chinese character]] {{script|Hant|[[:zh:唵|唵]]}} ([[pinyin]] ''{{lang|pny|ǎn}}'') or {{script|Hant|[[:wikt:嗡|嗡]]}} ([[pinyin]] ''{{lang|pny|wēng}}'').

=== Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayana) ===
In Tibetan [[Buddhism]], ''Om'' is often placed at the beginning of [[mantra]]s and [[dharani]]s. Probably the most well known mantra is "[[Om mani padme hum]]", the six syllable mantra of the [[Bodhisattva]] of compassion, [[Avalokiteśvara]]. This mantra is particularly associated with the four-armed Shadakshari form of Avalokiteśvara. Moreover, as a seed syllable (''[[Bīja|bija]] [[mantra]]''), ''Aum'' is considered sacred and holy in [[Esoteric Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiancentury.com/om.htm|title="OM" - THE SYMBOL OF THE ABSOLUTE|accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars interpret the first word of the mantra ''oṃ maṇipadme hūṃ'' to be ''auṃ'', with a meaning similar to Hinduism – the totality of sound, existence and consciousness.&lt;ref name="carlolsenb"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Different Paths of Buddhism: A Narrative-Historical Introduction|last=Olsen|first=Carl|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2014|ISBN=978-0-8135-3778-8|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Gods of Northern Buddhism: Their History and Iconography|last=Getty|first=Alice|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1988|ISBN=978-0-486-25575-0|pages=29, 191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Oṃ'' has been described by the 14th Dalai Lama as "composed of three pure letters, A, U, and M.

Onkar is, states Wazir Singh, a "variation of Om (Aum) of the ancient Indian scriptures (with a slight change in its orthography), implying the seed-force that evolves as the universe".&lt;ref&gt;Wazir Singh (1969), Guru Nanak's philosophy, Journal of Religious Studies, Vol. 1, Issue 1, page 56&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ik Onkar'' is part of the "Mul Mantra" in Sikh teachings and represents "One God", explains Gulati, where "Ik" means One, and Onkar is "equivalent of the Hindu "Om" (Aum)".&lt;ref name=gulati285&gt;Mahinder Gulati (2008), Comparative Religious And Philosophies : Anthropomorphlsm And Divinity, Atlantic, {{ISBN|978-8126909025}}, pages 284-285; Quote: "While Ek literally means One, Onkar is the equivalent of the Hindu "Om" (Aum), the one syllable sound representing the holy trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva - the God in His entirety."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guru Nanak]] wrote a poem entitled Oankar in which, states Doniger, he "attributed the origin and sense of speech to the Divinity, who is thus the Om-maker".&lt;ref name="M-W Ik Onkar"/&gt;
{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
''Oankar'' ('the Primal Sound') created [[Brahma]], ''Oankar'' fashioned the consciousness,
From ''Oankar'' came mountains and ages, ''Oankar'' produced the [[Vedas]],
By the grace of ''Oankar'', people were saved through the divine word,
By the grace of ''Oankar'', they were liberated through the teachings of the Guru.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Ramakali Dakkhani|Adi Granth 929-930, Translated by Pashaura Singh&lt;ref name=pashaura227&gt;Pashaura Singh (2014), in The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies (Editors: Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199699308}}, page 227&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Ik Aumkara'' appears at the start of ''Mul Mantra'', states Kohli, and it occurs as "Aum" in the ''Upanishads'' and in ''Gurbani''.&lt;ref name=sskohli39&gt;SS Kohli (1993), The Sikh and Sikhism, Atlantic, {{ISBN|81-71563368}}, page 35, Quote: "Ik Aumkara is a significant name in Guru Granth Sahib and appears in the very beginning of Mul Mantra. It occurs as Aum in the Upanishads and in Gurbani, the Onam Akshara (the letter Aum) has been considered as the abstract of three worlds (p. 930). According to Brihadaranyaka Upanishad "Aum" connotes both the transcendent and immanent Brahman.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the meaning of ''Oankar'' in the Sikh tradition, states Pashaura Singh, is quite different in certain respects than those in other Indian philosophical traditions.&lt;ref name=pashaura227/&gt;

== Modern reception ==
The Brahmic script ''om''-ligature has become widely recognised in Western [[counterculture]] since the 1960s, mostly in its standard [[Devanagari]] form (ॐ), but the [[Tibetan alphabet]] ''om'' (ༀ) has also gained limited currency in popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Messerle|first=Ulrich|title=Graphics of the Sacred Symbol OM|url=http://om.pinkproton.org/pictures/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1100">'''Opéra bouffon''' is the French term for the Italian genre of [[opera buffa]] (comic opera) performed in 18th-century France, either in the original language or in French translation. The term was also used by [[Jacques Offenbach]] for three of his works: ''[[Orphée aux enfers]]'', ''{{ill|Le roman comique|fr|Le Roman comique (opéra)}}'' and ''[[scores:Le voyage de MM. Dunanan père et fils (Offenbach, Jacques)|Le voyage de MM. Dunanan père et fils'']].

The term is sometimes confused with the French [[opéra comique]] and [[opéra bouffe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1828">In [[mathematics]], more specifically in [[algebraic geometry]], '''Parshin's conjecture''' (also referred to as the Beilinson–Parshin conjecture) states that for any [[smooth morphism|smooth]] [[projective variety]] ''X'' defined over a [[finite field]], the higher [[algebraic K-theory|algebraic K-groups]] vanish up to torsion:
:&lt;math&gt;K_i(X) \otimes \mathbf Q = 0 \ \, i &gt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;
It is named after [[Aleksei Nikolaevich Parshin]] and [[Alexander Beilinson]].

==Points and curves==
The conjecture holds for a finite field by [[Daniel Quillen|Quillen]]'s computations of the ''K''-groups in this case. Secondly, for a smooth proper curve, Quillen&lt;ref&gt;see {{cite book|last=Grayson|first=Dan|title=Algebraic K-theory, Part I (Oberwolfach, 1980)|chapter=Finite generation of K-groups of a curve over a finite field (after Daniel Quillen)|url=http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~dan/Papers/FiniteGeneration.pdf|year=1982|volume=966|series=Lecture Notes in Math.|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that the ''K''-groups are finitely generated, while Harder's computations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harder|first=Günter|title=Die Kohomologie S-arithmetischer Gruppen über Funktionenkörpern|journal=Invent. Math.|year=1977|volume=42|pages=135–175|doi=10.1007/bf01389786}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that the groups are torsion. The two results together thus show Parshin's conjecture for curves.

The '''Pawnee language''' is a [[Caddoan languages|Caddoan language]] spoken by some [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] Native Americans who now live in north-central [[Oklahoma]]. Their traditional historic lands were along the [[Platte River]] in what is now [[Nebraska]].

==Dialects==
Two important [[dialect]] divisions are evident in Pawnee: South Band and ''Skiri''. The distinction between the two dialects rests on differences in their respective [[phonetics|phonetic]] inventory and [[lexicon]].

==Status==
Once the language of thousands of Pawnees, today Pawnee is spoken by a shrinking number of elderly speakers.  As more young people learn [[English language|English]] as their first language, the status of Pawnee declines towards [[extinct language|extinction]]. However, as of 2007, the Pawnee Nation is developing teaching materials for the local high school and for adult language classes. Now, there are extensive documentary materials in the language archived at the American Indian Studies Research Institute. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ethnologue.com/language/paw&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
The following describes the South Band dialect.

===Consonants===
Pawnee has eight [[consonant]] [[phoneme]]s, and according to one analysis of medial- and final-position glottal stops, one may posit a ninth consonant phoneme.

*  {{IPA|/ʔ/}} is predictable when it occurs in the middle of words. However, since {{IPA|/ʔ/}} is not completely predictable at the end of words, it may also need to be considered as a (phonemic) consonant.

===Vowels===

Pawnee has four [[vowel length|short]] [[vowel]] phonemes and four [[vowel length|long]] counterparts (also phonemic).

|}

==Morphology==
Pawnee is an [[ergative-absolutive language|ergative-absolutive]] [[polysynthetic language]].

==Alphabet==
The Pawnee [[alphabet]]{{citation needed|reason="alphabet" here looks dubious, since an alphabet doesn't have vowels, and if what is meant is vowel letters ... well, "e" and "ee" are not distinct vowel letters.|date=September 2017}} has 9 consonants and 8 vowels. The letters are relatively similar in pronunciation to their English counterparts.

'''Stephen Pit Corder''' (6 October 1918 – 27 January 1990&lt;ref name="BAAL-History" /&gt;), generally known as '''Pit Corder''', was a professor of [[applied linguistics]] at [[Edinburgh University]], known for his contribution to the study of [[Error analysis (linguistics)|error analysis]]. He was the first chairman of the [[British Association for Applied Linguistics]], 1967–70,&lt;ref name="BAAL-History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Notes on the History of the British Association for Applied Linguistics|publisher=British Association for Applied Linguistics|url=http://www.baal.org.uk/dox/history_of_baal.pdf|accessdate=30 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029100702/http://www.baal.org.uk/dox/history_of_baal.pdf|archivedate=29 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was instrumental in developing the field of [[applied linguistics]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor1-last=Byram|editor1-first=Michael|year=2000|encyclopedia=Routledge Encyclopedia of Language Teaching and Learning|title=Applied linguistics|location=London|publisher=Routledge|page=33|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Pit Corder was born at 4 Bootham Terrace, [[York]], into a [[Quaker]] family.&lt;ref name="BAAL-History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ONDB"&gt;{{ODNBweb|ref=harv |last=Davies |first=Alan |title=Corder, Stephen Pit (1918–1990) |id=69741}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Philip Corder (b. 1885), was a schoolteacher of English origin, and his mother, Johanna Adriana van der Mersch (b. 1887), was Dutch.&lt;ref name="ONDB" /&gt; Pit studied at [[Bootham School]], a Quaker boarding school near York, where his father was a master.&lt;ref name="ONDB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BOSA"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bootham School Register|editor1-last=Woodland|editor1-first=Jenny|place=York, England|publisher=Bootham Old Scholars Association|year=2011|oclc=844773709|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to read modern languages at [[Merton College, Oxford]], from 1936 to 1939.&lt;ref name="ONDB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCreg"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Levens|editor1-first=R.G.C.|title=Merton College Register 1900-1964|date=1964|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Oxford, Corder taught at [[Great Ayton Friends' School]] until serving in the [[Friends' Ambulance Unit]] during [[World War II]] in [[Finland]] and [[Egypt]], having received exemption from [[military service]] as a [[conscientious objector]].&lt;ref name="ONDB" /&gt; In 1946 he married Nancy Procter (b. 1916), his second cousin, with whom he had two sons and a daughter.&lt;ref name="ONDB" /&gt;

== Career ==

After the war, Corder worked for the [[British Council]] in [[Austria]], [[Turkey]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Colombia]].&lt;ref name="ONDB" /&gt; During this time he taught classes, worked on syllabus design, and prepared new language-teaching materials.&lt;ref name="BAAL-History" /&gt; In 1957 Corder joined the school of applied linguistics at the University of Edinburgh, although he continued to be employed by the British Council. The British Council needed specialists in applied linguistics for its expansion around the world, and Corder studied for the diploma in applied linguistics in order to fulfil that need. After a year of study the British Council posted him to Nigeria, where he helped to develop English-language teaching materials for television.&lt;ref name="ONDB" /&gt;

Corder left the British Council after this, although sources disagree on exactly when. According to his obituary by the British Association for Applied Linguistics, he left the British Council in 1961, when he began teaching at [[University of Leeds|Leeds University]].&lt;ref name="BAAL-History" /&gt; However, according to his biography in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, he was seconded to Leeds by the British Council, and only left the organisation in 1964 when he became director of the school of applied linguistics at the University of Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="ONDB" /&gt; Corder stayed at the University of Edinburgh for the rest of his professional life.&lt;ref name="ELT"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/elt/40.3.185 | title = Talking shop: Pit Corder on language teaching and applied linguistics | journal = ELT Journal | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 185–190 | year = 1986 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EnPointeFoot.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|''En pointe'' foot in a [[pointe shoe]]]]

'''Pointe technique''' is the part of classical [[ballet technique]] that concerns ''pointe work'', in which a [[ballet]] dancer supports all body weight on the tips of fully extended feet within [[pointe shoe]]s. A dancer is said to be ''en pointe'' when the dancer's body is supported in this manner, and a fully extended vertical foot is said to be ''en pointe'' when touching the floor, even when not bearing weight. Pointe work is performed while wearing pointe shoes, which employ structural reinforcing to distribute the dancer's weight load throughout the foot, thus reducing the load on the toes enough to enable the dancer to support all body weight on fully vertical feet.

Pointe technique resulted from a desire for female dancers to appear weightless and [[sylph]]-like. Although both men and women are capable of pointe work, it is most often performed by women. Extensive training and practice are required to develop the strength and technique needed for pointe work.&lt;ref name="Understanding Pointe"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yang|first1=Raissa|title=Understanding Pointe|url=http://understandingpointe.weebly.com/|website=Understanding Pointe|publisher=Weebly.com|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, dance teachers consider factors such as age, experience, strength, and alignment when deciding whether to allow a dancer to begin pointe work.&lt;ref name="Brandt"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brandt|first1=Amy|title=Am I Ready for Pointe?|url=http://www.dancespirit.com/how-to/ballet/am-i-ready-for-pointe/|website=DanceSpirit Magazine|publisher=Dance Media, LLC|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
[[File:Réda Sári - Raymonda, Tableau du rêve - Prix de Lausanne 2010-11.jpg|thumb|Body alignment and foot placement are fundamental aspects of pointe technique, as illustrated by this ''en pointe'' dancer]]
Pointe technique encompasses both the mechanical and artistic aspects of pointe work. In particular, it is concerned with body alignment, placement of the feet, and the manner in which a dancer transitions to and from en pointe. A dancer is said to have "good" or "proper" technique when in conformance with the [[best practice]]s of pointe technique, which in turn are generally referred to as ''proper technique''.

===Placement and alignment===
En pointe dancers employ pointe technique to determine foot placement and body alignment. When exhibiting proper technique, a dancer's en pointe foot is placed so that the [[Instep#instep|instep]] is fully stretched, with toes perpendicular to the floor, with the pointe shoe's platform (the flattened tip of the toe box) square to the floor so that a substantial part of its surface is contacting the floor.

Proper technique is also evident from a dancer's body alignment, by visualizing a straight line that extends from the center of the hip through the toes. When a properly aligned dancer is viewed from the side, the line passes through the knee, ankle joint, and [[hallux|big toe]] joints. When viewed from the front, the line passes through the knee, ankle joint, and the joints of the [[long toe|second toe]] or [[middle toe]] or the area between those toe joints. In cases of unusually high instep or metatarsal joint flexibility, it is sometimes necessary to flex the toes to achieve proper alignment.

===Movement into ''en pointe''===
A dancer may transition to en pointe by any of three possible methods: relevé, sauté or piqué.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[relevé (dance)|relevé]] method, the dancer rises smoothly by rotating the foot downward until it reaches a fully extended, vertical orientation, while the toe box remains in contact with the floor, thus "rolling up" on the foot. This may be done either gradually or rapidly, on one foot or both feet, beginning with feet flat on the floor or in demi-pointe (heels raised). In the [[sauté (ballet)|sauté]] method, the dancer springs up and lands en pointe. In the process, the feet break contact with the floor and the dancer is briefly airborne. To transition to en pointe via [[piqué (ballet)|piqué]], a dancer will step out directly onto a fully extended, vertical foot. The other foot is then raised from the floor, thereby leaving the dancer en pointe.

Modern ballet technique incorporates all three transition methods. Relevé and piqué transitions are typically used for [[Glossary of ballet#Adagio|adage]]s, where strength, poise, and controlled movements are highlighted. The more abrupt sauté method, which was introduced by Enrico Cecchetti,&lt;ref&gt;Theory and Practice of Classical Theatrical Dancing, C. Beaumont, S. Idzikowski&lt;/ref&gt; is typically used in [[Glossary of ballet#Allegro|allegro]]s, where the relatively slow and smooth relevé and piqué transitions would be both impractical and visually inconsistent with the lively pace of movement. The sauté method is more common in [[Russian ballet]].&lt;ref&gt;Vaganova, A. Basic principles of classical ballet&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
[[File:Ballet barre.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Ballet dancer performing [[Barre (ballet)|barre]] exercises]]

===Prerequisites===
Although age is not necessarily a prerequisite, many ballet students do not begin to dance en pointe earlier than approximately 12–14 years of age because bones in the feet are often too soft prior to that age and, in such cases, serious and permanent foot injuries could result from starting pointe work too early.&lt;ref name="Understanding Pointe" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The long bones in feet begin to harden within the ages of 8 to 14, dancing en pointe before one's bones have hardened can lead to trauma and growth-plate fractures that create deformed feet.&lt;ref name="Brandt" /&gt;

Exceptions may be made if a physician has determined that a dancer's feet have sufficiently [[ossification|ossified]],&lt;ref name="Understanding Pointe" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Prina&gt;[[Scuola di Ballo del Teatro alla Scala]]: Testo programmatico per lo studio della danza classica – Teatro alla Scala, A. M. Prina&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fit feet – ballet dancers and pointe work, ''Dance Magazine'', September 1997, Marian Horosko&lt;/ref&gt; and it is not uncommon for dancers to begin pointe work as early as age nine.&lt;ref&gt;About.com – http://dance.about.com/od/adultdancers/a/Begin_Pointe.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Oftentimes dance studios require their dancers to get x-rays performed on their feet and have their physician verify whether the dancer's feet are ready for pointe work.&lt;ref name="Understanding Pointe" /&gt;

Another key determining factor is strength in the legs, feet, ankles, and core.&lt;ref name="Understanding Pointe" /&gt; Without strong ankles, feet, and legs dancers are likely to hurt themselves once en pointe or be too weak to remain en pointe for the duration of a routine.&lt;ref name="Understanding Pointe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brandt" /&gt; Strong core strength ensures the dancer maintains their center and prevents them from rolling their feet when dancing en pointe.&lt;ref name="Understanding Pointe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brandt" /&gt;

Otherwise, ballet students are generally ready to begin pointe work after achieving competency in fundamental ballet technique and have been dancing for a number of years.&lt;ref name="Understanding Pointe" /&gt; For example, before learning pointe work, a dancer must be able to maintain [[turnout (ballet)|turnout]] while performing center combinations, hold a proper ballet position with straight back and good turnout, pull up properly in the legs, and balance securely in a relevé that is perpendicular to the floor.

===Preparation (pre-pointe classes)===

Preparation for pointe work is a gradual process that begins with [[Barre (ballet)|barre]] exercises to develop the requisite strength in ankles, feet, legs, and core often known as pre-pointe classes.&lt;ref name="Understanding Pointe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pre-Point" /&gt; These exercises may vary in accordance with a teacher's preferences and, if applicable, the training method's [[syllabus]]. The first exercises at the barre are usually ''relevés'' and ''échappés''.&lt;ref name=Prina /&gt; When the student is comfortable executing these steps on both feet and sufficiently strong, steps ending on one en pointe foot are introduced, such as ''pas de bourrée'' and ''retiré.''

During each class session, a student will move on to centre exercises after completing the barre work. These exercises emphasize various aspects of ballet technique, such as [[turnout (ballet)|turnout]], pointing of the toes, and the use of ballet technique while en pointe.

Dancers take pre-pointe typically for a year before they are allowed to get pointe shoes.&lt;ref name="Understanding Pointe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pre-Point"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bedinghaus|first1=Treva|title=What are pre-point classes?|url=http://dance.about.com/od/Pointe_Ballet/f/What-Are-Pre-pointe-Classes.htm|website=About Home|publisher=About.com|accessdate=11 April 2016|archivedate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is to the discretion of the dance instructor to determine if one year of pre-pointe is sufficient or if the dancer needs more time to prepare.&lt;ref name="Pre-Point" /&gt;

==Health risks and injury prevention==

Dancing en pointe stresses the feet in various ways and thus can potentially cause injuries if the dancer does not plan ahead or take into account health and safety concerns. Injuries can result from improper technique, poorly fitting pointe shoes, and lack of effective cushioning and accessories.&lt;ref name="Understanding Pointe" /&gt; Some types of injuries are prevented by adhering to proper technique such as correct upper-body positioning, maintaining straight knees when required, keeping body weight centered over the box of the shoes, and avoiding [[Glossary of ballet#Sickle|sickling]]. Problems dealing with technique can be easily fixed by proper training and one-on-one interactions with the dance instructor to improve the dancer's technique.&lt;ref name="Understanding Pointe" /&gt;

Injuries due to toe misalignment are often avoided by adjusting toe alignments with [[Pointe shoe#Accessories|gel toe spacers]]. Toenail [[bruise|bruising]] can be caused by heavy pressure on the surface of the nail; this is typically prevented by keeping toenails clipped short, by wrapping tape around the toes, by using padding, or combinations of these.&lt;ref name="Understanding Pointe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="protecting toes" /&gt; Bruising can also occur on the tips of the toes, especially when no padding is used. It is highly unadvised to dance en pointe without any padding at all.&lt;ref name="Understanding Pointe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="protecting toes" /&gt;

Pointe work can cause friction between toes and the interior of the pointe shoe's box. This friction, under the high pressure of much of the dancer's body weight, can result in chafing and [[blister]]ing. This is often mitigated with [[lambswool]] or [[Pointe shoe#Accessories|toe pads]] or by wrapping tape around toes or use gel pads that can conform to any one problem area.&lt;ref name="protecting toes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Warnecke|first1=Lauren|title=Protecting Your Toesies For Pointe|url=http://www.danceadvantage.net/pointe-padding/|website=Dance Advantage|publisher=Wordpress|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Choosing between cloth and gel, gel, only cloth, wool, etc. for toe pads is a personal preference for each dancer but each style has its own benefits.&lt;ref name="Understanding Pointe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="toe pads"&gt;{{cite web|title=Toe Pads|url=http://dancewearcorner.com/collections/toe-pads|website=Dance Wear Corner|publisher=The Dancewear Corner Inc.|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other exterior injuries include [[Wounds|cuts]] caused by toenails piercing adjacent toes. This can be prevented by keeping toe nails cut short and filed smooth. Also, [[callus]]es may form on the bottoms and sides of the feet, which can crack open. This can be helped by the use of gel pad protectors on specific problem spots or using pads to surround the toes.&lt;ref name="protecting toes" /&gt; [[Ingrown nail]]s can result from ill-fitting shoes.

'''Other common injuries:'''
* Deformities such as [[bunion]]s, [[bunionette]]s, and [[hammer toe]]s
* Inflammations such as [[bursitis]] and [[sesamoiditis]] 
* [[Plantar fasciitis|Dancer's heel]] (Plantar fasciitis), a tightening of the instep tendon that causes discomfort in the instep and heel
* [[Sprain]]ed [[ankle]]s
* [[Stress fracture]]s
* [[Achilles tendinitis]] and [[extensor]] tendinitis

In [[computational linguistics]], '''second-order co-occurrence pointwise mutual information''' is a [[semantic similarity]] measure. To assess the degree of [[association (statistics)|association]] between two given words, it uses [[pointwise mutual information]] (PMI) to sort lists of important neighbor words of the two target words from a large [[Corpus linguistics|corpus]]. 

==History==
The PMI-IR method{{clarify|date=November 2010}} used [[AltaVista]]'s Advanced Search query syntax to calculate [[probability|probabilities]]. Note that the "NEAR" search operator of AltaVista is an essential operator in the PMI-IR method.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} However, it is no longer in use in AltaVista; this means that, from the implementation point of view, it is not possible to use the PMI-IR method in the same form in new systems. In any case, from the algorithmic point of view, the advantage of using SOC-PMI is that it can calculate the similarity between two words that do not co-occur frequently, because they co-occur with the same neighboring words. For example, the [[British National Corpus]] (BNC) has been used as a source of frequencies and contexts. 

==Methodology==
The method considers the words that are common in both lists and aggregate their PMI values (from the opposite list) to calculate the relative semantic similarity.  We define the ''pointwise mutual information'' function for only those words having &lt;math&gt;f^b (t_i, w)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;
 f^\text{pmi}(t_i,w)=\log_2 \frac{f^b (t_i,w)\times m}{f^t (t_i)f^t (w)},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f^t (t_i)&lt;/math&gt; tells us how many times the type &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; appeared in the entire corpus, &lt;math&gt;f^b(t_i, w)&lt;/math&gt; tells us how many times word &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; appeared with word &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; in a context window and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is total number of tokens in the corpus. Now, for word &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, we define a set of words, &lt;math&gt;X^w&lt;/math&gt;, sorted in descending order by their PMI values with &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and taken the top-most &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; words having &lt;math&gt;f^\text{pmi}(t_i, w)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

The set &lt;math&gt;X^w&lt;/math&gt;, contains words  &lt;math&gt;X_i^w&lt;/math&gt;, 
:&lt;math&gt;X^w=\{X_i^w\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;i=1, 2, \ldots ,\beta&lt;/math&gt;  and
:&lt;math&gt;f^\text{pmi}(X_1^w, w)\geq f^\text{pmi}(X_2^w, w)\geq \cdots f^\text{pmi}(X_{\beta-1}^w, w)\geq f^\text{pmi}(X_\beta^w, w)&lt;/math&gt;

A [[rule of thumb]] is used to choose the value of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;. The ''&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-PMI summation'' function of a word is defined with respect to another word. For word &lt;math&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt; with respect to word &lt;math&gt;w_2&lt;/math&gt; it is:

: &lt;math&gt;
f(w_1,w_2,\beta)=\sum_{i=1}^\beta (f^\text{pmi}(X_i^{w_1},w_2))^\gamma
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f^\text{pmi}(X_i^{w_1},w_2)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; which sums all the positive PMI values of words in the set &lt;math&gt;X^{w_2}&lt;/math&gt;  also common to the words in the set &lt;math&gt;X^{w_1}&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, this function actually aggregates the positive PMI values of all the semantically close words of &lt;math&gt;w_2&lt;/math&gt; which are also common in &lt;math&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt;'s list. &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; should have a value greater than 1.  So, the ''&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-PMI summation'' function for word &lt;math&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt; with respect to word &lt;math&gt;w_2&lt;/math&gt; having &lt;math&gt;\beta=\beta_1&lt;/math&gt; and the ''&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-PMI summation'' function for word &lt;math&gt;w_2&lt;/math&gt; with respect to word &lt;math&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt; having &lt;math&gt;\beta=\beta_2&lt;/math&gt; are

: &lt;math&gt;
f(w_1,w_2,\beta_1)=\sum_{i=1}^{\beta_1}(f^\text{pmi}(X_i^{w_1},w_2))^\gamma
&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;
f(w_2,w_1,\beta_2)=\sum_{i=1}^{\beta_2}(f^\text{pmi}(X_i^{w_2},w_1))^\gamma &lt;/math&gt;

respectively.

Finally, the ''semantic PMI similarity'' function between the two words, &lt;math&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_2&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as

: &lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{Sim}(w_1,w_2)=\frac{f(w_1,w_2,\beta_1)}{\beta_1}+\frac{f(w_2,w_1,\beta_2)}{\beta_2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The semantic word similarity is normalized, so that it provides a similarity score between &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; inclusively. The normalization of semantic similarity algorithm returns a normalized score of similarity between two words. It takes as arguments the two words, &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_j&lt;/math&gt;, and a maximum value, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, that is returned by the semantic similarity function, Sim(). It returns a similarity score between 0 and 1 inclusively. For example, the algorithm returns 0.986 for words ''cemetery'' and ''graveyard'' with &lt;math&gt;\lambda=20&lt;/math&gt; (for SOC-PMI method).

"'''The Rain in Spain'''" is a song from the [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', with music by [[Frederick Loewe]] and lyrics by [[Alan Jay Lerner]]. The song was published in [[1956 in music|1956]], sounding similar to piano trio in C minor 3rd movement by Josep Suk.

The song is a turning point in the plotline of the musical. Professor Higgins and Colonel Pickering have been drilling [[Eliza Doolittle]] incessantly with speech exercises, trying to break her [[Cockney]] accent speech pattern. The key lyric in the song is "The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain", which contains five words that a Cockney would pronounce with {{IPA|[æɪ]}} or {{IPA|[aɪ]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; – more like "eye" {{IPA|[aɪ]}} than the [[Received Pronunciation]] diphthong {{IPA|[eɪ]}}. With the three of them nearly exhausted, Eliza finally "gets it", and recites the sentence with all long-As. The trio breaks into song, repeating this key phrase as well as singing other exercises correctly, such as "In Hertford, Hereford, and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly happen", and "How kind of you to let me come", in which Eliza had failed before by dropping the leading 'H'.

==Origin==
The phrase does not appear in Shaw's original play, but is used in the [[Pygmalion (1938 film)|1938 film of the play]]. According to ''The Disciple and His Devil'', the biography of [[Gabriel Pascal]] by his wife Valerie, it was he who introduced the famous phonetic exercises "The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain" and "In Hertford, Hereford, and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen" into the script of the film, the first of which was later used in the song in ''My Fair Lady''.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, Valerie, "The Disciple and His Devil," ''McGraw-hill'', 1970. p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rain in Spain does not actually stay mainly in the plain; it falls mainly in the [[Pyrenees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maps.howstuffworks.com/spain-annual-precipitation-map.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815203007/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/spain-annual-precipitation-map.htm |archivedate=2009-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Spanish, the phrase was translated as ''La lluvia en Sevilla es una maravilla'' (The rain in [[Seville]] is a miracle). The lyric about [[Hertford]], [[Hereford]], and [[Hampshire]] contains an [[implicature]] (but not an [[entailment]]) that hurricanes ever occur at all in these areas. This implicature is false as the only hurricane-force  winds (≥ 64 knots) that do occur in these areas result from [[extratropical cyclone]]s, which differ from hurricanes in their causes and dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/23degrees/2011/09/whats_in_a_name.html|title=BBC - Orbit: Earth's Extraordinary Journey: What's in a name?|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Sparrow''''' (1996) is the [[debut novel|first novel]] by author [[Mary Doria Russell]].
It won the [[Arthur C. Clarke Award]], [[James Tiptree, Jr. Award]], [[Kurd-Laßwitz-Preis]] and the [[BSFA Award|British Science Fiction Association Award]]. It was followed by a sequel, ''[[Children of God (novel)|Children of God]]'', in 1998. The title refers to [[Gospel of Matthew]] 10:29–31, which relates that not even a [[sparrow]] falls to the earth without God's knowledge thereof.

== Plot ==
In the year 2019, the [[SETI]] program at [[Arecibo Observatory]] discovers radio broadcasts of music from the vicinity of [[Alpha Centauri]]. The first expedition to Rakhat, the world that is sending the music, is organized by the [[Society of Jesus]] (Jesuits), known for its [[missionary]], linguistic and scientific activities since the time of its founder, [[Ignatius of Loyola]]. In the year 2060, only one of the crew, the Jesuit priest Emilio Sandoz, survives to return to Earth, and he is damaged physically and psychologically. The story is told with parallel plot lines, interspersing the journey of Sandoz and his friends to Rakhat with Sandoz's experiences upon his return to Earth.

Father Sandoz, a talented [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[linguistics|linguist]], is described as of mixed [[Taíno]] and [[Conquistador]] heritage and character. Sandoz grew up in [[La Perla, San Juan, Puerto Rico|La Perla]], a poor neighborhood, and joined the Jesuits as a teenager. After several stints at Jesuit missionaries around the world, he returns to Puerto Rico. Several of his close friends and co-workers, people with a variety of unique skills and talents, have seemingly coincidental connections to Arecibo. One of them, a gifted young technician, was the first to hear the transmissions; another, Sofia Mendes, a [[History of the Jews in Turkey|Turkish Jewish]] artificial intelligence specialist, has the connections and aptitude to obtain a spacecraft and help pilot the mission. Sandoz, who has often struggled with his faith, becomes convinced that only God's will could bring this group of people with the perfect combination of knowledge and experience together at the moment when the alien signal was detected. Sandoz and his friends, along with three other Jesuit priests, are chosen by the Society of Jesus to travel in secret to the planet, using an [[interstellar travel|interstellar vessel]] made with a small [[asteroid]].

Upon reaching Rakhat, the crew tries to acclimatize themselves to the new world, experimenting with eating local [[flora]] and [[fauna]], then making contact with a rural village, inhabited by a peaceful tribe of [[herbivore|vegetarian]] [[Hunter-gatherer|gatherers]], the ''Runa''. Though clearly not the singers of the radio broadcasts, the Earthlings settle among the Runa and begin to learn their language, known as ''Ruanja'', and culture. Although Sandoz struggles with his attraction to Sofia, he finds greater spiritual meaning in his interactions with the Runa. The crew transmits all their findings via computer uplink to the asteroid-ship in [[orbit]]. One day, in an attempt to retrieve supplies from their landing vehicle for a sick crew member, the landing vehicle runs short of the fuel needed to safely return to the asteroid ship, and the crew must face the reality that they may never return to Earth.

When the Earthlings finally meet a member of the culture which produced the radio transmissions, he proves to be of an entirely different species from the rural natives, a ''Jana'ata''.  This ''Jana'ata'', an ambitious merchant named Supaari VaGayjur, sees in the visitors a possibility to improve his status, while the crew hopes to find an alternative source of fuel in Supaari's city, Gayjur. Meanwhile, the crew begins to grow their own food, introducing the concept of agriculture to the villagers. These seemingly innocent actions and accompanying cultural misunderstandings precipitate an outbreak of violence. Though not closely related genetically, the ''Jana'ata'' have evolved by [[aggressive mimicry]] to physically resemble the ''Runa'', who are in fact their prey species. The human introduction of agriculture leads to a ''Runa'' [[baby boom]] which is harvested by the predatory ''Jana'ata''. The humans are riven with guilt over their misguided action, and most, including Sofia, are killed defending against the ''Jana'ata'' attack. Only Sandoz and one other human survive, and Sandoz endures capture, degradation, and a crisis of faith. Eventually found by Suupari, Sandoz's hands are disfigured and rendered useless in a ''Jana'ata'' practice meant to convey the honor and privilege of being dependent on another, a mutilation analogous to the practice of [[foot binding]]. The mutilation kills the other surviving crew member; Sandoz survives, though he is physically and spiritually traumatized and believes himself at fault for the death of his friends. Later, Supaari gives Sandoz away to the ''Reshtar'' of Galatna, the poet and musician behind the music originally heard on Earth, in exchange for the right to have a wife and start his own lineage. Held captive by the ''Reshtar'', Sandoz realizes the ''Reshtar'' is the sources of the music that brought them to Rakhat and momentarily regains his faith; however, the ''Reshtar'' is only interested in Sandoz as a pet and he is [[sexual slavery|forced to sexually satisfy]] the musician, along with his friends and colleagues. It is later revealed that the ''Reshtar'' broadcasts songs about his sexual exploits, songs which may have been heard on Earth.

When Sandoz returns to Earth in 2060, his friends are dead, and his faith, once considered worthy of [[canonization]] by his superiors, has turned into [[Theodicy|bitter anger with the God]] who inspired him to go to Rakhat. Due to [[twin paradox|relativistic space-time effects]], decades had passed while he has been gone, during which popular outrage at the UN's initial and highly out-of-context report on the mission, and especially Sandoz's role in the tragedy, had left the Society of Jesus shattered and nearly extinct. The Jesuits shelter Sandoz from the media and help him recover physically, while the Father Superior selects a panel of Jesuit priests from around the world to help Sandoz come out of his shell and explain what really happened. Initially bent on discovering the truth, the other priests eventually recognize the great personal cost at which the journey came, and accept Sandoz's epic struggle with his faith. Over the course of several months, Sandoz painfully explains his story and begins his personal healing.

== Similarities to other works ==
''The Sparrow'' is similar to [[James Blish]]'s science fiction novel ''[[A Case of Conscience]]''. It also involves a Jesuit priest confronting an alien civilization. Mary Doria Russell has addressed this speculation:

{{quote|I get this question all the time, because Blish's 1958 story is about a Spanish Jesuit in space. People have told me that the protagonist is named Ruiz-Sanchez, so they thought I must have named Emilio Sandoz in homage to Blish. In fact, Emilio got his name from the pharmaceutical manufacturer who made my son's cold medicine. Danny got a cold in 1992 when I started the book, and I noticed the name [[Sandoz]] on the medicine label and thought it sounded good. No symbolism or homage beyond that, I'm afraid!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.roadrunner.com/druss44121/faqs.htm |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=2008-05-02 |first= Mary Doria| last= Russell |website= homepages.roadrunner.com | publisher= Mary Doria Russell| date= 2007-03-10 |quote= [original link included this text:] If I ever read this story, I guess it didn't make much of an impression on me, because I don't remember it.

==Literary significance and reception==
Nancy Pearl, a reviewer at ''[[Library Journal]]'', felt that this book was mistakenly categorized as [[science fiction]], and that it is really "a [[philosophical fiction|philosophical novel]] about the nature of good and evil and what happens when a man tries to do the right thing, for the right reasons and ends up causing incalculable harm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In the Catholic journal ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'', Paul Q. Kane writes that Russell has done her research on the early historic Jesuit missions and on Jesuit spirituality. He continues that she is successfully updating the stories of other important Jesuits who have sent men to distant lands or went themselves to foreign cultures to represent Christianity. "Russell subtly raises concerns about the ways in which sophisticated cultures tell themselves cover stories in order to justify actions taken at a terrible cost to others". This is also reflected in the way that Sofia has to buy her freedom from what she describes as an institution of intellectual prostitution; as well as the differences between the simple ''Runa'' who live in the countryside and the ''Jana'ata'', who are the sophisticated city dwellers that created the beautiful music which triggered the mission originally.&lt;ref&gt;

Since then, Mary Russell has revoked all film rights, believing that Hollywood cannot and will not make a film version of ''The Sparrow'' that is faithful to the book. She has written her own screenplay with her assistant Karen Hall, but has realized it has little to no chance of being produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| quote= Michael [Seitzman]’s adaptation made sense in the context of what [[Hollywood cinema|Hollywood]] is likely to buy and/or produce, but it changed too much of the story for it to be satisfying to the many readers who genuinely love that novel.

'''Tok Pisin''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|t|ɒ|k|_|ˈ|p|ɪ|s|ɪ|n|}},&lt;ref name="pronounce1"&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student’s Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pronounce2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/tok_pisin|title=Tok Pisin {{!}} Definition of Tok Pisin in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;small&gt;Tok Pisin&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|/ˌtok piˈsin/|Tok Pisin:}}&lt;ref name="Smith2008" /&gt;) is a [[creole language]] spoken throughout [[Papua New Guinea]]. It is an official language of Papua New Guinea and the most widely used language in the country. However, in parts of [[Western Province (Papua New Guinea)|Western]], [[Gulf Province (Papua New Guinea)|Gulf]], [[Central Province (Papua New Guinea)|Central]], [[Oro Province]] and [[Milne Bay Province]]s, the use of Tok Pisin has a shorter history, and is less universal, especially among older people.  While it likely developed as a trade [[pidgin]], Tok Pisin has become a distinct language in its own right.  It is often referred to by Anglophones as "'''New Guinea Pidgin'''" or "Pidgin English".

Between five and six million people use Tok Pisin to some degree, although not all speak it well. Many now learn it as a first language, in particular the children of parents or grandparents who originally spoke different vernaculars (for example, a mother from [[Madang]] and a father from [[Rabaul]]). Urban families in particular, and those of [[police]] and defence force members, often communicate among themselves in Tok Pisin, either never gaining fluency in a [[vernacular]] ({{lang|tpi|tok ples}}), or learning a vernacular as a second (or third) language, after Tok Pisin (and possibly [[English language|English]]). Perhaps one million people now use Tok Pisin as a primary language. Tok Pisin is "slowly crowding out" other [[languages of Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=A.V.|title=Papua New Guinea’s incredible linguistic diversity|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/07/economist-explains-14|accessdate=20 July 2017|work=[[The Economist]]|date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
[[File:F. Mihatlic SVD The Jacaranda Dictionary and Grammar of Melanesian Pidgin.jpg|right|thumb|120px|A 1971 reference book on Tok Pisin (then called ''Melanesian Pidgin'').]]
{{lang|tpi|Tok}} is derived from English "talk", but has a wider application, also meaning "word", "speech", or "language". {{lang|tpi|Pisin}} derives from the English word ''[[pidgin]]''; the latter, in turn, may originate in the word ''business'', which is descriptive of the typical development and use of pidgins as inter-ethnic trade languages.

While Tok Pisin's name in the language is {{lang|tpi|Tok Pisin}}, it is also called '''New Guinea Pidgin'''&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[#ntbbjk|Nupela Testamen bilong Bikpela Jisas Kraist]], 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; in English. Papua New Guinean [[English language|anglophones]] almost invariably refer to Tok Pisin as ''Pidgin'' when speaking English.&lt;ref&gt;The published court reports of Papua New Guinea refer to Tok Pisin as "Pidgin": see for example ''Schubert v The State'' [1979] PNGLR 66.&lt;/ref&gt; However, professional linguists prefer to use the term ''Tok Pisin'', as this is considered a distinct language in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/tokp1240 ''Glottolog'' entry for Tok Pisin] (itself evidence that the linguistic community considers it a language in its own right, and prefers to name it ''Tok Pisin''), as well as numerous references therein.&lt;/ref&gt; The language can no longer be considered a [[pidgin]] strictly speaking: it is now a first language for numerous people, and is not simply a ''[[lingua franca]]'' to facilitate communication with speakers of other languages.

==Classification==

The Tok Pisin language is a result of Pacific Islanders intermixing, when people speaking numerous different languages were sent to work on plantations in Queensland and various islands (see [[South Sea Islander]] and [[Blackbirding]]). The labourers began to develop a pidgin, drawing vocabulary primarily from English, but also from [[German language|German]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and their own [[Austronesian languages]] (perhaps especially [[Kuanua language|Kuanua]], that of the [[Tolai people|Tolai]] people of [[East New Britain]]).

This English-based pidgin evolved into Tok Pisin in [[German New Guinea]] (where the German-based creole [[Unserdeutsch language|Unserdeutsch]] was also spoken). It became a widely used lingua franca&amp;nbsp;– and language of interaction between rulers and ruled, and among the ruled themselves who did not share a common vernacular. Tok Pisin and the closely related [[Bislama]] in [[Vanuatu]] and [[Pijin]] in the [[Solomon Islands]], which developed in parallel, have traditionally been treated as varieties of a single Melanesian Pidgin English or "Neo-Melanesian" language. The flourishing of the mainly English-based Tok Pisin in German New Guinea (despite the language of the metropolitan power being German) is to be contrasted with [[Hiri Motu]], the lingua franca of [[Territory of Papua|Papua]], which was derived not from English but from [[Motu language|Motu]], the vernacular of the indigenous people of the [[Port Moresby]] area.

==Official status==
Along with [[English language|English]] and [[Hiri Motu]], Tok Pisin is one of the three official languages of Papua New Guinea. It is frequently the language of debate in the [[National Parliament of Papua New Guinea|national parliament]]. Most government documents are produced in English, but public information campaigns are often partially or entirely in Tok Pisin. While English is the main language in the education system, some schools use Tok Pisin in the first three years of elementary education to promote early literacy.

==Regional variations==
There are considerable variations in vocabulary and grammar in various parts of Papua New Guinea, with distinct dialects in the New Guinea Highlands, the north coast of Papua New Guinea (Pidgin speakers from [[Finschhafen]] speak rather quickly and often have difficulty making themselves understood elsewhere) and the [[New Guinea Islands]]. The variant spoken on [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] and [[Buka, Papua New Guinea|Buka]] is moderately distinct from that of [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] and [[East New Britain]] but is much closer to that than it is to the [[Pijin]] spoken in the rest of the Solomon Islands.

==Alphabet==
The Tok Pisin alphabet contains 22 [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]], five of which are [[vowel]]s, and four [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Melanesian Pidgin and Tok Pisin: Proceedings of the First International Conference on Pidgins and Creoles in Melanesia|p=372|last=Mundhenk|first=Norm|title=Linguistic Decisions in the Tok Pisin Bible|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letters are (vowels in bold):
:'''a''', b, d, '''e''', f, g, h, '''i''', j, k, l, m, n, '''o''', p, r, s, t, '''u''', v, w, y

The four digraphs note [[diphthong]]s, as well as certain consonants:
:{{angbr|'''ai'''}}, {{angbr|'''au'''}}, {{angbr|'''oi'''}} and {{angbr|ng}} (used for both {{IPA|/ŋ/}} and {{IPA|/ŋɡ/}})

==Phonology==
Tok Pisin, like many pidgins and creoles, has a simpler [[phonology]] than the [[superstratum|superstrate]] language. It has 17 [[consonant]]s and 5 [[vowel]]s.&lt;ref name="Smith2008"&gt;Smith, Geoffrey. 2008.

In Burridge, Kate, and Bernd Kortmann (eds.), ''Varieties of English, Vol.3: The Pacific and Australasia''. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter. 188-210.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this varies with the local [[substratum|substrate]] languages and the level of [[education]] of the speaker. The following is the "core" [[phoneme|phonemic]] inventory, common to virtually all varieties of Tok Pisin. More educated speakers, and/or those where the substrate language(s) have larger phoneme inventories, may have as many as 10 distinct vowels.

Nasal plus plosive offsets lose the plosive element in Tok Pisin e.g. English ''hand'' becomes Tok Pisin {{lang|tpi|han}}. Furthermore, [[Final devoicing|voiced plosives become voiceless at the ends of words]], so that English ''pig'' is rendered as {{lang|tpi|pik}} in Tok Pisin.

==Grammar==
The [[verb]] has a suffix, {{lang|tpi|-im}} (from "him") to indicate transitivity ({{lang|tpi|luk}}, look; {{lang|tpi|lukim}}, see). But some verbs, such as {{lang|tpi|kaikai}} "eat", can be transitive without it. Tense is indicated by the separate words {{lang|tpi|bai}} (future) (from "by and by") and {{lang|tpi|bin}} (past) (from "been"). The present progressive tense is indicated by the word {{lang|tpi|stap}}&amp;nbsp;– e.g. "eating" is {{lang|tpi|kaikai stap}} (or this can be seen as having a "food stop").

The [[noun]] does not indicate number, though pronouns do.

[[Adjective]]s usually take the suffix {{lang|tpi|-pela}} (now often pronounced {{lang|tpi|-pla}}, though more so for pronouns, and {{lang|tpi|-pela}} for adjectives; from "fellow") when modifying nouns; an exception is {{lang|tpi|liklik}} "little".&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|tpi|Liklik}} can also be used as an [[adverb]] meaning "slightly", as in {{lang|tpi|dispela bikpela liklik ston}}, "this slightly big stone".&lt;/ref&gt; It is also found on numerals and determiners:
:Tok Pisin: "{{lang|tpi|wanpela}}"	 → English: "one"
:Tok Pisin: "{{lang|tpi|tupela}}"	 → English: "two"
:Tok Pisin: "{{lang|tpi|dispela boi}}"	→ English: "this bloke"

[[Pronoun]]s show [[grammatical person|person]], [[grammatical number|number]], and [[clusivity]]. The paradigm varies depending on the local languages; [[dual grammatical number|dual number]] is common, while the [[trial (grammatical number)|trial]] is less so. The largest Tok Pisin pronoun inventory is,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Verhaar|first1=John W.M.|title=Toward a reference grammar of Tok Pisin : an experiment in corpus linguistics|date=1995|publisher=[[University of Hawaii]] Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=9780824816728|pages=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reduplication]] is very common in Tok Pisin. Sometimes it is used as a method of derivation; sometimes words just have it. Some words are distinguished only by reduplication: {{lang|tpi|sip}} "ship", {{lang|tpi|sipsip}} "sheep".

There are only two proper [[preposition]]s: {{lang|tpi|bilong}} (from "belong"), which means "of" or "for", and {{lang|tpi|long}} (from "along"), which means everything else.
Tok Pisin: "{{lang|tpi|Mipela i bin go long blekmaket}}". → English: "We went to the black market".
Tok Pisin: "{{lang|tpi|Ki bilong yu}}" → English: "your key"
Tok Pisin: "{{lang|tpi|Ol bilong Godons}}". → English: "They are from Gordon's". (ibid. 640f).
Some [[phrase]]s are used as prepositions, such as ''long namel (bilong)'', "in the middle of".

Several of these features derive from the common grammatical norms of [[Austronesian languages]]&lt;ref&gt;The language [[Tolai language|Tolai]] is {{citation needed span|often named|date=February 2018}} as having had an important influence on early Tok Pisin.&lt;/ref&gt; – although usually in a simplified form. Other features, such as [[word order]], are however closer to English.

Sentences which have a 3rd person subject often put the word ''i'' just before the verb. This may or may not be written separate from the verb, occasionally written as a prefix. Although the word is thought to be derived from "he" or "is", it is not itself a pronoun or a verb but a grammatical marker used in particular constructions, e.g., "{{lang|tpi|Kar i tambu long hia}}" is "car forbidden here", i.e., "no parking".

===Tense and aspect===
Past tense: marked by "{{lang|tpi|bin}}" (from English 'been'):
Tok Pisin: "{{lang|tpi|Na praim minista i bin tok olsem}}".
English:    "And the prime minister spoke thus". (Romaine 1991: 629)

Continuative same tense is expressed through: verb + "i stap".
Tok Pisin: "{{lang|tpi|Em i slip i stap}}".
English:    "He/She is sleeping". (ibid.: 631)

Completive or perfective aspect expressed through the word "pinis" (from English: finish):
Tok Pisin: "{{lang|tpi|Em i lusim bot pinis}}".
English:   "He had got out of the boat". (Mühlhäusler 1984: 462).

Transitive words are expressed through "-im" (from English: him):
Tok Pisin: "{{lang|tpi|Yu pinisim stori nau.}}"
English:    "Finish your story now!". (ibid.: 640).

Future is expressed through the word "bai" (from English: by and by):
Tok Pisin: "{{lang|tpi|Em bai ol i go long rum}}"
English:   "They will go to their rooms now. (Mühlhäusler 1991: 642).

==Development of Tok Pisin==

Tok Pisin is a language that developed out of regional dialects of the languages of the local inhabitants and English, brought into the country when English speakers arrived. There were four phases in the development of Tok Pisin that were laid out by Loreto Todd.
#Casual contact between English speakers and local people developed a marginal pidgin
#Pidgin English was used between the local people. The language expanded from the users' mother tongue
#As the interracial contact increased the vocabulary expanded according to the dominant language.
#In areas where English was the official language a depidginization occurred (Todd, 1990)

Tok Pisin is also known as a "mixed" language. This means that it consists of characteristics of different languages. Tok Pisin obtained most of its vocabulary from the English language, ''i.e.'', English is its [[lexifier]]. The origin of the syntax is a matter of debate. Hymes (Hymes 1971b: 5) claims that the syntax is from the substratum languages, ''i.e.'', the languages of the local peoples. (Hymes 1971b: 5). [[Derek Bickerton]]'s analysis of creoles, on the other hand, claims that the syntax of creoles is imposed on the grammarless pidgin by its first native speakers: the children who grow up exposed to only a pidgin rather than a more developed language such as one of the local languages or English. In this analysis, the original syntax of creoles is in some sense the default grammar humans are born with.

Pidgins are less elaborated than non-Pidgin languages. Their typical characteristics found in Tok Pisin are:

#A smaller vocabulary which leads to metaphors to supply lexical units:
#*Smaller vocabulary:
#*:Tok Pisin: "vot"; English: "election" (n) and "vote" (v)
#*:Tok Pisin: "hevi"; English: "heavy" (adj) and "weight" (n)
#*[[Metaphor]]s:
#*:Tok Pisin: "skru bilong han" (screw of the arm); English: "[[elbow]]"
#*:Tok Pisin: "skru bilong lek" (screw of the leg); English: "[[knee]]" (Just "skru" almost always indicates the knee. In liturgical contexts, "brukim skru" is "kneel").
#*:Tok Pisin: "gras bilong het" (grass of the head); English: "hair" (Hall, 1966: 90f) (Most commonly just "gras"&amp;nbsp;– see note on "skru bilong lek" above).
#*[[Circumlocution|Periphrases]]:
#*:Tok Pisin: "nambawan pikinini bilong misis kwin" (literally “first child of [[Elizabeth II|Mrs Queen]]”); English: [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-charles/9654071/Prince-of-Wales-nambawan-pikinini-visits-Papua-New-Guinea.html|title=Prince of Wales, 'nambawan pikinini', visits Papua New Guinea|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#A reduced grammar: lack of [[copula (linguistics)|copula]], [[determiner (linguistics)|determiners]]; reduced set of [[prepositions]], and [[grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]]
#Less differentiated phonology: {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[f]}} are not distinguished in Tok Pisin (they are in free variation). The [[Sibilant consonant|sibilants]] {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/z/}}, {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, {{IPA|/ʒ/}}, {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, and {{IPA|/dʒ/}} are also not distinguished.
#:All of the English words "fish", "peach", "feast" or "peace" would have been realised in Tok Pisin as ''pis''.  In fact the Tok Pisin ''pis'' means "fish" (and usually has more of a short "i" sound, almost like the English word "piss").  English "piss" was reduplicated to keep it distinct: thus ''pispis'' means "urine" or "to urinate".
#:Likewise, ''sip'' in Tok Pisin could have represented English "ship", "jib", "jeep", "sieve" or "chief".  In fact it means "ship".

==Vocabulary==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of British words not widely used in the United States]] --&gt;
Many words in the Tok Pisin language are derived from [[English language|English]] (with [[Australian English|Australian]] influences), indigenous [[Melanesia]]n languages and [[German language|German]] (part of the country was under German rule until 1914).

* as&amp;nbsp;– ''bottom'', ''cause'', ''beginning'' (from "ass"/"arse"). "As ples bilong em" = "his birthplace". "As bilong diwai" = "the stump of a tree".
* bagarap(im)&amp;nbsp;– ''broken'', ''to break down'' (from "bugger up")&amp;nbsp;– (the word is commonly used, with no vulgar undertone, in Tok Pisin and even in Papua New Guinea English).
* bagarap olgeta&amp;nbsp;– ''completely broken''
* balus&amp;nbsp;– ''bird'' or more specifically a pigeon or dove (an Austronesian loan word) - by extension ''aeroplane''
* belhat&amp;nbsp;– ''angry'' (lit. "belly hot")
* belo&amp;nbsp;– ''bell'' - as in "belo bilong lotu" = "Church bell". By extension ''lunch'' or ''midday break'' (from the bell rung to summon diners to the table). A fanciful derivation has been suggested from the "bellows" of horns used by businesses to indicate the beginning of the lunch hour but this seems less likely than the straightforward derivation.
* bilong wanem?&amp;nbsp;– ''why?''
* buai&amp;nbsp;– "betelnut"
* bubu&amp;nbsp;– ''grandparent'', any elderly relation&amp;nbsp;– also ''grandchild''. Possibly from [[Hiri Motu]]&amp;nbsp;– where it is a familiar form of ''tubu'', as in ''tubuna'' or ''tubugu''.
* diwai&amp;nbsp;– ''tree'', ''wood'', ''plant'', ''stick'' etc.
* gat bel&amp;nbsp;– ''pregnant'' (lit. "has belly"; pasin bilong givim bel = fertility)
* gras - ''hair'' (from "grass").
* gut - ''good''
* hamamas / amamas&amp;nbsp;– ''happy''
* hap&amp;nbsp;– a piece of, as in "hap diwai" = a piece of wood. (from "half").
* hapsait -  ''the other side'' (from "half side")
* hap ret - ''purple'' (from "half red")
* haus&amp;nbsp;– ''house'' or ''building''
** hausboi/hausmeri&amp;nbsp;– ''a male/female domestic servant'' - hausboi (or haus boi) can also mean "servants quarters"

*** smol haus&amp;nbsp;– ''toilet/bathroom'' ("small house")
** [[Haus Tambaran|haus tambaran]]&amp;nbsp;– ''traditional Sepik-region house'' with artifacts of ancestors or for honoring ancestors; ''tambaran'' means "ancestor spirit" or "ghost"

* kisim&amp;nbsp;– ''get'', ''take'' (from "get them")
* lotu&amp;nbsp;– ''church'', ''worship'' from Fijian, but sometimes ''sios'' is used for "church"
* mangi/manki&amp;nbsp;– ''small boy'', by extension, ''young man'' (Probably from the English jocular/affectionate usage "monkey", applied to mischievous children, although a derivation from the German "Männchen", meaning "little man" has also been suggested)
* manmeri&amp;nbsp;– ''people'' (from "man", ''man'', and "meri", ''woman'')
* maski&amp;nbsp;– ''it doesn't matter'', ''don't worry about it'' (Probably from German "macht nichts" = "it doesn't matter")
* maus gras&amp;nbsp;– ''moustache'' (lit: "mouth grass").
* meri&amp;nbsp;– ''woman'' (from the English name "Mary"). Also means ''female'', e.g., "bulmakau meri" (lit. "bull cow female") = cow.
* olgeta&amp;nbsp;– ''all'' (from "all together")
* olsem wanem - ''what?'', ''what's going on?''  (Literally "like what"?  Sometimes used as an informal greeting, similar to "what's up?" in English)

* raus, rausim ("rausim" is the transitive form)&amp;nbsp;– ''get out, throw out, remove'' (from German "raus")
* rokrok&amp;nbsp;– ''frog'' (probably onomatopoeic)
* sapos&amp;nbsp;– ''if'' (from "suppose")
* save&amp;nbsp;– ''know'', ''to do habitually'' (from [[Pacific Pidgin English]], but ultimately from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] influenced [[Lingua franca#Historical sense|Lingua franca]], cf. "savvy")
* sit&amp;nbsp;– ''remnant'' (from "shit")
* solwara&amp;nbsp;– ''ocean'' (from "salt water")
* sop - ''soap''; also
** sop bilong tit - ''toothpaste'' (from "soap belong teeth")
** sop bilong gras - ''shampoo'' (from "soap belong hair")
* stap&amp;nbsp;– ''be'', ''live'', ''stay'' (from "stop")
* susa&amp;nbsp;– ''sister'', though nowadays very commonly supplanted by "sista". Some Tok Pisin speakers use "susa" to indicate a sibling of the opposite gender, while a sibling of the same gender as the speaker is a "brata" or "barata".
* susu&amp;nbsp;– ''milk, breasts'', from Malay
* tambu&amp;nbsp;– ''forbidden'', from "taboo", but also means "in-laws" (mother-in-law, brother-in-law, etc.) and other relatives whom one is forbidden to speak to, or mention the name of, in some PNG customs.
* telefon - ''telephone''
* tasol&amp;nbsp;– ''but'', ''only'' (from "that's all")

[[File:Direct translation and transfer translation pyramid.svg|thumb|right|300px|Bernard Vauquois' pyramid showing comparative depths of intermediary representation with [[interlingual machine translation]] at the peak, followed by transfer-based, then [[Dictionary-based machine translation|direct translation]].]]
'''Transfer-based machine translation''' is a type of [[machine translation]] (MT). It is currently one of the most widely used methods of machine translation. In contrast to the simpler [[Dictionary-based machine translation|direct model]] of MT, transfer MT breaks translation into three steps: analysis of the source language text to determine its grammatical structure, transfer of the resulting structure to a structure suitable for generating text in the target language, and finally generation of this text. Transfer-based MT systems are thus capable of using knowledge of the source and target languages.&lt;ref name="slp"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Daniel |last1=Jurafsky |first2=James H. |last2=Martin |title=Speech and Language Processing |publisher=Pearson |year=2009 |pages=906–908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==

Both transfer-based and interlingua-based machine translation have the same idea: to make a translation it is necessary to have an intermediate representation that captures the "meaning" of the original sentence in order to generate the correct translation. In interlingua-based MT this intermediate representation must be independent of the languages in question, whereas in transfer-based MT, it has some dependence on the language pair involved.

The way in which transfer-based machine translation systems work varies substantially, but in general they follow the same pattern: they apply sets of linguistic rules which are defined as correspondences between the structure of the source language and that of the target language. The first stage involves analysing the input text for [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]] (and sometimes [[semantics]]) to create an internal representation. The translation is generated from this representation using both bilingual dictionaries and grammatical rules.

It is possible with this translation strategy to obtain fairly high quality translations, with accuracy in the region of 90%{{vague|date=December 2015}}&lt;!--How is "accuracy" measured? Where does this figure come from?--&gt; (although this is highly dependent on the language pair in question, for example the distance between the two).

== Operation ==

In a rule-based machine translation system the original text is first analysed morphologically and syntactically in order to obtain a syntactic representation. This representation can then be refined to a more abstract level putting emphasis on the parts relevant for translation and ignoring other types of information. The transfer process then converts this final representation (still in the original language) to a representation of the same level of abstraction in the target language. These two representations are referred to as "intermediate" representations. From the target language representation, the stages are then applied in reverse.

== Analysis and transformation ==

Various methods of analysis and transformation can be used before obtaining the final result. Along with these statistical approaches may be augmented generating hybrid systems. The methods which are chosen and the emphasis depends largely on the design of the system, however, most systems include at least the following stages:

* '''Morphological analysis'''. Surface forms of the input text are classified as to part-of-speech (e.g. noun, verb, etc.) and sub-category (number, gender, tense, etc.). All of the possible "analyses" for each surface form are typically made output at this stage, along with the [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]] of the word.
* '''Lexical categorisation'''. In any given text some of the words may have more than one [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], causing [[ambiguity]] in analysis. Lexical categorisation looks at the context of a word to try to determine the correct meaning in the context of the input. This can involve [[part-of-speech tagging]] and [[word sense disambiguation]].
* '''Lexical transfer'''. This is basically dictionary translation; the source language lemma (perhaps with sense information) is looked up in a bilingual dictionary and the translation is chosen.
* '''Structural transfer'''. While the previous stages deal with words, this stage deals with larger constituents, for example [[phrase]]s and [[chunk (information)|chunks]]. Typical features of this stage include concordance of gender and number, and re-ordering of words or phrases.
* '''Morphological generation'''. From the output of the structural transfer stage, the target language surface forms are generated.

== Transfer types ==

One of the main features of transfer-based machine translation systems is a phase that "transfers" an intermediate representation of the text in the original language to an intermediate representation of text in the target language. This can work at one of two levels of linguistic analysis, or somewhere in between. The levels are:

* '''Superficial transfer (or syntactic)'''. This level is characterised by transferring "syntactic structures" between the source and target languages. It is suitable for languages in the same family or of the same type, for example in the [[Romance languages]] between Spanish, Catalan, French, Italian, etc.
* '''Deep transfer (or semantic)'''. This level constructs a semantic representation that is dependent on the source language. This representation can consist of a series of structures which represent the meaning. In these transfer systems predicates are typically produced. The translation also typically requires structural transfer. This level is used to translate between more distantly related languages (e.g. Spanish-English or Spanish-Basque, etc.)

The '''Tsouic languages''' (also known as the '''Central Formosan languages''') are three [[Formosan languages]], [[Tsou language|Tsou]] proper and the Southern languages [[Kanakanabu language|Kanakanabu]] and [[Saaroa language|Saaroa]]. The Southern Tsouic languages of Kanakanabu and Saaroa have the smallest phonemic inventories out of all the Formosan languages, with each language having only 13 consonants and 4 vowels (Blust 2009:165).&lt;ref name="Blust"&gt;Blust, Robert A. ''The Austronesian Languages''. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, Australian National University, 2009. {{ISBN|0-85883-602-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-85883-602-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These two languages are highly endangered, as many Southern Tsouic speakers are shifting to [[Bunun language|Bunun]] and [[Mandarin Chinese]].

The Proto-Tsouic language was reconstructed by Japanese linguist Shigeru Tsichida in 1976, and is supported by Blust (1999) and Li (2008). However, Chang (2006)&lt;ref name="Chang2006"&gt;Chang, Henry Yungli. 2006. "Rethinking the Tsouic Subgroup Hypothesis: A Morphosyntactic Perspective." In Chang, H., Huang, L. M., Ho, D. (eds.). ''Streams converging into an ocean: Festschrift in honor of Professor Paul Jen-Kuei Li on his 70th birthday.'' Taipei: Institute of Linguistics, Academia Sinica.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ross (2009)&lt;ref name="Ross2009"&gt;Ross, Malcolm. 2009. "Proto Austronesian verbal morphology: A reappraisal." In Alexander Adelaar and Andrew Pawley (eds.). ''Austronesian historical linguistics and culture history: a festschrift for Robert Blust''. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt; deny that Tsouic is a valid group; Ross places Southern Tsouic within ''Nuclear Austronesian'' (the family of the various proto-Austronesian reconstructions), but the [[Tsou language]] as a more divergent branch.
