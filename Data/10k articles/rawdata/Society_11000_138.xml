The rise in conversion to Sunni Islam is partly a result of [[anti-Arab]] racism, the perceived crackdown on the Arab identity of the region and the view that Sunni Islam is closer to the Arab roots of the Ahwazi Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Mamoon Alabbasi|title=Iran's Ahwazi Arab minority: dissent against 'discrimination'|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/irans-ahwazi-arab-minority-dissent-against-discrimination-1658579305|accessdate=28 December 2015|work=[[Middle East Eye]]|date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=ISABEL COLES|title=Insight: Iran's Arab minority drawn into Middle East unrest|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-arabs-insight-idUSBRE97E0O620130815|accessdate=28 December 2015|work=Reuters|date=15 Aug 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''International Campaign for Sunni Prisoners in Iran'' (ICSPI), the crackdown is due to the Iranian government's alarm at "the rise of Sunni Islam among the Ahwazi Arabs in the traditionally Shia-majority Khuzestan province."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=[[Peter Tatchell]]|title=Sunni Muslims living in fear in Iran as state-sponsored persecution ramps up|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/sunni-muslims-living-fear-iran-state-sponsored-persecution-ramps-1484673|accessdate=28 December 2015|work=International Business Times|date=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these conversions, Sunni Arabs across the Middle East have increasingly shown support for the Ahwazi cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=ISABEL COLES|title=Insight: Iran's Arab minority drawn into Middle East unrest|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-arabs-insight-idUSBRE97E0O620130815|accessdate=28 December 2015|work=Reuters|date=15 Aug 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alak''' or '''Hrlak''' are an [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] ethnic group of southern [[Laos]], living mainly in [[Salavan Province]].  They speak the [[Alak language]].  Little is known of their history, though as an [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]]-speaking group, their origin is presumably in the Central Highlands of [[Vietnam]].

==Culture==
Nowadays, most Alak live in scattered villages of between ten and sixty houses, traditionally built in a circular pattern around a [[communal house]].  Houses are normally built on stilts about a metre high.  The main diet and trading staple is [[rice]], farmed with the [[slash-and-burn]] method, although small game, fish, and various plants and mushrooms provide additional food.

Religious beliefs involve a range of supernatural beings, including spirits of mountains, forests and other natural features.  Most villages have a [[shaman]] who helps cure the sick and predict the future for the village.  The dead are typically buried in [[graveyard]]s in the forest.

'''Brent Evan Newton''' is an American legal scholar, the deputy staff director at the [[United States Sentencing Commission]], and a professor of law. Newton is an adjunct law professor at [[Georgetown University Law Center]] and [[Washington College of Law]] at [[American University]] and also works as an adjunct professor of [[political science]] and [[criminal justice]] at the [[University of Maryland]].

Newton graduated from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and [[Columbia Law School]], where he was a [[James Kent Scholar]] and a Senior Editor of the [[Columbia Law Review]].&lt;ref name=alr&gt;{{cite web|title=Brent E. Newton Profle|url=http://ualr.edu/law/brent-e-newton/|website=ualr.edu/law|publisher=William H. Bowen School of Law|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from law school in 1992, he clerked for Judge [[Carolyn Dineen King]] of the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]].&lt;ref name=alr/&gt; After his clerkship, Newton worked as a public defender in both the state and federal systems.&lt;ref name=ussc&gt;{{cite web|title=Sentencing Commission bios|url=http://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/training/CLE/bio_reports.pdf|website=ussc.gov|publisher=United States Sentencing Commission|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that role, Newton also represented death row inmates in the [[American South]].&lt;ref name=alr/&gt;

Newton has argued before the [[United States Supreme Court]]. In 2008, Newton argued ''Gonzalez v. United States.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gonzalez v.

==Scholarship==
===American legal education===
In "Preaching What They Don’t Practice: Why Law Faculties’ Preoccupation with Impractical Scholarship and Devaluation of Practical Competencies Obstruct Reform in the Legal Academy," Newton criticizes the legal academy's reliance upon law review articles for tenure consideration, rather than preparing students to practice law.&lt;ref name=blog&gt;{{cite web|title=Thank you Brent Newton – American Legal Education is Worthless|url=https://randazza.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/thank-you-brent-newton-american-legal-education-is-worthless/|publisher=The Legal Satyricon|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bain&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bainbridge|first1=Stephen|title=The Wrong Stuff: What Law Schools Value in Law Prof Candidates|url=http://www.professorbainbridge.com/professorbainbridgecom/2010/08/the-wrong-stuff-what-law-schools-value-in-law-prof-candidates.html|publisher=professorbainbridge.com|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=taxprof&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caron|first1=Paul|title=Newton: How Law Profs' Preoccupation with 'Impractical Scholarship' Obstructs Legal Education Reform|url=http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2010/08/newton-how-law-profs.html|publisher=TaxProf Blog|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death penalty===
Newton has written about the death penalty with particular emphasis on the Texas system in which he practiced for many years. In “Capital Punishment: Texas Could Learn a Lot from Florida" (1998), Newton surmised that Texas’s high actual execution numbers could be attributed to three factors at that time: the way judges were elected, a weak public defender system, and a flawed jury system that didn’t allow for the consideration of mitigating evidence.&lt;ref name=crockett&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crockett|first1=Zachary|title=Why Has Texas Executed So Many Inmates?|url=http://priceonomics.com/why-has-texas-executed-so-many-inmates/|publisher=Priceonomics|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law review articles===
Newton wrote for [[SCOTUSblog]] on the value of law review articles for [[United States Supreme Court]] justices.&lt;ref name=scotus&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newton|first1=Brent|title=Scholar’s highlight: Law review articles in the eyes of the Justices|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/04/scholar%E2%80%99s-highlight-law-review-articles-in-the-eyes-of-the-justices/|publisher=SCOTUSblog|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Newton, about half of all Supreme Court opinions cited at least one law review article in the 1970s and 1980s. Since 2000, however, the rate is" just 37 percent — even as Supreme Court opinions have grown longer and more elaborate."&lt;ref name=liptak&gt;{{cite web|last1=Liptak|first1=Adam|title=The Lackluster Reviews That Lawyers Love to Hate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/us/law-scholarships-lackluster-reviews.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Carnival''''' is a 2006 [[science fiction]] novel by [[Elizabeth Bear]]. It was nominated for a [[Philip K. Dick Award]], a [[Locus Award|''Locus'' Award]] and a [[Lambda Literary Award]].

==Setting==
In the future, control of the preservation of interplanetary natural resources has been given over to ecological [[artificial intelligence]]s called the Governors, who enforce [[carbon neutrality]] with strict population controls and energy consumption regulations, and even calculated [[genocide]] called "assessment". The parliament of the [[Fascism|fascistic]] Old Earth Colonial Coalition, ruthless in its own support of the AIs, serves as a buffer to prevent unnecessary disruption to humanity. With colonists having left Earth generations before seeking freedom from these restrictions, the Coalition has now, for decades, been subsuming autonomous worlds back under its control. One of these is New Amazonia, a lush planet on which a [[matriarchy|matriarchal]], primarily lesbian society has risen up amidst abandoned alien technology that includes a seemingly inexhaustible power supply. The Amazonian women are aggressive and warlike, but also pragmatic and defensive of their freedom from the male-dominated Coalition that seeks to conquer them. Distrustful of male aggression, they subjugate their men, a minority they seem to tolerate solely for reproduction and labor.&lt;ref name="io9"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/387818/environmental-fascists-fight-gun-loving-lesbians-for-alien-technology |title=Environmental Fascists Fight Gun-Loving Lesbians for Alien Technology |publisher=[[io9]] |first=Annalee |last=Newitz |authorlink=Annalee Newitz |date=May 6, 2008 |accessdate=January 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SF Site"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sfsite.com/05b/ca248.htm |title=''Carnival'' by Elizabeth Bear |first=Paul |last=Kincaid |work=[[SF Site]] |date=2007 |accessdate=January 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IROSF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irosf.com/q/zine/article/10373 |title=Review: ''Carnival'' by Elizabeth Bear |first=Joe |last=Tokamak |work=[[The Internet Review of Science Fiction]] |date=March 2007 |accessdate=January 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A diplomatic mission to the matriarchal planet New Amazonia reunites ex-lovers Vincent Katherinessen and Michelangelo Kusanagi-Jones after a separation of 17 years. Arriving in the capital city of Penthesilea, the men are ostensibly repatriating looted artwork, but in truth the ambassador-spies have been tasked with obtaining the Amazonians' secret energy technology by any means necessary, and doing what they can to facilitate a Coalition conquest. However, both Vincent (a master of observation) and Angelo (a trained liar and fighter) each have hidden plans to undermine their own mission. Meanwhile, multiple factions among the Amazonians are engaged in covert political intrigues rooted in the gender dynamics of their society.&lt;ref name="io9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SF Site"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IROSF"/&gt;

==Characters==
* Vincent Katherinessen, OECC senior diplomat, originally from the planet Ur
* Michelangelo Kusanagi-Jones, Vincent's attaché and former partner, born on Old Earth
* Lesa Praetoria, deputy chief of Security Directorate of New Amazonia
* Claude Singapore, Prime Minister of New Amazonia
* Maiju Montevideo, Claude's wife
* Elena Pretoria, Lesa's mother
* Katya Pretoria, Lesa's daughter
* Julian Pretoria, Lesa's son
* Robert, the father of Lesa's children
* Kii, an alien intelligence residing in Penthesilea

==Themes==
[[Annalee Newitz]] of [[io9]] explained that, faced with strict population controls, the Earth-centric humans in ''Carnival'' have become obsessed with reproduction, and have outlawed homosexuality as directly opposing this function.&lt;ref name="io9"/&gt; She wrote that "Bear's idea that an eco-regime like this would breed conservatism rather than progressivism is really quite smart", and praised the author's "careful attention to how ideologies might evolve over time".&lt;ref name="io9"/&gt; Paul Kincaid of ''[[SF Site]]'' noted that Vincent and Michelangelo "are homosexuals from a world whose regressive and repressive mores mean that this could get them killed, but for the fact that they are exceptionally well-skilled at their job and also well-practiced in deception".&lt;ref name="SF Site"/&gt; Of the New Amazonian civilization, Newitz wrote:

{{Quote|[''Carnival'' is] a novel where all the traditional ideas of liberal science fiction like matriarchies and ecotopias are turned on their heads. When lesbians rule a planet, they don't create peace and harmony: they become obsessed with guns and honor and dueling. They enslave all men (except homosexuals, whom they call "gentles"), using them to breed and for labor. And they engage in brutal guerilla warfare to gain power in government.&lt;ref name="io9"/&gt;}}

Explaining that the Amazonian women subjugate their men as a means to diffuse the potential of male aggression, Kincaid compared the matriarchal premise to "the feminist science fiction of twenty or perhaps thirty years ago".&lt;ref name="SF Site"/&gt; Joe Tokamak of ''[[The Internet Review of Science Fiction]]'' called the novel "a fantasy of societal alternatives reminiscent of the sixties or seventies" and yet "fresh, sophisticated material".&lt;ref name="IROSF"/&gt; He also noted how Bear's contrast of the societal differences between the New Amazonians and their visitors initiates conflict that evolves as the characters interact.&lt;ref name="IROSF"/&gt;

==Critical reception==
In 2007, ''Carnival'' was nominated for a [[Philip K. Dick Award]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.locusmag.com/2007/01_PKD_Finalists.html |title=Online News: Philip K.

Newitz wrote that the novel "manages to do what so few SF novels can ... it offers an intriguing, intellectually-rewarding glimpse at one human possible future while also telling a rip-roaring yarn."&lt;ref name="io9"/&gt; Liz Bourke of ''[[Tor.com]]'' called it "a vivid book, vital and alive", and cited it as her favorite of Bear's science fiction novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tor.com/2015/11/06/where-to-start-with-the-work-of-elizabeth-bear/ |title=Where To Start with the Work of Elizabeth Bear |work=[[Tor.com]] |first=Liz |last=Bourke |date=November 6, 2015 |accessdate=January 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kincaid wrote, "Strip away the sexual politics overlaid on the story, which add complexity to the plot but not necessarily depth to the novel, and this is a book that could have come straight from the so-called [[Golden Age of Science Fiction|golden age]]."&lt;ref name="SF Site"/&gt; Though suggesting that "there are too many layers of betrayal and deception for a book of this length", Kincaid wrote that "Bear keeps the whole thing moving at a brisk and satisfying pace ... this is exactly the sort of vivid, pacy novel that used to make science fiction such an exciting genre to read."&lt;ref name="SF Site"/&gt; Writing for ''[[SF Crowsnest]]'', Tomas L. Martin called the characters "interesting and very dynamic", the galactic politics "top-notch" and some of the technology "breathtaking", while noting that the novel occasionally "gets a little bogged down and hard to navigate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfcrowsnest.com/articles/books/2007/Carnival-by-Elizabeth-Bear-11050.php |title=''Carnival'' by Elizabeth Bear |first=Tomas L.|last=Martin |work=[[SF Crowsnest]] |date=January 3, 2007 |accessdate=January 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tokamak praised the "intriguing, three dimensional characters" and the "compelling and complex plot that gradually gets its hooks into the reader and doesn't let go", while calling the resolution "hasty and disconnected from all the misery the characters go through to get there".&lt;ref name="IROSF"/&gt;

In former [[Yugoslavia]], coffee drinking is an important cultural practice. '''[[Coffee culture]]''' has a long history, dating back to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman period]]. The distinct type of coffeehouse in former Yugoslavia is the ''[[kafana]]'', and the traditional form is "[[Turkish coffee]]" (unfiltered).

==History==

===Ottoman period===
Serbs were influenced by Ottoman culture following the Ottoman conquest, and as early as the 16th century, a coffeehouse was in business in [[Dorćol]], a trading centre in [[Belgrade]] at that time. During this period, coffee was served in [[caravanserai]] and [[meyhane]]. The businesses in Belgrade began to be called ''kafane'' (s. ''kafana'') after 1739, when the Ottomans [[Kingdom of Serbia (1718–39)|regained Serbia from Austria]]. At that time, the most notable kafana was ''Crni orao'' ("The Black Eagle") in Dorćol, mentioned by traveller Kepper, who noted that the kafanas were divided by religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|url=http://www.dw.de/kafane-moderni-sanatorijumi/a-17317242|title=Kafane, moderni sanatorijumi|website=dw.de|accessdate=2015-10-17|date=23 December 2013|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apogee of number of kafanas in Belgrade was in the 19th and 20th centuries.

===Early 20th century===
The kafana was the common meeting place for consultations over village or [[zadruga]] affairs.&lt;ref name="Trouton2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ruth Trouton|title=Peasant Renaissance in Yugoslavia 1900 -1950: A Study of Development of Yugoslavia as Affected by Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hv0g0DheVf4C&amp;pg=PA38|date=5 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-24100-0|pages=38–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, Serb peasant leaders often met in [[kafana]]s, while Croat peasants did not, looking at it as an urban practice, and instead of black coffee drank wine.&lt;ref name="Trouton2013"/&gt; Women were at the time prevented from kafanas by a strong social prohibition.&lt;ref name="Trouton2013"/&gt;
 [[File:Kafana "Tri šešira".jpg|thumb|Kafana ''Tri šešira'' ("Three Hats").]]
In the 1900s, young Serbian nationalists in Belgrade met in the city's kafanas where they openly discussed hatred for Austro-Hungary, and desire for [[Yugoslavism]].&lt;ref name="Doak2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robin S. Doak|title=Assassination at Sarajevo: The Spark That Started World War I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXpegHWR3nkC&amp;pg=PT20|year=2009|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-0-7565-3857-6|pages=20–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gavrilo Princip]], the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassin of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], visited those kafanas&lt;ref name="Doak2009"/&gt; in 1912. The ''Crni konj'' ("Black horse") café in Varoš-kapija quarter was a meeting place for Ottoman Serb refugees and ''pečalbari'' (seasonal workers).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W5RiAAAAMAAJ |title=Sabrana dela|volume=22|publisher=NIP "Jež"|year=1966|first=Branislav Đ|last=Nušić|location=Belgrade|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 20th and 21st century===
In the late 1970s, a new type of drinking establishment first appeared in Yugoslavia: the ''caffe bar'' or colloquially ''kafić''. These bars normally serve [[espresso]] instead of Turkish coffee, tea and soft drinks, as well as a wide selection of alcoholic beverages, but no food. Caffe bars are found in all cities, most shopping centers and at larger gas stations. They have become an essential part of social life as a meeting place for people of all ages, including families with children. University students are among the most frequent patrons of caffe bars. Many people come to caffe bars to smoke cigarettes, which is generally allowed, even indoors.

In big cities, seaside towns and other places visited by tourists, caffe bars have large outdoor seating areas, as well as television screens, mainly for watching live sports. Larger caffe bars are sometimes also [[nightclub]]s, featuring performances by popular local musicians, often in the [[turbo folk]] genre.

[[Kafana]]s continue to operate, especially in Serbia, as a type of restaurant specializing in traditional cuisine and also serving alcohol and coffee. Traditional kafanas and modern caffe bars are separate types of establishment.

==Inter-ethnic bounding==
In [[SR Bosnia and Herzegovina|pre-war Bosnia and Herzegovina]], coffee drinking was one of the traditional forms of inter-ethnic bonding. After the [[Bosnian War]], inter-ethnic coffee drinking is a rare practice, "having a coffee with someone from the other side would therefore signal one's readiness to challenge the post-conflict divisions".&lt;ref name="McGlynn2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claire McGlynn|title=Peace Education in Conflict and Post-Conflict Societies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WqrFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117|date=14 April 2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-62042-1|pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] (CP) and its allies played a role in the [[Labor unions in the United States|United States labor movement]], particularly in the 1930s and 1940s, but never succeeded, with rare exceptions, either in bringing the labor movement around to its agenda or in converting their influence in any particular union into membership gains for the Party. The CP has had only negligible influence in labor since its supporters' defeat in internal union political battles in the aftermath of World War II and the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]]'s (CIO) expulsion of unions in which the party held the most influence in 1950.
{{American socialism |History}}
Historians disagree why the American union movement never formed a labor party and why American workers have never embraced socialist parties in any numbers. Some have argued that a strain of [[American exceptionalism]] made U.S. workers resistant to parties that emphasized [[class struggle]]; others have contended that downplaying political and social agendas for the sake of unity, short-term gains and building strong unions was at the cost of a potential labor party. Others contend instead that the left lost its power to lead the labor movement by what commenters charged were 'ideological zig-zags'. The CP's history within the labor movement support parts of all of these theses.

==Factionalism, zig zags and retreats==
After playing a leading role in the [[United Automobile Workers]]'s (UAW) victories in Flint against General Motors Corporation and against Chrysler Corporation in 1937, the CP found itself under sharp attack from its opponents within the UAW. [[Homer Martin (labor leader)|Homer Martin]], first president of the UAW, sought to drive out all of the left activists within the UAW in order to eliminate any rival contenders for power. Martin brought in [[Jay Lovestone]], former executive secretary of the CP before his expulsion in 1929, as his advisor and installed Lovestone supporters in key positions throughout the union.

Martin only succeeded, however, in bringing about his own downfall. After he failed to persuade the UAW Convention in 1937 to give him authority to fire organizers and eliminate local union newspapers, Martin set out to expel his rivals. After firing or transferring a number of CP members who had played prominent roles in the Flint sit-down strike, Martin first suspended, then expelled, Mortimer and his other opponents on the UAW's Executive Board. The CIO leadership, alarmed by the possibility that sectarian infighting might destroy the UAW, forced Martin to reinstate the Executive Board members. When the reconstituted Executive Board ordered Martin to sever his ties with Lovestone and to submit all his public announcements to it for its approval, he attempted to suspend the majority of the Board, including both his opponents associated with the CP, such as Mortimer, their allies, such as [[Richard Frankensteen]], and the UAW leaders associated with the Socialist Party, such as [[Walter Reuther]].

That nearly split the UAW. After skirmishes at the UAW headquarters and some local unions, the expelled Executive Board members, with the support of the CIO, regained control in 1939 and expelled Martin. He left with about 20,000 members to form his own union, which affiliated with the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL). Lovestone left with him.

The CP was in a particularly strong position at that point: it was the leading player in the Left-Center coalition that had defeated Martin and would have been able to elect [[George Addes]], a close ally of the Party, as President of the UAW if it had pressed the point. But that would have required that the Party defy [[Sidney Hillman]], head of the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]] and the most powerful force within the CIO after Lewis, and [[Philip Murray]], Lewis' protégé and head of the [[Steel Workers Organizing Committee]], who came to the convention to demand the selection of [[R.J. Thomas]], an apolitical Board member who had, until recently, supported Martin, as its candidate to end the factional fighting within the UAW.

According to some reports, when Hillman and Murray could not bring Mortimer and his supporters around, [[Earl Browder]], Chairman of the Communist Party of the USA (CPUSA), came to Cleveland to demand that they support Thomas. Eager not to appear as sectarians and thus endanger their role within the CIO at large, the CP leadership had the Communists within the UAW support Thomas and also permit the elimination of the Vice-President positions that they had held. At the same time, the CP began dissolving its factions within the UAW and dropping its shop papers as it aligned itself even more closely with the New Deal. In the name of labor unity, the CP undertook a tactical retreat.

The CP's conciliatory stance did not, however, protect it from its other factional rivals within the UAW. The working alliance between the CP and the Socialists in the UAW had broken down in 1938 over differences over the CP's support for "collective security," an alliance of the [[Soviet Union]] with the non-fascist nations of the West against Hitler. The Socialist Party, at that time even further left than the CP on many issues, organized a separate caucus within the Executive Board that, from that point forward, opposed the CP and its alliance partners.

===Break with the Roosevelt administration===
The CP made it easier for its opponents by making a number of sudden and shocking changes in policy. After the Hitler-Stalin pact, the CP campaigned vigorously against any U.S. involvement in the war against fascism; a journalist with the CP's Weekly Worker newspaper coined the slogan "The Yanks Ain't Coming" to sum up the Party's position. What is more, the CP now repudiated its Popular Front strategies of the previous four years, attacking President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's administration's efforts to support France and Britain against Germany as a campaign to lead the U.S. into an imperialist war. The federal government responded by arresting [[Earl Browder]] and a number of other CP leaders.

The CP's opponents within the labor movement capitalized on the Party's break with FDR to attack it. James Carey, the president of the [[United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America]] (or UE) who had worked closely with Communist UE officials in the past, now distanced himself from them over their opposition to a third term for Roosevelt. The UAW passed several resolutions condemning both Nazis and Communists at its Conventions.

At the same time that their break with Roosevelt isolated them within the CIO, opponents of the CP outside the labor movement stepped up their attacks on the loyalty of Party members, accusing them, among other things, of engaging in sabotage by supporting strikes of aircraft workers during the UAW's organizing drive in that industry. While some of these accusations, such as those made by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|Dies Committee]] or [[Reader's Digest]], were so wide of the mark as to discredit the accusers, the tide of unfavorable publicity made any association with the CP that much riskier.

The CP also lost ground within the CIO. While the CP believed it could shelter itself within the CIO by continuing to loyally support Lewis, who also opposed a third term for Roosevelt, that reliance on Lewis was misplaced. Lewis was prepared both to use the CP and to get rid of CP members when they no longer served his purposes, as demonstrated by the activities of his lieutenant, Adolph Germer, who actively undercut the CP leadership within the [[International Woodworkers of America]] when sent to assist it in organizing lumber workers in the Northwest in 1940. At the same time Lewis abolished the position of west coast director of the CIO, which Harry Bridges had held, limiting his authority to California.

Whatever protection the CP could have hoped to receive from Lewis evaporated in any event in 1940, when Lewis abruptly resigned from his position as President of the CIO following his baffling decision to support [[Wendell Willkie]] over Roosevelt for President that year. Philip Murray, Lewis' successor as head of the CIO, was determined to stop the spread of the CP's influence in the CIO and to demonstrate to the public at large that the CIO was not controlled by the CP. To that end he insisted on a resolution at the CIO's 1940 conference that condemned Communism, along with Nazism and fascism, as "inimical to the welfare of labor." [[Lee Pressman]], the most highly placed CP ally within the CIO, presented the resolution in his role as secretary of the resolutions committee.

Murray did not, however, insist on banning Communists from the CIO; on the contrary, he had no desire to provoke a public fight over the CP's politics or CP members' role within either the CIO or its affiliates. This suited the Party, which likewise did not want to risk a showdown that could possibly result in either their expulsion or split the CIO. So while internal political disputes kept the battles raging within unions such as the UAW, the UE and the IWA, the CP agreed to a compromise that forced them to accept the label of "totalitarian," but allowed them to maintain their positions within the CIO itself.

Communist influence in labor unions was seen by the Roosevelt administration as a serious threat to US military preparedness. As the US military built up in 1940 and 1941, US Secretary of War Henry Stimson was convinced that labor strikes and slowdowns at key facilities were due to the CPUSA’s efforts to block Franklin Roosevelt’s military preparedness policy.  Strikes at Harville Die-Casting Company, Alcoa, and North American Aviation were widely seen within the Roosevelt administration as communist-inspired for ideological reasons, rather than for better wages and working conditions. The most important strike seen as communist-inspired was at the Allis-Chalmers aircraft plant in Los Angeles on 5 June 1941. The plant built bombers for the U. S. and British governments, and the strike was seen as a serious threat to American aid to the Allies. The federal government seized the plant and army troops forced open paths through the picket lines to allow workers to enter the plant.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Ohly, Industrialists in Olive Drab (Washington: US Army, Center of Military History, 1999) 14-16, 19-30.&lt;/ref&gt;  

==World War II and the no-strike pledge==
The CP's policy toward President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and war changed as soon as Hitler invaded the [[Soviet Union]]. At that point, the CP changed into unqualified supporters for the war effort. For their labor allies, that meant not only unconditional support for a wartime no-strike pledge - which the rest of the labor movement had endorsed to some degree - but also opposition to anything that would compromise anti-fascist unity at home. The CP's opponents within the labor movement would also use CP's sudden change against them in the factional battles of the years to come.

The change in CP policy led to some startlingly inconsistent positions on its part. When [[A. Philip Randolph]], President of the [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]] and the foremost African-American unionist of the time, urged a march on Washington in 1941 to underscore black workers' demands for the elimination of job discrimination in war industries, the CP attacked him relentlessly. This is more than ironic: the CP had championed black workers' rights in the past, even when it complicated their efforts to organize textile workers or miners in the South.

The Party had, however, strong political differences with Randolph, even before it became a supporter of the war: he had resigned as head of the [[National Negro Congress]] and denounced the CP when the CP broke with the Roosevelt Administration. When Hitler attacked the Soviet Union it continued to attack Randolph's proposed March, but now on the ground that it undermined the unity needed to win the war. The CP did not, on the other hand, abandon its support for civil rights, supporting the creation of the Fair Employment Practices Committee and fighting for equal treatment of black workers in the unions in which they had a presence. These battles were particularly fierce within the UAW, many of whose white members had engaged in hate strikes to protest either the hiring or promotion of black workers in their plants and who had engaged in the massive race riots in Detroit in 1943.

That battle inevitably became part of the larger battle between the Addes and Frankensteen group within the UAW, which the CP supported, and the Walter Reuther-led opposition. While each faction supported creation of a 'minority department' within the UAW to deal with the special needs of black and other minority workers and the education of UAW members generally, they disagreed over whether the head of that department should always be African-American. In the end, the 1943 UAW Convention defeated both sides' proposals on a voice vote after a heated debate in which many delegates opposed taking any stand on civil rights as being outside the union's economic sphere.

The CP was more vocal and consistent in supporting the wartime no-strike pledge - a position that ultimately cost it much support within the labor movement. The CIO and the AFL each supported the pledge in general, particularly after the furor strikes in the aircraft industry and at [[Allis-Chalmers Company]] had provoked in the years immediately before the United States' entry into the war. But the CP and its allies now embraced the pledge with such fervor, at the expense of traditional union principles some said, that it made the Party's commitment to unionism suspect. Harry Bridges of the International Longshore Workers Union (ILWU) called for a speedup of the pace of work - which may not have been inconsistent with the union's goal of controlling the way that work was done on the docks - but certainly sounded strange coming from the union that had previous relentlessly fought employers on the issue. Bridges, Joseph Curran of the NMU and Julius Emspak of the UE even supported a proposal by Roosevelt in 1944 to militarize some civilian workplaces, but retreated when the rest of the CIO executive board reacted furiously against it.

The CP also supported [[piecework]] systems in the electrical and automobile industries, which it defended as both necessary to boost production and a way to improve workers' earnings under the wartime wage control systems imposed by the [[National War Labor Board (1942–1945)|War Labor Board]], but which were still anathema, particularly to unionists in mass production industries such as automobile manufacturing. Walter Reuther used this issue to great effect against the CP and its allies at the UAW's 1943 Convention, where his slate fell just short of defeating Addes and Frankensteen.

On the other hand, the CP mended fences with [[Sidney Hillman]] and others within the CIO leadership by coming out strongly in support of Roosevelt for the duration of the war and working diligently in the CIO's political efforts. The Party also grew tremendously during the war years and even took the step, in the wake of the formal alliance between the United States and the Soviet Union, to formally dissolve itself, or at least rename itself as the Communist Political Association in 1944.

That attempt to submerge itself in the broader coalition to support Roosevelt and the Soviet Union probably did more to damage the Party's standing with many of its most reliable supporters than to make it look safe or respectable to people outside the Party. The Comintern changed direction a year later, when it ejected Browder from the Party, reestablished the CPUSA and installed Foster as its Chairman.  More money less work.

==The post-war era and expulsion from the CIO==
The CP suffered a series of setbacks in the immediate postwar era. The most serious was their complete rout in the UAW, where Walter Reuther's slate finally triumphed in 1947 after years of inconclusive struggles with the Addes and Frankensteen faction. Reuther subsequently drove all of his principal CP adversaries out of the UAW, using one of the provisions of the newly enacted [[Taft-Hartley Act]] to complete the process.

In 1946 the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] took control of both the House and Senate. That Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act, which, among other things, required all union officers to sign an affidavit that they were not Communists in order for the union to bring a case before the NLRB. Reuther had three of the CP-leaning leaders of UAW Local 248 in Milwaukee - one of the CP's bastions and including some of Reuther's bitterest enemies - expelled for their refusal to sign the oath.

The CIO itself was slower to join the purge. Persons associated with the CP did, in fact, exercise a good deal of influence in a number of CIO unions in the 1940s, both in the leadership of unions such as the [[International Longshore and Warehouse Union|ILWU]], [[United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America|UE]], [[Transport Workers Union of America]] and [[International Fur &amp; Leather Workers Union|Fur and Leather Workers]] and in staff positions in a number of other unions. Those persons had an uneasy relationship with Murray while he headed the CIO. He mistrusted the radicalism of some of their positions and was innately far more sympathetic to anti-Communist organizations such as the [[Association of Catholic Trade Unionists]]. He also believed, however, that making anti-Communism a crusade would only strengthen labor's enemies and the rival AFL at a time when labor unity was most important.

Murray might have let the status quo continue, even while Reuther and others within the CIO attacked Communists in their unions, if the CPUSA had not chosen to back [[Henry A. Wallace]]'s [[third political party|third party]] campaign for President in 1948. That, and an increasingly bitter division over whether the CIO should support the [[Marshall Plan]], brought Murray to the conclusion that peaceful co-existence with Communists within the CIO was impossible.

Murray began by removing Bridges from his position as the California Regional Director for the CIO and firing Lee Pressman as General Counsel of both the Steelworkers and the CIO. Anti-communist unionists then took the battle to the City and State Councils, where they attempted to oust Communist leaders who did not support the CIO's position on the Marshall Plan and Wallace. A number of former allies or members of the Party, including [[Mike Quill]] of the [[Transport Workers Union of America|Transport Workers]] and [[Joseph Curran]] of the [[National Maritime Union]], severed their ties with the CP and fired the CP members on their staffs during this time.

After the 1948 election, the CIO took the fight one step further in 1950, expelling the ILWU, the [[Western Federation of Miners|Mine, Mill &amp; Smelter Workers Union]], the Farm Equipment Union, the Food and Tobacco Workers, and the Fur and Leather Workers, while creating a new union, the [[International Union of Electrical Workers]], to replace the UE, which left the CIO rather than purge its leadership. The CP, which once held positions of influence at every level within the CIO and many of its affiliates, was now driven out of the CIO.

==The years since==
The CP has, for all effects and purposes, no presence in or influence on the American union movement. Some of the expelled unions, such as the ILWU and UE, survived outside the AFL-CIO, maintaining their political principles, in particular solidarity with labor's struggles around the world and greater rank-and-file control of the union, but have no political relationship with the CP and only marginal influence within the labor movement as a whole. The ILWU has since reaffiliated with the AFL-CIO. Others, such as Mine, Mill, survived; it later merged with its ideological opponent, the Steelworkers, just as the Farm Equipment union eventually was absorbed by the UE. Others, such as the Food and Tobacco Workers, disappeared.

To the extent that the CP has had any residual effect on the American union movement, after helping to organize some industrial unions, it's only legacy has been its opposition to racial discrimination and its commitment to organizing the lowest-paid workers. "Old left" unionists played an important role in organizing hospital workers into District 1199 in New York in the 1950s and 1960s; CP veterans also contributed to the organizing successes of the [[United Farm Workers]]. But by the 1950s and 1960s, present and former members of the CPUSA did not advertise their membership or try to use organizing victories to recruit new members. The Party by that time was too weak, membership having declined fairly continuously since early in the Eisenhower (and McCarthy) era.

'''Conventional wisdom''' is the body of ideas or explanations generally accepted as true by the public and/or by experts in a field.

==Origin of the term==
The term is often credited to the economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], who used it in his 1958 book ''[[The Affluent Society]]'':&lt;ref name="Leibovich"&gt;''E.g.,'' [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/weekinreview/09leibovich.html Mark Leibovich, "A Scorecard on Conventional Wisdom", ''N.Y. Times'' (March 9, 2008)].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|It will be convenient to have a name for the ideas which are esteemed at any time for their acceptability, and it should be a term that emphasizes this predictability.  I shall refer to these ideas henceforth as the conventional wisdom.&lt;ref name="Galbraith"&gt;John Kenneth Galbraith, ''The Affluent Society'' (1958), chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the term dates back to at least 1838.&lt;ref name="GBS-Inquiry"&gt;{{cite book

 |first=Henry Whiting (presumed author is [[Theodore Frelinghuysen]])

Frelinghuysen|group=n}}  ''Conventional wisdom'' was used in a number of other works prior to Galbraith, occasionally in a positive&lt;ref name="GBS-History"&gt;''E.g.,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=7fEqAAAAMAAJ 1 Nahum Capen, ''The History of Democracy'' (1874), page 477] ("millions of all classes alike are equally interested and protected by the practical judgment and conventional wisdom of ages").&lt;/ref&gt;
or neutral&lt;ref name="GBS-Shallow"&gt;''E.g.,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=rwsCAAAAYAAJ "Shallow Theorists", ''American Educational Monthly 383 (Oct. 1866)] ("What is the result?  Just what conventional wisdom assumes it would be.").&lt;/ref&gt;
sense, but more often pejoratively.&lt;ref name="GBS-Technique-Meditations"&gt;''E.g.,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=H40QAAAAYAAJ Joseph Warren Beach, ''The Technique of Thomas Hardy'' (1922), page 152] ("He has not the colorless monotony of the business man who follows sure ways to success, who has conformed to every rule of conventional wisdom, and made himself as featureless as a potato field, as tame as an extinct volcano."); [https://books.google.com/books?id=TeQz-58sVOkC "Meditations", ''The Life'' (May 1905), page 224] ("in the end he fulfilled the promise of the Lord, and proved that conventional wisdom is short-sighted, narrow, and untrustworthy").&lt;/ref&gt;
However, previous authors used it as a synonym for 'commonplace knowledge'. Galbraith specifically prepended 'The' to the phrase to emphasize its uniqueness, and sharpened its meaning to narrow it to those commonplace beliefs that are also acceptable and comfortable to society, thus enhancing their ability to resist facts that might diminish them. He repeatedly referred to it throughout the text of ''The Affluent Society'', invoking it to explain the high degree of resistance in academic economics to new ideas. For these reasons, he is usually credited with the invention and popularization of the phrase in modern usage.

==Accuracy==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2008}}
Conventional wisdom is not necessarily true.  It is additionally often seen as an obstacle to the acceptance of newly acquired information, to introducing new theories and explanations, and therefore operates as an obstacle that must be overcome by legitimate [[Historical revisionism|revisionism]]. This is to say, that despite new information to the contrary, conventional wisdom has a property analogous to [[inertia]] that opposes the introduction of contrary belief, sometimes to the point of absurd denial of the new information set by persons strongly holding an outdated (conventional) view. This inertia is due to conventional wisdom being made of ideas that are convenient, appealing and deeply assumed by the public, which hangs on to them even as they grow outdated. This inertia can last even after the paradigm has shifted between competing conventional idea sets.

The concept of conventional wisdom may also be applied or implied in a political sense, being closely related to the phenomenon of [[talking point]]s. It is used pejoratively to refer to the idea that statements which are repeated over and over become conventional wisdom regardless of whether or not they are true.

In a more general sense, it is used to refer to the accepted truth about something which nearly no one would argue about, and so is used as a gauge (or well-spring) of normative behavior or belief, even within a professional context. One such example was conventional wisdom in 1950, even among most doctors, was that smoking was not particularly harmful to one's health.{{fact|date=June 2015}} Conventional wisdom in 2011: it is.  Another: It might be used in this manner discussing a technical matter such as the conventional wisdom was that a man would suffer fatal injuries if he experienced more than eighteen [[g-force]]s in an [[aerospace]] vehicle. ([[John Stapp]] shattered that myth by repeatedly withstanding far more in his research, peaking above 46 Gs).

Sometimes, people in society form conventional ideas about what other people in the past considered to be conventional wisdom. For example, take the following sentence: "[[Myth of the Flat Earth|It is widely believed]] that prior to [[Christopher Columbus]] people thought the world was flat, but in actuality, scholars of that time had long accepted that the earth is a sphere."

The above sentence is true; people today often think that Columbus discovered the world to be round, when in fact the world's roundness was already widely known by Columbus' time. However, if enough people read and believe the above sentence, the above sentence will eventually supplant the old belief (the old belief in past belief in a flat earth). The above sentence would become the new conventional wisdom. (Ironically, however, this would also turn the above sentence, the new conventional wisdom, into a false claim; because the new conventional wisdom would propose that people are confused about past beliefs in a way that they actually wouldn't be.){{Clarify|reason=I did my best, but this is still irrelevant, obtuse, nit-picky and arbitrarily hard to follow. Contributor of most recent revision thinks these two previous paragraphs should be deleted wholesale.|date=January 2014}}

==Integration with scientific evidence==
[[Evidence-based medicine]] is a deliberate effort to acknowledge expert opinion (conventional wisdom) and how it coexists with scientific data.  Evidence-based medicine acknowledges that expert opinion is "evidence" and plays a role to fill the "gap between the kind of knowledge generated by clinical research studies and the kind of knowledge necessary to make the best decision for individual patients."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tonelli|first=Mark R|title=Integrating Clinical Research Into Clinical Decision Making|journal=[[Annali dell'Istituto Superiore di Sanità]]|date=January 2011|volume=47|issue=1|pages=26–30|url=http://www.iss.it/publ/anna/2011/1/47126.pdf|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7340">'''Economic reconstruction''' refers to a process for creating a proactive vision of economic change.  The most basic idea is that problems in the economy such as [[deindustrialization]], environmental decay, [[outsourcing]], industrial incompetence, [[poverty]] and addiction to a [[permanent war economy]] are based on the ''design'' and ''organization'' of economic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;See Melman, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Economic reconstruction builds on the ideas of various institutional economists and thinkers whose work both critiques existing economic institutions and suggests modes of organizing society differently (cf. Veblen, 1998).  Economic reconstruction, however, places much more emphasis on the idea of alternative plans and alternative organization.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, 2007; Goodman, 1962; Raskin, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for reconstruction occurs as fundamental problems plague the contemporary organization of the  economic, political, and even "oppositional" spheres, such as the contemporary organization of social movements.  These spheres each tend to support short term solutions that do not leave in their wake the organization of resources and power in a way that is responsive to citizen needs.  Power, democracy and critical alternatives are not linked.  In contrast to this state of affairs, economic reconstruction supports the creation of new institutions and the redesign of old ones.  The basic idea is to create a new way to organize the economy and society so that institutions work for rather than against peoples' interests and needs.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, 2007, Feldman, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first generation of economic reconstructionists included [[Thorstein Veblen]] and [[John Dewey]].{{efn|Veblen influenced the work of Seymour Melman and Dewey the work of Paul Goodman.}} The second generation included [[Lewis Mumford]].&lt;ref&gt;Luccarelli, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;   The third generation included [[Seymour Melman]], [[Percival Goodman]] and [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]].&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, 2007; Goodman and Goodman, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;   Key reconstructionists today include [[Barry Commoner]], [[Gar Alperovitz]] and [[Marcus Raskin]].&lt;ref&gt;See Alperovitz, 2005; Raskin, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  Key figures whose work informs the critique of contemporary society found in the work of economic reconstructionists include [[Stanley Aronowitz]] (in his writings about social movements, the state, universities and culture), [[Noam Chomsky]] in his writings about anarchist cooperatives and democracy, and [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] (in his writings about the economy and economists).  Another important figure is [[Simone Weil]] whose writings about problems or limits attached to militarism, social science atomization, Marxism, the economy and political parties all resonate with an economic reconstruction agenda.

== Currents ==

Advocates of economic reconstruction advocate fundamental change related to key social problems related to environmental decay,&lt;ref&gt;Commoner, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; [[militarism]],&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, 2007; Melman, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; parasitic [[globalization]],&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[unemployment]] and depressed living standards based on the social organization of work.&lt;ref&gt;Melman, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;   In the environment, a key challenge is redesigning "the technosphere" or the ways in which the means of production, transportation and distribution are designed on a relatively unsustainable basis.&lt;ref&gt;Commoner, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;   When it comes to militarism, the key challenge is to support a demilitarized society through [[economic conversion]], [[disarmament]], alternative security, military budget reductions and related social innovations.  When it comes to unemployment and depressed living standards, a key challenge is to promote economic democracy, through concrete institutions and actions such as cooperatives, worker participation and control, employee ownership plans, socially responsible firms, community procurement, and various initiatives to organize the economy on a decentralized basis.&lt;ref&gt;Alperovitz, 2005; Melman, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;   In many cases, federations among local cooperatives or networks of such firms may prove essential to move beyond the problem of "economic democracy in one firm."&lt;ref&gt;See Melman, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic reconstruction also extends to the ways in which housing or communities and media are organized.  By reducing dependency on the automobile, by linking work and residence, we can limit the problems creating by congestion, pollution and commuting (particularly those problems based on petroleum based automobile transportation.&lt;ref&gt;Alperovitz, 2005; Goodman and Goodman, 1960; Luccarelli, 1995; Raskin, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some may argue that economic reconstruction can be reduced to [[socialism]] or [[economic democracy]] itself or perhaps principles found in various anarchist or radical writings.  The problem, however, is that many of these plans lack operational details related to how alternative institutions would actually be designed.  These details are essential for creating operational plans and actions.  In addition, economic reconstruction is not limited to a specific challenge such as capitalism, but must also address other challenges, i.e. militarism, environmental decay, the sexual and ethnic division of labor, etc. A goal of economic reconstruction is to show the need for multiple, yet integrated solutions to societal breakdown.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, 2007; Raskin, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A meeting of umbrellas by James Gillray.jpg|thumb|At the time of the picture, the sight of an able-bodied adult male carrying an umbrella for himself in an English city or town still had some of the connotations of excessive dandyism or effeminacy that it had earlier in the 18th century.]]
'''Effeminacy''' is the manifestation of traits in a boy or man that are more often associated with [[feminine]] nature, behavior, mannerism, style, or [[gender role]]s rather than with [[masculine]] nature, behavior, mannerisms, style or roles. It is a term frequently applied to womanly behavior, demeanor, style, clothing and appearance displayed by a boy or man.

Until the modern period,{{According to whom|date=February 2017}} effeminacy in the Western tradition referred to a complicated intersection of both social (or civic) and sexual identities typically associated with women. The ancient Greeks, for example, described whole societies as effeminate ([[malakia]]) if they were characterized by a slavish, deferential, or autocratic political culture. Here, it was the form of sexual relationships, but not the fact of homosexual relations (which were not uncommon among Greek citizens who were men{{Citation needed|date=April 2016|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence}}) that was critical to the sexual dimension of the term. And among early modern partisans of the republican tradition, the term might be applied to those who were preoccupied with "womanly" concerns, such as the accoutrements of appearance, which were often associated with trappings of nobility or aristocratic aspirations, such as ostentatious dress, decadence in consumption habits, and rigid adherence to the proprieties or manners of social hierarchy. The reach of this "civic" understanding may be best illustrated in the work of early feminist and republican thinkers such as [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], who described as "effeminate" the behavior of women who refused to embrace a more active presence in public life.

Since the 18th century, the civic dimension of [[gender identity]] has been eclipsed by the sexual dimension of gender identity, and, today, effeminacy has often been considered a [[vice]], indicative of other negative character traits and often involving a pejorative insinuation of [[homosexual]] tendencies in boys or men. In other societies, by contrast, effeminate boys or men may be considered a distinct human gender ([[third gender]]), and may have a special social function, as is the case of [[Two-Spirit]]s in some Native American groups. Furthermore, some see effeminacy to be a characteristic or trait, part of a particular person's gender role and in this sense would not be considered a vice or indicative of any other characteristics. An effeminate boy or man is similar to a ''[[fop]]'' or a ''[[dandy]]'', though these tend to be archaic identities that are taken on by the individual rather than insulting labels.

==History==

===Etymology===
''Effeminate'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''effeminātus'', from ''ex'' which is "out," and ''femina'' which means [[woman]]; it means "to be like a woman." Another Latin term is ''mollities'', meaning "softness."

In ancient Koine Greek, the word for effeminate is κίναιδος ''kinaidos'' (''[[cinaedus]]'' in its Latinized form), or μαλακοί ''[[malakoi]]'': a man "whose most salient feature was a supposedly "feminine" love of being sexually penetrated by other men."&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

"A ''cinaedus'' is a man who cross-dresses or flirts like a girl. Indeed, the word's etymology suggests an indirect sexual act emanating a promiscuous woman. This term has been borrowed from the Greek ''kinaidos'' (which may itself have come from a language of Ionian Greecs of Asia Minor, primarily signifying a purely effeminate dancer who entertained his audiences with a ''tympanum'' or tambourine in his hand, and adopted a lascivious style, often suggestively wiggling his buttocks in such a way as to suggest anal intercourse....The primary meaning of ''cinaedus'' never died out; the term never became a [[dead metaphor]]."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Other vernacular words for effeminacy include: "[[pansy]]", "nelly", "pretty boy", "nancy boy", "molly", "[[sissy]]", "[[pussy]]", and "[[girl]]" (when applied to a boy or, especially, adult man). Contrastingly, a masculine girl would be called a "[[tomboy]]", "[[Butch and femme|butch]]", or "[[Dyke (slang)|dyke]]". The word ''effete'' similarly means effeminacy or over-refinement, but comes from the Latin ''effetus'', from ''ex-'' and ''fetus'' "fruitful".

===Ancient Greece and Rome===
{{Main|Classical definition of effeminacy}}

====Greece====
Greek historian [[Plutarch]] recounts that [[Periander]], the tyrant of [[Ambracia]], asked his "boy", "Aren't you pregnant yet?" in the presence of other people, causing the boy to kill him in revenge for being treated as if effeminate or a woman (''Amatorius'' 768F).

As part of Greek politician's ([[Aeschines]]') proof that a member of the prosecution against him, Timarchus, had prostituted himself to (or been "kept" by) another man while young, he attributed fellow prosecutor [[Demosthenes]]' nickname Batalos ("arse") to his "unmanliness and ''kinaidiā''" and frequently commented on his "unmanly and womanish temper", even criticising his clothing: "If anyone took those dainty little coats and soft shirts off you... and took them round for the jurors to handle, I think they'd be quite unable to say, if they hadn't been told in advance, whether they had hold of a man's clothing or a woman's."&lt;ref&gt;Dover, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Demosthenes is also implicated in passive homosexuality and the prostitution of youth:&lt;ref&gt;Aiskhines iii 162&lt;/ref&gt; "There is a certain Aristion, a Plataean..., who as a youth was outstandingly good-looking and lived for a long time in Demosthenes' house. Allegations about the part he was playing [lit., 'undergoing or doing what'] there vary, and it would be most unseemly for me to talk about it."&lt;ref&gt;Dover, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

The late Greek{{efn|possibly c. fourth century}} ''[[Amores (Lucian)|Erôtes]]'' ("Loves", "Forms of Desire", "Affairs of the Heart"), preserved with manuscripts by [[Lucian]], contains a debate "between two men, Charicles and Callicratidas, over the relative merits of women and boys as vehicles of male sexual pleasure." Callicratidas, "far from being effeminised by his sexual predilection for boys... Callicratidas's inclination renders him hypervirile... Callicratidas's sexual desire for boys, then, makes him more of a man; it does not weaken or subvert his male gender identity but rather consolidates it." In contrast, "Charicles' erotic preference for women seems to have had the corresponding effect of effeminising him: when the reader first encounters him, for example, Charicles is described as exhibiting 'a skillful use of cosmetics, so as to be attractive to women.'"

====Rome====
Over-refinement, fine clothes and other possessions, the company of women, certain trades, and too much fondness with women were all deemed effeminate traits in Roman society. Taking an inappropriate sexual position, passive or "bottom", in same-gender sex was considered effeminate and unnatural. Touching the head with a finger and wearing a [[goatee]] were also considered effeminate.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman consul [[Scipio Aemilianus]] questioned one of his opponents, P. Sulpicius Galus: "For the kind of man who adorns himself daily in front of a mirror, wearing perfume; whose eyebrows are shaved off; who walks around with plucked beard and thighs; who when he was a young man reclined at banquets next to his lover, wearing a long-sleeved tunic; who is fond of men as he is of wine: can anyone doubt that he has done what ''cinaedi'' are in the habit of doing?"&lt;ref&gt;fr. 17 Malcovati; Aulus Gellius, 6.12.5; cited/translated by Williams 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;23&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman orator [[Quintilian]] described, "The plucked body, the broken walk, the female attire," as "signs of one who is soft [mollis] and not a real man."&lt;ref&gt;''Institutes'' 5.9.14, cited/translated by Richlin, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

For Roman men masculinity also meant self-control, even in the face of painful emotions, illnesses, or death. [[Cicero]] says, "There exist certain precepts, even laws, that prohibit a man from being effeminate in pain,"&lt;ref&gt;''Fin''. 2.94&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] adds, "If I must suffer illness, it will be my wish to do nothing out of control, nothing effeminately."&lt;ref&gt;''Epist''. 67.4&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperor/philosopher [[Julian (emperor)|Julian the Apostate]], in his [[Against the Galilaeans|''Against the Galileans'']], wrote: &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;Why the Egyptians are more intelligent and more given to crafts, and the Syrians unwarlike and effeminate, but at the same time intelligent, hot-tempered, vain and quick to learn?&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;

In his ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Commentaries]] on the [[Gallic Wars]]'', [[Julius Caesar]] wrote that the [[Belgae|Belgians]] were the bravest of all [[Gaul]]s because "merchants least frequently resort to them, and import those things which tend to effeminate the mind".&lt;ref&gt;''Commentarii de Bello Gallico'', I,1&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] evidently considered effeminacy an undesirable trait, but it is unclear as to what or who was being referred.&lt;ref&gt;Meditations, Book 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Bible===
''[[Classical definition of effeminacy|Malakos]]'' is listed among other vices in the [[New Testament]] book of [[I Corinthians]] 6:9. Translations use different terms to express this.{{efn|"The JB (1966) chooses 'catamite,' the NAB (1970) renders ''arsenokoités'' and ''malakos'' together as 'sodomite,' others translate ''malakos'' as 'male prostitute' (NRSV 1989), and again some combine both terms and offer the modern medicalised categories of sexual, or particularly homosexual, 'perversion' (RSV 1946, TEV 1966, NEB 1970, REB 1992)."}} The online Greek Interlinear Bible uses Strongs concordance (last corrected in 2008) translates ''Malakoi'' as "[[Catamite]]s", and ''Arsenokoitia'' as "[[Sodomy|sodomite]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Martin, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''malakos'', #3120 in the Greek Dictionary of The New Testament of [[Strong's Concordance|James Strong's Exhaustive Concordance to The Bible]] states: "of uncertain [[affinity (canon law)|affinity]]".[https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=g3120]

==Gay men==

In the United States, boys are often [[homosocial]],&lt;ref&gt;Gagnon, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; and gender role performance determines social rank.&lt;ref&gt;David and Brannon, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; While [[gay]] boys receive the same [[enculturation]], they are less compliant, Martin Levine summarizes: "Harry (1982, 51–52), for example, found that 42 percent of his gay respondents were '[[Sissy|sissies]]' during childhood. Only 11 percent of his heterosexual samples were gender-role nonconformists. Bell, Weinberg, and Hammersmith (1981, 188) reported that half of their male homosexual subjects practiced gender-inappropriate behaviour in childhood. Among their heterosexual men, the rate of noncompliance was 25 percent.  Saghir and Robins (1973, 18) found that one-third of their gay man respondents conformed to gender role dictates. Only 3 percent of their heterosexual men deviated from the norm." Thus effeminate boys, or sissies, are physically and verbally harassed (Saghir and Robins, 1973, 17–18; Bell, Weinberg, and Hammersmith 1981, 74–84), causing them to feel worthless&lt;ref&gt;Harry 1982, 20&lt;/ref&gt; and "de-feminise".&lt;ref&gt;Harry 1982, 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saghir and Robins 1973, 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levine, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;5–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[Stonewall riots]], inconsistent gender role performance had been noticed among gay men:&lt;ref&gt;Karlen, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cory and LeRoy, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; "They have a different face for different occasions. In conversations with each other, they often undergo a subtle change. I have seen men who appeared to be normal suddenly smile roguishly, soften their voices, and simper as they greeted homosexual friends [...] Many times I saw these changes occur after I had gained a homosexual's confidence and he could safely risk my disapproval. Once as I watched a luncheon companion become an effeminate caricature of himself, he apologised, 'It is hard to always remember that one is a man.'"&lt;ref&gt;Stearn 1962, 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levine, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;21–23&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|align=right|width=40em|There is a definite prejudice towards men who use femininity as part of their palette; their emotional palette, their physical palette. Is that changing? It's changing in ways that don't advance the cause of femininity. I'm not talking frilly-laced pink things or Hello Kitty stuff. I'm talking about goddess energy, intuition and feelings. That is still under attack, and it has gotten worse.|salign=right|source=—[[RuPaul]]&lt;ref&gt;[[n:RuPaul speaks about society and the state of drag as performance art|Interview with RuPaul]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', October 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Pre-Stonewall "closet" culture accepted homosexuality as effeminate behaviour, and thus emphasized [[Camp (style)|camp]], [[drag (clothing)|drag]], and [[swish (slang)|swish]] including an interest in fashion&lt;ref&gt;Henry, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; and decorating.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry 1955, 304&lt;/ref&gt; Masculine gay men were marginalised&lt;ref&gt;Warren 1972, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helmer 1963&lt;/ref&gt; and formed their own communities, such as the [[leather subculture]] and Western,&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2015}} and/or wore clothes that were commonly associated with [[working-class]] individuals,&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; such as sailor uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;Cory and LeRoy, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levine, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;21–23, 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-Stonewall, "[[Castro clone|clone culture]]" became dominant and effeminacy was at the time marginalised. One indicator of this is a definite preference shown in personal ads for masculine-behaving men.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey et al. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The avoidance of effeminacy by men, including gay ones, has been linked to possible impedance of personal and public health. Regarding [[HIV/AIDS]], masculine behaviour was stereotyped as being unconcerned about safe sex practices while engaging in promiscuous sexual behaviour. Early reports from New York City indicated that more women had themselves tested for HIV/AIDS than men.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levine, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;148&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Halperin]] compares "universalising" and "minoritising" notions of gender deviance: "'Softness' either may represent the specter of potential gender failure that haunts all normative masculinity, an ever-present threat to the masculinity of every man, or it may represent the disfiguring peculiarity of a small class of deviant individuals."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Halperin]], 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''effeminiphobia'' (sometimes ''effemiphobic'', as used by Randy P. Conner, or ''femmephobia'') was coined by Will Fellows to describe strong anti-effeminacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fellows |first=Will |title=A Passion to Preserve: Gay Men as Keepers of Culture |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |place=Madison, Wisconsin |date=2004 |page=280 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0wf_zMk3D8AC&amp;pg=PA280 |accessdate=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Bailey coined the similar term '''''femiphobia''''' to describe the ambivalence gay men and culture have about effeminate behaviour in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bailey, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Gay author Tim Bergling popularized the term ''[[sissyphobia]]'' in ''[[Sissyphobia: Gay Men and Effeminate Behavior]],''&lt;ref&gt;Dylan Vox, [http://www.edgeboston.com/index.php?ch=entertainment&amp;sc=culture&amp;sc2=features&amp;sc3=&amp;id=53855 "Would Life Be Better if You Were Straight?"], Gaywired.com, Dec 20, 2007, also appeared in ''Edge'', Boston&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bergling|first=Tim|title=[[Sissyphobia: Gay Men and Effeminate Behavior]]|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=1-56023-990-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it was used before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oliven|first=John F.|title=Clinical sexuality: a manual for the physician and the professions|publisher=Lippincott|year=1974|edition=3rd|page=110|isbn=0-397-50329-6|url=https://books.google.de/books?hl=de&amp;id=Z-lrAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=0397503296&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=sissyphobia}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transsexual]] writer and [[biologist]] [[Julia Serano]] has coined the similar term ''[[effemimania]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=Kelby|title=Sexual Deceit: The Ethics of Passing|year=2013|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=0739177052|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Serano|first1=Julia|title=Whipping Girl|date=2007|publisher=Seal Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=1580051545|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a range of feedbacks in the climate system, including [[water vapor feedback|water vapour]], changes in [[ice–albedo feedback|ice–albedo]] (snow and ice cover affect how much the Earth's surface absorbs or reflects incoming sunlight), clouds, and changes in the Earth's carbon cycle (e.g., the release of carbon from soil).&lt;ref&gt;

{{Main|Global climate model}}

A [[climate model]] is a [[mathematical models|representation]] of the physical, chemical and biological processes that affect the climate system.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/annexessglossary-a-d.html Glossary A–D]: "Climate Model", in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 SYR|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although researchers attempt to include as many processes as possible, simplifications of the actual climate system are inevitable because of the constraints of available computer power and limitations in knowledge of the climate system. Results from models can also vary due to different greenhouse gas inputs and the model's climate sensitivity. For example, the uncertainty in IPCC's 2007 projections is caused by (1) the use of multiple models&lt;ref name="meehl 2007 global warming projections"&gt;

The models do not assume the climate will warm due to increasing levels of greenhouse gases. Instead the models predict how greenhouse gases will interact with radiative transfer and other physical processes. Warming or cooling is thus a result, not an assumption, of the models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sx6DFr8rbpIC&amp;dq=robert+lanza&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=One World: The Health &amp; Survival of the Human Species in the 21st century|last=Hansen|first=James|publisher=Health Press (New Mexico)|year=2000|isbn=0-929173-33-3|editor=Lanza|editor-first=Robert|location=|pages=173–90|contribution=Climatic Change: Understanding Global Warming|accessdate=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Models are also used to help investigate the [[Attribution of recent climate change|causes of recent climate change]] by comparing the observed changes to those that the models project from various natural and human causes. Although these models do not unambiguously attribute the warming that occurred from approximately 1910 to 1945 to either natural variation or human effects, they do indicate that the warming since 1970 is dominated by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="Hegerl-2001"/&gt;

{{main|Climate change adaptation}}
[[Climate change adaptation]] is another policy response. The adaptation may be planned, either in reaction to or anticipation of global warming, or spontaneous, i.e., without government intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Smit ''et al.'', [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/641.htm Chapter 18: Adaptation to Climate Change in the Context of Sustainable Development and Equity], [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/644.htm#1823 Section 18.2.3: Adaptation Types and Forms], in {{Harvnb|IPCC TAR WG2|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Planned adaptation is already occurring on a limited basis.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; The barriers, limits, and costs of future adaptation are not fully understood.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; Environmental organizations and public figures have emphasized changes in the climate and the risks they entail, while promoting adaptation to changes in infrastructural needs and emissions reductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|title=New Report Provides Authoritative Assessment of National, Regional Impacts of Global Climate Change|date=16 June 2009|publisher=[[U.S. Global Change Research Program]]|url=https://www.globalchange.gov/news/new-assessment-national-regional-impacts-climate-change|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

work in the relevant fields and participate in the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]. The [[scientific consensus]] {{as of|2013|lc=y}} stated in the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] is that it "is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century".&lt;ref name="ipcc"&gt;{{cite book

The disputed issues include the causes of increased [[instrumental temperature record|global average air temperature]], especially since the mid-20th century, whether this warming trend is unprecedented or within normal climatic variations, whether humankind has contributed significantly to it, and whether the increase is completely or partially an artefact of poor measurements. Additional disputes concern estimates of climate sensitivity, predictions of additional warming, and what the consequences of global warming will be.

In the United States from about 1990 onwards, [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] [[think tank]]s had begun challenging the legitimacy of global warming as a social problem. They [[climate change denial|challenged the scientific evidence]], argued that [[benefits of global warming|global warming would have benefits]], and asserted that proposed solutions would do more harm than good.&lt;ref&gt;McCright, Aaron M.; Dunlap, Riley E., "Challenging Global Warming as a Social Problem: An Analysis of the Conservative Movement's Counter-Claims", ''Social Problems'', November 2000, Vol. 47 Issue 4, pp 499–522 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3097132 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Some people dispute aspects of climate change science.&lt;ref name="royal society misleading arguments"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

By 2010, with 111 countries surveyed, Gallup determined that there had been a substantial decrease since 2007–2008 in the number of Americans and Europeans who viewed global warming as a serious threat.

==History==
{{Main|History of climate change science}}

The [[history of climate change science]] began in the early 19th century when [[ice ages]] and other natural changes in [[paleoclimate]] were first suspected and the natural [[greenhouse effect]] first identified.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In the late 19th century, scientists first argued that human emissions of [[greenhouse gases]] could change the [[climate]]. In the 1960s, the warming effect of [[carbon dioxide]] gas became increasingly convincing.&lt;ref name="Weart 27" /&gt; By the 1990s, as a result of improving fidelity of [[computer models]] and observational work confirming the [[Milankovitch theory]] of the ice ages, a consensus position formed: greenhouse gases were deeply involved in most climate changes and human caused emissions were bringing discernible global warming. Since the 1990s, scientific research on climate change has included multiple disciplines and has expanded.&lt;ref name="Weart Hansen" /&gt; Research during this period has been summarized in the Assessment Reports by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].

=== Terminology ===
In the 1950s, research suggested increasing temperatures, and a 1952 newspaper reported "climate change". This phrase next appeared in a November 1957 report in ''[[The Times of Northwest Indiana|The Hammond Times]]'' which described [[Roger Revelle]]'s research into the effects of increasing human-caused {{co2}} emissions on the [[greenhouse effect]], "a large scale global warming, with radical climate changes may result". Both phrases were used only occasionally until 1975, when [[Wallace Smith Broecker]] published a scientific paper on the topic, "Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?" The phrase began to come into common use, and in 1976 [[Mikhail Budyko]]'s statement that "a global warming up has started" was widely reported.&lt;ref name="Weart 27"&gt;{{cite web |first=Spencer R.|last= Weart|authorlink=Spencer R. Weart| title= The Discovery of Global Warming; The Public and Climate Change: Suspicions of a Human-Caused Greenhouse (1956–1969) | publisher=American Institute of Physics | date=February 2014 | url=http://history.aip.org/climate/public.htm#S2 | accessdate=12 May 2015}}, and [http://www.aip.org/history/climate/public.htm#M_27_ footnote 27]&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies, such as a 1971 [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] report, referred to the human impact as "inadvertent climate modification", but an influential 1979 [[National Academy of Sciences]] study headed by [[Jule Gregory Charney|Jule Charney]] followed Broecker in using ''global warming'' for rising surface temperatures, while describing the wider effects of increased {{co2}} as ''climate change''.&lt;ref name="nasacbaon"&gt;[[Erik M. Conway|Erik Conway]]. [http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/climate_by_any_other_name.html "What's in a Name? Global Warming vs. Climate Change"], [[NASA]], 5 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 and November 1987, NASA climate scientist [[James Hansen]] gave testimony to Congress on global warming. There were increasing heatwaves and drought problems in the summer of 1988, and when Hansen testified in the Senate on 23 June he sparked worldwide interest.&lt;ref name="Weart Hansen"&gt;{{cite web |first=Spencer R.|last= Weart | title= The Discovery of Global Warming; The Public and Climate Change: The Summer of 1988 | publisher=American Institute of Physics | date=February 2014 | url=http://history.aip.org/climate/public2.htm#L_0575 | accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said, "global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming."&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Senate, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, "Greenhouse Effect and Global Climate Change, part 2" 100th Cong., 1st sess., 23 June 1988, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Public attention increased over the summer, and ''global warming'' became the dominant popular term, commonly used both by the press and in public discourse.&lt;ref name=nasacbaon/&gt;

In a 2008 NASA article on usage, [[Erik M. Conway]] defined ''global warming'' as "the increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to rising levels of greenhouse gases", while ''climate change'' was "a long-term change in the Earth's climate, or of a region on Earth". Because effects such as changing patterns of rainfall and rising sea levels would probably have more impact than temperatures alone, he considered ''global climate change'' a more scientifically accurate term, and like the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], the NASA website emphasized this wider context.&lt;ref name=nasacbaon/&gt;

'''Gérald Leblanc''' (September 25, 1945 – May 30, 2005) was an [[Acadia]]n poet notable for seeking his own Acadian roots and the current voices of Acadian culture.  Leblanc was born in [[Bouctouche]], [[New Brunswick]]. He studied at the [[Université de Moncton]] and lived in [[Moncton]], where he died in 2005. He also spent a good part of his life in [[New York City]], which he loved.

Deeply Acadian and North American, Gérald Leblanc tirelessly sought the roots of his Acadian identity. The quality and abundance of his poetic work guarantee him a place amongst the most important authors of modern Acadian poetry. He was also the author, along with [[Claude Beausoleil]], of an anthology of Acadian poetry. He was the lyricist for the Acadian musical group ''[[1755 (band)|1755]]'' and wrote many of the group's classic songs ("Le monde a bien changé", "Boire ma bouteille", Rue Dufferin", "Kouchibouguac"). He was an unabashed champion of "[[chiac]]", which is the slang spoken mainly in south eastern New Brunswick and mixes English and French words and syntax.

As a poet and speaker, he was invited to various countries: [[Canada]] ([[Vancouver]], [[Winnipeg]], [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]], [[Halifax (former city), Nova Scotia|Halifax]],etc.), the [[United States]] ([[New York City|New York]] and [[New Orleans]]), [[France]] ([[Paris]], [[La Rochelle]], [[Caen]], [[Grenoble]], [[Lyon]], and [[Poitiers]]), [[Belgium]] ([[Brussels]], [[Namur (city)|Namur]], [[Liège]]), the [[Republic of Congo]] ([[Kinshasa]]), [[Mexico]] ([[Mexico City]]), the [[Czech Republic]] ([[Prague]]), [[Slovakia]] ([[Bratislava]]), and [[Switzerland]] ([[Delémont]]).

==Works==

Leblanc's texts (written in [[French language|French]]) have been translated into [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]].

'''Hakka''', also rendered '''Kejia''', is one of the major groups of [[varieties of Chinese]], spoken natively by the [[Hakka people]] throughout southern [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]] and throughout the [[diaspora]] areas of [[East Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and in [[overseas Chinese]] communities around the world.

Due to its primary usage in scattered isolated regions where communication is limited to the local area, Hakka has developed numerous [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] or [[dialect]]s, spoken in different provinces, such as [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], [[Hainan]], [[Fujian]], [[Sichuan]], [[Hunan]], [[Jiangxi]] and [[Guizhou]], as well as in [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]]. Hakka is not [[mutually intelligible]] with [[Yue Chinese|Yue]], [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Southern Min]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] or other branches of Chinese, and itself contains a few mutually unintelligible varieties. It is most closely related to [[Gan Chinese|Gan]] and is sometimes classified as a variety of Gan, with a few northern Hakka varieties even being partially mutually intelligible with southern Gan. There is also a possibility that the similarities are just a result of shared [[areal feature]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Thurgood &amp; LaPolla, 2003. ''The Sino-Tibetan Languages''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taiwan, where Hakka is the native language of a significant minority of the island's residents, is a center for the study and preservation of the language. Pronunciation differences exist between the [[Taiwanese Hakka]] dialects and Mainland China's Hakka dialects; even in Taiwan, two major local varieties of Hakka exist.

The [[Meixian dialect]] (Moiyen) of northeast [[Guangdong]] in China has been taken as the "standard" dialect by the [[People's Republic of China]]. The Guangdong Provincial Education Department created an official [[romanization]] of Moiyen in 1960, one of four languages receiving this status in Guangdong.

==Etymology==
The name of the Hakka people who are the predominant original native speakers of the variety literally means "guest families" or "guest people": ''Hak'' 客 (Mandarin: ''kè'') means "guest", and ''ka'' 家 (Mandarin: ''jiā'') means "family". Among themselves, Hakka people variously called their language ''Hak-ka-fa'' (''-va'') 客家話, ''Hak-fa'' (''-va'') 客話, ''Tu-gong-dung-fa'' (''-va'') 土廣東話, literally "Native Guangdong language", and ''Ngai-fa'' (''-va'') 我話, "My/our language". In Tonggu county (铜鼓县), Jiangxi province, people call their language ''Huai-yuan-fa'' 怀远話.

==History==

===Early history===
It is commonly believed that [[Hakka people]] have their origins in several episodes of migration from northern [[China]] into southern [[China]] during periods of war and civil unrest&lt;ref&gt;[http://edu.ocac.gov.tw/lang/hakka/english/a/a.htm Hakka Migration]&lt;/ref&gt; dating back as far as the end of [[Western Jin]].&lt;ref&gt;[h
http://edu.ocac.gov.tw/lang/hakka/a/main_a11.htm Migration of the Hakka people (in Chinese])&lt;/ref&gt; The forebears of the Hakka came from present-day [[Central Plains (China)|Central Plains]] provinces of [[Henan]] and [[Shaanxi]], and brought with them features of Chinese varieties spoken in those areas during that time. (Since then, the speech in those regions has evolved into dialects of modern [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]). The presence of many archaic features occur in modern Hakka, including final consonants {{IPA|-p -t -k}}, as are found in other modern southern Chinese varieties, but which have been lost in Mandarin.

[[Laurent Sagart]] (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Sagart, Laurent. 2002. [https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00095941 Gan, Hakka and the Formation of Chinese Dialects]. ''Dialect Variations in Chinese'', 129-153. Papers from the Third International Conference on Sinology, Linguistics Section.&lt;/ref&gt; considers Hakka and southern [[Gan Chinese]] to be sister dialects that descended from a single common ancestral language (Proto-Southern Gan) spoken in central Jiangxi during the [[Song Dynasty]]. In Hakka and southern Gan, Sagart (2002) identifies a non-Chinese [[substratum]] that is possibly [[Hmong-Mien languages|Hmong-Mien]], an archaic layer, and a more recent Late [[Middle Chinese]] layer. Lexical connections between Hakka, Kra-Dai, and Hmong-Mien have also been suggested by Deng (1999).&lt;ref&gt;Deng, Xiaohua 邓晓华. 1999. [http://www.nssd.org/articles/article_detail.aspx?id=1002191501 Kejiahua gen Miao-yao Zhuangdongyu de Guanxi wenti 客家话跟苗瑶壮侗语的关系问题]. ''Minzu Yuwen'' 民族语文 3:42-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the migration of its speakers, Hakka may have been influenced by other language areas through which the Hakka-speaking forebears migrated. For instance, common vocabulary is found in Hakka, [[Min Chinese|Min]], and the [[She language|She]] (Hmong–Mien) languages.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Today, most [[She people]] in Fujian and Zhejiang speak [[Shehua]], which is closely related to Hakka.

===Linguistic development===
A regular pattern of sound change can generally be detected in Hakka, as in most Chinese varieties, of the derivation of [[phoneme]]s from earlier forms of Chinese. Some examples:
* Characters such as 武 (war, martial arts) or 屋 (room, house), are pronounced roughly ''mwio'' and ''uk'' (''mjuX'' and ''ʔuwk'' in [[Baxter's transcription for Middle Chinese|Baxter's transcription]]) in Early [[Middle Chinese]], have an initial ''v'' phoneme in Hakka, being ''vu'' and ''vuk'' in Hakka respectively. Like in Mandarin, labiodentalisation process also changed ''mj-'' to a w-like sound in Hakka before grave vowels, while Cantonese retained the original distinction (compare Mandarin 武 ''wǔ'', 屋 ''wū'', Cantonese 武 ''mou''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, 屋 ''uk''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;).
* Middle Chinese initial phonemes /ɲ/ (''ny'' in Baxter’s transcription) of the characters 人 and 日, among others, merged with ''ng-'' /ŋ/ initials in Hakka (人 ''ngin'', 日 ''ngit''). For comparison, in Mandarin, /ɲ/ became ''r-'' (人 ''rén'', 日 ''rì''), while in Cantonese, it merged with initial /j/ (人 ''yan''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, 日 ''yat''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;).
* The initial consonant phoneme exhibited by the character 話 (word, speech; Mandarin ''huà'') is pronounced ''f'' or ''v'' in Hakka (''v'' does not properly exist as a distinct unit in many Chinese varieties).
* The initial consonant of 學 ''{{IPA|hɔk}}'' usually corresponds with an ''h'' [h] approximant in Hakka and a voiceless alveo-palatal fricative (''x'' [ɕ]) in Mandarin.

==Phonology==
{{further|Meixian dialect}}

==Dialects==
Hakka has as many regional dialects as there are counties with Hakka speakers as the majority. Some of these Hakka dialects are not mutually intelligible with each other. Surrounding [[Mei County, Guangdong|Meixian]] are the counties of [[Pingyuan County, Guangdong|Pingyuan]], [[Dabu County|Dabu]], [[Jiaoling]], [[Xingning, Guangdong|Xingning]], [[Wuhua County|Wuhua]], and [[Fengshun]]. Each is said to have its own special phonological points of interest. For instance, Xingning lacks the codas {{IPA|[-m]}} and {{IPA|[-p]}}. These have merged into {{IPA|[-n]}} and {{IPA|[-t]}}, respectively. Further away from Meixian, the [[Hong Kong]] dialect lacks the {{IPA|[-u-]}} medial, so, whereas Meixian pronounces the character 光 as {{IPA|[kwɔŋ˦]}}, Hong Kong Hakka dialect pronounces it as {{IPA|[kɔŋ˧]}}, which is similar to the Hakka spoken in neighbouring [[Shenzhen]].

As much as endings and vowels are important, the tones also vary across the dialects of Hakka. The majority of Hakka dialects have six tones. However, there are dialects which have lost all of their  [[checked tone]] (Ru Sheng), and the characters originally of this tone class are distributed across the non-Ru tones. Such a dialect is [[Changting County|Changting]] which is situated in the Western Fujian province. Moreover, there is evidence of the retention of an earlier Hakka tone system in the dialects of [[Haifeng]] and [[Lufeng, Guangdong|Lufeng]] situated on coastal south eastern [[Guangdong]] province. They contain a yin-yang splitting in the Qu tone, giving rise to seven tones in all (with yin-yang registers in Ping and Ru tones and a Shang tone).

In Taiwan, there are two main dialects: [[Sixian dialect|Sixian]] and Hailu (alternatively known as Haifeng). Most Hakka dialect speakers found on [[Taiwan]] originated from these two regions. Sixian speakers come from Jiaying Prefecture ({{zh|t=嘉應}}), mainly from the four counties of Chengxiang (now [[Meixian]]), Zhengping (now [[Jiaoling]]), [[Xingning, Guangdong|Xingning]] and [[Pingyuan County, Guangdong|Pingyuan]]. The Hailu dialect contains [[postalveolar consonant]]s ({{IPA|[tʃ]}}, {{IPA|[tʃʰ]}}, {{IPA|[ʃ]}} and {{IPA|[ʒ]}}), which are uncommon in other southern Chinese varieties. [[Wuhua dialect|Wuhua]], [[Dabu dialect|Dabu]], and [[Xingning dialect]]s have two sets of fricatives and affricates.

*[[Zhaoan dialect]] ({{lang|zh|诏安客家話}})

''Ethnologue'' reports the dialects as ''Yue-Tai'' (Meixian, Wuhua, Raoping, Taiwan Kejia: Meizhou above), ''Yuezhong ''(Central Guangdong), ''Huizhou, Yuebei'' (Northern Guangdong), ''Tingzhou'' (Min-Ke), ''Ning-Long'' (Longnan), ''Yugui, Tonggu.''

==Vocabulary==

Like other southern Chinese varieties, Hakka retains single syllable words from earlier stages of Chinese; thus a large number of syllables are distinguished by tone and final consonant. This reduces the need for compounding or making words of more than one syllable. However, it is also similar to other Chinese varieties in having words which are made from more than one syllable.

==Writing systems==

Various dialects of Hakka have been written in a number of Latin orthographies, largely for religious purposes, since at least the mid-19th century.

Previously, the single largest work in Hakka was the [[New Testament]] and [[Psalms]] (1993, 1138 pp., see [http://www.worldscriptures.org/pages/chinesehakka.html The Bible in Chinese: Hakka]), but since 2012 that has been surpassed by the publication of the complete Hakka Bible known as the [[Hakka Bible: Today's Taiwan Hakka Version|Today's Taiwan Hakka Version]] and includes the [[Old Testament]] along with audio recordings. These works render Hakka in both romanization ([[pha̍k-fa-sṳ]]) and Han characters (including ones unique to Hakka) and are based on the dialects of Taiwanese Hakka speakers. The work of Biblical translation is being performed by missionaries of the [[Presbyterian Church in Canada]].

The popular ''[[The Little Prince]]'' has also been translated into Hakka (2000), specifically the [[Miaoli County|Miaoli]] dialect of Taiwan (itself a variant of the [[Sixian dialect]]). This also was dual-script, albeit using the [[Tongyong Pinyin]] scheme.

==Media==
The world's only primarily Hakka-language television channel is [[Hakka TV]] in Taiwan, a state-run broadcasting service started in 2003.

The '''Igogo festival''' is a [[Yoruba culture|Yoruba]] festival held in [[Owo, Nigeria]]. It is held annually in September to honor [[Queen Oronsen]], a mythical wife of [[Olowo Rerengejen|Rerengejen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.owo-kingdom.net/festivals.html|title=Festivals|work=www.owo-kingdom.net|accessdate=April 14, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160210201421/http://owo-kingdom.net/festivals.html|archivedate=February 10, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Igogo festival began over 600 years ago during the reign of the late Olowo Rerengejen. The monarch married Oronsen, a beautiful and affluent queen who had, unknown to the king, supernatural powers. She enriched the monarch and she was loved by the monarch. Queen Oronsen insisted on certain taboos. She insisted that nobody should grind [[Okra]] in her presence or pour water into the yard. In addition, anyone arriving from the farm must not lump a load of firewood. King Rerengejen cautioned his other wives not to carry out any of these activities.&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenationonlineng.net/owo-celebrates-igogo-festival/|title=Owo Celebrates Igogo Festival|work=The Nation Newspaper|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One day, Queen Oronsen had a rift with the other senior wives of the King. They conspired against her with the intention of violating her taboo while Rerengejen was not in the palace. Her taboo was violated and she left the palace.&lt;ref name="The Nation Newspaper" /&gt;

While she was running out of the palace, some palace guards and chiefs ran after her to bring her back, an effort that was futile.
She later felt tired and waited at a place called "Ugbo Laja" where she was persuaded to return to the palace. Her refusal frustrated the guards into forcefully capturing her but she disappeared into "Igbo Oluwa", now a sacred forest, leaving her head ties (oja) at "Ugbo Laja" which the guards returned to King Rerengejen. "Ugbo Laja" is now a sacred grove. Queen Orosen's terra cotta sculptured image from "Igbo Oluwa" by Ekpo Eyo stood at a distance to inform the Owo people that nothing will bring her back to the palace but that annually they should always sacrifice two hundred items of different articles, such as dried fish, [[kolanut]], Aligator pepper, bitter cola and many more for ritual (Igogo) and in return she promised to protect the Kingdom.&lt;ref name="BenardMoon2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Elisabeth Benard|author2=Beverly Moon|title=Goddesses Who Rule|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D50ob0i_e0MC&amp;pg=PA125|date=21 September 2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-535294-8|pages=125–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival features the dance of bare-chested men, the Iloro Quarter men called Ighares. They often wear white caps with two horns of buffalo in their hands. They struck these horns together while dancing around the town and visiting some sacred places in the town. During this rite, any animal that crosses their part automatically become their delicacy. The chief plait their hairs and dance round the town and visits their beloved ones who will give them a gift in return. The monarch often dress like women and dances round the town.

'''[[Intersex]] civil society organizations''' have existed since at least the mid-1980s. They include peer support groups and advocacy organizations active on [[Intersex medical interventions|health and medical issues]], [[Intersex human rights|human rights]], [[Legal recognition of intersex people|legal recognition]], and peer and family support. Some groups, including the earliest, were open to people with specific intersex traits, while others are open to people with many different kinds of intersex traits.

== History ==
Intersex peer support and advocacy organizations have existed since at least 1985, with the establishment of the [[Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last1 = Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia| last2 = Briffa| first2 = Anthony| author-link2 = Tony Briffa | title = Discrimination against People affected by Intersex Conditions: Submission to NSW Government| url = http://www.antidiscrimination.justice.nsw.gov.au/Documents/submission%20about%20intersex%20discrimination%20in%20nsw.pdf | date = 22 January 2003 | access-date = 2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group (UK) established in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aissg.org/INDEX.HTM | title = Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group (AISSG)| access-date = 2016-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Intersex Society of North America]] (ISNA) may have been one of the first intersex civil society organizations to have been open to people regardless of diagnosis; it was active from 1993 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dear ISNA Friends and Supporters | url = http://www.isna.org | date = 2008 | access-date= 2016-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resourcing ==
Intersex organizations are poorly resourced. An international report on ''The State of Trans* and Intersex Organizing'' by [[Global Action for Trans Equality]] and the [[American Jewish World Service]] in November 2013 found that, globally, "just over $40,000 addressed intersex issues" in 2010. At that time, "6% of all funding for human rights work went to promote LGBTI rights globally ($72.6 million out of $1.2 billion in total)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = [[Global Action for Trans Equality]] and [[American Jewish World Service]]| last1 = Eisfeld| first1 = Justus| last2 = Gunther| first2 = Sarah| last3 = Shlasko| first3 = Davey| title = The State of Trans* and Intersex Organizing: A case for increased support for growing but under-funded movements for human rights| location = New York| date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice]] established the first Intersex Human Rights Fund in 2015, in an attempt to address resourcing issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astraeafoundation.org/news/344/60/Introducing-the-Intersex-Fund-team-at-Astraea |title=Introducing the Intersex Fund team at Astraea! |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=June 16, 2015 |website= |publisher=Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice |access-date=2015-07-02 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703205803/http://www.astraeafoundation.org/news/344/60/Introducing-the-Intersex-Fund-team-at-Astraea |archivedate=July 3, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soginews.com/boost-intersex-activists-organisations/ |title=Boost for Intersex activists and organisations |author= |date=January 16, 2015 |website=SOGI News.com |publisher=[[Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights|RFSL]] |access-date=2015-07-02 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704060543/http://www.soginews.com/boost-intersex-activists-organisations/ |archivedate=July 4, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Intersex Forums ==
{{main|International Intersex Forum}}

International gatherings are known to have begun in the mid-1990s, including an [[Intersex Society of North America|ISNA]] retreat in 1996 that brought together activists from North America and New Zealand, and also a summer school organised by [[Organisation Intersex International|OII-France]] in 2006. The retreat is documented in a short movie entitled ''Hermaphrodites Speak''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isna.org/videos/hermaphrodites_speak Hermaphrodites Speak!], [[Intersex Society of North America]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/hermaphrodites-speak/oclc/213710290 Hermaphrodites speak], [[WorldCat]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and the film ''[[Intersexion]]'', and the summer school in a book, ''A qui appartiennent nos corps? Féminisme et luttes intersexes''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unil.ch/webdav/site/liege/shared/NQF/27_1/27_1.pdf {{fr icon}} A qui appartiennent nos corps?

[[International Intersex Forum]]s have taken place since 2011, organized by [[ILGA]]. These have brought together intersex activists and organisations from around the world, resulting in joint statements about human rights and bodily autonomy. The [[Malta declaration (International Intersex Forum)|Malta declaration]] of the third forum called for an end to 'normalising' practices, prenatal screening and selective abortions, infanticide and killings, and non-consensual sterilisation. It also made recommendations on sex assignments of intersex children and adults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/news/latest/intersex_forum_2013 3rd International Intersex Forum concluded] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204073813/http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/news/latest/intersex_forum_2013 |date=2013-12-04 }}, ILGA-Europe (Creative Commons statement), 2 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/global-intersex-community-affirms-shared-goals/113806 Global intersex community affirms shared goals], [[Star Observer]], December 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aiclegal.org/public-statement-by-the-third-international-intersex-forum/ Public Statement by the Third International Intersex Forum], [[Advocates for Informed Choice]], 12 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oii.org.au/24241/public-statement-by-the-third-international-intersex-forum/ Public statement by the third international intersex forum], [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]], 2 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nnid.nl/2013/12/03/derde-internationale-intersekse-forum/ {{nl icon}} Derde Internationale Intersekse Forum], Nederlandse Netwerk Intersekse/DSD (NNID), 3 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intersexualite.de/index.php/public-statement-third-international-intersex-forum/ {{de icon}} Public Statement by the Third International Intersex Forum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226074847/http://www.intersexualite.de/index.php/public-statement-third-international-intersex-forum/ |date=2013-12-26 }}, IVIM/OII-Germany, 1 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oii.tw/Home/3rd-is-forum-statement (Chinese) 2013 第三屆世界陰陽人論壇宣言], Oii-Chinese, December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jordanian Arabic''' is a continuum of mutually intelligible varieties of [[Levantine Arabic]] spoken by the population of the [[Jordan|Kingdom of Jordan]]. Jordanian Arabic varieties are [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], with lexical influences from English, Turkish and French. They are spoken by more than 6 million people, and understood throughout the [[Levant]] and, to various extents, in other Arabic-speaking regions. As in all Arab countries, language use in [[Jordan]] is characterized by [[diglossia]]; [[Modern Standard Arabic]] is the official language used in most written documents and the media, while daily conversation is conducted in the local colloquial varieties.

Aside from the various dialects, one must also deal with the differences in addressing males, females, and groups; plurals and verb conjugations are highly irregular and difficult to determine from their root letters; and there are several letters in the Arab alphabet that are difficult for an English speaker to pronounce.

== Regional Jordanian Arabic varieties ==
Although there is a common Jordanian dialect mutually understood by most Jordanians, the daily language spoken throughout the country varies significantly through regions. These variants impact altogether pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary.

The Jordanian Arabic comprises five varieties:

* Hybrid variety (Modern Jordanian): It is the most current spoken language among Jordanians. This variety was born after the designation of [[Amman]] as capital of the Jordanian kingdom early in the 20th century. It is the result of the merger of the language of populations who moved from northern Jordan, southern Jordan and later from Palestine. For this reason, it mixes features of the Arabic varieties spoken by these populations. The emergence of the language occurred under the strong influence of the northern Jordanian dialect. As in many countries [[English language|English]] is used to substitute many technical words, even though these words have Arabic counterparts in [[modern standard Arabic]].
* Northern varieties: Mostly spoken in the area from [[Amman]] to [[Irbid]] in the far north. As in all sedentary areas, local variations are many. The pronunciation has /q/ pronounced [g] and /k/ mostly ([tʃ]). This dialect is part of the southern dialect of the [[Levantine Arabic]] language.
* Southern/[[Moab]]: Spoken in the area south of [[Amman]], in cities such as [[Al Karak|Karak]], [[Tafilah]], [[Ma'an]], [[Shoubak]] and their countrysides, it is replete with city-to-city and village-to-village differences. In this dialect, the pronunciation of the final vowel (æ~a~ə) commonly written with tāʾ marbūtah (ة) is raised to [e]. For example, Maktaba ''(Fuṣḥa)'' becomes Maktabe ''(Moab)'', Maktabeh ''(North)'' and Mektaba ''(Bedawi)''. Named after the ancient [[Moab]] kingdom that was located in southern [[Jordan]], this dialect belongs to the outer southern dialect of the [[Levantine Arabic]] language.
* Bedouin: Is spoken by Bedouins mostly in the desert east of the Jordanian mountains and high plateau, and belongs to the [[Bedawi Arabic]]. This dialect is not widely used in other regions. It is often considered as truer to the Arabic language, but this is a subjective view that shows no linguistic evidence. Note that non-Bedouin is also spoken in some of the towns and villages in the Badia region east of Jordan's mountain heights plateau, such as [[Azraq|Al-Azraq]] oasis.
* [[Aqaba]] variety

==Pronunciation==

===General remarks===
The following sections focus on modern Jordanian.

There is no standard way to write Jordanian Arabic. The sections below use the alphabet used in standard Arabic dialect studies, and the mapping to IPA is given.

===Stress===
One syllable of every Jordanian word has more stress than the other syllables of that word. Some meaning is communicated in Jordanian by the location of the stress or the tone of the vowel. This is much truer than in other Western languages in the sense that changing the stress position changes the meaning (e.g. ['katabu] means ''they wrote'' while [katabu'] means ''they wrote it''). This means one has to listen and pronounce the stress carefully.

===Consonants===
There are some phonemes of the Jordanian language that are easily pronounced by English speakers; others are completely foreign to English, making these letters difficult to pronounce.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Phoneme !! IPA !! Explanation
|-
| /b/ || [b] || As English ''b.''
|-
| /t/|| [t] || As French or Spanish ''t'' (without the English aspiration).
|-
| /ṯ/|| [θ] || As English ''thief''. It is rare, mostly in words borrowed from [[Modern Standard Arabic|MSA]]. 
|-
| /j/|| [dʒ] || Either hard [dʒ] as in English ''jam'' or soft [ʒ] as in English ''vision'' (depending on accent and individual speaker's preference).
|-
| /ḥ/ || [ħ] || This ''h'' is pronounced deep in the throat, deeper than English ''h''. Imagine you want to blow fog on your sunglasses.
|-
| /ẖ/ || [x] || As German ''ch'' in ''ach!'' or as Spanish ''jota''.
|-
| /d/ || [d] || As English ''d''
|-
| /ḏ/ || [ð] || As English ''this''. It is rare, mostly in words borrowed from [[Modern Standard Arabic|MSA]].
|-
| /r/ || [ɾˤ] || Simultaneous pronunciation of ''r'' and a weak ''ayn'' below.
|-
| /ṛ/ || [ɾ] || As is Scottish, Italian or Spanish.
|-
| /z/ || [z] || As English ''z.''
|-
| /s/ || [s] || As English ''s.''
|-
| /š/ || [ʃ] || As English ''sh.''
|-
| /ṣ/ || [sˤ] || Simultaneous pronunciation of ''s'' and a weak ''ayn'' below.
|-
| /ḍ/ || [dˤ] || Simultaneous pronunciation of ''d'' and a weak ''ayn'' below.
|-
| /ṭ/ || [tˤ] || Simultaneous pronunciation of ''d'' and a weak ''ayn'' below.
|-
| /ẓ/ || [zˤ] || Simultaneous pronunciation of ''z'' and a weak ''ayn'' below.
|-
| /ʿ/ || [ʕ] || This is the ''ayn''. It is pronounced as /ḥ/ but with vibrating larynx. It is a voiced pharyngeal fricative sound produced as deep as possible in the throat.
|-
| /ġ/ || [ɣ] || As Spanish pagar, or Greek gato; similar also to ''r'' in Parisian French or German.
|-
| /f/ || [f] || As English.
|-
| /q/ || [q] || It is a voiceless occlusive as [k], but pronounced further back in the mouth, at the [[uvula]]. It is rare, mostly in words borrowed from [[Modern Standard Arabic|MSA]] apart from the dialect of Ma'daba or that of the Hauran Druzes.
|-
| /k/ || [k] || As French or Spanish [k] in ''ca,co,cu'' (without the English aspiration).
|-
| /l/ || [l] || As English ''list'' (never a dark ''l'' as in ''call'').
|-
| /m/ || [m] || As English.
|-
| /n/ || [n] || As English.
|-
| /h/ || [h] || As English.
|-
| /w/ || [w] || As English.
|-
| /y/ || [j] || As English in ''yet'', ''yellow'' etc.
|}

===Vowels===
Contrasting with the rich consonant inventory, Jordanian Arabic has much fewer vowels than English. Yet, as in English, vowel duration is relevant (compare /i/ in ''bin'' and ''bean'').

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Phoneme !! IPA !! Explanation
|-
| /a/ || [a] or [ɑ] || As English ''hut'' or ''hot'' (the latter linked to the presence of ṣ, ḍ, ṭ, ẓ, ẖ, ʿ, ḥ or ṛ).
|-
| /ā/|| [a:] or [ɑ:] || The previous one but longer (you hear [ɑ:] in ''father''). Amman is [ʕɑm'ma:n].
|-
| /i/|| [ı] || As in English ''hit.''
|-
| /ī/|| [i:] || As in English ''heat.''
|-
| /u/|| [u] || As in English ''put.''
|-
| /ū/|| [u:] || As in English ''fool.''
|-
| /e/ || [e] || French ''été.''
|-
| /ē/ || [e:] || As in English ''pear'', or slightly more closed.
|-
| /o/ || [o] || As in French ''côté.''
|-
| /ō/ || [o:] || As French (''faune'') or German (''Sohn'').
|}

Note : It is tempting to consider /e/ and /i/ as variants of the same phoneme /i/, as well as /o/ and /u/. For the case of e/i, one can oppose 'ente' (you, masculine singular) to 'enti' (you, feminine singular), which makes the difference relevant at least at the end of words.

==Grammar==
The grammar in Jordanian is quite the mixture. Much like [[Hebrew]] and [[Arabic]], Jordanian is a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]] at heart, altered by the many influences that developed over the years.

===Article definitions===
;el/il- : This is used in most words that don't start with a vowel in the beginning of a sentence. It is affixed onto the following word.
''Il-bāb'' or ''el-port'' meaning ''the door.''

;e()-:A modified "el" used in words that start with a consonant produced by the blade of the tongue (t, ṭ, d, ḍ, r, z, ẓ, ž, s, ṣ, š, n. Sometimes [l] and [j] as well depending on the dialect). This causes a doubling of the consonant.
This e is pronounced as in a rounded short backward vowel or as in an ''e'' followed by the first letter of the word that follows the article. For example: ''ed-desk'' meaning ''the desk'', ''ej-jakét'' meaning ''the jacket'', ''es-seks'' meaning ''the sex'' or ''hāda' et-téléfón'' meaning ''that is the telephone.''

;l': This is elided into '''&lt;nowiki&gt;l'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' when the following word starts with a vowel. For example: l'yüniversiti meaning ''the University'', l'üniform meaning ''the uniform'' or l'ēyen meaning ''the eye''.
'''&lt;nowiki&gt;'l&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''
: Because of Arabic phonology, the definite article can be also elided onto the preceding word on the condition that it ends with a vowel and the word following the article starts with a constant that doesn't require an '''''e()-''', ''it is elided into an '''''&lt;nowiki&gt;'l&lt;/nowiki&gt;''''' and affixed to the end of the word. For example: ''Lámma'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''l''' kompyütar bıştağel'' means ''when the computer works.''

===Pronouns===
;ana: I (singular)(male)(female) (Modern Dialect)
;enta: You (singular)(male) (Modern Dialect)
;enti: You (singular)(female) (Modern Dialect)
;entu: You (plural)(male) (Modern Dialect)
;enten: You (plural)(female) (Hardly used any more)
;huwwe: He (Standard Dialect)
;hiyye: She (Modern Dialect)
;hiyya: She (Eastern and Southern Dialect)
;humme: They (plural)(male) (Modern Dialect)
;henne: They (plural)(female) (Hardly used any more)
;ıħna: We (Modern Dialect)

Note: The Modern dialect is understood by almost everyone in the country and the entire region.

===Possessiveness===
Similar to ancient and modern semitic languages, Jordanian adds a suffix to a word to indicate possession.

;ktāb: book
;ktāb-i: my book
;ktāb-ak: your book (singular, male)
;ktāb-ek: your book (singular, female)
;ktāb-kom: your book (plural, male)
;ktāb-ken: your book (plural, female, bedouin)
;ktāb-o: his book
;ktāb-ha: her book
;ktāb-hom: their book (plural, male)
;ktāb-hen: their book (plural, female bedouin)
;ktāb-na: our book

===General sentence structure===
In a sentence, the pronouns change into prefixes to adjust to the verb, its time and its actor. In present perfect and participle with a verb that starts with a consonant ''Ana'' becomes ''ba'', ''Inta'' becomes 'Bt', ''Inti'' becomes ''Bıt'' and so-on.

For example: The verb ''hıb'' means ''to love'', Ba'''hıb''' means ''I love'', Bt'''hıb''' means ''you love'', Bahıbo means ''I love him'', Bıthıbha means ''she loves her'', Bahıbhom means ''I love them'', Bahıbhālí means ''I love myself''.

''Qdar'' is the infinitive form of the verb ''can''. Baqdar means ''I can'', I can't is ''Baqdareş'', adding an '''eş''' or and '''ış''' to the end of a verb makes it [[Negation in Arabic|negative]]; if the word ends in a vowel then a ''ş'' should be enough.

An in-depth example of the negation: Baqdarelhomm figuratively means ''I can handle them'', Baqdarelhommeş means ''I cannot handle them'', the same statement meaning can be achieved by ''Baqdareş l'ıl homm''

==Legal status and writing systems==
The Jordanian Levantine is not regarded as the official language even though has diverged significantly from Classic Arabic and [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (MSA), or even the colloquial MSA.&lt;ref name="iguide1"&gt;[http://iguide.travel/Jordanian_Arabic_phrasebook Jordanian Arabic phrasebook – iGuide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006002713/http://iguide.travel/Jordanian_Arabic_phrasebook |date= 6 October 2011 }}.

Itunes.apple.com (16 February 2007). Retrieved on 19 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of Jordanians, however, will call their language "Arabic" while they will refer to the original Arabic language as [[Modern Standard Arabic|Fusħa]]. This is common in many countries that speak languages or dialects derived from Arabic and can prove to be quite confusing. The writing system varies; whenever a book is published, it is usually published in English, French, or in MSA and not in Levantine.&lt;ref name="iguide1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ethnologue1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apple1"/&gt; There are many ways of representing Levantine Arabic in writing. The most common is the scholastic Jordanian Latin alphabet system which uses many accents to distinguish between the letters (this system is used within this article). Other Levantine countries, however, use their own alphabets and transliterations, making cross-border communication inconvenient.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HuXAHGDSjNIC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=levantine+transliteration&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8mrXH3ghf5&amp;sig=EsEQ_3OIitV_czj-MUfqdfcE_fo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xRLUTP-EAYmgnQfNrrTvBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=levantine%20transliteration&amp;f=false Syria – Diana Darke – Google Books]. Books.google.com. Retrieved on 19 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==External Influences==
[[British English]] has a great influence on Jordanian Levantine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lit.az/ijar/pdf/jes/2/JES2010%282-5%29.pdf |accessdate=23 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008153258/http://www.lit.az/ijar/pdf/jes/2/JES2010%282-5%29.pdf |archivedate= 8 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the region. English is widely understood in many regions, especially in the western part of the country. English vocabulary has been adopted replacing native Arabic vocabulary in many cases. [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] is spoken in formal TV programs, and in Modern Standard Arabic classes, it is used to quote poetry and historical phrases. It is also the language used to write and read in formal situations if English is not being used. However, formal Arabic is never spoken during regular conversations, and can prove to be difficult because it removes loan words from English or French origins and replaces them with proper Standard Arabic-derived nouns and verbs. [[Modern Standard Arabic]] is taught in most schools and a large number of Jordanian citizens are proficient in reading and writing formal Arabic. However, foreigners residing in Jordan who learn the Levantine language generally find it difficult to comprehend formal MSA, particularly if they did not attend a school that teaches it.

Other influences include French, [[Turkish Language|Turkish]] and [[Persian language|Persian.]] Many loan words from these languages can be found in the Jordanian dialects, though not so much as English. However, students also have the option of learning French in schools. Currently, there is a small society of French speakers called Francophone and it is quite notable in the country. The language is also spoken by people who are interested in the cultural and commercial features of France.

'''"Kitty"''' is an episode of [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]. Kitty introduced [[FBI Agent]] [[Avery Ryan]] from [[CSI: Cyber]] which this episode served as the [[backdoor pilot]] of the series. Despite being credited [[Jorja Fox]] and [[Jon Wellner]] who portray [[Sara Sidle]] and [[Henry Andrews (CSI)|Henry Andrews]] do not appear in this episode (although the latter does appear in a deleted scene).

==Plot==
The episode begins with a house's security system being disabled. Then a dark figure walks into a bedroom and murders the woman in the bedroom. The scene cuts to [[Jim Brass]] ([[Paul Guilfoyle]]) yelling orders at the police officers and trying to get rid of the press. [[Nick Stokes]] ([[George Eads]]) catches up with a suspect ([[Gil Bellows]]) and tests him for [[Gunshot residue|GSR]] which comes back positive so he is arrested. [[D.B. Russell]] ([[Ted Danson]]) enters the house and he notices that the technology seems to follow him and the lights turn on when he walks past them. [[Greg Sanders]] ([[Eric Szmanda]]) tells D.B. that he believes the house is a [[Home automation|smart house]]. While [[Julie Finlay]] ([[Elisabeth Shue]]) is taking crime scene photos, [[Al Robbins]] ([[Robert David Hall]]) gives a brief belief of what he believes happened. When D.B. looks through the suspect's (revealed as the victim's husband Lee Berman) computer he notices a photo of a woman ([[Torrey DeVitto]]) but then the computer crashes. The scene cuts to [[Washington, D.C.]] where a woman (Avery Ryan, [[Patricia Arquette]]) from the [[FBI]] is sitting on the phone demanding a flight to [[Las Vegas]] because the Kitty case is involved in a murder.

At an airfield Avery arrives where a pilot complains about her wanting to stop at Vegas, she then tells the pilot things he doesn't like about himself and he quickly tells her that she can come.

In Las Vegas, Brass is interviewing Berman about his wife's murder. It is shown that Avery is watching the interview, Avery asks [[Conrad Ecklie]] ([[Marc Vann]]) if she can go in and interview. Avery starts to quiz Berman about Kitty. Berman demands his solicitors to leave the room but when Avery tells him that she knows when people are lying he calls his solicitors back in.

D.B., Julie, Nick and [[David Hodges (CSI)|David Hodges]] look for Kitty in the database, Avery explains about the deep web and then gets one of her agents to log into Kitty's website and they use Hodges' name to log in the site. Avery shows them that Kitty is just a chat bot.

In his office, Avery talks to D.B. about the case and requests Finlay to assist her to review the computer. Avery manages to retrieve the data from Berman's computer and they learn that there was a two-way camera on the computer. Avery and Finlay conclude that Berman unknowingly made a [[sex tape]]. Avery notices Kitty massaging her jaw and investigates further.

In the morgue, [[David Phillips (CSI)|David Phillips]] ([[David Berman (actor)|David Berman]]) gives D.B. a bullet. while Robbins is performing the [[autopsy]].

[[Morgan Brody]] ([[Elisabeth Harnois]]) tells D.B. that the bullet found doesn't match Berman's bullets. Berman is then released from custody and he walks past the police station reception and sees a woman (also DeVitto) who is identical to Kitty. Avery explains to the woman (whose name is Susan) that she is a person of interest. Susan tells Avery that she is on Friend Agenda. Avery notes to Susan that she has an "idiosyncratic medical condition".

Avery and Susan work out that Susan's top hit on her profile is the one who created Kitty. Meanwhile, Ecklie tells Berman to stay at the hotel where he learns that Berman doesn't have a dog so Nick takes the dog to Hodges while Greg is briefing how the killer knew the house. The three learn that the killer got a dog to fool the security at the house.

Brass finds the car rented by the killer and he and Nick go to the car where it was empty as a plane flies overhead they realize the killer has fled the country. Nick takes the evidence back to the office and briefs D.B. and Avery. There was a video of the murder where Avery realizes that her suspect was never in Las Vegas.

Avery and Nick look at Nebula1's ([[Cheyenne Jackson]]) first profile picture, and learn that he is [[agoraphobic]] and orders in a lot. They then learn that he is in [[St Louis]] due to them being able to make out the [[Gateway Arch]] in the background. When FBI agents raid his house they find computers with Kitty on them all and then Avery realizes it is a trap and they lose all evidence.

Avery organises a press conference where Susan tells her story. After the conference Avery is informed that Nebula1 has crashed Susan's profile.

In [[San Diego]], Avery confronts Nebula1, he then attacks Avery and cuts her with his knife. Avery says her code word and he is then arrested.

At the end, Avery arranges for Susan's husband to come home. As she is leaving Avery tells D.B. about a bank robbery of three cents from 80 million chequing accounts.

'''Koreans in Peru''' ({{lang-es|coreanos en Perú}}) formed [[Latin America]]'s seventh-largest [[Korean diaspora]] community {{as of|2011|lc=on}}, according to the statistics of [[South Korea]]'s [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (South Korea)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]].&lt;ref name="MOFAT2011"/&gt; They are relatively small in size compared to the other [[Asian Peruvian|Asian communities in Peru]].

==Migration history==
The first Korean migrant to Peru is believed to have been [[Park Man-bok]], who was invited to Peru to coach the [[Peru women's national volleyball team|women's national]] [[volleyball]] team in 1972. Under his tutelage, the team would go on to a variety of successes in the 1980s, culminating in the winning of a [[silver medal]] [[Peru at the 1988 Summer Olympics|for their country]] at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]].&lt;ref name="Araki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Park"&gt;{{citation|last=Park|first=Chae-soon|chapter=La emigración coreana en América Latina y sus perspectivas|title=Segundo Congreso del Consejo de Estudios Latinoamericanos de Asia y de Oceania|publisher=Latin American Studies Association of Korea|publication-place=Seoul|date=2007|url=http://www.lasak.or.kr/CELAOfiles/papers/Session3/Park%20Chae%20Soon%5BSession3-2%5D.pdf|accessdate=2008-09-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217010906/http://www.lasak.or.kr/CELAOfiles/papers/Session3/Park%20Chae%20Soon%5BSession3-2%5D.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.elcomercio.com.pe/ediciononline/HTML/2008-09-07/artieda-aprendi-mucho-man-bok-park.html|date=7 September 2008|accessdate=2008-09-27|periodical=El Comercio|publication-place=Peru|first=David|last=Hidalgo Jiménez|title=Artieda: 'Aprendí mucho de Man Bok Park'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=The Chosun Ilbo|publication-place=South Korea|date=17 December 2007|url=http://www.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2007/12/17/2007121700023.html|accessdate=2008-09-27|title=‘페루의 히딩크’ 박만복, 메이드 인 코리아 홍보 전사로 ("Peru's Hiddink" Park Man-bok, to work as publicity officer for Made in Korea products)|last=Yi|first=Yi-yeol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, few of Park's countrymen joined him in Peru; as late as 1985, there were only nine Korean families resident in the country, totalling 27 individuals.&lt;ref name="Araki"/&gt; A large portion did not come directly from Korea, but had instead first settled in [[Bolivia]], [[Paraguay]], or [[Chile]]. The population began to increase in 1993, as the economic and social situation in Peru stabilised; during the 1990s, roughly two or three new Korean families arrived in Peru every month.&lt;ref name="Araki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Park"/&gt; However, after 1997, their population fell by nearly 56% from 1,774 to just 788 by 2005, largely due to outward migration to [[Mexico]] and [[Guatemala]] in 1998 and 1999; some of those who had arrived via Chile also returned there.&lt;ref name="Araki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MOFAT"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.okf.or.kr/data/status_SA.jsp|title=재외동포현황 - 중남미 (Status of overseas compatriots - Central/South America)|publisher=Overseas Korean Foundation|date=2005|accessdate=2008-09-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414101829/http://www.okf.or.kr/data/status_SA.jsp|archivedate=2009-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2011, Peru's Korean population had recovered slightly to 1,305. According to South Korean government statistics, 24 took up [[Peruvian nationality law|Peruvian nationality]], 342 stayed in Peru as permanent residents, 30 were [[international student]]s, and the remaining 909 had other kinds of visas.&lt;ref name="MOFAT2011"/&gt;

==Professions==
The economic profile of the Korean community in Peru is widely varied and has continued to shift over the years. In the 1980s, many were involved in [[calamari]] fishing. The roughly 900 Koreans resident in Peru in 2001 included among their number 500 business people, 90 representatives of the South Korean government, 48 factory owners, 39 religious workers, and 25 sportspeople.&lt;ref name="Park"/&gt; Many businesspeople are involved in the import of products from South Korea, especially [[used car]]s, [[computer]]s, and [[Heavy equipment (construction)|construction equipment]]; however, the largest portion of Koreans in Peru are involved with the textile industry.&lt;ref name="Araki"/&gt;

Aside from Park Man-bok, other Koreans have made notable contributions to [[sport in Peru]].

Despite the small size of its Korean population, Peru was the site of a major precedent for Korean immigrants' political integration when the city of [[Chanchamayo, Junín]] elected Mario Jung (정흥원, also spelled Mario Yung) as its mayor in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=104&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0004867100|title=페루서 중남미 첫 한인시장 탄생 {{bracket|In Peru, South America's first Korean mayor}}|periodical=[[Yonhap News]]|date=2011-01-14|accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jung thus became the first mayor of Korean descent not just in Peru but in all of South America, even though neighbouring countries such as [[Korean Brazilian|Brazil have larger Korean populations]] and a much longer history of migration from Korea.&lt;ref name="MunhwaIlbo20110114"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.munhwa.com/news/view.html?no=2011011401073732274002|title=페루서 중남미 이민 106년 역사상 첫 한인시장 탄생; 정흥원씨 찬차마요 시장선거 압승… 4년 임기 시작 {{bracket|In Peru, South America's first Korean mayor in 106 years of immigration; Mr. Jeong Hong-won ascends to mayoralty of Chanchamayo and begins his four-year term}}|periodical=[[Munhwa Ilbo]]|date=2011-01-14|accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jung, a [[South Korean nationality law|South Korean citizen]], had originally [[Koreans in Argentina|settled in Argentina]] in 1986 before coming to Peru in 1996.&lt;ref name="MunhwaIlbo20110114"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.asiatoday.co.kr/news/view.asp?seq=439844|title=페루서 106년 만에 첫 한인시장 ‘빈민의 대부 정흥원’; 35년 남미지역에서 보냈지만 아직도 한국국적 유지해 {{bracket|In Peru, the first Korean mayor in 106 years, 'second father to the poor Jeong Hong-won'; retains Korean nationality despite living in South America for 35 years}}|periodical=Asia Today|date=2011-01-14|accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politically, Jung is a supporter of [[Fujimorism]], and was known locally for his charitable work with the poor. Peruvian law requires that the [[president of Peru|president]] and members of [[Congress of the Republic of Peru|Congress]] be [[Peruvian nationality law|Peruvian citizens]], but does not place any requirements on lower-level politicians. Jung's inauguration was attended by South Korean consul Lee You-bum on behalf of ambassador Han Byung-kil.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.larepublica.pe/05-01-2011/coreano-fujimorista-asume-como-alcalde-de-chanchamayo|title=Coreano fujimorista asume como alcalde de Chanchamayo|periodical=La Republica|date=2011-01-05|accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://elcomercio.pe/peru/694138/noticia-video-coreano-juro-como-nuevo-alcalde-chanchamayo|title=Video: coreano juró como nuevo alcalde de Chanchamayo|periodical=El Comercio|date=2011-01-05|accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Unlike the surrounding population, many Koreans in Peru are [[Protestantism|Protestant]] rather than [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]]. The largest Korean church in Peru, the Iglesia Evangélica Coreana, claims roughly 250 attendees. However, Korean Catholics in Peru also have a parish devoted to them, the Parroquia San Andrés Kim, named for the Korean saint [[Andrew Kim Taegon]].&lt;ref name="Araki"/&gt;

{{LGBT rights}}

[[Image:Cela.jpg|thumb|The only protective custody available to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender prisoners is often in segregated isolation.]]

'''[[Lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]]''' ('''[[LGBT]]''') '''prisoners''' often face additional challenges compared to non-LGBT prisoners.&lt;ref name="LA Weekly"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ucar|first1=Ani|title=In the Gay Wing of L.A. Men's Central Jail, It's Not Shanks and Muggings But Hand-Sewn Gowns and Tears|url=http://www.laweekly.com/informer/2014/11/18/in-the-gay-wing-of-la-mens-central-jail-its-not-shanks-and-muggings-but-hand-sewn-gowns-and-tears?showFullText=true|publisher=LA Weekly|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Just Detention International]], LGBT inmates are "among the most vulnerable in the prison population". 67% of [[Relationships for incarcerated individuals|LGBT prisoners]] in California report being assaulted while in prison.&lt;ref name="TLC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meeting to Highlight Issues Faced by LGBT People in California Prisons|url=http://transgenderlawcenter.org/new/index.php/updates/press-releases/meeting-to-highlight-issues-faced-by-lgbt-people-in-california-prisons/108|publisher=Transgender Law Center|accessdate=2008-12-28}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The vulnerability of LGBT prisoners has led some prisons to separate them from other prisoners, while in others they are housed with the general population.

While much of the available data on LGBT inmates comes from the [[United States]], [[Amnesty International]] maintains records of known incidents internationally in which LGBT prisoners and those perceived to be lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender have suffered torture, ill-treatment and violence at the hands of fellow inmates as well as prison officials.&lt;ref name="AI"&gt;{{cite web |title=Crimes of Hate, Conspiracy of Silence: Torture and Ill-treatment based on Sexual Identity|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ACT40/016/2001/ar/|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coming out==

Many LGBT inmates who are able, even those who are [[openly gay]] outside of prison, stay in [[the closet]] with their [[sexual identity|sexual identities]] while imprisoned, because inmates who are known or perceived as gay, especially lesbians and gay men with stereotypically [[Butch and femme|butch]] or [[effeminate]] characteristics, respectively, face "a very high risk of sexual abuse".&lt;ref name="HRW4"&gt;{{cite web |title=No Escape: Male Rape in US Prisons|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2001/prison/report4.html|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denial of access to surgical sex reassignment on the grounds of unstable or criminal behaviour condemns those who are transsexual. Resulting in potential continuing identity confusion, low self-esteem, drug and alcohol abuse, self-mutilation and acting out behaviour. Which further facilitates the vicious cycle of chronic dysfunction, which perpetuates criminal behaviour.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Drawn from CANADIAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL File No. T505/2298&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transgender issues==
Many transgender prisoners need resources and support, and much work remains to be done. Some organizations that used to focus on women's issues have expanded to include transgender people and gender non-conforming people in their work.&lt;ref&gt;Sudbury, Julia. "Rethinking Global Justice: Black Women Resist the Transnational Prison-Industrial Complex." Souls: A Critical Journal of Black Politics, Culture, and Society 10.4 (2008)  344–360. Web. &lt;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/ 10999940802523885&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Certain actions can and do improve the lives of trans prisoners. The papers [http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/tma/vol5/iss1/3/ "Transitioning Our Prisons Toward Affirmative Law: Examining the Impact of Gender Classification Policies on U.S. Transgender Prisoners"] and [http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/20956491/treatment-transgender-prisoners-not-just-american-problem-comparative-analysis-american-australian-canadian-prison-policies-concerning-treatment-transgender-prisoners-a-universal-recommendation-improve "The Treatment of Transgender Prisoners, Not Just an American Problem – A Comparative Analysis of American, Australian, and Canadian Prison Policies Concerning the Treatment of Transgender Prisoners and a 'Universal' Recommendation To Improve Treatment"] maintain that individuals should always be addressed and placed based on their gender identity rather than their genitalia.

===Italy===
In 2010 it was reported that Italy was to open its first transgender prison at Pozzale, a decision welcomed by gay rights groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Italy 'to open first prison for transgender inmates'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8455191.stm|newspaper=BBC|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
The bill mentioned in "Transgender Prisoners: A Critical Analysis of Queensland Corrective Services' New Procedure" has shown to be largely ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Samiec, Jenny. "Transgender Prisoners: A Critical Analysis of Queensland Corrective Services' New Procedure." Queensland Law Student Review 2.1 (2009)  32–44. Web &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.uq.edu.au/articles/qlsr/samiec-qlsr-2-1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422150036/http://www.law.uq.edu.au/articles/qlsr/samiec-qlsr-2-1.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-22 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Transgender prisoners are vulnerable in U.S. prisons due to a general policy of housing them according to their birth-assigned gender or genital configuration (i.e. post-op trans women would be placed in women's prisons), regardless of their current appearance or [[gender identity]].&lt;ref name="LA Weekly"/&gt; Transgender women with [[breast]]s may be locked up with men, leaving them vulnerable to violence and sexual assault, as occurred with the case of [[Dee Farmer]], a [[Sex reassignment surgery|pre-operative]] [[Trans woman|transgender woman]] with [[breast implants]], who was raped and contracted HIV when she was housed in a men's prison. [[Transman|Transgender men]] housed in [[women's prisons]] also face abuse, often more from guards than other inmates.&lt;ref name="Gay.com"/&gt;

Access to [[Hormone replacement therapy (transgender)|hormone replacement therapy]], appropriate psychological counseling, bras, and other supportive underclothing helps individuals to live as the gender that they self-identify with. Some courts in the US have ruled that it is a necessary medical treatment to provide hormone therapy for transgender prisoners. California Medical Facility, Vacaville, provides this medical treatment for male-to-female prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=  Magnani|first1= Laura|last2= Wray |first2= Harmon L.|date= 2006 |title= Beyond Prisons: A New Interfaith Paradigm for Our Failed Prison System|location= Minneapolis, Minnesota |publisher= Fortress Press|pages= 119–120 |isbn= 9781451412833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons announced a reversion of its guidelines. Previously, transgender prisoners would be housed according to the gender with which they identify. Now, housing will once again be determined by biological sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Caspani|first1=Maria|title=Trump Administration Rolls Back Protections For Transgender Prison Inmates|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-administration-rolls-back-protections-for-transgender-prison-inmates_us_5af72b7be4b032b10bfb3358|accessdate=18 May 2018|agency=Reuters|publisher=Huffington Post|date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 14, 2013, Harris County, Texas adopted an LGBT inmate policy. This policy is intended to protect and assure equal treatment of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender inmates. This allows individuals to be housed based on the gender they identify with instead of their biological sex. The policy also outlines how inmates will be searched. It includes a "safe zone project" that will endorse a "positive relationship of solidarity" connecting the sheriff's department and the gay community. Another important policy states that members of the transgender community will be referred to by their chosen name, even if it has not legally been changed, both when spoken to and on their identifications bracelets. The sheriff's office in Harris County has a training and certification program for staff members to become a "gender classification specialist" and have authorization to hold discussions with inmates about gender issues.&lt;ref&gt;Plushnick-Masti, Ramit. &lt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/14/texas-lgbt-inmate-policy-_n_4273859.html. Huffington Post. Retrieved on 18 Dec. 2014&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the National Transgender Discrimination Survey found that 35% of black transgender Americans have been incarcerated simply due to perceived anti-trans bias, compared to 4% of white transgender respondents. Black transgender people had higher rates of experiences of incarceration in general (47% compared to 12% of white transgender people). It also found that black trans women were sexually assaulted in jail at a rate of 38%, compared to 12% of white trans women prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf|title=Injustice at Every Turn: A Report of the National Transgender Discrimination Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 [[Dean Spade]], a lawyer who is also transgender, founded the [[Sylvia Rivera Law Project]] which provides free legal services and uses education to end institutional discrimination against transgender people. The Sylvia Rivera Law Project runs the Prison Rights Project, which 'supports low income transgender people and transgender people of color involuntarily held in prison, jail, lock-up and immigration detention obtain life-sustaining services'.

==Conjugal visits==

A [[conjugal visit]] is a scheduled extended visit during which an inmate of a prison is permitted to spend several hours or days in private with visitors, usually family members, in special rooms, trailers or even decorated, apartment-like settings on prison grounds. While the parties may engage in sexual intercourse, in practice an inmate may have several visitors, including children, as the generally recognized basis for permitting such a visit is to preserve family bonds and increase the chances of success for a prisoner's eventual return to life outside prison. Laws on conjugal visits vary widely by country from a total prohibition to very permissive policies. In jurisdictions where there is some form of recognition of same-sex relationships, prisoners may be permitted conjugal visits with a same-sex partner.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;As of December, 2008, homosexual behaviour remains illegal in over 80 countries (see [[Homosexuality laws of the world]]). Only countries that allow same-sex conjugal visits, or where same-sex conjugal visitation rights have been addressed in law are included on this list, in addition to a sub-list of countries that do not allow conjugal visitation for any inmates at all.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, conjugal visits are allowed only in four states: California, Connecticut, New York and Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalzoom.com/marriage-divorce-family-law/marriage-domestic-partnership/conjugal-visits-preserving-family-bonds|title=Conjugal Visits: Preserving family bonds behind bars|date=7 September 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Same-sex conjugal visitation by country===

;[[Argentina]]
:Opposite-sex conjugal visits have long been permitted, but a case in the central province of [[Cordoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] has authorized same-sex conjugal visits as well.  The ruling came after an inmate was twice punished with solitary confinement for having sex with his visiting partner in his cell.  The inmate brought a lawsuit on the basis of a law that obliges authorities to "guarantee (the availability of) intimate relations for prisoners with their spouses or, alternatively, with their (partners)."&lt;ref name="LAHT"&gt;{{cite web |title=Judge OKs conjugal visits for gay prisoners|url=http://www.laht.com/article.asp?CategoryId=14093&amp;ArticleId=206402|publisher=Latin American Herald Tribune|accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Australia]]
:In Australia, conjugal visits are only permitted in the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria. This includes visits by partners of the same-sex, provided they are not also incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25604033-12377,00.html | title=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conjugal visits of any type are not allowed in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Western Australia and the Northern Territory.

;[[Belgium]]
:Both men and women are entitled to conjugal visitation as heterosexual couples. Belgium's prisons provide facilities where inmates can meet their spouses once a month for a maximum of two uninterrupted hours. There are however circumstances, as they apply to heterosexual couples as well,  where these conjugal visits can be revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waterfield|first1=Bruno|title=Two male convicts marry in Belgian jail|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2687467/Two-male-convicts-marry-in-Belgian-jail.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Brazil]]
:In February 2015 inmates who register their same sex partner have the right to conjugal visitations in all of Brazil's jails.  This decision was reached by the National Criminal and Penitentiary Council. The conjugal visit must be guaranteed at least once a month and cannot be prohibited or suspended as a disciplinary measure with the exception of certain cases where violations being restricted are linked to the improper use of conjugal visitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazil Approves Conjugal Visits for Gay Inmates|url=http://laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=404257&amp;CategoryId=14090|website=Latin American Herald Tribune|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Canada]]
:All inmates, with the exception of those on disciplinary restrictions or at risk for family violence, are permitted "Private Family Visits" of up to 72 hours' duration once every two months.  Eligible visitors, who may not themselves be prison inmates, are: spouse, or common-law partner of at least six months; children; parents; [[foster parent]]s; siblings; [[grandparent]]s; and "persons with whom, in the opinion of the institutional head, the inmate has a close familial bond."  Food is provided by the institution but paid by the inmates and visitors, who are also responsible for cleaning the unit after the visit. During a visit, staff members have regular contact with the inmate and visitors.&lt;ref name="CSC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Private Family Visiting|url=http://www.csc-scc.gc.ca/text/pblct/visit/index-eng.shtml|publisher=Correctional Service of Canada|accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Caribbean]] region
:Conjugal visits are not permitted in the Caribbean.  Marcus Day, adviser to the Association of Caribbean Heads of Corrections and Prison Services has urged the implementation of opposite-sex conjugal visitation for male inmates and the provision of condoms within prisons in an effort to stop the spread of HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Condom Distribution Programs, Conjugal Visits Could Slow Spread of HIV in Caribbean Prisons, Official Says|url=http://kaiserhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/dr00052715/|publisher=Kaiser Health News|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Day attributes the spread of HIV/AIDS in prisons to "homosexual relationships among otherwise heterosexual men and homosexual rape," situations he said are rife in Caribbean prisons:"Allow men to have the women come and visit them in prison and have a private room where they can make love to each other and the desire to have same-sex relationships will be greatly reduced," claimed Day.&lt;ref name="AFP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Condoms, spousal sex urged to prevent HIV in Caribbean jails|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j4HVDd9fiw2FdaF5Vg8iS3rUapJw|publisher=AFP|accessdate=2008-12-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231185330/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j4HVDd9fiw2FdaF5Vg8iS3rUapJw|archivedate=2008-12-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Colombia]]
:On October 11, 2001, the Colombian Supreme Court issued a verdict in favour of the right to same-sex conjugal visits in a case brought by Alba Nelly Montoya, a lesbian in the [[Risaralda Women's Prison]]. This was not the first case regarding same-sex conjugal visitation in the country. Marta Alvarez, another lesbian inmate, had been campaigning since 1994 for the same right, and on October 1, 1999 her case became the first ever sexual orientation-related case presented before the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]]. In her petition, Alvarez had argued that her rights to personal dignity, integrity, and equality were being infringed upon by the denial to allow her conjugal visits in prison, since the Colombian [[National Penitentiary and Prison Institute (Colombia)|National Penitentiary and Prison Institute (&lt;small&gt;INPEC&lt;/small&gt;)]] granted conjugal visitation rights in a discriminatory fashion to heterosexual men and women (the latter restricted to visits from husbands only), and denied this right to same-sex couples.&lt;ref name="IGLHRC-196"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Celebration of Courage: Previous Awardees 2000–2003|url=http://www.iglhrc.org/cgi-bin/iowa/print/196.html|publisher=International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission|accessdate=2011-08-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731110916/http://www.iglhrc.org/cgi-bin/iowa/print/196.html|archivedate=2009-07-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-2039165/Conjugal-visits-for-lesbian-prisoner.html |title=Conjugal visits for lesbian prisoner |publisher=Goliath.ecnext.com |date= |accessdate=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:While the Colombian government admitted its failure to grant conjugal visitation to Alvarez constituted "inhuman and discriminatory" treatment, it continued to deny such visits, arguing reasons of security, discipline, and morality.  Alvarez was also subjected to retaliatory disciplinary measures, including being transferred to a men's prison, which ceased following a domestic and international protest campaign.&lt;ref name="IGLHRC-196" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGLHRC-689"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iglhrc.org/cgi-bin/iowa/article/pressroom/pressrelease/689.html |title=Colombia: Supreme Court in Favor of Conjugal Visits for Lesbian Inmate |first= |last=|work=iglhrc.org |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Costa Rica]]
:In August 2008, the Costa Rican Constitutional Tribunal rejected a man's appeal in a lawsuit against prison authorities who stopped his conjugal visits to his male partner, a current inmate, ruling that gay inmates do not have the right to conjugal visits.  The court recently rejected this ruling and now allows same-sex conjugal visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latindispatch.com/2011/10/13/conjugal-visits-for-gay-couples-legalized-in-costa-rica/|title=Conjugal Visits For Gay Couples Legalized In Costa Rica – Latin America News Dispatch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Israel]]
:Gay prisoners in Israeli Prison System (IPS) are allowed conjugal visits with their partners under the same circumstances as heterosexual prisoners.  This policy was revised in July 2013 under [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel]] chief legal attorney Dan Yakir challenged the lack of conjugal visits for same sex inmates since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zapata|first1=Jean Paul|title=Conjugal visits approved for gay and lesbian prisoners in Israel |url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/conjugal-visits-approved-gay-and-lesbian-prisoners-israel030713|website=Gay Star News|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Mexico]]
:In July 2007 through the efforts of the country's National Human Rights Commission (CDHDF), the Mexico City prison system began allowing same-sex conjugal visits on the basis of a 2003 law which bans discrimination based on sexual orientation. The visitor is not required to be married to the inmate. This policy change applies to all Mexico City Prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stevenson|first1=Mark|title=Mexico City prison system allows first gay conjugal visit|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-07-29-mexico-gay-conjugal-visit_N.htm|website=USA Today|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[United States]]
:In June 2007, the [[California Department of Corrections]] announced it would allow same-sex conjugal visits. The policy was enacted to comply with a 2005 state law requiring state agencies to give the same rights to domestic partners that heterosexual couples receive. The new rules allow for visits only by registered married same sex couples or domestic partners who are not themselves incarcerated.

==Health care==
According to [[Masen Davis]], Executive Director of the [[Transgender Law Center]], LGBT people in prisons often face barriers in seeking basic and necessary [[LGBT issues in medicine|medical treatment]], exacerbated by the fact that prison health care staff are often not aware of or trained on how to address [[LGBT issues in medicine|those needs]].&lt;ref name="TLC"/&gt;  For example, like [[Michelle Kosilek]] did in May 2006, two transgender prisoners filed suit in January 2008 challenging a [[Wisconsin]] law that bars inmates from receiving [[hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|hormones]] or [[sex reassignment surgery]] notwithstanding Principle 9 of [[The Yogyakarta Principles]].&lt;ref name="Gay.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Arrested justice: When LGBT People Land in Jail Part One: A Frightening Odyssey|url=http://www.gay.com/news/roundups/package.do?sernum=1338&amp;page=2|publisher=Patrick Letellier, Gay.com|accessdate=2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of the Yogyakarta Principles is also stressed by "Handbook on prisoners with special needs"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4a0969d42.html|title=Refworld - Handbook on Prisoners with Special Needs|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; published by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]].

However, on August 31, 2001, the [[Canadian Human Rights Tribunal]] concluded that Sections 30 and 31 of the Correctional Service of Canada contained discrimination on the basis of sex and disability in [[Canadian Human Rights Act]].&lt;ref name="Canadian Human Rights Tribunal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chrt-tcdp.gc.ca/aspinc/search/vhtml-eng.asp?doid=264&amp;lg=_e&amp;isruling=0|title=Error 404 / Erreur 404|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Kavanagh v. Canada (Attorney General)|Synthia Kavanagh]], a transwoman sentenced for life in 1989 for 2nd-degree murder, was sent to an institution for males. This institution assignment occurred despite the trial judge's recommendation that Synthia, as a transwoman, serve her sentence in a facility for women. Further, Synthia was denied [[Sex reassignment surgery (male-to-female)|sex reassignment surgery]] and [[Hormone replacement therapy|hormones]]. The institutional policy, at the time, only facilitated cases which addressed conditions in which, reasonably, the plaintiff would seek sexual reassignment after the period of incarceration. Due to Synthia Kavanagh's life sentence, this was not a foreseeable option. "The decision to discontinue hormones in 1990 seems to have been based on the complainant's life sentence which made her, according to Dr. R. Dickey, apparently ineligible for ultimate reassignment. ... the diagnosis of transsexualism has been clearly established in this case" by expert witness testimony, throughout her trial, "She [had] responded well to feminizing effects of cross-gender hormones and has experienced no significant side effects. As established by legal precedent and confirmed by policy in Canadian and British Columbia Corrections Service, the complainant was entitled to continue her hormone treatment".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Petitioning the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, Kavanagh argued that "The Correctional Service of Canada has discriminated and continues to discriminate against me because of my disability and sex (Transsexualism), contrary to Section 5 of the Canadian Human Right Act, by refusing to provide me with necessary medical and surgical treatment." Kavanagh continues to elaborate on her transition prior to imprisonment in this address, stating "since 1981 I have been diagnosed as a transsexual, which means that my gender is female but my sex is male.  For 13 years, I was on estrogen hormonal treatment and lived as a woman, in preparation for my sex reassignment surgery to correct my medical disorder. In May 1990, my hormonal treatment was discontinued." After incarceration in a men's facility Kavanagh "repeatedly asked the CSC to arrange for evaluation for sex reassignment surgery, for the surgery to be performed and my consequent transfer to a women's institution." The discontinuation of hormone treatment and rejection of proposed sex reassignment surgery, paired with the continuation of periods of solitude prompted Kavanagh to respond "I believe that the CSC Policy discriminates against transsexuals, as the policy does not recognize the need for the continuation of medical treatment at the onset of incarceration, nor does the policy acknowledge the psychological need to be imprisoned with other members of one's psychological sex at the time of incarceration."&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Commission Complaint Form W 08861&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals with relatively short prison sentences the requirement of completing the life trial within society does not seem unreasonable. Prison is not generally an appropriate setting for transsexual individuals to make decisions which are irreversible. The implications of refusing access to surgical reassignment for individuals with a life sentence or prolonged incarceration are however clearly more serious. For example, the Canadian Correctional Service in the Pacific Region alone had six transsexual inmates as of September 1994 with sentences of nine years or over and three with life imprisonment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The consequences of discontinued sex-reassignment procedure are especially evident in the cases of those subject to substantial prison sentencing. The Canadian Correctional Service in the Pacific Region alone had six transsexual inmates as of September 1994 with sentences of nine years or over and three with life imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Canadian Human Rights Tribunal" /&gt;

==LGBT youth prisoners==

According to some studies, LGBT youth are particularly at risk for [[arrest]] and [[Detention of suspects|detention]].&lt;ref name="National"/&gt; Jody Marksamer, Shannan Wilber, and Katayoon Majd, writing on behalf of the Equity Project, a collaboration between Legal Services for Children, the [[National Center for Lesbian Rights]], and the National Juvenile Defender Center, say that LGBT youth are overrepresented in the populations of youth who are at risk of arrest and of those who are confined in [[Juvenile hall|juvenile justice facilities]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="National"&gt;{{cite web |title=Letter to the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission |url=http://google.com/search?q=cache:QJVDTyWHwAMJ:www.equityproject.org/pdfs/NPREC_youth_intro.pdf+lgbt+people+in+prison&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=79&amp;gl=ca|publisher=Equity Project|accessdate=2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A brief by the Center for American Progress found that each year approximately 300,000 gay, trans, and gender nonconforming youth are arrested or detained each year, 60% of whom are Black or Hispanic. These queer youth make up 13–15 percent of the juvenile incarceration system, compared to their overall population of 5–7 percent. Similar to how transgender adults are often placed into solitary confinement, allegedly for their own protection, these youth are "protected" in the same way. Often, however, it is because they are seen as sexual predators rather than potential victims. Courts also commonly assign queer youth to sex offender treatment programs even when convicted of a non-sexual crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/report/2012/06/29/11730/the-unfair-criminalization-of-gay-and-transgender-youth/|title=The Unfair Criminalization of Gay and Transgender Youth - Center for American Progress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical and sexual abuse==
According to Amnesty International, globally, LGBT prisoners and those perceived to be LGBT, are at risk of torture, ill-treatment and violence from other inmates as well as prison officials.&lt;ref name="AI"/&gt; Amnesty International cites numerous cases internationally where LGBT inmates are known to have been abused or murdered by prison officials or fellow inmates.

Statistics show that 59% of transgender women in male prisons had been sexually assaulted while incarcerated compared to the 4% of the male-identified population. Transgender women in male prisons also deal with the risk of [[forced prostitution]] by both prison staff and other prisoners. Forced prostitution can occur when a correction officer brings a transgender woman to the cell of a male inmate and locks them in so that the male inmate can rape her. The male inmate will then pay the correction officer in some way and sometimes the correction officer will give the woman a portion of the payment.&lt;ref&gt;Law, Vikki. Resistance behind Bars: The Struggles of Incarcerated Women. Oakland, CA: PM, 2009. Web. 18 Dec. 2014. &lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=N6SjF_Gzq_YC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=transgender+prostitution+that+occurs+in+US+prisons&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rTuNnTiDX4&amp;sig=vbQOBw-FVao3OXsjxkWmQxOYr6w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g9uSVLaKLMOogwTGi4TgCw&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=transgender%20prostitution%20that%20occurs%20in%20US%20prisons&amp;f=false&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[P]risoners fitting any part of the following description are more likely to be targeted: young, small in size, physically weak, gay, first offender, possessing "feminine" characteristics such as long hair or a high voice; being unassertive, unaggressive, [[shyness|shy]], intellectual, not street-smart, or "passive"; or having been convicted of a [[Child sexual abuse|sexual offense against a minor]]. Prisoners with any one of these characteristics typically face an increased risk of sexual abuse, while prisoners with several overlapping characteristics are much more likely than other prisoners to be targeted for abuse."&lt;ref name="HRW4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Mariner, ''[[No Escape: Male Rape in U.S. Prisons]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay and bisexual men are often assumed to be responsible for the preponderance of [[sexual assault]]s perpetrated in prisons as has been reflected in various American [[judicial decision]]s.  For example, in ''Cole v. Flick''&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;758 F. 2d 124 (3d Cir. 1985).  According to trial documents, four expert witnesses, all of them prison wardens, testified to the legitimacy of this concern, stating their belief that "a correlation exists between security problems resulting from prison homosexuality and long hair, and that predatory homosexuals are more likely to attack or become involved in a fight over a long-haired inmate than a short-haired one."&lt;/ref&gt; the court upheld the right of prisons to limit the length of inmates' hair, claiming that allowing them to wear long hair could lead to an increase in attacks by "predatory homosexuals".&lt;ref name="CvF"&gt;{{cite web |title=United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit Cole v. Flick|url=http://www.altlaw.org/v1/cases/541458#fn6|publisher=ALTlaw|accessdate=2008-12-29}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Roland v. Johnson'',&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 11468 (6th Cir. 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; the court described "[[gang]]s of homosexual predators".  And ''Ashann-Ra v. Virginia''&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;112 F. Supp. 2d 559, 563 (W.D. Va. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; contains references to "inmates known to be predatory homosexuals [stalking] other inmates in the showers". According to a study by [[Human Rights Watch]], however, "The myth of the 'homosexual predator' is groundless. Perpetrators of [[Prison rape|rape]] typically view themselves as [[heterosexual]] and, [[Prison sexuality|outside of the prison environment]], prefer to engage in heterosexual activity. Although gay inmates are much more likely than other inmates to be victimized in prison, they are not likely to be perpetrators of sexual abuse."&lt;ref name="HRW4"/&gt; (see also [[situational homosexuality]])

A related problem is that there is a tendency, among both prison officials and prisoners, to view victimization as proof of homosexuality: "The fact of submitting to rape—even violent, forcible rape—redefines [a prisoner] as 'a punk, [[sissy]], [[queer]].'" Officials sometimes take the view all sex involving a gay prisoner is necessarily [[Consent (criminal)|consensual]], meaning that victims known or perceived to be gay may not receive necessary medical treatment, protection, and legal recourse, and perpetrators may go unpunished and remain able to perpetrate abuse on their victims:&lt;ref name="HRW6"&gt;{{cite web |title=No Escape: Male Rape in US Prisons|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2001/prison/report6.html|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I have been sexually assaulted twice since being incarcerated. Both times the staff refused to do anything except to lock me up and make accusations that I'm homosexual.}}

According to Andrea Cavanaugh Kern, a spokesperson for [[Stop Prisoner Rape]], the combination of high rates of sexual assault against gay prisoners and high rates of HIV infection in the prison population is "a life-or-death issue for the LGBT community".&lt;ref name="Gay.com"/&gt;

While much of the data regards male prisoners, according to Amnesty International, "perceived or actual sexual orientation has been found to be one of four categories that make a female prisoner a more likely target for sexual abuse".&lt;ref name="AI"/&gt;

==Segregation==
For their own safety, LGBT people in prison are sometimes placed in [[administrative segregation]] or [[protective custody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edney|first=Richard|title=TO KEEP ME SAFE FROM HARM? TRANSGENDER PRISONERS AND THE EXPERIENCE OF IMPRISONMENT|journal=Deakin Law Review|url=http://www.deakin.edu.au/buslaw/law/dlr/docs/vol9-iss2/vol9-2-4.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6KKpuXkhn?url=http://www.deakin.edu.au/buslaw/law/dlr/docs/vol9-iss2/vol9-2-4.pdf|archivedate=2013-10-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although homosexuality is "generally regarded as a factor supporting an inmate's claim to protective custody", [[homophobia]] among prison officials and a misperception among many guards that "when a gay inmate has sex with another man it is somehow by definition consensual" mean that access to such custody is not always easy or available.&lt;ref name="HRW8"&gt;{{cite web |title=No Escape: Male Rape in US Prisons|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2001/prison/report8.html|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem is that protective and disciplinary custody are often the same, which means that prisoners in "protective housing" are often held with the most [[Prison riot|violent inmates]] in highly restrictive and isolated settings—sometimes in more or less permanent [[lockdown]] or [[solitary confinement]]—that prevent them from participating in [[Drug addiction|drug treatment]], [[Prison education|education]] and job-training programs, from having contact with other prisoners or outside visitors, or from enjoying privileges such as the right to watch television, listen to the radio, or even to leave their [[Prison cell|cells]].&lt;ref name="TLC"/&gt; The degree of safety that protective custody provides depends on the facilities. Protective custody can provide a secure environment that is free from violence by other prisoners or it can isolate prisoners, and position them with a higher risk of violence by a correctional officer. Although the protective custody can offer some level of protection, the harmful physical and psychological impacts of isolation show that it is an unwanted alternative to assignment in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Rivera, Sylvia. Sylvia Rivera Law Project. Rep. N.p., n.d. Web. 18 Dec. 2014. &lt;http://srlp.org/resources/warinhere042007/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, institutions may have special areas (known by such nicknames as the "queerentine", "gay tank", "[[Queen (gay slang)|queen]] tank", or "softie tank") for housing vulnerable inmates such as LGBT people, elderly or disabled prisoners, or informers. In San Francisco, for example, transgender inmates are automatically segregated from other prisoners.  Nevertheless, according to Eileen Hirst, San Francisco Sheriff's Chief of Staff, being gay is not in itself enough to justify a request for protective housing: inmates requesting such housing must demonstrate that they are vulnerable.&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{cite web|title=Arrested justice: When LGBT People Land in Jail Part Four: The Myth of 'Protective Custody'|url=http://transgenderlawcenter.org/new/index.php/updates/press-releases/meeting-to-highlight-issues-faced-by-lgbt-people-in-california-prisons/108|publisher=Patrick Letellier, Gay.com|accessdate=2008-12-28}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For financial or other reasons segregated housing is not always available. For instance at [[Rikers Island]], [[New York City]]'s largest jail, the segregated unit for LGBT prisoners, known as "gay housing", was closed in December 2005 citing a need to improve security.&lt;ref name="Myth"/&gt; The unit had opened in the 1970s due to concerns about abuse of LGBT prisoners in [[Detention of suspects|pretrial detention]].  The [[New York City Department of Corrections]]' widely criticised plan was to restructure the classification of prisoners and create a new protective custody system which would include 23-hour-per-day lockdown (identical to that mandated for disciplinary reasons) or moving vulnerable inmates to other facilities.&lt;ref name="Rikers"&gt;{{cite news |title=Closure of Gay Housing at Rikers Draws Complaints|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/dec/30/nation/na-rikers30|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2008-12-28 | date=2005-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas formerly all that was required was a declaration of homosexuality or the appearance of being transgender, inmates wanting protective custody would now be required to request it in a special [[Hearing (law)|hearing]].&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;{{cite news |title=City Prepares to Close Rikers Housing for Gays |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE1D81330F933A05751C1A9639C8B63|publisher=[[Paul von Zielbauer|Paul Von Zielbauer]], New York Times|accessdate=2008-12-28 | date=2005-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solitary confinement==

Solitary confinement has become the prison system's preferred method to protect transgender inmates from other prisoners in cases involving sexual assault, harassment and physical violence. Advocates for transgender prisoners argue that this method only increases the harassment they receive from officers and various other staff members as reported by Injustice at Every Turn.&lt;ref name="thetaskforce.org"&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf|title=Injustice at Every Turn: A Report of the National Transgender Discrimination Survey|year=2011|author1=Grant, Jaime M.|author2=Lisa A. Mottet|author3=Justin Tanis|author4=Jack Harrison|author5=Jody L. Herman|author6=Mara Keisling|location=Washington|publisher=National Center for Transgender Equality and National Gay and Lesbian Task Force}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the report, 44% of transgender male respondents and 40% of transgender women respondents who were imprisoned reported being harassed by officers and/or other staff members of the prison system.&lt;ref name="thetaskforce.org"/&gt;  While in solitary confinement, transgender individuals are less likely to receive medical care.

In cases where the incarcerated are assigned to prisons based on [[Sex and gender distinction|sex, rather than their gender-identity]], complete segregation is often seen as the only viable way for ensuring safety. In the case of Synthia Kavanagh, she was assigned to a male institution despite explicit recommendations from the [[trial judge]]. As a result, Kavanagh was "placed in segregation over extended periods of her incarceration for the purpose of protection from self-harm or abuse by others. Segregation for prolonged periods is not only inhuman but [is additionally] unconducive to any prospect of stabilization or rehabilitation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Out of the respondents in the same report 12% of transgender individuals surveyed reported being denied routine non-transition related healthcare and 17% reported being denied hormone treatment. The number was disproportionately higher when transgender people of color reported lack of transition health care and hormone treatment with American Indians reporting 36% denial and Black and/or African American reporting a 30% denial rate.&lt;ref name="thetaskforce.org" /&gt; The use of solitary confinement also lessens transgender inmate's access to programs and work assignments where they may be able to lessen their sentences, enter rehabilitation programs, or earn money to buy basic products such as soap and also lesses their chances to obtain parole or conditional release.&lt;ref name="lambdalegal.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambdalegal.org/sites/default/files/ltr_sjsccrhr_20120619_solitary-confinement.pdf|title=Testimony of Organizations Supporting LGBT Equality|date=June 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solitary confinement has also shown to affect the mental health of transgender prisoners.  With the report of filed by Injustice at Every Turn,&lt;ref name="thetaskforce.org"/&gt; 41% of respondents reported attempted suicide. With transgender people of color, 56% of American Indian and 54% of multiracial individuals reported attempted suicide. The report also links the over-use of solitary confinement as a factor in the high rate of suicide attempts by transgender people of color within the prison system.&lt;ref name="lambdalegal.org"/&gt;

==Support for LGBT people in prison==

As a result of the rise of awareness of LGBT persons in prisons, many organizations have developed specifically to support LGBT people in the prison system. These organizations address the various needs surrounding specific issues that LGBT persons in the prison system face. Some organizations also support family members of LGBTQ inmates.

[[Black and Pink]] is an American organization that is composed of "LGBTQ prisoners and 'free world' [[straight ally|allies]]" who focus on [[prison abolishment movement]] and support LGBTQ prison inmates and their families.&lt;ref name="Website of Black and Pink"&gt;{{cite web|title=Black and Pink|url=http://www.blackandpink.org|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization offers various services such as court accompaniment, a pen pal program, workshops and training, and support for LGBTQ persons who are experiencing sexual violence, harassment, or lack of health care.&lt;ref name="Website of Black and Pink" /&gt;

The '''Lampung''' people, also commonly referred to as '''Ulun Lampung''', are an [[ethnic group]] indigenous to [[Lampung]] province and parts of [[South Sumatra]] province of the southern and central region that occupy areas such as Martapura, Muaradua at upstream of [[Komering River]], Kayu Agung, Tanjung Raja at downstream of [[Komering River]], Merpas on the southern side of [[Bengkulu]] province, as well as Cikoneng in the southwest coast of [[Banten]] province, [[Indonesia]]. They speak the [[Lampung language]], a Lampungic language estimated to have 1.5 million speakers.

==Origins==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Portret van een voornaam hoofd met dansmeisjes uit Lampong in vol ornaat TMnr 10001861.jpg|thumb|left|A group of dancing girls with distinguished headdress from [[Lampung]] in full regalia, 1929.]]
The origins of the Lampung people is closely tied to the name of Lampung itself. In the 7th century the Chinese had already mentioned about a place in the south (''Nampang'') where it is said to be the place of the ''Tolang Pohwang'' kingdom. ''To'' means "people" and ''Lang Pohwang'' means "Lampung". Hence its name ''Tolang Pohwang'' which means "Lampung people" or "envoy from Lampung" that came from [[China]] until the 7th century. There are strong evidence that [[Lampung]] was part of the [[Srivijaya]] kingdom with its capital in [[Jambi]] and did conquered parts of [[South East Asia]] region including [[Lampung]] until the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bukri Fachruddin|title=Pengendalian Sosial Tradisional Daerah Lampung|year=1992|publisher=Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, Direktorat Jenderal Kebudayaan, Direktorat Sejarah dan Nilai Tradisional, Bagian Proyek Penelitian, Pengkajian dan Pembinaan Nilai-Nilai Budaya Daerah Lampung}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 5th AD ''Tai-Ping-Huan-Yu-Chi'' chronicles, names of the ''Nan-hai'' (Southern ocean) states were recorded and among them are two states which were mentioned in sequence, ''To-lang'' and ''Po-hwang''. The ''To-lang'' state was mentioned only once, but the ''Po-hwang'' state was mentioned many times as this state did sent envoys to [[China]] in the year of 442, 449, 451, 459, 464 and 466.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nia Kurnia Sholihat Irfan|title=Kerajaan Sriwijaya: Pusat Pemerintahan Dan Perkembangannya|year=1983|publisher=Girimukti Pasaka|page=37|asin=B0000D7JUN}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Prof. Gabriel Ferrand (1918), it is likely that the name ''To-lang'' and ''Po-hwang'' are actually one same name and is located in Tulangbawang, [[Lampung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Titik Pudjiastuti|title=Aksara Dan Naskah Kuno Lampung Dalam Pandangan Masyarakat Lampung Kini|year=1997|publisher=Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan RI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said that there is also a Tulangbawang kingdom, although the idea simply came from the unification of the two names in the Chinese chronicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Prof. Purbatjaraka|title=Riwajat Indonesia I|year=1952|publisher=Jajasan Pembangunan|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earlier generation of the Lampung people came from Sekala Brak, at the foot of Mount Pesagi, [[West Lampung Regency]]. Its people were inhabited by the ''Buay Tumil'' people and they were ruled by a woman named Ratu Sekerummong. The religion of the people is [[animism]] mixed with the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] Bairawa [[Hinduism]] influences. After the 15th century, the Buay Tumil people later had influences from four Muslim men who came from [[Pagaruyung Kingdom]], [[West Sumatra]] that went there. They are Umpu Bejalan Diway, Umpu Nyerupa, Umpu Pernong and Umpu Belunguh. The fourth men is the forerunner of Paksi Pak Sekala Brak as it is mentioned in an ancient manuscript, Kuntara Raja Niti. However, in the Kuntara Raja Niti manuscript, their names are Inder Gajah, Pak Lang, Sikin, Belunguh, and Indarwati. Based on the Kuntara Raja Niti, the hypothesis of the descendants of the Lampung people are as the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=|title=Seminar Sejarah Nasional IV: Sub Tema Studi Bandingan|year=1985|publisher=Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, Direktorat Sejarah dan Nilai Tardisional|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in its customary sense the Lampung people developed and became two people group, namely the Saibatin Lampungs and the Pepadun Lampungs. The customs of the Saibatin people are well known for its aristocracy, while the customs of the Pepadun people which emerged later followed the practices of the Abung people and had democracy values developed in opposed to the aristocracy values held by the Saibatin people.

==Philosophical life==
The philosophical life of the Lampung people are contained in the Kuntara Raja Niti manuscript,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ahmad Fauzie Nurdin|title=Budaya muakhi dan pembangunan daerah menuju masyarakat bermartabat|year=2009|publisher=Gama Media|isbn=979-1104-26-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are:-
* ''Piil-Pusanggiri'': It is an embarrassment to do despised job in accordance to religion and self-esteem.
* ''Juluk-Adok'': A personality that is fitting to the customary title that one bears.
* ''Nemui-Nyimah'': To keep in touch with one another by visiting and by gladly receiving guests.
* ''Nengah-Nyampur'': Active in communal fellowship and not being individualistic.
* ''Sakai-Sambaian'': Give mutual assistance with one another in the community.

The above-mentioned philosophical values are denoted by the symbol of five decorative flowers of the Lampung seal.

The characteristic traits of the Lampung people are expressed in the ''adi-adi'' (poems):-
&lt;br /&gt;''Tandani ulun Lampung, wat piil-pusanggiri''
&lt;br /&gt;''Mulia heno sehitung, wat liom ghega dighi''
&lt;br /&gt;''Juluk-adok gham pegung, nemui-nyimah muaghi''
&lt;br /&gt;''Nengah-nyampugh mak ngungkung, sakai-Sambaian gawi.''

==Language==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Portret van een groep mannen en kinderen uit Negeribatin in de Lampongse districten TMnr 60043398.jpg|thumb|right|A group of men and children from Negeri Batin village, Blambangan Umpu district, [[Way Kanan Regency]], [[Lampung]], 1901.]]
The [[Lampung language]] is the language used by the Lampung people in [[Lampung]], southern [[Palembang]] and the west coast of [[Banten]]. This language is classified in its own branch from the western [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] (Lampungic languages) and is still closely related to [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] and distantly related to [[Javanese language|Javanese]]. The [[Lampung language]] has two major dialects which is Api and Nyo dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ni Nyoman Wetty|title=Struktur Bahasa Lampung Dialek Abung|year=1992|publisher=Pusat Pembinaan dan Pengembangan Bahasa, Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan|isbn=97-945-9201-3|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Api dialect are spoken by the people of Sekala Brak, Melinting Maringgai, Darah Putih Rajabasa, Balau Telukbetung, Semaka Kota Agung, Pesisir Krui, Ranau, Komering and Daya (those that practices the Saibatin Lampungs customs), and including Way Kanan, Sungkai and Pubian (those that practices Pepadun Lampungs customs). The Nyo dialect are used by the people of Abung and Tulangbawang (those that practices Pepadun Lampungs customs). According to Dr. Van Royen, there are two classification of the [[Lampung language]] which are the Belalau dialect or Api dialect and the Abung dialect or Nyo dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Proyek Inventarisasi dan Dokumentasi Kebudayaan Daerah|title=Adat Istiadat Daerah Lampung|year=1986|publisher=Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, Kantor Wilayah Propinsi Lampung, Proyek Inventarisasi dan Dokumentasi Kebudayaan Daerah Lampung|pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Komering language|Komering]], spoken by the [[Komering people|Komering]] is also part of Lampungic languages but mostly considered an independent language of its own, separate from proper Lampung as the Komering people have a different culture from Lampung people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Frawley|title=International Encyclopedia of Linguistics: 4-Volume Set|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=01-951-3977-1|page=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lampung script==
Lampung script that is referred to as ''Had Lampung'' is a form of writing that is related to the [[Pallawa script]] from [[South India]].&lt;ref name="AOLOIC"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Stephen A. Wurm, Peter Mühlhäusler &amp; Darrell T. Tryon|title=Atlas of Languages of Intercultural Communication in the Pacific, Asia, and the Americas: Vol I: Maps. Vol II: Texts|year=1996|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=31-108-1972-4|page=681}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just like a form of syllable-based phonetic writing similar to the vowels as used in Arabic letters by using the sign of [[fathah]] at the top row and the sign of [[kasrah]] at the bottom row but does not use the sign of [[dammah]] on the front row unless the mark is used at the back, with each mark has its own name.

This shows that Lampung script is influenced by two elements, namely the [[Pallawa script]] and [[Arabic script]]. The Lampung script also has a form of kinship with [[Rencong script]], [[Rejang script]],&lt;ref name="AOLOIC"/&gt; Bengkulu script and [[Lontara alphabet|Bugis script]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Jane Garry &amp; Carl R. Galvez Rubino|title=Facts about the World's Languages: An Encyclopedia of the World's Major Languages, Past and Present|year=2001|publisher=H.W. Wilson|isbn=08-242-0970-2|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Had Lampung consists of main letters, sub-letters, double letters and consonant clusters, as well as also symbols, numbers and punctuation. Lampung script is also referred to as [[Kaganga|KaGaNga]], a term for a script that is written and read in a direction from left to right with 20 main letters.

Lampung script has developed or changed. Previous ancient Lampung script is much more complex. Refinement were made until it has become to what it is now known. The Lampung script or alphabet that is being taught in the school today is the result of that refinement.

The '''Lost Trillion Case''', also known as the '''Missing Trillion Case''', ({{lang-tr|Kayıp Trilyon Davası}}) was an [[embezzlement]] scandal in Turkey involving the use of forged documents by the [[Welfare Party]] ({{lang-tr|Refah Partisi}}, RP) executives to prevent the return of Treasury grants in amount of around one trillion lira, i.e. one million {{Turkish lira}} in today's currency (around {{Euro}} 477,000) following the ban of the party in 1998. Party leader and former prime minister [[Necmettin Erbakan]] as well as 68 party officials received prison sentences after a court trial, although the former's was commuted to house arrest.

==Background==
The Welfare Party, an [[Islamism|Islamist]] political party in Turkey founded and led by Necmettin Erbakan (1926–2011), had received grants from the Treasury in accordance with the applicable laws. In June 1998, the [[54th government of Turkey|coalition cabinet of Erbakan]] was forced to resign following the submission of a [[1997 military memorandum|memorandum by the military]] on February 28, 1998.&lt;ref name="pd"/&gt; The same year, the [[Constitutional Court of Turkey|Constitutional Court]] banned the Welfare Party on the grounds that it tried to overthrow [[Secularism in Turkey|Turkey's secular system]] and to promote [[Islamic fundamentalism]].&lt;ref name="tz1"/&gt; Erbakan was suspended from active politics for a term of five years.&lt;ref name="bbc1"/&gt; The bans were upheld by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] as well.&lt;ref name="ti1"/&gt;

The Treasury requested the return of the financial aid worth around one trillion lira, i.e. one million {{Turkish lira}} in today's currency (around {{Euro}} 477,000) from the then-closed RP. The party executives declared that the funds were spent on party activities. However, an investigation found that the amount was converted into 10&amp;nbsp;million [[Deutsche Mark]] and was then deposited in [[Yapı ve Kredi Bankası]]. Early in 1997, the amount was withdrawn from the bank.&lt;ref name="bn1"/&gt;

==Trial and conviction==
In the beginning of 1999, Erbakan and 78 party members were prosecuted by the First High Penal Court of [[Sincan, Ankara|Sincan]] in [[Ankara]]. They were accused of embezzling trillions by forging 139 official party documents with the intention to hide the grants, which the Treasury ordered back. The case became known as the "Lost Trillion Case" or the "Missing Trillion Case" ({{lang-tr| Kayıp Trilyon Davası}}).&lt;ref name="hdn1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hdn3"/&gt; Among the defendants were prominent politicians like [[Şevket Kazan]], former [[Ministry of Justice (Turkey)|Minister of Justice]], and [[Ahmet Tekdal]], co-founder and first leader of the party.&lt;ref name="bn1"/&gt;

In March 2002, Erbakan received a prison sentence of two years and four months. The court convicted 68 party officials to sentences of up to one year and two months in prison. The court's decision was approved by the [[Court of Cassation (Turkey)|Supreme Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref name="bn1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kna1"/&gt;

[[Abdullah Gül]], who was the vice chairman of the party responsible for foreign affairs, joined another Islamist party, the [[Virtue Party]] ({{lang-tr|Fazilet Partisi}}, FP), in 1998. He was re-elected into the parliament in [[Turkish general election, 1999|1999]]. His [[parliamentary immunity]] at the time of the trial spared him from prosecution.&lt;ref name="bn1"/&gt;

Erbakan's imprisonment was adjourned four times as he submitted medical reports about his poor health condition. The last adjournment took place in July 2005 for six month time. After the end of the term, he applied for the re-opening of his case, which was rejected in first and second instance. In April 2006, the Supreme Court of Appeals annulled  the court's decision from March 2002. In accordance with the in-the-meantime-amended law, the court reduced Erbakan's sentence to eleven months and two days in house arrest.&lt;ref name="r1"/&gt;

Erbakan began to serve his sentence at his summer residence in [[Altınoluk]] of [[Edremit, Balıkesir]] in house arrest on May 2008. Upon his application of pardoning, Abdullah Gül, at that time the [[President of Turkey]], pardoned Erbakan on permanent health grounds in August 2008.&lt;ref name="bn1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ntv1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h2"/&gt;

==Former Turkish President's testimony==
Abdullah Gül had been exempted from the trial due to his parliamentary immunity. Later, as he became state president in August 2007, he could not be brought before the court as, according to the Constitution, presidents may not be tried for any allegations other than treason. The re-opened case in 2008 referred to him as a "suspect". He expressed his willingness to appear before the court. However, the case remained for him frozen until the end of his presidency term in August 2014.&lt;ref name="tz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bn1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hdn3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hdn2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cna1"/&gt;

The criminal court in Ankara decreed that Gül testifies for charges of falsifying official documents as the crime was committed before his presidency. Judicial experts are of the opinion that he would have been acquiıtted even he was tried because his responsibilities in the party were not of financial nature. As an example, RP officials Şevket Kazan, [[Recai Kutan]], [[Oğuzhan Asiltürk]], the deputy chairman and even the general accountant were all acquitted in the past.&lt;ref name="hdn2"/&gt;

Gül announced his readiness to testify in the "Lost Trillion Case" right after he handed over his post as state president in late August. In November 2014, he testified before the court with the motive of "having justice operate flawlessly and seamlessly" and "in order not to leave any doubt on any issue".&lt;ref name="hdn3"/&gt;

On December 6, 2014, the Head Public Prosecutor of Ankara announced its conclusion in the case as [[nolle prosequi]] ("unwilling to pursue") due to missing evidence required for a public lawsuit.&lt;ref name="s1"/&gt;

The '''Party for Neighbourly Love, Freedom, and Diversity''' or '''The Charity, Freedom and Diversity Party''' (''Partij voor Naastenliefde, Vrijheid en Diversiteit'', PNVD) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[political party]] with no representation in parliament,&lt;ref name=trouw/&gt; and only three known members.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;  It was commonly known as ''"pedopartij"'' ("pedo party") in the media, due to its advocacy for legalization of [[child pornography]] and the lowering of the [[age of consent]] to age 12.&lt;ref name=trouw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nu.nl/algemeen/1589549/pedopartij-presenteert-nieuw-programma.html |title=Pedopartij presenteert nieuw programma &amp;#124; nu.nl/algemeen &amp;#124; Het laatste nieuws het eerst op |publisher=Nu.nl |date=2010-03-16 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trouw.nl/nieuws/article1659507.ece |title=Pedopartij richt zich voortaan tegen religie - Nieuws - TROUW |language=nl |publisher=Trouw.nl |date=2007-07-31 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; PNVD was founded on 31 May 2006 by three self-described pedophiles.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=expat19/&gt;  Its motto is "[[wikt:sapere aude|sapere aude]]" ("Have courage to use your own reason").&lt;ref name="platform"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pnvd.nl/prog_mei_2006.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719220314/http://www.pnvd.nl/prog_mei_2006.html |archivedate=2006-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  PNVD has not participated in any election.

==Platform==
According to their official statement, the PNVD's platform aimed to maximize diversity and liberty.&lt;ref name="platform" /&gt; They proposed allowing individuals, from the age of 12, to vote, have [[human sexual behavior|sex]], gamble, choose their place of residence, and use [[drug harmfulness|soft drug]]s. Hard drugs would be legal at 16, as that would be the new [[age of majority]]. They also intended to eliminate [[marriage]] in the law, permit [[public nudity]] anywhere in the country, make railway travel free, and institute a comprehensive [[animal rights]] platform.&lt;ref name="platform" /&gt; They were opposed to [[opposition to immigration|immigration]] and religious elementary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Dutch pedophiles form political party |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/13068060/ns/world_news-weird_news/t/dutch-pedophiles-form-political-party/ |work= |location=New York City/Redmond, Washington |publisher=[[NBCNews.com]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=May 31, 2006 |access-date=September 19, 2017 |quote=The party will also follow an anti-immigration policy and oppose religious elementary schools.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexuality===
The PNVD sought to have the legal [[age of consent]] lowered to 12, and, in the long run, completely eliminated (except in dependent or intrafamilial relationships). They reason that only "coerced" or "dangerous" sexual activity should be punished. They also aimed to equalize the legal age where one can perform in pornography with the legal age of consent. Prostitution would be legal at the age of 16.&lt;ref name="platform" /&gt; The PNVD wanted to legalise private use of [[child pornography]] (calling outlawing thereof "censorship" in the platform) and allow non-violent pornography to be screened on daytime television. Their platform also included legalization of humans engaging in [[zoophilia|sex with animals]].&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

Treasurer Van den Berg claimed that, "Rearing is also about introducing children to sex".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dutch paedophiles set up political party |url=http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?subchannel_id=19&amp;story_id=30373 |publisher=[[Expatica]] |date=30 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their controversial viewpoints on children and sexuality, they were often called the "paedo-party" by the people and in the media.

Also, the party's platform called for separate imprisonment facilities for [[sex offender]]s, arguing that the country would otherwise have indirect torture laws.&lt;ref name="platform" /&gt;

===Animal rights===
The PNVD ultimately aimed to establish a universal [[treaty]] guaranteeing all animals basic rights.

In addition, the party planned to heavily restrict [[animal testing]] and completely prohibit the consumption of meat and fish: they viewed the killing of animals, no matter what purpose it serves, as [[murder]]. Industries currently depending on the sale of animal meat would receive provisional financial support from the government. Hunting and fishing for sport would also be banned.&lt;ref name="platform" /&gt; The party also supported laws criminalizing the "sexual maltreatment" of animals.&lt;ref name="platform" /&gt;

==Controversy==
Multiple positions taken by the PNVD were controversial, especially those concerning children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Tonny |last1=van der Mee |first2= Raymond |last2=Vermeulen |url= http://www.ad.nl/binnenland/article372818.ece |title=Afschuw over pedopartij |publisher= [[Algemeen Dagblad|AD]] |date= 31 May 2006  |accessdate= 31 May 2006|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a May 2006 opinion poll, 82% of respondents wanted the Dutch government to stop the party from competing in the elections.&lt;ref name="GNN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://il_duce.gnn.tv/blogs/15719/Pedophiles_to_launch_political_party |title=Pedophiles to launch political party |publisher= Guerrilla News Network / Reuters |date=30 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-pedophile foundation "Soelaas"&lt;ref name=expat19&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=19&amp;story_id=31593&amp;name=Court+refuses+to+ban+Dutch+paedophile+party |title=Court refuses to ban Dutch paedophile party |publisher= Expatica |date= 17 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; petitioned the courts to ban the party, but the judges ruled in the PNVD's

The party's ties to [[paedophile activism]] have also drawn much attention: Marthijn Uittenbogaard (who also starred in the controversial documentary ''[[Are All Men Pedophiles?]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.areallmenpedophiles.com/cast/ |title=CAST |publisher=Areallmenpedophiles.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; was earlier the treasurer of [[Vereniging MARTIJN]],&lt;ref name="AD"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Tonny |last1=van der Mee |first2=Dafna |last2=Holtzer |url=http://www.ad.nl/binnenland/article369625.ece |title=Pedofielen de politiek in |newspaper= [[Algemeen Dagblad|AD]] |date= 30 May 2006 |accessdate= 31 May 2006 |language= Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; an organization which advocates romantic and sexual relationships between adults and children, and all of its founders have identified as pedophiles.

The [[Roman Republic]] conquered the [[Iberian Peninsula]] during the 2nd and 1st centuries B.C. from the extensive maritime empire of [[Carthage]] during the series of [[Punic Wars]].  As a result of [[Campaign history of the Roman military#Conquest of the Iberian peninsula (218-19 BC)|Roman colonization]], the majority of local languages stem from the [[Vulgar Latin]]. Due to the large historical extent from the 16th century of the [[Portuguese Empire]] and the subsequent [[colonization]] of territories in [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and the [[Americas]], as well as historical and recent [[emigration]], Portuguese communities can be found in many diverse regions around the globe, and a large [[Portuguese diaspora]] exists.

Portuguese people began and led the [[Age of Exploration]] which started in 1415 with the [[conquest of Ceuta]] and culminated in an empire with territories that are now part of over 50 countries. The [[Portuguese Empire]] lasted nearly 600 years, seeing its end when [[Macau]] was returned to [[People's Republic of China|China]] in 1999. The discovery of several lands unknown to the [[Europe]]ans in the [[Americas]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Oceania]] (southwest [[Pacific Ocean]]), helped pave the way for modern [[globalization]] and domination of Western civilization.

===Historical origins===
{{Further|Genetic history of Europe}}
[[File:R1b.jpg|thumb]]
The Portuguese are a Southwestern European population, with origins predominantly from Southern and [[Western Europe]]. The earliest [[Human|modern humans]] inhabiting Portugal are believed to have been [[Paleolithic]] peoples that may have arrived in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] as early as 35,000 to 40,000 years ago. Current interpretation of [[Y-chromosome]] and [[mtDNA]] data suggests that modern-day Portuguese trace a significant amount of these lineages to the [[paleolithic]] peoples who began settling the European continent between the end of the [[Wisconsin glaciation|last glaciation]] around 45,000 years ago.
[[File:Y-Haplogroup R1 distribution.png|thumb|left|Distribution of [[R1a]] (purple) and '''[[R1b]]''' (red). See also [[:File:Haplogroups europe.png|this map]] for distribution in Europe.]]
Northern Iberia is believed to have been a major Ice-age refuge from which Paleolithic humans later colonized Europe. Migrations from what is now Northern Iberia during the Paleolithic and [[Mesolithic]], links modern [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberians]] to the populations of much of [[Western Europe]] and particularly the [[British Isles]] and [[Atlantic Europe]]. Recent books published by geneticists [[Bryan Sykes]], [[Stephen Oppenheimer]] and [[Spencer Wells]] have emphasized the large Paleolithic and Mesolithic Iberian influence in the modern day [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]] and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] gene-pool as well as parts of the [[English people|English]]. Indeed, Y-chromosome [[haplogroup]] [[R1b]] (of Paleolithic origin) is the most common haplogroup in practically all of the Iberian peninsula and western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Pericić M, Lauc LB, Klarić IM, etal |title=High-resolution phylogenetic analysis of southeastern Europe traces major episodes of paternal gene flow among Slavic populations |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=22 |issue=10 |pages=1964–75 |date=October 2005 |pmid=15944443 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msi185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the R1b haplogroup there are modal [[haplotypes]]. One of the best-characterized of these haplotypes is the [[Atlantic Modal Haplotype]] (AMH). This haplotype reaches the highest frequencies in the Iberian Peninsula and in the British Isles. In Portugal it reckons generally 65% in the South summing 87% northwards, and in some regions 96%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Čeština: Distribuce genu R1b napříč Evropou |url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:R1b-DNA-Distribution.jpg |title=File:R1b-DNA-Distribution - Wikimedia Commons |publisher=Commons.wikimedia.org |date=2012-06-15 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Neolithic]] colonization of Europe from [[Western Asia]] and the [[Middle East]] beginning around 10,000 years ago reached Iberia, as most of the rest of the continent although, according to the [[demic diffusion]] model, its impact was most in the southern and eastern regions of the European continent.&lt;ref name=pmid15044595&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Dupanloup I, Bertorelle G, Chikhi L, Barbujani G |title=Estimating the impact of prehistoric admixture on the genome of Europeans |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=21 |issue=7 |pages=1361–72 |date=July 2004 |pmid=15044595 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msh135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 3rd millennium BC as well as in the [[Bronze Age]], the first wave of migrations into Iberia of speakers of [[Indo-European languages]] occurred. These were later (7th and 5th Centuries BC) followed by others that can be identified as [[Celt]]s.


Urban cultures eventually developed in southeastern Iberia, such as [[Tartessos]], influenced by the [[Phoenicia]]n colonization of coastal [[Mediterranean]] Iberia, which later shifted to [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] colonization. There is very little or no evidence of settlements in [[Portugal]] by either [[Greeks]] or [[Phoenicians]] despite some statements to the contrary.
[[File:Ethnographic Iberia 200 BCE.PNG|left|thumb|Ethnographic and Linguistic Map of the Iberian Peninsula at about 200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkeotavira.com/Mapas/Iberia/Populi.htm |title=Ethnographic Map of Pre-Roman Iberia (circa 200 b |publisher=Arkeotavira.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

These two processes defined Iberia's, and Portugal's, cultural landscape—Continental in the northwest and Mediterranean towards the southeast, as historian José Mattoso describes it.&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:José Mattoso|Mattoso, José]] (dir.), História de Portugal. Primeiro Volume: Antes de Portugal, Lisboa, Círculo de Leitores, 1992. (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]).{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Given the origins from Paleolithic and Neolithic settlers as well as [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] migrations, one can say that the Portuguese [[ethnic origin]] is mainly a mixture of pre-Roman, pre-Indo-Europeans (such as, in other parts of Iberia, the [[Iberians]], [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanians]]), and pre-[[Celtics]] or para-[[Celts]] such as the [[Lusitanians]] of [[Lusitania]], and [[Celts|Celtic]] peoples such as [[Callaici|Calaicians or Gallaeci]] of [[Gallaecia]], the [[Celtici]] and the [[Cynetes]] of the [[Alentejo]] and the [[Algarve]].

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] were also an important influence on [[Culture of Portugal|Portuguese culture]]; the [[Portuguese language]] derives mostly from [[Latin]].

Other minor influences included the [[Phoenicians]]/[[Carthaginians]] (small semi-permanent commercial coastal establishments in the south before 200 BC), the [[Vandals]] ([[Silingi]] and [[Hasdingi]]) and the Sarmatian [[Alans]] (both migrated to [[North Africa]], while some were partially integrated by the Visigoths and [[Suebi]]), and the [[Visigoths]] and [[Suebi]] (including the [[Buri (Germanic tribe)|Buri]], permanently established in the early 5th century) who also settled in what is today [[Geography of Portugal|Portuguese territory]] and the [[Maghrebis]] like [[Moors]], [[Berbers]] and the Islamic [[Arabs]] who ruled the territory that is today [[Geography of Portugal|Portugal]] from 711 A.D. until the reconquest of the [[Algarve]], ending the Portuguese [[Reconquista]] in 1249. In the 9th and 10th centuries small [[Viking]]&lt;ref&gt;http://culture-routes.net/sites/default/files/Fiche%20A4-1994-Viking.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; settlements were also established in the North coastal regions of Douro and Minho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terrasdeportugal.wikidot.com/historia-da-povoa-de-varzim |title=História da Póvoa de Varzim |publisher=Memória Portuguesa |language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cm-pvarzim.pt/areas-de-atividade/turismo/conhecer/as-nossa-raizes-1/historia/etnografia/etnografia |title=Etnografia |publisher=Póvoa de Varzim |language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portuguese have also maintained a certain degree of ethnic and cultural specific characteristics-ratio with the [[Basques]], since ancient times. The results of the present [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] study in Portuguese populations show that they have features in common with [[Basques]] and some [[Spaniards]] from [[Madrid]]: a high frequency of the HLA-[[haplotypes]] A29-B44-DR7 (ancient western Europeans) and A1-B8-DR3 are found as common characteristics.  Many Portuguese, and [[Basques]] do not show the Mediterranean A33-B14-DR1 [[haplotype]], confirming a lower admixture with [[Mediterranean people|Mediterraneans]].
The Portuguese have a characteristic unique among world populations: a high frequency of HLA-A25-B18-DR15 and A26-B38-DR13, which may reflect a still detectable founder effect coming from ancient Portuguese, i.e., [[Oestriminis]] and [[Cynetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=   Relatedness among Basques, Portuguese, Spaniards, and Algerians studied by HLA allelic frequencies and haplotypes|date=2014-05-14 |pmid=9382919 | volume=47|issue=1 |journal=Immunogenetics|pages=37–43 | last1 = Arnaiz-Villena | first1 = A | last2 = Martínez-Laso | first2 = J | last3 = Gómez-Casado | first3 = E | last4 = Díaz-Campos | first4 = N | last5 = Santos | first5 = P | last6 = Martinho | first6 = A | last7 = Breda-Coimbra | first7 = H | doi=10.1007/s002510050324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lusitanians===
{{Distinguish|Lusatia}}
The '''[[Lusitanians]]''' (or '''Lusitānus/Lusitani''' in [[Latin]]) were an [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European speaking people]] (likely [[Celtic languages|Celtic]]) living in the Western [[Iberian Peninsula]] long before it became the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Roman provinces|province]] of [[Lusitania]] (modern [[Portugal]], [[Extremadura]] and a small part of [[Salamanca]]). They spoke the [[Lusitanian language]], of which only a few short written fragments survive. Most Portuguese consider the Lusitanians as their ancestors. Although the northern regions (Minho, Douro, Tras-os-Montes) identify more with the [[Gallaecians]].

It has been hypothesized that the [[Lusitanians]] may have originated in the [[Alps]] and settled in the region in the 6th century BC. Some modern scholars consider them to be indigenous and initially dominated by the [[Celt]]s, before gaining full independence from them. The archaeologist [[Scarlat Lambrino]] proposed that they were originally a tribal  [[Celts|Celtic]] group, related to the [[Lusones]].

The first area settled by the [[Lusitanians]] was probably the Douro valley and the region of [[Beira Alta (region)|Beira Alta]]; then they moved south, and expanded on both sides of the [[Tagus river]], before being conquered by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].

The original Roman province of Lusitania was extended north of the areas occupied by the Lusitanians to include the territories of [[Asturias]] and [[Gallaecia]] but these were soon ceded to the jurisdiction of the ''Provincia Tarraconensis'' in the north, while the south remained the ''Provincia Lusitania et [[Vettones]]''. After this, Lusitania's northern border was along the Douro river, while its eastern border passed through ''Salmantica'' and ''Caesarobriga'' to the ''Anas'' ([[Guadiana]]) river.

===Pre-Roman groups===
[[File:Mapa de Portugal tribos principais.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Map showing the main pre-Roman tribes in Portugal and their main migrations. [[Turduli]] movement in red, [[Celtici]] in brown and Lusitanian in a blue colour. Most tribes neighbouring the Lusitanians were dependent on them. Names are in Latin.]]

The Lusitanians were a single large [[tribe]] that lived between the rivers [[Douro River|Douro]] and [[Tagus]]. As the Lusitanians fought fiercely against the Romans for independence, the name Lusitania was adopted by the [[Gallaeci]], tribes living north of the Douro, and other closely surrounding tribes, eventually spreading as a label to all the nearby peoples fighting Roman rule in the west of Iberia. It was for this reason that the Romans came to name their original province in the area, that initially covered the entire western side of the Iberian peninsula, Lusitania.

Tribes, often known by their Latin names, living in the area of modern Portugal, prior to Roman rule:
* [[Bardili (Turduli)]] '' – living in the Setúbal peninsula;''
* [[Bracari]] ''– living between the rivers [[Tâmega (river)|Tâmega]] and [[Cávado River|Cávado]], in the area of the modern city of [[Braga]];''
* [[Callaici]] ''– living along and north of the [[Douro]];''
* [[Celtici]] '' – Celts living in [[Alentejo]];''
* [[Coelerni]] '' – living in the mountains between the rivers [[Tua River|Tua]] and Sabor;''
* [[Cynetes|Cynetes or Conii]] '' – living in the [[Algarve]] and the south of [[Alentejo]];''
* [[Equaesi]] '' – living in the most mountainous region of modern [[Portugal]];''
* [[Grovii]] '' – a mysterious tribe living in the Minho valley;''
* [[Interamici]] '' – living in [[Trás-os-Montes (region)|Trás-os-Montes]] and in the border areas with [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Province of León|León]] (in modern [[Spain]]);''
* [[Leuni]] '' – living between the rivers Lima and [[Minho (river)|Minho]];''
* [[Luanqui]] '' – living between the rivers Tâmega and Tua;''
* [[Lusitani]] '' – being the most numerous and dominant of the whole region comprising most of [[Portugal]];''
* [[Limici]] '' – living in the swamps of the river [[Limia (river)|Lima]], on the border between Portugal and Galicia);''
* [[Narbasi]] '' – living in the north of modern Portugal (interior) and nearby area of southern Galicia;''
* [[Nemetati]] '' – living north of the Douro Valley in the area of Mondim;''
* [[Paesuri]] '' – a dependent tribe of the Lusitanians, living between the rivers Douro and Vouga;''
* [[Quaquerni]] ''– living in the mountains at the mouths of rivers Cávado and Tâmega;''
* [[Seurbi]] '' – living between the rivers [[Cávado River|Cávado]] and Lima (or even reaching the river Minho);''
* [[Tamagani]] '' – from the area of [[Chaves, Portugal|Chaves]], near the river Tâmega;''
* [[Tapoli]] '' – another dependent tribe of the Lusitanians, living north of the river Tagus, on the border between modern Portugal and Spain;''
* [[Turduli]] '' – in the east of [[Alentejo]] (Guadiana Valley);''
* [[Turduli Veteres]] '' – the "ancient Turduli" living south of the estuary of the river Douro;''
* [[Turdulorum Oppida]] '' – Turduli living in the Portuguese region of [[Estremadura Province (historical)|Estremadura]];''
* [[Turodi]] '' – living in [[Trás-os-Montes (region)|Trás-os-Montes]] and bordering areas of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]];''
* [[Vettones]] '' – living in the eastern border areas of Portugal, and in Spanish provinces of [[Ávila (province)|Ávila]] and [[Salamanca (province)|Salamanca]], as well as parts of [[Zamora (province)|Zamora]], [[Toledo (province)|Toledo]] and [[Cáceres (province)|Cáceres]];''
* [[Zoelae]] '' – living in the mountains of Serra da Nogueira, Sanabria and Culebra, up to the mountains of [[Mogadouro]] in northern Portugal and adjacent areas of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].''

==Romanization==
{{Campaignbox Roman conquest of Hispania}}
{{Main|Lusitanian War}}

Since 193 B.C., the Lusitanians had been fighting [[Rome]] and its expansion into the peninsula following the defeat and occupation of [[Carthage]] in [[North Africa]]. They defended themselves bravely for years, causing the [[Romans|Roman]] invaders serious defeats. In 150 B.C., they were defeated by Praetor [[Servius Sulpicius Galba (consul 144 BC)|Servius Galba]]: springing a clever trap, he killed 9,000 Lusitanians and later sold 20,000 more as slaves further northeast in the newly conquered Roman provinces in [[Gaul]] (modern [[France]]) by [[Julius Caesar]].  Three years later (147 B.C.), [[Viriathus]] became the leader of the Lusitanians and severely damaged the Roman rule in Lusitania and beyond. In 139 B.C. Viriathus was betrayed and killed in his sleep by his companions (who had been sent as emissaries to the Romans), [[Audax, Ditalcus and Minurus]], bribed by [[Marcus Popillius Laenas]]. However, when Audax, Ditalcus and Minurus returned to receive their reward by the Romans, the Consul [[Quintus Servilius Caepio|Servilius Caepio]] ordered their execution, declaring, "Rome does not pay traitors".

After Viriathus' rule, the Lusitanians became largely [[romanized]], adopting Roman culture and the language of [[Latin]]. The Lusitanian cities, in a manner similar to those of the rest of the Roman-Iberian peninsula, eventually gained the status of "Citizens of Rome". The [[Portuguese language]] itself is a local later evolution of the Roman language, [[Latin]] after the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th and 6th centuries.

==General traits==
[[File:Senhora_de_Boa_Ventura_-_Madeira.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Portuguese lady from [[Madeira]] island]]
Modern Portuguese are an Iberian ethnic group and share a similar makeup to that of the fellow [[Southern Europe]]ans.&lt;ref&gt;Marques, S. L. et al. (2015). Portuguese mitochondrial DNA genetic diversity - An update and a phylogenetic revision. Forensic Science International: Genetics&lt;/ref&gt; The Western Coast of Iberia, which composes the land of Galicia and Portugal, was a converging point of migratory movements in the past and during the [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese Discoveries]]. As a result, the Portuguese were introduced to new cultures and ethnicities. With the end of the [[Assimilado|Indigenous Statute]] in the early 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rtp.pt/noticias/politica/adriano-moreira-uma-entrevista-aos-90-anos_v585212|title=Adriano Moreira, uma entrevista aos 90 anos|last=RTP|first=RTP, Rádio e Televisão de Portugal - Fátima Campos Ferreira -|access-date=2017-12-26|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; indigenous people of Portuguese colonies were granted Portuguese citizenship as the end of [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonialism]] was marked with the hand over of [[Macau]] to the [[China|People's Republic of China]] in 1999, after 500 years of Portuguese administration. Regarding this, it is comprehensible that any relationship between citizenship and anthropometrical features can be questioned, nevertheless, it is possible to draw the general anthropometrical features of the majority of the Portuguese population. Dark to medium [[brown hair]] and [[Brown eye|brown]] and [[Hazel eyes|hazel]] eyes are predominant. However, light brown and [[blond]] hair and [[Blue eye|blue]] and [[Green-eyed|green]] [[human eye|eye]]s are also found frequently. [[chestnut hair|Chestnut]] and [[auburn hair|auburn-colored hair]] types occur generally.  Legitimate black hair—not espresso brown—can be found, but it is not very common.  Light, true [[red hair]] (meaning red shades that are non-auburn) is seen on occasion.

Pigmentation field studies by Tamagnini (1916, 1936), Correa (1919) and others recorded national average fair hair ("blondism") frequencies of between 15 and 21%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5Xdf39yFAbk/Um6KB-JxtZI/AAAAAAAAHjA/oyrN-paNFVg/s1600/Conclus%C3%A3o+Cabelo+Claro+(Louro).png|format=PNG|title=Image : Cabelo Louro|website=4.bp.blogspot.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; True red hair (ginger) amounts to approximately 3%. However, there are higher percentages of individuals with auburn and dark red-brown shades. Dark and light sandy hair is common.  Light eyes run between 19% and 30% &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-49caxBIEaaQ/UuEM0y8IBpI/AAAAAAAALUA/7KtvocUHf54/s470/Distribui%25C3%25A7%25C3%25A3o%2520da%2520Cores%2520do%2520Cabelo%2520e%2520Olhos.png|format=PNG|title=Image : Tabela III|website=4.bp.blogspot.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to recently published pigmentation maps of Europe (see P. Frost, 2006). A recent study by Candille et al. (2012) comparing pigmentation levels between the Portuguese and three other ethnically indigenous European national groups—the Irish, the Polish and the Italians—concluded that, in parts of the body not exposed to the sun, the Irish were in the lightest end of the spectrum, followed by the Portuguese, Poles and Italians, with the latter being darkest. In terms of hair color, the Portuguese averaged lighter hair than Italians and darker than Irish and Poles.  The Portuguese exhibited significantly lower frequencies in lighter eye shades in comparison to the Irish and Polish, and marginally less, compared to  Italians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0048294 Genome-Wide Association Studies of Quantitatively Measured Skin, Hair, and Eye Pigmentation in Four European Populations], Sophie I.

There are around 10 million native Portuguese in Portugal, out of a total population of 10.34 million (estimate).

===Native minority languages in Portugal===
A small minority of about 15,000 speak the [[Mirandese language]], (part of the Asturian-Leonese linguistic group which includes the [[Asturian Language|Asturian]] and [[Leonese Language|Leonese]] minority languages of Northwestern Spain &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org |title=Unesco.org |publisher=Unesco.org |date=2014-08-09 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azkuefundazioa.eus/es/casa-del-euskera/lenguas-minorizadas-listado/asturianoleones|title=Asturiano/Leonés|website=Azkuefundazioa.eus|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proel.org/index.php?pagina=mundo/indoeuro/italico/romance/iberorromance/mirandesa|title=Promotora Española de Lingüística|website=Proel.org|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/cultura/2010/03/20/enclave-linguistico-astur-leones-sobrevive-raia-portuguesa/0003_8367479.htm|title=Un enclave lingüístico astur-leonés sobrevive en la "raia" portuguesa|date=20 March 2010|website=Lavozdegalicia.es|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in the [[municipality|municipalities]] of [[Miranda do Douro]], [[Vimioso]] and [[Mogadouro]]. All of the speakers are bilingual with [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

An even smaller minority of no more than 2,000 people speak [[Barranquenho]], a dialect of Portuguese heavily influenced by [[Extremaduran language|Extremaduran]], spoken in the Portuguese town of [[Barrancos]] (in the border between [[Extremadura]] and [[Andalusia]], in [[Spain]], and Portugal).

===Ethnic minorities in Portugal===
Some people from the former [[Portuguese Empire|colonies]], namely [[Brazil]], [[Portuguese Africa]], [[Macau]] (China), [[Portuguese India]] and [[East Timor]], have been migrating to Portugal since the 1900s.

More recently, a great number of [[Slavic people|Slavs]], especially [[Ukrainians]] (now the third biggest [[ethnic minority]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sef.pt/portal/v10/PT/aspx/estatisticas/index.aspx?id_linha=4224&amp;menu_position=4142#0 |title=Portal SEF |publisher=Sef.pt |date= |accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Russians]], as well as [[Moldovans]] and [[Romanians]], keep migrating to Portugal. There is also a [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] minority, which are mainly of [[Macanese people|Macau]] [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] origin.

In addition, there is a small minority of [[Romani people#Portugal|Gypsies]] (''Ciganos'') about 40,000 in number,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.errc.org/cikk.php?cikk=398 |title=European Roma Rights Centre |publisher=Errc.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muslims]] about 34,000 in number&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://imigrantes.no.sapo.pt/page2AfricanMuls.html |title=A Imigração em Portugal, Comunidades lusófonas, Países do Leste da Europa |publisher=Imigrantes.no.sapo.pt |date= |accessdate=24 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926180641/http://imigrantes.no.sapo.pt/page2AfricanMuls.html |archivedate=26 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an even smaller minority of [[History of the Jews in Portugal|Jews]] of about 5,000 people (the majority are [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] such as the [[Belmonte Jews]], while some are [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]]).

===Portuguese diaspora===

====Overview====
In the whole world there are easily more than one hundred million people with recognizable Portuguese ancestors, due to the [[Portuguese Empire|colonial expansion]] and worldwide [[immigration]] of Portuguese from the 16th century onwards to [[India]], the [[Americas]], [[Macau]] (see [[Macanese people]]), [[East-Timor]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Africa]]. Between 1886 and 1966, Portugal lost to emigration more than any West European country except [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/portugal/48.htm |title=Portugal - Emigration |publisher=Countrystudies.us |date= |accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the middle of the 19th century to the late 1950s, nearly two million Portuguese left Europe to live mainly in [[Brazil]] and with significant numbers to the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Jorge Malheiros |url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=77 |title=Portugal Seeks Balance of Emigration, Immigration |publisher=Migrationinformation.org |date=1 December 2002|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 40 million [[Demography of Brazil|Brazilians]] have relatively recent Portuguese background, due to massive immigration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} About 1.2 million Brazilian citizens are native Portuguese.&lt;ref name="memorialdoimigrante.sp.gov.br"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memorialdoimigrante.sp.gov.br/historico/e4.htm|title=Estatísticas gerais: imigrantes e descendentes|trans-title=General statistics: immigrants and descendants|language=es|publisher=State Government of São Paulo|accessdate=6 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425123106/http://www.memorialdoimigrante.sp.gov.br/historico/e4.htm|archivedate=25 April 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant verified Portuguese minorities exist in several countries (see table).&lt;ref&gt;Direcção Geral dos Assuntos Consulares e Comunidades Portuguesas do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros (1999), Dados Estatísticos sobre as Comunidades Portuguesas, IC/CP - DGACCP/DAX/DID - Maio 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 some 4,000,000 Portuguese were living abroad, mainly in France, Germany, Brazil, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Canada, Venezuela, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Europe/Portugal-MIGRATION.html|title=Migration - Portugal - average, annual|website=Nationsencyclopedia.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Portuguese Sephardi Jews====
Portuguese Sephardi Jews (mostly descendants) are also in [[Israel]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[United States]], [[France]], [[Venezuela]], [[Brazil]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/povoamento/judeus/cristaos_novos.html|title=Cristãos-Novos no Brasil Colônia|trans-title=New-Christians in colonial Brazil|language=pt|publisher=[[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]|accessdate=7 July 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010306082855/http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/povoamento/judeus/cristaos_novos.html|archivedate=6 March 2001|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Turkey]]. In Brazil many of the colonists were also originally Sephardi Jews, who, converted, were known as New Christians.

====The Americas outside of Brazil and the Pacific====
[[File:Portugueses.jpg|thumb|Sign and frame about Portuguese immigration inside one [[Toronto subway and RT|subway station]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada.]]

[[Canada]], particularly [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]] and [[British Columbia]], has developed a significant Portuguese community since 1940 (see [[Portuguese Canadians]]). [[Argentina]] (See [[Portuguese Argentine]] and [[Cape Verdean Argentine]]) and [[Uruguay]] (see [[Portuguese Uruguayan]]) had Portuguese immigration in the early 20th century. So has [[Chile]] where an estimated 50,000 descendants live, as the country's maritime industries attracted a small number of Portuguese as well. {{citation needed|date=October 2010}} Portuguese fishermen, farmers and laborers dispersed across the [[Caribbean]], especially [[Bermuda]] (3.75%&lt;ref name=JoshuaBermuda&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/countries.php?rog3=BD|title=Bermuda :: Joshua Project|author=Joshua Project|website=Joshuaproject.net|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 10%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarnavigator.net/geography/bermuda.htm |title=Bermuda |publisher=Solarnavigator.net |date= |accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the population), [[Guyana]] (4.3% of the population in 1891),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guyana.org/special/portuguese.html |title=Portuguese emigration from Madeira to British Guiana |publisher=Guyana.org |date=7 May 2000|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trinidad]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pidduck|first=Angela|url=http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Communities/communities_Portuguese.html|title=Small TT / Portuguese Community Continues to Celebrate Heritage|publisher=nalis.gov.tt|date=14 June 1999|accessdate=7 September 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020225025938/http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Communities/communities_Portuguese.html|archivedate=25 February 2002|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]], and the island of [[Barbados]] where there is high influence from the Portuguese community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~portwestind/diaspora/waves_of_migration.htm |title=The Portuguese of the West Indies |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date=2001-07-31 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Africa====
In the early twentieth century the Portuguese government encouraged white emigration to [[Overseas Province of Angola|Angola]] and [[Overseas Province of Mozambique|Mozambique]], and by the 1970s, there were up to 1 million Portuguese settlers living in their overseas African provinces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/portugal/48.htm Portugal - Emigration], Eric Solsten, ed. Portugal: A Country Study.

====Other former colonies====
As a result, there are Portuguese influenced people with their own culture and Portuguese based dialects in parts of the world other than former Portuguese colonies, most notably in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] (see [[Kristang people]]), [[Indonesia]], [[Barbados]], [[Jamaica]], [[Aruba]], [[Curaçao]], [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Guyana]] (see [[Portuguese immigrants in Guyana]]), [[Equatorial Guinea]] and [[Sri Lanka]] (see [[Burgher people]] and [[Portuguese Burghers]]).

====In Europe outside of Portugal====
[[Portuguese Luxembourger|Portuguese]] constitute 13% of the population of [[Luxembourg]]. In 2006 there were estimates to be over half a million people of Portuguese origin in the [[United Kingdom]] (see [[Portuguese in the United Kingdom]])—this is considerably larger than the around 88,000 Portuguese-born people alone residing in the country in 2009 (estimation; however this figure does not include British-born people of Portuguese descent). In areas such as [[Thetford]] and the crown dependencies of [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]], the Portuguese form the largest ethnic minority groups at 30% of the population, 7% and 3% respectively. The British capital [[London]] is home to the largest number of Portuguese people in the UK, with the majority being found in the boroughs of [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea|Kensington and Chelsea]], [[Lambeth]] and [[City of Westminster|Westminster]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswiretoday.com/news/10592/|title=UK-Portuguese Newspaper Launched in Thetford Norfolk|publisher=NewswireToday|accessdate=17 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese diaspora communities still are very attached to their language, their culture and their national dishes and particularly the [[bacalhau]].&lt;ref&gt;SILVA, A.

[[File:Passaporte português de 1927.jpg|thumb|Passport of an immigrant from the [[Braga District]] to Brazil]]
In [[Colonial Brazil|colonial times]], over 700,000 Portuguese settled in Brazil, and most of them went there during the gold rush of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/povoamento/|title=Brasil: 500 anos de povoamento|trans-title=Brazil: 500 years of settlement|language=pt|publisher=IBGE|accessdate=29 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923103736/http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/povoamento/|archivedate=23 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Brazil received more European settlers during its colonial era than any other country in the Americas. Between 1500 and 1760, about 700,000 Europeans immigrated to Brazil, compared to 530,000 European immigrants in the United States.&lt;ref name="Pinto Venâncio"&gt;{{cite web|first=Renato|last=Pinto Venâncio|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/povoamento/portugueses.html|title=Presença portuguesa: de colonizadores a imigrantes|trans-title=Portuguese presence: from settlers to immigrants|language=pt|publisher=IBGE|date=2000|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021124205218/http://www1.ibge.gov.br/brasil500/portugueses.html|archivedate=24 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[History of Immigration to the United States#Population in 1790]]&lt;/ref&gt;
They managed to be the only significant European population to populate the country during [[colonization]], even though there were French and Dutch invasions. The Portuguese migration was strongly marked by the predominance of [[men]] (colonial reports from the 16th and 17th centuries almost always report the absence or rarity of Portuguese [[women]]). This lack of women worried the Jesuits, who asked the Portuguese King to send any kind of Portuguese women to Brazil, even the socially undesirable (e.g. prostitutes or women with mental maladies such as Down Syndrome) if necessary.&lt;ref name="ensinarhistoria"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ensinarhistoriajoelza.com.br/desmundo-o-brasil-do-sec-xvi/|title=Desmundo de Alain Fresnot, o Brasil no século XVI|publisher=ensinarhistoria|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.companhiadasletras.com.br/detalhe.php?codigo=10637|title=Desmundo by Ana Miranda (1996)|publisher=companhiadasletras.com.br|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Crown responded by sending groups of Iberian orphan maidens to marry both cohorts of marriageable men, the nobles and the peasants. Some of which were even primarily studying to be nuns.&lt;ref name="ensinarhistoria"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.companhiadasletras.com.br/detalhe.php?codigo=10637|title=Desmundo by Ana Miranda|publisher=companhiadasletras.com.br|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Crown also shipped over many [[Órfãs d'El-Rei]] of what was considered "good birth" to [[colonial Brazil]] to marry Portuguese settlers of high rank. ''Órfãs d'El-Rei'' (modern Portuguese ''órfãs do rei'') literally translates to "Orphans of the King", and they were Portuguese female orphans in nubile age.{{sfnp|Telfer|1932|p=184}} There were noble and non-noble maidens and they were daughters of military compatriots who died in battle for the king or noblemen who died overseas and whose upbringing was paid by the Crown.{{sfnp|Telfer|1932|p=184}} Bahia's port in the East received one of the first groups of orphans in 1551.{{sfnp|Bethell|1984|p=47}} The multiplication of [[Lineal descendant|descendant]]s of Portuguese settlers also happened to a large degree through [[miscegenation]] with [[Black people|black]] and [[amerindian]] women. In fact, in colonial Brazil the Portuguese men competed for the women, because among the [[Afro-Brazilians|African slaves]] the female component was also a small minority.&lt;ref name=Ribeiro&gt;Ribeiro, Darcy. O Povo Brasileiro, Companhia de Bolso, fourth reprint, 2008 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; This explains why the Portuguese men left more descendants in Brazil than the Amerindian or African men did. The Indian and African women were "dominated" by the Portuguese men, preventing men of color to find partners with whom they could have children. Added to this, White people had a much better [[quality of life]] and therefore a lower [[mortality rate]] than the black and indigenous population. Then, even though the Portuguese migration during colonial Brazil was smaller (3.2 million Indians estimated at the beginning of colonization and 3.6 million Africans brought since then, compared to the descendants of the over 700,000 Portuguese immigrants) the "white" population (whose ancestry was predominantly Portuguese) was as large as the "non white" population in the early 19th century, just before independence from Portugal.&lt;ref name=Ribeiro /&gt;
After [[Independence of Brazil|independence from Portugal]] in 1822, around 1.7 million Portuguese immigrants settled in Brazil.&lt;ref name=Ribeiro /&gt;
Portuguese immigration into Brazil in the 19th and 20th centuries was marked by its concentration in the states of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]. The immigrants opted mostly for [[urban center]]s. Portuguese women appeared with some regularity among immigrants, with percentage variation in different decades and regions of the country. However, even among the more recent influx of Portuguese immigrants at the turn of the 20th century, there were 319 men to each 100 women among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abep.nepo.unicamp.br/docs/rev_inf/vol6_n2_1989/vol6_n2_1989_2artigo_17_37.pdf |title=A Integração social e económica dos emigrantes portugueses no Brasil |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=25 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230163157/http://www.abep.nepo.unicamp.br/docs/rev_inf/vol6_n2_1989/vol6_n2_1989_2artigo_17_37.pdf |archivedate=30 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese were different from other immigrants in Brazil, like the Germans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ich.unito.com.br/materia/resource/download/41917|title=Retrato Molecular- Genética|website=Ich.unito.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Italians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=ncc7WLAXlmQC |page=99 }} |title=Do outro lado do Atlântico: um século de imigração italiana no Brasil |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; who brought many women along with them (even though the proportion of men was higher in any immigrant community). Despite the small female proportion, Portuguese men married mainly Portuguese women. Female immigrants rarely married Brazilian men. In this context, the Portuguese had a rate of [[endogamy]] which was higher than any other European immigrant community, and behind only the Japanese among all immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://analisesocial.ics.ul.pt/documentos/1223290545Z8cUY2rh7Lu99TE5.pdf |title=A integração social e económica dos imigrantes portugueses no Brasil nos finais do século xix e no século xx|website=Analisesocial.ics.ul.pt |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with Portuguese heritage, many Portuguese-Brazilians identify themselves as being simply Brazilians, since Portuguese culture was a dominant cultural influence in the formation of Brazil (like many [[British Americans]] in the [[United States]], who will never describe themselves as of British extraction, but only as "Americans").

In 1872, there were 3.7 million [[White people|Whites]] in Brazil (the vast majority of them of Portuguese ancestry), 4.1 million [[mixed-race]] people (mostly of Portuguese-[[Afro-Brazilians|African]]-[[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian]] ancestry) and 1.9 million [[Black people|Blacks]]. These numbers give the percentage of 80% of people with total or partial Portuguese ancestry in Brazil in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reis|first=João José|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/povoamento/tabelas/populacao_cor.htm|title=Evolução da população brasileira segundo a cor|trans-title=Evolution of the Brazilian population according to colour|language=pt|publisher=[[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]|location=Rio de Janeiro|date=2000|accessdate=21 November 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010305200619/http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/povoamento/tabelas/populacao_cor.htm|archivedate=5 March 2001|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a new large wave of immigrants from Portugal arrived. From 1881 to 1991, over 1.5 million Portuguese immigrated to Brazil. In 1906, for example, there were 133,393 Portuguese-born people living in [[Rio de Janeiro]], comprising 16% of the city's population. Rio is, still today, considered the largest "Portuguese city" outside of Portugal itself, with 1% Portuguese-born people.&lt;ref name="Pinto Venâncio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://observatorio.ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/artigos/da020420033.htm Carvalho, R., ''Pelos mesmos direitos do imigrante'', 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312112155/http://observatorio.ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/artigos/da020420033.htm |date=12 March 2008 }}, [http://www.observatoriodaimprensa.com.br/ Observatório da Imprensa] from the [[State University of Campinas]] (Brazil).&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic studies also confirm the strong Portuguese genetic influence in Brazilians. According to a study, at least half of the Brazilian population's [[Y Chromosome]] (male inheritance) comes from Portugal. [[Afro-Brazilians|Black Brazilians]] have an average of 48% non-African genes, most of them may come from Portuguese ancestors. On the other hand, 33% Amerindian and 28% African contribution to the total mtDNA (female inheritance) of white Brazilians was found&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Parra FC, Amado RC, Lambertucci JR, Rocha J, Antunes CM, Pena SD |title=Color and genomic ancestry in Brazilians |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=177–82 |date=January 2003 |pmid=12509516 |pmc=140919 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0126614100 |bibcode=2002PNAS..100..177P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PLoS ONE"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Genomic Ancestry of Individuals from Different Geographical Regions of Brazil Is More Uniform Than Expected |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=e17063 |date=2011-02-16 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0017063|pmid=21359226 |pmc=3040205 |last1 = Pena|first1 = Sérgio D.

An [[Autosome|autosomal]] study from 2013, with nearly 1300 samples from all of the Brazilian regions, found a predominant degree of European ancestry (mostly Portuguese, due to the dominant Portuguese influx among European colonization and immigration to Brazil) combined with African and Native American contributions, in varying degrees. 'Following an increasing North to South gradient, European ancestry was the most prevalent in all urban populations (with values from 51% to 74%). The populations in the North consisted of a significant proportion of Native American ancestry that was about two times higher than the African contribution. Conversely, in the Northeast, Center-West and Southeast, African ancestry was the second most prevalent. At an intrapopulation level, all urban
populations were highly admixed, and most of the variation in ancestry proportions was observed between individuals within each population rather than among population'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Revisiting the Genetic Ancestry of Brazilians Using Autosomal AIM-Indels|journal = PLOS ONE|volume = 8|issue = 9|pages = e75145|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0075145|pmid = 24073242|pmc = 3779230|year = 2013|last1 = Saloum De Neves Manta|first1 = Fernanda|last2 = Pereira|first2 = Rui|last3 = Vianna|first3 = Romulo|last4 = Rodolfo Beuttenmüller De Araújo|first4 = Alfredo|last5 = Leite Góes Gitaí|first5 = Daniel|last6 = Aparecida Da Silva|first6 = Dayse|last7 = De Vargas Wolfgramm|first7 = Eldamária|last8 = Da Mota Pontes|first8 = Isabel|last9 = Ivan Aguiar|first9 = José|last10 = Ozório Moraes|first10 = Milton|last11 = Fagundes De Carvalho|first11 = Elizeu|last12 = Gusmão|first12 = Leonor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was estimated that around 25 million or more Brazilians can acquire Portuguese citizenship, due to the last [[Portuguese nationality law]] that grants citizenship to grandchildren of Portuguese nationals.&lt;ref name="noticiaslusofonas.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=NOVAimagem.co.pt / Portugal em LInha |url=http://www.noticiaslusofonas.com/view.php?load=arcview&amp;article=13313&amp;catogory=Brasil |title=Cinco milhões de netos de emigrantes podem tornar-se portugueses |publisher=Noticiaslusofonas.com |date=17 February 2006|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
[[File:R1b.jpg|thumb]]
According to an early genetic study, the Portuguese are a relatively distinct population according to HLA data, as they have a high frequency of the HLA-A25-B18-DR15 and A26-B38-DR13 genes. The later is a unique Portuguese marker - the Portuguese have neither a significant contribution to their genetic pool from paleo-North Africans (A30-B18) nor Mediterraneans (A33-B14). As such, they may have remained in relative genetic isolation compared to the rest of the Iberian populations. In Europe, the A25-B18-DR15 gene is only found in Portugal, and is also observed in white North Americans and in Brazilians (very likely of Portuguese ancestry).&lt;ref name="portgenes"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arnaiz-Villena A, Martínez-Laso J, Gómez-Casado E, Díaz-Campos N, Santos P, Martinho A, Breda-Coimbra H | title = Relatedness among Basques, Portuguese, Spaniards, and Algerians studied by HLA allelic frequencies and haplotypes | journal = Immunogenetics | volume = 47 | issue = 7 | pages = 37–43 | year = 1997 | pmid = 1782829 | doi = 10.1002/cyto.990120702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pan-European (most probably [[Celts|Celtic]]) haplotype [[HLA A1-B8-DR3-DQ2|A1-B8-DR3]] and the western-European haplotype A29-B44-DR7 are shared by Portuguese, [[Basques]] and [[Spaniards]]. The later is also common in [[Irish people|Irish]], southern [[English people|English]], and western [[French people|French]] populations.&lt;ref name="portgenes"/&gt;

The Portuguese cluster with the Basques, and these with the Spaniards and the [[Algerians]], as data suggest that there is a common Iberian and paleo-North African origin according to some studies, showing a pre-neolithic Saharan northwards migration and admixture with ancient Iberians.  The A2-B7-DR15 gene is common to those, the [[Cornish people|Cornish]], [[Austrians]] and [[Germans]], showing a much more ancient link between [[North Africans]] and western and central [[Europeans]].&lt;ref name="portgenes"/&gt;

R1b-5 gene cluster is a male re-expansion 15,000-13,000 years ago from Northwestern [[Iberia]] heading towards [[Ireland]], [[Wales]] and Northern [[Scotland]].  The Rory gene cluster (R1b-14) is one of the largest re-expansions also head towards Ireland and Scotland, however featuring particularly in Irish men with Gaelic names.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Oppenheimer, Stephen | title = The Origins of the British: The New Prehistory of Britain | publisher = Constable &amp; Robinson ltd | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Potato Germans''' (''Kartoffeltyskere'') is a name referring to a group of German families who settled in the [[heathland]]s of central [[Jutland]] in [[Denmark]] during the mid-1700s.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/Landbohistorie/kartoffeltyskere |title= kartoffeltyskere

|publisher =henrikfrank.dk|accessdate= May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The German immigrants moved to  central Jutland when King [[Frederick V of Denmark]] promised 20 years of [[Tax exemption|tax freedom]], soil, livestock, money, and freedom from military service, for anyone who would cultivate the Jutlandic heaths. The settlers were mostly from [[Hesse]] and [[Rhineland-Palatinate|the Palatinate]] in modern-day [[Germany]]. Men, women, and children included, 965 individuals spread across 265 families first arrived between 1759-63.
After the heath and heather was burnt,  the area became better suited for the cultivation of potatoes.
&lt;ref name=Gullestrup&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NiS8ZXfNQ4MC&amp;pg=PA125 | title=Cultural Analysis: Towards Cross Cultural Understan | publisher=Copenhagen Business School Press | author=Gullestrup, Hans | year=2006 | location=Copenhagen, Denmark | isbn=978-8763001816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority settled in  Alheden in the southernmost part of [[Fjends Municipality|Fjends]]  and the northernmost part of [[Lysgård]] in central [[Jutland]]. This comprises the site of the cities of [[Frederiks]], [[Grønhøj]], [[Havredal]], and [[Karup]].  
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =  http://runeberg.org/salmonsen/2/1/0541.html   |title= Alheden |publisher =   Salmonsens Konversationsleksikon , 2. udgave, bind I (1915)  
|accessdate= May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surnames==
The situation was difficult for the families. Many of settlers were craftsmen with little knowledge of farming.  Most of the settlers subsequently left, many moving back to Germany. However, a total of 59 families stayed on the Alheden for more than a year. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://thyrashm.blogspot.com/2009/08/frederiks-church-mid-jutland.html |title= Frederiks kirke, Lysgård herred , Viborg amt.|publisher = Church and Manor in Denmark|date=August 7, 2009|accessdate= May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Potato German settlers introduced a number of new surnames to Denmark. Though still rare in the country as a whole, many people living near the Alheden still carry these surnames. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =   http://www.kartoffeltysker.dk/  |title= Kartoffeltyskerne på Alheden|publisher = Udarbejdet af ThiseWeb.dk|date=23 April 2018|accessdate= May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rerum Novarum Centre''', [[Taipei]], increased operations in 1971 but had roots going back to [[Jesuit]] social services in [[Taiwan]] since the 1950s. The Centre tries to meet the major social and legal needs of native and foreign workers in the greater Taipei area, while also responding to emergencies and to the needs of the aboriginal peoples of Northern Taiwan. 

== History ==

=== Social Service Centre ===
Since the 1950s the [[Society of Jesus]] in Taiwan has pastored parishes among the [[Atayal people|Atayal]] tribe in north-central Taiwan and Jesuits in the cities have advocated for the rights of workers and of the disabled.{{cn|date=December 2018}}

In the 1960s, the American Jesuit E. Dowd founded in [[Hsinchu]] a vocational school and dormitory for young workers. This work has evolved into the Catholic Social Service Centre in Hsinchu.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jesuitsocialcenter-tokyo.com/eng/?page_id=4425|title=TAIWAN: JESUITS FACING SOCIAL ISSUES {{!}} JESUIT SOCIAL CENTER TOKYO|website=www.jesuitsocialcenter-tokyo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rerum Novarum Centre ===
In 1971 Jesuits responded to the increasing influx of workers into Taipei by opening a centre that gathered information on problems facing workers, that trained union leaders, and that monitored the government's labour policies. The centre was named after ''[[Rerum Novarum]]'' ("Of New Things"), the 1891 [[encyclical]] of Pope [[Leo XIII]] which was the first in a series of social encyclicals in the [[Catholic church]].

By the 1980s Rerum Novarum Centre was offering legal advice along with health and safety services for workers and was publishing books on worker issues. These issues grew to include advocacy for workers' rights, anti-nuclear power, and the environment, which also drew staff and volunteers to join street protests.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seewa.com.tw/rerum_novarum/|title=新事社會服務中心|website=www.seewa.com.tw|language=zh-hant|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s the Center's work had grown in assisting foreign workers and in tending to occupational injuries. Then after the [[Jiji, Nantou|Jiji]] earthquake in 1999 services were increased on behalf of the aboriginal communities of [[Nantou County|Nantou]] and Hsinchu counties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Rerum Novarum Centre along with the Social Service Centre in Hsinchu comprise the main social justice works of the [[China|Chinese]] Province of the Society of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sjapc.net/ministries/social-justice|title=Social Justice {{!}} Jesuit Asia Pacific Conference|website=sjapc.net|language=en|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the founding director of Rerum Novarum Centre, Fr. Ellacuría, retired. The director became [[Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy|Mercedarian]] Stephana Wei,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ucanews.com/story-archive/?post_name=/1995/10/23/Sister-first-woman-named-director-of-Jesuit-labor-center&amp;post_id=48153|title=Nun first woman named director of Jesuit labor center - ucanews.com|work=ucanews.com|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://host.cc.ntu.edu.tw/sec/schinfo/epaper/article.asp?num=1256&amp;sn=14110|title=National Taiwan U. e-Newsletter|last=|first=|date=|website=host.cc.ntu.edu.tw|language=zh-Hant|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the staff of Rerum Novarum consisted of ten employees full-time and several part-time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Rick Lamar Camp''' (June 10, 1953 – April 25, 2013), was a professional baseball player who [[pitcher|pitched]] in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) from [[1976 Atlanta Braves season|1976]] to [[1985 Atlanta Braves season|1985]] for the [[Atlanta Braves]]. Long after his retirement, Camp served a federal prison sentence for convictions related to stealing money from a mental health center.&lt;ref&gt;"Rick Camp, 59, Pitcher gained fame for hitting his only home run in '85 game" (April 28, 2013) ''The Washington Post.'' Page C9 [https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/rick-camp-atlanta-braves-pitcher-dies-at-59/2013/04/27/20b9d020-aebb-11e2-8bf6-e70cb6ae066e_story.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Camp was born in [[Trion, Georgia]], and was best known for hitting a game-tying 18th-inning home run on July 5, 1985, against the [[1985 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] with two outs and an 0-2 count off [[Tom Gorman (1980s pitcher)|Tom Gorman]]; this was the only home run of his nine-season career. Representing the tying run in the 19th inning, Camp struck out to end the game and was the losing pitcher. The Braves had run out of position players and had no choice but to let Camp bat in the 18th and 19th innings, even though his career batting average was .074.  The game started on July 4 at 7:05 pm, but due to extra innings and three long rain delays, it did not end until 3:55 am on July 5, the latest any major league game has ever ended. (After the last out, the night still wasn't over: the Braves gave their fans a promised fireworks show at four in the morning.)

In September 2005, Camp was sentenced, along with four other people, including former Georgia State Representative [[Robin L. Williams]] to a term in federal prison for conspiring to steal more than $2 million from the Community Mental Health Center in [[Augusta, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Sandy Hodson |author2=Tom Corwin |author3=Sylvia Cooper  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Williams is guilty on all 17 charges, Jury also convicts four co-defendants of crimes |work=Augusta Chronicle |date=2005-05-05 |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/050605/met_4082994.shtml |accessdate=2009-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905220946/http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/050605/met_4082994.shtml |archivedate=September 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Camp received a three year sentence, while Williams got ten years. Camp remained friends with fellow conspirator Chad Long, grandson of Georgia Speaker of the House [[Tom Murphy (Georgia politician)|Tom Murphy]], even after their conviction for trying to embezzle money together. Camp died on April 25, 2013 at his home at the age of 59.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/breaking-news/former-braves-pitcher-rick-camp-dead-at-age-60/nXXhs/ |title=Former Braves pitcher Rick Camp dead at age 60 |publisher=www.ajc.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9431">The '''Rubatab''' people ({{lang-ar|الرباطاب|ar-rubāṭāb}}) constitute one of many [[Sunni]] [[Arab]] [[riverine]] [[tribe]]s of Northern [[Sudan]]. They inhabit the region of the [[Fourth Cataract]] of the [[Nile]]. Similar to their neighbouring tribes, the mid-stream [[Manasir]]  and the downstream [[Shaigiya|Shaiqiyah]] (الشايقيّة), the Rubatab are an Arab tribe in the Northern Sudan, with an archaic Arabic mother tongue.
==Culture==

===Communication===
The Rubatab people speak [[Arabic]]. Their accent is different from other tribes in Sudan, but the language is the same, including the alphabets. People from other tribes may have difficulty understanding them because of their distinct accent.

People in Rubatab show respect for each other, even when it comes to greeting one another. They usually shake hands and put the left hand on the other person’s shoulder (for men) saying "[[salaam aleikum]]" and the other answers by saying "wa aleikumu salaam". Women show respect for each other by shaking hands, hugging or kissing each other on each cheek. People in the tribe have traditional [[Islamic]] names, like Mohammed and Ahmed.&lt;ref&gt;Masder, Nada. Personal interview. 29 Sept. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art forms===
The Rubatab people have a distinct dance style from other tribes. Weddings are the only occasions where men dance with women. The people generally prefer painting rather than crafting. Many people are farmers, and few are artists. A notable exception is Mohammed Sadiq, a famous comedian and actor.

The music is simple, the instruments are homemade. Women play drums and men play [[tambour]]. Men and women have their own distinct drums.

In local architecture, many one-story buildings are made with bricks and cement. Each home has two doors, one for men and one for women.

The dress style is similar to the northern Sudanese people. Women wear [[toubs|toub]] that are one piece of generally a brightly colored cloth wrapped around the entire body and covering the hair. Underneath women wear dresses which are worn without the toub indoors. Men wear [[jalabiya]], a traditional white full-length, long-sleeved gown with white trousers underneath. Wealthy Rubatab women wear jewellery to show their riches. Also, there is heavy emphasis on beauty in the eyes and women emphasize their eyes with eyeliner.&lt;ref&gt;Masder, Nada. Personal interview. 29 Sept. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social behavior===
The people of the Rubatab tribe play many different games. Women play a game called "Higla". In this game, they draw a circle on the floor and throw rocks inside the circle and jump. Males play soccer and a game with rocks and sticks. They usually play these games after school or during break times.

The Rubatab people follow Islamic holidays. They have many [[Sudanese cuisine|traditional foods]]. One is called [[asida]] (porridge in English), made from sorghum, and they eat it with a tomato sauce. Another dish is called gorassa, which looks like pancake, and it is eaten with tomato sauce. They have three meals each day, breakfast is at 10 a.m., lunch is at 3 p.m. and dinner (optional) is at 10 p.m.

By tradition, when a child is born, the mother is not allowed to go out until 40 days after the birth. She stays at home with some relatives and friends. People come and give the mother money. On the seventh day after birth the child is officially named. A sheep or a cow is killed for a feast to celebrate this event. The size of the feast and the type of animal depends on the family's wealth. After 40 days have passed, there is another party, and the mother is free to leave the home.

When someone dies, people call everyone from their family and all the family members come to the house. If the father dies, people close the room and wash the dead body. They wash the whole body with water, and afterwards they would put perfume on the body, and wrap it in white cloth. They put the body on a bed, and the body is then taken to the grave where it is buried according to Islamic procedures. When a husband dies, the wife wears white, and she stays in her home for four months and ten days. She is not supposed to put on any makeup as a sign of respect to the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Masder, Nada. Personal interview. 5 Oct. 2009.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social structure===

====Roles of women and girls====
Women are responsible for the house and children. Women stay at home and raise the children. Girls usually stay at home and help their mothers to cook or do other tasks. Girls are allowed to go to school and work. Although generally expected to be in the home, they can have any job they want and are also allowed to finish school. In the past, girls were not allowed to go to school. Some believe it was not safe to send girls to school, but now girls have a right to go to school.

====Roles of men and boys====
Men work to feed their family. They also must make decisions with their wives. They often sit outside separately from women during times of leisure talk or play cards. Boys have more freedom and will play outside or spend time with the men. Some families follow these general rules and others do not.

Many{{Who|date=June 2010}} believe that boys and men are more important than girls. They generally have a higher status, and people prefer having sons to daughters.

====Roles of young people====
Teenagers have to respect the elders and must follow general social rules about interaction depending on their family's perception of these traditional rules. Girls must respect boys and act like ladies by paying attention to how they dress and act. Boys are expected to act strong and emulate men. Boys must respect traditional rules about decency, which include not touching women.

====Roles of elders====
Old people are respected and honored by others in society. Elders teach children how to respect other people and punish those who do not follow directions.

====People and how they are important====
Rubatab people honor those who are generous with them.

====Choosing a spouse====
In the past, the groom would send his family&lt;!-- The groom sends his family to where? --&gt;.{{Clarify|date=June 2010}} The groom would introduce himself to the girl’s&lt;!-- A young girl or an adult woman? --&gt;{{Clarify|date=June 2010}} family. He would tell about himself, giving details to the family. The girl’s family would go and ask others in the community about the potential groom's character and reputation. Assuming all information gathered is favorable, he brings his family to introduce them to the other family. Men greet and socialize with the men and women with the women. Women bring gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Masder, Nada. Personal interview. 5 Oct. 2009.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutions===

====Family====
Most families in Rubatab give their son a house when he is ready to get married. The leader of the family is always the father. Mothers help make decision with the father, but the father is always the final decision. While some families follow traditional rules that show favoritism to boys, more recently some families treat girls more equally to boys.

====Religion====
The Rubatab people believe in Islam. Rubatab people trace their ancestry to Arabia. There is mutual respect for other tribes that believe in other religions. They are no other religions in the Rubatab tribe.

====Government====
Decisions are made by men mostly, but women do have rights if they treated fairly. Solutions are discussed and then put to a vote for a final decision. Meetings amongst decision-makers happen in safe place set aside for meetings. Meetings are often called by people in the government.

====Rules====
The rules in the group are respecting each other and treating people fairly. In the past, marriage outside the tribe was forbidden for both women and men.

====Education====
Girls and boys go to school. In some schools, girls sit separately from boys. There are girls' schools and boys' schools. The teachers are both male and female, but in high school usually women are the teachers. Subjects taught are mathematics, science and language, but the largest focus is on religion.&lt;ref&gt;Masder, Nada. Personal interview. 11 Oct. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic base===

Jobs are similar to the world, such as engineering. Wealthy persons buy luxury cars and live in quality houses. Some people are self-employed. In the past people weren't allowed to trade anything to the other group, but the rules changed, and now some people do.&lt;ref&gt;Masder, Nada. Personal interview. 15 Oct. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scholar-officials''', also known as '''Literati''', '''Scholar-gentlemen''' or '''Scholar-bureaucrats''' ({{zh|c=士大夫|p=shì dàfū}}) were politicians and government officials appointed by the [[emperor of China]] to perform day-to-day political duties from the [[Han dynasty]] to the end of the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1912, [[China]]'s last imperial dynasty. After the [[Sui dynasty]] these officials mostly came from the [[Landed gentry in China|scholar-gentry]] (紳士 ''shēnshì'') who had earned academic degrees (such as ''xiucai'', ''juren'', or ''[[jinshi (imperial examination)|jinshi]]'') by passing the [[imperial examination]]s. The scholar-officials were schooled in [[calligraphy]] and [[Confucianism|Confucian]] texts. They dominated the government and local life of China until the mid-20th century. The American philosopher and historian [[Charles Alexander Moore]] concluded: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Generally speaking, the record of these scholar-gentlemen has been a worthy one. It was good enough to be praised and imitated in 18th century Europe. Nevertheless, it has given China a tremendous handicap in their transition from government by men to government by law, and personal considerations in Chinese government have been a curse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Alexander Moore|title=The Chinese Mind: Essentials of Chinese Philosophy and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_DoyN2h56ucC&amp;pg=PA22|year=1967|publisher=U of Hawaii Press|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since only a select few could become court or local officials, the majority of the ''scholar-literati'' stayed in villages or cities as social leaders. The ''scholar-gentry'' carried out [[welfare|social welfare]] measures, taught in private schools, helped negotiate minor legal disputes, supervised community projects, maintained local law and order, conducted Confucian ceremonies, assisted in the governments collection of taxes, and preached Confucian moral teachings. As a class, these scholars claimed to represent morality and virtue. The [[county magistrate|district magistrate]], who by regulation was not allowed to serve in his home district, depended on the [[landed gentry in China|local gentry]] for advice and for carrying out projects, which gave them the power to benefit themselves and their clients.

Scottish people have a long history in Canada, dating back several centuries.
Many towns, rivers and mountains have been named in honour of Scottish explorers and traders such as Mackenzie Bay and Calgary is named after a Scottish beach. Most notably, the [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]] province of [[Nova Scotia]] is [[Latin]] for New Scotland. Once Scots formed the vanguard of the movement of Europeans across the continent. In more modern times, emigrants from Scotland have played a leading role in the social, political and economic history of Canada, being prominent in [[bank]]ing, [[labour union]]s, and [[politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sfu.ca/scottish/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416174029/http://www.sfu.ca/scottish/history.html |archivedate=2008-04-16 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The first documented Scottish settlement in the Americas was of [[Nova Scotia]] (New Scotland) in 1629. On 29 September 1621, the charter for the foundation of a colony was granted by [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland]] to Sir [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling|William Alexander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Fry| first=Michael|title=The Scottish Empire| publisher=Tuckwell Press| year =2001|isbn=1-84158-259-X|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1622 and 1628, Sir William launched four attempts to send colonists to Nova Scotia; all failed for various reasons. A successful occupation of Nova Scotia was finally achieved in 1629. The colony's charter, in law, made Nova Scotia (defined as all land between [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and [[New England]]) a part of mainland Scotland; this was later used to get around the English [[navigation acts]]. The Scots have influenced the cultural mix of [[Nova Scotia]] for centuries and constitute the largest ethnic group in the province, at 29.3% of its population. Many Scottish immigrants were monoglot [[Scottish Gaelic]] speakers from the [[Gàidhealtachd]] ([[Scottish Highlands]]). [[Canadian Gaelic]] was spoken as the first language in much of "Anglophone" Canada, such as [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Glengarry County]] in Ontario. Gaelic was the third most commonly spoken language in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Dembling. “Gaelic in Canada: new evidence from an old census.” In Cànan &amp; Cultar/Language &amp; Culture: Rannsachadh na Gàidhlig 3, edited by Wilson McLeod, James Fraser and Anja Gunderloch, 203-14. Edinburgh: Dunedin Academic Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the third-largest [[ethnic group]] in Canada and amongst the first Europeans to settle in the country, Scottish people have made a large impact on Canadian culture since colonial times. According to the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census of Canada]], the number of Canadians claiming full or partial Scottish descent is 4,714,970,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/highlights/ethnic/pages/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo=PR&amp;Code=01&amp;Table=2&amp;Data=Count&amp;StartRec=1&amp;Sort=3&amp;Display=All&amp;CSDFilter=5000|title=Statistics Canada: Ethnocultural Portrait of Canada Highlight Tables, 2006 Census|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|last=Canada|website=12.statcan.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 15.10% of the nation's total population.

===Chile===
{{main|Scottish Chilean}}
A large proportion of Scottish Chileans are sheep farmers in the [[Magallanes y la Antártica Chilena Region|Magallanes]] region of the far south of the country, and the city of [[Punta Arenas]] has a large Scottish foundation dating back to the 18th century.
A famous Scot, [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Thomas, Lord Cochrane]] (later 10th Earl of Dundonald) formed the [[Chilean Navy]] to help liberate Chile from Spain in the independence period. Chile developed a strong diplomatic relationship with [[Great Britain]] and invited more [[British people|British]] settlers to the country in the 19th century.

The Chilean government land deals invited settlement from Scotland and Wales in its southern provinces in the 1840s and 1850s. The number of Scottish Chileans is still higher in [[Patagonia]] and Magallanes regions.
''[[The Mackay School]]'', in [[Viña del Mar]] is an example of a school set up by Scottish Chileans. The Scottish and other British Chileans are primarily found in higher education as well in economic management and the country's cultural life.

The majority of Scotch-Irish originally came from [[Lowland Scotland]] and the [[Scottish Borders]] before migrating to the province of [[Ulster]] in [[Ireland]] (see ''[[Plantation of Ulster]]'')  and thence, beginning about five [[Generation|generations]] later, to North America in large numbers during the eighteenth century.

Self-reported numbers are regarded by demographers as massive under-counts, because Scottish ancestry is known to be disproportionately under-reported among the majority of mixed ancestry,&lt;ref&gt;Mary C. Walters, ''Ethnic Options: Choosing Identities in America'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990), pp. 31-6.&lt;/ref&gt; and because areas where people reported "American" ancestry were the places where, historically, 
Scottish and Scotch-Irish [[Protestants]] settled in [[North America|America]] (that is: along the North American coast, [[Appalachia]], and the Southeastern [[United States]]).

Scottish Americans descended from nineteenth-century Scottish immigrants tend to be concentrated in the West, while others in [[New England]] are the descendants of immigrants from the [[Maritime Provinces]] of [[Canada]], especially in the 1920s.

Americans of Scottish descent outnumber the population of Scotland, where 4,459,071 or 88.09% of people identified as ethnic Scottish in the 2001 Census.&lt;ref name="Ref_y"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&amp;-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP13&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-_sse=on |title=QT-P13.

A steady rate of Scottish immigration continued into the 20th century, with substantial numbers of Scots continued to arrive after 1945.&lt;ref name="Australia 2008"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Scots in Australia|date=2008|author=M. Prentis|publisher=[[University of New South Wales Press]]|isbn=9781921410215}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1900 until the 1950s, Scots favoured New South Wales, as well as Western Australia and Southern Australia.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} A strong cultural Scottish presence is evident in the Highland games, dance, Tartan day celebrations, Clan and Gaelic speaking societies found throughout modern Australia.

According to the 2011 Australian census 130,204 Australian residents were born in [[Scotland]],&lt;ref name="ABS Country of Birth"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.censusdata.abs.gov.au/ABSNavigation/prenav/ViewData?action=404&amp;documentproductno=0&amp;documenttype=Details&amp;order=1&amp;tabname=Details&amp;areacode=0&amp;issue=2006&amp;producttype=Census%20Tables&amp;javascript=true&amp;textversion=false&amp;navmapdisplayed=true&amp;breadcrumb=POLTD&amp;&amp;collection=Census&amp;period=2006&amp;productlabel=Country%20of%20Birth%20of%20Person%20(full%20classification%20list)%20by%20Sex&amp;producttype=Census%20Tables&amp;method=Place%20of%20Usual%20Residence&amp;topic=Birthplace&amp; |title = 20680-Country of Birth of Person (full classification list) by Sex&amp;nbsp;— Australia|format = Microsoft Excel download |publisher = [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] | work = 2006 Census| accessdate = 2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; while 1,792,600 claimed Scottish ancestry, either alone or in combination with another ancestry.&lt;ref name="abs.gov.au"/&gt; This is the fourth most commonly nominated ancestry and represents over 8.9% of the total population of Australia.

===New Zealand===
{{main|Scottish New Zealander}}
[[File:NZ Religious denominations by TA 2013.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|The settlement of English in the North Island and northern South Island and Scottish in the Deep South is reflected in the dominance of Anglicanism and Presbyterianism in the respective regions.]]
Scottish migration to New Zealand dates back to the earliest period of European colonisation, with a large proportion of [[Pākehā]] New Zealanders being of Scottish descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturemagics.com/world-guide/new-zealand.shtm|title=Loading...|website=Naturemagics.com|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, identification as "British" or "European" New Zealanders can sometimes obscure their origin. Many Scottish New Zealanders also have [[Māori people|Māori]] or other non-European ancestry.

The majority of Scottish immigrants settled in the South Island. All over New Zealand, the Scots developed different means to bridge the old homeland and the new. Many Caledonian societies were formed, well over 100 by the early twentieth century, who helped maintain Scottish culture and traditions. From the 1860s, these societies organised annual Caledonian Games throughout New Zealand. The Games were sports meets that brought together Scottish settlers and the wider New Zealand public. In so doing, the Games gave Scots a path to cultural integration as Scottish New Zealanders.&lt;ref&gt;Tanja Bueltmann, "'No Colonists are more Imbued with their National Sympathies than Scotchmen,'" ''New Zealand Journal of History'' (2009) 43#2 pp 169–181 [http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/document.php?wid=1771&amp;action=null online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lay Association of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] founded [[Dunedin]] at the head of Otago Harbour in 1848 as the principal town of its [[Scotland|Scottish]] settlement. The name comes from ''Dùn Èideann'', the [[Scottish Gaelic]] name for [[Edinburgh]], the Scottish capital.&lt;ref&gt;McLintock, A H (1949), ''The History of Otago; the origins and growth of a Wakefield class settlement'', Dunedin, NZ: Otago Centennial Historical Publications, OCLC 154645934&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Kettle]] the city's surveyor, instructed to emulate the characteristics of Edinburgh, produced a striking, 'Romantic' design.&lt;ref&gt;Hocken, Thomas Moreland (1898), ''Contributions to the Early History of New Zealand (Settlement of Otago)'', London, UK: Sampson Low, Marston and Company, OCLC 3804372&lt;/ref&gt; The result was both grand and quirky streets as the builders struggled and sometimes failed to construct his bold vision across the challenging landscape. Captain [[William Cargill]], a veteran of the war against Napoleon, was the secular leader. The Reverend [[Thomas Burns (minister)|Thomas Burns]], a nephew of the poet [[Robert Burns]], was the spiritual guide.

==Europe==

===Northern Ireland===
{{main|Plantations of Ireland|Ulster Scots people}}
The Ulster Scots (Ulster-Scots: Ulstèr-Scotch), commonly known as Scots-Irish outside of Ireland, are an [[ethnic group]] in [[Ireland]], found mostly in the [[Ulster]] region and to a lesser extent in the rest of Ireland. Their ancestors were mostly [[Protestant]] [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland]] Scottish migrants, the largest numbers coming from the [[Border Reivers]] culture of the [[Scottish Borders]], from [[Galloway]] and [[Ayrshire]], although some came from further north in the Scottish Lowlands and also to a lesser extent from the [[Highlands]].

These Scots migrated to Ireland in large numbers both as a result of the government-sanctioned [[Plantation of Ulster]], a planned process of [[colonisation]] which took place under the auspices of [[James VI of Scotland]] and I of England on land confiscated from members of the [[Gaelic nobility of Ireland]] who fled Ulster and as part of a larger migration or unplanned wave of settlement.

Ulster Scots emigrated onwards from Ireland in significant numbers to what is now the [[Scotch-Irish Americans|United States]] and to all corners of the then-worldwide [[British Empire]]—what are now [[Scotch-Irish Canadians|Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], the West Indies, to [[British India]], and to a lesser extent to [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]].  Scotch-Irish (or Scots-Irish) is a traditional term for Ulster Scots who emigrated to North America.

===Poland===
From as far back as the mid-16th century there were Scots trading and settling in [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/heritage/people-places/scotland-and-poland-a-500-year-relationship-1-4081795 |title=Scotland and Poland - a 500 year relationship |work=The Scotsman |date=24 March 2016 |accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "Scotch Pedlar's Pack in Poland" became a proverbial expression. It usually consisted of cloths, woollen goods and linen kerchiefs (head coverings). Itinerants also sold tin utensils and ironware such as scissors and knives. Along with the protection offered by [[Stephen Báthory|King Stephen]] in the Royal Grant of 1576, a district in [[Kraków]] was assigned to Scottish immigrants.

Records from 1592 mention Scots settlers granted citizenship of Kraków, and give their employment as trader or merchant. Fees for citizenship ranged from 12 Polish florins to a musket and gunpowder, or an undertaking to marry within a year and a day of acquiring a holding.

By the 17th century, an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Scots lived in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name=diaspora&gt;Eric Richards (2004). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JknDbX3ae1MC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Britannia's children: emigration from England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland]''". Continuum International Publishing Group. p.53. {{ISBN|1-85285-441-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many came from [[Dundee]] and [[Aberdeen]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Scots could be found in Polish towns on the banks of the [[Vistula]] as far south as [[Kraków]]. Settlers from [[Aberdeenshire]] were mainly Episcopalians or Catholics, but there were also large numbers of Calvinists. As well as Scottish traders, there were also many Scottish soldiers in Poland. In 1656, a number of Scottish highlanders who were disenchanted with [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s rule went to Poland to join the service of the [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|King of Sweden]] in his [[Deluge_(history)#Swedish_invasion|war against it]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The Scots integrated well and many acquired great wealth. They contributed to many charitable institutions in the host country, but did not forget their homeland; for example, in 1701 when collections were made for the restoration fund of the [[Marischal College]], Aberdeen, Scottish settlers in Poland gave generously.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Many royal grants and privileges were granted to Scottish merchants until the 18th century, at which time the settlers began to merge more and more into the native population. [[Charles Edward Stuart|"Bonnie Prince Charlie"]] was half Polish, since he was the son of [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Stuart]], the "Old Pretender", and [[Maria Clementina Sobieska|Clementina Sobieska]], granddaughter of [[John III Sobieski|Jan Sobieski]], King of Poland.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1199">A '''surrogate marriage''' describes the arrangement where a woman is [[infertile]] or dies young and her family substitutes another woman to bear children for the husband.

==Cultural roots==
Surrogate marriages exist in some African cultures, such as the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etd.unisa.ac.za/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-04292005-153119/unrestricted/01dissertation.pdf The Continuity of Life in African Religion with Reference to Marriage and Death among the Zulu People] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930192554/http://etd.unisa.ac.za/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-04292005-153119/unrestricted/01dissertation.pdf |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The root of the arrangement is the belief that marriage is an arrangement for the continuity of life.  Where the life of the family or clan cannot be continued due to infertility or death, the family of the wife can substitute a female relative to bear children for the husband on behalf of the wife.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT guidelines, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. --&gt;
A bamboo cutter named Sanuki no Miyatsuko discovers a miniature girl inside a glowing bamboo shoot. Believing her to be a divine presence, he and his wife decide to raise her as their own, calling her "Princess". The girl grows rapidly and conspicuously, causing her parents to marvel and earning her the nickname "Takenoko" (Little Bamboo) from the other village children. Sutemaru, the oldest among Kaguya's friends, develops a close relationship with her.

Miyatsuko comes upon gold and fine cloth in the bamboo grove in the same way he found his daughter. He takes these as proof of her divine royalty and begins planning to make her a proper princess. He relocates the family to the capital, forcing her to leave her friends behind. She finds herself in a mansion, replete with servants. She is also saddled with a governess who is tasked with taming her into a noblewoman. She struggles with the restraints of nobility, arguing that life should be full of laughter and struggle.

When the girl comes of age, she is granted the formal name of "Princess Kaguya" for the light and life that radiates from her. Miyatsuko holds a celebration in commemoration of her naming. At the celebration, Kaguya overhears partygoers ridiculing her father's attempts to turn a peasant girl into a noble through money. Kaguya flees the capital in despair and runs back to the mountains, seeking Sutemaru and her other friends, but discovers that they have all moved away. Kaguya passes out in the snow and awakens back at the party.

Kaguya grows in beauty, attracting scores of suitors. Five men of noble standing court her, comparing her to mythical treasures. Kaguya tells them she will only marry whoever can bring her the mythical treasure mentioned. Two suitors attempt to persuade her with counterfeits. The third abandons his conquest out of cowardice, and the fourth attempts to woo her with flattering lies. When one of the men is killed in his quest, Kaguya falls into [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Eventually, the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] takes notice of her. Taken with her beauty, he makes advances toward her, revolting her. Kaguya then demonstrates the ability to disappear at will, surprising the Emperor. Understanding that he has been too forward, the Emperor takes his leave.

Kaguya reveals to her parents that she originally came from the [[Moon]] after it spoke to her. Once a resident of the Moon, she broke its laws, hoping to be exiled to Earth so that she could experience mortal life. When the Emperor made his advances, she silently begged the Moon to help her. Having heard her prayer, the Moon will reclaim her during the next [[full moon]]. Kaguya confesses her attachment to Earth and her reluctance to leave.

Miyatsuko swears to protect Kaguya and begins assembling defensive forces. Kaguya returns to her hometown in the mountains once more. She finds Sutemaru and tells him she would have been happiest with him; Sutemaru vows to protect her. The two run around the grass field and Kaguya demonstrates the ability to fly. However, she loses it when they fly by the Moon, and the two drop into the water. Sutemaru wakes up on the grass field, thinking it was a dream, while Kaguya is seen in a carriage going back to the palace.

On the night of the full moon, a procession of celestial beings led by the Buddha descends from the Moon, and Miyatsuko is unable to stop it. An attendant offers Kaguya a robe that will erase her memories of Earth. Kaguya begs the attendant to grant her a last moment with her parents.

The attendant assures her that upon returning to the Moon, she will be free of Earth's impurities. Kaguya rebuffs her, saying that Earth is full of wonder and life. The attendant then drapes the robe around Kaguya, and she appears to forget about her life on Earth. The procession ascends to the Moon, leaving Miyatsuko and his wife distraught. Kaguya looks back one last time, and tears run down her eyes as she recognizes the love from her parents.

==Experimental evidence==
Some of the common experiments in [[experimental economics]] concerning the study of second-party punishments with respect to distribution and cooperation norms have been [[dictator game]]s and [[Prisoner's dilemma|prisoner's dilemma games]].&lt;ref name="Fehr" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fehr2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fehr|first=Ernst|author2=Fischbacher, Urs |title=The nature of human altruism|journal=Nature|year=2003|volume=425|issue=6960|pages=785–91|doi=10.1038/nature02043|url=http://ebour.com.ar/pdfs/The%20nature%20of%20human%20altruism.pdf|pmid=14574401|bibcode=2003Natur.425..785F}}&lt;/ref&gt; These games can also be effectively used in the study of third-party punishments with respect to distribution and cooperation norms with some modifications.

===Third-party dictator game===
Concerning third-party dictator game (TP-DG), the game was modified to include a third person with a punishment option between the dictator and the recipient. The dictator was given an endowment of 100, of which he could choose to share any portion with the recipient. The third person observer was also given an endowment of 50, of which he could choose to spend in order to punish the dictator. If self-interest was the driving force for the decision making, then the dictator would choose to donate none of his endowment, and the third party observer would choose to spend none of his endowment punishing the dictator. However, roughly 60% of the third party observers chose to punish dictators who donated less than half their endowment.&lt;ref name="Fehr" /&gt;

In a variation of the TP-DG, the third party observer could choose to spend part of the endowment to punish the dictator or could spend part of the endowment to compensate the recipient. About 40% of the third party observers chose to do both, while 32% chose to compensate the recipient and only about 6% opted to punish only. This indicates that compensation is preferred over punishment in the TP-DG when an offer is perceived as unfair. This suggests that third-party punishment may be motivated by a desire to both provide justice for those who have been wronged and to reprimand those who violate expected social norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Punitive versus compensatory reactions to injustice: Emotional antecedents to third-party interventions|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103110002210|journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date = 2011-03-01|pages = 477–480|volume = 47|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.jesp.2010.10.004|first = Sebastian|last = Lotz|first2 = Tyler G.|last2 = Okimoto|first3 = Thomas|last3 = Schlösser|first4 = Detlef|last4 = Fetchenhauer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third-party prisoner's dilemma===
Concerning third-party prisoner's dilemma (TP-PD), the game was modified so that in addition to two players who would choose to either cooperate or defect, a third party observer could choose to punish the players. The payoffs of the game were such that the players would be best off if they defected; however, if both players chose to defect, their payoff would be less than if they had cooperated. The observer could then choose to spend from his endowment to punish the defectors who chose to put self-interest ahead of cooperation. From previous theories,&lt;ref name=Fischbacher1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischbacher|first=Urs|title=Are people conditionally cooperative? Evidence from a public goods experiment|journal=Economics Letters|year=2001|volume=71|issue=3|pages=397–404|doi=10.1016/S0165-1765(01)00394-9|hdl=20.500.11850/146559}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dawes1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dawes|first=Robyn M.|title=Social Dilemmas|journal=International Journal of Psychology|year=2000|volume=35|issue=2|pages=111–116|doi=10.1080/002075900399402}}&lt;/ref&gt; it can be concluded that subjects are willing to cooperate if the probability that others will also do so is sufficiently large. Once again, if self-interest was the decision maker for these players, neither would choose to cooperate, and the observer would also choose to keep his full endowment and not issue any punishments. However, about 45.8% of observers chose to punish the defector when he is paired with a cooperator, and 20.8% chose to punish both players if they had both defected. It's important to note that the magnitude of punishment was much larger when one defected.&lt;ref name="Fehr" /&gt;

===Second-party vs. third-party punishments===
With respect to the distribution norms violations (dictator games), it has been shown that second-party punishments are consistently higher than third-party punishments for dictators that choose to share less than half of their endowment. The punishments were such that the dictators could still profit from giving less than half in the third-party conditions, but could not profit in the second-party conditions. The levels of punishment were consistently low for both second and third-party punishments if the levels of endowment were higher than half.&lt;ref name="Fehr" /&gt;

With respect to the cooperation norms violations (prisoner's dilemma), it has been shown that second-party punishments are consistently higher than third-party punishments for defectors. The punishments were such that the defectors could still profit in the third-party conditions, but could not profit in the second-party conditions. Punishment for cooperators were negligible under both conditions.&lt;ref name="Fehr" /&gt;

==Evolution and neural basis==
Current [[Sociocultural evolution|evolutionary models]] state that human altruism evolved through the selective (cultural or biological) extinction of groups in inter-group conflicts.&lt;ref name=Gintis1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gintis, Herbert|title=Strong Reciprocity and Human Sociality|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|year=2000|volume=206|issue=2|pages=169–79|doi=10.1006/jtbi.2000.2111|pmid=10966755|citeseerx=10.1.1.335.7226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Henrich2&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Henrich, Joseph |author2=Boyd, Robert |title=Why People Punish Defectors Weak Conformist Transmission can Stabilize Costly Enforcement of Norms in Cooperative Dilemmas|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|year=2001|volume=208|issue=1|pages=79–89|doi=10.1006/jtbi.2000.2202|pmid=11162054}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boyd1&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Boyd, Robert |author2=Herbert Gintis |author3=Samuel Bowles |author4=Peter J. Richerson |title=The evolution of altruistic punishment|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2003|volume=100|issue=6|pages=3531–3535|doi=10.1073/pnas.0630443100|pmid=12631700 |pmc=152327|bibcode=2003PNAS..100.3531B }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is also evidence for altruism and norms between groups.&lt;ref name="Parochial" /&gt; Some models suggest that third party punishment of "free-riders" (those who do not cooperate) leads to increased group cooperation due to individual selection for cooperative traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Group Cooperation without Group Selection: Modest Punishment Can Recruit Much Cooperation|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2015-04-20|pmc = 4404356|pmid = 25893241|pages = e0124561|volume = 10|issue = 4|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0124561|first = Max M.|last = Krasnow|first2 = Andrew W.|last2 = Delton|first3 = Leda|last3 = Cosmides|first4 = John|last4 = Tooby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When subjects were examined with a [[Positron emission tomography|PET scan]] while playing a second-party [[Dictator Game|trust game]] with another player, it was shown that when they administered punishment, the [[dorsal striatum]], an area of the brain associated with the processing of rewards as a result of goal-directed actions, was activated. It was also shown that individuals with stronger activations of the dorsal striatum were willing to incur greater cost in order to punish the norm violator. This suggests that the people that administrated punishment against norm violators derived satisfaction from the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dominique J. -F. de Quervain, Urs Fischbacher, Valerie Treyer, Melanie Schellhammer, Ulrich Schnyder, Alfred Buck and Ernst Fehr|title=The Neural Basis of Altruistic Punishment|journal=Science|year=2004|volume=305|issue=5688|pages=1254–1258|doi=10.1126/science.1100735|pmid=15333831|bibcode=2004Sci...305.1254D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|FMRI]] has also been used to examine third-party punishment. Subjects participated in a TP-DG during the scan as either a second party recipient or a third party observer. The [[nucleus accumbens]], a brain region associated with reward, had punishment-related activation for both the second-party and third-party punishment conditions. The overall pattern of activation was consistent between the two conditions, though activation was stronger in the second party recipients. This suggests that second-party and third-party punishment decisions have a common neural basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Beyond revenge: Neural and genetic bases of altruistic punishment|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811910010244|journal = NeuroImage|date = 2011-01-01|pages = 671–680|volume = 54|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.07.051|first = Alexander|last = Strobel|first2 = Jan|last2 = Zimmermann|first3 = Anja|last3 = Schmitz|first4 = Martin|last4 = Reuter|first5 = Stefanie|last5 = Lis|first6 = Sabine|last6 = Windmann|first7 = Peter|last7 = Kirsch|pmid=20673803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross-culture variations==
It has been shown that altruistic punishment exists across many examined populations, but that there is also a large variance between them. Data gathered from 15 different populations showed that when participating in TP-DG, all societies showed a decreasing frequency of punishment as the dictator's offer approached 50%. There was, however, a large variance between societies as to how much of their endowment the observers were willing to pay in order to punish the dictator. These variances were not attributed to economic and demographic variables. It was also found that societies with high degrees of punishment also exhibit more altruistic behavior.&lt;ref name="Henrich1" /&gt; Other studies have suggested that people in larger, more complex societies engage in significantly more third-party punishment than people in small-scale societies.&lt;ref name="Marlowe1" /&gt;

== Gender and age differences ==
Women have been found to contribute more in dictator games and also to be more likely to accept an offer than men, rather than to reject an offer to punish the dictator. This was found for second-party punishment experiments but has not been observed in studies examining third-party punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chivalry and solidarity in ultimatum games|journal = Economic Inquiry|date = 2001-04-01|issn = 1465-7295|pages = 171–188|volume = 39|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1465-7295.2001.tb00059.x|first = Cc|last = Eckel|first2 = Pj|last2 = Grossman}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mock trial experiments studying third-party punishment using legal scenarios, woman majority mock juries are more likely to convict than non-woman majority juries and are more likely to find a defendant guilty in a rape case.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = "Gender and Jury Deliberations: The Contributions of Social Science" by Lucy Fowler|issue = 1|pages = 1|url = http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmjowl/vol12/iss1/2|journal = William &amp; Mary Journal of Race, Gender, and Social Justice|volume = 12|accessdate = 2015-12-15|date = October 2005|last1 = Fowler|first1 = Lucy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men are more likely to be influenced by the attractiveness of the defendant than women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are significant differences in third-party punishment behavior between age groups. In a variation of the TP-DG, 8-year-olds based their punishment on the outcome of the unfair result and did not consider the intention of the actor in both second-party and third-party punishment decisions. Adolescents integrated the outcome and the intention when making second- but not third-party punishment decisions. Adults integrated the outcome and the intention of the act for both second- and third-party punishment. This demonstrates developmental differences in how third-party punishment decisions are made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Outcomes and intentions in children's, adolescents', and adults' second- and third-party punishment behavior|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027714001115|journal = Cognition|date = 2014-10-01|pages = 97–103|volume = 133|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.cognition.2014.06.001|first = Michaela|last = Gummerum|first2 = Maria T.|last2 = Chu|pmid=24997554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parochial altruism==
[[Parochialism|Parochial]] altruism refers to altruism that is directed in a preferential manner towards members of one's own social group.&lt;ref name=Rusch&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rusch|first=Hannes|title=The evolutionary interplay of intergroup conflict and altruism in humans: a review of parochial altruism theory and prospects for its extension|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|year=2014|volume=281|issue=1794|pages=20141539|doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.1539|pmid=25253457|pmc=4211448}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to examine this effect, a study examined the outcomes of TP-DG experiments carried out in between two [[Papua New Guinea]] indigenous groups. The games had 4 conditions, which included: players A (dictator), B (recipient), and C (observer) all from the same group; only A and B from the same group; only A and C from the same group; only B and C from the same group.&lt;ref name="Parochial" /&gt; Current [[Social behavior|behavioral theories]] state that norms are emergent from interactions within groups,&lt;ref name=Bornstein1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bornstein|first=Gary|title=Intergroup Conflict: Individual, Group, and Collective Interests|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|year=2003|volume=7|issue=2|pages=129–145|doi=10.1207/S15327957PSPR0702_129-145|pmid=12676644|citeseerx=10.1.1.487.5022}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore, outsiders don’t obey the norm nor benefit from the altruistic behavior the norm enforces. This theory would therefore predict that no punishment will occur in any of the cases except for the ABC treatment condition. However, it was found that punishment was qualitatively similar in all 4 conditions, which suggests that [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] sharing norms exist within-groups and also between-groups.&lt;ref name="Parochial" /&gt;

It was observed that, while all 4 conditions exhibited egalitarian sharing norms, punishments were much higher in the ABC and BC conditions. This suggests that victims are more protected if the third-party observer belongs to same group as them. It was also found that the dictators expected much harsher punishments if third-party observers belonged to the same group as the victim. It was also found that transfers were higher in groups with the same A and B members, and lower in groups with the same A and C members, suggesting that the dictators expected leniency from third-party observers of their own group.&lt;ref name="Parochial" /&gt;

'''Tradability''' is the property of a [[Good (economics and accounting)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]] that can be sold in another location distant from where it was produced. A good that is not tradable is called '''non-tradable'''. Different goods have differing levels of tradability: the higher the cost of transportation and the shorter the shelf life, the less tradable a good is.  Prepared food, for example, is not generally considered a tradable good; it will be sold in the city in which it is produced and does not directly compete with other cities' prepared foods. [[Haircut]]s and [[massage]]s are also non-tradable.&lt;ref name="economist 9304272"&gt;{{cite news

== Price equalization ==
Perfectly tradable goods, like shares of stock, are subject to the [[law of one price]]: they should cost the same amount wherever they are bought. This law requires an [[efficient market]].  Any discrepancy that may exist in pricing perfectly tradable goods because of [[foreign exchange market]] movements, for instance, is called an [[arbitrage]] opportunity. Goods that cannot be costlessly traded are not subject to this law.

Less than perfectly tradable goods subject to distortions such as the [[Penn effect]], for example, a lowering of prices in less wealthy place. Perfectly non-tradable goods are not subject to any leveling of price, thus the disparity between similar parcels of [[real estate]] in different locations.

There should be no distortions in [[purchasing power parity]] for perfectly tradable goods. The differences between it and other methods are the result of non-tradable goods and the above-mentioned Penn effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="734">The '''Uduk''' are a [[Nilo-Saharan]] group from eastern [[Sudan]]. They call themselves ''Kwanim Pa'' and are culturally and linguistically related to neighboring communities, such as the [[Gumuz people|Gumuz]] and the [[Kwama people|Kwama]] from the Sudan-Ethiopia borderland. Due to the recent war in southern Sudan they have been forced to emigrate to other countries, especially [[Ethiopia]]. Following the peace agreement in 2005, some Uduk have started to return home.

'''Laotian women''' have long been active participants in [[Laos|their nation]]'s society, involved in politics, driving social transformation and development, becoming active in the world of business and serving as [[nurse]]s and food producers for [[Military of Laos|the military]]. Due to modernization and [[Rural society in Laos|rural uprooting]], Lao women have begun to embrace lifestyles that are foreign to traditional Laotian ideals.&lt;ref name=Lonely/&gt;

==Legal status==
[[File:Woman in Laos 1.jpg|thumb|250 px|Khmu woman in village Ban Huay fay, region [[Luang Prabang]], Laos]]
[[File:Three Lao girls reading.JPG|thumb|250 px|Lao girls reading]]
Under the [[Constitution of Laos]], Lao women are legally equal to Lao men.  They have the right to vote and to inherit property.  In practice, the roles and status of women in Lao society often depend on ethnic affiliation.&lt;ref name=Lonely/&gt;  In some cases, as in the status of [[Lao Loum]] women, the youngest daughter is often assigned the task of caring for elderly parents in return for inheritance benefits like land and business.&lt;ref name=Lonely/&gt;

After receiving her inheritance, the daughter does not obtain direct control over the land or business, as her husband possesses executive power over such matters.&lt;ref name=Lonely/&gt;  Other women from different ethnic groups do not inherit anything.&lt;ref name=Lonely/&gt;  In 1993, the government of Lao established a program of land surveying and titling which was nominally more beneficial to female landholders. National legislation declaring Lao men and women as "equally entitled to hold property" was also promulgated, including the Family Law proclaiming that "any property purchased during marriage is regarded as joint property", and that the "land owned by a woman prior to her marriage remains her individual property, as does any land she inherits from her parents”.&lt;ref name=WB&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTARD/EXTAGISOU/0,,contentMDK:20960914~menuPK:2758776~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:2502781,00.html Module 10 - The Lao People’s Democratic Republic: Preserving Women’s Rights in Land Titling], worldbank.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workforce==
Many rural Lao women undertake a variety of semi-formal roles in their communities, including handicrafts, commerce, public health, and education, in addition to their traditional roles as homemakers and the caretakers of children.  In the cities and at the government level, Lao women are underrepresented, particularly in high-level positions. In terms of wages, women typically receive lower salaries than men.&lt;ref name=Lonely/&gt;

==Religion==
In connection with [[Lao Buddhism]] and traditional beliefs, many Lao women are taught that they can only attain [[nirvana]] after they have been [[reincarnation|reborn as men]].&lt;ref name=Lonely&gt;Burke, Andrew and Justine Vaisutis. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jm4GBvwaF50C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=nirvana+for+women+in+Laos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GrVk5lanbQ&amp;sig=36p3Kl980G9mBPt7UI_yq-z_lXU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Y1_DTbKQDYG6tgfu482MBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=nirvana%20for%20women%20in%20Laos&amp;f=false Women in Laos], Laos, Lonely Planet, 2007, 372 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and training==
[[File:Silk dying.JPG|thumb|250px|Two Laotian women and their silk product.]]
[[File:Primary Laos.jpg|250px|thumb|right|School girls in a small village school in a rural area in northern Laos]]
Fewer Laotian girls enroll in schools than boys.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=x0n9XTlljesC&amp;pg=PT114&amp;dq=women+paid+less+than+men+%22+Laos%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4pfcTZXJJ83irAe8zOzGDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=lao&amp;f=false The world's women, 2000: trends and statistics]''. [[United Nations]]. 2001. P. 87&lt;/ref&gt;  After [[World War II]], many women, such as the silk weavers of the Bai Hai population, became increasingly engaged in unskilled manual labour.  Despite being less literate and educated than men on average (63% of Lao females can read and write, compared to 83% of males),&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/la.html CIA World Factbook 2011: Laos]" [[Central Intelligence Agency]]&lt;/ref&gt; Lao women increasingly became the primary wage earners of their family units, especially in rural areas.

In recent decades, Lao women have furthermore benefited from [[microfinancing]] programs offered by organizations such as the Social Economic Developers Association (SEDA). In such programs, women receive training in establishing businesses, business management, procurement of materials, mass production, price negotiation for products, financial management, marketing strategies, writing skills, business planning, and decision-making. This is intended to assist women in becoming empowered and obtaining "financial stability".&lt;ref name=Halligan&gt;Halligan, Charlotte. [http://www.asianweek.com/2009/09/02/laos-forgotten-women/ Laos' Forgotten Women], September 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Another organization involved in women's education is the Lao Disabled Women's Development Centre, an institution that trains [[disability|handicapped]] Lao women. The Lao Disabled Women's Development Centre was established by Chanhpheng Sivila, and functioned primarily as a series of workshops before expanding in 2002.&lt;ref name=Kemp&gt;Kemp, Melody. [http://www.ips.org/mdg3/rights-laos-how-women-cope-with-disability-part-1-5/ RIGHTS-LAOS: How Women Cope With Disability – Part 1], Social and Economic Developers Association in Laos, November 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Another similar group focusing on the rights, empowerment, and health of Lao women is the Committee for Women's Advancement of the province of [[Sayaboury]].&lt;ref name=WP&gt;[http://laospdrnews.wordpress.com/category/womens-rights/ Sayaboury to focus on improve the public health service for women], In Health, Women's Rights, Archive for the ‘Women’s Rights’ Category, April 20–21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
{{Women in society sidebar}}
The women of Lao obtained the right to vote and to be elected in 1958.&lt;ref name=OWP/&gt; They remain underrepresented in government at both local and national levels.&lt;ref name=Lonely/&gt;

In recent decades women have made notable inroads into politics. In 1997, [[Onechanh Thammavong]] became one of the vice-presidents of the [[National Assembly of Laos]].&lt;ref name=OWP&gt;[http://www.onlinewomeninpolitics.org/laos/laomain.htm Female candidates for National Assembly election promoted], In Women's Rights, March 29–30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, the National Assembly provided a seminar for forty-seven female candidates in advance of the 7th Lao general elections in April 2011, in order to instil the “significant duties of the national legislature body” in the women.&lt;ref name=OWP/&gt;

==Marriage==
In Lao society, women who divorce their husbands are traditionally stigmatised, often finding it difficult to find another spouse.&lt;ref name=Lonely/&gt;

==Prostitution and trafficking==
As with many of the poorer states of [[South-East Asia]], [[Human trafficking in Laos|human trafficking]] and [[prostitution]] are serious issues for Lao women.&lt;ref name=State&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/eap/135997.htm 2009 Human Rights Report: Laos].

They are a branch of the [[Mandé peoples]] of [[West Africa]], and closely related to the [[Susu people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Wheat| title=Atlantic Africa and the Spanish Caribbean, 1570-1640| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Fq0CAAAQBAJ |year=2016| publisher=University of North Carolina Press| isbn=978-1-4696-2380-1| pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars classify the two as one group. The Yalunka are notable for having first converted to Islam, but then renouncing Islam en masse when Muslim [[Fula people]] began dominating their region.&lt;ref name="Shillington2013p537"/&gt; The Yalunka fought against the [[Fula jihads]], left Futa Jallon, migrated and established new towns such as [[Falaba]] near the region where [[Rokel River]] starts, while others settled among the [[Koranko]], [[Limba people (Sierra Leone)|Limba]] and [[Kissi people]]. Ultimately, the Yalunka were subdued and absorbed by the [[Fulani Empire]].&lt;ref name="Shillington2013p537"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin Shillington|title=Encyclopedia of African History 3-Volume Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=umyHqvAErOAC&amp;pg=PA537 |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-45670-2|page=537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They speak the [[Yalunka language]] which belongs to the Mande branch of the [[Niger–Congo language family]]. Yalunka is mutually intelligible with [[Susu language|Susu]], another Mande language. In the contemporary era, the Yalunka are concentrated mostly in Guinea and [[Sierra Leone]].

==History==
The ancient history of Yalunka people is unknown. The earliest evidence suggests that sometime around the eleventh century, the Yalunka people arrived in the hilly plateau region of the Futa Jallon in Guinea.&lt;ref name="Appiah2010p490"/&gt; They converted to Islam. After the seventeenth century, Islamic theocracies supported by the [[Fula people]] began a period of Fula dominance and their version of Islam in the region traditionally occupied by the Yalunka. The Yalunka people, along with the [[Susu people]], then renounced Islam.&lt;ref name="Shillington2013p537"/&gt; The Fula people and their leaders such as Ibrahima Musa and Ibrahima Sori launched a series of jihads targeted against the Yalunka in the eighteenth century. The Yalunka were defeated, subdued and returned to Islam in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark R. Lipschutz|author2=R. Kent Rasmussen|title=Dictionary of African Historical Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYoPkk04Yp4C |year=1989|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-06611-3|pages=88, 113, 236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion and traditional beliefs==
The Yalunka are predominantly [[Muslim]] (99%). At the same time, they have retained many pre-Islamic beliefs and practices, combining the two in a syncretic way. One of their traditional practice is ''Barinkiina'', which involves making sacrifices in memory of their ancestors to gain power. They also make sacrifices for ''Suxurena'' and ''Nyinanna'', or nature spirits, in order to gain powers.&lt;ref name="Taylor2014p153"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bankole Kamara Taylor|title=Sierra Leone: The Land, Its People and History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I__jAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA153 |year=2014|publisher=New Africa Pres|isbn=978-9987-16-038-9|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are devoted Muslims and their fear of persecution have prevented them from converting to other religions.&lt;ref name="Taylor2014p153"/&gt;

The New Testament was translated into the [[Yalunka language]] by [[Pioneer Bible Translators]]'s current president, Greg Pruett in 2013.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Society==
The Yalunka live in larger settlements established since the 18th century. The Yalunka region is mixed savannah and forest. The country is hilly, and most of it is 1,000 to 2,000 feet above sea level. Most Yalunka settlements are located in the valleys between the hills. Since the 1950s, many Yalunka have migrated to cities to find work.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The Yalunka people commonly practice [[polygyny]] (having multiple wives). Arranged marriages are their traditional practice, and they follow the [[Sharia|Islamic law]] that a man may have up to four living wives. The first wife has seniority and authority over wives he marries later.&lt;ref name="Taylor2014p153"/&gt; The husband, according to Bankole Taylor, "has complete control over his wives and is responsible for feeding and clothing them".&lt;ref name="Taylor2014p153"/&gt;

The Yalunka society is [[patriarchal]], consisting of households headed by a man, his wife or wives, and their unmarried children.&lt;ref name="Taylor2014p153"/&gt; Extended households form a compound, which may consist of two or more married men from the same father and their families, each living in a separate hut.&lt;ref name="Taylor2014p153"/&gt;

==Economy==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2016}}
The Yalunka are primarily subsistence [[farmers]], with rice and millet being their staple crops. Peanuts, sweet potatoes, maize, and beans are also grown. Chickens, herds of cattle, and flocks of sheep and goats are kept. Goats and cattle provide milk as a food source, which is used directly and processed for cheese and other products. This livestock, such as goats and cattle, are very important as a marker of wealth and because they serve as bride-price payments. The boy's family gives animals to the girl's family before the marriage takes place. These animals are also used as a means of economic exchange.

Among the Yalunka, herding is done by the children. The women milk the cattle, churn the butter, and help the men in some of the agricultural work. Honey is another important commodity among the Yalunka. The people suspend large, water-tight baskets in trees. The bees use the baskets as hives and make honey in them. Every year, between four and six gallons of honey may be gathered from each basket.

==Notable Yalunka==
*[[Manga Sewa]], was a great Yalunka chief in Northern Sierra Leone.
