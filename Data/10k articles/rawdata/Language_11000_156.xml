      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32330">'''''A la carte'' [[pay television]]''' (from the French ''[[à la carte]]'', "from the menu"), also referred to as '''pick-and-pay''',&lt;ref name="cbc-pickandplaymandate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/pick-and-pay-tv-consumer-choice-but-at-what-cost-1.3002418|title=CRTC rules cable companies must offer pick-and-pay channels, $25 basic package|date=March 19, 2015|website=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a pricing model for [[multichannel video programming distributor|pay television services]] in which customers subscribe to individual [[cable network|television channels]]. For subscription distribution services, a la carte pricing contrasts with the prevailing model of [[Product bundling|bundling]], in which channels are grouped into packages that are offered on an all-or-nothing basis. The term has subsequently been applied to [[cord cutting]]—the practice of relying on television services that are [[Internet television|streamed]] over the internet.

== Distribution ==
A la carte pricing has been an often-requested but seldom-delivered option for cable and satellite distribution services. In the U.S., proponents have argued that the model would deliver lower prices, while opponents maintain that bundling offers more customer value and program diversity.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, a la carte service has been required by law since December 2016.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/lazarus/la-fi-lazarus-canada-a-la-carte-tv-20161209-story.html|title=High channel prices overshadow arrival of a la carte TV in Canada|last=Lazarus|first=David|date=|website=Los Angeles Times|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/pick-and-pay-tv-crtc-1.3875187|title=Pick and pay TV is here, but at current prices, it might not be worth it|last=Harris|first=Sophia|date=December 1, 2016|work=|newspaper=CBC Radio Canada|access-date=2016-12-10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The legislation dates back to at least 2012 when the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) ruled that consumers should be able to subscribe to individual channels, but the fewer channels purchased, the higher the cost for each one. No timeline was set.&lt;ref name="Globe&amp;Mail CRTC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/crtc-gives-consumers-single-channel-option-for-tv/article4429819|title=CRTC gives TV subscribers more control, with a catc|date=July 20, 2012|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|author=Steve Ladurantaye|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, Industry Minister [[James Moore (Canadian politician)|James Moore]] said that Canadians "shouldn't have to pay for bundled television channels they don't watch" and indicated that the country's Conservative government would make it easier for subscribers to purchase channels individually.&lt;ref name="Reuters: Canadian govt to push"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/13/canada-politics-idUSL1N0I30BW20131013|title=Canadian gov't to push cable providers to unbundle channels|date=October 13, 2013|agency=Reuters|accessdate=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 1, 2016, as per policy implemented by the CRTC on March 19, 2015, all television providers in Canada were required to offer an a la carte scheme.&lt;ref name="cbc-pickandplaymandate" /&gt; Channels were typically priced  between $4 and $7, making bundled packages the better deal for all but the most frugal subscribers. Consumers were incredulous about the offerings, but analysts were not surprised, arguing that the industry would be expected to protect its bottom line. While the CRTC required a basic offering of local television services and mandated channels costing $25 or less, it did not regulate the pricing of individual stations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, the precedent for distributors bundling channels, rather than offering them a la carte, began shortly after passage of the [[Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992]], which enabled broadcasters to seek [[retransmission consent|compensation from distributors]] in exchange for retransmitting a signal. Larger broadcasters negotiated not for higher fees, but for inclusion of their newer, lesser known, non-terrestrial channels. [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], for example, obtained distribution for [[FX (TV channel)|FX]]; [[NBC]] for [[CNBC]].&lt;ref name="McMurria"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://faculty.fordham.edu/andersen/hypercommercialism.pdf|title=Battleground: The Media|author=John McMurria|first=|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-313-34167-0|editor1=Robin Andersen|volume=1|location=Westport, Connecticut|pages=69–76|chapter=Cable Carriage Disputes|editor2=Jonathan Grey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FCC Guide"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cable Carriage of Broadcast Stations|url=http://www.fcc.gov/guides/cable-carriage-broadcast-stations|work=Guides|publisher=Federal Communications Commission|accessdate=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, bundling has not been just a marketing choice for distributors, but a contractual obligation.&lt;ref name="NPR: history of cable bill"&gt;{{cite news|title=Episode 488: The Secret History Of Your Cable Bill|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/09/27/226891181/episode-488-the-secret-history-of-your-cable-bill|website=[[NPR]] (Planet Money)|date=September 27, 2013|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry resistance to a la carte programming in the U.S. has been entrenched even during downturns. In 2011, for example, a combined loss of 1.2 million subscribers to [[Comcast]] and [[Time Warner Cable]] prompted rumors that program distributors themselves would push to unbundle at least some of their services. Cable analyst Craig Moffett argued that a modified a la carte model, consisting of smaller programming tiers, was more economically feasible for distributors and customers alike. At the time, Time Warner Cable experimented with such an offering in a limited trial, called TV Essentials.&lt;ref name="Reuters cable ops push"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/27/us-cable-idUSTRE78Q6EE20110927|title=In switch, cable operators want to go "a la carte"|date=September 27, 2011|agency=[[Reuters]]|author=Yinka Adegoke|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SmartMoney Cheap TV"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smartmoney.com/spend/technology/cable-tv-on-the-cheap-1327615829053/|title=Cable TV on the Cheap|date=January 27, 2012|author=Kelli B.

==== The debate ====

===== Support =====
The case for a la carte has centered on cost savings for subscribers. In 2006, [[Kevin Martin (FCC)|Kevin Martin]], then chairman of the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) and one of the best known advocates for the pricing scheme, presented a report to [[United States Congress|Congress]] arguing that, on average, consumers would save 13% on their monthly cable subscription rates if they were able to subscribe only to channels that they actually watched.&lt;ref name="USAToday push for a la arte"&gt;{{cite news|title=Push for 'a la carte' cable picks up steam|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/media/2006-02-12-martin-usat_x.htm|author=Leslie Cauley|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=February 12, 2006|accessdate=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, U.S. Senator [[John McCain]] introduced legislation that would have encouraged, through regulatory incentives, programmers and distributors to offer a la carte services. He cited an FCC survey finding that the cost of expanded basic cable has effectively risen from about US$25 a month in 1995 to over $54, greatly exceeding inflation. As predicted at the time by observers and McCain himself, the legislation did not pass.&lt;ref name="Nowicki-McCain bill"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/05/20/mccain-revives-a-la-carte-cable-bill/2325953/|title=McCain bill would create 'a la carte' cable pricing|date=May 20, 2013|publisher=Gannett Company|newspaper=USA Today|author=Dan Nowicki|accessdate=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCain PressRel"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Senator John McCain Introduces New "A La Carte" Cable Bill|date=May 9, 2013|url=http://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressOffice.PressReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=8a5d2818-ac05-71a2-5eae-5b58400e0019&amp;Region_id=&amp;Issue_id=6f4c5955-818b-4157-bc80-3b4bef26f7ab|website=U.S. Senator John McCain|accessdate=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Opposition =====
Opposition to a la carte programming has centered in part on program diversity. When channels are bundled into large subscription tiers, less popular niche channels are more likely to survive because their cost is borne by both viewers and non-viewers, alike.&lt;ref name="NYT 2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/09/business/09cnd-cable.htm|title=F.C.C. Supports à la Carte Cable Option|date=February 9, 2006|publisher=The New York Times Company|newspaper=The New York Times|author=Ken Belson|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP Industry opposed"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,186010,00.html|title=TV Industry Fiercely Opposed to A la Carte Channel Offering|date=February 25, 2006|agency=[[Associated Press]]|website=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the [[National Congress of Black Women]] and fourteen other groups argued that case in a letter to the FCC, writing that a la carte pricing would "wreak havoc" on programming diversity.&lt;ref name="Reuters Minorities oppose"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/05/31/television-programmers-fcc-dc-idUSN2931374420080531|title=US minority groups oppose FCC "a la carte" proposal|date=May 30, 2008|agency=Reuters|author=Peter Kaplan|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Televangelist]] [[Jerry Falwell]] opposed a la carte pricing for similar reasons, fearing that the pricing model would force [[religious broadcasting|Christian broadcasters]] off the air, although not all religious broadcasters agreed.&lt;ref name="B&amp;C Falwell"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/108910-Controversial_TV_Preacher_Jerry_Falwell_Dies.php|title=Controversial TV Preacher Jerry Falwell Dies|date=May 12, 2007|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|author=John Eggerton|periodical=[[Broadcasting and Cable]]|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A la carte opponents have also cited economics, arguing that the perceived cost savings of a la carte pricing would be illusory for most subscribers and dramatically reduce revenues for programmers. A December 2013 analysis of the U.S. market by [[investment bank]] and [[asset management]] firm [[Needham &amp; Company]] concluded an a la carte scheme would cut $80 billion to $113 billion of consumer value from the industry, cost at least $45 billion in advertising, and eliminate at least 124 channels and some 1.4 million media-related jobs. The firm based its estimates on the assumption that the average annual operating cost of an entertainment cable channel is $280 million, which would require at least 165,000 viewers to break even. Based on 2012 viewership, that would leave about 56 channels standing. Analyst Laura Martin recommended that the current business model of bundled tiered subscriptions be kept with no changes.&lt;ref name="Needham: Future of TV study"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assets.fiercemarkets.com/public/sites/cable/futuretv.pdf|title=The Future of TV|author=Laura Martin|author2=Dan Medina|publisher=[[Needham &amp; Company]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102031417/http://assets.fiercemarkets.com/public/sites/cable/futuretv.pdf|archivedate=November 2, 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=October 25, 2013|periodical=Needham Insights}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Times 2013 Needham Report"&gt;{{cite news|title=A la carte TV pricing would cost industry billions, report says|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-a-la-carte-pricing-would-cost-billions-of-dollars-20131204,0,4355658.story|author=Meg James|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a May 2014 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' column, [[Josh Barro]] pointed to academic research concluding that an a la carte system would not benefit customers. A typical subscriber, he wrote, would pay "''slightly more'' on cable under an unbundled system, while watching slightly fewer channels." A 2011 [[Stanford University]] study cited by Barro simulated a 49-channel subscription bundle being switched to an la carte scheme. The researchers concluded that subscribers would pay 103.0% more in fees passed on by distributors, while [[Welfare economics|consumer welfare]] would likely be worse, changing between -5.4% and 0.2%.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 2011|title=The Welfare Effects of Bundling in Multichannel Television Markets|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~ayurukog/bundling_welfare.pdf|publisher=Stanford University|author=Gregory S. Crawford|author2=Ali Yurukoglu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the reason is efficiency: some distribution costs are fixed whether a distributor provides a few channels or many. If fewer people subscribe, the base subscription rate is likely to go up. In addition, programmers would receive less revenue in carriage fees and advertising revenues, and would look to its remaining viewers to make up the difference. However, some subscribers would benefit from a la carte, including those who have opted out of bundled channels, but might subscribe to just a few, as well as subscribers with no interest in sports. Casual sports fans, on the other hand, could pay a higher rate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Unbundling Cable Would Not Save You Money|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/15/upshot/why-unbundling-cable-would-not-save-you-money.html|author=Josh Barro|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=May 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Sports programming =====
By 2013, the outsized cost of sports programming paid by distributors and passed on to subscribers had influenced the debate. The Needham study maintained that the creation of a separate sports tier would reduce industry revenues by $13 billion.&lt;ref name="Needham: Future of TV study"/&gt; Cable pioneer [[John C. Malone]] stated that, for subscribers uninterested in television sports, "runaway sports rights" costs amounted to "a high tax".&lt;ref name="NYT rising sports fees"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rising TV Fees Mean All Viewers Pay to Keep Sports Fans Happy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/business/media/all-viewers-pay-to-keep-tv-sports-fans-happy.html|author=Brian Stelter|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=January 25, 2013|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most pronounced example was the national sports network [[ESPN]], whose monthly per-subscriber fee charged  to distributors in 2013 averaged $5.54, more than four times that of the second most costly national network. According to a report in ''The New York Times'', many subscribers paid for ESPN through bundled subscriptions, but did not watch it. Of the 100 million households in the United States, just 1.36 million people viewed ESPN in [[prime time]] during the second quarter of 2013. ESPN and its majority parent, [[The Walt Disney Company]], called bundling a great value and a force for program diversity, and argued that without bundling, ESPN's monthly fee would rise to $15.&lt;ref name="NYT ESPN"&gt;{{cite news|title=To Protect Its Empire, ESPN Stays on Offense|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/sports/ncaafootball/to-defend-its-empire-espn-stays-on-offensive.html|author=[[Richard Sandomir]]|author2=James Andrew Miller|author3=Steve Eder|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=August 26, 2013|accessdate=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But fortunes subsequently changed for the network, which lost 10 million subscribers. The network went through two rounds of lay-offs, including some 50 broadcasters in April 2017.  Analysts saw those moves as part of a shift in how ESPN distributes its programming, including the expected launch of a subscription [[Over-the-top content|streaming service:]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/sports/espn-layoffs.html|title=A Struggling ESPN Lays Off Many On-Air Personalities|last=Drape|first=Joe|date=2017-04-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-26|last2=Barnes|first2=Brooks|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; the functional equivalent of an a la carte channel.

[[Regional sports network]]s sold as part of bundled tiers were also a source of controversy. A notable example was Time Warner Cable's agreement to pay the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] $8.35 billion over 25 years to exclusively carry the team's games on a jointly owned television outlet, [[SportsNet LA]] (since renamed Spectrum SportsNet LA), with the intent of reselling rights to other regional distributors. The largest satellite provider, [[DirecTV]], offered to carry the channel on an la carte basis, arguing that SportsNet LA was most expensive of five regional sports networks and that a bundled offering would unfairly burden the company's subscribers. TWC responded that bundled sports channels were an industry standard, one that DirecTV itself adhered to in other markets.&lt;ref name="NYT rising sports fees" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DirecTV: Time Warner Cable Trying to Force Deal for Dodgers Cable Network|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/directv-time-warner-cable-trying-693895|author=Alex Ben Block|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Guggenheim Digital Media|date=April 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the end of the [[2017 Los Angeles Dodgers season|2017 season]], the dispute resulted in Dodgers game telecasts being unavailable to the majority of [[Southern California]] households for four consecutive seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-scully-dodgers-standoff-charter-20160902-snap-story.html|title=Fans may see Vin Scully games on KTLA, but a fix to the Dodgers TV standoff is nowhere in sight|last=James|first=Meg|date=September 6, 2016|website=Los Angeles Times|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
{{further|Television in India}}
In [[India]], [[terrestrial television|terrestrial]] and [[free-to-air]] television is free with no monthly payments, while [[cable television|cable]], [[Direct-broadcast satellite|direct to home]] (DTH) and [[IPTV]] require a monthly payment that varies depending on how many channels a subscriber chooses to pay for. Channels are sold in packages/bouquets/bundles or a la carte. All television service providers are required, by law, to provide a la carte selection of channels.

On September 3, 2007, the [[Telecom Regulatory Authority of India]] (TRAI) issued the Telecommunication (Broadcasting and Cable Services) Interconnection (Fourth Amendment) Regulation 2007, which went into law on December 1; the rules require all broadcasters to offer channels on an a la carte basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Broadcasters to give channels a la carte to DTH operators: Trai|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k7/sep/sep28.php|website=IndianTelevision.com|date=September 3, 2007|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Broadcasters must offer all channels|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/04/stories/2007090461131300.htm|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=September 4, 2007|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regulation states, "All broadcasters will compulsorily offer all their channels on a la carte basis to DTH operators. Additionally, they may also offer bouquets, but they will not compel any DTH operator to include the entire bouquet in any package being offered by DTH operators to their subscribers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DTH companies can pick channels of choice: TRAI |url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/001200709031641.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130629104908/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/001200709031641.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 29, 2013 |newspaper=The Hindu |date=September 3, 2007 |accessdate=May 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the regulation, only customers in areas covered by the [[conditional access]] system (CAS), and cable systems providing the services, had the option of choosing to buy only the channels they were interested in.

Like the earlier regulation concerning DTH operators, this order took effect on December 1, 2007. It also permitted packages to be offered along with a la carte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trai issues new tariff order, b'casters must offer channels a la carte to MSOs|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k7/oct/oct60.php|website=Indiantelevision.com|date=October 4, 2007|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/05/stories/2007100561011600.htm|title=TRAI announces new tariff for non-CAS areas|newspaper=The Hindu|date=2007-10-05|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TRAI challenged TDSAT's order in the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]], and stated in proceedings on July 22, 2010 that "in the [[Analog television|analog]], [[Cable converter box#Addressable cable box|non-addressable]] environment, the authority is of the view that a la carte should not be made mandatory at the wholesale level as technological constraints in any case make it impossible for the benefits of a la carte provisioning to be passed on to subscribers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trai wants to cap cable rate at Rs 250/month|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2010-07-22/news/27594209_1_la-carte-telecom-regulatory-authority-trai|author=Sanjay K Singh|website=India Times|date=July 22, 2010|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TRAI seeks SC nod to notify tariff order|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/trai-seeks-sc-nod-to-notify-tariff-order/742347/|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]|date=January 26, 2011|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TRAI ordered that pay television customers in India must be given a free choice of channels rather than be forced to choose package deals, enforcing a January 2011 deadline to implement the changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A la carte menu for DTH subscribers at Rs. 150|url=http://www.thehindu.com/business/article528738.ece|newspaper=The Hindu|date=July 22, 2010|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pick and pay DTH channels from September|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2010-07-23/news/27614290_1_tariff-order-dth-providers-broadcasters|newspaper=India Times|date=July 23, 2010|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order stated, "Every service provider providing broadcasting services or cable services to its subscribers using an [[Addressability|addressable system]] shall offer all pay channels to its subscribers on a la carte basis and shall specify the maximum retail price for each pay channel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DTH players told to offer pay channels on la carte basis|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/todays-paper/dth-players-told-to-offer-pay-channels-on-la-carte-basis/article999298.ece?ref=archive|website=The Hindu Business Line|date=July 23, 2010|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tata Sky]], [[Airtel digital TV]], [[Videocon d2h]], [[In Digital]] and [[Reliance Digital TV]] launched a la carte options in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Now Airtel Digital TV announces a la carte pricing|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k11/jan/jan119.php|website=IndianTelevision.com|date=January 18, 2011|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Videocon d2h offers channels a la carte|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k11/jan/jan161.php|website=IndianTelevision.com|date=January 22, 2011|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tata Sky allows subscribers to make their own packs|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k11/jan/jan54.php|website=IndianTelevision.com|date=January 10, 2011|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reliance Digital TV unveils a la carte menu|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k11/jan/jan171.php|website=IndianTelevision.com|date=January 24, 2011|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Streaming services==
While the discussion of "a la carte" services initially centered on cable and satellite services, the term has also been used in relation to [[cord cutting]]—the practice of using [[internet television]] services such as [[Amazon Video]] and [[Netflix]] as an alternative to traditional subscription television services. In this context, a la carte refers to a customer subscribing to individual services, as opposed to purchasing costlier bundles of service from a traditional television provider. To appeal to these customers and expand the availability of their content beyond "linear" television, broadcasters such as [[CBS]], [[HBO]], and [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] have launched streaming services, including [[CBS All Access]] and [[HBO Now]].  These services feature their networks' respective content [[Video on demand|on-demand]], and are purchased as a standalone service independent of television providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-sarandos-tca-netflix-20160117-story.html|title=It's still 'Netflix and no ratings' -- Ted Sarandos rejects a numbers 'arms race'|last=Villarreal|first=Yvonne|date=January 17, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/lazarus/la-fi-lazarus-disney-espn-streaming-20170811-story.html|title=Disney streaming venture could make bloated pay-TV bundles obsolete|last=Lazarus|first=David|date=August 11, 2017|work=latimes.com|access-date=2018-01-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Amazon Video added its own a la carte "Channels" platform to its service in 2015, which allows users to subscribe to third-party content services delivered on top of the base Amazon Prime service; by 2018, it offered 140 different services, including CBS All Access, Showtime, and [[Starz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/05/amazons-a-la-carte-tv-service-amazon-channels-adds-cbs-all-access/|title=Amazon’s a la carte TV service, Amazon Channels, adds CBS All Access|last=Perez|first=Sarah|date=January 5, 2018|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-01-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite having used the term "A la carte" in promotion, [[Sling TV]] is not a true a la carte television service, as it is still distributed in bundles, customers cannot pick and choose individual channels to include in their service or swap them out for different ones individually, and some packages are only available on specific service tiers. The service cited the practice of mandatory bundling by broadcasters as an influence on this policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techhive.com/article/3193702/streaming-services/sling-tv-misleads-cord-cutters-with-its-a-la-carte-marketing-push.html|title=Sling TV misleads cord cutters with its|work=TechHive|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7407">An '''abstract family of acceptors (AFA)''' is a grouping of generalized [[Finite state machine#Acceptors_and_recognizers|acceptors]]. Informally, an acceptor is a device with a finite state control, a finite number of input symbols, and an internal store with a read and write function. Each acceptor has a start state and a set of accepting states. The device reads a sequence of symbols, transitioning from state to state for each input symbol. If the device ends in an accepting state, the device is said to accept the sequence of symbols. A family of acceptors is a set of acceptors with the same type of internal store. The study of AFA is part of AFL ([[abstract family of languages|abstract families of languages]]) theory. &lt;ref name="Seymour"&gt;[[Seymour Ginsburg]], ''Algebraic and automata theoretic properties of formal languages'', North-Holland, 1975, {{ISBN|0-7204-2506-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal definitions==

===AFA Schema===
An ''AFA Schema'' is an ordered 4-tuple &lt;math&gt;(\Gamma, I, f, g)&lt;/math&gt;, where
# &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are nonempty abstract sets.
# &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the ''write'' function: &lt;math&gt;f : \Gamma^* \times I \rightarrow \Gamma^* \cup \{\empty\}&lt;/math&gt; (N.B. * is the [[Kleene star]] operation).
# &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the ''read'' function, a mapping from &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^*&lt;/math&gt; into the finite subsets of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^*&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;g (\epsilon) = \{ \epsilon \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;g(\gamma)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\gamma = \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. (N.B. &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the empty word).
# For each &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;g(\Gamma^*)&lt;/math&gt;, there is an element &lt;math&gt;1_\gamma&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;f(\gamma', 1_\gamma) = \gamma'&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\gamma'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;g(\gamma')&lt;/math&gt;.
# For each ''u'' in ''I'', there exists a finite set &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_u&lt;/math&gt;  ⊆ &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, such that if &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_1&lt;/math&gt;  ⊆ &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_1^*&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f(\gamma,u) \ne \empty&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(\gamma,u)&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;(\Gamma_1 \cup \Gamma_u)^*&lt;/math&gt;.

===Abstract family of acceptors===
An ''abstract family of acceptors (AFA)'' is an ordered pair &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt; such that:
#&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is an ordered 6-tuple (&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;), where
## (&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;) is an AFA schema; and
## &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; are infinite abstract sets
#&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the family of all acceptors &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; = (&lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;), where
##&lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt;  are finite subsets of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; respectively, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; ⊆ &lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt;; and
##&lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; (called the ''transition'' function) is a mapping from &lt;math&gt;K_1 \times  (\Sigma_1 \cup \{ \epsilon \}) \times g(\Gamma^*)&lt;/math&gt; into the finite subsets of &lt;math&gt;K_1 \times I&lt;/math&gt; such that the set &lt;math&gt;G_D = \{ \gamma &lt;/math&gt; | &lt;math&gt;\delta(q,a,\gamma) &lt;/math&gt; ≠ ø for some &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a \}&lt;/math&gt; is finite.


For a given acceptor, let &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; be the relation on &lt;math&gt;K_1 \times  \Sigma_1^* \times \Gamma^*&lt;/math&gt; defined by: For &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1 \cup \{ \epsilon \}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(p,aw,\gamma) \vdash (p',w,\gamma')&lt;/math&gt; if there exists a &lt;math&gt;\overline{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\overline{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;g(\gamma)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(p',u)&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\delta(p,a,\overline{\gamma})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(\gamma,u)=\gamma'&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\vdash^*&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[transitive closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt;.


Let &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt; be an AFA and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; = (&lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;) be in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;. Define &lt;math&gt;L(D)&lt;/math&gt; to be the set &lt;math&gt;\{ w \in \Sigma_1^* | \exists q \in F . (q_0,w,\epsilon) \vdash^* (q,\epsilon,\epsilon)\}&lt;/math&gt;. For each subset &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{E}) = \{L(D) | D \in \mathcal{E} \}&lt;/math&gt;.


Define &lt;math&gt;L_f(D)&lt;/math&gt; to be the set &lt;math&gt;\{ w \in \Sigma_1^* | \exists(q \in F)\exists(\gamma \in \Gamma^*) . (q_0,w,\epsilon) \vdash^* (q,\epsilon,\gamma)\}&lt;/math&gt;. For each subset &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_f(\mathcal{E}) = \{L_f(D) | D \in \mathcal{E} \}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Informal discussion==

===AFA Schema===
An AFA schema defines a store or memory with read and write function. The symbols in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; are called ''storage symbols'' and the symbols in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are called ''instructions''. The write function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; returns a new storage state given the current storage state and an instruction. The read function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; returns the current state of memory. Condition (3) insures the empty storage configuration is distinct from other configurations. Condition (4)  requires there be an identity instruction that allows the state of memory to remain unchanged while the acceptor changes state or advances the input. Condition (5) assures that the set of storage symbols for any given acceptor is finite.

===Abstract family of acceptors===
An AFA is the set of all acceptors over a given pair of state and input alphabets which have the same storage mechanism defined by a given AFA schema. The &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; relation defines one step in the operation of an acceptor.  &lt;math&gt;L_f(D)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of words accepted by acceptor &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; by having the acceptor enter an accepting state. &lt;math&gt;L(D)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of words accepted by acceptor &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; by having the acceptor simultaneously enter an accepting state and having an empty storage.

The abstract acceptors defined by AFA are generalizations of other types of acceptors (e.g. [[finite state automata]], [[pushdown automata]], etc.). They have a finite state control like other automata, but their internal storage may vary widely from the stacks and tapes used in classical automata.

==Results from AFL theory==
The main result from AFL theory is that a family of languages &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is a full AFL if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt; for some AFA &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt;.  Equally important is the result that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is a full semi-AFL if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_f(\mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt; for some AFA &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt;.

==Origins==

[[Seymour Ginsburg]] of the [[University of Southern California]] and [[Sheila Greibach]] of [[Harvard University]] first presented their AFL theory paper at the [[IEEE]] Eighth Annual Symposium on Switching and Automata Theory in 1967.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2891921 IEEE conference record of 1967 Eighth Annual Symposium on Switching and Automata Theory] : papers presented at the Eighth Annual Symposium, University of Texas, October 18-20, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Academia Brasileira de Letras''' ('''ABL''') ({{IPA-pt|akadeˈmiɐ bɾaziˈlejɾɐ dʒi ˈletɾɐs|-|Br-AcademiaBrasileiraDeLetras.ogg}} [[English language|English]]: ''Brazilian Academy of Letters'') is a [[Brazil]]ian [[literature|literary]] non-profit society established at the end of the 19th century by a group of 40 writers and [[poet]]s inspired by the [[Académie Française]]. The first president, [[Machado de Assis]], declared its foundation on December 15, 1896, with the by-laws being passed on January 28, 1897. On July 20 of the same year, the academy entered into operation.

The Brazilian Academy of Letters is, according to its statutes, charged with the care of the "national language" of Brazil (the [[Portuguese language]]) and with the promotion of Brazilian literary arts. The academy is considered the foremost institution devoted to the Portuguese language in Brazil. Although it is not a state institution and no law grants to it oversight over the language, by its prestige and technical qualification it is the paramount authority on [[Brazilian Portuguese]]. The academy's main publication in this field is the Orthographic Vocabulary of the Portuguese Language (''Vocabulário Ortográfico da Língua Portuguesa'') of which there were five editions. The ''Vocabulary'' is prepared by the academy's Commission on Lexicology and Lexicography. If a word is not included in the ''Vocabulary'', it is considered not to exist as a correct word in Brazilian Portuguese.

The academy is composed to this day of 40 members, known as "immortals", chosen from among the citizens of Brazil, who have published recognized works or books of literary value. The position of "immortal" is awarded for the recipient's lifetime. New members are admitted by a vote of the academy members when one of the "chairs" become vacant. The chairs are numbered and each has a Patron: the Patrons are 40 great Brazilian writers that were already dead when the academy was founded; the names of the Patrons were chosen by the Founders and they were honored ''post mortem'' by each being assigned patronage over a chair. Thus, each of the 40 chairs is associated with its current holder, with the predecessors of the current holder who occupied it before him, and, in particular, with the Founder who occupied it first, but also  with the seat's Patron.

The academicians use formal gala gilded uniforms with a sword (the uniform is called "fardão") when participating in official meetings of the academy.

==History==
[[File:Lucio de Mendonça (Iconográfico).jpg|thumb|[[:pt:Lúcio de Mendonça|Lúcio de Mendonça]], founder of the academy.]]

===Foundation===
The initiative was taken by [[:pt:Lúcio de Mendonça|Lúcio de Mendonça]], concretized in preparatory meetings that began on 15 December 1896 under the  presidency of [[Machado de Assis]] (elected by acclamation) in the writing of the ''Brazilian Journal''. At these meetings, the statutes of the Brazilian Academy of Letters were approved on 28 January 1897, and its membership of forty founding members was approved. On 20 July of that year, the inaugural session was held at the ''Pedagogium'''s facility in the center of [[Rio de Janeiro]].

Without having their own headquarters or financial resources, the meetings of the academy were held in the premises of the former National Gymnasium, in the Noble Hall of the Ministry of the Interior, in the hall of the [[Royal Portuguese Cabinet of Reading]], especially for the solemn sessions. The joint sessions were held at the First Secretary's law office, Rodrigo Octávio, at Quitanda Street, 47.

From 1904, the academy obtained the left wing of the Brazilian Silogeo, a governmental building that housed other cultural institutions, where it remained until the conquest of its own headquarters.

===Petit Trianon===
[[File:Academia brasileira de letras 1.JPG|thumb|left|The ''Petit Trianon'' in Rio de Janeiro, seat of the academy since 1923.]]
In 1923, thanks to the initiative of its president at the time, [[Afrânio Peixoto]] and the French ambassador, Raymond Conty, the [[Third French Republic|French government]] donated to the academy the building of the French Pavilion, built for the [[Independence Centenary International Exposition|Independence of Brazil's Centenary International Exposition]], a replica of the [[Petit Trianon]] of [[Versailles]], erected by the architect [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]], between 1762 and 1768.

These facilities have been registered by the State Institute of Cultural Heritage (INEPAC), of the Municipal Secretary of Culture of Rio de Janeiro, since 9 November 1987. Its halls continue to the present day hosting regular meetings, solemn sessions commemorative meetings, the inauguration sessions of the new academics, as well as the traditional tea on Thursdays. They can be known by the public on guided tours or on cultural programs such as chamber music concerts, member book launches, conference cycles and plays.

On the first floor of the building, in the Hall, stands the decorated marble floor, a French crystal [[chandelier]], a large white porcelain vase from [[Sèvres]] and four English bas-reliefs. Among other dependencies, the following stand out:

*the Noble Hall, where the solemn sessions take place;
*the French Hall, where the new member, traditionally, remains alone, in reflection;
*the [[Francisco Alves]] Room, where an oil painting on canvas by Rodolfo Amoedo is depicted, depicting a collective of nineteenth-century writers and intellectuals;
*the Hall of the Founders, decorated with period furniture and paintings by [[Candido Portinari]];
*the [[Machado de Assis]] Room, decorated with the writer's desk, books and personal belongings, with emphasis on a portrait of him, by Henrique Bernardelli;
*the Hall of [[Romantic Poets]] has the bronze busts of [[Castro Alves]], Fagundes Varela, Gonçalves Dias, [[Casimiro de Abreu]] and [[Álvares de Azevedo]], by Rodolfo Bernardelli.

On the second floor there is the Tea Room, where the academics meet, on Thursdays, before the Plenary Session, the Sessions Room and the Library. The latter attends scholars and researchers, especially the collection of Manuel Bandeira.

===Dictatorships===
[[File:Posse de Getúlio Vargas como membro da Academia Brasileira de Letras.tif|thumb|The Dictator [[Getúlio Vargas]] being invested as member of the academy in 1943.]]
During periods like the [[Vargas Era|Vargas' totalitarian dictatorship]] or the [[Brazilian military government]], the academy's neutrality in choosing proper members dedicated to the literary profession was compromised{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} when it elected politicians with few or no contributions to literature, such as ex-president and dictator [[Getúlio Vargas]] in 1943. The academy, which was a purely male affair until the groundbreaking election of novelist [[Rachel de Queiroz]] in 1977 for chair No. 5, now has four women members (10% of its total membership), one of which, [[Nélida Piñon]], served as president in 1996–97.

===Nowadays===
[[File:Posse de Fernando Henrique Cardoso na Academia Brasileira de Letras.jpg|thumb|left|The writer [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]], ex-President of Brazil, taking possession as member of the academy in 2013.]]
The academy, thanks to revenues in excess of [[United States dollar|$]]4 million a year, is financially stable. It owns a skyscraper with 28 floors (''Palácio Austregésilo de Athaide''), in the center of Rio, which the academy rents for office space, generating 70% of its current revenue. The rest comes from rental of other buildings, which were legated by book editor [[Francisco Alves]], in 1917, and from financial investments. This comfortable situation allows for paying a "[[jeton]]" to each academician. The ABL is located just by its side, in a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] building, which is named "Petit Trianon". It was donated by the government of France in 1923 and is so named because it is a copy of the [[Petit Trianon]] palace in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], near [[Paris|Paris, France]].

It has recently&lt;!--meaning when?--&gt; inaugurated one of the largest [[public library|public libraries]] in Rio, with 90,000 volumes and a [[multimedia]] center.

The academy annually awards several literary prizes: the [[Prêmio Machado de Assis]] (the most important literature prize in the country, awarded for lifework), and the ABL prizes for poetry, for fiction and drama, for essays, critic and history of the literature, and for children's literature. Sometimes, an extraordinary commemorative prize is also awarded, such as the José Lins do Rego prize, in 2001, and the Afonso Arinos prize, in 2005.

The academy also publishes a literary periodical, the Brazilian Review (''Revista Brasileira''), with quarterly editions.

==Orthographic Vocabulary==
[[File:A Panelinha.jpg|thumb|Standing: Rodolfo Amoedo, Artur Azevedo, Sousa's English, Bilac, Veríssimo, Bandeira, Filinto de Almeida, Passos, Magalhães, Bernardelli, Rodrigo Octavio, Peixoto; seated: João Ribeiro, Machado, Lúcio de Mendonça and Silva Ramos.]]
The academy's main publication in this field is the ''Orthographic Vocabulary of the Portuguese Language'' (''Vocabulário Ortográfico da Língua Portuguesa'') of which there were five editions. The ''Vocabulary'' is prepared by the academy's Commission on Lexicology and Lexicography. If a word is not included in the ''Vocabulary'', it is considered not to exist as a correct word in Brazilian Portuguese.

The ''Orthographic Vocabulary'', however, is not a dictionary, as it contains words and their [[grammatical categories]], but not the definition or meaning of the words listed. Thus, unlike the French Academy, the Royal Spanish Academy and other foreign institutions dedicated with the care of a national language, the Brazilian Academy of Letters, until recently, published no official dictionary. Although it still stopped short of publishing a full official dictionary, the academy issued its first dictionary in 2009, the School Dictionary of the Portuguese Language (''Dicionário Escolar da Língua Portuguesa''), with students as its target customers.

The academy does plan to publish a full and official Dictionary of the Brazilian Academy of Letters in the future. For the time being, however, other dictionaries such as the ''Aurélio'' and the ''Houaiss'' remain more prestigious than the ''School Dictionary'', in spite of the fact that the latter is sometimes marketed by booksellers as the "ABL's Dictionary", due to its being authored by the academy. Both the ''Houaiss'' and the ''Aurélio'' Dictionaries, however, were first compiled by members of the academy (Antônio Houaiss and Aurélio Buarque de Holanda Ferreira, respectively) in their private capacities and as personal professional enterprises. The preparation of an official dictionary of the Portuguese language is a stated goal of the Brazilian Academy of Letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academia.org.br/abl/cgi/cgilua.exe/sys/start.htm?sid=537 |title=Língua portuguesa &amp;#124; Academia Brasileira de Letras |publisher=Academia.org.br |date= |accessdate=2015-08-01|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5841">''''AdZyklopädie'''' is a German coined word with the meaning [[encyclopedia]] for advertisements. The AdZyklopädie is a [[digital archive]] for advertising, independently storing old and current advertisements from different media on a large scale – advertisements from public or professional journals, newspapers, TV, cinema, posters/Out-of-Home, internet, Infoscreen, [[digital signage]], airport advertising, radio advertising.
       
== History ==
[[Advertisements]] in [[publications]] form a big part of [[advertising]] and are a [[cultural property]]. Advertisements are developed, designed and provided with text by creative people of advertising agencies, but they cannot be found in any state-archive. 
Until the end of 1990 in Germany only Stefan Rögener &lt;ref&gt;[http://typotalks.com/de/speakers/stefan-rögener] –  Stefan Rögener Type Speaker''&lt;/ref&gt; with his company AdFinder in Hamburg and Marien Riepelmeier &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adforum.com/talent/29268-maren-riepelmeier] – AdForum Riepelmeier &lt;/ref&gt; in connection with the [[BBDO]] Düsseldorf archived advertisements in an extensive way and offered them to advertising agencies for research, because for the creation of new advertising campaigns it is important to know former advertising for the same product by different providers and how competitors currently advertise the product.  
     
1998 the archive AdFinder rapidly became too small and Stefan Rögener and [[Peter Karow]] had the, at that time rakish, idea to digitalize advertisements and offer them via internet. This could do away with the limited space and guarantee great up-to-dateness and availability.  They found an innovative business management at the GWA  headquarter (German Association of Communication Agencies) and concluded a cooperation agreement about the future online use of the archive with the GWA. In the same year they founded the company AdVision digital GmbH in Hamburg. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advision-digital.de/] – Advison Hamburg &lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The AdZyklopädie provides advertising in printed media since 1947 and TV advertisements since 1970. It is almost not possible to explore the history of advertising beyond 1947, because there are no generally available digital collections. Now, at the beginning of 2017, the archive contains more than 6.5 million [[advertising campaigns]] and the 50 employees of AdVision regularly archive about 1,500 national and international titles from public and professional journals, 100 daily newspapers and 75 TV stations – approximately 70,000 advertising campaigns per month. So the AdZyklopädie is the biggest archive for advertising campaigns in Germany. Thanks to the huge amount of stored criteria nowadays it is even possible to explore the relative importance of a campaign according to different criteria like diversification, effects, costs and media.
&lt;ref&gt;w&amp;v; Article: Spots aus dem Web; Verlag Werben &amp; Verkaufen GmbH; Munich 3/2004&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;w&amp;v; Article: Das Gedächtnis der Werbung; Verlag Werben &amp; Verkaufen GmbH; Munich 8/2005&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;w&amp;v; Article: Schatztruhe der TV-Werbung; Verlag Werben &amp; Verkaufen GmbH; Munich 9/2007&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Handelsblatt article: Alle sollen drankommen; Verlag Handelsblatt GmbH; Duesseldorf 3/2009&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Red Box, Food &amp; Drink; article: Advision startet internationalen Service; Verlag New Business GmbH &amp; Co; Hamburg 4/2009&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;w&amp;v; Article: Adzyklopädie wächst; Verlag Werben &amp; Verkaufen GmbH; Munich 6/2011&lt;/ref&gt;
The online archive is especially available to advertising agencies and advertisers via a research subscription. For competition monitoring the AdZyklopädie especially allows ''investigating media and schematic plans'' as well as ''spendings'' of individual companies or branches.

== Search criteria ==
For each advertising campaign the following search criteria are stored:; 

'''branch, segment, product group, company, brand, product, date, type of media, medium, advertising expenses, design code, credits, slogans/claims, full-text'''

The '''design code''' permits to categorize (category, aspect, element) 700 creative aspects or aspects regarding content and supplement them with details worth knowing like ADC ([[Art Directors Club]]) Awards, [[Cannes Lions]] or [[Clio Awards]]. Design code categories are architecture, food/drinks, objects, geography, culture/art, landscape, people, plants/animals, sports/free time, textures/typography. 
   
The ''credits'' contain the doers behind the advertising campaigns like director, consultant, film production, cameraman, etc.   

[[Slogan]]s/Claims are separately stored in the field of print advertisements.

Furthermore, the continuous text of print advertisements is archived for [[full-text search]]. Editorial texts of journals and newspapers are read and searched by the frequency of special product denominations. [[Narrative|Storyline]]s are stored for a selection of TV and radio spots. 

== Reception in science and teaching ==
Students and teachers of graphic design can use the data free of charge, but have to register with AdVision. The contents of the AdZyklopädie are also used by professors for graphic design in scientific thesis.

'''Away from keyboard''' ('''AFK''') is a colloquialization used in many online communities such as chatrooms and gaming environments to denote the fact that a player has stepped away from their device, and will be unreachable until they return.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/17509/away-from-keyboard-afk|title=What is Away From Keyboard (AFK)?|publisher=techopedia|year=2018|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often encountered in servers and [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|multiplayer games]], and can be observed when a player's [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] is standing idle, without any input from the player. Such players are often removed from the server as to reduce server [[lag]]. [[Minecraft]] servers, for instance, will remove AFK players automatically.

In gaming, AFK players are sometimes punished not only by being kicked from the server, but also by having his/her credit score reduced. If his/her credit score is lower than the required minimum score to play in certain modes such as ranked play, he/she will be banned in that game mode. This is done to prevent players from being AFK in competitive matches where server speed can hinder performance drastically. "Downsides to online connections include increased difficulty detecting [[Cheating in online games|cheating]] compared to physical events, and greater [[Latency (engineering)|network latency]], which can negatively impact players' performance, especially at high levels of competition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Esports|date=2018-10-26|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Esports&amp;oldid=865868488|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Berliner Synchron GmbH (BSG)''' (formerly Berliner Synchron AG) is the largest and one of the oldest German post-production dubbing companies. It was founded on 14 October 1949 by Wenzel Lüdecke and later managed by Lüdecke's son, Wolfram Lüdecke, who served as CEO from 1987 until 2016. Currently, the company is owned by S&amp;L Medien Gruppe (S&amp;L Media Group).

==History==
In 1949, [[Film producer]] Wenzel Lüdecke saw an increasing market for dubbed movies originating from outside Germany, and subsequently founded Berliner Synchron. Post [[World War II]], he was the only person to be granted permission by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] to produce [[German language|German]] dubbed versions of movies and TV series produced in the United States and UK. Business increased dramatically in the 1950s when television returned to the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], known also as West Germany prior to the [[German reunification|German reunification of 1990]].

Between the 60s and 80s, theatre popularity began to decline, whereas television popularity increased. With the introduction of magnetic tapes, this gave Lüdecke ample opportunity to take advantage of the surge in Hollywood success by producing German language versions of worldwide box-office hits.
In 1987, Lüdecke passed ownership of the company to his son, Wolfram. Wenzel then died two years later on 5 September 1989, having been responsible for the production of over 5000 movies and TV series during his time as owner.

The main building at the Lankwitzer Mühlenstraße (Lankwitzer Mill Road) was built in 1938 for the Air Force. After the Second World War, the building was used primarily by Mosaik, a production company. Wenzel Lüdecke rented the building and took over the entire complex in 1974.

In 1972, the Berliner Synchron worked with The Kirch Group to create a new company, Arena synchronous, which was managed until 1997 in the same building and mainly synchronized television series for the Kirch Group.

On 3 July 2006, BSG was converted from a [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]] into a [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]] (joint stock company). Ten years later, in 2016, this was reversed with a [[corporate spin-off|spin-off]], while the parent company was renamed to ''CINEMEDIA AG'' as part of insolvency proceedings. Berliner Synchron was then acquired by the ''S&amp;L Medien Gruppe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.kameramann.de/branche/sl-mediengruppe-uebernimmt-die-berliner-synchron-gmbh/|title=S&amp;L Mediengruppe übernimmt die Berliner Synchron GmbH|website=kameramann.de|language=de|date=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Filmography==
To date, Berliner Synchron have dubbed over 7000 movies and TV series into German, including productions such as [[The Third Man]], [[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]], [[The Godfather]], all the [[Star Wars]] films, [[Schindler's List]], [[Forrest Gump]], [[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]], [[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]], [[Shrek]] and [[Ice Age (franchise)|Ice Age]] . In the field of television, they have created German versions of [[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]] , [[The Cosby Show]] and [[Boston Public]].

==Awards==
* 2009: German Prize for dubbing production companies in the category Outstanding synchronized TV series for [[Extras (TV series)|Extras]].
* 2009: Liliput Prize for outstanding film dubbing and subtitling of the film [[Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis|Welcome to the Sticks]]

'''Casimiro José Marques de Abreu''' (January 4, 1839 – October 18, 1860) was a [[Brazil]]ian poet, novelist and playwright, adept of the "[[Ultra-Romanticism]]" movement. He is famous for the poem "Meus oito anos".

He is patron of the 6th chair of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]].

==Life==
Casimiro de Abreu was born on January 4, 1839, in the city of Barra de São João (renamed "Casimiro de Abreu" in his honor in 1925), to rich [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] farmers José Joaquim Marques de Abreu and Luísa Joaquina das Neves. He received only a basic education at Instituto Freeze, in [[Nova Friburgo]], where he met and befriended [[Pedro Luís Pereira de Sousa]]. Following orders of his father, he moved to [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1852 to dedicate himself to commerce, an activity which he hated.

With his father, he travelled to [[Portugal]] in 1853. There he began his literary career, writing for many newspapers (such as ''O Progresso'' and ''Ilustração Luso-Brasileira'') and collaborating with [[Alexandre Herculano]] and [[Luís Augusto Rebelo da Silva]], among others. During his stay in Portugal, he wrote his first works: the theater play ''[[Luís de Camões|Camões]] e o Jau'' (influenced by [[Almeida Garrett]]'s poem ''Camões''), the novel ''Carolina'', published under ''[[feuilleton]]'' form, and the first chapters of a novel which he would never finish: ''Camila''.

In 1857, he returned to Rio, where he became a collaborator for the newspapers ''A Marmota'', ''O Espelho'', ''Revista Popular'' and ''Correio Mercantil''. While working for the latter, he met [[Manuel Antônio de Almeida]] and [[Machado de Assis]].

In 1859, he published his most famous work, the poetry book ''As Primaveras'' (''Springtimes''). Its publication was financed by his father, although he disapproved Casimiro's literary vocation.

Suffering from [[tuberculosis]], Casimiro moved to [[Nova Friburgo]] in order to recover, but he died at age 21 on October 18, 1860.

==Works==
* ''Camões e o Jau'' (1856)
* ''Carolina'' (1856)
* ''Camila'' (unfinished novel — 1856)
* ''A Virgem Loura: Páginas do Coração'' (1857)
* ''[[As Primaveras]]'' (1859)

'''San Juan Quiahije Chatino Sign Language''' is an emerging [[village sign language]] of the indigenous [[Chatino people|Chatino]] villages of [[San Juan Quiahije]] and [[Cieneguilla, Mexico|Cieneguilla]] in [[Oaxaca]], Mexico, used by both the deaf and some of the hearing population.&lt;ref name="aj"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/4/17/inventing-a-language.html |title=
The Discovery of a New Language Can Help Explain How We Communicate |last=Erard |first=Michael |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is apparently unrelated to [[Mexican Sign Language]]. As of 2014, there is a [[National Science Foundation]]-funded study and also a National Institutes of Health-funded study of the development of this language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytexanonline.com/news/2014/02/26/deaf-researcher-studies-emergence-of-new-signed-language-in-mexico Deaf researcher studies emergence of new signed language in Mexico], ''The Daily Texan'', University of Texas at Austin, 2014 Feb 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-signing hearing people in the village use various gestures for negation when speaking, and these are retained in Chatino Sign Language.  The variability of these signs may be due to the small size of the deaf population in comparison to the number of hearing people who use them as co-speech gestures.&lt;ref name="Hou" /&gt;

In [[linguistics]], '''colloquialism''' is [[vernacular]] language including everyday language, everyday speech, common parlance, informal language, colloquial language, general parlance, and common expressions. It is the most used [[variety (linguistics)|linguistic variety]] of a [[language]], the language normally used in [[conversation]] and other informal [[communication]].

A specific instance of such language is called a ''colloquialism''. The most common term used in dictionaries to label such an expression is '''''colloquial'''''.

==Explanation==
General parlance is distinct from [[public speaking|formal speech]] or [[formal writing]].&lt;ref name="colloquial"&gt;colloquial. (n.d.) Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Retrieved September 10, 2008, from [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/colloquial Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the variety of language that speakers typically use when they are relaxed and not especially self-conscious.&lt;ref name="Trask"&gt;{{cite book|last=Trask|first=Robert |title=Key Concepts in Language and Linguistics|year=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-15742-1|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; An expression is labeled ''colloq.'' for "colloquial" in dictionaries when a different expression is more common in formal speech, but this does not mean that the colloquial expression is inappropriate in formal speech or writing or that it is necessarily slang. Many people{{who|date=July 2018}} misunderstand this very common dictionary label due to the widespread misconception that ''colloquial'' means "location" or a word being "regional". This is not the case; the word root for ''colloquial'' is related to locution, not location.{{cn|date=July 2018}} 

Some colloquial speech contains a great deal of [[slang]], but some contains no slang at all. Slang is permitted in colloquial language, but it is not a necessary element.&lt;ref name="Trask"/&gt; Other examples of colloquial usage in English include [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]]s or [[profanity]].&lt;ref name="Trask"/&gt;

In the [[philosophy of language]], "colloquial language" is ordinary [[natural language]], as distinct from specialized forms used in [[logic]] or other areas of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Donald |editor=Peter Ludlow |title=Readings in the Philosophy of Language |year=1997 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-62114-4 |pages=89–107 |chapter=Truth and meaning}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of [[logical atomism]], meaning is evaluated in a different way than with more formal [[proposition]]s.

A '''colloquial name''' or '''familiar name''' is a name or term commonly used to identify a person or thing in informal language, in place of another usually more formal or technical name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2014 |title =familiar, n., adj., and adv. |encyclopedia=OED Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/67957?rskey=s5GGov&amp;result=10&amp;isAdvanced=true |accessdate=2014-04-01 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinction from other styles ==
Colloquialisms are distinct from [[slang]] or [[jargon]]. Slang refers to words used only by specific social groups, such as teenagers or soldiers.&lt;ref name="Zuckermann"&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann]] |first=Ghil'ad |year=2003 |url=http://www.palgrave.com/br/book/9781403917232 |title=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |isbn=978-1403917232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colloquial language may include slang, but consists mostly of contractions or other informal words and phrases known to most native speakers of the language.&lt;ref name="Zuckermann"/&gt;

Jargon is terminology that is especially defined in relationship to a specific activity, profession, or group. The term refers to the language used by people who work in a particular area or who have a common interest. Much like slang, it is a kind of shorthand used to express ideas that are frequently discussed between members of a group, though it can also be developed deliberately using chosen terms.&lt;ref name="CB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=10866|  title=Buzzwords– bang * splat !| last=Lundin|first=Leigh| date=2009-12-31|  publisher=Criminal  Brief|work=Don Martin School of Software}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a standard term may be given a more precise or unique usage amongst practitioners of relevant disciplines, it is often reported that jargon is a barrier to communication for those people unfamiliar with the respective field.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6289">'''Conversational interfaces''' (CUI) are platforms that mimic a conversation with a real human. Historically, computers have relied on graphical user interfaces (GUI) such as the user pressing a “back” button to translate the user’s desired action into commands the computer understands. While an effective mechanism of completing computing actions, there is a learning curve for the user associated with GUI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Conversational Interfaces: Where Are We Today? Where Are We Heading? | website=Smashing Magazine | url=https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/conversational-interfaces-where-are-we-today-where-are-we-heading/ | ref={{sfnref | Smashing Magazine}} | access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Instead, CUI’s provide opportunity for the user to communicate with the computer in their natural language rather than in a syntax specific commands. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Brownlee | first=John | title=Conversational Interfaces, Explained | website=Co.Design | date=2016-04-04 | url=https://www.fastcodesign.com/3058546/conversational-interfaces-explained | ref=harv | access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To do this, conversational interfaces use [[Natural_language_processing|Natural Language Processing]] (NLP) to allow computers to understand, analyze and create meaning from human language. Unlike word processors, NLP considers the structure to human language (i.e. Words make a phrase, phrases make sentences which convey the idea or intent the user is trying to invoke). The ambiguous nature of human language makes it difficult for a machine to always correctly interpret the user’s requests, which is why we have seen a shift towards [[Natural_language_understanding|Natural Language Understanding]] (NLU)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Pan | first=Jiaqi | title=Conversational Interfaces: The Future of Chatbots – Chatbots Magazine | website=Chatbots Magazine | date=2017-08-25 | url=https://chatbotsmagazine.com/conversational-interfaces-the-future-of-chatbots-18975a91fe5a | ref=harv | access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

NLU allows for [[sentiment analysis]] and conversational searches which allows a line of questioning to continue, with the context carried throughout the conversation. NLU allows conversational interfaces to handle unstructured inputs that the human brain is able to understand such as spelling mistakes of follow-up questions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Lola | title=NLP vs. NLU: What’s the Difference? – Lola – Medium | website=Medium | date=2016-10-05 | url=https://medium.com/@lolatravel/nlp-vs-nlu-whats-the-difference-d91c06780992 | ref=harv | access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;.   For example, through leveraging NLU, a user could first ask for the population of the United States. If the user then asks “Who is the president”, the search will carry forward the context of the United States and provide the appropriate response.

Conversational interfaces have emerged as a tool for businesses to efficiently provide consumers with relevant information, in a cost effective manner. CUI provide ease of access to relevant, contextual information to the end user without the complexities and learning curve typically associated with technology.

While there are a variety of interface brands, to date, there are two main categories of conversational interfaces; [[Voice_command_device|voice assistants]] and [[Chatbot|chatbots]].

==Voice Assistants==

[[Voice assistant]]s are interfaces that allow a user to complete an action simply by speaking a command. Introduced in October 2011, Apple’s [[Siri]] was one of the first voice assistants widely adopted. Siri allowed users of iPhone to get information and complete actions on their device simply by asking Siri.
 
Further development has continued since Siri’s introduction to include home based devices such as [[Google_Home|Google Home]] or [[Amazon_Echo|Amazon Echo]] (powered by Alexa) that allow users to “connect” their homes through a series of smart devices to further the options of tangible actions they can complete. Users can now turn off the lights, set reminders and call their friends all with a verbal queue. 

These conversational interfaces that utilize a voice assistant have become an efficient and popular way for businesses to interact with their customers as the interface removes the typical friction in a customer journey. Customers no longer need to remember a long list of usernames and passwords to their various accounts; they simply link each account to Google or Amazon once, and gone are the days where you needed to wait on hold for an hour to ask a simple question. 

==Chatbots==

[[Chatbot]]s are web or mobile based interfaces that allow the user to ask questions and retrieve information. This information can be generic in nature such as the Google Assistant chat window that allows for internet searches, or it can be a specific brand or service which allows the user to gain information about the status of their various accounts. Their backend systems work in the same manner as a voice assistant, with the front end utilizing a visual interface to convey information. This visual interface can be beneficial for companies that need to do more complex business transactions with customers, as instructions, deep links and graphics can all be utilized to convey an answer. The complexity to which a chatbot answers questions depends on the development of the back end. Chatbots with hard-coded answers has a smaller base on information and corresponding skills. Chatbots that leverage machine learning will continue to grow and develop larger content bases for more complex responses &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Onlim | title=How do Chatbots Work? – Chatbots Life | website=Chatbots Life | date=2017-03-22 | url=https://chatbotslife.com/how-do-chatbots-work-fe49ef32598f | ref=harv | access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

More frequently, companies are leveraging chatbots as a way to offload simple questions and transactions from human agents. These chatbots provide the option to assist a user, but then directly transfer the customer to a live agent within the same chat window if the conversation becomes too complex.

'''Dhruv Bhatt''' ([[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]: ધ્રુવ ભટ્ટ) is a [[Gujarati language]] novelist and poet from [[Gujarat]], [[India]].

==Life==
Dhruv Bhatt was born on 8 May 1947 in Ningala village of [[Bhavnagar State]] (now [[Bhavnagar district]], Gujarat) to Prabodhray Bhatt and Harisuta Bhatt. He studied at various places, standard 1 to 4 at [[Jafrabad]] and Matriculation from [[Keshod]].

{{diacritical marks|á|caption=Letter a with diacritic acute}}

A '''diacritic''' – also '''diacritical mark''', '''diacritical point''', '''diacritical sign''', or '''accent''' – is a [[glyph]] added to a [[letter (alphabet)|letter]], or basic glyph. The term derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{wikt-lang|grc|διακριτικός}} (''diakritikós'', "distinguishing"), from {{lang|grc|διακρίνω}} (''diakrī́nō'', "to distinguish"). ''Diacritic'' is primarily an [[adjective]], though sometimes used as a [[noun]], whereas ''diacritical'' is only ever an adjective. Some diacritical marks, such as the [[acute accent|acute]] (&amp;thinsp;´&amp;thinsp;) and [[grave accent|grave]] (&amp;thinsp;`&amp;thinsp;), are often called ''accents''. Diacritical marks may appear above or below a letter, or in some other position such as within the letter or between two letters.

The main use of diacritical marks in the [[Latin script]] is to change the sound-values of the letters to which they are added. Examples are the [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaereses]] in the borrowed French words ''naïve'' and ''Noël'', which show that the vowel with the diaeresis mark is pronounced separately from the preceding [[vowel]]; the acute and grave accents, which can indicate that a final vowel is to be pronounced, as in ''[[saké]]'' and poetic ''breathèd''; and the [[cedilla]] under the "c" in the borrowed French word ''façade'', which shows it is pronounced {{IPAslink|s}} rather than {{IPAslink|k}}. In other [[Latin-script alphabet]]s, they may distinguish between [[homonym]]s, such as the [[French language|French]] ''là'' ("there") versus ''la'' ("the") that are both pronounced {{IPA|/la/}}. In [[Gaelic type]], a dot over a consonant indicates [[lenition]] of the consonant in question.

In other [[Alphabet#Types|alphabetic systems]], diacritical marks may perform other functions. [[Vowel pointing (disambiguation)|Vowel pointing]] systems, namely the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[Arabic diacritics|harakat]] (&amp;thinsp;{{lang|ar|ـِ&amp;nbsp;,ـُ&amp;nbsp;,ـَ,}}&amp;nbsp;etc.) and the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[niqqud]] (&amp;thinsp;{{lang|he|ַ◌, ֶ◌, ִ◌, ֹ◌, ֻ◌,}} etc.) systems, indicate vowels that are not conveyed by the basic alphabet. The [[Indic script|Indic]] [[virama]] (&amp;thinsp;् etc.) and the Arabic [[sukūn]] (&amp;thinsp;{{lang|ar|ـْـ|rtl=yes}}&amp;thinsp;) mark the absence of vowels. [[Cantillation mark]]s indicate [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]].  Other uses include the [[Early Cyrillic]] [[titlo]] stroke (&amp;thinsp;◌҃&amp;thinsp;) and the Hebrew [[gershayim]] (&amp;thinsp;{{lang|he|״|rtl=yes}}&amp;thinsp;), which, respectively, mark [[abbreviation]]s or [[acronym]]s, and Greek diacritical marks, which showed that letters of the alphabet were being used as [[Greek numerals|numerals]]. In the [[Pinyin|Hanyu Pinyin]] official romanization system for Chinese, diacritics are used to mark the [[Standard Chinese phonology#Tones|tones]] of the syllables in which the marked vowels occur.

In [[orthography]] and [[collation]], a letter modified by a diacritic may be treated either as a new, distinct letter or as a letter–diacritic combination. This varies from language to language, and may vary from case to case within a language. English is the only major modern [[Languages of Europe|European language]] requiring no diacritics for native words (although a [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] may be used  in words such as "coöperation").&lt;ref&gt;As an example, an article containing a [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] in "coöperate" and a [[cedilla]] in "façades" as well as a [[circumflex]] in the word "crêpe" ({{cite journal|first=Anthony |last=Grafton |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/10/23/061023crbo_books?currentPage=all |title=Books: The Nutty Professors, The history of academic charisma |date=2006-10-23|journal=[[The New Yorker]]}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216160024/http://dscriber.com/news/121-the-new-yorkers-odd-mark-the-diaeresis|title=The New Yorker's odd mark — the diaeresis|date=16 December 2010|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, letters are used as "in-line diacritics", with the same function as ancillary glyphs, in that they modify the sound of the letter preceding them, as in the case of the "h" in the English pronunciation of "sh" and "th".&lt;ref&gt;Henry Sweet (1877) ''A Handbook of Phonetics'', p 174–175: "Even letters with accents and diacritics [...] being only cast for a few founts, act practically as new letters. [...] We may consider the h in sh and th simply as a diacritic written for convenience on a line with the letter it modifies."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Among the types of diacritic used in alphabets based on the [[Latin script]] are:
* accents (so called because the acute, grave, and circumflex were originally used to indicate different types of [[pitch accent]]s in the [[polytonic transcription]] of [[Greek language|Greek]])
** '''◌́''' – [[acute accent|acute]] (Latin ''[[apex (diacritic)|apex]]'')
** '''◌̀''' – [[grave accent|grave]]
** '''◌̂''' – [[circumflex accent|circumflex]]
** '''◌̌''' – [[caron]], wedge (Czech ''háček'', Slovak ''mäkčeň'')
** '''◌̋''' – [[double acute accent|double acute]]
** '''◌̏''' – [[double grave accent|double grave]]
** '''◌̃''' - [[tilde]]
* dots
** '''◌̇''' – [[Dot (diacritic)|overdot]] (Indic ''[[anusvara]]'')
** '''◌̣''' – an [[Dot (diacritic)|underdot]] is used in [[Rheinische Dokumenta]] and in Hebrew, Indic and Arabic transcription
** ◌·◌ – [[interpunct]]
** [[tittle]], the superscript dot of the modern [[lowercase]] Latin ''i'' and ''j''
** '''◌̈''' – [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] or [[Umlaut (linguistics)|umlaut]]
** '''◌ː''' – [[colon (punctuation)|triangular colon]], used in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] to mark [[vowel length|long vowels]].
* curves
** '''◌̆''' – [[breve]]
** '''◌̑''' - [[inverted breve]]
** '''◌͗''' – [[sicilicus]], a [[Palaeography|palaeographic]] diacritic similar to a caron or breve
** '''◌̃''' – [[tilde]]
** '''◌҃''' – [[titlo]]
* vertical stroke
** '''◌̩''' – [[Syllabic consonant|syllabic]] a subscript vertical stroke is used in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] to mark syllabicity and in [[Rheinische Dokumenta]] to mark a [[schwa]]
* macron or horizontal line
** '''◌̄''' – [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]
** '''◌̱''' – [[Macron below|underbar]]
* overlays
** '''◌⃓''' – [[bar (diacritic)|vertical bar]] through the character
** '''◌̷''' – [[bar (diacritic)|slash]] through the character
** '''◌̵''' – [[bar (diacritic)|crossbar]] through the character
* ring
** '''◌̊''' – [[ring (diacritic)|overring]]
* superscript curls
** '''◌̓''' – [[apostrophe]]
** '''◌̉ ''' – [[hook above|hoi]] (Vietnamese ''dấu hỏi'')
** '''◌̛''' – [[horn (diacritic)|horn]] (Vietnamese ''dấu móc'')
* subscript curls
** '''◌̦''' – [[Comma#Diacritical usage|undercomma]]
** '''◌̧''' – [[cedilla]]
** '''◌̡ ◌̢''' – [[hook (diacritic)|hook]], left or right, sometimes superscript
** '''◌̨''' – [[ogonek]]
* double marks (over or under two base characters)
** '''◌͝◌''' – [[tie (typography)|double breve]]
** '''◌͡◌''' – [[tie (typography)|tie bar]] or top ligature
** '''◌᷍◌''' – double circumflex
** '''◌͞◌''' – longum
** '''◌͠◌''' – double tilde
* double sub/superscript diacritics
** '''◌̧ ̧''' - [[double cedilla]]
** '''◌̨ ̨''' - [[double cedilla|double ogonek]]
** '''◌̈ ̈''' - double diaeresis

The tilde, dot, comma, [[titlo]], apostrophe, bar, and colon are sometimes diacritical marks, but also have other uses.

Not all diacritics occur adjacent to the letter they modify. In the [[Wali language (Gur)|Wali language]] of Ghana, for example, an apostrophe indicates a change of vowel quality, but occurs at the beginning of the word, as in the dialects ''’Bulengee'' and ''’Dolimi''. Because of [[vowel harmony]], all vowels in a word are affected, so the scope of the diacritic is the entire word. In [[abugida]] scripts, like those used to write [[Hindi]] and [[Thai language|Thai]], diacritics indicate vowels, and may occur above, below, before, after, or around the consonant letter they modify.

The tittle (dot) on the letter ''i'' of the Latin alphabet originated as a diacritic to clearly distinguish ''i'' from the [[Minim (palaeography)|minims]] (downstrokes) of adjacent letters. It first appeared in the 11th century in the sequence ''ii'' (as in ''ingeníí)'', then spread to ''i'' adjacent to ''m, n, u'', and finally to all lowercase ''i'''s. The ''j'', originally a variant of ''i'', inherited the tittle. The shape of the diacritic developed from initially resembling today's acute accent to a long flourish by the 15th century. With the advent of [[Roman type]] it was reduced to the round dot we have today.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diacritics specific to non-Latin alphabets==

===Arabic===
{{further information|Arabic diacritics}}
* (ئ ؤ إ أ and stand alone ء) ''[[hamza]]'': indicates a [[glottal stop]].
* (ــًــٍــٌـ) ''tanwīn'' (تنوين) symbols: Serve a grammatical role in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. The sign ـً is most commonly written in combination with [[Aleph|alif]], e.g. ـًا.
* (ــّـ) ''[[shadda]]'': Gemination (doubling) of consonants.
* (ٱ) ''waṣla'': Comes most commonly at the beginning of a word. Indicates a type of [[hamza]] that is pronounced only when the letter is read at the beginning of the talk.
* (آ) ''madda'': A written replacement for a [[hamza]] that is followed by an alif, i.e. (ءا). Read as a glottal stop followed by a long {{IPA|/aː/}}, e.g. ءاداب، ءاية، قرءان، مرءاة are written out respectively as آداب، آية، قرآن، مرآة. This writing rule does not apply when the alif that follows a [[hamza]] is not a part of the stem of the word, e.g. نتوءات is not written out as نتوآت as the stem نتوء does not have an alif that follows its [[hamza]].
* (ــٰـ) ''superscript alif'' (also "short" or "dagger alif": A replacement for an original alif that is dropped in the writing out of some rare words, e.g. لاكن is not written out with the original alif found in the word pronunciation, instead it is written out as لٰكن.
* ''ḥarakāt'' (In Arabic: حركات also called تشكيل ''tashkīl''):
** (ــَـ) ''fatḥa'' (a)
** (ــِـ) ''kasra'' (i)
** (ــُـ) ''ḍamma'' (u)
** (ــْـ) ''sukūn'' (no vowel)
* The ''ḥarakāt'' or vowel points serve two purposes:
** They serve as a phonetic guide. They indicate the presence of short vowels ''(fatḥa, kasra, or ḍamma)'' or their absence ''(sukūn).''
** At the last letter of a word, the vowel point reflects the [[inflection]] case or conjugation mood.
*** For nouns, The ''ḍamma'' is for the nominative, ''fatḥa'' for the accusative, and ''kasra'' for the genitive.
*** For verbs, the ''ḍamma'' is for the imperfective, ''fatḥa'' for the perfective, and the ''sukūn'' is for verbs in the imperative or [[jussive]] moods.
* Vowel points or ''tashkīl'' should not be confused with consonant points or ''[[Arabic diacritics|iʿjam]]'' (إعجام) – one, two or three dots written above or below a consonant to distinguish between letters of the same or similar [[Rasm|form]].

===Greek===
{{further information|Greek diacritics}}

These diacritics are used in addition to the acute, grave, and circumflex accents and the diaeresis:
* {{lang|grc|'''◌ͺ''' ('''ᾳ''')}} – [[iota subscript]]
* {{lang|grc|'''῾◌'''}} – [[rough breathing]] (''spiritus asper''): aspiration
* {{lang|grc|'''᾿◌'''}} – [[smooth breathing|smooth (or soft) breathing]] (''spiritus lenis''): lack of aspiration

===Korean===
[[File:Hunmin jeong-eum.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Hunminjeongeum|Hangul]], the Korean alphabet]]
The diacritics '''&gt;〮''' and ''' 〯''' &amp;nbsp;, known as Bangjeom ({{lang|ko|방점;傍點}}), were used to mark pitch accents in [[Hangul]] for Middle Korean. They were written to the left of a syllable in vertical writing and above a syllable in horizontal writing.

The South Korean government officially revised the [[Revised Romanization of Korean|romanization of the Korean language]] in July 2000 to eliminate diacritics.

{{further information|Brahmic scripts}}

[[File:Devanagari matras.png|thumb|center|upright=3.4|Devanagari script's (from Brahmic family) compound letters, which are vowels combined with consonants, have diacritics. Here क is shown with vowel diacritics.]]

===Syriac===
{{further information|Syriac alphabet}}
* A dot above and a dot below a letter represent {{IPA|[a]}}, transliterated as ''a'' or ''ă'',
* Two diagonally-placed dots above a letter represent {{IPA|[ɑ]}}, transliterated as ''ā'' or ''â'' or ''å'',
* Two horizontally-placed dots below a letter represent {{IPA|[ɛ]}}, transliterated as ''e'' or ''ĕ''; often pronounced {{IPA|[ɪ]}} and transliterated as ''i'' in the [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|East Syriac dialect]],
* Two diagonally-placed dots below a letter represent {{IPA|[e]}}, transliterated as ''ē'',
* A dot underneath the ''Beth'' represent a soft {{IPA|[v]}} sound, transliterated as ''v''
* A tilde (~) placed under ''Gamel'' represent a {{IPA|[dʒ]}} sound, transliterated as ''j''
* The letter ''Waw'' with a dot below it represents {{IPA|[u]}}, transliterated as ''ū'' or ''u'',
* The letter ''Waw'' with a dot above it represents {{IPA|[o]}}, transliterated as ''ō'' or ''o'',
* The letter ''Yōḏ'' with a dot beneath it represents {{IPA|[i]}}, transliterated as ''ī'' or ''i'',
* A [[tilde]] (~) under ''Kaph'' represent a {{IPA|[t͡ʃ]}} sound, transliterated as ''ch'' or ''č'',
* A semicircle under ''Peh'' represents an {{IPA|[f]}} sound, transliterated as ''f'' or ''ph''.

In addition to the above vowel marks, transliteration of Syriac sometimes includes ''ə'', ''e̊'' or superscript ''&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;'' (or often nothing at all) to represent an original Aramaic [[schwa]] that became lost later on at some point in the development of Syriac.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eberhard Nestle|Nestle, Eberhard]] (1888). ''Syrische Grammatik mit Litteratur, Chrestomathie und Glossar''. Berlin: H. Reuther's Verlagsbuchhandlung. [translated to English as ''Syriac grammar with bibliography, chrestomathy and glossary'', by R. S. Kennedy. London: Williams &amp; Norgate 1889].&lt;/ref&gt; Some transliteration schemes find its inclusion necessary for showing spirantization or for historical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Coakley, J. F. (2002). ''Robinson's Paradigms and Exercises in Syriac Grammar'' (5th ed.). Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-926129-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michaelis, Ioannis Davidis (1784). ''Grammatica Syriaca''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-alphabetic scripts==
Some non-alphabetic scripts also employ symbols that function essentially as diacritics.
* Non-pure [[abjad]]s (such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Arabic]] script) and [[abugida]]s use diacritics for denoting [[vowel]]s. Hebrew and Arabic also indicate consonant doubling and change with diacritics; Hebrew and [[Devanagari]] use them for foreign sounds. Devanagari and related abugidas also use a diacritical mark called a ''[[virama]]'' to mark the absence of a vowel. In addition, Devanagari uses the moon-dot ''[[chandrabindu]]'' (''' ँ ''').
* [[Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics]] use several types of diacritics, including the diacritics with alphabetic properties known as Medials and Finals. Although long vowels originally were indicated with a negative line through the Syllabic glyphs, making the glyph appear broken, in the modern forms, a [[dot above]] is used to indicate vowel length. In some of the styles, a [[ring above]] indicates a long vowel with a [j] off-glide. Another diacritic, the "inner ring" is placed at the glyph's head to modify [p] to [f] and [t] to [θ]. Medials such as the "w-dot" placed next to the Syllabics glyph indicates a [w] being placed between the syllable onset consonant and the nucleus vowel. Finals indicate the syllable coda consonant; some of the syllable coda consonants in word medial positions, such as with the "h-tick", indicate the fortification of the consonant in the syllable following it.
* The Japanese ''[[hiragana]]'' and ''[[katakana]]'' [[syllabary|syllabaries]] use the [[dakuten|''dakuten'' (◌゛) and ''handakuten'' (◌゜)]] (in Japanese: 濁点 and 半濁点) symbols, also known as ''nigori'' (濁 "muddying") or ''ten-ten'' (点々 "dot dot") and ''maru'' (丸 "circle"), to indicate [[voiced consonant]]s or other phonetic changes.
* [[Emoticon]]s are commonly created with diacritic symbols, especially [[Japan]]ese emoticons on popular [[imageboards]].

==Alphabetization or collation==
{{main article|Collation}}
Different languages use different rules to put diacritic characters in [[alphabet]]ical order. French treats letters with diacritical marks the same as the underlying letter for purposes of ordering and dictionaries.

The [[Scandinavian languages]], by contrast, treat the characters with diacritics ''ä'', ''ö'' and ''å'' as new and separate letters of the alphabet, and sort them after ''z''. Usually ''ä'' is sorted as equal to ''æ'' (ash) and ''ö'' is sorted as equal to ''ø'' (o-slash). Also, ''aa'', when used as an alternative spelling to ''å'', is sorted as such. Other letters modified by diacritics are treated as variants of the underlying letter, with the exception that ''ü'' is frequently sorted as ''y''.

Languages that treat accented letters as variants of the underlying letter usually alphabetize words with such symbols immediately after similar unmarked words. For instance, in German where two words differ only by an umlaut, the word without it is sorted first in German dictionaries (e.g. ''schon'' and then ''schön'', or ''fallen'' and then ''fällen''). However, when names are concerned (e.g. in phone books or in author catalogues in libraries), umlauts are often treated as combinations of the vowel with a suffixed ''e''; Austrian phone books now treat characters with umlauts as separate letters (immediately following the underlying vowel).

In Spanish, the grapheme ''ñ'' is considered a new letter different from ''n'' and collated between ''n'' and ''o'', as it denotes a different sound from that of a plain ''n''. But the accented vowels ''á'', ''é'', ''í'', ''ó'', ''ú'' are not separated from the unaccented vowels ''a'', ''e'', ''i'', ''o'', ''u'', as the acute accent in Spanish only modifies [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] within the word or denotes a distinction between [[homonym]]s, and does not modify the sound of a letter.

For a comprehensive list of the collating orders in various languages, see [[Collating sequence]].

==Generation with computers==
Modern computer technology was developed mostly in English-speaking countries, so data formats, keyboard layouts, etc. were developed with a bias favoring English, a language with an alphabet without diacritical marks. This has led some to theorize that the marks and accents may be made obsolete to facilitate the worldwide exchange of data.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Efforts have been made to create [[internationalized domain names]] that further extend the English alphabet (e.g., "pokémon.com").

Depending on the [[keyboard layout]], which differs amongst countries, it is more or less easy to enter letters with diacritics on computers and typewriters. Some have their own keys; some are created by first pressing the key with the diacritic mark followed by the letter to place it on. Such a key is sometimes referred to as a [[dead key]], as it produces no output of its own but modifies the output of the key pressed after it.

In modern Microsoft Windows and Linux operating systems, the keyboard layouts ''US International'' and ''UK International'' feature [[dead key]]s that allow one to type Latin letters with the acute, grave, circumflex, diæresis, tilde, and cedilla found in Western European languages (specifically, those combinations found in the [[ISO Latin-1]] character set) directly: ''¨+e'' gives ''ë'', ''~+o'' gives ''õ'', etc. On [[Apple Macintosh]] computers, there are keyboard shortcuts for the most common diacritics; Option-''e'' followed by a vowel places an acute accent, Option-''u'' followed by a vowel gives an umlaut, option-''c'' gives a cedilla, etc. Diacritics can be [[Compose key|composed]] in most [[X Window System]] keyboard layouts, as well as other operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, using additional software.

On computers, the availability of [[code page]]s determines whether one can use certain diacritics.  [[Unicode]] solves this problem by assigning every known character its own code; if this code is known, most modern computer systems provide a [[Unicode#Input methods|method to input it]]. With Unicode, it is also possible to [[Combining diacritical mark|combine diacritical marks]] with most characters.

==Languages with letters containing diacritics==
The following languages have letters that contain diacritics that are considered independent letters distinct from those without diacritics.

; Baltic
:* [[Latvian alphabet|Latvian]] has the following letters: ''[[ā]], [[ē]], [[ī]], [[ū]], [[č]], [[ģ]], [[ķ]], [[ļ]], [[ņ]], [[š]], [[ž]]''
:* [[Lithuanian alphabet|Lithuanian]]. In general usage, where letters appear with the caron (''č, š'' and ''ž''), they are considered as separate letters from ''c, s'' or ''z'' and collated separately; letters with the [[ogonek]] (''[[ą]], [[ę]], [[į]]'' and ''[[ų]]''), the [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] (''[[ū]]'') and the [[anunaasika|superdot]] (''[[ė]]'') are considered as separate letters as well, but not given a unique collation order.
;Celtic
:* [[Welsh language|Welsh]] uses the [[circumflex]], [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]], acute, and [[grave accent|grave]] on its seven vowels ''a, e, i, o, u, w, y'' (â, ê, î, ô, û, ŵ, ŷ, ä, ë, ï, ö, ü, ẅ, ÿ, à, è, ì, ò, ù, ẁ, ỳ, á, é, í, ó, ú, ẃ, ý)
:* Following spelling reforms since the 1970s, [[Scottish Gaelic]] uses graves only, which can be used on any vowel (''[[à]], [[è]], [[ì]], [[ò]], [[ù]]''). Formerly acute accents could be used on ''á, ó'' and ''é'', which were used to indicate a specific vowel quality. With the elimination of these accents, the new orthography relies on the reader having prior knowledge of pronunciation of a given word.
:* [[Manx language|Manx]] uses the single diacritic [[ç]] combined with h to give the digraph {{angle bracket|çh}} (pronounced {{IPA|/tʃ/}}) to mark the distinction between it and the digraph {{angle bracket|ch}} (pronounced {{IPA|/h/}} or {{IPA|/x/}}). Other diacritics used in Manx included â, ê, ï, etc. to mark the distinction between two similarly spelled words but with slightly differing pronunciation.
:* [[Irish language|Irish]] uses only acute accents to mark long vowels, following the 1948 spelling reform.
:* [[Breton orthography|Breton]] does not have a single orthography (spelling system), but uses diacritics for a number of purposes. The diaresis is used to mark that two vowels are pronounced separately and not as a diphthong/digraph. The circumflex is used to mark long vowels, but usually only when the vowel length is not predictable by phonology. Nasalization of vowels may be marked with a tilde, or following the vowel with the letter &lt;ñ&gt;. The plural suffix -où is used as a unified spelling to represent a suffix with a number of pronunciations in different dialects, and to distinguish this suffix from the digraph &lt;ou&gt; which is pronounced as /u:/. An apostrophe is used in the to distinguish c'h, pronounced /x/ as the digraph &lt;ch&gt; is used in other Celtic languages, from the French-influenced digraph ch, pronounced /ʃ/.
; [[Cyrillic alphabets]]
:* [[Belarusian alphabet|Belarusian]] has a letter ''[[Short U (Cyrillic)|ў]]''.
:* Belarusian, [[Bulgarian language#Alphabet|Bulgarian]], Russian and Ukrainian have the letter ''[[Short I|й]]''.
:* Belarusian and [[Russian alphabet|Russian]] have the letter ''[[Yo (Cyrillic)|ё]]''. In Russian, this letter is usually replaced by ''[[Ye (Cyrillic)|е]]'', although it has a different pronunciation. The use of ''е'' instead of ''ё'' does not affect the pronunciation. ''Ё'' is always used in children's books and in dictionaries. A [[minimal pair]] is все (''vs'e'', "everybody" pl.) and всё (''vs'o'', "everything" n. sg.). In Belarusian the replacement by ''е'' is a mistake, in Russian, it is permissible to use either ''е'' or ''ё'' for ''ё'' but the former is more common in everyday writing (as opposed to instructional or juvenile writing).
:* The [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] [[Ukrainian alphabet]] has the letters ''[[ґ]]'', ''[[й]]'' and ''[[ї]]''. Ukrainian [[Latynka]] has many more.
:* [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] has the letters ''[[kje|ќ]]'' and ''[[gje|ѓ]]''.
;* In Bulgarian and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] the possessive pronoun ѝ (''ì'', "her") is spelled with a grave accent in order to distinguish it from the conjunction и (''i'', "and").
:* The acute accent "&amp;nbsp;́" above any vowel in Cyrillic alphabets is used in dictionaries, books for children and foreign learners to indicate the word stress, it also can be used for disambiguation of similarly spelled words with different lexical stresses.
; Finno-Ugric
:* [[Estonian alphabet|Estonian]] has a distinct letter ''[[õ]]'', which contains a tilde. Estonian "dotted vowels" ''ä'', ''ö'', ''ü'' are similar to German, but these are also distinct letters, not like German umlauted letters. All four have their own place in the alphabet, between ''w'' and ''x''. Carons in ''š'' or ''ž'' appear only in foreign proper names and [[loanwords]]. Also these are distinct letters, placed in the alphabet between ''s'' and ''t''.
:* [[Finnish alphabet|Finnish]] uses dotted vowels (''ä'' and ''ö''). As in Swedish and Estonian, these are regarded as individual letters, rather than vowel + umlaut combinations (as happens in German). It also uses the characters ''å'', ''š'' and ''ž'' in foreign names and loanwords. In the Finnish and Swedish alphabets, ''å'', ''ä'' and ''ö'' collate as separate letters after ''z'', the others as variants of their base letter.
:* [[Hungarian alphabet|Hungarian]] uses the umlaut, the acute and double acute accent (unique to Hungarian): ''ö ü'', ''á é í ó ú'' and ''ő ű''. The acute accent indicates the long form of a vowel (in case of ''i/í'', ''o/ó'', ''u/ú'') while the double acute performs the same function for ''ö'' and ''ü''. The acute accent can also indicate a different sound (more open, like in case of ''a/á'', ''e/é''). Both long and short forms of the vowels are listed separately in the [[Hungarian alphabet]], but members of the pairs ''a/á, e/é, i/í, o/ó, ö/[[ő]], u/ú'' and ''ü/[[ű]]'' are collated in dictionaries as the same letter.
:* [[Livonian language|Livonian]] has the following letters: ''ā, ä, [[ǟ]], [[ḑ]], ē, ī, ļ, ņ, ō, [[ȯ]], [[ȱ]], [[õ]], [[ȭ]], ŗ, š, ț, ū, ž''.
; Germanic
:* [[Faroese alphabet|Faroese]] uses [[acute accent|acutes]] and other special letters. All are considered separate letters and have their own place in the alphabet: ''[[á]]'', ''[[í]]'', ''[[ó]]'', ''[[ú]]'', ''[[ý]]'' and ''[[ø]]''.
:* [[Icelandic orthography|Icelandic]] uses acutes and other special letters. All are considered separate letters, and have their own place in the alphabet: ''[[á]]'', ''[[é]]'', ''[[í]]'', ''[[ó]]'', ''[[ú]]'', ''[[ý]]'', and ''[[ö]]''.
:* [[Danish alphabet|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] use additional characters like the o-slash ''[[ø]]'' and the a-overring ''[[å]]''. These letters come after ''z'' and ''[[æ]]'' in the order ''ø, å''. Historically, the ''å'' has developed from a ligature by writing a small superscript ''a'' over a lowercase ''a''; if an ''å'' character is unavailable, some Scandinavian languages allow the substitution of a doubled ''a''. The Scandinavian languages collate these letters after z, but have different [[collation]] standards.
:* [[Swedish alphabet|Swedish]] uses a-diaeresis (''[[ä]]'') and o-diaeresis (''[[ö]]'') in the place of ash (''æ'') and slashed o (''[[ø]]'') in addition to the a-overring (''å''). Historically, the diaeresis for the Swedish letters ''ä'' and ''ö'', like the [[German umlaut]], developed from a small Gothic ''e'' written above the letters. These letters are collated after ''z'', in the order ''å, ä, ö''.
; Romance
:* In [[Asturian language|Asturian]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Spanish alphabet|Spanish]], the character ''[[ñ]]'' is a letter and collated between ''n'' and ''o''.
:* [[Asturian language|Asturian]] uses [[Ḷ]] ([[lower case]] [[ḷ]]), and [[Voiceless glottal fricative|Ḥ]] ([[lower case]] [[Voiceless glottal fricative|ḥ]])&lt;ref&gt;Academia de la Llingua Asturiana, ''Gramática de la Llingua Asturiana'', tercera edición, Oviedo: Academia de la Llingua Asturiana (2001), {{ISBN|84-8168-310-8}}, {{cite web|url=http://www.academiadelallingua.com/diccionariu/gramatica_llingua.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525120027/http://www.academiadelallingua.com/diccionariu/gramatica_llingua.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-25 |df= }} (page 16, section 1.2)&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[Leonese language|Leonese]]: could use ''[[ñ]]'' or ''[[List of Latin digraphs#N|nn]]''.
:* [[Romanian alphabet|Romanian]] uses a [[breve]] on the letter ''a'' (''[[ă]]'') to indicate the sound [[schwa]] {{IPA|/ə/}}, as well as a circumflex over the letters ''a'' (''[[â]]'') and ''i'' (''[[î]]'') for the sound {{IPA|/ɨ/}}. Romanian also writes a [[comma]] below the letters ''s'' (''[[ș]]'') and ''t'' (''[[ț]]'') to represent the sounds {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/t͡s/}}, respectively. These characters are collated after their non-diacritic equivalent.
:* [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] uses the circumflex and the acute accent to indicate stress and vowel height whenever it is in an unpredictable location within the word. They can also function as a way to distinguish a few homographs. The former is used over the stressed high vowels ''â'' /ɐ/, ''ê'' /e/, and ''ô'' /o/ in contrast with the latter, which is used over stressed low vowels ''á'' /a/, ''é'' /ɛ/, and ''ó'' /ɔ/ and in ''í'' /i/ and ''ú'' /u/. The tilde is used to indicate nasalization, such as in ''ã'' /ɐ̃/ and ''õ'' /õ/. The grave accent is used to indicate [[crasis]], when two identical vowels are merged into one, thus affecting neither vowel quality nor stress, it is only used over a (''à''). The [[cedilha]] is used under c (''ç'') when it is pronounced as /s/ instead of /k/ before ''a'', ''o'' and ''u''. In total, [[á]], [[â]], [[ã]], [[à]], [[ç]], [[é]], [[ê]], [[í]], [[ó]], [[ô]], [[õ]] and [[ú]] can be found in Portuguese orthography. None of these are considered separate letters.
; Slavic
:* The [[Bosnian alphabet|Bosnian]], [[Croatian alphabet|Croatian]], and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] Latin alphabets have the symbols ''[[č]]'', ''[[ć]]'', ''[[đ]]'', ''[[š]]'' and ''[[ž]]'', which are considered separate letters and are listed as such in dictionaries and other contexts in which words are listed according to alphabetical order. They also have one [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] including a diacritic, ''[[dž]]'', which is also alphabetized independently, and follows ''[[d]]'' and precedes ''[[đ]]'' in the alphabetical order. The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet has no diacritics, instead it has a grapheme ([[glyph]]) for every letter of its Latin counterpart (including Latin letters with diacritics and the digraphs dž, ''[[Lje|lj]]'' and ''[[Nj (digraph)|nj]]'').
:* The [[Czech alphabet]] uses the acute (á é í ó ú ý), caron ([[č]] [[ď]] [[ě]] [[ň]] [[ř]] [[š]] [[ť]] [[ž]]), and for one letter ([[ů]]) the ring. (Note that in ď and ť the caron is modified to look lither like an apostrophe.)
:* [[Polish alphabet|Polish]] has the following letters: ''[[ą]] [[ć]] [[ę]] [[ł]] [[ń]] [[ó]] [[ś]] [[ź]] [[ż]]''. These are considered to be separate letters: each of them is placed in the alphabet immediately after its Latin counterpart (e.g. ''ą'' between ''a'' and ''b''), ''ź'' and ''ż'' are placed after ''z'' in that order.
:* The [[Slovak alphabet]] uses the acute (á é í ó ú ý [[ĺ]] [[ŕ]]), caron (č ď ľ ň š ť ž), umlaut (ä) and circumflex accent (ô).&lt;ref name="PSP2000"&gt;http://www.juls.savba.sk/ediela/psp2000/psp.pdf page 12, section I.2&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The basic [[Slovenian alphabet]] has the symbols ''[[č]]'', ''[[š]]'', and ''[[ž]]'', which are considered separate letters and are listed as such in dictionaries and other contexts in which words are listed according to alphabetical order. Letters with a [[caron]] are placed right after the letters as written without the diacritic. The letter ''đ'' may be used in non-transliterated foreign words, particularly names, and is placed after ''č'' and before ''d''.
; Turkic
:* [[Azerbaijani alphabet|Azerbaijani]] includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters [[Ç]], [[Ğ]], [[Dotted and dotless I|I, İ]], [[Ö]], [[Ş]] and [[Ü]].
:* [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]] includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters [[Ç]], [[Ğ]], I, İ, [[Ö]], [[Ş]] and [[Ü]].  Unlike Standard Turkish (but like [[Cypriot Turkish]]), Crimean Tatar also has the letter [[Ñ]].
:* [[Gagauz alphabet|Gagauz]] includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters [[Ç]], [[Ğ]], [[Dotted and dotless I|I, İ]], [[Ö]] and [[Ü]].  Unlike Turkish, Gagauz also has the letters [[Ä]], [[Ê]] [[Ș]] and [[Ț]].  [[Ș]] and [[Ț]] are derived from the [[Romanian alphabet]] for the same sounds. Sometime the Turkish [[Ş]] may be used instead of [[Ș]].
:* [[Turkish alphabet|Turkish]] uses a ''G'' with a breve (''[[Ğ]]''), two letters with an umlaut (''[[Ö]]'' and ''[[Ü]]'', representing two rounded front vowels), two letters with a cedilla (''[[Ç]]'' and ''[[S-cedilla|Ş]]'', representing the affricate {{IPA|/tʃ/}} and the fricative {{IPA|/ʃ/}}), and also possesses a dotted capital ''İ'' (and a dotless lowercase ''ı'' representing a high unrounded back vowel). In Turkish each of these are separate letters, rather than versions of other letters, where dotted capital ''İ'' and lower case ''i'' are the same letter, as are dotless capital ''I'' and lowercase ''ı''. [[Typeface|Typographically]], ''Ç'' and ''Ş'' are often rendered with a subdot, as in ''Ṣ''; when a hook is used, it tends to have more a comma shape than the usual cedilla.  The new Azerbaijani, Crimean Tatar, and Gagauz alphabets are based on the Turkish alphabet and its same diacriticized letters, with some additions.
:* [[Turkmen alphabet|Turkmen]] includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters [[Ç]], [[Ö]], [[Ş]] and [[Ü]]. In addition, Turkmen uses A with diaeresis (''[[Ä]]'') to represent {{IPA|/æ/}}, N with caron (''[[Ň]]'') to represent the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, Y with acute (''[[Ý]]'') to represent the [[palatal approximant]] {{IPA|/j/}}, and Z with caron (''[[Ž]]'') to represent {{IPA|/ʒ/}}.

; Other
:* [[Albanian alphabet|Albanian]] has two special letters [[Ç]] and [[Ё]] upper and lowercase. They are placed next to the most similar letters in the alphabet, c and e correspondingly.
:* [[Esperanto alphabet|Esperanto]] has the symbols ''[[ŭ]]'', ''[[ĉ]], [[ĝ]], [[ĥ]], [[ĵ]]'' and ''[[ŝ]]'', which are included in the alphabet, and considered separate letters.
:* Hawaiian uses the kahakô ([[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]) over vowels, although there is some disagreement over considering them as individual letters. The kahakô over a vowel can completely change the meaning of a word that is spelled the same but without the kahakô.
:* [[Kurdish alphabet|Kurdish]] uses the symbols [[Ç]], [[Ê]], [[Î]], [[Ş]] and [[Û]] with other 26 standard Latin alphabet symbols.
:* [[Lakota language|Lakota]] alphabet uses the [[caron]] for the letters ''č'', ''ȟ'', ''ǧ'', ''š'', and ''ž''. It also uses the [[acute accent]] for stressed vowels á, é, í, ó, ú, áŋ, íŋ, úŋ.
:* [[Maltese alphabet|Maltese]] uses a C, G, and Z with a dot over them (Ċ, Ġ, Ż), and also has an H with an extra horizontal bar. For uppercase H, the extra bar is written slightly above the usual bar. For lowercase H, the extra bar is written crossing the vertical, like a ''t'', and not touching the lower part ([[Ħ]], ħ). The above characters are considered separate letters. The letter 'c' without a dot has fallen out of use due to redundancy. 'Ċ' is pronounced like the English 'ch' and 'k' is used as a hard c as in 'cat'. 'Ż' is pronounced just like the English 'Z' as in 'Zebra', while 'Z' is used to make the sound of 'ts' in English (like 'tsunami' or 'maths'). 'Ġ' is used as a soft 'G' like in 'geometry', while the 'G' sounds like a hard 'G' like in 'log'.  The digraph 'għ' (called ''għajn'' after the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] letter name ''ʻayn'' for غ) is considered separate, and sometimes ordered after 'g', whilst in other volumes it is placed between 'n' and 'o' (the Latin letter 'o' originally evolved from the shape of [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] ''ʻayin'', which was traditionally collated after Phoenician ''nūn'').
:* The [[Syriac Latin alphabet]] uses the altered letters of ''[[Ā]], [[Č]], [[Ḏ]], [[Ē]], [[Ë]], [[Ġ]], [[Ḥ]], [[Ō]], [[Š]], [[Ṣ]], [[Ṭ]], [[Ū]], [[Ž]]'' alongside the 26 standard Latin alphabet symbols.&lt;ref&gt;S.P. Brock, "An Introduction to Syriac Studies", in J.H. Eaton (Ed.,), Horizons in Semitic Studies (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[Vietnamese alphabet|Vietnamese]] uses the [[horn (diacritic)|horn diacritic]] for the letters ''ơ'' and ''ư''; the [[circumflex]] for the letters ''â'', ''ê'', and ''ô''; the [[breve]] for the letter ''ă''; and a bar through the letter ''đ''.

==Diacritics that do not produce new letters==

===English===
{{main article|English terms with diacritical marks}}
[[English alphabet|English]] is one of the few European languages that does not have many words that contain diacritical marks. Exceptions are unassimilated foreign loanwords, including borrowings from [[French language|French]] and, increasingly, [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; however, the diacritic is also sometimes omitted from such words. Loanwords that frequently appear with the diacritic in English include ''café'', ''résumé'' or ''resumé'' (a usage that helps distinguish it from the verb ''resume''), ''[[soufflé]]'', and ''naïveté'' (see ''[[English terms with diacritical marks]]''). In older practice (and even among some orthographically conservative modern writers) one may see examples such as ''élite'', ''mêlée'' and ''rôle.''

English speakers and writers once used the diaeresis more often than now in words such as ''coöperation'' (from Fr. ''coopération''), ''zoölogy'' (from Grk. ''zoologia''), and ''seeër'' (now more commonly ''see-er ''or simply'' seer'') as a way of indicating that adjacent vowels belonged to separate syllables, but this practice has become far less common. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine is a major publication that continues to use the diaresis in place of a dash for clarity and economy of space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Norris|first=Mary|title=The Curse of the Diaeresis|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/04/the-curse-of-the-diaeresis.html|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few English words, out of context, can only be distinguished from others by a diacritic or modified letter, including [[wikt:exposé#English|exposé]], [[lamé (disambiguation)|lamé]], [[maté (disambiguation)|maté]], [[öre]], [[øre]], [[pâté]], and [[rosé]]'.  The same is true of ''[[résumé]],'' alternately ''{{sic|hide=y|res|umé,}}'' but nevertheless it is regularly spelled ''resume''.  In a few words, diacritics that did not exist in the original have been added for disambiguation, as in [[maté]] (from Sp. and Port. ''mate''), [[saké]] (the standard Romanization of the Japanese has no accent mark), and [[Malé]] (from Dhivehi މާލެ), to clearly distinguish them from the English words "mate", "sake", and "male".

The acute and grave accents are occasionally used in poetry and lyrics: the acute to indicate stress overtly where it might be ambiguous (''rébel'' vs. ''rebél'') or nonstandard for metrical reasons (''caléndar''), the grave to indicate that an ordinarily silent or elided syllable is pronounced (''warnèd,'' ''parlìament'').

In certain personal names such as ''[[Renée]]'' and ''[[Zoe (name)|Zoë]]'', often two spellings exist, and the preference will be known only to those close to the person themselves. Even when the name of a person is spelled with a diacritic, like Charlotte Brontë, this may be dropped in English language articles and even official documents such as [[passport]]s either due to carelessness, the typist not knowing how to enter letters with diacritical marks, or for technical reasons - [[California]], for example, does not allow names with diacritics as the computer system cannot process such characters. They also appear in some worldwide company names and/or trademarks such as [[Nestlé]] or [[Citroën]].

===Other languages===
The following languages have letter-diacritic combinations that are not considered independent letters.
* [[Afrikaans]] uses a diaeresis to mark vowels that are pronounced separately and not as one would expect where they occur together, for example ''voel'' (to feel) as opposed to ''voël'' (bird). The circumflex is used in ''ê, î, ô'' and ''û'' generally to indicate long [[Close-mid vowel|close-mid]], as opposed to [[Open-mid vowel|open-mid]] vowels, for example in the words ''wêreld'' (world) and ''môre'' (morning, tomorrow). The acute accent is used to add emphasis in the same way as underlining or writing in bold or italics in English, for example ''Dit is jóú boek'' (It is '''your''' book). The grave accent is used to distinguish between words that are different only in placement of the stress, for example ''appel'' (apple) and ''appèl'' (appeal) and in a few cases where it makes no difference to the pronunciation but distinguishes between homophones. The two most usual cases of the latter are the in the sayings ''òf... òf'' (either... or) and ''nòg... nòg'' (neither... nor) to distinguish them from ''of'' (or) and ''nog'' (again, still).
* [[Aymara language|Aymara]] uses a diacritical horn over ''p, q, t, k, ch''.
* [[Catalan alphabet|Catalan]] has the following composite characters: ''à, ç, é, è, í, ï, ó, ò, ú, ü, l·l''. The acute and the grave indicate [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and [[vowel height]], the cedilla marks the result of a historical [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]], the diaeresis indicates either a [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]], or that the letter ''u'' is pronounced when the graphemes ''gü, qü'' are followed by ''e'' or ''i'', the [[interpunct]] (·) distinguishes the different values of ''ll/l·l''.
* Some orthographies of [[Cornish language|Cornish]] such as [[Kernowek Standard]] and [[Unified Cornish]] use diacritics, while others such as [[Kernewek Kemmyn]] and the [[Standard Written Form]] do not (or only use them optionally in teaching materials).
* [[Dutch alphabet|Dutch]] uses the diaeresis. For example, in ''ruïne'' it means that the ''u'' and the ''i'' are separately pronounced in their usual way, and not in the way that the combination ''ui'' is normally pronounced. Thus it works as a separation sign and not as an indication for an alternative version of the ''i''. Diacritics can be used for emphasis (''érg koud'' for ''very'' cold) or for disambiguation between a number of words that are spelled the same when context doesn't indicate the correct meaning (''één appel'' = one apple, ''een appel'' = an apple; ''vóórkomen'' = to occur, ''voorkómen'' = to prevent). Grave and acute accents are used on a very small number of words, mostly loanwords. The ç also appears in some loanwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=van Geloven, Sander|title=Diakritische tekens in het Nederlands|url=http://hellebaard.nl/publicaties/poster/poster-diakritische-tekens-in-het-nederlands-4-stuks/|location=Utrecht|publisher=Hellebaard|year=2012|language=nl|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192341/http://hellebaard.nl/publicaties/poster/poster-diakritische-tekens-in-het-nederlands-4-stuks/|archivedate=2013-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Faroese alphabet|Faroese]]. Non-Faroese accented letters are not added to the Faroese alphabet. These include ''é'', ''ö'', ''ü'', ''å'' and recently also letters like ''š'', ''ł'', and ''ć''.
* [[Filipino alphabet|Filipino]] has the following composite characters: ''á, à, â, é, è, ê, í, ì, î, ó, ò, ô, ú, ù, û''. The actual use of diacritics for Filipino is, however, uncommon, meant only to distinguish between [[homonym]]s with different stresses and meanings that either occur near each other in a text or to aid the reader in ascertaining its otherwise ambiguous meaning. The letter eñe is due to the Spanish alphabet and too, is considered a separate letter. The diacritics appears in [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] [[List of loanwords in Tagalog#Spanish|loanwords]] and [[Filipino name|names]] if Spanish orthography is observed.
* [[Finnish alphabet|Finnish]]. Carons in ''š'' and ''ž'' appear only in foreign proper names and [[loanword]]s, but may be substituted with ''sh'' or ''zh'' if and only if it is technically impossible to produce accented letters in the medium. Contrary to Estonian, ''š'' and ''ž'' are not considered distinct letters in Finnish.
* [[French alphabet|French]] uses five diacritics. The grave (''accent grave'') marks the sound /ɛ/ when over an e, as in ''père'' ("father") or is used to distinguish words that are otherwise homographs such as ''a''/''à'' ("has"/"to") or ''ou''/''où'' ("or"/"where"). The [[acute accent|acute]] (''accent aigu'') is only used in "é", modifying the "e" to make the sound /e/, as in ''étoile'' ("star"). The [[circumflex]] (''accent circonflexe'') generally denotes that an S once followed the vowel in Old French or Latin, as in ''fête'' ("party"), the Old French being ''feste'' and the Latin being ''festum''. Whether the circumflex modifies the vowel's pronunciation depends on the dialect and the vowel. The [[cedilla]] (''cédille'') indicates that a normally hard "c" (before the vowels "a", "o", and "u") is to be pronounced /s/, as in ''ça'' ("that"). The [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (''tréma'') indicates that two adjacent vowels that would normally be pronounced as one are to be pronounced separately, as in ''Noël'' ("Christmas").
* [[Galician language|Galician]] vowels can bear an acute (''á, é, í, ó, ú'') to indicate stress or difference between two otherwise same written words (''é'', 'is' vs. ''e'', 'and'), but the [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (''trema'') is only used with ''ï'' and ''ü'' to show two separate vowel sounds in pronunciation. Only in foreign words may Galician use other diacritics such as ''ç'' (common during the Middle Ages), ''ê'', or ''à''.
* [[German alphabet|German]] uses the three umlauted characters ''ä'', ''ö'' and ''ü''. These diacritics indicate vowel changes. For instance, the word ''Ofen'' {{IPA-de|ˈoːfən|}} "oven" has the plural ''Öfen'' {{IPA|[ˈøːfən]}}. The mark originated as a superscript ''e''; a handwritten blackletter ''e'' resembles two parallel vertical lines, like a diaeresis. Due to this history, "ä", "ö" and "ü" can be written as "ae", "oe" and "ue" respectively, if the umlaut letters are not available.
* [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] has many various diacritic marks known as ''[[niqqud]]'' that are used above and below script to represent vowels. These must be distinguished from [[cantillation]], which are keys to pronunciation and syntax.
* The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] uses diacritic symbols and characters to indicate phonetic features or secondary articulations.
* [[Irish alphabet|Irish]] uses the acute to indicate that a vowel is [[vowel length|long]]: ''á'', ''é'', ''í'', ''ó'', ''ú''. It is known as ''síneadh fada'' "long sign" or simply ''fada'' "long" in Irish. In the older [[Gaelic type]], [[overdot]]s are used to indicate [[lenition]] of a consonant: ''ḃ'', ''ċ'', ''ḋ'', ''ḟ'', ''ġ'', ''ṁ'', ''ṗ'', ''ṡ'', ''ṫ''.
* [[Italian alphabet|Italian]] mainly has the [[acute accent|acute]] and the [[grave accent|grave]] (''à'', ''è''/''é'', ''ì'', ''ò''/''ó'', ''ù''), typically to indicate a stressed syllable that would not be stressed under the normal rules of pronunciation but sometimes also to distinguish between words that are otherwise spelled the same way (e.g. "e", and; "è", is). Despite its rare use, Italian orthography allows the circumflex (î) too, in two cases: it can be found in old literary context (roughly up to 19th century) to signal a [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncope]] (fêro→fecero, they did), or in modern Italian to signal the contraction of ″-ii″ due to the plural ending -i whereas the root ends with another -i; e.g., [[Grammatical number|s.]] demonio, [[plural|p.]] demonii→demonî; in this case the circumflex also signals that the word intended is not demoni, plural of "demone" by shifting the accent (demònî, "devils"; dèmoni, "demons").
* [[Lithuanian alphabet|Lithuanian]] uses the [[Acute accent|acute]], [[Grave accent|grave]] and [[tilde]] in dictionaries to indicate stress types in the language's [[pitch accent]] system.
* [[Maltese alphabet|Maltese]] also uses the grave on its vowels to indicate stress at the end of a word with two syllables or more: lowercase letters - à, è, ì, ò, ù | capital letters - À, È, Ì, Ò, Ù
* [[Māori language|Māori]] makes use of macrons to mark long vowels.
* [[Occitan alphabet|Occitan]] has the following composite characters: ''á, à, ç, é, è, í, ï, ó, ò, ú, ü, n·h, s·h''. The acute and the grave indicate [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and [[vowel height]], the cedilla marks the result of a historical [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]], the diaeresis indicates either a [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]], or that the letter ''u'' is pronounced when the graphemes ''gü, qü'' are followed by ''e'' or ''i'', and the [[interpunct]] (·) distinguishes the different values of ''nh/n·h'' and ''sh/s·h'' (i.e., that the letters are supposed to be pronounced separately, not combined into "ny" and "sh").
* [[Portuguese alphabet|Portuguese]] has the following composite characters: ''à, á, â, ã, ç, é, ê, í, ó, ô, õ, ú''. The acute and the circumflex indicate stress and vowel height, the grave indicates crasis, the tilde represents nasalization, and the cedilla marks the result of a historical palatalization.
* Acutes are also used in [[Slavic language]] dictionaries and textbooks to indicate [[lexical stress]], placed over the vowel of the stressed syllable. This can also serve to disambiguate meaning (e.g., in Russian писа́ть (''pisáť'') means "to write", but пи́сать (''písať'') means "to piss"), or "бо́льшая часть" (the biggest part) vs "больша́я часть" (the big part).
* [[Spanish alphabet|Spanish]] uses the acute and the diaeresis. The acute is used on a vowel in a stressed syllable in words with irregular stress patterns. It can also be used to "break up" a [[diphthong]] as in ''tío'' (pronounced {{IPA|[ˈti.o]}}, rather than {{IPA|[ˈtjo]}} as it would be without the accent). Moreover, the acute can be used to distinguish words that otherwise are spelled alike, such as ''si'' ("if") and ''sí'' ("yes"), and also to distinguish interrogative and exclamatory pronouns from homophones with a different grammatical function, such as ''donde/¿dónde?'' ("where"/"where?") or ''como/¿cómo?'' ("as"/"how?"). The acute may also used be used to avoid typographical ambiguity, as in ''1 ó 2'' ("1 or 2"; without the acute this might be interpreted as "1 0 2".  The diaeresis is used only over ''u'' (''ü'') for it to be pronounced {{IPA|[w]}} in the combinations ''gue'' and ''gui,'' where ''u'' is normally silent, for example ''ambigüedad.'' In poetry, the diaeresis may be used on ''i'' and ''u'' as a way to force a hiatus. As foreshadowed above, in nasal ''ñ'' the [[tilde]] (squiggle) is not considered a diacritic sign at all, but a composite part of a distinct glyph, with its own chapter in the dictionary: a glyph that denotes the 15th letter of the Spanish alphabet.
* [[Swedish alphabet|Swedish]] uses the [[acute accent|acute]] to show non-standard stress, for example in {{lang|sv|kafé}} (café) and {{lang|sv|resumé}} (résumé). This occasionally helps resolve ambiguities, such as ''ide'' (hibernation) versus ''idé'' (idea). In these words, the acute is not optional. Some proper names use non-standard diacritics, such as [[Carolina Klüft]] and [[Staël von Holstein]]. For foreign loanwords the original accents are strongly recommended, unless the word has been infused into the language, in which case they are optional. Hence ''crème fraîche'' but ''ampere''.  Swedish also has the letters ''å'', ''ä'', and ''ö'', but these are considered distinct letters, not ''a'' and ''o'' with diacritics.
* [[Tamil alphabet|Tamil]] does not have any diacritics in itself, but uses the [[Arabic numerals]]&lt;!-- Please confirm it is not using Indian or other numerals--&gt; 2, 3 and 4 as diacritics to represent aspirated, voiced, and voiced-aspirated consonants when Tamil script is used to write long passages in [[Sanskrit]].
* [[Thai alphabet|Thai]] has its [[Thai script#Diacritics|own system of diacritics]] derived from [[Indian numerals]], which denote different [[tone (linguistics)|tones]].
* [[Vietnamese alphabet|Vietnamese]] uses the acute (''dấu sắc''), the grave (''dấu huyền''), the tilde (''dấu ngã''), the underdot (''dấu nặng'') and the hoi (''dấu hỏi'') on vowels as [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] indicators.
* [[Welsh alphabet|Welsh]] uses the circumflex, diaeresis, acute, and grave on its seven vowels ''a, e, i, o, u, w, y''. The most common is the circumflex (which it calls ''to bach'', meaning "little roof", or ''acen grom'' "crooked accent", or ''hirnod'' "long sign") to denote a long vowel, usually to disambiguate it from a similar word with a short vowel. The rarer grave accent has the opposite effect, shortening vowel sounds that would usually be pronounced long. The acute accent and diaeresis are also occasionally used, to denote stress and vowel separation respectively. The ''w''-circumflex and the ''y''-circumflex are among the most commonly accented characters in Welsh, but unusual in languages generally, and were until recently very hard to obtain in word-processed and HTML documents.

==Transliteration==
Several languages that are not written with the Roman alphabet are [[transliteration|transliterated]], or romanized, using diacritics. Examples:
* [[Arabic]] has several [[Arabic romanization#Comparison table|romanisations]], depending on the type of the application, region, intended audience, country, etc. many of them extensively use diacritics, e.g., some methods use an underdot for rendering [[emphatic consonant]]s (ṣ, ṭ, ḍ, ẓ, ḥ). The macron is often used to render long vowels. š is often used for {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, ġ for {{IPA|/ɣ/}}.
* [[Chinese language|Chinese]] has several [[Romanization of Chinese|romanizations]] that use the umlaut, but only on ''u'' (''ü''). In [[Pinyin#Usage|Hanyu Pinyin]], the four [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]] of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] are denoted by the macron (first tone), acute (second tone), caron (third tone) and grave (fourth tone) diacritics. Example: ''ā, á, ǎ, à''.
* Romanized [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ([[Romaji]]) occasionally uses macrons to mark long vowels. The [[Hepburn romanization]] system uses [[Macron (diacritic)|macrons]] to mark [[long vowels]], and the [[Kunrei-shiki romanization|Kunrei-shiki]] and [[Nihon-shiki]] systems use a [[circumflex]].
* [[Sanskrit]], as well as many of its descendants, like [[Hindi]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]], uses a lossless [[transliteration|romanization]] system. This includes several letters with diacritical markings, such as the macron (ā, ī, ū), over- and underdots (ṛ, ḥ, ṃ, ṇ, ṣ, ṭ, ḍ) as well as a few others (ś, ñ).

'''Equatorial Spanish''', also called ''Coastal Colombian-Ecuadorian'' dialect or ''Chocoano'', is a dialect of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] spoken mainly in the coastal region of [[Ecuador]], as well as in the bordering coastal areas of northern [[Peru]] and southern [[Colombia]]. It is considered to be transitional between the [[Caribbean Spanish|Caribbean dialects]] and the [[Peruvian Coast Spanish|Peruvian Coast]] varieties. The major influential linguistic centers are [[Guayaquil]] and [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca|Buenaventura]]. There is an important subvariety of this dialect which is spoken by most of the communities of African descent dwelling on the border between coastal Colombia ([[Chocó Department|Chocó department]]), Ecuador ([[Esmeraldas Province|Esmeraldas province]]), and Peru ([[Tumbes Region]]), and which is said to reflect African influence in terms of [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] and [[isochrony|rhythm]].

The particular intonation which identifies the speakers of these regions has been a subject of study. Boyd-Bowman (1953) states that the features that he has observed show clearly a phonetic continuity along the coasts of Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, in contrast to that of their respective Andean provinces.&lt;ref&gt;"Los apuntes anteriores demuestran claramente la continuidad fonética entre las costas de Colombia, el Ecuador y el Perú [...], frente a la de sus provincias andinas [...]" (p.233).&lt;/ref&gt;
Boyd-Bowman observes that the present borders of Ecuador with the neighboring countries do not correspond to natural geographic boundaries, nor to linguistic/cultural boundaries (the same Spanish is spoken on both sides), nor to older political borders, whether of the Incas or of the Spanish colonies.&lt;ref&gt;"Por ejemplo, las fronteras actuales del Ecuador con los países colindantes no corresponden ni a fronteras naturales (esto es geográficas), ni a fronteras lingüístico-culturales (se habla el mismo español de ambos lados), ni a fronteras políticas antiguas (incaicas o coloniales)" (p. 233).&lt;/ref&gt; Lipski (1994) also considers the dialect of northern coastal Peru as a distinct variety of Spanish, based on phonetic features.

==Notable phonological characteristics==

Equatorial Spanish presents markedly attenuated Caribbean features:

*Syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}} is aspirated or elided (although the middle class tends to avoid doing so in the prevocalic environment).
*As in the [[Caribbean Spanish|Caribbean dialects]], the {{IPA|/x/}} phoneme is realized as {{IPA|[h]}}.
*Word-final {{IPA|/n/}} is realized as velar, and sometimes [[Labialization|bilabialized]], especially among speakers of African descent.
*In rural areas, there is virtually no difference between {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/ɾ/}}, but [[Deletion (phonology)|elision]] is rare.
*In the area of Chocó, intervocalic {{IPA|/d/}} is realized as {{IPA|[ɾ]}}. In this same region the aspirated {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/k/}}{{clarify|date=June 2015}} may result in a glottal stop.
* As in virtually all American dialects, ''[[seseo]]'' is the norm, meaning that the {{IPA|/θ/}} phoneme of European Spanish is absent and {{IPA|/s/}} is used instead. There are rural areas on the coast of Ecuador, for instance [[San Lorenzo, Ecuador|San Lorenzo]] in [[Esmeraldas Province|Esmeraldas]], where the phonetic realization of {{IPA|/s/}} is non-sibilant ({{IPAblink|θ}}), rather than sibilant {{IPAblink|s}}. This is called ''[[ceceo]]'' and is uncommon in the Americas (it is also found in some areas of [[Andalusia]]).
* [[Yeismo]] (merger of traditional {{IPA|/ʎ/}} and {{IPA|/ʝ/}}, with realization as {{IPAblink|ʝ}}) is also the general rule here, as it is in most of the American Spanish dialects.

The '''Faroese language conflict''' is a phase in the [[history of the Faroe Islands]] in the first half of the 20th century (approx. 1908 to 1938). It was the political and cultural argument between the requirements of the [[Faroese language]] in general use, and the [[Danish language]] as the official language of the [[Faroe Islands]].

At the beginning of the 20th century, the language of the church, public education, the government, and the law was Danish but Faroese was the language of ordinary people. The [[orthography]] of Faroese had been set out by [[Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb]] in the middle of the 19th century, and the language had aroused [[Faroese independence movement|Faroese nationalism]] since the [[Christmas Meeting of 1888]] or ''Jólafundurin''.

The conflict was not so much a struggle between the [[Faroe Islanders]] and the [[Danes]], but rather among the Faroese themselves. The positions evolved with time.

The same case can be found in [[Norway]] with the [[Norwegian language conflict]] between the [[Norwegian language]] and the [[Danish language]].

==Political camps==
The two political parties staking out positions on the language conflict were the [[Union Party (Faroe Islands)|Union Party]] (''Sambandsflokkurin''), which wanted continued union with Denmark; and the [[New Self-Government]] (''Sjálvstýrisflokkurin''), which desired independence from Denmark. Later two other political parties which also desired independence from Denmark were created: [[People's Party (Faroe Islands)|People's Party]] (''Fólkaflokkurin'', a [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] separatist party) in 1939 and the Republican Party (now [[Republic (Faroe Islands)|Republic]], ''Tjóðveldi'', a [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] separatist party) in 1948. These two parties have also worked for more rights for speakers of the Faroese language.

===Position of the ''Samband''===

The view of the ''Samband'' (unionists) was that the Faroese language should be developed and used in the literary field. However, the Danish language should continue to be the official language of education, which all Faroese should speak and understand. The unionists also opposed the comprehensive introduction of Faroese for the [[catechism]], which they accused ''Sjálvstyri'' of wanting.

''Samband'' had two major arguments for the use of Danish in education: they said that advanced education was only possible if the Faroese students understood Danish well enough to be able to study in Denmark; and moreover, there were too few Faroese-language school books for the people of the small islands.

===Position of the ''Sjálvstyri''===

The ''Sjálvstyri'' (separatists) had national sentiment on their side. They regarded it as untenable that the official language could be other than the native language. The party program formulated a core demand that the Faroese language should become the language of instruction in all subjects. At the same time the party tried to use the language conflict to further its separatist goals.

They had a consistency argument for Faroese as the language of instruction: in the other parts of the Danish kingdom education was conducted in the native language: [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] in [[Iceland]], [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] or ''Kalaallisut'' in Greenland, and [[English language|English]] in the [[Danish West Indies]] (from 1917 the [[United States Virgin Islands]]). It was thus a question of equal treatment for all areas under the Danish crown.

==Revival as the language of instruction==

History worked for the demands of ''Sjálvstyri''. 1908 is considered to be the start of the conflict, which persisted until 1938. In 1908 the teachers of the sixth-form [[secondary school]] in [[Tórshavn]] (the capital) petitioned the school administration to be allowed to use Faroese in teaching. The administration responded with a partial refusal: Faroese could be used only as an aid, in order to explain certain things. [[Jákup Dahl]], who later became the [[Provost (education)|Provost]], was opposed to the administration's ruling and refused to teach in Danish; from then on he taught in Faroese. The school administration referred the issue to the Danish education ministry, which referred it to the ''[[Løgting]]'', the Faroese parliament, who could not agree on the issue and in 1910 split into two sides, a majority opinion and a minority opinion. The majority opinion was represented by ''Samband'': Danish was more important as a foreign language than others such as German and English, and the pupils were to hear and speak Danish in all subjects. An important argument for this was that Danish was a key to the higher education in Denmark, and thus was important for the young people's vocational progress.

The ''Sjálvstyri'' maintained their previous position, that it was natural and understandable that a people should be taught in their native language. But they did not dispute that there were no appropriate teaching materials in Faroese. So they proposed that it should be left to each teacher in which language they taught.

As a compromise, it was planned that Faroese was to be used as the language of instruction for the younger children. For the older students, fundamental instruction would be in Danish with Faroese permitted as an aid to instruction. On January 16, 1912, this regulation was passed by the Danish government as §7 of the Faroese school regulations.

Although it could be rated as a partial success of ''Sjálvstyri'', their demands remained on the agenda of the party after passage of the §7 regulation. [[Louis Zachariasen]] in [[Velbastaður]] was the first teacher to oppose the regulation openly, and he refused to teach further on Danish. This contravened the regulation that "Faroese was only to be used as an auxiliary language." Zachariasen quit publicly as a teacher and became one of the "separatist martyrs".

The language conflict entered a new phase in 1918, when the question was raised of why Faroese spelling was still not a compulsory subject in the schools. In the above-mentioned school regulations of 1912, this question had been deliberately ignored, since many Faroese teachers did not have sufficient knowledge of the orthography of their native language. However, there were already efforts under way to address this problem, as summer vacation courses in Faroese orthography were being conducted. As the time seemed ripe, the ''Løgting'' requested the Danish government to introduce Faroese spelling as a compulsory subject. The Danish education ministry immediately agreed, but §7 remained unchanged.

The language conflict became more abstract and it became a matter of a finding suitable formulation for instruction. Efforts were made to find a good way to teach Faroese, while still guaranteeing that the students would have an appropriate knowledge of Danish to further their higher education. The Ministry of Education in [[Copenhagen]] suggested in 1925 that Faroese should become the language of general instruction, but Danish should be the language of instruction in geography and history. At that time the party of the ''Samband'' rebelled because they believed that the new rules went too far in separating the Faroese from the Danish. As a result, the majority in the ''Løgting'' rejected the new regulations.

In the ''Løgting'' elections of 1936, the [[Social Democratic Party (Faroe Islands)|Social Democratic Party]] (''Javnaðarflokkurin'', Social Democratic Party) substantially increased its representation at the expense of the ''Samband''. Together with the Self-Government party, the Social Democrats changed the law to replace the Danish language with Faroese. On December 13, 1938 the Danish government agreed.

==Revival as church language==
Since the [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein]] in the 16th century, Danish had been the exclusive [[liturgical language]] in the Faroese [[archipelago]]. Only Danish was used in the [[Church of Denmark|People's Church]], and this was one of the main reasons why no written tradition in Faroese developed.

In 1903 Faroese became permitted under certain conditions for use in the church: the [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] must take place in Danish, and Faroese could be used to preach only if all church authorities, the Provost and local council agreed. From 1912 the communion service could be held in Faroese, but only if the [[bishop]] gave his consent beforehand.

[[Faroese Islanders]] achieved a general penetration of their [[first language]] as the church language. Most of the faithful conservatively associated the Danish language firmly with the [[liturgy]], with the [[hymn]]s, and not least with the [[Bible]]. Even today certain Faroese church songs are still sung gladly in the old Danish. In [[Tórshavn]] an opinion poll was taken, and the majority of the churchgoers expressed a desire for the retention of Danish in church.

Nevertheless, the question was discussed several times in the ''Løgting'', and some Union Party politicians argued pragmatically for the retention of Danish: many of the priests were Danes, and if each priest could choose in which language he preaches, this would lead to general confusion, e.g., if a community was accustomed to a church service in Faroese but then got a Danish pastor.

As with education, the penetration of the native language into the church was only a matter of time and depended on the availability of literature. As early as 1823 the [[Gospel of Matthew]] appeared in Faroese, but it met with no broad approval by the people because of the uncertainty of the Faroese orthography that prevailed before [[Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb|Hammershaimb]]'s time. In 1908 the [[Gospel of John]] in Faroese was published, but only because the minister [[Jákup Dahl]] assisted the revival of Faroese as the church language; he presented a Faroese hymn book in 1921 and completed a translation of the [[New Testament]] in 1937. Up to his death in 1944 Dahl continued to work on a translation of the [[Old Testament]], which was completed by [[Kristian Osvald Viderø]] in 1961.

The [[Lutheranism|Evangelical Lutheran]] national church authorized each of Dahl's works immediately after it appeared. Dahl also translated the [[catechism]] and a religious history. Dahl's collection of sermons in book form became important for the Faroese. In the remote areas of the islands it was normal for a pastor to be in charge of up to six churches, which he visited in sequence. When the pastor could not be present the [[Church service|services]] in the churches were conducted by [[laity|laymen]], who used sermons from Dahl’s printed collection.

March 13, 1939, is the day on which Faroese became fully authorized as a church language. Today the native clergy use Faroese almost exclusively.

==Equality in legal proceedings==

In 1920 the issue of the use of Faroese in legal proceedings was raised. That resulted from a reform in Denmark, that applies now in court, whereas previously it applied only to written legal documents{{Clarify|date=October 2009}}. On April 11, 1924, a regulation came into force in the Faroes which laid down that the legal language was Danish, but that Faroese-speaking judges may hold their proceedings in Faroese if the parties to the legal action speak Faroese. The legal documents could also be drawn up in Faroese, providing that a certified translation into Danish was also made, if  prescribed by law, or required by the defence. These Danish documents were important if proceedings were to take place in Denmark.

In 1931 further demands were made to expand the use of Faroese in legal proceedings. These were resisted by the ''Samband'' who said that Danish documents were indispensable for further hearings in Danish courts.

On January 4, 1944 the ''Løgting'' legislated the full equality of Faroese in legal proceedings. That happened because of the special situation of the Faroe Islands in [[World War II]], when Denmark was occupied by [[Germany]] and all connections with the government in [[Copenhagen]] were severed. However this law remained in force after the war.

==Faroese in other areas==
The introduction of Faroese as the business language took place over a longer period of time. Starting in 1920 the Faroese telephone directory appeared in the national language. Starting in 1925 it was the secondary language in the [[Posta (company)|Postverk Føroya]] or postal service, and starting in 1927 the [[minutes]] of the Løgting were recorded in Faroese.

With the autonomy (home-rule) law of 1948, Faroese was finally the language used in all affairs, with the proviso that Danish should always be taught in school so that all can use Danish to communicate with other [[Scandinavia]]ns.

'''Foil stamping''', (also known as foil application) typically a commercial printing process, is the application of metallic or pigmented foil on to a solid surface by application of a heated die onto foil, making it permanently adhere to the surface below leaving the design of the die.

==Description==

In the process known as hot foil stamping, foil stamping machines uses heat to transfer metallic foil to a solid surface. Examples of items that are foil stamped include annual reports, pocket folders, product packaging, note cards/thank you cards, business cards, envelopes and letterhead. The foil stamp is a permanent process.

==Types==

There are two primary types of foil stamping machines. The first type is manual and the second is pneumatic (air powered), which typically used in a commercial print shop. Manual foil stampers are ideal for low jobs and the pneumatic is ideal for medium to high-volume jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.officezone.com/how-to-choose-a-hot-foil-stamper.htm | title = Types of Foil Stampers | accessdate = 2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial Foil Stamping is usually produced on a Kluge foil stamp press or a Heidelberg Windmill retro fitted for foil stamping. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://corcoranprinting.com/tag/kluge-foil-stamp-press | title = Kluge Foil Stamp Press - Corcoran Printing | accessdate = 2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foil==

Foils come in a wide selection of colors and finishes, from the most commonly used metallic gold and silver to foils with pearlescent and holographic effects. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://corcoranprinting.com/foil-stamping-can-help-your-product-packaging-and-other-materials-stand-out | title = Foil Stamping can help your product-packaging and other materials stand out - Corcoran Printing | }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Galician-Portuguese''' ({{lang-gl|galego-portugués}} or ''{{lang|gl|galaico-portugués}}'', {{lang-pt|galego-português}} or ''{{lang|pt|galaico-português}}''), also known as '''Old Portuguese''' or as '''Medieval Galician''' when referring to the history of each modern language, was a [[West Iberian languages|West Iberian Romance language]] spoken in the [[Middle Ages]], in the northwest area of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Alternatively, it can be considered a historical period of the Galician and Portuguese languages.

Galician-Portuguese was first spoken in the area bounded in the north and west by the Atlantic Ocean and by the [[Douro River]] in the south, comprising Galicia and northern Portugal, but it was later extended south of the Douro by the ''[[Reconquista]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Azevedo Maia|first=Clarinda|title=História do galego-português: estado linguístico da Galiza e do noroeste de Portugal desde o século XIII ao século XVI (com referência à situação do galego moderno)|year=1997|publisher=Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian|location=Lisboa|isbn=9789723107463|edition=Reimpressã da edição do INIC (1986)|pages=883–891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the common ancestor of modern [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Galician-Asturian|Eonavian]] and [[Fala language|Fala]] varieties, all of which maintain a very high level of [[mutual intelligibility]]. The term "Galician-Portuguese" also designates the subdivision of the modern West Iberian group of Romance languages.

===Origins and history===
{{See also|History of Portuguese|Galician language#History}}

Galician-Portuguese developed in the region of the former Roman province of [[Gallaecia]], from the [[Vulgar Latin]] (common Latin) that had been introduced by Roman soldiers, colonists and magistrates during the time of the [[Roman Empire]]. Although the process may have been slower than in other regions, the centuries of contact with Vulgar Latin, after a period of bilingualism, completely extinguished the native languages, leading to the evolution of a new variety of Latin with a few Gallaecian features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.uwm.edu/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_16/lujan_6_16.pdf||title=The Language(s) of the Callaeci|last=Luján Martínez|first=Eugenio R.|journal=e-Keltoi: Journal of Interdisciplinary Celtic Studies|volume=6|pages=715–748|date=3 May 2006|issn=1540-4889}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.instituto-camoes.pt/cvc/hlp/biblioteca/origens_lex_port.pdf|chapter=Origens e estruturação histórica do léxico português|year=1989|title=Estudos de Linguística Histórica Galego-Portuguesa|location=Lisboa|publisher=IN-CM|pages=9–16|first=Joseph-Maria|last=Piel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gallaecian language|Gallaecian]] and [[Lusitanian language|Lusitanian]] influences were absorbed into the local Vulgar Latin dialect, which can be detected in some Galician-Portuguese words as well as in placenames of [[Celtic language|Celtic]] and [[Iberians|Iberian]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;Such as ''Bolso'': [http://www.csarmento.uminho.pt/docs/ndat/rg/RGVE1999_015.pdf A Toponímia Céltica e os vestígios de cultura material da Proto-História de Portugal.

It is assumed that the [[Iberian languages|Pre-Roman languages]] spoken by the [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|native people]], each used in a different region of Roman Hispania, contributed to the development of several different dialects of Vulgar Latin and that these diverged increasingly over time, eventually evolving into the early Romance Languages of Iberia.

It is believed that by 600, Vulgar Latin was no longer spoken in the Iberian Peninsula.&lt;ref name="lus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cvc.instituto-camoes.pt/hlp/brevesum/porque.html#Origens|title=As origens do romance galego-português|publisher=Instituto Luis de Camões}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early form of Galician-Portuguese was already spoken in the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]] and by the year 800 Galician-Portuguese had already become the [[vernacular]] of northwestern Iberia.&lt;ref name="lus" /&gt; The first known [[phonetic]] changes in Vulgar Latin, which began the evolution to Galician-Portuguese, took place during the rule of the Germanic groups, the [[Suebi]] (411–585) and [[Visigoths]] (585–711).&lt;ref name="lus"/&gt; And the Galician-Portuguese "inflected infinitive" (or "personal infinitive")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.continuitas.org/texts/alinei_benozzo_alguns-aspectos.pdf|title=Alguns aspectos da Teoria da Continuidade Paleolítica aplicada à região galega|first1=Mario|last1=Alinei|first2=Francesco|last2=Benozzo|year=2008|access-date=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[nasal vowels]] may have evolved under the influence of local Celtic languages&lt;ref&gt;[http://ling.cornell.edu/people/Weiss/CGL_34_Language_Contact_5.pdf Comparative Grammar of Latin 34] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927041334/http://ling.cornell.edu/people/Weiss/CGL_34_Language_Contact_5.pdf |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arkeotavira.com/Mapas/Iberia/Populi.htm Ethnologic Map of Pre-Roman Iberia (circa 200 B.C.)].

The nasal vowels would thus be a phonologic characteristic of the Vulgar Latin spoken in Roman [[Gallaecia]], but they are not attested in writing until after the 6th and 7th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.instituto-camoes.pt/cvc/hlp/gramhist/fonetica.html Fonética histórica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922075547/http://www.instituto-camoes.pt/cvc/hlp/gramhist/fonetica.html |date=22 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pacto dos irmãos Pais'', recently discovered (and possibly dating from before 1173), has been said to be even older, but despite the enthusiasm of some scholars, it has been shown that the documents are not really written in Galician-Portuguese but are in fact a mixture of Late Latin and Galician-Portuguese phonology, morphology and syntax.&lt;ref&gt;Ivo Castro, ''Introdução à História do Português. Geografia da Língua. Português Antigo''. [Lisbon: Colibri, 2004], pp. 121–125, and by A. Emiliano, cited by Castro&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Noticia de Torto]]'', of uncertain date (c. 1214?), and the ''[[Testamento de D. Afonso II]]'' (27 June 1214) are most certainly Galician-Portuguese.&lt;ref name="old" /&gt; The earliest poetic texts (but not the manuscripts in which they are found) date from c. 1195 to c. 1225. Thus, by the end of the 12th century and the beginning of the 13th there are documents in prose and verse written in the local Romance vernacular.

In Galicia the oldest document showing traces of the underlying Romance language is a royal charter by king Silo, dated in 775: it uses substrate words as ''arrogio'' and ''lagena'', now ''arroio'' ("stream") and ''laxe'' ("stone"), and presents also the elision of unstressed vowels and the lenition of plosive consonants;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite book |last1=García Leal |first1=Alfonso |title=El diploma del Rey Silo. |date=2007 |publisher=Fundación Pedro Barrié de la Maza |location=A coruña |isbn=978-84-95892-36-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; actually, many Galician Latin charters written during the Middle Ages show interferences of the local Galician-Portuguese contemporary language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Veiga Arias |first1=Amable |title=Algunas calas en los orígenes del gallego |date=1983 |publisher=Galaxia |location=Vigo |isbn=84-7154-423-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for the oldest document written in Galician-Portuguese in Galicia, it is probably a document from the monastery of Melón dated in 1231,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Souto Cabo |first1=José Antonio |title=Documentos galego-portugueses dos séculos XII e XIII |date=2008 |publisher=Universidade da Coruña |location=A Coruña |isbn=978-84-9749-314-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the 1228-dated ''Charter of the Boo Burgo of Castro Caldelas'' is probably a slightly latter translation of a Latin original.

===Literature===
{{main article|Galician-Portuguese lyric}}

[[File:Martim Codax Cantigas de Amigo.jpg|thumb|Pergamiño Vindel, containing works by Martin Codax]]
Galician-Portuguese had a special cultural role in the literature of the Christian kingdoms of [[Crown of Castile]] ([[Kingdom of Castile|Kingdoms of Castile]], [[Kingdom of León|Leon]] and [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]],part of the medieval NW [[Iberian Peninsula]]) comparable to the [[List of Catalan-language poets|Catalan Language]] of the [[Crown of Aragon]] ([[Principality of Catalonia]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Kingdoms of Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] and [[Kingdom of Majorca|Majorca]], NE medieval Iberian Peninsula), or that of [[Occitan language|Occitan]] in France and Italy during the same historical period. The main extant sources of Galician-Portuguese [[lyric poetry]] are these:
* The four extant manuscripts of the ''[[Cantigas de Santa Maria]] (written under the patronage of [[Alfonso X the Wise]], king of Castile, Leon and Galicia from 1252–1284)''
* ''[[Cancioneiro da Ajuda]]''
* ''[[Cancioneiro da Vaticana]]''
* ''[[Cancioneiro Colocci-Brancuti]]'', also known as ''Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional'' ([[Lisbon]])
* Cancioneiro dun Grande de Espanha
* Pergaminho Vindel
* [[Pergaminho Sharrer]]
* Os 5 lais de Bretanha
* Tenzón entre Afonso Sánchez e Vasco Martíns de Resende

The language was used for literary purposes from the final years of the 12th century to roughly the middle of the 14th century in what are now Spain and Portugal and was, almost without exception, the only language used for the composition of lyric poetry. Over 160 poets are recorded, among them [[Bernal de Bonaval]], Pero da Ponte, Johan Garcia de Guilhade, Johan Airas de Santiago, and Pedr' Amigo de Sevilha. The main [[Secularity (non-religiosity)|secular]] poetic genres were the ''cantigas d'amor'' (male-voiced love lyric), the ''[[cantiga de amigo|cantigas d'amigo]]'' (female-voiced love lyric) and the ''cantigas d'escarnho e de mal dizer'' (including a variety of genres from personal invective to social satire, poetic parody and literary debate).&lt;ref&gt;Many of these texts correspond to the Greek ''psogoi'' mentioned by [[Aristotle]] [''Poetics'' 1448b27] and exemplified in the verses of iambographers such as [[Archilochus]] and [[Hipponax]].&lt;/ref&gt;

All told, nearly 1,700 poems survive in these three genres, and there is a corpus of over 400 ''cantigas de Santa Maria'' (narrative poems about miracles and hymns in honor of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Holy Virgin]]).   The [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] king [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X]] composed his ''cantigas de Santa Maria'' and his ''cantigas de escárnio e maldizer'' in Galician-Portuguese, even though he used [[Spanish language|Castilian]] for prose.

[[Dinis of Portugal|King Dinis of Portugal]], who also contributed (with 137 extant texts, more than any other author) to the secular poetic genres, made the language [[official language|official]] in Portugal in 1290. Until then, Latin had been the official (written) language for royal documents; the spoken language did not have a name and was simply known as ''lingua vulgar'' ("ordinary language", that is Vulgar Latin) until it was named "Portuguese" in King Dinis' reign. "Galician-Portuguese" and ''português arcaico'' ("Old Portuguese") are modern terms for the common ancestor of modern Portuguese and modern Galician. Compared to the differences in [[Ancient Greek]] dialects, the alleged differences between 13th-century Portuguese and Galician are trivial.

===Divergence===

{{main article|Portuguese language|Galician language}}

As a result of political division, Galician-Portuguese lost its unity when the [[County of Portugal]] [[Kingdom of Galicia#Separation of the County of Portugal .281128.29|separated from the Kingdom of Galicia in 1128]] (a dependent kingdom of Leon) to establish the [[Kingdom of Portugal]]. The [[Galician language|Galician]] and Portuguese versions of the language then diverged over time as they followed independent evolutionary paths.
As Portugal's territory was extended southward during the Reconquista, the increasingly distinctive Portuguese language was adopted by the people in those regions, supplanting the earlier [[Arabic]] and other Romance/Latin languages that were spoken in these conquered areas during the Moorish era. Meanwhile, Galician was influenced by the neighboring Leonese language, especially during the time of kingdoms of Leon and Leon-Castile, and in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries it has been influenced by Castilian. Two cities at the time of separation, [[Braga]] and [[Porto]], were within the County of Portugal and have remained within Portugal. Further north, the cities of [[Lugo]], [[A Coruña]] and the great medieval centre of [[Santiago de Compostela]] remained within Galicia.

Galician was the main written language in Galicia till the 16th century, but later it was displaced by [[Castilian Spanish]], which was the official language of the [[Crown  of Castille]]. Galician slowly became mainly an oral language, preserved by the majority rural or "uneducated" population living in the villages and towns, and Castilian was taught as the "correct" language to the bilingual educated elite in the cities. During most of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries its written used was largely reduced to popular literature and theatre and private letters. From the 18th century on grew the interest for the language, due to the studies of illustrated writers such as [[Martin Sarmiento]] —who studied the evolution of Galician from Latin and prepared the foundations for the first dictionary of Galician—, José Cornide, and father Sobreira. In the 19th century a true literature in Galician emerged during the [[Rexurdimento]], followed by the apparition of journals and, in the 20th century, scientific publications. Because until comparatively recently most Galicians lived in many small towns and villages in a relatively remote and mountainous land, the language changed very slowly and was only very slightly influenced from outside the region. That situation made Galician remain the vernacular of Galicia until the late nineteenth/early twentieth centuries and its most spoken language till the early 21st century. Modern Galician was only officially recognized by the Second Spanish Republic in the 1930s as a co-official language with Castilian within Galicia. The recognition was revoked by the regime of [[Francisco Franco]] but was restored after his death.

The linguistic classification of Galician and Portuguese is still discussed today. There are those among Galician independence groups who demand their reunification as well as Portuguese and Galician [[philology|philologists]] who argue that both are [[dialect]]s of a common [[language]] rather than two separate ones.

The [[Fala language]], spoken in a small region of the Spanish autonomous community of [[Extremadura]], underwent a similar development as Galician.

Today Galician is the regional language of Galicia (sharing co-officiality with Spanish), and it is spoken by the majority of its population, although there is a hard decline of use and efficient knowledge among the younger generations, and the phonetics and lexicon of many occasional users is heavily influenced by Spanish. Portuguese continues to grow and, today, is the sixth most spoken language in the world.

==Oral traditions==
There has been a sharing of folklore in the Galician-Portuguese region going back to prehistoric times. As the Galician-Portuguese language spread south with the [[Reconquista]], supplanting Mozarabic, this ancient sharing of folklore intensified. In 2005 the governments of Portugal and Spain jointly proposed that Galician-Portuguese oral traditions be made part of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]. The work of documenting and transmitting that common culture involves several universities and other organizations.

Galician-Portuguese folklore is rich in oral traditions. These include the ''cantigas ao desafio'' or ''regueifas'', duels of improvised songs, many legends, stories, poems, romances, folk songs, sayings and riddles, and ways of speech that still retain a lexical, phonetic, morphological and syntactic similarity.

Also part of the common heritage of oral traditions are the markets and festivals of patron saints and processions, religious celebrations such as the ''magosto,'' ''entroido'' or [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]], with ancient dances and tradition – like the one where [[cuco|Coca]] the [[dragon]] fights with [[Saint George]]; and also traditional clothing and adornments, crafts and skills, work-tools, carved vegetable lanterns, superstitions, traditional knowledge about plants and animals. All these are part of a common heritage considered in danger of extinction as the traditional way of living is replaced by modern life, and the jargon of fisherman, the names of tools in traditional crafts, and the oral traditions which form part of celebrations are slowly forgotten.

A Galician-Portuguese "baixo-limiao" lect is spoken in several villages. In Galicia it is spoken in [[Entrimo]] and [[Lobios]] and in northern Portugal in [[Terras de Bouro]] (lands of the [[Buri (Germanic tribe)|Buri]]) and [[Castro Laboreiro]] including the mountain town (county seat) of Soajo and surrounding villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agal-gz.org/pdf/falabaixalimia.pdf|last=Ribeira|first=José Manuel|title=A Fala Galego-Portuguesa da Baixa Limia e Castro Laboreiro: Integrado no Projecto para a declaraçom de Património da Humanidade da Cultura Imaterial Galego-Portuguesa|access-date=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3038">'''Ibn Athīr''' is the family name of three brothers, all famous in [[Arabic literature]], born at Jazīrat ibn Umar in ''Cizre'' nowadays in south-eastern [[Turkey]].

==Brothers==

===Majd ad-Dīn===
The eldest brother, known as [[Majd ad-Dīn Ibn Athir|Majd ad-Dīn]] (1149–1210), was long in the service of the amir of [[Mosul]], and was an earnest student of tradition and [[language]]. His [[dictionary]] of traditions (Kitāb an-Ni/zdya) was published at [[Cairo]] (1893), and his dictionary of family names (''Kitāb ul-Murassa'') has been edited by [[Ferdinand Seybold]] (Weimar, 1896).

===Diyā' ad-Dīn===
The youngest brother ، ضياء الدين ، Diyā' ad-Dīn  (1163–1239), served under [[Saladin]] from 1191 and his son [[al-Malik al-Afdal]] who succeeded him, served in [[Egypt]], [[Samosata]], [[Aleppo]], [[Mosul]] and [[Baghdad]]. He was one of the most famous aesthetic and stylistic critics of Arabian literature. His "Book of Analysis" or ''Kitab at-Tahlil'' (كتاب التحليل)&lt;ref&gt;URL: http://download-story-pdf-ebooks.com/6557-free-book.&lt;/ref&gt; published by [[Bulaq Press]] in [[1865 in literature|1865]] (cf. ''Journal of the German Oriental Society'', xxxv. 148, and [[Ignaz Goldziher]]'s ''Abhandlungen'', i. 161 sqq.), contains very independent criticism of ancient and modern [[Arabic verse]].  A selection of his letters published by [[David Samuel Margoliouth]] are available under the title ''On the Royal Correspondence of Diyā' ad-Dīn al-Jazarī'' in the ''Actes du dixieme congrès international des orientalistes'', sect. 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;7–2 I.

===Ali ibn al-Athir===
The most famous brother was [[Ali ibn al-Athir]] (May 13, 1160 – 1233), who devoted himself to the study of history and Islamic tradition. At the age of twenty-one he settled with his father in Mosul and continued his studies there. In the service of the amir for many years, he visited Baghdad and [[Jerusalem]] and later [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]]. He died in Mosul. His world history, the [[The Complete History (book)|al-Kāmil fi t-tarīkh]]&lt;ref&gt;URL: https://archive.org/details/Alkamil_Fi_Tarikh&lt;/ref&gt; (''The Complete History''), extends to the year 1231. It has been edited by [[:sv:Karl Johan Tornberg|Carl Tornberg]], ''Ibn al-Athīr Chronicon quod perfectissinum inscribitur'' (14 vols., Leiden, 1851–1876). The first part of this work up to A.H. 310 (A.D. 923) is an abbreviation of the work of [[Muhammad ibn Jarire al-Tabari|Tabari]] with minor additions. Ibn Athīr also wrote a history of the [[Atabeg]]s of Mosul ''at-Tarīkh al-atabakīya'', published in the ''[[Recueil des historiens des croisades]]'' (vol. ii., Paris); a work (''Usd al-Ghdba'') giving an account of 7,500 companions of the Muslim prophet Muhammad (5 vols., Cairo, 1863), and a compendium (the ''Lubāb'') of Samani's Kitāb ui-A n.~db (cf. [[Ferdinand Wüstenfeld]]'s ''Specimen el-Lobabi'', Göttingen, 1835).

The '''Mailuan languages''' are a small family of [[Trans&amp;ndash;New Guinea languages]] spoken in the "[[Bird's Tail]]" (southeastern peninsula) of New Guinea. They are sometimes included in a speculative [[Southeast Papuan languages|Southeast Papuan]] branch of Trans&amp;ndash;New Guinea (TNG), but the Southeast Papuan families have not been shown to be any more closely related to each other than they are to other TNG families.

The languages are,
*[[Domu language|Domu]], [[Binahari language|Binahari]]–Binahari-Ma, [[Morawa language|Morawa]], [[Mailu language|Mailu]] (Magi), [[Laua language|Laua]]

[[Bauwaki language|Bauwaki]]–O'oku is closely related to the Mailuan languages.

All share about 50% vocabulary.  Pronouns are:

:{|
! !!sg!!du!!pl
|-
!1
|*i||*gu-||*ge
|-
!2
|*ga||*[y]a||*[y]a, *mee
|-
!3
| ||*emu
|}

Dutton (1971) said Bauwaki was a link to the [[Yareban languages]]. It has greater lexical similarity with [[Aneme Wake language|Aneme Wake]] (Yareban) than the closest Mailuan language, Domu.  Magi shows evidence of [[language shift]] from an Oceanic language in a large number of Oceanic words.

{{Semiotics}}

In [[semiotics]], the '''meaning''' of a sign is its place in a [[sign relation]], in other words, the set of roles that it occupies within a given sign relation.  

This statement holds whether ''sign'' is taken to mean a ''sign type'' or a ''sign token''.  Defined in these global terms, the meaning of a sign is not in general analyzable with full exactness into completely localized terms, but aspects of its meaning can be given approximate analyses, and special cases of sign relations frequently admit of more local analyses.

Two aspects of meaning that may be given approximate analyses are the ''connotative relation'' and the ''denotative relation''.  The connotative relation is the relation between signs and their interpretant signs.  The denotative relation is the relation between signs and objects. An arbitrary association exists between the ''signified'' and the ''signifier.''
For example, a US salesperson doing business in [[Etiquette in Japan|Japan]] might interpret [[silence]] following an offer as rejection, while to Japanese negotiators silence means the offer is being considered. This difference in interpretations represents a difference in: semiotics

==Triadic relation==
The triadic (three part) model of the sign separates the meaning of a sign into three distinct components:

1.The representamen, which is the medium, or ‘sign vehicle’,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Summer 2013|title = Peirce's Theory of Signs|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/peirce-semiotics/|date = 2013-01-01|first = Albert|last = Atkin|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt; through which the sign is represented. For example, this could be written/spoken words, a photograph, or a painting.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Semiotics: The Basics|last = Chandler|first = Daniel|publisher = Routledge|year = 2002|isbn = 0-415-35111-1|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2.The interpretant, or what is meant by the sign &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

3. The object, or that to which the sign refers &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Together, these three components generate [[semiosis]]. For example, an exclamation mark can be broken down into these components. The representamen is the exclamation mark itself, the interpretant is the idea of excitement or an elevated volume of speech, and the object is the actual excitement or elevated volume of speech to which it refers.
While it might appear that the latter two are the same, the subtle difference lies in the fact that the interpretant refers to the idea of something, and the object is the thing itself.

The representamen component of the sign can be further broken down into three categories, which are icon, index, and symbol.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These denote the degree of abstraction from the object to which they refer. A symbol, which is the most abstract, does not resemble or bear any physical relation to the thing that it represents in any way. For example, a peace sign has no relation to peace aside from its social construction as a symbol that represents it. An icon is slightly less abstract, and resembles to some degree the thing that it represents, and bears some physical likeness to it. A good example of this would be a painted portrait. An index is the least arbitrary category of representamen, and has a definite physical tie to that which it represents. This could be something like a weather vane blowing in the wind indicating that it is windy out, or smoke, which indicates a fire.

The triadic model of the sign was proposed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]]. In contradistinction to [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s dyadic model, which assumed no material referent, Peirce's model assumes that in order for a sign to be meaningful, it must refer to something external and cannot be self-contained, as it is for Saussure. Thus, Peirce's model includes the addition of an 'object'. The ‘representamen’ and ‘interpretant’ components of the triadic model are comparable to Saussure’s dyadic model of the sign, which breaks down into signifier and signified.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The concept of the '''metaphysics of presence''' is an important consideration in [[deconstruction]]. Deconstructive [[Interpretation (philosophy)|interpretation]] holds that the entire [[history of philosophy|history]] of [[Western philosophy]] with its language and traditions has emphasized the desire for immediate access to [[meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]], and thus built a [[metaphysics]] or [[ontotheology]] based on privileging presence over [[Nonexistence|absence]].

==Overview==
In ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927; transl. 1962), [[Martin Heidegger]] argues that the concept of time prevalent in all Western thought has largely remained unchanged since the definition offered by [[Aristotle]] in the ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]''. Heidegger says, "[[Aristotle]]'s essay on time is the first detailed Interpretation of this phenomenon [time] which has come down to us. Every subsequent account of time, including [[Henri Bergson]]'s, has been [[essentialism|essentially]] determined by it."&lt;ref name=:0&gt;''Being and Time'' (1962), §6, 26&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle defined time as "the number of movement in respect of before and after".&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'', Book IV, part 11&lt;/ref&gt; By defining time in this way Aristotle privileges what is [[Heideggerian terminology|present-at-hand]], namely the "presence" of time. Heidegger argues in response that "entities are grasped in their Being as 'presence'; this means that they are understood with regard to a definite mode of time – the 'Present'".&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; Central to Heidegger's own philosophical project is the attempt to gain a more authentic understanding of time. Heidegger considers time to be the unity of three [[Ecstasy (philosophy)#Existential philosophy|ecstases]]: the past, the present, and the future. 

Deconstructive thinkers, like [[Jacques Derrida]], describe their task as the questioning or ''deconstruction'' of this metaphysical tendency in Western philosophy. Derrida writes, &lt;blockquote&gt;"Without a doubt, Aristotle thinks of time on the basis of [[Ousia#Philosophy|ousia]] as [[parousia]], on the basis of the now, the point, etc. And yet an entire reading could be organized that would repeat in Aristotle's text both this limitation and its opposite."&lt;ref&gt;"Ousia and Grammē: Note on a Note from 'Being and Time,'" in ''Margins of Philosophy'' (1972), 29–67: 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; This argument is largely based on the earlier work of Heidegger, who in ''Being and Time'' claimed that the theoretical attitude of pure presence is parasitical upon a more originary involvement with the world in concepts such as the [[ready-to-hand]] and [[being-with]].

The presence to which Heidegger refers is both a presence as in a "now" and also a presence as in an eternal present, as one might associate with God or the "eternal" [[Physical law|laws of science]]. This [[hypostatized]] (underlying) belief in presence is undermined by novel [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] ideas, such that presence itself does not subsist, but comes about primordially through the action of our futural projection, our realization of [[finitude]] and the reception or rejection of the traditions of our time.

'''Mohit Chattopadhyaya''' (also spelled '''Mohit Chattopadhyay''') (1 June 1934 – 12 April 2012) was a Bengali Indian playwright, screenwriter, dramatist and poet. He was a leading figure in modern Indian drama. Mohit Chottopadhya died on 12 April 2012. He had been suffering from cancer.

==Early life==
Mohit Chattopadhyaya was born in the town of [[Barisal]], now in [[Bangladesh]].  He left Bangladesh and immigrated to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] (Kolkata) with his family at the age of thirteen. An avid reader, he started writing as a young boy. In Kolkata, he was a frequent visitor of Chaitanya Library, near his home at Bidon Street. In the library he stumbled upon ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]'' by [[Luigi Pirandello]], his first contact with an [[Theatre of the Absurd|absurd play]]. He finished his Matriculation examination in 1950 and joined [[City College, Kolkata]]. While studying in City College he became close to culturally like-minded people, who became prominent poets, authors, artists in their later lives. He became close friend with [[Sunil Gangopadhyay|Sunil Gongopadhyay]], Shibshmbhu Pal, [[Soumitra Chatterjee]], [[Sandipan Chattopadhyay]], [[Shakti Chattopadhyay|Shakti Chattopadhay]]. He earned his Masters in Bengali literature as a private candidate from [[University of Calcutta]]. His career in academia began as a lecturer at Jangipur College, [[Murshidabad]] and later as a Reader of Bengali Literature at City College.

==Literary work==

Mohit Chattopadhyaya started his literary career as a poet and later shifted to writing plays. He started writing prose poetry along with his friends, and had little interest in rhyming. At first his poetry was published in various magazines and shortly it was published in book format as his anthology of poems.

Subsequently, he stopped writing poems and devoted entirely to writing plays. From the very beginning he avoided writing realistic plays and wrote esoteric often highly political plays. Though he refused to be labelled as an Absurdist playwright, claiming his plays do not conform to the Philosophy of [[Theatre of the Absurd|"The Theatre of the Absurd"]] but frequently he is referred as an exponent of Indian Absurd Drama. The cryptic nature of his plays encouraged critics to call his plays "Kimitibadi" (Kim+Iti) in Bengali, which in English meant, "What is it?”

As a prolific playwright he has written over one hundred plays. Some of his plays have been translated in different languages and have been regularly performed by various theatre groups around India. Other than full-length plays, Mohit Chattopadhyaya has written One Act plays, Verse plays Curtain Raisers, Microplays; he has adapted, edited and translated a number of plays in Bengali from other languages.

His play ''Raajrakto'' (Guinea pig) is considered as a milestone in the history of Bengali political drama. Kolkata based theatre group Theatre Workshop under the direction of Bibhash Chokrobarty first performed the play in Kolkata. Later the play was translated into various languages. In Delhi Rajindernath directed the Hindi version. Famous actor [[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]] acted in the play. In Mumbai, Satyadeb Dubey directed the play and [[Amrish Puri]] acted in it. [[Amol Palekar]] acted in the Marathi version and Shymanand Jalan produced another Hindi version of the play. For political reasons the production was banned by The Indian Government.

==Film scripts and television scripts==

In 1973 Mohit Chattopadhyaya started working on the film script of ''Chorus'' in close collaboration with [[Mrinal Sen]]. He also wrote the lyrics of the songs used in the film. In the following years he wrote the screenplays of four films by Mrinal Sen, ''Mrigaya'' (1976)
''Poroshuraam'' (1980), ''Oka Uri Katha'' (1977), ''Genesis'' (1986); all the films received numerous awards in national and International film festivals. In 1997 he wrote the screenplay and the lyrics of the film, ''Damu'', which received National Award for best children's film and various other awards.

In 1980 Mohit Chattopadhyaya finished his first and only directorial endeavour, ''Megher Khela''  (The Play of The Clouds), a children's film. He wrote the story and the screenplay. [[Raja Sen]], who would become an accomplished film director later, was the assistant director; Ranajit Ray was the Cinematographer; Debashish Dasgupta was the Music Director and Mrinmoy Chakrobarty was in charge of editing. The film received critical acclaim. It was shown in various national and international film festivals and got honorary mention at Bucharest Children's Film Festival. Austrian National Television bought the film rights and telecast it in its National Channel.

Mohit Chattopadhyaya started writing scripts for TV serial (TV Series) in the following years. Raja Sen directed almost all his early TV scripts. ''Subarnolata'', ''Arogyonikatan'', ''Adorsho Hindu Hotel'' marked one of the most popular and critically acclaimed television serials on Kolkata [[Doordarshan]]. He continued writing scripts and worked with other directors in later period.

==Other work==

Mohit Chattopadhyay has also written numerous essays, articles and papers on theatre, film production, and scriptwriting. One of his most controversial series of essays has been on the relationship between literature and drama. He has taken part in various seminars, talks, workshops and panel discussions on literature and performing arts. He is also the Executive Member of Paschimbanga Natya Academy.

==Honors and awards==

The recipient of scores of awards and felicitations, Mohit Chattopadhyay received the Sangeet Natak Academy Award in 1991. Among other awards he is the recipient of [[Girish Chandra Ghosh|Girish]] Award, West Bengal State Award, BFJA Award, [[Nandikar|Nandikaar]] Award. He is also conferred with [[Sangeet Natak Akademi Tagore Ratna]], special awards to commemorate 150th birth anniversary of [[Rabindranath Tagore]]

'''Piaroa''' (also called ''Guagua ~ Kuakua ~ Quaqua, Adole ~ Ature, Wo’tiheh'') is an indigenous language of [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]], native to the [[Piaroa people]]. 

A ''[[Wirö language]]'' (commonly called ''Maco'') is sometimes listed separately, or left unclassified. It is very poorly attested, but the few words which are known are enough to show it is a dialect of Piaroa, or at least very closely related (Hammarström 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Harald Hammarström, 2010, 'The status of the least documented language families in the world'.

The '''Polabian language''' is an [[extinct language|extinct]] [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic]] language that was spoken by the [[Polabian Slavs]] ({{lang-de|Wenden}}) in present-day northeastern [[Germany]] around the [[Elbe]] (''Labe'' in Slavic) river, from which derives its name ("po Labe" - ''on the Elbe''). It was spoken approximately until the mid-18th century, when it was superseded by [[Low German]], in the areas of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Mecklenburg-West Pomerania]], central [[Brandenburg]] ([[Mittelmark]]) and eastern [[Saxony-Anhalt]] ([[Wittenberg (district)|Wittenberg]]), as well as in eastern parts of [[Lower Saxony]] ([[Lüchow-Dannenberg|Wendland]]) and [[Schleswig-Holstein]] ([[Ostholstein]] and [[Herzogtum Lauenburg|Lauenburg]]). In the south it bordered on the [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian language]] area in [[Lusatia]].

By the 18th century [[Lechitic languages|Lechitic]] Polabian was in some respects markedly different from other [[Slavic languages]], most notably in having a strong [[German language|German]] influence. It was close to [[Pomeranian language|Pomeranian]] and [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]], and attested only in a handful of manuscripts, dictionaries and various writings from the 17th and 18th centuries. As can be seen in the comparisons of the Lord's Prayer below, Polabian contained many German [[loanwords]], such as ''Wader'' (Father) and ''Rîk'' (Kingdom).

==History==
About 2800 Polabian words are known; of prose writings, only a few prayers, one wedding song and a few folktales survive. Immediately before the language became extinct, several people started to collect phrases and compile wordlists and were engaged with folklore of the [[Polabian Slavs]], but only one of them appears to have been a native speaker of Polabian (himself leaving only 13 pages of linguistically relevant material from a 310-page manuscript).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kapović|2008|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last native speaker of Polabian, a woman, died in 1756, and the last person who spoke limited Polabian died in 1825.

The most important monument of the language is the so-called ''Vocabularium Venedicum'' (1679–1719) by Christian Hennig.

The language left many traces to this day in toponymy; for example, [[Wustrow, Lower Saxony|Wustrow]] "Place on the island", [[Lüchow]] (Polabian: ''Ljauchüw''), [[Sagard]], [[Gartow]] etc. It is also a likely origin of the name [[wikt:Berlin|Berlin]], from the Polabian stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' ("swamp").

The [[Lord's Prayer]] in Polabian and related [[Lechitic languages]], compared to German and English:&lt;ref&gt;Polabian version quoted after [http://titus.uni-frankfurt.de/didact/idg/slav/polabbs.htm#EN3 TITUS project]&lt;/ref&gt; Germanic loanwords, which are comparatively rare in the other West Slavic languages, are highlighted in '''bold'''. (Even English, which has extensive Latin influence, has only three Latinate loanwords in its version: "trespass[es]", "temptation", and "deliver".)

The neologism '''pre-tirement''' describes the emergence of a new working state, positioned between the traditional states of [[employment]] and [[retirement]]. The word is a [[portmanteau]] word, coming from the prefix "pre" and the word "retirement". The state is being found primarily in first world economies, with aging populations. A "Pre-tireree" will continue to create economic wealth and/or contribute to the generation of knowledge by research, likely on a part-time or reduced hours basis. Some "Pre-tirerees" use the period to give back by providing unpaid social support. This form of [[unpaid work]] creates economic benefit, by allowing taxes to be focused on other wealth creating or protecting activities, but relies on the existence of sufficient financial resource.

== Research ==
The emergence of a new blend of work and retirement was established in Consumer Intelligence research in December 2014. 
Here are key findings from the research published in a report by Zopa (2014):&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdn.zopa.com/pressrelease/2014/britons_opt_for_pretirement_overtotal_retirement.pdf "Britons opt for Pre-tirement over Total Retirement"]&lt;/ref&gt;

* ‘Pre-tirement’ begins in 50s and runs well into 70s, as Britons ease themselves into retirement
* Britons cut working hours earlier in life, but continue in paid employment for longer: 17% of over-65s are still in paid employment and 30% of them are in unpaid employment
* 89% of 50- to 54-year-olds say they do not know when they will retire, and 35% expect to retire later
* Only 24% of those 55–64 said they would be financially secure if they had to retire immediately
* Giles Andrews, Zopa CEO:  'Retirement is no longer about clearing your desk on your 65th birthday'

The concept appears to be similar to semi-retirement, but the term indicates a half retirement form, without indicating the gradual shift towards a fully retired end state or the non-existence of retirement.

One position that may be extrapolated from the research is that a growing number of individuals hope to be healthy enough to get Pre-tirement until they die.

== Causes and effects==
While the research shows that a number of individuals chose to shift to this state, it also shows the existence of Enforced Pre-tirement,  individuals a pension that will support their living costs. Further research will be needed to establish the different types of Pre-tirement states, and their root causes.

The use of the term retirement to encompass Pre-tirement would hide this emerging state.

Effects of different forms of work retirement balance have not yet been fully researched.
Early findings show that an abrupt shift from Full Time Work to Full Time Retirement can cause depression and other negative health effects.

Consideration of the positive benefits of Pre-tirement are likely to be accelerated as the impact of the aging population starts to take deeper effect.

== Usage ==
First found in a Blog by The Martian Observer (2010) The Blog's use of the neologism matches the term described in the Zopa Report.

First used in a book title by Kris Miller (2012),&lt;ref&gt;"Ready for Pretirement: 3 Secrets for Safe Money and a Fabulous Future"[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1614481253/ref=cm_sw_su_dp]&lt;/ref&gt; though her usage describes planning for retirement, rather than an emerging state of employment.

The ACAS website referred the important shift in retirement norms observed in the Zopa Report: "many people are choosing to ease into retirement in a 'phased or gradual process'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=5166 "Gradual 'pre-tirement' is 'here to stay'"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Use  of the neologism in news publications peaked after the publication of the Zopa Report.
&lt;ref&gt;"Guardian: What is pre-tirement? A way for the over-50s to stagger (towards) retirement"[https://www.theguardian.com/money/shortcuts/2014/dec/21/what-is-pretirement-way-for-over-50s-stagger-retirement]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;"Daily Express: Gearing up for Pre-tirement the new trend for over 50's"[http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/property/556336/Reducing-working-hours-50-new-british-retirement-trend]&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage has been heard on the Radio 4 Today Program 
March 2015 Esther Rantzen used the term when discussing [[The Silver Line]].

A '''savings stamp''' is a stamp issued by a government or other body to enable small amounts of money to be saved over time to accumulate a larger capital sum. The funds accumulated may then be used to make a larger purchase such as taking out a savings bond or to pay a large upcoming bill. Often issued in conjunction with post office run savings banks, savings stamps have also been issued by private companies. Supermarkets have issued the stamps to enable the spreading of large bills, [[package holiday]] companies have used them to enable customers to save for an annual holiday, and utilities companies have used the stamps to enable customers to spread the cost of their bills.

Savings stamps are not to be confused with [[trading stamp]]s which provide a discount on goods purchased as part of a customer [[loyalty program]].

In [[philately]], savings stamps are regarded as a form of [[Cinderella stamp]].

==In the United Kingdom==
From 1880&lt;ref&gt;*Jones, Lionel D. ''United Kingdom Savings Stamps, Labels and Coupons: A survey of small savings available to the working classes of Great Britain and Northern Ireland including a detailed listing of labels, coupons and stamps issued on a national basis''. London: [[Cinderella Stamp Club|The Cinderella Stamp Club]], 1979, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; ordinary penny [[postage stamp]]s were used to save up one shilling (12 pence) which was then sufficient to open a [[Post Office Savings Bank]] account, although the minimum amount required changed to £1 in 1912.&lt;ref name=mack&gt;[[James A. Mackay|Mackay, James]]. ''Stamp Collecting: Philatelic Terms Illustrated''. 4th edition. London: [[Stanley Gibbons]], 2003, p.133. {{ISBN|0-85259-557-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scheme continued until after the Second World War but has now ended. In addition the Bank used specially designed savings stamps with higher values which also could be used to save enough to open an account.

Private companies in Britain also used savings stamps including the holiday company [[Butlins]] and supermarkets such as [[Sainsburys]] and [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]].

A wide variety of utility companies made use of the stamps, particularly regional electronic companies, but also [[British Telecom]] for telephone bills and government bodies for payment of [[National Insurance]] contributions or [[television licence]]s.

Most uses of savings stamps have now ceased in the UK, replaced by electronic cards.

==In the United States==
{{Expand section|date=June 2011}}
In the United States ''Postal Savings Stamps'' were introduced in 1911 &lt;ref name=mack/&gt; and [[War savings stamps of the United States|War Savings Stamps]] were issued during both World Wars. Savings stamps are worth their face amounts; the denominations are $0.10, $0.25, $0.50, $1, and $5. The sale of savings stamps was discontinued June 30, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arago.si.edu/category_2029611.html Savings Stamps] Smithsonian, National Postal Museum, Arago - People, Postage &amp; the Post (retrieved 17 December 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elsewhere==
{{Expand section|date=June 2011}}
Belgium and France used special savings stamps in the 1880s&lt;ref name=mack/&gt; and many other countries around the world have used them for diverse purposes, including Canada, India, Russia, Bulgaria and Singapore.

==War savings stamps==
War savings stamps were issued by several British Commonwealth countries, including [[Postage stamps and postal history of Ghana|Gold Coast]]&lt;ref&gt;''Temple Bar Auctions Postal Sale 81''. Bristol: Bridger &amp; Kay, 2013, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Gold Coast War Savings" in ''Sixth Sense'', Murray Payne Ltd., Axbridge, No. 102, August 2013, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; and India.

'''"Sexy baby voice"''' is an [[English language]] speech pattern or [[sociolect]], first described by U.S. media in 2013, in which young women affect the [[Pitch (music)|high-pitched]] voice of [[pre-pubescent]] girls.

==Features==
The speech patterns at issue are described as sounding "like [[Minnie Mouse]] on helium",&lt;ref name="Washington Post 10 August 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hornaday|first=Ann|title=Lake Bell talks about ‘In a World . . .’ and the politics of dialect|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/lake-bell-talks-about-in-a-world--and-the-politics-of-dialect/2013/08/08/71eb5ed0-ff76-11e2-96a8-d3b921c0924a_story.html|accessdate=1 March 2014|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or a "mousy squeak [with a] handful of [[Vocal fry|gravel]] tossed across the very top of the register".&lt;ref name="Hollywood Prospectus 13 August 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lynch|first=Tess|title=Talk Like a Woman: Lake Bell vs. 'Sexy Baby Voice'|url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/talk-like-a-woman-lake-bell-vs-sexy-baby-voice/|accessdate=1 March 2014|newspaper=[[Grantland]]|date=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actress [[Lake Bell]] described the style as an amalgamation of "[[Valleyspeak|valley-girl voice]]" (characterized by "[[upspeak]]" and [[vocal fry]]) and high pitch.&lt;ref name="Washington Post 10 August 2013" /&gt;

==Controversy==
"Sexy baby voice" is controversial in the context of discussions about [[gender equality]] and related issues. Bell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grose|first=Jessica|title=Why Is Lake Bell Dissing Women’s Voices?|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/08/09/lake_bell_s_in_a_world_is_a_movie_about_women_in_the_voiceover_world_so.html|accessdate=1 March 2014|newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others have argued that the use of "sexy baby voice" is problematic because it demeans the speaker, who appears as a "submissive 12-year-old trying to be a sex object",&lt;ref name="Hollywood Prospectus 13 August 2013" /&gt; or because its use in film and television, as a tool of sexual manipulation, exploits contemporary culture's "fetish for adult sexuality wrapped in adolescent packages".&lt;ref name="The Atlantic 18 February 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lahey|first=Jessica|title=Why Middle-School Girls Sometimes Talk Like Babies: And how teachers can respond|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/02/why-middle-school-girls-sometimes-talk-like-babies/283894/|accessdate=1 March 2014|newspaper=[[The Atlantic]]|date=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other commentators questioned the purpose of critiquing the use of the speech pattern, asserting that "picking at the vocal quirks of your own gender is just as much of a nuisance as harping on the bodies that belong to them".&lt;ref name="Hollywood Prospectus 13 August 2013" /&gt; [[Phonetician]] [[Mark Liberman]] wrote that it was not clear that the discussion about "sexy baby voice" referred to a specific speech style rather than just a "long list" of vocal features people objected to in female speech. He also noted previous discussions about similar female speech patterns in earlier decades, such as a controversy about "[[uptalk]]" in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Language Log 15 August 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Liberman|first=Mark|title=Sexy baby vocal virus|url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=5842|accessdate=1 March 2014|newspaper=[[Language Log]]|date=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main research fields of Stefan Gandler are the [[Critical theory]] of the [[Frankfurt School]], the critical [[Western Marxism|''western'' Marxism]], philosophy in Latin America, [[Critique of ideology]] and [[Walter Benjamin]].&lt;ref&gt;"With sixteen
books and over 150 articles published on critical theory, German philosophy, and Marxism in the Americas, Stefan Gandler is certainly worthy of study by anyone interested in this complex philosophical tradition, especially as it has been encountered and furthered by philosophers south of the U.S.–Mexican border." (Carlos Alberto Sánchez: [http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.apaonline.org/resource/collection/60044C96-F3E0-4049-BC5A-271C673FA1E5/HispanicV14n1.pdf ''From the editor.''] In: ''APA Newsletter on Hispanic/Latino Issues in Philosophy'', American Philosophical Association, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, vol. 14, no. 1, fall 2014, p. 1. {{ISSN|2155-9708}}.) Sánchez calls Gandler a ''exemplary, contemporary Latin American philosopher.''&lt;/ref&gt; He worked also as translator of  philosophical texts between Spanish and German and published texts on Today's Germany and the National Socialism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2006/06/18/sem-stefan.html See for example: ''Alemania: antes y después de Shoah.''

'''''Utend̠i wa Tambuka''''' or '''''Utenzi wa Tambuk''a'''&lt;ref&gt;The symbol ''d̠'' is a transliteration of the Arabic for the Swahili sound ''dh'' ({{IPA|[ð]}}). Often this sound is written simply ''z'', hence the different spellings.&lt;/ref&gt; ("The Story of Tambuka"), also known as '''''Kyuo kya Hereḳali''''' (the book of Heraclius), is an [[epic poem]] in the [[Swahili language]], dated 1728. It is one of the earliest known documents in Swahili. 

Known by various titles in English, including ''The Book of the Battle of Tambuka'' and ''The Story of Heraclius'', the story recounts numerous events of the [[Byzantine-Arab Wars]] and [[Byzantine-Ottoman wars|Byzantine-Ottoman Wars]] between the [[Muslims]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Romans]] (the contemporary name for the Byzantines). The Byzantines were represented by the Emperor of the Byzantine Empire, [[Heraclius]]. The story covers a period from 628 (the [[Battle of Mu'tah]]) to 1453 (the [[Fall of Constantinople]]).&lt;ref&gt;Knappert 1977:8.&lt;/ref&gt; "Tambuka" is the Swahili rendering of [[Tabuk, Saudi Arabia|Tabuk]], a city located in north-western [[Saudi Arabia]].
The oldest manuscript of the epic is dated 1141 on the [[Islamic Calendar]], corresponding to AD 1728. It was written at Yunga, a royal palace in the old city of [[Pate Island#Pate Town|Pate]] (the palace has since been destroyed). In strophe 1124–1125, the author notes that the "king of Yung"' (that is, the then [[Rulers of Pate|Sultan of Pate]]) asked him to write an epic on the heroic deeds of the first followers of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The author identifies himself in one of the final stanzas (1146) as Mwengo, son of Athumani or Osman. Not much more is known about him other than that he wrote at the court of the Sultan of Pate, that he was no longer a young man by 1728, and that some other poems are ascribed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Knappert 1977:15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a son, Abu Bakr bin Mwengo, who wrote an imitation of his father's epic somewhere in the middle of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Knappert 1969:81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other manuscripts of the period in Swahili, the ''Utendi wa Tambuka'' is written in [[Arabic script]]. The language used is a northern dialect of Swahili called [[Kiamu]]; some manuscripts, however, show influence from Kigunya (another northern dialect), while others show traces of Kiunguja, the dialect of [[Zanzibar]].&lt;ref&gt;Knappert 1977:9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
The ''Utendi wa Tambuka'' is a prime example of the Swahili poetic form of ''[[utenzi]]''. Utenzi verse form consists of four-line [[stanza]]s, with each line having eight syllables. The last syllables of the first three lines rhyme with each other, while the fourth line has a rhyme that is constant throughout the whole of the epic. This last rhyme thus serves to tie all stanzas of the epic together. Most Swahili words have penultimate stress, resulting in every line having at least penultimate stress. Within a line of eight syllables there are no further [[meter (poetry)|meter]] requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Knappert 1977:30–32.&lt;/ref&gt; The verse form can be illustrated by the first stanza of the poem:&lt;ref&gt;In Knappert's Latin transcription, based on the Arabic manuscript ''U''.&lt;/ref&gt;)

:Bisimillahi kut&amp;#x320;ubu
:yina la Mola Wahhabu
:Arrah&amp;#x323;amani eribu
:na Arrah&amp;#x323;imu ukyowa

The first three lines all end in ''-bu''. The last syllable of the fourth line ends in the vowel ''a'', and this sound is found at the end of every stanza of the poem. When recited, this last syllable is sustained for some time and given emphasis.

==Content==

The plot depicts a religious war between the Byzantines and the Muslims. The Prophet sends a letter to [[East Roman]]/[[Byzantine]] Emperor [[Heraclius]], in which he tells him that the Byzantine belief that Jesus is the son of God is incorrect. Heraclius declares his intent to persevere in his adherence to Christianity on the grounds that the Byzantines have inherited their belief from their ancestors. The Muslims attack and, after epic struggles, eventually defeat the Byzantines. Heraclius' minister and his associates are captured and once again given the choice to accept Islam or die; they refuse to be converted and are executed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mercury.soas.ac.uk/perl/Project/showSwahiliItem.pl?ref=MS%2045022a Summary of the plot of the poem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165114/http://mercury.soas.ac.uk/perl/Project/showSwahiliItem.pl?ref=MS%2045022a |date=30 September 2007 }} at the Swahili Manuscripts Project at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] of London.&lt;/ref&gt;

The central figure of the poem, and the most heroic one, is [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], a full nephew on the father's side of [[Muhammad|the Prophet]]. He is nicknamed ''Haidar'', the lion, and in the course of the poem many other praise names are applied to him. Ali was married to the noble daughter of the prophet [[Muhammad]], Fatimah.

The second hero in order of magnitude is [[Umar]] ibn al-Khattab.

The '''Velotrace''', first described in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;Horiguchi S., Bell-Berti F. (1987.) "The Velotrace: a device for monitoring velar position", ''Cleft Palate J'', 24(2):104-11.&lt;/ref&gt; is a mechanical device that monitors and records [[Analog signal|analogue data]] on the position of the [[soft palate]], or velum. The device comprises two levels connected through a "push rod" that carried on a "support rod", which itself rests on the floor of the [[nasal cavity]]. The internal lever rests on the nasal surface of the soft palate, and the external lever deflects toward the speaker when the internal level deflects upwards. Changes in position and motion are monitored and can be recorded with an [[Optoelectronics|optoelectronic]] [[camera]] and a [[tape recorder]].&lt;ref&gt;Bell-Berti F., Krakow R. A., Ross D., Hroiguchi S. (1993.) "The rise and fall of the soft palate: the Velotrace", ''J Acoust Soc Am'', 93(4):2416.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Velotrace can provide information about the pattern, timing, and coordination of movement of the soft palate during speech and swallowing.&lt;ref&gt;Baken R. J., Orlikoff R. F. (2000.)

In the [[game]] of '''Vish''' (short for [[Begging the question|vicious circle]]), players compete to find circularity in dictionary [[Definition#Limitations of definition|definitions]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QxkLAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=vish&amp;pgis=1#search Synge, ''Science: Sense and Nonsense'', p. 23-24, p. 32.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irish people|Irish]] [[mathematician]] and [[physicist]], [[John Lighton Synge]], invented the multi-player, [[referee]]d game to emphasize the [[circular reasoning]] implicit in the defining process of any standard [[dictionary]].

==Procedure==
#Each of the [[player (game)|player]]s is given a copy of the same standard dictionary;
#The referee gives each a slip of paper with the same word (found in this dictionary) written on each slip—word chosen so that it has [[synonym]]s in its definition, but (preferably) the definition of any synonym does not (in that dictionary) list a synonym which is the originally assigned word;
#At "Go!", each looks up the assigned word, finds a synonym, looks that up, finds a synonym, etc.;
#The first player to be led, by this synonymous process, back to the originally assigned word cries "Vish!" and wins the game (unless his opponent successfully challenges the procedure of the alleged winner).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4309">"'''Winning isn’t everything; it's the only thing'''" is a well-known quotation in sports. It is attributed to [[UCLA Bruins football]] coach [[Henry Russell Sanders|Henry Russell ("Red") Sanders]], who spoke two different versions of the quotation. In 1950, at a [[Cal Poly San Luis Obispo]] physical education workshop, Sanders told his group: "Men, I'll be honest. Winning isn't everything", then following a long pause, "Men, it's the only thing!"&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, Art – INDIANS FAR FROM BASHFUL AT CHOW, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Oct 18, 1950. p. C3 (1 page)&lt;/ref&gt;  In a three-part article, December 7, 1953, on Red Sanders, by Bud Furillo of the ''[[Los Angeles Herald and Express]]'', the phrase is quoted in the sub head. Furillo said in his unpublished memoirs Sanders first made the statement to him after UCLA's loss to USC in 1949. The phrase is quoted in the 1953 film ''[[Trouble Along the Way]]'' by [[Sherry Jackson]]'s character, Carol Williams.  In 1955, in a ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' article preceding the [[1956 Rose Bowl]], he was quoted as saying "Sure, winning isn't every thing; it's the only thing."&lt;ref&gt;Sayre, Joe – He Flies On One Wing. ''Sports Illustrated'', December 26, 1955. Quote: ''Not that he is philosophical about losing. "Sure, winning isn't every thing", he once declared. "It's the only thing."''&lt;/ref&gt;

The quotation is widely, but wrongly attributed to American football coach [[Vince Lombardi]], who probably heard the phrase from UCLA coach Sanders.&lt;ref name="Maraniss"&gt;Maraniss, David&lt;/ref&gt;  Lombardi is on record using the quotation as early as 1959 in his opening talk on the first day of the Packers’ training camp.&lt;ref name="Maraniss" /&gt;  The quotation captured the American public's attention during Lombardi's highly successful reign as coach of the Packers in the 1960s.  Over time, the quotation took on a life of its own.  The words graced the walls of locker rooms, ignited pre-game pep talks, and echoed from the rafters of banquet halls.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} According to the late [[James Michener]]'s ''Sports in America'', Lombardi claimed to have been misquoted. What he intended to say was "Winning isn't everything. The will to win is the only thing."&lt;ref name="Michener"&gt;Michener, James A.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lombardi is on record repeating the original version of the quotation on several occasions.&lt;ref name="Overman"&gt;Overman, Steven J.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its assertion about the importance of winning has been touted as a basic tenet of the American sports creed{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} and, at the same time, identified as encapsulating what is purportedly wrong with competitive sports.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  
This credo has served as counterpoint to the well known sentiment by sports journalist [[Grantland Rice]] that, "it's not that you won or lost but how you played the game", and to the modern Olympic creed expressed by its founder [[Pierre de Coubertin]]: "The most important thing. . . is not winning but taking part".

While at UCLA, another famous quote was attributed to Sanders regarding the [[UCLA–USC rivalry]], "Beating 'SC is not a matter of life or death, it's more important than that."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/dept/pubrel/trojan_family/autumn04/F2_USCvsUCLA.html ''The Start of Something Big: USC vs. UCLA''] by Lonnie White, marking 75 years of the UCLA–USC rivalry&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Anne (Editor) – [http://www.magazine.ucla.edu/year2004/summer04_09_03.html Summer 2004 Bruin Walk: Rah-rah Boo-hiss].

'''Ádhamh Cúisín''', Irish [[scribe]] and [[genealogist]], fl. c. 1400.

==Life and career==

Ádhamh Cúisín is the name of one of some ten scribes who compiled the Book of Uí Maine.

His name seems to be of Norman origin, the [[Annals of the Four Masters]] noting that King [[Ruaidrí Ó Gadhra]] of [[Sliabh Lugha]] was killed in 1256 by ''"David, son of Richard Cuisin."'' The [[Annals of Connacht]] under 1270 records that ''"The Earl and the Connacht Galls made great raids in Tirerrill on the people of Aed O Conchobair. David Cusin was killed on this raid."''

David Cuisin or Cusin possessed a castle and land near [[Ballaghaderreen]]. Another bearer of the name was Tomás Cúisín, listed under 1462 in the [[Annals of Ulster]] as "the best master of law in his time in [[Armagh]] who had a great school in this year." It is unknown if either of the latter two were related to Ádhamh.

Ádhamh Cúisín has been noted by Ó Muraíle as "the most prolific of the scribes in the portion of the manuscript that still survives - his hand appears on 99 of the extant [[wikt:folio|folios]]). The manuscript was known to contain 368 folios in the 15th and 16th centuries. Two hundred and fifty years later, [[Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh]] transcribed a seventy-page historical-genealogical compilation called Seanchas Síl Ír.  His source can be shown to be The Book of Uí Mhaine. Mac Fhirbhisigh's very faithful transcript is especially valuable as four of the original fourteen folios have since been lost.

The book began to be written some time before 1392-1394, and some time after that date. It was written at the behest of [[Muircheartach Ó Cellaigh]], who was [[Bishop of Clonfert]] (1378–1393) and [[Archbishop of Tuam]] till his death in 1407. Bishop Ó Cellaigh was a grandnephew of [[Uilliam Buidhe Ó Cellaigh]], king of [[Uí Maine]] from about 1349 to 1381.

The only other scribe of the book known by name is [[Faolán Mac an Ghabhann na Scéal]], who died in 1423. A poet, Mac an Ghabhann's poem ''Adham ar n-athair uile'' is penned by Cúisín.
