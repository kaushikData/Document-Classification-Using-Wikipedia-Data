'''Abdul Kahar Muzakkar''' was the leader of an Islamic movement in [[South Sulawesi]] from 1950 till his death in 1965. He led his group of men in a guerrilla warfare against the Indonesian central government, and was finally killed by the army in the jungle. He was also the leader of the South Sulawesi branch of the [[Darul Islam (Indonesia)|Darul Islam]] movement.

== Early life [1920-1943] ==
Born on 24 March 1920 in the Kingdom of [[Luwu]], a smaller principality on the northern end of the Gulf of Bone,&lt;ref name="Chaidar 1999"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Chaidar| first =A|  title =Pemikiran politik proklamator negara islam indonesia s.m. kartosuwirjo.| publisher = Indonesia: Darul Falah.| year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdul Kahar Muzakkar was formerly known as Ladomeng. Ladomeng is a Buginese word derived from 'dominoes', an allusion to his father who was playing cards at the time he was born.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Hamdan| first =J.|  title =The struggle for formalist islam in south sulawesi: From darul islam (di) to komite persiapan penegakan syariat islam (kppsi)
 | publisher = Australian National University | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Malinrang, was reportedly a businessman who was from the lower aristocracy class.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt; Their family owned many lands, a sign of wealth at that period of time.

Kahar completed elementary school in 1934, and his parents then sent him to Muhammadiyah Standard School in Palopo (capital of Luwu) for 4 years. He was then sent to [[Surakarta|Solo]] in Central Java to study in the ''Kweekschool'' Muhammadiyah (Islamic Teachers College) from 1938 to 1941.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt; It was in this last institution that Kahar was introduced to a number of prominent [[ulema]], including a prominent modernist Muslim nationalist, Abdul Kahar Muzakkir. In fact, some people claimed that it was contact with this ulema that prompted Kahar to change his name from Ladomeng. There were other views, though, that Kahar had his name changed before he went to Solo, whilst according to Tommy Thomson, Kahar's former guard in the jungle, Kahar's 2 close friends, Jufri Tambora and Siddiq Bakri had been the one who asked Ladomeng to change his name to Kahar.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt;

According to sources, Kahar was average as a student, and that his strength lay not in formal education, but in creativity and talent in dealing with problems.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt; In fact, Kahar did not even complete ''kweekschool'', partly because he married Walimah, a girl from Solo who was his first wife. It was with Walimah that he then returned to Palopo, teaching at a [[Muhammadiyah]] school until 1943.&lt;ref name="Andaya 1977"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Andaya| first =Leonard|  title =People and society in indonesia: A biographical approach.| publisher = Victoria: Monash University | year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not an exceptional student, Kahar was actively involved in organizations, particularly after he had returned to Palopo. He joined the local ''Hizbul Wathan'', the youth organization for Muhammadiyah, and was active in his opposition to what he called the feudal system in Luwu, and called for an end to the aristocracy. His opposition gained him many support from the Luwu youths. Kahar remained active in ''Hizbul Wathan'' until the [https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:5RExJA1G2V4J:repository.unhas.ac.id/bitstream/handle/123456789/827/The%2520Japanese%2520Occupation%2520in%2520South%2520Sulawesi%2520%28terjemahan%29.rtf%3Fsequence%3D1+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=sg&amp;client=firefox-a arrival of the Japanese] in 1942.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt; During the Japanese Occupation, Kahar worked as a clerk at the Nippon Hodobu, an information agency in Makassar under the Japanese authority.

In 1943, Kahar was sentenced by the ''Hadat'' (governing council) of the kingdom of Luwu to ''ripaopangitana'' [literally, to put someone or something face downward on the land], or simply to treat someone as dead.This form of punishment not only banishes the person from the kingdom, but also causes him to sever all ties which a Bugis or Makassar person is dependent on.&lt;ref name="Andaya 1977"/&gt; There were varied accounts for the reason for such a sentence, all indicating that Kahar had alienated and angered the ruling powers in Luwu, particularly in his position as an activist of ''Hizbul Wathan''. There are views that Kahar criticized the belief in ''Sawerigading'', which claims that only the descendents of the ''Sawerigading'' can rule Luwu. According to his sister, Sulaeha, Kahar asked the aristocrats to discard the use of aristocratic titles, such as ''opu'', due to its inherent discrimination. Military documentation also disclosed that Kahar rejected the tradition of bowing the knees before aristocrats. He also acted in ways that oppose the traditional system of his homeland, such as marrying a Javanese girl at a time when cross cultural marriages were not common in the Buginese tradition. According to Barbara Harvey, the versions of reasons for Kahar's exile are as many as the persons who spoke about it. Mukhlis, in his writing, attempted to interpret Kahar's punishment, concluding that he broke 2 main rules: ''Mapparibokoang Arung'' (guilty of self-importance and abusing his position) and he did ''mpleo weloie Arung'' (attempted to overthrow of the rulers' position) in his position as a ''Hizbul Wathan'' activist. At the time Kahar was expelled, he swore to return and marry a descendent of the ''Pajung'' (king), a prophecy which came true as he later married Andi Haliah, the granddaughter of the ''Pajung''.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

== Nationalist activities [1945-1949] ==
After his exile in 1943, Kahar moved to Java and set up a merchandise company known as ''Semangat Muda'' (Spirit of Youth). He also established a shop called ''Toko Luwu.'' It was through this business that Kahar entered the Indonesian nationalist movement. His company was used by him and his colleagues from South Sulawesi to establish an organization, ''Gerakan Pemuda Indonesia Sulawesi'' (Indonesian Youth Movement of Sulawesi, GEPIS) on 10 October 1945. This organization was later renamed ''Angkatan Pemuda Indonesia Sulawesi'' (Sulawesi Indonesian Youth Movement, APIS). This renamed organization became a part of the ''Angkatan Pemuda Indonesia'' (API) and was nationally recognized.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In one of his writings, Kahar revealed that he was one of [[Sukarno|Sukarno's]] bodyguards when the latter gave one of his first mass speeches in September 1945. He was the person, armed with only a machete, who was prepared to protect Sukarno and Hatta against the bayonets of the Japanese soldiers who tried to disperse the meeting and who encircled the car in which Sukarno and Hatta were driving. Kahar's role as bodyguard is not in question, with photographic evidence. According to Hamdan Juhannis, even Ukkas Arifin, a former nationalist activist in Kahar's movement who later became a member of the Republican military, revealed in his writing that he had witnessed the bravery of Kahar in guarding Sukarno in the same meeting.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt;

Kahar helped in the founding of ''Kebaktian Rakyat Indonesia Sulawesi'' (Loyalty of the Indonesian People from Sulawesi, KRIS), along with A. "Zus" Ratulangie, daughter of the Republican Governor of Sulawesi.&lt;ref name="Harvey 1977"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Harvey| first =Barbara|  title =Permesta: Half a Rebellion| publisher = Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell Modern Indonesia Project, Southeast Asia Program, Cornell University.| year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; KRIS was the most famous of organisations in which Sulawesi youths participated in during the [[South Sulawesi Campaign|fight against the Dutch]]. APIS was merged into KRIS soon after and Kahar became the first secretary of KRIS.&lt;ref name="Harvey 1977"/&gt; In this capacity, Kahar was tasked with forming branches of KRIS in East and Central Java, thus the formation of KRIS branches in Solo, Yogyakarta, Madiun, Malang, Tegal, Magelang and Cilacap. It was during this period that Kahar met a group of political prisoners of the Dutch from the Nusakambangan and Cilacap prisons, who originated from the outer islands.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt; He was on his way to Cilacap when he interceded and negotiated the release of the 800-odd prisoners, who were then given brief military training. This battalion became the core of Kahar's army. It also operated as Sukarno's protection guard when he moved to Yogyakarta.

After leaving KRIS due to internal conflicts, Kahar was tasked by [[Sudirman|General Sudirman]] to prepare for the formation of a republican army in Sulawesi. He then formed the ''Tentara Republik Indonesia Persiapan Sulawesi'' (Sulawesi Preparatory Unit of the Army of the Republic of Indonesia, TRIPES) which was formed on 24 March 1946.&lt;ref name="Andaya 1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Redaksi. , Taufik, A., Aswab, M., &amp; Dhakidae, D. 1978"&gt;{{cite book  | author =Redaksi  | author2 =Taufik  | author3 =Aswab  | author4 =Dhakidae  | last-author-amp =yes |  title =Manusia Dalam Kemelut Sejarah| publisher = Jakarta: Lembaga Penelitian, Pendidekan dan Penerangan Ekonomi dan Sosial.| year = 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion of political prisoners whose release Kahar had negotiated formed the core of TRIPES. Members of Kris were also incorporated into TRIPES.&lt;ref name="Harvey 1977"/&gt; Kahar was the commander of TRIPES, and he, helped by Major Andi Mattalatta and Major Saleh Lahade, both from South Sulawesi, began to organize the infiltration of soldiers from Java into South Sulawesi by boats in 1949.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt; Kahar, however, remained in Yogyakarta and later formed a special military unit called ''Barisan Berani Mati'' (Dare-Devil Unit, BBM)&lt;ref name="van Dijk 1981"&gt;{{cite book  | last =van Dijk| first =C.|  title =Rebellion under the banner of islam : The darul islam in indonesia.| year = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the last remaining battalion of the unit which fought in the Madiun area of East Java.&lt;ref name="Andaya 1977"/&gt;

Following this, and the transfer of sovereignty of East Indonesia to the Republic in December 1949, Kahar had expected to be appointed commander of South Sulawesi since he had been one of the principal figures in organising and sending troops of Sulawesi youths back to their homeland in 1946 to support the pro-Republican guerrillas against the Dutch. However, his name was not in the list of newly appointed members of the Territorial Command for East Indonesia.&lt;ref name="Andaya 1977"/&gt; This was a time when education, technical qualifications and discipline were all important and emphasized as criteria for qualifications, thus making Kahar ill-qualified. He did not have formal military training or battle experience, and his rebellious character was considered an obstacle to the integration of the army.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt; Moreover, Kahar had no powerful friends in the military, thus opposition for his ambition to be commander of the South Sulawesi unit was not just by the army, but also by other South Sulawesi officers such as Saleh Lahade and Andi Mattalatta.

== Joining the rebellion [1950-1952] ==
Instead of commander of the South Sulawesi unit, Kahar was appointed as the commander of the ''Komando Grup Seberang'' (Group Commando for the Outer Islands, KGS) in October 1949. He was promoted to the rank of 'acting' lieutenant-colonel, and was put in charge of coordinating the guerrilla units in Sulawesi, Kalimantan, the Moluccas and Nusa Tenggara.&lt;ref name="van Dijk 1981"/&gt; Even before the appointment of Kahar as the commander of KGS, he had sent 2 of his staff officers, Saleh Sjahban and Bahar Mattaliu, to South Sulawesi to establish contact with the guerrilla forces there in April 1949. On 17 August 1949, the ''Kesatuan Gerilya Sulawesi Selatan'' (South Sulawesi Guerrilla Unit, KGSS) was founded with the aim of uniting the many guerrilla bands operating in the area.

After the formal recognition of Indonesia's independence by the Dutch, Kahar suddenly found himself an unemployed officer when the KGS was disbanded. At the same time, fighting broke out between the newly established army command in South Sulawesi and KGSS, when the latter demanded to be part of the TNI.&lt;ref name="Andaya 1977"/&gt; Kahar was ordered to return to Sulawesi to negotiate with these young men. On 22 June 1950, Kahar arrived in Ujungpandang, and initially cooperated with the Indonesian government and army. However, upon his return from a meeting with the guerrillas, he put forward the proposal made by the guerrillas instead. The military commander of East Indonesia, [[Alexander Evert Kawilarang|Kawilarang]], rejected the guerrillas' demands in a meeting with Kahar on 1 July 1950. Instead, Kawilarang issued a decree liquidating KGSS on the same day.&lt;ref name="van Dijk 1981"/&gt;

Kahar, according to Bahar Mattaliu, was very angry at Kawilarang's reaction. Kahar resigned from the Army, pulling off his insignia rank saying '"Ini tidak ada gunanya. (This is of no use)" to Kawilarang. He then threatened that if KGSS's demand was not accommodated, they would rebel.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt; A few days later, Kahar was kidnapped into the forest by the KGSS on the initiative of [[Andi Sose]], though it was suggested that the action had Kahar's tacit consent.&lt;ref name="van Dijk 1981"/&gt;

From then on, Kahar and KGSS had overwhelming support form the local population. This was a major factor which ensured the guerrillas' ability to safely operate in the area.&lt;ref name="Andaya 1977"/&gt; Kahar became the leader of the movement, with his presence further encouraging the men, who looked up to him for his record as a soldier with the highest rank from Sulawesi. Many also saw Kahar as having been betrayed by the central government and deserving of sympathy.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt;

Kahar had the guerrillas ignore the ban on KGSS, and functioned as an illegal organization.&lt;ref name="van Dijk 1981"/&gt; Though essentially enemies of the Republic, there were moments when KGSS assisted the Republican Army, notably in ensuring them a safe landing-place during the [[Andi Aziz|Andi Abdul Azis]]' rebellion and fighting against the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army|Royal Netherlands East Indies Army [KNIL]]]. However, during one of these assists, an incident occurred which cemented the hatred of the Sulawesi population against the Javanese, and by extension, the central government. It was alleged that one of the Republican units commanded by Captain Latief of the Mataram Brigade had opened fire on 2 guerrilla leaders and their contingents, with the intention of getting rid of the guerrillas. The 2 leaders, Arief Rate and Abbas Bangsawan, were killed, along with many of the guerrillas and Arief's whole contingent.&lt;ref name="van Dijk 1981"/&gt; This hatred by the population proved to be valuable to Kahar in his rebellion.

== Links to Darul Islam [1952-1965] ==
Before 1952, [[Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwirjo|Kartosuwirjo]], the leader of the [[Darul Islam (Indonesia)|Darul Islam]] movement in West Java, sent a letter to Kahar inviting to join his movement. Kahar only replied on 20 January 1952, accepting the invitation to make Sulawesi part of the Islamic State of Indonesia. However, Kahar clarified in the same letter that he did not think Sulawesi is ready to adopt the DI movement formally, as some of his followers were still influenced by communism [which happened before his arrival in Sulawesi] and the lack of commitment on their part in initiating an Islamic revolution. According to Kahar:

"Actually, we have also wanted to initiate an Islamic revolution since 16 August 1951 [based on what I plan with Brother Abd. Fattach and Brother Saleh Sjahban], but unfortunately, these two brothers are not committed. That made our effort failed and our power was defeated by stronger and more influential powers in society which were unconsciously influenced by 'reddish' ideology."&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt;

On 27 February 1952, Kartosuwirjo replied to Kahar's letter, appointing the latter as the commander of Division IV, Hasanudin of the Indonesian Islamic Army. Kartosuwirjo also expressed his gratitude to Kahar for acknowledging him as the supreme commander of the Islamic State of Indonesia, and reminded him of the importance of being under the banner of the Darul Islam. In the whole organization of DI in Indonesia, Kahar was the Deputy Minister of Defence, and the Commander of the Fourth Military District (East Indonesia) and the Fourth Division (Hasanuddin). However, there cannot be said to be an active coordination between the central DI movement and the South Sulawesi DI movement.&lt;ref name="van der Kroef 1958"&gt;{{cite book  | last =van der Kroef| first =J. M.|  title =Disunited Indonesia (ii).| publisher = Far Eastern Survey | year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 August 1953, Kahar formally proclaimed South Sulawesi as part of the West Java Darul Islam at a gathering in Makalua. He read the proclamation of 1949, claiming that Sulawesi and its surroundings were part of the Islamic State of Indonesia. At this same gathering, Kahar also issued several regulations to start off the new movement. He announced the new DI flags for South Sulawesi and its surroundings. The state flag was to be red with a yellow crescent and three yellow stars, while the military flag was red with three yellow stars and the number '24'.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt; He also activated a curfew within the areas of DI, and Islamic law was formally adopted. Kahar called on those who were not Muslims to voluntarily support the Islamic community, and labelled the existing guerrillas who were not part of the Islamic army as ''quttautthariq'' (Ar. 'robbers').

In 1955, Kahar, in the name of the East Indonesia DI, called to the Muslim community, ulema, and Islamic political parties to understand the content of the term ''jihad''. He also concentrated on the creation of a legal basis in the application of the formalist Islamic system within the organization. In 1955, the DI held a conference at Makalua, and a constitution known as the 'Makalua Charter' was drafted to guide the South Sulawesi people. Kahar created systems to support the existence of the NII. He started collecting taxes, all in the name of the Islamic state, and also established organizations. He founded a youth organization, Pemuda Islam Jihad, whilst his wife, [http://www.rakyataceh.com/index.php?open=view&amp;newsid=237&amp;tit=Berita%20Utama%20-%20Corry%20Sampaikan%20Surat%20Kahar%20Muzakkar%20untuk%20Soekarno Susana Corry van Stenus], instituted a woman's fighter corps called ''Laskar Wanita''.

Kahar also began to extend the DI influences outside South Sulawesi, soon after he was accepted as being under the West Java DI. He first expanded DI to Southeast Sulawesi, and around 1955, North Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, Maluku and Irian Barat came under the influence of Kahar's DI.

== Death ==
According to the information collected by Anhar Gonggong, Kahar was killed on 3 February 1965 by Corporal Sadeli of the Indonesian Army. It was reported that Sadeli heard the sound of a radio playing in the forest near the Lasolo River area, and approached the source of the sound, knowing that Kahar always carried with him a transistor radio.&lt;ref name="Zurbuchen 2005"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Zurbuchen| first =Mary|  title =Beginning to remember : The past in the indonesian present| publisher = Seattle: University of Washington Press| year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadeli had initially wanted to capture Kahar alive, but upon seeing the grenade in his hand, he shot to kill instead. He then compared a photograph of Kahar with that of the dead body, and concluded that the man he had killed was truly Kahar. The body was retrieved by a helicopter and flown to Makassar, where it was received by [[Mohammad Jusuf]] at Palemonia Hospital. Upon the announcement of Kahar's death, only one of his wives, 2 children and an uncle were authorized to see the body. Kahar's son, Abdullah, identified his father from the eczema on his foot and his dentures.&lt;ref name="Zurbuchen 2005"/&gt;

However, this claim of Kahar's death had been refuted by many of his followers. There were some{{who|date=September 2013}} who claimed that Kahar was a distance away from where the fighting purportedly took place. Moreover, Kahar was always surrounded by 2 platoons of armed bodyguards, and he carried a rifle, not a grenade, as was mentioned in the radio news and newspapers which reported on his death. For these followers, the government news stories were pure propaganda. A whole platoon claimed that they were with Kahar at Lasolo at the supposed time of death, and he disappeared when they left him for a while. However, there was no trace of bloodshed in the area to indicate any sort of fight or struggle. Mansur, one of Kahar's close assistant, also insisted that he was with Kahar when the latter's death was announced on the radio. A few days later, Kahar simply disappeared while Mansur was taking a bath in the river.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

All these witness accounts point not to the death of Kahar, but to a mere disappearance, a view that was supported by his followers. There were some people{{who|date=September 2013}} who claimed that it was Jusuf who had merely faked the death of Kahar based on an earlier face-to-face meeting. These people believed that when Kahar and Jusuf met in Bonepute first on 21 October 1961 and then on 12 November 1961, Jusuf suggested to Kahar that he should go into hiding. It was said that they embraced tearfully. Based on this version, Kahar agreed to be picked up by helicopter to make his escape while another retrieved someone else's body in his place. According to Tihami (1984), the body was dropped in the sea between Makassar and Jakarta so that no one would be able to claim that it was not Kahar's. People also doubted Abdullah's capacity to identify his father as he had spent his childhood in Java with his mother, and rarely saw his father. He had only seen Kahar for 3 days 3 yrs before his death, although they did share a bed. Said Abdullah: "The problem is that no one else saw the corpse. I did, however." &lt;ref name="Zurbuchen 2005"/&gt; Another version that claims to refute Kahar's death draws on the Sulawesi tradition of a ''tomanurung'' (one who descends from heaven) who comes to earth to serve the ruler by protecting the general population from corrupt, authoritarian and abusive leaders. According to the myth constructed and believed by his followers, Kahar is a ''tomanurung''. Therefore, he did not die, but ascended temporarily to heaven, awaiting the time when it is necessary to come back. These suggestions of Kahar as a ''tomanurung'' are usually accompanied by accounts of him living in exile, where he was both engaged in strategic work and at the same time practicing Sufi meditation. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

For many of his followers, the issue of Kahar's alleged death is close for discussion he purportedly said before he left: "I'll go away from you all for some time, don't ever try to look for me, because you simply can't. But, if I want to, I can easily find you." There was also a very prevalent belief that Kahar had merely gone into hiding and had taken another persona. This new identity of Kahar, many believed, was Syamsuri Abdul Madjid also known as Syekh Imam Muhammad Al Mahdi Abdullah. Syamsuri died in 2006, and was said to have been close to Susana Corry van Stenus, one of Kahar's wives.

The government's position on this issue, though, is that Kahar is truly dead, killed in the jungle on 3 February 1965, a position sustained by both Harvey (1974) and van Dijk (1981). This, though, did not stop the contemporary movement from capitalising on the mystery and controversy of Kahar's death. Mansur's version of events at the time of Kahar's supposed death, though gotten third-hand and thus less reliable, had been the one that has galvanised the movement's followers. Jusuf's silence, on the other hand, had conspired in expanding the truth, wittingly or not. A core group of contemporary Kahar's loyalists includes a number of members of NGOs who are involved in a varied field of activities ranging from cooperatives, legal practice and farming, to youth training, and professionals employed in Sulawesi as teachers, lecturers, lawyers, consultants and engineers. In addition to evoking stories of his escape or his ''tomanurung'' status, contemporary staff members of the movement also institutionalise their stance on Kahar's death through the use of slogans attributed to him such as 'Javanese colonialism' and 'Majapahitism'.&lt;ref name="Zurbuchen 2005"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
Though he had been dead for many years, Kahar is still remembered in Sulawesi. His legacy differs for different groups, motivated by their own interests of regional politics and movement vitality. Many of the leaders and former members of Kahar's movement had operated underground and been in hiding after his death. Thus, many of the current members do not know each other as the leaders coordinate the operations through staff and cells. Therefore, Kahar's legacy often focuses on him being a symbol of the movement that he had been a part of.

Kahar had been remembered by non-members of the movement, even till today. Many of these non-members were knowledgeable about Kahar, but for various reasons, they were not supportive of it. Many claimed that they did not support him that time, and will not do so even now. Some said too, that Kahar had brought much suffering to the people of Sulawesi. For those who had been members but had left after Kahar's death, a clear goal and a replacement for Kahar as a capable leader is needed before they will support the movement again. For youths who had only known of the movement and Kahar recently, there are various opinions. Some had positive impressions as they too saw the 'need for a democratic federal state',&lt;ref name="Zurbuchen 2005"/&gt; whilst others had considered him a traitor to the country.

The issue of Kahar being either a rebel or fighter for the people of South Sulawesi had resurfaced in contemporary time, when South Sulawesi's governor, [http://syahrulyasinlimpo.com Syahrul Yasin Limpo], challenged the people to fight rebels in the area. This created an uproar of critiques from many parties in South Sulawesi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tribunnews|title=Akademisi: Kahar Muzakkar Bukan Pemberontak|url=http://www.tribunnews.com/2012/06/10/akademisi-kahar-muzakkar-bukan-pemberontak|accessdate=12 November 2012|newspaper=Tribun News.com|date=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are of the opinion that Kahar was not a rebel or a traitor, but indeed, he was a patriot who had fought for Indonesia's independence. He only became a rebel to fight for a principle that he truly believed in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=H.A.B.Amiruddin Maula|title=Qahhar Mudzakkar, Pejuang atau Pemberontak?|url=http://www.fajar.co.id/read-20120808233442-qahhar-mudzakkar-pejuang-atau-pemberontak|accessdate=12 November 2012|newspaper=Fajar Online|date=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing Kahar, discussions on [[Kartosuwirjo]] and [[Daud Beureu'eh]] had also surfaced. These three figures had been active in the Darul Islam movement, a movement that some people in contemporary Indonesia still view as necessary. Many are of the opinion that these three figures had been excluded from national history, even though they had contributed to the fight for independence between 1945 till 1949 in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mustholih|title=Pejuang Kemerdekaan Yang Tersingkir|url=http://news.okezone.com/read/2012/11/10/337/716480/pejuang-kemerdekaan-yang-tersingkir|accessdate=15 November 2012|newspaper=Okezonenews|date=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary time, Kahar's movement had been institutionalized in the form of two branch organizations, the ''Komite Persiapan Pelaksanaan Syariat Islam'' (Organizing Committee for the Preparation for the Application of Islamic Law; KPPSI) which was founded by Kahar's son Abdul Aziz 2000, and ''Pusat Amanat Referendum Rakyat Sulawesi'' (Center for Trusteeship of the Sulawesi People's Referendum; PARAS) which was also established in 2000.&lt;ref name="Zurbuchen 2005"/&gt;

== Writings ==
During the course of the rebellion, Kahar was active in writing. His writings include monographs, speeches and regulations. He was said to have written more than 10 monographs,&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt; of which not all are available to the public. Hamdan Juhannis claims that Kahar's writings especially reflect an effort to strengthen the legitimacy of Darul Islam as most touch on Islamic issues, quoting Quranic verses against the republican government. Several reasons for this had been brought forth, such that Kahar saw a need to 'Islamize' his DI community in South Sulawesi, and that he wrote for a general audience to help outsiders understand the nature of formalist Islamism.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt;

Kahar's writings were influenced by his short-temperedness and his broad knowledge.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt; Many of them were rather emotional, even to the extent of attacking his enemies like Sukarno. They also reflect his broad knowledge, especially on Islam and politics. Most of his writings can be categorised into general points, namely: his position from a defender to opponent of the pancasila, Islamic democracy verses Sukarno's Java-centricness, Islam versus other ideologies like the pancasila and communism, and his changing conception of state - from an Islamic federation to that of a caliphate system. According to Deliar Noer, Kahar's writings also are significant for it not only addressed the people in his time, but also provide lessons in idealism, and at least a guide for later generations to continue such idealism.&lt;ref name="Hamdan 2006"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8881">Tactical or battlefield intelligence became very vital to both armies in the field during the [[American Civil War]]. Units of spies and scouts reported directly to the commanders of armies in the field. They provided details on troop movements and strengths. The distinction between spies and scouts was one that had life or death consequences. If a suspect was seized while in disguise and not in his army's uniform, the sentence was often to be hanged. A spy named Will Talbot, a member of the [[35th Battalion, Virginia Cavalry]], was left behind in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]] after his battalion had passed through the borough on June 26–27, 1863. He was captured, taken to [[Emmitsburg, Maryland]], and executed on orders of Brig. Gen. [[John Buford]].&lt;ref name="Fishel"&gt;Fishel (1996). ''The Secret War for The Union''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confederate Spying==
Intelligence gathering for the Confederates was focused on [[Alexandria, Virginia]], and the surrounding area.

[[Thomas Jordan (general)|Thomas Jordan]] created a network of agents that included [[Rose O'Neal Greenhow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Harnett|first=Kane T.

The Confederacy's Signal Corps was devoted primarily to communications and intercepts, but it also included a covert agency called the [[Confederate Secret Service]] Bureau, which ran espionage and counter-espionage operations in the North including two networks in Washington.&lt;ref name="United States"/&gt;

==Union Spying==

[[File:PinkertonLincolnMcClernand.jpg|thumb|[[Allan Pinkerton]] (left) with [[Abraham Lincoln]]]]

The Union's intelligence gathering initiatives were decentralized. [[Allan Pinkerton]] worked for Maj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]] and created the United States [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service.]]&lt;ref name="United States"&gt;United States (2005) ''Intelligence in the Civil War''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lafayette C. Baker]] conducted intelligence and security work for Lieutenant General [[Winfield Scott]], commander-in-chief of the U.S. Army. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] hired [[William Alvin Lloyd]] to spy in the South and report to Lincoln directly.&lt;ref name="United States"/&gt;

As a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in Missouri, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was ordered by Maj. Gen. [[John C. Frémont]] to start an intelligence organization.&lt;ref name="United States"/&gt; Grant came to understand the power of intelligence and later put Brig. Gen. [[Grenville M. Dodge]] as the head of his intelligence operations that covered an area from [[Mississippi]] to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] with as many as one hundred secret agents.&lt;ref name="United States"/&gt;

Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]], who became commander of the [[Army of the Potomac]] in January 1863, ordered his deputy provost marshal, Col. [[George H. Sharpe]], to create a unit to gather intelligence. Sharpe set up what he called the Bureau of Military Information and was aided by [[John C. Babcock]], who had worked for [[Allan Pinkerton]] and had made maps for [[George B. McClellan]]. Sharpe's bureau produced reports based on information collected from agents, prisoners of war, refugees, Southern newspapers, documents retrieved from battlefield corpses, and other sources. When Grant began his siege of Petersburg in June 1864, Sharpe had become Grant's intelligence chief.&lt;ref name="United States"/&gt;

The most useful [[military intelligence]] of the [[American Civil War]] was probably provided to Union officers by [[slavery|slave]]s and [[smuggler]]s.&lt;ref name="Quarles"&gt;Quarles(1953). ''The Negro in the Civil War''.&lt;/ref&gt; Intelligence provided by slaves and blacks were called [[black dispatches]].&lt;ref name="Rose"&gt;Rose (1999). ''Black Dispatches''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antti Revonsuo''' is a Finnish [[Cognitive neuroscience|cognitive neuroscientist]], psychologist, and philosopher of mind. His work seeks to understand consciousness as a biological phenomenon. He is one of a small number of philosophers running their own laboratories.

Currently, Revonsuo is a professor of cognitive neuroscience at the [[University of Skövde]] in Sweden and of psychology at the [[University of Turku]] in Finland. His work focuses on [[altered states of consciousness]] in general and dreaming in particular. He is best known for his [[Dream#Evolutionary psychology theories of dreams|Threat Simulation Theory]], which – in the tradition of evolutionary psychology – states that dreams serve the biological function of rehearsing possibly threatening situations in order to aid survival, and his advocacy of the dreaming brain as a model of consciousness.

== Biography ==

Revonsuo completed his graduate education at the [[University of Turku]], receiving his master's degree in Psychology in 1990, a Licentiate in Philosophy in 1991, and finally a Ph.D. in Psychology in 1995. Since 2003, he is a member of the Academy of Finland.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

== Works ==

Revonsuo has himself written two books laying out his philosophical and scientific approach to consciousness: ''Inner Presence: Consciousness as a Biological Phenomenon'' (2006) and ''Consciousness: The Science of Subjectivity'' (2010).

In addition, Revonsuo has co-edited two books on consciousness: ''Consciousness in Philosophy and Cognitive Neuroscience'' (1994) and ''Beyond Dissociations: Interaction Between Dissociated Implicit and Explicit Processing'' (2000). He is also the European Editor of the journal ''[[Consciousness and Cognition]]''.

=== Dreaming as a model of consciousness ===

According to Revonsuo, the dreaming brain is particularly suitable model system for the study of consciousness because it generates a conscious experience while being isolated from both sensory input and motor output.&lt;ref&gt;Revonsuo, A, (2006) Inner Presence: Consciousness as a biological phenomenon. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the rival paradigm of visual awareness, Revonsuo argues that it does not allow one to distinguish between consciousness and perception. Revonsuo holds that there is a "'double dissociation' between consciousness and perceptual input". Accordingly, dreams are conscious experiences, which occur without any perceptual stimuli, and, conversely, perceptual input does not automatically engender conscious experience. In support of the independence of consciousness from perception, Revonsuo cites [[Stephen LaBerge]]'s case study on a lucid dreamer performing previously agreed upon eye movements to signal to the experimenters that he had become conscious of the fact that he was dreaming.  A second study that supports Revonsuo's view of dreams was conducted by [[Allan Rechtschaffen]] and Foulkes (1965).&lt;ref&gt;FOULKES, D, (1985) Dreaming: A Cognitive-Psychological Analysis (Hillsdale, NJ, Lawrence Rrlbaum).&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, subjects were made to sleep with their eyelids open, thus allowing the visual cortex to receive visual stimuli. Though their eyes were open, and the perceptual input was accessible, the subjects could not see the stimuli and did not report dreaming of it. It is the brain that is having the internal experience, independent of perceptual input. This internalist view of consciousness leads Revonsuo to compare both dreaming and waking consciousness with a virtual reality simulation decoupled from or only indirectly informed by a brain's external environment.

Philosophically, Revonsuo's claim that dreaming is a state of consciousness at all contradicts arguments propounded by philosophers [[Norman Malcolm]]&lt;ref&gt;MALCOLM, N, (1956) Dreaming and skepticism. Philosophical Review, 65, pp, 14-37.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;and [[Daniel Dennett]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, D.C. (1976) Are dreams experiences? Philosophical Review, 73, pp. 151-171.&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm argues that, if a person is in any way conscious, "it logically follows that he is not sound asleep".&lt;ref&gt;MALCOLM, N. (1959) Dreaming, pp. 21-25&lt;/ref&gt; Dennett suggested that we needed a well-confirmed, empirical theory of dreams before we could say whether
dreams were like experiences or not.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, D.C. (1976) Are dreams experiences? Philosophical Review, 73, pp. 170-171.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Threat Simulation Theory ===

Revonsuo's threat simulation theory claims that much or all of dream experience is "specialized in the simulation of threatening events", for the evolutionary purpose of rehearsing fight or flight situations to better prepare for such instances in waking life (similar to a "fire drill").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What Your Dreams Actually Mean, According to Science|url=http://time.com/4921605/dreams-meaning/|accessdate=11 January 2018|work=[[Time magazine]]|date=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Revonsuo, empiricial research supports this theory by showing the recurrence of threatening situations in dreaming: of all of the emotions experienced in dreaming, "fear [is] the most common and anger the next most common".&lt;ref&gt;Revonsuo, Antti. "The reinterpretation of dreams: An evolutionary hypothesis of the function of dreaming."&lt;/ref&gt;

An otherwise supportive 2009 review of threat simulation theory stated that "The main weakness of the theory is that there is no direct evidence of the effect of dream rehearsal (or the lack of it) on performance or on survival rates across generations of ancestral humans", and also notes it is not clear why some threat simulations end without a reaction from the dreamer. The review finds that "Overall, the available new evidence and the new direct tests of the predictions of (threat simulation theory) yield strong support for the theory. A mass of evidence indicates that threat simulation is a function of dreaming, an evolved psychological adaptation selected for during the evolutionary history of our species. On current evidence, the strengths of the theory seem to outweigh its weaknesses."&lt;ref name=review&gt;Valli, Katja, and Antti Revonsuo. "The threat simulation theory in light of recent empirical evidence: a review." The American Journal of Psychology (2009): 17-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2017 study in ''[[Sleep (journal)|Sleep]]'', an analysis of the statistical content of intelligible [[somniloquy|sleep-talking]] found that 24 percent contained negative content, 22 percent had "nasty" language, about 10 percent contained a variation of the word "no", and 10 percent contained profanity. 2.5 percent of the intelligible words were a variation of the word "fuck", which comprised only 0.003 percent of spoken words when awake. The study authors judged the findings as being consistent with threat simulation theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edison|first1=Nicole|title=Some people curse and say nasty things in their sleep. There’s a good reason.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/some-people-curse-and-say-nasty-things-in-their-sleep-theres-a-good-reason/2018/01/05/b424a1ce-f172-11e7-b390-a36dc3fa2842_story.html|accessdate=11 January 2018|work=Washington Post|date=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross-cultural surveys find that the most typical dream theme is that of being chased or attacked. Other common negative themes include falling, drowning, being lost, being trapped, being naked or otherwise inappropriately dressed in public, being accidentally injured/ill/dying, being in a human-made or natural disaster, poor performance (such as difficulty taking a test), and having trouble with transportation. Some themes are positive, such as sex, flying, or finding money, but these are less common than dreaming about threats.&lt;ref name=review/&gt;

Revonsuo outlines six “empirically testable” propositions (Revonsuo, 2000) to illustrate his "threat simulation" theory.

==== Proposition 1 ====

Dream experience embodies an “organized and selective simulation of the perceptual world.” Sensory modalities are fully integrated into perceptual dream experience, and the “active dream self” has a body image similar to that of the waking self in the “visuo-spatial world.” Dreams are composed of interactions that mimic archetypical wake-state experiences and situations with people and objects. Revonsuo states that dreams are the result of an “active and organized process rather than a passive by-product of disorganized activation.” The predicable organization of dreams renders them as more than “random noise”; rather, he views their function as a “selective simulation of the world.”

==== Proposition 2 ====

Representations of daily life experiences are absent while dreaming. Dreamers experience a “selective simulation of the world” biased towards threatening situations. The high proportion of negative emotions experienced while dreaming correlates to the need for “adaptive responses that increase the ability to respond appropriately in adaptively important situations” (Revonsuo, 2000). The misfortunes and aggression experienced in a dream state may act as a simulation that prepares the dreamer in the case that a similar situation may occur in the awake state. Evidence lies in the activation during REM sleep across regions that are necessary for the production of these emotionally charged experiences.

==== Proposition 3 ====

Real waking life experiences that are traumatic to the individual causes the dream-production system to create dream content that simulates responses to threats as a mechanism to "mark situations critical for physical survival and reproductive success." Revonsuo writes that "what from a psychological point of view is a 'traumatic experience' is, from a biological point of view, an instance of threat perception and threat-avoidance behavior."

==== Proposition 4 ====

The threatening dream content, while not an accurate depiction of one's real-time experience, seems incredibly realistic and is therefore effective and productive practice for threat-avoidance responses. He postulates that there is proof of this proposition in that dreamed action is consistent with real motor behavior and that "dreaming about an action is an identical process for cortical motor areas as actually carrying out the same action."

==== Proposition 5 ====

The perceptual and motor skills simulated in dreams will increase the efficiency of an individual's performance of those skills even if the dreams are not explicitly remembered. Studies have shown that the implicit learning of skills that are important for human performance can be learned and actualized without any conscious memory of having learned them. Furthermore, Revonsuo writes that "REM sleep physiology appears to selectively support implicit, procedural learning."

==== Proposition 6 ====

The threat-simulation system "was selected for during our evolutionary history," implying that it was not innate but rather came to be in response to the multitude of threats experienced by human ancestral populations. These populations lived in a "more or less constant post-traumatic state" and the dreaming brain constructed the threat-simulation technique as an evolutionary tool, resulting in improved threat-avoidance skills and, thus, a higher probability of survival.

'''Chandra Man Singh Maskey''' ([[Devanagari]]: चन्द्रमान सिंह मास्के) (1900-1984) was a Nepalese artist who was one of the leaders in the development of contemporary art in [[Nepal]] in the early 20th century. Maskey spearheaded the trend of creating art using new techniques for its aesthetic value, and introduced a new style in the milieu of traditional art which is essentially religious and follows descriptions laid down in ancient texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artsofnepal.com/nepali-art-news/12/traditional-art-in-upheaval-the-development-of-modern-contemporary-art-in-nepal.html |title=Traditional Art In Upheaval: The Development Of Modern Contemporary Art In Nepal |last=van der Heide |first=Susanne |website=Arts of Nepal |accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Maskey was born in [[Kathmandu]] to a [[Newar]] family that traditionally served as officials in the government. He abandoned family tradition and chose art as a career. He was also one of the very few Nepalese artists to get an opportunity to study modern art abroad, as the autocratic [[Rana dynasty|Rana regime]] kept tight control on modern education. In those days, the king was a nominal ruler while the Rana prime minister for life held actual power.

From 1918 to 1923, Maskey studied art at the [[Government College of Art &amp; Craft|Government School of Art]], [[Kolkata]]. He was among the first two officially recognized art teachers in Nepal. The other was Tej Bahadur [[Chitrakar]] (1898-1971). After returning to Kathmandu, Maskey held the first ever one-man exhibition in Nepal in 1928. He also began teaching art at [[Durbar High School]] and Padma Kanya Girls High School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://issuu.com/dkbbkk/docs/maskey_part_one |title= Biodata |website= Maskey: Premier Artist of Nepal |page=7 |accessdate=14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artsofnepal.com/nepali-art-news/12/traditional-art-in-upheaval-the-development-of-modern-contemporary-art-in-nepal.html |title=Traditional Art In Upheaval: The Development Of Modern Contemporary Art In Nepal |last=van der Heide |first=Susanne |website=Arts of Nepal |accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In jail==
Maskey aroused the anger of the Rana regime by starting a public school, and it looked for an opportunity to punish him. In 1940, he was convicted of drawing an anti-Rana cartoon and sentenced to 18 years in jail and all his property was confiscated. Maskey served five years and was released in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://issuu.com/dkbbkk/docs/maskey_part_one |title= Recollections by Ruth Smock of Chandra Man Maskey |last= Smock |first=Ruth |website= Maskey: Premier Artist of Nepal |page=10 |accessdate=14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In prison, one of his fellow inmates was poet [[Chittadhar Hridaya]] who had been given a six-year sentence for writing a poem about his late mother which was deemed subversive. Hridaya spent his time in prison secretly writing an epic based on the Buddha's life. Maskey drew the paintings to illustrate the epic entitled [[Sugata Saurabha (epic)|''Sugata Saurabha'']] which was published when they were both released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hridaya |first= Chittadhar |translator=Todd Thornton Lewis |translator2=Subarna Man Tuladhar |year=2010 |title= Sugata Saurabha: An Epic Poem from Nepal on the Life of the Buddha by Chittadhar Hridaya |page=8 |publisher= Oxford University Press | isbn=9780195341829}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Subedi |first= Abhi |date=14 April 2012 |title= Power of the portrait |url= http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2012/04/14/related_articles/power-of-the-portrait/233790.html |newspaper= The Kathmandu Post |accessdate=12 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==

Two years after being released from prison, Maskey resumed teaching at Padma Kanya Girls High School. In 1957, he and his friends opened the Popular University of Kathmandu which was shut down after six months. Maskey has served as the director of Nepal National Museum, Department of Culture and Archaeology and National Zoo, and adviser to the Nepal Association of Fine Arts (NAFA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://issuu.com/dkbbkk/docs/maskey_part_one |title= Biodata |website= Maskey: Premier Artist of Nepal |page=7 |accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maskey's paintings have been described as a chronicle of Nepalese life and culture. He has painted everyday scenes of rural Nepal as well as ceremonies and celebrations. His works consist of pencil, pen and ink drawings, oils and watercolors.

==Honors==
In 1995, the Postal Services Department of Nepal issued a commemorative postage stamp depicting a portrait of Chandra Man Singh Maskey to honor his contribution to the development of art in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rajan.com/stamps/st1995.htm |title=List of Nepali Postage Stamps Issued |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Hartshorne''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɑr|t|s|ˌ|h|ɔr|n}}; June 5, 1897&amp;nbsp;– October 9, 2000) was an [[American philosopher]] who concentrated primarily on the [[philosophy of religion]] and [[metaphysics]]. He developed the neoclassical idea of [[God]] and produced a [[Modal logic|modal]] [[Arguments for the existence of God|proof of the existence of God]] that was a development of [[Anselm of Canterbury|St. Anselm]]'s [[ontological argument]]. Hartshorne is also noted for developing [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s [[process philosophy]] into [[process theology]].

== Early life and education ==
Hartshorne (pronounced harts-horn) was born in [[Kittanning, Pennsylvania]], and was the son of Reverend F.C. Hartshorne. Among his brothers was the prominent geographer [[Richard Hartshorne]]. Charles attended [[Haverford College]] between 1915–17, but then spent two years as a hospital orderly serving in the US Army. He then studied at [[Harvard University]], where he earned the B.A. (1921), M.A. (1922) and PhD (1923) degrees. His doctoral dissertation was on "The Unity of Being". He obtained all three degrees in only four years, an accomplishment believed unique in Harvard's history.

From 1923-25 Hartshorne pursued further studies in Europe. He attended the [[University of Freiburg]], where he studied under the phenomenologist [[Edmund Husserl]], and also the [[University of Marburg]], where he studied under [[Martin Heidegger]]. He then returned to Harvard University as a research fellow from 1925–28, where he and [[Paul Weiss (philosopher)|Paul Weiss]] edited the ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]] of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]'' v. 1–6 and spent a semester assisting [[Alfred North Whitehead]].

== Career ==
After Hartshorne worked at Harvard University, he became a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Chicago]] (1928–1955), and was also a member of the University's Federated Theological Faculty (1943–1955). He then taught at [[Emory University]] (1955–62), followed by the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] (1962–retirement). He published his last article at age 96 and delivered his last lecture at 98.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Martin, [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/13/us/charles-hartshorne-theologian-is-dead-proponent-of-an-activist-god-was-103.html?pagewanted=all "Charles Hartshorne, Theologian, Is Dead; Proponent of an Activist God Was 103,"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 13, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his long teaching career at the previous three universities, Hartshorne was also appointed as a special lecturer or visiting professor at [[Stanford University]], the [[University of Washington]], [[Yale University]], the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]], the [[University of Melbourne]] and [[Kyoto University]]. He served as president of the [[Metaphysical Society of America]] in 1955. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1975.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter H|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterH.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intellectual influences ==
Hartshorne acknowledged that he was greatly influenced by [[Matthew Arnold]] (''Literature and Dogma''), [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]]'s ''Essays'', [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], and especially by [[Alfred North Whitehead]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Michel Weber]] and Will Desmond (eds.). ''[https://www.academia.edu/279955/Handbook_of_Whiteheadian_Process_Thought Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought]'' (Frankfurt / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, Process Thought X1 &amp; X2, 2008) and Ronny Desmet &amp; Michel Weber (edited by), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics Whitehead. The Algebra of Metaphysics. Applied Process Metaphysics Summer Institute Memorandum]'', Louvain-la-Neuve, Les Éditions Chromatika, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rufus Jones (writer)|Rufus Jones]] was his Haverford teacher and continuing mentor. He also found inspiration in the works of [[Josiah Royce]] (''Problem of Christianity''), [[William James]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Ralph Barton Perry]] and [[Nikolai Berdyaev]]. He conducted a lengthy correspondence over some twenty-three years with [[Edgar S. Brightman]] of [[Boston University]] about their respective philosophical and theological views.

In turn Hartshorne has been a seminal influence on the [[theology|theologians]] [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]], [[Daniel Day Williams]], [[Norman Pittenger]], [[Gregory A. Boyd]], [[Schubert Ogden]] and [[John B. Cobb]], on the American philosopher [[Frank Ebersole]] and on the [[Australia]]n [[biology|biologist]]-[[futurist|futurologist]] [[Charles Birch]].

== Philosophy and theology ==
The intellectual movement with which Hartshorne is associated is generally referred to as [[process theology]]. The roots of process thinking can be found in the Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]]. Contemporary [[process philosophy]] arose from the work of [[Alfred North Whitehead]], while Hartshorne is identified as the seminal influence on process theology that emerged after World War Two.

The key [[motif (narrative)|motifs]] of process philosophy are: [[empiricism]], [[relationalism]], [[Process theory|process]], and events.

The motif of empiricism in process thought refers to the theme that experience is the realm for defining meaning and verifying any theory of reality. Unlike classical empiricism, process thought takes the category of thinking beyond just the human senses of perception. Experiences are not confined to sense perception or consciousness, and there are pre-sensual, pre-conscious experiences from which consciousness and perception derive.

The motif of relationalism refers to both experiences and relationships. Humans experience things and also experience the relationship between things. The motif of process means that all time, history and change are in a dynamic [[evolutionary]] process. The final motif of events refers to all the units (organic and inorganic) of the world.

While Hartshorne acknowledges the importance of Whitehead's philosophy on his own ideas, he did not entirely agree with Whitehead. In Hartshorne's process theology God and the world exist in a dynamic, changing relationship. God is a 'di-polar' [[deity]]. By this Hartshorne meant that God has both abstract and concrete poles. The abstract pole refers to those elements within God that never vary, such as God's self-identity, while the concrete pole refers to the organic growth in God's perfect knowledge of the world as the world itself develops and changes. Hartshorne did not accept the classical theistic claim of ''[[ex nihilo|creatio ex nihilo]]'' (creation out of nothing), and instead held to ''[[ex materia|creatio ex materia]]'' (creation out of pre-existent material).

One of the technical terms Hartshorne used is pan-en-theism, originally coined by [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]] in 1828. [[Panentheism]] (all is in God) must be differentiated from [[Classical pantheism]] (all is God). In Hartshorne's theology God is not identical with the world, but God is also not completely independent from the world. God has his self-identity that transcends the earth, but the world is also contained within God. A rough analogy is the relationship between a mother and a fetus. The mother has her own identity and is different from the unborn, yet is intimately connected to the unborn. The unborn is within the womb and attached to the mother via the umbilical cord.

Hartshorne reworked the [[ontological argument]] for God's existence as promulgated by [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]]. In Anselm's equation, "God is that than which no greater can be conceived." Anselm's [[argument]] used the concept of perfection. Hartshorne accepts that by definition God is perfect. However, Hartshorne maintains that classical Christian theism has held to a self-contradictory notion of perfection. He argues that the classical concept of God fails. Hartshorne posited that God's existence is necessary and is compatible with any events in the world. In the economy of his argument Hartshorne has attempted to break a perceived stalemate in theology over the problem of evil and God's omnipotence. For Hartshorne, perfection means that God cannot be surpassed in his social relatedness to every creature. God is capable of surpassing himself by growing and changing in his knowledge and feeling for the world.

Hartshorne acknowledged a God capable of change, as is consistent with [[pandeism]], but early on he specifically rejected both [[deism]] and pandeism in favor of panentheism, writing that "panentheistic doctrine contains all of deism and pandeism except their arbitrary negations".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hartshorne, ''Man's Vision of God and the Logic of Theism'' (1964), p. 348, {{ISBN|0-208-00498-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartshorne did not believe in the immortality of human souls as identities separate from God, but explained that all the beauty created in a person's life will exist for ever in the reality of God. This can be understood in a way reminiscent of [[Hinduism]], or perhaps [[Buddhism]]'s Sunyata (emptiness) ontology {{Dubious|date=October 2011}} namely that a person's identity is extinguished in one's ultimate union with God, but that a person's life within God is eternal.
Hartshorne regularly attended services at several [[Unitarian-Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] churches, and joined the First Unitarian Universalist Church in [[Austin, Texas]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.uua.org/pipermail/uua-l/Week-of-Mon-20001009/000581.html |title=Charles Hartshorne| publisher = Unitarian Universalist Association|accessdate=2007-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Hartshorne's philosophical and theological views have received criticism from many different quarters. Positive criticism has underscored that Hartshorne's emphasis on change and process and creativity has acted as a great corrective to static thinking about causal laws and determinism. Several commentators affirm that his position offers metaphysical coherence by providing a coherent set of concepts.

Others indicate that Hartshorne has quite properly placed a valuable emphasis on appreciating nature (even evidenced in Hartshorne's hobby for bird-watching). His emphasis on nature and human-divine relationships to the world has goaded reflective work on developing theologies about pollution, resource degradation and a philosophy of [[ecology]]. Allied to this has been Hartshorne's emphasis on [[aesthetics]] and beauty. In his system of thought science and theology achieve some integration as science and theology provide data for each other.

Hartshorne has also been an important figure in upholding [[natural theology]], and in offering an understanding of God as a personal, dynamic being. It is accepted by many philosophers that Hartshorne made the idea of perfection rationally conceivable, and so his contribution to the [[ontological]] argument is deemed to be valuable for modern philosophical discussion.

It has been said that Hartshorne has placed an interesting emphasis on affirming that the God who loves the creation also endures suffering. In his theological thought the centrality of love is very strong, particularly in his interpretation of God, nature and all living creatures. Hartshorne is also appreciated for his philosophical interest in [[Buddhism]], and in stimulating others in new approaches to inter-religious co-operation and dialogue.

[[Langdon Gilkey]] questioned Hartshorne's assumptions about human reasoning experiences. Gilkey pointed out that Hartshorne assumes there is an objective or rational structure to the whole universe, and he then assumes that human thought can acquire accurate and adequate knowledge of the universe.

In Hartshorne's theology there is no literal first event in the universe, and the universe is thus regarded as an actually infinite reality. This has led some to point out that as Hartshorne has emphasized that every event has been partly determined by previous events, his thought is susceptible to the [[fallacy]] of the [[infinite regress]].

Other critics question the adequacy of panentheism. The point of tension in Hartshorne's theology is whether God is really worthy of worship since God needs the world in order to be a complete being. Traditional theism posits that God is a complete being before the creation of the world. Others find that his argument about God's perfection is flawed by confusing existential necessity with [[logical truth|logical necessity]].

In classical Protestant and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] thought, Hartshorne's theology has received strong criticism. In these theological networks Hartshorne's panentheist reinterpretation of God's nature has been deemed to be incompatible with Biblical revelation and the classic creedal formulations of the [[Trinity]]. Critics such as [[Royce Gruenler]], [[Ronald H. Nash|Ronald Nash]] and [[Norman Geisler]] argue that Hartshorne does not offer a tripersonal view of the Trinity, and instead his interpretation of Christ ([[Christology]]) has some affinities with the early [[heresy]] of the [[Ebionite]]s. It is also argued that Hartshorne's theology entails a denial of divine foreknowledge and [[predestination]] to [[salvation]]. Hartshorne is also criticized for his denial or devaluing of Christ's [[miracle]]s and the supernatural events mentioned in the Bible.

Other criticisms are that Hartshorne gives little attention to the classical theological concepts of God's holiness, and that the awe of God is an undeveloped element in his writings. [[Alan Gragg]] criticizes Hartshorne's highly optimistic view of humanity, and hence its lack of emphasis on [[human depravity]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and [[sin]]. Allied to these criticisms is the assertion that Hartshorne over-emphasizes aesthetics and is correspondingly weak on ethics and morality. Others have indicated that Hartshorne failed to understand traditional Christian views about petitionary [[prayer]] and survival of the individual in the afterlife.

'''Christoforos Perraivos''' ({{lang-el|Χριστόφορος Περραιβός}}) was a Greek officer of the [[Greek War of Independence]], member of the [[Filiki Eteria]] and author. In non-Greek sources his name is usually found as ''Per(r)evo(s).''

==Biography==
Perraivos was born {{circa|1773}} in [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]].  His family name was Hatzivasilis (Χατζηβασίλης), but adopted the nickname “Perraivos” alluding to the [[Perrhaebi]], an ancient Greek tribe of Thessaly. It is believed that he was an illegitimate son of a certain monk Hieronymos, an official at the [[Metropolis of Larissa]].

In 1793, with the help of the said Hieronymos, he left Greece to study at the [[Princely Academy of Bucharest|Greek School in Bucharest]] and in 1796 to study medicine in Vienna. There he met the Greek humanist and revolutionary  [[Rigas Feraios]] and entered an underground revolutionary organization.  In 1797 Perraivos was arrested with Rigas and others by the Austrian authorities in Trieste but, unlike Rigas Feraios who was handed over to the Turks, Perraivos was released.

Afterwards he left for [[Corfu]], then [[Corcyre|under French administration]], and enlisted in the foreign units of the French army. He remained there when the Russians [[Siege of Corfu (1798–99)|took over]] the [[Ionian Islands]] in 1798. He fell into disfavour with the Russians but he managed to stay in Corfu and to serve in the army, thanks to the protection of the Greeks [[Eleftherios Benakis]] (a Russian agent) and Georgios Palatinos (secretary of the Russian Admiral). In Corfu he worked also as a teacher in Greek schools from 1804. During 1805-1806 he was attached to the Russian admiral [[Mikhail Dolgorukov]] and later was given the rank of major by the Russian admiral [[Dmitry Senyavin]]. As a commander of 4 units of 100 men ("[[hekatontarch]]ies") he defended the island of [[Lefkada]] (one of the Ionian islands, then "Santa Maura") that was threatened by [[Ali Pasha of Ioannina|Ali Pasha]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia "Papyros-Larousse", article "Περραιβός", Athens, c. 1965. In Greek.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the French occupied the Ionian Islands for second time in 1807 he retained his rank and became a member of the [[Albanian Regiment (France)|Albanian Regiment]], established the same year (Boppe, p.&amp;nbsp;11). Memoirs of his service under the Russians and the French are included in his “History of Souli and Parga”. This work was written in Corfu in 1801, where he stayed till 1817. Its first volume was published in greek in 1803 in Paris and includes the earliest historical essay on Souli based on first-hand informations gathered from [[Souliotes]] refugees fighters in the island. It also includes information on the activities of Russia,  France and Britain in the Ionian and Adriatic during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the wars against Ali Pasha and the Ottomans. It was translated to italian by C. Gherardini in 1815 and from italian to english in 1823.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.gr/books?id=9XUKAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=of%20Mount%20Pindus&amp;f=false Leake W. "Travels in Northern Greece", London, 1835, p. 501]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1817, after the departure of French from Corfu, he emigrated to Russia. In [[Odessa]] he met the leaders of the [[Filiki Eteria]] and became a member of this organization. Following the orders of the Eteria he travelled to the semi-autonomous [[Mani Peninsula]] to organize the revolution against the Ottoman Empire. In [[Wallachia]] he met [[Alexander Ypsilantis]], the political and military head of the Greek revolution, in 1820 and tried to persuade him to postpone the uprising. However, Ypsilantis, resolved to begin the revolution in March 1821,  sent Perraivos to [[Epirus]] to coordinate with the [[Souliotes]] and other captains whom he knew from Corfu. He was in Epirus on the outbreak of the revolution (March 1821) and fought with the Souliotes in various battles, as in the siege of the Riniassa castle. After the treaty between Souliotes and Ottomans and the evacuation of Souli, he went to [[Missolonghi]] and then to other parts of Greece, participating in many military campaigns and political missions. In 1829 participated in the [[Fourth National Assembly at Argos]] as a representative of Thessaly. After independence he authored his "War memoirs".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/hoiendoxoihelln00unkngoog#page/n275/mode/2up Agapetos S. Agapetos,  The glorious Greeks of 1821 … (Αγαπητός Σ. Αγαπητός, Οι ένδοξοι Έλληνες του 1821 …), Patras, 1877, vol. 1, pp. 245-251]. In Greek.&lt;/ref&gt;

He served in the regular army of the new Greek Kingdom as a colonel, and was promoted to Major General by King [[Otto of Greece]] in 1844. He died on 4 May 1863 in [[Athens]].

'''Cornelia Jones''' (10 September 1907–23 December 1979) was a Dutch woman from [[Saba]] who ran the Government Guesthouse on the island and was the first woman to serve on the island council, making her the first female to hold office in the [[Windward Islands]]. She was honored by Queen [[Juliana of the Netherlands]] for her years of service to Saba.

==Early life==
Cornelia Rosina Jones. known as "Cutchie" was born on 10 September 1907 in [[St. Johns, Saba|St. Johns]] on the island of [[Saba]], at the time a part of the [[Dutch Empire]] to Mary Jane (née Hassell) and Fernandus Jones. She was of mixed parentage, her father being a black sailor and her mother a white islander and came from a family with two older siblings and one younger brother.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=4}}

==Career==
Jones ran the Government Guesthouse on the island, one of the few places available for tourist lodging.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=4}} The Guesthouse was a two-story building, built by the territorial authority, which had a parlor, library, dining room and kitchen on the lower floor and guest rooms on the upper story. Jones managed the property and acted as hostess of the island, as well as acting as the cook and housekeeper.{{sfn|Hornos|Hornos|1960|p=86}} She was frequently the feature of articles in magazines and newspapers from visiting officials and tourists to the island.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=4}} 

In 1951, Jones ventured into politics, running for the territorial council with two other women candidates, Ursula Dunkin-Hughes and Millicent L. Wilson. Between the three women candidates, they only received three votes.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=5}} In 1953, when Kenneth Peterson resigned from the council, Jones was approved as his replacement, serving through 1954.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=5}}{{sfn|Johnson|2008|p=13}} She ran again for the council in 1953 and though Jones was not reelected, she was held in high esteem. When developers proposed in 1955 to replace the Government House with a hotel financed by Dutch backers, the island council refused because the investors would not guarantee Jones' continued employment.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|pp=4–5}} After many years service at the Government Guesthouse, Jones became the innkeeper of the Windwardside Guesthouse.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=4}} She was honored by  Queen [[Juliana of the Netherlands]] for her years of service to Saba.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=5}}

==Death and legacy==
Jones died on 23 December 1979 at her home on the peaks above [[The Bottom]], on Saba. She was buried next to the family home.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=5}}

'''Mary Virginia "Jimmie" Carpenter''' was a 21-year-old woman from [[Texarkana, Texas]], who went missing in [[Denton, Texas]], in the [[summer]] of 1948. Her disappearance remains unsolved. Carpenter was last seen by a [[taxi]] driver around 9:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Tuesday, June 1, 1948. Numerous individuals have reported seeing her over the years, but none of these sightings have been confirmed. Her mother, Mrs. Hazel E. Carpenter (who became Mrs. Hazel Smith later in life), spent many years helping the police chase down rumors and leads. She eventually gave up hope, believing that her daughter was dead, although she still wanted her daughter to be found even if she was deceased. In 1998, Denton police received an anonymous tip that she was buried at the campus she was supposed to attend, but it turned out fruitless. Countless man-hours and almost a quarter of a million dollars were spent on the investigation. The case is [[cold case|cold]] but remains open.

Speculation of Carpenter's disappearance was that the [[Texarkana Moonlight Murders|Phantom of Texarkana]] had gotten her since she knew three of the victims. The girl's mother convinced herself that Virginia was a victim of [[amnesia]], not knowing who she was or where she was from, which prompted her to give the girl's life story for the second anniversary of her disappearance in the [[Denton Record-Chronicle]]; although the year before, she was convinced that her daughter was dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Year-Old Virginia Carpenter Mystery Is Still Unsolved|newspaper=Denton Record-Chronicle|date=June 1, 1949|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bones were found around [[Denton County]] in 1949, 1958 and 1960, but they were declared to not be Miss Carpenter. In 1985, Lewis C. Rigler, a [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] who was a lead investigator in the case, said that he was not surprised that what may have been the most famous missing person case in Texas was still drawing attention.&lt;ref name="Baytown Sun"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-Ranger haunted by case|work=The Baytown Sun|date=July 31, 1985|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

An only child, Virginia Carpenter was {{convert|5|ft|3|in|m}} tall, weighed {{convert|120|lb|kg}}, and had dark brown hair and brown eyes. She was last seen wearing a light white [[cambric|chambray]] dress with brown and green stripes (some descriptions include red stripes) and silver buttons down the front, a small white [[straw hat]] with the brim flipped up and a white feather stuck in the back, red leather platform [[high-heeled shoes]], and a gold [[Wittnauer]] watch.&lt;ref name="Denton Chronicle, Jan 30"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Denton Record-Chronicle|title=Mysterious Disappearance of Carpenter Girl Unsolved|date=January 30, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charley Project"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Charley Project: Mary Virginia Carpenter|url=http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/c/carpenter_virginia.html|website=CharleyProject.org|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpenter took with her a red purse, a black pasteboard hat box, and a brown [[steamer trunk]] with a matching [[cosmetics]] case. According to Mrs. Carpenter, her daughter left with no more than 15 or 20 dollars.&lt;ref name="Denton Chronicle, Jan 30" /&gt;

[[File:Scene recreation.jpg|thumb|left|A scene recreation from the Denton Record-Chronicle]]
On Tuesday, June 1, 1948, Carpenter boarded the [[Texas &amp; Pacific]] [[Texas Special]] #31 for [[Dallas]], Texas at Union Station in [[Texarkana]] about 3 p.m., and stopped in Denton, Texas around six hours later. She was on her way to the Texas State College for Women (TSCW) campus, which is now the [[Texas Woman's University]], to enroll in the summer course. While on the train, she met Marjorie Webster, a middle-aged school teacher who was also enrolling at TSCW from Texarkana. After arriving at the train station, they both hired a taxi (driven by Edgar Ray "Jack" Zachary) to take them to the college [[dorms]]. As her friend was being dropped off at the Fitzgerald dormitories, Carpenter realized that she forgot to check on her trunk at the train station. She asked the driver how much it would be to take her back to the station. He replied 75 cents. Webster asked if she needed to ride back with her, but Carpenter refused, stating "No, I'll go alone. I'll be alright."&lt;ref name="June 11, 1948"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Texarkana Gazette|page=1|title=Whereabouts of Miss Carpenter Remains Mystery|date=June 11, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; After arriving again at the station, she went inside to get her trunk but came back a few minutes later claiming that she could not get it. She spoke to a railroad employee named Mr. Butrill who told her the trunk would not arrive until later.&lt;ref name="Rigler" /&gt; Zachary told Carpenter to sign the back of her claim check and that he would pick it up and deliver it to her in the morning. Carpenter agreed and gave him her luggage receipt after writing "Virginia Carpenter, Room 200--Brackenridge", and a dollar for the extra trip.

Upon arriving back at Brackenridge Hall about 9:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., Zachary said he saw a yellow or cream-colored [[convertible]] parked in the front. There was no moon, and the street lights were out due to repair work on a cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Lubbock Morning Avalanche|title=White Case Recalls Similar Mystery|date=January 27, 1953|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reported that Carpenter walked up to the vehicle which had two young men standing by it; one of whom was tall, the other short and stocky. She asked "Well, what are y'all doing here?"&lt;ref name=2yearDenton&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Denton Record-Chronicle|title=Is Virginia Carpenter Still Alive?|page=2|date=June 1, 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said it seemed as though she was surprised to see them. The shorter boy talked to her and lifted her on the curb. Carpenter told Zachary to place her luggage on the ground because the boys will get them for her and to leave her trunk there in the morning as well. After doing that, Zachary drove off but did not hear the rest of the conversation. That was the last anyone had seen Miss Carpenter. Reports claimed that a [[security guard|nightwatchman]] saw the girl get out of the cab and into the convertible,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Taylor Daily Press|title=Search for TSCW Girl, Who Vanished Tuesday, Continues|date=June 7, 1948|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Police Chief]] Jack Shepherd denied it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Denton Record-Chronicle|title=Denton Gets Heat Baptism|date=June 6, 1958|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next morning, Zachary dropped the trunk off and set it on the front lawn of Brackenridge Hall. After being there for two days, it was taken to the office. Mrs. Mattie Lloyd Wooten, the [[dean of women]] of TSCW, later explained to Mrs. Carpenter that it was the first time someone did not deliver luggage to the room.

== Investigation ==

Three days later on Friday, June 4, Carpenter's boyfriend, Kenny Branham, from Dallas, Texas called Virginia's mother in Texarkana because he could not get a hold of her.&lt;ref name="Rigler"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rigler|first=Lewis C.|title=In the Line of Duty : Reflections of a Texas Ranger Private|date=1995|publisher=University of North Texas Press|location=Denton|isbn=978-0929398990|pages=81–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Carpenter, now worried, called the school and found out that her daughter never enrolled. She then called friends and relatives that her daughter may have tried visiting, but they had not heard from her.&lt;ref name="2yearDenton" /&gt; On Saturday, June 5, around 12:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., she called the local authorities and the Denton police to report her daughter missing. The Texarkana police told her to "just go to bed and we'll get on the case in the morning",&lt;ref name="2yearDenton" /&gt; but she could not sleep, so she and Mrs. Lucille Bailey, a friend who was living with her, left for Denton at 2:10&amp;nbsp;a.m. Late Saturday night, the girl's uncle and friends went to Denton to help assist the police in their search with any helpful information, but they failed to shed any light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Texarkana Gazette|title=Texarkana Girl Still Missing|date=June 6, 1948|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Texarkana Gazette|date=June 8, 1948|title=Virginia Carpenter Still Missing; Reported Seen at Aubrey, Texas|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Airplanes began scanning the Denton area and motorboats were used to search ponds and lakes. Search parties searched the [[forest|woods]]&lt;ref name="June 11, 1948" /&gt; as well as tanks, [[storm drain]]s, creeks, country roads and abandoned [[water well|well]]s. The search was now statewide. Police checked out drivers of light-colored convertibles in Texarkana and Denton but came up with nothing. Lewis C. Rigler, a Texas Ranger, entered the investigation on Monday, June 7, by the request of Virginia's uncle, Dr. E.C. Dodd, along with Chief of Police Jack Shepherd and Sheriff Roy Moore. Officers talked with groups and individuals as possible witnesses. Hunters and farmers were asked to be on the lookout for freshly dug dirt or any unusual odors. Pictures and a description of Virginia were sent to the [[Department of Public Safety]], major city police departments, protection officers of major railroad companies, every [[State Bureau of Investigation]]s, and many other agencies. Miss Carpenter's trunk was eventually opened, but it gave officers no clues. Her handbag was never found.&lt;ref name="Baytown Sun" /&gt;
A reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible started Wednesday, June 9, and by the end of Friday night, it had reached $1,368.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Texarkana Gazette|title=Officers Continue Working 'Round Clock in Effort to Solve Mystery Surrounding Disappearance of Virginia Carpenter|date=June 12, 1948|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpenter's picture and description was given to ''Reward'' magazine, the official publication of Tracers Company of America which investigates missing people with rewards. Despite having 150,000 police officials as subscribers, little replies came in about Virginia and investigations came out inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Denton Record-Chronicle|date=June 5, 1950|title=Trail of Virginia Carpenter Ends At Doorstep of TSCW Dormitory|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Friday, July 9, Jack Zachary took a [[polygraph]] test which concluded that he had no connection to her disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Texarkana Gazette|date=July 12, 1948|title=Mrs. Carpenter to Ask Cab Driver to Take Sodium Penethol Test|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; By Monday, July 12, it was rumored that Virginia had returned home, but her mom confirmed that it was untrue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Texarkana Gazette|title=Reported Return of Virginia Carpenter Labeled 'Untrue'|date=July 13, 1948|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief of Police Jack Shepherd said that Carpenter knew some boys with a cream-colored convertible but he was not able to implicate any of them with her disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Lubbock Evening Journal|title=Reward of $3,000 Is Offered For Trace Of Missing Co-Ed|date=December 1, 1948|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many leads and tips were thoroughly checked but police were no further to finding Miss Carpenter. More rumors had spread that she returned home or that her body or her luggage was found, but they were branded false by Shepherd.&lt;ref name="Denton Chronicle, Jan 30" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Denton Record-Chronicle|title=Missing Girl Rumors False|date=June 20, 1948|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reward money reached around $3,000, most of which was given back to the donors after two years of no helpful information. On June 9, 1955, Virginia was considered officially dead by a Texas civil law. Article 55:41 in the Texas Civil Statute stated that a person who was successfully absent for seven years should be presumed dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rogers|first=Jay|title=Missing TSCW Girl Assumed Dead Now|newspaper=Denton Record-Chronicle|date=June 9, 1955|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 18, 1959, a three-by-one wooden box was discovered, which contained female bones including a skull, in a [[smokehouse]] near an abandoned farmhouse 7.5&amp;nbsp;miles northeast of [[Jefferson, Texas]] in [[Marion County, Texas|Marion County]]. The bones, which matched the height and weight description of Virginia, were sent to [[Austin, Texas]] for examination. During that time, the previous owners of the farmhouse admitted to digging up the bones from a "[[Negro]]" cemetery. The son was a biology student and said he needed the bones. Mrs. Carpenter had hopes that it was her daughter's remains because the bones had a deformity, and Virginia had a deformity in her right leg which made it shorter than the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rangers say bones found in east Texas|work=Denton Record-Chronicle|date=January 15, 1960|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the remains turned out to be from a white female with a shortened leg, the dental work did not match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bones Called Not Virginia's|work=Denton Record-Chronicle|date=January 20, 1960|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1998, the police were tipped by a man in his 70s claiming that he knew who killed Miss Carpenter and where she was buried. He stated she was buried on the grounds of the Texas State College for Women (TSCW) campus, which is now Texas Woman's University. The area was [[excavation (archaeology)|excavated]], but only a leather glove, a rubber boot, and animal bone fragments were found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=New Braunfels Herald-Zeitung|title=Police continue bone excavation|date=July 8, 1998|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reported sightings ==

Not long after Miss Carpenter went missing, reports of sightings came in from Denton county, south Texas, [[Louisiana]] and [[Arkansas]]. None of the sightings, however, had been confirmed. Two mornings after Virginia's disappearance, a gas station attendant in [[Aubrey, Texas]], which is 10&amp;nbsp;miles from Denton, saw a girl who resembled Miss Carpenter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Texarkana Gazette|title=Girl Resembling Miss Carpenter Reported Seen|date=June 7, 1948|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reported his sighting on June 6 after seeing Virginia's picture in that morning's newspaper. He said that a yellow convertible with Arkansas license plates occupied by two boys and two girls stopped at his station.

On Friday, June 11 around 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., a ticket agent named Mrs. James at a bus station in [[DeQueen, Arkansas]] saw a girl who resembled Miss Carpenter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Texarkana Gazette|title=Missing Girl Reported Seen At De Queen|date=June 13, 1948|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The girl got off a bus from Texarkana wearing a red dress and carrying a red purse. She waited in the lobby before departing 10 minutes later with a young man about 25- or 26-&amp;nbsp;years old, weighing about 135&amp;nbsp;pounds, with light brown hair, and wearing a white shirt with khaki trousers. Mrs. James reported that before the girl met the boy, she seemed nervous by biting her lips a lot and going to the door frequently. She also inquired about local hotels. A few moments after their departure, Mrs. James received a phone call from a woman asking if "Miss Virginia Carpenter" was there. Mrs. James learned the next morning about Carpenter's disappearance and reported her sighting to the police. [[Bowie County]] Sheriff Bill Presley and [[FBI]] agent H. S. Hallett showed Mrs. James two groups of pictures in which she pointed out Carpenter as the girl she had seen. Police checked hotels and tourist camps but came up with nothing. Later, Mrs. James was uncertain of her identification of the girl.&lt;ref name="Denton Chronicle, Jan 30" /&gt;

On Saturday, June 12, a girl matching Carpenter's description was reported riding in a car with two boys in [[Mena, Arkansas]] (47&amp;nbsp;miles from DeQueen).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Texarkana Gazette|title=Clue to Missing Girl Sought Over Arkansas|date=June 14, 1948|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Michigan]] tourist in [[Tucson, Arizona]] reported seeing a girl matching Carpenter's description on July 8 after seeing her reward poster in a local [[Coffeehouse|cafe]]. By July 12, Mrs. Carpenter said she had checked all leads in the case but was no closer to learning of her daughter's whereabouts.

On Friday, January 14, 1949, [[Houston Press (Scripps Howard)|Houston Press]] received a letter written in pencil, signed by Mrs. Gladys Bass from [[Chireno, Texas]] who claimed that she and her friends met a girl who was well-dressed and well-educated who had been [[hitchhiking]]. The girl told them she was hungry and had no money. "She called herself Virginia. She talked properly, had long brown curly hair that touched her shoulders, and wore a white hat with a feather in it, a striped dress and blue sweater," she wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Austin American|title=Letter Recalls Disappearance of Girl From TSCW Campus|date=January 15, 1949|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said while they were eating at a cafe, the girl claimed to have run away. They all departed thinking that she was telling a story. It was not until later they believed that the girl was Carpenter, but the police were unable to substantiate Bass's report.

== Theories ==

Since Virginia went missing, different theories have been proposed as the reason for her disappearance, including running away, leaving with a lover, being kidnapped, being murdered, amnesia, or even being sold into a [[Forced prostitution|white slavery]] ring. [[Psychiatrists]] and doctors who were consulted, stated she had nothing to run away from but had rather enthusiastically looked forward to the future.&lt;ref name="Denton Chronicle, Jan 30" /&gt; It was also suggested that her body could have been weighed down and sunken in Lake Dallas, which was too large and too deep to be dragged. Virginia knew three of the victims who were murdered by the "Phantom Killer", and thus, it was wondered if he had something to do with her disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=8 May 2014|newspaper=Texarkana Gazette|title=Vanished: 1948 case remains unsolved|author=Russell McDermott|date=May 1, 2013|page=7A|url=http://www.texarkanagazette.com/news/opinion/editorials/story/2013/may/01/vanished-1948-case-remains-unsolved/314009/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Michael|title=The Texarkana Moonlight Murders : The Unsolved Case of the 1946 Phantom Killer|date=2013|isbn=978-0786473250|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rigler" /&gt;

Texas Ranger Lewis Rigler concluded she was dead because he believed there was no reason for her to disappear. He said she did not owe anyone any money, she had no criminal past, no jealous ex-boyfriends, no lovers convincing her to run away, and according to a medical exam before her disappearance, she was not pregnant.&lt;ref name="Baytown Sun" /&gt;

== Personal life ==

[[File:CarpenterFamily.jpg|thumb| Virginia Carpenter with her family at [[Caddo Gap]] Lake in the Arkansas [[Ozarks]] when she was nine]]
Mary Carpenter was born January 25, 1927 in Texarkana. She was a healthy baby, mostly feeding from [[Holstein cattle|Holstein milk]] which was suggested by her maternal grandfather who eventually gave the family a Holstein cow. She began walking at a young age and as her mother put it, she "inherited a bad streak from me of wanting to walk a little too far from home."&lt;ref name="2 June 1950"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Denton Record-Chronicle|title=Virginia Carpenter's Days of Childhood Are Reviewed|date=June 2, 1950|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; To keep her from doing so, Mrs. Carpenter would scare her daughter by telling her that big dogs roamed the streets.

When she was three, Miss Carpenter rolled down the back steps at her home and hit a tree. [[X-rays]] showed that she had no injuries. Three months afterward, she caught a bad case of [[influenza]] and could not walk. Her parents diligently searched for a cause for her illness but [[medical science]] at the time could not diagnose her. She got better for a while but then a severe attack left her badly crippled.&lt;ref name="2 June 1950" /&gt;
The family went through many [[orthopedic surgeons]] until one in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] found an infection in her right [[hip bone]]. It left [[perforations]] in it similar to tiny pinholes. Virginia was placed in a contraption for a few months that pulled her leg back into proper position. Too young to understand, Carpenter was given [[internal medicine]], a diet, and the task to [[sunbathe]] on the hospital's tar roof for two hours a day for two years.&lt;ref name="2 June 1950" /&gt; She was able to walk better with the use of a steel brace that fitted into the heel of her shoe which then came up to a leather-rolled "saddle" around her hip. Mrs. Carpenter admitted to making the mistake of placing Virginia in [[kindergarten]] while she was still in the brace. Virginia soon became [[self-conscious]] and lost weight due to a loss of appetite. She was taken out of school but returned a year later when the brace was removed. She was announced "completely cured" by a specialist when she was 12. She was one of only four [[medical history|complete case histories]] compiled for the [[American Medical Association]].&lt;ref name="2 June 1950" /&gt;
[[File:Last known picture.jpg|thumb|left|Last known picture of Virginia taken by a friend from Texarkana Junior College at the yearly picnic in [[Daingerfield]]]]
[[File:Mary Virginia Carpenter.jpg|thumb|right|Photo of Virginia]]
Not long after going to [[Arkansas High School]] with her cousin, her father became seriously ill. He died two years later when she was 15. She was not bright in school, but her teachers described her as a child with an unusual amount of [[common sense]] and loyalty. She was a quiet girl and rarely participated in activities because she tired easily and had a limp in her right leg from her childhood disease. She joined the band and became a [[majorette (dancer)|majorette]]. Because of her participation in activities, she joined a [[sorority]] after receiving a bid from each one.&lt;ref name="June 4, 1950"&gt;{{cite news|title=Virginia Carpenter Found Happiness An Elusive Thing|newspaper=Denton Record-Chronicle|date=June 4, 1950|author=Bob Brock}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from Arkansas High in 1944, she went to the [[University of Arkansas]] to study [[journalism]]. After a year, she came home and told her mother that she wanted to go into laboratory technician training but it required something she did not take in high school (science). She went to TSCW from September 1945 until February 1946 when she had to quit and take care of her mother who became ill. She planned on finishing her schooling within a year.

After her mother became ill, she underwent major surgery. A week later, Virginia was struck with [[appendicitis]] and was also operated on. A month later, they were both taken home by an "Aggie" (a student from [[Texas A&amp;M University]]) named Mac. Virginia fell in love with Mac, became engaged, and set a date for their wedding. Her grandparents did not approve of the engagement. Three weeks before their wedding date, Virginia broke it off. Virginia's mother said, "I loved Mac because of his fine qualities and because he was so good to me, but I couldn't see their two personalities living together in harmony."&lt;ref name="June 4, 1950" /&gt;
Virginia soon started working for a clinic. She wanted to be a nurse but knew that her right leg would not support the strenuous hours of being on her feet. She decided instead to be a technician. Mrs. Carpenter revealed that Virginia wanted to be a technician because medical science did not find a cure for her father. Virginia wanted to return to school but worried about finances. She then took a job at an insurance firm because it paid a better salary. She stayed with the firm until August 1947 when she had enough money to go back to school. She started the next month at [[Texarkana Junior College]]. She now had her future planned: she could go to TSCW in the summer which would enable her to attend the technician training in the [[autumn]] of 1948.

Ten days before school was out, Virginia went to the annual picnic from Texarkana Junior College at a lake near [[Daingerfield, Texas]]. She left with her date and another couple. About 5 p.m. that evening, Virginia came home and said she did not feel well. Mrs. Carpenter said her daughter "was one of the most sunburned persons I had ever seen."&lt;ref name="June 4, 1950" /&gt; Virginia fell across her bed and went to sleep. Hazel woke her for supper but Virginia said she did not feel like eating. She came to the dinner table but [[fainted]]. She regained consciousness while her mother was taking her to the bathroom and then she fainted again and fell to the floor. Mrs. Carpenter did not think she would revive. She picked her up and put her in the bed before calling a doctor. While waiting for the doctor, Virginia regained consciousness and then fainted again, due to [[heat syncope|sunstroke]]. She was diagnosed with [[second degree burn|second-degree sunburn]]. He prescribed her with rest and quiet for a few days. After the third day, Virginia made an effort to take her [[final exams]] at school. While there, she told her teachers about her love affair that did not work out and that she fell in love again but the boy did not love her.&lt;ref name="June 4, 1950" /&gt;

In the last few months before her disappearance, she took up [[sketch (drawing)|sketching]] and became quite good through the coaching of a friend. Mrs. Carpenter said that a portrait Virginia did from memory of her father was one of the best likeness she had ever seen. Virginia was recovering from her sunburn when she packed for her trip to Denton. Mrs. Carpenter wanted to take Virginia to Denton in the car, but she insisted that she would be fine on the train. On June 1, the day of her disappearance, they ran to the station and caught the train moments before it left. "I was so in hopes we would find the train gone so that I could drive her down the next morning. There was a tinge of disappointment when I saw the train had not left, but she refused to get on until she kissed me goodbye; and as she stood on the rear platform of the train waving goodbye, I wondered if there was anyone more radiant and beautiful. In my heart I offered a silent prayer because she was mine."&lt;ref name="June 4, 1950" /&gt;

'''Dulcie May Markham''' (27 February 1914 – 20 April 1976) was a prominent Sydney prostitute and associate of gangland figures in Sydney during the 1930s, 1940's and 1950s, when she was closely involved with the [[razor gang]] milieu of that era of organised crime within that city. During her criminal career, she had amassed 100 convictions in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland &amp; Western Australia for prostitution, vagrancy, consorting, assaulting police and the public, keeping a brothel, drunkenness and drunk driving, and was sent to prison on numerous occasions.&lt;ref&gt;L.Writer, ''Razor'' . Chapter 22: ''Pretty Dulcie.''  Pan Macmillan, Australia&lt;/ref&gt; Dulcie was known in the media as ''The Angel of Death'', ''The Black Widow'' and ''Pretty Dulcie.''

''[[The Daily Mirror (Australia)|The Daily Mirror]]'', a former Sydney newspaper, summed up her career in crime thus: "Dulcie Markham saw more violence and death than any other woman in Australia's history".&lt;ref&gt;Bill Jenkings, "Dulcie Markham Obituary", ''Daily Mirror'' (21 April 1976).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and notable criminal liaisons==
Dulcie May Markham was born in the inner city Sydney suburb of [[Surry Hills, New South Wales|Surry Hills]] on 27 February 1914 to John Markham and Florence Millicent née Parker.&lt;ref&gt;NSW BDM&lt;/ref&gt; She became one of Australia's most notorious prostitutes and underworld figures. She became a prostitute when she was 15 and Sydney's most extravagant [[Gun moll|gangster's moll]] by the time she was 18. She was attracted to, and associated with, many major criminals of the era. On 13 May 1931, stallkeeper Alfred Dillon and gunman Cecil "Scotty" McCormack came to blows over the attentions of Markham and in the resultant melee, Dillon stabbed McCormack to death.&lt;ref&gt;Morton and Lobez, 2007:96.&lt;/ref&gt; Her first marriage was to a sideshow worker and small time mobster Frank Bowen in Brisbane on 4 March 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Qld BDM&lt;/ref&gt; 2 months later, Dulcie was in court accused of falsifying a telegram on behalf of her new husband.&lt;ref&gt;Brisbane Telegraph, 24 May 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1936, Markham was involved with Guido Caletti, another notorious Sydney gunman, the then husband of [[Nellie Cameron]], another prominent Sydney sex worker of that period. Caletti was shot dead in August 1939 at a party he attended with Markham.&lt;ref&gt;"MURDER CHARGE- Shooting of Caletti", ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' (11 August 1939):11.&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Markham was grief-stricken at his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;Morton and Lobez, 2007: 156&lt;/ref&gt;

By December 1937, Markham had shifted to [[Melbourne]] and now had gunman Arthur Taplin as her pimp and lover. Taplin was subsequently shot dead later that year. Then in 1940, her first husband, Frank Bowen, was shot and killed in [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]]

In 1943, Markham relocated to [[Queensland]]'s [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]]to take advantage of the influx of American GI's. When picked up for vagrancy by local police, she protested that she lived with her current ''de facto'' husband, Arthur Williams, and that while he gave her money and groceries, she was not involved in the local sex industry at that time, and was not aware of Williams' involvement in the [[sly-grog]] or bootleg alcohol distribution networks that flouted wartime beer and spirits rationing mandates. She also used the pseudonyms and aliases: "Dulcie Williams", "Dulcie Bowen", "Tosca de Marquis", "Mary Eugene", and "Tosca de Merene" during that period.&lt;ref&gt;Vince Kelly. ''Rugged Angel'' (Angus &amp; Robertson, 1961).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morton and Lobez, 2007:106.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1945, her then boyfriend and leading Melbourne criminal Leslie Walkerden, was shot dead in [[Richmond, Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;"Killed in Shooting at Richmond; Victim well known to Police", ''The Argus'' (13 September 1945):5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, Markham was accused and stood trial for conspiracy to murder Valma Hull,&lt;ref&gt;"Woman Charged on Murder Plot", ''The Courier Mail'' (12 August 1947):3.&lt;/ref&gt; the wife of Keith Kitchener Hull, who had shot and killed another Sydney gangland figure, Donald "The Duck" Day, in January 1945.&lt;ref&gt;"Day – Murder Charge", ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' (31 January 1945):5.&lt;/ref&gt; Markham and Edwin Martin, her current liaison, had visited a boarding house owned by Mrs Hull and had demanded to see her. Charges were later dropped when another pair of local gunmen, Charles Martin and George Barrett, were charged with an attack on Hull, but also acquitted a month later.&lt;ref&gt;Morton and Lobez, 2007: 128&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 1951, Markham was shot in the hip at a wild party that turned violent in [[St Kilda, Victoria]]. Her then boyfriend, Gavin Walsh was shot and killed at the same party. Three months later, while still recovering from the shooting, she married Leonard "Redda" Lewis, who was later shot in Melbourne on 22 April 1952. They didn't live together again and were later divorced.

Markham faced Central Police Court for soliciting one final time in 1957 before retiring from prostitution. In January 1959, Markham stood before a special Federal Court on a charge of not having filed a tax return for 1957. She was found guilty and fined £50 with £1 costs.

==Later years==
 Markham married Martin Rooney in 1972 in Sydney (according to her death certificate), and gave up her criminal career. After this period, little more is known about Markham's subsequent life, until her death in a house fire at her home at 12 Moore Street, [[Bondi, New South Wales|Bondi]] on 20 April 1976. Markham had outlived most of her criminal contemporaries from Sydney's tempestuous [[razor gang]] era. Markham's funeral was held at St Patrick's Catholic Church, Bondi and the eulogy was given by Detective [[Frank Farrell (rugby league)|Frank "Bumper" Farrell]]. She was cremated at [[Eastern Suburbs Memorial Park]].&lt;ref&gt;"Dulcie May Rooney" death Notice, ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' (22 April 1976).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Markham was one of the figures from that era featured in an exhibition about that era at Sydney's Justice and Police Museum, entitled "Femmes Fatales: The Female Criminal."&lt;ref&gt;"Lure of the Bad Girl: ABC News: 17 March 2009: http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2009/03/17/2518406.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eli Biham''' ({{lang-he|אלי ביהם}}) is an Israeli [[cryptographer]] and [[Cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]], currently a professor at the [[Technion]] Israeli Institute of Technology Computer Science department. Starting from October 2008 and till 2013, Biham was the dean of the Technion Computer Science department, after serving for two years as chief of CS graduate school.
Biham received his Ph.D. for inventing (publicly) [[differential cryptanalysis]], while working under [[Adi Shamir]]. It had, it turned out, been invented at least twice before. A team at [[IBM]] discovered it during their work on [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]], and was requested/required to keep their discovery secret by the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], who evidently knew about it as well.

==Contributions to cryptanalysis==
Among his many contributions to cryptanalysis one can count:

* [[differential cryptanalysis]] - publicly invented during his Ph.D. studies under [[Adi Shamir]]
* Attacking all triple modes of operation.
* [[impossible differential cryptanalysis]] - joint work with [[Adi Shamir]] and [[Alex Biryukov]]
* Breaking (together with [[Lars Knudsen]]) the ANSI X9.52 CBCM mode (few days before the final standardization)
* Breaking the [[GSM]] security mechanisms (with Elad Barkan and Nathan Keller)
* Co-invention of [[related-key attack]]s.
* [[Differential Fault Analysis]] - joint work with [[Adi Shamir]]

===New cryptographic primitives===
Biham has taken part in the design of several new cryptographic primitives:

* [[Serpent (cipher)|Serpent]] (with [[Ross J. Anderson|Ross Anderson]] and [[Lars Knudsen]]), a [[block cipher]]  which was one of the final five contenders to become the [[Advanced Encryption Standard process|Advanced Encryption Standard]]
* [[Tiger (hash)|Tiger]] (with [[Ross J. Anderson|Ross Anderson]]), a [[hash function]] fast on 64-bit machines, and
* [[Py (cipher)|Py]] (with [[Jennifer Seberry]]), one of a family of fast [[stream cipher]]s (see article for more detail on their cryptanalytic status).
* SHAvite-3 (with Orr Dunkelman), a [[hash function]] which was one of the 14 semifinalists in the [[NIST hash function competition]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9038">[[Archbishop]] '''Francis Mansour Zayek''' (born October 18, 1920, [[Manzanillo, Cuba]] – died on September 14, 2010) was a [[prelate]] of the [[Maronite Church]]. He was the founding [[eparch]] of the [[Maronite Catholic Eparchy of Saint Maron of Brooklyn]], an [[Eastern Catholic]] [[diocese]] based in [[Brooklyn, New York]], which covers the eastern coast of the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=miami&gt;{{cite news|first=Ana |last=Rodriguez-Soto|title=Archbishop Francis M. Zayek, 89, Founding bishop of Maronite diocese in U.S., who retired to Fort Lauderdale| url=http://www.miamiarch.org/ip.asp?op=Article_109171602641|work=[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami]] |publisher=|date=2010-09-17|accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Zayek was born in [[Manzanillo, Cuba]], one of the eight children of Mansour Zayek and Mariam Khoury, on October 18, 1920. The family moved from Cuba back to their homeland of [[Lebanon]] in 1931, then part of the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon]] and settled in their native city of [[Ghazir, Lebanon|Ghazir]]. Inspired by an uncle, Father George Zayek, the local [[pastor]], he felt drawn to the [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]]. For much of his youth, he felt drawn to enter the [[Franciscan]] Order for service as a missionary to Asia.&lt;ref name=TMV&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.stmaron.org/Maronite_Voice_for_October_2010.pdf|work=The Maronite Voice|volume=VI|issue=IX|date=October 2010|title=The Maronite Church in the U.S. Mourns the Death of Its First Shepherd|accessdate=January 4, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508152752/http://www.stmaron.org/Maronite_Voice_for_October_2010.pdf|archivedate=May 8, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of that path, Zayek applied to the [[seminary]] of the Maronite Church in his hometown, with the approval of his local bishop, [[Elias Richa]], the Archbishop of [[Baalbek]]. He excelled in his studies at the seminary, being fluent in
[[Arabic]] as well as in [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (and later in Italian, Portuguese and English) and the archbishop decided to send him to [[Rome]] for further studies, where he continued to gain honors. He spent [[World War II]] studying at the [[Urban College]], where he gained a [[diploma]] in philosophy. He later recounted the struggle the seminarians faced to find food in that period.&lt;ref name=TMV /&gt; After graduating, he was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] a Maronite Catholic [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] in the chapel of the College on March 17, 1946.&lt;ref name=miami/&gt;&lt;ref name=TMV /&gt; Zayek became incardinated in Lebanon.

Zayek then earned [[doctorate]]s in both [[theology]] and [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] at the [[Lateran University]]. After completing his studies, Zayek was sent to [[Cairo]], Egypt, where he was appointed by [[Boutros Deeb]], the Maronite Archbishop of Cairo, as [[rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of the Maronite Cathedral of the Holy Family there, and a judge in the Catholic tribunals of the city. He also served as an assistant to the [[Papal Nuncio]] there. He later returned to Rome where he served as a judge of the [[Roman Rota]] and as a consultant in canon law at the [[Pontifical Atheneum of St. Anselm]] and at the Lateran University.&lt;ref name=TMV /&gt;

===Bishop===

====Brazil====
On May 30, 1962,  [[Pope John XXIII]] appointed Zayek to head the Maronite Apostolic [[Exarchate]] (the equivalent in the [[Eastern Churches]] of a [[Vicariate Apostolic]]) for Maronites in Brazil, the first Maronite bishop to serve outside of the [[Middle East]]. He was [[consecration|consecrated]] bishop at a ceremony held in [[Dimane]], Lebanon, on August 5, 1962, by [[Mar]] [[Paul Peter Meouchi]], [[List of Maronite Patriarchs|Maronite Patriarch of Antioch]], and his co-consecrators were Peter Sfair, Ordinary Bishop for Maronites in Rome, and [[Abdallah Nujaim]], Eparch of [[Maronite Catholic Eparchy of Baalbek-Deir El Ahmar|Baalbek]]. The pope, in appointing him, told him, “What you Maronites have does not pertain to you alone but is part of the treasure of the Catholic Church".&lt;ref name=TMV /&gt;

Officially an [[auxiliary bishop]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro]], and [[titular bishop]] of [[Callinicum dei Maroniti]], Zayek served as bishop for the Maronites of that country until 1966.&lt;ref name=ch&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Archbishop Francis Mansour Zayek|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bzayek.html |work=Catholic Hierarchy|accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second Vatican Council====
Zayek was one of the last surviving bishops who had attended all four sessions of the [[Second Vatican Council]] between 1962 and 1965 as a bishop.&lt;ref name=miami/&gt;

====The United States====
On January 27, 1966, the [[Venerable]] [[Pope Paul VI]] established a similar exarchate for the United States, and transferred Zayek to serve as its first [[exarch]]. He was installed in [[Detroit]], the seat of the exarchate, on June 11, 1966. He arrived in the United States with just a rudimentary knowledge of English, and found an unfinished cathedral and neither a residence nor offices ready for him. As he had needed to do in Brazil, he worked to unify the Maronite Catholics of the country.&lt;ref name=TMV /&gt;

Zayek had to face many challenges. First was the very identity of the Church. Arguments raged as to whether it was to be a transplant of Lebanese life or an American institution rooted in its Lebanese heritage. In this he remained guided by the words of Pope John. Additionally, he had to deal with the [[liturgy|liturgical]] changes mandated by the Vatican Council. He had the Maronite [[Divine Liturgy]] translated into English for the first time, creating a standardized service for use in every parish of the exarchate.&lt;ref name=TMV /&gt;

Pope Paul elevated the exarchate to a full [[eparchy]], or diocese, on November 29, 1971, and appointed Zayek as the first bishop of the Eparchy of St. Maron of Detroit. Zayek was installed as its first bishop on June 4, 1972. The seat of the eparchy was moved from Detroit to the Church of St. [[Maron]] in Brooklyn on 27 June 1977 and renamed the Eparchy of St. Maron of Brooklyn.&lt;ref name=ch /&gt;

To honor his years of service, [[Pope John Paul II]] promoted Zayek to the personal rank of archbishop on December 10, 1982.&lt;ref name=ch /&gt; He retired on November 11, 1996, when he reached the mandatory retirement age of 75. He then moved to [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], where he served at [[Our Lady of Lebanon]] Maronite Catholic Church in [[Miami]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref name=miami/&gt;

====Awards====

Zayek was a member of the Maronite Patriarchal Synod and received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor.

===Death===
When Zayek's health began to falter in late 2009, he returned to Lebanon.&lt;ref name=cna&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Bishop Stika expected to fully recover from mild heart attack| url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/bishop_stika_expected_to_fully_recover_from_mild_heart_attack/|work=[[Catholic News Agency]] |publisher=|date=2009-08-20|accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on September 14, 2010, at the age of 89, and was buried there. He was survived by his sister, Lydia, a resident of Lebanon, and his brother, Elias, a resident of Brazil.&lt;ref name=miami/&gt;

==Tribute==
Eparch [[Gregory John Mansour|Gregory J. Mansour]], a successor, wrote in reaction to Zayek's death, "The Maronite Church in the United States is deeply indebted to the archbishop for his zealous efforts in establishing the strong, vibrant Maronite community we have today...May Archbishop Zayek share in the glory of the Cross which we celebrate this day!"&lt;ref name=miami/&gt;

'''Don García de Silva Figueroa''' (December 29, 1550 – July 22, 1624) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[diplomat]], and the first Western traveller to correctly identify the ruins of '''Takht-e Jamshid''' in [[Persia]] as the location of [[Persepolis]], the ancient capital of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] and one of the great cities of antiquity.

== Life and work ==

De Silva was born in [[Zafra]] in the Spanish province of [[Badajoz]]. He served in the military in [[Flanders]], and later was appointed governor of Badajoz. In 1612, [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]], King of both [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], chose De Silva as his ambassador to the court of [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas]], the [[Safavid]] monarch. Before he could reach Persia, however, De Silva was detained in [[Goa]] due to his strong disagreements with its Portuguese [[viceroy]], and he did not arrive at his destination until October 1617.

De Silva's embassy was Philip III's return to the two Abbas I had sent to him shortly before, one of them in the person of the Englishman [[Robert Shirley]] and the other in the ones of the Persian [[Dengiz Beg Rumlu|Dengiz Beg]] and the Portuguese [[Augustinian]] [[friar]] [[Antonio de Gouvea]].

During his stay in Persia, De Silva dealt with various diplomatic issues of importance, including the sealing of an alliance against the [[Ottoman Empire]], a longstanding enemy of the three powers involved: Persia, Portugal and Spain.

De Silva travelled extensively throughout Persia, visiting the cities of [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]], [[Qom]] and [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]] among others. He went to see the ruins of Persepolis, and described its splendours in a vivid letter to the [[Alfonso de la Cueva, marqués de Bedmar]]. This letter made a great impression in the learned circles of Europe, and was quickly translated into [[Latin]] and English. In Isfahan he met the Italian traveller [[Pietro della Valle]], who later went to Goa following the way De Silva had done to reach there.

On his travels, De Silva had amassed a large collection of rare art objects; these he tried to take home with him to Spain when his sojourn ended in 1619. He wrote a full account of his travels under the title ''Totius legationis suae et Indicarum rerum Persidisque commentarii''. It was translated into French by the [[Dutch people|Dutchman]] [[Abraham de Wicquefort]] in 1667. The original manuscript is preserved today in the National Library in [[Madrid]], and was published completely for the first time there in 1903.

De Silva's memoirs contain a great deal of detailed information relating to Persian [[geography]], history and [[culture]]. He described, among many other things, the funerary practices of the [[Zoroastrians]], the sport of organized [[bull-fighting]] in Persian towns, and the cultivation of [[date palm]]s in southern Iran. His narrative is now regarded as a valuable source document on early 17th-century Persia.

De Silva's return trip to Spain was eventful and frustrating. He reached [[Ormuz]] and Goa in 1621, and then, in 1622, [[Mozambique]], but too late in season to round the [[Cape of Good Hope]] he had to go back again to Goa. When, after a long delay, he was able to re-embark for Spain. He died at sea before reaching his destination.

'''Henry Flitcroft''' (30 August 1697 – 25 February 1769) was a major English [[architect]] in the second generation of [[Palladianism]]. He came from a simple background: his father was a labourer in the gardens at [[Hampton Court]] and he began as a joiner by trade. Working as a carpenter at [[Burlington House]], he fell from a scaffold and broke his leg. While he was recuperating, the young [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]] noticed his talent with the pencil, and by 1720 Flitcroft was Burlington's draughtsman and general architectural assistant, surveying at [[Westminster School]] for Burlington's dormitory, and superintending at the site at [[Tottenham House]]. Working life in the inner circle that was driving the new [[Palladian architecture]] was an education for Flitcroft.

Flitcroft redrew for publication the drawings for ''The Designs of Mr. Inigo Jones,'' published by [[William Kent]] in 1727, under Burlington's patronage and supervision. In May 1726 Burlington got his protégé an appointment at the [[Office of Works]], where he worked his way up from Master Carpenter and Master Mason to [[Comptroller of the King's Works]], a prestigious position at the top of the architectural field. Royal commissions came his way in the form of some private projects for junior members of the [[British Royal Family]]; namely the [[Duke of Cumberland]]. His work for the Duke  at [[Windsor Great Park]] included creating the [[Virginia Water Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|desc=THE ROYAL ESTATE, WINDSOR: VIRGINIA WATER LAKE AND THE TRIANGULAR BELVEDERE|num=1001177||accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flitcroft's hands were constantly occupied with private commissions and, like most professional architects (and unlike virtuoso earls), he did some speculative construction in new-building London streets, supplied stone, and contracted to erect the buildings he was designing.

Panelling and a mantelpiece from an old panelled room designed by Flitcroft in the 1720s from [[Potternewton|Potternewton Hall]] near [[Leeds]] were installed in [[Sutton Park, Yorkshire|Sutton Park]] in Yorkshire after 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=A photographic Archive of Leeds|first1=Leodis|title=Potternewton Hall, Potternewton Lane|url=http://www.leodis.net/display.aspx?resourceIdentifier=20081113_167863|publisher= Leeds City Council|accessdate =23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1746 to 1756, he was [[Surveyor of the Fabric of St Paul's Cathedral]].

'''Jackson Carey Frank''' (March 2, 1943&amp;nbsp;– March 3, 1999) was an American [[folk music]]ian. He released his first and only  [[Jackson C. Frank (album)|eponymous album]] in 1965, produced by [[Paul Simon]]. After the release of the record, Frank was plagued by a series of personal issues, and was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]] and protracted depression that prevented him from maintaining his career.

Frank spent his later life homeless and destitute, and died in 1999 of pneumonia. Though he only released one record, he has been cited as an influence by many singer-songwriters, including [[Paul Simon]], [[Sandy Denny]], [[Bert Jansch]] and [[Nick Drake]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' journalist [[David Fricke]] called Frank "one of the best forgotten songwriters of the 1960s."{{Sfn|Abbott|2014|p=6}}

==Biography==
===Early life===
Frank was born Jackson Carey Jones March 2, 1943 in [[Buffalo, New York]], the only child of Marilyn Rochefort Jones and Jack Jones, a test pilot.{{Sfn|Abbott|2014|p=21}} He later took on the surname of his stepfather, Elmer Frank, an army officer and food chemist.{{Sfn|Abbott|2014|p=23}}

On March 23, 1954, when Frank was eleven years old, a furnace exploded at his school, [[1954 Cleveland Hill School District fire|Cleveland Hill Elementary School]] in [[Cheektowaga]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=Means1995&gt;{{cite journal|last=Means|first=Andrew|title=Game, Set, Blues|journal=Folk Roots|year=1995|issue=146/147|url=http://www.hut-six.co.uk/jcfrank/froots.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fire killed fifteen of his fellow students, including Marlene du Pont, Frank's then girlfriend, about whom he would later write the song "Marlene".{{Sfn|Abbott|2014|pages=13–14}} Frank survived, but suffered burns to over fifty percent of his body.&lt;ref name=Means1995/&gt; The trauma from the burns also caused extensive damage to his [[parathyroid gland]]s, resulting in an unregulated buildup of [[calcium]] in his body that led to extensive joint problems.{{Sfn|Abott|2014|p=25}}

During his hospital stay he was introduced to music when a teacher, Charlie Castelli, brought Frank an acoustic guitar to keep him occupied during the recovery. He was influenced greatly by [[Elvis Presley]] as a teenager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folkblues.co.uk/artistsfrank.html|work=Folk Blues &amp; Beyond|title=Jackson C. Frank (1943–1999)|first=T.J.|last=McGrath|accessdate=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, he traveled to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] with his mother to meet Elvis at a [[meet and greet]] event for the children injured in the Cleveland Hill fire.{{Sfn|Abbott|2014|p=32}} When he was 21, he received an insurance payout of $110,500 for his injuries, enough for him to "catch a boat to England."&lt;ref name=Means1995/&gt;

===Debut album===
His eponymous 1965 album, ''[[Jackson C. Frank (album)|Jackson C. Frank]]'', was produced by [[Paul Simon]] while the two of them were living in England immersed in the burgeoning local folk scene. Frank was so shy during the recording that he asked to be shielded by screens so that Paul Simon, [[Art Garfunkel]], and [[Al Stewart]] could not see him, claiming 'I can't play. You're looking at me.' The best-known track from the sessions, "[[Blues Run the Game]]", was covered by [[Simon and Garfunkel]], and later by [[Wizz Jones]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wizzjones.com/disc_luckyman.html|title=WizzJones.com - Discography - Lucky The Man|publisher=|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Counting Crows]], [[John Mayer]], [[Mark Lanegan]], Headless Heroes, [[Colin Meloy]], [[Bert Jansch]], [[Eddi Reader]], [[Laura Marling]] and [[Robin Pecknold]] (as White Antelope), while [[Nick Drake]] also recorded it privately. Another song, "Milk and Honey", appeared in  [[Vincent Gallo]]'s film ''[[The Brown Bunny]]'', and was also covered by [[Fairport Convention]], [[Nick Drake]], and [[Sandy Denny]], whom he dated for a while. During their relationship, Jackson convinced Sandy to give up her nursing profession to concentrate on music full-time.

Although Frank was well received in England for a while, in 1966 things took a turn for the worse as his mental health began to unravel. At the same time he began to experience writer's block. As his insurance payment was on the verge of running out he decided to go back to the United States for two years. When he returned to England in 1968 he seemed a different person to his friends. His depression, stemming from the childhood trauma of the classroom fire, had grown worse, and he had completely lost whatever little self-confidence he once possessed. Al Stewart recalled that:

{{quote|He [Frank] proceeded to fall apart before our very eyes. His style that everyone loved was melancholy, very tuneful things. He started doing things that were completely impenetrable. They were basically about psychological angst, played at full volume with lots of thrashing. I don't remember a single word of them, it just did not work. There was one review that said he belonged on a psychologist's couch. Then shortly after that, he hightailed it back to [[Woodstock (town), New York|Woodstock]] again, because he wasn't getting any work.&lt;ref name=Means1995/&gt;}}

===Woodstock===
While in Woodstock, he married Elaine Sedgwick, an English former [[fashion model]]. They had a son and later a daughter, Angeline. After his son died of [[cystic fibrosis]], Frank went into a period of even greater depression and was ultimately committed to a mental institution. By the early 1970s Frank began to beg aid from friends. In 1975, [[Karl Dallas]] wrote an enthusiastic piece in the British weekly music newspaper ''[[Melody Maker]]'', and in 1978, Frank's 1965 album was re-released as ''Jackson Frank Again'', with a new cover sleeve, although this did not in the end make his music much more popular outside of a small number of his fans.

===Later life and death===
Frank lived with his parents in [[Elma, New York]] for a few years in the early 1980s. In 1984, his mother, who had been in hospital for [[open heart surgery]], returned home to find Frank missing with no note or forwarding address. Frank had gone to New York City in a desperate bid to find Paul Simon, but ended up homeless and sleeping on the sidewalk. During this time he found himself in and out of various psychiatric institutions.

Frank was treated for [[paranoid schizophrenia]], a diagnosis that was denied by Frank himself—he maintained that he was suffering from depression caused by the trauma he had experienced as a child. Just as Frank's prospects seemed to be at their worst, a fan from the Woodstock area, Jim Abbott, discovered him in the early 1990s. Abbott had been discussing music with Mark Anderson, a teacher at the local [[college]] he was attending. The conversation had turned to [[folk music]], which they both enjoyed, when Abbott asked the teacher if he had heard of Frank. He recollected:

{{quote|I hadn't even thought about it for a couple of years, and he goes, "Well yes, as a matter of fact, I just got a letter from him. Do you feel like helping a down-on-his-luck folk singer?"&lt;ref name=Means1995/&gt;}}

Frank, who had known Anderson from their days at Gettysburg College, had decided to write him to ask if there was anywhere in Woodstock he could stay after he had made up his mind to leave New York City. Abbott phoned Frank, and then organized a temporary placement for him at a senior citizens' home in Woodstock. Abbott was stunned by what he saw when he found Frank in New York:

{{quote|When I went down I hadn't seen a picture of him, except for his album cover. Then, he was thin and young. When I went to see him, there was this heavy guy hobbling down the street, and I thought, 'That can't possibly be him'...I just stopped and said 'Jackson?' and it was him. My impression was, 'Oh my God', it was almost like the elephant man or something. He was so unkempt, disheveled." A further [[Unintended consequence|side effect]] of the fire was a [[thyroid]] malfunction causing him to put on weight. "He had nothing. It was really sad. We went and had lunch and went back to his room. It almost made me cry, because here was a fifty-year-old man, and all he had to his name was a beat-up old suitcase and a broken pair of glasses. I guess his [[caseworker (social work)|caseworker]] had given him a $10 guitar, but it wouldn't stay in tune. It was one of those hot summer days. He tried to play "[[Blues Run The Game]]" for me, but his voice was pretty much shot.&lt;ref name=Means1995/&gt;}}

Soon after this, Frank found himself sitting on a bench in [[Queens, New York City|Queens]] while awaiting his move to Woodstock, when he was shot with a [[pellet gun]] and blinded through his left eye.{{Sfn|Abbott|2014|p=194}} At first the shooter could not be found, but it was later determined that local kids had been firing the pellet gun indiscriminately at people and Frank happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.{{Sfn|Abbott|2014|pages=194–195}}

Abbott then promptly helped him move to Woodstock. During this time, Frank began recording some demos of new songs. Frank's resurfacing led to the first CD release of his self-titled album. In later pressings, Frank's demos from the 70s were included as a bonus disc with the album, and an anthology entitled [[Blues Run the Game]] contained all these tracks as well as his final demos made in the '90s. In 2014 an album of Frank's unreleased demos — "Forest of Eden" — was released through London based record label [[Secret Records]]. The collection includes his unheard song, "Forest of Eden", alongside 1950s demo recordings of "Heartbreak Hotel"; two Christmas songs, called "Santa Bring My Baby Back To Me" and "Precious Lord" (with a spoken word greeting to his grandparents); and three home-recorded demos of his original songs made prior to his 1965 album. These original song demos are of "I Want To Be Alone", "Here Comes The Blues", and "You Never Wanted Me". The only available recordings of Frank yet to be officially released are songs made for the BBC Radio 1 show "Nightride" in 1968, but they only exist as poor quality off-air sources.

Frank died of pneumonia and cardiac arrest in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]], on March 3, 1999, at the age of 56.

==Legacy==
Though he never achieved fame during his lifetime, his songs have been covered by many well-known artists, including Simon and Garfunkel, John Mayer, [[Counting Crows]], [[Nick Drake]], [[Sandy Denny]], [[Bert Jansch]], [[John Renbourn]], [[Laura Marling]], and [[Robin Pecknold]] (as White Antelope) of [[Fleet Foxes]].

Nick Drake covered 4 songs from Frank's debut album, "Here Come the Blues", "Blues Run the Game", "Milk &amp; Honey", and "Kimbie". These are found on Drake's posthumous release, [[Family Tree (Nick Drake album)|Family Tree]].

Frank's song "I Want To Be Alone", also known as "Dialogue," appeared on the soundtrack for the film ''[[Daft Punk's Electroma]]''. This song plays when the gold robot is on fire, and slowly walking through the darkness of the Southwestern USA Salt Plains.

[[Soulsavers]] covered "Blues Run the Game" on their single "Revival" (7" vinyl, 30 April 2007).

[[Marianne Faithfull]] covered Frank's arrangement of a traditional song,  "Kimbie" on her 2008 album ''[[Easy Come, Easy Go (Marianne Faithfull album)|Easy Come, Easy Go]]'' and included the song in the repertoire of her 2009 tour.

Erland &amp; The Carnival also covered "My Name Is Carnival," apparently Frank's favourite song. Bert Jansch also covered this song as a gesture to Frank.

[[Sandy Denny]] covered "You Never Wanted Me" and "Milk and Honey" on the album "It's Sandy Denny" released by Saga Eros in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Saga 8153&lt;/ref&gt; Her song, "Next Time Around," contains coded references to Frank, her ex-boyfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ward |first=Philip |url=http://www.pemward.co.uk/page_1157987550937.html |title=The songs Work = Sandy Denny |publisher=www.pemward.co.uk |accessdate=June 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708203111/http://www.pemward.co.uk/page_1157987550937.html |archivedate=July 8, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Marcy's Song" is played by Patrick, [[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes']] character, in the 2011 film ''[[Martha Marcy May Marlene]]'' and "Marlene" plays in the closing credits.

Laura Barton's BBC Radio 4 programme "Blues Run the Game", first broadcast 20 November 2012, included interviews with Al Stewart, John Renbourn, Jim Abbott and John Kay as well as archive material of Jackson C. Frank talking and singing.

South Korean jazz singer [[Na Yoon-sun]] covered "My Name Is Carnival" on her album "Same Girl" (2010)

Frank's song "Milk and Honey" featured on the soundtrack of [[Vincent Gallo]]'s 2003 movie ''[[The Brown Bunny]]'' (and prominently in the movie's trailer). It was also sampled by Hidden Orchestra in their track "The Burning Circle" and by Hip Hop artist Nas in his track "Undying Love".

French singer and Kora player Stranded Horse (Yann Tambour) covered "My Name Is Carnival" on his album "Luxe" (2016)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.strandedhorse.com/discography/&lt;/ref&gt;

The popular American TV series "[[This Is Us (TV series)|This Is Us]]" features "Blues Run the Game" in episode three, which first aired on October 11, 2016.

Alt-country band [[Son Volt]] covered "Yellow Walls" in 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2379">'''Karen Ann Killilea''' (born  August 18, 1940) is the subject of two bestselling books by her mother [[Marie Killilea]], ''Karen'' and ''With Love from Karen''. These books were groundbreaking by asserting that children with cerebral palsy could lead productive lives.

Karen Killilea was born three months prematurely at a time when such babies rarely survived. As a result of her prematurity, she developed [[cerebral palsy]]. After she was diagnosed, Karen's parents decided to raise her at home, contrary to the advice of doctors to commit her to an [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]] and forget her. 

After visiting at least 23 doctors, they found one in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], who taught them to do physical therapy with Karen at home (then a radical concept).  They did so, spending two hours daily on her therapy for more than 10 years. Karen learned to walk with [[crutch]]es, write, swim, and use her arms and legs. 

She developed into a fairly happy teenager and adult who has been living independently and working for decades. Karen currently lives in [[New Rochelle, New York]], and works as a receptionist at a retreat house for priests run by Catholic monks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucp.org/ucp_generaldoc.cfm/1/10438/10438/10438-10438/1323|title=Karen Killilea and the Killilea Family|work=[[United Cerebral Palsy|UCP]] News Archive|accessdate=5 June 2010 |date=July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311115558/http://www.ucp.org/ucp_generaldoc.cfm/1/10438/10438/10438-10438/1323 |archivedate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Now in her seventies, she zealously guards her privacy and has always declined all requests for interviews.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

'''Kenny "Bricks" Wangler''' is a fictional character in the [[HBO]] drama ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]'', played by actor [[J. D. Williams]].

==Character overview==
''Prisoner #97W566. Convicted July 6, 1997 - murder in the first degree (16 years old tried as an adult). Sentence: 20 years, eligible for parole in six.''

He was sent to prison for murdering a student he was attempting to rob. His constant macho bravado, disrespect for older prisoners, and [[drug addiction]], among other things, make him particularly unsympathetic. He has an uneasy relationship with Homeboy gang leader, [[Simon Adebisi]] throughout the series, which oscillates between loyal camaraderie and public antagonism. Adebisi routinely harasses his constant sidekick, but freely shares the drugs.

==Season 1==

Wangler is sent to Oz for murder and is immediately seen as a target.  After he compliments [[Kareem Said]] by telling him he loved his book, Said tries to convert him to [[Islam]], but his [[heroin]] addiction keeps him off the straight and narrow path. Adebisi suggests to current Homeboy leader [[Jefferson Keane]] to let him in so that the Homeboys can more easily wipe out the Italians. He helps Adebisi seriously injure [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Joey D'Angelo]] in the kitchen and proves that he has a place in the gang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fearn-Banks|first1=Kathleen|title=The A to Z of African-American Television|date=August 4, 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=0810863480|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=U1Pe45NhU08C&amp;dq|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He robs elderly inmate [[Bob Rebadow]] for no apparent reason, for which Unit Manager [[Tim McManus]] chokes him. Throughout the season up to the riot, Wangler remains a key drug dealer and user who goes through severe [[drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] during the riot.

==Season 2==

In General Population, Wangler goes through severe heroin withdrawal and is [[assault]]ed by the guards. He is let back into Em City, and McManus tells him to get his [[GED]] instead of mopping floors. In the classroom, Wangler is disrespectful and verbally berates several inmates, especially [[Arnold "Poet" Jackson|Poet]], who has a talent for writing. He almost flips out when asked to read and then it is discovered that he is [[illiteracy|illiterate]]. McManus proposes that he learn how to read instead of going to the hole to [[Warden Glynn]] and his behavior improves as he becomes more literate. Adebisi, however, is not amused by Wangler getting more educated so he forces him to stop going to class and tears up a book that McManus gave him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andrew|first1=Jamie|title=Why HBO's Oz Is Still Influential 20 Years Later|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/oz/259825/why-hbos-oz-is-still-influential-20-years-later|website=Den of Geek|accessdate=5 July 2017|date=November 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wangler's behavior worsens as a result, and he is not allowed to walk the stage at graduation when McManus decides he is too much of a discipline problem. Wangler then gets back into the routine, even making peace with Poet and berates the Italian inmates after Adebisi takes out their most powerful members. 

As Adebisi becomes increasingly unstable, it becomes clear that he cannot lead the Homeboys. The Italians offer Wangler a partnership if he kills Jara, the man responsible for salvaging Adebisi. In the kitchen where Jara is working, Wangler kills Jara by stabbing him several times in the back and then hands [[Junior Pierce]], his main sidekick in the Homeboys, the murder knife to dispose it in a dishwasher. Adebisi goes to the psych ward as a result. Also, Poet comes back to Oz after killing a man while on parole and Wangler and Pierce are the only ones who accept him upon his return.

==Season 3==

[[Malcolm Coyle]] arrives and becomes friends with Wangler. Coyle is beaten by the entire gang in the gym as a loyalty test that is often performed in their housing project neighborhoods. Wangler proves that he is worthy of being in their gang to [[Antonio Nappa]]. Adebisi is released from the psych ward and the other Homeboys, especially Wangler and Pierce, plot to kill him. Nappa, however, tells them to stand back for the time being. Wangler is upset when Coyle is kicked out of the kitchen on Nappa's suspicions. Later [[Augustus Hill]] testifies against Coyle for murdering an Italian-American family, and Wangler seeks revenge. With the help of [[Kareem Said]], [[Antonio Nappa]], [[Carmen Guerra]], and [[Vernon Schillinger]], Hill is protected and Coyle is killed by the Italians so that the Homeboys learn a lesson about seeking revenge. 

Taking the new [[moniker]] of "Bricks", Wangler represents the Homeboys in the boxing tournament and falls quickly to heavier, fitter Muslim inmate [[Hamid Khan (Oz)|Hamid Khan]]. Wangler and Poet, angered at the loss to the Muslims, expose [[Kareem Said]] for having sexual thoughts about a white woman. As a result, Said is kicked out of the Muslims. Later, Wangler's mother visits, telling him that his wife is cheating on him with a man he despises, who is also assaulting his infant son. He has Pierce make a phone call to their outside connection who murders Wanglers wife and her boyfriend. Feigning [[grief]], he attends the funeral, Adebisi cuts a deal with [[Chucky Pancamo]], who is now the head of the Italians, and with the help of the Latinos, burned Poet and Pierce severely. Adebisi is Wangler's cellmate now, and he is at his old enemy's mercy. Adebisi has Wangler tied naked to his bed each night as a form of African war training and to reaffirm his dominance over Wangler. He then forces Wangler to accuse [[Tim McManus]] of [[sexual harassment]]. McManus transfers Wangler to Unit B and Wangler accepts Adebisi's plan to get rid of McManus and have a black man run Em City. Poet and Pierce get out of the hospital wanting to kill Adebisi, but Wangler tells them to cool off for the time being. On [[New Year's Eve]], amid the racial tension, Wangler, Poet, and Pierce lead the black inmates in a chant throughout Unit B to set [[Augustus Hill]] free from solitary.

==Season 4==

Adebisi gets Wangler, Poet, and Pierce back into Em City against McManus' wishes. While inside, Adebisi is trying to find someone to use a gun in a specific manner so that McManus can be exposed as incompetent and unfit to run Em City. A new inmate, an insecure white man named [[Guillaume Tarrant]], arrives in Oz and is an immediate target for Wangler, Poet, and Pierce; they steal his shoes and bully him regularly. Seeing this, Adebisi places the gun in his cell, and the next day Tarrant kills Wangler and Pierce, in addition to another black inmate and Correctional Officer [[Joseph Howard (Oz)|Joseph Howard]] before committing [[suicide]]. Wangler's death, however, falls perfectly into Adebisi's plans of revenge on them for killing Jara, and to get a black Unit Manager hired, as three black prisoners and a black officer died at the hands of a white amidst a shootout.

{{Main|List of dance personalities}}

An annotated '''list of popular/famous dancers'''.

{{compact ToC|num=yes}}

== A ==

*[[Fifi Abdou]] (born {{Birth date|1953|04|26|df=yes}}), Egyptian [[belly dancer]] and actress. She rose to fame in the 1970s, and was one of the most famous and successful Egyptian dance stars throughout the 1980s and 1990s until her retirement in the 2000s. She has been the subject of several controversies during her long career.
*[[Paula Abdul]] (born {{Birth date|1962|06|16|df=yes}}), American recording artist, dancer, choreographer, and actress. Before achieving widespread fame as a recording artist in the early 1990s, Abdul, a former high school [[cheerleader]], was a heavily sought-after choreographer who has designed dance routines for several well-known performers, including singer [[Janet Jackson]]. In her music videos, Abdul has exhibited skills in a variety of dance styles, including [[hip-hop dance|hip-hop]], [[tap dance|tap]], and [[Freestyle dance|freestyle]]. Abdul's major television breakthrough came in 2002, when she became a judge on the popular reality television talent competition ''[[American Idol]]'', a role in which she remained for seven years. In 2011 Abdul was one of the judges on the American version of ''[[The X Factor (U.S.)|The X Factor]]'', another reality television singing competition.
*[[Fred Astaire]] ({{Birth date|1899|05|10|df=yes}} – {{Death date|1987|06|22|df=yes}}), American film and Broadway stage dancer, choreographer, singer, musician and actor. He was an innovator in dance. He made 31 musical films and was honored with the fifth Greatest Male Star of All Time by the [[American Film Institute]].

==B==
*[[George Balanchine]] ({{Birth date|1904|01|22|df=yes}} – {{Death date|1983|04|30|df=yes}}), Georgian ballet choreographer. He is one of the 20th century's foremost choreographers, and one of the founders of American ballet. His work formed a bridge between classical and modern ballet. Apollo is Balanchine's oldest surviving ballet and his first great public ballet which Balanchine was to become renowned for. It premiered on June 12, 1928 by Les Ballets Russes de Serge Diaghilev at the Théâtre Sarah Bernhart in Paris. Balanchine looked upon Apollo as the turning point of his life, "in its sustained oneness of tone and feeling". The story centers around Apollo, the god of the sun, who is visited by three muses: Terpsichore, muse of dance; Polyhymnia, muse of hymns; and Calliope, muse of poetry. Balanchine created ballet sequences for Ravel's opera ''L'enfant et les sortilèges'' to Colette's libretto with what Ravel described as "Russian dancers", presumably from the Ballets Russes for the 1925 Monte Carlo premiere, although this is not listed as a Ballets Russes production.
*[[Sara Baras]] (born 1971), female [[Flamenco]] Dancer, born in the port of Cadiz. She is internationally famous and regularly tours the world. She has won a number of awards including the Madroño Flamenco of Montellano (Seville) in 1993,and in 1999 and 2001, she received a prize for the Best Female Spanish Dance Performer.
*[[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] (born {{Birth date|1948|01|28|df=yes}}), Soviet-born Russian American dancer, choreographer, and actor, often cited alongside [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] and [[Rudolf Nureyev]] as one of the greatest ballet dancers of the 20th century. After a promising start in the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad, he defected to Canada in 1974 and went on to become a principal dancer and artistic director with the American Ballet Theatre and the New York City Ballet in New York City. He has spearheaded many of his own artistic projects and has been associated in particular with promoting modern dance, premiering dozens of new works, including many of his own. His success as a dramatic actor on stage, cinema and television has helped him become probably the most widely recognized contemporary dancer.
*[[Bez (dancer)|Bez]] (born {{Birth date|1964|04|18|df=yes}}), renowned as the dancer for the [[Happy Mondays]].
*[[Vytautas Beliajus]] ({{Birth date|1908|02|26|df=yes}} – September 1994), considered the father of [[international folk dancing]] in the United States. He specialized in [[Music of Lithuania|Lithuanian dance]], but performed and taught many other types of dance as well. He published multiple books on the subjects of dance and ethnicity, and also started the folklore magazine Viltis. Beliajus was born in Lithuania and emigrated to the U.S. when he was 14 years old. He had two younger brothers, Leonas and Julius, and a sister, Gyte Jekentes.
*[[Carlo Blasis]] ({{Birth date|1797|11|04|df=yes}} – {{Death date|1878|01|15|df=yes}}), Italian dancer, choreographer and dance theoretician. He is well known for his very rigorous dance classes, sometimes lasting four hours long. He was the first who published an analysis on the ballet techniques in 1820, in a work named ''Traité élémentaire, théorique, et pratique de l'art de la danse'' (''Elementary Treaty on the Art of the Dance, theory and practice''). He is most known for the pose "Attitude" derived from the famous statue Mercury by Giovanni da Bologna. He taught [[Enrico Cecchetti]], who expanded his technique.
*[[Chrystelle Trump Bond]], American dancer, choreographer, and dance historian
*[[James Brown]] or James Joseph Brown, Jr. ({{Birth date|1933|05|03|df=yes}} – {{Death date|2006|12|25|df=yes}}), commonly referred to as "The Godfather of Soul", "Mr. Dynamite", the "King of Funk", "Soul Brother #1" and "The Hardest Working Man in Show Business", was an American entertainer (singer and dancer). He is recognized as one of the most influential figures in 20th-century popular music and was renowned for his vocals and feverish dancing. As a prolific singer, songwriter and bandleader, Brown was a pivotal force in the music industry. He left his mark on numerous artists. Brown's music also left its mark on the rhythms of African popular music, such as afrobeat, jùjú and mbalax, and provided a template for go-go music. Brown began his professional music career in 1953 and rose to fame during the late 1950s and early 1960s on the strength of his thrilling live performances and string of smash hits. During the early 1980s, Brown's music helped to shape the rhythms of early hip-hop music, with numerous groups looping or sampling his funk grooves and turning them into what became hip hop classics and the foundations of the music and dance genre. Brown danced vigorously as he sang, working popular dance steps such as the [[Mashed Potato]] into his routine along with dramatic leaps, splits and slides. In addition, his horn players and backup singers ([[The Famous Flames]]) typically performed choreographed dance routines, and later incarnations of the [[Revue]] included backup dancers.

The first part covers posture, reverences, steps, and the ballroom minuet, while the second part is concerned entirely with the use of the arms. His second book, ''Abbregé de la Nouvelle Methode'' (c1725, Paris), described a modified version of Beauchamp-Feuillet notation and included several choreographies by Pécour in the new notation.

Many companies currently include a collection of her signature solos in their repertoires, including the programme, "The Art of the Solo", a showcase of famous solos of modern dance pioneers. Several early St. Denis solos (including "Incense" and "The Legend of the Peacock") were presented on September 29, 2006, at the Baltimore Museum of Art.

He was superintendent/principal/teacher/coach for Cheyenne Mountain Schools, Colorado Springs, Colorado from 1916–1951, and taught [[folk dancing]] .Shaw traveled the country, and compiled instructions for traditional square dances from different callers all over the country. He documented them, and tried them out on the students he taught. He formed the Cheyenne Mountain Dancers, a high-school exhibition team, which toured the United States in the 1930s and 1940s, appearing in more than 50 major cities .As the popularity of square dancing grew, square dance callers began extracting individual calls from these dances, and attempts at standardised lists were developed. These lists were later adopted by callers, and organizations such as Callerlab and later the American Callers Association formed to manage and promote a universal list and the type of dance leadership that Shaw envisioned.

*"Shorty" [[George Snowden]] was an African American dancer in Harlem during the 1920s and 1930s. He is popularly credited with coining the name "[[Lindy Hop]]" for a popular partner swing dance of the day. He is also often credited with inventing the dance, though this is unsubstantiated and unlikely. Snowden was a popular dancer at the [[Savoy Ballroom]] in Harlem, New York, in the United States and appears in the film After Seben (1929), in which he performs the breakaway, a variation on the Charleston, which later developed into the Lindy Hop.

I Did It Again (song)|Oops!...I Did It Again]]", she is also internationally renowned for her unique outfits and her entertaining and freestyle dancing. Her debut single, "...Baby One More Time", features Spears dancing in a formal yet somewhat revealing catholic school girl uniform, which brought both success and extreme controversy to her iconic career. Britney Spears is often compared to fellow singers and dancers [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Christina Aguilera]].
*[[John W. Bubbles|John William Sublett]] (February 19, 1902 – May 18, 1986), known by his stage name [[John W. Bubbles]], was an American vaudeville performer, singer and entertainer .Sublett is known as the father of "rhythm tap", a form of tap dance. As opposed to the tap dancing of Bill Robinson (Bojangles) who emphasized clean phrases and toe taps, Sublett brought in percussive heel stomps and played with the traditional eight-bar phrase, slowing it down to allow for more rhythmic freedom. He thus merged the art of tap dancing with the new improvisitory style of jazz, reinventing the tap artform.
*[[Sylvia Sykes]], [[swing dance]] instructor, judge and choreographer. In particular she is considered by most to be the leading authority on the dance Balboa.

*[[Antony Tudor]] (4 April 1908 – 19 April 1987), born William Cook, highly influential 20th-century English ballet choreographer, teacher and dancer. Antony Tudor is generally accepted to be one of the great originals of modern dance forms. Along with [[George Balanchine]], he is seen as a principal transformer of ballet into a [[modern art]], but of a genius that uses, rather than proceeds from, ballet forms. His work is usually considered as modern "psychological" expression, but—like their creator–of austerity, elegance and nobility.

== U ==
*[[Uday Shankar]] (December 8, 1900 – September 26, 1977) (Bengali: উদয় শংকর), the pioneer of modern dance in India, and a world renowned Indian dancer and choreographer, was most known for adapting Western theatrical techniques to traditional Indian classical dance, imbued with elements of Indian classical, folk, and tribal dance, thus laying the roots of modern Indian dance, which he later popularized in India, Europe, and the United States in 1920s and 1930s.

==V==
*[[Agrippina Yakovlevna Vaganova]] (July 6, 1879 – November 5, 1951), outstanding Russian ballet teacher who developed the [[Vaganova method]] - the technique which derived from the teaching methods of the old Imperial Ballet School (today the Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet) under the Premier Maître de Ballet Marius Petipa throughout the mid-to-late 19th century, though mostly throughout the 1880s and 1890s. It was Vaganova who perfected and cultivated this form of teaching the art of classical ballet into a workable syllabus.

==W==
*[[John Weaver (dancer)|John Weaver]] (July 21, 1673 – September 24, 1760), dancer and choreographer and is commonly known as the father of English [[pantomime]]. Weaver was born in Shrewsbury. His father, a dance teacher, suggested he go to London and become a ballet master. Weaver soon became a specialist in comic roles and created the first pantomime ballet, the burlesque Tavern Bilkers (1702). His more serious work'', The Loves of Mars and Venus'' dealt with themes from classical literature and required a significant amount of gestures due to the story not being expressed in any spoken form. Because Weaver attempted to use plot and emotion in replacement of more sophisticated technical and speech methods, he is considered a major influence on subsequent choreographers, including [[Jean-Georges Noverre]] and [[Gasparo Angiolini]].
*[[Charles Edward Weidman]], Jr. (1901 in Lincoln, Nebraska – 1975), modern dancer, choreographer and teacher. He studied and performed with Denishawn before leaving to form the [[Humphrey-Weidman]] school and company with [[Doris Humphrey]] and Pauline Lawrence. Like his partner Humphrey, Weidman worked from principles of fall and recovery and also experimented with a form of linking unrelated movements that he called "kinetic pantomime." During the 1930s, Weidman taught at the Bennington School of the Dance in Vermont and presented choreography including his popular ''Candide'' (1937) through the Federal Dance Theatre of the WPA.
*[[Mary Wigman]] (1886 – 1973), German dancer, choreographer, and instructor of dance. Credited for innovation of expressionist dance, and pioneer of [[modern dance]] in Germany. Mary Wigman's choreographies often employed non-Western instrumentation: fifes, bells, gongs, and drums from India, Thailand, Africa, and China. However, the primary musical accompaniment for her most well known dances was percussion, which contrasted greatly with her use of silence. Mary would often employ masks in her pieces, influenced again by non-western/tribal motifs, as well as ecstatic spinning.

'''Mian Mohammad Sharif''' ([[Urdu]]: محمد شریف )  (1893 &amp;ndash; 1965) [[Tamgha-e-Imtiaz|TI]], best known as '''Professor M. M. Sharif''', was an influential [[philosopher]], clergyman, and college professor. He is noted for his notable work in [[Analytical philosophy|analytical]] philosophy and pioneered the idea of ''[[Muslim philosophy]]''. He  wrote on this subject and his work was published in international philosophical journals.&lt;ref name=BostonU&gt;[https://open.bu.edu/bitstream/handle/2144/14101/Gul_bu_0017N_10099.pdf?sequence=1 Muslim thought: its origin and achievements - by M. M. Sharif] Boston University website, Published in 2013, Retrieved 20 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

He remained politically active with the [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)|Muslim League]] and advocated for the [[Idea of Pakistan|"idea"]] of establishing a separate state in [[British Indian Empire|British India]], meaning a separate new state of [[Pakistan]] for the Muslims. He remained a vital member of the [[Council of Islamic Ideology|Islamic Ideology Council]] and taught at [[Islamia College (Lahore)|Islamia College]], Lahore  for the rest of his life.

==Early life and career==
Mian Mohammad Sharif was born in the suburban area of Lahore, situated in [[Shalimar Gardens, Lahore|Shalimar Garden]] of [[Lahore]], [[Punjab Province (British India)|British Punjab]], [[British Indian Empire]], in 1893.&lt;ref name="Sharif Presentation Volume Committee (Pakistan Philosophical Congress)"&gt;{{cite book |last=Qadir | first =C.A. |authorlink = |title =The World of Philosophy: Studies Prepared in Honour of Professor M.

Sharif was educated at the [[Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College]], [[Aligarh]] and the famous [[Aligarh Muslim University]] (AMU) where he studied Philosophy. He received a BA degree in Philosophy from the Aligarh Muslim University before moving to the [[United Kingdom]] for higher education.&lt;ref name="Council for Research on Values and Philosophy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Mathew|title=Biographical annotations: M.

E. Moore]].&lt;ref name="Council for Research in Values and Philosophy (Book)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahmad|first=ed. by Naeem|title=Philosophy in Pakistan|year=1998|publisher=Council for Research in Values and Philosophy (Book)|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1565181085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His interest in [[Realism (philosophy)|realism]] and [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosophy under professor ''G. E. Moore'' further widened and M. M. Sharif extensively wrote on [[Monadism]] which was supervised by [[G. E. Moore|GE Moore]] as his [[Doctoral studies|PhD thesis]] which was submitted to the university. After receiving the PhD degree, his interest further shifted to [[Western Philosophy]] and he once noted "Philosophy must find a place for the sciences in the systematic whole of knowledge."&lt;ref name="De Nobili College, Poona, India"&gt;{{cite web |last=De Smet, S.J. |first=Richard V. |title=Philosophical activitiy in Pakistan: 1947–1961 |url=http://www.crvp.org/book/Series02/IIA-3/appendix.htm |publisher=De Nobili College, Poona, India |accessdate=20 November 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509105450/http://www.crvp.org/book/Series02/IIA-3/appendix.htm |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon returning to [[British Indian Empire|British India]], he served as chairman of ''philosophy department'' of the [[Aligarh Muslim University]] and briefly participated in [[Pakistan Movement]].&lt;ref name="Council for Research on Values and Philosophy"/&gt; In 1945, he was appointed as the [[President|General– President]] of the ''Indian Philosophical Congress'' until  he moved to [[Lahore]] to accept the professorship of philosophy at the [[Punjab University, Lahore|Punjab University]] after the 1947 [[Partition of India|partition]] of [[British Indian Empire|British India]]. In 1950, he founded and served as the first president of ''Pakistan Philosophical Congress'', and remained associated with the society for the rest of his life. This organisation played a role in reviving interest in the study of modern philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/1068976 Philosophy in mumbo-jumbo land] Dawn (newspaper), Published 4 May 2006, Retrieved 21 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he also served as principal of [[Islamia College (Lahore)|Islamia College]], Lahore and Director of the Institute of Islamic Culture based in Lahore.&lt;ref name="Council for Research on Values and Philosophy"/&gt; In 1956, he represented Pakistan in the [[UNESCO]] conference held in the [[United States]].

During [[King William's War]], he was first associated with the French in the siege of Fort St. John led by [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] in 1696-1697 during the [[Avalon Peninsula Campaign]]. Even after the war was officially ended, Abenaki raids on the English colonists continued.  On March 4, 1698 Maliseet Abenaki Chief [[Escumbuit]] led a group of 30 Indians in a raid on [[Andover, Massachusetts]], the last and most severe Indian raid on this town.

During [[Queen Anne's War]], he participated in the [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1703)|Northeast Coast Campaign]].  In early 1705 he was again in Newfoundland, where he participated in the [[Siege of St. John's]] and other French and Indian raids against English holdings.&lt;ref name=DCBBio/&gt;  Later that year he was invited to France as part of France's bid for an alliance with his tribe.

His reputation among the French and the English of New England was notorious—the latter called him a "bloody devil", and accused him of killing many women and children.&lt;ref name=DCBBio&gt;{{cite DCB |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/nescambiouit_2E.html |title=Nescambiouit |last=Charland |first=Thomas |volume=2 |accessdate=2011-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A member of the [[Golescu family]] of [[boyars]], Nicolae was born in [[Câmpulung]] as the son of [[Dinicu Golescu]]; he was educated together with his other three brothers in [[Switzerland]]. Nicolae and his brother [[Ștefan Golescu|Ștefan]] returned in 1830 to join the [[Wallachian Army]], where Nicolae became a major in 1834.

In the same year he joined the ''Philarmonic Society'', a group similar to the [[Freemasonry]]. In 1840 he was a [[prosecutor]] in the trial of the participants in the [[Mitică Filipescu]] plot, and later on he was Wallachia's Minister of Internal Affairs.

In 1842, Wallachia was under the protectorate of [[Imperial Russia]], and Nicolae Golescu tried to obtain the mandate of [[List of Wallachian rulers|Prince of Wallachia]] from [[Nicholas I of Russia|Emperor Nicholas]], but was denied and remained a Minister of Internal Affairs until 1847. In the meantime, he began taking part in gatherings of various revolutionary societies.

He joined the [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] [[Liberalism in Romania|liberals]], being part of the 1848 revolutionary committee, together with [[Ion Ghica]], [[Nicolae Bălcescu]], [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]] and others (including his brother Ștefan and his cousin [[Alexandru G. Golescu]]).

===Prominence===
Afterwards, on 11 June 1848, when the [[1848 Wallachian revolution|Wallachian revolution]] started in [[Bucharest]], Nicolae Golescu was a Minister of Internal Affairs for the Provisional Government. The following week, he and [[Ana Ipătescu]] took initiative in rallying civilians in defense of the revolutionary power, as it was threatened by [[Conservatism|conservative]] plot (June 19).

However, on 25 July, the government resigned on pressure from the [[Ottoman Empire]], and after the Ottoman intervention of September, Nicolae Golescu went into exile, to return in the 1850s and support [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]]'s bid for the throne of a united [[Danubian Principalities]] (Wallachia and [[Moldavia]]).

In 1866, after joining the alliance of Liberals and Conservatives against Cuza's unsanctioned personal regime, he was for a short time one of the [[regent]]s. He was then [[List of Romanian Foreign Ministers|Foreign Minister]] and a member of [[Ion C. Brătianu]]'s [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|Liberal Party]], formed during the rule of [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]].

'''Nole Floyd "Nokie" Edwards''' (May 9, 1935&amp;nbsp;– March 12, 2018) was an [[United States|American]] [[musician]] and member of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. He was primarily a [[guitarist]], best known for his work with [[The Ventures]],&lt;ref name="Legends of rock guitar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prown|first1=Pete |author-link1=Pete Prown |last2=Newquist |first2=Harvey P. |author-link2=HP Newquist |title=Legends of Rock Guitar|editor-first=Jon F. |editor-last=Eiche|publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation]] |location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|year=1997|page=22|isbn=0-7935-4042-9 |url={{Google books|60Jde3l7WNwC|page=22|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was known in Japan as the [[honorific nicknames in popular music|'King of Guitars']]. Edwards was also an [[actor]], who appeared briefly on ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'', an [[United States|American]] [[Western (genre)|Western]] [[drama]] [[Television show#Seasons/series|television series]].

==Early life==
Edwards was born in [[Lahoma, Oklahoma]], the son of Elbert and Nannie,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbhef.org/foundation-artists/legacy-artists/nokie-edwards/|title=Nokie Edwards - The Buddy Holly Educational Foundation|website=Tbhef.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Cherokee]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Edwards came from a family of accomplished musicians, so that by age five he began playing a variety of [[string instrument]]s, including the [[steel guitar]], [[banjo]], [[mandolin]], [[violin]], and [[Double bass|bass]]. His family relocated from Oklahoma to [[Puyallup, Washington]].

During Edwards' late teen years he joined the [[United States Army Reserve]]. After traveling to [[Texas]] and [[California]] for training, he returned home and began playing regularly for pay in numerous [[country music|country]] [[musical ensemble|bands]] in the area.

==Music career==
In January 1958, country songwriter and guitarist [[Buck Owens]] relocated from California to [[Tacoma, Washington]], as owner of radio station KAYE. Prior to the formation of The Buckaroos with Don Rich, Edwards played guitar with Owens in the new band he formed in the area, and also played in the house band of television station KTNT, located in the same building as KAYE. In 1960 Edwards recorded a single, "Night Run" b/w "Scratch", on Blue Horizon Records with a band called The Marksmen.

===The Ventures===
[[The Ventures]] are an [[instrumental]] musical quartet founded in Tacoma, Washington, in 1958. Original members included [[Don Wilson (musician)|Don Wilson]] on rhythm guitar, [[Bob Bogle]] on lead guitar (who later became the bass player), and drummer [[George T. Babbitt Jr.|George Babbitt]], who went on to become a 4-star general in the U.S. Air Force. When Babbitt left, Howie Johnson took his place, and was later replaced by [[Mel Taylor]]. Edwards met Wilson and Bogle when they performed on KTNT. Edwards originally played bass for The Ventures, but he took over the [[lead guitar]] position from Bogle.&lt;ref name="Legends of rock guitar"/&gt; The Ventures released a series of best-selling [[album]]s through 1968, at which time Edwards left; he would occasionally reunite with the band, however.

Edwards continued to tour Japan annually with [[The Ventures]], primarily in winter, until 2012.

===Other work===
In 1969 Edwards began a [[solo (music)|solo]] career and released several albums through 1974. His solo attempt was unsuccessful in America, and he returned to the Ventures as lead guitarist in 1972. Edwards performed with the band until 1984, when he left again to pursue a music career in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]]. He played lead guitar for [[Lefty Frizzell]], on what would become Frizzell's final recording sessions. In the late 1980s Edwards re-joined The Ventures once more for another short stint of recording and touring before returning to Nashville. Throughout the 1990s he was involved with numerous country-influenced recording projects.

Edwards performed occasionally in the United States as both a soloist and member of various bands, including AdVenture, [[Art Greenhaw]], and Texas Western swing outfit The [[Light Crust Doughboys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=943Zoc0WYvU&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=The Records of Nokie Edwards, Art Greenhaw, &amp; The Light Crust Doughboys|date=15 March 2018|accessdate=2 October 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fruitful and critically acclaimed collaboration of Edwards and artist-producer Greenhaw resulted in a number of albums in several music genres including Edwards' two nominations for "[[Grammy Award for Best Southern, Country or Bluegrass Gospel Album]] of the Year", album titles ''20th Century Gospel'' (2005) and ''Southern Meets Soul'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/nokie-edwards |title=Nokie Edwards' Grammy Nominations |website=[[The Recording Academy]] |access-date=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, [[Deke Dickerson]] announced on his Facebook page that he was currently working on a new studio album with Nokie Edwards. Dickerson and his band backed Edwards for several shows, including Deke's yearly Guitar Geek Festival held in Anaheim, California.

===Rock and Roll Hall of Fame===
In 2008, Edwards was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], along with The Ventures. The award was presented by [[John Fogerty]]. The band performed their biggest hits, "[[Walk, Don't Run (instrumental)|Walk Don't Run]]" and "Hawaii Five-0", augmented on the latter by Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame musical director [[Paul Shaffer]] and his band.

==Acting career==
After accepting an offer to pursue an acting career, Edwards landed a role on ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'', an American [[Western (genre)|Western]] drama television series. Edwards played the mysterious friend of [[Wild Bill Hickok]] and a local citizen, who serves as a bridge between the villains and heroes of the show. During production, Edwards temporarily relocated to Santa Clarita, California and lived on the set's location with his wife Judy.

==Equipment==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=October 2018}}
===Mosrite Guitars===
Edwards had a long association with [[Mosrite]].  In 1963, Edwards introduced the other members of the Ventures to Semie Moseley, which led to a five-year association between Mosrite and the band.  During this time, Edwards and the band used and popularized the Ventures Model Mosrite guitars.  Several notable features of the Ventures Model include hot single-pole pickups, a light-touch tremolo, zero fret, a sloped-back tilt headstock, and a German carve body.

In the mid 1980s, Edwards rekindled his relationship with Moseley, and Moseley designed the Mosrite Nokie Model, an update of the Ventures Model.  A custom Anniversary version of the Nokie Model came with a metallic blue finish and white accents.

===Fender Signature Model Telecaster===
Edwards played [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[Fender Telecaster|Telecasters]] and [[Fender Jazzmaster|Jazzmasters]] during the 1950s and early 1960s, before switching to Mosrite guitars. For solo projects and with the Ventures, he also toured and recorded with Telecasters during the 1980s and 1990s.

In the mid 1990s, Edwards designed the ''Nokie Edwards Custom Signature'' model Telecaster for Fender Guitars, which features gold hardware,
an ebony fingerboard, sloped-back tilt headstock, zero fret, sealed tuners and Seymour Duncan humbucker pickups with split coils.

===HitchHiker guitars===
Edwards designed and recently sold his own custom guitar, the ''HitchHiker'', a hybrid of the best elements of the [[Fender Telecaster]] and [[Mosrite]] guitars. The HitchHiker features a sloped-back tilt headstock, a neck-through-body with swamp ash and quilted maple, zero fret, gold control plates, [[Seymour Duncan]] [[humbucker]]s with split coils, and an ebony fingerboard. Its bridge works on a slide scale invented by Edwards. The HitchHiker can simulate an acoustic guitar and provides 15 different sound selections. The body design is essentially the original Mosrite body, which Edwards preferred. The hybrid guitars are being crafted in New River, Arizona.

===Dual Blade Humbucker Pickup===
Edwards designed the ''Nokie Edwards Dual Blade Humbucker Pickup''. Manufactured and sold by Seymour Duncan, it produces tones similar to Nokie's Telecaster and HitchHiker guitar models.

==Death==
Edwards died in Yuma, Arizona following complications from hip surgery, at the age of 82.&lt;ref name="latobit"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-nokie-edwards-ventures-obituary-20180312-story.html |title=Nokie Edwards, the Ventures' influential lead guitarist, dies at 82 |first=Randy |last=Lewis |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pierre-Victor''' or '''Pierre Victor Galtier''' ({{birth date|1846|10|15|df=yes}}&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;{{death date|1908|04|24|df=yes}}) was a [[veterinarian]] and professor at the {{ill|National Veterinary School of Lyon|fr|École nationale vétérinaire de Lyon}}, specialising in [[pathology]] of infectious diseases, health surveillance and commercial and medical legislation. He developed a [[rabies vaccine]] which had some experimental success in laboratory animals.

== Early life and studies ==
Galtier was born on 15 October 1846 in [[Langogne]], [[Lozère]] to a farmer's family.{{sfn|Théodoridès|1986|p=189}} In 1853, he was entrusted to the nuns who ran the local school. He escaped from this school twice, only to be placed with his grandmother who lived in Langogne. There, he attended secondary school, leaving after the tenth grade.

He read [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] studies at [[La Chapelle-Saint-Mesmin]] in the "Petit Séminaire", the famous ecclesiastical secondary school of Bishop [[Felix Dupanloup]], an outpost of the [[Seminar d'Orléans]]. He received his bachelor's degree with honours.

He studied for his master's degree and his veterinary license at [[Marvejols college]]. Around this time [[Lozère]] created a scholarship to help poor students to study to become veterinarians, which Galtier received and used to study at the {{illm|National Veterinary School of Lyon|fr|École nationale vétérinaire de Lyon}}. He came top of the class for four consecutive years, and graduated in 1873 as a [[valedictorian]], receiving the "''{{lang|fr|Grand prix Bourgelat}}''".

== Career ==
Galtier began his professional career as an associate of Monsieur Delorme, a veterinarian in [[Arles]], whose daughter he married. He began teaching veterinary pathology and eventually became the Chair of Infectious Diseases. Aged 33, he began his work on rabies.

In 1876, he was appointed the Chair of Pathology and Internal Medicine in the veterinary science department at Lyon. In 1877, his department began to carry out studies on microbial pathology and [[microbiology]]. This led to the school supporting the idea of [[contagious diseases]] such as [[tuberculosis]], the [[common cold]], and [[rabies]], as opposed to the [[National Veterinary School of Alfort]] which supported the idea of [[spontaneous generation]].

In 1878 he was appointed professor of pathology of infectious diseases, animal health, trade and medical law. In the same year, Mr. Bouley, Inspector General of veterinary schools, created a new department that would separate the teaching of general pathology from that of communicable diseases. Pierre Victor Galtier was appointed to the department chair and held the position for 30 years.

In 1879, he made important discoveries about two deadly diseases: [[common cold]] and [[rabies]]. In 1883, he obtained a law degree.

For his work on rabies, Galtier was considered for the 1908 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]. However, he died in [[La Mulatière]] on 24 April 1908, thereby preventing his nomination.{{sfn|Théodoridès|1986|loc=VI: Les recherches de Galtier (1879–1904)}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=L'Histoire des Vaccinations |language=fr |trans-title=Vaccination, a History |first=Hervé |last=Bazin |chapter=Un survol de quelques protagonistes de cette histoire |date=2008 |place=Montrouge |publisher=John Libbey |pp=400–401 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NSHXLkgFBBQC&amp;pg=PA400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work on rabies ==
Pierre Galtier was notable for his work on [[rabies]]; he was the first to develop a vaccine for rabies. He also made important advances in the study of the [[common cold]] and on the infectiousness of viruses.

Galtier assumed that, because of the [[incubation period]] of rabies, the development of a vaccine could be used as curative for a disease like this.&lt;ref name="Life_Galtier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://membres.lycos.fr/zeb/indexrage.html|title=Life Galtier|language=fr|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530121255/http://membres.lycos.fr/zeb/indexrage.html|archivedate=30 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1879 ===
His first publication on rabies was a thesis entitled "Studies on rabies" published in two veterinary journals&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Galtier, studies on rabies Rec. Med. Vet, 1879, 6, {2} {E} series, No. 17, pp 857–867.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Galtier, Studies on rabies, Ann. Med. Vet., 1879 28, p. 627-639.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Théodoridès|1986|p=190}} and whose findings are published in the Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences.

On April 25, 1879, the Academy of Sciences published his notes on rabies.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Galtier, studies on rabies (Presented by Mr. Bouley), Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences 1879, Volume 89, August 25, 1879, p. 444-446.&lt;/ref&gt;

The article made clear his conclusions about rabies:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# The dog rabies is transmitted to the rabbit, which thus becomes a convenient and safe reagent to determine the status of non-virulence or virulence of various liquids from rabid animals (…)
# Rabies is transmitted to animals (rabbits) of his kind (…)
# Symptoms that predominate in the rabid rabbits are paralysis and convulsions.
# The rabbit can live from several hours to one, two and even four days after the disease has clearly declared.
# (…) the incubation period{{efn|That is to say, the incubation period for rabies.}} is shorter in him than in other species. (Based on an experience table published in the note, Galtier accurately and correctly calculates an average incubation time for the rabbit 18 days).
# Salicylic acid, administered by hypodermic injection, the daily dose of 0.0068 gr for fourteen consecutive days from the fiftieth hour after [[inoculation]], did not prevent the development of rabies the rabbit.
# The saliva of rabid dog, collected on the living animal and stored in the water is still virulent five, fourteen twenty-four hours.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Galtier also had a brilliant idea: he began experiments to find an agent capable of neutralizing rabies virus. He thought that the discovery of an effective preventive was almost equivalent to the discovery of a cure, especially if it was effective when administered within a day or two of an infected bite.&lt;ref name = "Life_Galtier"/&gt; It is this 'genius idea which is the basis of preventive treatment for rabies by vaccination'.

=== 1880 ===
In 1880, Galtier published a "Treaty of contagious diseases" which contains a chapter on rabies.{{efn|This book had three editions: in 1880, 1891, 1897.}}

In this book, he wrote this sentence summarizing his first observations on immunity to rabies: "Rabies virus injected directly into the blood stream is ineffective, at least this is what I found in several experiences where I had injected into the jugular vein of the sheep a large amount of rabid drool".{{sfn|Théodoridès|1986|p=191}} His experiments were published in several articles the following year.

Also in 1880, [[Louis Pasteur]] became interested in rabies and took note of Galtier's work, regarding him with a certain disdain, stating that these experiments "do not make it possible to reconicle, let alone identify the disease […] as rabies". Pasteur often denigrated his predecessors before taking over their work, and the credit for it; he also did this with [[Jean Joseph Henri Toussaint|Henri Toussaint]] and [[Antoine Béchamp]].

=== 1881 ===
In August 1881, Galtier sent a note to the Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Galtier, rabies injections into the circulation do not cause the outbreak of rabies and appear to confer immunity. Rabies can be transmitted by ingestion of the rabies material (Presented by Mr. Bouley), Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences, 1881, Volume 93, August 1, 1881, pp 284–285.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted his experiences of the intravenous inoculation of the rabies virus in the bloodstream.

He wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The findings that emerge from these facts are the following:
# Injections of rabies virus into the veins of the sheep do not cause rabies and seem to confer immunity.
# Rabies can be transmitted by injection of the rabies material.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This method provided immunity against rabies in sheep. In the Bulletin of the Academy of Medicine, he wrote: "I injected the rabies saliva into the jugular vein of sheep seven times, and never saw rabies, one of my test subjects was successively inoculated with saliva from a rabid dog, four months after this inoculation, the animal is alive and well; he seems to have acquired immunity. I inoculated him for another fortnight by putting eight cubic centimeters of rabid saliva in the peritoneum; it always went very well; then I would administer him another inoculation."&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Galtier, Transmission of rabies virus, Bull Acad. Med, 1881 {2} {e} series, Volume 10, pp 90–94 (quote taken from {{cite book|last1=Cadeddu|first1=Antonio|title=Les vérités de la science : pratique, récit, histoire ; le cas Pasteur|date=2005|publisher=Olschki|location=Firenze|isbn=9788822254641|page=155|language=fr}})&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the science historian Jean Théodoridès, this is the first time in the history of medicine that the idea of immunization against rabies was supported by convincing experimental results.{{sfn|Théodoridès|1986|p=214}}

=== 1882 ===
Galtier remarked "intravenous inoculation is ineffective. [But] immunity follows this inoculation in sheep", and he noted the absence of virus in the nerve centers.

This last point drew the attention of [[Louis Pasteur]] who saw a lack of sensitivity due to the subcutaneous inoculation technique. With his student [[Pierre Paul Émile Roux|Émile Roux]], Pasteur developed an intracranial inoculation, by [[trepanning]] the skull of a dog. This isolated the virus in the nerve centers, and supported the idea that rabies is [[neurotropic virus|neurotropic]], meaning that the virus preferentially develops in nerve cells, and spreads through nerve pathways from the peripheral inoculation point to the brain.

=== 1883 ===
In 1883, [[Pierre Paul Émile Roux|Émile Roux]] published his medical doctorate thesis on "New acquisitions on rabies." According to Jean Théodoridès,{{sfn|Théodoridès|1986|pp=212-213}} the most striking thing about Roux's thesis is the frequent mention of the work of Galtier, whereas Pasteur referred to Galtier only incidentally.{{sfn|Théodoridès|1986|p=213}}

=== 1886 ===
In 1886, Galtier published an important book on rabies, ''Rabies considered in animals and humans from the point of view of its character and its prophylaxis'' ({{lang-fr|La rage envisagée chez les animaux et chez l'homme au point de vue de ses caractères et de sa prophylaxie}}). It discussed:{{sfn|Théodoridès|1986|p=214}}

*Symptoms
*Curability
*Cause, proving the lack of "spontaneous" rabies, and concluding that "contagion is the only cause that can cause rabies in animals of any kind."
*Transmission of rabies between different animals
*Experimental methods of transmission of rabies by bites

It reviewed Galtier's research of 1879–1881, and reported that research was continuing as of 1886 (the date of publication of the book).{{sfn|Théodoridès|1986|p=214}}

The book also dealt with health measures and forensics, dog control measures (wearing the collar, a muzzle, leash).{{sfn|Théodoridès|1986|p=214}}

=== 1887 ===
In 1887, Galtier received the Barbier Prize (''{{lang-fr|Prix Barbier}}'') from the {{lang|fr|[[Académie nationale de médecine]]}} for his work on rabies.

In its report on awarding the Barbier Prize to Galtier, [[Edmond Nocard]] wrote: "The discovery of Mr. Galtier, therefore, has a high importance not only from the scientific point of view but also in practical point of view; it is hoped that it will soon lead to the establishment of a simple, practical and effective treatment, saving the largest number of bitten animals."{{sfn|Théodoridès|1986|pp=197-198}}

The same year, he received the Bréant Price of the Academy of Sciences (December 1887) for his book on rabies. [[Charles Jacques Bouchard|Bouchard]], on behalf of the Commission consisting of [[Étienne-Jules Marey|Marey]], [[Jean-Martin Charcot|Charcot]], [[Charles Édouard Brown-Sequard|Brown- Séquard]] and [[Aristide Auguste Stanislas Verneuil|Verneuil]] emphasized the importance of the work of several years preceding those of [[Louis Pasteur]].{{sfn|Théodoridès|1986|p=198}}

=== 1888 ===
On January 30, 1888, Galtier published an article in the Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Galtier, Persistence of rabies virulence in buried corpses (Presented by Mr. [[Auguste Chauveau|Chauveau]]), Proceedings Academy of Sciences, 1888, Vol 106, pp 364–366.&lt;/ref&gt; He insisted that "the rabies virus retains its activity in buried corpses, so that when doubts arise afterwards about the nature of the disease that caused the death, exhumation, and inoculation of the bulb are naturally indicated".&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Galtier, Persistence of rabid virulence in buried corpses (Presented by Mr. Chauveau), Proceedings of the Academy of Science, 1888, vol 106, p 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Galtier (a veterinary professor, qualified in medical law and contagious diseases), the consequence of the persistence of the rabies virus meant that, in cases of question of the liability of animal owners, corpses could be exhumed to confirm a diagnosis of rabies.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Galtier, Persistence of rabid virulence in buried corpses (Presented by Mr. Chauveau), Proceedings of the Academy of Science, 1888, vol 106, p 366 .&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 16, 1888, he again sent a note.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Galtier, News rabies inoculation experiments to preserve herbivorous animals from rabies after rabid dog bites (Presented by Mr. Chauveau), Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences, 1888, Vol 106, pp 1189–1191.&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled his experiences in 1880–1881 showing that injection of the rabies virus in the veins of sheep and goats did not cause rabies, but instead conferred immunity.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Galtier, News rabies inoculation experiments to preserve herbivorous animals from rabies following bites from rabid dogs (Presented by M. Chauveau, Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences, 1888 Volume 106, pp 1189-1190&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that research in 1884 by [[Edmond Nocard]] and [[Émile Roux|Emile Roux]] confirmed the validity of these deductions.&lt;ref name="Nocard 1887"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nocard|first1=Edmond|last2=Roux|first2=Emile|authorlink1=Edmond Nocard|authorlink2=Pierre Paul Émile Roux|title=Expériences sur la vaccination des ruminants contre la rage par injections intraveineuses de virus rabique|journal=Annales de l'Institut Pasteur|date=1887|volume=1|pages=341–353|trans-title=Experiments on the vaccination of ruminants against rabies by intravenous injections of the rabies virus|language=fr|issn=0020-2444}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors noted that intravenous injection can prevent rabies after inoculation into the eye, and after the bite of a rabid animal.{{sfn|Théodoridès|1986|p=214}}

In his article, Galtier also related his experiments on sheep.

=== 1891 ===
The second edition of Galtier's ''On Contagious Diseases'' was published in 1891. Galtier was disappointed, to the point of physical pain,&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Galtier, Treaty of infectious diseases, 1891, vol. 2, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; by the negative remarks from [[Louis Pasteur]] about his research. Pateur stated that dogs did not acquire immunity, as Galtier found in sheep and goats, following intravenous injection of rabies.{{sfn|Théodoridès|1986|p=198}} However, [[Edmond Nocard]] and [[Émile Roux|Emile Roux]] had already confirmed in 1888 that their experiments of 1884 had confirmed Galtier's experiments of 1881.{{sfn|Théodoridès|1986|p=214}}

=== 1904 ===
In 1904, Galtier lost four of his eight children and his wife, and was strongly discouraged.&lt;ref name = "Life_Galtier" /&gt;

He published an article entitled "Pages of history"&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Galtier, A page of history. Discovery of rabies immunity. Rabies vaccination by intravenous, J. Med. Vet. Zool (Lyon), 1904, 55, pp 274–277&lt;/ref&gt; in which he wrote: "… I had studied first, from 1879-80-81, the effects of intravenous injection of the rabies virus. I was the first to demonstrate, in the most peremptory manner, its safety in herbivorous animals, and immunizing action. I established this first, before there was any thought of vaccination Pasteur or any others, that immunity against deadly rabies could be granted to certain animals by a particular method of inoculation … From 1881 onward, I had shown that virus injected into the veins of sheep and goats does not cause rabies, but confers immunity".

In this article, he promoted is pioneering rabies immunizations, stressing that the results achieved in small ruminants (sheep and goats) were confirmed by [[Edmond Nocard]] and [[Emile Roux]] in 1888.&lt;ref name="Nocard 1888"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nocard|first1=Edmond|last2=Roux|first2=Emile|authorlink1=Edmond Nocard|authorlink2=Pierre Paul Émile Roux|title=Expériences sur la vaccination des ruminants contre la rage par injections intraveineuses de virus rabique|journal=Annales de l'Institut Pasteur|date=1888|volume=2|pages=341–353|trans-title=Experiments on the vaccination of ruminants against rabies by intravenous injections of the rabies virus|language=fr|issn=0020-2444}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Théodoridès|1986|p=197}}

=== 1907 ===
In 1907, Galtier received a significant token of esteem from the [[Karolinska Institute]] of [[Stockholm]], who asked him to send all his work on rabies to offer his candidacy Nobel Prize of [[physiology]] and medicine for the year 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cadeddu|first1=Antonio|title=Les vérités de la science : pratique, récit, histoire ; le cas Pasteur|date=2005|publisher=Olschki|location=Firenze|isbn=9788822254641|page=154|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Galtier was never nominated for a Nobel Prize;&lt;ref name="Bazin 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bazin|first1=Hervé|title=Vaccination : a history from Lady Montagu to genetic engineering|date=2011|publisher=J. Libbey Eurotext|location=Montrouge|isbn=9782742007752|page=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; as his death most likely interrupted the nomination process.&lt;ref name="Bazin 2011"/&gt;

=== Other work ===
Galtier also wrote several works on the intimate nature of the tissues on the infectiousness of the virus.

He wrote two books on "Health regulation and legislation of its relationship with the pet trade" and on "The Treaty of contagious diseases and animal health."

Galtier focused mainly on infectious diseases of domestic animals: rabies, the [[common cold]], [[tuberculosis]], [[anthrax]], and [[pneumococcal enteritis]].{{sfn|Théodoridès|1986|p=190}}

{{Reformation}}
{{Protestant}}
'''Protestant Reformers''' were those [[theologian]]s whose careers, works and actions brought about the [[Protestant Reformation]] of the 16th century.

In the context of the Reformation, [[Martin Luther]] was the first reformer (sharing his views publicly in 1517), followed by people like [[Andreas Karlstadt]] and [[Philip Melanchthon]] at [[Wittenberg]], who promptly joined the new movement. In 1519, [[Huldrych Zwingli]] became the first reformer to express a form of the [[Reformed tradition]].

Listed are the most influential reformers only. They are listed by movement, although some reformers (e.g. [[Martin Bucer]]) influenced multiple movements.

For a full and detailed list of all known reformers, see ''[[List of Protestant Reformers]]''.
==Notable precursors==
{{Main|Proto-Protestantism}}

Throughout the [[Middle Ages]], there were a number of Christian [[sect]]s, [[cult]]s and [[Sociological classifications of religious movements|movements]] that sought a return to the purity of the Apostolic church and whose teachings foreshadowed Protestant ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Broadbent|first= E.H.|date= 1931|title= The Pilgrim Church|url= |location= Basingstoke|publisher= Pickering &amp; Inglis|page= |isbn= 0720806771|author-link= Edmund Hamer Broadbent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the main groups were: [[Paulicianism|Paulicans]] (6th to 9th centuries); [[Tondrakians]] (9th to 11th centuries); [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] (11th century); [[Peter of Bruys |Petrobrusians]] (12th century); [[Henry of Lausanne|Henricans]] (12th century); [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]] (13th century); [[Apostolic Brethren]] – later known as [[Dulcinian]]s – (13th to 14th centuries); [[Adamites#Neo-Adamits|Neo-Adamites]] – including [[Taborites]], [[Picards]] and some [[Beghards]] – (13th to 15th centuries); [[Men of Understanding]] (15th century).

===Anabaptist===
* [[Johannes Bünderlin]]
* [[Hans Denck]]
* [[Christian Entfelder]]

'''Richard Baerwald''' (1867&amp;ndash;1929) was a [[Germany|German]] academic [[psychologist]], in [[Berlin]].  Towards the end of his life he became interested in [[parapsychology]] and [[occultism]] (as it was interpreted at the period). He edited the ''Zeitschrift für Kritischen Okkultismus'' from 1926 to 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Kurtz, Paul. (1985). ''A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology''.

'''Christoph Joseph Rudolf Dulon''' (April 30, 1807 – April 13, 1870) was a pastor of the [[Reformed Church]] (Calvinist) and a [[socialist]] agitator in [[Bremen]]; later he was an educator in the United States.

==Life in Germany==
Dulon was descended from a [[Huguenot]] family. After completing his time in the [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], and philosophical and theological studies at the [[University of Halle]], he was ordained in [[Magdeburg]] in 1836.  He accepted pastorates at Flossau, near [[Osterberg]]. Even at this time, he put himself in opposition to Church authorities, but in so mild a way that they could be lenient. In 1843, Dulon left the [[Evangelical Church in Prussia|Prussian state Evangelical Church]] to become pastor for a [[German Reformed]] congregation in Magdeburg.

His work as an agitator dates from this time. He worked together with the so-called [[Friends of the Light]] and the "Free Congregations," though without adopting their dogmas.  What attracted him to them was their common fight against the validity of the articles of faith in the Reformed Church and the [[Catholic]]izing tendencies in the [[united and uniting churches|uniting]] Evangelical Church.  He was reprimanded, but this only seemed to encourage him.

[[Revolutions of 1848|In 1848]], a vote apparently excluded him from [[Bremen]]'s Church of Our Lady (''Liebfrauenkirche''), where he had been preaching, but a majority of the congregation overturned the decision and installed him as pastor; and the [[Senate of Bremen]], the city-state government and highest authority in the Bremen state church, initimidated by the upheavals of the time, dispensed with many of the initiation requirements only insisting on adherence to "[[Biblical literalism|the word of God]]." In undertaking his examination, Dulon explained that the Bible and God's word were for him two very different things. In November 1849 he protected the leftist [[Arnold Ruge]], granting him [[Sanctuary movement|church asylum]] from an impending arrest, and organised a further hiding place at [[Hermann Allmers]]'s, before finding refuge in Brighton.

Followers streamed to him from all quarters and levels of society, and he moved to the front of the democratic movement. [[Democracy]] and [[revolution]] were to him the true Christianity. His [[sermon]]s were characterized by their socialist content. He was strenuously opposed to the illiberal measures of the Friedrich Eichhorn, Prussian minister of cult and education. In 1850 he established the Bremen ''Tages-Chronik'' (Daily Chronicle), a social-democratic sheet - with Ruge contributing from abroad -, and ''Der Wecker. Ein Sonntagsblatt zur Beförderung des religiösen Lebens'' (The Alarmist. A Sunday paper for promoting the religious life), a religious weekly.

His string of victories became his fate.  In 1851, his newspaper was forbidden in Prussia. The senate drew courage from the changing tenor of the times.  In 1852, an intervention in Bremen was resolved upon by the [[German Confederation]], and 10,000 troops stood on the outskirts of town.  Dulon's days were numbered.  Even in 1851, members of the Friends of the Light had complained to the senate, accusing him of denying essential articles of faith, mocking the [[gospel]] and open hostility to Christianity.  The senate had referred the charges to theologians ([[Daniel Schenkel]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Carl Umbreit]], and others) in [[Heidelberg]] who had confirmed the senate (though some thought deposing pastors was outside its jurisdiction) and declared Dulon unworthy of spiritual office in the Bremen Reformed state Church.  Dulon was suspended, then dismissed and sentenced to six months in jail.  He fled to [[Heligoland]], which belonged to the United Kingdom at that time.

==Life in the United States==
In 1853 he emigrated with his numerous family to the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Carl Wittke, ''Refugees of Revolution:  The German Forty-Eighters in America'', Philadelphia:  Univ. of Penn. Press,  1952, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; where he supported himself by lecturing and teaching young people.  He became the pastor of an independent congregation in New York City, and at the same time issued a series of “Sabbath Leaves” in the interests of free religion. He started the first [[German-American]] school in the United States.  In 1855, he bought the Feldner School in New York City, and later, from 1866 until his death, directed the ''Realschule'' in [[Rochester, New York]].  Future Civil War general [[Franz Sigel]], a Badensian, taught in Dr. Dulon's New York schools, and subsequently married one of his daughters.  At the end of his life, Dulon published a book, ''The German School in America''.&lt;ref&gt;Wittke, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the history of the Evangelical Church, there has hardly been another, except possibly [[Thomas Münzer]], who has put religion in the service of revolutionary socialism so much as Rudolf Dulon.

In reality, Schurz and Kinkel were resting in [[Mecklenburg]] and still preparing to sail to England.

'''Saïd Cid Kaoui''' (12 March 1859 &amp;ndash; 15 December 1910) was an Algerian berberologist and lexicographer.

== Biography ==
Saïd ben Mohammed-Akli Cid Kaoui was born on March 12, 1859 in Ahammam, village of the powerful tribe of Oulad Abd el Djebar and located in the [[Bejaia Province|wilaya of Bejaia]] near [[Amizour|Oued Amizour]]. If his mother, Cherifa bent Saïd ben Ahmed was born in this same place, in the village of Taourirt.

His father, Mohammed Akli (Muḥend Akli), was from the Beni Sedka ({{Lang-kab|At Sedqa}}), a tribe of [[Djurdjura]], and settled in this area of the Oued Sahel after the conquest of Kabylia by the French army in 1856-57. A scholar in Arabic, it is certain, who must have belonged to the [[Marabout|Marabout caste]]. An extract of a judicial act dated April 9, 1887 where he mentioned: "from Young Si Essaïd (reads Si Saïd), son of the late Mohammed Akli Cid Kaoui". It is known that the title "Si" is reserved exclusively in these regions to marabouts and exceptionally to men versed in "religious science". In Muslim literary circles, Mohammed Akli had to call himself Muḥammad 'Akli as-Sadqawi, and this ''[[Nisba (onomastics)|nisba]]'' served as a [[Patronymic|patronymic name]] for his son when the latter, still young, wore the military uniform. He, indeed, joined the ''[[spahi]]s'' under this term but with the spelling "Cid Kaoui".&lt;ref name="EB2277"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|year=1994|title=Cid Kaoui Saïd|encyclopedia=Encyclopédie berbère|publisher=Edisud|url=http://journals.openedition.org/encyclopedieberbere/2277|last=Ould Braham|first=O.|date=|publication-place=Aix-en-Provence|volume=13 {{!}} Chèvre – Columnatien|pages=1951–1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about his childhood and the early years of his youth. He attended, like the few natives of his rank, the French primary school of Bougie, parallel to studying and reading [[Quran]] in the traditional neighborhood school, before entering lycée franco-arabe of Constantine, where he received a solid education in French and Arabic. This will open to him, later, the doors of Military interpretation.&lt;ref name="EB2277" /&gt;

Before joining the Military interpretation; at the age of 18, he enlisted in the ''Spahis'' as a volunteer for a period of four years, with the rank of brigadier, then ''[[Maréchal-des-logis]]''. He was relieved of his duties on March 5, 1881, and obtained a supervisory position at the Algiers High School, before returning to the 1st Regiment of ''Spahis'' on July 13, 1882 for four more years. Towards the beginning of 1880, he enrolled at [[University of Algiers]], in medicine, the studies he pursued for two years before opting for an interpreter course. Then, having passed his exams successfully, he was recruited on 26 September 1886 in the body of military interpreters.&lt;ref name="EB2277" /&gt;

== Recognition ==

He was honored with several high distinctions:&lt;ref name="EB2277" /&gt;

In 1895, [[Order of Glory (Tunisia)|Officer of Nichan Iftikhar]].

He received, during his stay in Paris, a bronze medal at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)]] crowning his two Tuareg dictionaries.

In 1904, [[Legion of Honour|Chevalier of the Legion of Honor]].

In 1905, [[Ordre des Palmes Académiques|Officier d’Académie]].

'''Simon "Si" Ramo''' (May 7, 1913 – June 27, 2016) was an American engineer, businessman, and author. He led development of microwave and missile technology and is sometimes known as the father of the [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM). He also developed [[General Electric|General Electric's]] [[electron microscope]]. He played prominent roles in the formation of two Fortune 500 companies, Ramo-Wooldridge ([[TRW Inc.|TRW]] after 1958) and [[Bunker Ramo Corporation|Bunker-Ramo]] (now part of [[Honeywell]]).

== Early years ==
Ramo was born in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], the son of Clara (Trestman) and Benjamin Ramo.&lt;ref&gt;https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:Q2SD-SKQT&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a [[Poland|Polish]] Jewish immigrant and his mother was a Russian Jewish immigrant. He entered the [[University of Utah]] at the age of 16, where he joined [[Theta Tau]] Professional Engineering Fraternity and earned a B.S. in [[electrical engineering]] at the age of 20. By 1936, at the age of 23, he had earned dual PhD degrees from [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] in [[physics]] and electrical engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu/2558/1/1936.pdf |title=Caltech Commencement Program |date=1936-06-12 |publisher=Caltech Campus Publications |accessdate=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
=== General Electric ===
From 1936 until 1946, he led electronics research at [[General Electric]], where he accumulated 25 patents before the age of 30 and was cited as one of America's most outstanding young electrical engineers. He became globally recognized as a leader in [[microwave]] research and headed the development of GE's [[electron microscope]].

=== Hughes Aircraft ===
In 1946 he returned to California to become director of research for the electronics department of [[Hughes Aircraft]], and his career became coupled with that of [[Dean Wooldridge]]. Together they formed a successful team for many years, with Wooldridge concentrating on investment and general business aspects while Ramo led research, development and engineering.

By 1948, Hughes had created its Aerospace Group to work with the newly created [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]. Dr. Ramo became a Vice-President and the Group's Director of Operations. Ramo employed his skills in Systems Engineering to allow Hughes to deliver integrated RADAR and aircraft fire-control systems. He developed the air-to-air missile, creating the [[AIM-4 Falcon|Falcon missile]].

In 1953 Ramo and [[Dean Wooldridge]] left Hughes Aircraft and formed the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation, later TRW Inc.

=== Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation (TRW Inc.) ===
By 1953 Ramo and the Air Force had become increasingly frustrated with management problems at Hughes. Ramo and Wooldridge were particularly concerned when [[Howard Hughes]] avoided their attempts to discuss the problem. In September they jointly resigned, and within a week they formed the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation  on September 16, 1953.

In October 1953 an Assistant [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], [[Trevor Gardner]], created a committee to consider the future of guided missiles. This [[Teapot Committee|Strategic Missile Evaluation Committee]] (SMEC) was headed by [[John von Neumann]] and included both Ramo and Wooldridge. In four months, the committee produced their report and recommended that a crash program was needed to develop [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s, and that such a program might enable the United States to overtake Russian developments by 1959 or 1960.

The Ramo-Wooldridge Corp. became the lead contractor for the resulting Air Force program. With Dr. Ramo as the driving scientific and engineering officer, they succeeded. In 1958, an [[Atlas (rocket family)|Atlas rocket]] delivered a payload 5,000 miles downrange. The Atlas would go on to serve as the launch vehicle for NASA's [[Project Mercury]] orbital flights, starting with [[John Glenn]] in [[Mercury-Atlas 6|Friendship 7]]. USAF General [[Bernard Adolph Schriever|Bernard Schriever]], head of the ICBM program, described Ramo as "the architect of the [[Thor (rocket family)|Thor]], [[Atlas (rocket family)|Atlas]], and [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]]" rockets.

According to a July 30, 2002 article, Ramo's comments are legendary for capsulizing complex ideas into off-the-cuff witticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jul/30/business/fi-ramo30/2 |title=Industry Icon Key Matchmaker in Merger of Northrop, TRW. |date=2002-07-30 |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2014-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a series of key experiments of ballistic missiles in the 1950s at Cape Canaveral, Florida, at which Ramo and Air Force General Bernard Schriever were observers, test rockets kept blowing up on their launch pads. When one missile rose about 6&amp;nbsp;inches before toppling over and exploding, Ramo reportedly beamed and said: "Well, Benny, now that we know the thing can fly, all we have to do is improve its range a bit."

Ramo-Wooldridge merged with [[TRW Inc.#History|Thompson Products]] to become TRW Inc, and Simon Ramo became Vice-Chairman. In 1964, TRW and [[Martin Marietta]] formed the jointly owned [[Bunker Ramo Corporation|Bunker-Ramo Corporation]] with Ramo as President, which expanded into the computer and communications technology fields.

In January 2008, he joined the faculty of the [[University of Southern California]]'s [[USC Viterbi School of Engineering|Viterbi School of Engineering]] as a presidential chair and professor of electrical engineering.&lt;ref name=USC011008&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/uscnews/stories/14703.html Legendary Engineer Joins USC Viterbi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224144316/http://www.usc.edu/uscnews/stories/14703.html |date=February 24, 2008 }}, USC News, January 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Ramo is also a [[List of founding members of the National Academy of Engineering|founding member]] of the [[National Academy of Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nae.edu/About/leadership/57773.aspx |title=Founding members of the National Academy of Engineering |publisher=[[National Academy of Engineering]] |accessdate={{Format date|2012|10|21}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards, appointments and fellowships ==
During his long and successful career, Ramo has received numerous awards and fellowships. He has been honored by the [[American Philosophical Society]], the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE), the [[American Physical Society]], and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

Ramo has served as an advisor to the United States government on science and technology. He has been a member of the National Science Board, the White House Council on Energy R&amp;D, the Advisory Council to the Secretary of Commerce, the Advisory Council to the Secretary of State for Science and Foreign Affairs, and of many special advisory committees to the [[U.S. Department of Defense|Defense Department]] and [[NASA]].  President [[Gerald Ford]] appointed Ramo as co-chairman of a committee of distinguished scientists and engineers, requesting Ramo to list the science and technology issues most deserving of attention by the White House and to recommend actions.  Following this, Ramo was appointed by President Ford to be chairman of The President's Advisory Committee on Science and Technology, a position created by Congress to advise on how to ensure that science and technology matters receive proper attention at the White House.

In 1980, then-President-elect [[Ronald Reagan]] asked Ramo to assemble a transition task force to advise on executive branch appointments where science and technology background was desirable.  President Reagan subsequently invited Ramo to be a Science Adviser to the President of the Republic of China.  In that assignment, Ramo aided greatly Taiwan's development of a strong high-technology industry.

On February 23, 1983, Ramo was presented with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President Reagan.

In 1982, the IEEE Board of Directors initiated the [[IEEE Simon Ramo Medal]] for exceptional achievement in systems engineering and systems science.

In 1988, Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity inducted Simon Ramo, Lambda (Utah)'33, into its [http://thetatau.org/Websites/thetatauhq/images/Alumni_Hall_Of_Fame_Laureates.pdf Alumni Hall of Fame].

In 2007, the [[Space Foundation]] awarded Ramo its highest honor, the General [[James E. Hill]] Lifetime Space Achievement Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalspacesymposium.org/symposium-awards |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203060101/http://www.nationalspacesymposium.org/symposium-awards |archivedate=February 3, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [http://thetatau.org/Websites/thetatauhq/images/Endowed_Fund_Bios.pdf Theta Tau Educational Foundation] named an annual scholarship in his honor.

'''Teresa de Benguela''' was a [[quilombo]]la leader who lived in the [[Federative units of Brazil|state]] of [[Mato Grosso]], in [[Brazil]], during the 18th century. She was married to [[José Piolho]], who headed the [[Quilombo do Piolho]] (or do Quariterê), between the [[Guaporé River]] (the boundary between [[Mato Grosso]] and [[Bolívia]]) and [[Cuiabá]] city. Following the death of José Piolho, Teresa became the queen of the quilombo, and, under her leadership, the [[Black community|black]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] community resisted  [[slavery]] for two decades, surviving up to 1770, when the quilombo was destroyed by the [[military]] forces of Luiz Pinto de Souza Coutinho. The entire population (79 black people and 30 indigenous people) was killed or arrested.

== Administration ==
Queen Teresa led the political, economical and administrative structure of the quilombo, maintaining a defense system with [[gun]]s traded with white people or redeemed from the nearby villages. The stolen objects used against the black community that used to take refugee there were transformed into work instruments, because they knew how to work with [[forge]]. The Quilombo do Guariterê, besides the parliament and a queen counselor, developed [[cotton]] production and owned [[loom]]s where they produced [[Textile|fabric]] that was commercialized outside the quilombos. They also used to sell food.&lt;ref name="geledes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geledes.org.br/noticias-direitos-humanos/inscricoes-abertas-para-iii-encontro-etnicidades.html|publisher=Geledes.org.br|author=|title=Quem foi Tereza de Benguela|date=|access-date=|work= www.geledes.org.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
McElroy was born September 15, 1901 (baptism 1903){{sfn|French|1993|page=3}} in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Massachusetts Births, 1841–1915, database with images (Charles Mcelroy in entry for Theodore Roosevelt Mcelroy, 15 Sep 1901; citing Somerville, Middlesex, Massachusetts, reference cn1093, Massachusetts Archives, Boston; FHL microfilm 2,057,386) |publisher=familysearch.org|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:FXH6-J3M|accessdate= 20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vice President Theodore Roosevelt became president of the United States upon the death of President [[William McKinley]], September 14. McElroy was born the next day and in admiration of this "cowboy president" his parents named him "Theodore Roosevelt."{{sfn|French|1993|page=3}} He went by the name Teddy, Ted, T.R., or Mac as he disliked his birth name.{{sfn|French|1993|page=3}} He was the third of six children from a family with an Irish background.&lt;ref name=Jack&gt;{{cite web |url= http://jackmcelroy.com/family-history-mcelroy-manufacturing/ |title= Entrepreneurial Family History |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= 2015|website= |publisher= JackMcElroy.com |access-date= September 20, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mid life ==
McElroy began his career at [[Western Union]] as messenger when he was 14 years old.{{sfn|French|1993|page=4}} He graduated from Forster Grammar School in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]], in 1916. In that same year he enrolled in the Commercial Course at Somerville High School.{{sfn|French|1993|page=129}} He became a telegraph operator at the age of 15.{{sfn|French|1993|page=5}} McElroy received his commercial radio operator's license at the age of nineteen.{{sfn|French|1993|page=129}}

== Family ==
McElroy's wife's name was Margaret F. McElroy (maiden name Coleman from South Boston, MA) and they were married on October 26, 1925. They had a son by the name of John C. McElroy who was born on November 11, 1926.{{sfn|French|1993|page=129}}

== Career ==
[[File:McElroy.JPG|thumb|McElroy company logo]]
McElroy went into the manufacturing business when he was 33 years old and eventually formed McElroy Manufacturing Corporation in 1941.{{sfn|French|1993|page=55}} He made straight telegraph keys and semi-automatic keys under the trade name of "Mac-Key." He had a couple of dozen variations of his telegraph keys. McElroy also made electronic code practice oscillators and inked tape keyers.&lt;ref name=set&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.radiomuseum.org/dsp_hersteller_detail.cfm?company_id=10933 |title= History of the radio manufacturer McElroy, T.R.; Boston MA |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website= |publisher= |access-date= September 20, 2015|quote= He set the all-time, still-unbroken official record of 75.2 words per minute in 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McElroy made telegraph keying equipment for US military personnel during World War II. He manufactured straight telegraph hand keys and semi-automatic keys for the public and the military in the mid 1940s.{{sfn|French|1993|pages=58–66}} The Allied Electronics 1940s catalogs showed a variety of his telegraph keys. He amassed a fortune with this equipment that earned him millions of dollars. When his military telegraph equipment was no longer needed after the war he mismanaged his money and spent most of it.&lt;ref name=set/&gt;
[[File:Mc Elroy trophy.jpg|thumb|Trophy to Theodore Roosevelt McElroy for fastest telegraphy operator receiver]]

== Contests ==
McElroy won contests for receiving speed code and setting records when he was 21 years old.{{sfn|French|1993|page=6}} He was the first radio receiver to record a speed of more than 50 words per minute.{{sfn|Kane|1997|p=454}} For his accomplishments McElroy was awarded a silver cup that was inscribed "Presented to the Champion Radio Code Operator of the World."{{sfn|French|1993|page=12}}

McElroy showed a demonstration of receiving 77 words per minute in 1935. He received a letter by the Cape Cod Radio Club attesting to this fact. The Club initially checked his speed with the 18-dot standard and recorded his speed at 90 words per minute. When the 21-dot standard is applied then his speed is computed to be 77 words per minute (18/21 times 90 wpm = 77 wpm). McElroy showed a speed of 75 words per minute in the Boston "World of Tomorrow" exhibition on 16 November 1938, although it is not counted as an official contest. He demonstrated a copy speed of 75.2 words per minute on 2 July 1939 at the Radio Club in [[Asheville, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=set/&gt;{{sfn|French|1993|page=131}}{{sfn|Coe|2003|p=168}}

McElroy was named to Philadelphia's Morse Telegraph Hall of Fame in 1964.{{sfn|French|1993|page=129}}

== Retirement  and death ==
McElroy relocated his business to [[Littleton, Massachusetts]] around 1950 and in 1955 he sold it to Telegraph Apparatus Company ("T.A.C.") of Chicago. He worked for a few years at T.A.C. and other companies that built electronic equipment, then eventually retired. He gave code demonstrations in retirement and became interested in politics. McElroy died in November 1963.&lt;ref name=set/&gt;

== Legacy ==
McElroy donated funds for the radio communication instruments for the expedition of the 1947 [[Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition]]. Because of that a mountain peak in Antarctica was named for him, [[Mount McElroy]]. It is located inland from the coast just south of latitude −74°.{{sfn|French|1993|page=75}}

'''Theudas''' was allegedly the name of a Christian [[Gnostic]] thinker, who was a follower of [[Paul of Tarsus]]. He went on to teach the Gnostic [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]]. The only evidence of this connection is the testimony of Valentinius' followers and [[Clement of Alexandria]].

'''Vernon Phillips Watkins''' (27 June 1906 – 8 October 1967) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] poet, translator and painter.&lt;ref name="W"&gt;[http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s2-WATK-PHI-1906.html Welsh Biography Online] Retrieved : 27 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He was a close friend of fellow poet [[Dylan Thomas]],&lt;ref name="W"/&gt; who described him as "the most profound and greatly accomplished Welshman writing poems in English".

==Early life and studies==
Vernon Watkins was born in [[Maesteg]] in [[Glamorgan]], and brought up mainly in [[Swansea]].&lt;ref name="W"/&gt; His birth coincided with slight earth tremors; another baby born that night was christened John Earthquake Jones. Watkins' mother was Sarah ("Sally") daughter of Esther Thomas and James Phillips of Sarnau, [[Meidrim]]. Her father, a [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], was reputed to know most of the [[Bible translations into Welsh|Welsh Bible]] by heart. Sarah had a love of poetry and literature, her headmistress arranged for her to spend two years as a pupil-teacher in Germany. Sarah married William Watkins in 1902, and they had three children: Vernon, Marjorie and Dorothy. William was a manager for [[Lloyds Bank]] in Wind Street, Swansea, and the family lived at "Redcliffe", a large [[Victorian era|Victorian]] house about {{convert|4|mi}} from Swansea, at [[Caswell Bay]].

Watkins read fluently by the age of four, and at five announced that he would be a poet, although he did not wish to be published until after his death. He wrote poetry and read widely from eight or nine years of age and was especially fond of the works of [[John Keats]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]].&lt;ref name="E"&gt;Evans&lt;/ref&gt; He received his later education at a preparatory school in Sussex, [[Repton School]] in Derbyshire, and [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]].

In his early years at Repton, Watkins' quiet, gentle character provoked regular [[bullying]] from older boys, though in his last years he attained more popularity as he was able to show capacity in tennis and cricket. After he died, in 1968, the school wrote that he was "perhaps the best poet Repton has had".&lt;sup&gt;[[Repton School|[7]]]&lt;/sup&gt; His headmaster at Repton was [[Geoffrey Fisher]], who became [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].&lt;ref name="W" /&gt; Despite his parents being [[Nonconformists]], Watkins' school experiences influenced him to join the [[Church of England]]. He read modern languages at Cambridge, but left before completing his degree.

==Career==

===Dylan Thomas and the Swansea Group===
He met [[Dylan Thomas]], who was to be a close friend, in 1935 when Watkins had returned to a job in a bank in Swansea. About once a week Thomas would come to Vernon's parents' house, situated on the very top of the cliffs of the Gower peninsula. Vernon was the only person from whom Thomas took advice when writing poetry and he was invariably the first to read his finished work. They remained lifelong friends, despite Thomas's failure, in the capacity of [[groomsman|best man]], to turn up to the wedding of Vernon and Gwen in 1944. Thomas used to laugh affectionately at his friend's gossamer-like personality and extreme sensibility. A story is told that one evening in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], during the war time blackout, they were walking along and Vernon tripped over something and fell to the ground. Thomas looked with a torch to see what the offending object was and to his delight all that they could find was a small, black feather (FitzGibbon 1966). Vernon was godfather to Thomas's son Llewelyn, the others being [[Richard Cyril Hughes|Richard Hughes]] and [[Augustus John]]. ''Letters to Vernon Watkins'' by Thomas was published in 1957.&lt;ref name="W"/&gt; The 1983 book ''Portrait of a Friend'' by Watkins' wife Gwen, ''née'' Davies, deals with the relationship.

Others in the Swansea Group known as the "[[The Kardomah Gang|Kardomah boys]]" were the composer [[Daniel Jones (composer)|Daniel Jenkyn Jones]], writer [[Charles Fisher (poet)|Charles Fisher]] and the artists [[Alfred Janes]] and Mervyn Levy. Vernon wrote the obituary for Dylan Thomas and when he died, [[Philip Larkin]] wrote his obituary.

===Bletchley Park and marriage===
Watkins met Gwen, who came from Harborne, [[Birmingham]], at [[Bletchley Park]], where he worked during the [[Second World War]] as a [[cryptography|cryptographer]], and she, as a member of the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force|WAAF]], was engaged in breaking [[Luftwaffe]] codes.&lt;ref name="W"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907942861 |title=The Bletchley girls: War, Secrecy, Love and Loss - the women of Bletchley Park tell their story |last=Dunlop |first=Tessa |authorlink=Tessa Dunlop |isbn=9781444795738 |location=London|oclc=907942861}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were married at the Church of St Bartholomew the Great in London on 2 October 1944. The couple had five children.

==Poetry==
His ambitions were for his poetry; in critical terms they were not to be fulfilled. On the other hand, he became a major figure for the Anglo-Welsh poetry tradition, and his poems were included in major anthologies. During the war he was for a time associated with the [[New Apocalyptics]] group. With his first book ''Ballad of the Mari Llwyd'' (1941) accepted by [[Faber and Faber]], he had a publisher with a policy of sticking by their authors. In his case this may be considered to have had an adverse long-term effect on his reputation, in that it is generally thought that he over-published. Of the book, the publisher said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Mr Vernon Watkins is a Welsh poet whose work hitherto has appeared only in periodicals and in recent anthologies. The only influence apparent upon his poetry is one he has thoroughly assimilated - that of [[W. B. Yeats]]. Otherwise his style differs radically from that of any of his older contemporaries, except for a racial quality which gives it something in common with that of Dylan Thomas. Mr Watkins is undoubtedly a poet with an uncommon sense of rhythm as well as of imagery."&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, V. (1941). ''The Ballad of the Mari Lwyd and other poems'', London: [[Faber and Faber]] (rear dust jacket)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[British Library]] holds a manuscript draft of the poem with annotations by [[T. S. Eliot]], showing Eliot at work as editor and board member at the publishing house Faber - his "day job" since 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/manuscript-draft-of-the-ballad-of-the-mari-lwyd-by-vernon-watkins|title=Manuscript draft of 'The Ballad of the Mari Lwyd' by Vernon Watkins, with annotations by T S Eliot|website=The British Library|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watkins wrote poetry for several hours every night and by way of contrast, Caitlin, Dylan Thomas's wife, could not recall her husband staying in even for one night during their whole married life. As well as Yeats Vernon was familiar with [[T. S. Eliot]] and Philip Larkin. He was awarded a [[University of Wales]] honorary Doctorate of Literature in 1966 after retiring from his job at the bank. He was being considered for [[Poet Laureate]] at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="W"/&gt;

::That July morning when the poet's widow
::Stayed here, at breakfast looking through the window
::We saw young rabbits leap, and in a pother
::Frisk, dance and scurry, dodging one another,
::Returning always to the selfsame corner
::Between low beech-trees and the grassy border.
::They scattered when my children running out
::Found a young Redpoll injured on the ground.
::This sacrifice had made the rabbits dance.
::It had fallen from the fuchsia bush or branch
::Of beech that shook down dewdrops on my head.
::I for a moment thought the brilliant red
::Of breast and crest had come from a hawk's wound,
::But found no blood. The heart beat faintly. Soon
::We had laid it in a box, propped upon silk.
::I touched the twig-like leg. White bread and milk
::We gave it, but the beak at once refused,
::After one drop, to drink, and the eyes closed.
::It woke when my warm hand, encircling, took it,
::Straining to perch; but whether claw was crooked
::Or the wing hurt, it could not fly or stand.
::We left it where life's ember might be fanned
::By sunlight through a window. It revived
::A little. But the warmth on which it lived
::Diminished then, in the late afternoon.
::It was so small, so quiet in my room,
::That when I turned to lift it from the sill
::And feel its weight upon my fingers, still
::I counted to awaken it, nor saw
::What breath had chilled the feathers, gripped the claw;
::Nor did the dainty bird with that red stain
::Seem dead at all, until I looked again.
:::Watkins, ''The Redpoll'', a later poem, never fully revised.

==Death and memorial==

[[File:Vernon Watkins memorial at Pennard church - geograph.org.uk - 1308796.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque at St Mary's Church, [[Pennard]]]]

Watkins had developed a serious heart condition, which he made light of, insisting on playing his beloved tennis and squash with his usual vigour. He died on 8 October 1967, aged 61, playing tennis in [[Seattle]], where he had gone to teach a course on modern poetry at the [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref name="W"/&gt;

His body was returned to Britain, and was buried in the Gower, at St Mary's Church, [[Pennard]]. A small granite memorial to him stands at Hunt's Bay, Gower, on which are inscribed two lines from his poem "Taliesin in Gower": "I have been taught the script of stones, and I know the tongue of the wave."

A portrait of Watkins by his friend [[Alfred Janes]] may be seen in the [[Glynn Vivian Art Gallery]], Swansea. A group portrait of the Kardomah Boys by Jeff Phillips was unveiled at Tapestri Arts Centre in Swansea in June 2011. Featured in the painting are Vernon Watkins, John Pritchard, Dylan Thomas, Daniel Jones and Alfred Janes. The picture is based on a [[BBC]] ''[[Radio Times]]'' front cover from October 1949.

In March 2012, in the [[BBC Radio 3]] programme ''Swansea's Other Poet'', [[Rowan Williams|Dr Rowan Williams]], Archbishop of Canterbury, presented a portrait of Watkins. Williams regards Watkins as "one of the 20th century's most brilliant and distinctive yet unjustly neglected voices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Laura Chamberlain |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/posts/vernon_watkins_swanseas_other_poet |title=Blogs – Wales – Vernon Watkins, Swansea's Other Poet |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014 [[City and County of Swansea Council|Swansea Council]] unveiled a [[blue plaque]] for Watkins outside the building on the corner of St Helen's Road and Beach Street in the city, where he spent 38 years working for Lloyds Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/dylan-thomas-pal-codebreaker-poet-8018052|title=Dylan Thomas' pal the codebreaker poet Vernon Watkins is remembered in his hometown Swansea|first=Robin|last=Turner|date=29 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-29814234|title=Plaque honours Swansea's second poet, Vernon Watkins|date=29 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swansea.gov.uk/article/10216/Poet-and-codebreaker-honoured-with-blue-plaque|title=Swansea - Poet and codebreaker honoured with blue plaque|website=www.swansea.gov.uk|accessdate=14 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125234100/http://www.swansea.gov.uk/article/10216/Poet-and-codebreaker-honoured-with-blue-plaque|archive-date=25 November 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 November 2014 the "Poem of the Week" in ''[[The Guardian]]'' was Watkins' "Three Harps".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/03/poem-of-the-week-three-harps-vernon-watkins|title=Poem of the week: Three Harps by Vernon Watkins|first=Carol|last=Rumens|date=3 November 2014|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Watkins's manuscripts are held by the [[National Library of Wales]], Aberystwyth.

His grandson, [[Marley Watkins]], has played football for [[Norwich City F.C.]] and for [[Bristol City F.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40041499|title=Ethan Ampadu: Exeter City youngster included in Wales squad|date=25 May 2017|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

'''Yatuta Chisiza''' (born 1926 – died October 1967, near [[Blantyre, Malawi]]) was a former [[Malawi]]an minister of home affairs who led a brief guerrilla incursion into the country in October 1967.

He entered Mwanza district from Tanzania with nine others.&lt;ref&gt;http://ngomamotovibes.com/chiume/CABINETCRISIS1964.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the following clash with security forces on 9 October 1967 he and two other members of insurgent forces were killed, five captured, others fleeing.&lt;ref&gt;http://malawiyoungpioneers.netfirms.com/article3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Chisiza was born&lt;ref&gt;http://www.evri.com/media/article?title=Obituary:+Dunduza+Chisiza+-+Arts+%26amp%3B+Entertainment+-+The+...&amp;page=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-dunduza-chisiza-1084771.html&amp;referring_uri=/person/yatuta-chisiza-0x33765&amp;referring_title=Evri&lt;/ref&gt; in the Karonga district of northern Malawi (then [[Nyasaland]]) in 1926, to Kaluli Chisiza, a Group Village Headman. He was educated at [[Uliwa]] Junior [[Primary School]] and at the mission school at [[Livingstonia]]. He subsequently worked as an Assistant Inspector of Police in [[Tanzania]] (then [[Tanganyika]]) and returned to Malawi in 1958. For a short time he, together with his brother [[Dunduzu Chisiza]], attempted to go in business operating a butcher's shop in Blantyre market,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Political Culture and Nationalism in Malawi|last = Power|first = Joey|publisher = University of Rochester Press|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-58046-310-2|location = New York|pages = 78}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this venture soon failed.

==Nyasaland Independence Movement==
After the historic [[Nyasaland African Congress]] convention in January 1959, he was appointed as [[bodyguard]] to [[Hastings Kamuzu Banda]], who later became the first [[premier]] of Malawi. He was arrested along with hundreds of others (including his brother) in the dawn raids of Operation Sunrise on 3 March 1959, when the colonial administration declared a state of emergency in [[Nyasaland]]. In 1960 he was named as Secretary General of the MCP under Banda's presidency. He was imprisoned in [[Khami Prison]] near [[Bulawayo]], [[Southern Rhodesia]]. He was released, some months after Banda, in September 1960.

==Political career==
After the death of his brother, [[Dunduzu Chisiza]], in September 1962, Yatuta was elected to the [[Legislative Council]] for Karonga district and Banda appointed him [[Minister (government)|Minister]] of [[Home Affairs]].

==Nyasaland cabinet crisis==
Not long after Malawi had gained independence from [[Great Britain]] in July 1964, he was one of several cabinet ministers who, chafing under an increasingly autocratic leadership, were ousted by Banda in the [[Cabinet Crisis of 1964]]. He fled the country and, allegedly after undergoing military training in [[China]], later conducted guerilla operations against the Banda regime from Tanzania. Here, Chisiza founded the [[Socialist League of Malawi]] (LESOMA), the most radical Malawian party in opposition to the Banda regime. Chisiza was succeeded by [[Attati Mpakati]]. Another exiled Malawian and important member of LESOMA was [[Mahoma Mwakipunda Mwaungulu|Mahoma M. Mwaungulu]].

==Paul Theroux &amp; the bread van affair==
In 1964 [[Paul Theroux]], an outspoken, American, Peace Corps Volunteer in Nyasaland, was declared persona non grata by Dr. Hastings Banda for supporting Yatuta, who was accused of attempting to overthrow the government.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peacecorpswriters.org/pages/2000/0003/prntvers003/pv003pchist.html&lt;/ref&gt; Theroux delivered a letter from an exiled opposition leader, [[David Rubadiri]], to Chisiza in Tanzania. He also carried a coded messages from Chisiza to a "Greek fellow" in Blantyre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peacecorpswriters.org/pages/2000/0003/prntvers003/pv003pchist.html&lt;/ref&gt; According to an account by Theroux in [[Esquire Magazine]], when Theroux delivered the message on October 16 to the Greek baker, who was en route to delivering his bread to Ntcheu, 
the baker "trembled and went pale".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peacecorpswriters.org/pages/2000/0003/prntvers003/pv003pchist.html&lt;/ref&gt;" : guessed the Greek baker had been caught, interrogated by the Malawi Criminal Investigation Department about bread van", and exposed Yatutas whearabouts and Theroux's involvement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peacecorpswriters.org/pages/2000/0003/prntvers003/pv003pchist.html&lt;/ref&gt; Banda told the American ambassador that he had proof Theroux was plotting to kill him, and demanded the volunteer be sent home. He found out later that in his final day, instead of finding bread waiting in a van, Chisiza found Malawi soldiers, who ambushed and killed the revolutionary gunman from Tanzania where he was plotting against Banda.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peacecorpswriters.org/pages/2000/0003/prntvers003/pv003pchist.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Theroux]] was thrown out of the Peace Corp for his role in Malawi and is now a renowned novelist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peacecorpswriters.org/pages/2000/0003/prntvers003/pv003pchist.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==His death==
Chisiza was killed by a single shot to the head in October 1967, apparently by Malawian security forces, although rumours have attributed a role to security forces of the [[Ian Smith]] regime in Southern Rhodesia. His body was put on display at the [[Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital]] near [[Blantyre, Malawi|Blantyre]] as a warning to other potential insurgents.
&lt;br /&gt;
He was survived by two sons, Vyande Yatuta Chisiza and Kwacha Chisiza, and grandchildren: Millie, Bakalele, Mphikwa, Matebe, Mutale, Lusayo, Atupele, Mbakaya and Chikosa. He is the brother of [[Dunduzu Chisiza]], and uncle to [[Du Chisiza]] Jnr.
