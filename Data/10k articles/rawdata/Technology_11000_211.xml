}}

An '''air-gap flash''' is a photographic light source capable of producing sub-microsecond light flashes, allowing for (ultra) [[high-speed photography]]. This is achieved by a high-voltage (20&amp;nbsp;kV typically) electric discharge between two electrodes over the surface of a quartz (or glass) tube. The distance between the electrodes is such that a spontaneous discharge does not occur. To start the discharge a high-voltage pulse is applied on an electrode inside the quartz tube.

The flash can be triggered electronically by being synchronised with an electronic detection device such as a microphone or an interrupted laser beam in order to illuminate a fast event. A sub-microsecond flash is fast enough to photographically capture a supersonic bullet in flight without noticeable motion blur.

==History==
The person credited with popularising the flash is [[Harold Eugene Edgerton]], though earlier scientists such as [[Ernst Mach]] also used a spark gap as a fast photographic lighting system.  [[Henry Fox Talbot|William Henry Fox Talbot]] is said to have created the first spark-based flash photo, using a [[Leyden jar]], the original form of the capacitor. Edgerton was one of the founders of [[EG&amp;G]] company who sold an air-gap flash under the name Microflash 549.&lt;ref&gt;http://people.rit.edu/andpph/text-microflash-549-manual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There are several commercial flashes available today.

== Design parameters ==

The aim of a high-speed flash is to be very fast and yet bright enough for adequate exposure. An air-gap flash system typically consists of a capacitor that is discharged through a gas (air in this case). The speed of a flash is mainly determined by the time it takes to discharge the capacitor through the gas. This time is proportional to

&lt;math&gt;t_{discharge} \propto {\sqrt{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;,

in which L is the inductance and C the capacitance of the system. To be fast, both L and C must be kept small.

The brightness of the flash is proportional to the energy stored in the capacitor:

&lt;math&gt;E = {{CV^2} \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;,

where V is the voltage across the capacitor. This shows that high brightness calls for a large capacitance and a high voltage. However, since a large capacitance would have a relatively long discharge time that would make the flash slow, the only practical solution is to use a very high voltage on a relatively small capacitor, with a very low inductance. Typical values are 0.05&amp;nbsp;µF capacitance, 0.02&amp;nbsp;µH inductance, 10&amp;nbsp;J energy, 0.5&amp;nbsp;µs duration and about 20&amp;nbsp;MW power.&lt;ref&gt;Edgerton, Harold E. (19706). ''Electronic flash, strobe'', Chapter 7, Mc Graw Hill, New-York. {{ISBN|007018965X}} / 0-07-018965-x.&lt;/ref&gt;

Air (mainly nitrogen) is preferred as a gas because it is fast. Xenon has a much higher efficiency in turning energy into light, but is limited in speed to about 10 microseconds, caused by its own afterglow.

The spark is guided over a quartz surface to improve the light output and benefit from the cooling capacity, making the flash faster.&lt;ref&gt;Topler, M, Ann Physik, vol. 4, no. 27, pp 1043-1050, 1908&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edgerton, H.E.K, K. Cooper and J. tredwell, Submicrosecond Flash Source, J. SMTPE, vol. 70,p. 117, March, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; This has a negative effect in the form of quartz erosion because of high energy discharge.

== Spectral properties ==

Since the spark gap discharges in air generating a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], the spectrum shows both a continuum and [[spectral lines]], mainly of [[nitrogen]] since air is 79% nitrogen.
The spectrum is rich in [[UV]] but covers the entire visible range down to [[infra-red]].
When a [[quartz]] tube is used as ignition tube, it shows a clear [[phosphorescence]] in blue after the flash, induced by the UV.

[[File:BeltPress.svg|right|thumb|400px|Diagram of a belt filter: sludge in the '''feed hopper''' is sandwiched between two filter cloths (shown green and purple). Fluid is extracted initially by gravity, then by squeezing the cloth through rollers. '''Filtrate''' exits through a drain, while solids are scraped off into a container.]]
The '''belt filter''' (sometimes called a '''belt press filter''', or '''belt filter press''') is an industrial [[machine]], used for solid/liquid separation processes, particularly the [[dewatering]] of [[sludge]]s in the [[chemical industry]], [[mining]] and [[water treatment]]. Belt filter presses are also used in the production of [[Apple cider#Commercial production|apple juice, cider]] and winemaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.core-equip.com/catalogue/category/1465|title=Core belt filter presses designed for the apple juice, cider and winemaking industries.|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of [[filtration]] is primarily obtained by passing a pair of [[Filter (chemistry)|filtering]] cloths and belts through a system of rollers.  The system takes a [[sludge]] or [[slurry]] as a feed, and separates it into a [[filtrate]] and a solid cake.

==Applications==
The belt filter is mainly used for dewatering&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; of sludge and slurry and juice extraction from apples, pears and other fruits, as well as grapes for winemaking, etc. Belt filters are used both municipally and industrially in a range of areas including urban [[sewage treatment|sewage]] and [[industrial wastewater treatment|wastewater treatment]], metallurgy and mining, steel plants, coal plants, breweries, dyeing, tanneries, as well as chemical and paper factories.&lt;ref name=ChinaBS&gt;http://www.china-blackstone.com, Zhengzhou Black Stone Machinery Co. LTD., 2012, 1 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The applications of a belt filter are only limited to the sludges, slurry or mashed fruit that it can process. The sludges from municipal use include raw, anaerobically digested and aerobically digested sludges, alum sludge, lime softening sludge and river water silt.&lt;ref name=KSwebsite&gt;http://www.beltfilterpress.com, Komline-Sanderson, 2013,  "Belt Filter Press", Komline-Sanderson Engineering Corporation, Peapack, USA, viewed 2 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In industry, any sludge or slurry is sourced from food processing wastes, pulp and paper wastes, chemical sludges, pharmaceutical wastes, industrial waste processing sludges, and petrochemical wastes.&lt;ref name=KSwebsite /&gt; These wastes can include mixed sludge, mineral slurry, dust sediment, selected coal washing mud, biological sludge, primary sludge, and straw, wood or waste paper pulp.&lt;ref name=ChinaBS /&gt;

Some dewatering objectives include reducing the volume to reduce the transport and storage costs, removing liquids before landfill disposal, reducing fuel requirements before further drying or incineration, producing adequate material for composting, avoiding runoff and pooling when used for land applications, and optimizing other drying processes.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; Belt filters are specifically designed for each of these particular applications and feeds.

==Advantages/limitations==
There are many physical separation processes similar to the belt filter press used for dewatering, including [[centrifuge]]s, vacuum-disc filters, and the plate and frame [[filter press]]. When compared to other compression filters, belt filters use relatively lower pressures.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; Although centrifuges have lower moisture content, lower costs and simpler operations in coal tails processing,&lt;ref name=Steel&gt;Mohanty, M.K. Wang, Z. Huang, Z., Hirschi, J., 2004, ''Optimization of the Dewatering Performance of a Steel Belt Filter'', Coal Preparation Journal, 24:53 68&lt;/ref&gt; belt filters tend to make less noise and have much quicker startup and shutdown times.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;

Belt filters are considered simple and reliable, with good availability, low staffing, easy maintenance and a long life.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;&lt;ref name=KSwebsite /&gt;&lt;ref name=SLFiltration /&gt; The belt filter is most advantageous when installed such that it is open and viewable at floor level for easier adjustment and monitoring. This is of course subject to what lighting and ventilation will allow.&lt;ref name=SLFiltration /&gt;

The belt filter press is often used in wastewater treatment, and thus the odour of the feed sludge, volatile emissions and the chemicals used in treatment, may become a problem.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; One control method is to use odour-neutralizing chemicals such as potassium permanganate.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; However this only neutralizes odours and doesn’t affect any gases or chemicals involved.  Although all problems can be controlled by enclosing the filter, the enclosure reduces essential visibility and easy access to the machine for maintenance and repairs, leading to the expensive automation of the process.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt;

A belt filter press is also known for its high capacity throughput,&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; as it is designed to handle excess capacity.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; It has low initial costs&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; and low energy running costs,&lt;ref name=KSwebsite /&gt; however, if throughput is less than 4 million gallons per day, the belt filter press may be less cost efficient than liquid transport, hiring a processing facility, or utilizing non-mechanical dewatering methods such as drying beds or reed beds.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;

Belt filters are less effective at processing some feeds. Unless the feed is well mixed from a [[Anaerobic digestion|digester]], the use of belt filters will be more costly when processing a feed with varying solids content as this requires more operator attention, raising staffing costs.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; Feeds with high grease and oil content can lower the solids percentage in the cake by blinding the belt filter&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; and all feeds need to be screened to protect the belt from being damaged by sharp objects. The type of feed may also affect the washing process. The belt filter needs to be washed frequently which consumes large amount of water and time.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; Water and time wastage, as well as the associated costs can be reduced by automating the washing system and using [[effluents]].&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;

==Designs available==
Belt filter designs are crafted using manufacturer design and performance data, operating installations, pilot testing, surveys of similar plants and testing of the wastewater solids&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; to obtain a desired dewatered solid percentage from the sludge or slurry to be processed.

Belt press filters have 4 main zones: preconditioning zone, gravity drainage zone, linear compression (low-pressure) zone and roller compression (high-pressure) zone.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; Preconditioned slurry, which is flocculated and/or coagulated depending on the feed and process, is thickened in the gravity drainage zone.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; The gravity drainage zone is a flat or inclined belt where gravity drainage of free water occurs&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; The gravity drainage area is sized according to feed solid concentrations. The standard size can be used for solids concentrations of 1.5 percent or greater, but a setup with a longer drainage area or extended size should be used for 1.5 to 2.5 percent feed solids for more free water drainage before compression. For dilute sludge with feed solids of less than 1.5 percent, an independent gravity drainage belt can be used. This belt is used only in the gravity drainage area, not in the pressure zones.&lt;ref name= KSIII&gt;http://www.beltfilterpress.com, Komline-Sanderson, "GRS Series III Kompress Belt Filter Press", Komline-Sanderson, 1 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure or wedge zones use two belts, upper and lower, to sandwich the feed together,&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; but an independent gravity zone has its own separate belt, making the belt filter a three-belt system. Depending on the required conditions of the cake, belt filters can have added washing stages and, infrared, hot gas or even microwave drying stages.&lt;ref name=SLFiltration&gt;Sparks, T.,''Solid-Liquid Filtration – A Users’ Guide to Minimizing Costs and Environmental Impact; Maximizing Quality and Productivity'', Elsevier, Portland, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Belt filters are very versatile and are made to suit the sludges, slurries or mashed fruit to be processed. For a feed or treatment process which produces unpleasant odours, [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] emissions, [[pathogens]] and hazardous gases like [[hydrogen sulphide]]&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;&lt;ref name=SLFiltration /&gt; the belt filter can include fume hoods or even be completely enclosed in a gas tight housing.&lt;ref name=SLFiltration /&gt;  Due to the reduced visibility and increased corrosion associated with enclosure, the belt filter process can also be automated.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; Large filtration areas, additional rollers and a variable belt speed can be found in advanced belt press filter designs.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;

==Process characteristics==
Belt press filters are designed for solids capacity, by weight or volume, rather than wastewater flow. Solids concentration must be determined based on the concentration of primary solids in the feed and further solids that may precipitate during treatment. Solids concentration for a process will vary, thus the design must have the capacity to deal with varying feed solids concentration.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS&gt;''Biosolids Technology Fact Sheet: Belt Filter Press'', US Environmental Protection Agency, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The feed to a belt press filter depends on the type of solids, desired product and filter design. For most sludge types the feed dry solids concentration is typically in the range of 1-10%.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; The resulting dewatered sludge (or cake) dry solids concentration typically falls in the range of 12-50%.&lt;ref name=DesignIR&gt;''Design Information Report: Belt Filter Presses'', US Environmental Protection Agency, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Dilute feed solids concentration results in a cake of higher moisture content whilst a higher feed solids concentration yields an improved solids filtration rate and drier end product.&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;R. Perry, D. Green, ''Perry’s Chemical Engineers’ Handbook'', 8th edition, McGraw-Hill, 2007, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

The input to a belt press filter is generally measured as the rate of dry [[solids loading]] (mass of dry solids per time per belt width). Again, the input solids loading is dependent on the sludge type and filter media, thus there is great variation in the dry solids loading rates of operating belt press filters. Typically, lower range solids loading rates fall in the range of 40–230&amp;nbsp;kg/h/m belt width and high range solids loading rates fall in the range of 300–910&amp;nbsp;kg/h/m belt width.&lt;ref name=DesignIR /&gt; Whilst loading is important for measuring production rate, it is also important to consider the thickness of the cake that forms in the gravity drainage section. Cake thickness affects the permeability of the filtration media and the filtration rate.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; Testing for the particular sludge type must be conducted to determine the optimum cake thickness. In some cases where filtrate recovery is important, it may be necessary to introduce a cake [[washing (process)|washing]] step.

The primary objective of a belt press filter is to dewater process sludge and much of this dewatering occurs in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone can achieve a 5 to 10 percent increase in solids concentration.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; The degree of dewatering in the gravity drainage zone is greatly dependent on the type of solids, the filter media and the sludge conditioning. The dewatering achieved in the gravity drainage zone is adversely affected if the sludge is poorly spread across the belt or the residence time is insufficient.&lt;ref name=DesignIR /&gt; Sludge conditioning is the addition of chemicals to promote [[flocculation]] of particles to form a thickened sludge and to promote dewatering. Dewatering can be promoted by the addition of [[surfactant]] and flocculation is achieved via the addition of high molecular weight polymer. Flocculation is improved with optimum polymer dosage, polymer dilution and mixing. The [[pH]] of the feed slurry must also be monitored and controlled as low pH decreases flocculation.&lt;ref name=LabTechnique&gt;Richard A. Poduska P.E. Ph.D. &amp; B. H. Collins Jr., ''A simple laboratory technique for determining belt-filter press operation'', Environmental Technology Letters, 1980, 1:12, p. 547-556&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to find the optimum value for each conditioning parameter as too much polymer or mixing can have a negative impact on flocculation and greatly increase operating expenses.&lt;ref name=LabTechnique /&gt; The effects of sludge conditioning are most apparent in the gravity drainage zone which can be easily replicated on a laboratory scale where the optimum conditioning strategy can be determined.&lt;ref name=LabTechnique /&gt; For a belt press filter to be industrially viable it must be economically efficient and thus maximum throughput is desired. Without sufficient conditioning, the gravity drainage is generally the limiting process step, but with optimum dilution the limiting process step can be shifted to the compression zone.&lt;ref name=LabTechnique /&gt;

In the compression zone of a belt press filter, the filter cake is compressed between the two belts and passed over rollers to exert pressure on the cake. There is an optimum number of rollers above which a drier product is not necessarily the result. Drier product is obtained from reduced belt speed rather than increased pressing time.&lt;ref name=MunicipalSD&gt;Oliver, J. and Vaxelaire, J., ''Municipal sludge dewatering by belt filter press: effect of operating parameters'', Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotecnology, 2005, 80, p. 948-953&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall performance of a belt press filter is improved where variations in parameters such as sludge type, feed solids concentration and conditioning are minimised.&lt;ref name=DesignIR /&gt;

The efficiency of a belt press filter is often assessed based on the dry solids content of the product cake, solids recovery and lateral migration of sludge on the belt.&lt;ref name=MunicipalSD /&gt; Solids recovery is the percentage of dry solids recovered from the feed sludge. Solids recovery is dependent on the filter media which must be selected for good permeability to promote dewatering but with pore diameter sufficiently small so that solids recovery is not greatly decreased. It is important that the belt press filter has an effective belt washing section so that [[blinding(filtration)|blinding]] does not decrease the permeability of the belt.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; Solids recovery is directly related to filtrate quality and thus the filter media and process arrangement must satisfy the desired cake and filtrate qualities. Dry solids content is a measure of the degree of dewatering. The degree of dewatering is increased when the belt speed is decreased.&lt;ref name=MunicipalSD /&gt; Lowering the belt speed reduces the capacity of the process. The following correlation relates input mass flow rate to belt speed:&lt;ref name=MunicipalSD /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Q_0=m_0 s_b L_{sludge0} &lt;/math&gt;

Where Q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = mass flow rate (kg/s), m&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = mass loading (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), s&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = belt speed (m/s) and L&lt;sub&gt;sludge0&lt;/sub&gt; = initial width of sludge across the belt (m). Thus to maintain industrial scale economic throughput at lower belt speed, the mass loading and width of sludge across the belt must be increased. It has been found that increasing the solids loading slightly decreases the dry solids concentration of the cake while significantly increasing the potential for sludge to overflow the belt.&lt;ref name=MunicipalSD /&gt; Lateral migration of sludge on the belt is a measure of how the sludge spreads across the width of the belt. Increased lateral sludge migration means that sludge is escaping the edge of the belt and overflowing into the filtrate. Therefore, increased lateral sludge migration negatively impacts filtrate quality and dry solids recovery.

Generally, the minimum design discharge cake thickness is 3–5&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; This ensures that the cake is thick enough to discharge and is easily removed from the belt.

==Heuristics of the design==
In order of increasing cost and decreasing product moisture the most common dewatering options are a [[Gravity separation|thickener]], [[deep bed thickeners|deep bed thickening]], belt presses and [[membrane filter presses]]. In general [[centrifuges]] and other competing technologies do not show a significant cost advantage compared to the belt press filter, for the same cake dryness. The cost of flocculant is often a major operating cost of dewatering equipment. Belt press filters in general have the lowest flocculant consumption for any of the listed processes excluding membrane filter presses and centrifuges.&lt;ref name=TailingsDT&gt;http://www.acarp.com.au/abstracts.aspx?repId=C14012, Bickert. G, "Tailings Dewatering Technologies for Australian Coal Processing Plants", Australians Coal Association Research Program, Report Number C14012 , 2004, viewed 2 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing the feed solid concentration increases the solid filtration rate, minimises cake moisture content and produces a more homogeneous cake all of which are desirable outcomes. If increasing the feed solid concentration is not practical the addition of flocculants in a pre-treatment step has a similar result. The optimum dosage level of flocculant can be found by monitoring the [[viscosity]] of the slurry.

[[Homogeneous]] cakes are desirable as if the feed slurry is too dilute the filter cake will contain higher moisture content as a result of stratification. The minimum feed concentration that results in a homogeneous cake is determined by observing a sample of the slurry. If rapid settling occurs the filter cake formed will not be homogeneous and the filtration rate is decreased.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt;

The minimum cake discharge thickness for horizontal belt press filters is in the region of 5&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt;

The choice of belt is critical to the function of the belt press filter and a wide variety of materials and weaves are available. The filter cloth for a belt press filter should be as open as possible while maintaining the desired filtrate clarity or, if precoat is used, to prevent the loss of precoat. Lighter cloths produce a clearer filtrate and do not block as rapidly however their durability and life span is significantly shorter than heavier cloths.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; Both seamless and seamed belts are available. Seamed belts wear faster at the seam and cause wear at the rollers and the doctor blade. Zipper-type and clipper-type seamed belts are also available with the zipper-type having a longer life span as they provide less discontinuity. Seamless belts have the longest life span but are more expensive. Also it should be ensured that the belt press is compatible with a seamless belt.&lt;ref name=DesignIR /&gt;

Increasing the temperature of the feed slurry decreases the viscosity of the liquid phase. This is beneficial as it increases the filtration rate and decreases the cake moisture. The same advantages can be obtained by other drying methods such as passing dry steam through the deliquored cake to raise the temperature of the remaining moisture, or other [[drying]] methods can be utilised.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt;

Cake thickness may have to be controlled or restricted when cake washing is required or the final cake moisture is a critical parameter. When cake washing time is a dominating factor the maximum filtration rate will occur when the minimum cake thickness for discharge is achieved. The time required for washing is increased by the square of the ratio of cake thicknesses. For example, if the thickness of the cake is doubled the washing time will increase roughly by a factor of 4.

==Necessary post-treatment systems==
Completely clear filtrate cannot be obtained using belt press filters except in rare circumstances. Thus further treatment may be required for the filtrate before it is reused or discharged as waste. If the filter is downstream of a [[clarifier]] or thickener the filtrate (and wash water) can be recycled back into the clarifier to reduce the required filtrate clarity and allows for the use of more durable cloths. If recycling or reuse is not an option the filtrate should be discharged subject to legislation and license requirements. Further treatment of clarified water (filtration or chemical treatment) may be required before discharge.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt;

The filter cake usually has a high enough solid concentration to allow for all types of disposal methods without further treatment including recycling back into the process, landfill/composting and incineration. The polymer content makes filter cake from a belt press filter more suited to the aforementioned disposal methods than a cake conditioned with ferric chloride and lime which can occur with other dewatering processes.&lt;ref name=DesignIR /&gt;

==Recent developments==
Significant developments in belt press filter technology include: cloth developments, using three belts and, the V-fold belt. Cloth developments include the double weave which incorporates different yarn types to combine the specific advantages of each.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; A double weave woven wire belt is also available which has a better life span and durability than a conventional wire belt.&lt;ref name=SyntheticBelts&gt;http://spirofil-averinox.com/product-groups/synthetic-woven-belts Spirofil-Averinox , 2012, "Synthetic Woven Belts &amp; Synthetic Filter Cloth", Spirofil-Averinox, viewed 2nd  October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A belt press filter using three belts can achieve independent speeds and have different belt types for the pressure and gravity zones.&lt;ref name= KSIII /&gt;&lt;ref name=BDPwebsite&gt;http://www.engamerica.com/uploaded/Doc/BDP_Belt_Filter_Press.pdf, BDP Industries, "Model 3DPTM Belt Filter Press", BDP Industries New York, USA, viewed 2 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the filter system to accommodate higher hydraulic loadings occurring with dilute feed sludge (feed solid concentration below 1.5%).  The three belt system is more efficient with both a higher production rate and cake solid concentration at the expense of mechanical complexity.&lt;ref name= KSIII /&gt;

The V-fold belt is similar to the belt filter press with the main difference being that only a single belt, folded along the centreline is used. The technology has not been widely proven. A final dry weight solids content of 9-13% can usually be achieved; this is smaller than competing technologies. Currently this technology is suited to small-scale applications (up to approximately 3000 L of slurry per hour as the maximum belt size is 0.75 m). V-fold belts have a small footprint, low energy and wash water consumption and low capital and operating costs. They are self-tracking and can process sludge of varying composition, reducing operator involvement.&lt;ref name=VFold&gt;Young. D, Ochre. P, and Kuijvenhoven. K,  ''V-Fold Belt Dewatering Technology'', 31st Annual Qld Water Industry Workshop – Operations Skills, University Central Queensland 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''berry-picking rake''' or '''berry picker''' is a tool for collecting berries. Berry-picking rakes can be used to collect [[lingonberry|lingonberries]], [[bilberry|bilberries]], [[Ribes|currant]]s, and other berries. The rake may damage softer berries, and introduces some detritus, requiring cleaning of the berries afterwards. If misused, it may also damage or uproot the plants, reducing next year's yields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.silvafennica.fi/article/972 | title=Effects of picking methods on the berry production of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), lingonberry (V. vitis-idaea) and crowberry (Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum) in Northern Finland |author1=Manninen, Outi H. |author2=Peltola, Rainer | journal=Silva Fennica | year=2013 | volume=47 | issue=3 | pages=972 | doi=10.14214/sf.972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newsminer.com/berry-rakes-in-the-wrong-hands-can-be-destructive/article_b6e5973e-6bdc-589b-8c40-7b9b125864ca.html?mode=jqm | title=Berry rakes, in the wrong hands, can be destructive | work=Fairbanks Daily News-Miner | date=16 January 2013 | accessdate=26 August 2014 | author=Bellinger, Brookelyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these drawbacks, a rake has much greater efficiency than picking by hand, and is thus used in all commercial berry picking - though modern large-scale farms use mechanical harvesters.

The CSU/DSU implements two different functions. The  [[channel service unit]] (CSU) is responsible for the connection to the [[telecommunication]] network, while the [[data service unit]] (DSU)  is responsible for managing the interface with the DTE.

[[File:Freeze-dried bacon bars.jpg|thumb|Freeze-dried bacon bars that can be used as camping food]]
'''Backcountry camping food''' includes ingredients used to prepare food suitable for backcountry [[camping]] and [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]]. The foods differ substantially from the ingredients found in a typical home kitchen. The primary differences relate to campers' and backpackers' special needs for foods that have appropriate cooking time, perishability, weight, and nutritional content.
[[File:SpaceIceCream.jpg|thumb|right|A [[freeze-dried ice cream]] sandwich]]
To address these needs, camping food is often made up of either [[freeze-dried]], [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|precooked]] or [[dehydrated]] ingredients. Many campers use a combination of these foods.

== Meal and ingredient requirements ==
===Limited cooking time===
Due to the difficulty of carrying large amounts of cooking fuel, campers often require their meals to cook in a short amount of time (5–20 minutes). Many campers prefer a ‘just add boiling water’ method of cooking, while others enjoy a more involved, and therefore often higher quality meal. The amount of cooking time can be disregarded if campers are able to cook over a [[campfire]], however, due to the possibility of a burn-ban being in place, campers do not often rely on this option.

===Shelf-stability===
Camping foods are often [[shelf-stable]], that is, they require no refrigeration. Campers may be outdoors for days or weeks at a time, and will often pack food for the entire trip. Campers will sometimes take fresh food that can be consumed in the first day or two of a hike but will usually not risk carrying [[perishable]] food beyond that timeframe. Campers hiking in the snow or other cold conditions or campers with access to a cold water source may be able to store perishable food in the snow or secured in a bag and kept in the cold water to act as a refrigeration source.

===Lightweight===
Backpackers must carry everything with them so they require all of their gear and food to be as lightweight as possible. Campers often turn to freeze-dried and dehydrated meals and ingredients for this reason, but they will also sometimes take a pouch of tuna or some other ingredient with a high water content with them as a treat, providing that the item has nutritional value.

===Nutrition content===
Backpackers, [[canoeists]], [[climbing|climbers]] and other outdoor enthusiasts often cover many miles everyday, consuming thousands of calories to keep their energy level high. Backpackers require an average of 480 calories per hour&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.backpacker.com/november_2001_food_winter_calories/skills/3470?page=1 Backpacker Magazine's Winter Calorie Count]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as higher sodium levels. Because of the high levels of nutritional burn and emphasis on weight, backpackers monitor the ratio of calories-to-ounce that their food provides. To ensure their bodies are properly nourished, campers must pay close attention to their meal plans.

== Ingredients ==
To prepare meals that work well outdoors, campers employ a variety of techniques. All campers are advised to prepare meals that are made of easy to prepare ingredients.

===Freeze-dried ingredients===
[[File:Mountain house egg.jpg|thumb|right|Frozen dried eggs can be shelf stable for up to 25 years]]

[[Freeze-drying]] requires the use of heavy machinery and is not something that most campers are able to do on their own. Freeze-dried ingredients are often considered superior to dehydrated ingredients however, because they rehydrate at camp faster and retain more flavor than their dehydrated counterparts. Freeze-dried ingredients take so little time to rehydrate that they can often be eaten without cooking them first and have a texture similar to a crunchy chip.

Small amounts of freeze-dried ingredients are sometimes available for sale from emergency supply outlets or from stores specific to camping. Freeze-dried ingredients that have not been combined into a meal are often hard to find, however, and are often sought out by campers.

===Dehydrated meals &amp; ingredients===
[[food dehydration|Dehydration]] can reduce the weight of the food by sixty to ninety percent by removing water through evaporation. Some foods dehydrate well, such as onions, peppers, and tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wildernessdining.com/campingfood.html |title=Camping Food FAQs |work= |accessdate=2009-05-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402225612/http://www.wildernessdining.com/campingfood.html |archive-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlCamping Food Tips: Backpacking, Hiking &amp; Camping Meals Get Easy."&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hiking-gear-and-equipment-used-for-camping.com/camping-food.html |title=Camping Food Tips: Backpacking, Hiking &amp; Camping Meals Get Easy. |work= |accessdate=2009-05-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422213307/http://www.hiking-gear-and-equipment-used-for-camping.com/camping-food.html# |archive-date=2009-04-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dehydration often produces a more compact, albeit slightly heavier, end result than freeze-drying.

Full meals or individual ingredients may be dehydrated. Dehydration of individual ingredients allows the flexibility to cook different meals based on available ingredients, while precooked and dehydrated meals offer greater convenience.&lt;ref name="urlDrying Food"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aces.uiuc.edu/vista/html_pubs/DRYING/dryfood.html#methods |title=Drying Food |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1977 |format= |work=Circular 1227 |publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, College of Agriculture, Cooperative Extension Service |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several cookbooks and online grocery stores specialize in dehydrated foods. A Fork in the Trail and Another Fork in the Trail are both backcountry cookbooks that focus on dehydrating full meals.&lt;ref name="url A Fork in the Trail"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aforkinthetrail.com|title=A Fork in the Trail|format= |work= |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precooked foods===
[[File:MREsingleveggie.gif|thumb|left|50 px|MRE entree]]
[[File:MRE contents.jpg|thumb|right|Contents of a [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|MRE]] package]]
Surplus military Meals, [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|Meals, Ready-to-Eat]] (MREs) are sometimes used by campers. These meals contain precooked foods in [[retort pouch]]es. A retort pouch is a plastic and metal foil laminate pouch that is used as an alternative to traditional industrial [[canning]] methods.

===Common ingredients===
[[File:Instantnoodles.jpg|thumb|left|60 px|Uncooked instant ramen]]
The final type of ingredients available to campers are those that are typically found in the grocery store. Some examples of these types of food are [[polenta]], [[grits]], quick-cooking pasta (such as [[angel hair pasta]]), [[ramen]], instant potatoes, dried soups, jerky and pouch meats such as tuna, SPAM or salmon.

When using these common ingredients, campers often repackage them to reduce packaging or combine them into a meal-ready package, therefore reducing prep-time at camp. The main requirement that campers look for in these types of ingredients is the cook-time with 20 minutes being the longest amount of cook-time that most campers will tolerate.

== Backcountry cooking methods ==

===Camping stoves and cookware===
There is a large variety of [[camping stove]]s on the market ranging in specialty from being extremely lightweight to focusing on using very little fuel. The majority of campers rely on a stove for their cooking needs as they boast several advantages over cooking over a campfire. Since most camping stoves have an adjustable heat source, they can be much easier to use than a campfire. The ability to quickly adjust the flame to reduce your pot from a boil to a simmer, for example, is considered invaluable to many campers. Campfires can take a long time to start and get to a point where they are suitable for cooking over. Since a cook-stove can be ready in minutes, this is an advantage for many campers. Many types of cookware exist for outdoor cooking.

===Campfire===
[[Wilderness]] areas can often have a burn-ban, prohibiting people from starting a fire. If a camper were to rely on the campfire method as their only source for cooking heat, they could find themselves in an unlucky situation. Cooking over a campfire can lead to pots and pans darkened with [[soot]]. Soot can be extremely difficult to remove and, if left on the pan, can easily rub off onto clothing or the inside of the backpack. Campers have discovered methods of preventing this problem, such as coating the pans with [[cooking oil]], to make the soot easier to remove.

Campers relying on the use of a campfire do not have to carry the extra weight of a cook stove and may rely on a campfire to reduce their pack weight.  Campfires provide a great amount of warmth while cook stoves provide none. On cold days, a campfire is often welcome. [[Leave No Trace]] discourages the use of a campfire as a source of heat. Campers making a campfire in the same location time after time can deplete the available wood in the area, which impacts the natural habitat of the animals. Campers are also more likely to inadvertently leave food scraps around the fire pit, which could attract animals.

===Chemical heaters===
Some camping food is ready to eat and may be warmed using chemical heaters, such as the [[Flameless ration heater|flameless heaters]] used in MREs, or a self-contained chemical heater built into the food packaging itself.&lt;ref name="Heater Meals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campingsurvival.com/heatermeals.html|title=Heater Meals|publisher=Camping Survival|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar cooking===
[[Solar cooking]] provides clean and safe alternative to campfire. Using solar cookers is easy and inexpensive since they do not require fuel to work.
Most solar cookers also provide minimum required temperature during cloudy days to prepare the food. Despite many advantages that solar cooking provides it is unusable during the nighttime and it will not provide heat and protection against wild animals like campfire does.

{{mergeto|RF modulator|date=October 2018}}
A '''channel 3/4 output''' was a common output selection for consumer audiovisual devices sold in [[North America]] that were intended to be connected to a [[television|TV]] using a [[radio frequency]] (RF) signal. This channel option was provided because it was rare to have [[terrestrial television|broadcast channel]]s 3 and 4 used in the same market, or even just channel 3 itself. The choice allowed the user to select the unused channel in their area so that the connected device would be able to provide video and audio on an RF feed to the television without excessive interference from a broadcast signal.

[[RF modulation]] was common on equipment deployed in North America. Other countries had the RF output for video equipment on different groups of frequencies. For example, equipment sold in Europe, South Africa and Hong Kong used UHF channels 30–39 for this purpose. Equipment sold in Japan used channel 1 or 2 (Channel 13–16 is for cable converters). With other channels being used for RF modulation function in other regions, channel 3/4 output is a misnomer for those regions.

In Australia, some manufacturers used the channel 3/4 output, while other manufacturers would use the [[UHF]] channels 30–36 for this purpose. It become common for VCRs sold in that market since the mid-1990s to use this output specification as well. The other common output frequency set in Australia was channel 0 and 1 on the [[VHF]] band throughout the 1980s. This was because most televisions that were deployed on the Australian market before model-year 1980 could not receive the UHF band.For years, the RF output for video recorders marketed for Australia used channel 0 or 1 on VHF bandwidth and these two channels were not usual on TV sets marketed for Asia/ Middle East,except for Sony Trinitron KV-2062E ( Asia model )which had the capability of receiving any frequency below channel E2. The S-VHS video recorder,HR-S6800EA made by JVC in 1992,was a model made for Australia and in terms of RF output it used VHF channel 0 or 1. In New Zealand,video recorders had RF output on either VHF channel 2 or 3 ( PAL B ).

Since 1982, VHS video recorders and VHS players ( 1984 onwards ) marketed typically for South and South-East Asia, featured RF output on PAL system, standard B, using VHF channel 3 or 4. Some models of course, featured output on PAL G using UHF channels 36 to 38.Usually these models were not recommended for use in Australia. VHS recorders made for Asia/ Middle East normally featured RF output on UHF channel E36 or E37 or even E38,and some decks offered selection between PAL and SECAM systems.

It also is common to have this type of RF output on [[video cassette recorder]]s (VCRs), early [[DVD]] players and [[video game consoles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tanny|first1=David|title=Memories of Analog TV: The 90s and 00s|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/weblogs/san-diego-radio-views/2009/apr/22/memories-of-analog-tv-the-90s-and-00s/#|accessdate=December 29, 2016|work=San Diego Reader|date=April 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gaming&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henry|first1=Alan|title=How to Connect Your Old School Video Game Consoles to a New TV|url=http://lifehacker.com/how-to-connect-your-old-school-video-game-consoles-to-a-1443675453|accessdate=December 29, 2016|work=Lifehacker|date=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The VCR's ubiquity was responsible for making consumers familiar with RF modulation, which could explain its lasting popularity and use in all-digital media like DVD and video game consoles. A better explanation might be its familiarity and ease of use, along with [[legacy system|legacy]] televisions, which could not readily support newer technologies like [[Composite video|composite]] or [[S-video]].

DVD's relatively later entrance to the marketplace means that most players after the early generations do not natively support RF modulation, instead relying on converters, which could also amplify the signal.

[[History of video game consoles (first generation)|First]]- through early [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|fifth-generation]] video game consoles commonly used this method to connect to the television, which was used as the audio and video device for the game, with some variations (the [[Atari 2600]], for example, used a Channel 2/3 output switch). In many cases, an RF modulator was used to take the composite output from the game and modulate it before sending the signal to the television. Late fifth- through current [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|eighth-generation]] video game consoles retain the ability to output through RF modulators, usually through a separately purchased adapter.  Recently, some RF demodulators have been marketed on obscure online markets to allow channel 3 inputs from legacy devices to work on RCA composite in.&lt;ref name=Gaming/&gt;

'''Chemical looping combustion''' ('''CLC''') is a technological process typically employing a dual [[fluidized bed]] system. The CLC operated with an interconnected moving bed with a fluidized bed system has also been employed as a technology process. In CLC, a metal oxide is employed as a bed material providing the oxygen for combustion in the [[Fluidized bed combustion|fuel reactor]]. The reduced metal is then transferred to the second bed ([[Fluidized bed reactor|air reactor]]) and re-oxidized before being reintroduced back to the fuel reactor completing the loop. Fig 1 shows a simplified diagram of the CLC process. Fig 2 shows an example of a dual fluidized bed circulating reactor system and a moving bed-fluidized bed circulating reactor system.

Isolation of the fuel from [[air]] simplifies the number of [[chemical reaction]]s in [[combustion]]. Employing [[oxygen]] without [[nitrogen]] and the trace gases found in air eliminates the primary source for the formation of [[nitrogen oxide]] ({{NOx}}), produces a [[flue gas]] composed primarily of [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water vapor]]; other trace [[pollutants]] depend on the [[fuel]] selected.

== Description ==
Chemical looping combustion (CLC) uses two or more reactions to perform the oxidation of hydrocarbon based fuels. In its simplest form, an oxygen carrying species (normally a metal) is first oxidized in air forming an oxide. This oxide is then reduced using a hydrocarbon as reducer in a second reaction. As an example, a [[iron]] based system burning pure carbon would involve the two [[redox]] reactions:

{{NumBlk|:|C(s) + {{chem|Fe|2|O|3}}(s) → {{chem|Fe|3|O|4}}(s) + {{chem|CO|2}}(g)|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

{{NumBlk|:|{{chem|Fe|3|O|4}}(s) + {{O2}}(g)  → {{chem|Fe|2|O|3}}(s)|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

If ({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|2}}) are added together, the reaction set reduces to straight carbon oxidation i.e.:

{{NumBlk|:|C(s) + {{chem|O|2}}(g)  → {{CO2}}(g)|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
CLC was first studied as a way to produce {{CO2|link=yes}} from fossil fuels, using two interconnected fluidized beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Lewis, W., Gilliland, E. and Sweeney, M. |title= Gasification of carbon | journal= Chemical Engineering Progress |year=1951|volume=47|pages=251–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later it was proposed as a system for increasing power station efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Richter, H.J.  |author2=Knoche, K.F. | title=Reversibility of combustion processes, in Efficiency and Costing – Second law analysis of processes.| year=1983 | series=ACS symposium series| issue=235 |pages=71–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gain in efficiency is possible due to the enhanced reversibility of the two redox reactions; in traditional single stage combustion, the release of a fuel’s energy occurs in a highly irreversible manner - departing considerably from equilibrium. In CLC, if an appropriate oxygen carrier is chosen, both redox reactions can be made to occur almost reversibly and at relatively low temperatures. Theoretically, this allows a power station using CLC to approach the ideal work output for an internal combustion engine without exposing components to excessive working temperatures.

=== Thermodynamics ===
[[Image:CLC MCG.png|thumb|364x364px|right|Fig 3. Sankey diagram of energy fluxes in a reversible CLC system.]]Fig 3 illustrates the energy exchanges in a CLC system graphically, and shows a [[Sankey diagram]] of the energy fluxes occurring in a reversible CLC based engine. Studying Fig 1, a [[heat engine]] is arranged to receive heat at high temperature from the [[exothermic]] oxidation reaction. After converting part of this energy to work, the heat engine rejects the remaining energy as heat. Almost all of this heat rejection can be absorbed by the [[endothermic]] reduction reaction occurring in the reducer. This arrangement requires the redox reactions to be exothermic and endothermic respectively, but this is normally the case for most metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1205/cherd05020|author=Jerndal, E., Mattisson, T. and Lyngfelt, A.|title=Thermal analysis of chemical-looping combustion|journal=Trans IChemE, Part a Chem. Eng. Res. And Des.|year=2006|volume=84|pages=795–806}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some additional heat exchange with the environment is required to satisfy the [[second law of thermodynamics|second law]]; theoretically, for a reversible process, the heat exchange is related to the standard state entropy change, ΔS&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;, of the primary hydrocarbon oxidation reaction as follows:

:Q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; = T&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;ΔS&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;

However, for most hydrocarbons, ΔS&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; is a small value and, as a result, an engine of high overall efficiency is theoretically possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1243/09544062JMES790| author=McGlashan, N.R.|title=Chemical looping combustion – a thermodynamic study|journal=Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng. C|year=2008|volume=222|pages=1005–1019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture ===
Although proposed as a means of increasing efficiency, in recent years, interest has been shown in CLC as a [[carbon capture]] technique.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/663464865|title=Chemical looping systems for fossil energy conversions|last=Liang-Shih.|first=Fan,|date=2010|publisher=Wiley-AIChE|isbn=9780470872888|location=Hoboken, NJ|oclc=663464865}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fan|first=Liang-Shih|last2=Zeng|first2=Liang|last3=Wang|first3=William|last4=Luo|first4=Siwei|date=2012|title=Chemical looping processes for CO2 capture and carbonaceous fuel conversion – prospect and opportunity|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2012/EE/c2ee03198a|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|language=en|volume=5|issue=6|pages=7254|doi=10.1039/c2ee03198a|issn=1754-5692}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon capture is facilitated by CLC because the two redox reactions generate two intrinsically separated flue gas streams: a stream from the air reactor, consisting of atmospheric {{chem|N|2}} and residual {{chem|O|2}}, but sensibly free of {{CO2}}; and a stream from the fuel reactor predominately containing {{CO2}} and {{chem|H|2|O}} with very little diluent nitrogen. The air reactor flue gas can be discharged to the atmosphere causing minimal {{CO2}} pollution. The reducer exit gas contains almost all of the {{CO2}} generated by the system and CLC therefore can be said to exhibit 'inherent carbon capture', as water vapor can easily be removed from the second flue gas via condensation, leading to a stream of almost pure {{CO2}}. This gives CLC clear benefits when compared with competing carbon capture technologies, as the latter generally involve a significant energy penalty associated with either post combustion scrubbing systems or the work input required for air separation plants. This has led to CLC being proposed as an energy efficient carbon capture technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/S0196-8904(96)00267-1|author1=Ishida, M. |author2=Jin, N.| title={{CO2}} Recovery in a power plant with chemical looping combustion | journal=Energy Conv.

=== Technology development ===
First operation of chemical-looping combustion with gaseous fuels was demonstrated in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Lyngfelt, A. |title= A New Combustion Technology | journal= Greenhouse Gas Issues |year=2004 |volume=No.73|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later with solid fuels in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Lyngfelt, A. |title= Chemical-looping combustion of solid fuels | journal= Greenhouse Gas Issues |year=2007|volume=No. 85|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total operational experience in 34 pilots of 0.3 to 3 MW is more than 9000 h.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Lyngfelt, A. |title= Oxygen carriers for chemical-looping combustion - 4000 h of operational experience | journal= Oil &amp; Gas Science and Technology |year=2011|volume=66:2|pages=161–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyngfelt|first=A|last2=Linderholm|first2=C|title=Chemical-Looping Combustion of Solid Fuels – status and recent progress|journal=13th International Conference on Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies, GHGT-13, 14–18 November 2016, Lausanne, Switzerland|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tong|first=Andrew|last2=Bayham|first2=Samuel|last3=Kathe|first3=Mandar V.|last4=Zeng|first4=Liang|last5=Luo|first5=Siwei|last6=Fan|first6=Liang-Shih|date=January 2014|title=Iron-based syngas chemical looping process and coal-direct chemical looping process development at Ohio State University|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S030626191300425X|journal=Applied Energy|volume=113|pages=1836–1845|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.05.024|issn=0306-2619|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxygen carrier materials used in operation include monometallic oxides of nickel, copper, manganese and iron, as well as various combined oxides including manganese oxides.combined with calcium, iron and silica. Also natural ores have been in use, especially for solid fuels, including iron ores, manganese ores and ilmenite.

=== Cost and energy penalty ===
A detailed technology assessment of chemical-looping combustion of solid fuel, i.e. coal, for a 1000 MW&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; power plant shows that the added CLC reactor costs as compared to a normal circulating fluidized bed boiler are small, because of the similarities of the technologies. Major costs are instead CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compression, needed in all CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture technologies, and oxygen production. Molecular oxygen production may also be needed in certain CLC configuration for polishing the product gas from the fuel reactor. In all the added costs were estimated to 20 €/tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; whereas the energy penalty was 4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyngfelt|first=Anders|last2=Leckner|first2=Bo|date=2015-11-01|title=A 1000 MWth boiler for chemical-looping combustion of solid fuels – Discussion of design and costs|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030626191500519X|journal=Applied Energy|volume=157|pages=475–487|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.04.057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Variants and related technologies ===
A variant of CLC is Chemical-Looping Combustion with Oxygen Uncoupling (CLOU) where an oxygen carrier is used that releases gas-phase oxygen in the fuel reactor, e.g. CuO/{{chem|Cu|2}}O.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Mattisson, T., Lyngfelt, A. and Leion, H. |title= Chemical-Looping with Oxygen Uncoupling for Combustion of Solid Fuels | journal= International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control |year=2009|volume=3|pages=11–19 |doi=10.1016/j.ijggc.2008.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is helpful for achieving high gas conversion, and especially when using solid fuels, where slow steam gasification of char can be avoided. CLOU operation with solid fuels shows high performance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Abad, A., Adánez-Rubio, I. Gayán, P. García-Labiano, F. de Diego L. F. and Adánez, J.  |title= Demonstration of chemical-looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU) process in a 1.5kW th continuously operating unit using a Cu-based oxygen-carrier | journal= International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control |year=2012|volume=6|pages=189–200 |doi=10.1016/j.ijggc.2011.10.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Continuous regime of chemical-looping combustion (CLC) and chemical-looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU) reactivity of CuO oxygen carriers|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926337314006870|journal = Applied Catalysis B: Environmental|date = 2015-05-01|pages = 132–144|volume = 166–167|doi = 10.1016/j.apcatb.2014.10.067|first = Zhiquan|last = Zhou|first2 = Lu|last2 = Han|first3 = Oscar|last3 = Nordness|first4 = George M.|last4 = Bollas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical Looping can also be used to produce hydrogen in [[Chemical looping reforming and gasification|Chemical-Looping Reforming]] (CLR) processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rydén, M.  |author2=Lyngfelt, A., |title= Using steam reforming to produce hydrogen with carbon dioxide capture by chemical-looping combustion | journal= Journal of Hydrogen Energy |year=2006|volume=31|pages=1631–1641}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rydén, M. |author2=Lyngfelt, A. |author3=Mattisson, T. |last-author-amp=yes|title= Synthesis gas generation by chemical-looping reforming in a continuously operating laboratory reactor | journal=Fuel |year=2006|volume=85|pages=1631–1641 |doi=10.1016/j.fuel.2006.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one configuration of the CLR process, hydrogen is produced from coal and/or natural gas using a moving bed fuel reactor integrated with a steam reactor and a fluidized bed air reactor. This configuration of CLR can produce greater than 99% purity H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; without the need for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tong|first=Andrew|last2=Sridhar|first2=Deepak|last3=Sun|first3=Zhenchao|last4=Kim|first4=Hyung R.|last5=Zeng|first5=Liang|last6=Wang|first6=Fei|last7=Wang|first7=Dawei|last8=Kathe|first8=Mandar V.|last9=Luo|first9=Siwei|date=January 2013|title=Continuous high purity hydrogen generation from a syngas chemical looping 25kWth sub-pilot unit with 100% carbon capture|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016236112005170|journal=Fuel|volume=103|pages=495–505|doi=10.1016/j.fuel.2012.06.088|issn=0016-2361|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comprehensive overviews of the field are given in recent reviews on chemical looping technologies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyngfelt, A. and Mattisson, T. (2011) ”Materials for chemical-looping combustion”, in D. Stolten and V. Scherer, Efficient Carbon Capture for Coal Power Plants, Weinheim, WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.. KGaA, 475-504.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Adánez, J. |author2=Abad, A. Garcia-Labiano |author3=F. Gayan P. |author4=de Diego, L. |last-author-amp=yes|title= Progress in Chemical-Looping Combustion and Reforming technologies' | journal= Progress in Energy and Combustion Science |year=2012|volume=38|pages=215–282 |doi=10.1016/j.pecs.2011.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary CLC can achieve both an increase in power station efficiency simultaneously with low energy penalty carbon capture.  Challenges with CLC include operation of dual fluidized bed (maintaining carrier fluidization while avoiding crushing and attrition), and maintaining carrier stability over many cycles.

A '''data model''' in [[geographic information system]]s is a mathematical construct for representing geographic objects or surfaces as data. For example, the [[vector graphics|vector]] data model represents geography as collections of points, lines, and polygons; the [[raster graphics|raster]] data model represent geography as cell matrices that store numeric values; and the [[Triangulated irregular network|TIN]] data model represents geography as sets of contiguous, nonoverlapping triangles.&lt;ref&gt;Wade, T. and Sommer, S. eds. ''[http://store.esri.com/esri/showdetl.cfm?SID=2&amp;Product_ID=868&amp;Category_ID=49 A to Z GIS]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representing three-dimensional map information==
There are two approaches for representing three-dimensional map information, and for managing it in the [[data model]].&lt;ref name= "DRS03"/&gt; 
[[Image:Representing three-dimensional map information.jpg|thumb|420px|Approaches for representing three-dimensional map information, and for managing it in the data model.&lt;ref name= "DRS03"&gt;David R. Soller1 and Thomas M. Berg (2003). [http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2003/of03-471/soller1/index.html The National Geologic Map Database Project: Overview and Progress] U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 03–471.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Vector-based stack-unit===
Vector-based stack-unit maps depict the vertical succession of geologic units to a specified depth (here, the base of the [[block diagram]]). This mapping approach characterizes the vertical variations of physical properties in each 3-D map unit. In this example, an alluvial deposit (unit “a”) overlies glacial till (unit “t”), and the stack-unit labeled “a/t” indicates that relationship, whereas the unit “t” indicates that glacial till extends down to the specified depth. In a manner similar to that shown in figure 11, the stack-unit’s occurrence (the map unit’s outcrop), geometry (the map unit’s boundaries), and descriptors (the physical properties of the geologic units included in the stack-unit) are managed as they are for a typical 2-D geologic map.&lt;ref name= "DRS03"/&gt;

===Raster-based stacked surfaces===
Raster-based stacked surfaces depict the surface of each buried geologic unit, and can accommodate data on lateral variations of physical properties. In this example from Soller and others (1999),&lt;ref&gt;D.R. Soller et al. (1999). "inclusion of digital map products in the National Geologic Map Database". In Soller, D.R., ed., ''Digital Mapping Techniques ‘99—Workshop Proceedings:''. U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 99-386, p. 35–38,&lt;/ref&gt; the upper surface of each buried geologic unit was represented in raster format as an ArcInfo Grid file. The middle grid is the uppermost surface of an economically important aquifer, the Mahomet Sand, which fills a pre- and inter-glacial valley carved into the bedrock surface. Each geologic unit in raster format can be managed in the data model, in a manner not dissimilar from that shown for the stack-unit map. The Mahomet Sand is continuous in this area, and represents one occurrence of this unit in the data model. Each raster, or pixel, on the Mahomet Sand surface has a set of map coordinates that are recorded in a GIS (in the data model bin that is labeled “Pixel coordinates”, which is the raster corollary of the “Geometry” bin for vector map data). Each pixel can have a unique set of descriptive information, such as surface elevation, unit thickness, [[lithology]], transmissivity, etc.).

'''E-agriculture''' (sometimes written '''eagriculture''' or referred to as '''[[Information and communications technology in agriculture|ICT in agriculture]]''') is a relatively recent term in the field of agriculture and rural development practices. Consistency in the use of this term began to materialize with the dissemination of results from a global survey carried out by the United Nations (UN). This survey conducted in late 2006 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) found that half of those who replied identified "e agriculture" with information dissemination, access and exchange, communication and participation processes improvements around rural development. In contrast, less than a third highlighted the importance of technical hardware and technological tools.

E-agriculture, therefore, describes an emerging field focused on the enhancement of agricultural and rural development through improved information and communication processes.  More specifically, e-agriculture involves the conceptualization, design, development, evaluation and application of innovative ways to use information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the rural domain, with a primary focus on agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-agriculture.org/about.html e-Agriculture Community of Practice]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the United Nations referred to e-agriculture as "an emerging field",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mangstl, A.|title=Emerging Issues, Priorities and Commitments in e-Agriculture|journal=AgInfo Worldwide|volume=1|number=1|year=2008|url= http://journals.sfu.ca/iaald/index.php/aginfo/article/view/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the expectation that its scope would change and evolve as our understanding of the area grows.

Many ICT in agriculture or e-agriculture interventions have been developed and tested around the world, with varied degrees of success, to help agriculturists improve their livelihoods through increased agricultural productivity and incomes, and reduction in risks. Some useful resources for learning about e-agriculture in practice are the World Bank’s e-sourcebook ICT in agriculture – connecting smallholder farmers to knowledge, networks and institutions (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ictinagriculture.org/|title=World Bank’s e-sourcebook ICT in agriculture – connecting smallholder farmers to knowledge, networks and institutions (2011)|date=20 May 2015|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=9 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320081526/http://www.ictinagriculture.org/|archivedate=20 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICT uses for inclusive value chains (2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/aq078e/aq078e.pdf|title=ICT uses for inclusive value chains (2013)|date=20 May 2015|publisher=FAO|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICT uses for inclusive value chains (2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/i3557e/i3557e.pdf|title=Information and communication technologies for sustainable agriculture (2013)|date=20 May 2015|publisher=FAO|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Success stories on information and communication technologies for agriculture and rural development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4622e.pdf|title=Success stories on information and communication technologies for agriculture and rural development|date=20 May 2015|publisher=FAO|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; have documented many cases of use of ICT in agriculture.

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]]-[[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] E-agriculture Strategy Guide&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/publications/card/en/c/24f624ea-7891-45e8-9b24-66cbf13f004d/ E-agriculture Strategy Guide] &lt;/ref&gt; provides a framework to holistically address the ICT opportunities and challenges for the agricultural sector in a more efficient manner while generating new revenue streams and improve the livelihoods of the rural community as well as ensure the goals of the national agriculture master plan are achieved.The existence of e-agriculture strategy and its alignment with other government plans will prevent e-agriculture projects and services from being implemented in isolation.

The FAO-ITU E-agriculture Strategy Guide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5564e.pdf|title=FAO-ITU E-agriculture Strategy Guide|date=20 May 2016|publisher=FAO|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)]&lt;/ref&gt; and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int International Telecommunication Union (ITU)]&lt;/ref&gt; with support from partners including the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cta.int Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA)]&lt;/ref&gt; as a framework for countries in developing their national e-agriculture strategy/masterplan.

Some of the countries who are using the FAO-ITU E-agriculture Strategy Guide to develop their national e-agriculture strategy are [[Bhutan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Philippines]], [[Fiji]] and [[Vanuatu]]. The guide provides a framework to engage a broader stakeholders in the development of national e-agriculture strategy.

==History==

=== ICT in support of rural poverty elimination and food security ===
In August 2003, the [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI), the UK Department for International Development ([[DFID]]) and the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization ([[FAO]]) joined together in a collaborative research project to look at bringing together livelihoods thinking with concepts from information and communication for development, in order to improve understanding of the role and importance of information and communication in support of rural livelihoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/download/164.pdf | title=Livelihoods Approaches to Information and Communication in Support of Rural Poverty Elimination and Food Security | publisher=Overseas Development Institute | accessdate=September 25, 2016 | author=Robert Chapman|author2=Tom Slaymaker|author3=John Young}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy recommendations included:
* Building on existing systems, while encouraging integration of different technologies and information sharing
* Determining who should pay, through consensus and based on a thorough analysis of the costs
* Ensuring equitable access to marginalised groups and those in the agricultural sector
* Promoting localised content, with decentralised and locally owned processes
* Building capacity, through provision of training packages and maintaining a choice of information sources
* Using realistic technologies, that are suitable within the existing infrastructure
* Building knowledge partnerships to ensure that knowledge gaps are filled and a two-way flow of information allows knowledge to originate from all levels of the network and community.

The importance of ICT is also recognized in the 8th Millennium Development Goal, with the target to "...make available the benefits of new technologies, especially information and communications technologies (ICTs)" to the fight against poverty.

===WSIS process===
E-agriculture is one of the action lines identified in the declaration and plan of action  (2003) of the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs/geneva/official/poa.html|title=WSIS: Plan of Action|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Tunis Agenda for the Information Society", published on 18 November 2005, emphasizes the leading facilitating roles that UN agencies need to play in the implementation of the Geneva Plan of Action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs2/tunis/off/6rev1.html|title=WSIS: Tunis Agenda for the Information Society|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FAO hosted the first e-agriculture workshop in June 2006, bringing together representatives of leading development organizations involved in agriculture. The meeting served to initiate development of an effective process to engage as wide a range of stakeholders involved in e-agriculture, and resulted in the formation of the e-Agriculture Community, a [[community of practice]]. The e-Agriculture Community's Founding Partners &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-agriculture.org/founding-partners|title=Partners - E-Agriculture|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; include: Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research ([[CGIAR]]); Technical Centre for Agriculture and Rural Development ([[Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU (CTA)|CTA]]); FAO; Global Alliance for Information and Communication Technologies and Development ([[GAID]]); Global Forum on Agricultural Research ([[GFAR]]); Global Knowledge Partnership (GKP); Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (now called [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit]], GIZ); International Association of Agricultural Information Specialists (IAALD); Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA); International Fund for Agricultural Development ([[IFAD]]); International Centre for Communication for Development ([[International Institute for Communication and Development|IICD]]); United States [[National Agricultural Library]] (NAL); United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs ([[UNDESA]]); the [[World Bank]].

[[File:Electric feed rocket cycle.svg|thumb|right|250px|Electric-feed rocket cycle. The oxidizer and fuel are fed to the pump which increases the pressure before injecting it into the combustion chamber. The pumps are actuated by an electric motor powered by batteries. An inverter converts the batteries' DC electricity to the AC needed by the motor. The fuel is also circulated around the outside of the combustion chamber and nozzle to prevent them overheating.]]

The '''electric-pump-fed engine''' is a [[bipropellant rocket]] [[rocket engine|engine]] in which the fuel pumps are electrically powered, and so all of the input propellant is directly burned in the main combustion chamber, and none is diverted to drive the pumps. This differs from traditional rocket engine designs, in which the pumps are driven by a portion of the input propellants.

An electric cycle engine uses electric [[pump]]s to pressurize the propellants from a low-pressure fuel tank to high-pressure [[Rocket engine#Combustion chamber|combustion chamber]] levels, generally from {{convert|0.2|to|0.3|MPa|abbr=on}} to {{convert|10|to|20|MPa|abbr=on}}. The pumps are powered by an [[electric motor]], with electricity from a battery bank.

As of January 2018, the only rocket engines to use electric [[Liquid-propellant rocket|propellant]] pump systems are the [[Rutherford (rocket engine)|Rutherford]] engine&lt;ref name=rocketlabs-propulsion20160919 /&gt;, nine of which power the [[Electron (rocket)|Electron]] rocket&lt;ref name=rocketlabs-propulsion20160919 /&gt;, and the electric pump-fed rocket engine used in sounding rockets developed by [[Ventions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ventions.com/menu/|title=Technologies|website=Ventions|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 January 2018, Electron was the first electric pump-fed rocket to reach orbit.&lt;ref name=nzh20180121&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11979201 |title=Blast off! Rocket Lab successfully reaches orbit |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |last=Ryan |first=Holly |date=21 January 2018 |access-date=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to turbo-pumped rocket cycles such as [[Staged combustion cycle|staged combustion]] and [[Gas-generator cycle|gas generator]], an electric cycle engine has potentially worse performance due to the added mass of batteries, but may have lower development and manufacturing costs due its mechanical simplicity, its lack of high temperature turbomachinery, and its easier controllability&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aacademica.org/hernan.emilio.tacca/9.pdf|title=Electric feed systems for liquid propellant rocket engines|last=Rachov|first=Pablo|date=2010|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121184414/https://www.aacademica.org/hernan.emilio.tacca/9.pdf|archive-date=2018-01-21|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Conversely, an electric cycle engine may have significantly better performance than [[Pressure-fed engine (rocket)|pressure-fed rocket engines]] and [[Solid-propellant_rocket|solid propellant rocket motors]].

[[File:EIS Sensor.svg|thumb|Principle of EIS sensor]]
An '''Electrolyte–insulator–semiconductor (EIS) sensor''' is a [[sensor]] that is made of these three components:

* an [[electrolyte]] with the chemical that should be measured
* an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] that allows field-effect interaction, without leak currents between the two other components
* a [[semiconductor]] to register the chemical changes

The EIS sensor can be used in combination with other structures, for example to construct a [[light-addressable potentiometric sensor]] (LAPS).

'''Facial toning''', or '''facial exercise''' is a type of [[Beauty|cosmetic]] procedure or [[physical therapy]] tool which promises to alter facial contours by means of increasing [[muscle tone]], and facial volume by promoting muscular [[Organ hypertrophy|hypertrophy]], and preventing [[muscle loss]] due to [[aging]] or [[facial paralysis]].  Facial toning and exercise is therefore in part a technique to achieve [[facial rejuvenation]] by reducing [[wrinkle]]s, sagging and expression marks on the [[face]] and [[skin]].&lt;ref&gt;Freilinger G, Gruber H, Happak W, Pechmann U.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[physical therapy]], facial toning is used for victims of stroke and forms of facial paralysis such as [[Bell’s palsy]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Facial toning achieves this by performing facial muscle [[physical exercise|exercising]]. There are two types of facial toning exercises: active and passive face exercises.

==Exercises ==
Face exercises involves repeated voluntary contractions of certain facial muscle groups. The effectiveness of these facial toning techniques in improving appearance is scientifically unproven.

==Passive exercises ==
Passive exercising by direct skeletal muscle [[Electrical muscle stimulation|electrostimulation]]. In this, flat metal [[electrode]]s with a conductive gel are affixed to certain points in the face and electrostimulation causes facial muscle contractions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22202">Mixtures of dispersed combustible materials (such as gaseous or vaporised fuels, and some dusts) and air will burn only if the fuel concentration lies within well-defined lower and upper bounds determined experimentally, referred to as '''flammability limits''' or '''explosive limits'''. Combustion can range in violence from deflagration through detonation.

Limits vary with temperature and pressure, but are normally expressed in terms of volume percentage at 25&amp;nbsp;°C and atmospheric pressure. These limits are relevant both to producing and optimising explosion or combustion, as in an engine, or to preventing it, as in uncontrolled explosions of build-ups of combustible gas or dust. Attaining the best combustible or explosive mixture of a fuel and air (the [[stoichiometric]] proportion) is important in [[internal combustion engine]]s such as [[Petrol engine|gasoline]] or [[diesel engine]]s.

The standard reference work is that by [[Zabetakis]] using an apparatus developed by the [[United States Bureau of Mines]].

==Violence of combustion==
Combustion can vary in degree of violence. A [[deflagration]] is a propagation of a combustion zone at a velocity less than the speed of sound in the unreacted medium. A [[detonation]] is a propagation of a combustion zone at a velocity greater than the speed of sound in the unreacted medium. An [[explosion]] is the bursting or rupture of an enclosure or container due to the development of internal pressure from a deflagration or detonation as defined in [[National Fire Protection Association|NFPA]] 69.

==Limits==

===Lower flammability limit===
'''Lower flammability limit''' (LFL): The lowest concentration (percentage) of a gas or a vapor in air capable of producing a flash of fire in presence of an ignition source (arc, flame, heat). The term is considered by many safety professionals to be the same as the lower explosive level (LEL). At a concentration in air lower than the LFL, gas mixtures are "too lean" to burn. 
Methane gas has an LFL of 5.0%. If the atmosphere has less than 5.0% methane, an explosion cannot occur even if a source of ignition is present. From the health and safety perspective, the LEL concentration is considered to be [[Immediately dangerous to life or health|Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH),]] where a more stringent exposure limit does not exist for the flammable gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2014-100/pdfs/2014-100.pdf|title=Current Intelligence Bulletin #66: Derivation of Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH) Values|last=|first=|date=November 2013|website=The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Percentage reading on combustible air monitors should not be confused with the LFL concentrations. [[Explosimeter]]s designed and calibrated to a specific gas may show the relative concentration of the atmosphere to the LFL—the LFL being 100%. A 5% displayed LFL reading for methane, for example, would be equivalent to 5% multiplied by 5.0%, or approximately 0.25% methane by volume at 20 degrees C. Control of the explosion hazard is usually achieved by sufficient natural or mechanical ventilation, to limit the concentration of flammable gases or vapors to a maximum level of 25% of their ''lower explosive or flammable limit''.

===Upper flammability limit===
'''Upper flammability limit''' (UFL): Highest concentration (percentage) of a gas or a vapor in air capable of producing a flash of fire in presence of an ignition source (arc, flame, heat). Concentrations higher than UFL or UEL are "too rich" to burn. Operating above the UFL is usually avoided for safety because air leaking in can bring the mixture into combustibility range.

===Influence of temperature, pressure and composition===
Flammability limits of mixtures of several combustible gases can be calculated using [[Henri Louis Le Chatelier|Le Chatelier's]] mixing rule for combustible volume fractions &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;LFL_{\text{mix}}=\frac{1}{\sum_i \frac{x_{i}}{LFL_{i}}}&lt;/math&gt;

and similar for UFL.

[[Temperature]], [[pressure]], and the concentration of the oxidizer also influences flammability limits. Higher temperature or pressure, as well as higher concentration of the oxidizer (primarily oxygen in air), results in lower LFL and higher UFL, hence the gas mixture will be easier to explode. The effect of pressure is very small at pressures below 10 [[bar (unit)|millibar]] and difficult to predict, since it has only been studied in internal combustion engines with a [[turbocharger]].

Usually atmospheric air supplies the oxygen for combustion, and limits assume the normal concentration of oxygen in air. Oxygen-enriched atmospheres enhance combustion, lowering the LFL and increasing the UFL, and vice versa; an atmosphere devoid of an oxidizer is neither flammable nor explosive for any fuel concentration. Significantly increasing the fraction of inert gases in an air mixture, at the expense of oxygen, increases the LFL and decreases the UFL.

==Controlling explosive atmospheres==

===Gas and vapor===
Controlling gas and vapor concentrations outside the flammable limits is a major consideration in [[occupational safety and health]]. Methods used to control the concentration of a potentially explosive gas or vapor include use of sweep gas, an unreactive gas such as [[nitrogen]] or [[argon]] to dilute the explosive gas before coming in contact with air. Use of scrubbers or [[adsorption]] resins to remove explosive gases before release are also common. Gases can also be maintained safely at concentrations above the UEL, although a breach in the storage container can lead to explosive conditions or intense [[fire]]s.

===Dusts===
Dusts also have upper and lower explosion limits, though the upper limits are hard to measure and of little practical importance. Lower flammability limits for many organic materials are in the range of 10&amp;ndash;50&amp;nbsp;g/m³, which is much higher than the limits set for health reasons, as is the case for the LEL of many gases and vapours. Dust clouds of this concentration are hard to see through for more than a short distance, and normally only exist inside process equipment.

Flammability limits also depend on the particle size of the dust involved, and are not intrinsic properties of the material. In addition, a concentration above the LEL can be created suddenly from settled dust accumulations, so management by routine monitoring, as is done with gases and vapours, is of no value. The preferred method of managing combustible dust is by preventing accumulations of settled dust through process enclosure, ventilation, and surface cleaning. However, lower flammability limits may be relevant to plant design.

===Volatile liquids===
Situations caused by evaporation of flammable liquids into the air-filled void volume of a container may be limited by flexible container volume or by using an immicsible fluid to fill the void volume. [[Hydraulic tanker]]s use displacement of water when filling a tank with petroleum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morrell |first=Robert W. |authorlink = |title =Oil Tankers |publisher =Simmons-Boardman Publishing Company |volume = |edition =Second |date =1931 |location =New York |pages =305&amp;306 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The flammable/explosive limits of some gases and vapors are given below. Concentrations are given in percent by volume of air.
*Class IA liquids with a [[flash point]] less than {{convert|73|F|C}} and [[boiling point]] less than {{convert|100|°F|C}} have a [[NFPA 704]] flammability rating of 4
*Class IB liquids with a flash point less than {{convert|73|F|C}} and a boiling point equal to or greater than {{convert|100|°F|C}} and class IC liquids with a flash point equal to or greater than {{convert|73|F|C}}, but less than {{convert|100|°F|C}} have a NFPA 704 flammability rating of 3
*Class II liquids with a flash point equal to or greater than {{convert|100|°F|C}}, but less than {{convert|140|F|C}} and class IIIA liquids with a flash point equal to or greater than {{convert|140|F|C}}, but less than {{convert|200|F|C}} have a NFPA 704 flammability rating of 2
*Class IIIB liquids with a flash point equal to or greater than {{convert|200|F|C}} have a NFPA 704 flammability rating of 1

'''Friedrich Grillo''' (20 December 1825, [[Essen]] –  16 April 1888, [[Düsseldorf]]) was a prominent [[industrialist]] in the [[Ruhr]] area of Germany, particularly in [[Essen]] and [[Gelsenkirchen]].

Born the son of an Essen merchant, into a Protestant family of Italian origin (his ancestors came from [[Valtellina]], from which they fled due to religious persecutions), he took over his father's enterprise and expanded the range of trade, becoming an influential businessman. Grillo was a board member and founder of several mining companies.

Friedrich Grillo and, after his death, his widow Wilhelmine Grillo donated the property and two thirds of the construction costs of the [[Grillo-Theater]] which opened in Essen in 1892.

==1999 police raid==
In 1999, the offices of Future Electronics in Montreal were raided by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] following an investigation into allegations that the company had overcharged some customers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/archived/resources-archived/future-raided-by-mounties-1999-05/&lt;/ref&gt;  Future denied all charges and the founder and CEO of the company Robert Miller called the raid an "unfounded assault on our integrity".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/global/1999/1227/057_01.html#5dd1bab7a06d&lt;/ref&gt;  A year after the raid, in December 2000, [[Quebec_Court_of_Appeal|the Quebec Appeal Court]] ruled that the RCMP had no basis for issuing the search warrant executed at Future’s offices.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/archived/resources-archived/court-rules-in-favour-of-future-electronics-over-police-2000-12/&lt;/ref&gt;  The Quebec Appeal Court ordered the RCMP to return all the documents which were seized from the company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/future-electronics-wins-case-over-search-warrant-1.227562&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 2002, the Office of the US Attorney in Dallas,Texas announced that the investigation had been closed and that no charges would be filed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/us-drops-future-electronics-probe/article4133169/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''gas turbine''', also called a '''combustion turbine''', is a type of [[Internal combustion engine#Continuous combustion|continuous combustion]], [[internal combustion engine]]. There are three main components:
# An upstream rotating [[gas compressor]];
# A downstream [[turbine]] on the same shaft;
# A combustion chamber or area, called a [[combustor]], in between 1. and 2. above.
A fourth component is often used to increase efficiency ([[turboprop]], [[turbofan]]), to convert power into mechanical or electric form ([[turboshaft]], [[electric generator]]), or to achieve greater power to mass/volume ratio ([[afterburner]]).

The basic operation of the gas turbine is a [[Brayton cycle]] with air as the [[working fluid]]. Fresh atmospheric air flows through the compressor that brings it to higher pressure. [[Energy]] is then added by spraying fuel into the air and igniting it so the combustion generates a high-temperature flow. This high-temperature high-pressure gas enters a turbine, where it expands down to the exhaust pressure, producing a shaft work output in the process. The turbine shaft work is used to drive the compressor; the energy that is not used for shaft work comes out in the [[exhaust gases]] that produce [[thrust]]. The purpose of the gas turbine determines the design so that the most desirable split of energy between the thrust and the shaft work is achieved. The fourth step of the Brayton cycle (cooling of the working fluid) is omitted, as gas turbines are [[Open system (systems theory)|open systems]] that do not use the same air again.

Gas turbines are used to power aircraft, trains, ships, electrical generators, pumps, gas compressors, and [[tank]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sonntag |first1=Richard E. |last2=Borgnakke |first2=Claus |title=Introduction to engineering thermodynamics |year=2006 |publisher=John Wiley |isbn=9780471737599 |edition= Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Barber's gas turbine.jpg|thumb|upright|Sketch of John Barber's gas turbine, from his patent]]

*50: [[Hero of Alexandria|Hero's]] engine (''[[aeolipile]]''). Apparently, Hero's steam engine was taken to be no more than a toy, and thus its full potential not realized for centuries.
*1000: The "Trotting Horse Lamp" ({{zh|c=走马灯}}, ''zŏumădēng'') was used by the Chinese at lantern fairs as early as the [[Northern Song dynasty]]. When the lamp is lit, the heated airflow rises and drives an impeller with horse-riding figures attached on it, whose shadows are then projected onto the outer screen of the lantern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=B. Zhang|editor1-last=Lu|editor1-first=Yongxiang|title=A History of Chinese Science and Technology: Volume 3|date=2014-12-14|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=3662441624|pages=308–310|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Js_lBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA310 |quote='For trotting horse lamp, make paper-cut as wheel-like objects and the candle will heat the air which will rise and push the paper-cut to move, and the shadows of paper-cut will be cast by the candle light on the screen.' ...Judgment from the records of the Song dynasty shows that invention of China's trotting horse lamp was not later than 1000 AD. ...Obviously, the trotting horse lamp has already had the rudiment of a gas turbine.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1500: The ''[[Smoke jack|Chimney Jack]]'' was drawn by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]: Hot air from a fire rises through a single-stage axial turbine rotor mounted in the exhaust duct of the fireplace and turning the roasting spit by gear-chain connection.
*1629: Jets of steam rotated an impulse turbine that then drove a working [[Stamp mill|stamping mill]] by means of a [[bevel gear]], developed by [[Giovanni Branca]].
*1678: [[Ferdinand Verbiest]] built a model carriage relying on a steam jet for power.
*1791: A patent was given to [[John Barber (engineer)|John Barber]], an Englishman, for the first true gas turbine. His invention had most of the elements present in the modern day gas turbines.

==Theory of operation==
In an ideal gas turbine, gases undergo four [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] processes: an [[isentropic]] compression, an [[isobaric process|isobaric]] (constant pressure) combustion, an isentropic expansion and heat rejection. Together, these make up the [[Brayton cycle]].
[[File:Brayton cycle.svg|thumb|[[Brayton cycle]]]]
In a real gas turbine, mechanical energy is changed irreversibly (due to internal friction and turbulence) into pressure and thermal energy when the gas is compressed (in either a centrifugal or axial [[Gas compressor|compressor]]). Heat is added in the [[combustor|combustion chamber]] and the [[specific volume]] of the gas increases, accompanied by a slight loss in pressure. During expansion through the stator and rotor passages in the turbine, irreversible energy transformation once again occurs. Fresh air is taken in, in place of the heat rejection.

If the engine has a power turbine added to drive an industrial generator or a helicopter rotor, the exit pressure will be as close to the entry pressure as possible with only enough energy left to overcome the pressure losses in the exhaust ducting and expel the exhaust. For a [[turboprop]] engine there will be a particular balance between propeller power and jet thrust which gives the most economical operation. In a [[jet engine]] only enough pressure and energy is extracted from the flow to drive the compressor and other components. The remaining high-pressure gases are accelerated to provide a jet to propel an aircraft.

The smaller the engine, the higher the rotation rate of the shaft(s) must be to attain the required blade tip speed. Blade-tip speed determines the maximum pressure ratios that can be obtained by the turbine and the compressor. This, in turn, limits the maximum power and efficiency that can be obtained by the engine. In order for tip speed to remain constant, if the diameter of a rotor is reduced by half, the [[rotational speed]] must double. For example, large jet engines operate around 10,000 rpm, while micro turbines spin as fast as 500,000 rpm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.isma-isaac.be/publications/PMA_MOD_publications/ISMA2006/181-198.pdf |title=Rotordynamic behaviour of a micro-turbine rotor on air bearings: modelling techniques and experimental verification, p. 182 |first1=T. |last1=Waumans |first2=P. |last2=Vleugels |first3=J. |last3=Peirs |first4=F. |last4=Al-Bender |first5=D. |last5=Reynaerts |publisher=International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering |conference=ISMA |year=2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225144713/http://www.isma-isaac.be/publications/PMA_MOD_publications/ISMA2006/181-198.pdf |archive-date=2013-02-25 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanically, gas turbines ''can'' be considerably less complex than [[internal combustion]] piston engines. Simple turbines might have one main moving part, the compressor/shaft/turbine rotor assembly (see image above), with other moving parts in the fuel system. This, in turn, can translate into price. For instance, costing {{currency|10,000|RM}} for materials, the Jumo 004 proved cheaper than the [[Junkers Jumo 213|Junkers 213]] piston engine, which was {{currency|35,000|RM}},&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, John. ''The Race for Hitler's X-Planes'' (The Mill, Gloucestershire: History Press, 2013), p.74.&lt;/ref&gt; and needed only 375 hours of lower-skill labor to complete (including manufacture, assembly, and shipping), compared to 1,400 for the [[BMW 801]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.75.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Christopher isn't clear if this only applied to the 004s, so confirmation is wanted here....--&gt;This, however, also translate into poor efficiency and reliability. More advanced gas turbines (such as those found in modern [[turbofan|jet engines]] or combined cycle power plants) may have 2 or 3 shafts (spools), hundreds of compressor and turbine blades, movable stator blades, and extensive external tubing for fuel, oil and air systems; they use temperature resistant alloys, and are made with tight specifications requiring precision manufacture. All this often makes the construction of a simple gas turbine more complicated than a piston engine.

Moreover, to reach optimum performance in modern gas turbine power plants the gas needs to be prepared to exact fuel specifications. Fuel gas conditioning systems treat the natural gas to reach the exact fuel specification prior to entering the turbine in terms of pressure, temperature, gas composition, and the related wobbe-index.

[[Thrust bearing]]s and [[plain bearing|journal bearings]] are a critical part of a design. They are [[Fluid bearing|hydrodynamic oil bearings]] or oil-cooled [[rolling-element bearing]]s. [[Foil bearing]]s are used in some small machines such as micro turbines&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uwm.edu.pl/wnt/technicalsc/tech_12/B19.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and also have strong potential for use in small gas turbines/[[auxiliary power unit]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Agrawal |first=Giri L. |title=Foil Air/Gas Bearing Technology — An Overview |journal=ASME 1997 International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition |date=1997-06-02 |doi=10.1115/97-GT-347 |url= http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=2088143 |accessdate=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creep ===
A major challenge facing turbine design is reducing the [[creep (deformation)|creep]] that is induced by the high temperatures. Because of the stresses of operation, turbine materials become damaged through these mechanisms. As temperatures are increased in an effort to improve turbine efficiency, creep becomes more significant. To limit creep, thermal coatings and [[superalloy]]s with solid-solution strengthening and [[grain boundary strengthening]] are used in blade designs. Protective coatings are used to reduce the thermal damage and to limit [[oxidation]]. These coatings are often stabilized [[zirconium dioxide]]-based ceramics. Using a thermal protective coating limits the temperature exposure of the nickel superalloy. This reduces the creep mechanisms experienced in the blade. Oxidation coatings limit efficiency losses caused by a buildup on the outside of the blades, which is especially important in the high-temperature environment.&lt;ref&gt;Tamarin, Y. Protective Coatings for Turbine Blades. 2002. ASM International. pp 3-5&lt;/ref&gt; The nickel-based blades are alloyed with aluminum and titanium to improve strength and creep resistance. The [[microstructure]] of these alloys is composed of different regions of the composition. A uniform dispersion of the gamma-prime phase – a combination of nickel, aluminum, and titanium – promotes the strength and creep resistance of the blade due to the microstructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/phase-trans/2003/Superalloys/superalloys.html |title=Nickel Based Superalloys |website=msm.cam.ac.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060825053006/http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/phase-trans/2003/Superalloys/superalloys.html |archivedate=2006-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Refractory]] elements such as [[rhenium]] and [[ruthenium]] can be added to the alloy to improve creep strength. The addition of these elements reduces the diffusion of the gamma prime phase, thus preserving the [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] resistance, strength, and creep resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Latief, F. H.; Kakehi, K. (2013) “Effects of Re content and crystallographic orientation on creep behavior of aluminized Ni-based single crystal superalloys”. Materials &amp; Design 49 : 485-492&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Jet engines===
[[File:J85 ge 17a turbojet engine.jpg|thumb|typical axial-flow gas turbine turbojet, the [[General Electric J85|J85]], sectioned for display. Flow is left to right, multistage compressor on left, combustion chambers center, two-stage turbine on right]]

Airbreathing [[jet engine]]s are gas turbines optimized to produce thrust from the exhaust gases, or from [[ducted fan]]s connected to the gas turbines.&lt;ref name = "Dk"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dick |first=Erik |title=Thrust Gas Turbines |journal=Fundamentals of Turbomachines |volume=109 |location=Dordrecht |publisher=Springer |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jet engines that produce thrust from the direct impulse of exhaust gases are often called [[turbojet]]s, whereas those that generate thrust with the addition of a ducted fan are often called [[turbofan]]s or (rarely) fan-jets.

Gas turbines are also used in many [[liquid fuel rocket]]s, where gas turbines are used to power a [[turbopump]] to permit the use of lightweight, low-pressure tanks, reducing the empty weight of the rocket.

===Turboprop engines===
A [[turboprop]] engine is a turbine engine that drives an aircraft propeller using a reduction gear. Turboprop engines are used on small aircraft such as the general-aviation [[Cessna 208 Caravan]] and [[Embraer EMB 312 Tucano]] military trainer, medium-sized commuter aircraft such as the [[Bombardier Dash 8]] and large aircraft such as the [[Airbus A400M]] transport and the 60 year-old [[Tupolev Tu-95]] strategic bomber.

===Aeroderivative gas turbines===
[[File:GaTurbineBlade.svg|thumb|Diagram of a high-pressure [[Turbine blade#Film cooling|film-cooled turbine blade]]]]

Aeroderivatives are also used in electrical power generation due to their ability to be shut down and handle load changes more quickly than industrial machines. They are also used in the marine industry to reduce weight. The [[General Electric LM2500]], [[General Electric LM6000]], [[Rolls-Royce RB211]] and [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] are common models of this type of machine.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Amateur gas turbines===
Increasing numbers of gas turbines are being used or even constructed by amateurs.

In its most straightforward form, these are commercial turbines acquired through military surplus or scrapyard sales, then operated for display as part of the hobby of engine collecting.&lt;ref name="latexiron" &gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vb.n00bunlimited.net/vBTube.php?do=view&amp;vidid=5iQRdBE3IS0 |archive-url= https://archive.is/20130413204957/http://www.vb.n00bunlimited.net/vBTube.php?do=view&amp;vidid=5iQRdBE3IS0 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2013-04-13 |title=Vulcan APU startup |format=video}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Internal Fire, Proteus"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bristol Siddeley Proteus |year=1999 |publisher=Internal Fire Museum of Power |url=http://www.internalfire.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=136 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118165708/http://www.internalfire.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=136 |archivedate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its most extreme form, amateurs have even rebuilt engines beyond professional repair and then used them to compete for the [[Green Monster (car)|Land Speed Record]].

The simplest form of self-constructed gas turbine employs an automotive [[turbocharger]] as the core component. A combustion chamber is fabricated and plumbed between the compressor and turbine sections.&lt;ref name="Scrapheap Challenge, gas turbine go-cart" &gt;{{cite show|title=Jet Racer |series=Scrapheap Challenge |serieslink=Scrapheap Challenge |season=6 |url= http://www.channel4.com/programmes/scrapheap-challenge/4od#3349454 |location=UK |year=2003 |accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More sophisticated turbojets are also built, where their thrust and light weight are sufficient to power large model aircraft.&lt;ref name="Schreckling, Gas Turbines for Model Aircraft" &gt;{{cite book |last=Schreckling |first=Kurt |title=Gas Turbines for Model Aircraft |year=1994 |isbn=0-9510589-1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kurt Schreckling|Schreckling]] design&lt;ref name="Schreckling, Gas Turbines for Model Aircraft" /&gt; constructs the entire engine from raw materials, including the fabrication of a centrifugal compressor wheel from plywood, epoxy and wrapped carbon fibre strands.

Several small companies now manufacture small turbines and parts for the amateur. Most turbojet-powered model aircraft are now using these commercial and semi-commercial microturbines, rather than a Schreckling-like home-build.&lt;ref name="Kamps" &gt;{{cite book|title=Model Jet Engines |isbn=1-900371-91-X |year=2005 |last=Kamps |first=Thomas |publisher=Traplet Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auxiliary power units===
[[Auxiliary power unit|APUs]] are small gas turbines designed to supply auxiliary power to larger, mobile, machines such as an [[aircraft]]. They supply:
* compressed air for air conditioning and ventilation,
* compressed air start-up power for larger [[jet engine]]s,
* mechanical (shaft) power to a gearbox to drive shafted accessories or to start large jet engines, and
* electrical, hydraulic and other power-transmission sources to consuming devices remote from the APU.

===Industrial gas turbines for power generation===
[[File:GE H series Gas Turbine.jpg|thumb|GE H series power generation gas turbine: in [[combined cycle]] configuration, its highest [[Thermodynamic efficiency|thermal efficiency]] is 62.22%]]

Industrial gas turbines differ from aeronautical designs in that the frames, bearings, and blading are of heavier construction. They are also much more closely integrated with the devices they power— often an [[electric generator]]—and the secondary-energy equipment that is used to recover residual energy (largely heat).

They range in size from portable mobile plants to large, complex systems weighing more than a hundred tonnes housed in purpose-built buildings. When the gas turbine is used solely for shaft power, its thermal efficiency is about 30%. However, it may be cheaper to buy electricity than to generate it. Therefore, many engines are used in CHP (Combined Heat and Power) configurations that can be small enough to be integrated into portable [[Intermodal container|container]] configurations.

Gas turbines can be particularly efficient when [[waste heat]] from the turbine is recovered by a heat recovery steam generator to power a conventional steam turbine in a [[combined cycle]] configuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://memagazineblog.org/2012/07/01/efficiency-by-the-numbers/ |title= Efficiency by the Numbers |author= Lee S. Langston}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 605 MW [[General Electric]] 9HA achieved a 62.22% efficiency rate with temperatures as high as {{convert|2,800|°F|°C|order=flip}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.gereports.com/bouchain/ |title= Here’s Why The Latest Guinness World Record Will Keep France Lit Up Long After Soccer Fans Leave |first=Tomas |last=Kellner |publisher=[[General Electric]] |date=2016-06-17 |access-date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For 2018, GE offers its 826 MW HA at over 64% efficiency in combined cycle due to advances in [[additive manufacturing]] and combustion breakthroughs, up from 63.7% in 2017 orders and on track to achieve 65% by the early 2020s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= https://www.genewsroom.com/press-releases/ha-technology-now-available-industry-first-64-percent-efficiency-284144 |title= HA technology now available at industry-first 64 percent efficiency |date=2017-12-04 |publisher= GE Power}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aeroderivative gas turbines can also be used in combined cycles, leading to a higher efficiency, but it will not be as high as a specifically designed industrial gas turbine. They can also be run in a [[cogeneration]] configuration: the exhaust is used for space or water heating, or drives an [[gas-absorption refrigerator|absorption chiller]] for cooling the inlet air and increase the power output, technology known as [[Turbine Inlet Air Cooling]].

Another significant advantage is their ability to be turned on and off within minutes, supplying power during peak, or unscheduled, demand. Since single cycle (gas turbine only) power plants are less efficient than combined cycle plants, they are usually used as [[peaking power plant]]s, which operate anywhere from several hours per day to a few dozen hours per year—depending on the electricity demand and the generating capacity of the region. In areas with a shortage of base-load and [[load following power plant]] capacity or with low fuel costs, a gas turbine powerplant may regularly operate most hours of the day. A large single-cycle gas turbine typically produces 100 to 400&amp;nbsp;megawatts of electric power and has 35–40% [[thermodynamic efficiency|thermal efficiency]].&lt;ref name=siemens&gt;{{cite web | first1=Phil | last1=Ratliff |first2=Paul |last2=Garbett |first3=Willibald |last3=Fischer | title = The New Siemens Gas Turbine SGT5-8000H for More Customer Benefit | work =VGB PowerTech | publisher =Siemens Power Generation |date=September 2007| url =http://www.energy.siemens.com/us/pool/hq/power-generation/gas-turbines/downloads/SGT5-8000H_benefits.pdf | format =PDF |accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial gas turbines for mechanical drive===
Industrial gas turbines that are used solely for mechanical drive or used in collaboration with a recovery steam generator differ from power generating sets in that they are often smaller and feature a dual shaft design as opposed to a single shaft. The power range varies from 1 megawatt up to 50 megawatts.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} These engines are connected directly or via a gearbox to either a pump or compressor assembly. The majority of installations are used within the oil and gas industries. Mechanical drive applications increase efficiency by around 2%.

Oil and Gas platforms require these engines to drive compressors to inject gas into the wells to force oil up via another bore, or to compress the gas for transportation. They're also often used to provide power for the platform. These platforms don't need to use the engine in collaboration with a CHP system due to getting the gas at an extremely reduced cost (often free from burn off gas). The same companies use pump sets to drive the fluids to land and across pipelines in various intervals.

====Compressed air energy storage====
{{Main|Compressed air energy storage}}

One modern development seeks to improve efficiency in another way, by separating the compressor and the turbine with a compressed air store. In a conventional turbine, up to half the generated power is used driving the compressor. In a compressed air energy storage configuration, power, perhaps from a wind farm or bought on the open market at a time of low demand and low price, is used to drive the compressor, and the compressed air released to operate the turbine when required.

===Turboshaft engines===
[[Turboshaft]] engines are often used to drive compression trains (for example in gas pumping stations or natural gas liquefaction plants) and are used to power almost all modern helicopters. The primary shaft bears the compressor and the high-speed turbine (often referred to as the ''Gas Generator''), while a second shaft bears the low-speed turbine (a ''power turbine'' or ''free-wheeling turbine'' on helicopters, especially, because the gas generator turbine spins separately from the power turbine). In effect the separation of the gas generator, by a fluid coupling (the hot energy-rich combustion gases), from the power turbine is analogous to an [[Automatic transmission|automotive transmission's]] [[Torque converter|fluid coupling]]. This arrangement is used to increase power-output flexibility with associated highly-reliable control mechanisms.

===Radial gas turbines===
{{Main|Radial turbine}}

In 1963, [[Jan Mowill]] initiated the development at [[Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk]] in [[Norway]]. Various successors have made good progress in the refinement of this mechanism. Owing to a configuration that keeps heat away from certain bearings the durability of the machine is improved while the radial turbine is well matched in speed requirement.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Scale jet engines===
[[File:DH Goblin annotated colour cutaway.png|thumb|Scale jet engines are scaled down versions of this early full scale engine]]

Also known as miniature gas turbines or micro-jets.

With this in mind the pioneer of modern Micro-Jets, [[Kurt Schreckling]], produced one of the world's first Micro-Turbines, the FD3/67.&lt;ref name="Schreckling, Gas Turbines for Model Aircraft" /&gt; This engine can produce up to 22 [[newton (unit)|newton]]s of thrust, and can be built by most mechanically minded people with basic engineering tools, such as a [[metal lathe]].&lt;ref name="Schreckling, Gas Turbines for Model Aircraft" /&gt;

===Microturbines===
{{main|Microturbine}}

Evolved from piston engine [[turbocharger]]s, aircraft [[auxiliary power unit|APU]]s or small [[jet engine]]s, [[microturbine]]s are 25 to 500 [[kilowatt]] turbines the size of a [[refrigerator]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=wbdg22dec2016/&gt;--&gt;
Microturbines have around 15% [[engine efficiency|efficiencies]] without a [[recuperator]], 20 to 30% with one and they can reach 85% combined thermal-electrical efficiency in [[cogeneration]].&lt;ref name=wbdg22dec2016&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wbdg.org/resources/microturbines |title= Microturbines |first=Barney L. |last=Capehart |date=Dec 22, 2016 |publisher=National Institute of Building Sciences |work=Whole Building Design Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==External combustion==
Most gas turbines are internal combustion engines but it is also possible to manufacture an external combustion gas turbine which is, effectively, a turbine version of a [[hot air engine]].
Those systems are usually indicated as EFGT (Externally Fired Gas Turbine) or IFGT (Indirectly Fired Gas Turbine).

External combustion has been used for the purpose of using [[pulverized coal]] or finely ground biomass (such as sawdust) as a fuel. In the indirect system, a [[Shell and tube heat exchanger|heat exchanger]] is used and only clean air with no combustion products travels through the power turbine. The [[thermal efficiency]] is lower in the indirect type of external combustion; however, the turbine blades are not subjected to combustion products and much lower quality (and therefore cheaper) fuels are able to be used.

When external combustion is used, it is possible to use exhaust air from the turbine as the primary combustion air. This effectively reduces global heat losses, although heat losses associated with the combustion exhaust remain inevitable.

[[Closed-cycle gas turbine]]s based on [[helium]] or [[supercritical carbon dioxide]] also hold promise for use with future high temperature solar and nuclear power generation.

==In surface vehicles==
[[File:STP Turbine.jpg|thumb|The 1967 ''STP Oil Treatment Special'' on display at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] Hall of Fame Museum, with the [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]] gas turbine shown]]
[[File:Howmet TX Daytona.jpg|thumb|A 1968 [[Howmet TX]], the only turbine-powered race car to have won a race]]

Gas turbines are often used on [[ship]]s, [[locomotive]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[tank]]s, and to a lesser extent, on cars, buses, and motorcycles.

A key advantage of jets and [[turboprop]]s for airplane propulsion - their superior performance at high altitude compared to piston engines, particularly [[naturally aspirated engine|naturally aspirated]] ones - is irrelevant in most automobile applications. Their power-to-weight advantage, though less critical than for aircraft, is still important.

Gas turbines offer a high-powered engine in a very small and light package. However, they are not as responsive and efficient as small piston engines over the wide range of RPMs and powers needed in vehicle applications. In [[Series hybrid|series hybrid vehicles]], as the driving electric motors are mechanically detached from the electricity generating engine, the responsiveness, poor performance at low speed and low efficiency at low output problems are much less important. The turbine can be run at optimum speed for its power output, and batteries and [[Electric double-layer capacitor|ultracapacitors]] can supply power as needed, with the engine cycled on and off to run it only at high efficiency. The emergence of the [[continuously variable transmission]] may also alleviate the responsiveness problem.

Turbines have historically been more expensive to produce than piston engines, though this is partly because piston engines have been mass-produced in huge quantities for decades, while small gas turbine engines are rarities; however, turbines are mass-produced in the closely related form of the [[turbocharger]].

The turbocharger is basically a compact and simple free shaft radial gas turbine which is driven by the piston engine's [[exhaust gas]]. The centripetal turbine wheel drives a [[centrifugal compressor]] wheel through a common rotating shaft. This wheel supercharges the engine air intake to a degree that can be controlled by means of a [[wastegate]] or by dynamically modifying the turbine housing's geometry (as in a [[Variable geometry turbocharger|VGT]] turbocharger).
It mainly serves as a power recovery device which converts a great deal of otherwise wasted thermal and kinetic energy into engine [[Turbo|boost]].

[[Turbo-compound engine]]s (actually employed on some [[Semi-trailer truck|truck]]s) are fitted with blow down turbines which are similar in design and appearance to a turbocharger
except for the turbine shaft being mechanically or hydraulically connected to the engine's crankshaft instead of to a centrifugal compressor, thus providing additional power instead of boost.
While the turbocharger is a pressure turbine, a power recovery turbine is a velocity one.

===Passenger road vehicles (cars, bikes, and buses)===
A number of experiments have been conducted with gas turbine powered [[automobile]]s, the largest by [[Chrysler]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turbinecar.com/misc/History.pdf "History of Chrysler Corporation Gas Turbine Vehicles"] published by the Engineering Section 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://automobileart.homestead.com/ChryslerConceptCars.html "Chrysler Corp., Exner Concept Cars 1940 to 1961" undated], retrieved on 2008-05-11.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, there has been some interest in the use of turbine engines for hybrid electric cars. For instance, a consortium led by micro gas turbine company [[Bladon Jets]] has secured investment from the Technology Strategy Board to develop an Ultra Lightweight Range Extender (ULRE) for next-generation electric vehicles. The objective of the consortium, which includes luxury car maker Jaguar Land Rover and leading electrical machine company SR Drives, is to produce the world’s first commercially viable - and environmentally friendly - gas turbine generator designed specifically for automotive applications.&lt;ref name="bladon"&gt;[http://www.bladonjets.com/news/bladon-jets-wins-tsb-award/ Bladon Jets And Jaguar Land Rover Win Funding For Gas Turbine Electric Vehicle Project] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120313215440/http://www.bladonjets.com/news/bladon-jets-wins-tsb-award/ |date=2012-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common turbocharger for gasoline or diesel engines is also a turbine derivative.

====Concept cars====
[[File:Rover.jet1.jpg|thumb|The 1950 [[Rover Company|Rover]] JET1]]

The first serious investigation of using a gas turbine in cars was in 1946 when two engineers, Robert Kafka and Robert Engerstein of Carney Associates, a New York engineering firm, came up with the concept where a unique compact turbine engine design would provide power for a rear wheel drive car. After an article appeared in ''Popular Science'', there was no further work, beyond the paper stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7SADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=popular+science+May+1946 |page=121 |title=Gas Turbines For Autos |date=May 1946 |journal=Popular Science |volume=146 |issue=8 |accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, designer F.R. Bell and Chief Engineer [[Maurice Wilks]] from British car manufacturers [[Rover Company|Rover]] unveiled the first car powered with a gas turbine engine. The two-seater [[Rover JET1|JET1]] had the engine positioned behind the seats, air intake grilles on either side of the car, and exhaust outlets on the top of the tail. During tests, the car reached top speeds of {{convert|140|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, at a turbine speed of 50,000&amp;nbsp;rpm. The car ran on [[petrol]], [[kerosene|paraffin (kerosene)]] or [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] oil, but fuel consumption problems proved insurmountable for a production car. It is on display at the London [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]].

A French turbine powered car, the Socema-Gregoire, was displayed at the October 1952 [[Paris Auto Show]]. It was designed by the French engineer [[Jean-Albert Grégoire]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

[[File:FirebirdI.jpg|thumb|[[General Motors Firebird|GM Firebird I]]]]

The first turbine-powered car built in the US was the [[General Motors Firebird|GM Firebird I]] which began evaluations in 1953. While photos of the Firebird I may suggest that the jet turbine's thrust propelled the car like an aircraft, the turbine actually drove the rear wheels. The Firebird 1 was never meant as a commercial passenger car and was solely built for testing &amp; evaluation as well as public relation purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nNwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January |title=Gas Turbine Auto |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=March 1954 |page=90 |volume=101 |issue=3 |accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chrysler built fifty [[Chrysler Turbine Car]]s in 1963 and conducted the only consumer trial of gas turbine-powered cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/mopar/turbine.html |title=Chrysler turbine engines and cars |publisher=Allpar.com |accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of their turbines employed a unique rotating [[recuperator]], referred to as a regenerator that increased efficiency.&lt;ref name="PS-turboPlymouth"/&gt;

In 1954 [[Fiat|FIAT]] unveiled a [[concept car]] with a turbine engine, called [[Fiat Turbina]]. This vehicle, looking like an aircraft with wheels, used a unique combination of both jet thrust and the engine driving the wheels. Speeds of {{convert|175|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip|round=5|0}} were claimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zSADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=-PA20 |title=Italy's Turbo Car Hits 175 m.p.h. |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=July 1954 |page=120 |volume=165 |issue=1 |accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original [[General Motors Firebird]] was a series of concept cars developed for the 1953, 1956 and 1959 [[Motorama]] auto shows, powered by gas turbines.

As a result of the U.S. [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] Amendments of 1970, research was funded to developing automotive gas turbine technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Issues in Federally Supported Research on Advanced Automotive Power Systems |first=Lawrence H. |last=Linden |first2=Subramanyam |last2=Kumar |first3=Paul R. |last3=Samuelson |publisher=Division of Policy Research and Analysis, National Science Foundation |date=December 1977 |page=49 |url= http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/31259 |accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design concepts and vehicles were conducted by [[Chrysler]], [[General Motors]], [[Ford]] (in collaboration with [[Garrett AiResearch|AiResearch]]), and [[American Motors]] (in conjunction with [[Williams International|Williams Research]]).&lt;ref&gt;Linden, page 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term tests were conducted evaluate comparable cost efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Verrelli |first=L.

[[Toyota]] demonstrated several gas turbine powered concept cars, such as the [[Toyota Century GT45|Century gas turbine hybrid]] in 1975, the [[Toyota Sports 800#Sports 800 Gas Turbine Hybrid|Sports 800 Gas Turbine Hybrid]] in 1979 and the [[Toyota GTV|GTV]] in 1985. No production vehicles were made. The GT24 engine was exhibited in 1977 without a vehicle.

In the early 1990s, [[Volvo]] introduced the [[Volvo ECC|Volvo Environmental Concept Car]](ECC) which was a gas turbine powered [[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid car]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=10/31/2007 |url=http://www.greencarreports.com/ |title=Article in Green Car |publisher=Greencar.com |date=2007-10-31 |accessdate=2012-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813152350/http://www.greencarreports.com/ |archivedate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] introduced the first commercial gas turbine powered [[hybrid vehicle]]—as a limited production run of the [[General Motors EV-1#EV1 series hybrid|EV-1 series hybrid]]. A [[Williams International]] 40&amp;nbsp;kW turbine drove an alternator which powered the battery-electric [[powertrain]]. The turbine design included a recuperator. In 2006, GM went into the [[EcoJet concept car]] project with [[Jay Leno]].

At the [[2010 Paris Motor Show]] [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] demonstrated its [[Jaguar C-X75]] concept car. This electrically powered [[supercar]] has a top speed of {{convert|204|mph|abbr=on|0}} and can go from {{convert|0|to|62|mph|abbr=on|0}} in 3.4 seconds. It uses Lithium-ion batteries to power four electric motors which combine to produce 780&amp;nbsp;bhp. It will travel {{convert|68|mi}} on a single charge of the batteries, and uses a pair of Bladon Micro Gas Turbines to re-charge the batteries extending the range to {{convert|560|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.automoblog.net/2010/10/01/the-electric-cat-jaguar-c-x75-concept-supercar/ |title=The Electric Cat: Jaguar C-X75 Concept Supercar |publisher=Automoblog.net |date=2010-10-01 |first=Chris |last=Nagy |accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Racing cars====
The first race car (in concept only) fitted with a turbine was in 1955 by a US Air Force group as a hobby project with a turbine loaned them by Boeing and a race car owned by Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Popular Science |title=Turbine Drives Retired Racing Car |page=89 |date=June 1955 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=biYDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=popular+science+1930 |accessdate=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first race car fitted with a turbine for the goal of actual racing was by Rover and the [[British Racing Motors|BRM]] [[Formula One]] team joined forces to produce the [[Rover-BRM]], a gas turbine powered coupe, which entered the [[1963 24 Hours of Le Mans]], driven by [[Graham Hill]] and [[Richie Ginther]]. It averaged {{convert|107.8|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and had a top speed of {{convert|142|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. American Ray Heppenstall joined Howmet Corporation and McKee Engineering together to develop their own gas turbine sports car in 1968, the [[Howmet TX]], which ran several American and European events, including two wins, and also participated in the [[1968 24 Hours of Le Mans]]. The cars used [[Continental Motors Company|Continental]] gas turbines, which eventually set six [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] land speed records for turbine-powered cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://website.lineone.net/~pete.stowe/pete_howmet.htm |title=The history of the Howmet TX turbine car of 1968, still the world's only turbine powered race winner |publisher=Pete Stowe Motorsport History |date=June 2006 |access-date=2008-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080302012133/http://website.lineone.net/~pete.stowe/pete_howmet.htm |archivedate=2008-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[open wheel racing]], 1967's revolutionary [[STP-Paxton Turbocar]] fielded by racing and entrepreneurial legend [[Andy Granatelli]] and driven by [[Parnelli Jones]] nearly won the [[Indianapolis 500]]; the [[Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6|Pratt &amp; Whitney ST6B-62]] powered turbine car was almost a lap ahead of the second place car when a gearbox bearing failed just three laps from the finish line. The next year the STP [[Lotus 56]] turbine car won the Indianapolis 500 pole position even though new rules restricted the air intake dramatically. In 1971 [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] principal [[Colin Chapman]] introduced the [[Lotus 56| Lotus 56B]] F1 car, powered by a [[Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6|Pratt &amp; Whitney STN 6/76]] gas turbine. Chapman had a reputation of building radical championship-winning cars, but had to abandon the project because there were too many problems with [[turbo lag]].

====Buses====
The arrival of the [[Capstone Turbine|Capstone Microturbine]] has led to several hybrid bus designs, starting with HEV-1 by AVS of Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1999, and closely followed by Ebus and ISE Research in California, and [[DesignLine Corporation]] in New Zealand (and later the United States). AVS turbine hybrids were plagued with reliability and quality control problems, resulting in liquidation of AVS in 2003. The most successful design by Designline is now operated in 5 cities in 6 countries, with over 30 buses in operation worldwide, and order for several hundred being delivered to Baltimore, and New York City.

[[Brescia|Brescia Italy]] is using serial hybrid buses powered by microturbines on routes through the historical sections of the city.&lt;ref name="Source"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://draft.fgm-amor.at/altermotive/study_sheet.phtml?study_id=2866&amp;lang1=en |title=Serial Hybrid Busses for a Public Transport scheme in Brescia (Italy) |publisher=Draft.fgm-amor.at |accessdate=2012-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316112717/http://draft.fgm-amor.at/altermotive/study_sheet.phtml?study_id=2866&amp;lang1=en |archivedate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Motorcycles====
The [[MTT Turbine Superbike]] appeared in 2000 (hence the designation of Y2K Superbike by MTT) and is the first production motorcycle powered by a turbine engine - specifically, a Rolls-Royce Allison model 250 turboshaft engine, producing about 283&amp;nbsp;kW (380&amp;nbsp;bhp). Speed-tested to 365&amp;nbsp;km/h or 227&amp;nbsp;mph (according to some stories, the testing team ran out of road during the test), it holds the Guinness World Record for most powerful production motorcycle and most expensive production motorcycle, with a price tag of US$185,000.

===Trains===
{{Main|Gas turbine-electric locomotive|Gas turbine train}}
Several locomotive classes have been powered by gas turbines, the most recent incarnation being [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]]'s [[JetTrain]].

===Tanks===
[[File:AGT1500 engine and M1 tank.JPEG|thumb|Marines from 1st Tank Battalion load a [[Honeywell AGT1500]] multi-fuel turbine back into an M1 Abrams tank at Camp Coyote, Kuwait, February 2003]]

The Third Reich [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|''Wehrmacht Heer'']]'s development division, the [[Heereswaffenamt]] (Army Ordnance Board), studied a number of gas turbine engine designs for use in tanks starting in mid-1944. The first gas turbine engine design intended for use in armored fighting vehicle propulsion, the [[BMW 003]]-based [[GT 101]], was meant for installation in the [[Panther tank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kay |first=Antony L. |title=German jet engine and gas turbine development 1930 - 1945 |year=2002 |publisher=Airlife |isbn=9781840372946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second use of a gas turbine in an armored fighting vehicle was in 1954 when a unit, PU2979, specifically developed for tanks by [[C. A. Parsons and Company|C. A. Parsons &amp; Co.]], was installed and trialled in a British [[Conqueror tank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ogorkiewicz |first=Richard M. |title=Technology of Tanks |page=259 |year=1991 |publisher=Jane's Information Group |isbn=9780710605955}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stridsvagn 103]] was developed in the 1950s and was the first mass-produced main battle tank to use a [[Boeing T50|turbine engine]]. Since then, gas turbine engines have been used as [[auxiliary power unit|APUs]] in some tanks and as main powerplants in Soviet/Russian [[T-80]]s and U.S. [[M1 Abrams]] tanks, among others. They are lighter and smaller than [[diesel engine|diesels]] at the same sustained power output but the models installed to date are less fuel efficient than the equivalent diesel, especially at idle, requiring more fuel to achieve the same combat range. Successive models of M1 have addressed this problem with battery packs or secondary generators to power the tank's systems while stationary, saving fuel by reducing the need to idle the main turbine. T-80s can mount three large external fuel drums to extend their range. Russia has stopped production of the T-80 in favor of the diesel-powered [[T-90]] (based on the [[T-72]]), while Ukraine has developed the diesel-powered T-80UD and T-84 with nearly the power of the gas-turbine tank. The French [[Leclerc]] MBT's diesel powerplant features the "Hyperbar" hybrid supercharging system, where the engine's turbocharger is completely replaced with a small gas turbine which also works as an assisted diesel exhaust turbocharger, enabling engine RPM-independent boost level control and a higher peak boost pressure to be reached (than with ordinary turbochargers). This system allows a smaller displacement and lighter engine to be used as the tank's powerplant and effectively removes [[turbo lag]]. This special gas turbine/turbocharger can also work independently from the main engine as an ordinary APU.

A turbine is theoretically more reliable and easier to maintain than a piston engine since it has a simpler construction with fewer moving parts, but in practice, turbine parts experience a higher wear rate due to their higher working speeds. The turbine blades are highly sensitive to dust and fine sand so that in desert operations air filters have to be fitted and changed several times daily. An improperly fitted filter, or a bullet or shell fragment that punctures the filter, can damage the engine. Piston engines (especially if turbocharged) also need well-maintained filters, but they are more resilient if the filter does fail.

Like most modern diesel engines used in tanks, gas turbines are usually multi-fuel engines.

===Marine applications===

====Naval====
[[File:Gas turbine from MGB 2009.jpg|thumb|The Gas turbine from MGB 2009]]

Gas turbines are used in many [[naval vessel]]s, where they are valued for their high [[power-to-weight ratio]] and their ships' resulting acceleration and ability to get underway quickly.

The first gas-turbine-powered naval vessel was the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Motor Gun Boat]] ''MGB 2009'' (formerly ''MGB 509'') converted in 1947. [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] fitted their [[Metropolitan-Vickers F.2|F2/3]] jet engine with a power turbine. The [[Steam Gun Boat]] ''Grey Goose'' was converted to Rolls-Royce gas turbines in 1952 and operated as such from 1953.&lt;ref name="Walsh_01"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gas Turbine Performance|last=Walsh|first=Philip P.|author2=Paul Fletcher|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2004|isbn=978-0-632-06434-2|edition=2nd|page=25}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2011-09-15--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bold class patrol boat|Bold class]] [[Fast Patrol Boat]]s ''Bold Pioneer'' and ''Bold Pathfinder'' built in 1953 were the first ships created specifically for gas turbine propulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10421693 |title='&amp;#39;The first marine gas turbine, 1947'&amp;#39; |publisher=Scienceandsociety.co.uk |date=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first large-scale, partially gas-turbine powered ships were the Royal Navy's [[Tribal-class frigate|Type 81]] (Tribal class) [[frigate]]s with [[combined steam and gas]] powerplants. The first, {{HMS|Ashanti|F117|6}} was commissioned in 1961.

The [[German Navy]] launched the first {{sclass-|Köln|frigate}} in 1961 with 2 [[Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie]] gas turbines in the world's first [[combined diesel and gas]] propulsion system.

The [[Danish Navy]] had 6 ''Søløven''-class torpedo boats (the export version of the British [[Brave class fast patrol boat]]) in service from 1965 to 1990, which had 3 [[Bristol Proteus]] (later RR Proteus) Marine Gas Turbines rated at {{convert|12750|shp|abbr=on|order=flip|-1}} combined, plus two [[General Motors]] Diesel engines, rated at {{convert|460|shp|abbr=on|order=flip|-1}}, for better fuel economy at slower speeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navalhistory.dk/danish/Skibene/Skibsklasser/Soeloeven_klassen(1965).htm ''Søløven class torpedoboat, 1965''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115094226/http://www.navalhistory.dk/danish/Skibene/Skibsklasser/Soeloeven_klassen%281965%29.htm |date=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; And they also produced 10 Willemoes Class Torpedo / Guided Missile boats (in service from 1974 to 2000) which had 3 [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls Royce]] Marine Proteus Gas Turbines also rated at {{convert|12750|shp|abbr=on|order=flip|-1}}, same as the Søløven-class boats, and 2 General Motors Diesel Engines, rated at {{convert|800|shp|abbr=on|order=flip|-1}}, also for improved fuel economy at slow speeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navalhistory.dk/english/TheShips/Classes/Willemoes_Class(1977).htm ''Willemoes class torpedo/guided missile boat, 1974''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820100754/http://www.navalhistory.dk/english/TheShips/Classes/Willemoes_Class%281977%29.htm |date=2011-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swedish Navy]] produced 6 Spica-class torpedo boats between 1966 and 1967 powered by 3 [[Bristol Siddeley]] [[Bristol Proteus|Proteus 1282 turbines]], each delivering {{convert|4300|shp|abbr=on|order=flip|-1}}. They were later joined by 12 upgraded Norrköping class ships, still with the same engines. With their aft torpedo tubes replaced by antishipping missiles they served as missile boats until the last was retired in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:sv:Robotbåt|Fast missile boat]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Finnish Navy]] commissioned two {{sclass-|Turunmaa|gunboat|0}} [[corvette]]s, ''Turunmaa'' and ''Karjala'', in 1968. They were equipped with one {{convert|22000|shp|abbr=on|order=flip|-1}} [[Rolls-Royce Olympus]] TM1 gas turbine and three [[Wärtsilä]] marine diesels for slower speeds. They were the fastest vessels in the Finnish Navy; they regularly achieved speeds of 35 knots, and 37.3 knots during sea trials. The ''Turunmaa''s were paid off in 2002. ''Karjala'' is today a [[museum ship]] in [[Turku]], and ''Turunmaa'' serves as a floating machine shop and training ship for Satakunta Polytechnical College.

The next series of major naval vessels were the four Canadian {{sclass-|Iroquois|destroyer|0}} helicopter carrying destroyers first commissioned in 1972. They used 2&amp;nbsp;ft-4 main propulsion engines, 2&amp;nbsp;ft-12 cruise engines and 3 Solar Saturn 750&amp;nbsp;kW generators.

[[File:USS Ford (FFG-54) Gas Turbine.jpg|thumb|An LM2500 gas turbine on {{USS|Ford|FFG-54|6}}]]
The first U.S. gas-turbine powered ship was the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard's]] {{USCGC|Point Thatcher|WPB-82314|2}}, a cutter commissioned in 1961 that was powered by two {{convert|1000|shp|abbr=on|order=flip|-1}} turbines utilizing controllable-pitch propellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Point_Thatcher.pdf |title=US Coast Guard Historian's website, USCGC '&amp;#39;Point Thatcher'&amp;#39; (WPB-82314) |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The larger {{sclass-|Hamilton|cutter|0}} [[USCG high endurance cutter|High Endurance Cutters]], was the first class of larger cutters to utilize gas turbines, the first of which ({{USCGC|Hamilton|WHEC-715|6}}) was commissioned in 1967. Since then, they have powered the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy's]] {{sclass-|Oliver Hazard Perry|frigate|1}}s, {{sclass-|Spruance|destroyer|5}} and {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|2}}s, and {{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser|0}} [[guided missile cruisers]]. {{USS|Makin Island|LHD-8|6}}, a modified {{sclass-|Wasp|amphibious assault ship}}, is to be the Navy's first amphibious assault ship powered by gas turbines.
The marine gas turbine operates in a more corrosive atmosphere due to the presence of sea salt in air and fuel and use of cheaper fuels.

====Civilian maritime====
Up to the late 1940s, much of the progress on marine gas turbines all over the world took place in design offices and engine builder's workshops and development work was led by the British [[Royal Navy]] and other Navies. While interest in the gas turbine for marine purposes, both naval and mercantile, continued to increase, the lack of availability of the results of operating experience on early gas turbine projects limited the number of new ventures on seagoing commercial vessels being embarked upon. In 1951, the Diesel-electric oil tanker ''Auris'', 12,290 [[Deadweight tonnage]] (DWT) was used to obtain operating experience with a main propulsion gas turbine under service conditions at sea and so became the first ocean-going merchant ship to be powered by a gas turbine. Built by [[Hawthorn Leslie and Company|Hawthorn Leslie]] at [[Hebburn-on-Tyne]], UK, in accordance with plans and specifications drawn up by the [[Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company]] and launched on the UK's [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]]'s 21st birthday in 1947, the ship was designed with an engine room layout that would allow for the experimental use of heavy fuel in one of its high-speed engines, as well as the future substitution of one of its diesel engines by a gas turbine.&lt;ref&gt;(1954), [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-3584.1954.tb03976.x/abstract Operation of a Marine Gas Turbine Under Sea Conditions]. ''Journal of the American Society for Naval Engineers'', 66: 457–466. doi: 10.1111/j.1559-3584.1954.tb03976.x&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Auris'' operated commercially as a tanker for three-and-a-half years with a diesel-electric propulsion unit as originally commissioned, but in 1951 one of its four {{convert|1105|bhp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}} diesel engines – which were known as "Faith", "Hope", "Charity" and "Prudence" - was replaced by the world’s first marine gas turbine engine, a {{convert|1200|bhp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}} open-cycle gas turbo-alternator built by [[British Thomson-Houston|British Thompson-Houston Company]] in [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]]. Following successful sea trials off the Northumbrian coast, the ''Auris'' set sail from Hebburn-on-Tyne in October 1951 bound for [[Port Arthur, Texas|Port Arthur]] in the US and then [[Curacao]] in the southern Caribbean returning to [[Avonmouth]] after 44 days at sea, successfully completing her historic trans-Atlantic crossing. During this time at sea the gas turbine burnt diesel fuel and operated without an involuntary stop or mechanical difficulty of any kind. She subsequently visited Swansea, Hull, [[Rotterdam]], [[Oslo]] and Southampton covering a total of 13,211 nautical miles. The ''Auris'' then had all of its power plants replaced with a {{convert|5250|shp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}} directly coupled gas turbine to become the first civilian ship to operate solely on gas turbine power.

Despite the success of this early experimental voyage the gas turbine was not to replace the diesel engine as the propulsion plant for large merchant ships. At constant cruising speeds the diesel engine simply had no peer in the vital area of fuel economy. The gas turbine did have more success in Royal Navy ships and the other naval fleets of the world where sudden and rapid changes of speed are required by warships in action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Future Ship Powering Options: Exploring alternative methods of ship propulsion|publisher=Royal Academy of Engineering Prince Philip House|isbn=9781909327016|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/publications/reports/future-ship-powering-options}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Maritime Commission]] were looking for options to update WWII [[Liberty ships]], and heavy-duty gas turbines were one of those selected. In 1956 the ''John Sergeant'' was lengthened and equipped with a [[General Electric]] {{convert|6600|shp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}} HD gas turbine with exhaust-gas regeneration, reduction gearing and a [[variable-pitch propeller]]. It operated for 9,700 hours using residual fuel([[Bunker C]]) for 7,000 hours. Fuel efficiency was on a par with steam propulsion at {{convert|0.523|lb/hp|abbr=on|order=flip}} per hour,&lt;ref name="IMGT"&gt;Naval Education and Training Program Development Center ''Introduction to Marine Gas Turbines'' (1978) Naval Education and Training Support Command, pp. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and power output was higher than expected at {{convert|7514|shp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}} due to the ambient temperature of the North Sea route being lower than the design temperature of the gas turbine. This gave the ship a speed capability of 18 knots, up from 11 knots with the original power plant, and well in excess of the 15 knot targeted. The ship made its first transatlantic crossing with an average speed of 16.8 knots, in spite of some rough weather along the way. Suitable Bunker C fuel was only available at limited ports because the quality of the fuel was of a critical nature. The fuel oil also had to be treated on board to reduce contaminants and this was a labor-intensive process that was not suitable for automation at the time. Ultimately, the variable-pitch propeller, which was of a new and untested design, ended the trial, as three consecutive annual inspections revealed stress-cracking. This did not reflect poorly on the marine-propulsion gas-turbine concept though, and the trial was a success overall. The success of this trial opened the way for more development by GE on the use of HD gas turbines for marine use with heavy fuels.&lt;ref name="Innovation"&gt;National Research Council (U.S.) ''Innovation in the Maritime Industry'' (1979) Maritime Transportation Research Board, pp. 127-131&lt;/ref&gt; The ''John Sergeant'' was scrapped in 1972 at Portsmouth PA.

[[File:20091105-TurboJET Urzela.jpg|thumb|Boeing Jetfoil 929-100-007 ''Urzela'' of [[TurboJET]]]]
[[Boeing]] launched its first passenger-carrying [[Pump-jet|waterjet]]-propelled [[hydrofoil]] [[Boeing 929]], in April 1974. Those ships were powered by two [[Allison 501]]-KF gas turbines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.boeing.com/history/products/jetfoil-hydrofoil.page |title= Jetfoil/hydrofoil Historical Snapshot |publisher= Boeing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1971 and 1981, [[Seatrain Lines]] operated a scheduled [[intermodal container|container]] service between ports on the eastern seaboard of the United States and ports in northwest Europe across the North Atlantic with four container ships of 26,000 tonnes DWT. Those ships were powered by twin [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]] gas turbines of the FT 4 series. The four ships in the class were named ''Euroliner'', ''Eurofreighter'', ''Asialiner'' and ''Asiafreighter''. Following the dramatic [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC) price increases of the mid-1970s, operations were constrained by rising fuel costs. Some modification of the engine systems on those ships was undertaken to permit the burning of a lower grade of fuel (i.e., [[Marine diesel oil|marine diesel]]). Reduction of fuel costs was successful using a different untested fuel in a marine gas turbine but maintenance costs increased with the fuel change. After 1981 the ships were sold and refitted with, what at the time, was more economical diesel-fueled engines but the increased engine size reduced cargo space.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The first passenger ferry to use a gas turbine was the [[GTS Finnjet|GTS ''Finnjet'']], built in 1977 and powered by two [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]] FT 4C-1 DLF turbines, generating {{convert|55000|kW|shp|abbr=on}} and propelling the ship to a speed of 31&amp;nbsp;knots. However, the Finnjet also illustrated the shortcomings of gas turbine propulsion in commercial craft, as high fuel prices made operating her unprofitable. After four years of service, additional diesel engines were installed on the ship to reduce running costs during the off-season. The Finnjet was also the first ship with a [[Combined diesel-electric and gas]] propulsion. Another example of commercial use of gas turbines in a passenger ship is [[Stena Line]]'s [[High-speed Sea Service|HSS class]] fastcraft ferries. HSS 1500-class ''Stena Explorer'', ''Stena Voyager'' and ''Stena Discovery'' vessels use [[combined gas and gas]] setups of twin [[General Electric|GE]] [[General Electric LM2500|LM2500]] plus GE LM1600 power for a total of {{convert|68000|kW|shp|abbr=on}}. The slightly smaller HSS 900-class ''Stena Carisma'', uses twin [[Asea Brown Boveri|ABB]]–[[STAL]] GT35 turbines rated at {{convert|34000|kW|shp|abbr=on}} gross. The ''Stena Discovery'' was withdrawn from service in 2007, another victim of too high fuel costs.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In July 2000 the [[Millennium (ship)|''Millennium'']] became the first [[cruise ship]] to be propelled by gas turbines, in a [[combined diesel and gas]] configuration. The liner [[RMS Queen Mary 2]] uses a combined diesel and gas configuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geae.com/aboutgeae/presscenter/marine/marine_20040316.html |title=GE - Aviation: GE Goes from Installation to Optimized Reliability for Cruise Ship Gas Turbine Installations |publisher=Geae.com |date=2004-03-16 |accessdate=2012-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416025534/http://www.geae.com/aboutgeae/presscenter/marine/marine_20040316.html |archivedate=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In marine racing applications the 2010 C5000 Mystic catamaran [[Miss GEICO]] uses two Lycoming T-55 turbines for its power system.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Advances in technology==
Gas turbine technology has steadily advanced since its inception and continues to evolve. Development is actively producing both smaller gas turbines and more powerful and efficient engines. Aiding in these advances are computer-based design (specifically [[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD]] and [[finite element analysis]]) and the development of advanced materials: Base materials with superior high-temperature strength (e.g., [[single-crystal]] [[superalloy]]s that exhibit [[yield strength anomaly]]) or [[thermal barrier coatings]] that protect the structural material from ever-higher temperatures. These advances allow higher [[compression ratio]]s and turbine inlet temperatures, more efficient combustion and better cooling of engine parts.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has contributed to substantial improvements in the performance and efficiency of Gas Turbine engine components through enhanced understanding of the complex viscous flow and heat transfer phenomena involved. For this reason, CFD is one of the key computational tool used in Design &amp; development of gas &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcltech.com/sites/default/files/CFD_for_Aero_Engines.pdf |title=CFD for Aero Engines |publisher=HCL Technologies |date=April 2011 |accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; turbine engines.

The simple-cycle efficiencies of early gas turbines were practically doubled by incorporating inter-cooling, regeneration (or recuperation), and reheating. These improvements, of course, come at the expense of increased initial and operation costs, and they cannot be justified unless the decrease in fuel costs offsets the increase in other costs. The relatively low fuel prices, the general desire in the industry to minimize installation costs, and the tremendous increase in the simple-cycle efficiency to about 40 percent left little desire for opting for these modifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Çengel |first1=Yunus A. |first2=Michael A. |last2=Boles. |title=9-8. Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach |edition= 7th |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2011 |pages=510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the emissions side, the challenge is to increase turbine inlet temperatures while at the same time reducing peak flame temperature in order to achieve lower NOx emissions and meet the latest emission regulations. In May 2011, [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] achieved a turbine inlet temperature of 1,600&amp;nbsp;°C on a 320 megawatt gas turbine, and 460 MW in gas turbine [[combined-cycle]] power generation applications in which gross [[thermal efficiency]] exceeds 60%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MHI Achieves 1,600°C Turbine Inlet Temperature in Test Operation of World's Highest Thermal Efficiency "J-Series" Gas Turbine |publisher=Mitsubishi Heavy Industries |date=2011-05-26 |url= http://www.mhi.co.jp/en/news/story/1105261435.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131113162749/http://www.mhi.co.jp/en/news/story/1105261435.html |archive-date=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compliant [[foil bearing]]s were commercially introduced to gas turbines in the 1990s. These can withstand over a hundred thousand start/stop cycles and have eliminated the need for an oil system. The application of microelectronics and [[power switching]] technology have enabled the development of commercially viable electricity generation by microturbines for distribution and vehicle propulsion.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The following are advantages and disadvantages of gas-turbine engines:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brain |first=Marshall |url= http://science.howstuffworks.com/turbine2.htm |title=How Gas Turbine Engines Work |publisher=Science.howstuffworks.com |date=2000-04-01 |accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===
* Very high [[power-to-weight ratio]] compared to reciprocating engines.
* Smaller than most reciprocating engines of the same power rating.
* Smooth rotation of the main shaft produces far less vibration than a reciprocating engine.
* Fewer moving parts than reciprocating engines results in lower maintenance cost and higher reliability/availability over its service life.
* Greater reliability, particularly in applications where sustained high power output is required.
* Waste heat is dissipated almost entirely in the exhaust. This results in a high-temperature exhaust stream that is very usable for boiling water in a [[combined cycle]], or for [[cogeneration]].
* Lower peak combustion pressures than reciprocating engines in general.
* High shaft speeds in smaller "free turbine units", although larger gas turbines employed in power generation operate at synchronous speeds.
* Low lubricating oil cost and consumption.
* Can run on a wide variety of fuels.
* Very low toxic emissions of CO and HC due to excess air, complete combustion and no "quench" of the flame on cold surfaces.

===Disadvantages===
* Core engine costs can be high due to use of exotic materials.
* Less efficient than reciprocating engines at idle speed.
* Longer startup than reciprocating engines.
* Less responsive to changes in power demand compared with reciprocating engines.
* Characteristic whine can be hard to suppress.

==Testing==
British, German, other national and international test codes are used to standardize the procedures and definitions used to test gas turbines. Selection of the test code to be used is an agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer, and has some significance to the design of the turbine and associated systems. In the United States, [[ASME]] has produced several performance test codes on gas turbines. This includes ASME PTC 22-2014. These ASME performance test codes have gained international recognition and acceptance for testing gas turbines. The single most important and differentiating characteristic of ASME performance test codes, including PTC 22, is that the test uncertainty of the measurement indicates the quality of the test and is not to be used as a commercial tolerance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25555">The '''[[gravitational interaction]] of antimatter''' with [[matter]] or [[antimatter]] has not been conclusively observed by physicists.  While the consensus among physicists is that gravity will attract both matter and antimatter at the same rate that matter attracts matter, there is a strong desire to confirm this experimentally.

Antimatter's rarity and tendency to [[annihilation|annihilate]] when brought into contact with matter makes its study a technically demanding task.  Most methods for the creation of antimatter (specifically [[antihydrogen]]) result in high-energy particles and atoms of high kinetic energy, which are unsuitable for [[gravity]]-related study.

Future experiments need to be performed with higher precision, either with beams of antihydrogen (AEGIS) or with trapped antihydrogen (ALPHA or GBAR).

In addition to uncertainty regarding whether antimatter is gravitationally attracted or repulsed from other matter, it is also unknown whether the magnitude of the gravitational force is the same.  Difficulties in creating [[quantum gravity]] theories have led to the idea that antimatter may react with a slightly different magnitude.&lt;ref name="nieto88"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nieto|first1=M.

== Theories of gravitational attraction ==
When antimatter was first discovered in 1932, physicists wondered about how it would react to gravity. Initial analysis focused on whether antimatter should react the same as matter or react oppositely. Several theoretical arguments arose which convinced physicists that antimatter would react exactly the same as normal matter. They inferred that a gravitational repulsion between matter and antimatter was implausible as it would violate [[CPT invariance]], [[conservation of energy]], result in [[vacuum instability]], and result in [[CP violation]]. It was also theorized that it would be inconsistent with the results of the [[Loránd Eötvös|Eötvös]] test of the [[weak equivalence principle]]. Many of these early theoretical objections were later overturned.&lt;ref name="nieto91"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nieto|first1=M. M.|last2=Goldman|first2=T.|title=The arguments against 'antigravity' and the gravitational acceleration of antimatter|journal=Physics Reports|date=1991|volume=205|issue=5|pages=221–281|doi=10.1016/0370-1573(91)90138-C|bibcode = 1991PhR...205..221N |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1258483/files/article.pdf}} Note: errata issued in 1992 in volume 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The equivalence principle ===
The [[equivalence principle]] predicts that the gravitational acceleration of antimatter is the same as that of ordinary matter. A matter-antimatter gravitational repulsion is thus excluded from this point of view. Furthermore, [[photon]]s, which are their own antiparticles in the framework of the Standard Model, have in a large number of astronomical tests ([[gravitational redshift]] and [[gravitational lensing]], for example) been observed to interact with the gravitational field of ordinary matter exactly as predicted by the [[general theory of relativity]]. This is a feature that has to be explained by any theory predicting that matter and antimatter repel.

=== CPT theorem ===
The [[CPT theorem]] implies that the difference between the properties of a matter particle and those of its antimatter counterpart is ''completely'' described by C-inversion. Since this C-inversion doesn't affect gravitational mass, the CPT theorem predicts that the gravitational mass of antimatter is the same as that of ordinary matter.&lt;ref name="cabbolet2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cabbolet|first1=M. J. T. F.|title=Elementary Process Theory: a formal axiomatic system with a potential application as a foundational framework for physics supporting gravitational repulsion of matter and antimatter|journal=Annalen der Physik|date=2010|volume=522|issue=10|pages=699–738|doi=10.1002/andp.201000063|bibcode = 2010AnP...522..699C }}&lt;/ref&gt; A repulsive gravity is then excluded, since that would imply a difference in sign between the observable gravitational mass of matter and antimatter.

=== Morrison's argument ===
In 1958, [[Philip Morrison]] argued that antigravity would violate [[conservation of energy]]. If matter and antimatter responded oppositely to a gravitational field, then it would take no energy to change the height of a particle-antiparticle pair. However, when moving through a gravitational potential, the frequency and energy of light is shifted. Morrison argued that energy would be created by [[pair production|producing]] matter and antimatter at one height and then annihilating it higher up, since the photons used in production would have less energy than the photons yielded from annihilation.&lt;ref name="morrison"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morrison|first1=P.|title=Approximate Nature of Physical Symmetries|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=1958|volume=26|issue=6|pages=358–368|doi=10.1119/1.1996159|bibcode = 1958AmJPh..26..358M }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later found that antigravity would still not violate the [[second law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name="chardin93"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chardin|first1=G.|title=CP violation and antigravity (revisited)|journal=Nuclear Physics A|date=1993|volume=558|pages=477–495|doi=10.1016/0375-9474(93)90415-T|bibcode = 1993NuPhA.558..477C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Schiff's argument ===
Later in 1958, [[Leonard I. Schiff|L. Schiff]] used quantum field theory to argue that antigravity would be inconsistent with the results of the [[Eötvös experiment]].&lt;ref name="schiff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schiff|first1=L. I.|title=Sign of the Gravitational Mass of a Positron|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=1958|volume=1|issue=7|pages=254–255|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.1.254|bibcode=1958PhRvL...1..254S}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the renormalization technique used in Schiff's analysis is heavily criticized, and his work is seen as inconclusive.&lt;ref name="nieto91" /&gt; In 2014 the argument was redone by [[Marcoen Cabbolet]], who concluded however that it merely demonstrates the incompatibility of the Standard Model and gravitational repulsion.&lt;ref name="cabbolet2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cabbolet|first1=M. J. T. F.|title=Incompatibility of QED/QCD and repulsive gravity, and implications for some recent approaches to dark energy|journal=Astrophysics and Space Science|date=2014|volume=350|issue=2|pages=777–780|doi=10.1007/s10509-014-1791-4|bibcode = 2014Ap&amp;SS.350..777C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Good's argument ===
In 1961, [[Myron L. Good]] argued that antigravity would result in the observation of an unacceptably high amount of [[CP violation]] in the anomalous regeneration of [[kaon]]s.&lt;ref name="good"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Good|first1=M. L.|authorlink1=Myron L. Good|title=''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and the Equivalence Principle|journal=Physical Review|date=1961|volume=121|issue=1|pages=311–313|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.121.311|bibcode = 1961PhRv..121..311G }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, CP violation had not yet been observed. However, Good's argument is criticized for being expressed in terms of absolute potentials. By rephrasing the argument in terms of relative potentials, [[Gabriel Chardin]] found that it resulted in an amount of kaon regeneration which agrees with observation.&lt;ref name="chardin92"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chardin|first1=G.|last2=Rax|first2=J.-M.|title=''CP'' violation. A matter of (anti)gravity?|journal=Physics Letters B|date=1992|volume=282|issue=1–2|pages=256–262|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(92)90510-B|bibcode = 1992PhLB..282..256C }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that antigravity is in fact a potential explanation for CP violation based on his models on K mesons. His results date back to 1992. Since then however, studies on CP violation mechanisms in the B mesons systems have fundamentally invalidated these explanations.

===Gerard 't Hooft's argument ===
According to [[Gerard 't Hooft]], every physicist recognizes immediately what is wrong with the idea of gravitational repulsion: if a ball is thrown high up in the air so that it falls back, then its motion is symmetric under time-reversal; and therefore, the ball falls also down in opposite time-direction.&lt;ref name="thooft2014"&gt;G. 't Hooft, [http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~hooft101/spookrijders.html Spookrijders in de wetenschap (in Dutch)], DUB (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Since a matter particle in opposite time-direction is an antiparticle, this proves according to 't Hooft that antimatter falls down on earth just like "normal" matter.
However, Cabbolet replied that 't Hooft's argument is false, and only proves that an anti-ball falls down on an anti-earth &amp;ndash; which is not disputed.&lt;ref name="Cabbolet2014b"&gt;M.J.T.F. Cabbolet, [https://www.dub.uu.nl/nl/opinie/t-hooft-slaat-plank-mis-blog-spookrijders-de-wetenschap 't Hooft slaat plank mis over spookrijders (in Dutch)], DUB (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories of gravitational repulsion ==
As long as repulsive gravity has not been refuted experimentally, one can speculate about physical principles that would bring about such a repulsion. Thus far, three radically different theories have been published.

===Kowitt's theory===
The first theory of repulsive gravity was a quantum theory published by [[Mark Kowitt]].&lt;ref name="Kowitt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kowitt|first1=M.|title=Gravitational repulsion and Dirac antimatter|journal=International Journal of Theoretical Physics|date=1996|volume=35|issue=3|pages=605–631|doi=10.1007/BF02082828|bibcode = 1996IJTP...35..605K }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this modified Dirac theory, Kowitt postulated that the positron is not a hole in the sea of electrons-with-negative-energy as in usual [[Dirac hole theory]], but instead is a hole in the sea of electrons-with-negative-energy-and-positive-gravitational-mass: this yields a modified C-inversion, by which the positron has positive energy but negative gravitational mass. Repulsive gravity is then described by adding extra terms (''m''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''Φ''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''A''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;) to the wave equation. The idea is that the wave function of a positron moving in the gravitational field of a matter particle evolves such that in time it becomes more probable to find the positron further away from the matter particle.

===Santilli and Villata's theory===
Classical theories of repulsive gravity have been published by [[Ruggero Santilli]] and [[Massimo Villata]].&lt;ref name="Santilli"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Santilli|first1=R.M.|title=A classical isodual theory of antimatter and its prediction of antigravity|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics A|date=1999|volume=14|issue=14|pages=2205–2238|doi=10.1142/S0217751X99001111|bibcode = 1999IJMPA..14.2205S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="villata"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Villata|first1=M.|title=CPT symmetry and antimatter gravity in general relativity|journal=EPL|date=2011|volume=94|issue=2|pages=20001|doi=10.1209/0295-5075/94/20001|arxiv = 1103.4937 |bibcode = 2011EL.....9420001V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="villata13"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Villata|first1=M.|title=On the nature of dark energy: the lattice Universe|journal=Astrophysics and Space Science|date=2013|volume=345|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1007/s10509-013-1388-3|arxiv = 1302.3515 |bibcode = 2013Ap&amp;SS.345....1V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="villata15"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Villata|first1=M.|title=The matter-antimatter interpretation of Kerr spacetime|journal=Annalen der Physik|date=2015|volume=527|issue=7–8|pages=507–512|doi=10.1002/andp.201500154|arxiv = 1403.4820 |bibcode = 2015AnP...527..507V }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both theories are extensions of [[General Relativity|general relativity]], and are experimentally indistinguishable. The general idea remains that gravity is the deflection of a continuous particle trajectory due to the curvature of spacetime, but antiparticles now 'live' in an inverted spacetime. The equation of motion for antiparticles is then obtained from the equation of motion of ordinary particles by applying the C, P, and T-operators (Villata) or by applying ''isodual maps'' (Santilli), which amounts to the same thing: the equation of motion for antiparticles then predicts a repulsion of matter and antimatter. It has to be taken that the ''observed'' trajectories of antiparticles are projections on ''our'' spacetime of the true trajectories in the inverted spacetime. However, it has been argued on methodological and ontological grounds that the area of application of Villata’s theory cannot be extended to include the microcosmos.&lt;ref name="cabbolet2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cabbolet|first1=M. J. T. F.|title=Comment to a paper of M. Villata on antigravity|journal=Astrophysics and Space Science|date=2011|volume=337|issue=1|pages=5–7|doi=10.1007/s10509-011-0939-8|arxiv = 1108.4543 |bibcode = 2012Ap&amp;SS.337....5C }}&lt;/ref&gt; These objections were subsequently dismissed by Villata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Villata|first1=M.|title=Reply to 'Comment to a paper of M.

===Cabbolet's theory===
The first non-classical, non-quantum physical principles underlying a matter-antimatter gravitational repulsion have been published by Marcoen Cabbolet.&lt;ref name="cabbolet2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cabbolet2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cabbolet|first1=M. J. T. F.|title=Addendum to the Elementary Process Theory|journal=Annalen der Physik|date=2011|volume=523|issue=12|pages=990–994|doi=10.1002/andp.201100194|bibcode = 2011AnP...523..990C }}&lt;/ref&gt; He introduces the Elementary Process Theory, which uses a new language for physics, i.e. a new mathematical formalism and new physical concepts, and which is incompatible with both quantum mechanics and general relativity.  The core idea is that nonzero rest mass particles such as electrons, protons, neutrons and their antimatter counterparts exhibit stepwise motion as they alternate between a particlelike state of rest and a wavelike state of motion. Gravitation then takes place in a wavelike state, and the theory allows, for example, that the wavelike states of protons and antiprotons interact differently with the earth’s gravitational field.

== Experiments ==

===Supernova 1987A===
One source of experimental evidence in favor of normal gravity was the observation of [[neutrinos]] from [[Supernova 1987A]]. In 1987, three neutrino detectors around the world simultaneously observed a cascade of neutrinos emanating from a [[supernova]] in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]. Although the supernova happened about 164,000 [[light years]] away, both neutrinos and antineutrinos seem to have been detected virtually simultaneously{{clarify|date=December 2013}}. If both were actually observed, then any difference in the gravitational interaction would have to be very small. However, neutrino detectors cannot distinguish perfectly between neutrinos and antineutrinos; in fact, [[Antineutrino|the two may be identical]]. Some physicists conservatively estimate that there is less than a 10% chance that no regular neutrinos were observed at all. Others estimate even lower probabilities, some as low as 1%.&lt;ref name="pakvasa"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pakvasa|first1=S.|last2=Simmons|first2=W. A.|last3=Weiler|first3=T. J.|title=Test of equivalence principle for neutrinos and antineutrinos|journal=Physical Review D|date=1989|volume=39|issue=6|pages=1761–1763|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.39.1761|bibcode = 1989PhRvD..39.1761P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, this accuracy is unlikely to be improved by duplicating the experiment any time soon. The [[Supernova remnant G1.9+0.3|last known supernova]] to occur at such a close range prior to Supernova 1987A was around 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reynolds|first1=S.

===Fairbank's experiments===
Physicist [[William M. Fairbank|William Fairbank]] attempted a laboratory experiment to directly measure the gravitational acceleration of [[electron]]s, with hopes of attempting the same method for positrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fairbank |first1=William M. |title=Experiments to Measure the Force of Gravity on Positrons |url=http://inspirehep.net/record/272662/files/Pages_from_C88-01-23_617-622.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their [[charge-to-mass ratio]] is so large that electromagnetic effects overwhelmed attempts to measure the impact of gravity on electrons.  Fairbank was never able to attempt the experiment with positrons.&lt;ref name="nieto91" /&gt;

It is difficult to directly observe gravitational forces at the particle level. For charged particles, the electromagnetic force overwhelms the much weaker gravitational interaction. Even antiparticles in neutral antimatter, such as antihydrogen, must be kept separate from their counterparts in the matter that forms the experimental equipment, which requires strong electromagnetic fields. These fields, e.g. in the form of atomic traps, exert forces on these antiparticles which easily overwhelm the gravitational force of Earth and nearby test masses. Since all production methods for antiparticles result in high-energy antimatter particles, the necessary cooling for observation of gravitational effects in a laboratory environment requires very elaborate experimental techniques and very careful control of the trapping fields.

===Cold neutral antihydrogen experiments===
Since 2010 the production of cold [[antihydrogen]] has become possible at the [[Antiproton Decelerator]] at [[CERN]]. Antihydrogen, which is electrically neutral, should make it possible to directly measure the gravitational attraction of antimatter particles to the matter Earth.  In 2013, experiments on antihydrogen atoms released from the ALPHA trap set direct, i.e. freefall, coarse limits on antimatter gravity.&lt;ref name="amole et al" /&gt; These limits were coarse, with a relative precision of ± 100%, thus, far from a clear statement even for the sign of gravity acting on antimatter. Future experiments at CERN with beams of antihydrogen, such as AEGIS, or with trapped antihydrogen, such as ALPHA and GBAR, have to improve the sensitivity to make a clear, scientific statement about gravity on antimatter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amos |first1=J.|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13666892 |title= Antimatter atoms are corralled even longer |publisher=BBC News Online |date=2011-06-06 |accessdate=2013-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Information Technology]] Auditing (IT auditing) began as [[Electronic data processing|Electronic Data Process]] (EDP) Auditing and developed largely as a result of the rise in technology in [[Accounting software|accounting systems]], the need for IT control, and the impact of [[computers]] on the ability to perform attestation services. The last few years have been an exciting time in the world of IT auditing as a result of the [[accounting]] scandals and increased regulation. IT auditing has had a relatively short yet rich history when compared to auditing as a whole and remains an ever-changing field.

The introduction of [[computer technology]] into accounting systems changed the way [[data]] was stored, retrieved and controlled. It is believed that the first use of a computerized accounting system was at [[General Electric]] in 1954. During the time period of 1954 to the mid-1960s, the auditing profession was still [[auditing]] around the computer. At this time only [[mainframe computer]]s were used and few people had the skills and abilities to [[Computer programming|program computers]]. This began to change in the mid-1960s with the introduction of new, smaller and less expensive machines. This increased the use of computers in businesses and with it came the need for [[auditors]] to become familiar with EDP concepts in [[business]]. Along with the increase in computer use, came the rise of different types of accounting systems. The industry soon realized that they needed to develop their own [[software]] and the first of the generalized audit software (GAS) was developed. In 1968, the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA) had the Big Eight (now the [[Big Four auditors|Big Four]]) accounting firms participate in the development of EDP auditing. The result of this was the release of ''Auditing &amp; EDP''. The book included how to document EDP audits and examples of how to process internal control reviews.

Around this time EDP auditors formed the Electronic Data Processing Auditors Association (EDPAA). The goal of the association was to produce guidelines, procedures and standards for EDP audits. In 1977, the first edition of ''Control Objectives'' was published. This publication is now known as [[COBIT|Control Objectives for Information and related Technology]] (CobiT).  CobiT is the set of generally accepted IT control objectives for IT auditors.  In 1994, EDPAA changed its name to Information Systems Audit and Control Association ([[ISACA]]). The period from the late 1960s through today has seen rapid changes in technology from the [[microcomputer]] and [[computer network|networking]] to the [[internet]] and with these changes came some major events that change IT auditing forever.

The formation and rise in popularity of the Internet and [[E-commerce]] have had significant influences on the growth of IT audit. The Internet influences the lives of most of the world and is a place of increased business, entertainment and crime.  IT auditing helps organizations and individuals on the Internet find security while helping commerce and communications to flourish.

== Major Events ==
There are five major events in U.S. history which have had significant impact on the growth of IT auditing. These are the Equity Funding scandal, the development of the Internet and E-commerce, the 1998 IT failure at [[AT&amp;T Corporation]], the [[Enron]] and [[Arthur Andersen|Arthur Andersen LLP]] scandal, and the [[September 11, 2001 Attacks]].

These events have not only heightened the need for more reliable, accurate, and secure systems but have brought a much needed focus to the importance of the accounting profession. Accountants certify the accuracy of public company [[financial statements]] and add confidence to [[financial markets]]. The heightened focus on the industry has brought improved control and higher standards for all working in accounting, especially those involved in IT auditing.

=== Equity Funding Corporation of America ===
The first known case of misuse of [[information technology]] occurred at [[Equity Funding|Equity Funding Corporation of America]]. Beginning in 1964 and continuing on until 1973, managers for the company booked false [[insurance policies]] to show greater [[Profit (accounting)|profits]], thus boosting the price of the [[stock]] of the company. If it wasn't for a [[whistle blower]], the fraud may have never been caught. After the [[fraud]] was discovered, it took the auditing firm [[Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu|Touche Ross]] two years to confirm that the insurance policies were not real. This was one of the first cases where auditors had to audit through the computer rather than around the computer.

=== AT&amp;T ===
In 1998 AT&amp;T suffered an IT failure that impacted worldwide [[commerce]] and [[communication]]. A major switch failed due to software and procedural errors and left many [[credit card]] users unable to access funds for upwards this brought to the forefront our reliance in IT services and reminds us of the need for assurance in our computer systems.

=== Enron and Arthur Andersen ===
The Enron and Arthur Andersen LLP scandal led to the demise of a foremost Accounting firm, an [[investor]] loss of more than 60 billion dollars and the largest [[bankruptcy]] in U.S. history. Arthur Andersen was recently found guilty of [[obstruction of justice]] for their role in the collapse of the energy giant. This scandal had a significant impact on the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] and was a major self-regulation violation.

In information systems, '''identity correlation''' is a process that reconciles and validates the proper ownership of disparate user account login IDs ([[user names]]) that reside on systems and applications throughout an organization and can permanently link ownership of those user account login IDs to particular individuals by assigning a [[unique identifier]] (also called primary or common keys) to all validated account login IDs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shon Harris|Harris, Shon]]. "CISSP Certification All-In-One Exam Guide, 4th Ed." (November 9, 2007), McGraw-Hill Osborne Media.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of identity correlation validates that individuals only have account login IDs for the appropriate systems and applications a user should have access to according to the organization’s business policies, [[access control]] policies and various application requirements.

A unique identifier, in the context of identity correlation, is any [[identifier]] which is guaranteed to be unique among all identifiers used for a group of individuals and for a specific purpose. There are three main types of unique identifiers, each corresponding to a different generation strategy:

* Serial numbers, assigned incrementally
* Random numbers, selected from a number space much larger than the maximum (or expected) number of objects to be identified. Although not really unique, some identifiers of this type may be appropriate for identifying objects in many practical applications, and so are referred to as “unique” within this context
* Name or codes allocated by choice, but are forced to be unique by keeping a central registry such as the [[EPC Information Services]] of the [[EPCglobal Network]]

For the purposes of identity correlation, a unique identifier is typically a [[serial number]] or random number selected from a number space much larger than the maximum number of individuals who will be identified. A unique identifier, in this context, is typically represented as an additional attribute in the directory associated with each particular data source. However, adding an attribute to each system-specific directory may affect application requirements or specific business requirements, depending on the requirements of the organization. Under these circumstances, unique identifiers may not be an acceptable addition to an organization.

== Basic Requirements of Identity Correlation ==

Identity Correlation involves several factors:

'''1. Linking Disparate Account IDs Across Multiple Systems or Applications'''

Many organizations must find a method to comply with audits that require it to link disparate application user identities with the actual people who are associated with those user identities.

Some individuals may have a fairly common first and/or last name, which makes it difficult to link the right individual to the appropriate account login ID, especially when those account login IDs are not linked to enough specific identity data to remain unique.

A typical construct of the login ID, for example, can be the 1st character of givenname + next 7 of sn, with incremental uniqueness. This would produce login IDs like jsmith12, jsmith 13, jsmith14, etc. for users John Smith, James Smith and Jack Smith, respectively.

Conversely, one individual might undergo a name change either formally or informally, which can cause new account login IDs that the individual appropriates to appear drastically different in nomenclature to the account login IDs that individual acquired prior to any change.

For example, a woman could get married and decide to use her new surname professionally. If her name was originally Mary Jones but she is now Mary Smith, she could call HR and ask them to update her contact information and email address with her new surname. This request would update her Microsoft Exchange login ID to mary.smith to reflect that surname change, but it might not actually update her information or login credentials in any other system she has access to. In this example, she could still be mjones in Active Directory and mj5678 in RACF.

Identity correlation should link the appropriate system account login IDs to individuals who might be indistinguishable, as well as to those individuals who might appear to be drastically different from a system-by-system standpoint, but should be associated with the same individual.

For more details on this topic, please see: [http://www.radiantlogic.com/website/media/documents/White%20Papers/Linking_Identities_to_Contexts.pdf The Second Wave: Linking Identities to Contexts]

'''2. Discovering Intentional and Unintentional Inconsistencies in Identity Data'''

Inconsistencies in identity data typically develop over time in organizations as applications are added, removed or changed and as individuals attain or retain an ever-changing stream of access rights as they matriculate into and out of the organization.

Application user login IDs do not always have a consistent syntax across different applications or systems and many user login IDs are not specific enough to directly correlate it back to one particular individual within an organization.

User data inconsistencies can also occur due to simple manual input errors, non-standard nomenclature, or name changes that might not be identically updated across all systems.

The identity correlation process should take these inconsistencies into account to link up identity data that might seem to be unrelated upon initial investigation.

'''3. Identifying Orphan or Defunct Account Login IDs'''

Organizations can expand and consolidate from mergers and acquisitions, which increases the complexity of business processes, policies and procedures as a result.

As an outcome of these events, users are subject to moving to different parts of the organization, attaining a new position within the organization, or matriculating out of the organization altogether. At the same time, each new application that is added has the potential to produce a new completely unique user ID.

Some identities may become redundant, others may be in violation of application-specific or more widespread departmental policies, others could be related to non-human or system account IDs, and still others may simply no longer be applicable for a particular user environment.

Projects that span different parts of the organization or focus on more than one application become difficult to implement because user identities are often not properly organized or recognized as being defunct due to changes in the business process.

An identity correlation process must identify all orphan or defunct account identities that no longer belong from such drastic shifts in an organization’s infrastructure.

'''4. Validating Individuals to their Appropriate Account IDs'''

Under such regulations as [[Sarbanes-Oxley]] and [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]], it is required for organizations to ensure the integrity of each user across all systems and account for all access a user has to various back-end systems and applications in an organization.

If implemented correctly, identity correlation will expose compliance issues. Auditors frequently ask organizations to account for who has access to what resources. For companies that have not already fully implemented an enterprise [[identity management]] solution, identity correlation and validation is required to adequately attest to the true state of an organization’s user base.

This validation process typically requires interaction with individuals within an organization who are familiar with the organization’s user base from an enterprise-wide perspective, as well as those individuals who are responsible and knowledgeable of each individual system and/or application-specific user base.

In addition, much of the validation process might ultimately involve direct communication with the individual in question to confirm particular identity data that is associated with that specific individual.

'''5. Assigning a unique primary or common key for every system or application Account ID that is attached to each individual'''

In response to various compliance pressures, organizations have an option to introduce unique identifiers for its entire user base to validate that each user belongs in each specific system or application in which he/she has login capabilities.

In order to effectuate such a policy, various individuals familiar with the organization’s entire user base, as well as each system-specific user-base, must be responsible for validating that certain identities should be linked together and other identities should be disassociated from each other.

Once the validation process is complete, a unique identifier can be assigned to that individual and his or her associated system-specific account login IDs.

== Approaches to Linking Disparate Account IDs ==

As mentioned above, in many organizations, users may sign into different systems and applications using different login IDs.  There are many reasons to link these into ``enterprise-wide'' user profiles.

There are a number of basic strategies to perform this correlation, or "ID Mapping:"

* Assume that account IDs are the same:
** In this case, mapping is trivial.
** This actually works in many organizations, in cases where a rigorous and standardized process has been used to assign IDs to new users for a long time.
* Import mapping data from an existing system:
** If an organization has implemented a robust process for mapping IDs to users over a long period, this data is already available and can be imported into any new [[Identity management]] system.
* Exact matching on attribute values:
** Find one identity attribute or a combination of attributes on one system which correlate to one or more attributes on another system.
** Connect IDs on the two systems by finding users whose attribute(s) are the same.
* Approximate matching on attribute values:
** The same as above, but instead of requiring attributes or expressions to match exactly, tolerate some differences.
** This allows for misspelled, inconsistently capitalized and otherwise somewhat diverse names and similar identity values.
** The risk here is that accounts which should not be connected will accidentally be matched by this process.
* Self-service login ID reconciliation:
** Invite users to fill in a form and indicate which IDs, on which systems, they own.
** Users might lie or make mistakes—so it's important to validate user input, for example by asking users to also provide passwords and to check those passwords.
** Users might not recognize system names—so it's important to offer alternatives or ask users for IDs+passwords in general, rather than asking them to specify which system those IDs are for.
* Hire a consultant and/or do it manually:
** This still leaves open the question of where the data comes from—perhaps by interviewing every user in question?

== Common Barriers to Performing Identity Correlation ==

'''1. Privacy Concerns'''

Often, any process that requires an in-depth look into identity data brings up a concern for privacy and disclosure issues. Part of the identity correlation process infers that each particular data source will need to be compared against an authoritative data source to ensure consistency and validity against relevant corporate policies and access controls.

Any such comparison that involves an exposure of enterprise-wide, authoritative, HR-related identity data will require various non-disclosure agreements either internally or externally, depending on how an organization decides to undergo an identity correlation exercise.

Because authoritative data is frequently highly confidential and restricted, such concerns may bar the way from performing an identity correlation activity thoroughly and sufficiently.

'''2. Extensive Time and Effort Requirements'''

Most organizations experience difficulties understanding the inconsistencies and complexities that lie within their identity data across all of their data sources. Typically, the process can not be completed accurately or sufficiently by undergoing a manual comparison of two lists of identity data or even executing simple scripts to find matches between two different data sets. Even if an organization can dedicate full-time individuals to such an effort, the methodologies themselves usually do not expose an adequate enough percentage of defunct identities, validate an adequate enough percentage of matched identities, or identify system (non-person) account IDs to pass the typical requirements of an identity-related audit.

==See also==
*[[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]](SOX)
*[[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]] (GLBA)
*[[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]](HIPAA)
*[[Information Technology Audit]] (ITA)

Manual efforts to accomplish identity correlation require a great deal of time and people effort, and do not guarantee that the effort will be completed successfully or in a compliant fashion.

Because of this, automated identity correlation solutions have recently entered the marketplace to provide more effortless ways of handling identity correlation exercises.

Typical automated identity correlation solution functionality includes the following characteristics:

* Analysis and comparison of identities within multiple data sources
* Flexible match criteria definitions and assignments for any combination of [[data element]]s between any two data sources
* Easy connectivity either directly or indirectly to all permissible sources of data 
* Out-of-the-box reports and/or summaries of data match results
* Ability to manually override matched or unmatched data combinations
* Ability to view data results on fine-grained level
* Assignment of unique identifiers to pre-approved or manually validated matched data. 
* Export abilities to send verified user lists back to source systems and/or provisioning solutions
* Ability to customize [[data mapping]] techniques to refine data matches
* [[Role-based access control]]s built into the solution to regulate identity data exposures as data is loaded, analyzed, and validated by various individuals both inside and outside of the organization
* Ability to validate identity data against end-users more quickly or efficiently than through manual methodologies

== Three Methods of Identity Correlation Project Delivery ==

Identity correlation solutions can be implemented under three distinct delivery models. These delivery methodologies are designed to offer a solution that is flexible enough to correspond to various budget and staffing requirements, as well as meet both short and/or long-term project goals and initiatives.

'''Software Purchase''' – This is the classic Software Purchase model where an organization purchases a software license and runs the software within its own hardware infrastructure.

* Training is available and recommended
* Installation Services are optional

'''Identity Correlation as a Service (ICAS)''' – ICAS is a subscription-based service where a client connects to a secure infrastructure to load and run correlation activities. This offering provides full functionality offered by the identity correlation solution without owning and maintaining hardware and related support staff.

'''Turn-Key Identity Correlation''' – A [[Turn-key]] methodology requires a client to contract with and provide data to a solutions vendor to perform the required identity correlation activities. Once completed, the solutions vendor will return correlated data, identify mismatches, and provide data integrity reports.

Validation activities will still require some direct feedback from individuals within the organization who understand the state of the organizational user base from an enterprise-wide viewpoint, as well as those individuals within the organization who are familiar with each system-specific user base.  In addition, some validation activities might require direct feedback from individuals within the user base itself.

A Turn-Key solution can be performed as a single one-time activity or monthly, quarterly, or even as part of an organization’s annual validation activities. Additional services are available, such as:

*Email Campaigns to help resolve data discrepancies
*Consolidated or merged list generation

'''Lowepro''' is a brand of carrying bags for [[camera]]s, laptops, imaging accessories and portable consumer electronics with corporate headquarters in [[Petaluma|Petaluma, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northbaybusinessjournal.com/28383/longtime-camera-bag-maker-lowepro-expands-in-petaluma/ Longtime camera bag-maker Lowepro expands in Petaluma] North Bay Business Journal.

==History of the company==
Lowepro camera bags began as an offshoot of [[Lowe Alpine|Lowe Alpine Systems]], an outdoor equipment manufacturer founded by Mike, Greg and Jeff Lowe in suburban Denver (Colorado) in 1967. In the 1960s, the Lowe brothers were known in outdoor circles for their climbing, skiing and photography. In 1967, [[Greg Lowe (climber)|Greg Lowe]] invented the world’s first close-fitting [[Backpack|internal-frame backpack]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} He used the same design principles to create the Lowepro line of protective camera bags as he often carried photographic equipment on hikes and climbs in the backcountry of the Western United States. The first bag marketed for cameras was manufactured in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Compass: Charting the Evolution of Outdoor Gear [http://homepage.mac.com/inov8/Compass/lowehistory.html Lowe Alpine History]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Uwe Mummenhoff and DayMen Photo Marketing Inc. gained exclusive rights to produce Lowepro products under license in Canada. In 1989, Lowepro U.S.A. became a wholly owned subsidiary of DayMen Photo Marketing and was established as a corporation; the Lowepro registered trademark was bought in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketnews.ca/content/index/page?pid=1747 Daymen Celebrates 25th Anniversary], Marketnews: March 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brockway Moran &amp; Partners]] invested in DayMen in partnership with management in October 2010.

==Products==
Lowepro produces various ranges of bags. Originally producing bags for traditional cameras, the brand has evolved to create bags which house compact digital cameras, [[smartphones]], and even [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|drones]] and quadcopters.

The Slingshot range is aimed at professional news and sports photographers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cheesman|first=Chris|title=Lowepro debuts new DSLR bag|url=http://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/photo-news/537990/lowepro-debuts-new-dslr-bag|work=Amateur Photographer|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing easy access to cameras for rapid shooting; CNet found the SlingShot 300 AW Camera Bag offered good protection and easy access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SlingShot 300 AW Camera Bag review|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-camera-accessories/slingshot-300-aw-camera/4505-6447_7-32167971.html?|work=CNet|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FastPack is a rucksack-style range, which CNet found less refined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lowepro Fastpack 250|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-camera-accessories/lowepro-fastpack-250-red/4505-6447_7-32907578.html?|work=CNet|accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary}}A '''makeover''' is a radical change in appearance. When the word is used to describe a change in [[human physical appearance]], it may imply a change in clothing, [[haircut]], or [[cosmetics]]. A personal makeover might also include [[cosmetic surgery]], [[Veneer (dentistry)|dental veneers]], or [[Contact lens|contact lenses]]. Sometimes a makeover is used to refer to non-physical things, such as a makeover of character, personality or attitude. It can also refer to a dramatic change in construction, such as when a building is renovated or is refurbished. Makeovers are usually referred to in a positive manner, as a way to start fresh or improve your life.


==In media==

===Television===
Makeovers are often popular [[television]] subjects. Long a staple subject of daytime [[Talk show|talk shows]], they have recently moved into the [[limelight]] in television shows such as ''[[Queer Eye]]''. Other popular makeover shows include ''[[What Not to Wear (UK)|What Not to Wear]]'', ''[[How to Look Good Naked]]'', ''[[Extreme Makeover]]'', ''[[Made (TV series)|MADE]]'', ''[[Ambush Makeover]]'' and ''[[Pimp My Ride]]''&lt;ref&gt;Huey, Ryan. "Pimp My Ride." ''St. James Encyclopedia of Hip Hop Culture'', edited by Thomas Riggs, St. James Press, 2018, pp. 359-361. ''Gale Virtual Reference Library'', &lt;nowiki&gt;http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/CX3679700167/GPS?u=orov49112&amp;sid=GPS&amp;xid=2a6364c3&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Accessed 21 Sept. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;. There is also a category of reality TV based on giving makeovers to homes, such as [[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]], [[60 Minute Makeover]] and [[Property Brothers]].

See [[makeover reality television series]].

Computer software and online tools can also be used for performing what are known as '''Virtual Makeovers'''. Using a photograph of a human face, software can apply cosmetics, hairstyles, and various eye wear such as contact lenses and sunglasses in order to allow users to visualize different looks without physically trying them on. Today, virtual makeup works in real-time using phone camera tracking, and examples are Visage Technologies's MakeApp, [[L'Oreal]]'s Makeup Genius&lt;ref&gt;"L'OREAL PARTNERS WITH VIVA TECHNOLOGY START UP CONNECT." ''ENP Newswire'', 15 June 2016. ''Health Reference Center Academic'', &lt;nowiki&gt;http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A455194696/GPS?u=orov49112&amp;sid=GPS&amp;xid=bceb66fb&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Accessed 19 Oct. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Oriflame]]'s Makeup Wizard.

=== Movies ===
In movies there is a common [[trope (cinema)|trope]] of a character, usually a girl, undergoing a dramatic makeover in appearance or personality. Here are some examples of movies with this trope.

* [[Now, Voyager]]

* [[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]

* [[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]

* [[Grease (film)|Grease]]

* [[The Breakfast Club]]

* [[The Princess Diaries (film)|-The Princess Diaries]]

* [[Mean Girls]]

* [[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]

===Books===
There is also a series of books, aimed at teenage girls, called ''The Makeover Series'', written by [[Suzanne Weyn]]. There are several experts who perform the art of makeovers. Usually makeover artists specialize in hair styling, make-up or clothing.

"The Makeover Guy" is a registered trademark for author and makeover expert [[Christopher Hopkins]] who is known for his television head-to-toe makeovers. He has a book called "Staging Your Comeback: A Complete Beauty Revival for Women Over 45".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/171614456|title=Staging your comeback : a complete beauty revival for women over 45|last=Christopher.|first=Hopkins,|date=2008|publisher=Health Communications|isbn=9780757306341|location=Deerfield Beach, FL|oclc=171614456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
===Casting===
Like its adult counterpart, at its inception ''MasterChef Junior'' was judged by [[Gordon Ramsay]], [[Joe Bastianich]] and [[Graham Elliot]].&lt;ref name="officialwebsite"/&gt; Bastianich did not return for the show's fourth season, being replaced by prominent pastry chef [[Christina Tosi]].&lt;ref name="deadline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/01/masterchef-junior-renewed-season-4-christina-tosi-judge-1201349004/|title=‘MasterChef Junior’ Renewed For Season 4, Christina Tosi Joins As New Judge   – Deadline|author=Nellie Andreeva|work=Deadline|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elliot did not return for the show's fifth season. For the sixth season, Bastianich returned to his judging position.

===Production===
Fox placed casting calls for participants in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebraiser.com/junior-masterchef-auditions-gordon-ramsay/|title=MasterChef Now Casting For Children For Gordon Ramsay To Emotionally Destroy|last=Nguyen|first=Tina|publisher=TheBraiser.com|date=January 18, 2013|accessdate=August 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox officially ordered the series (then under the name ''Junior MasterChef'') on May 10, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/fox-gordon-ramsay-to-cook-up-junior-masterchef-1200479164/|title=Fox, Gordon Ramsay to Cook Up 'Junior Masterchef'|last=Marechal|first=AJ|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Variety Media|date=May 10, 2013|accessdate=August 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was later changed to ''MasterChef Junior''. There were concerns that Ramsay's style of cursing at the contestants on his other competition shows (most notably ''[[Hell's Kitchen (U.S. TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'' and the [[MasterChef (U.S. TV series)|adult ''MasterChef'']]) would carry over to ''MasterChef Junior''. It did not. One contestant (named Gavin) said that Ramsay had only cursed twice during the production of the series and never at the contestants. In the final editing, he cursed once in front of (but not at) the contestants.&lt;ref name="tca"/&gt;

The '''New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD)''' is a Cabinet Department under the [[Governor of New Mexico]]. EMNRD oversees and protects the natural and energy resources of New Mexico. EMNRD provides Statewide leadership in the protection, management, and conservation of all such resources.

The Department is led by the Cabinet Secretary of Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources. The Cabinet Secretary is appointed by the Governor, with the approval of the [[New Mexico State Senate]], to serve at his/her pleasure. The current Cabinet Secretary is Dave Martin.

==History==
The New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department was created by the enactment of the ''Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department Act''. The Act merged the Energy and Minerals Department and the Natural Resources Department into a single unified entity.

The mission of EMNRD is to protect, manage, conserve and oversee the responsible use of the state’s natural
resources. EMNRD is charged with:
*protecting the environment and ensuring the reclamation of land and resources affected by mining activities 
*growing and sustaining healthy forests
*leading the development of reliable energy

==Overview==
The EMNRD has six main missions: 
*Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency
*Health Forests
*State Parks
*Mine Reclamation
*Oil and Gas Conservation
*Program Support 

For administrative support purposes only, the [[New Mexico Department of Game and Fish]] is attached to EMNRD.

===Renewable Energy===
The Energy Conservation and Management Division provides the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Program of EMNRD. The Division oversee Statewide energy conservation efforts including the use of alternative fuels. These fuels include solar, wind, geothermal, and biomass resources. This is accomplished via partnerships with private businesses, higher education universities, and research laboratories to invest in clean energy.

The Division serves as the [[United States Department of Energy]] state administering agency for [[State Energy Program (United States)|federal energy grants]].

===Healthy Forests===
The Healthy Forests Program is responsible for the protection of all State Forests. The Program is responsible for statewide fire management and suppression activities as well as overall tree health. The Program also oversee all forest restoration efforts.

===State Parks===
The State Parks Program oversees the operations of State Parks across the State. These State Parks are designed to protect and preserve the State's natural environment.

===Mining and Minerals===
The Mining and Minerals Division operates the Department's Mine Reclamation Program. The Division oversees all energy and non-energy mining operations in the State. This is accomplished by issuing permits to mining companies, inspecting mining operations, reclaiming abandoned mines, and education members of the public about mining. New Mexico heavily benefits from mined natural resources such as oil, copper, coal, petroleum, potash, molybdenum, uranium, gold, silver, and lead.

===Oil and Gas===
The Oil Conservation Division oversees all oil, gas, and geothermal drilling operations in the State. This is accomplished by issuing permits to drilling companies, inspecting drilling operations, protecting mineral rights, and preventing fresh water contamination.

The Division is composed of an Administrative and Records Bureau, a Fiscal Bureau, an Engineering and Geological Services Bureau, and Environmental Bureau, a Legal Bureau, and four District Offices.

===Program Support===
The Program Support Program provides centralized administrative and management support to all other aspects of the Department.

==Organization==
The head of EMNRD is the Cabinet Secretary of Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources. The Cabinet Secretary is appointed by the [[Governor of New Mexico]], with the approval of the [[New Mexico State Senate]], and serves as a member of the Governor's Cabinet. 

The Cabinet Secretary is assisted by a Deputy Secretary and six Division Directors. Each of the Division Directors is appointed by the Cabinet Secretary with the approval of the Governor.

==Uses==
Spoilage microorganisms and some enzymes can be deactivated by HPP, which can extend the shelf life while preserving the sensory and nutritional characteristics of the product &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Food Processing and Technology: Principles and Practices|last=Fellows|first=P.J.|publisher=Woodhead|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=12344-12733}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Pathogenic microorganisms such as ''Listeria, E. coli, Salmonella,'' and ''Vibrio'' are also sensitive to pressures of 400-1000 MPa used during HPP&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Developments in High Pressure Food Processing|last=Schaschke|first=Carl|publisher=[[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]]|year=2010|isbn=978-1-61761-706-5|location=New York|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Thus, HPP can pasteurize food products with decreased processing time, reduced energy usage, and less waste &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The treatment occurs at low temperatures and does not include the use of [[food additives]]. From 1990, some juices, jellies, and jams have been preserved using pascalization in Japan. The technique is now used there to preserve fish and meats, [[salad dressing]], [[rice cake]]s, and [[yogurt]]s.  HPP is now being used to preserve fruit and vegetable smoothies and other products such as meat for sale in the UK.&lt;ref name="Savse"&gt;[http://savse.com/our-story/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sealpac"&gt;[http://www.sealpac-uk.com/HPP.html]&lt;/ref&gt; An early use of pascalization in the United States was to treat [[guacamole]]. It did not change the guacamole's taste, texture, or color, but the [[shelf life]] of the product increased to thirty days, from three days without the treatment.&lt;ref name="Brown 546" /&gt; However, some treated foods still require cold storage because pascalization does not stop all enzyme activity caused by [[protein]]s,&lt;ref name="Fellows 217" /&gt; some of which affects shelf life.&lt;ref name="Adams 80"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|Moss|2007|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, HPP has also been used in the processing of [[Raw feeding|raw pet food]]. Most commercial frozen and freeze-dried raw diets now go through post-packaging HPP treatment to destroy potential bacteria and viruses contaminants, with salmonella being one of the biggest concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Higgins|first=Kevin|date=2010|title=Fresh, Safe Food for Fido|url=|journal=Food Engineering|volume=82|pages=17-18|via=PRIMO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Late 1800s===
Experiments into the effects of pressure on microorganisms have been recorded as early as 1884,&lt;ref name="Jay 457"&gt;{{harvnb|Jay|Loessner|Golden|2005|p=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; and successful experiments since 1897. In 1899, B. H. Hite was the first to conclusively demonstrate the inactivation of microorganisms by pressure. After he reported the effects of high pressure on microorganisms, reports on the effects of pressure on foods quickly followed. Hite tried to prevent milk from spoiling, and his work showed that microorganisms can be deactivated by subjecting it to high pressure. He also mentioned some advantages of pressure-treating foods, such as the lack of [[antiseptic]]s and no change in taste.&lt;ref name="Hendrickx 13"&gt;{{harvnb|Hendrickx|Knorr|2002|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hite said that, since 1897, a chemist at the West Virginia Agricultural Experimental Station had been studying the relationship between pressure and the preservation of meats, juices, and milk. Early experiments involved inserting a large screw into a cylinder and keeping it there for several days, but this did not have any effect in stopping the milk from spoiling. Later, a more powerful apparatus was able to subject the milk to higher pressures, and the treated milk was reported to stay sweeter for 24–60 hours longer than untreated milk. When {{convert|90|ST|MT}} of pressure was applied to samples of milk for one hour, they stayed sweet for one week. Unfortunately, the device used to induce pressure was later damaged when researchers tried to test its effects on other products.&lt;ref name="Hendrickx 14" /&gt;

Experiments were also performed with [[anthrax]], [[typhoid]], and [[tuberculosis]], which was a potential health risk for the researchers. Indeed, before the process was improved, one employee of the Experimental Station became ill with typhoid fever.&lt;ref name="Hendrickx 14"&gt;{{harvnb|Hendrickx|Knorr|2002|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process that Hite reported on was not feasible for widespread use and did not always completely sterilize the milk. While more extensive investigations followed, the original study into milk was largely discontinued due to concerns over its effectiveness. Hite mentioned "certain slow changes in the milk" related to "enzymes that the pressure could not destroy".&lt;ref name="Hendrickx 14/15"&gt;{{harvnb|Hendrickx|Knorr|2002|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 1900s===
Hite et al. released a more detailed report on pressure sterilization in 1914, which included the number of microorganisms that remained in a product after treatment. Experiments were conducted on various other foods, including fruits, fruit juices, and some vegetables. They were met with mixed success, similar to the results obtained from the earlier tests on milk. While some foods were preserved, others were not, possibly due to bacterial spores that had not been killed.&lt;ref name="Hendrickx 15"&gt;{{harvnb|Hendrickx|Knorr|2002|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hite's 1914 investigation led to other studies into the effect of pressure on microorganisms. In 1918, a study published by W. P. Larson et al. was intended to help advance [[vaccine]]s. This report showed that bacterial spores were not always inactivated by pressure, while vegetative bacteria were usually killed. Larson et al.'s investigation also focused on the use of [[carbon dioxide]], [[hydrogen]], and [[nitrogen]] gas pressures. Carbon dioxide was found to be the most effective of the three at inactivating microorganisms.&lt;ref name="Hendrickx 16"&gt;{{harvnb|Hendrickx|Knorr|2002|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 1900s–today===
Around 1970, researchers renewed their efforts in studying bacterial spores after it was discovered that using moderate pressures was more effective than using higher pressures. These spores, which caused a lack of preservation in the earlier experiments, were inactivated faster by moderate pressure, but in a manner different from what occurred with vegetative microbes. When subjected to moderate pressures, bacterial spores [[Germinate#Spore germination|germinate]], and the resulting spores are easily killed using pressure, heat, or [[ionizing radiation]].&lt;ref name="Adams 94"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|Moss|2007|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hendrickx 17" /&gt; If the amount of initial pressure is increased, conditions are not ideal for germination, so the original spores must be killed instead. However, using moderate pressure does not always work, as some bacterial spores are more resistant to germination under pressure&lt;ref name="Hendrickx 17"&gt;{{harvnb|Hendrickx|Knorr|2002|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a small portion of them will survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smelt|first1=Jan P. P. M.|doi=10.1016/S0924-2244(98)00030-2|title=Recent advances in the microbiology of high pressure processing|journal=[[Trends in Food Science and Technology|Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology]]|volume=9|issue=4|pages=152–158|date=April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preservation method using both pressure and another treatment (such as heat) to kill spores has not yet been reliably achieved. Such a technique would allow for wider use of pressure on food and other potential advancements in food preservation.&lt;ref name="Hendrickx 18"&gt;{{harvnb|Hendrickx|Knorr|2002|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research into the effects of high pressures on microorganisms was largely focused on deep-sea organisms until the 1980s, when advancements in ceramic processing were made. This resulted in the production of machinery that allowed for processing foods at high pressures at a large scale, and generated some interest in the technique, especially in Japan.&lt;ref name="Adams 94" /&gt; Although commercial products preserved by pascalization first emerged in 1990,&lt;ref name="Fellows 217"&gt;{{harvnb|Fellows|2000|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; the technology behind pascalization is still being perfected for widespread use.&lt;ref name="Brown 546" /&gt; There is now higher demand for minimally processed products than in previous years,&lt;ref name="Jay 457" /&gt; and products preserved by pascalization have seen commercial success despite being priced significantly higher than products treated with standard methods.&lt;ref name="Fellows 217" /&gt;

In the early 21st century, it was discovered that pascalization can separate the meat of shellfish from their shells.&lt;ref name="Lobster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workingwaterfront.com/articles/High-tech-process-shucks-Maine-lobster-competes-with-Canadians/11464/ |title=High-tech process "shucks" Maine lobster, competes with Canadians |publisher=Workingwaterfront.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lobsters, shrimp, crabs, etc. may be pascalized, and afterwards their raw meat will simply and easily slide whole right out of the cracked shell.

==Process==
In pascalization, food products are sealed and placed into a steel compartment containing a liquid, often water, and pumps are used to create pressure. The pumps may apply pressure constantly or intermittently.&lt;ref name="Jay 457" /&gt; The application of high [[hydrostatic pressure]]s (HHP) on a food product will kill many microorganisms, but the [[spore]]s are not destroyed&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Some bacterial spores may need to be separately treated with acid to prevent their reproduction. Pascalization works especially well on acidic foods, such as yogurts and fruits,&lt;ref name="Brown 547" /&gt; because pressure-tolerant spores are not able to live in environments with low [[pH]] levels.&lt;ref name="Adams 94/95"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|Moss|2007|pp=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment works equally well for both solid and liquid products.&lt;ref name="Jay 457" /&gt;

During pascalization, the food's proteins are [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]], [[hydrogen bond]]s are fortified, and [[Noncovalent bonding|noncovalent bonds]] in the food are disrupted, while the product's main structure remains intact.&lt;ref name="Brown 547" /&gt; Because pascalization is not heat-based, [[covalent bonds]] are not affected, causing no change in the food's taste.&lt;ref name="Jay 458"&gt;{{harvnb|Jay|Loessner|Golden|2005|p=458}}&lt;/ref&gt; This retention of intramolecular bonds means that HPP does not destroy vitamins, maintaining the nutritional value of the food.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; High hydrostatic pressure can affect muscle tissues by increasing the rate of [[lipid oxidation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ohshima|first1=Toshiaki|last2=Ushio |first2=Hideki|last3=Koizumi |first3=Chiaki|title=High-pressure processing of fish and fish products|doi=10.1016/0924-2244(93)90019-7|journal=Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology|volume=4|issue=11|pages=370–375|date=November 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn leads to poor flavor and decreased health benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Henry|Chapman|2002|p=442}}&lt;/ref&gt;Additionally, there are some compounds present in foods that are subject to change during the treatment process. For example, carbohydrates are gelatinized by an increase in pressure instead of increasing the temperature during the treatment process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muntean|first=Mircea-Valentin|last2=Marian|first2=Ovidiu|last3=Barbieru|first3=Victor|last4=Cătunescu|first4=Giorgiana M.|last5=Ranta|first5=Ovidiu|last6=Drocas|first6=Ioan|last7=Terhes|first7=Sorin|title=High Pressure Processing in Food Industry – Characteristics and Applications|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aaspro.2016.09.077|journal=Agriculture and Agricultural Science Procedia|volume=10|pages=377–383|doi=10.1016/j.aaspro.2016.09.077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because hydrostatic pressure is able to act quickly and evenly on food, neither the size of a product's container nor its thickness play a role in the effectiveness of pascalization. There are several side effects of the process, including a slight increase in a product's sweetness, but pascalization does not greatly affect the nutritional value, taste, texture, and appearance. As a result, high pressure treatment of foods is regarded as a "natural" preservation method, as it does not use chemical preservatives.&lt;ref name="Adams 94" /&gt;

==Criticism==
Anurag Sharma, a geochemist, James Scott, a microbiologist, and others at the Carnegie Institution of Washington directly observed microbial activity at pressures in excess of 1 gigapascal.&lt;ref name="sharma"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Sharma, A.|title = Microbial activity at Gigapascal pressures|journal = Science|pages = 1514–1516|year = 2002|doi=10.1126/science.1068018|volume = 295|issue = 5559|pmid = 11859192|bibcode = 2002Sci...295.1514S |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments were performed up to 1.6 GPa (232,000 psi) of pressure, which is more than 16,000 times [[Atmosphere (unit)|normal air pressure]], or about 14 times the pressure in [[Mariana trench|the deepest ocean trench]].

The experiment began by depositing an ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Shewanella oneidensis]]'' film in a [[Diamond Anvil Cell]] (DAC). The pressure was then raised to 1.6 GPa. When raised to this pressure and kept there for 30 hours, at least 1% of the bacteria survived. The experimenters then monitored formate metabolism using in-situ [[Raman spectroscopy]] and showed that formate metabolism continued in the bacterial sample.

Moreover, 1.6 GPa is such great pressure that during the experiment the DAC turned the solution into [[Ice IV|ice-IV]], a room-temperature ice. When the bacteria broke down the formate in the ice, liquid pockets would form because of the chemical reaction.&lt;ref name="couz"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Couzin, J. |title = Weight of the world on microbes' shoulders|journal = Science|pages = 1444–1445|year = 2002|doi=10.1126/science.295.5559.1444b|volume = 295|issue = 5559|pmid = 11859165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was some skepticism of this experiment. According to Art Yayanos, an oceanographer at the [[Scripps Institute of Oceanography]], an organism should only be considered living if it can reproduce. Another issue with the DAC experiment is that when high pressures occur, there are usually high temperatures present as well, but in this experiment there were not. This experiment was performed at room-temperature. However, the intentional lack of high temperature in the experiments isolated the actual effects of pressure on life and results clearly indicated life to be largely pressure insensitive.&lt;ref name="couz"/&gt;

Newer results from independent research groups &lt;ref name="vanlint"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Vanlinit, D.|title = Rapid Acquisition of Gigapascal-High-Pressure Resistance by Escherichia coli|journal = mBio|pages = e00130-10|year = 2011|doi= 10.1128/mBio.00130-10|volume = 2|issue = 1|display-authors=etal|pmid=21264062|pmc=3025523}}&lt;/ref&gt; have confirmed Sharma et al. (2002).&lt;ref name="sharma" /&gt; This is a significant step that reiterates the need for a new approach to the old problem of studying environmental extremes through experiments. There is practically no debate whether microbial life can survive pressures up to 600 MPa, which has been shown over the last decade or so to be valid through a number of scattered publications.&lt;ref name="sharma" /&gt;

==Consumer acceptance of pascalization==
In the consumer studies of Hightech Europe consumers mentioned more positive than negative associations descriptions for this technology showing that these products are well accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hightecheurope.eu/documents.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121205013216/http://www.hightecheurope.eu/documents.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-05 |title=Documents |publisher=Hightecheurope.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Petoscope''' is an [[optoelectronic]] device for detecting small, distant objects such as flying aircraft. The design, as described in 1936,&lt;ref&gt;"Twin 'Eyes' Scan Sky for Planes", ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', Vol. 66, No. 2, {{ISSN|0032-4558}}, Hearst Magazines, August 1936&lt;/ref&gt; consisted of an instrument with two parallel light paths. In each path was a collimating [[objective lens]], a screen marked with many small, alternating opaque and transparent squares in a chequerboard pattern, and a second [[concentrating lens]] focused on a [[photocell]]. The two screens were inverted with respect to each other. This caused a small object in the instrument's field of view to produce differing signals in the two photocells, while a large object affected both light paths equally. The difference between the two signals was amplified and used to raise an alarm. At the beginning of [[World War II]], the device was adapted for use in [[proximity fuse]]s for bombs.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, R.W., "Early history of the proximity fuze (1937-40)", in ''Science, Measurement and Technology, IEE Proceedings A'', pub. May 1993, Volume: 140, Issue: 3, pages 224- 236, {{ISSN|0960-7641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inventor was Alan S. Fitzgerald of Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.,&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, A. S., "The Petoscope: A New Principle in Photoelectric Applications", ''[[Wireless Engineer]]'', Iliffe Electrical Publications, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent 2,016,036,was  issued 1 October 1935, [[USPTO]]&lt;/ref&gt; a Research Associate in Electrical Engineering at [[Swarthmore College]].&lt;ref&gt;Persifor Frazer, in ''Journal of the Franklin Institute'', Franklin Institute (Philadelphia, Pa.), 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

Corona capsules were [[mid-air retrieval|retrieved in mid-air]] as they floated down on [[parachute]]s. Later, spacecraft had digital imaging systems and downloaded the images via [[encrypted]] radio links.

In the United States, most information available is on programs that existed up to 1972, as this information has been [[Declassification|declassified]] due to its age. Some information about programs prior to that time is still [[classified information|classified]], and a small amount of information is available on subsequent missions.

A few up-to-date reconnaissance satellite images have been declassified on occasion, or leaked, as in the case of [[KH-11]] photographs which were sent to ''[[Jane's Defence Weekly]]'' in 1984.&lt;ref name="NYT-1985-Morison"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/08/weekinreview/the-nation-two-years-for-morison.html | title=Two Years for Morison | work=[[New York Times]] | date=8 December 1985 | accessdate=16 February 2014 | last1=Wright | first1=Michael | last2=Herron | first2=Caroline Rand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
On 16 March 1955, the [[United States Air Force]] officially ordered the development of an advanced reconnaissance satellite to provide continuous surveillance of "preselected areas of the Earth" in order "to determine the status of a potential enemy’s war-making capability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Into the Unknown Together - The DOD, NASA, and Early Spaceflight |last= Erickson |first= Mark |isbn= 1-58566-140-6 |url= http://aupress.au.af.mil/Books/Erickson/erickson.pdf |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090920093817/http://aupress.au.af.mil/Books/Erickson/erickson.pdf |archivedate= 20 September 2009 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
There are several major types of reconnaissance satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/science/reconnaissance-satellite.html |title=reconnaissance satellite |publisher=Infoplease |accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Missile Early warning
{{main|Defense Support Program|Space-Based Infrared System}}
:Provides warning of an attack by detecting [[ballistic missile]] launches. Earliest known are [[Missile Defense Alarm System]].

;Nuclear explosion detection
:Identifies and characterizes [[nuclear explosion]]s in space. [[Vela (satellite)]] is the earliest known.

;Photo surveillance
:Provides imaging of earth from space. Images can be a survey or close-look [[Telephoto lens|telephoto]]. [[Corona (satellite)]] is the earliest known. [[Spectral imaging]] is commonplace.

;Electronic-reconnaissance
:[[Signals intelligence]], intercepts stray [[radio]] waves. [[Samos-F]] is the earliest known.

;Radar imaging
:Most [[space-based radar]]s use [[synthetic aperture radar]]. Can be used at night or through [[cloud cover]]. Earliest known are the Soviet [[US-A]] series.

==Missions==
Examples of reconnaissance satellite missions:
* High resolution photography ([[IMINT]])
* Measurement and Signature Intelligence ([[MASINT]])
* Communications eavesdropping ([[Signals intelligence|SIGINT]])
* Covert communications
* Monitoring of [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty|nuclear test ban]] compliance (see [[National Technical Means]])
* Detection of missile launches

On 28 August 2013, it was thought that "a $1-billion high-powered spy satellite capable of snapping pictures detailed enough to distinguish the make and model of an automobile hundreds of miles below"&lt;ref name="LATimes-Rocket-2013"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/business/money/la-fi-mo-vandenberg-monster-rocket-launch-20130826,0,1005990.story | title=Monster rocket to blast off from Pacific coast, rattle Southland | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=27 August 2013 | accessdate=16 February 2014 | author=Hennigan, W.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; was launched  from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base using a Delta IV Heavy launcher, America's highest-payload space launch vehicle.

On 17 February 2014, a Russian Kosmos-1220 originally launched in 1980 and used for naval missile targeting until 1982, made an uncontrolled [[atmospheric entry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mashable.com/2014/02/16/russian-satellite-earth/ |title=Fragments of Soviet-Era Satellite Burn Up in Earth's Atmosphere |date=2014-02-17 |accessdate=2014-02-17 |publisher=[[Mashable]] |author=Melissa Goldin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
Reconnaissance satellites have been used to enforce human rights, through the [[Satellite Sentinel Project]], which monitors atrocities in [[Sudan]] and [[South Sudan]].

During his [[1980 State of the Union Address]], President [[Jimmy Carter]] explained how all of humanity benefited from the presence of American spy satellites:

{{quote|...photo-reconnaissance satellites, for example, are enormously important in stabilizing world affairs and thereby make a significant contribution to the security of all nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The State of the Union Annual Message to the Congress|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=33062|work=1980 State of the Union Address|publisher=The American Presidency Project|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Additionally, companies such as [[GeoEye]] and [[DigitalGlobe]] have provided commercial satellite imagery in support of natural disaster response and humanitarian missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commercial Satellite Imagery Companies Partner with the U.S. Geological Survey in Support of the International Charter "Space and Major Disasters"|url=http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=1647#.Uz81dlcvn84|work=USGS Newsroon|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s, a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] hoax had led to American fears of a [[bomber gap]]. In 1968, after gaining satellite photography, the United States' intelligence agencies were able to state with certainty that "No new [[ICBM]] complexes have been established in the [[USSR]] during the past year."{{r|heppenheimer1998}} President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] told a gathering in 1967:

{{quote|I wouldn't want to be quoted on this ... We've spent $35 or $40 billion on the space program. And if nothing else had come out of it except the knowledge that we gained from space photography, it would be worth ten times what the whole program has cost. Because tonight we know how many missiles the enemy has and, it turned out, [[missile gap|our guesses were way off]]. We were doing things we didn't need to do. We were building things we didn't need to build. We were harboring fears we didn't need to harbor.&lt;ref name="heppenheimer1998"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Space Shuttle Decision | publisher=NASA | author=Heppenheimer, T. A. | authorlink=T. A.

==In fiction==
Spy satellites are commonly seen in [[spy fiction]] and [[military fiction]]. Some works of fiction that focus specifically on spy satellites include:
* ''[[The OMAC Project]]''
* ''[[Enemy of the State (film)]]''
* ''[[Body of Lies (film)]]''
* ''[[Ice Station Zebra]]''
* ''[[Karlsson-on-the-Roof|Karlsson-on-the-Roof is Sneaking Around Again]]''

'''Rockland Community College''' is a [[community college]] in [[Ramapo, New York|Ramapo]], [[New York (state)|New York]].  It is part of the [[State University of New York]]. The college, established in 1959, became the 18th community college to join the SUNY system. The college offers 51 programs and offers [[associate degree]]s and certificates.  Additionally, students can earn other degrees, including [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Science]], and [[Master of Arts]] in the arts and sciences, Doctoral Program in Executive Leadership (EdD), technology, and health professions while attending classes at Rockland through articulation programs with four-year schools. The current enrollment is about 7,500 full and part-time students which includes about 125 International students from more than 50 foreign countries and approximately 800 high school enroll in credit courses.

The main campus is in Suffern, New York, but instructions are also offered at an extension sites in [[Haverstraw (village), New York|Haverstraw]] and [[Orangeburg, New York|Orangeburg]].  The Spring Valley satellite campus has been discontinued. It was located in the historic [[North Main Street School]].&lt;ref name="nrhpinv_ny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=102388|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: North Main Street School|date= July 2007|accessdate=May 28, 2010 |author=Nancy Goblet and William E. Krattinger|publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college has more than 525 full - and part-time faculty members, including several [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]] Scholars,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunyrockland.edu/about/the-college The College - Why Rockland Communuty College]&lt;/ref&gt; [[SUNY Chancellor's Award for Student Excellence|SUNY Chancellor's Award]] winners, and published authors and artists. The faculty-student ratio is 22:1. Rockland has the third highest transfer rate in the SUNY system and has a [[Continuing education|Continuing Education]] programs which served about 3,500 each year.

==History==
An institution called '''Rockland College''', chartered by the state [[Board of Regents]] in 1878, existed for sixteen years in [[Nyack, New York]].

'''Rockland Junior College''', supported by federal funds disbursed through New York State, and sponsored by [[Nyack High School]] was established in 1932 as one of several [[Great Depression|depression-era]] two-year schools. [[New York University]] and [[Syracuse University]] accepted two years of credit from the college. Rockland Junior College shut down in 1935.

Rockland Community College came eighteen years and later was organized to be an affordable, two-year college in location convenient for county residents; it was planned that it would raise taxes by only $4 a year.  At the time, Rockland County, the state's smallest in geographic area outside of [[New York City]], was growing exponentially in population and in demand for a skilled, educated work force.  Between 1956 and 1970, Rockland's population was one of the fastest growing in the state, expected to double from 107,000 to 215,000 and the number of high school graduates was projected to rise from 700 to 2,463.

Large local industries like [[Avon Products]] in Suffern and [[Wyeth|Lederle Laboratories]] in [[Pearl River, New York|Pearl River]] required more skilled workers, and the growth of hospitals such as [[NewYork–Presbyterian Healthcare System|Nyack Hospital]] and [[Good Samaritan Hospital (Suffern)|Good Samaritan Hospital]] in Suffern warranted the creation of a nursing program.

Some 69 percent of parents polled expressed interest in their children attending a community college in Rockland, and 183 high school juniors indicated a strong interest in and an ability to attend a community college in Rockland.

The course provides the opportunity to begin preparation for a career as a local police officer prior to being hired by a law enforcement agency. A [[Civil service examination|Civil service exam]] which students will be required to pass in order to be hired by a law enforcement agency, will be given upon completion of the course work at RCC. A candidate from the civil service list who has completed the coursework is more likely to be chosen by an agency, as he or she will not need to attend a twenty-three-week academy.

===SUNY COIL===
Rockland Community College is a participating campus of the SUNY COIL Center's Nodal Network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coil.suny.edu/nodal-campuses SUNY COIL Center's Nodal Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seniors adult programs==
Senior Adult Audits – Seniors over the age of 60 are eligible to take credit courses free of charge on a space available basis. The seniors are responsible for program fees, are required to meet pre-requisites and cannot enroll in contract courses.

Institute for Senior Education (I.S.E.) – The College's Institute for Senior Education (ISE) offers courses during the College's regular semesters at modest prices.  These informal groups meet once a week and stress independent study within a curriculum adjusted to the needs and interests of the group's members. All ISE courses are open to everyone over 50 years old.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6269">A '''school website''' is any [[website]] built, designed, and maintained by or for a [[school]]. Many school websites share certain characteristics, and some educators have developed guidelines to help schools create the best and most useful websites they can.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, N. 2006 "New rubric offers first functional standards for school web sites" ''eSchool News''&lt;/ref&gt;

Possible functions of a school website include:
* Displaying student projects
* Providing information on [[homework]] and current class assignments
* Directing visitors to other resources on the web
* Providing a forum for [[teacher]]s, administrators, students, and parents to exchange information such as news and calendars of events
* Introducing people who don't know much about the school (such as parent or students who are considering moving into the district, community members who don't have children, and teachers seeking employment) to its current events and general culture
* Showing that a school is excellent with regard to sciences and new media in comparison to competitive schools
* Providing a platform for internal school learning activities
* Displaying school curriculum and courses
* Providing staff and students with an entrance and front-end to documents and resources hosted locally
* Creating and showing in public a '[[corporate identity]]'.

==Creation and maintenance==
There are various ways in which a school can approach the task of creating a website.  Because they are educational institutions, the creation of portions of the website can be incorporated into the [[curriculum]]. Such innovation is gathering momentum in schools as educators become themselves more familiar with the technologies involved.

# '''CMS''' (or [[Content management systems for school websites|content management system]]) — Schools may purchase or create [[software]] to organize and display their information on the web. This software typically gives every administrator and teacher the ability to post on the school's site, using their own username and password. School sites of this kind tend to be the largest. However, since most webmasters of school websites are not specially trained for administrating a CMS, still about every second school website is maintained without using a CMS.
#  a school website provides an excellent possibility for pupils to learn not only webdesign but also how to work in a group of peers.
# '''Webmaster''' — Some schools ask a faculty or staff member who is particularly technologically savvy, or who works in their computer science department, to design and update their websites for them. While some technology coordinators do an excellent job of this, maintaining a school website is generally thought of as a rather large task for just one person.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, J. 1997 "Why in the World Wide Web?" ''Technology and Learning'' (6:6)&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with the maintenance is that maintaining a school website takes at least several hours a week but in most cases staff members are only paid for one or two hours.

==Obstacles and Potential==
School web sites, especially in the public sector, are generally under-developed. Lack of expertise among non-teaching staff has been a contributing factor, and many institutions have not acted to make their web presence a priority;  these schools perceive themselves as 'stretched' with respect to budgets and time. Requisite skills are sometimes available in the teaching staff, but the investment of their time is not adequately compensated, as stated above.
  
This general lack of commitment by schools to the internet reflects a limited perception of its capacity to provide educational outcomes for the school community. The 'school website' is viewed as a public face for the school - a more sophisticated newsletter or advertisement. In that regard it is not prioritized. There is now burgeoning interest in the tangible learning benefits a website can generate for a school, and the capacity a website affords for the streamlining of information access within and between faculties, schools and educational departments. Traditionally isolated teachers/faculties are able to network ideas and resources in ways that afford real professional development.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, J. 2010 "Teachers and the Web: An educational revolution that's real.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communication==
A school website is a communication tool between the school and community; however, its reach can extend beyond country, state lines. A school website may be used by many demographic groups such as staff/administration, parents, students, community, and potential, as well as, former students and alumni. Even across state lines a school website can connect groups of its demographics such as the alumni now living cross country looking for information on the next reunion.

==E-safety and Pupils==
E-safety should be addressed in the classroom, both directly within computing lessons and when it comes up using information technology in other subjects. Try to reinforce safe online behaviour on an ongoing basis. The ubiquity of information technology means that messages about its use need to be frequent to have an impact.

All pupils are different. Attitudes at home towards e-safety will vary hugely within a class, as will the experiences of children among their peers. It’s therefore important to start by finding out what pupils know, what they do online, and what is allowed at home. This can be a useful place for starting a discussion about what happens online.

Wherever they’re starting from, children need to learn certain key skills. How to filter their own online activity so as to not give away personal information, filter out certain types of incoming messages, and report inappropriate or illegal behaviour are vital skills for children going online. Recognising and responding to inappropriate behaviour is about more than inappropriate approaches from adults. Social media and online gaming, while potentially incredible outlets for creativity and self-expression, also contain some subcultures mired in bullying and prejudice. Learning to deal with this safely is a valuable life skill.

{{Culture of Scotland}}'''Scottish inventions and discoveries''' are objects, processes or techniques either partially or entirely invented, innovated or discovered by a person born in or descended from [[Scotland]]. In some cases, an invention's Scottishness is determined by the fact that it came into existence in Scotland (e.g., [[Cloning#Dolly the Sheep|animal cloning]]), by non-Scots working in the country. Often, things that are [[Discovery (observation)|discovered]] for the first time are also called "[[inventions]]" and in many cases there is no clear line between the two.

The Scots take enormous pride in the history of Scottish invention and discovery. There are many books devoted solely to the subject, as well as scores of websites listing Scottish inventions and discoveries with varying degrees of science.

Even before the [[Industrial Revolution]], Scots have been at the forefront of innovation and discovery across a wide range of spheres. Some of the most significant products of Scottish ingenuity include [[James Watt]]'s [[steam engine]], improving on that of [[Thomas Newcomen]],&lt;ref name="James Watt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/watt_james.shtml|title=BBC - History - James Watt|accessdate=2008-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[bicycle]],&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick Macmillan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/macmillan_kirkpatrick.shtml|title=BBC - History - Kirkpatrick Macmillan|accessdate=2008-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[macadamised|macadamisation]] (not to be confused with [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]] or tarmacadam&lt;ref name="John McAdam" /&gt;), [[Alexander Graham Bell]]'s invention of the first practical telephone,&lt;ref name=AHP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nls.uk/scientists/biographies/alexander-graham-bell/index.html|title=Scottish Science Hall of Fame - Alexander Graham Bell (1847-1922)|accessdate=2010-02-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zbRVYsAo?url=http://digital.nls.uk/scientists/biographies/alexander-graham-bell/index.html|archivedate=2011-06-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Logie Baird]]'s invention of television,&lt;ref name="John Logie Baird"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/baird_logie.shtml|title=BBC - History - John Logie Baird|accessdate=2008-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ADP&gt;[http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html The World's First High Definition Colour Television System].

[[File:MESSENGER 04pd1465.jpg|thumb|Sunshade of MESSENGER, orbiter of planet Mercury]]
In [[spacecraft]] design, the function of the '''thermal control system''' ('''TCS''') is to keep all the spacecraft's component systems within acceptable temperature ranges during all mission phases. It must cope with the external environment, which can vary in a wide range as the spacecraft is exposed to deep space or to solar or planetary flux, and with ejecting to space the internal heat generated by the operation of the spacecraft itself.

Thermal control is essential to guarantee the optimum performance and success of the mission because if a component is subjected to temperatures which are too high or too low, it could be damaged or its performance could be severely affected. Thermal control is also necessary to keep specific components (such as optical sensors, atomic clocks, etc.) within a specified temperature stability requirement, to ensure that they perform as efficiently as possible. 
 
The thermal control subsystem can be composed both of passive and of active items and works in two ways:
* protects the equipment from overheating, either by thermal insulation from external heat fluxes (such as the Sun or the planetary infrared and albedo flux), or by proper heat removal from internal sources (such as the heat emitted by the internal electronic equipment). 
* protects the equipment from temperatures that are too cold, by thermal insulation from external sinks, by enhanced heat absorption from external sources, or by heat release from internal sources.
'''Passive Thermal Control System''' ('''PTCS''') components include:
* [[Multi-layer insulation]] (MLI), which protects the spacecraft from excessive solar or planetary heating as well as from excessive cooling when exposed to deep space
* coatings that change the thermo-optical properties of external surfaces
* thermal fillers to improve the thermal coupling at selected interfaces (for instance on the thermal path between an electronic unit and its radiator)
* thermal washers to reduce the thermal coupling at selected interfaces
* thermal doublers to spread on the radiator surface the heat dissipated by equipment
* mirrors (secondary surface mirrors, SSM, or optical solar reflectors, OSR) to improve the heat rejection capability of the external radiators and at the same time to reduce the absorption of external solar fluxes
* [[radioisotope heater unit]]s (RHU), used by some planetary and exploratory missions to produce heat for TCS purposes
'''Active Thermal Control System''' ('''ATCS''') components include:
* thermostatically controlled resistive electric heaters to keep the equipment temperature above its lower limit during the mission's cold phases
* fluid loops to transfer the heat emitted by equipment to the radiators. They can be:
** single-phase loops, controlled by a pump
** two-phase loops, composed of [[heat pipe]]s (HP), [[loop heat pipe]]s (LHP) or capillary pumped loops (CPL)
* [[louver]]s (which change the heat rejection capability to space as a function of temperature)
* [[thermoelectric cooling|thermoelectric coolers]]

== Thermal Control Systems ==
* Environment interaction
** Includes the interaction of the external surfaces of the spacecraft to the environment. Either the surfaces need to be protected from the environment or there has to be improved interaction. Two main goals of environment interaction are the reduction or increase of absorbed environmental fluxes and reduction or increase of heat losses to the environment. 
*Heat collection 
**Includes the removal of dissipated heat from the equipment in which it is created to avoid unwanted increases in the spacecraft’s temperature. 
*Heat transport 
**Is taking the heat from where it is created to a radiating device. 
*Heat rejection 
**The heat collected and transported has to be rejected at an appropriate temperature to a heat sink, which is usually the surrounding space environment. The rejection temperature depends on the amount of heat involved, the temperature to be controlled and the temperature of the environment into which the device radiates the heat.
*Heat provision and storage.
**Is to maintain a desired temperature level where heat has to be provided and suitable heat storage capability has to be foreseen.

== Environment ==
For a spacecraft the main environmental interactions are the energy coming from the sun and the heat radiated to deep space. Other parameters also influence the thermal control system design such as the spacecraft’s altitude, orbit, attitude stabilization, and spacecraft shape. Different types of orbit, such as low earth orbit and geostationary orbit, also affect the design of the thermal control system. 
*Low Earth Orbit (LEO)
**This orbit is frequently used by spacecraft that monitor or measure the characteristics of the Earth and its surrounding environment and by unmanned and manned space laboratories, such as [[European Retrievable Carrier|EURECA]] and the International Space Station. The orbit's proximity to the Earth has a great influence on the thermal control system needs, with the Earth's infrared emission and albedo playing a very important role, as well as the relatively short orbital period, less than 2 hours, and long eclipse duration. Small instruments or spacecraft appendages such as solar panels that have low thermal inertia can be seriously affected by this continuously changing environment and may require very specific thermal design solutions.
*Geostationary orbit (GEO)
**In this 24-hour orbit, the Earth's influence is almost negligible except for the shadowing during eclipses, which can vary in duration from zero at solstice to a maximum of 1.2 hours at equinox. Long eclipses influence the design of both the spacecraft's insulation and heating systems. The seasonal variations in the direction and intensity of the solar input have a great impact on the design, complicating the heat transport by the need to convey most of the dissipated heat to the radiator in shadow, and the heat-rejection systems via the increased radiator area needed. Almost all telecommunications and many meteorological satellites are in this type of orbit.
*Highly Eccentric Orbits (HEO)
**These orbits can have a wide range of apogee and perigee altitudes, depending on the particular mission. Generally, they are used for astronomy observatories and the TCS design requirements depend on the spacecraft's orbital period, the number and duration of the eclipses, the relative attitude of Earth, Sun and spacecraft, the type of instruments onboard and their individual temperature requirements.
*Deep space and planetary exploration
**An interplanetary trajectory exposes spacecrafts to a wide range of thermal environment more severe than those encountered around earth’s orbits. Interplanetary mission includes many different sub-scenarios depending on the particular celestial body. In general, the common features are a long mission duration and the need to cope with extreme thermal conditions, such as cruises either close to or far away from the Sun (from 1 to 4–5 AU), low orbiting of very cold or very hot celestial bodies, descents through hostile atmospheres, and survival in the extreme (dusty, icy) environments on the surfaces of the bodies visited. The challenge for the TCS is to provide enough heat-rejection capability during the hot operating phases and yet still survive the cold inactive ones. The major problem is often the provision of the power required for that survival phase.

==Temperature Requirements==
The temperature requirements of the instruments and equipment on board are the main factors in the design of the thermal control system. The goal of the TCS is to keep all the instruments working within their allowable temperature range. All of the electronic instruments on board the spacecraft, such as cameras, data collection devices, batteries, etc., have a fixed operating temperature range. Keeping these instruments in their optimal operational temperature range is crucial for every mission. Some examples of temperature ranges include
*Batteries, which have a very narrow operating range, typically between −5 and 20˚C
*Propulsion components, which have a typical range of 5 to 40˚C for safety reasons, however, a wider range is acceptable
*Cameras, which have a range of −30 to 40˚C
*Solar arrays, which have a wide operating range of −150 to 100˚C
*Infrared spectrometers, which have a range of −40 to 60˚C

==Current Technologies==

===Coating===
Coatings are the simplest and least expensive of the TCS techniques. A coating may be paint or a more sophisticated chemical applied to the surfaces of the spacecraft to lower or increase heat transfer. The characteristics of the type of coating depends on their absorptivity, emissivity, transparency, and reflectivity. The main disadvantage of coating is that it degrades quickly due to the operating environment.

===Multilayer Insulation (MLI)===
Multilayer insulation (MLI) is the most common passive thermal control element used on spacecrafts. MLI prevent both heat losses to the environment and excessive heating from the environment. Spacecraft components such as propellant tanks, propellant lines, batteries, and solid rocket motors are also covered in MLI blankets to maintain ideal operating temperature. MLI consist of an outer cover layer, interior layer, and an inner cover layer. The outer cover layer needs to be opaque to sunlight, generate a low amount of particulate contaminates, and be able to survive in the environment and temperature to which the spacecraft will be exposed. Some common materials used for the outer layer are fiberglass woven cloth impregnated with [[PTFE]] Teflon, [[Polyvinyl flouride|PVF]] reinforced with [[Nomex]] bonded with polyester adhesive, and [[Flourinated ethylene propylene|FEP]] Teflon. The general requirement for the interior layer is that it needs to have a low emittance. The most commonly used material for this layer is Mylar that is aluminized on one or both sides. The interior layers are usually thin compared to the outer layer to save weight and are perforated to aid in venting trapped air during launch. The inner cover faces the spacecraft hardware and is used to protect the thin interior layers. Inner covers are often not aluminized in order to prevent electrical shorts. Some materials used for the inner covers are [[Polyethylene terephthalate|Dacron]] and Nomex Netting. Mylar is not used because of flammability concerns. MLI blankets are an important element of the thermal control system.

===Louvers===
Louvers are active thermal control elements that are used in many different forms. Most commonly they are placed over external radiators, louvers can also be used to control heat transfer between internal spacecraft surfaces, or be placed on openings on the spacecraft walls. A louver in its fully open state can reject six times as much heat as it does in its fully closed state, with no power required to operate it. The most commonly used louver is the bimetallic, spring-actuated, rectangular blade louver also known as venetian-blind louver. Louver radiator assemblies consist of five main elements: baseplate, blades, actuators, sensing elements, and structural elements.

===Heaters===
Heaters are used in thermal control design to protect components under cold-case environmental conditions or to make up for heat that is not dissipated. Heaters are used with thermostats or solid-state controllers to provide exact temperature control of a particular component. Another common use for heaters is to warm up components to their minimum operating temperatures before the components are turned on. 
*The most common type of heater used on spacecraft is the patch heater which consists of an electrical-resistance element sandwiched between two sheets of flexible electrically insulating material, such as [[Kapton]]. The patch heater may contain either a single circuit or multiple circuits, depending on whether or not redundancy is required within it.
*Another type of heater, the cartridge heater, is often used to heat blocks of material or high-temperature components such as propellants. This heater consists of a coiled resistor enclosed in a cylindrical metallic case. Typically a hole is drilled in the component to be heated and the cartridge is potted into the hole. Cartridge heaters are usually a quarter-inch or less in diameter and up to a few inches long. 
*Another type of heater used on spacecraft is the radioisotope heater units also known as RHUs. RHUs are used for traveling to outer planets past Jupiter due to very low solar radiance, which greatly reduces the power generated from solar panels. These heaters do not require any electrical power from the spacecraft and provide direct heat where it is needed. At the center of each RHU is a radioactive material which decays to provide heat. The most commonly used material is plutonium-dioxide. A single RHU weighs just 42 grams and can fit in a cylindrical enclosure 26mm in diameter and 32mm long. Each unit also generates 1 W of heat at encapsulation however the heat generation rate decreases with time. A total of 117 RHUs were used on the [[Cassini-Huygens|Cassini]] mission.

=== Radiators ===
Excess waste heat created on the spacecraft is rejected to space by the use of radiators. Radiators come in several different forms, such as spacecraft structural panels, flat-plate radiators mounted to the side of the spacecraft, and panels deployed after the spacecraft is on orbit. Whatever the configuration, all radiators reject heat by infrared (IR) radiation from their surfaces. The radiating power depends on the surface's emittance and temperature. The radiator must reject both the spacecraft waste heat and any radiant-heat loads from the environment. Most radiators are therefore given surface finishes with high IR emittance to maximize heat rejection and low solar absorptance to limit heat from the sun. Most spacecraft radiators reject between 100 and 350 W of internally generated electronics waste heat per square meter. Radiators weight typically varies from almost nothing, if an existing structural panel is used as a radiator, to around 12&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for a heavy deployable radiator and its support structure.

The radiators of the International Space Station are clearly visible as arrays of white square panels attached to the main truss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Heat pipes===
[[Heat pipe]]s use a closed two-phase liquid-flow cycle with an evaporator and a condenser to transport relatively large quantities of heat from one location to another without electrical power.

==Sun shield==
[[File:James Webb telescope sunshield.jpg|thumb|Sunshield full-size test for the James Webb Space Telescope]]
In spacecraft design, a sun shield restricts or reduces heat caused by sunlight hitting a spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.erau.edu/~ericksol/courses/sp300/ch10/thermal_ch10.html]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of use of a thermal shield is on the [[Infrared Space Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.erau.edu/~ericksol/courses/sp300/ch10/thermal_ch10.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The ISO sunshield helped protect the cryostat from sunlight, and it was also covered with solar panels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://general-tools.cosmos.esa.int/iso/images/misc/m3085_is.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not to be confused with concept of a  global scale sun shield in [[Geological engineering|geoengineering]], often called a [[Space sunshade]] or "sun shield", in that case the spacecraft itself is used to block sunlight on a planet, not as part the spacecraft's thermal design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160425-how-a-giant-space-umbrella-could-stop-global-warming]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a sunshield in spacecraft design is the [[Sunshield (JWST)]] on the planned [[James Webb Space Telescope]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwst.nasa.gov/sunshield.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dillon-Wagoner Graviton Polarity Generator''', known colloquially as the '''spindizzy''', is a fictitious [[anti-gravity]] device imagined by [[James Blish]] for his series ''[[Cities in Flight]]''.  This device grows more efficient with the amount of mass being lifted, which was used as the hook for the stories—it was more effective to lift an entire city than it was to lift something smaller, such as a classic [[spacecraft|spaceship]].  This is taken to extremes in the final stories, where an entire planet is used to cross the galaxy in a matter of hours using the spindizzy drive.

According to the stories, the spindizzy is based on principles contained in an equation coined by [[P.M.S. Blackett]], a British physicist of the mid-20th century. Several other Blish stories involving novel [[space drive]]s contain the same assertion. Blackett's original formula was an attempt to correlate the known [[magnetic fields]] of large rotating bodies, such as the Sun, Earth, and a star in [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] whose field had been measured indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blackett |first=P.M.S. |authorlink=Patrick Blackett, Baron Blackett |title=The Magnetic Field of Massive Rotating Bodies |date=1947-05-17 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=159 |pages=658–666 |publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]] |location=4 Crinan Street, London, United Kingdom |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=20239729| doi = 10.1038/159658a0 |issue=4046}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unusual in that it brought [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[gravitational constant]] and [[Coulomb's constant]] together, the one governing forces between masses, the other governing forces between [[electric charges]].  However, it was later disproved by more accurate measurements, and by new discoveries such as [[geomagnetic reversal|magnetic field reversals]] on [[Earth]] and the [[Sun]], and the lack of a magnetic field on bodies such as [[Mars]], despite its rotation being similar to Earth's.

Blish's extrapolation was that if rotation combined with mass produces magnetism via gravity, then rotation and magnetism could produce anti-gravity. The field created by a spindizzy is described as altering the magnetic moment of any atom within its influence.

The spindizzy was also used in at least two novels by Jesse Franklin Bone, ''The Lani People'' and ''Confederation Matador'' and appears as the nickname for fictional [[Heim theory]] devices in [[Ken MacLeod]]'s ''[[The Execution Channel]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3859">{{for|the railroad term|spur line}}
The '''spurline''' is a type of [[radio-frequency]] and [[microwave]] [[distributed element filter]] with [[band-stop]] (notch) characteristics, most commonly used with [[microstrip]] transmission lines. Spurlines usually exhibit moderate to narrow-band rejection, at about 10% around the central frequency.

Spurline filters are very convenient for dense [[integrated circuits]] because of their inherently compact design and ease of integration: they occupy surface that corresponds only to a quarter-wavelength [[transmission line]].

== Structure description ==
It consists of a normal [[microstrip]] line breaking into a pair of smaller coupled lines that rejoin after a quarter-wavelength distance. Only one of the input ports of the coupled lines is connected to the feed microstrip, as shown in the figure below. The orange area of the illustration is the microstrip transmission line conductor and the gray color the exposed dielectric.

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0
| [[File:Spurline microstrip.png]]
|-
|&lt;center&gt; ''Figure : Microstrip Spurline Notch Filter (Top View)'' &lt;/center&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; \lambda_g &lt;/math&gt; is the [[wavelength]] corresponding to the central rejection [[frequency]] of the bandstop filter, measured - of course - in the microstrip line material. This is the most important parameter of the filter that sets the rejection band.

The distance between the two coupled lines can be selected appropriately to fine-tune the filter. The smaller the distance, the narrower the stop-band in terms of rejection. Of course that is limited by the circuit-board printing resolution, and it is usually considered at about 10% of the input microstrip width.

The gap between the input microstrip line and the one open-circuited line of the coupler has a negligible effect on the frequency response of the filter. Therefore, it is considered approximately equal to the distance of the two coupled lines.

==Printed antennae==
Spurlines can also be used in printed antennae such as the [[planar inverted-F antenna]].  The additional resonances can be designed to widen the antenna bandwidth or to create multiple bands, for instance, for a [[tri-band]] mobile phone.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Peter S.; Lee, E.; Song, C. T. P., "Planar inverted-F antennas", pp. 197-227, in Waterhouse, Rod (ed), ''Printed Antennas for Wireless Communications'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008 {{ISBN|0470512253}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A spurline filter was first proposed by Schiffman and Matthaei in [[stripline]] form in 1964.  Bates adapted the design for microstrip in 1977.  Nguyen and Hsieh improved the analysis for microstrip implementations in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Cam Nguyen; Kai Chang, "Millimeter wave planar integrated circuit filters", ch. 2 in Kenneth Button (ed), ''Topics in Millimeter Wave Technology: Volume 1'', p. 177, Elsevier, 2012 {{ISBN|0323140874}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Topwater fishing lure''' is a type of [[fishing lure]], usually floating, that may be moved about the surface of water in order to attract and cause [[fish]] to attempt to strike the lure. Non-floating versions may be retrieved at sufficient speed to cause them to travel at the water's surface.
[[File:GT Popper Fishing Lures.png|thumbnail|Robert Stone Mahogany Lures (GT Poppers)]]
Such lures are often designed to resemble smaller creatures that would normally be considered as food for the target fish species. (They are painted to look like the prey of the target species; usually smaller fish, [[frog]]s, or [[insect]]s.) One of the key features of the topwater lure is the "action" that it imparts as it travels along the water's surface. The more effective lures have an action that closely resembles that of the actual living creature. The lure is typically fitted with one of more [[fish hook]]s (usually treble hooks) to hook the target fish as it strikes the lure. Variations exist that include internal rattles to generate sound that might be similar to the sounds created by the actual, live creature being emulated. some also include small light sources such as [[light-emitting diode|LEDs]] that might be battery powered. There are also jointed bodies, moving eyes, [[holography|holographic]] finishes, etc. all of which are incorporated to encourage the target species to strike the lure. The lure is normally attached to the end of a [[fishing line]] that is attached to a [[fishing rod]] and [[fishing reel|reel]] and is cast into areas where the target species might be found and "worked" skillfully within that area to encourage strikes. This type of fishing is considered by many to be one of the more exciting methods used to catch fish. A frequent mistake when fishing topwater lures is to initiate the [[hookset]] immediately upon seeing the fish strike the lure. In many species, especially bass, it is important to wait a few seconds before initiating the hookset to ensure that the lure is in the best position in the fish's mouth to optimize the chances of a successful hooking. [[Black bass]], [[spotted seatrout]], [[Elopidae|ladyfish]], [[red drum|redfish]], [[bluefish]], [[tarpon]], [[bonefish]], [[barracuda]], &amp; [[Esox|pickerel]] are examples of fish that might be taken by the topwater approach.

[[File:H5172 Ostindienfararen Götheborg pinnkompass.jpg|right|thumb|Traverse board of the replica sailing ship ''[[Götheborg (ship)|Götheborg]]''.]]
The '''traverse board''' is a memory aid formerly used in [[dead reckoning]] [[navigation]] to easily record the speeds and directions sailed during a [[watch (naval)|watch]]. Even [[crew member]]s who could not read or write could use the traverse board.

As the mathematician [[William Bourne (mathematician)|William Bourne]] remarked in 1571, “I have known within these 20 years that them that were ancient masters of shippes hathe derided and mocked them that have occupied their cards and plattes and also the observation of the Altitude of the Pole saying; that they care not for their sheepskinne for he could keepe a better account upon a board.”  

Bourne’s ‘old salt’ is talking about a traverse board, a wooden board with a [[compass rose]] drawn on it linked by pegs and cords to a series of peg holes beneath it.  It allowed a helmsman to keep a rough check of the time sailed on each [[rhumb]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/rhumb Rhumb: compass point]&lt;/ref&gt; of the wind.

==Description==
The traverse board is a wooden board with peg-holes and attached pegs.  It is divided into two parts, upper and lower.

The top part is for recording direction [[sail]]ed. It has a representation of the [[compass rose]] with its 32 [[compass]] points, just as on the face of the [[ship]]'s compass. Eight concentric rings are inscribed on the compass rose. Each ring has one peg hole at each point of the compass. Eight pegs are attached to the centre of the compass rose with strings.

The bottom part is for recording speed. It has four rows of holes. Each column represents a certain speed, measured in [[knot (unit)|knot]]s. Three more columns to the right give fractional knots: {{1/4}}, {{1/2}}, and {{3/4}}. Eight pegs are attached to this part of the board.

Each half-hour during the watch, a [[crew member]] inserted a peg in the top part of the board to represent the [[Direction (geometry)|heading]] [[sail]]ed during that half-hour, as shown on the [[ship]]'s [[compass]].  The innermost ring of peg-holes is used for the first half-hour, and each succeeding measurement was made in the next ring out, until all eight rings were used.

Each hour during the [[watch (naval)|watch]], a [[crew member]] inserted a peg in the bottom portion of the board to represent the [[speed]] sailed during the hour.  The speed would have been measured using a [[knot log]].  If the speed for the first hour of the watch was {{frac|10|1|2}} knots, the crew member would count over 10 holes in the first row and place one peg, then place another peg in the column marked "{{1/2}}".  In the second hour of the watch, the crew member would use the second row of pegs, and so on until all 4 rows were used.

At the end of the watch, the navigator collected the information about the speeds and directions sailed during the watch into the logbook, cleared the pegs from the board, and used the information to figure the vessel's [[dead reckoning]] track.  Meanwhile, the [[helmsman|helm]] of the new watch  would begin recording the new sailing headings and [[speed]]s on the traverse board.

This system was introduced by [[Fazlur Rahman Khan]] while at the architectural firm [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] (SOM), in their Chicago office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Engineering Legends|first=Richard|last=Weingardt|publisher=[[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE Publications]]|year=2005|isbn=0-7844-0801-7|page=76|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first example of the tube’s use is the 43-story Khan-designed DeWitt-Chestnut Apartment Building, since renamed [[Plaza on DeWitt]], in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], finished in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beedle |first1=Lynn S. |author2=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat |title=Advances in tall buildings |year=1986 |publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Company |location= |isbn=978-0-442-21599-6 |page=149 |url= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system can be built using [[steel]], [[concrete]], or composite construction (the discrete use of both steel and concrete). It can be used for [[office building|office]], [[apartment building|apartment]], and [[Mixed-use development|mixed-use]] buildings. Most buildings of over 40 stories built since the 1960s are of this structural type.

==Concept==
The tube system concept is based on the idea that a building can be designed to resist lateral loads by designing it as a hollow [[cantilever]] perpendicular to the ground. In the simplest incarnation of the tube, the perimeter of the exterior consists of closely spaced columns that are tied together with deep [[spandrel]] beams through moment connections. This assembly of columns and beams forms a rigid frame that amounts to a dense and strong structural wall along the exterior of the building.&lt;ref name=AliStruct&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ali|first1=Mir M.|last2=Moon|first2=Kyoung Sun|title=Structural Developments in Tall Buildings: Current Trends and Future Prospects|journal=Architectural Science Review|volume=50|issue=3|year=2007|pages=205–223|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/earthscan/asre/2007/00000050/00000003/art00002|access-date=2011-04-14|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|doi=10.3763/asre.2007.5027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This exterior framing is designed sufficiently strong to resist all lateral loads on the building, thereby allowing the interior of the building to be simply framed for gravity loads. Interior columns are comparatively few and located at the core. The distance between the exterior and the core frames is spanned with beams or trusses and can be column-free. This maximizes the effectiveness of the perimeter tube by transferring some of the gravity loads within the structure to it, and increases its ability to resist overturning via lateral loads.

==History==
By 1963, a new structural system of framed tubes had appeared in [[skyscraper design and construction]]. [[Fazlur Rahman Khan]] defined the framed tube structure as "a three dimensional space structure composed of three, four, or possibly more frames, braced frames, or shear walls, joined at or near their edges to form a vertical tube-like structural system capable of resisting lateral forces in any direction by cantilevering from the foundation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Evolution of Concrete Skyscrapers |access-date= 2007-05-14 |url= http://www.civenv.unimelb.edu.au/ejse/Archives/Fulltext/200101/01/20010101.htm |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070605133019/http://www.civenv.unimelb.edu.au/ejse/Archives/Fulltext/200101/01/20010101.htm |archivedate= 2007-06-05 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Closely spaced interconnected exterior columns form the tube. Lateral or horizontal loads (wind, seismic, impact) are supported by the structure as a whole. About half the exterior surface is available for windows. Framed tubes allow fewer interior columns, and so allow more usable floor space. Where larger openings like garage doors are needed, the tube frame must be interrupted, with transfer girders used to maintain structural integrity.

The first building to apply the tube-frame construction was the DeWitt-Chestnut Apartment Building which Khan designed and which was finished in [[Chicago]] by 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Swenson|first=Alfred|last2=Chang|first2=Pao-Chi|title=Building construction|publisher=''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''|year=2008|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/83859/building-construction|access-date=2008-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This laid the foundations for the tube structural design of many later skyscrapers, including his own [[John Hancock Center]] and [[Willis Tower]], and the [[construction of the World Trade Center]], [[Petronas Towers]], [[Jin Mao Building]], and most other supertall skyscrapers since the 1960s, including the world's tallest building {{as of|2017|lc=y}}, the [[Burj Khalifa]].&lt;ref name=Ali&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ali|first=Mir M.|title=Evolution of Concrete Skyscrapers: from Ingalls to Jin Mao|journal=Electronic Journal of Structural Engineering|volume=1|issue=1|year=2001|pages=2–14|url=http://www.ejse.org/Archives/Fulltext/200101/01/20010101.htm|access-date=2008-11-30|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
From its conception, the tube has been varied to suit different structural needs.

===Framed tube===
[[File:Nistncstar1-1-fig2-4.png|thumb|The World Trade Center's Twin Towers were some of the first structures to use a framed tube design.  The many columns of the tube can be seen around the exterior of this horizontal cross section.  The towers had a core for services, seen in the center.  The design was not tube-in-tube since the core had 47 columns spaced relatively evenly, rather than around the edge of the core.]]

This is the simplest incarnation of the tube. It can appear in a variety of floor plan shapes, including square, rectangular, circular, and freeform. This design was first used in Chicago's DeWitt-Chestnut Apartment Building, designed by Khan and finished in 1965, but the most notable examples are the [[Aon Center (Chicago)|Aon Center]] and the original [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)#Structural design|World Trade Center]] towers.

===Trussed or braced tube===
The trussed tube, also termed ''braced tube'', is similar to the simple tube but with comparatively fewer and farther-spaced exterior columns. Steel bracings or concrete [[shear wall]]s are introduced along the exterior walls to compensate for the fewer columns by tying them together. The most notable examples incorporating steel bracing are the John Hancock Center, the [[Citigroup Center]], and the [[Bank of China Tower (Hong Kong)|Bank of China Tower]].

===Tube in tube===
Also known as ''hull and core'', these structures have a core tube inside the structure, holding the elevator and other services,  and another tube around the exterior.  Most of the gravity and lateral loads are normally taken by the outer tube because of its greater strength. The ''780 Third Avenue'' 50-story concrete frame office building in Manhattan uses concrete shear walls for bracing and an off-center core to allow column-free interiors.&lt;ref name=thirdav&gt;{{emporis|id=7803avenuenue-newyorkcity-ny-usa|name=780 Third Avenue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bundled tube===
[[File:Willis Tower tube structure.svg|thumb|Breakdown of the [[Tube (structure)#Bundled tube|bundled tube structure]] of the [[Willis Tower]] with simplified floor plans.]]

Instead of one tube, a building consists of several tubes tied together to resist lateral forces. Such buildings have interior columns along the perimeters of the tubes when they fall within the building envelope. Notable examples include [[Willis Tower]], [[One Magnificent Mile]], and the [[Newport Tower (Jersey City)|Newport Tower]].

[[File:Sears Tower ss.jpg|thumb|[[Willis Tower]], finished in 1973, introduced the bundled tube structural design and was the world's tallest building until 1998]]

Beside being efficient structurally and economically, the bundled tube was "innovative in its potential for versatile formulation of architectural space. Efficient towers no longer had to be box-like; the tube-units could take on various shapes and could be bundled together in different sorts of groupings."&lt;ref name=Banglapedia&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoque |first=Rashimul |year=2012 |chapter=Khan, Fazlur Rahman1 |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Khan,_Fazlur_Rahman1 |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bundled tube structure meant that "buildings no longer need be boxlike in appearance: they could become sculpture."&lt;ref name=Bayley&gt;{{cite web|title=Burj Dubai: The new pinnacle of vanity|author=Stephen Bayley|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=5 January 2010|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/dubai/6934603/Burj-Dubai-The-new-pinnacle-of-vanity.html|access-date=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hybrids ===
Hybrids include a varied category of structures where the basic concept of tube is used, and supplemented by other structural support(s). This method is used where a building is so thin that one system cannot provide adequate strength or stiffness.

==Other uses==
Some lattice towers consist of steel tube elements. They can be used for guyed and for free-standing lattice structures. An example for the first type was [[Warsaw Radio Mast]], an example for latter one are the Russian [[3803 KM]]-towers.

[[File:Ucode icon.jpg|thumb|ucode symbol]]
The '''ucode system''' (written in lower case "[[:wikt:ucode|ucode]]") is an identification number system that can be used to identify things in the real world uniquely. Digital information can be associated with objects and places, and the associated information can be retrieved by using ucode.

Unique identification system for real world objects is considered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eurosfaire.prd.fr/7pc/doc/1272985908_internet_things_kk3110323enc.pdf |title= Vision and challenges for realising the Internet of Things |author1=H Sundmaeker |author2=P Guillemin |author3=P Friess |year= 2010 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; an essential enabler for the realisation of [[Internet of Things]]  and therefore ucode system is seen as a building block for Internet of Things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = eds. O. Veiseman, P. Freiss |title= Internet of Things: Global Technological and Societal Trends |year=2011 |publisher=River Publishers }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The ucode system uses 128 bit code for unique naming of things so there are 340282366920938463463374607431768211455 or 3.4 x 10^38 different codes. If more codes are needed, they can be added in chunks of 128 bits. Ucode is application and technology agnostic.  Uniqueness means that each ucode is unique, there can – or at least should - not be another ucode with exactly same number. Ucode is not tied to any specific application or business domain, neither is it committed to any specific technology for containing the ucode number, e.g. RFID, barcode or matrix code. ucode is supported by the uID center, which is a non-profit organisation based in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]].  The Chairman of the uID Center is Professor Ken [[Sakamura]] who is also the person behind ucode.

==Structure and Resolution mechanism==
Ubiquitous ID system  consists of five components: (1) ucode, (2) ucode tag, (3) ubiquitous communicator, (4) ucode resolution server and (5) ucode information server.&lt;ref name="sakamura2011"&gt;{{cite book |author = K. Sakamura|title= Ubiquitous ID Technologies |year=2011 |publisher=uID Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution process goes as follows. First, the ucode from an ucode tag using e.g. a mobile phone is read. The camera of the phone can be used to read a matrix code containing the ucode. Then, the mobile phone inquires the ucode resolution server – via internet connection - about the code. The ucode resolution server returns the source of the provided ucode information based on the ucode read. Finally, the ubiquitous communicator connects to the information provision source and acquires contents and services.
The ucode server architecture is  similar to the familiar [[Domain Name System|Internet DNS]] resolution service. Like DNS, the ucode resolution mechanism consists of hierarchical levels. The ucode resolution mechanism is three tiered as follows:
*uID center maintains the root server
*Top level domain (TLD) servers are under root
*Second level domain (SLD) servers are under TLD
The root server is maintained by uID Center in Tokyo. TLD servers are in place in Japan, other Asian countries and in Europe (Oulu, Finland). The number of TLD and SLD servers is not limited.

== ucode tags ==
Ucode tags can take various forms.&lt;ref name=sakamura2011 /&gt; They can be 
*Print Tag
*Passive RFID Tag/Smart Card
*Active RF Tag (built-in battery type)
*Active Infrared Tag (built-in battery type)
*Acoustic Tag 
Print tags can be matrix codes, e.g. [[QR code|QR]] codes or barcodes.  A special sub-section of RFID tags are [[Near field communication|NFC]] tags, which can contain ucode.  UID Center has certified a 46 differenrf ucode tags, the first ones in 2003 were barcodes made by Sato corporation, Toppan Forms Inc. and Dai Nippon Printing Co., later on two dimensional matrix codes were introduced, followed by hologram implementation and several RFID tags, often compliant with ISO/IEC15693 standard and using frequency band 13.56&amp;nbsp;MHz.

== Example ==
The ucode solution has been used in a number of trial cases related to tourist guides, geospatial information applications, housing and real estate as well as food and drug traceability.  
Japanese organisation Center for Better Living is using ucode for labelling construction material and components in a unique and traceable manner. The label is a sign of approved quality and entitles the buyer into a two to ten year repair warranty, depending on the nature of the material or component.

==Other identification systems==
[[EPCGlobal]] is an identification system aimed for supply chain information management. The EPC (Electronic Product Code) relies on [[RFID]] tags for object identification. EPCGlobal is a successor of [[MIT]] Auto ID Center which developed the technology used by EPCGlobal.
[EAN] International Article Numbering system and its sister system UPC [[Universal Product Code]] are the familiar barcodes seen in all retail merchandise. ucode differs from them in identifying individual objects, not just the product type.
