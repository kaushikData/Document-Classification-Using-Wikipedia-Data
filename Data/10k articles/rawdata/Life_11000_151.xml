'''Alessandra Codazzi''', called '''Sandra''' (11 November 1921 – 5 May 2010), was an Italian politician, trade union and [[Partisan (military)|partisan]], [[Senate of Italy|Senator]] between 1976 and 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senato.it/leg/09/BGT/Schede/Attsen/00000628.htm Alessandra CODAZZI] {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firstborn of seven brothers and daughter of Colonel Alberto Codazzi, who was a descendant of [[Agostino Codazzi]], geographer and national hero in Venezuela and Colombia. During the [[Second World War]] she was partisan, making the messenger for the partisan brigade of Catholic inspiration [[Brigate Fiamme Verdi]] hidden in the Reggio Apennines, taking the name of "Rosario"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.provincia.re.it/page.asp?IDCategoria=701&amp;IDSezione=7833&amp;ID=157419 Codazzi Alessandra] {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to avoid being captured by the Nazi-Fascists. Graduated in literature and philosophy at the [[Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore]], a pupil of [[Giuseppe Dossetti]], she first entered the [[Azione Cattolica]] and shortly afterwards in the CISL of Giulio Pastore, where she attended the "Long Course" at the [[Italian Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions|CISL]] Study Center in Florence with Professor Mario Romani&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicnow.com/view/FB43819515A65D9D971EBB4A2DAECF9EDB6CDFC4 Emilia Romagna. Cisl: 'Tina Anselmi Partecipa A Iniziativa Del Comune Di Reggio Emilia'] {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the CISL she took care of women and workers' rights until she became national secretary of the textile category&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senatoripd.it/donne/parente-raccogliamo-il-testimone-di-chi-ha-cambiato-litalia/ senatoripd.it Raccogliamo il testimone di chi ha cambiato l'Italia] {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1976 she was elected senator for the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]] until 1987.

She worked and had close relations with her colleagues [[Anna Gabriella Ceccatelli]], [[Tina Anselmi]] and [[Nilde Iotti]]. She died in Rome on 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://necrologie.gazzettadireggio.gelocal.it/necrologi/2010/10569-codazzi-alessandra Alessandra Codazzi] {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animat''' (''third-person indicative present of the [[Latin]] verb '''animō'''''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verbix.com/webverbix/go.php?D1=9&amp;H1=109&amp;T1=animo "Animo" at Verbix Latin Verb Conjugator]. Retrieved July 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning to "animate, give or bring life".&lt;ref&gt;[http://latin-dictionary.net/search/latin/animo "Animo" at Latdict Latin Dictionary and Grammar Resources]. Retrieved July 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animats''' are artificial [[animal]]s, a contraction of [[animal]]-materials. The term includes physical robots and virtual simulations.  Animat research, a subset of [[Artificial Life]] studies, has become rather popular since [[Rodney Brooks]]' seminal paper "Intelligence without representation". The word was coined by S.W. Wilson in 1985,
in "Knowledge growth in an artificial animal", published in the first ''Proceedings'' 
''of an International Conference on Genetic Algorithms and Their Applications''.

An example using the Animat model as proposed by Wilson is discussed at some length in chapter 9 of [[Stan Franklin]]'s book, [[Artificial Minds]]. In this implementation, the animat is capable of independent learning about its environment through application and evolution of pattern-matching rules called "taxons".

In 2001 Thomas DeMarse performed studies on '[[neurally controlled animat]]'.  Every two years, the Society of Adaptive Behaviour meets and produces a proceedings on this topic.  They also have a journal, ''[[Adaptive Behavior]]''.

[[Alan H Goldstein]] has proposed that, because [[nanobiotechnology]] is in the process of creating real animal-materials, speculative use of this term should be discouraged and its application become purely phenomenological.  Based on the Animat Test (contained in the reference  "I, Nanobot.") any nonbiological material or entity that exhibits the minimum set of behaviors that define a life form is, de facto, an Animat.  Goldstein's basic premise is that in the age of nanobiotechnology it is necessary to follow the chemistry and molecular engineering rather than watching for the emergence of some pre-conceived minimum level of 'intelligence' such as an artificial neural network capable of adaptive phenomena.   Goldstein has cautioned that there is a serious disconnect between the fields of nanobiotechnology and A-life based on profound differences in scientific training, experimental systems, and the different sets of terminology (jargon) these two fields have produced.  Nanobiotechnologists (really molecular engineers who work with both biological and nonbiological molecules) are generally not concerned with complex systems per se; even when they are building molecular interconnects between such systems, e.g. neuroelectronic splices.  A-Life researchers mainly take a systems-level approach.  The enormous transformative power of novel molecular engineering has the potential to create Animats, true nonbiological life forms, whose relatively simple behavior would not fit into most standard A-Life paradigms.  As a result, Goldstein argues, the first Animats may come into being completely unrecognized by either scientific community.

The daughter of [[François Beaulieu II]] and Louise (or Catherine) St. Germain, she was born in the [[Salt River (Canada)|Salt River]] region near [[Fort Smith, Northwest Territories|Fort Smith]]. In 1845, she was baptized into the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and attended the [[Grey Nuns]] school in [[Saint Boniface, Winnipeg|St. Boniface]]. The Grey Nuns founded a hospital and school in [[Fort Providence]] in 1867 and she encouraged First Nations women to use their health care services.&lt;ref name=northern/&gt; 

Beaulieu spoke several languages [[Chipewyan language|Chipewyan]], [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Michif]] and [[Slavey language|Slavey]].&lt;ref name="bcmetis"/&gt; She is believed to be the source of the [[Chipewyan]] oral history recorded by Fathers [[Émile Petitot]] and Grouard.&lt;ref name=riel&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metismuseum.ca/media/document.php/14196.Catherine%20Beaulieu%20Bouvier%20Lamoureux2.pdf |title=Catherine Beaulieu Bouvier Lamoureux |publisher=Louis Riel Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also helped to preserve oral tradition for her own people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/APPS/CP-NR/release_e.asp?bgid=1665&amp;andor1=bg |title=Catherine Beaulieu Bouvier Lamoureux |publisher=Parks Canada |date=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was married twice: first to Joseph Bouvier in 1852 - he died in 1877 - and then, in 1879, to Jean-Baptiste Lamoureux. She died at Fort Providence in 1918 after the death of her second husband earlier that year.&lt;ref name=northern&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nnsl.com/frames/newspapers/2012-08/aug9_12CAT.html |title=Metis matriarch honoured in Fort Providence |publisher=Northern News Services |date=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the winter, she often travelled the 150 miles between Fort Providence and [[Behchoko|Fort Rae]]; she also carried mail between the two communities.&lt;ref name=riel/&gt;

In 2012, she was declared a Person of National Historic Significance by the Canadian government, the first woman in the Northwest Territories to receive that designation.&lt;ref name=northern/&gt;

There are several types of horoscopes used in this religion, including a birth horoscope, a life forecast, an annual horoscope, a marriage horoscope, and a death horoscope.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tibetan Buddhism with its mystic cults, symbolism, and mythology|last=Waddell|first=L.

Additionally, a death horoscope is intended as a loving act for the dead, and a precautionary measure for the family of the deceased. Many Tibetans believe that when a death occurs within the family, other family members’ lives are jeopardized, so this practice may be considered essential to both the living and dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sithar|first=Norbu|date=|title=An introduction on rTse in Tibetan Buddhism Astrology &amp; Horoscope|url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/242796/bot_1999_03_01.pdf?sequence=1|journal=An introduction on rtse in Tibetan Buddhism Astrology &amp; Horoscope|volume=|pages=3, 4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetan Buddhists also believe that their deceased loved ones may spend a short period in hell to pay for sins in their past life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Death horoscopes serve several purposes, including, determining the right time for [[Buddhist funeral|disposing of the deceased’s body]], understanding the presumed [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] destination, and revealing how the deceased’s family can improve their rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sumegi|first=Angela|date=2014|title=Buddhist Perspectives on Death|url=|journal=Buddhist Perspectives on Death|volume=|pages=219, 220|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the horoscope may reveal the past life of the dead and whether or not the death was well-timed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The horoscope also serves as a precautionary tool to reveal specific types of threats from demons and future attacks targeted at living family members.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In fact, the [[lama]] conducts a preventative ceremony before the [[Astrology|astrologer]] casts the death horoscope to prevent any of the eight classes of demonic spirits from harming the deceased.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to some, the chanting of [[mantra]]s may combat the demons and ward off evil spirits, as well as help interpret the death chart.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The death chart indicates who can have contact with the body, and whether certain household items must be removed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Lastly, the astrologer may be able to reveal who will facilitate the corpse’s disposal, including carrying, preparing, and cremating it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Procedure==

The initial step in casting the death horoscope includes immediately informing all family and close friends of the death .&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The corpse is not to be touched or shifted from its position at the moment of death, and the family must wait for the [[lama]] or astrologer to arrive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The mourning families may offer a present or fee to the astrologer for the horoscope, to ensure a favorable outcome for the soul.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The corpse remains inside the house until the astrologer concludes his calculation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Once the lama arrives, he may perform a religious ritual, known as a [[phowa]] (from [[Sanskrit]]), which is then followed by the astrologer casting the death horoscope.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tibetan Rituals of Death: Buddhist Funerary Practices|last=Gouin|first=Margaret|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-0415626194|location=|pages=20, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lama removes all mourning family members from the death chamber, and closes all windows and doors. He then covers the corpse’s face with a white cloth, and sits down next to its head.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

He is said to draw the remaining [[Consciousness (Buddhism)|consciousness]] from the corpse through the top of the head.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Then, he extracts some hairs from the corpse’s head to allow the soul to exit the body through the roots.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He, or the astrologer, indicates whether there is any life remaining in the corpse.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.men-tsee-khang.org/astrology/astrology.htm|title=Men tsee khang (sowa rigpa)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some, the corpse’s consciousness may linger from one life to another for 49 days. So, the lama reads the Tibetan book of the dead, [[Bardo Thodol]], out loud to guide the corpse in its new life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gloEua0RSs|title=The Tibetan Book of the Dead A Way of Life|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important that the body remains undisturbed while the lama guides the spirit because any disruption could cause the soul to drift in an unnatural direction and be seized by a demon.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Other monks may arrive as well, to provide blessings in preparation for the death horoscope.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hidden History of the Tibetan Book of the Dead|last=Cuevas|first=Bryan|publisher=|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offering-rites, at this time, are performed as a precautionary measure to ward off demons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The astrologer may then create a grid on the floor or on a sheet of paper, using only rice flour and black pebbles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He constructs the grid and the placement of the materials based on the instruction given in his astrological text.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He then reads some of the texts from the astrological manual or a calendar.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  To calculate the death horoscope, the astrologer considers the time, date, year, and month of the death, and the constellation and phase of the moon.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The birth year of the deceased, however, is typically considered the most important factor, because it indicates the deceased’s birth animal and [[Bagua|trigram]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, the body’s position at the final moment of death is essential for the direction the body should be removed and disposed of.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The horoscope may also reveal the deceased’s last thoughts, and if the thoughts were negative or positive. In the event that they were negative, the family may be given the chance to create and transfer good [[karma]] to the deceased’s future life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, the horoscope specifies which actions by the family, will help the deceased in their rebirthed life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Ian Tomlinson''' (7 February 1962&amp;nbsp;– 1 April 2009) was a newspaper vendor who collapsed and died in the [[City of London]] after being struck by a police officer during the [[2009 G-20 London summit protests|2009 G-20 summit protests]]. After an [[Inquests in England and Wales|inquest]] jury returned a verdict of [[unlawful killing]], the officer, Simon Harwood, was prosecuted for [[Manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]]. He was found not guilty but was dismissed from the police service for gross misconduct.&lt;ref name=WalkerLewis19July2012&gt;Peter Walker, Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/19/simon-harwood-not-guilty-ian-tomlinson "Ian Tomlinson death: Simon Harwood cleared of manslaughter"], ''The Guardian'', 19 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Walker, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/17/simon-harwood-sacked-gross-misconduct "Ian Tomlinson case: PC Simon Harwood sacked for gross misconduct"], ''The Guardian'', 17 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[autopsy|post-mortem]] concluded that Tomlinson had suffered a heart attack, but a week later ''The Guardian'' published video of Harwood, a constable with London's [[Metropolitan Police Service]], striking Tomlinson on the leg with a baton, then pushing him to the ground. Tomlinson was not a protester, and at the time he was struck was trying to make his way home through the police cordons. He walked away after the incident, but collapsed and died minutes later.&lt;ref name=LewisvideoApril7&gt;Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/07/ian-tomlinson-g20-death-video "Ian Tomlinson death: Guardian video reveals police attack on man who died at G20 protest"], ''The Guardian'', 7 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC) began a criminal inquiry, further autopsies indicated that Tomlinson had died from internal bleeding caused by blunt force trauma to the abdomen, in association with [[cirrhosis]] of the liver. The [[Crown Prosecution Service]] (CPS) decided not to charge Harwood, because the disagreement between the first and later pathologists meant they could not show a causal link between the death and alleged assault.&lt;ref name=CPSstatement/&gt; That position changed in 2011; after the verdict of unlawful killing, the CPS charged Harwood with manslaughter.&lt;ref name=Starmerreview/&gt; He was acquitted in 2012 and dismissed from the service a few months later.&lt;ref name=WalkerLewis19July2012/&gt;

Tomlinson's death sparked a debate in the UK about the relationship between the police, media and public, and the independence of the IPCC.&lt;ref name=Lyall&gt;Sarah Lyall, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/31/world/europe/31police.html?pagewanted=all "Critics Assail British Police for Harsh Tactics During the G-20 Summit Meeting"], ''The New York Times'', 30 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the concerns, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary, [[Denis O'Connor (police officer)|Denis O'Connor]], published a 150-page report in November 2009 that aimed to restore Britain's consent-based model of policing.&lt;ref name=LewisLavilleNov25/&gt;

==Background==
===Ian Tomlinson===
Tomlinson was born to Jim and Ann Tomlinson in Matlock, Derbyshire. He moved to London when he was 17 to work as a scaffolder. At the time of his death, at the age of 47, he was working casually as a vendor for the ''Evening Standard'', London's evening newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Booth, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/08/ian-tomlinson-friends-tributes "Friends of G20 protests victim shocked by loss of 'lovable man'"], ''The Guardian'', 8 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Married twice with nine children, including stepchildren, Tomlinson had a history of alcoholism, as a result of which he had been living apart from his second wife, Julia, for 13 years, and had experienced long periods of homelessness. He had been staying since 2008 in the Lindsey Hotel, a shelter for the homeless on Lindsey Street, [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]], [[EC postcode area|EC1]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/7990649.stm "G20 death video 'touches' family"], BBC News, 8 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon Swaine, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/5137178/G20-death-Police-gave-Ian-Tomlinson-a-good-beating-says-his-father.html "G20 death: Police gave Ian Tomlinson a 'good beating', says his father"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 10 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8413482/Ian-Tomlinson-profile-homeless-alcoholic-who-was-not-even-part-of-G20-protests.html "Ian Tomlinson profile: homeless alcoholic who was not even part of G20 protests"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 29 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, he was walking across London's financial district in an effort to reach the Lindsey Hotel, his way hampered at several points by police lines. The route he took was his usual way home from a newspaper stand on [[Monument to the Great Fire of London|Fish Street Hill]] outside [[Bank–Monument station|Monument tube station]], where he worked with a friend, Barry Smith.&lt;ref name=BrownApril9/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Millwall fan dies during G20 riots," ''South London Press'', 6 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===London police, IPCC===
[[File:G20 mounted police.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=photograph|Mounted police during the 2009 protests]]
With over 31,000 officers, the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] (the Met) is the largest police force in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.met.police.uk/about/ "About the Metropolitan Police Service"], Metropolitan Police.&lt;/ref&gt; responsible for policing Greater London, except for the financial district, the [[City of London]]. The latter has its own force, the [[City of London Police]]. The Met's [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|commissioner]] at the time was Sir [[Paul Stephenson (police officer)|Paul Stephenson]]; the City of London Police commissioner was [[Mike Bowron]]. Responsibility for supervising the Met falls to the [[Metropolitan Police Authority]], chaired by the Mayor of London, at the time [[Boris Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Edwards, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/g20-summit/5023042/G20-to-be-most-expensive-police-operation-in-British-history.html "G20 to be most expensive police operation in British history"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 20 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The officer seen pushing Tomlinson was a constable with the Met's [[Territorial Support Group]] (TSG), identified by the "U" on their shoulder numbers. The TSG specializes in public-order policing, wearing military-style helmets, flame-retardant overalls, [[stab vest]]s and balaclavas. Their operational commander at the time was Chief Superintendent Mick Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Swaine, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/g20-summit/5127064/G20-death-what-is-the-Metropolitan-Polices-Territorial-Support-Group.html "G20 death: what is the Metropolitan Police's Territorial Support Group?"], 9 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Laville, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/16/g20-tomlinson-ipcc-investigation-protest-police "Specialist protest squads at centre of investigations into G20 police violence"], ''The Guardian'', 16 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The [[Territorial Support Group]] is the successor to the [[Special Patrol Group]] (SPG), known for its alleged involvement in the 1979 death in London of a protester, [[Blair Peach]].&lt;ref&gt;Harry Underwood, [http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/46954,,blair-peach-30-years-on-death-of-a-political-protestor "Blair Peach, 30 years on"], ''The First Post'', 8 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC) began to operate in 2004; its chair when Tomlinson died was [[Nick Hardwick (chairman)|Nick Hardwick]]. Created by the Police Reform Act 2002, the commission replaced the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) following public dissatisfaction with the latter's relationship with the police. Unlike the PCA, the IPCC operates independently of the [[Home Office]], which regulates the police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8466268.stm "How well does the IPCC police the police?"], BBC News, 18 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Glencoe===
[[File:G20 crowd and police lines.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=photograph|Outside the [[Bank of England]], 1 April 2009]]
The G20 security operation, codenamed "Operation Glencoe", was a "Benbow operation", which meant the Met, City of London Police and the [[British Transport Police]] worked under one [[Gold Silver Bronze command structure|Gold commander]], in this case [[Bob Broadhurst]] of the Met.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cms.met.police.uk/news/updates/operation_glencoe_policing_and_security_for_the_g20_london_summit "Operation Glencoe policing and security for the G20 London Summit"] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5hjV3fxk0?url=http://cms.met.police.uk/news/updates/operation_glencoe_policing_and_security_for_the_g20_london_summit |date=22 June 2009 }}, Metropolitan Police Service, 2 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|''The Guardian'' reported speculation among protesters that the operation had been named after the 1692 [[Glencoe Massacre|Glencoe massacre]].&lt;ref name=GuardianGlencoe/&gt; A spokesman for the Met said before the protests that the police were "up for it"; the service said he had been quoted out of context.&lt;ref&gt;"Demonstrating Respect for Rights," Joint Committee on Human Rights, House of Commons, 28 July 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters escalated the rhetoric, saying they hoped to take control of central London, amid references to bankers being lynched.&lt;ref name=GuardianGlencoe&gt;Paul Lewis, Sandra Laville, John Vidal, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/28/g20-protests-london "G20 protests: Cry havoc&amp;nbsp;– and let slip a rainbow alliance of summit protesters"], ''The Guardian'', 28 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There were six protests on 1 April 2009: a security operation at [[ExCeL London]], a [[Stop the War Coalition|Stop the War]] march, a [[Tibetan independence movement|Free Tibet]] protest outside the Chinese Embassy, a [[People &amp; Planet]] protest, a [[2009 G-20 London summit protests#Climate Camp|Climate Camp]] protest, and a protest outside the [[Bank of England]]. Over 4,000 protesters were at the Climate Camp and the same number at the Bank of England. On 1 April over 5,500 police officers were deployed and the following day 2,800, at a cost of £7.2 million. Officers worked 14-hour shifts. They ended at midnight, slept on the floor of police stations, were not given a chance to eat, and were back on duty at 7 am. This was viewed as having contributed to the difficulties they faced.&lt;ref name=OConnor2009p22&gt;Denis O'Connor, [https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20090824024746/http://www.met.police.uk/news/docs/g20_final_report.pdf ''Adapting to protest''], Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary, 2009 (hereafter O'Connor 2009), cover page, pp.&amp;nbsp;22 (for number of police), p.&amp;nbsp;23 (for number of protesters and four different security operations), p.&amp;nbsp;33 (for 14-hour shifts and sleeping on floor).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For cost, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7955057.stm "Police warn of G20 protest scale"], BBC News, 20 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lyall/&gt;

The Bank of England protesters were held in place from 12.30&amp;nbsp;pm until 7.00&amp;nbsp;pm using a process police called "containment" and the media called "[[kettling]]"—corralling protesters into small spaces until the police dispersed them.&lt;ref name=LewisLavilleJuly7&gt;Paul Lewis, Sandra Laville, [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jul/07/g20-protests-police-tactics "G20 police authorised to use reasonable force minutes before Tomlinson died"], ''The Guardian'', 7 July 2009; [https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20090824024746/http://www.met.police.uk/news/docs/g20_final_report.pdf O'Connor 2009], p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt; At 7&amp;nbsp;pm senior officers decided that "reasonable force" could be used to disperse the protesters around the bank.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lewis, Sandra Laville, [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jul/07/g20-protests-police-tactics "G20 police authorised to use reasonable force minutes before Tomlinson died"], ''The Guardian'', 7 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 7:10 and 7:40&amp;nbsp;pm the crowd surged toward the police, missiles were thrown, and the police pushed back with their shields. Scuffles broke out and arrests were made. This was the situation Tomlinson wandered into as he tried to make his way home.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20090824024746/http://www.met.police.uk/news/docs/g20_final_report.pdf O'Connor 2009], Annex D, p.&amp;nbsp;79, for when police began to disperse the crowd.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lyall/&gt;

Several newspapers published images of Tomlinson's first encounter with police that evening. According to Barry Smith, Tomlinson left the newspaper stand outside Monument [[London Underground|Tube]] Station at around 7&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name=BrownApril9&gt;David Brown, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article6062637.ece "Ian Tomlinson: 'See you tomorrow, Barry, if I'm still living and breathing'"], ''The Times'', 9 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Daily Mail'' published an image showing Tomlinson smoking a cigarette in front of a police van in [[Lombard Street, London|Lombard Street]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/09/article-1168315-04607B4E000005DC-246_468x300.jpg Tomlinson photograph 1], ''Daily Mail'', 10 April 2003 ([https://www.webcitation.org/6o6LeuXXx?url=http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/09/article-1168315-04607B4E000005DC-246_468x300.jpg archived]).&lt;/ref&gt; An eyewitness, IT worker Ross Hardy, said Tomlinson was drunk and refusing to move; a police van tried to nudge him out of the way, and when that didn't work he was moved by four riot officers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipcc.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Documents/investigation_commissioner_reports/inv_rep_independent_investigation_into_the_death_of_ian_tomlinson_1.pdf IPCC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208034702/https://www.ipcc.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Documents/investigation_commissioner_reports/inv_rep_independent_investigation_into_the_death_of_ian_tomlinson_1.pdf |date=8 February 2017 }}, 26 August 2010, pp. 24–25, paras. 46–51.&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper published a second image of him apparently being pushed by the police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/09/article-1168315-04607D73000005DC-487_468x286.jpg Tomlinson photograph 2], ''Daily Mail'', 10 April 2009 ([https://www.webcitation.org/6o6Oj2QbY?url=http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/09/article-1168315-04607D73000005DC-487_468x286.jpg archived]).&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 April ''The Guardian'' published three images of Tomlinson taken at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/4/16/1239897944968/Ian-Tomlinson-at-7.08pm-o-001.jpg Tomlinson photograph 1], [http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/4/16/1239898035689/Ian-Tomlinson-at-7.10pm-o-001.jpg photograph 2], [http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/4/16/1239898122480/Ian-Tomlinson-walks-away--001.jpg photograph 3], ''The Guardian'', 16 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LewisApril16&gt;Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/16/ian-tomlinson-g20-photographs "New Ian Tomlinson photos show police contact before video clash"], ''The Guardian'', 16 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomlinson stayed on Lombard Street for another half hour, then made his way to [[King William Street, London|King William Street]], toward two lines of police cordons, where police had "kettled" thousands of protesters near the Bank of England. At 7:10&amp;nbsp;pm he doubled back on himself, walking up and down Change Alley where he encountered more cordons, and five minutes later was on Lombard Street again, crossed it, walked down Birchin Lane, and reached [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]] at 7:10–7:15&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name=BrownApril9/&gt;

A few minutes later he was at the northern end of a pedestrian precinct, Royal Exchange Passage (formally called Royal Exchange Buildings), near the junction with [[Threadneedle Street]], where a further police cordon stopped him from proceeding. He turned to walk south along Royal Exchange Passage instead, where, minutes before he arrived, officers had clashed with up to 25 protesters. Riot police from the Met's TSG, accompanied by City of London police dog handlers, had arrived there from the cordon in Threadneedle Street to help their colleagues.&lt;ref name=BrownApril9/&gt;&lt;ref name="GammellApril18"/&gt;

Police officers followed Tomlinson as he walked {{convert|50|yards|m|-1}} along the street.&lt;ref name=BrownApril9/&gt; He headed towards Threadneedle Street, but again ran into police cordons and doubled back on himself towards Cornhill.&lt;ref name=GammellApril18&gt;Caroline Gammell, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/g20-summit/5173455/G20-The-last-moments-of-Ian-Tomlinson.html "G20: The last moments of Ian Tomlinson"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 18 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a CPS report, he was bitten on the leg by a police dog at 7:15 pm, when a dog handler tried to move him out of the way, but he appeared not to react to it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jul/22/cps-statement-death-ian-tomlinson "CPS statement on the death of Ian Tomlinson"], ''The Guardian'', 22 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same group of officers approached Tomlinson outside a Montblanc store at the southern end of Royal Exchange Passage, near the junction with Cornhill.&lt;ref name=BrownApril9/&gt; He was walking slowly with his hands in his pockets; according to an eyewitness, he was saying that he was trying to get home.&lt;ref name=Lewishelper&gt;Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/09/g20-police-assault-ian-tomlinson-g201 "The helper: Ian Tomlinson was obeying police orders, says G20 protester"], ''The Guardian'', 9 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ''Guardian'' video shows one officer lunge at Tomlinson from behind, strike him across the legs with a baton and push his back, causing him to fall.

==Simon Harwood==
===Background===
Simon Harwood, the officer who struck Tomlinson, was a police constable with the [[Territorial Support Group]] (TSG) at Larkhall Lane police station in Lambeth, South London.&lt;ref name=LewisLaville2April9/&gt; Harwood had faced 10 complaints in 12 years,&lt;ref name=Peachey19July2012&gt;Paul Peachey, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/pc-simon-harwood-10-complaints-in-12-years-for-the-red-mist-officer-7959576.html "Pc Simon Harwood – 10 complaints in 12 years for the 'red mist' officer"], ''The Independent'', 19 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; nine of which had been dismissed or unproven. The complaint that was upheld involved unlawful access to the [[Police National Computer]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/20/police-simon-harwood-disciplinary-records?intcmp=239 "Tomlinson case: Met police tried to hide PC Harwood's disciplinary record"], ''The Guardian'', 19 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The complaints included a road-rage incident in or around 1998 while he was on sick leave, during which he reportedly tried to arrest the other driver, who alleged that Harwood had used unnecessary force. On Friday, 14 September 2001, before the case was heard by a discipline board, Harwood retired on medical grounds.&lt;ref name=Peachey19July2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Laville1&gt;Sandra Laville, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jul/05/query-g20-assault-case-officer "Disciplinary query over G20 assault case officer"], ''The Guardian'',  5 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, on Monday, 17 September, he rejoined the Met as a civilian computer worker.&lt;ref name=Peachey19July2012/&gt;

In May 2003 Harwood joined the Surrey Police as a constable. Surrey Police said he was frank about his history. In January 2004 he was alleged to have assaulted a man during a raid on a home.&lt;ref name=Peachey19July2012/&gt; In November 2004, on his request, Harwood was transferred back to the Met.&lt;ref name=Gammell22July&gt;Caroline Gammell, Andrew Hough, Gordon Rayner, [https://web.archive.org/web/20100725071303/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/g20-summit/7905549/G20-riots-Policeman-who-stuck-Ian-Tomlinson-faced-two-previous-aggression-inquiries.html "G20 riots: policeman who stuck Ian Tomlinson faced two previous aggression inquiries"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 22 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There were three more complaints after that, before the incident with Tomlinson.&lt;ref name=Peachey19July2012/&gt;

===On the day===
Harwood was involved in several confrontations on the day of Tomlinson's death. He had been on duty since 5 am, assigned as a driver, and had spent most of the day in his vehicle. While parked on Cornhill in the evening, he saw a man write "all cops are bastards" on the side of another police van, and left his vehicle to arrest him. The suspect's head struck a van door, triggering a response from the crowd that made Harwood believe it was unsafe to return to his vehicle. He told the inquest that he had been hit on the head, had fallen over, lost his baton, had been attacked by the crowd and feared for his life, but later acknowledged this had not happened.&lt;ref name=Lewis3May/&gt;&lt;ref name=LewisSharrock4May&gt;Paul Lewis, David Sharrock, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/apr/04/ian-tomlinson-inquest-simon-harwood?intcmp=239 "Ian Tomlinson inquest hears police officer feared for his life"], ''The Guardian'', 4 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his attempted arrest of the graffiti man, Harwood swung a coat at a protester, pulled a BBC cameraman to the ground, used a palm strike against one man, and at 7:19 pm pushed another man to the ground for allegedly threatening a police dog handler. It was seconds after this that he saw Tomlinson standing with his hands in his pockets beside a bicycle rack, being told by police to move away. Harwood told the inquest he made a "split-second decision" that there was justification for engagement, then struck Tomlinson on the thigh with his baton and pushed him to the ground. He said it was a "very poor push" and he had been shocked when Tomlinson fell.&lt;ref name=Lewis3May/&gt; Harwood made no mention of the incident in his notebook; he told the inquest he had forgotten about it.&lt;ref name=Lewis3May&gt;Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/may/03/ian-tomlinson-verdict-jury-decision?INTCMP=SRCH "Ian Tomlinson verdict: Jury decision is severe indictment for police officer"], ''The Guardian'', 3 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification===
Newspapers did not release Harwood's name until July 2010.&lt;ref name=DoddJuly22/&gt; On the day of the incident, he appeared to have removed his shoulder number and covered the bottom of his face with his balaclava.&lt;ref name=LewisLaville2April9&gt;Paul Lewis, Sandra Laville, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/09/g20-ian-tomlinson-police-video "G20 death: Met police officer breaks cover"], ''The Guardian'', 9 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Daily Mail'' published an image showing his shoulder ID missing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/09/article-1168315-0460FDED000005DC-902_468x341.jpg Photograph], ''Daily Mail''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/09/article-1168315-0460FDED000005DC-902_468x341.jpg Photograph], ''Daily Mail''.&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Israel of Channel 4 News reported a detailed description of the officer on 22 April 2009; the IPCC sought but failed to obtain an injunction to prevent Channel 4 broadcasting the description, alleging that it might prejudice their inquiry.&lt;ref name=IsraelApril22&gt;Simon Israel, [http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/law_order/exclusive+new+g20+video+evidence/3103837 "Exclusive: new G20 video evidence"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426060917/http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/law_order/exclusive+new+g20+video+evidence/3103837 |date=26 April 2009 }}, Channel 4 News, 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen months later, when announcing in July 2010 that no charges would be brought against Harwood, the Crown Prosecution Service still referred to him as "PC A."&lt;ref name=CPSstatement/&gt; It was only on that day that newspapers decided to name him.&lt;ref name=DoddJuly22&gt;Vikram Dodd, Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jul/22/ian-tomlinson-police-not-charged#start-of-comments "Ian Tomlinson death: police officer will not face criminal charges"], ''The Guardian'', 22 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harwood said he first realized on 8 April, when he saw the ''Guardian'' video, that Tomlinson had died. He reportedly collapsed at home and had to be taken to hospital by ambulance.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/17/ian-tomlinson-g20-protest-coroner Tomlinson officer questioned on suspicion of manslaughter], ''The Guardian'', 17 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Randall, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/the-man-who-was-trying-to-get-home-1667554.html "The man who was trying to get home"], ''The Independent on Sunday'', 12 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Harwood and three colleagues made themselves known to the IPCC that day.&lt;ref name=DoddLewisApril9&gt;Vikram Dodd, Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/09/g20-death-police-officer-suspended "G20 death: Police officer suspended"], ''The Guardian'', 9 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early accounts==

===First police statement===
{{Tomlinson timeline}}
The Met issued its first statement on 1 April at 11:36&amp;nbsp;pm, four hours after Tomlinson died, a statement approved by the IPCC's regional director for London. The statement said that police had been alerted that a man had collapsed and were attacked by "a number of missiles" as they tried to save his life, an allegation that was inaccurate, according to later media reports.{{efn|Metropolitan Police Service, 1 April 2009, 23:36 hours:{{pb}}"A member of the public went to a police officer on a cordon in Birchin Lane, junction with Cornhill to say that there was a man who had collapsed round the corner. That officer sent two police medics through the cordon line and into St Michaels Alley where they found a man who had stopped breathing. They called for [[London Ambulance Service|LAS]] support at about 1930. The officers gave him an initial check and cleared his airway before moving him back behind the cordon line to a clear area outside the Royal Exchange Building where they gave him [[CPR]]. The officers took the decision to move him as during this time a number of missiles&amp;nbsp;– believed to be bottles&amp;nbsp;– were being thrown at them. LAS took the man to hospital where he was pronounced dead."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/08/ian-tomlinson-g20-death-official-police-account "G20 fatality: How police view of Ian Tomlinson death changed"], ''The Guardian'', 8 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inquestJune2009&gt;[http://www.statewatch.org/news/2009/jun/uk-tomlinson-inquest-briefing-jun-09.pdf "Briefing on the death of Ian Tomlinson"], INQUEST, June 2009 (pdf).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}}}}

According to [[Nick Davies]] in ''The Guardian'', the statement was the result of an intense argument in the Met's press office, after an earlier draft had been rejected. He wrote that both the Met and IPCC said the statement represented the truth as they understood it at the time, and that there had been no allegation at that point that Tomlinson had come into contact with police. Davies asked why the IPCC were involved if they had not realized there had been police contact. He alleged that senior sources within the Met said privately that the assault on Tomlinson had been spotted by the police control room at Cobalt Street in south London, and that a chief inspector on the ground had also reported it. The Met issued a statement saying they had checked with every chief inspector who had been part of Operation Glencoe, and that none of them had called in such a report.&lt;ref name=DaviesApril27&gt;Nick Davies, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/apr/27/ipcc-police-g20-death-media "Can the police and the media trust each other?"], ''The Guardian'', 27 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The IPCC's guidelines at the time said that incidents should be referred to them where "persons have died or been seriously injured following some form of direct or indirect contact with the police and there is reason to believe that the contact may have caused or contributed to the death or serious injury."&lt;ref name=DaviesApril27/&gt;}}

===First eyewitness accounts===
[[File:Evening Standard headline about Ian Tomlinson, April 2 2009.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.35|alt=newspaper article|''Evening Standard'', 2 April 2009]]

On 2 April the Met handed responsibility for the investigation to the City of London police; the officer in charge was Detective Superintendent Anthony Crampton.&lt;ref name=LewisMay92011/&gt; After police briefings, the ''Evening Standard'' reported on 2 April that "police were bombarded with bricks, bottles and planks of wood" as they tried to save Tomlinson, forced by a barrage of missiles to carry him to a safe location to give him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Davenport, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110719071853/http://www.chickyog.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/esp67-02042009.pdf "Police pelted with bricks as they help dying man"], ''Evening Standard'', 2 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justin Davenport, Danny Brierley, [https://www.standard.co.uk/news/ring-of-steel-keeps-demos-away-from-world-leaders-6897646.html "Ring of steel keeps demos away from world leaders"], ''Evening Standard'', 2 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three police constables from the Hammersmith and Fulham police station—Nicholas Jackson, Andrew Moore, and Kerry Smith—told their supervisor, Inspector Wynne Jones, on 3 April that they had witnessed the incident. They can be seen in ''The Guardian'' video standing next to Tomlinson. Jackson was the first to tell the inspector; officers then contacted Moore and Smith, who had been standing next to Jackson at the time.&lt;ref name=LewisMay92011/&gt;

Jackson, Moore and Smith did not recognize Simon Harwood, the officer who struck Tomlinson, and according to the newspaper assumed he was with the City of London police. This was four days before ''The Guardian'' published the video. The inspector passed this information at 4:15 pm on 3 April to Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, the Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death. Hall said he passed it to the City of London police before the first autopsy was conducted that day by Freddy Patel, which according to ''The Guardian'' began at 5 pm.&lt;ref name=LewisMay92011/&gt;

==Post-mortem examinations==
===Overview===
An inquest was opened on 9 April 2009 by Paul Matthews, the City of London coroner. Three post-mortems were conducted: on 3 April by Mohmed Saeed Sulema "Freddy" Patel for Paul Matthews; on 9 April by Nathaniel Cary for the IPCC and Tomlinson's family; and on 22 April jointly by Kenneth Shorrock for the Metropolitan police and Ben Swift for Simon Harwood. The coroner was criticized for reportedly having failed to allow IPCC investigators to attend the first, and for failing to tell Tomlinson's family that they had a legal right to attend or send a representative. The family also said he had not told them where and when it was taking place.&lt;ref name=Dodd23July&gt;Vikram Dodd, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jul/23/ian-tomlinson-death-inquest-coroner "Ian Tomlinson coroner is urged to stand aside"], ''The Guardian'', 23 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Post-mortem===
According to Detective Sergeant Chandler of the City of London police, he was not told until the first post-mortem was over, or at an advanced stage, that three police officers had seen another officer hit and push Tomlinson. Apparently neither Patel nor the IPCC were told about the three witnesses. Patel said he was told only that the case was a "suspicious death"; the police had asked that he "rule out any assault or crush injuries associated with public order."&lt;ref name=LewisMay92011&gt;Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/may/09/ian-tomlinson-evidence-held-back "Ian Tomlinson evidence was held back from IPCC"], ''The Guardian'', 9 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/may/09/tomlinson-police-witness-baton-attack "Ian Tomlinson: key evidence that police withheld from coroner, IPCC and family"], ''The Guardian'', 9 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inquestJune2009/&gt;{{rp|4–5}}

Patel concluded that Tomlinson had died of [[coronary artery disease]]. His report noted "intraabdominal fluid blood about 3l with small blood clot," which was interpreted by medical experts to mean that he had found three litres of blood in Tomlinson's abdomen. This would have been around 60 percent of Tomlinson's total blood volume, a "highly significant indicator of the cause of death," according to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). In a report for the CPS a year later, on 5 April 2010, Patel wrote that he had meant "intraabdominal fluid with blood." He did not retain samples of the fluid for testing. This issue became pivotal regarding the decision not to prosecute Harwood.&lt;ref name=CPSstatement/&gt;&lt;ref name=Syal22July2010&gt;Rajeev Syal, Amelia Hill, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jul/22/case-against-police-officer-tomlinson-death "How the case against a police officer over Tomlinson death fell apart"], ''The Guardian'', 22 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker26June2012/&gt; The City of London police issued a statement on 4 April: "A post-mortem examination found he died of natural causes.

The IPCC told reporters that the post-mortem showed no bruising or scratches on Tomlinson's head and shoulders.&lt;ref name=FrescoONeillApril10/&gt; When the family asked the City of London police, after the post-mortem, whether there had been marks on Tomlinson's body, they were told no; according to ''The Guardian'', Detective Superintendent Anthony Crampton, who was leading the investigation, wrote in his log that he did not tell the family about a bruise and puncture marks on Tomlinson's leg to avoid causing "unnecessary stress or alarm."&lt;ref name=Judd&gt;Terry Judd, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/new-evidence-of-police-attacks-on-g20-victim-1666116.html "New evidence of police attacks on G20 victim"], ''The Independent'', 9 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 April ''The Observer'' published the first photograph of Tomlinson lying on the ground next to riot police.&lt;ref name=TownsendApril52009&gt;Mark Townsend, Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/05/g20-protest-ian-tomlinson "Police 'assaulted' bystander who died during G20 protests"], ''The Observer'', 5 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; After it was published, Freddy Patel was asked to return to the mortuary, where he made a note of bruising on Tomlinson's head that he had not noticed when he first examined him.&lt;ref name=LewisMay92011/&gt; On 24 April Sky News obtained an image of Tomlinson after he collapsed, which showed bruising on the right side of his forehead.&lt;ref name=Skypic24April2009&gt;Martin Brunt, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090427071243/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/G20-Protest-Picture-Shows-Ian-Tomlinson-Had-Head-Injury-After-Being-Pushed-To-Ground-By-Police/Article/200904415268375?lpos=UK_News_Carousel_Region_0&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15268375_G20_Protest_Picture_Shows_Ian_Tomlinson_Had_Head_Injury_After_Being_Pushed_To_Ground_By_Police "Pic Shows G20 Protest Victim's Head Injury"], ''Sky News'', 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Pallister, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/24/ian-tomlinson-g20-protest-death "New Ian Tomlinson photo appears to show head injury before G20 death"], ''The Guardian'', 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second and third post-mortem===
The IPCC removed the Tomlinson inquiry from the City of London police on 8 April. A second post-mortem, ordered jointly by the IPCC and Tomlinson's family, was carried out that day by Nathaniel Cary, known for his work on high-profile cases.&lt;ref name="LewisDoddApril10/2"&gt;Paul Lewis Lewis, Vikram Dodd, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/10/g20-assault-investigation "Ian Tomlinson death: G20 riot officer in footage has not been interviewed"], ''The Guardian'', 10 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Cary found that Tomlinson had died because of internal bleeding from blunt force trauma to the abdomen, in association with cirrhosis of the liver.&lt;ref name=DoddCary22July&gt;Vikram Dodd, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jul/22/second-expert-pc-actions-g20-death "Second expert has 'no doubt' PC's actions contributed to G20 death"], ''The Guardian'', 22 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that Tomlinson had fallen on his elbow, which he said "impacted in the area of his liver causing an internal bleed which led to his death a few minutes later."&lt;ref name=Rayner22July&gt;Gordon Rayner, Caroline Gammell, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/g20-summit/7904244/G20-riots-policeman-escapes-charges-over-Ian-Tomlinsons-death.html "G20 riots: policeman escapes charges over Ian Tomlinson's death"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 22 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the conflicting conclusions of the first two, a third post-mortem was conducted on 22 April by Kenneth Shorrock on behalf of the Metropolitan police, and Ben Swift on behalf of Simon Harwood. Shorrock and Swift agreed with the results of the second autopsy. The Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death, Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, told the pathologists before the final post-mortem that Tomlinson had fallen to the ground in front of a police van earlier in the evening, although there was no evidence that this had happened. The IPCC ruled in May 2011 that Hall had been reckless in making this claim, but had not intended to mislead.&lt;ref name=LewisIPCCMay92011&gt;Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/may/09/ian-tomlinson-death "IPCC rules Met officer 'reckless' in conduct"], ''The Guardian'', 9 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For IPCC reports, [http://anonymouse.org/cgi-bin/anon-www.cgi/http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/investigations/ian-tomlinson-metropolitan-police-service "Ian Tomlinson - Metropolitan Police Service"], IPCC, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/en/Documents/pathologists_090511.pdf "Complaint that misinformation was supplied"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807131557/http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/en/Documents/pathologists_090511.pdf |date=7 August 2011 }}, IPCC, 20 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freddy Patel===
At the time of Tomlinson's death, Patel was on the Home Office's register of accredited [[forensic pathologist]]s. He qualified as a doctor at the [[University of Zambia]] in 1974, and registered to practise in the UK in 1988.&lt;ref name=Bowcott12July&gt;Owen Bowcott, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jul/12/ian-tomlinson-pathologist-accused-incompetence-autopsies "Ian Tomlinson pathologist accused of incompetence over autopsies"], ''The Guardian'', 12 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Metropolitan Police had written to the Home Office in 2005 raising concerns about his work. At the time of Tomlinson's death he did not have a contract with the police to conduct post-mortems in cases of suspicious death.&lt;ref name=Lewis22July&gt;Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jul/22/ian-tomlinson-story-justice-denied "Ian Tomlinson: a story of justice denied"], ''The Guardian'', 22 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Patel was reprimanded by the General Medical Council (GMC) for having released medical details about [[Death of Roger Sylvester|Roger Sylvester]], a man who had died in police custody.&lt;ref name=Bowcott12July/&gt; In 2002 the police dropped a criminal inquiry because Patel said the victim, Sally White, had died of a heart attack with no signs of violence, although she was reportedly found naked with bruising to her body, an injury to her head and a bite mark on her thigh. [[Anthony Hardy]], a mentally ill alcoholic who lived in the flat in which her body was found locked in a bedroom, later murdered two women and placed their body parts in bin bags.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Osley, [https://web.archive.org/web/20040123150247/http://www.camdennewjournal.co.uk/archive/n271103_2.htm "Inquest dismissed signs of violence"], ''Camden New Journal'', 27 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis11April2009&gt;Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/11/g20-pathologist-ian-tomlinson "Pathologist in Ian Tomlinson G20 death case was reprimanded over conduct"], ''The Guardian'', 11 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The police investigated Patel in relation to that autopsy, but the investigation was dropped.&lt;ref name="GammellPatel"/&gt;
In response to the criticism, Patel said the GMC reprimand was a long time ago, and that his findings in the Sally White case had not been contested.&lt;ref name=Lewis11April2009/&gt;

Patel was suspended from the government's register of pathologists in July 2009, pending a GMC inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Johnston, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090708061051/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/g20-summit/5749486/Officer-under-investigation-over-Ian-Tomlinsons-death-should-not-have-been-working-for-Met.html "Officer under investigation over Ian Tomlinson's death 'should not have been working for Met'"], ''The Sunday Telegraph'', 5 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The inquiry concerned 26 charges related to autopsies in four other cases. In one case Patel was accused of having failed to spot signs of abuse on the body of a five-year-old girl who had died after a fall at home, and of having failed to check with the hospital about its investigation into her injuries. The child's body was exhumed for a second postmortem, and her mother was convicted.&lt;ref name=GammellPatel&gt;Caroline Gammell, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/g20-summit/7904804/G20-riots-profile-of-Dr-Freddy-Patel.html "G20 riots: profile of Dr Freddy Patel"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 23 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The hearings concluded in August 2010; Patel was suspended for three months for "deficient professional performance."&lt;ref name=Lewis6Sept&gt;Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/sep/06/ian-tomlinson-coroner-inquest "Ian Tomlinson coroner asks for judge to preside over inquest"], ''The Guardian'', 6 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011 the GMC opened an investigation into his handling of the Tomlinson post-mortem.&lt;ref&gt;Owen Bowcott, Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/may/05/freddy-patel-investigated-ian-tomlinson-autopsy "Pathologist Freddy Patel investigated over Ian Tomlinson postmortem"], ''The Guardian'', 5 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker26June2012&gt;Peter Walker, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/26/ian-tomlinson-pathologist-forensic-evidence "Ian Tomlinson pathologist threw away forensic evidence, court told"], ''The Guardian'', 26 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He was struck off the medical register in August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19355106 "Ian Tomlinson pathologist Dr Freddy Patel struck off"], BBC News, 23 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 April ''The Observer'' (the ''Guardian'''s sister paper) published the first photograph of Tomlinson lying on the ground next to riot police.&lt;ref name="TownsendApril52009"/&gt; Over the next few days the IPCC told reporters that Tomlinson's family were not surprised that he had had a heart attack. When journalists asked whether he had been in contact with police officers before his death, they were told the speculation would upset the family.&lt;ref name=LavilleLewisApril9&gt;Sandra Laville, Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/09/g20-police-assault-ian-tomlinson-g20 "G20 assault: how Metropolitan police tried to manage a death"], ''The Guardian'', 9 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Guardian'' video===
{{Tomlinson images}}
The first ''Guardian'' video was shot on a digital camera by an investment fund manager from New York who was in London on business, and who attended the protests out of curiosity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/video/2009/apr/07/g20-police-assault-video ''Guardian''/American businessman video], published 7 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On his way to Heathrow airport, he realized that the man he had filmed being assaulted was the man who had reportedly died of a heart attack. At that point, 2 am on 7 April, he passed his footage to ''The Guardian'', which published it on its website that afternoon. The newspaper passed a copy to the IPCC,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/08/ian-tomlinson-cameraman-inquiry "Man who filmed Ian Tomlinson G20 attack backs investigation"], ''The Guardian'', 8 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; which opened a criminal inquiry.&lt;ref name=LewisMay92011/&gt;

===Channel 4 video===
A video by Ken McCallum, a cameraman for Channel&amp;nbsp;4 News, was broadcast on 8 April. Shot from a different angle, the footage shows Harwood draw his arm back to head height before bringing the baton down on Tomlinson's legs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/video/2009/apr/08/g20-police-assault-ian-tomlinson-video Channel 4/Ken McCallum video], broadcast 8 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; McCallum was filming another incident at the time; the Tomlinson incident was unfolding in the background, unseen by the journalists but recorded by the camera. Half an hour later [[Alex Thomson (journalist)|Alex Thomson]], chief correspondent of Channel&amp;nbsp;4 News, was doing a live broadcast when the camera was damaged. It took engineers days to recover the tape, which is when they saw that Tomlinson's assault was on it.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Thomson, [http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/domestic_politics/truth+behind+tomlinson+footage/3086007 "Truth behind Tomlinson footage"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415142830/http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/domestic_politics/truth+behind+tomlinson+footage/3086007 |date=15 April 2009 }}, Channel 4 News, 13 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nabeela Zahir video===
On 9 April ''The Guardian'' published footage from Nabeela Zahir, a freelance journalist, showing Tomlinson after his collapse. The police can be seen moving away at least one woman who tried to help him, and a man, Daniel McPhee, who was on the phone to the ambulance services. The footage shows that the Met's initial claim that there had been a barrage of missiles from protesters while police tried to save Tomlinson was inaccurate. Protesters can be heard calling for calm; one shouts "Don't throw anything." According to ''The Guardian'', 56 seconds into the video, three officers can be seen with their face masks pulled halfway up their faces.&lt;ref name=NabeelaZahirvideo&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/09/g20-video-ian-tomlinson-death Nabeela Zahir video], published 9 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cornhill video===
''The Guardian'' obtained a four-minute video on 21 April from an anonymous bystander who had been filming on Cornhill between 7:10 and 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm. The footage shows Tomlinson standing behind a bicycle rack in Royal Exchange Passage with his hands in his pockets, and a group of advancing police officers. When a police dog approaches him, he turns his back. At that point, he is hit on the legs and pushed by the TSG constable, and can be seen scraping along the ground on the right side of his forehead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/video/2009/apr/21/g20-ian-tomlinson-new-video ''Guardian'' Cornhill video], from 01:09 mins, published 21 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Eyewitnesses said they heard a noise as his head hit the ground. The IPCC sought an injunction against the broadcast of the video by Channel&amp;nbsp;4 News, but a judge rejected the application.&lt;ref name=Lewis22April2009&gt;Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/22/new-ian-tomlinson-g20-video "G20 protest footage shows moment Ian Tomlinson's head hit the pavement"], ''The Guardian'', 22 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; An image obtained by Sky News on 24 April appears to show bruising on the right side of Tomlinson's forehead.

===CCTV cameras===
Nick Hardwick, chair of the IPCC, said on 9 April that there were no CCTV cameras in the area.&lt;ref name=GuruMurphy/&gt; On 14 April the ''Evening Standard'' wrote that it had found at least six CCTV cameras in the area around the assault. After photographs of the cameras were published, the IPCC reversed its position and said its investigators were looking at footage from cameras in [[Threadneedle Street]] near the corner of Royal Exchange Passage.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dominiczak, Lucy Proctor, Kiran Randhawa, [https://www.standard.co.uk/news/we-were-wrong-over-cctv-says-police-watchdog-6858214.html "We were wrong over CCTV, says police watchdog"], ''Evening Standard, 14 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/14/ian-tomlinson-assault-film-ipcc "Police watchdog chief wrong to say no CCTV in area of Ian Tomlinson assault"], ''The Guardian'', 14 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early reaction and analysis==
===British policing===
[[File:G20 climate camp police kettling protesters.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=photograph|[[2009 G-20 London summit protests#Climate Camp|Climate Camp]], [[Bishopsgate]], 1 April 2009]]
Tomlinson's death sparked a discussion about the nature of Britain's policing and the relationship between the police, public, media and IPCC.&lt;ref name="Lyall"/&gt; The mayor of London, [[Boris Johnson]], dismissed the criticism of the police as "an orgy of cop bashing."&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Bleaken, [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/apr/23/boris-johnson-g20-police-media "Boris Johnson condemns media response to G20 policing"], ''The Guardian'', 23 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The death was compared to others that had acted as a watershed in the public's perception of policing, including that of [[Blair Peach]] (1979), [[Murder of Stephen Lawrence|Stephen Lawrence]] (1993) and [[Jean Charles de Menezes]] (2005).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/nov/25/ian-tomlinson-death-changed-policing "How Ian Tomlinson's death at the G20 protests changed policing"], ''The Guardian'', 25 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alison Roberts, [https://www.standard.co.uk/news/i-thought-oh-my-god-its-like-blair-peach-over-again-6908754.html "I thought 'Oh my God, it's like Blair Peach over again'"], ''Evening Standard'', 15 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The IPCC was criticized for having taken seven days from Tomlinson's death, and five days after hearing evidence that police may have been involved, to remove the City of London police from the investigation.&lt;ref name=GuruMurphy&gt;Krishnan Guru-Murthy, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090411171856/http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/law_order/ipcc%2Bcctv%2Bwasnt%2Bworking/3078297 "IPCC: CCTV wasn't working"], Channel 4 News, 9 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The IPCC had been criticized before for not being responsive to public concerns. On 11 January 2008, the Police Action Law Group (over 100 lawyers who specialize in police complaints) resigned from the IPCC's advisory body, citing a failure to provide adequate oversight; a pattern of favouritism towards the police, with complaints being turned down despite strong evidence; indifference and rudeness towards complainants; delays stretching over several years; and key decisions being made by managers with little or no legal training or relevant experience. They wrote to Hardwick that there was "increasing dismay and disillusionment" at the "consistently poor quality of decision-making at all levels of the IPCC."&lt;ref&gt;Nick Davies, [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/feb/25/police.law1 "Crisis at police watchdog as lawyers resign"], ''The Guardian'', 25 February 2008; also see question 71 in [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmselect/cmpubacc/335/8112406.htm Supplementary memorandum from the Independent Police Complaints Commission], Independent Police Complaints Commission, Public Accounts Committee, undated.&lt;/ref&gt; {{pb}}Hardwick responded that some of the examples cited were the legacy of the previous oversight body, the Police Complaints Authority. He acknowledged that the IPCC struggled, shortly after it was set up in 2004, to cope with the number of cases it had inherited. Denied that there was any pattern of favouritism toward the police, he said the IPCC robustly defends its independence and impartiality.&lt;ref name=Hardwick&gt;Nick Hardwick, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/27/police "Yes, we are independent – and we've cut down delays too"], ''The Guardian'', 27 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

David Gilbertson, a former assistant inspector who had worked for the Home Office formulating policing policy, told ''The New York Times'' that the British police used to act with the sanction of the public, but that tactics had changed after a series of violent assaults on officers in the 1990s. Now dressing in military-style uniforms and equipped with anti-stab vests, extendable metal batons and clubs that turn into handcuffs, an entire generation of officers has come to regard the public as the enemy, the newspaper said.&lt;ref name=Lyall/&gt;

===''The Guardian'', police and IPCC===
[[File:The Guardian Building Window in London.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=photograph|Offices of ''The Guardian'' and ''The Observer'']]
Tomlinson's death was confirmed in a statement that accused protesters of having hampered police efforts to save his life. His family were not told he had died until nine hours after his death.&lt;ref name=inquestJune2009/&gt;{{rp|9}} The police and IPCC told journalists that his family were not surprised to hear he had had a heart attack. Journalists who asked whether police had had any contact with Tomlinson were asked not to speculate in case it upset the family. Direct contact with the family was refused. The police issued a statement on behalf of the family instead, which said the police were keeping them informed.&lt;ref name=LavilleLewisApril9/&gt;

''The Observer'' (''The Guardian'''s sister paper) published an image of Tomlinson on the ground on Sunday, 5 April. That morning Tomlinson's family attended the scene of his death, where they met [[Paul Lewis (journalist)|Paul Lewis]], a ''Guardian'' reporter who had worked on ''The Observer'' story. Tomlinson's wife said this meeting was the first the family had heard of police contact with Tomlinson before his death.&lt;ref name=LewisfamilyAug6&gt;Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/aug/06/ian-tomlinson-family-accuse-police-of-cover-up "Ian Tomlinson's family accuse police of cover-up over his death"], ''The Guardian'', 6 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The family's police liaison officer later approached the newspaper to say he was "extremely unhappy" that Lewis had spoken to the family, and that the newspaper had to stay away from them for 48 hours. The IPCC accused the newspaper of "doorstepping the family at a time of grief." On the same day, the IPCC briefed other journalists that there was nothing in the story that Tomlinson might have been assaulted by police.&lt;ref name=LavilleLewisApril9/&gt; During this period, according to Tomlinson's family, they were prevented from seeing his body; they were first allowed to see him six days after his death.&lt;ref name=LewisfamilyAug6/&gt;

On 7 April ''The Guardian'' published the American banker's video, and later that evening handed it to an IPCC investigator and a City of London police officer who arrived at the newspaper's offices.&lt;ref name=LavilleLewisApril9/&gt;&lt;ref name=IPCCstatementApril8&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/08/g20-death-police-ian-tomlinson "Full statement from the IPCC on the investigation into the death of Ian Tomlinson"], ''The Guardian'', 8 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The officers asked that the video be removed from the website, arguing that it jeopardized their inquiry and was not helpful to the family. Nick Hardwick, chair of the IPCC, said the IPCC had asked ''The Guardian'' to remove the video only because it would have been better had witnesses not seen it before being questioned.&lt;ref name=GuruMurphy/&gt;

===Metropolitan police response===
[[File:Sir Denis O'Connor QPM speaking on The Importance of a Plan to Win.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Denis O'Connor (police officer)|Denis O'Connor]], 2012]]
The Chief Inspector of Constabulary, [[Denis O'Connor (police officer)|Denis O'Connor]], published a 150-page report in November 2009 that aimed to restore Britain's consent-based model of policing.&lt;ref name=LewisLavilleNov25/&gt;

O'Connor wrote that there had been a hardening of police attitudes, with officers believing that proportionality meant [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]]. The deployment of officers in riot gear had become a routine response to lawful protest, largely the result of an ignorance of the law and a lack of leadership from the Home Office and police chiefs. Officers were being trained to use their riot shields as weapons. Police forces across the country differed in their training, the equipment they had access to, and their understanding of the law. The failure to understand the relevant legislation was in part due to its complexity, the report said, with 90 amendments to the Public Order Act passed since 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Denis O'Connor, [https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20090824024746/http://www.met.police.uk/news/docs/g20_final_report.pdf ''Adapting to protest''], Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sean O'Neill, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article6932097.ece "Policing principles undermined by riot tactics, says Denis O'Connor"], ''The Times'', 26 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LewisLavilleNov25&gt;Paul Lewis, Sandra Laville, [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/nov/25/police-g20-inquiry-report "G20 report lays down the law to police on use of force"], ''The Guardian'', 25 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The report made several recommendations, including the creation of a set of national principles emphasizing the minimum use of force at all times, and making the display of police ID a legal requirement.&lt;ref name=OConnor2009p57&gt;[https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20090824024746/http://www.met.police.uk/news/docs/g20_final_report.pdf O'Connor 2009], pp.&amp;nbsp;57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010 the Met announced that 8,000 of its officers had been issued with embroidered epaulettes, as several had complained that the numbers were falling off, rather than being removed deliberately.&lt;ref&gt;Rose Rouse, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/feb/28/riot-police-badge-numbers "How the police fell in love with embroidery"], ''The Guardian'', 28 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal aftermath==
===Decision not to prosecute===
[[File:Keir Starmer QC, Director of Public Prosecutions, Crown Prosecution Service, UK (8450776372).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[Keir Starmer]], director of the CPS, announced in 2010 that there would be no prosecution because of the disagreement between the pathologists.&lt;ref name=CPSstatement/&gt;]]

In April 2010 ''The Guardian'' published an open letter from several public figures asking the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to proceed with a prosecution or explain its position.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/apr/01/ian-tomlinson-wait-answers "A year on, we still wait for answers about Ian Tomlinson's death"], ''The Guardian'', 1 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In July that year [[Keir Starmer]], director of the CPS, announced that there would be no prosecution because of the medical disagreement between the three pathologists. Starmer said there was enough evidence for an assault charge, but the six-month deadline for that had expired.&lt;ref name=CPSstatement/&gt;

The area of conflict concerned Patel's finding during the first autopsy of "intraabdominal fluid blood about 3l with small blood clot." This was interpreted by other medical experts to mean that Patel had found three litres of blood in Tomlinson's abdomen. Starmer said this would have been around 60 percent of Tomlinson's blood volume, a "highly significant indicator of the cause of death."&lt;ref name=CPSstatement/&gt;

In April 2010 Patel introduced an ambiguity in a second report for the CPS, saying he had found "intraabdominal fluid {{em|with}} blood about 3l with small blood clot" [emphasis added]. The ambiguity had to be clarified, because the second and third pathologists had relied in part on Patel's original notes to form their views. Patel was interviewed twice by the CPS. According to Starmer, Patel "maintained that the total fluid was somewhat in excess of three litres but that it was mainly [[ascites]] (a substance which forms in a damaged liver), which had been stained with blood. He had not retained the fluid nor had he sampled it in order to ascertain the proportion of blood because, he said, he had handled blood all his professional life and he knew that this was not blood but blood-stained ascites." Patel also said he had found no internal rupture that would have led to this degree of blood loss.&lt;ref name=CPSstatement&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jul/22/cps-statement-death-ian-tomlinson "CPS statement on the death of Ian Tomlinson"], ''The Guardian'', 22 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several conclusions were drawn from discussions between Patel and the CPS, Starmer said: (a) because Patel had not retained or sampled the three litres of fluid, no firm conclusions could be drawn about the nature of it; (b) for Tomlinson's death to have resulted so quickly from blood loss, there would have to have been a significant internal rupture; (c) Patel found no such rupture; (d) the later postmortems also found no visible rupture; and (e) because Patel was the only person to have examined Tomlinson's intact body, he was in the best position to judge the nature of the fluid, and whether there was a rupture that could have caused it. This meant that Patel's evidence would significantly undermine the evidence of the second and third pathologists.&lt;ref name=CPSstatement/&gt;

Nathaniel Cary, the second pathologist, objected to the CPS's decision. Cary told ''The Guardian'' that the push had caused a haemorrhage to Tomlinson's abdomen, and the haemorrhage caused him to collapse. Cary said Tomlinson was vulnerable to this because he had liver disease.&lt;ref name=DoddCary22July/&gt; The CPS had erred in dismissing a charge of [[actual bodily harm]] (ABH), in his view. In a letter to Tomlinson's family, the CPS described Tomlinson's injuries as "relatively minor" and therefore insufficient to support such a charge. But Cary told ''The Guardian'': "The injuries were not relatively minor. He sustained quite a large area of bruising. Such injuries are consistent with a baton strike, which could amount to ABH. It's extraordinary. If that's not ABH I would like to know what is."&lt;ref name=DoddLewis23July&gt;Vikram Dodd, Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jul/22/ian-tomlinson-g20-cps-ruling "Advice to charge police officer over Ian Tomlinson death ignored"], ''The Guardian'', 23 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inquest===
The inquest was opened and adjourned in April 2009. The City of London coroner, Paul Matthews, expressed concern about whether he had appropriate expertise, and [[Peter Thornton (judge)|Peter Thornton QC]], who specializes in protest law, took over.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/nov/10/ian-tomlinson-inquest-thornton "Ian Tomlinson death: senior judge appointed to oversee inquest"], ''The Guardian'', 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2011/mar/29/ian-tomlinson-inquest-live-updates#block-27 "Ian Tomlinson inquest"], ''The Guardian'', 29 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The inquest opened on 28 March 2011 before a jury. The court heard from Kevin Channer, a cardiologist at Royal Hallamshire Hospital, who analysed [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) data from the defibrillator paramedics had used on Tomlinson. He said the readings were inconsistent with an arrhythmic heart attack, but consistent with death from internal bleeding. Pathologist Nat Carey concurred regarding the cause of death. Graeme Alexander, a [[Hepatology|hepatologist]], said that in his opinion Tomlinson had died of internal bleeding as a result of trauma to the liver after the fall. He told the court that Tomlinson had been suffering from serious liver disease, which would have made him susceptible to collapse from internal bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lewis, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/apr/18/ian-tomlinson-inquest-death-heart-attack-disputed "Ian Tomlinson did not die of heart attack, specialist tells inquest"], ''The Guardian'', 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Giving evidence over three days, Harwood said that Tomlinson "just looked as if he was going to stay where he was forever and was almost inviting physical confrontation in terms of being moved on." He said he had not warned Tomlinson and had acted because Tomlinson was encroaching a police line, which amounted to a breach of the peace.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8432253/Ian-Tomlinson-was-amost-inviting-physical-confrontation-says-G20-officer.html "Ian Tomlinson was 'amost inviting physical confrontation' says G20 officer"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 6 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The court heard that Tomlinson's last words after collapsing were, "they got me, the fuckers got me"; he died moments later. On 3 May 2011 the jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing, ruling that the officer—Harwood was not named for legal reasons—had used excessive and unreasonable force in hitting Tomlinson, and had acted "illegally, recklessly and dangerously."&lt;ref name=TelegraphMay32011&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8490125/G20-protests-Ian-Tomlinson-unlawfully-killed-by-PC-inquest-rules.html "G20 protests: Ian Tomlinson unlawfully killed by PC, inquest rules"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 3 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2011/may/03/ian-tomlinson-inquest-verdict-live-blog?INTCMP=SRCH "Ian Tomlinson inquest verdict"], ''The Guardian'', 3 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/press_statements/cps_statement_following_conclusion_of_inquest_into_death_of_ian_tomlinson_/ "CPS statement following conclusion of inquest into death of Ian Tomlinson"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130173055/http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/press_statements/cps_statement_following_conclusion_of_inquest_into_death_of_ian_tomlinson_/ |date=30 January 2012 }}, Crown Prosecution Service, 3 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===IPCC reports===
In May 2011 the IPCC released three reports into Tomlinson's death, written between April 2010 and May 2011. The main report contained material revealed during the inquest. The third report detailed an allegation from Tomlinson's family that the police had offered misleading information to the pathologists before the third autopsy on 22 April 2009. The Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death, Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, had told the pathologists that Tomlinson had fallen to the ground in front of a police van earlier in the evening, although there was no evidence to support this. The IPCC ruled that Hall had been reckless in making this claim, but had not intended to mislead the pathologists.&lt;ref name=LewisIPCCMay92011/&gt;

Keir Starmer, director of the CPS, announced on 24 May 2011 that a summons for manslaughter had been issued against Harwood. He said the CPS had reviewed its decision not to prosecute because new medical evidence had emerged during the inquest, and because the various medical accounts, including that of the first pathologist, had been tested during questioning.&lt;ref name=Starmerreview&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/video/2011/may/24/ian-tomlinson-police-manslaughter-video "Statement from Keir Starmer"], ''The Guardian'', 24 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The trial opened on 18 June 2012. Harwood entered a plea of not guilty, and was acquitted on 19 July.&lt;ref name=WalkerLewis19July2012/&gt;

The court was shown extensive video footage of Tomlinson and Harwood on the day. Harwood was seen trying to arrest a man who had daubed graffiti on a police van, then joining a line of officers who were clearing Royal Exchange Passage. Harwood pushed a man who blew a [[vuvuzela]] at him, then appeared to push a BBC cameraman who was filming the arrest of another man. The footage showed Harwood push a third man out of the way, and shortly after this (the passageway now almost empty) the officers reached Tomlinson.&lt;ref name=Walker19June2012&gt;Peter Walker, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/19/ian-tomlinson-jury-video "Ian Tomlinson jury shown video of moments before his death"], ''The Guardian'', 19 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Ward, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9341840/G20-protests-Tomlinson-family-weep-at-final-footage.html "G20 protests: Tomlinson family weep at final footage"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 19 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Dennis QC, for the prosecution, argued that Harwood's use of force against Tomlinson had been unnecessary and unreasonable, and had caused Tomlinson's death. He argued that a "clear temporal link" between the incident and Tomlinson's collapse had been provided by the ''Guardian video'', that Tomlinson had posed no threat, and that the use of force had been a "gratuitous act of aggression."&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;Victoria Ward, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9339247/Officer-who-struck-out-at-Ian-Tomlinson-had-lost-control.html "Officer who struck out at Ian Tomlinson had 'lost control'"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 18 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The defence argued that Tomlinson's health was relevant. The court heard that he had liver and brain disease caused by alcohol abuse, numbness in his legs and balance problems, and that he had been treated at least 20 times between 2007 and 2009, mostly at A&amp;E departments, related to falling while drunk. On the day he died, ''The Times'' reported, he had drunk a bottle of red wine, a small bottle of vodka and several cans of 9-per-cent super-strength lager.&lt;ref&gt;"Tomlinson's sudden death 'did not obey any of the medical rules'", ''The Times'', 20 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harwood told the court that Tomlinson had ignored orders to move along. He acknowledged that he had pushed Tomlinson firmly, but said he had not expected him to fall.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Walker, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/02/ian-tomlinson-police-officer-court "Ian Tomlinson seemed deliberately obstructive, police officer tells court"], ''The Guardian'', 2 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He also acknowledged that he had "got it wrong," and said he had not realized Tomlinson was in such poor health. The jury found him not guilty after deliberating for four days.&lt;ref name=WalkerLewis19July2012/&gt;

===Dismissal, civil suit===
Harwood was dismissed from the Metropolitan Police Service in September 2012 after a disciplinary hearing found that he had acted with "gross misconduct" in his actions towards Tomlinson.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Walker, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/17/ian-tomlinson-death-simon-harwood-misconduct "Ian Tomlinson case: PC Simon Harwood guilty of gross misconduct"], ''The Guardian'', 17 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Tomlinson's family filed a lawsuit against the Metropolitan Police, which paid the family an undisclosed sum in August 2013. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Maxine de Brunner issued a formal apology for "Simon Harwood's use of excessive and unlawful force, which caused Mr Tomlinson's death, and for the suffering and distress caused to his family as a result."&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Taylor, [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/05/ian-tomlinson-apology-met-police "Ian Tomlinson's family win apology from Met police over death in 2009"], ''The Guardian'', 5 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, two or three days earlier, the symptoms of approaching death can be observed as saliva accumulates in the throat, making it very difficult to take even a spoonful of water. Related symptoms can include [[Dyspnea|shortness of breath]] and rapid chest movement.  While death rattle is a strong indication that someone is near death,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last1 = Wee | first1 = B. | last2 = Hillier | first2 = R. | editor1-last = Wee | editor1-first = B. | title = Interventions for noisy breathing in patients near to death | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 1 | pages = CD005177 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18254072 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005177.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it can also be produced by other problems that cause interference with the swallowing reflex, such as [[Traumatic brain injury|brain injuries]].&lt;ref name=EPERC/&gt;

It is sometimes misinterpreted as the sound of the person [[choking]] to death, or alternatively, that they are [[gargling]]. 

== Timing ==
This symptom most commonly appears sometime during the last 24 hours of the person's life, although some people live somewhat longer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/875629996|title=Oxford Textbook of Palliative Nursing|last=Ferrell|first=Betty|last2=Coyle|first2=Nessa|last3=Paice|first3=Judith A.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780199332342|edition=4th|location=|pages=253–255|oclc=875629996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==
The dying person is usually unaware of the noisy breathing and is not disturbed by it, but some healthcare providers attempt to minimize the sound for the emotional comfort of family members and caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/fundamentals/death-and-dying/when-death-is-near|title=When Death Is Near - Fundamentals - Merck Manuals Consumer Version|work=Merck Manuals Consumer Version|access-date=2017-06-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be done through repositioning the person, reducing the volume of [[IV fluids]] being given, or giving anticholinergic drugs to reduce secretions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In [[hospice]] and [[palliative care]], drugs such as [[glycopyrronium]], [[hyoscine hydrobromide]] ([[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]]) or [[atropine]] may be used for their [[anticholinergic]] effects to reduce secretions and minimize this effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Letizia|first2=M.|year=2009|title=Understanding and responding to the death rattle in dying patients|journal=Medsurg Nursing|volume=18|issue=1|pages=17–21, 32; quiz 22|pmid=19331295|last1=Hipp|first1=B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diploblasty''' is a condition of the [[blastula]] in which there are two primary [[germ layer]]s: the [[ectoderm]] and [[endoderm]].

Diploblastic organisms are organisms which develop from such a blastula, and include [[cnidaria]] and [[ctenophora]], formerly grouped together in the phylum Coelenterata, but later understanding of their differences resulted in their being placed in separate phyla.

The endoderm allows them to develop true [[Biological tissue|tissue]]. This includes tissue associated with the gut and associated glands. The ectoderm, on the other hand, gives rise to the epidermis, the nervous tissue, and if present, nephridia.

Simpler animals, such as [[sea sponges]], have one germ layer and lack true tissue organization.

All the more complex animals (from flat worms to humans) are [[triploblastic]] with three germ layers (a [[mesoderm]] as well as ectoderm and endoderm). The mesoderm allows them to develop true [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]].

Groups of diploblastic animals alive today include jellyfish, corals, sea anemones and comb jellies.

'''Edna Adan Maternity Hospital''' is a [[non-profit]] charity [[hospital]] built in [[Hargeisa]], [[Somaliland]]. It was founded by the autonomous&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/02/world/africa/02somalia.html No Winner Seen in Somalia's Battle With Chaos] New York Times, June 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; northwestern [[Somaliland]] region's former [[foreign minister]] and former [[first lady]] of Somalia, [[Edna Adan Ismail]]. The hospital has as its primary mission to provide better health care to people whose lives have been traumatized by war, and also to provide training for nurses, midwives, and other health workers. In addition to services and facilities relating specifically to maternal and infant health care, the hospital has diagnostic laboratory facilities and an emergency [[blood bank]], and offers diagnosis and treatment for [[sexually transmitted diseases]].

The hospital seeks to fill not only the urgent need for health care but also to provide&amp;nbsp;— in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, [[UNICEF]], and [[WHO]] – training for a new generation of [[nurses]] and [[midwives]] qualified to provide [[Reproductive Health]] care throughout the Somaliland region.

Another aspect of the hospital's mission is to combat the practice of [[female circumcision]], which is endemic to the region. Mothers of newborn girls are counseled on the dangers of having their child circumcised, but the tradition is strongly ingrained in the culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forwarduk.org.uk/news/news/303 Edna Adan discusses Female Genital Mutilation in Somaliland] at Ohio University, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Edna Adan Ismail, with graduate nurses.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edna Adan Ismail]] with a class of nursing school graduates]]
Following the [[Somali Civil War]], the entire health infrastructure of Somaliland was effectively destroyed and there were few, if any, trained medical personnel remaining in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(06)69047-8/fulltext Working together to rebuild health care in post-conflict Somaliland] report by the medical journal [[The Lancet]], Sept. 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of maternal and infant mortality was among the highest in the world. Edna Adan donated her [[united nations|U.N.]] [[pension]] and other personal assets to build the hospital so that she might help to address the grave health crisis.

Needing, first of all, a place to build her hospital, she asked the government for land near the city center. They responded by offering her 9600 square meters which previously had served as a garbage dump.

The construction of the hospital was started on January 1, 1998 and as it progressed, private individuals, business people in Somaliland and elsewhere, as well as international organizations, also made valuable contributions enabling the hospital to become functional on the March 9, 2002.

[[Direct Relief International]] describes the hospital as Somaliland's premier referral center for obstetric emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.directrelief.org/WhereWeWork/Somalia/EdnaAdanHospital.aspx Edna Adan Maternity and Teaching Hospital] profile at [[Direct Relief International]].&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital trains nurses and midwives under the close supervision of Mrs. Ismail, herself a trained nurse, whose residence is inside of the hospital.

[[Image:Youth and Time 1901.jpg|thumb|''Youth and Time'', [[John William Godward]], 1901]]

'''Eternal youth''' is the concept of human physical [[immortality]] free of [[ageing]]. The [[youth]] referred to is usually meant to be in contrast to the depredations of aging, rather than a specific age of the human lifespan. Achieving eternal youth so far remains beyond the capabilities of scientific technology. However, much research is being conducted in the sciences of genetics which may allow manipulation of the aging process in the future.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Eternal youth is common in mythology, and is a popular theme in [[fiction]].

==Religion and mythology==
Eternal youth is a characteristic of the inhabitants of [[Paradise]] in [[Abrahamic religion]]s.

The Hindus believe that the Vedic and the post-Vedic rishis have attained immortality, which implies the ability to change one's body's age or even shape at will. These are some of the [[siddha]]s in [[Yoga]]. [[Markandeya]] is said to always stay at the age of 16.

The difference between eternal life and the more specific eternal youth is a recurrent theme in [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. The [[mytheme]] of requesting the boon of immortality from a god, but forgetting to ask for eternal youth appears in the story of [[Tithonus]]. A similar theme is found in [[Ovid]] regarding the [[Cumaean Sibyl]].

In [[Norse mythology]], [[Iðunn]] is described as providing the gods [[apple]]s that grant them eternal youthfulness in the 13th century [[Prose Edda]].

==Telomeres==
An individual's [[DNA]] plays a role in the aging process. Aging begins even before birth, as soon as cells start to die and need to be replaced. On the ends of each [[chromosome]] are repetitive sequences of DNA, [[telomeres]], that protect the chromosome from joining with other chromosomes, and have several key roles. One of these roles is to regulate cell division by allowing each cell division to remove a small amount of genetic code. The amount removed varies by the cell type being replicated. The gradual degradation of the telomeres restricts cell division to 40-60 times, also known as the [[Hayflick limit]]. Once this limit has been reached, more cells die than can be replaced in the same time span. Thus, soon after this limit is reached the organism dies. The importance of telomeres is now clearly evident: lengthen the telomeres, lengthen the life.&lt;ref name="Siegel"/&gt;

However, a study of the comparative biology of mammalian telomeres indicated that telomere length correlates inversely, rather than directly, with lifespan, and concluded that the contribution of telomere length to lifespan remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gomes NM, Ryder OA, Houck ML, Charter SJ, Walker W, Forsyth NR, Austad SN, Venditti C, Pagel M, Shay JW, Wright WE | year = 2011 | title = Comparative biology of mammalian telomeres: hypotheses on ancestral states and the roles of telomeres in longevity determination | url = | journal = Aging Cell | volume = 10 | issue = 5| pages = 761–768 | doi = 10.1111/j.1474-9726.2011.00718.x | pmid = 21518243 | pmc=3387546}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, telomere shortening does not occur with age in a some postmitotic tissues, such as in the rat brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cherif H, Tarry JL, Ozanne SE, Hales CN | year = 2003 | title = Ageing and telomeres: a study into organ- and gender-specific telomere shortening | journal = Nucleic Acids Res | volume = 31 | issue = 5| pages = 1576–1583 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkg208 | pmid = 12595567 | pmc=149817}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In humans, skeletal muscle telomere lengths remain stable from ages 23–74.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Renault V, Thornell LE, Eriksson PO, Butler-Browne G, Mouly V | year = 2003 | title = Regenerative potential of human skeletal muscle during aging | url = | journal = Aging Cell | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 132–139 | pmid = 12882343 | doi=10.1046/j.1474-9728.2002.00017.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In baboon skeletal muscle, that consists of fully differentiated post-mitotic cells, less than 3% of myonuclei contain damaged telomeres and this percentage does not increase with age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jeyapalan JC, Ferreira M, Sedivy JM, Herbig U | year = 2007 | title = Accumulation of senescent cells in mitotic tissue of aging primates | journal = Mech Ageing Dev | volume = 128 | issue = 1| pages = 36–44 | doi = 10.1016/j.mad.2006.11.008 | pmid = 17116315 | pmc=3654105}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus telomere shortening does not appear to be a major factor in the aging of the differentiated cells of brain or skeletal muscle.

Studies have shown that 90 percent of [[cancer]] cells contain large amounts of an [[enzyme]] called [[telomerase]].&lt;ref name="Damm"/&gt; Telomerase is an enzyme that replenishes the worn away telomeres by adding bases to the ends and thus renewing the telomere. A cancer cell has in essence turned on the telomerase gene, and this allows them to have an unlimited amount of divisions without the telomeres wearing away. Other kinds of cells that can surpass the Hayflick limit are [[stem cells]], [[hair follicles]], and [[germ cells]].&lt;ref name="Hornsby"/&gt; This is because they contain raised amounts of telomerase.

==Therapy==
The idea that the human body can be repaired in old age to a more youthful state has gathered significant commercial interest over the past few years, including by companies such as [[Human Longevity Inc]], [[Google Calico]], and [[Elysium Health]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In addition to these larger companies, many startups are currently developing therapeutics to tackle the 'ageing problem' using therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Esthechoc: Scientists invent 'anti-ageing' chocolate|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/esthechoc-scientists-invent-antiageing-chocolate-10060075.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Startup Alkahest inks a $50M deal for anti-aging R&amp;D|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/startup-alkahest-inks-50m-deal-anti-aging-rd/2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 a new class of drugs [[senolytics]] was announced (currently in pre-clinical development) designed specifically to combat the underlying biological causes of frailty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New "Senolytic" Drugs Can Dramatically Increase Healthy Lifespan|url=http://io9.com/new-senolytic-drugs-can-dramatically-increase-healthy-1690827868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
The "loss of youth" or ageing process is responsible for increasing the risk of individuals to many diseases including [[cancer]], [[Parkinson's]], [[Alzheimer's]], and others. As a result, in recent years, many high net worth individuals have donated large amounts of their money towards initiatives towards scientific research into the ageing process itself or therapies to slow or reverse the ageing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wallace|first1=Benjamin|title=An MIT Scientist Claims That This Pill Is the Fountain of Youth|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/08/is-elysium-healths-basis-the-fountain-of-youth.html|work=New York Magazine|date=August 23, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These people include [[Peter Thiel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Billionaire Peter Thiel embarks on anti-aging crusade|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/10/08/billionaire-peter-thiel-may-want-to-live-forever/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aubrey de Grey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=terview with Aubrey de Grey, PhD|url=http://www.lef.org/magazine/2013/7/Interview-with-Aubrey-de-Grey-PhD/Page-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Larry Ellison]], [[Sergey Brin]], [[Dmitry Itskov]], [[Paul Gallen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=These Tech Billionaires Are Determined to Buy Their Way Out of Death |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/tech-billionaires-immortality-2013-8?IR=T}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mark Zuckerberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-02-zuckerberg-brin-life.html|title=Zuckerberg, Brin join forces to extend life|date=February 20, 2013|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would allow humans to extend or maintain their youth indefinitely.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10010">'''Extremal optimization (EO)''' is an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] inspired by the [[Bak–Sneppen model]] of [[self-organized criticality]] from the field of statistical physics. This [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] was designed initially to address [[combinatorial optimization]] problems such as the [[travelling salesman problem]] and [[spin glass]]es, although the technique has been demonstrated to function in optimization domains.

== Relation to self-organized criticality ==
[[Self-organized criticality]] (SOC) is a statistical physics concept to describe a class of dynamical systems that have a critical point as an attractor. Specifically, these are non-equilibrium systems that evolve through avalanches of change and dissipations that reach up to the highest scales of the system. SOC is said to govern the dynamics behind some natural systems that have these burst-like phenomena including landscape formation, earthquakes, evolution, and the granular dynamics of rice and sand piles. Of special interest here is the [[Bak–Sneppen model]] of SOC, which is able to describe evolution via [[punctuated equilibrium]] (extinction events) – thus modelling evolution as a self-organised critical process.

== Relation to computational complexity ==
Another piece in the puzzle is work on computational complexity, specifically that critical points have been shown to exist in [[NP-complete]] problems, where near-optimum solutions are widely dispersed and separated by barriers in the search space causing local search algorithms to get stuck or severely hampered. It was the [[Bak–Sneppen model|evolutionary self-organised criticality model by Bak and Sneppen]] and the observation of critical points in combinatorial optimisation problems that lead to the development of Extremal Optimization by Stefan Boettcher and Allon Percus.

== The technique ==
EO was designed as a  [[local search (optimization)|local search]]  algorithm for [[combinatorial optimization]] problems. Unlike [[genetic algorithms]], which work with a population of candidate solutions, EO evolves a single solution and makes local modifications to the worst components. This requires that a suitable representation be selected which permits individual solution components to be assigned a quality measure ("fitness"). This differs from holistic approaches such as [[ant colony optimization]] and [[evolutionary computation]] that assign equal-fitness to all components of a solution based upon their collective evaluation against an objective function. The algorithm is initialized with an initial solution, which can be constructed randomly, or derived from another search process.

The technique is a fine-grained search, and superficially resembles a [[hill climbing]] (local search) technique. A more detailed examination reveals some interesting principles, which may have applicability and even some similarity to broader population-based approaches ([[evolutionary computation]] and [[artificial immune system]]). The governing principle behind this algorithm is that of improvement through selectively removing low-quality components and replacing them with a randomly selected component. This is obviously at odds with [[genetic algorithms]], the quintessential evolutionary computation algorithm that selects good solutions in an attempt to make better solutions.

The resulting dynamics of this simple principle is firstly a robust hill climbing search behaviour, and secondly a diversity mechanism that resembles that of multiple-restart search. Graphing holistic solution quality over time (algorithm iterations) shows periods of improvement followed by quality crashes (avalanche) very much in the manner as described by [[punctuated equilibrium]]. It is these crashes or dramatic jumps in the search space that permit the algorithm to escape local optima and differentiate this approach from other local search procedures. Although such punctuated-equilibrium behaviour can be "designed" or "hard-coded", it should be stressed that this is an ''emergent'' effect of the negative-component-selection principle fundamental to the algorithm.

EO has primarily been applied to combinatorial problems such as [[graph partitioning]] and the [[travelling salesman problem]], as well as problems from statistical physics such as [[spin glass]]es.

== Variations on the theme and applications ==
Generalised extremal optimization (GEO) was developed to operate on bit strings where component quality is determined by the absolute rate of change of the bit, or the bits contribution to holistic solution quality. This work includes application to standard function optimisation problems as well as engineering problem domains. Another similar extension to EO is Continuous Extremal Optimization (CEO).

EO has been applied to image rasterization as well as used as a local search after using [[ant colony optimization]]. EO has been used to identify structures in complex networks. EO has been used on a multiple target tracking problem. Finally, some work has been done on investigating the probability distribution used to control selection.

In some forms of  [[Christian eschatology]], the '''intermediate state''' or '''interim state''' refers to a person's "intermediate" existence between one's death and the [[universal resurrection]]. In addition, there are beliefs in a [[Particular judgment]] right after death and a [[General judgement]] or [[Last judgment]] after the resurrection.

Christians looked for an imminent [[Christian eschatology|end of the world]] and many of them had little interest in an interim state between death and resurrection. The [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Church]] admits of such an intermediate state, but refrained from defining it, so as not to blur the distinction between the alternative definitive fates of [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]] and [[Christian views on hell|Hell]]. The [[Western Christianity|Western Church]] goes differently by defining the intermediate state, with evidence from as far back as the ''Passion'' of Saints [[Perpetua and Felicity]] (203) of the belief that sins can be purged by suffering in an [[afterlife]], and that the [[Purgatory|purgation]] can be expedited by the intercession of the living. Eastern Christians also believed that the [[Prayer for the dead|dead can be assisted by prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article ''purgatory''&lt;/ref&gt;

East and West, those in the intermediate state have traditionally been the beneficiaries of prayers, such as [[requiem masses]]. In the East, the saved are said to rest in light while the wicked are confined in darkness. In the East, prayers are said to benefit those in ''[[Christian_views_on_Hades#Eastern_Orthodox|Hades]]'', even [[paganism|pagans]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Dead, prayer for the." Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In the West, [[Augustine]] described prayer as useful for those in communion with the church, and implied that every [[Soul#Christianity|soul's]] ultimate fate is determined at death.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In the West, such prayer came to be restricted to souls in ''[[Purgatory]]'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; which the idea has "ancient roots" and is demonstrated in early Church writings.&lt;ref name="Zaleski"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9061946/purgatory |author=Carol Zaleski |title=Purgatory |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman Catholic Church]] offers [[indulgences]] for those in purgatory, which evolved out of the earlier practice of canonical remissions.&lt;ref name="Indulgences"&gt;"Indulgences."

We do not prohibit this, but we do reject the transfer, ''ex opere operato'', of the Lord's Supper to the dead" (Kolb and Wengert, pp. 275-76). Such prayers can be found in past Lutheran practice. Evidence exists that such prayers were offered up in some Lutheran orders of the sixteenth century. Philip Pfatteicher's commentary on ''LBW'' explained that the dead have not left the body of Christ by dying but remain members of the body (pp.475-82).}}&lt;/ref&gt; other [[Nonconformist]] Protestants largely ceased praying for the dead.

In general, Protestants denied the Catholic purgatory. [[Martin Luther|Luther]] taught [[soul sleep|mortality of the soul]], comparing the sleep of a tired man after a day's work whose soul "sleeps not but is awake" ("''non sic dormit, sed vigilat''") and can "experience visions and the discourses of the angels and of God", with the sleep of the dead which experience nothing but still "live to God" ("''coram Deo vivit''").&lt;ref&gt;Differunt tamen somnus sive quies hujus vitae et futurae. Homon enim in hac vita defatigatus diurno labore, sub noctem intrat in cubiculum suum tanquam in pace, ut ibi dormiat, et ea nocte fruitur quiete, neque quicquam scit de ullo malo sive incendii, sive caedis. Anima autem non sic dormit, sed vigilat, et patitur visiones loquelas Angelorum et Dei. Ideo somnus in futura vita profundior est quam in hac vita et tamen anima coram Deo vivit. Hac similitudine, quam habeo a somno viventia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J Fritschel : Denn dass Luther mit den Worten "anima non sic dormit, sed vigilat et patitur visiones, loquelas Angelorum et Dei" nicht dasjenige leugnen will, was er an allen andern Stellen seiner Schriften vortragt.." Luther und offene Fragen;", Zeitschrift für die gesammte lutherische Theologie und Kirche 1867 p657&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Salomon judgeth that the dead are a sleepe, and feele nothing at all. For the dead lye there accompting neyther dayes nor yeares, but when they are awoken, they shall seeme to haue slept scarce one minute." - Martin Luther, ''An Exposition of Salomon's Booke, called Ecclesiastes or the Preacher'' (translation 1573). "It is certain that to this day Abraham is serving God, just as Abel, Noah are serving God. And this we should carefully note; for it is divine truth that Abraham is living, serving God, and ruling with Him. But what sort of life that may be, whether he is asleep or awake, is another question. How the soul is resting we are not to know, but it is certain that it is living." - E.M. Plass, ''What Luther Says'', Vol. 1. St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1950. p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"But the soul does not sleep in the same manner  It is awake. It experiences visions and the discourses of the angels and of God. Therefore the sleep in the future life is deeper than it is in this life. Nevertheless, the soul lives before God." - J Pelikan, ed., ''Luther's Works'', Vol. 4. St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1964. p. 313 (cf. misquoted "(like a person on earth.)" and misread in [http://www.wlsessays.net/node/1664 Harold A.

==Jewish background==
{{Main|Jewish eschatology}}
The early Hebrews had no notion of [[resurrection of the dead]]&lt;ref&gt;Belief in the resurrection "first became prevalent in Judaism during the time of the [[Maccabees]], after 168 BCE." [[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; and thus no intermediate state. As with neighboring groups, they understood death to be the end. Their afterlife, ''[[sheol]]'' (the pit), was a dark place from which none return. By Jesus' time, however, the [[Book of Daniel]] ({{bibleverse||Daniel|12:1-4|ESV}}) and a prophecy in [[Isaiah]] (26:19)&lt;ref name ="Harris"&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; had made popular the idea that the dead in ''sheol'' would be [[Last judgment|raised for a last judgment]]. The [[intertestamental period|intertestamental literature]] describes in more detail what the dead experience in ''sheol''. According to the [[Book of Enoch]], the righteous and wicked await the resurrection in separate divisions of [[sheol]], a teaching which may have influenced Jesus' parable of [[Lazarus and Dives]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Bible Dictionary'' 3rd edition, IVP Leicester 1996. "Sheol".&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Citations missing|date=July 2008}}
{{See also|History of purgatory}}
In the [[Septuagint]] and [[New Testament]] the authors used the Greek term [[Hades]] for the Hebrew [[Sheol]], but often with Jewish rather than Greek concepts in mind, so that, for example, there is no activity in Hades in Ecclesiastes.&lt;ref&gt;Ecclesiastes 9:10 πάντα ὅσα ἂν εὕρῃ ἡ χείρ σου τοῦ ποιῆσαι ὡς ἡ δύναμίς σου ποίησον ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ποίημα καὶ λογισμὸς καὶ γνῶσις καὶ σοφία ἐν ᾅδῃ ὅπου σὺ πορεύῃ ἐκεῖ &lt;/ref&gt; An exception to traditional Jewish views of Sheol, Hades is found in the Gospel of Luke [[parable of the Rich man and Lazarus]] which describes Hades along the lines of [[intertestamental]] Jewish understanding of a Sheol divided between the happy righteous and the miserable wicked.&lt;ref&gt;George W. E. Nickelsburg ''Resurrection, immortality, and eternal life in intertestamental Judaism and Early Christianity'' Harvard Theological Studies&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Hippolytus of Rome]] expanded on this parable and described activity in the [[Bosom of Abraham]] in ''Against Plato''.&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus of Rome, Against Plato, on the Cause of the Universe, §1. As to the state of the righteous, he writes, "And there the righteous from the beginning dwell, not ruled by necessity, but enjoying always the contemplation of the blessings which are in their view, and delighting themselves with the expectation of others ever new, and deeming those ever better than these. And that place brings no toils to them. There, there is neither fierce heat, nor cold, nor thorn; but the face of the fathers and the righteous is seen to be always smiling, as they wait for the rest and eternal revival in heaven which succeed this location. And we call it by the name Abraham's bosom." &lt;/ref&gt; 

Since [[Augustine]], Christians have believed that the souls of those who die either rest peacefully, in the case of Christians, or are afflicted, in the case of the damned, after death until the [[resurrection]].&lt;ref name="Hoekema"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoekema|first=Anthony A|title=The Bible and the Future|year=1994|location=Grand Rapids|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine distinguishes between the purifying fire that saves and eternal consuming fire for the unrepentant,&lt;ref name="Zaleski"/&gt; and speaks of the pain that purgatorial fire causes as more severe than anything a man can suffer in this life.&lt;ref&gt;"gravior erit ignis quam quidquid potest homo pati in hac vita" (P. L., col. 397), quoted in [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12575a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Purgatory].&lt;/ref&gt; The Venerable Bede and Saint Boniface both report visions of an afterlife with a four-way division, including pleasant and punishing abodes near heaven and hell to hold souls until judgment day.

The idea of Purgatory as a physical place was "born" in the late [[Christianity in the 11th century|11th century]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Le Goff, The Birth of Purgatory (University of Chicago Press, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval Catholic theologians concluded that the purgatorial punishments consisted of material fire. The Catholic Church believes that the living can help those whose purification from their sins is not yet completed not only by praying for them but also by gaining [[indulgence]]s for them&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4G.HTM CCC, 1479]&lt;/ref&gt; as an act of [[Intercession of saints|intercession]].&lt;ref name="Indulgences"/&gt; [[All Souls' Day]] commemorates the souls in purgatory. The Late Middle Ages saw the growth of considerable abuses, such as the unrestricted sale of indulgences by professional "pardoners" to release the donors' departed loved ones from suffering in purgatory, or the donors themselves.&lt;ref&gt;F. Donald Logan, ''A History of the Church in the Middle Ages'' (Routledge, 2012), 275.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Indulgences"/&gt;

In the 16th century, [[Protestant Reformers]] such as [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] challenged the doctrine of purgatory because it was not supported in the Bible. Both Calvin and Luther continued to believe in an intermediate state, but Calvin held to a more conscious existence for the souls of the dead than Luther did. For Calvin, believers in the intermediate state enjoyed a blessedness that was incomplete, in anticipation of the resurrection. [[Reformed theology]] largely followed Calvin's teaching on the intermediate state.&lt;ref name="Hoekema" /&gt;

==Christian teaching==
===Foretaste of final state===
{{See also|Particular judgment}}
Some theological traditions, including most Protestants{{fact|date=October 2016}}, [[Anabaptists]] and Eastern Orthodox, teach that the intermediate state is a disembodied foretaste of the final state. Therefore, those who die in [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] go into the presence of God (or the [[bosom of Abraham]]) where they experience joy and rest while they await their [[general resurrection|resurrection]] (cf. {{bibleverse||Luke|23:43|NIV}}). Those who die unrepentant will experience torment (perhaps in [[Christian views on hell|hell]]) while they await final condemnation on the [[last judgment|day of judgment]] ({{bibleverse|2|Peter|2:9|NIV}}).

{{quotation|I. The bodies of men, after death, return to dust, and see corruption: but their souls, which neither die nor sleep, having an immortal subsistence, immediately return to God who gave them: the souls of the righteous, being then made perfect in holiness, are received into the highest heavens, where they behold the face of God, in light and glory, waiting for the full redemption of their bodies. And the souls of the wicked are cast into hell, where they remain in torments and utter darkness, reserved to the judgment of the great day.[4] Beside these two places, for souls separated from their bodies, the Scripture acknowledges none.|[[Westminster Confession]] 1646, chapter XXXII, Of the State of Men after Death, and of the Resurrection of the Dead}}

A minority of Christians, including [[William Tyndale]], [[Martin Luther]]&lt;ref name="Luther"&gt;"Christian Song Latin and German, for Use at Funerals", 1542, in Works of Luther (1932), vol. 6,  pp. 287, 288&lt;/ref&gt; some [[Anglicans]] such as [[E.

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] also believe this with the exception of the [[Jehovah's_Witnesses_and_salvation#The_.27anointed.27|144,000]].&lt;ref&gt;''From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained'' Watchtower Society 1st Ed. 1958. "After Jesus died and was resurrected men and women could be set aside to become the `little flock' of 144,000 persons who make up the heavenly, spiritual nation of God, and who are to rule with Christ in the new heavens." "Their resurrection is also a `resurrection of life' because they `did good things' on earth. However, the resurrection of the 144,000 members of the spiritual nation is a resurrection to spirit life in the heavens." "Has this spiritual resurrection taken place? Yes, back in chapter 26 we learned that it took place when Christ came to Jehovah's temple in 1918" (p. 231). "Those of this spiritual nation who died before the spiritual resurrection began in 1918 slept in death until that year. But the others who were still alive on earth have continued to live out their regular lives." "And now when the earthly life of one of such persons ends he is resurrected at once to spirit life. He is changed in a moment from being a human creature to being a spirit creature in heaven with Jesus Christ." "But only 144,000 persons will be a part of the new heavens with Jesus Christ" (Ibid, p. 232).&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the person is not conscious of any time or activity and would not be aware even if centuries elapsed between their death and their resurrection.  They would, upon their death, cease consciousness, and gain it again at the time of the resurrection having experienced no time lapse. For them, time would thus be suspended, as if they moved immediately from death to resurrection and the [[General Judgment]] of the [[Judgment Day]].

=== Hades ===
{{Main|Christian views on Hades}}
The intermediate state is sometimes referred to by the [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''[[Greek underworld|hades]]'', even in other languages. The term is equivalent to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''[[sheol]]'' and [[Latin]] ''infernum'' (meaning "underworld").

In other words, the death which consists in the separation of soul and body, and the receptacle of disembodied spirits shall be no more. ''Hades'' shall be emptied, death abolished.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purgatory===
{{Main|Purgatory}}
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] teaches that all who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, undergo ''purification'' so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven, a final purification to which it gives the name "[[purgatory]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p123a12.htm#III Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1030-1031]&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Catholic theologians had given the name "[[limbo#Limbo of Infants|limbo]]" to a theory on the possible fate of infants who die without baptism.

==Similar concepts in non-Christian religions==
===Islam===
In [[Islamic eschatology]], [[Barzakh]] ({{lang-ar|برزخ}}) is the intermediate state in which the [[soul]] of the deceased is transferred across the boundaries of the mortal realm into a kind of "cold sleep" where the soul will rest until the ''[[Qiyamah]]'' or End Time ([[Last Judgment|Judgement Day]]). The term appears in the [[Qur'an]] [[Al-Muminun|Surah 23, Ayat 100]].

Barzakh is a sequence that happens after death, in which the soul will separate from the body. Three events make up ''barzakh'':{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}
*The separation of the soul and the body, in which the soul separates and hovers over the body.
*Self-review of one's actions and deeds in one's life.
*The soul rests in an interspace in which one will experience a manifestation of one's soul resulting in a cold sleep state, awaiting the Day of Judgement.

In [[Islam]] all human beings go through five steps of age:
*''The age in the world of souls'' is where a human soul has been created and the soul waits until being imbued into a chosen fetus by an Angel.
*''The age in the womb'' is where the body acquires its soul.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The fetus is imbued with a soul from God. The soul however, is completely innocent and totally lacking of any worldly knowledge, which is reflected by a baby's helplessness.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}
*''The age in the mortal world'' is the stage of life from the moment of birth from the womb to the moment of death.
*''The age of the grave'' is the stage after death in the mortal world, where the soul is stored in Barzakh (midst) which results in a cold sleep state, awaiting the Day of Judgement.
*''The age of the hereafter or rest of eternity'' is the final stage commencing after the Day of Judgement and all of humanity has received their judgement from God. If they were righteous and did good deeds based on their own circumstances, regardless of professed religion, they go to [[Jannah]] (heaven) and if they have attained little in life, and were unrighteous in their actions—or were despite all evidence shown to them, bent on denying the truth of life once it was presented to them based on their own circumstances they shall go to [[Jahannam]] (a spiritual state of suffering). This stage of life commences officially after the embodiment of Death is brought up and is slain, thus Death dies literally, and no one will ever experience or behold the concept of Death everafter. Based on the verdict received which is brought upon by each person's individual deeds, actions, and circumstances in life, the Day of Judgement on which everyone is judged with the utmost sense of justice, each human will spend this stage of life in heaven or hell (which will be a place for purification of the soul so that one realizes the wrongs committed in life). However, those in hell are eligible to go to the state of heaven after being purified by that state described as hell if they "had an atom's worth of faith in them"{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} and the soul is repentful.

===Indigenous Indonesian beliefs===
According to the native Indonesian beliefs, the soul of a dead person will stay on the [[earth]] for 40 days after the death. When the ties aren't released after 40 days, the body is said to jump out from the grave to warn people that the soul need the bonds to be released. Because of the tie under the feet, the ghost can't walk. This causes the ''[[pocong]]'' to hop. After the ties are released, the soul will leave the earth and never show up anymore.

===Buddhism===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
[[Tibetan Buddhism]] has the concept of ''[[bardo]]'', a state of existence intermediate between two lives on earth, usually within 49 days. [[Theravada Buddhism]] does not have this belief.

===Taoism===
In Taoism a newly deceased person may return ([[:zh-yue:回魂|回魂]]) to his home at some nights, sometimes one week ([[:zh:頭七|頭七]]) after his death&lt;ref&gt;[http://hk.myblog.yahoo.com/keikolee28/article?mid=44&amp;fid=-1&amp;action=next 拜回魂儀式及注意事項]&lt;/ref&gt; and the seven ''[[Hun and po|po]]'' souls would disappear one by one every 7 days after death.

[[File:RoyLindmanAbuhav1.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Abuhav synagogue]] in [[Safed]], said to be designed by Aboab]]
'''Isaac Aboab''' (fl. end of the 14th century) was a [[Jew]]ish [[Talmud]]ic scholar. He was also known by the [[pen name]] ''Menorat ha-Maor'' or ''Menoras HaMaor'', a work which he authored. He lived in [[Spain]] during the 14th century. As shown by [[Zunz]] ("Ritus," pp.&amp;nbsp;204–210), he is not to be confused with [[Isaac Aboab of Castile|Isaac Aboab]], rabbi of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], the supercommentator of [[Naḥmanides]], who died in 1493.

He was a man of affairs, who, towards the end of his life, devoted much time to literary work and to preaching, as he found that great Talmudic scholars and important seats of learning were rare. In his time, the Jews for whom he wrote still understood and spoke [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. He belonged to a period of intellectual decline when men took naturally to eclecticism. He combined extensive rabbinical knowledge with philosophical erudition, and was fond of mystic interpretation of the Mosaic laws and ceremonies. He quoted [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]], though only from secondary sources, and endeavored to illustrate passages from the Talmud and the [[midrash]]ic literature, with which he was especially familiar, by utterances taken from the philosophical, the ethical, and the mystic literature of his time. His chief aim was the popularization of knowledge and the elevation of the masses.

Aboab wrote three books:
#The first, on Jewish rites, under the title of ''Aron ha-'Edut'' ("The Ark of the Testimony"), was divided, after the manner of the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]], into ten sections, each again subdivided into chapters and paragraphs. The various ritual laws were therein traced to their Talmudic sources, and the decisions of the [[Geonim]] and later interpretations added.
#His second book, on the prayers and benedictions, was called ''Shulḥan ha-Panim'' ("Table of the Showbread"), and was divided into twelve sections, symbolizing the twelve loaves of the [[showbread]] in the [[Tabernacle]]; both works unfortunately are lost.
#His third book has survived, and has won considerable fame for the author, though in his humility he assures his readers that he composed it chiefly for his own use as a public speaker. But besides this it has contributed probably more than any other medieval book to the popularization of rabbinical lore and to the religious edification and elevation of the masses. It belongs to that class of ethical works which sprang up in the 13th century in a time of reaction against the one-sided manner in which Talmudic studies had been previously pursued.

"These Talmudists," he says in the preface, "consider it their duty to propose difficult questions and answer them in a witty and subtle manner, but leave unnoticed the precious pearls that lie upon the bed of the Talmudic ocean, the haggadic passages (similar to Midrash) so rich in beauty and sweetness." He conceived, therefore, the plan of grouping together the rich material stored up in the vast treasure-house of the Haggadah - (see [[Aggadah]]) from the religious and ethical point of view, and of presenting it in a book which he called ''Menorat ha-Maor'' ("The Candlestick of Light"; compare [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 4:9 also translated as "The [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]] Lamp") [http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=4]), intending by it to illumine the minds and the hearts of his coreligionists. With reference to the seven-armed candlestick (''Menorah'') in the [[Tabernacle]] (as described in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 25:31 [http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=25]; and [[Book of Numbers|Numbers 8:2]] [http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=8]), he divided the book into seven sections, each of which bears the title of ''Ner'' or "Lamp" subdivided into separate parts and chapters. It can hardly be said that the division of the matter treated is very logical and systematic, nor indeed does the work lay any claim to originality; but in presenting the beautiful moral and religious truths of [[Judaism]] in homely form, Aboab supplied to the average reader a great need of the time. Its skillful arrangement of the various [[Tanakh|Biblical]] and rabbinical topics and its warm tone of deep earnestness and sincerity could not fail to appeal to the popular heart. And as in the course of time the sermon, then still in use among the Spanish Jews, ceased to be a part of the divine service because the preacher had to give way to the [[Hazzan]], or precentor, the ''Menorat ha-Maor'' became a substitute for the living voice of the preacher. It was translated into Spanish and read to attentive assemblies of the people, particularly to those not versed in the Law. It thus became the household book of the medieval Jews. It was published with a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] translation (Leghorn, 1657), with a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] commentary and a [[Yiddish|Judæo-German]] translation by [[Moses Frankfurter]] (Amsterdam, 1701), with a modern [[German language|German]] translation by [[Jacob Raphael Fürstenthal]] and [[Benzion Behrend]] (Krotoschin, 1844–46). It was translated also into modern [[Yiddish]], in [[Vilnius|Wilna]], 1880. The book should not be confused with a work of the same name by [[Israel Alnaqua]].

'''Kunigunde of Sternberg''' ({{lang-cs|Kunhuta ze Šternberka}}; 18 November 1425, [[Konopiště]] – 19 November 1449, [[Poděbrady]]) was the first wife of [[George of Poděbrady]], who later became King of Bohemia.

== Life ==
Kunigunde's parents were the Bohemian nobles Smil of Sternberg (d. 1431) and Barbara of Pardubice (d. 1433). In 1441 she married then 21-year-old George of Poděbrady, who had been captain of the old Bohemian circle of [[Brandýs nad Labem-Stará Boleslav|Stará Boleslav]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie|8|602|610|George of Poděbrady | Adolf Bachmann| ADB:Georg von Podïebrad}}&lt;/ref&gt; since 1440. This marriage produced three sons:
* [[Boček IV of Poděbrady|Boček]] (1442–1496)
* [[Victor of Poděbrady|Victor]] (1443–1500) and
* [[Henry I, Duke of Münsterberg-Oels|Henry the Elder]] (1448–1498)

and three daughters:
* Barbara (1446–1474), married first with Henry of Lipé (''Jindřich z Lipé'', d. 1469), and second with Jan Křinecký of Ronov
* [[Catherine of Podebrady|Catherine]] (1449–1464) and
* [[Sidonie of Poděbrady|Zdenka]] (1449–1510) (also known as Sidonie of Poděbrady)

In 1444 Kunigunde founded a hospital in Poděbrady. It was named after her and remained in operation until the beginning of the 20th century. She also established a foundation for youth education, school construction and rehabilitation of prisoners.

She died in 1449, the day after her twenty-fourth birthday and several days after giving birth to twin daughters. She was buried in the parish church ''Exaltation of the Holy Cross'' in Poděbrady.

'''Lillian Leitzel''' (January 2, 1892, [[Breslau]], [[Germany]] (present-day [[Wrocław, Poland]]) &amp;ndash; February 15, 1931, [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]) was an [[acrobatics|acrobat]] and [[strongwoman]] for the [[Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus]].  The inaugural (posthumous) inductee to the [[International Circus Hall of Fame]], Leitzel died in hospital two days after a fall during a live performance.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Early life==
Leitzel was born as '''Leopoldina Alitza Pelikan''' in a family of circus performers. Her father was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] army officer and theater performer. Her mother was a Czech circus acrobat. She spent her childhood in Germany where she lived with her maternal grandparents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trivia-library.com/b/biography-of-queen-of-the-circus-lillian-leitzel-part-1.htm|title=Trivia on Biography of Queen of the Circus Lillian Leitzel Part 1|work=trivia-library.com|accessdate=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she had been well-educated and had prepared to pursue a career as a concert pianist, she joined her mother's aerobatic circus group, the Leamy Ladies.

In 1910, she came to the [[United States]] with the circus troupe and performed with [[Barnum and Bailey]]. The group later dissolved and its members returned to Europe, but Leitzel continued to attempt to perform in the American [[vaudeville]] circuit. In [[South Bend, Indiana]], she was seen by an agent of the Ringling Brothers who offered her a contract. When Ringling and Barnum and Bailey merged, she became a huge star and a headline performer for the circus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Masek|first=Mark|title=Grave Spotlight - Lillian Leitzel|url=http://cemeteryguide.com/gotw-leitzel-codona.html|work=www.cemeteryguide.com|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Act and personality==
[[File:Bill Stieneke &amp; Lillian Leitzel, 5-15-25 LCCN2016839880.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Leitzel performing in 1925]]
Leitzel's act included one-armed planges, momentarily dislocating the shoulder during each plange. She would flip her body over her shoulder repeatedly, sometimes hundreds of times in a feat of endurance, encouraging the audience to count each one in unison. Only four feet, nine inches, she was also famous for her demanding personality and temper. Leitzel was the first performer in history to command her own private [[Pullman car]] completely furnished with her own baby grand piano.&lt;ref&gt;Eckley, Wilton. ''The American Circus''. Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1984.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Her quick temper was legendary. It was not uncommon to witness Leitzel cursing or slapping a roustabout who did not adjust her rigging exactly to her liking. Further, Leitzel was known to fly off the handle and fire and rehire her personal maid, Mabel Cummings, several times a day. In sharp contrast, she was known to the children on the show as "Auntie Leitzel", and who would hold birthday parties for her fellow performers in her private dressing tent.&lt;ref&gt;Willson, Dixie. "Under the Big Top", ''Good Housekeeping'', June–October 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriages==
She married Clyde Ingalls in 1920 (the couple divorced in 1924), and later wed circus [[trapeze]] performer [[Alfredo Codona]] in 1928.

==Accident and death==
On February 13, 1931, she fell to the ground from her rigging while performing in [[Copenhagen|Copenhagen, Denmark]] at the Valencia Theatre, when the swivel that held the rope in place fractured and snapped. She and Codona had been performing in Europe separately, and he rushed to Copenhagen. After she apparently showed signs of improvement, Codona returned to his company in Berlin. However, she died on February 15, two days after the fall, aged 39.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Circus Fall Fatal To Lillian Leitzel.

==Honors==
Lillian Leitzel was the first inductee elected into the [[International Circus Hall of Fame]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://circushof.com/halloffame.html|title=International Circus Hall of Fame|accessdate=2008-08-04|quote=|publisher=International Circus Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A vintage circus poster depicting her was used as the subject of a [[United States]] [[postage stamp]] issued as part of a set on May 5, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://postalnews.com/postalnewsblog/2014/05/05/usps-issues-vintage-circus-posters-forever-stamps/ |title=USPS Issues Vintage Circus Posters Forever Stamps |last=Sheehan |first=Brian |work=[[PRNewswire]]| publisher=Postal News Blog |date=2014-05-05 |accessdate=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In media==
The book ''Queen of the Air: A True Story of Love and Tragedy at the Circus'' by Dean N. Jensen, is about Lillian Leitzel. It was published by Crown in 2013 ({{ISBN|030798656X}}/{{ISBN|978-0307986566}}).

[[File:Wickiana5.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Three people lie on a large fire, watched by several men.|Artistic depiction of the execution by burning of three alleged witches in [[Baden, Switzerland]] in 1585]] This is a '''list of people executed for witchcraft''', many of whom were executed during organised [[witch-hunt]]s, particularly from the 15th–18th centuries. Large numbers of people were prosecuted for witchcraft in Europe between 1560 and 1630.&lt;ref name=Levack204&gt;Levack, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Until around 1440 witchcraft-related prosecutions in Europe centred on ''[[Maleficium (sorcery)|maleficium]]'', the concept of using supernatural powers specifically to harm others. Cases came about from accusations of the use of ritual magic to damage rivals.&lt;ref name=Levack204/&gt; Up until the early 15th century, there was little association of witchcraft with [[Satan]].&lt;ref name=Levack205&gt;Levack, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; From that time organised witch-hunts increased, as did individual accusations of sorcery. The nature of the charges brought changed as more cases were linked to [[diabolism]]. Throughout the century, a number of treatises were published that helped to establish a stereotype of the witch, particularly the Satanic connection. During the 16th century, witchcraft prosecutions stabilised and even declined in some areas.&lt;ref name=Levack205/&gt; Witch-hunts increased again in the 17th century. The [[witch trials in Early Modern Europe]] included the [[Basque witch trials]] in Spain, the [[Fulda witch trials]] in Germany, the [[North Berwick witch trials]] in Scotland and the [[Torsåker witch trials]] in Sweden.

Witch-hunts also took place during the 17th century in the American colonies. These were particularly common in the colonies of [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] and [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]]. The myth of the witch had a strong cultural presence in 17th century [[New England]] and, as in Europe, witchcraft was strongly associated with devil-worship.&lt;ref name=Hall4&gt;Hall, P. 4&lt;/ref&gt; About eighty people were accused of practicing witchcraft in a witch-hunt that lasted throughout New England from 1647 to 1663. Thirteen women and two men were executed.&lt;ref name=Fradin&gt;Fradin, Judith Bloom, Dennis Brindell Fradin. ''The Salem Witch Trials''. Marshall Cavendish. 2008, pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Salem witch trials]] followed in 1692–93, culminating in the executions of 20 people. 5 others died in jail.

It has been estimated that tens of thousands of people were executed for witchcraft in Europe and the American colonies over several hundred years. Although it is not possible to ascertain the exact number, modern scholars estimate around 40,000–50,000.{{Cref2|A}} Common methods of execution for convicted witches were [[hanging]], [[drowning]] and [[Death by burning|burning]]. Burning was often favoured, particularly in Europe, as it was considered a more painful way to die.&lt;ref name="Stack, p. 20"&gt;Stack, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors in the American colonies generally preferred hanging in cases of witchcraft.&lt;ref name="Stack, p. 20"/&gt;

'''Louis de la Corne''' or '''Louis Chapt, Chevalier de la Corne''' (June 6, 1703 – November 15, 1761) was born at [[Fort Frontenac]] in what is now [[Kingston, Ontario]], Canada, and began his career in the colonial regular troops as a second ensign in 1722 and was made full ensign five years later.

He married in 1728 and began investing heavily in the commerce of the fur trade while continuing his military career. This was a common practice of the time. In the next few years both careers flourished. He received promotions to lieutenant and then captain six years later.

During [[King George's War]], he had serious combat experience in [[Acadia]] for which he was awarded the [[Order of Saint Louis|cross of Saint Louis]] in May 1749 for his actions at the [[Battle of Grand Pre]]. During [[Father Le Loutre's War]] he was involved in other hostile military operations as well as organizing militias amongst new settlers in new territories (see [[Battle at Chignecto]]).

In 1752, La Corne began a three-year appointment as the western commander of the ''poste de l’Ouest'', (the French name for the posts started by  [[Pierre Gaultier de Varennes et de La Vérendrye]]).

He succeeded [[Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre]] and set out in June 1753 with 57 men, leaving his brother [[Luc de la Corne]] to coordinate additional resources. He crossed paths with Saint-Pierre north of Lake Superior and was briefed on what he would find in the west. During his tenure in the west, La Corne appears to have been an active commander. He improved [[Fort Paskoya]] (Le Pas, Man.), built Fort Saint-Louis ([[Fort de la Corne]], [[Saskatchewan]]) and explored the [[Carrot River]] valley. He was succeeded by [[Louis-Joseph Gaultier de La Vérendrye]] who was Commander of the West from 1756 to 1758. (Because of the [[Seven Years' War]],  La Vérendrye never actually came west but carried out the business through agents.)
[[File:Order of Saint Louis IMG 2674.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Order of Saint Louis|Cross of Saint Louis]] for La Corne's victory in the [[Battle of Grand Pre]]]]
By July 1755, La Corne was back east and was heavily involved in military matters for the next five years, patrolling the Montreal to Lake Ontario waterway with a large contingent of men. More military recognition for his role was recommended but never occurred. He was to be deported to France in 1761 and was one of the victims when the ship, ''[[Auguste (ship)|Auguste]]'' sank off the coast of [[Cape Breton Island]] on November 15 of that year.

{{machine learning bar}}
A '''multilayer perceptron''' (MLP) is a class of [[feedforward neural network|feedforward]] [[artificial neural network]]. An MLP consists of, at least, three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. Except for the input nodes, each node is a neuron that uses a nonlinear [[activation function]]. MLP utilizes a [[supervised learning]] technique called [[backpropagation]] for training.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblatt, Frank. x. Principles of Neurodynamics: Perceptrons and the Theory of Brain Mechanisms. Spartan Books, Washington DC, 1961&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rumelhart, David E., Geoffrey E. Hinton, and R. J. Williams. "Learning Internal Representations by Error Propagation". David E. Rumelhart, James L. McClelland, and the PDP research group. (editors), Parallel distributed processing: Explorations in the microstructure of cognition, Volume 1: Foundation. MIT Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Its multiple layers and non-linear activation distinguish MLP from a linear [[perceptron]]. It can distinguish data that is not [[Linear separability|linearly separable]].&lt;ref name="Cybenko1989"&gt;Cybenko, G. 1989. Approximation by superpositions of a sigmoidal function ''[[Mathematics of Control, Signals, and Systems]]'', 2(4), 303–314.&lt;/ref&gt;

Multilayer perceptrons are sometimes colloquially referred to as "vanilla" neural networks, especially when they have a single hidden layer.&lt;ref&gt;Hastie, Trevor. Tibshirani, Robert. Friedman, Jerome. The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction. Springer, New York, NY, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
&lt;section begin=theory /&gt;
=== Activation function ===
If a multilayer perceptron has a linear [[activation function]] in all neurons, that is, a linear function that maps the [[synaptic weight|weighted inputs]] to the output of each neuron, then [[linear algebra]] shows that any number of layers can be reduced to a two-layer input-output model. In MLPs some neurons use a ''nonlinear'' activation function that was developed to model the frequency of [[action potentials]], or firing, of biological neurons.

The two common activation functions are both [[sigmoids]], and are described by

:&lt;math&gt;y(v_i) = \tanh(v_i) ~~ \textrm{and} ~~ y(v_i) = (1+e^{-v_i})^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

The first is a [[hyperbolic tangent]] that ranges from -1 to 1, while the other is the [[logistic function]], which is similar in shape but ranges from 0 to 1. Here &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; is the output of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th node (neuron) and &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; is the weighted sum of the input connections. Alternative activation functions have been proposed, including the [[Rectifier (neural networks)|rectifier and softplus]] functions. More specialized activation functions include [[radial basis functions]] (used in [[Radial basis network|radial basis networks,]] another class of supervised neural network models).

=== Layers ===

The MLP consists of three or more layers (an input and an output layer with one or more ''hidden layers'') of nonlinearly-activating nodes. Since MLPs are fully connected, each node in one layer connects with a certain weight &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; to every node in the following layer.

=== Learning  ===
Learning occurs in the perceptron by changing connection weights after each piece of data is processed, based on the amount of error in the output compared to the expected result. This is an example of [[supervised learning]], and is carried out through [[backpropagation]], a generalization of the [[Least mean squares filter|least mean squares algorithm]] in the linear perceptron.

We represent the error in output node &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th data point (training example) by &lt;math&gt;e_j(n)=d_j(n)-y_j(n)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the target value and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the value produced by the perceptron. The node weights are adjusted based on corrections that minimize the error in the entire output, given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}(n)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_j e_j^2(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

Using [[gradient descent]], the change in each weight is

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta w_{ji} (n) = -\eta\frac{\partial\mathcal{E}(n)}{\partial v_j(n)} y_i(n)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; is the output of the previous neuron and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is the ''learning rate'', which is selected to ensure that the weights quickly converge to a response, without oscillations.

The derivative to be calculated depends on the induced local field &lt;math&gt;v_j&lt;/math&gt;, which itself varies. It is easy to prove that for an output node this derivative can be simplified to

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\partial\mathcal{E}(n)}{\partial v_j(n)} = e_j(n)\phi^\prime (v_j(n))&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\phi^\prime&lt;/math&gt; is the derivative of the activation function described above, which itself does not vary. The analysis is more difficult for the change in weights to a hidden node, but it can be shown that the relevant derivative is

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{\partial\mathcal{E}(n)}{\partial v_j(n)} = \phi^\prime (v_j(n))\sum_k -\frac{\partial\mathcal{E}(n)}{\partial v_k(n)} w_{kj}(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

This depends on the change in weights of the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;th nodes, which represent the output layer. So to change the hidden layer weights, the output layer weights change according to the derivative of the activation function, and so this algorithm represents a backpropagation of the activation function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haykin |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Haykin |title=Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation |edition=2 |year=1998 |publisher=Prentice Hall |location= |isbn=0-13-273350-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;section end=theory /&gt;

== Terminology ==

The term "multilayer perceptron" does not refer to a single perceptron that has multiple layers. Rather, it contains many perceptrons that are organized into layers. An alternative is "multilayer perceptron network". Moreover, MLP "perceptrons" are not perceptrons in the strictest possible sense. True perceptrons are formally a special case of artificial neurons that use a threshold activation function such as the [[Heaviside step function]]. MLP perceptrons can employ arbitrary activation functions. A true perceptron performs binary classification (either this or that), an MLP neuron is free to either perform classification or regression, depending upon its activation function.

The term "multilayer perceptron" later was applied without respect to nature of the nodes/layers, which can be composed of arbitrarily defined artificial neurons, and not perceptrons specifically. This interpretation avoids the loosening of the definition of "perceptron" to mean an artificial neuron in general.

== Applications ==
MLPs are useful in research for their ability to solve problems stochastically, which often allows approximate solutions for extremely [[Computational complexity theory|complex]] problems like [[fitness approximation]].

MLPs are universal function approximators as showed by Cybenko's theorem,&lt;ref name="Cybenko1989"/&gt; so they can be used to create mathematical models by regression analysis. As [[Statistical classification|classification]] is a particular case of [[Regression analysis|regression]] when the response variable is [[Categorical variable|categorical]], MLPs make good classifier algorithms.

MLPs were a popular machine learning solution in the 1980s, finding applications in diverse fields such as [[speech recognition]], [[image recognition]], and [[machine translation]] software,&lt;ref&gt;Neural networks. II. What are they and why is everybody so interested in them now?; Wasserman, P.D.; Schwartz, T.; Page(s): 10-15; IEEE Expert, 1988, Volume 3, Issue 1&lt;/ref&gt; but thereafter faced strong competition from much simpler (and related&lt;ref&gt;R. Collobert and S. Bengio (2004). Links between Perceptrons, MLPs and SVMs. Proc. Int'l Conf. on Machine Learning (ICML).&lt;/ref&gt;) [[support vector machine]]s. Interest in backpropagation networks returned due to the successes of [[deep learning]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8106">[[File:Grace brown photo.jpg|right|thumb|Grace Brown]]'''Grace Mae Brown''' (March 20, 1886 – July 12, 1906) was an American skirt factory worker whose murder caused a nationwide sensation, and whose life inspired the fictional character [[Roberta Alden]] in [[Theodore Dreiser]]'s novel ''[[An American Tragedy]]'' as well as [[Jennifer Donnelly]]'s novel ''[[A Northern Light]]''. The facts of the real murder are laid out in the two non-fiction books, both published in 1986: ''Adirondack Tragedy: The Gillette Murder Case of 1906'', written by Joseph W. Brownell and Patricia A. Wawrzaszek, and ''Murder in the Adirondacks: An American Tragedy Revisited'', by Craig Brandon.

== Childhood ==
Brown grew up in South [[Otselic, New York]], the daughter of a successful [[Chenango County]] farmer. She was reportedly given the nickname "Billy" because of her love of the contemporary hit song ''[[Won't You Come Home Bill Bailey]]''; Brown often signed her love letters "The Kid" after the Western outlaw [[Billy the Kid]]. She attended grammar school in the village, and became close friends with teacher Maud Kenyon Crumb and her husband. In 1904, she moved to nearby [[Cortland, New York|Cortland]] to live with a married sister, and went to work at the Gillette Skirt Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ovcs.org/education/components/scrapbook/default.php?sectiondetailid=957/ ovcs.org] -Retrieved 2011-02-18  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727160505/http://www.ovcs.org/education/components/scrapbook/default.php?sectiondetailid=957%2F |date=July 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Romance ==
[[Chester Gillette]], the company owner's nephew, moved to Cortland in 1905, and began a romantic and sexual relationship with Brown. In Spring 1906, Brown became pregnant, and she returned to her parents in South Otselic. Gillette agreed to take her away to the Adirondacks, apparently promising marriage. Because Brown packed her entire wardrobe for the trip and Gillette packed just a small suitcase, some 21st-century historians conjecture that Gillette had promised to take Brown to a [[maternity home]] in upstate New York. Gillette and Brown  stayed for a night in [[Utica, New York]], and then continued by train  to [[Tupper Lake (New York)|Tupper Lake]] in [[Franklin County, New York|Franklin County]], spending the night. Rain the next day ruined their plans for a outing on a nearby lake, so they returned south again by train to [[Big Moose Lake]] in [[Herkimer County, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Herkimer County Courthouse and the Trial That Inspired "An American Tragedy" by Theodore Dreiser | work = UCS Benchmarks | publisher = New York State Unified Court System | year = 2006 | url = http://www.nycourts.gov/publications/benchmarks/issue4/historiccourthouses.shtml | accessdate = 27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- old: [http://www.courts.state.ny.us/history/gillette.htm/ The affair] --&gt;

== Murder ==
On July 11, the couple were seen rowing out on [[Big Moose Lake]] near [[Covewood Lodge]]. Gillette had entered the pseudonym "Carl Grahm" in the hotel register (Gillette's suitcase was monogrammed "C.E.G.", and he was careful to choose a name with the same initials). Gillette is believed to have struck Brown over the head with a tennis racket, and she fell out of the boat and drowned. Gillette returned alone, and gave varying explanations for what had occurred.&lt;ref name="nytreport01"&gt;Staff report (July 14, 1906). Mystery in Girl's Death: Body Found in Adirondack Lake -- Man Companion Missing. ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Brown's body was found the next day, and Gillette was arrested in the nearby town of [[Inlet, New York]]. The defense at trial claimed that Grace was perplexed, and just jumped out of the boat and into the water, despite being fully clothed. Gillette testified, "We talked a little more, then she got up and jumped in the water, just jumped in."&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1906/11/29/101809747.pdf '''Grace Brown a suicide, says Gillette at trial'''] New York Times, originally published: November 29, 1906; nytimes.com -Retrieved 2011-02-18&lt;/ref&gt;

== Love letters ==
In Gillette's rented room, authorities confiscated Brown's love letters to Gillette as evidence. District attorney George Ward read the letters aloud to the court during the trial in the fall of 1906, and Brown's letters gave the trial national attention. Brown pleaded with Gillette in the letters to accept responsibility for her pregnancy. In her final letter, written July 5, Brown looked forward to her impending Adirondack trip with Gillette, and she said farewell to her childhood home of South Otselic, wishing she could confess her pregnancy to her mother: "I know I shall never see any of them again. And mamma! Great heavens, how I do love Mamma! I don't know what I shall do without her (...) Sometimes I think if I could tell mamma, but I can't. She has trouble enough as it is, and I couldn't break her heart like that. If I come back dead, perhaps if she does not know, she won't be angry with me."&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1906/11/21/101808604.pdf ''Grace Brown's letters stir audience to tears'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Copies of Brown's love letters were published in booklet form, and even sold outside the courtroom during the trial. [[Theodore Dreiser]] paraphrased many of the actual letters in ''[[An American Tragedy]]'', quoting the final letter almost verbatim. [[Jennifer Donnelly]] used many of the actual letters in ''[[A Northern Light]]''. Letters written between the two, as well as the diary of Gillette, have been donated to [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]].

== The trial==
The trial lasted three weeks, and resulted in a guilty verdict and a death sentence. The New York Court of Appeals affirmed the judgement, and Governor [[Charles Evans Hughes]] refused to grant clemency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Clemency Denied | work = | publisher = | date = | url = https://www.courts.state.ny.us/history/pdf/gillette/clemency.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gillette was executed on March 30, 1908 in [[Auburn Correctional Facility]] by [[Electric chair|electrocution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Brandon | first = Craig | title = Murder in the Adirondacks | year = 2006 | url = http://www.craigbrandon.com/MITAhome.html | accessdate = 2011-02-18 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110208052639/http://www.craigbrandon.com/MITAhome.html | archive-date = 2011-02-08 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hannah Elizabeth Graham''' (February 25, 1996 – {{circa}} September 13, 2014) was an 18-year-old second-year [[British American]] student at the [[University of Virginia]] who went missing on September 13, 2014. She was last seen early in the morning that day, at the [[Downtown Mall]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/19/us/virginia-missing-student-hannah-graham/ | title=Major break: Police search car, apartment in case of missing Virginia student | work=CNN | date=19 September 2014 | accessdate=19 September 2014 | author=Carter, Chelsea}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five weeks later, her remains were discovered on an abandoned property in nearby [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]].&lt;ref name="remains_ID"/&gt; Jesse Matthew pled guilty to murdering Graham and was given a lifetime prison sentence. He was also found guilty and sentenced to three additional lifetimes for other, previous crimes.

==Background==
Graham's friends last heard from her via text message at about 1:20 am that day, after she told them she was on her way to a party, but was lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/19/missing-virginia-student/15890571/ | title=Police ID man who left bar with missing U.Va. student | work=USA Today | date=19 September 2014 | accessdate=19 September 2014 | author=Vasiliadis, Joanne}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had attended another party before disappearing.&lt;ref name="nbc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hannah-graham-what-happened-missing-virginia-student-n208556 | title=Hannah Graham: What Happened to the Missing Virginia Student? | work=NBC News | date=22 September 2014 | accessdate=22 September 2014 | author=Stelloh, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to surveillance footage and witness testimony, among the last places she was seen was at Tempo Restaurant with Jesse Leeroy Matthew Jr., a 32-year-old man and [[person of interest]]. A witness also said that Matthew was seen in the restaurant holding an arm around Graham, and that she looked drunk. Because Graham was below the US [[legal drinking age]], Tempo Restaurant could face legal action if these sightings are confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/bar-center-missing-uva-student-case-face-legal/story?id=25787415 | title=Bar at Center of Missing UVA Student Case May Face Legal Trouble | work=ABC News | date=27 September 2014 | accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last witness to see Hannah Graham alive says that Graham was with a man who "did not look friendly." As Graham was standing by a vehicle identified to be Matthew's orange 1998 [[Chrysler Sebring]], the witness heard her say, "I'm not getting in that car with you!"&lt;ref name="nbc29"&gt;{{cite news|title=Statement of Facts Reveal New Details in Graham and Harrington Cases|url=http://www.nbc29.com/story/31371788/statement-of-facts-reveal-new-details-in-graham-and-harrington-cases|accessdate=3 March 2016|publisher=NBC29|date=March 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Over a decade earlier, Matthew was twice accused of sexual assault at two separate Virginia colleges he attended as a student; he left each school immediately after each allegation. The reported assaults occurred within an 11-month period of each other: from 2002 to 2003 as Jesse Leeroy "LJ" Matthew, Jr. moved from the evangelical Christian [[Liberty University]] in [[Lynchburg, VA|Lynchburg]] to the [[Christopher Newport University]] in [[Newport News]]. Police investigated each report, but in neither incident was a criminal case brought against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/court-hearing-for-suspect-in-disappearance-of-u-va-student-hannah-graham-moved/2014/10/01/e2b66508-4988-11e4-b72e-d60a9229cc10_story.html |title=U-Va. suspect Jesse L. Matthew Jr. twice accused of college sex assaults|work=The Washington Post|date= October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Search==

===Volunteer search===
On September 20, a volunteer search for Graham took place throughout [[Charlottesville]]. Over 1,000 volunteers were reported to have been involved in the search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/article2180909.html | title=Hundreds search for missing UVa student | work=Miami Herald | date=20 September 2014 | accessdate=20 September 2014 | author=Suderman, Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Search efforts===
On September 25, Charlottesville police chief Timothy Longo said he believed that Graham was either in Charlottesville or one of the surrounding nine counties, and asked property owners to search for her on their own land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/police-ask-property-owners-to-help-search-for-hannah-graham/ | title=Police ask property owners to help search for Hannah Graham | work=CBS News | date=25 September 2014 | accessdate=25 September 2014 | author=Crimesider Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Emergency Management organized two-person search teams in the search for Graham and estimated that as of September 26, those crews spent 44 hours in the field since the volunteer search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/09/26/with-suspect-in-custody-significant-challenges-remain-in-missing-uva-student/ | title=Challenges remain in case of missing UVA student | work=Fox News Channel | date=26 September 2014 | accessdate=26 September 2014 | agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remains found===
On October 18, 2014, human remains were found at an abandoned property in [[Albemarle County, Virginia]], by searchers from the [[Chesterfield County Sheriff's Office]]. At a press conference later that day, Chief Longo stated that the remains had not been positively identified as Graham; however, authorities informed Graham's parents of the discovery. The remains were sent to the Chief Medical Examiner's office in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] for identification.&lt;ref name="remains"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://wtvr.com/2014/10/18/hannah-graham-update/ |title=Crew searching for missing UVa. student Hannah Graham finds human remains |work=[[WTVR-TV]] |date=18 October 2014 |accessdate=18 October 2014 |author=Scott Wise, Alix Bryan and Chelsea Rarrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 24, the remains were positively identified as Graham.&lt;ref name="remains_ID"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbc29.com/story/26886621/medical-examiner-confirms-hannah-grahams-remains-found-in-albemarle |title=Medical Examiner Confirms Hannah Graham's Remains Found in Albemarle |work=[[WVIR]] |date=24 October 2014 |accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same day, Graham's parents visited the property where she was found.&lt;ref name="parentsvisit"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbc29.com/story/26883590/hannah-grahams-parents-visit-old-lynchburg-road-crime-scene |title=Hannah Graham's Parents Visit Old Lynchburg Road Crime Scene |work=[[WVIR]] |date=24 October 2014 |accessdate=24 October 2014 |first=Henry |last=Graff}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 18, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that a cause for Graham's death was determined but was withheld at the request of law enforcement.&lt;ref name="washpost_111814"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/hannah-graham-cause-of-death-determined-officials-withholding-details/2014/11/18/2810156c-6f37-11e4-893f-86bd390a3340_story.html |title=Hannah Graham cause of death determined, officials withholding details |work=[[The Washington Post]] |first=T. Rees |last=Shapiro |date=18 November 2014 |accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, the [[Albemarle County Police Department]] reversed course, releasing that Graham died of homicide by an "undetermined etiology".&lt;ref name="deathcause_111814"/&gt;&lt;ref name="policetweet_111914"&gt;{{cite tweet |author= AlbemarleCoPolice |user= AlbemarleCoPD|number= 534827736691666944 |date= 18 November 2014 |title= "The cause of death is homicidal violence of undetermined etiology. The manner of death is homicide." |access-date= 19 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suspect==
On September 19, the local police identified a man they described as a "person of interest" whom they saw on surveillance cameras leaving a bar with Graham. The police have concluded that Graham may have gotten into a car with this man. They also searched the man's car and apartment, but declined to arrest or identify him at that time.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/missing-uva-teen-spent-hours-before-disappearance-with-friends/2014/09/19/b425aab8-4001-11e4-b03f-de718edeb92f_story.html | title=Police scrutinize 'person of interest' seen with missing U-Va. student Hannah Graham | work=Washington Post | date=19 September 2014 | accessdate=19 September 2014 | author=Shapiro, T.

===Arrest===
On September 21, the police issued an arrest warrant for reckless driving by Jesse Matthew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/09/21/hundreds-volunteers-search-for-missing-university-virginia-student/ | title=Man seen with missing UVA student Hannah Graham faces driving charge | work=Fox News | date=21 September 2014 | accessdate=22 September 2014 | agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 23, Longo announced that Matthew had been charged with abduction with intent to defile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/arrest-warrant-suspect-missing-university-of-virginia-student-hannah-graham/ | title=Arrest warrant for suspect in U.Va. missing case | work=CBS News | date=23 September 2014 | accessdate=23 September 2014 | author=Crimesider Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 24, Longo, during a joint press conference with the FBI, announced that the suspect had been arrested in a sparsely populated part of [[Galveston County, Texas]] after being recognized by a woman on a beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hannah-graham-suspect-arrested-case-missing-uva-student-n210996 | title=Hannah Graham: Suspect Arrested in Case of Missing UVA Student | work=NBC News | date=24 September 2014 | accessdate=24 September 2014 | author=Gittens, Hasani}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Suspect-in-missing-UVA-student-s-abduction-5778791.php | title=Suspect in missing UVA student's abduction arrested in Galveston Co. | work=Houston Chronicle | date=25 September 2014 | accessdate=25 September 2014 | author=George, Cindy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connection to Morgan Harrington case===
{{see also|Murder of Morgan Dana Harrington}}
The suspect has been forensically linked by the Virginia State Police to the [[murder of Morgan Dana Harrington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/suspect-hannah-graham-disappearance-tied-2009-murder-police/story?id=25840656 |title=Suspect in Hannah Graham Disappearance Tied to 2009 Murder, Police Say|work=ABC News|date= September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29, 2014, it was reported that forensic evidence taken from the investigation into the murder of Morgan Dana Harrington matched evidence taken from Jesse Matthew. Sources close to the Graham investigation added that Harrington interacted with Matthew on the night she disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wtkr.com/2014/09/29/breaking-forensic-evidence-links-hannah-graham-suspect-to-murdered-virginia-tech-student-morgan-harrington/ | title=BREAKING: Forensic evidence links Hannah Graham suspect to murdered Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington | work=[[WTKR]] | date=29 September 2014 | accessdate=29 September 2014 | author=Mitchell, Becca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham's remains were found about five miles from the location where Harrington's remains were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://wtvr.com/2014/10/18/legal-analyst-on-remains-discovery/ |title=What does discovery of remains mean for Hannah Graham suspect Jesse Matthew? |work=WTVR-TV |date=18 October 2014 |accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew attended [[Liberty University]], and later, [[Christopher Newport University]]; he was accused of sexual assault once at each of those universities. The first alleged incident occurred on October 17, 2002, and the second on September 7, 2003.&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt;

On September 15, 2015, Matthew was formally charged with first degree murder and abduction with intent to defile in the murder of Morgan Harrington.&lt;ref name=WBDJ&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.wdbj7.com/news/local/jesse-matthew-charged-in-murder-of-morgan-harringto/35290040/|title= Jesse Matthew charged in murder of Morgan Harrington|work= WDBJ 7|date= September 15, 2015|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150916170939/http://www.wdbj7.com/news/local/jesse-matthew-charged-in-murder-of-morgan-harringto/35290040|archivedate= September 16, 2015|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a February 29, 2016 letter to news media, prosecutors said Matthew would plead guilty.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|author=T.

'''Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus''' (January 14, 38 BC&lt;ref name="birthday1"/&gt; – summer of 9 BC&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, [[The Twelve Caesars]], Claudius, 1&lt;/ref&gt;), born '''Decimus Claudius Drusus''',{{sfnp|Powell|2011|page=3}} also called '''Drusus Claudius Nero''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/tiberius.htm De Imperatoribus Romanis - An Online Encyclopedia of Roman Emperors, Tiberius (A.D. 14-37), written by Garrett G. Fagan of Pennsylvania State University]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Drusus''', '''Drusus I''', '''Nero Drusus''', or '''Drusus the Elder''' was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] politician and military commander. He was a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] [[Claudia (gens)|Claudian]] on his legal father's side but his maternal grandmother was from a [[plebeian]] family. He was the son of [[Livia|Livia Drusilla]] and the legal stepson of her second husband, the Emperor [[Augustus]]. He was also brother of the Emperor [[Tiberius]], father to both the Emperor [[Claudius]] and general [[Germanicus]], paternal grandfather of the Emperor [[Caligula]], and maternal great-grandfather of the Emperor [[Nero]].

He launched the first major Roman campaigns across the [[Rhine]] and began the conquest of [[Germania]], becoming the first Roman general to reach the [[Weser]] and [[Elbe]] rivers. In 12 BC, Drusus led a successful [[Early Imperial campaigns in Germania|campaign]] into Germania, subjugating the [[Sicambri]]. Later that year he led a naval expedition against Germanic tribes along the [[North Sea]] coast, conquering the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]] and the [[Frisii]], and defeating the [[Chauci]] near the mouth of the Weser. In 11 BC, he conquered the [[Usipetes]] and the [[Marsi (Germanic)|Marsi]], extending Roman control to the Upper Weser. In 10 BC, he launched a campaign against the [[Chatti]] and the resurgent Sicambri, subjugating both. The following year, while serving as [[Roman consul|consul]], he conquered the [[Mattiaci]] and defeated the [[Marcomanni]] and the [[Cherusci]], the latter near the Elbe. However, Drusus died later that year, depriving Rome of one of its best generals.

==Childhood==
Drusus was the youngest son of [[Livia|Livia Drusilla]] from her marriage to [[Tiberius Claudius Nero (praetor 42 BC)|Tiberius Claudius Nero]], who was legally declared his father before the couple divorced. Drusus was born between mid-March and mid-April 38 BC, three months after Livia married [[Augustus]] on 17 January.&lt;ref&gt;Donna W. Hurley, ''Suetonius: Divus Claudius'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=9yVR5Fac278C&amp;pg=PA106 p. 106]&lt;/ref&gt; Gerhard Radke has proposed the date of March 28 as his most likely [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies natalis|birthday]],&lt;ref name="birthday1"&gt;At ''Divus Claudius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#11.3 11.3], Suetonius says that Claudius as emperor commemorated the birthday ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies natalis|dies natalis]])'' of his father Drusus on the same date as that of [[Mark Antony]], his maternal grandfather, whose birthday on January 14, ca. 83 BC, had been decreed as a "defective" day ''([[dies vitiosus]])'' by Augustus ([[Cassius Dio]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/51*.html#19.3 51.9.3]). However, since Drusus's birth is also recorded as occurring within the third month after Livia's marriage to Augustus on January 17, Radke proposes that Claudius used the astronomical discrepancies between the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian calendar]] under which Antony was born and the [[Julian calendar]] in effect at the time of Drusus' birth, to show that had the two been born under the same calendar, they would have shared a birthday. Gilbert Radke (1978), "Der Geburtstag des älteren Drusus," ''Wurzburger Jahrbucher fur die Altertumswissenschaft'' 4 (1978), pp. 211–213. Reviewing these theories, Anthony A. Barrett still considers January 14 the most probable birthdate, explaining the apparent three-month discrepancy as referring to Livia's betrothal, not her marriage {{harv|Barrett|2002|pages=313–314}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while Lindsay Powell interprets Ovid's ''Fasti'' as indicating a date of 13 January.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|page=3}} Rumors arose that Augustus was the child's real father, although this has never been authoritatively proven. Claudius, however, encouraged the rumor during his reign as emperor to create an impression of more direct lineage from Augustus.

According to [[Suetonius]], Drusus was originally given ''Decimus'' as his [[praenomen]], the first of a Roman male's conventional three names in [[Roman naming convention|Roman naming practice]] at the time. ''Nero'' was a traditional [[cognomen]] (third name) of the [[Claudia (gens)|Claudii]], whereas ''Drusus'' was given to a branch of the ''[[Livia (gens)|gens Livia]]''. Using a cognomen such as ''Nero'' as a first name was unusual, as was the prominence given to his maternal lineage in adopting ''Drusus'' as his cognomen.

Drusus was raised in Claudius Nero's house with his brother, the future emperor [[Tiberius]], until his legal father's death. The two brothers developed a famously close relationship that would last the rest of their lives. Tiberius named his eldest son after his brother, and Drusus did likewise, although eldest sons were usually named after their father or grandfather.

== Marriage ==
[[File:Hera Ludovisi Altemps Inv8631.jpg|left|upright=0.8|thumb|The [[Juno Ludovisi]], a 1st-century CE depiction of Drusus' wife Antonia Minor as [[Juno (deity)|Juno]]]]
Drusus married [[Antonia Minor]], the daughter of [[Mark Antony]] and Augustus' sister, [[Octavia Minor]], and gained a reputation of being completely faithful to her.&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]], ''[[Factorum ac dictorum memorabilium libri IX]]'' IV.3.3 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/4*.html (Latin text)]. Cited in {{harvp|Powell|2011|page=91}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their children were [[Germanicus]], [[Claudius]], a daughter named [[Livilla (sister of Claudius)|Livilla ('little Livia')]], and at least two others who did not survive infancy. After Drusus' death, Antonia never remarried, though she outlived him by nearly five decades. Three emperors were direct descendants of Drusus: his son [[Claudius]], his grandson [[Caligula]], and his great-grandson [[Nero]].

==Career==
Augustus bestowed many honors on his stepsons. In 19 BC, Drusus was granted the ability to hold all public offices five years before the minimum age. When Tiberius left Italy during his term as praetor in 16 BC, Drusus legislated in his place. He became quaestor the following year, fighting against [[Raetia]]n bandits in the [[Alps]]. Drusus repelled them, gaining honors, but was unable to smash their forces, and required reinforcement from Tiberius. The brothers easily defeated the local Alpine tribes.

Drusus arrived in Gaul in late 15 BCE to serve as ''legatus Augusti pro praetore'' (governor on Augustus' behalf with the authority of a praetor) of the three Gaulish provinces.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|pages=48-49}} His contribution to the ongoing building and urban development in Gaul can be seen in the establishment of the ''pes Drusianus'', or ‘Drusian [[Foot (unit)|foot]]’, of about {{convert|33.3|cm|in|abbr=on}}, which was in use in [[Amiens#Antiquity|Samarobriva]] (modern [[Amiens]]) and among the [[Tungri]].{{sfnp|Powell|2011|pages=53-54}} From 14 to 13 BCE, Augustus himself was also active in Gaul, whether in Lugdunum (modern Lyon) or along the Rhine frontier.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|pages=48, 61, 70}}

As governor of Gaul, Drusus made his headquarters at Lugdunum, where he decided to establish the ''concilium Galliarum'' or ‘council of the Gaulish provinces’ sometime between 14 and 12 BCE.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|page=56}} This council would elect from its members a priest to celebrate games and venerate [[dea Roma|Rome]] and [[Augustus]] as deities{{sfnp|Powell|2011|pages=56-57}} every 1 August at the altar of the three Gauls that Drusus established at [[La Croix-Rousse|Condate]] in 10 BCE.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|pages=97-99}} Drusus' son Tiberius—the future emperor [[Claudius]]—was born in Lugdunum on the same day that this altar was inaugurated.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|page=99}}

===Germanic campaigns===
{{Further|Early Imperial campaigns in Germania}}
[[File:Druso in Germania per Wikipedia.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Map of Drusus' campaigns against the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]], 12-9 BC]]

Starting in 14 BCE, Drusus built a string of military bases along the Rhine—fifty according to [[Florus]]—and established an alliance with the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]] in preparation for military action in Germania Libera.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|pages=62-64}} He is likely to have had seven legions under his command.&lt;ref&gt;These were, according to {{harvp|Powell|2011|page=61}}, [[Legio I Germanica|Legiones I Germanica]], [[Legio V Alaudae|V Alaudae]], [[Legio XIII Gemina|XIII Gemina]], [[Legio XIV Gemina|XIV Gemina]], [[Legio XVI Gallica|XVI Gallica]], [[Legio XVII|XVII]], [[Legio XVIII|XVIII]], and [[Legio XIX|XIX]] (the last three being the legions that would [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest|later be destroyed]] while under the command of [[Publius Quinctilius Varus|Varus]]).&lt;/ref&gt; In spring of 12 BCE, he [[Early Imperial campaigns in Germania|embarked]] an expeditionary force, perhaps consisting of the [[Legio I Germanica|Legiones I Germanica]] and [[Legio V Alaudae|V Alaudae]], by ship from the vicinity of modern [[Nijmegen]], making use of one or more canals he had built for the purpose.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|pages=64-65, 70}} Drusus sailed to the mouth of the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] and penetrated into the territory of the [[Chauci]] in present-day [[Lower Saxony]].{{sfnp|Powell|2011|pages=74, 77}} The Chauci concluded a treaty acknowledging Roman supremacy, and would remain allies of Rome for years to come.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|page=78}} As they continued to ascend the Ems, the Romans were attacked by the [[Bructeri]] in boats.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|pages=78-79}} Drusus' forces defeated the Bructeri, but, as it was now late in the campaign season, turned back for their winter quarters in Gaul, taking advantage of their new alliance with the [[Frisii]] to navigate through the difficult conditions on the [[North Sea]].{{sfnp|Powell|2011|page=79}}

As a reward for the successes of his campaign in 12 BCE, Drusus was made ''[[praetor#Praetor urbanus|praetor urbanus]]'' for 11 BCE when he returned to Rome for the winter.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|page=79}} News of Drusus' achievements—navigating the North Sea, carrying the Roman eagles into new territory, and fixing new peoples into treaty relations with Rome—caused considerable excitement in Rome and were commemorated on coins.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|page=79}}

Drusus did not have it in him to stay in Rome. In the spring of his term as ''praetor urbanus'', he set out for the German border once more. This time, he assembled a force consisting of all or part of five legions in addition to auxiliaries and, setting out from [[Xanten|Vetera]] on the Rhine, ascended the [[Lippe (river)|River Lippe]]. Here he encountered the [[Tencteri]] and [[Usipetes]], whom he defeated in two separate engagements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Powell|2011|page=81}}. The legions in question this time were the I Germanica, the V Alaudae, the XVII, the XVIII, and the XIX.&lt;/ref&gt; He reached the [[Werra|Werra Valley]] before deciding to turn back for the season, as winter was coming on, supplies were dwindling, and the omens were unfavorable.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|pages=83-84}} While his forces were making their way back through the territory of the [[Cherusci]], the latter tribe laid an ambush for them at Arbalo.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|page=89}} The Cherusci failed to capitalize on their initial advantage, whereupon the Romans broke through their lines, defeated the Germanic attackers, and acclaimed Drusus as ''imperator''.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|page=89}} To show his continued mastery of the ground, Drusus garrisoned a number of positions within Germania during the winter of 11–10 BCE, including one somewhere in [[Hesse]]{{sfnp|Powell|2011|page=91}} and one in Cheruscan territory, probably either [[:de:Römerlager Haltern|the camp]] at [[Haltern am See|Haltern]] or [[:de:Römerlager Oberaden|that at]] [[Bergkamen|Bergkamen-Oberaden]],{{sfnp|Powell|2011|page=90}} both in present-day [[North Rhine-Westphalia|North Rhine–Westphalia]].

He rejoined his wife Antonia and two children for a time in Lugdunum before the family returned to Rome, where Drusus reported to Augustus.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|page=91}} Drusus was given the honor of an [[ovation]], and for the second time, Augustus closed the doors of the [[Temple of Janus (Roman Forum)|Temple of Janus]], signifying that the whole Roman world was then at peace.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|page=92}}
Drusus was granted the office of proconsul for the following year. In 10 BC, the [[Chatti]] joined with the [[Sicambri]] and attacked Drusus' camp, but they were driven back. Drusus pursued them, proceeding from the sites of present-day Mainz and [[:de:Römerlager Rödgen|Rödgen]], where he set up a base of supply, to [[Hedemünden]], where a strong new camp was established.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|pages=xxvii, 93}} Around this time, the canny [[Marcomanni]]c king [[Maroboduus]] responded to the Roman incursion by relocating his people ''en masse'' to [[Bohemia]].{{sfnp|Powell|2011|page=94}} In summer of 10 BCE, Drusus left the field in order to return to [[Lugdunum]], where he inaugurated the sanctuary of the Three Gaulish provinces at Condate on 1 August.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|page=97}} Augustus and Tiberius were in Lugdunum for this occasion (when Drusus' youngest son Claudius was born), and afterwards Drusus accompanied them back to Rome.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|page=99}}

Drusus easily won election as [[Roman consul|consul]] for the year 9 BCE.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|page=100}} Once more he left the city before assuming office. His consulship conferred the chance for Drusus to attain Rome's highest and rarest military honor, the ''[[spolia opima]]'', or spoils of an enemy chieftain slain personally by an opposing Roman general who was fighting (as consuls did) under his own auspices.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|page=95}} He quickly returned to the field, stopping to confer with his staff at Lugdunum and to dedicate a temple to Caesar Augustus at [[Langres|Andemantunnum]], before rejoining his command at Mainz, from which the year's expedition departed in early spring.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|page=102}} Drusus led the army via Rödgen through the territories of the [[Marsi]] and [[Cherusci]] until he even crossed the river [[Elbe]].{{sfnp|Powell|2011|pages=102-104}} Here he is said to have seen an apparition of a Germanic woman who warned him against proceeding farther and that his death was near. Drusus turned back,{{sfnp|Powell|2011|page=104}} erecting a trophy to commemorate his reaching the Elbe, perhaps on the site of Dresden or Magdeburg.{{sfnp|Powell|2011|page=105}}

Drusus had sought out multiple Germanic (at least three) chieftains during his campaigns in Germany (12 BCE–9 BCE), engaging them in "dazzling displays of single combat".{{sfnp|Powell|2011|page=94}} The sources are ambiguous, but imply that at some point he did take the ''spolia opima'' from a Germanic king, thus becoming the fourth and final Roman to gain this honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Powell|2011|page=96}} and note 155 on p.&amp;nbsp;199, citing Suetonius ''Claudius'' I.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drusus was returning from his advance to the Elbe when he [[List of horse accidents|fell from his horse]],&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Levick, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ev4CkGHgfMUC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=Nero+Claudius+Drusus+death&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z6g7owKgkG&amp;sig=7oYA_UDMvvhVPA9Ar7UtGXtTk-g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=POOAUN36FKSyiQeNoYC4Bw&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Nero%20Claudius%20Drusus%20death&amp;f=false Claudius]'' (Yale University Press, Sep. 10, 1993), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; lingering on for a month after the accident, by which point Tiberius had joined him. Shortly before his death he wrote a letter to Tiberius complaining about the style in which Augustus ruled. [[The Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]] reports that he had refused to return to Rome just before his death. Drusus' body was brought back to the city, and his ashes were deposited in the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]]. He remained extremely popular with the [[legionary|legionaries]], who erected a monument (the [[Drususstein]]) in ''Mogontiacum'' (modern [[Mainz]]) on his behalf. Remnants of this are still standing. His family was granted the hereditary honorific title "Germanicus", which was given to his eldest son before passing to his youngest. Augustus later wrote a biography of him which does not survive. By Augustus' decree, festivals were held in Mogontiacum at Drusus' death day and probably also on his birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Claudius'' I.1.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Drusus' mother [[Livia]], much affected by the death of her second son, took the advice of the philosopher [[Arius Didymus|Areus]] to put up many statues and images of Drusus and speak often about him.{{sfnp|Barrett|2002|page=44}} The surviving Latin work ''[[Ovid#Consolatio ad Liviam .28.22Consolation to Livia.22.29|Consolatio ad Liviam]]'' is framed as an [[Ovid]]ian [[consolatio|message of consolation]] to Livia on this occasion, though it is generally considered a literary exercise "composed between the death of Livia [29 CE] and that of Tiberius [37 CE]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''Consolatio ad Liviam'' by Arnold Witlox |author=Arnold M. Duff |journal=The Classical Review |volume=49 |number=4 |date=1935 |pages=155–156 |jstor=699709 |doi=10.1017/s0009840x00068323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustus noted the successes of Drusus' campaigns—for which, as Drusus' superior, he took credit—in his ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'', written in 14 CE:

{{Quote|text=I restored peace to the provinces of Gaul and Spain, likewise Germany, which includes the ocean from Cadiz to the mouth of the river Elbe. [...] I sailed my ships on the ocean from the mouth of the Rhine to the east region up to the borders of the Cimbri, where no Roman had gone before that time by land or sea, and the Cimbri and the Charydes and the Semnones and the other Germans of the same territory sought by envoys the friendship of me and of the Roman people. |author=Augustus |source=''Res Gestae Divi Augusti''&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustus]], ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'' 26. [http://classics.mit.edu/Augustus/deeds.html Translated] by Thomas Bushnell (2011) and placed by his permission [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Deeds_of_the_Divine_Augustus on Wikisource]. Passage also quoted in {{harvp|Powell|2011|page=80}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Upon [[Claudius]]' accession to the principate in 41 CE, his late father Drusus received new public honors, including annual games in the Circus Maximus on January 14 for Drusus' birthday, coin issues commemorating Drusus' victories in Germania, and the restoration of a monument near the [[Ara Pacis Augustae]] that featured a statue of Drusus.{{sfnp|Osgood|2011|pages=60-61}} Claudius also completed a road from Italy into [[Raetia]] that followed the route Drusus had taken and whose road-markers commemorated Drusus' achievements in the Alpine war.{{sfnp|Osgood|2011|page=188}} Such Claudian commemorations of Drusus' memory are thought to have become less prominent once Claudius had his own [[Roman conquest of Britain|British triumph]] to celebrate.{{sfnp|Osgood|2011|page=93}}

==In popular culture==
He is a minor character in [[Robert Graves]]' historical novel ''[[I, Claudius]]'', as well as the [[I, Claudius (TV series)|BBC's adaptation]] of the same title.

The annual festival celebrating Drusus' death is a main plot element in the second volume of ''the Romanike series'' by Codex Regius (2006-2014).

He is a prominent character in the ''Hrabam Chronicles'' by Alaric Longward (2016).

=== Marine organisms ===
[[Marine invertebrates]] suffered the greatest losses during the P–Tr extinction. Evidence of this was found in samples from south China sections at the P–Tr boundary. Here, 286 out of 329 marine invertebrate genera disappear within the final 2 sedimentary zones containing [[conodont]]s from the Permian.&lt;ref name="Jin2000" /&gt; The decrease in [[Biodiversity|diversity]] was probably caused by a sharp increase in extinctions, rather than a decrease in [[speciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bambach |first1=R.K. |last2=Knoll |first2=A.H. |last3=Wang |first3=S.C. |title=Origination, extinction, and mass depletions of marine diversity |journal=Paleobiology |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=522–542 |date=December 2004 |url=http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;issn=0094-8373&amp;volume=30&amp;page=522 |doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2004)030&lt;0522:OEAMDO&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn=0094-8373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ammonoidea|ammonoids]], which had been in a long-term decline for the 30 million years since the [[Roadian]] (middle Permian), suffered a selective extinction pulse 10 million years before the main event, at the end of the [[Capitanian]] stage. In this preliminary extinction, which greatly reduced [[Guild (ecology)|disparity]], or the range  of different ecological guilds, environmental factors were apparently responsible. Diversity and disparity fell further until the P–Tr boundary; the extinction here (P–Tr) was non-selective, consistent with a catastrophic initiator. During the Triassic, diversity rose rapidly, but disparity remained low.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = L.| last2 = Korn | first2 = D. | title = Morphological Disparity of Ammonoids and the Mark of Permian Mass Extinctions | url =  | format =  | journal = Science | volume = 306 | issue =5694 | pages = 264–266 | date=October 2004 | last1 = Villier| issn = 0036-8075| pmid = 15472073 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102127

The range of morphospace occupied by the ammonoids, that is, their range of possible forms, shapes or structures, became more restricted as the Permian progressed. A few million years into the Triassic, the original range of ammonoid structures was once again reoccupied, but the parameters were now shared differently among [[clades]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = W.

=== Terrestrial invertebrates ===
The Permian had great diversity in insect and other invertebrate species, including the largest insects ever to have existed. The end-Permian is the only known mass extinction of insects,&lt;ref name="Labandeira"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Labandeira CC, Sepkoski JJ |title=Insect diversity in the fossil record |journal=Science |volume=261 |issue=5119 |pages=310–315 |year=1993 |pmid=11536548 |doi= 10.1126/science.11536548
|bibcode = 1993Sci...261..310L }}&lt;/ref&gt; with eight or nine insect [[Order (biology)|orders]] becoming extinct and ten more greatly reduced in diversity. [[Palaeodictyopteroidea|Palaeodictyopteroids]] (insects with piercing and sucking mouthparts) began to decline during the mid-Permian; these extinctions have been linked to a change in flora. The greatest decline occurred in the Late Permian and was probably not directly caused by weather-related floral transitions.&lt;ref name="Erwin1993" /&gt;

Most fossil insect groups found after the Permian–Triassic boundary differ significantly from those before. Of Paleozoic insect groups, only the [[Glosselytrodea]], [[Miomoptera]], and [[Protorthoptera]] have been discovered in deposits from after the extinction. The [[Exopterygota|caloneurodeans]], [[monura]]ns, paleodictyopteroids, [[protelytroptera]]ns, and [[protodonata|protodonates]] became extinct by the end of the Permian. In well-documented Late Triassic deposits, fossils overwhelmingly consist of modern fossil insect groups.&lt;ref name="Labandeira" /&gt;

At the P–Tr boundary, the dominant floral groups changed, with many groups of land plants entering abrupt decline, such as ''[[Cordaites]]'' ([[gymnosperm]]s) and ''[[Glossopteris]]'' ([[Pteridospermatophyta|seed ferns]]).&lt;ref name=Retallack1995&gt;{{cite journal|author=Retallack, GJ|year=1995|title=Permian–Triassic life crisis on land|journal=Science|volume=267|pages=77–80|issue=5194|doi=10.1126/science.267.5194.77|pmid=17840061|bibcode = 1995Sci...267...77R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominant [[gymnosperm]] genera were replaced post-boundary by [[Lycopodiophyta|lycophytes]]—extant lycophytes are recolonizers of disturbed areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Looy, CV Brugman WA Dilcher DL &amp; Visscher H|year=1999|title=The delayed resurgence of equatorial forests after the Permian–Triassic ecologic crisis|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=96|pages=13857–13862|pmid=10570163|doi=10.1073/pnas.96.24.13857|issue=24|pmc=24155|bibcode = 1999PNAS...9613857L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Palynological]] or pollen studies from East [[Greenland]] of sedimentary rock strata laid down during the extinction period indicate dense gymnosperm [[woodland]]s before the event. At the same time that marine [[invertebrate]] macrofauna declined, these large woodlands died out and were followed by a rise in diversity of smaller [[herbaceous]] plants including [[Lycopodiophyta]], both ''[[Selaginellales]]'' and ''[[Isoetales]]''. Later, other groups of [[gymnosperm]]s again become dominant but again suffered major die offs. These cyclical flora shifts occurred a few times over the course of the extinction period and afterwards. These fluctuations of the dominant flora between woody and [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] taxa indicate chronic environmental stress resulting in a loss of most large woodland plant species. The successions and extinctions of plant communities do not coincide with the shift in [[δ13C|{{delta|13|C}}]] values, but occurred many years after.&lt;ref name="LooyEtAl2005EndPermianDeadZone" /&gt; The recovery of gymnosperm forests took 4–5 million years.&lt;ref name=McElwain2007 /&gt;

==== Coal gap{{anchor|Coal Gap}} ====
No [[coal]] deposits are known from the Early Triassic, and those in the Middle Triassic are thin and low-grade.&lt;ref name="Retallack1996" /&gt; This "coal gap" has been explained in many ways. It has been suggested that new, more aggressive fungi, insects and vertebrates evolved, and killed vast numbers of trees. These [[decomposer]]s themselves suffered heavy losses of species during the extinction, and are not considered a likely cause of the coal gap.&lt;ref name="Retallack1996" /&gt; It could simply be that all coal forming plants were rendered extinct by the P–Tr extinction, and that it took 10 million years for a new suite of plants to adapt to the moist, acid conditions of [[peat]] [[bogs]].&lt;ref name="Retallack1996" /&gt; [[Abiotic]] factors (factors not caused by [[organism]]s), such as decreased rainfall or increased input of [[Clastic rock|clastic sediments]], may also be to blame.&lt;ref name="McElwain2007" /&gt;

On the other hand, the lack of coal may simply reflect the scarcity of all known [[sediment]]s from the Early Triassic. Coal-producing [[ecosystem]]s, rather than disappearing, may have moved to areas where we have no sedimentary record for the Early Triassic.&lt;ref name="McElwain2007" /&gt; For example, in eastern Australia a cold climate had been the norm for a long period, with a peat [[Bog|mire]] ecosystem adapted to these conditions. Approximately 95% of these [[peat-producing]] plants went ''locally'' extinct at the P–Tr boundary;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Michaelsen P|title=Mass extinction of peat-forming plants and the effect on fluvial styles across the Permian–Triassic boundary, northern Bowen Basin, Australia|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|volume=179|issue=3–4|year=2002|pages=173–188|doi=10.1016/S0031-0182(01)00413-8
|bibcode=2002PPP...179..173M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal deposits in Australia and Antarctica disappear significantly ''before'' the P–Tr boundary.&lt;ref name="McElwain2007" /&gt;

=== Terrestrial vertebrates ===
There is enough evidence to indicate that over two-thirds of terrestrial [[labyrinthodont]] [[amphibian]]s, [[sauropsid]] ("reptile") and [[therapsid]] ("proto-mammal") [[Family (biology)|families]] became extinct. Large [[herbivore]]s suffered the heaviest losses.

All Permian [[anapsid]] reptiles died out except the [[Procolophonidae|procolophonids]] (although [[testudines]] have ''morphologically'' anapsid skulls, they are now thought to have separately evolved from diapsid ancestors). [[Pelycosaurs]] died out before the end of the Permian. Too few Permian diapsid fossils have been found to support any conclusion about the effect of the Permian extinction on [[diapsid]]s (the "reptile" group from which lizards, snakes, crocodilians, and [[dinosaur]]s (including birds) evolved).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Maxwell, W. D. | year=1992 | title=Permian and Early Triassic extinction of non-marine tetrapods | journal=Palaeontology | volume=35 | pages=571–583}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Erwin DH | title=The End-Permian Mass Extinction | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume=21 | pages=69–91 | year=1990 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.21.110190.000441 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The groups that survived suffered extremely heavy losses of species, and some terrestrial vertebrate groups very nearly became extinct at the end-Permian. Some of the surviving groups did not persist for long past this period, while others that barely survived went on to produce diverse and long-lasting lineages. Yet it took 30{{nbsp}}million years for the terrestrial vertebrate fauna to fully recover both numerically and ecologically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2008/5785.html|title=Bristol University – News – 2008: Mass extinction|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible explanations of these patterns ===
An analysis of marine fossils from the Permian's final [[Changhsingian]] stage found that marine organisms with low tolerance for [[hypercapnia]] (high concentration of [[carbon dioxide]]) had high extinction rates, while the most tolerant organisms had very slight losses.

The most vulnerable marine organisms were those that produced calcareous hard parts (i.e., from [[calcium carbonate]]) and had low [[metabolic rate]]s and weak [[respiratory system]]s—notably [[calcareous sponge]]s, [[Rugose coral|rugose]] and [[tabulate coral]]s, [[calcite]]-depositing [[brachiopod]]s, [[bryozoa]]ns, and [[echinoderm]]s; about 81% of such [[genus|genera]] became extinct. Close relatives without [[calcareous]] hard parts suffered only minor losses, for example [[sea anemone]]s, from which modern corals evolved. Animals with high metabolic rates, well-developed respiratory systems, and non-calcareous hard parts had negligible losses—except for [[conodont]]s, in which 33% of genera died out.&lt;ref name="KNollBambach2007Paleophysiology"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Knoll, A.H., Bambach, R.K., Payne, J.L., Pruss, S., and Fischer, W.W. | title=Paleophysiology and end-Permian mass extinction | journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters | volume=256 | year=2007 | pages=295–313 | doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2007.02.018 | url=http://pangea.stanford.edu/~jlpayne/Knoll%20et%20al%202007%20EPSL%20Permian%20Triassic%20paleophysiology.pdf | accessdate=2008-07-04 | bibcode=2007E&amp;PSL.256..295K | issue=3–4
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This pattern is consistent with what is known about the effects of [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]], a shortage but not a total absence of [[oxygen]]. However, hypoxia cannot have been the only killing mechanism for marine organisms. Nearly all of the [[continental shelf]] waters would have had to become severely [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] to account for the magnitude of the extinction, but such a catastrophe would make it difficult to explain the very selective pattern of the extinction. [[Mathematical model|Models]] of the Late Permian and Early Triassic atmospheres show a significant but protracted decline in atmospheric oxygen levels, with no acceleration near the P–Tr boundary. Minimum atmospheric oxygen levels in the Early Triassic are never less than present day levels—the decline in oxygen levels does not match the temporal pattern of the extinction.&lt;ref name="KNollBambach2007Paleophysiology" /&gt;

Marine organisms are more sensitive to changes in {{CO2}} ([[carbon dioxide]]) levels than are terrestrial organisms for a variety of reasons. {{CO2}} is 28 times more [[Solubility|soluble]] in water than is oxygen. Marine animals normally function with lower concentrations of {{CO2}} in their bodies than land animals, as the removal of {{CO2}} in air-breathing animals is impeded by the need for the gas to pass through the respiratory system's [[Biological membrane|membrane]]s ([[lung]]s' [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveolus]], [[Invertebrate trachea|tracheae]], and the like), even when {{CO2}} diffuses more easily than oxygen. In marine organisms, relatively modest but sustained increases in {{CO2}} concentrations hamper the synthesis of [[protein]]s, reduce fertilization rates, and produce [[Deformity|deformities]] in calcareous hard parts.&lt;ref name="KNollBambach2007Paleophysiology" /&gt; In addition, an increase in {{CO2}} concentration is inevitably linked to [[ocean acidification]], consistent with the preferential extinction of heavily calcified taxa and other signals in the rock record that suggest a more [[acid]]ic ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.0914065107| pmid = 20421502| year = 2010| last1 = Payne | first1 = J.| last2 = Turchyn | first2 = A.| last3 = Paytan | first3 = A.| last4 = Depaolo | first4 = D.| last5 = Lehrmann | first5 = D.| last6 = Yu | first6 = M.| last7 = Wei | first7 = J.| title = Calcium isotope constraints on the end-Permian mass extinction| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America| volume = 107| pages = 8543–8548| issue = 19| pmc = 2889361|bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.8543P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decrease in ocean pH is calculated to be up to 0.7 units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clarkson |first= M. |last2= Kasemann |first2= S. |last3= Wood |first3= R. |last4= Lenton |first4= T. |last5= Daines |first5= S. |last6= Richoz |first6= S. |last7= Ohnemueller |first7= F. |last8= Meixner |first8= A. |last9= Poulton |first9= S. |last10= Tipper |first10=E. |date=2015-04-10 |title=Ocean acidification and the Permo-Triassic mass extinction |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6231/229 |journal=Science |volume=348 |issue=6231 |pages=229–232 |doi= 10.1126/science.aaa0193 |access-date=2016-10-24 |pmid=25859043|bibcode=2015Sci...348..229C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to analyze extinction and survival rates of land organisms in detail, because few terrestrial fossil beds span the Permian–Triassic boundary. Triassic insects are very different from those of the Permian, but a gap in the insect fossil record spans approximately 15 million years from the late Permian to early Triassic. The best-known record of [[vertebrate]] changes across the Permian–Triassic boundary occurs in the [[Karoo Supergroup]] of [[South Africa]], but statistical analyses have so far not produced clear conclusions.&lt;ref name="KNollBambach2007Paleophysiology" /&gt; However, analysis of the fossil river deposits of the floodplains indicate a shift from [[meander]]ing to [[braided river]] patterns, indicating an abrupt drying of the climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=R.M.H.|title=Changing fluvial environments across the Permian-Triassic boundary in the Karoo Basin, South Africa and possible causes of tetrapod extinctions|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|date=16 November 1999|volume=117|issue=1–2|pages=81–104|doi=10.1016/0031-0182(94)00119-S|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/003101829400119S|accessdate=21 February 2012|bibcode=1995PPP...117...81S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The climate change may have taken as little as 100,000 years, prompting the extinction of the unique ''[[Glossopteris]]'' flora and its herbivores, followed by the carnivorous [[guild (ecology)|guild]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chinsamy-Turan|editor=Anusuya|title=Forerunners of mammals : radiation, histology, biology|year=2012|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=978-0-253-35697-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; End-Permian extinctions did not occur at an instantaneous time horizon; particularly, floral extinction was delayed in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Environmental mutagenesis during the end-Permian ecological crisis|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/101/35/12952|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date = 2004-08-31|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 516500|pmid = 15282373|pages = 12952–12956|volume = 101|issue = 35|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0404472101|first = Henk|last = Visscher|first2 = Cindy V.|last2 = Looy|first3 = Margaret E.|last3 = Collinson|first4 = Henk|last4 = Brinkhuis|first5 = Johanna H.

== Biotic recovery ==
Earlier analyses indicated that life on Earth recovered quickly after the Permian extinctions, but this was mostly in the form of [[pioneer organism|disaster taxa]], opportunist organisms such as the hardy ''[[Lystrosaurus]]''. Research published in 2006 indicates that the specialized animals that formed complex ecosystems, with high biodiversity, complex [[food web]]s and a variety of [[Niche segregation|niches]], took much longer to recover. It is thought that this long recovery was due to the successive waves of extinction, which inhibited recovery, and prolonged environmental stress to organisms, which continued into the Early Triassic. Research indicates that recovery did not begin until the start of the mid-Triassic, 4 to 6 million years after the extinction;&lt;ref name="LehrmannRamezanBowring2006TimingOfRecovery"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Timing of recovery from the end-Permian extinction: Geochronologic and biostratigraphic constraints from south China |journal=Geology |date=December 2006 |volume=34 |url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/34/12/1053 |pages=1053–1056 |doi=10.1130/G22827A.1 | issue=12 |first=Daniel J. |last=Lehrmann |first2=Jahandar |last2=Ramezani |first3=Samuel A. |last3=Bowring |first4=Mark W. |last4=Martin |first5=Paul |last5=Montgomery |first6=Paul |last6=Enos |first7=Jonathan L. |last7=Payne |first8=Michael J. |last8=Orchard |author9=Wang Hongmei |author10=Wei Jiayong |bibcode = 2006Geo....34.1053L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some writers estimate that the recovery was not complete until {{val|30|u=Ma}} after the P–Tr extinction, i.e. in the [[late Triassic]].&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction" /&gt;

[[File:Waimakariri01 gobeirne.jpg|thumb|right| A [[braided river]], the [[Waimakariri River]] on the [[South Island]] of [[New Zealand]]]]
During the early Triassic (4 to 6 million years after the P–Tr extinction), the plant [[biomass]] was insufficient to form [[coal]] deposits, which implies a limited food mass for herbivores.&lt;ref name="Retallack1996" /&gt; River patterns in the [[Karoo]] changed from [[Meandering river|meandering]] to [[Braided river|braided]], indicating that vegetation there was very sparse for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ward PD, Montgomery DR, Smith R |year=2000|title=Altered river morphology in South Africa related to the Permian–Triassic extinction|journal=Science|volume=289|issue=5485|pages=1740–1743 |doi=10.1126/science.289.5485.1740|pmid=10976065

Each major segment of the early Triassic ecosystem—plant and animal, marine and terrestrial—was dominated by a small number of [[genus|genera]], which appeared virtually worldwide, for example: the herbivorous [[therapsid]] ''[[Lystrosaurus]]'' (which accounted for about 90% of early Triassic land vertebrates) and the [[bivalve]]s ''[[Claraia]]'', ''Eumorphotis'', ''Unionites'' and ''Promylina''.

Disaster taxa took advantage of the devastated [[ecosystem]]s and enjoyed a temporary population boom and increase in their territory.

=== Changes in marine ecosystems ===
[[File:Crinoïde Carbonifère 8127.jpg| thumb | left | Sessile filter feeders like this [[Carboniferous]] [[crinoid]], the mushroom crinoid (''[[Agaricocrinus americanus]]''), were significantly less abundant after the P–Tr extinction.]]
Prior to the extinction, about two-thirds of marine animals were [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] and attached to the sea floor. During the Mesozoic, only about half of the marine animals were sessile while the rest were free-living. Analysis of marine fossils from the period indicated a decrease in the abundance of sessile [[epifauna]]l [[suspension feeder]]s such as [[brachiopod]]s and [[sea lily|sea lilies]] and an increase in more complex mobile species such as [[snail]]s, [[sea urchins]] and [[crab]]s.&lt;ref name="WagnerKosnikLidgard2006" /&gt;

Before the Permian mass extinction event, both complex and simple marine ecosystems were equally common; after the recovery from the mass extinction, the complex communities outnumbered the simple communities by nearly three to one,&lt;ref name="WagnerKosnikLidgard2006"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Abundance Distributions Imply Elevated Complexity of Post-Paleozoic Marine Ecosystems|vauthors=Wagner PJ, Kosnik MA, Lidgard S |journal=Science|year=2006|volume=314|issue=5803|pages=1289–1292|doi=10.1126/science.1133795|pmid=17124319
|bibcode = 2006Sci...314.1289W }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the increase in predation pressure led to the [[Mesozoic Marine Revolution]].

[[Bivalves]] were fairly rare before the P–Tr extinction but became numerous and diverse in the Triassic, and one group, the [[rudist]] clams, became the [[Mesozoic]]'s main reef-builders. Some researchers think much of this change happened in the 5 million years between the two major extinction pulses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2006AM/finalprogram/abstract_111312.htm|author=Clapham, M.E., Bottjer, D.J. and Shen, S. |year=2006|title=Decoupled diversity and ecology during the end-Guadalupian extinction (late Permian)|journal=Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs|volume=38|issue=7|accessdate=2008-03-28|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Archosaurs]] (which included the ancestors of dinosaurs and [[crocodilia]]ns) were initially rarer than therapsids, but they began to displace [[therapsid]]s in the mid-Triassic.

Land vertebrates took an unusually long time to recover from the P–Tr extinction; Palaeontologist [[Michael Benton]] estimated the recovery was not complete until {{val|30|u=million years}} after the extinction, i.e. not until the Late Triassic, in which dinosaurs, [[pterosaurs]], crocodiles, archosaurs, amphibians, and mammaliforms were abundant and diverse.&lt;ref name="Benton" /&gt;

== Causes ==
Pinpointing the exact cause or causes of the Permian–Triassic extinction event is difficult, mostly because the catastrophe occurred over 250&amp;nbsp;million years ago, and since then much of the evidence that would have pointed to the cause has been destroyed or is concealed deep within the Earth under many layers of rock. The [[sea floor]] is also completely recycled every 200&amp;nbsp;million years by the ongoing process of [[plate tectonics]] and [[seafloor spreading]], leaving no useful indications beneath the ocean.

Scientists have accumulated a fairly significant amount of evidence for causes, and several mechanisms have been proposed for the extinction event. The proposals include both catastrophic and gradual processes (similar to those theorized for the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]]).
*The ''catastrophic'' group includes one or more large [[bolide]] [[impact event]]s, increased [[volcanoes|volcanism]], and sudden release of methane from the sea floor, either due to dissociation of [[methane hydrate]] deposits or metabolism of organic carbon deposits by [[methanogen]]ic microbes.
*The ''gradual'' group includes sea level change, increasing [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxia]], and increasing [[arid]]ity.

Any hypothesis about the cause must explain the selectivity of the event, which affected organisms with [[calcium carbonate]] skeletons most severely; the long period (4 to 6&amp;nbsp;million years) before recovery started, and the minimal extent of biological mineralization (despite [[Inorganic compound|inorganic]] carbonates being deposited) once the recovery began.&lt;ref name=Knoll2004 /&gt;

=== Impact event ===
[[File:Impact event.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Artist's impression of a major impact event: A collision between Earth and an [[asteroid]] a few kilometres in diameter would release as much energy as several million nuclear weapons detonating.]]
Evidence that an [[impact event]] may have caused the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] (Cretaceous–Tertiary) has led to speculation that similar impacts may have been the cause of other extinction events, including the P–Tr extinction, and thus to a search for evidence of impacts at the times of other extinctions and for large [[impact craters]] of the appropriate age.

An impact crater on the sea floor would be evidence of a possible cause of the P–Tr extinction, but such a crater would by now have disappeared. As 70% of the Earth's surface is currently sea, an [[asteroid]] or [[comet]] fragment is now perhaps more than twice as likely to hit ocean as it is to hit land. However, Earth's oldest ocean-floor crust is 200 million years old because it is continually destroyed and renewed by spreading and [[subduction]]. Thus, craters produced by very large impacts may be masked by extensive [[flood basalt]]ing from below after the crust is punctured or weakened.&lt;ref name="Jones_etal_2002"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones AP, Price GD, Price NJ, DeCarli PS, Clegg RA | title=Impact induced melting and the development of large igneous provinces | journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters | volume=202 | issue=3 | year=2002 | pages=551–561 |doi=10.1016/S0012-821X(02)00824-5 | bibcode=2002E&amp;PSL.202..551J

The Emeishan and Siberian Traps eruptions may have caused dust clouds and acid [[aerosols]], which would have blocked out sunlight and thus disrupted photosynthesis both on land and in the [[photic zone]] of the ocean, causing food chains to collapse. The eruptions may also have caused acid rain when the aerosols washed out of the atmosphere. That may have killed land plants and [[mollusc]]s and [[plankton]]ic organisms which had [[calcium carbonate]] shells. The eruptions would also have emitted [[carbon dioxide]], causing [[global warming]]. When all of the dust clouds and aerosols washed out of the atmosphere, the excess carbon dioxide would have remained and the warming would have proceeded without any mitigating effects.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;

The Siberian Traps had unusual features that made them even more dangerous. Pure flood basalts produce fluid, low-viscosity lava and do not hurl debris into the atmosphere. It appears, however, that 20% of the output of the Siberian Traps eruptions was [[pyroclastic]] (consisted of ash and other debris thrown high into the atmosphere), increasing the short-term cooling effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoopermuseum.earthsci.carleton.ca/pt_boundary/Causes/volcanics.html|title=Volcanism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basalt lava erupted or intruded into [[carbonate]] rocks and into sediments that were in the process of forming large coal beds, both of which would have emitted large amounts of carbon dioxide, leading to stronger global warming after the dust and [[aerosol]]s settled.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;

In January 2011, a team, led by Stephen Grasby of the Geological Survey of Canada—Calgary, reported evidence that volcanism caused massive coal beds to ignite, possibly releasing more than 3 trillion tons of carbon. The team found ash deposits in deep rock layers near what is now [[Buchanan Lake (Nunavut)|Buchanan Lake]]. According to their article, "coal ash dispersed by the explosive Siberian Trap eruption would be expected to have an associated release of toxic elements in impacted water bodies where fly ash slurries developed....

However, the pattern of isotope shifts expected to result from a massive release of methane does not match the patterns seen throughout the early Triassic.

Biomarkers for green sulfur bacteria, such as isorenieratane, the [[Diagenesis|diagenetic]] product of [[isorenieratene]], are widely used as indicators of [[photic zone]] euxinia because green sulfur [[bacteria]] require both sunlight and hydrogen sulfide to survive. Their abundance in sediments from the P-T boundary indicates hydrogen sulfide was present even in shallow waters.

This spread of toxic, oxygen-depleted water would have been devastating for marine life, producing widespread die-offs. Models of ocean chemistry show that anoxia and euxinia would have been closely associated with [[hypercapnia]] (high levels of carbon dioxide).&lt;ref name=Meyers2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyers|first=Katja |author2=L.R. Kump |author3=A. Ridgwell|title=Biogeochemical controls on photic-zone euxinia during the end-Permian mass extinction|journal=Geology|date=September 2008|volume=36|issue=9|pages=747–750|doi=10.1130/g24618a.1|bibcode=2008Geo....36..747M}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This suggests that poisoning from [[hydrogen sulfide]], anoxia, and hypercapnia acted together as a killing mechanism. Hypercapnia best explains the selectivity of the extinction, but anoxia and euxinia probably contributed to the high mortality of the event. The persistence of anoxia through the Early Triassic may explain the slow recovery of marine life after the extinction. Models also show that anoxic events can cause catastrophic hydrogen sulfide emissions into the atmosphere (see below).&lt;ref name=Kump2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kump|first=Lee |author2=Alexander Pavlov |author3=Michael A. Arthur|title=Massive release of hydrogen sulfide to the surface ocean and atmosphere during intervals of oceanic anoxia|journal=Geology|year=2005|volume=33|issue=5 |pages=397–400|doi=10.1130/G21295.1|bibcode=2005Geo....33..397K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequence of events leading to anoxic oceans may have been triggered by carbon dioxide emissions from the eruption of the [[Siberian Traps]].&lt;ref name=Kump2005 /&gt; In that scenario, warming from the enhanced greenhouse effect would reduce the solubility of oxygen in seawater, causing the concentration of oxygen to decline. Increased weathering of the continents due to warming and the acceleration of the [[water cycle]] would increase the riverine flux of [[phosphate]] to the ocean. The phosphate would have supported greater primary productivity in the surface oceans. The increase in organic matter production would have caused more organic matter to sink into the deep ocean, where its respiration would further decrease oxygen concentrations. Once anoxia became established, it would have been sustained by a [[Positive feedback|positive feedback loop]] because deep water anoxia tends to increase the recycling efficiency of phosphate, leading to even higher productivity.

=== Hydrogen sulfide emissions ===
A severe [[anoxic event]] at the end of the Permian would have allowed [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]] to thrive, causing the production of large amounts of hydrogen sulfide in the anoxic ocean. Upwelling of this water may have released massive [[hydrogen sulfide]] emissions into the atmosphere and would poison terrestrial plants and animals and severely weaken the [[ozone layer]], exposing much of the life that remained to fatal levels of [[UV radiation]].&lt;ref name=Kump2005 /&gt;
Indeed, [[Biosignature|biomarker]] evidence for anaerobic photosynthesis by [[Chlorobiaceae]] (green sulfur bacteria) from the Late-Permian into the Early Triassic indicates that hydrogen sulfide did upwell into shallow waters because these bacteria are restricted to the photic zone and use sulfide as an [[electron donor]].

The hypothesis has the advantage of explaining the mass extinction of plants, which would have added to the methane levels and should otherwise have thrived in an atmosphere with a high level of carbon dioxide. Fossil spores from the end-Permian further support the theory:{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} many show deformities that could have been caused by [[ultraviolet radiation]], which would have been more intense after hydrogen sulfide emissions weakened the ozone layer.

=== The supercontinent Pangaea ===
[[File:Pangaea continents.png| thumb | right | Map of [[Pangaea]] showing where today's continents were at the Permian–Triassic boundary]]

In the mid-Permian (during the [[Kungurian]] age of the Permian's [[Cisuralian]] [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]]), the earth’s major continental plates were joined, forming a [[supercontinent]] called [[Pangaea]], which was surrounded by the [[superocean]], [[Panthalassa]].

Oceanic circulation and atmospheric weather patterns during the mid-Permian produced seasonal [[monsoon]]s near the coasts and an arid climate in the vast continental interior of Pangaea.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The extent of biologically diverse and ecologically productive coastal areas shrank as the supercontinent formed. The elimination of shallow aquatic environments exposed formerly protected organisms of the rich continental shelves to increased environmental volatility.

After the formation of Pangaea (see the diagram "Marine genus biodiversity" at the top of this article), the rate of marine life depletion approached catastrophic levels; however, marine life extinction never reached the rate of the [[Extinction event#Major extinction events|"Big Five" mass extinctions]].{{Clarify|date=August 2018}}

Pangaea’s effect on extinctions on land is thought to have been less significant. In fact, the advance of the [[therapsids]] and increase in their diversity is attributed to the late Permian, when Pangaea’s global effect was thought to have peaked.

While Pangaea’s formation is known to have initiated a long period of marine life extinction, the significance of its impact on the "Great Dying" and the end of the Permian is uncertain.

=== Microbes ===
A hypothesis published in 2014 posits that a genus of [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] [[methanogen]]ic [[archaea]] known as ''[[Methanosarcina]]'' was responsible for the event.&lt;ref name=Rothman2014 /&gt; Three lines of evidence suggest that these microbes acquired a new metabolic pathway via [[gene transfer]] at about that time, enabling them to efficiently metabolize acetate into methane. That would have led to their exponential reproduction, allowing them to rapidly consume vast deposits of organic carbon that had accumulated in the marine sediment. The result would have been a sharp buildup of methane and carbon dioxide in the Earth's oceans and atmosphere, in a manner that may be consistent with the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C isotopic record. Massive volcanism facilitated this process by releasing large amounts of nickel, a scarce metal which is a cofactor for enzymes involved in producing methane.&lt;ref name="Rothman2014"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1318106111| title = Methanogenic burst in the end-Permian carbon cycle| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| date = 2014-03-31| last1 = Rothman | first1 = D.

=== Combination of causes ===
Possible causes supported by strong evidence appear to describe a sequence of catastrophes, each worse than the last: the Siberian Traps eruptions were bad enough alone, but because they occurred near coal beds and the continental shelf, they also triggered very large releases of carbon dioxide and methane.&lt;ref name="KNollBambach2007Paleophysiology" /&gt; The resultant global warming may have caused perhaps the most severe anoxic event in the oceans' history: according to this theory, the oceans became so anoxic, anaerobic sulfur-reducing organisms dominated the chemistry of the oceans and caused massive emissions of toxic hydrogen sulfide.&lt;ref name="KNollBambach2007Paleophysiology" /&gt;

However, there may be some weak links in this chain of events: the changes in the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C ratio expected to result from a massive release of methane do not match the patterns seen throughout the early Triassic;&lt;ref name="Payne2004" /&gt; and the types of oceanic [[thermohaline circulation]] that may have existed at the end of the Permian are not likely to have supported deep-sea anoxia.&lt;ref name="ZhangEtAl2001"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Zhang R, Follows, MJ, Grotzinger, JP, &amp; Marshall J| title =Could the Late Permian deep ocean have been anoxic?| journal =Paleoceanography| volume =16| issue =3| pages =317–329|year=2001| doi = 10.1029/2000PA000522 | url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2001/2000PA000522.shtml| bibcode=2001PalOc..16..317Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The native inhabitants of the Central Highlands are the [[Degar]] (Montagnard) peoples. The Vietnamese conquered the Central Highlands during their "march to the south" ([[Nam tiến]]). Ethnic [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese (Kinh) people]] now outnumber the indigenous Degars (considered derogatory term) after state-sponsored colonization directed by both the government of [[South Vietnam]] and the current Communist government of unified [[Vietnam]]. The Montagnards have engaged in conflicts with the Vietnamese, from the anti-Communist South Vietnamese government, the [[Viet Cong]], to the Communist government of unified Vietnam{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. There are contrasting views on this issue, as the constitution of the government of [[Vietnam]] states "Article 36 of the Constitution, the state invests heavily in education and supports various preferential programmes for ethnic minorities, like ethnic minority boarding schools, lower entry requirements and quota for minorities."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137455536_12|title=Language, Education and Nation-building|last=Le Ha|first=Phan|last2=Ha|first2=Vu Hai|last3=Dat|first3=Bao|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=9781349546336|location=London|pages=232–244|language=en|doi=10.1057/9781137455536_12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="refworld.org"&gt;http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/3c6a48474.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Both the initial 1945 constitute and the revised 1992 constitution of [[North Vietnam]] and the successor state [[Vietnam|the Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] stated that all minority groups in Vietnam have the right to maintain their mother tongues in their schooling as well as to use their languages to preserve their ethnic cultures and values.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Up until French rule, the Central Highlands was alleged by one American source as almost never entered by the Vietnamese since they viewed it as a savage (Moi-Montaganrd) populated area with fierce animals like tigers, "poisoned water" and "evil malevolent spirits", but the Vietnamese expressed interest in the land after the French transformed it into a profitable plantation area to grow crops on,&lt;ref name="M.D.2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence H.

In 1955, Northern Vietnamese migrants were settled in the Central Highlands after the autonomous Montagnard area was abolished by [[Ngô Đình Diệm]]. [[Y Bham Enuol]] founded [[Bajaraka]] on January 5, 1958 to resist the discrimination, Vietnamese settlement on Highlands and forced assimilation by the South Vietnamese government. The United Nations Secretary-General and foreign embassies were contacted by Y Bham Enuol. "Front for the Liberation of the Highlands of Champa" (Mặt Trận Giải Phóng Cao Nguyên Champa) and Bajaraka were both headed by Y Bham Enuol.

[[Les Kosem]], Y Bham Enuol and Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]] worked together to found [[FULRO]] and launch an uprising against the South Vietnamese government to regain their land from the Vietnamese colonizers.

The Montagnard inhabited Central Highlands became open to the Vietnamese only under French rule{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. The word savage (moi) was used by the Vietnamese against the Montagnard Degars.

The Montagnards in FULRO fought the Vietnamese for twenty years after the end of the Vietnam War and the scale of Vietnamese attacks on the Montagnards are alleged by one US author as having killed over 200,000 Montagnards after 1975 during the war between FULRO and Vietnam in the Central Highlands, as the Vietnamese lease land for Japanese companies to harvest lumber in the area. Munitions, weapons, and 5,000 rifles were given by the Chinese to some Montagnard groups after some Montagnards requested help from China via Thai General Savit-Yun K-Yut since the United States refused to help the FULRO Montagnards against the Vietnamese.&lt;ref name="Dooley2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Dooley|title=Battle for the Central Highlands: A Special Forces Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xAKbllE5bioC&amp;pg=PA255#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=18 December 2007|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-41463-2|pages=255–}}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures have not been validated by independent sources or third parties, however.

The South Vietnamese and Communist Vietnamese colonization of the Central Highlands has been compared to the historic Nam tiến of previous Vietnamese rulers. During the Nam tiến (March to the South) Khmer and Cham territory was seized and militarily colonized ([[Tuntian|đồn điền]]) by the Vietnamese which was repeated by the state-sponsored colonization of Northern Vietnamese Catholic refugees on Montagnard land by the South Vietnamese leader Diem and the introduction to the Central Highlands of "New Economic Zones" by the now Communist Vietnamese government.&lt;ref name="Salemink2003" /&gt; The thousand year violent war the Vietnamese in the lowlands had with the Montagnards in the mountains was a long-established custom and the Vietnamese used the derogatory word "Moi" (savages) to address the Montagnards, the South Vietnamese government was strongly against the autonomous Montagnard CIDG (Civilian Irregular Defense Groups) who were fighting against the Vietcong because they feared that the Montagnards would gain independence so the South Vietnamese and Montagnards violently clashed against each other{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}.

A colonization program of Kinh Vietnamese by the South Vietnamese government and united Vietnamese Communist government was implemented{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. Leaving out any plans for autonomy for ethnic minorities, an assimilation plan was launched by the South Vietnamese government with the creation of the "Social and Economic Council for the Southern Highlander Country", the South Vietnamese based their approach to the highlanders by claiming that they would be "developed" since they were "poor" and "ignorant", making swidden agriculturalists sedentarize and settling ethnic Vietnamese colonists from the coastal regions into the highlands such as Northern Vietnamese Catholic refugees who fled to South Vietnam, 50,000 Vietnamese settlers were in the highlands in 1960 and in 1963 the total number of settlers was 200,000 and up to 1974 the South Vietnamese were still implemented the colonization plan even though the highland natives experienced massive turbulence and disorder because of the colonization, and by 1971 less than half of a scheme back by the Americans to leave Montagnards with just 20% of the Central Highlands was completed, and even in the parts of the highlands which did not experience colonization, the South Vietnamese threw the native tribes into "strategic hamelets" to keep them away from places where communists potentially operated and the South Vietnamese consistently spurned any attempts too make overtures to the native Highlanders.&lt;ref name="Duncan2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher R.

===2001 mass protests===

After the Vietnamese government arrested Montagnards a demonstration was started in Chu Prong county by the Montagnards in the Central Highlands consisting of around 500 people in February 2001. Vietnam accused them of plotting for autonomy and accused them of trying to stir up ethnic animosity, and launched an anti-Highlander military operation. The traditional lands of the Central Highland had been taken by the Vietnamese and the Central Highland demonstrators had asked for it back. The Vietnamese government refused to return the lands and instead attacked the demonstrators, arresting hundreds and assaulting and pummeling the demonstrators{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. The Vietnamese military took charge of the Central Highlands, severing telephone lines and keeping heavy watch over travel within the area. The Bahnar, Rhade, and Raglai participated in the mass demonstrations against the Vietnamese{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. They carried no weapons while they started their mass protests. The natives regard the puppet leaders placed in their communities by the Vietnamese Communist government as collaborators who help persecute the natives for the Vietnamese{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. The tribal customs of the highlanders are ignored by the Vietnamese government which shows no regard for the traditional leaders of the Highlanders. The natives of the Central Highlands are mired in poverty and the Vietnamese are richer than them and are subjected to starvation. The Vietnamese government seized the land of the natives in the Central Highlands for Vietnamese settlers and coffee companies. They severely limited the amount of land farmed by the Highlanders and drove them away. Vietnamese colonizers also directly seize land from the natives in addition to the coffee companies{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}.  The policies of the Vietnamese government impede the natives while helping the Vietnamese colonizers. The lumber and coffee companies are assisted by the Vietnamese government. Vietnamese government workers embezzle and steal aid meant for the Central Highlanders. After these provocations, when Buon xer village was seized by Vietnamese colonizers, they were attacked by the Rhade when the straw finally broke the camel's back on August 8, 2000. The massive amount of Vietnamese colonizers and land theft was the impetus for the mass 2001 demonstrations against the Vietnamese{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. Rahlan Djan and Rahlan Pon were the two Montagnards who were abused and arrested by the Vietnamese and ex-FULRO member Ksor Kok helped bring attention to their plight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chamtoday.com/index.php/history-l-ch-s/77-the-uprising-of-the-central-highlanders-in-february-2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316040520/http://www.chamtoday.com/index.php/history-l-ch-s/77-the-uprising-of-the-central-highlanders-in-february-2001|title=The Uprising of the Central Highlanders in February 2001 |author=Nguyen Van Huy (Ph.D.) |others= Translated by Sean Tu|website=Cham Today|publisher=IOC-Champa|access-date=|archivedate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chamtoday.com/index.php/ngonngu/77-the-uprising-of-the-central-highlanders-in-february-2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316035131/http://chamtoday.com/index.php/ngonngu/77-the-uprising-of-the-central-highlanders-in-february-2001 |title=The Uprising of the Central Highlanders in February 2001 |author=Nguyen Van Huy (Ph.D.) |others=Translated by Sean Tu|date= |website=Cham Today |publisher=IOC-Champa|access-date= |quote=|archivedate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jailed Montagnards had been subjected to torture by the Vietnamese government which caused the mass protests. There were 30 police officers wounded in Buon Ma Thuot in Daklak and Pleiku.

Access to the Central Highlands was cut off by the police. The Vietnamese government oppresses them because they want their native land rights{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. The 2001 mass protests led to an exodus to Cambodia of Montagnards escaping from the Vietnamese authorities.

Electric batons and tear gas were deployed by the Vietnamese against a communal prayer by the Montagnards. Like the 2001 mass demonstrations, Buon Ma Thuot was once again the scene of a huge gathering of Montagnards demanding that their traditional Daklak lands be given back and religious freedom allowed.

Religious freedom is officially allowed in article 70 of the constitution of Vietnam, but the Vietnamese government ignores this and kill, jails, and abuses Degars because of their religion after 1975 when the Central Highlands was occupied by North Vietnamese.

The de-listing of Vietnam by the US State Department was criticized by the Montagnards due to Vietnam's continued arrests and abuse of Montagnards due to religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.degarfoundation.org/vietnamese-authorities-continue-interrogating-and-threatening-so-called-illegal-christians/HRUE-DƯM...09-03-2012/MRO=823|archiveurl=http://www.degarfoundation.org/vietnamese-authorities-continue-interrogating-and-threatening-so-called-illegal-christians/HRUE-D%C6%AFM...09-03-2012/MRO=823|title=Vietnamese Authorities Continue Interrogating And Threatening So Called "ILLEGAL" Christians|author=MFIpr|date=9 March 2012|website=DEGAR FOUNDATION, INC. |publisher=|access-date=|archivedate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Degars experienced hardship, tribulation and adversity during the Indochina Wars and have continued to suffer from Vietnamese oppression while the beneficiaries have been the Vietnamese. The Vietnamese has sterilized Degar women, and murdered and jailed Degar men to wipe out the Degars for the purpose of seizing their land and the Vietnamese despise the Degar way of life due to ethnic hatred by the Vietnamese against the Degar which led to ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.degarfoundation.org/kok-ksors-statement-to-cerd-80th-session/HRUE-DƯM...21-02-2012/MRO=718|archiveurl=http://www.degarfoundation.org/kok-ksors-statement-to-cerd-80th-session/HRUE-D%C6%AFM...21-02-2012/MRO=718|title=Kok Ksor's Statement to CERD 80th Session|author=Mr. Kok Ksor|date=21 February 2012|website=DEGAR FOUNDATION, INC.|publisher=|access-date=|archivedate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnamese police assaulted and brutalized the Montagnard Foundation President Kok Ksor's mother, Ksor H'Ble, especially following the Degar February 2001 demonstrations over land and religion and the April 2004 demonstrations. The Vietnamese police bullied and assaulted her for years. She died on 18 August 2011.

Degars were violently assaulted and brutalized by racist ordinary Vietnamese citizens on 27 September 2007. Degars were targeted for murder by Vietnamese citizens on 5 October 2007. In the Central Highlands there is severe ethnic bigotry towards the native Degars by the Vietnamese. Degars are subject to bigotry and hatred both by ordinary Vietnamese and the government of Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Persecution of Degar Montagnards Continues|last=Reynalds|first=Jeremy|date=October 15, 2007|url=https://www.worthynews.com/1499-persecution-of-degar-montagnards-continues|newspaper=Worthy News|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic minority lands are subjected to settlement and colonization by ethnic Vietnamese Kinh supported by the Vietnamese government, as the native populations are driven out and their lands stolen in addition to their bad economic situation. Violence and jail sentences are used against ethnic minorities like Khmer Krom and the most racism is perpetrated against the Hmong and Montagnards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=|first=|date=20 February 2012 |title=Vietnam religious minorities face persecution says activist|url=http://www.expatica.com/ch/news/swiss-news/vietnam-religious-minorities-face-persecution-says-activist_209627.html|newspaper=Expatica|location=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/ch/news/Vietnam-religious-minorities-face-persecution-says-activist_320583.html Vietnam religious minorities face persecution says activist | News | Expatica Switzerland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Demanding that the Vietnamese regime stop repressing ethnic minorities and religion, the "Coalition for Indigenous Peoples in Vietnam" was formed out of the Thai, Khmer Krom, and Montagnards after they combined forces against the Vietnamese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Degar-Montagnards: Vietnamese Minority Groups Unite|url=http://www.unpo.org/article/14284|author=Voice of America |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=May 15, 2012 |website=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization: UNPO |publisher=Voice of America |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnamese brutally suppressed, imprisoned and tortured Montagnards after the Montagnards asked for their lands back during protests in Gia Lai province in 2012 so 85 of the Montagnards were forced to escape from the Vietnamese by going to Rattanakiri province in Cambodia. The religion and ethnicity of the Montagnards is distinct from the Vietnamese. Prospect of a new insurgency by Montagnards for independence were shot down by the Hun Sen regime in Cambodia which refused to aid them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unpo.org/article/15157 |title=Degar-Montagnards: Refugees In Cambodia’s Jungles |author=Voice of America|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 20, 2012 |website=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization: UNPO |publisher=Voice of America |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trouble and chaos in the Central Highlands after the Vietnamese abused and jailed Montagnard leader Y'Soai Eban he managed to run away from Vietnamese custody. The Montagnards were subjected to genocide after the Vietnam War in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unpo.org/article/15451 |title=Degar-Montagnards: Father Reunited With His Family After 6 Years |author=Wral.com|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=February 4, 2013 |website=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization: UNPO |publisher=Wral.com |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independence from the Communist authorities was desired by the Montagnards after the Vietnam War since they were killed, abused, discriminated against and jailed by the Vietnamese authorities so many of them were forced to run away from the Central Highlands as refugees. Cambodia and eventually the United States were their destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unpo.org/article/16663 |title=Degar-Montagnards: 11 Christian Vietnamese And Cambodian Refugees Ordained |author=Biblical Recorder|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=December 4, 2013 |website=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization: UNPO |publisher=Biblical Recorder |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death, torture, and incarceration were the punishments inflicted on Montagnards gathering in groups of three or more by the Vietnamese with their religion severely persecuted and repressed at the hands of the Vietnamese Communist regime since 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unpo.org/article/9642|title=Montagnard: Government Destroys First Christian Degar Church|author=Montagnard Foundation|date=May 28, 2009|website=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization: UNPO |publisher=Montagnard Foundation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States State Department showed little concern at the plight of the Montagnards at the hands of the Vietnamese. A thirteen-year-old Montagnard girl Y Kang was severely assaulted, beaten and kicked along with 16 Montagnard women and men by Vietnamese police in Gai Lai province, Plei Ku city, district Mang Yang, commune H'ra in Buon Kret Krot village on July 7, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Degar Montagnard: Beaten for Worshiping in Church.|url=http://www.unpo.org/article/13058|author=Charisma Magazine|date=August 19, 2011|website=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization: UNPO|publisher=Charisma Magazine|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vietnam has jailed hundreds of Montagnards in addition to murdering, abusing, and discriminating against their religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unpo.org/article/11735|title=Degar Montagnard: Foundation Announces Establishment Of "Sang Ae Die Degar" Christian Church In Vietnam|author=Montagnard Foundation|date=October 1, 2010|website=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization: UNPO|publisher=Montagnard Foundation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death was a possible consequence of getting caught with a Bible. The Vietnamese regime claims that Montagnard separatism is conducted by religious matters and uses this as a reason to attack their religion. Montagnard land was seized by the Vietnamese government after the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-1492-i-dont-know-my-age-5-things-i-learned-in-my-isolated-tribe.html|title=I Don't Know My Age: 5 Things I Learned in My Isolated Tribe|last1=Evans|first1=Robert|last2=Enuol|first2=Rich|date= November 16, 2014|website=Cracked.com|publisher=Cracked.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gia Lai province, Chu Prong district in 2010 Montagnards were assaulted and detained by the Vietnamese. Parts of Vietnam like the Central Highlands are off limit to human rights organizations and reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author= |author-link= |authors= |date=March 2011 |title=Montagnard Christians in Vietnam A Case Study in Religious Repression |url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4d95751d2.pdf |publisher=Human Rights Watch |page= |docket= |access-date= |isbn=1-56432-755-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26868">'''POLST''' ('''Provider Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment''') is an approach to improving [[end-of-life care]] in the United States, encouraging providers to speak with patients and create specific medical orders to be honored by health care workers during a medical crisis.&lt;ref name=Meier&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meier|first=D|author2=Beresford L|title=POLST Offers Next Stage in Honoring Patient Preferences|journal=Journal of Palliative Medicine|year=2009|volume=12|issue=4|pages=291–295|pmid=19327064|doi=10.1089/jpm.2009.9648}}&lt;/ref&gt; POLST began in Oregon in 1991 and currently exists at some level in 42 states and meets the national POLST standard in 18 states. The POLST document is a standardized, portable, brightly colored single page medical order that documents a conversation between a provider and a  patient with a serious illness or frailty towards the end of life. A POLST form allows emergency medical services to provide treatment a patient wants before possibly transporting a patient to an emergency facility.

It is a medical order; the POLST form is always signed by a medical professional and, depending upon the state, the patient. A pragmatic rule for initiating a POLST can be if the clinician would not be surprised if the patient were to die within one year.&lt;ref name="AARP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sabatino|first=C|title=Improving Advanced Illness Care: The Evolution of State POLST Programs|publisher=AARP Public Policy Institute|author2=Naomi Karp}}&lt;/ref&gt; One difference between a POLST form and an [[advance directive]] is that the POLST form is designed to be actionable throughout an entire community.

== What is POLST? ==

POLST represents a significant paradigm change in advance care policy by standardizing provider communications through a plan of care in a portable way, rather than focusing solely on standardizing patients' communications via advance directives.&lt;ref name=AARP /&gt;

The POLST paradigm requires providers and patients or their surrogates to 
accomplish three core tasks:

*First, POLST begins with a conversation between a health care professional and the patient (or the patient's authorized surrogate) about treatment options in light of the patient's current condition.&lt;ref name=AARP /&gt;
*Second, the patient's preferences for treatments are incorporated into medical orders, which are recorded on a highly visible, standardized form that is kept at the front of the medical record or with the patient if the patient lives in the community.&lt;ref name=AARP /&gt;

:POLST forms record several treatment decisions common to seriously ill patients, for example: [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]]; the level of medical intervention desired in the event of an emergency (comfort only, limited treatment, or full treatment); and the use of [[Feeding tube|artificial nutrition]] and hydration. As technology and treatment options change, POLST forms will also continue to evolve.&lt;ref name=AARP /&gt;

*Third, providers encourage that the POLST form travels with the individual whenever he or she moves from one setting to another, thereby promoting the continuity of care throughout a community.&lt;ref name=AARP /&gt;

:The POLST form is designed to transfer across treatment settings, so it is readily available to medical personal, including EMTs, emergency physicians and nursing staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hickman|first=S|author2=Sabatino CP |author3=Moss AH |author4=Nester JW |title=The POLST (Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment) Paradigm to Improve End-of-Life Care: Potential State Legal Barriers to Implementation|journal=Journal Law Medical Ethics|year=2008|volume=36|pages=119–140|pmid=18315766|doi=10.1111/j.1748-720X.2008.00242.x|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The POLST program relies upon teamwork and coordinated systems to ensure preferences are honored throughout the health care system. Research suggests the POLST form accurately represents patient treatment preferences the majority of the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hickman|first=S.E.|author2=Tolle SW |author3=Brummel-Smith K |author4=Carley MM |title=Use of the Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment  Program in Oregon Nursing Facilities: Beyond Resuscitation Status,|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|date=September 2004|volume=52|issue=9|pages=1424–1429|pmid=15341541|doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2004.52402.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the treatments provided at the end of life match the orders on the form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=T|author2=Hickman SE |author3=Tolle SW |author4=Brooks HS |title=The Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment Program: Oregon Emergency Medical Technicians Practical Experiences and Attitudes|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|date=September 2009|volume=52|issue=9|pages=1430–4|pmid=15341542|doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2004.52403.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; An established POLST program can help reduce unwanted hospitalizations and honor the patient's end-of-life wishes.&lt;ref name=Meier /&gt;

To determine whether a POLST form should be completed, clinicians should ask themselves, "Would I be surprised if this person died in the next year?" If the answer is that the patient's prognosis is one year or less, then a POLST form is appropriate.&lt;ref name=Dunn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunn|first=Patrick|author2=Tolle S |author3=Moss A |author4=Black J |title=The Polst Paradigm: Respecting the Wishes of Patients and Families|journal=Annals of Long Term Care|year=2007|volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006 consensus report, the National Quality Form observed that "compared with other advance directive programs, POLST more accurately conveys end-of-life preferences and yields higher adherence by medical professionals." The National Quality Forum and other experts have recommended nationwide implementation of the POLST paradigm &lt;ref name=NQF&gt;{{cite book|last=National Quality Forum|title=A National framework and preferred practices  for palliative and hospice care quality|year=2006|location=Washington D.C.|url=http://www.nationalconcensusproject.org/Downloads.asp}}{{Dead link|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Implementation of POLST was also recently recommended by the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine in its report, "Dying in America: Improving Quality and Honoring Individual Preferences Near the End of Life."  The report was released September 17, 2014.

== Differences between an advance directive and a POLST Form ==

Unlike [[advance directives]], a POLST summarizes the patients' wishes in the form of medical orders.&lt;ref name=Frieden /&gt;  An advance directive is a legal document that allows you to share your wishes with your health care team if you can’t speak for yourself. It does so by designating a person you want your medical team to work with (also known as a “surrogate”). You cannot identify a surrogate using a POLST Form. To designate a health care surrogate, patients must use an advance directive.

An advance directive allows you to generally state what treatments you would or would not want in a medical crisis, but it is not a medical order. POLST provides explicit guidance to health professionals under predictable future circumstances based on your current medical condition.&lt;ref name=Meier /&gt; A POLST form turns treatment wishes outlined in an advance directive into medical orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bomba MD|first=P|author2=Kemp RN, M|author3=Black MD, J |title=POLST: An Improvement Over Traditional Advance Directives|journal=Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine|date=July 2012|volume=79|issue=7|pages=457–464|doi=10.3949/ccjm.79a.11098}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual does not need to have an advance directive to have a POLST form although health care professionals recommend that all competent adults have advance directives in place. If the individual lacks decisional capacity, a surrogate can engage in the conversation and the consent process that forms the basis of the POLST process.

The challenges that patients, their families and their healthcare professionals face in a medical emergency can be daunting. Caring and sensitive communication can elicit patients' wishes that can then be documented in an advance directive. To put these preferences into actionable orders requires an additional tool, the POLST form. Healthcare professionals and their organizations can overcome the myriad barriers to communication across systems of care by developing a POLST program, creating a method that respects some of the most deeply held values of patients.&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt;

== POLST research ==
Several studies have supported the use of POLST as a tool to ensure patient wishes are complied with:

:* In a 1998 study, charts of 180 residents at eight Oregon nursing facilities were evaluated over a one-year period. Where the POLST forms of residents included "do not resuscitate" and "comfort measures only" orders, none of the residents received unwanted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), intensive care, or ventilator support.&lt;ref name="Tolle"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolle|first=S|author2=Tilden VP |author3=Dunn P |author4=Nelson c |title=A Prospective Study of the Efficacy of the Physician Orders for Life  Sustaining Treatment|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|date=September 1998|volume=46|issue=9|pages=1097–1102|pmid=9736102|doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.1998.tb06647.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* In 2004, a survey of selected sites revealed that the POLST program was widely used in Oregon nursing facilities. Care matched POLST instructions to a high degree regarding CPR (91%), antibiotics (86%), intravenous fluids (84%), and feeding tubes (94%). Level-of-care instructions (from comfort care to full medical intervention) were followed less often (46%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hickman|first=S|author2=Tolle SW |author3=Brummel-Smith K |author4=Carley MM |title=Use of the Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment  Program in Oregon Nursing Facilities: Beyond Resuscitation Statu|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|date=September 2004|volume=52|issue=9|pages=1424–9|pmid=15341541|doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2004.52402.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* A 2004 survey of 572 EMTs in Oregon found that a large majority of EMTs felt that the POLST form provides clear instructions about patient preferences and is useful when deciding which treatments to provide.&lt;ref name="AARP" /&gt;
:* In 2009, researchers assessed the penetration of POLST in hospice programs in Oregon, Wisconsin, and West Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hickman|first=S|author2=Nelson CA |author3=Moss A |author4=Hammes BJ |author5=Terwilliger A |author6=Jackson A |author7=Tolle SW |title=Use of the Physician Orders  for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) Paradigm Program in the Hospice Setting|journal=Journal of Palliative Medicine|date=February 2009|volume=12|issue=2|pages=133–141|pmid=19207056|doi=10.1089/jpm.2008.0196|pmc=2966836}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A pilot study indicated that POLST was used widely in hospices in Oregon (100%) and West Virginia (85%) but only regionally in Wisconsin (6%). A majority of hospice staff believed POLST was useful in preventing unwanted resuscitation and initiating conversations about treatment preferences.&lt;ref name="AARP" /&gt;
:*In 2014, state death records containing cause and location of death were matched with POLST orders for people with a POLST form in the state registry. Conclusion: The association with numbers of deaths in the hospital suggests that end-of-life preferences of people who wish to avoid hospitalization as documented in POLST orders are honored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fromme|first=EK|author2=Zive D |author3=Schmidt TA |author4=Cook JNB |author5=Tolle SW |title=Association Between Physician Orders for Scope of Treatment and In-Hospital Death in Oregon|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|date=July 2014|volume=62|issue=7|pages=1246–51 |doi=10.1111/jgs.12889}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*In 2016, the study included comparison of two different state POLST programs having distinct demographics and different approaches to electronic registries. A key metric evaluated was the relationship of POLST medical intervention orders to in-hospital death, which was evaluated using POLST data linked with state death records. Conclusion: the study indicated similar patterns between the two states in which Comfort Only orders less often resulted in in-hospital deaths, compared to Full Treatment orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moss|first=AH|author2=Zive DM |author3=Falkensteine EC |author4=Fromme EK |title=Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment Medical Intervention Orders and In-Hospital Death Rates: Comparable Patterns in Two State Registries|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|date=June 2016|doi=10.1111/jgs.14273 |volume=64 |pages=1739–1741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--This section was commented out because it was considered inappropriate on the Talk Page. If this article is about a type of document or legal instrument, how do "future goals" apply? Commenting out was chosen rather than deleting because this section demonstrates the agenda of the original author to provide a non-neutral viewpoint in violation of Wikipedia standards.

== Future goals ==

Susan Tolle, M.D., and Patrick Dunn, M.D., are faculty at OHSU's Center for Ethics in Health Care, and provide support to those who wish to spread Oregon's POLST Paradigm to other states.

Core features of successful programs include the robust ongoing training and education of health professionals. Communication skills and a commitment to improving end-of-life care are needed to implement POLST in a patient-centered, meaningful way. Ongoing monitoring, quality improvement and further research is critical to expand and improve the POLST process.&lt;ref name=AARP /&gt; 
--&gt;

&lt;!--the references list needs to be amended to include more neutral, thorough sources. Most of the original 13 sources were either dead links or were overwhelmingly from the same authors--who were actually creators and lobbyists of the POLST movement. While they have some research, they are hardly neutral or comprehensive sources. --&gt;

In [[developmental biology]], an [[embryo]] is divided into two hemispheres: the '''animal pole''' and the '''vegetal pole''' within a [[blastula]].

The animal pole consists of small cells that divide rapidly, in contrast with the vegetal pole below it. In some cases, the animal pole is thought to differentiate into the later embryo itself, forming the three primary [[germ layers]] and participating in [[gastrulation]].

The vegetal pole contains large yolky cells that divide very slowly, in contrast with the animal pole above it. In some cases, the vegetal pole is thought to differentiate into the [[extraembryonic membranes]] that protect and nourish the developing embryo, such as the [[placenta]] in mammals and the [[chorion]] in birds.

In the frog ''[[Xenopus laevis]]'', a pigment pattern provides the [[oocyte]] with features of a radially symmetrical body with a distinct polarity. The animal hemisphere is dark brown, and the vegetal hemisphere is only weakly pigmented. The axis of symmetry passes through on one side the animal pole, and on the other side the vegetal pole. The two hemispheres are  separated by an unpigmented equatorial belt. Polarity has a major influence on the emergence of the embryonic structures. In fact, the axis polarity serves as one coordinate of geometrical system in which early [[embryogenesis]] is organized.&lt;ref&gt;P. Hausen, M. Riebesell: The Early Embryonic Development of Xenopus Laevis - An Atlas of the Histology {{ISBN|0387537406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming==
The animal pole draws its name from its liveliness relative to the slowly developing vegetal pole. Hence the vegetal pole is named for its relative inactivity relative to the animal pole.

'''''Prehistoric Predators''''' was a 2007 [[National Geographic Channel]] program based on different predators that lived in the past, including ''Smilodon'' and Megalodon. The series investigated how such beasts hunted and fought other creatures, and what drove them to extinction. The program's investigative style was somewhat followed by the recent Discovery Channel documentary, [[Monsters Resurrected]].

The '''pygidium''' (plural '''pygidia''') is the posterior body part or shield of [[crustacean]]s and some other [[arthropod]]s, such as [[insect]]s and the extinct [[trilobite]]s. It contains the [[anus]] and, in females, the [[ovipositor]]. It is composed of fused body segments, sometimes with a tail, and separated from [[Thorax|thoracic]] segments by an articulation.&lt;ref name="s"&gt;Shultz, J.W. (1990). Evolutionary Morphology And Phylogeny of Arachnida. Cladistics 6: 1-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[arachnid]]s, the pygidium is formed by reduction of the last three opisthosomal segments to rings where there is no distinction between tergites and sternites. A pygidium is present in [[Palpigradi]], [[Amblypygi]], [[Thelyphonida]], [[Schizomida]], [[Ricinulei]] and in the extinct order [[Trigonotarbida]]. It is also present in early fossil representatives of [[horseshoe crabs]].

In trilobites, the pygidium can range from extremely small (much smaller than the head, or [[cephalon (arthropod anatomy)|cephalon]]) to larger than the cephalon. They can be smooth, as in order [[Asaphida]], or spiny, as in order [[Lichida]]. They can be classified into four categories according to their relative size in comparison to the [[cephalon]].&lt;ref name="gon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trilobites.info/pygyterms.htm|title=The Pygidium  |author=Samuel M. Gon III|date=November 12, 2009|publisher=A Guide to the Orders of Trilobites |accessdate=April 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Micropygous''' - the pygidium is considerably smaller than the cephalon.
* '''Subisopygous''' - the pygidium is slightly smaller than the cephalon.
* '''Isopygous''' - the cephalon and the pygidium are more or less of equal size.
* '''Macropygous''' - the pygidium is larger than the cephalon.

They can further be subdivided in their morphological similarity to the [[thorax]]. Pygidia that are similar in shape and form to the thoracic segments are termed '''homonomous''', while pygidia that vary significantly from the shape and form of the thoracic segments (like by the presence or absence of spines) are '''heteronomous'''.

==Other uses==

''Pygidium'' is also a superseded [[genus]] of [[fish]] of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Trichomycteridae]]. Most species of this genus have been reassigned to the genus ''[[Trichomycterus]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49272">In [[biology]], '''quorum sensing''' is the ability to detect and to respond to cell [[population density]] by [[gene regulation]]. As one example, quorum sensing (QS) enables [[bacteria]] to restrict the expression of specific [[gene]]s to the high cell densities at which the resulting [[phenotype]]s will be most beneficial. Many species of [[bacteria]] use quorum sensing to coordinate [[gene expression]] according to the density of their local population. In similar fashion, some [[social insects]] use quorum sensing to determine where to nest.

In addition to its function in biological systems, quorum sensing has several useful applications for computing and robotics. In general, quorum sensing can function as a decision-making process in any [[decentralized system]] in which the components have: (a) a means of assessing the number of other components they interact with and (b) a standard response once a threshold number of components is detected.

==Bacteria==
Some of the best-known examples of quorum sensing come from studies of [[bacteria]]. Bacteria use quorum sensing to regulate certain [[phenotype]] expressions, which in turn, coordinate their behaviours. Some common phenotypes include [[biofilm]] formation, [[virulence]] factor expression, and [[motility]]. Certain bacteria are able to use quorum sensing to regulate [[bioluminescence]], [[nitrogen fixation]] and [[Spore|sporulation]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pan|first=Jiachuan|last2=Ren |first2=Dacheng |date=2009-11-01 |title=Quorum sensing inhibitors: a patent overview|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1517/13543770903222293 |journal=Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Patents|volume=19 |issue=11|pages=1581–1601 |doi=10.1517/13543770903222293|issn=1354-3776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quorum sensing functions based on the local density of the bacterial population in the immediate environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Melissa B.|last2=Bassler|first2=Bonnie L.|date=2001-10-01|title=Quorum Sensing in Bacteria|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.micro.55.1.165|journal=Annual Review of Microbiology|volume=55|issue=1|pages=165–199 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.55.1.165|issn=0066-4227}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can occur within a single bacterial species, as well as between diverse species. Both [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative bacteria|gram-negative]] bacteria use quorum sensing, but there are some major differences in their mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bassler|first=Bonnie L|title=How bacteria talk to each other: regulation of gene expression by quorum sensing|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1369527499000259|journal=Current Opinion in Microbiology|volume=2|issue=6|pages=582–587 |doi=10.1016/s1369-5274(99)00025-9|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanism===
For the bacteria to use quorum sensing constitutively, they must possess three characteristics: to secrete a signaling molecule, an [[autoinducer]], to detect the change in concentration of signaling molecules, and to regulate gene [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]] as a response.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This process is highly dependent on the [[diffusion]] mechanism of the signaling molecules. QS Signaling&amp;nbsp;molecules are usually secreted at a low level by individual bacteria. At low cell density, the molecules may just diffuse away. At high cell density, the local concentration of signaling molecules may exceed its threshold level, and trigger changes in gene expressions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====Gram-positive Bacteria====
Gram-positive bacteria use autoinducing peptide (AIP) as their autoinducers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rutherford|first=Steven T.|last2=Bassler|first2=Bonnie L.|date=2012-11-01|title=Bacterial Quorum Sensing: Its Role in Virulence and Possibilities for Its Control|url=http://perspectivesinmedicine.cshlp.org/content/2/11/a012427|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine |volume=2|issue=11|pages=a012427 |doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a012427| pmid=23125205|pmc=3543102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When gram-positive bacteria detect high concentration of AIP in the environment, AIP bind to a receptor to activate [[kinase]]. The kinase phosphorylates a [[transcription factor]], which regulated gene transcription. This is called a [[Two-component regulatory system|two-component system]].

Another possible mechanism is that AIP is transported into the cytosol, and binds directly to a transcription factor to initiate or inhibit transcription.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Gram-negative Bacteria====
Gram-negative bacteria produce [[N-Acyl homoserine lactone|N-acyl homoserine lactones]] (AHL) as their signaling molecule.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Usually AHLs do not need additional processing, and bind directly to transcription factors to regulate gene expression.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some gram-negative bacteria may use the two-component system as well.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;[[File:Quorum sensing of Gram Negative cell.pdf|thumb|Quorum sensing of Gram Negative cell]]

===Examples===

====''Aliivibrio fischeri''====
Quorum sensing was first observed in ''[[Aliivibrio fischeri]]'', a bioluminescent bacterium that lives as a [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] [[symbiont]] in the [[photophore]] (or light-producing organ) of the [[Hawaiian bobtail squid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nealson |first=K. |last2=Platt |first2=T. |last3=Hastings |first3=J.W. |year=1970 |title=The cellular control of the synthesis and activity of the bacterial luminescent system |url=http://jb.asm.org/cgi/reprint/104/1/313 |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=104 |issue=1 |pages=313–22 |pmid=5473898 |pmc=248216}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''A. fischeri'' cells are free-living (or [[plankton]]ic), the autoinducer is at low concentration, and, thus, cells do not show luminescence. However, when the population reaches the threshold in the photophore (about {{10^|11}} cells/ml), transcription of [[luciferase]] is induced, leading to [[bioluminescence]].

====''Escherichia coli''====
In the Gram-negative bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli''), cell division may be partially regulated by [[AI-2]]-mediated quorum sensing. This species uses AI-2, which is produced and processed by the ''[[Lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor|lsr]]'' [[operon]]. Part of it encodes an [[ABC transporter]], which imports AI-2 into the cells during the early stationary (latent) phase of growth. AI-2 is then phosphorylated by the LsrK [[kinase]], and the newly produced phospho-AI-2 can be either internalized or used to suppress LsrR, a repressor of the ''lsr'' operon (thereby activating the operon). Transcription of the ''lsr'' operon is also thought to be inhibited by [[dihydroxyacetone phosphate]] (DHAP) through its competitive binding to LsrR. [[Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]] has also been shown to inhibit the ''lsr'' operon through [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]]-CAPK-mediated inhibition. This explains why, when grown with [[glucose]], ''E. coli'' will lose the ability to internalize AI-2 (because of [[catabolite repression]]). When grown normally, [[AI-2]] presence is transient.

''E. coli'' and ''Salmonella enterica'' do not produce AHL signals commonly found in other Gram-negative bacteria. However, they have a receptor that detects AHLs from other bacteria and change their gene expression in accordance with the presence of other "quorate" populations of Gram-negative bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ahmer, B.M. |title=Cell-to-cell signalling in ''Escherichia coli'' and ''Salmonella enterica'' |journal=Mol. Microbiol. |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=933–45 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15130116 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2004.04054.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gram Positive Bacteria Quorum Sensing.pdf|thumb|213x213px|Gram positive bacteria quorum sensing]]

====''Salmonella enterica''====
''[[Salmonella]]'' encodes a LuxR homolog, SdiA, but does not encode an AHL synthase. SdiA detects AHLs produced by other species of bacteria including ''Aeromonas hydrophila'', ''Hafnia alvei'', and ''Yersinia enterocolitica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Michael, B. |author2=Smith, J.N. |author3=Swift, S. |author4=Heffron, F. |author5=Ahmer, B.M. |title=SdiA of Salmonella enterica is a LuxR homolog that detects mixed microbial communities |journal= J. Bacteriol. |volume=183 |issue=19 |pages=5733–42 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11544237 |pmc=95466 |doi=10.1128/JB.183.19.5733-5742.2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; When AHL is detected, SdiA regulates the ''rck'' operon on the ''Salmonella'' virulence plasmid (''pefI-srgD-srgA-srgB-rck-srgC'') and a single gene horizontal acquisition in the chromosome ''srgE''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ahmer, B.M. |author2=van Reeuwijk, J. |author3=Timmers, C.D. |author4=Valentine, P.J. |author5=Heffron, F. |title=Salmonella typhimurium encodes an SdiA homolog, a putative quorum sensor of the LuxR family, that regulates genes on the virulence plasmid |journal=J. Bacteriol. |volume=180 |issue=5 |pages=1185–93 |date=March 1998 |pmid=9495757 |pmc=107006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smith, J.N. |author2=Ahmer, B.M. |title=Detection of other microbial species by Salmonella: expression of the SdiA regulon |journal=J.

However, SdiA does become activated when ''Salmonella'' transits through turtles colonized with ''Aeromonas hydrophila'' or mice infected with ''Yersinia enterocolitica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smith, J.N. |author2=Dyszel, J.L. |author3=Soares, J.A. |title=SdiA, an N-acylhomoserine lactone receptor, becomes active during the transit of Salmonella enterica through the gastrointestinal tract of turtles |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=e2826 |year=2008 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002826 |pmid=18665275 |pmc=2475663 |editor=Ausubel, Frederick M.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dyszel, J.L. |author2=Smith, J.N. |author3=Lucas, D.E. |title=Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium can detect acyl homoserine lactone production by Yersinia enterocolitica in mice |journal=J. Bacteriol. |volume=192 |issue=1 |pages=29–37 |date=January 2010 |pmid=19820103 |doi=10.1128/JB.01139-09 |pmc=2798265|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, ''Salmonella'' appears to use SdiA to detect the AHL production of other pathogens rather than the normal gut flora.

====''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''====
The opportunistic pathogen ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' uses quorum sensing to coordinate the formation of [[biofilm]], [[swarming motility]], [[exopolysaccharide]] production, virulence, and cell aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lewis Sauer, K. |author2=Camper, A. |author3=Ehrlich, G. |author4=Costerton, J. |author5=Davies, D. |title=Pseudomonas aeruginosa displays multiple phenotypes during development as a biofilm |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=184 |issue=4 |pages=1140–54 |year=2002 |issn=0021-9193 |doi=10.1128/jb.184.4.1140-1154.2002 |pmid=11807075 |pmc=134825}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bacteria can grow within a host without harming it, until they reach a threshold concentration. Then they become aggressive, developing to the point at which their numbers are sufficient to overcome the host's [[immune system]], and form a [[biofilm]], leading to [[disease]] within the host as the biofilm is a protective layer encasing the bacteria population. Another form of [[gene regulation]] that allows the [[bacteria]] to rapidly adapt to surrounding changes is through environmental signaling. Recent studies have discovered that [[anaerobiosis]] can significantly impact the major regulatory circuit of quorum sensing. This important link between quorum sensing and anaerobiosis has a significant impact on production of virulence factors of this [[organism]].&lt;ref name=Cornelis&gt;{{cite book |author=Cornelis, P. (ed.) |title=Pseudomonas: Genomics and Molecular Biology |edition=1st |publisher=Caister Academic Press |year=2008 |url= http://www.horizonpress.com/pseudo |isbn=1-904455-19-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Garlic]] and ginseng experimentally block quorum sensing in ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Thomas Bjarnsholt |author2=Peter Østrup Jensen |author3=Thomas B. Rasmussen |author4=Lars Christophersen |author5=Henrik Calum |author6=Morten Hentzer |author7=Hans-Petter Hougen |author8=Jørgen Rygaard |author9=Claus Moser |author10=Leo Eberl |author11=Niels Høiby |author12=Michael Givskov  |lastauthoramp=yes |title= Garlic blocks quorum sensing and promotes rapid clearing of pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections |journal=Microbiology |volume=151 |issue=4 |pages=3873–80 |year=2005 |pmid=16339933 |doi= 10.1099/mic.0.27955-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hoped that the therapeutic enzymatic degradation of the signaling molecules will prevent the formation of such biofilms and possibly weaken established biofilms. Disrupting the signalling process in this way is called ''quorum sensing inhibition''.

====''Acinetobacter'' sp.====
It has recently been found that ''[[Acinetobacter]]'' sp. also show quorum sensing activity. This bacterium, an emerging pathogen, produces AHLs.&lt;ref name="biomedcentral"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kok Gan |first=Chan |author2=Atkinson, Steve; Mathee, Kalai; Sam, Choon-Kook; Chhabra, Siri Ram; Camara, Miguel; Koh, Chong-Lek &amp; Williams, Paul |title=Characterization of N-acylhomoserine lactone-degrading bacteria associated with the Zingiber officinale (ginger) rhizosphere: Co-existence of quorum quenching and quorum sensing in Acinetobacter and Burkholderia |journal=BMC Microbiology |year=2011 |volume=11 |pages=51 |doi= 10.1186/1471-2180-11-51 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/51/abstract |pmid=21385437 |pmc=3062576 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Acinetobacter'' sp. shows both quorum sensing and quorum quenching activity. It produces AHLs and also, it can degrade the AHL molecules as well.&lt;ref name="biomedcentral"/&gt;

===Molecules involved===
Three-dimensional structures of proteins involved in quorum sensing were first published in 2001, when the [[crystal structure]]s of three [[LuxS]] [[Homology (biology)#Orthology|orthologs]] were determined by [[X-ray crystallography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lewis, H.A. |author2=Furlong, E.B. |author3=Laubert, B. |author4=Eroshkina, G.A. |author5=Batiyenko, Y. |author6=Adams, J.M. |author7=Bergseid, M.G. |author8=Marsh, C.D. |author9=Peat, T.S. |author10=Sanderson, W.E. |author11=Sauder, J.M. |author12=Buchanan, S.G. |title=A structural genomics approach to the study of quorum sensing: Crystal structures of three LuxS orthologs |journal=Structure |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=527–37 |year=2001 |pmid= 11435117 |doi=10.1016/S0969-2126(01)00613-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the crystal structure of the receptor LuxP of ''[[Vibrio harveyi]]'' with its inducer [[AI-2]] (which is one of the few [[biomolecules]] containing [[boron]]) bound to it was also determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chen, X. |author2=Schauder, S. |author3=Potier, N. |author4=Van Dorsselaer, A. |author5=Pelczer, I. |author6=Bassler, B. |author7=Hughson, F. |title=Structural identification of a bacterial quorum-sensing signal containing boron |journal=Nature |volume=415 |issue=6871 |pages=545–9 |year=2002 |pmid=11823863 |url=http://www.nsls.bnl.gov/newsroom/science/2002/pdfs/2002-09-Hughson.pdf |doi=10.1038/415545a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many bacterial species, including ''[[E. coli]]'', an enteric bacterium and model organism for Gram-negative bacteria, produce AI-2.

Certain bacteria can produce enzymes called [[lactonase]]s that can target and inactivate AHLs.
Researchers have developed novel molecules which block the signalling receptors of bacteria (Quorum quenching). mBTL is a compound that has been shown to inhibit quorum sensing and decrease the amount of cell death by a significant amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Loughlin | first1 = CT. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2013 | title = A quorum-sensing inhibitor blocks Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence and biofilm formation | journal = PNAS | volume = 110 | issue = 44| pages = 17981–6 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1316981110 | pmid=24143808 | pmc=3816427}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Additionally, researchers are also examining the role of natural compounds (such as [[caffeine]]) as potential quorum sensing inhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Norizan | first1 = S. | last2 = Chan | first2 = K. | year = 2013 | title = Caffeine as a potential quorum-sensing inhibitor | url = | journal = Sensors | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 5117–5129 | doi = 10.3390/s130405117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this area has been promising and could lead to the development of natural compounds as effective therapeutics.

===Evolution===

====Sequence analysis====
The majority of quorum sensing systems that fall under the "two-gene" (an autoinducer synthase coupled with a receptor molecule) paradigm as defined by the ''[[Vibrio fischeri]]'' system occur in the [[Gram-negative]] [[Proteobacteria]]. A comparison between the Proteobacteria [[phylogeny]] as generated by [[16S ribosomal RNA]] sequences and phylogenies of LuxI-, LuxR-, or LuxS-homologs shows a notably high level of global similarity. Overall, the quorum sensing genes seem to have diverged along with the Proteobacteria phylum as a whole. This indicates that these quorum sensing systems are quite ancient, and arose very early in the Proteobacteria lineage.&lt;ref name="gray-2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gray, K.M. |author2=Garey, J.R. |title=The evolution of bacterial LuxI and LuxR quorum sensing regulators |journal=Microbiology |volume= 147 |year=2001 |pages=2379–87 |pmid=11496014 |issue=Pt 8 | doi = 10.1099/00221287-147-8-2379 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lerat-2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lerat, E. |author2=Moran, N.A. |title=Evolutionary history of quorum-sensing systems in bacteria |journal= Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=21 |year=2004 |pages=903–13 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msh097 |pmid=15014168 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although examples of [[horizontal gene transfer]] are apparent in LuxI, LuxR, and LuxS phylogenies, they are relatively rare. This result is in line with the observation that quorum sensing genes tend to control the expression of a wide array of genes scattered throughout the bacterial chromosome. A recent acquisition by horizontal gene transfer would be unlikely to have integrated itself to this degree. Given that the majority of autoinducer–synthase/receptor occurs in tandem in bacterial genomes, it is also rare that they switch partners and so pairs tend to co-evolve.&lt;ref name="lerat-2004"/&gt;

In quorum sensing genes of [[Gammaproteobacteria]], which includes ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', the LuxI/LuxR genes form a functional pair, with LuxI as the auto-inducer synthase and LuxR as the receptor. Gamma Proteobacteria are unique in possessing quorum sensing genes, which, although functionally similar to the LuxI/LuxR genes, have a markedly divergent sequence.&lt;ref name="lerat-2004"/&gt; This family of quorum-sensing [[homology (biology)|homologs]] may have arisen in the gamma Proteobacteria ancestor, although the cause of their extreme sequence divergence yet maintenance of functional similarity has yet to be explained. In addition, species that employ multiple discrete quorum sensing systems are almost all members of the gamma Proteobacteria, and evidence of horizontal transfer of quorum sensing genes is most evident in this class.&lt;ref name="gray-2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lerat-2004"/&gt;

====Controversy====
As quorum sensing implies a cooperative behavior, this concept has been challenged by the evolutionary implication of cooperative cheaters. This is circumvented by the concept of ''diffusion sensing'', which has been an alternative and complementary model to quorum sensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Redfield|first1=RJ|title=Is quorum sensing a side effect of diffusion sensing|journal=Trends in Microbiology|date=2002|volume=10|issue=8|pages=365–370|pmid=12160634|doi=10.1016/s0966-842x(02)02400-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both explanations face the problems of signalling in either complex (multiple species sharing the same space) or simple (one single cell confined to a limited volume) environments where the spatial distribution of the cells can be more important for sensing than the cell population density. A new model, ''efficiency sensing'', which takes into account both problematics, population density and spatial confinement, has been proposed as an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hense, B.A. |author2=Kuttler, C. |author3=Müller, J. |author4=Rothballer, M. |author5=Hartmann, A. |author6=Kreft, J.U. |title=Does efficiency sensing unify diffusion and quorum sensing? |journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology |volume=5 |pages=230–39 |year=2007 |pmid=17304251 |url=http://www.nature.com/nrmicro/journal/v5/n3/full/nrmicro1600.html |doi=10.1038/nrmicro1600 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the probable reasons for controversy is that current terminologies (quorum sensing, diffusion sensing, efficiency sensing) arise from different models of how natural selection has acted to shape and maintain the process.  Since each of the various models does apply under some circumstances but not others, a sensible resolution to these controversies could be to return the terminology of the process to autoinduction, as originally described by Hastings and coworkers, as this term does not imply understanding of the function of the process.

====Interaction of quorum-sensing molecules with mammalian cells and its medical applications====
Next to the potential antimicrobial functionality, quorum-sensing derived molecules, especially the peptides, are being investigated for their use in other therapeutic domains as well, including immunology, central nervous system disorders and oncology. Quorum-sensing peptides have been demonstrated to interact with cancer cells, as well as to permeate the blood-brain barrier permeation reaching the brain parenchyma&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wynendaele | first1 = E. | last2 = Pauwels | first2 = E. | last3 = Van de Wiele | first3 = C. | last4 = Burvenich | first4 = C. | last5 = De Spiegeleer | first5 = B. | year = 2012 | title = The potential role of quorum-sensing peptides in oncology | url = | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 78 | issue = | pages = 814–817 | doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2012.03.018 | pmid=22513236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Spiegeleer | first1 = B | last2 = Verbeke | first2 = F | last3 = D'Hondt | first3 = M | last4 = Hendrix | first4 = A | last5 = Van De Wiele | first5 = C | last6 = Burvenich | first6 = C | display-authors = etal   | year = 2015 | title = The Quorum Sensing Peptides PhrG, CSP and EDF Promote Angiogenesis and Invasion of Breast Cancer Cells In Vitro | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 10 | issue = 3| page = e0119471 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0119471 | pmid=25780927 | pmc=4363635}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | date = Feb 2015 | title =  Crosstalk between the microbiome and cancer cells by quorum sensing peptides| url = | journal = Peptides | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 40–8 | doi = 10.1016/j.peptides.2014.12.009 | pmid=25559405 | last1 = Wynendaele | first1 = E | last2 = Verbeke | first2 = F | last3 = D'Hondt | first3 = M | last4 = Hendrix | first4 = A | last5 = Van De Wiele | first5 = C | last6 = Burvenich | first6 = C | last7 = Peremans | first7 = K | last8 = De Wever | first8 = O | last9 = Bracke | first9 = M | last10 = De Spiegeleer | first10 = B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wynendaele | first1 = E | last2 = Verbeke | first2 = F | last3 = Stalmans | first3 = S | last4 = Gevaert | first4 = B | last5 = Janssens | first5 = Y | last6 = Van De Wiele | first6 = C | last7 = Peremans | first7 = K | last8 = Burvenich | first8 = C | last9 = De Spiegeleer | first9 = B | date = Nov 2015 | title =  Quorum Sensing Peptides Selectively Penetrate the Blood-Brain Barrier| journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 10 | issue = 11| page = e0142071 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0142071 | pmid=26536593 | pmc=4633044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Methanosaeta harundinacea'' 6Ac====
''Methanosaeta harundinacea'' 6Ac, a methanogenic archaeon, produces carboxylated acyl homoserine lactone compounds that facilitate the transition from growth as short cells to growth as filaments.&lt;ref name="ISMEJ"&gt;Zhang, G. et al.

==Plants==
Quorum sensing could be described when it was known that bacteria possess the ability to communicate. In the last few years, interactions between bacteria and [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] hosts, such as plants, have been shown. These interactions are facilitated by quorum-sensing molecules and play a major role in maintaining the pathogenicity of bacteria towards other hosts, such as humans. This mechanism can be understood by looking at the effects of [[N-Acyl homoserine lactone]] (AHL), one of the quorum sensing-signalling molecules in [[gram-negative bacteria]], on plants. The model organism used is ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Götz-Rösch |first=Christine |last2=Sieper |first2=Tina |last3=Fekete |first3=Agnes |last4=Schmitt-Kopplin |first4=Philippe |last5=Hartmann |first5=Anton |last6=Schröder |first6=Peter |date=2015-04-10 |title=Influence of bacterial N-acyl-homoserine lactones on growth parameters, pigments, antioxidative capacities and the xenobiotic phase II detoxification enzymes in barley and yam bean |journal=Frontiers in Plant Science |volume=6 |doi=10.3389/fpls.2015.00205 |issn=1664-462X |pmc=4392610 |pmid=25914699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of AHLs having long carbon-chains (C12, C14), which have an unknown receptor mechanism, is less well understood than AHLs having short carbon-chains (C4, C6, C8), which are perceived by the [[G protein-coupled receptor]]. A phenomenon called "AHL priming", which is a dependent signalling pathway, enhanced our knowledge of long-chain AHLs. The role of quorum-sensing molecules was better explained according to three categories: host physiology–based impact of quorum sensing molecules; ecological effects; and cellular signaling. Calcium signalling and [[calmodulin]] have a large role in short-chain AHLs response in ''Arabidopsis''. Research was also conducted on [[barley]] and crop [[Pachyrhizus erosus|yam bean]] that reveals the AHLs determining the detoxification enzymes called [[Glutathione S-transferase|GST]] were found less in yam bean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hartmann |first=Anton |last2=Schikora |first2=Adam |date=2015-08-19 |title=Editorial: Plant responses to bacterial quorum sensing molecules |journal=Frontiers in Plant Science |volume=6 |doi=10.3389/fpls.2015.00643 |issn=1664-462X |pmc=4541025 |pmid=26347761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quorum sensing-based regulatory systems are necessary to plant-disease-causing bacteria. Looking towards developing new strategies based on plant-associated microbiomes, the aim of further study is to improve the quantity and quality of the food supply. Further research into this inter-kingdom communication also enhances the possibility of learning about quorum sensing in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2003-01-01 |title=Quorum Sensing in Plant-Pathogenic Bacteria |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.phyto.41.052002.095652 |journal=Annual Review of Phytopathology |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=455–482 |doi=10.1146/annurev.phyto.41.052002.095652 |pmid=12730390  | last1 = Von Bodman  | first1 = SB  | last2 = Bauer  | first2 = WD  | last3 = Coplin  | first3 = DL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social insects==
Social insect colonies are an excellent example of a [[decentralized system]], because no individual is in charge of directing or making decisions for the colony. Several groups of social insects have been shown to use quorum sensing in a process that resembles collective decision-making.

===Examples===

====Ants====
Colonies of the ant ''[[Temnothorax albipennis]]'' nest in small crevices between rocks. When the rocks shift and the nest is broken up, these ants must quickly choose a new nest to move into. During the first phase of the decision-making process, a small portion of the workers leave the destroyed nest and search for new crevices. When one of these scout ants finds a potential nest, she assesses the quality of the crevice based on a variety of factors including the size of the interior, the number of openings (based on light level), and the presence or absence of dead ants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Franks, N.R. |author2=Dornhaus, A. |title=Not everything that counts can be counted: ants use multiple metrics for a single nest trait |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=273 |issue=1583 |pages=165–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16555783 |pmc=1560019 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3312|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Franks, N.R. |author2=Hooper, J. |title=Tomb evaders: house-hunting hygiene in ants |journal=Biology Letters |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=190–2 |year=2005 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0302 |pmid=17148163 |pmc=1626204|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worker then returns to the destroyed nest, where she waits for a short period before recruiting other workers to follow her to the nest that she has found, using a process called [[tandem running]]. The waiting period is inversely related to the quality of the site; for instance, a worker that has found a poor site will wait longer than a worker that encountered a good site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mallon, E.B. |author2=Pratt, S.C. |title=Individual and collective decision-making during nest site selection by the ant ''Leptothorax albipennis'' |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=352–9 |year=2001 |doi=10.1007/s002650100377|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the new recruits visit the potential nest site and make their own assessment of its quality, the number of ants visiting the crevice increases. During this stage, ants may be visiting many different potential nests. However, because of the differences in the waiting period, the number of ants in the best nest will tend to increase at the greatest rate. Eventually, the ants in this nest will sense that the rate at which they encounter other ants has exceeded a particular threshold, indicating that the quorum number has been reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pratt, S.C. |title=Quorum sensing by encounter rates in the ant ''Temnothorax albipennis'' |journal=Behavioral Ecology |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=488–96 |year=2005 |doi=10.1093/beheco/ari020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the ants sense a quorum, they return to the destroyed nest and begin rapidly carrying the brood, queen, and fellow workers to the new nest. Scouts that are still tandem-running to other potential sites are also recruited to the new nest, and the entire colony moves. Thus, although no single worker may have visited and compared all of the available options, quorum sensing enables the colony as a whole to quickly make good decisions about where to move.

====Honey bees====
[[Honey bee]]s (''Apis mellifera'') also use quorum sensing to make decisions about new nest sites. Large colonies reproduce through a process called [[swarming (honeybee)|swarming]], in which the queen leaves the hive with a portion of the workers to form a new nest elsewhere. After leaving the nest, the workers form a swarm that hangs from a branch or overhanging structure. This swarm persists during the decision-making phase until a new nest site is chosen.

The quorum sensing process in honey bees is similar to the method used by ''[[Temnothorax]]'' ants in several ways. A small portion of the workers leave the swarm to search out new nest sites, and each worker assesses the quality of the cavity it finds. The worker then returns to the swarm and recruits other workers to her cavity using the honey bee [[waggle dance]]. However, instead of using a time delay, the number of dance repetitions the worker performs is dependent on the quality of the site. Workers that found poor nests stop dancing sooner, and can therefore be recruited to the better sites. Once the visitors to a new site sense that a quorum number (usually 10–20 bees) has been reached, they return to the swarm and begin using a new recruitment method called piping. This vibration signal causes the swarm to take off and fly to the new nest location. In an experimental test, this decision-making process enabled honey bee swarms to choose the best nest site in four out of five trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Seeley, T.D. |author2=Visscher, P.K. |title=Group decision making in nest-site selection by honey bees |journal=Apidologie |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=101–16 |year=2004 |doi=10.1051/apido:2004004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Seeley, T.D. |author2=Visscher, P.K. |title=Group decision making in honey bee swarms |journal=American Scientist |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=220–9 |year=2006 |doi=10.1511/2006.3.220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computing and robotics==
Quorum sensing can be a useful tool for improving the function of self-organizing networks such as the SECOAS (Self-Organizing Collegiate Sensor) environmental monitoring system. In this system, individual nodes sense that there is a population of other nodes with similar data to report. The population then nominates just one node to report the data, resulting in power savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Britton |first=M. |last2=Sacks |first2=L. |title=The SECOAS Project—Development of a Self-Organising, Wireless Sensor Network for Environmental Monitoring |journal=SANPA |year=2004 |url=http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/secoas/papers/SANPA-2004-Britton.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216223909/http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/secoas/papers/SANPA-2004-Britton.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ad-hoc wireless networks can also benefit from quorum sensing, by allowing the system to detect and respond to network conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Peysakhov, M. |author2=Regli, W. |booktitle=Proceedings 2005 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium, 2005.

Quorum sensing can also be used to coordinate the behavior of autonomous robot swarms. Using a process similar to that used by ''Temnothorax'' ants, robots can make rapid group decisions without the direction of a controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Sahin |first=E. |last2=Franks |first2=N. |title=Measurement of Space: From Ants to Robots |booktitle=Proceedings of WGW 2002: EPSRC/BBSRC International Workshop |year= 2002 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.161.6407 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain '''Robert Cecil Beavan''' (1841 - 3 February 1870&lt;ref&gt;Obituary. Ibis 1870:301-302&lt;/ref&gt;), corresponding member of the [[Zoological Society of London]], served in India with the Bengal Staff Corps for 10 years. During his short life he collected specimens of birds and eggs at various locations. He contributed notes to the Ibis journal as wells as the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London. He also collaborated with [[Allan Octavian Hume]]. His collection of eggs and birds went into the Natural History Museum through the [[Arthur Hay, 9th Marquess of Tweeddale|Tweeddale]] and Godman-Salvin collections.

In 1864 Beavan worked at [[Barrackpore]] and the winter of that year was spent in the [[Maunbhoom District]],  an area studied earlier by [[Samuel Tickell]] and [[Edward Blyth]]. His notes on this period were published in ''The Ibis'' (1865) entitled "Notes on various Indian Birds". While still in service he collected in the [[Andaman Islands]] and with additional information from Colonel [[Robert Christopher Tytler]], wrote  "The Avifauna of the Andaman Islands" in the ''Ibis'' in 1867.

Beavan was sent home once to Britain due to bad health, and on his second such trip, he died at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beolens|first1=Bo|last2=Watkins|first2=Michael|title=Whose Bird? Common Bird Names and the People They Commemorate|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|location=[[New Haven]], [[London]]|year=2003|page=44|isbn=0-300-10359-X|lccn=2003113608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The species ''[[Pyrrhula erythaca]]'', first collected by him, is sometimes called Beavan's Bullfinch (Also called Gray-headed Bullfinch).

His brother, Reginald, a lieutenant in the 22nd Punjab Native Infantry (Bengal Staff Corps where he was Lieutenant 1 Jan 1862, Captain 4 May 1872, Major 4 May 1880&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/newannualarmylis1885lond#page/55/mode/1up/ Ranks - Annual Army List 1885]&lt;/ref&gt;), was a keen sports hunter and took an interest in fishes.

==Publications==
Beavan's chief publications are a series of notes in the [[Ibis (journal)|Ibis]] between 1865 and 1868. These included many notes of Colonel R C Tytler.

* XXXVII. Additional Notes on various Indian Birds. Ibis 11(4):403-426
* (Accipitres) P. Z. S. 1868, pp.&amp;nbsp;390–402.

Reginald appears to have communicated some of Robert's papers to the Proceedings of the Zoological society after his death. The ''Handbook of the freshwater fishes of India'', was published posthumously in 1877 and is attributed to "Capt. R. Beavan, Bengal Staff Corps CMZS".

PLoS ONE 4, e5793 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Males generally prefer to maximize their number of offspring, and therefore their number of mates; females, on the other hand, tend to care more for their offspring and have fewer mates.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Gage, M.

Proceedings: Biological Sciences 269, 2309–16 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, there are generally more males available to mate at a given time, making females a limited resource.&lt;ref name=two /&gt;&lt;ref name=three /&gt; This leads males to evolve aggressive mating behaviors which can help them acquire mates.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;Grayson, K.

==Male adaptations==

===Harassment/aggression===

Harassment is a technique used by males of many species to force females to submit to mating.&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;Muller, M. N., Kahlenberg, S. M., Emery Thompson, M. &amp; Wrangham, R. W. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2141672/ Male coercion and the costs of promiscuous mating for female chimpanzees]. Proceedings: Biological Sciences 274, 1009–14 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed in numerous species, including mammals, birds, insects and fish.&lt;ref name=four /&gt; Aggression and harassment have been documented in the males of [[Guppy|guppies]] (''Poecilia reticulata''),&lt;ref name=two /&gt; [[bottlenose dolphin]]s (''Tursiops aduncus''), [[boto]]s (''Inia geoffrensis''), [[dusky dolphin]]s (''Lagenorhynchus obscurus''), [[Hector's dolphin]]s (''Cephalorhynchus hectori''), [[grizzly bear]]s, [[polar bear]]s, and ungulates.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;Fury, C. A., Ruckstuhl, K. E. &amp; Harrison, P. L. [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0052987 Spatial and social sexual segregation patterns in indo-pacific bottlenose dolphins (''Tursiops aduncus'')]. PLoS ONE 8, e52987 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; It is also seen in [[Chinook salmon]] (''Oncorhynchus tshawytscha''),&lt;ref name=four /&gt; red-spotted newts (''[[Notophthalmus]] viridescens''), and seed-eating true bugs (''[[Lygaeidae|Neacoryphus]]'' spp.).&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;Valero, A., Macías Garcia, C. &amp; Magurran, A. E. [http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/4/2/149.full Heterospecific harassment of native endangered fishes by invasive guppies in Mexico]. Biology letters 4, 149–52 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is prevalent in [[spider monkey]]s,&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt; wild [[Barbary macaque]]s (''Macaca sylvanus'') and many other primates.&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;McFarland, R. &amp; Majolo, B. [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0026893 Grooming coercion and the post-conflict trading of social services in wild Barbary macaque] s. PLoS ONE 6, e26893 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In basically all major primate taxa, aggression is used by the dominant males when herding females and keeping them away from other males.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt; In [[hamadryas baboon]]s, the males often bite the females’ necks and threaten them.&lt;ref name="eleven"&gt;Nitsch, F., Stueckle, S., Stahl, D. &amp; Zinner, D. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10329-011-0258-2 Copulation patterns in captive hamadryas baboons: a quantitative analysis]. Primates; journal of primatology 52, 373–83 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Wild chimpanzees can charge at females, shake branches, hit, slap, kick, pound, drag, and bite them. Orangutans are among the most forceful of mammals. [[Bornean orangutan]]s (''Pongo pygmaeus'') exhibited aggression in almost 90 percent of their copulations, including when the females were not resisting.&lt;ref name="twelve"&gt;Knott, C. D., Emery Thompson, M., Stumpf, R. M. &amp; McIntyre, M. H. [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/277/1678/105.full Female reproductive strategies in orangutans, evidence for female choice and counterstrategies to infanticide in a species with frequent sexual coercion]. Proceedings: Biological Sciences 277, 105–13 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; A possible explanation for aggressive behaviors in primates is that it is a way for males to train females to be afraid of them and be more likely to surrender to future sexual advances.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

===Intimidation===

Males may also use more indirect techniques to mate with females, such as [[intimidation]]. While most female water striders ([[Gerridae]]) have their genitalia exposed, females of the water strider species ''[[Gerris gracilicornis]]'' have evolved a shield over their genitals. As a result, males cannot physically coerce females because mating is difficult unless the female exposes her genitalia. Therefore, males intimidate females into mating by attracting predators; they tap on the water’s surface and create ripples that catch the attention of predatory fish. From there, it is in the best interest of the female to mate, and as quickly as possible, to avoid being eaten by predators. Typical mating positions of water striders have the females on the bottom, closer to predators, so the risk of predation is much higher for them. Females succumb to copulation to get males to cease signaling to predators.&lt;ref name="thirteen"&gt;Han, C. S. &amp; Jablonski, P. G. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964456/ Male water striders attract predators to intimidate females into copulation]. Nature Communications 1, 52 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another indirect form of sexual coercion occurs in red-sided garter snakes, ''[[Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis]]''. When males "court" females, they line their bodies up to the females' and produce caudocephalic waves, which are a series of muscle contractions that travel through their bodies from tail to head. The exact reason for this behavior is unknown, but some studies show that it relates to stress. Females have nonrespiratory air sacs containing anoxic air, and the waving pushes this air into her lungs. The resulting stress causes her cloaca to open, and aids the male in inserting his [[hemipenis]]. The stronger and more frequent the caudocephalic waves and the closer the male’s cloaca to the female’s, the more likely the male is to mate successfully.&lt;ref name="fourteen"&gt;Shine, R., Langkilde, T. &amp; Mason, R. T. [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Shine/publication/222434765_Courtship_tactics_in_garter_snakes_How_do_a_male's_morphology_and_behaviour_influence_his_mating_success/links/0fcfd4fc46ad6dfdfc000000.pdf Courtship tactics in garter snakes: how do a male’s morphology and behaviour influence his mating success?] Animal Behaviour 67, 477–483 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grasping and grappling{{anchor|Grasping.2FGrappling}}===
{{see also|Sexual conflict#Grasping}}
Males of certain species have evolved mating behaviors in which they forcefully attempt to mate with and inseminate females, often employing grasping techniques. These male grasping devices exist to increase the duration of copulation and restrict females from mating with other males. They are in some ways a form of [[mate guarding]]. While some males have evolved different types of modifications to aid in grasping, others just grab females and attempt to force copulation.

One type of grasping modification is [[Sexual conflict#Spiky genitals|spiny male genitalia]]. In [[seed beetle]]s (Coleoptera: Bruchidae), males possess sclerotized spines on their genitalia. These spines are used during copulation to help overcome female resistance and penetrate into their copulatory duct. In addition to aiding penetration, these spines promote the passage of seminal fluids, and act as an anchor to keep the female from fleeing. Furthermore, spiny genitals can injure the females and make them less likely to remate.&lt;ref name=six /&gt; [[Sepsidae]] fly males have modifications on their forelegs to help them grasp onto female wing bases. These modifications include cuticular outgrowths, indentations, and bristles, and males use them to secure themselves onto females after jumping on them. Once the males grab on, a struggle ensues akin to a [[rodeo]], where males try to hold on while females violently shake them off.&lt;ref name=five /&gt;

Another type of modification is found in male diving beetles (of the family Dytiscidae), who are equipped with suction cup structures on their front legs. They use these to grab passing females and attach to their dorsal surfaces. To get the females to submit, males shake the females violently and keep them submerged underwater (diving beetles cannot go long without atmospheric oxygen). Unable to get air, female diving beetles submit to the male’s advances in order to avoid drowning (and they lose the energy to resist). Once the males attach, copulation can occur.&lt;ref name="fifteen"&gt;Bergsten, J. &amp; Miller, K. B. [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000522 Phylogeny of diving beetles reveals a coevolutionary arms race between the sexes]. PLoS ONE 2, e522 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Male waterfowl have developed another modification; while most male birds have no external genitalia, male waterfowl (Aves: [[Anatidae]]) have a phallus (length {{convert|1.5|-|4.0|cm|in|disp=x| [|]}}). Most birds mate with the males balancing on top of the females and touching cloacas in a “cloacal kiss”; this makes forceful insemination very difficult. The phallus that male waterfowl have evolved everts out of their bodies (in a clockwise coil) and aids in inseminating females without their cooperation.&lt;ref name="sixteen"&gt;Brennan, P. L. R. et al. [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000418 Coevolution of male and female genital morphology in waterfowl]. PLoS ONE 2, e418 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another such technique is having a "lock-like" mechanism, found in ''[[Drosophila montana]]'', dogs, wolves, and pigs. Towards the end of copulation, females struggle to try to dislodge the males, whose genital organs take much longer to deflate than females do; the locking (most commonly known in [[canid]]s as a "tie") allows the males to copulate for as long as they need to until they are finished. In dogs, the male has [[bulbus glandis|a knot in his penis]] that gets engorged with blood and ties the female, locking them together during copulation, until the act is complete. Male dogs have evolved this mechanism during mating in order to prevent other males from penetration whilst they are and the use of the tie enables them to be more likely to inseminate the female and produce a healthy litter of pups. Breaking this "tie" can be physically harmful to both females and males.&lt;ref name="seventeen"&gt;Mazzi, D., Kesäniemi, J., Hoikkala, A. &amp; Klappert, K. [https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-9-132 Sexual conflict over the duration of copulation in Drosophila montana: why is longer better?] BMC Evolutionary Biology 9, 132 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Males of many species simply grab the females and force a mating. Coercive mating is very common in water striders ([[Gerridae]]) because in most of the species, the female genitalia are often exposed and easily accessible to males.&lt;ref name=one /&gt; Without any courtship behavior, males initiate by forcefully trying to mount the females. Carrying the males on their backs is energetically costly to females, so they try to resist and throw off the males. The males fight back even harder and use their forelegs to tightly grasp the female’s thorax and keep them from escaping.&lt;ref name="eighteen"&gt;Han, C. S., Jablonski, P. G., Kim, B. &amp; Park, F. C. [https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-10-359 Size-assortative mating and sexual size dimorphism are predictable from simple mechanics of mate-grasping behavior]. BMC Evolutionary Biology 10, 359 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The males then forcefully insert their genitalia into the female vulvar opening.&lt;ref name=one /&gt; In the newt species ''[[Notophthalmus viridescens]]'', males carry out a courtship behavior called [[amplexus]]. It consists of males capturing females that do not want to mate with them and using their hind limbs to grasp the females by their pectoral regions.&lt;ref name=three /&gt;

Male guppies (''[[Poecilia reticulata]]'') have been observed to forcefully copulate with females by trying to insert their [[gonopodium]] (male sex organ) into female’s genital pores, whether or not they are accepting.&lt;ref name=four /&gt; Sometimes, male guppies also try to forcefully mate with ''[[Skiffia bilineata]]'' (goodeid) females, which resemble guppy females and tend to share the same habitat, even when guppy females are available. A possible explanation for this is the deeper genital cavity of ''S. bilineata'', which stimulates the males more than when mating with guppy females.&lt;ref name=nine /&gt;

Males of some species are able to immobilize females and force copulation. In pigs and boars, males grab females and maneuver the pelvis to lift the vaginal opening and facilitate copulation. The stimulation following intromission causes the female to be immobilized. The male can then freely continue copulation without worrying about the female escaping.&lt;ref name="nineteen"&gt;Zehr, J. L. NIH Public Access. 41, 101–112 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Immobilization of the female also occurs in [[muscovy duck]]s.

===Infanticide===
{{Main|Infanticide (zoology)}}
In some mammal species, mostly nonhuman primates,{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} it is common for males to commit infanticide to mate with females. This happens often in species that live in groups, such as Old and New World monkeys, apes, prosimians, and hamadryas baboons.&lt;ref name="twenty three"/&gt; There is usually a single breeding male in a group, and when an outside male aggressively takes over, he kills off all of the young offspring. The males kill infants that are not their own to assert their strength and position, and mate with the females.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;  Sometimes, multiple males will invade a troop and gang up on females, killing their offspring and subsequently mating with them. This occurs in [[spider monkey]]s, red-backed [[squirrel monkey]]s, chimpanzees, and [[red howler (disambiguation)|red howler]]s.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

===Secretions===

In the newt species ''[[Notophthalmus viridescens]]'', the males rub off hormonal secretions onto the skin of the females they are courting. These hormones have been shown to make the female more receptive to mating with the male. When the male deposits the secretions, he detaches from the female and releases a spermatophore (containing spermatozoa). It is then the female’s decision to either accept it and pick it up or reject it by running away; these hormones make her more likely to accept it.&lt;ref name=three /&gt;

===Coercive faithfulness===

====Post-copulatory guarding====

Another form of coercion is male mate guarding, used to keep females from mating with other males, and often involves aggression.&lt;ref name=seven /&gt; Guarding allows the males to assure their paternity. A classic example occurs in diving beetles, family Dytiscidae. After copulation, males continue to guard females for up to six hours. They hold them underwater, occasionally tilting them up for air.&lt;ref name=fifteen /&gt;  Guarding also occurs in water striders where, once males complete their sperm transfer, they often remain on top of the females. This guarding duration varies, lasting from several minutes to several weeks. The purpose of such long guarding periods is for the males to see the females lay their eggs and be assured that the offspring are theirs.&lt;ref name=eighteen /&gt;  This behavior also occurs in hamadryas baboons (''Papio hamadryas''), where the leader males practice intensive mate guarding.&lt;ref name="twenty three" /&gt;  In ''Drosophila'' Montana, studies have shown that following mate guarding, the chances of a female mating with or being inseminated by another male were greatly diminished. This shows that the mate guarding tactic can be very effective.&lt;ref name=seventeen /&gt;

====Secretions/ejaculations====

Males of some species use bodily fluids, such as seminal fluid from their ejaculate, to aid in the coercion of females. Seminal fluid in males of Drosophila melanogaster may contain chemicals that increase the amount of time it takes for females to remate, decrease the length of successive matings, or keep her from remating at all. The less a female mates with other males after copulation with a male, the more likely it is for him to ensure his paternity. These chemicals may also serve to increase the female’s reproductive success, but at the cost of decreased longevity and immune response.&lt;ref name=seventeen /&gt;

In many species, seminal fluid can be used as a sort of mating plug. Males of these species transfer their sperm at the beginning of copulation and use the rest of copulation to transfer substances that help build up the mating plugs. These plugs are effective in ensuring that the female does not mate with any other males and that the male’s paternity is secured.&lt;ref name=seventeen /&gt;

==Costs to females==

===Direct===

A major direct cost of sexual coercion is physical injury.&lt;ref name=four /&gt; Male seed beetles (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) have sclerotized spine on their genitalia, which penetrate the female and leave melanized scars. Females can be physically injured from just one mating, and the more a female mates, the more scarring forms in the copulatory duct.&lt;ref name=six /&gt; In guppies, the male’s gonopodium can cause damage when forcefully inserted, causing cloacal damage to the females.&lt;ref name=nine /&gt; In fowl, females can be physically injured during forceful copulations. Also, semen transferred from the males can contain pathogens and fecal matter, which can lead to disease and decrease female fitness.&lt;ref name="twenty one" /&gt; In elephant seals, physical injury happens very often. In fact, mating leads to 1 in every 1,000 female elephant seals getting killed.&lt;ref name=nineteen /&gt; Other species in which the females (and/or their offspring) are injured or even killed include lions, rodents, farm cats, crabeater seals, elephant seals, sea lions,&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt; wild Trinidadian guppies (''Poecilia reticulata''),&lt;ref name=eight /&gt; red-sided garter snakes (''Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis''),&lt;ref name=fourteen /&gt; and newts (''N. viridescens'').&lt;ref name=three /&gt;

Another cost is the excess energy and time expenditure that comes with mating. For example, female water striders, Gerridae,&lt;ref name=eighteen /&gt;  and marine snails of the genus ''Littorina'' 24 have to carry the males on their backs while they mate. First of all, this is a great loss of energy.&lt;ref name=eighteen /&gt; Second, both the male and the female are at a much greater risk of predation in this position.&lt;ref name=four /&gt; Furthermore, the time spent mating interferes with the time that could have been spent foraging&lt;ref name=four /&gt;  and feeding.&lt;ref name="twenty five"&gt;Darden, S. K., James, R., Ramnarine, I. W. &amp; Croft, D. P. [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/04/20/rspb.2009.0087.full Social implications of the battle of the sexes: sexual harassment disrupts female sociality and social recognition]. Proceedings: Biological Sciences 276, 2651–6 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, sexual coercion can lower body condition and immunity in ways other than physical damage. Harassment can lead to stress, which can result in weight loss, decreased immune function and energy stores, and less feeding, which has been seen in red-spotted newts.&lt;ref name=three /&gt; Furthermore, when females are constantly moving around to avoid violent males, they are not able to form female social ties (for example, [[Grévy's zebra]]/Equus grevyi).&lt;ref name="twenty five" /&gt; This also happens in species where herding males sometimes do not permit females to join their family in different groups, like in hamadryas baboons.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

===Indirect===

Indirect costs are those that affect females in the future. One such cost happens because sexual coercion does not allow females to choose the males they want to mate with, which are usually males that are higher quality, compatible, and/or have good genes that will increase their offspring’s survival and fitness. Coercion decreases this choice and can lead to their offspring having lower genetic quality. Studies of the rose bitterling (Rhodeus ocellatus), have shown that offspring of females with mate choice had higher survival rates than offspring of females that did not.&lt;ref name=four /&gt; Another ultimate cost comes from when males commit infanticide to obtain mating access. This loss of offspring leads to a decrease in fitness of females.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

==Female counter-adaptations==

===Anatomical protection===

As a response to sexual coercion and the costs that females face, one of their counter-adaptations is the evolution of anatomical protection.&lt;ref name=one /&gt; Females of some species, such as the water striders, developed morphological shields to protect their genitalia from males that want to forcefully copulate.&lt;ref name=thirteen /&gt; Some Gerridae females have also evolved abdominal spines and altered the shapes of their abdomens to make them less accessible to males.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

Waterfowl males of the family Aves: Anatidae [[Bird penis|have evolved a phallus]] to aid in coercion. This phallus everts out of the male body (when it’s time to mate) in a counter-clockwise coil. As a response, females have developed vaginal structures called dead end sacs and clockwise coils to protect themselves from forceful intromission.&lt;ref name=sixteen /&gt; Waterfowl females have evolved these “convoluted vaginal morphologies” to make it harder for males to insert themselves without the female’s consent.&lt;ref name="twenty six"&gt;Brennan, P. L. R., Clark, C. J. &amp; Prum, R. O. [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/12/18/rspb.2009.2139.full.html Explosive eversion and functional morphology of the duck penis supports sexual conflict in waterfowl genitalia]. Proceedings: Biological Sciences 277, 1309–14 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Male avoidance/habitat change===

Another female tactic to counter coercion is to try to avoid males that may cause them harm. To do this, females often change their habitats to get away from aggressive males, as is seen in wild Trinidadian guppies (''[[Poecilia reticulata]]'').&lt;ref name=eight /&gt; Female bottlenose dolphins behave in similar ways by moving into shallow waters where there are not too many males.&lt;ref name=eight /&gt; Other species that practice mate avoidance are ''[[Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis]]'', a species of damselfly, who often try to hide from large groups of males to avoid harassment.&lt;ref name=twenty /&gt;

Females of the marine intertidal periwinkle species (genus ''[[Littorina]]'') have another way to avoid males. Males usually recognize female snails by cues in their mucous trails. However, females try to mask their gender by altering these cues.&lt;ref name="twenty four"&gt;Johannesson, K., Saltin, S. H., Duranovic, I., Havenhand, J. N. &amp; Jonsson, P. R. [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0012005 Indiscriminate males: mating behaviour of a marine snail compromised by a sexual conflict?] PLoS ONE 5, e12005 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; In damselflies, females also try to mask their gender by mimicking male colors, which make them less attractive to males.&lt;ref name="twenty four" /&gt;

===Protection/alliances===

An effective female strategy is the employment of protection and alliances. Some females, such as wild Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulate) associate themselves with protective males who come to their rescue.&lt;ref name="twenty seven"&gt;Darden, S. K. &amp; Croft, D. P. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2610095/ Male harassment drives females to alter habitat use and leads to segregation of the sexes]. Biology letters 4, 449–51 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; This also occurs in hamadryas, savanna, and olive baboons, where males and females form friendships where the female gets male protection.&lt;ref name="twenty three" /&gt; In [[northern elephant seal]]s, the females give loud cries when mounted by undesirable or subordinate males, which attract dominant males to help. A similar phenomenon occurs in elephants, bighorn sheep, and fallow deer, where the females stay close to dominant males for protection.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

Females can also form alliances with other females for protection against aggressive males.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt; In African vervet monkeys, related females often form groups and “gang up” on males. Females of high rank create networks of female alliances; together, they fight away persistent suitors.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

===Resistance/fighting back===

Resisting males and fighting back are important tactics some species use to counter male coercion. Many females try to vigorously shake off males to dislodge them and flee; this is seen in females sepsid flies&lt;ref name=five /&gt;  and diving beetles.&lt;ref name=fifteen /&gt; Sepsids also try to bend their abdomen in such a way that males cannot copulate forcefully.&lt;ref name=five /&gt; Females are especially likely to fight back when they are protecting their offspring. This is seen in mountain gorillas, red howlers, and grey langur females, where males are often infanticidal.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

Female resistance has rarely been found to be effective. Male mammals and birds are usually larger than females, and the sheer size and strength difference makes this very difficult.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt; However, it has been observed in some species, such as squirrel monkeys, patas monkeys, vervets, and captive chimpanzees, that females can “gang up” on males when they are being aggressive. They will even try to protect a female in distress. Females have even been observed to kill immigrant males in wild red colobus monkeys.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

===Acceptance/submission===

Sometimes, females choose not to struggle and simply acquiesce to forceful matings. This can happen when they decide that the cost of resisting would be greater than the cost of mating.&lt;ref name=twenty /&gt; They use submission to avoid further harassment or aggression, which could end in death or injury.&lt;ref name="twenty five" /&gt; This is often seen in primate species, such as chimpanzees and hamadryas baboons.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

==Female benefits==

Some possible benefits of sexual coercion for females have been hypothesized.

===Proximate===

A possible proximate benefit for females is that sometimes after a male mates with a female, he becomes her mate. Then, he would defend and protect her.&lt;ref name=twenty /&gt; This is seen in many primate species.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

===Ultimate===

A possible benefit of sexual coercion that would come out in the long run is the “good genes” hypothesis.&lt;ref name=fifteen /&gt; If males can overcome a female’s resistance, then they must possess good genes that would increase the survival, mating success, and ultimately the fitness of her offspring. The hypothesis is that females can use the sexual coercion process to assess the quality of a male.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

==Consequences==

===Coevolutionary arms race===

Sexual coercion often leads to an intersexual coevolutionary arms race. This consists of females evolving adaptations to male advances and males evolving counter-adaptations as a response.&lt;ref name=two /&gt; Males persist in violent behavior, which favors the evolution of female resistance to defend themselves.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;&lt;ref name=six /&gt; In organisms where males have genitalia harmful to females, such as in certain insects, females tend to evolve thicker, less sensitive copulatory tracts.&lt;ref name=six /&gt; Also, they may evolve shield over their genital openings to prevent intromission.&lt;ref name=thirteen /&gt; Females of some species of water striders have evolved protection from forceful insemination, such as abdominal spines and downward-bent abdomens to make it harder for males to mate. In response, however, males have counter evolved, also changing the shape of their abdomens to those that would facilitate forceful mating.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

The male waterfowl (Aves: Anatidae) evolution of a phallus to forcefully copulate with females has led to counteradaptations in females in the form of vaginal structures called dead end sacs and clockwise coils. These structures make it harder for males to achieve intromission. The clockwise coils are significant because the male phallus everts out of their body in a counter-clockwise spiral; therefore, a clockwise vaginal structure would impede forceful copulation. Studies have shown that the longer a male’s phallus is, the more elaborate the vaginal structures were.&lt;ref name=sixteen /&gt;

===Speciation===

Speciation has been observed to be a possible consequence of sexual coercion. In diving beetle species family [[Dytiscidae]], an intersexual arms race occurs between males and females. Males have evolved suction cup structures on their forelegs to help grasp females; females have counter-evolved setose dorsal furrows to impede forceful copulation. This continuous evolution (in both the forward and reverse directions) has led to the recent speciation of ''A. japonicus'' and ''A. kishii'', where females of ''A. kishii'' have lost their dorsal furrows while those of ''A. japonicus'' have not.&lt;ref name=fifteen /&gt;

===Sexual dimorphism===

Sexual coercion can lead to sexual dimorphisms, in which males and females have significant morphological differences. For example, in some species, larger males are more successful in forcefully mating/insemination, leading to a higher fitness.&lt;ref name=two /&gt; In [[common garter snake|red-sided garter snake]]s, ''Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis'', it has been shown that heavier-bodied males were better courters and their size gave them an advantage over smaller bodied snakes.&lt;ref name=fourteen /&gt; This helps lead to an evolution of sexual dimorphism, with males larger than females.&lt;ref name=two /&gt; In other species, males that are smaller than females have higher fitness. Basically, many sex-specific morphological adaptations (for example, in Dytiscidae diving beetles, females have setose dorsal furrows that males do not and males have suction cups on their forelegs that females do not&lt;ref name=fifteen /&gt;) are sexual dimorphisms caused by sexual coercion.

'''Sophie Adelaide Radford de Meissner''' (November 17, 1854 – April 17, 1957) was an author, playwright, diplomat's wife, spiritualist and  socialite.&lt;ref name=SARD&gt;{{cite web|title=Grave Site: Sophie Radford de Meissner|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/58167177|work=Oak Hill Cemetery, Lot 916, Washington, D.C.|publisher=Find A Grave|accessdate=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood==
Sophie was born third of seven children to [[William Radford]] (September 9, 1809 – January 8, 1890), an officer in the [[United States Navy]], and Mary "Minnie" Elizabeth Lovell (April 12, 1829 – October 27, 1903).  All the Radford children were born in [[Morristown, New Jersey]] except Henry, who was born in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=Vermilye&gt;{{cite book|last=Vermilye|first=Anna S.|title=Ogden Family History|year=1906|publisher=The Orange Chronicle Company|location=Orange, New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|77}}

The Radfords resided with their in-laws, the Lovells, on Mount Kemble Avenue in a house previously owned by General John Doughty.&lt;ref name=Colles&gt;{{cite book|last=Colles|first=Julia Keese|title=Authors and Writers Associated with Morristown|year=1895|publisher=Vogt Brothers|location=Morristown, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|210–212}}  At the close of the [[American Civil War]], the Radfords moved to [[Washington, D.C.]]  Sophie attended Madam Burr's School near Fourteenth Street and New York Avenue where the language was [[French language|French]] only, regardless of the subject.  She took her [[grand tour]] when her father received command of the [[European Squadron]] in early 1869 and took his wife and six children to accompany him to Europe.

As Radford performed his naval duties in the Mediterranean Sea and European west coast, his family sailed with him to Spain, Portugal, [[Algiers]], France, the Netherlands, and Italy.  During 1870, Sophie and siblings attended school at [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]].  A month after the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], her father relinquished his command and went to Lausanne to retrieve his children believing any battles would be distant.  After arrival in [[Paris]], the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|surrender]] of the French Army on Sep 2, 1870, caused the Radford family to flee the [[Siege of Paris (1870–1871)|advancing Prussian Army]].  At [[Le Havre]] they negotiated commercial passage to the United States.&lt;ref name=DeMeissner&gt;{{cite book|last=de Meissner|first=Sophie Radford|title=Old Naval Days|year=1920|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|329–371}}

==Marriage and family==
On February 22, 1877, Sophie fell from her horse while riding in [[Rock Creek Park]] and fractured her skull. She remained unconscious into March. Among callers to the family was Waldemar de Meissner, first secretary of the Russian [[Legation]]. They married November 20, 1877 in two ceremonies: first at the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] and then at the Radford residence on 1736 (now 1734) N Street NW in the [[DuPont Circle]] neighborhood.  Attendees included [[President of the United States|President]] [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] and [[William Tecumseh Sherman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Our Regular Correspondent|title=An International Wedding: The Daughter of an American Admiral Wedded to a Russian Nobleman|newspaper=Unknown; from a clipping|date=November 20, 1877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the next 20 years, de Meissner's diplomatic career took them to [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Bern]] and [[Lisbon]].  Their only child was a son, Alexandre (also known as Sacha), born September 24, 1878. Sacha was educated in a military college in Russia and rose to the rank of [[Cornet (military rank)|cornet]] in the 44th Regiment of [[Dragoon]]s of the [[Imperial Russian Army]].&lt;ref name="Death Notice"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mme. de Meissner, 102, Writer, Socialite, Dies|newspaper=Unknown; from a clipping|date=April 16, 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1896, Sophie travelled to Russia to visit her son. Waldemar remained in Lisbon, but contracted pneumonia and died during her absence, on April 17, 1896. Sophie moved back to Saint Petersburg to be near her son, accepting a position as [[lady-in-waiting]] to another widow, the [[dowager]] [[List of Russian consorts|Empress of Russia]], [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Maria Feodorovna]]. Three years later, Sacha contracted a throat infection and died on August 28, 1899.

The Russian play [[The Death of Ivan the Terrible|"Ivan the Terrible"]] was written circa 1866 about [[Ivan IV Vasilyevich]], who ruled as the first [[List of Russian rulers#Tsars of Russia|Tsar of All the Russias]]. The play was one of a trilogy written by Count [[Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy]], a cousin of Count [[Leo Tolstoy]]. She attended a production of the play in Russia and determined to translate it into English. In 1901, Sophie sent the play to theatrical agent [[Elisabeth Marbury]] to show to actor [[Richard Mansfield]].

Mansfield signed a contract with Sophie February 1, 1902 to star in and produce the play. The play premiered March 1, 1904 on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]] with Mansfield performing the title row. Mansfield kept the role in his repertoire until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilstach|first=Paul|title=Richard Mansfield: the Man and the Actor|year=1909|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|406–409}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Winter|first=William|title=Life and Art of Richard Mansfield|year=1910|publisher=Moffat, Yard and Company|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|272–274}}

In 1902 during a return trip to Russia, she translated the second play of Tolstoy's trilogy, [[Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich]].&lt;ref name=NoDead&gt;{{cite book|last=deMeissner|first=Sophie|title=There Are No Dead|year=1912|publisher=Sherman, French &amp; Company|location=Boston, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|39}}

==Spiritualism==
Sophie became a proponent of [[spiritualism]].  Her book ''There Are No Dead'' is a collection of conversations with deceased family, friends and others. The first entry was recorded twelve hours after the death of her son. She made newspaper headlines in 1912 when she requested an audience with President [[William Howard Taft]] after the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]. She said she had a message to deliver from a victim of the sinking, [[Archibald Butt]], who was an aide and close friend to Taft.&lt;ref name=NoDead/&gt;{{RP|102–112}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maj. Butt's return – spiritually, of course|url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/061798/nef_allfoley.html|work=The Florida Times-Union|accessdate=December 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other victims of the Titanic sinking and also associated with Taft, [[William Thomas Stead]] (also a spiritualist) and [[Francis Davis Millet]] are said to have communicated with Sophie.&lt;ref name=Whiting&gt;{{cite book|last=Whiting|first=Lilian|title=The Adventure Beautiful|year=1917|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston, Massachusetts|pages=101–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
During a visit to Saint Petersburg in 1905, she served in the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] to tend casualties from the [[Russo-Japanese War]].&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=George|title=Party for Mme. de Meissner Recalls Her 100 Years of Life|newspaper=The Evening Star, Washington D.C.|date=November 18, 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles in the society pages of Washington D.C. from the early 1900s mention her at gatherings as a speaker for Russian culture, clothing, etc.  Her 80th birthday celebration was noticed in the society pages of the Miami Daily Herald.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jarvis|first=Jean|title=Capital Events Now in Honor of Debutantes|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&amp;dat=19341125&amp;id=MSJVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Zj0NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6463,3314980|accessdate=December 26, 2013|newspaper=Miami Daily News|date=November 25, 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sophie spent the last seven years of her life in the Washington D.C. Home For Incurables. At her 100th birthday party, 40 guests, including 3 nieces, attended.&lt;ref name="Death Notice"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt;

Letters to her niece Edith Lovell (Coyle) Matthes, wife of [[François E. Matthes]], are stored in the François Matthes papers collection, Carton 3, Folder 51, in the [[Bancroft Library]] at [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finding Aid to the François Matthes Papers, 1874–1965, bulk 1900–1950|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf7199n8zj/entire_text/|work=Collection Number: BANC MSS C-B 821|publisher=The Regents of the University of California|accessdate=December 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum is named for legendary astronaut and flight pioneer Lt. Gen. [[Thomas P. Stafford]], a native of Weatherford.  Graduating from the [[United States Naval Academy|US Naval Academy]], Stafford is a recipient of the [[Congressional Space Medal of Honor]]. A veteran of four space flights, he piloted [[Gemini 6A|Gemini VI]], and commanded [[Gemini 9A|Gemini IX]], [[Apollo 10]], and the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] mission.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.travelok.com/listings/view.profile/id.7195 accessed on 6-13-10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibits==
The center boasts one of the few actual [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II]] [[launch vehicle]]s on display. The huge rocket body crosses the back of a display gallery from one side of the building to the other.  Numerous items acquired from the [[National Air and Space Museum|Smithsonian]] and on display include: a [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] [[flight suit]], [[space food]], [[Survival kit|survival items]] flown to the [[Moon]] on [[Apollo program|Apollo]] [[Apollo 11|11]], and the actual flight pressure suit Stafford wore on [[Apollo 10]], the first flight of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] to the Moon. One display includes the hatch through which U.S. astronauts and Russian [[Astronaut|cosmonauts]] docked and greeted each other in space.  Stafford is pictured reaching through the hatch shaking hands with a Russian [[List of cosmonauts|cosmonaut.]]  The actual uniforms that the two astronauts were wearing at the time are also on display.

Other exhibits include retired aircraft, such as a Russian [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21R]] and an [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]]. Full-size replicas displayed include the [[Wright Flyer]], ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]'', Apollo [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module]], and [[Gemini spacecraft]]. The museum also features the Rose &amp; Tom Luczo Educational Center that features a [[Flight simulator|flight simulation computer]] lab, kids library, and a  [https://www.talonsimulations.com/ Talon A3 Motion-Based Flight Simulator] that runs [[X-Plane (simulator)|X-Plane 11]] and [[Microsoft Flight Simulator X]]. Also on display is a [[TP-82 Cosmonaut survival pistol]] which was given to Stafford by [[Alexey Leonov]].

As of March 5, 2018, the museum has acquired an [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II]], also known as the "Warthog." It is on display outside of the museum.  In July 2018, the [[Gemini 6A]] spacecraft was moved to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://kfor.com/2018/07/31/historic-gemini-vi-spacecraft-moved-to-oklahoma-museum/ KFOR news]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stafford_museum_move /&gt;

'''Sérgio Fernando Paranhos Fleury''' (19 May 1933 – 1 May 1979) was a [[Brazil]]ian police deputy during the [[Brazilian military government]]. He was chief of '''DOPS''', the Brazilian so called "Department for Political and Social Order", that had a major role during the years of the [[Brazilian military government|Brazilian military dictatorship]].

== Activities ==
He became known for his participation in [[torture]] and extrajudicial killings during the [[Brazilian military government|Brazilian military dictatorship]].
Several prisoner reports and witness testimonies indicate that he consistently used torture during interrogations during the time of the military regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://redeglobo.globo.com/Linhadireta/0,26665,VYJ0-5259-235245,00.html Linha Direta Justiça - Envolvidos - Rede Globo- (Portuguese)], accessdate: 5/3/2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istoe.com.br/reportagens/43147_HISTORIA+MACABRA ISTOÉ Independente - Brasil- (Portuguese)], accessdate: 5/3/2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/em-sao-paulo-operacao-tenta-tirar-nomes-da-ditadura-das-ruas-8404712 Em São Paulo, operação tenta tirar nomes da ditadura das ruas - Jornal O Globo- (Portuguese)], accessdate: 5/4/2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleury himself was directly involved in the torture of [[Frei Tito|Tito de Alencar Lima]], known as [[Frei Tito|Friar Tito]], a [[catholic]] [[friar]] who fought against the military regime in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psfilmfest.org/festival/film/detail.aspx?id=19652&amp;FID=35 Baptism of Blood (Batismo de Sangue) | 2008 Palm Springs International Film Festival | Helvécio Ratton | Brazil], accessdate: 5/4/2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adital.com.br/freitito/por/apresentacao.html Frei Tito memorial on-line (Portuguese)], {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817204634/http://www.adital.com.br/freitito/por/apresentacao.html |date=2013-08-17 }} accessdate: 5/3/2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides using torture, Fleury was investigated and denounced by Prosecutors [[Hélio Bicudo]] and [[Dirceu de Mello]] for murders committed by the [[Death squad|Death Squadron]]. The Public Prosecutor of São Paulo found him to be the main leader of the Death Squadron which was responsible for innumerable extrajudicial killings in Brazil. Although convicted, he did not serve time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lab.org.uk/brazils-truth-commission LAB - Brazil's Truth Commission], accessdate: 5/4/2015&lt;/ref&gt;

His biography by Brazilian journalist [[Percival de Souza]], titled "Autópsia do Medo", details his involvement with torture and several extrajudicial killings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oabsp.org.br/noticias/2006/12/05/3956/ Percival de Souza  — OAB SP], accessdate: 5/3/2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Aut%C3%B3psia_do_medo.html?id=mOQSAQAAIAAJ Autópsia do medo: vida e morte do delegado Sérgio Paranhos Fleury - Percival de Souza - Google Books], accessdate: 5/3/2015&lt;/ref&gt;
He was chosen as the deputy of the year two times, in 1974 and 1976, and received an award from the governor Abreu Sodré in 1969.

He was responsible for the killing of communist leader [[Carlos Marighella]] in 1969, and for the attack against members of the [[Communist Party of Brazil]] in 1976, who had been labelled terrorists by the military regime.

==Death and legacy==
According to his wife, he drowned while out on his boat on May 1, 1979.

A street in the city of [[São Carlos]] was named after him until 2009, when protests resulted in legislation that changed the name of the street to [[Frei Tito]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://diariooficialdalapa.wordpress.com/2013/04/24/rua-frei-tito-a-antiga-rua-denominada-doutor-sergio-fleury/ Rua Frei Tito, a antiga Rua denominada Doutor Sérgio Fleury | Diário Oficial da Lapa (por CARLOS MINNITI)], accessdate: 5/4/2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://revistapiaui.estadao.com.br/edicao-20/esquina/torturador-na-via-publica Torturador na via pública | piauí_20 &amp;#91;revista piauí&amp;#93; (Portuguese)], accessdate: 5/4/2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,sao-paulo-tem-29-ruas-com-referencia-a-militares-ou-a-ditadura,1626072 São Paulo tem 29 ruas com referência a militares ou à ditadura - Política - Estadão (Portuguese)], accessdate: 5/4/2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tagorians''' or '''Tagoryans''' (тагоряне) are a fictional, lizard-like alien race from the [[Noon Universe]] created by [[Boris and Arkady Strugatsky|Strugatsky brothers]]. Their homeworld is [[Minor Planets of Noon Universe#Tagora|Tagora]] (Тагора), a planet discovered by the end of the 21st century. An official contact with Tagorians, however, was registered in 2122 AD and a full-scaled diplomatic relationship has been established two years later, as soon as human scientists (led by professor ''Sugimoto'') managed to decode and interpret Tagorian language.

Tagorians are mentioned in ''"[[An Attempt to Escape]]"'' and ''"[[Beetle in an Anthill]]"''.

==Appearance==
Tagorians are a non-humanoid sentient race whose outward appearance resembles that of giant [[lizards]]. At the early stages of their lives all Tagorians pass through the [[larva]]e phase.

==Technology==
Tagorians are very advanced technologically although they spend over 60% of their scientific resources to predict all possible consequences of inventing every new technology. This is characteristical for Tagorians to pay greatest attention to anything new (and not only in science). It is known that Tagorians have only public transportation and no aviation but also they have a well-developed wired communication network.

At some point, Tagorians engineered a race of non-sentient "pseudo-humanoids". When Earth's explorers first arrived on the planet, they mistook them for a local sentient race.

==Background==
It is known that aeons ago Tagorians underwent a global genetic enhancement (hence the larva phase), so in some ways they are not the original Tagorians who were a true product of normal evolution. Some believe that the [[Wanderers (Noon Universe)|Wanderers]] were behind that genetic enhancement, but this was never confirmed.

==Tagorians and Humans==
Tagorians were the first alien race the Mankind made contact with, about eleven years before the official contact with [[Leoniders]]. Although this contact promised benefits for both sides, all diplomatic negotiations were cancelled in 2138 after an expedition to EN-9173 system discovered the so-called "Sarcophagus" and the "[[Stepchildren Case]]" started. The Tagorians believed that those discoveries indicated that humanity was "tainted" by the Wanderers.

It is mentioned in ''"An Attempt to Escape"'' that there is a human resident (or spy) on Tagora. His name is presumably ''Benny Durov'' (''Бенни Дуров'') and he is a [[progressors|progressor]] working under cover on the planet to study Tagorian technology.

"'''The Hunt'''" is episode 84 of the American television [[anthology series]] ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''. It originally aired on January 26, 1962 on [[CBS]].

==Opening narration==
{{cquote|An old man and a [[hound]]-[[dog]] named Rip, off for an evening's pleasure in quest of raccoon. Usually, these evenings end with one tired old man, one battle-scarred hound dog, and one or more extremely dead [[raccoon]]s, but as you may suspect, that will not be the case tonight. These hunters won't be coming home from the hill. They're headed for the backwoods—of The Twilight Zone.}}

==Plot==
Hyder Simpson is an elderly [[mountain man]] who lives with his wife Rachel and his [[hound]] dog Rip in the backwoods. Rachel does not like having the dog indoors, but Rip saved Hyder's life once and Hyder refuses to part with him. Rachel has seen some bad omens recently and warns Hyder not to go [[raccoon hunting]] that night. When Rip dives into a pond after a raccoon, Hyder jumps in after him. Only the raccoon comes up out of the water. The next morning, Hyder and Rip wake up next to the pond. When they return home, Hyder finds that Rachel, the [[preacher]], and the neighbors cannot hear or see him, and are tending to the burial of both him and Rip.

Walking along the road, Hyder and Rip encounter an unfamiliar fence and follow it. They come to a gate tended by a man, who explains that Hyder can enter the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]] of the afterlife. Told that Rip cannot enter and will be taken to a special afterlife for dogs, Hyder angrily declines the offer of entry and decides to keep walking along the "Eternity Road," saying, "Any place that's too high-falutin' for Rip is too fancy for me."

Later, Hyder and Rip stop to rest and are met by a young man, who introduces himself as an angel dispatched to find them and bring them to [[Heaven]]. When Hyder recounts his previous encounter, the angel tells him that the gate is actually the entrance to [[Hell]]. The gatekeeper had stopped Rip from entering because Rip would have smelled the [[Fire and brimstone|brimstone]] inside and warned Hyder that something was wrong. The angel says, "You see, Mr. Simpson, a man, well, he'll walk right into Hell with both eyes open. But even the [[Devil]] can't fool a dog!" As the angel leads Hyder along the Eternity Road toward Heaven, he tells Hyder that a square dance and raccoon hunt are scheduled for that night. He also assures Hyder that Rachel, who will soon be coming along the road, will not be misled into entering Hell.

==Closing narration==
{{cquote|Travelers to unknown regions would be well advised to take along the family dog. He could just save you from entering the wrong gate. At least, it happened that way once—in a mountainous area of the Twilight Zone.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2687">'''The Infinite Way''' is a spiritual movement and activity created by 20th century [[United States|American]] healer and lecturer [[Joel S. Goldsmith]] (1892&amp;ndash;1964). According to Goldsmith, the Infinite Way is a spiritual teaching consisting of principles which anyone may follow and practice, irrespective of their religious affiliation. The Infinite Way reveals the nature of [[God]] to be one infinite power, intelligence, and love; the nature of the individual being to be one with God's qualities and character, expressed in infinite forms and variety; and the nature of the discords of this world to be a misconception of God's expression of Himself in His universe."&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, J.S. (1992) ''The Art of Spiritual Healing.'' HarperCollins. p 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Goldsmith started teaching the lessons of the Infinite Way in 1940 and in 1947 published the book, ''The Infinite Way''.&lt;ref&gt;Beverely, J.A. (2009) ''Nelson's Illustrated Guide to Religions.'' Thomas Nelson Inc. p 108.&lt;/ref&gt; He began teaching and lecturing extensively that year, first in [[New England]], then on the [[West Coast of the United States]] and finally in Hawaii. In 1950, Goldsmith began recording his lectures world-wide.&lt;ref&gt;Melton, J.G. (2003) ''Encyclopedia of American Religions.'' Gale. p 743-44.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Framework ==
"'The Infinite Way' is not a religion... but an experience in spiritual living. There is no organization, no structure, no rules, no church buildings, no congregation, no dues, and no bureaucracy. 'The Infinite Way' is composed solely of the inspired works of Joel based on his revelations and experiences: the more than fifty-one books he authored, and the more than twelve hundred hours of his lectures and classes."&lt;ref&gt;Covell, O.D. (2005) ''Taking the Path to Spiritual Awakening.'' AuthorHouse. p IX.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his life Joel Goldsmith asked for no remuneration for his healing work but he did take it if offered. He also did not participate in overt advertisement of his books and tapes, knowing instead that people would find them as they needed them.&lt;ref&gt;Sinkler, L. (1973) ''The Spiritual Journey of Joel S. Goldsmith, Modern Mystic.'' Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Macdonough, Jr.''' (December 31, 1783 – November 10, 1825) was an early-19th-century American naval officer noted for his roles in the first [[Barbary War]] and the War of 1812. He was the son of a revolutionary officer, Thomas Macdonough, Sr. who lived near [[Middletown, Delaware]]. He was the sixth child from a family of ten siblings and was raised in the countryside. He entered naval life at an early age, receiving a [[Midshipman#United States Navy .281794.E2.80.931845.29|midshipman's commission]] at the age of sixteen.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lewis2|Lewis, 1924]] p.163&lt;/ref&gt; Serving with [[Stephen Decatur]] at Tripoli, he was a member of "Preble's Boys", a select group of U.S. naval officers who served under the command of [[Edward Preble|Commodore Preble]] during the [[First Barbary War]]. Macdonough achieved fame during the [[War of 1812]], commanding the American naval forces that defeated the British navy at the [[Battle of Plattsburgh#Naval battle|Battle of Lake Champlain]], part of the larger [[Battle of Plattsburgh]], which helped lead to an end to that war.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Skaggs|Skaggs, 2006]] pp.62-64&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC left}}

==Early life==
[[Major Thomas Macdonough Senior]], Captain Thomas Macdonough's father, lived at a farm referred to as "[[Comdr. Thomas MacDonough House|The Trap]]" (also spelled 'Trapp'), in the county of New Castle, [[Delaware]]. He received a contemporary education here but it remains uncertain if he attended any sort of formal schools or was taught by family members or a tutor. He was a major in the [[Continental Army]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barnes1896|Barnes, 1896]] pp.209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Skaggs|Skaggs, 2006]] pp.128&lt;/ref&gt; Macdonough's great-grandfather, also named Thomas Macdonough, lived in Ireland in the Salmon Leap district not far from [[Dublin]]. He was of the Protestant faith and succeeding generations were connected with the Episcopal Church in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rodney Macdonough|Macdonough, 1909]] p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Macdonough Jr. was born in a small town near [[Odessa, Delaware|Odessa]], which later was named [[MacDonough, Delaware]], in his honor. He was employed in [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]] as a clerk upon the return of his brother James, who lost a leg in a naval battle with a French vessel in 1799 during the [[Quasi-War]] with France.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Skaggs|Skaggs, 2006]] p.27&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Macdonough requested a commission with the [[United States Navy]] with the assistance of Senator Latimer from the state of Delaware.

Macdonough was a tall, dignified man with a commanding character which suited him well for military service. He was a devoutly religious man of Episcopal faith, as were his parents and greater family. He was known to adhere to a set of steadfast principles in his personal and military life.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Frost|Frost, 1845]] p.304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=macd&gt;[[#Rodney Macdonough|Macdonough, 1909]] p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before joining the Navy, Thomas, Jr., for unknown reasons, changed the spelling of his last name from "McDonough" to "Macdonough.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Frost|Frost, 1845]] pp.293-294&lt;/ref&gt;
On May 27, 1800, at the age of sixteen, Macdonough secured a warrant and served as a [[midshipman]] aboard the 24-gun {{USS|Ganges|1794|6}}, a [[corvette]] class ship, converted over from a [[Cargo ship|merchantman]] vessel and outfitted as a [[man-of-war]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Skaggs|Skaggs, 2006]] pp.22-30&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the command of Captain John Mullowny, ''Ganges'' then set sail for the West Indies. During operations there she captured three French merchant ships between May and September. When hostilities between the United States and France had finally ended the following year on October 20, 1801, Macdonough was assigned to {{USS|Constellation|1797|6}}, a 38-gun frigate. Commanded by [[Alexander Murray (1755–1821)|Alexander Murray]], ''Constellation'' was about to embark on its mission in the [[Mediterranean]] sea. While serving aboard ''Constellation'' he received a thorough education from Murray in seamanship, navigation, gunnery, and other nautical sciences towards improving his service as a junior officer.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Skaggs|Skaggs, 2006]] p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Barbary War==
[[File:Macdonough3.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Thomas Macdonough&lt;br/&gt;Engraving by [[John Wesley Jarvis]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
Aboard ''Constellation'' in January 1802, Macdonough served with distinction in naval operations against [[Tripoli]] during the [[First Barbary War]]. This was the same ship that his brother James had served on a few years earlier.&lt;ref name="Heidler311"&gt;[[#Heidler|Heidler, 2004]] p.311&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803, Navy Secretary [[Robert Smith (Cabinet member)|Robert Smith]] selected Macdonough to serve aboard {{USS|Philadelphia|1799|6}}, a 38-gun frigate, commanded by [[William Bainbridge]]. Macdonough was aboard this ship when it captured the Moroccan ship ''Mirboka'' on August 26, 1803. Shortly before ''Philadelphia'' ran aground and was consequently captured by the Tripolitans, Macdonough had gone ashore on leave.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Skaggs|Skaggs, 2006]] p.41&lt;/ref&gt; He was reassigned on October 31 to the 12-gun sloop {{USS|Enterprise|1799|6}} under the command of Lieutenant [[Stephen Decatur]]. Macdonough volunteered to join Decatur's [[Stephen Decatur#Burning of the USS Philadelphia|successful raid]] into the harbor of Tripoli. On February 6, 1804, they succeeded in burning and destroying ''Philadelphia''. Having just served on ''Philadelphia'', Macdonough's familiarity made his role in the operation a crucial one. For his heroic actions he was promoted to acting Lieutenant.&lt;ref name="Heidler311"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#MacKenzie|MacKenzie, 1846]] pp.67-68&lt;/ref&gt;

Macdonough also accompanied Decatur when they hunted down the murderer of Decatur's brother,  [[James Decatur]], who was killed by the commander when he boarded a Tripolitan ship that had pretended to be surrendering. After catching up with and pulling alongside the ship involved, Decatur was the first to board the enemy vessel with Midshipman Macdonough at his heels along with nine volunteer crew members.  Decatur, Macdonough and the rest of the crew were outnumbered 5 to 1 but were determined, organized and kept their form, fighting furiously side by side, killing the commander and most of the crew along with capturing the Tripolitan ship.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abbot|Abbot, W. John, 1886]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other service==
After winning promotion to Lieutenant for his participation in the raid on ''Philadelphia'', Macdonough served aboard the 18-gun [[brig]] {{USS|Syren|1803|6}}, the same vessel assisting {{USS|Intrepid|1798|2}} at Tripoli. Assisting [[Isaac Hull]], he then supervised the construction of several gunboats in [[Middletown, Connecticut]]. In January 1806, Macdonough was promoted to a commission of Lieutenant.

As commander of the 18-gun {{USS|Wasp|1807|6}}, Macdonough served patrolling waters near Great Britain and various points in the Mediterranean. He returned to America and enforced the [[Embargo Act]], and the Atlantic blockade, from 1807 and 1808.

In 1809, he served with Captain Smith aboard {{USS|Essex|1799|6}}, but later requested reassignment.  Macdonough returned to Middletown, Connecticut, and was placed in charge of the several gunboats there.  In Middletown Macdonough met his future wife, Ann Shaler.

With the repeal of the Embargo Act, the role of the navy became less active, with a fifth of its officers away on furlough at half pay. Macdonough remained in Middleton for only eight months before requesting a furlough in June 1810. From 1810 to 1812, Macdonough took a leave of absence for two years as the captain of a British [[Cargo ship|merchantman]] that was en route to India.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Skaggs|Skaggs, 2006]], p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

==War of 1812==
{{main|War of 1812}}
At the beginning of the [[War of 1812]] American naval forces were very small, allowing the British to make many advances into the [[Great Lakes]] and northern New York [[:File:Grlakes lawrence map.png|waterways]]. The roles played by commanders like [[Oliver Hazard Perry]] at [[Lake Erie]] and [[Isaac Chauncey]] at [[Lake Ontario]] and Thomas Macdonough at [[Lake Champlain]] all proved vital to the naval effort on the lakes that was largely responsible for preserving American territory during that war.

Assigned to USS ''Constellation'', as [[First lieutenant#U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard|First Lieutenant]], Macdonough returned to active service just prior to the outbreak of the war in June 1812. The ship at this time was being outfitted and supplied in Washington, DC, for its next mission, but was still months away from being ready. Moreover, it did not escape from the British blockade at the [[Chesapeake Bay]] until 1814.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Malcomson|Malcomson, 2006]] p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

Requesting transfer to a more active front, Macdonough was assigned the command of a squadron of gunboats defending [[Portland, Maine]]. His stay there was brief when he received new orders from Secretary of the Navy [[Paul Hamilton (politician)|Hamilton]]. Macdonough was reassigned to [[Burlington, Vermont]] to command U.S. naval forces in Lake Champlain in October 1812.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidler|Heidler, 2004]] p.312&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking leave from his assignment at Lake Champlain Macdonough married Lucy Anne Shaler on December 12, 1812, at the Christ Church in Middletown by Bishop Abraham Jarvis.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Skaggs|Skaggs, 2006]] p.56&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 1813, Macdonough sent Lieutenant Sidney Smith with {{USS|Growler|1812 sloop|6}}, along with Sailing Master Loomis with {{USS|Eagle|1812|6}}, to guard against British advances at the Canada–US border at the [[Richelieu River]]. The impatient Smith sailed into British waters, an action which was contrary to his orders, and at once found himself overpowered by the British squadron. After enduring four hours of battle, Smith was finally forced into surrendering.

===Lake Champlain Campaign===
On July 24, 1813, Macdonough was promoted to the rank of [[master commandant]].

When the war began in 1812, there were only two American naval vessels on [[Lake Champlain]], {{USS|Growler|1812 sloop|2}} and {{USS|Eagle|1812|2}}, each carrying ten guns with a crew of fifty. On June 3, 1813, the two vessels were pursuing a British gunboat but were caught up in a strong current that prevented them from maintaining their heading and position, giving the advantage to British forces, resulting in their capture. The loss of the two and only American vessels on the lake gave undisputed control of this strategic waterway to the British. This prompted Macdonough to begin the construction of the [[corvette]] {{USS|Saratoga|1814|2}} and new sloop {{USS|Eagle|1814|2}} and several gunboats at the shipyard in Otter Creek at [[Vergennes, Vermont]]. While construction was underway, {{USS|Ticonderoga|1814|2}}, a schooner, was being converted to a warship carrying seventeen guns.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidler|Heidler, 2004]] p.269&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1814 the ice covering Lake Champlain, which usually lasted well into May, began melting and breaking up early in April. Macdonough feared that the British, who he assumed by now knew of the ship construction going on there, would use the opportunity to capture or destroy the vessels being built. Having learned of Macdonough's ship building activity, the British constructed a heavily armed brig and five large gunboats at [[Île aux Noix|'Isle Aux Noix']] over the winter.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Malcomson|Malcomson, 2006]] p.150&lt;/ref&gt; As Macdonough had predicted, British forces attempted to navigate the lake.  Because of unfavorable winds, the British commander [[Daniel Pring]], whose forces were based at Isle Aux Noix in upper Lake Champlain, didn't complete the 65-mile journey to Otter Creek until May 14. Upon arrival, Pring situated his squadron in the lake just off Otter Creek with eight [[galley]]s and a [[bomb vessel|bomb sloop]], preventing the American forces' passage north and to the sea.&lt;ref name=mahon&gt;[[#Mahon|Mahon 1909]], p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Malcomson|Malcomson, 2006]] p.404&lt;/ref&gt; For one hour, Commander Pring maintained a heavy fire. However, Macdonough had learned of the attack beforehand from his observers on land and had prepared a defense in anticipation of this likely event. Using the guns of his ships, he had them landed on shore at the mouth of Otter Creek.  Macdonough constructed an [[artillery battery]] with which he repelled the attack and drove the [[Royal Navy]] back to Isle Aux Noix in Canadian waters by autumn. With the way now clear, Macdonough's squadron sailed out of Otter Creek and made its way to [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh, New York]], where it anchored just off shore in anticipation of the next and inevitable British advance.&lt;ref name=maclay&gt;[[#Maclay|Maclay, 1894]] pp. 26–28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Plattsburgh===
{{main|Battle of Plattsburgh}}
[[File:NH 51480-KN.jpg|thumb|260px|Macdonough's ''Saratoga'' (left) and ''Eagle'' (right) engaging ''Confiance.'']]
By late August 1814, approximately 10,000 British troops under the command of [[George Prevost]] had assembled near Montreal at the Canada–US border. Many of these soldiers were well-trained, regular troops who served under Wellington, already battle hardened from their recent defeat of Napoleon in Europe. Macdonough had little naval combat experience. His service in the Barbary wars was limited to gunboat actions and the capture and destruction of ''Philadelphia''. He had yet to experience a ship-to-ship action, being on a vessel that was receiving broadsides, surrounded by dead and wounded men. Regardless of this lack in experience, Macdonough well understood that defending and holding Plattsburgh, thus not allowing [[Alexander Macomb (general)|General Macomb's]] troops to be surrounded by British forces on land and water, was vital to winning the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Skaggs|Skaggs, 2006]] p.123&lt;/ref&gt;
On September 3, Prevost's army crossed the border and marched into northern New York State, advancing on [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh]].  The city was held by General Macomb with less than 2,000 regular troops, with the support of the New York militia, under the command of General Mooers and the Vermont volunteers, under the command of General Strong.&lt;ref name=holden&gt;[[#Holden|Holden, 1914]], p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Prevost who had arrived in earnest was yet aware of enemy strength and positions and refused to march on the city itself without adequate naval support to divert the American forces. A squadron under the command of Commodore [[George Downie]] sailed southward into the open lake to engage the American fleet commanded by Macdonough. In anticipation of the British fleet, Macdonough strategically positioned and anchored his fleet a short distance off shore from Plattsburgh and made further preparations for Downie's advance.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Maclay|Maclay, 1894]] pp.26-28&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 11, Downie's forces departed from Isle-aux-Noix and sailed southward along the Richelieu River into Lake Champlain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Roosevelt|Roosevelt, 1889]] p.376&lt;/ref&gt; Upon encountering Macdonough's fleet waiting in Plattsburgh harbor, Downie immediately attacked, achieving the upper hand early in the battle, largely because of the great firepower of the 36-gun British flagship {{HMS|Confiance|1814|6}}. As the battle unfolded, the British squadron incurred considerable damage from close-range cannon fire. In the process an American cannon shot blasted a British cannon off its mount, crushing and killing Downie.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lewis2|Lewis, 1924]] p.175&lt;/ref&gt; Through use of [[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail#Fighting at anchor|anchor and cable tactics]], Macdonough in command of {{USS|Saratoga|1814|2}} was able to swing his ship around the undamaged side of the British flagship, gaining firepower superiority over the British fleet. As the poorly and hurriedly equipped ''Confiance'' with its inexperienced crew attempted the same tactic, Macdonough seized the opportunity and fired a broadside, severely damaging the British vessel and forcing its surrender.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidler|Heidler, 2004]] pp.160, 290&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Malcomson|Malcomson, 2006]] p.149&lt;/ref&gt; Having removed the British flagship from action, the American forces captured or destroyed the remaining larger ships in the fleet.

Both commanders would have seen the parallels of Macdonough's anchorage on Lake Champlain to that of the French under Vice Admiral [[François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers|Francois-Paul Brueys]], opposing British Rear Admiral Sir [[Horatio Nelson]], at the [[Battle of the Nile]] in Aboukir Bay on August 1, 1798. A study of Nelson's battles was part of the professional knowledge expected of naval commanders.  But Macdonough did all that Brueys did not. He expected to take advantage of the prevailing winds on Lake Champlain that constrained Downie's axis of approach. "Because nearly every circumstance that worked to Nelson's advantage proved disadvantageous to Downie, the Battle of Lake Champlain is sometimes called the ''False Nile''" by the English.&lt;ref&gt;[[#potter|Potter and Nimitz, 1960]] p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; The British naval historian [[William Laird Clowes]] regarded Macdonough's ''False Nile'' victory as "a most notable feat, one which, on the whole, surpassed that of any other captain of either navy in this war."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[#hagan|Hagan]], p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  Clowes echoed Roosevelt's view, "The British sailors on the lakes were as good as our own, but no better. None of their commanders compare with Macdonough."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Roosevelt|Roosevelt, 1889]] p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

After the battle, Macdonough returned to the British officers their swords.  Captain Pring wrote:

{{quote|I have much satisfaction in making you acquainted with the humane treatment the wounded have received from Commodore Macdonough; they were immediately removed to his own hospital on Crab Island, and furnished with every requisite. His generous and polite attention to myself, the officers, and men, will ever hereafter be gratefully remembered.&lt;ref name=rooz&gt;[[#Roosevelt|Roosevelt, 1889]] p.398&lt;/ref&gt;|Captain Pring}}

Upon wresting control of Lake Champlain from the British, Macdonough's victory forced the British forces to retire to Canada, the actions of which left no grounds for any claims by the British for any territory when the [[Treaty of Ghent|Ghent peace conference]] convened on December 24. For his success in forcing the retreat of Prevost into Canada, Macdonough was duly promoted to the rank of Captain. He was also awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] at this time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lewis2|Lewis, 1924]] pp.191-184&lt;/ref&gt; He was also awarded by the State of New York a thousand acres of land in Cayuga county, with another hundred acres awarded to him from the State of Vermont, making the once modest commodore a wealthy man.&lt;ref name=hickey&gt;[[#Hickey|Hickey, 1989 p. 193.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later days==
[[File:1834 USS Constitution AmericanMagazine v1 Boston.png|thumb|260px|{{USS|Constitution}}, painted 1934]]
Macdonough relieved [[Isaac Hull]] of command of the [[Portsmouth Navy Yard]] on  July 1, 1815. In command there for three years, he returned to the [[Mediterranean Squadron (United States)|Mediterranean Squadron]] in 1818 and was appointed commander of {{USS|Guerriere|1814|6}}, a [[frigate]] of 44 guns and later transported [[George W. Campbell|Hon. G.W. Campbell]] to the Court of St. Petersburg in Russia stopping in ports in England, Elsineur and Copenhagen along the way.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rodney Macdonough|Macdonough, 1909]] pp.30-31&lt;/ref&gt;

In April Macdonough was stricken with [[tuberculosis]] but he still remained on duty for as long as possible. After returning to America later in the year, he was given command of {{USS|Ohio|1820|6}} a [[ship of the line]], bearing 74 guns under construction in New York harbor. From 1818 to 1823 Macdonough served as her captain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lewis2|Lewis, 1924]] p.129&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1822 Macdonough toured western New York State visiting [[Niagara Falls]] and then battling the rapids sailed down the [[St. Lawrence River]] to [[Quebec]] in a [[Bateau|batteaux]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rodney Macdonough|Macdonough, 1909]] p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

After submitting several requests for active sea duty, Macdonough received command of the 44-gun [[frigate]] {{USS|Constitution}} in 1824. However, his health continued to worsen. On October 14, 1825, Macdonough had to relieve himself of his command. On October 14 he turned command of ''Constitution'' over to Captain [[Daniel Patterson (naval officer)|Daniel T. Patterson]] at Gibraltar. Intending to return to New York, Macdonough departed the Mediterranean in the merchant brig {{USS|Edwin}}. The day before his death, in the presence of Dr. Turk, Macdonough drew up and signed a will leaving a small sum of money to his servant, his wife having died several months beforehand. On November 10, 1825, Thomas Macdonough died aboard ship while it was passing [[Gibraltar]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rodney Macdonough|Macdonough, 1909]] pp.249-251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Skaggs|Skaggs, 2003]] p.xix&lt;/ref&gt;

Macdonough's body was returned to the United States and was buried in [[Middletown, Connecticut]]. He was laid to rest alongside his wife Ann Shaler, a lady of a prominent family in Middletown, she having died just a few months earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Skaggs|Skaggs, 2006]] p.201&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Macdonough in this battle won a higher fame than any other commander of the war, British or American. He had a decidedly superior force to contend against, the officers and men of the two sides being about on a par in every respect; and it was solely owing to his foresight and resource that we won the victory. He forced the British to engage at a disadvantage by his excellent choice of position; and he prepared beforehand for every possible contingency. His personal prowess had already been shown at the cost of the rovers of Tripoli, and in this action he helped fight the guns as ably as the best sailor. His skill, seamanship, quick eye, readiness of resource, and indomitable pluck, are beyond all praise. Down to the time of the Civil War he is the greatest figure in our naval history.&lt;ref name=rooz/&gt;|Theodore Roosevelt, 1882}}

He was born at Wherwell, Hampshire, England, and died at sea while travelling from England to the [[Colony of Virginia]].

==Biography==
Thomas West received his education at [[Queen's College, Oxford]]. He served in the army under [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]], and, in 1601, was charged with supporting Essex's ill-fated insurrection against [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]], but he was acquitted of those charges.&lt;ref name=stephen&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=West, Thomas (1577-1618)|display=West, Thomas (1577–1618)|volume=60|pages=344-45}}&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded his father as [[Earl De La Warr|Baron De La Warr]] in 1602, and became a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fiske |first=John |year=1897 |title=Old Virginia and Her Neighbours |volume=1 |pages=146–47 |location=Boston and New York |publisher=Houghton, Mifflin and Company }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord De La Warr was appointed governor-for-life and captain-general of the [[Colony of Virginia]], to replace the governing council of the colony under the presidency of [[Captain John Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyisfun.org/sites/jamestown-chronicles/timeline.html "The Jamestown Chronicles Timeline"], 12 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in November 1609, the [[Powhatan]] tribe of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s killed [[John Ratcliffe (governor)|John Ratcliffe]], the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown Colony]]'s Council President, and attacked the colony in what became the [[First Anglo-Powhatan War]].&lt;ref name=lamont&gt;{{cite book |title=The Forty Years that Created America: The Story of the Explorers, Promoters, Investors, and Settlers Who Founded the First English Colonies |first=Edward M. |last=Lamont |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2014 |isbn=9781442236608 |page=121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of England's response, De La Warr recruited and equipped a contingent of 150 men and outfitted three ships at his own expense, and sailed from England in March 1610. [[Jamestown supply missions|The supply fleet]] arrived in Jamestown in June, just in time to persuade the original settlers not to give up and go home to England. As a veteran of destructive English campaigns against the Irish, De La Warr employed similar "scorched earth" tactics against the Native Americans: his troops raided villages, burned houses, torched cornfields, and stole provisions. These tactics, identical to those practiced by the Powhatan themselves, proved effective.

Lord De La Warr returned to England due to illness in the spring of 1611, leaving his deputy, Sir [[Samuel Argall]], in charge of the colony. Later that year, De La Warr wrote and published a book titled ''The Relation of the Right Honourable the Lord De-La-Warre, Lord Governour and Captaine Generall of the Colonie, planted in Virginea''.&lt;ref name=relation&gt;De La Warr, Thomas West, Baron (1611). [https://archive.org/details/relationofrighth00dela ''The Relation of the Right Honourable the Lord De-La-Warre, Lord Governour and Captaine Generall of the Colonie, planted in Virginea''] at [[Archive.org]].&lt;/ref&gt; He remained the nominal governor, and after receiving complaints from the Virginia settlers about Argall's tyranny in governing them on his behalf, Lord De La Warr set sail for Virginia again in 1618 to investigate those charges. He died at sea en route to Virginia.&lt;ref name=stephen/&gt;

It was thought for many years that Lord De La Warr had been buried in the [[Azores]] or at sea.&lt;ref name=stephen/&gt; By 2006, researchers had concluded that his body was brought to Jamestown for burial.

Lord De La Warr's brother, [[John West (governor)|John West]], later became governor of Virginia, and [[George Percy]]'s daughter married the son of Governor West.

==Family==
On 25 November 1596, De La Warr married Cecily (died c. 1662), the daughter of Sir [[Thomas Shirley (died 1612)|Thomas Shirley]] of [[Wiston, West Sussex|Wiston]], [[Sussex]] and Anne, daughter of Sir Thomas Kempe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lundy|2011|pp=14230 §142296, 20756 §207556, §207558}}, citing {{harvnb|Cokayne|2000|p=161}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They had children:&lt;!--do not put an number here unless a reliable source does--&gt;

'''Traumatic stress''' is a common term for reactive anxiety and depression, although it is not a medical term and is not included in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM).  What is popularly referred to as Traumatic Stress is covered in [[DSM-IV]] by [[Adjustment disorder |Adjustment Disorders]].  This includes subtypes of [[anxiety]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and disturbance of conduct and combinations of these symptoms.  It results from events that are less threatening and distressing than the events that lead to [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].

The condition presents in a manner similar to posttraumatic stress disorder, but lacking the same intensity.

'''Varahaneri Venkatesa Subramaniam Aiyar''' (2 April 1881&amp;nbsp;– 3 June 1925), also known as '''V. V. S. Aiyar''', was an [[India]]n revolutionary from [[Tamil Nadu]] who fought against the [[British Empire|British]] occupation of India. His contemporaries include [[Subramanya Bharathi]] and [[V.O. Chidambaram Pillai]], who subscribed to the militant form of resistance against the British. He went into exile in [[Pondicherry district|Pondicherry]], then under  [[France|French]] rule, when his militant activities attracted a warrant for his arrest from the British colonial government.

Aiyar was also a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] writer and is considered as the father of modern Tamil short story. He also translated the ''Ramavatharam'' of [[Kambar (poet)|Kambar]] and [[Tirukkural]] into English. V.V.S Aiyar is mentor of [[Vanchinathan]].

== Early life ==
Venkatesa Subramaniam Aiyar was born on 2 April 1881 in the suburb of [[Varahaneri]] in [[Tiruchi]]. After his early education, he studied in St. Joseph's College and took his B.A in History, Politics, and Latin; he studied for the Law profession and passed the Pleader (junior lawyer) examination from the Madras University in 1902. He then practised as the pleader in the District courts of Tiruchi. Aiyar then moved to [[Rangoon]] in 1906 and started practising as a junior in the Chambers of an English Barrister. From Rangoon, he left for London in 1907 and enrolled in [[Lincoln's Inn]] aiming to becoming a [[Barrister|Barrister at Law]]. While in London, Aiyar came into contact with [[Vinayak Damodar Savarkar]], an Indian revolutionary, at the [[India House]]. Under Savarkar's influence Aiyar began to take an active role in the militant struggle for [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]]. Aiyar had a son and two daughters.

== Friends ==
Venkatesa Subramaniam Aiyar was a close friend of [[Shuddhananda Bharati]]; he started with him the Bharadwaja Ashram at Cheranmadevi.

== Political activities ==
Aiyar's militant attitude prompted the [[British Raj]] in 1910 to issue a warrant for his arrest for his alleged involvement in an anarchist conspiracy in London and Paris. Aiyar resigned from the Lincoln's Inn and escaped to [[Paris]]. Although he wished to remain in Paris as a political exile, he had to return to India. Aiyar landed in [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]] on 4 4 December 1910 disguised as a [[muslim]] to escape arrest and remained there as exile. Aiyar remained in Pondicherry for over ten years. While in Pondicherry, Aiyar met with fellow revolutionaries [[Subramanya Bharathi]] and [[Aurobindo]]. In Pondicherry, Aiyar was involved in the plot to assassinate Ashe, the Collector of [[Tirunelveli]]. One of his students, [[Vanchinathan]] assassinated Ashe. Thus more trouble arose for Aiyar and his companion Subramanya Bharathi.

On 22 September 1914 the German cruiser {{SMS|Emden|1906|6}} entered the [[Madras]] harbour and bombarded the city. The British colonial government blamed this on the activities of the exiles in Pondicherry, and urged the French Governor to deport Aiyar and his companions to Africa. The French police brought several charges against the revolutionaries, but failed to convict them. During this period Aiyar translated the [[Tirukkural]] into English. He later revealed that he wanted to leave a legacy behind if he were forced to leave the country.

Aiyar returned to Madras after [[World War I]] and worked as the editor of the newspaper ''Desabhaktan'' (''Patriot''). He was arrested in 1921 on [[sedition]] charges and spent nine months in prison. While in prison Aiyar wrote the book ''A Study of Kamba Ramayana''.

As a writer, Aiyar has often been referred to as the "founder" of the short story genre in Tamil.{{sfnp|Ebeling|2010|p=244|ps=}}

== Death ==
Aiyar drowned in the Papanasam falls, when trying to save his drowning daughter Subhadra, on 3 June 1925.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

A '''Vorlon''' is a member of a fictional [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien species]] in the ''[[Babylon 5]]'' television series and [[fictional universe]]. The Vorlon species is a member of the [[First Ones]], a group composed of the earliest species to gain sentience in the galaxy. When in the presence of other species, Vorlons wear encounter suits.

==Homeworld==
Little is known of the Vorlon home-world other than its name, which is also Vorlon.  Vorlon territory was restricted to other alien species and every known expedition into Vorlon space failed to return to their respective governments.  Much like their First One brethren The Shadows, Vorlon is protected by an array of highly advanced and automated defense systems designed to keep out intruders and primitive spacefaring races.  These defense systems remain in place and active even after the Vorlons abandoned their home and left known space; evidence suggests that the systems will not allow outsiders entry to Vorlon until 1,000,000 human years have elapsed.

It is suspected that the Vorlon atmosphere is a highly toxic combination of noxious gases which are harmful to almost all known species.  During his time serving as ambassador to Babylon 5, [[Kosh Naranek|Kosh's]] quarters were flooded with these gases, but Kosh himself was able to wander the station without additional atmospheric support.  This, in addition to the incorporeal nature of their species, has led to speculation that Vorlons do not actually require an atmosphere, and instead utilize it as a deterrent to discourage visitors.  When human [[telepath]] [[Lyta Alexander]] journeyed to Vorlon space to contact them, she was physiologically altered to breathe the atmosphere and serve as attache for the Vorlon embassy.

Aside from Lyta Alexander, only one other human has been known to have access to Vorlon space: Sebastian, formerly known as [[Jack the Ripper]], whom the Vorlons took from 19th century Earth in order to employ as an "Inquisitor". His fate after the Vorlons left is unknown, though Sebastian hoped that after centuries of "penance and service" he would finally be allowed to die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Comes the Inquisitor | episodelink = Comes the Inquisitor | series = Babylon 5 | serieslink = Babylon 5 | airdate = 1995-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiology==
When in the company of aliens, Vorlons wear encounter suits to conceal their true form. The suits are large, cumbersome units with crest-like shoulders and elongated helmets and draping fabric; aside from a single illuminated iris to represent an eye/face, a Vorlon's shape cannot be deduced from the suit's design.  While the official Vorlon explanation is that the suit maintains the specific environment necessary to support them, the actual reason is to hide their appearance.  In actuality, Vorlons are incorporeal beings who require very little if any environment to survive; Vorlons have even managed to survive in the [[vacuum]] of space with no ill effect.

Vorlons conceal their identity to prevent undesired reactions from younger races. Unbeknownst to most alien species other than the [[Minbari]], the Vorlons have altered the genetic template of these younger species to include certain psychological traits such as [[telepathy]], and subconscious associations.  Before the Vorlons adopted reclusive natures, they actively visited and influenced early civilizations by telepathically projecting racial variations of themselves, causing the younger races to perceive them as kindred.  Eventually, the Vorlons inserted this association genetically, altering their perceptions so that anyone viewing them saw them as a race-specific divine being.  Humans who look upon an unclad Vorlon would see a winged angel from Abrahamic religions; a [[Drazi]] would perceive them as Droshalla, a [[Narn]] as G'Lan, a [[Minbari]] as Valeria, etc.  The process, however, requires telepathic exertion on the part of the Vorlon, and can physically drain them if they are viewed by too many at once.

A Vorlon's true shape, without the aid of telepathic projection, is that of a glowing [[cephalopod]]. The only occasion when a Vorlon's true form was viewed by humans was during the assassination of Vorlon Ambassador [[Ulkesh Naranek]] in [[Falling Toward Apotheosis]], when his suit was shattered by weaponized electricity.

When Ambassador [[Londo Mollari]] of the [[Centauri Republic]] observed an unsuited Vorlon, he claimed to have not seen anything at all. Show creator [[J. Michael Straczynski]] has said about this that: ''"Londo saw what he said he saw."''&lt;ref name="falling"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/countries/us/guide/044.html | title=Guide page: "The Fall of Night"}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that Londo alone saw nothing because of his relationship with the Shadows. Similarly, it is unclear whether the Vorlon was invisible to Londo or if this can be taken less literally to mean that Londo saw nothing of spiritual significance. At least one ''Babylon 5'' novel contradicts Straczynski's statement, saying that Mollari saw a very bright ball of energy.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Peter David|David, P]]''. [[Babylon 5: Legions of Fire - Out of the Darkness]], Del Rey; 1st ed edition (October 31, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Vorlon physiology makes them [[biologically immortal]] (incapable of death by natural causes), and extremely difficult to kill with conventional weaponry.  They possess undisclosed levels of telepathic prowess and sensitivity, able to project their consciousness into another person's mind even from extreme distances.  They are also able to divide their essence into smaller quantities and insert themselves into other beings to observe or collect intelligence undetected, even by the host themselves.  While their physical abilities are largely uncatalogued, they do have physical mass that allows them to strike objects and be vulnerable to certain assaults; Vorlons are susceptible to Florazine, a rare poison of the Damocles Sector, that was used in an early assassination attempt on [[Kosh Naranek]] at his first arrival on Babylon 5.  Vorlons can, however, be killed by other First One species.

Vorlons are known for speaking cryptically with brief phrases that vaguely relate to the question they are asked (e.g., "The avalanche has already started.  It is too late for the pebbles to vote").  This is typically considered either a limitation of their language as it is translated into English, Interlac, or other languages, or a limitation of the listener's ability to understand; there also remains speculation that they are deliberately obscure to prevent disruptions to the timeline.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The formal name for their society is the Vorlon Empire, although the nature of Vorlon government was never revealed on the show.

==Nature==
While almost all the other species of First Ones left the galaxy, the Vorlons stayed behind to act as guardians for younger species. Vorlons shepherded these worlds and the inhabitants were enthralled by their appearance; some worshipped them as gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Thirdspace | episodelink = Babylon 5: Thirdspace | series = Babylon 5 | serieslink = Babylon 5 | airdate = 1998-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shadow (Babylon 5)|Shadows]] took on the same mantle with an opposed philosophy. In this conflict, the Vorlons represent Order. They act as architects, building alliances, encouraging the rule of law and inspiring cooperation. In practice, Vorlons enforce adherence to their rules. Their philosophy is embodied by the question "Who are you?" Sometimes called "The Vorlon Question," it encourages introspection, patience and places identity over goals.

The Vorlons shown on the series tend to be enigmatic, usually speaking only brief, cryptic phrases to beings from the younger species. They also appear to take pride in their enigmatic nature:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Sheridan: "Well, as answers go, short, to the point, utterly useless, and totally consistent with what I've come to expect from a Vorlon."
:Kosh: "Good."
:Sheridan: "You know, as many times as you've come and gone from the Vorlon Homeworld, you could be anyone under there. How do I know you're the same Vorlon?"
:Kosh: "I have always been here."
:Sheridan: "Oh yeah? You said that about me, too."
:Kosh: "Yes"
:(Kosh turns his back on Sheridan and begins to walk away)
:Sheridan: "I really hate it when you do that."
:Kosh: "Good."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
By the time of the series, the Vorlons and Shadows have long since lost sight of the original goal. The intent of both elder species was to encourage the growth of younger species through the competition of order and chaos. The conflict metamorphosed into a game for military (rather than ideological) dominion. The Vorlons began to treat the younger species as pawns. This outlook took an extreme shift following the death of the first Ambassador Kosh Naranek, ending with a move to eliminate all worlds touched by the Shadows by means of a planet killer, a huge ship that could reduce a planet to rubble with a single shot. With the Shadows soon reciprocating with a planet killer of their own, the younger species would have been exterminated had it not been for Sheridan's getting the truth out to them.

==History==

===Before recorded history===
Over 1 [[mya (unit)|mya]] ago, the Vorlons decided to build a jump gate to open a doorway to what they believed was the [[Guf|Well of Souls]], the source of life. The gate which was built travels neither to normal space nor to hyperspace but to a "third" space.  They discovered that Thirdspace was inhabited and dominated by a violent telepathic species whose age and technology exceeded their own, and were driven by a supremacist belief that all life other than their own was unworthy and subject to extermination.  The [[Babylon 5: Thirdspace|Thirdspace Aliens]] used their overwhelming telepathic abilities to control many Vorlons to assist them and alter the device to augment their telepathic powers.  While the Vorlons were able to defeat them and deactivate the machine, closing the portal, those remaining under their influence seized the gate and escaped into hyperspace.  The device and the supporting ships drifted off the beacon and were lost until the year 2261.  This incident marked the first time the Vorlons encountered a race more powerful than The Shadows or themselves and was so traumatic that they implanted the memories into their genetic template as a [[race memory]] known as "The First Mistake."

Vorlon ships of this period lack the variation and military diversification they displayed by the end of the series; they resemble their basic transports, and are devoid of warships, planet killers or other heavy cruisers.

===10,000 years ago===
By this time many of the First Ones moved beyond the Galactic Rim to explore the vast emptiness between galaxies, and to allow the younger species to evolve on their own. Several of the First Ones decided to stay behind and shepherd the younger species until they were fit to control their own destiny. The primary caretakers were the Vorlons and the Shadows.

At first there was a balance between the two sides. Then the Vorlons began tinkering with species on a genetic level, in an effort to make the younger species evolve more like them. Among this genetic dabbling, the Vorlons manipulated the younger species to make them see the Vorlons as angelic prophets. Through this action the Vorlons were able to control the perceptions of the younger species. Finding the actions of their ancient counterparts appalling, the Shadows and the Vorlons began to fight among themselves and those who tried to mediate, like the Walkers of Sigma 957, left the conflict embittered.

===Circa 1260===
Over the course of the centuries that passed, the wars between the Shadows and Vorlons persisted. Then at some unknown point in time they decided to have the younger species fight for them, in an effort to prove which side was right. This led to the Great War.

The date of the war is unclear but it began roughly one thousand years before the founding of Babylon 5. This war raged between the Shadows and the combined forces of the Vorlons and many younger species such as the [[Minbari]], who, at the time, were the oldest spacefaring race who were not First Ones themselves. The Vorlons were eventually forced to ask the other First Ones for assistance in curbing the Shadows' advance.  The war escalated to such intensity that virtually all younger species except for the Minbari were exterminated or reduced to stone-age levels.  The Shadows also lost 3/4 of their entire fleet in the process, and buried individual capital ships on planets all over the galaxy—including Mars—to preserve them for the next Great War.  In spite of the Shadows' retreat, the aftermath of the war provided no discernible winner.

The outcome of the Great War was determined by the arrival of Babylon 4, which had been brought from the future through an artificially induced rift in space-time.  With the arrival of the station and the Minbari religious figure Valen, the Vorlons were able to acquire detailed information about the future and the events precipitating the next Shadow War 1,000 years in advance.

===Years 2260&amp;ndash;2261===
The final Shadow War occurred one thousand years later in 2260. The Shadows battled the combined forces of Babylon 5, the [[Minbari|Minbari Federation]], the [[Narn|Narn Regime]], the [[League of Non-Aligned Worlds]] and [[Ranger (Babylon 5)|the Rangers]].  The Vorlon Empire originally consented to aid this combined force. Following the death of the Vorlon Ambassador Kosh Naranek, and the departure of Babylon 4 to the past, their behavior became more aggressive and paranoid.  Following Captain [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|John Sheridan]]'s trip to [[Z'ha'dum (planet)|Z'ha'dum]], the Vorlons decided to end the war in their favor through the use of excessive force by destroying entire planets where The Shadows held outposts or colonies.  In response, The Shadows adopted the same policies and retaliated in kind with their own [[planet killer]] technology.  The resulting campaigns of devastation cost billions of lives.

Sheridan brought the two forces into contact at Corianna VI and then launched a suicidal assault on both sides at once. An armada of allied ships and the remaining First Ones managed to stop the Vorlon [[planet killer]] but more importantly demonstrated the younger species' defiance against their "protectors", that both the Shadows and Vorlons had failed to act as guardians, parents and teachers to the younger species. Faced with either letting them go or exterminating them, the Vorlons and Shadows stood down and left the galaxy with the remaining First Ones to join the others beyond the rim.

Following their departure, no more First Ones remain in the galaxy.

===After the departure===
After the Vorlons left the galaxy, their homeworld's defense systems were left active. As a result, several expeditions to the planet were destroyed. The Vorlons also left a message with [[Lyta Alexander]] that the planet was not for the younger species. The Vorlon Homeworld was not to be theirs until they were ready; at least another million years.

Lyta Alexander was left with other information as well. In the movie ''Thirdspace'', she was able to give information on the Thirdspace aliens. When the Drakh used Shadow control pods to operate Centauri vessels during their war with the Alliance, Alexander was able to identify the devices due to the information left with her.

In 2262 Lyta revealed that the Vorlons had modified her to be a living telepathic superweapon - a doomsday machine to be used against the Shadows if the Vorlons lost the war. They made her into the most powerful human telepath in existence, with the possible exceptions of [[Jason Ironheart]], who had already transformed into something similar to a First One; and [[Kevin Vacit]], former Director of Psi Corps who had carried a Vorlon fragment inside himself.&lt;ref&gt;"[[The Nautilus Coil]]", by [[J. Gregory Keyes]] (August 2000, ''The Official Babylon 5 Magazine'')&lt;/ref&gt;

One million years after the events of Babylon 5, the humans had become like the Vorlons. The humans had left the solar system for a planet called "New Earth".  J. Michael Straczynski indicated that New Earth was in fact the old Vorlon homeworld in the DVD commentary for the episode "[[The Deconstruction of Falling Stars]]".

==Spacecraft==
Vorlon spaceships are [[life|organic]] in nature and at least partially [[Sentience|sentient]]. Vorlon transports at least have a [[skin]] that can change color and an external shape that is pliable enough to allow passengers in and out. It was mentioned that Vorlon transports "sing", and can have an unnerving effect on non-Vorlons around them.&lt;ref name="hunter"/&gt; Vorlon ships use [[jumpgate]]s similar to those of the younger species. Vorlon technology was also used along with Minbari technology to help create the [[White Star (Babylon 5)|White Star]] spacecraft.

Vorlon ships differ greatly from their Shadow counterparts.  While smaller ships are equally maneuverable to Shadow vessels, Vorlon capital ships are large carriers that are less agile.  While Shadow vessels utilize a powerful pinpoint directed energy beam as their primary weapon, Vorlon ships have elongated structures resembling tentacles at the face of their ships that channel massive amounts of energy into capacitance, which are then fired as powerful beams of energy.  This method of power generation and offensive capability was later adopted by the Interstellar Alliance into the creation of their prototype destroyer vessels several years after the Shadow War.

The most frequently seen Vorlon ship is the '''Vorlon transport'''. According to the Babylon 5 video game, ''Into the Fire'', Vorlon transports are {{convert|131|m|ft}} long and heavily armed&lt;ref name="combat"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.firstones.com/b5games/sim/sim_dockingbay.html | title=Babylon 5 Combat Simulator: Docking Bay}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a strong bond between a Vorlon and its transport.&lt;ref name="hunter"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Hunter, Prey | episodelink = Hunter, Prey | series = Babylon 5 | serieslink = Babylon 5 | airdate = 1995-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; When its pilot is in danger, the transport becomes extremely agitated and will try to help its Vorlon escape.&lt;ref name="falling 2"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Falling Toward Apotheosis | episodelink = Falling Toward Apotheosis | series = Babylon 5 | serieslink = Babylon 5 | airdate = 1996-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Should its pilot die, Vorlon transports are said to [[grief|grieve]]. When Kosh died, his ship cremated itself and Kosh's remains in a nearby star. Babylon 5 creator [[J. Michael Straczynski]] put it thus: ''It was made for Kosh, as Delenn points out, was almost a part of him; it wouldn't function as well, if at all, for anyone else. There was nothing else to be done.''&lt;ref name="interlude"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/countries/us/guide/059.html | title=Guide page: "Interludes and Examinations" |accessdate=2006-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===One Man Fighters===
Little is known about Vorlon fighters. According to the ''Babylon 5'' video game they are about {{convert|25.5|m|ft}} long.&lt;ref name="combat"/&gt; Externally, they lack exhaust ports of any kind, suggesting that they use some type of gravimetric drive similar to that used by the [[Minbari]]. In groups they perform well, causing severe damage to a [[Shadow (Babylon 5)#Capital ship|Shadow vessel]].&lt;ref name="interlude"/&gt;

Unlike other small fighters in the ''Babylon 5'' universe, Vorlon fighters appear to have independent jump capability, where large numbers come out of hyperspace without the apparent need for a capital ship's support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Into the Fire | episodelink = Into the Fire (Babylon 5) | series = Babylon 5 | serieslink = Babylon 5 | airdate = 1997-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vorlon fighters have a much weaker bond between themselves and their pilots than Vorlon transports.&lt;ref name="interlude"/&gt; Indeed, it is not at all certain that they are manned.

===Capital ships===
These large ships, called '''Star Dreadnoughts''', are said to be over {{convert|1300|m|ft}} long.&lt;ref name="combat"/&gt; They likely carry a large number of Vorlon fighters, and, according to J. Michael Straczynski, carry a full crew of Vorlons.&lt;ref name="interlude"/&gt;

===Planet killers===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Vorlon Planet Killer.JPG|thumb|Vorlon Planet Killer firing]] --&gt;
The biggest ships in the Vorlon fleet appear to be the '''Eclipse Planet Killers''', huge starships capable of destroying entire worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.b5tech.com/oldb5tech/vorlon/vorlonships/vorlonplanetkiller.html | title=Vorlon Planet Killer: Babylon 5 Tech-Manual |accessdate=2006-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are said to be {{convert|3–4|mi|m}} long. The first planet to be hit by a planet killer was called Arcata 7. It was reduced to rubble, slag, dust and asteroids, killing the 4 million people on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

==Bioengineering==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2009}}

It is implied throughout the series that they have interfered with the evolution of many species, including humans, [[Minbari]], [[Narn]]s, and [[Drazi]]. Each of these species "see" Vorlons outside their encounter suits as some type of religious or mythological character particular to their culture. The only Centauri to see a Vorlon outside his encounter suit was Londo Mollari, who claimed he saw nothing. During the episode "[[Secrets of the Soul]]", a flashback depicted Vorlons modifying a human adult (Lyta Alexander) and fetuses of the Drazi and Centauri races.

The Vorlons also have the ability to alter alien species in other ways. [[Lyta Alexander]] was given "gills" on her neck that allowed her to breathe the atmosphere within the Vorlon ambassador's chamber, though the [[Narn]] can do much the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode
 | title = The Gathering | episodelink = Babylon 5: The Gathering | series = Babylon 5 | serieslink = Babylon 5 | airdate = 1993-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vorlons also use other beings as receptacles for a fragment of their personality, allowing them to travel widely without being noticed.

: ''This article is on the Woman's Peace Party, a forerunner of the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]].''

The '''Woman's Peace Party''' ('''WPP''') was an American [[Pacifism|pacifist]] and [[First-wave feminism|feminist]] organization formally established in January 1915 in response to [[World War I]]. The organization is remembered as the first American peace organization to make use of [[direct action]] tactics such as public demonstration. The Woman's Peace Party became the American section of an international organization known as the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace later in 1915, a group which later changed its name to the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]].

==American pacifist forerunners==


Prior to the establishment of the Woman's Peace Party, the three leading American pacifist organizations of national stature were essentially [[conservatism|conservative]] enterprises, viewing the peace movement's mission as one of extending stability, order, and the expansion of venerable American institutions.&lt;ref name="Marchand182"&gt;C. Roland Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1972; pg. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Peace Society]] (BBC), established in 1828, was the oldest of the previously existing pacifist organizations and suffered from what one historian has called "over seven decades of accumulated [[Victorian America|Victorianism]].&lt;ref name="Marchand5"&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Typified by the detached conservative nobility of corporate attorney [[Elihu Root]], the APS was dedicated to demonstrating the incompatibility between war and [[Christianity]] and throughout its existence had remained small, impoverished, and ineffectual.&lt;ref name="Marchand5" /&gt; By the time of World War I, it had been reduced in status to that of a veritable subsidiary of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]].

The Carnegie Endowment was launched by [[industrialist]] [[Andrew Carnegie]] in 1910 with a $10 million endowment.&lt;ref name="Marchand101"&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The Endowment became effectively a university publishing house for the peace movement, concentrating on academic research and the printed word rather than oratory.&lt;ref name="Marchand102"&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third of the primary American peace organizations of the first decade of the 20th Century was the [[World Peace Foundation]] (WPF), a group established in 1909 by millionaire Boston publisher [[Edwin Ginn]] as "Edwin Ginn's International School for Peace."&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pp. 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt; This organization was launched with a $1 million endowment and carried on publishing activities, changing its name to the WPF in 1911.&lt;ref name="Marchand101" /&gt; As with the Carnegie Foundation, the WPF limited its activities largely to research and publication, attempting to influence political decision-makers with ideas rather than to stir the fires of popular sentiment.

Much like the [[trust (monopoly)|trustified]] world of big business of the day, the peace movement was characterized by [[interlocking directorate]]s of the various organizations, with a very few men and no women wielding decisive influence over the movement by virtue of the power of the pocketbook.&lt;ref name="Marchand102" /&gt; The American peace movement was, in short, part of the [[political establishment]], with dinner meetings of the New York Peace Society likened by one contemporary to "a banquet of the [[Chamber of Commerce]]."&lt;ref&gt;The words are those of Frederick Lynch, 1911, cited in Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Woman's Peace Parade==

[[File:Fanny Garrison Villard.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Fanny Garrison Villard, daughter of [[William Lloyd Garrison]], chair of the August 1914 Woman's Peace Parade Committee, and initiator of the Woman's Peace Party]]
Although the establishment of a permanent organization did not follow for more than four months, the roots of the Woman's Peace Party lay in a protest march of 1500 women in [[New York City]] on August 29, 1914.&lt;ref name="Marchand182" /&gt; This "Woman's Peace Parade" was organized less than a month after the outbreak of hostilities in World War I and featured a silent procession down [[Fifth Avenue]] behind a white banner bearing a dove in front of somber crowds lining the streets.&lt;ref name=Marchand182 /&gt;

The chair of the Woman's Peace Parade committee was [[Fanny Garrison Villard]], a 70-year-old veteran of the peace movement.&lt;ref name="Marchand189"&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Her son, [[Oswald Garrison Villard]], later recalled the scene:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"There were no bands; there was dead silence and the crowds watched the parade in the spirit of the marchers, with sympathy and approval. The President had also approved, for the organizers, in complete sympathy with his public statements of the early days of the conflict, had courteously asked him for his consent. He was especially pleased by the decision of the paraders to carry no flags except the peace flag and to have no set speeches at the conclusion of the parade, but brief informal addresses were made to all who would listed....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"The silence, the dignity, the black dresses of the marchers — those who did not have black dresses wore black arm bands — the solemnity of the crowds, all of these produced a profound effect on the beholders."&lt;ref&gt;Oswald Garrison Villard, ''Fighting Years: A Memoir.'' New York: Harcourt, Brace and Co., 1939; pg. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Woman's Peace Parade marked a change of methods of the peace movement. Older American peace organizations limited themselves to working behind the scenes, attempting to influence policy through regular political channels.&lt;ref name=Marchand183&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The Peace Parade, on the other hand, made use of [[direct action]], attempting to build popular support for peace through public demonstration in the same way that [[trade union|labor organizations]] had historically fought for policies and settlements which were important to them.&lt;ref name="Marchand183" /&gt; With this tactical shift, the Woman's Peace Parade and the organization which emerged from it, the Woman's Peace Party, effectively marked the beginning of the modern peace movement.&lt;ref name="Alonso1993"&gt;{{cite book|author= Harriet Hyman Alonso |title=Peace As a Women's Issue: A History of the U.S. Movement for World Peace and Women's Rights|year=1993|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-0269-9 |chapter= Partial Chronology of the Metropolitan New York Branch of WILPF |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=FZJxg8gQThoC&amp;pg=PA279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the march, Fanny Garrison Villard sought to transform the temporary organization constructed to coordinate the march into a permanent group. Villard called upon one of her old rivals in the women's movement, [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], President of the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]] to help in this regard.&lt;ref name="Marchand189" /&gt; Catt, a former associate of [[Susan B. Anthony]], was fixated upon the struggle for women's right to vote and did not see the peace march as a likely vehicle for a change of public sentiment or national policy.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pp. 189-190.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, Catt was won over to the idea that the American suffrage movement stood to gain in support and stature if women could gain a prominent role in the noble struggle for an end to the European bloodbath.&lt;ref&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of December 1914, Catt was finally persuaded to give full effort for the launch of a national women's peace organization.&lt;ref name="Marchand193"&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote to [[settlement house|settlement worker]] [[Jane Addams]] of [[Hull House]] in Chicago, attempting to bring her into the forthcoming organization as its leader.&lt;ref name="Marchand193" /&gt; Addams had long believed in a close interrelationship between international peace, domestic humanitarian reform, and women's right to vote and was won over to the idea of a national women's peace movement.&lt;ref name="Marchand193" /&gt; The stage was set for a formal launch of the new organization — a group to be called the Woman's Peace Party.

==Foundation convention==

The Woman's Peace Party was established at an organizational convention held in [[Washington, DC]] on January 9–10, 1915.&lt;ref name="Survey150123"&gt;"A Woman's Peace Party Full Fledged for Action," ''The Survey,'' vol. 33, no. 17 (January 23, 1915), pp. 433-434.&lt;/ref&gt; The gathering was attended by more than 100 delegates representing women's organizations from around the United States.&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt;

Jane Addams was elected President of the new organization by the convention and given the power to select a Secretary and Treasurer for the group, which was to be headquartered in Addams' home city of [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt; Membership in the new organization was open to all groups willing to repurpose themselves also as a "peace circle" and to any woman paying a $1 annual membership fee.&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt; Officers ultimately included [[Lucia Ames Mead]] as National Secretary, [[Harriet P. Thomas]] as Executive Secretary, [[Sophonisba Breckinridge|Sophonisba P. Breckinridge]] as Treasurer, and [[Elizabeth Glendower Evans]] as National Organizer.&lt;ref name="Barr"&gt;Eleanor Barr, [http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/peace/DG026-050/dg043wilpf/Part%20I-WPPhistory.htm "Woman's Peace Party, 1915-20 Finding Aid: Historical Introduction,"] Women's International League for Peace and Freedom Collection DG043, Swarthmore College Library, Swarthmore, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention approved a platform calling for the immediate convocation of "a convention of [[neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] nations in the interest of an early peace," the limitation of armaments, organized opposition to [[militarism]] (or [[military intervention]])&lt;ref&gt;https://www.americamagazine.org/arts-culture/2017/04/06/examining-american-peace-movement-prior-world-war-i&lt;/ref&gt; in America, democratization of foreign policy, removal of the economic motivation for war, and the expansion of the [[woman suffrage|electoral franchise for women]].&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt; The right of women to vote was seen by the female participants in the organization as part-and-parcel of the cause for peace, based on the presumption that women were inclined by nature to be oriented towards the nurturing of human life.&lt;ref name=Marchand186&gt;Marchand, ''The American Peace Movement and Social Reform, 1898-1918,'' pg. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding convention also approved a supplemental "Program for Constructive Peace" which demanded that the American government to call a conference of neutral nations and declared that, failing that, "the party itself will call an unofficial conference of pacifists from the world over" to determine a course of action.&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt; To ensure that the current war was not merely a prelude for another, the program called for a peace based upon no transfers of territory without the will of the involved people, no [[indemnity|indemnities]] to be assessed outside those in accordance with international law, and no treaties between nations to be established without ratification of representatives of the people.&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt;

Activities concluded with a mass meeting held in the ballroom of the New Willard Hotel on Sunday, January 10, which was filled to capacity.&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt; An additional overflow meeting was held in another room but still some 500 interested people had to be turned away for lack of space.&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt; Speeches were delivered to this gathering by Jane Addams, and [[feminism|feminist]] activists [[Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence]] of England, [[Rosika Schwimmer]] of Hungary, among others.&lt;ref name="Survey150123" /&gt;

==1915 International Congress of Women==

[[File:Noordam-delegates-1915.jpg|thumb|right|Delegates to the April 1915 Women's International Congress for Peace and Freedom aboard the ''MS Noordam'' with their blue and white "PEACE" banner]]
The ongoing war in Europe forced the cancellation of the scheduled biennial convention of the [[International Woman Suffrage Alliance]], which had been slated for [[Berlin]] in 1915.&lt;ref name=Garrison88&gt;Dee Garrison, ''Mary Heaton Vorse: The Life of an American Insurgent.'' Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1989; pg. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The cancellation of the German gathering provided an opportunity for the women's peace movement to hold an international gathering of their own, and a call was issued for a convention to be held in the neutral [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="Garrison88" /&gt; Jane Addams, President of the Woman's Peace Party and arguably the most respected and influential woman in America was invited to preside over the conclave.&lt;ref name="Garrison88" /&gt;

In April 1915, 47 women, including many members of the Woman's Peace Party along with representatives of other organizations, boarded the Dutch cruise ship the ''MS Noordam'' for the dangerous journey to [[The Hague]].&lt;ref name="Alonso66"&gt;Harriet Hyman Alonso, ''Peace as a Women's Issue: A History of the US Movement for World Peace and Women's Rights.'' Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1993; pg. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Among those making the trip through mine-strewn waters were social worker [[Grace Abbott]], [[epidemiologist]] [[Alice Hamilton]], radical trade unionist [[Leonora O'Reilly]], and academic and future [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Emily Balch]].&lt;ref name="Garrison88" /&gt;

The trip was not without controversy, despite America's formally neutral status, with former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] declaring the women's mission "silly and base"" and calling the women cowards who sought peace "without regard to righteousness."&lt;ref name="Garrison88" /&gt; The American women were not dissuaded, sailing into danger with a homemade blue and white banner that bore the single word, "PEACE."&lt;ref name="Garrison88" /&gt;

The ''Noordam'' was held up for four days in the [[English Channel]] by the [[Royal Navy]] but was ultimately allowed to proceed to The Hague, which it arrived barely in time for the start of the three-day congress on the evening of April 28, 1915.&lt;ref name="Garrison91"&gt;Garrison, ''Mary Heaton Vorse,'' pg. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the decision of some combatant nations, such as Great Britain, to deny its citizens passports which would have allowed them to participate in the Congress, the gathering still proved to be a massive event, bringing together 1,136 delegates and more than 2,000 visitors.&lt;ref name="Garrison91" /&gt;

The congress drafted a series of resolutions detailing plans for a just peace, calling for general [[disarmament]] and the removal of the profit motive through nationalizing the production of armaments, and asserting the benefits of [[free trade]] and [[freedom of navigation]] on the high seas.&lt;ref name="Garrison92"&gt;Garrison, ''Mary Heaton Vorse,'' pg. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; A resolution calling for continuous [[mediation]] of disputes by a conference of neutral nations was passed, but ultimately failed to come to fruition.&lt;ref name=Garrison92 /&gt; A delegation headed by Addams was dispatched to the capitals of the belligerent powers but it, too, proved ineffectual.&lt;ref name="Garrison92" /&gt;

Before adjourning, the congress established a new international organization called the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace.&lt;ref name="Barr" /&gt; The Woman's Peace Party came to regard itself as the American section of this organization.

==Name change==

In 1921 the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace formally changed its name to the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.
