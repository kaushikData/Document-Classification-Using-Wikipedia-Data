'''ACCS''' is the [[NATO]] '''Air Command and Control System''' project, planned to replace the NATO Air Command and Control Systems of the nineties.  At the highest level it comprised the Combined Air Operations Centre (CAOC) from which the air battle is run.  Beneath this level of command is the Air Control Centre (ACC), [[Recognized Air Picture]] (RAP) Production Centre (RPC) and [[Sensor fusion|Sensor Fusion]] Post (SFP) combined in one entity called ARS. The ARS is the equivalent to the Control and Reporting Centers (CRCs) operated in the nineties.  The ACCS project comprised both static and deployable elements.  Under separate funding, NATO intended to procure deployable sensors for the deployable ACCS component (DAC).

Oversight of the project is provided by the [[NATO Communications and Information Agency]] (NCIA) in Brussels, Belgium (until 2012 executed by the NATO ACCS Management Organisation (NACMA) Board of Directors, senior representatives of the Nations engaged in the NATO ACCS project.  The Board is responsible to the Secretary General of NATO for the delivery of the project.  The [[NCIA AIRC2 PO&amp;S]] is responsible for the day-to-day management of the project scientific support from former [[NC3A]] (now part of the NCIA), system and software engineering support from Systems Support Center (SSC) (as well part of the NCIA), logistic support from former [[NAMSA]] (again part of the NCIA) and operational support from [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SHAPE]].  

The contract to build ACCS was based on nineties specifications and awarded to the Air Command Systems International (ACSI) consortium in November 1999. Since 2000 ACSI has been a part of [[ThalesRaytheonSystems]] (TRS). The contract provided the development and testing of the ACCS system core software is now completed. The hardware and software system has been accepted by NATO. Italy is the first nation using ACCS for its Military Air Operations since April 2015. Germany, France and Belgium has not yet transited to ACCS, as validation nations, leaving 17 other nations still pending.

Fundamental issues with the system design has such delayed the implementation more than 10 years. 
 
Amazingly, NATO principal procurement agency asked TRS to provide additional capability related to missile defence. First capability is said to be operational in [[Ramstein Air Base|Ramstein]] (Germany).

The Integrated System Support of the ACCS system, if operational, will be provided by the NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) supported by in-house System Support Center (SSC).

'''AXIOM''' is an [[open hardware]] and [[free software]] [[digital cinema camera]] family of devices being developed by a [[DIY]] community around the apertus° project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.zeit.de/2014/26/open-source-patente-industrie/seite-2 | title=Open Source: Eine Revolution mit Lötkolben und Schraubenzieher (German) | publisher=zeit.de | year=2014 | accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The community’s second generation camera, AXIOM Beta Compact, is presently in development.

== History ==
In 2006 Oscar Spierenburg, a Dutch film director,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6814696/ | title=Oscar Spierenburg IMDB | publisher=imdb.com | year=2017 | access-date=October 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; noticed a discussion taking place on DVInfo.net entitled “3 channel 36 bit 1280 X 720 low $ camera”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dvinfo.net/forum/alternative-imaging-methods/25296-3-channel-36-bit-1280-x-720-low-camera-viper-21.html#post433657 |title=3 channel 36 bit 1280 X 720 low $ camera viper - The Digital Video Information Network |date=February 18, 2006 |access-date=April 18, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006212612/http://www.dvinfo.net/forum/alternative-imaging-methods/25296-3-channel-36-bit-1280-x-720-low-camera-viper-21.html#post433657 |archivedate=2017-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; inside which [[Elphel]] cameras, which are typically used in scientific applications, had been mentioned.

In the same year a discussion thread entitled "High Definition with Elphel model 333 camera"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dvinfo.net/conf/showthread.php?t=63677 |title=High Definition with Elphel model 333 camera - The Digital Video Information Network |date=2007-07-01 |access-date=2017-04-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701143201/http://dvinfo.net/conf/showthread.php?t=63677 |archivedate=2007-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was posted on the DVInfo.net forum, whereupon the forum’s members discussed how best to adapt Elphel open hardware camera devices for use in film production. Sebastian Pichelhofer discovered this thread in 2008 and assisted with the project by developing an Elphel camera internal hard-disk recorder user interface.

By early 2009, and because over the course of three years upwards of 1000 posts had been submitted to this thread, the community realised that it was going to be difficult to maintain a full overview of the project in this way, and consequently a dedicated website was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://apertus.org/history | title=apertus° History | publisher=apertus.org | year=2014 | accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the decision making and naming/logo design was decided upon by the community.

After having done some contracting work with Elphel, Pichelhofer focused full-time on the project across 2011 and in July 2012 the plan to create an AXIOM camera hardware prototype from scratch, and thereby overcome some of the limitations that were found to be inherent with Elphel hardware at the time (mainly due to Elphel Inc. having shifted the company's core business focus towards development of a panoramic camera solution), was announced at the Libre Software Meeting in Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://schedule2012.rmll.info/Apertus-The-birth-of-a-completely-open-digital-cinema-camera?lang=en | title= Apertus - The birth of a completely open digital cinema camera  | publisher=Libre Software Meeting | year=2012 | accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prototype became known as AXIOM Alpha and was intended to gather feedback from typical shooting scenarios with a view to incorporating ideas into a future, more modular, kit version of the camera aimed at developers and early adopters (AXIOM Beta I Developer Kit).

Shortly after development on the AXIOM Alpha began, a [[nonprofit organization]] was established to provide legal shelter for the community, and an apertus° [[company]] was registered by Spierenburg in order to facilitate responsibilities that had been neglected up to this point, e.g. signing contracts with electronic part/service providers, paying for prototype manufacturing etc. Because of his drive and enthusiasm for the project Pichelhofer was elected apertus° Association chairman.

After reading a local [[hackerspace]] forum post in May 2013 Herbert Pötzl became aware of the community's efforts and met with Pichelhofer shortly thereafter. Pötzl had an extensive background in electronics engineering and software development and was appointed AXIOM Technical Lead. After Pötzl helped to develop critical aspects of hardware and software the AXIOM Alpha prototype was showcased at the Vienna Hackerlab in March 2014 whilst rough planning for a more modular and powerful camera was well underway.

In 2014, after [[crowdfunding]] the research and development through [[Indiegogo]], work began on creating AXIOM Beta - a five [[printed circuit board]] stack, [[FOSS]] and [[open-source hardware]], digital cinema camera incorporating the ams Sensors Belgium CMV12000 [[CMOS]] image sensor.

In recent times, and because existing manufacturers have proved reluctant to open their protocols up to the wider world, user groups have accepted responsibility and contributed to what became known as the ‘DSLR revolution’ first-hand e.g. the [[Magic Lantern (firmware)]] community. Magic Lantern is a free and open source software add-on that runs from a camera’s SD/CF card. It added a host of new features to Canon’s DSLRs that weren't included from the factory by Canon. Because the AXIOM Beta concept is essentially the hardware equivalent of the software they originally pioneered, Magic Lantern partnered with the apertus° Association in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://www.apertus.org/axiom-team-talk-video-volume1-article | title= AXIOM Team Talk - Volume 1  | publisher=apertus.org | year=2015 | accessdate=January 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the Magic Lantern community has been involved with various colour science experiments using the camera.

Research on an AXIOM Gamma started in March 2015 after the project was awarded funding from the [[European Union|EU]]'s [[Horizon 2020|Horizon2020]] programme.

'''AXIOM Beta Developer Kit (DK)''' - apertus° offers AXIOM Beta Developer Kit without an enclosure either in kit form or readily assembled. The AXIOM Beta DK provides easy access to the camera’s printed circuit boards and is aimed at those who want to work on software related development. With this in mind all associated design files, BOMs, and STL files (for CAD or 3D printing components such as a lightweight enclosure), software source code repositories, etc. are made freely available. First AXIOM Beta DK's began shipping in October 2016.

'''AXIOM Beta Compact (CP)''' - A more user-friendly version of the camera suited to photo and video production environments is intended to ship with a CNC-milled aluminium enclosure and a web-based GUI (graphical user interface) for controlling camera functions through a [[Wi-Fi]] connection. AXIOM Beta CP is in development.

'''AXIOM Beta Extended (EX)''' - A Shoulder mounted rig incorporating AXIOM Beta, larger cooling fans, data storage facilities and an on-board PC. At time of writing (November 2017) AXIOM Beta EX is presently in concept phase.

== Born ==

[[Image:Aujac logo oficial.jpg|thumb|250px|left|alt Official logo of Aujac|Official logo of Aujac]]

Aujac (Associació d'Usuaris de Java de Catalunya) born with the initial proposal to bring near the new information technologies to the people. An effort made through one of the most active Java Users Groups in Europe.

AUJAC starts to forge as an idea during the celebration of a Java course and after the initial creation of the JUG of Sabadell by Jordi Pujol Ulied, founder and president of the Aujac, in April of year 2000.
{{clear}}
The interest was very high and soon summoned a first meeting for establishing the statutes and the first Board of Directors.

The meetings occurs often and with an important collective effort that it is it could make patent in the several encounters that they were made in the current headquarters of the entity, in Sabadell.

The members founding of AUJAC was:

::Jordi Pujol Ulied (president)
::Xavier Pi i Palomés (underpresident)
::Marc Munill i Bernandich (secretary)
::Josep Folch i Serra (treasurer)
::German Munuera Pubill (vowel)
::Mònica Rayo Moragon (vowel)
::Albert Soler i Crosas (vowel)
::Pere Brugue i Pujol

At the end of year 2000, was constituted and recognized by the Generalitat de Catalunya, and being inscribed in the "Registre General d'Entitats Jurídiques"  with number of inscription: 23889 / B

On the other hand, the AUJAC was recognized by [[Sun MicroSystems]] as official JUG of Catalonia.

And in year 2003 the AUJAC becomes the most important 16é JUG of the world: Top25 JUG Program.

== Targets ==

According to the num article. 2 of its statutes:

The purposes of the association:

:''1. - To group all the users of the Java programming language in Catalonia as well as other aspects that have relation with this language.''

:''2. - The association is in itself an organic representation of the JUG (Java Users Group) in Catalonia, started by the company creative of the language, Sun MicroSystems, in the promotion of users associations ([https://web.archive.org/web/20091002000450/http://community.java.net/jugs/ JUGS]) indicating that it declares as a non-profit association and therefore there is not commercial connection with the company and just sustains bonds of users associationism.''

:''3. - To foster and to promote catalan information society, in all the possible areas. The Catalan was the expression and work language of the association.''

== President and board of directors ==

Along its existence, the Aujac is it composed of several boards of directors.

The members who compose the Board of Directors, as they marked the statutes, were chosen every two years in the General Assembly of Members, and the former members can be presented to the charge without any harm again.
During the first biennium of existence of the AUJAC (2000-2002) the Board of Directors has been composed by the following persons:

::President: Jordi Pujol Ulied
::SotsPresident: Xavier Pi Palomes
::Treasurer: Josep Folch i Serra
::Secretary: Marc Munill Bernándich
::Vowels:
:::German Munuera Pubill
:::Ignasi Pérez Valls
:::Mònica Rayo Morajón
:::Albert Soler Crosas

In the 2002 elections, the Board of Directors for the period 2002-2004 was:

::President: Jordi Pujol Ulied
::SotsPresident: Josep Ros Navarro
::Treasurer: Josep Folch i Serra
::Secretary: Mònica Rodríguez Gili
::Vowels:
:::Mònica Rayo Moragón
:::David Villegas Terrín
:::Aleix Torres Casas

In the periode 2004-2006, the board of directors comes off composed in the following way:

::President: Jordi Pujol Ulied
::SotsPresident: Aleix Torres Casas
::Treasurer: Jordi Marques del Aguila
::Secretary: Maiol Xercavins i Simó
::Vowels:
:::David Villegas Terrín
:::Josep Folch Serra
:::Inma Camacho Arellano

== Main activities ==

The main activities of the Aujac it is they centered in three main axes: formation, broadcast and collaboration projects.

=== Formation ===

In the program of formation it is intended to:

Facilitate the technology access to all the persons concerned to the Java technologies.
Establish a shared plan of formation in all the Catalan area, which they are governed by the same criterion of evaluation and formation, with a unitary program of courses.

The plan had a remarkable success, and the Barcelona Football club, "Fundación Once" and the University Autonòma of Barcelona (UAB) was one of their customers.

The plan of formation also allowed the creation of a Java Master Course at the "Fundació Indústries de la Informació", entity promoted by Mr. Antoni Farrés [[:ca:Antoni Farrés i Sabater]].

Otherwise, it is also they imparted several courses in the EUIS, Escola Universitària d'Informàtica de Sabadell, ascribed to the UAB.

=== Diffuse ===

With respect to the diffusion of the Java technology, Aujac organized the "Sun Tech Day" in Sabadell 2004, and three editions of the "Jornades Java Catalanes", and became the first non-enterprise group to organize an event of this kind in Spain, copied afterwards by JavaHispano, which made two editions of a similar event, after having attended the first as a viewer.

As explained in the definition of the "Jornades Java Catalanes" these were:

:''The "Jornades Java Catalanes" are an event focused to diffuse the Java technology and other similar technologies to the Catalan community. It is an event open to everybody, focused to several sectors of the catalan community: university, enterprise, final users and general public.''

:''The goal of the "Jornades Java Catalanes" is to visit all Catalan universities along the several editions, located in Catalonia, Valencia, Balearic Islands and the North Catalonia, through the hand of technological companies in this area.''

:''An annual periodicity is established in the event.''

:''The language of expression and work of "Jornades Java Catalanes" is, by default, the Catalan. Excluding in those activities in which they have to be made, by non-catalan resident of the persons who develop them, in the languages of expression of the same ones.''

:''The area of performance and divulging of the "Java conference C0atalanes" they are all those regions of Catalan speech.''

:''The "Jornades Java Catalanes" base their diffusion area on three predominant areas: enterprise, university and society.''

Aujac was pioneer in the Spanish state, the year 2003, in being the first non-profit organization that achieved to gather in a same event about Java, the university world, the enterprise sector and the general society, acting as link of union among them.

This joint position of initiative and leadership between Aujac and all the Catalan universities, makes the present model have been adopted by other similar entities all over the Spanish state when carrying out similar events certifying the success of the same ones.

'''Associació per a Joves TEB''', receives on 15 April 2005, during the closing ceremony of "III Jornades Java Catalanes", the "2005 Honour Member".

With this distinction it is wants to recognize the effort and dedication carried out, for this entity, that have demonstrated its contribution to the growth and development of information society in zones where the youngsters live in situations of exclusion, and where the new technologies could not be another barrier.

It is from this project, and other important project like Xarxa-Òmnia, RavalNet and a long list of projects that they have acted how authentic dynamic social agents and of bridges of cohesion there where bags of social exclusion could be produced.

== Dissolution ==

According to the agreements taken in the last General Assembly of Members, on Tuesday, 24 October 2006 at 20:00 hours, was approved by over ot{{Clarify|date=March 2016}} the two third parts of the votes, the dissolution of the association.

The reasons that brought to the dissolution were mainly two, as they were explained at the meeting:

:*''The little support on the part of the implied companies, and especially of the matrix company, Sun MicroSystems, which finally cut the capital funding of the entity.
:*''On the other hand, the problem of the technological voluntarism, in Catalonia, a concept that has just not been understood by the society.
:*'' The people associate the technology with affairs of materialist look, where always to take out a benefit and this entails that there are few people willing to collaborate if there is not an economic incentive a lot.
:*''And on "collaborating", we understand in an active and constant contribution way.
:*''The technological voluntarism must be to grow and to be something more than to participate in the development of a software or to participate in the net without going out from home.

This close a cycle where AUJAC was the most important non-enterprise entity that promotes the diffusion of Java.

The '''Augmented Reality Sandtable (ARES)''' is an interactive, digital [[sand table]] that uses [[Augmented reality|augmented reality (AR)]] technology to create a 3D battlespace map. It was developed by the Human Research and Engineering Directorate (HRED) at the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|Army Research Laboratory (ARL)]] to combine the positive aspects of traditional military sand tables with the latest digital technologies to better support soldier training and offer new possibilities of learning.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amburn|first=Charles|last2=Vey|first2=Nathan|last3=Boyce|first3=Michael|last4=Mize|first4=Jerry|date=October 2015|title=The Augmented REality Sandtable (ARES)|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/arlreports/2015/technical-report.cfm?id=7551|journal=The US Army Research Laboratory|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a projector to display a [[Topographic map|topographical map]] on top of the sand in a regular sandbox as well as a motion sensor that keeps track of changes in the layout of the sand to appropriately adjust the computer-generated terrain display.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/2014/09/24/microsofts-kinect-aids-in-augmented-reality-sand-mapping-tool-for-marines-army/|title=Microsoft’s Kinect aids in ‘augmented reality sand’ mapping tool for Marines, Army|last=|first=|date=September 23, 2014|work=Marine Corps Times|access-date=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/yp5w8y/the-armys-new-projection-mapped-sandtable|title=Design Digital Terrain with the Army's Projection-Mapped Sandtable|last=Mufson|first=Beckett|date=November 5, 2014|work=Vice Creators|access-date=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ARL study conducted in 2017 with 52 active duty military personnel (36 males and 16 females) found that the participants who used ARES spent less time setting up the table compared to participants who used a traditional sand table. In addition, ARES demonstrated a lower perceived workload score, as measured using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) ratings, compared to the traditional sand table. However, there was no significant difference in post-knowledge test scores in recreating the visual map.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hale|first=Kelly|last2=Riley|first2=Jennifer|last3=Amburn|first3=Charles|last4=Vey|first4=Nathan|date=January 1, 2018|title=Evaluation of Augmented REality Sandtable (ARES) during Sand Table Construction|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/AD1045665|journal=US Army Research Laboratory|volume=|pages=|via=Defense Technical Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The ARES project was one of the 25 ARL initiatives in development from 1995 to 2015 that focused on visualizing spatial data on virtual or sand table interfaces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garneau|first=Christopher|last2=Boyce|first2=Michael|last3=Shorter|first3=Paul|last4=Vey|first4=Nathan|last5=Amburn|first5=Charles|date=February 1, 2018|title=The Augmented Reality Sandtable (ARES) Research Strategy|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/AD1048013|journal=US Army Research Laboratory|volume=|pages=|via=Defense Technical Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by HRED’s Simulation and Training Technology Center (STTC) with Charles Aumburn as the principal investigator.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Collaborations involved with ARES included Dignitas Technologies, Design Interactive (DI), the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Simulation and Training, and the U.S. Military Academy at [[West Point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.teamorlando.org/army-and-marines-research-sand-table-technology/|title=Army and Marines research sand table technology|last=Glass|first=Dolly|date=December 18, 2014|work=Team Orlando|access-date=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ARES was largely designed to be a [[Tangible user interface|tangible user interface (TUI)]], in which digital information can be manipulated using physical objects such as a person’s hand. It was constructed using commercial off-the-shelf components, including a projector, a laptop, an LCD monitor, Microsoft’s [[Xbox Kinect]] sensor, and government-developed ARES software. With the projector and Kinect sensor both facing down on the surface of the sandbox, the projector provides a digital overlay over the sand and the Kinect sensor scans the surface of the map to detect any user gestures inside the boundaries of the sandbox.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During development, researchers explored the possibility of incorporating ideas such as multi-touch surfaces, 3D holographic displays, and virtual environments. However, budget restrictions limited the implementation of such ideas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On September 2014 during the Modern Day Marine exhibition in Quantico, Virginia, researchers from ARL showcased ARES for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.doncio.navy.mil/CHIPS/ArticleDetails.aspx?ID=5539|title=New Sand Table Technology Featured at Modern Day Marine|last=Hedelt|first=Carden|date=September 24, 2014|work=CHIPS|access-date=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
According to a 2015 technical report by ARL scientists, ARES is reported to have the following capabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* Images, maps, and videos can be projected into the sand table from a top-down point of view in real time.
* Terrain and scenarios created in ARES can be imported into different simulation applications, such as Virtual Battlespace 3 (VBS3) and One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF).
* [[Military symbols]] and graphics can be created, labeled, and placed onto the sand table to set up different scenarios.
* Visual aids such as [[Color scheme|color schemes]] and [[Contour line|contour lines]] can be used to guide users to shaping the sand to replicate a previously saved 3D terrain.
* Users can use their hand to navigate the different menus available in ARES as if it was the mouse.
* The ARES sensor can detect and track the presence of hand(s) to identify where the user points on the sand table.
* A web camera can be used to communicate with other users and provide a top-down view of the sand table to collaborators.
* AR-based tablet apps and specially-made note cards can be used to project images of different vehicles on the terrain.

'''Avaloq''' is a Swiss company that develops and provides software for [[core banking]]. The software system, '''Avaloq Banking Suite''', is used by more than 140 banks worldwide.&lt;ref name="bbchs"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smale|first1=Will|title=High security: The man who protects our bank accounts|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38800176|website=BBC News|accessdate=7 February 2017|date=6 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207000336/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38800176|archivedate=7 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Core banking is the activity, at the heart of any bank, that deals with information about customers, transactions and account balances. Banks have traditionally bought in software for these purposes rather than developing it internally. More and more functions have had to be added over the years as requirements have changed, for example for online banking. The result has been very complex computer programs that can be difficult to manage. Also,  coding changes for compliance to new regulations and for accommodating new products can be problematic.&lt;ref name="abank"&gt;{{cite web|title=Can Big Four Core Banking Vendors' Oligopoly Be Broken?|url=https://www.americanbanker.com/news/can-big-four-core-banking-vendors-oligopoly-be-broken|website=American Banker|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.americanbanker.com%2Fnews%2Fcan-big-four-core-banking-vendors-oligopoly-be-broken&amp;date=2017-02-07|first1=Penny|last1=Crosman|date=7 October 2013|archivedate=7 February 2017|deadurl=no|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, banks have tended to buy in modern comprehensive software from large, specialist firms. This may be run by the bank itself or by an agency running the computing service on behalf of the bank.&lt;ref name=abank /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eckert|first1=Martin|title=Swiss Banking Software Goes Worldwide|url=http://www.worlditlawyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Swiss-Banking-Software-goes-worldwide_Martin_Eckert_MME-Partners2.pdf|website=worlditlawyers.com|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.worlditlawyers.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2011%2F06%2FSwiss-Banking-Software-goes-worldwide_Martin_Eckert_MME-Partners2.pdf&amp;date=2017-02-07|archivedate=7 February 2017|pages=20-21|date=June 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company history==
Avaloq was founded in Zurich in 1985, under the name "BZ Informatik Aktiengesellschaft", functioning as the [[information technology]] subsidiary of {{ill|BZ Bank|de}}. In 1991, 30% of the share capital was taken by the employees as a result of a partial [[management buyout]]. At that time there were five staff and the cost of the buyout was $200,000.&lt;ref name=bbchs /&gt;

The first customer was [[Swiss National Bank]], rapidly followed by five other commercial banks in Switzerland. The system then spread worldwide although it has had little impact in America.&lt;ref name=bbchs /&gt;&lt;ref name=abank /&gt; Initially the firm was called BZ Informatik, and its product “AdvAntAge”.

In 1996 the current name was adopted.&lt;ref name="avaloqhistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=History – Avaloq|url=https://www.avaloq.co.uk/about-us/history/|website=www.avaloq.co.uk|publisher=Avaloq|accessdate=7 February 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avaloq.co.uk%2Fabout-us%2Fhistory%2F&amp;date=2017-02-07|archivedate=7 February 2017|language=en|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the company split from BZ Bank, as the employees acquired 100% of the share capital.

==Current activities==

Avaloq Banking Group AG employs 2,500 staff, 500 of which are programmers. It has annual revenues of over $500 million and its software accounts for bank deposits to the sum of $4 trillion.&lt;ref name=bbchs /&gt; The founder and chairman is Francisco Fernandez.&lt;ref name=bbchs /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Management Team – Avaloq|url=https://www.avaloq.co.uk/about-us/our-management-team/|website=www.avaloq.co.uk|publisher=Avaloq|accessdate=7 February 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208032929/https://www.avaloq.co.uk/about-us/our-management-team/|archivedate=8 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Avaloq Banking Suite software is used by over 450 customers including [[HSBC]], [[Barclays]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], [[UBS]], [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Nomura]] and [[Societe Generale]].&lt;ref name=bbchs /&gt; Some of the customers have performed [[business process outsourcing]] to Avaloq itself for the actual running of the core computing service which uses [[cloud computing]].&lt;ref name=bbchs /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Minetti|first1=Maurizio|title=Bankensoftware: Avaloq greift nach der Krone aloq greift nach der Krone|url=http://www.inside-it.ch/articles/15852|website=inside-it.ch|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.inside-it.ch%2Farticles%2F15852&amp;date=2017-02-07|archivedate=7 February 2017|date=23 October 2008|language=de|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pütter|first1=Christiane|title=Business Process Outsourcing Avaloq und Quirin Bank rollen BPO-Markt auf|url=http://www.cio.de/a/avaloq-und-quirin-bank-rollen-bpo-markt-auf,2903921|website=www.cio.de|publisher=CIO|accessdate=7 February 2017|language=de|date=14 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309042201/http://www.cio.de/a/avaloq-und-quirin-bank-rollen-bpo-markt-auf%2C2903921|archivedate=9 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:100 2902.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Luggage is weighed as passengers check in at the airport]]
On the commercial transportation, mostly with airlines, the '''baggage allowance''' is the amount of [[checked baggage]] or [[hand luggage|hand/carry-on luggage]] the company will allow per passenger. There may be limits on the amount that is allowed free of charge, and hard limits on the amount that is allowed.

The limits vary per airline and depend on the class, elite status, type of ticket, flight origin and destination. If a flight is booked together with another flight it may also have different limits (e.g. if another flight on the same ticket is a long-haul flight). The exact baggage conditions are mentioned in the ticket information online.

==Types of baggage==
On aircraft, there are two types of baggage, which are treated differently: [[checked baggage]] and [[hand luggage|hand/carry-on luggage]]. For both types, transportation companies have rules on the weight and size.

For checked baggage, stored in the aircraft hold, usually the weight is the limiting factor. All checked items are generally weighed by the airline during check-in, and if they exceed the limit, the passenger is informed by the airline. To avoid any fees, the passenger often must switch some of the items found in the suitcase to another suitcase, or else carry it on.

Carry-on luggage is judged primarily by size. Bags are measured by dimension or in total linear measurement (length + width + height). However, there may also be other restrictions on the types of belongings that can be carried on the plane.

==IATA==
The [[International Air Transport Association|International Air Transport Association (IATA)]] has released recommendations for limits on checked baggage and carry-on luggage. Some companies adhere to these recommendations, some adhere partially and some don't adhere at all to them.

The recommendations for checked baggage are: advised maximum weight 23&amp;nbsp;kg (50.71&amp;nbsp;lbs), weight limit 32&amp;nbsp;kg (70.55&amp;nbsp;lbs), advised maximum size 158&amp;nbsp;cm (62.2&amp;nbsp;in) length + width + height, limit 203&amp;nbsp;cm (nearly 80 in). The limit of 23&amp;nbsp;kg is present because of similar limits in health and safety regulations.

Because of the wide variation in hand/carry-on luggage limits, in 2015 IATA released a size recommendation for suitcases meant as hand/carry-on luggage. These state that suitcases should have a maximum size of 55&amp;nbsp;cm (21.65&amp;nbsp;in) long, 35&amp;nbsp;cm (13.78&amp;nbsp;in) wide and 20&amp;nbsp;cm (7.87&amp;nbsp;in) deep. If they meet these requirements, the bag may carry the logo "IATA cabin OK".&lt;ref name="iata.org"&gt;http://www.iata.org/pressroom/pr/Pages/2015-06-09-02.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; This limit is tighter than most current airline limits, so bags with this logo are practically allowed everywhere.

==Standard concepts==
Two concepts for baggage weight limits are in use.

===Piece Concept===
Under the Piece Concept, passengers are permitted to check in a certain number of suitcases with a per-bag weight of up to 23 kilograms for Economy Class, and up to 32 kilograms for Business or First Class. The allowed weight per suitcase and the number of suitcases varies per airline and depends on the class, elite status, type of ticket, flight origin and destination.

===Weight Concept===
Under the Weight Concept, each passenger is permitted to check in a total weight regardless of the number of suitcases. Often passengers traveling together can also combine their allowed weights. The total weight varies per airline and depends on the class, elite status, type of ticket, flight origin and destination.

==Fees==
Baggage fees in the United States have been the norm for many airlines and the trend is predicted to continue with many [[Transatlantic flight|trans-Atlantic]] flights starting to collect fees for the lowest cost tickets. IdeaWorks, a travel consulting firm, predicted fees will become the norm by the end of 2019 and globally thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bachman |first=Justin |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-18/the-death-of-free-checked-airline-baggage |title=Airline Baggage Fees Go International |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=2018-01-18 |accessdate=2018-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 23 largest airlines in the United States reported earning $4.6 billion in baggage fees in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Martin |first=Hugo |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-airline-profits-20180507-story.html |title=U.S. airlines pocketed $15.5 billion last year, including a record $4.6 billion in bag fees |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2018-05-07 |accessdate=2018-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Black Friday Sale''' is a joint sales initiative by hundreds of online vendors in [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]], inspired by the American [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]]. The event was first launched on 28 November 2013: Over its 24-hour run, more than 1.2 million people visited the site, making it the single largest online shopping event in German speaking countries. Many leading online retailers such as [[Zalando]], [[Disney Store]], [[Saturn (store)|Saturn]], [[Galeria Kaufhof]], [[Heinrich Deichmann-Schuhe GmbH|Deichmann]], [[The Body Shop]], [[Sony]], [[Yves Rocher]] and [[Dell]] participated in the event in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/icon/article121825365/Der-absolute-Festtag-des-Online-Shoppers.html|title=German online newspaper Welt | date=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
== Reception ==
Once the Black Friday Sale started at 7 pm on 28 November 2013, more than 50.000 users simultaneously accessed the site, temporarily causing delays and server overloads. The overwhelming numbers of visitors also caused the servers of several online shops, such as the electronics store Saturn, to suffer significant downtime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.channelobserver.de/artikel/black-friday-server-von-saturn-geht-in-die-knie-1522/|title=German online magazine Channel Observer | date=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the technical problems, the first Black Friday Sale generated a significant turnover and was considered a notable success by online retailers and organizers alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.internetworld.de/e-commerce/internet/black-friday-sale-erfolg-294371.html|title=German magazine Internet World Business | date=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Upcoming events ==
After successfully launching in 2013, and having a successful 2014, 2015 and 2016, the Black Friday Sale is set to return on 24 November 2017. Online shoppers are expected to spend billions on this Black Friday sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Black Friday Sale 2017|url=http://thelifetech.com/hostgator-black-friday-sale/|website=TheLifeTech|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once more, several hundred leading online vendors will be involved, among them [[Douglas Holding]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Sony]], [[Tally Weijl]] and [[Weltbild]]. [[eBay]] and [[PayPal]] are also featured as official partners of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.moebelkultur.de/news/black_friday_sale-onlinehndler_erwarten_auch_in_diesem_jahr_rekordumstze/21126.html|title=German magazine Moebelkultur | date=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Body powder on foot.jpg|thumb|Body powder on foot]]
'''Body powder''' is the generic name for alternatives to [[talcum powder]]. It is usually made from a combination of [[tapioca]] flour, [[rice]] flour, [[cornstarch]], [[kaolin]], [[arrowroot]] powder, and/or [[orrisroot]] powder, but also other powders may be used. In addition, water absorbing and water binding agents may be added such as [[polyacrylamide]].

A '''camlock''', or also '''cam lock''' and '''Cam-Lok'''&lt;!--[http://www.cooperindustries.com/content/public/en/crouse-hinds/brands/camlok.html Cooper Industries &gt; Crouse-Hinds]--&gt;, is an interchangeable [[single-pole]] electrical connector often used in temporary electrical power production and [[Electricity_distribution|distribution]] predominantly used in the [[North America]].&lt;ref name="ecpower"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cam Locks Explained |url=http://www.ecpowersystems.com/resources/cam-locks/cam-locks-explained/ |website=www.ecpowersystems.com |publisher=East Coast Power Services |accessdate=23 November 2016 |date=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally a [[trade name]] as Cam-Lok, it is now a generic term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Film, Television, Live Performance and Event Electrical Guidelines |url=https://www.esasafe.com/assets/files/esasafe/pdf/Specifications/ESA-SPEC-003-R4.pdf |work=ESA SPEC-003-04 |publisher=Electrical Safety Authority (ESA) of Ontario |accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common form is the ''16'' series, rated at 400 amperes with 105 °C terminations. Also in common use is the ''15'' series (''mini-cam''), rated at 150 amperes. A larger version is made denoted as the ''17'' series with ratings up to 760&amp;nbsp;A. A ball nose version and a longer nose standard version exist-the latter is the most common. Another version is the ''Posi-lok'' which has controlled interconnection sequencing to a panel and a shrouded connector body. The early version original connector was hot-vulcanized to the cable body; later versions use dimensional pressure to exclude foreign material from the connector pin area;the tail of the connector insulator body is trimmable to fit the cable outer diameter.

They are generally used where more than 50&amp;nbsp;A is required or [[three phase|3 phase]] temporary connections are needed, and to connect large [[electrical generator|generators]] or building disconnects to distribution panels,or for test connections to load bank equipment for generator load certification; special events and the interconnection of entertainment lighting and sound equipment to power sources. They are usually found only in professional environments, where connections are performed by qualified personnel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actsafe.ca/wp-content/uploads/resources/pdf/LPEC-study-guide.pdf Live Performance Electrical Certificate - Actsafe, p20-22]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Color Codes ==
The colors correspond to the different functions of the terminals. Extra caution should be used to verify correct phase in relation to color coordination with foreign companies and equipment in traveling productions.  The [[three-phase electric power#Color codes|common American colors]] are: 

{| class=wikitable
|+ 120/208-volt wye and 240-volt delta
|-
! Colour !! Use
|-
| style="background:green; color:white;" | Green || Equipment grounding conductor
|-
| style="background:white;"              | White || Neutral (grounded conductor)
|-
| style="background:black; color:white;" | Black || Ø 1
|-
| style="background:red;"                | Red   || Ø 2
|-
| style="background:blue; color:white;"  | Blue  || Ø 3
|}

{| class=wikitable
|+ 277/480-volt wye or 480-volt delta
|-
! Colour !! Use
|-
| style="background:green; color:white;" | Green  || Equipment grounding conductor
|-
| style="background:white;"              | White  || Neutral (grounded conductor, if used)
|-
| style="background:brown; color:white;" | Brown  || Ø 1
|-
| style="background:orange;"             | Orange || Ø 2
|-
| style="background:yellow;"             | Yellow || Ø 3
|}

It is very often assumed that these colors are dictated by the [[National Electric Code]] (NEC), however they are not. The NEC only requires that green must only be used for the equipment grounding conductor (NEC Article 250.119) and only white or grey for the neutral (grounded) conductor (NEC Article 200.6). These colors may not be used for any other purpose, nor may their purpose use a different color. No other colors are specified by the NEC for general power distribution.

The UK system uses the following [[three-phase electric power#Color codes|colour codes]], but as the use of Camlocks has been declining, it is very unlikely to find any matching the new colour codes:
{| class=wikitable
|+ UK Camlock colour codes
|-
! colspan=2 | Colour !! rowspan=2 | Use
|-
! Old !! New
|-
| style="background:green; color:white;" | Green  || style="background:green; color:white;" | Green || Earth
|-
| style="background:black; color:white;" | Black  ||  style="background:blue; color:white;" | Blue  || Neutral
|-
| style="background:red;"                | Red    || style="background:brown; color:white;" | Brown || L1
|-
| style="background:yellow;"             | Yellow || style="background:black; color:white;" | Black || L2
|-
| style="background:blue; color:white;"  | Blue   || style="background:grey; color:white;"  | Grey  || L3
|}

Extra care should be taken when connecting together systems using old and new colour codes, especially as black was originally used to indicate neutral and is now a phase colour, and blue which used to denote a phase is used to denote neutral.

A '''chemical computer''', also called reaction-diffusion computer, BZ  computer (stands for [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction|Belousov–Zhabotinsky]] computer) or gooware computer is an [[unconventional computing|unconventional computer]] based on a semi-solid chemical "soup" where data are represented by varying concentrations of chemicals.&lt;ref name="ijirt.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijirt.org/paperpublished/IJIRT101166_PAPER.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615085700/http://www.ijirt.org/paperpublished/IJIRT101166_PAPER.pdf |archivedate=2015-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The computations are performed by naturally occurring [[chemical reaction]]s.

==Background==
Originally chemical reactions were seen as a simple move towards a stable equilibrium which was not very promising for computation. This was changed by a discovery made by [[Boris Pavlovich Belousov|Boris Belousov]], a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] scientist, in the 1950s. He created a [[chemical reaction]] between different salts and acids that swing back and forth between being yellow and clear because the concentration of the different components changes up and down in a cyclic way. At the time this was considered impossible because it seemed to go against the [[second law of thermodynamics]], which says that in a closed system the [[entropy]] will only increase over time, causing the components in the mixture to distribute themselves till equilibrium is gained and making any changes in the concentration impossible. But modern theoretical analyses shows sufficiently complicated reactions can indeed comprise wave phenomena without breaking the laws of nature.&lt;ref name="ijirt.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nautil.us/issue/21/information/moores-law-is-about-to-get-weird|title=Moore's Law Is About to Get Weird|work=Nautilus}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A convincing directly visible demonstration was achieved by [[Anatol Zhabotinsky]] with the [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]] showing spiraling colored waves.)

The wave properties of the [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction|BZ]] reaction means it can move information in the same way as all other waves. This still leaves the need for computation, performed by conventional microchips using the [[binary code]] transmitting and changing ones and zeros through a complicated system of [[logic gate]]s. To perform any conceivable computation it is sufficient to have [[NAND logic|NAND gates]]. (A NAND gate has two bits input. Its output is 0 if both bits are 1, otherwise it's 1). In the chemical computer version logic gates are implemented by concentration waves blocking or amplifying each other in different ways.

==Current research==
In 1989 it was demonstrated how light-sensitive chemical reactions could perform [[image processing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |author1=L. Kuhnert |author2=K. I. Agladze |author3=V. I. Krinsky | year = 1989

 | volume = 337 | issue = 6204| pages = 244–247
 | doi = 10.1038/337244a0
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to an upsurge in the field of chemical computing.
[[Andrew Adamatzky]] at the [[University of the West of England]] has demonstrated simple logic gates using [[reaction–diffusion]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |author1=Adamatzky, Andrew   |author2=De Lacy Costello, Benjamin

 | volume = 66  | issue = 4  | page = 046112 
 | doi =  10.1103/PhysRevE.66.046112
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he has theoretically shown how a hypothetical "2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; medium" modelled as a [[cellular automaton]] can perform computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | author =  Andrew I. Adamatzky
 | year = 1997

 | doi =10.1002/(SICI)1099-0712(199709)7:5&lt;263::AID-AMO317&gt;3.0.CO;2-Y
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adamatzky was inspired by a theoretical article on [[Billiard-ball computer|computation by using balls on a billiard table]] to transfer this principle to the BZ-chemicals and replace the billiard balls with waves: if two waves meet in the solution, they create a third wave which is registered as a 1. He has tested the theory in practice and is working to produce some thousand chemical versions of logic gates to create a chemical pocket calculator.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
One of the problems with the present version of this technology is the speed of the waves; they only spread at a rate of a few millimeters per minute. According to [[Adamatzky]], this problem can be eliminated by placing the gates very close to each other, to make sure the signals are transferred quickly. Another possibility could be new chemical reactions where waves propagate much faster.

In 2014, a chemical computing system was developed by an international team headed by the [[Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology]] (Empa). The chemical computer used surface tension calculations derived from the [[Marangoni effect]] using an acidic gel to find the most efficient route between points A and B, outpacing a conventional [[satellite navigation]] system attempting to calculate the same route.&lt;ref name="engineering.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineering.com/DesignerEdge/DesignerEdgeArticles/ArticleID/8806/Chemical-GPS-Outpreforms-Satellite-Navigation-System.aspx|title=Chemical GPS Outpreforms Satellite Navigation System  &gt; ENGINEERING.com|work=engineering.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmag.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/chemical-gps/34446/|title=Empa invents chemical computer faster than a satnav|work=gizmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Stanford University]] graduate students created a computer using magnetic fields and water droplets infused with magnetic [[nanoparticles]], illustrating some of the basic principles behind a chemical computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/208086-stanford-has-created-a-water-droplet-computer|title=Stanford has created a water-droplet computer - ExtremeTech|work=ExtremeTech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zmescience.com/science/physics/water-droplet-computer-0534534/|title=This computer clocks uses water droplets, manipulating information and matter at the same time|work=ZME Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[University of Washington]] students created a programming language for chemical reactions (originally developed for [[DNA]] analysis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geekwire.com/2013/programming-language-dna/|title=Chemical computer: Researchers develop programming language to control DNA molecules|author=Taylor Soper|work=GeekWire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/news/2013/09/30/uw-engineers-invent-programming-language-to-build-synthetic-dna/|title=UW engineers invent programming language to build synthetic DNA|work=washington.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clean-In-Place Unit at the World of Coca-Cola.jpg|thumb|A clean-in-place unit on display at the [[World of Coca-Cola]] in [[Atlanta]]]]
'''Clean-in-place''' ('''CIP''') is a method of cleaning the interior surfaces of pipes, vessels, process equipment, [[Filtration|filters]] and associated fittings, without disassembly.

Up to the 1950s, closed systems were disassembled and cleaned manually. The advent of CIP was a boon to industries that needed frequent internal cleaning of their processes. Industries that rely heavily on CIP are those requiring high levels of hygiene, and include: [[Dairy#Industrial production|dairy]], [[beverage]], [[Brewing#Brewing process|brewing]], [[Food processing#Industries|processed foods]], [[Pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical]], and [[cosmetics]].

The benefit to industries that use CIP is that the cleaning is faster, less labor-intensive and more repeatable, and poses less of a chemical exposure risk. CIP started as a manual practice involving a balance tank, [[Centrifugal Pump|centrifugal pump]], and connection to the system being cleaned. Since the 1950s, CIP has evolved to include fully automated systems with [[programmable logic controller]]s, multiple balance tanks, [[sensors]], [[valves]], [[heat exchangers]], [[data acquisition]] and specially designed spray nozzle systems. Simple, manually operated CIP systems can still be found in use today.

Depending on soil load and process geometry, the CIP design principle is one of the following:
* deliver highly turbulent, high flow-rate solution to effect good cleaning (applies to pipe circuits and some filled equipment).
* deliver solution as a low-energy spray to fully wet the surface (applies to lightly soiled vessels where a static sprayball may be used).
* deliver a high energy impinging spray (applies to highly soiled or large diameter vessels where a dynamic spray device may be used).
Elevated temperature and chemical detergents are often employed to enhance cleaning effectiveness.

== Factors affecting the effectiveness of the cleaning agents ==
'''Temperature of the cleaning solution'''. Elevating the temperature of a cleaning solution increases its dirt removal efficiency. Molecules with high kinetic energy dislodge dirt faster than slow moving molecules of a cold solution.

'''Concentration of the cleaning agent'''. A concentrated cleaning solution will clean a dirty surface much better than a dilute one due to the increased surface binding capacity.

'''Contact time of the cleaning solution'''. The longer the detergent contact period, the higher the cleaning efficiency. After some time, the detergent eventually dissolves the hard stains/soil from the dirty surface.

'''Pressure exerted by the cleaning solution (or turbulence)'''. The turbulence creates an abrasive force that dislodges stubborn soil from the dirty surface.

==Groundwater sources==

Originally developed for cleaning closed systems as described above, CIP has more recently been applied to [[groundwater]] source [[borehole]]s used for high end-uses such as natural mineral / spring waters, food production and carbonated soft drinks (CSD).

Boreholes that are open to the atmosphere are prone to a number of chemical and microbiological problems, so sources for high end-use are often sealed at the surface ([[headworks]]). An air filter is built into the headworks to permit the borehole to inhale and exhale when the water level rises and falls quickly (usually due to the pump being turned on and off) without drawing in airborne particles or contaminants (spores, molds, fungi, bacteria, etc.).

In addition, CIP systems can be built into the borehole headworks to permit the injection of cleaning solutions (such as sodium hypochlorite or other sanitizers) and the subsequent recirculation of the mix of these chemicals and the groundwater. This process cleans the borehole interior and equipment without any invasive maintenance being required.

==Bioreactors, fermentors, and mix vessels==

CIP is commonly used for cleaning bioreactors, fermenters, mix vessels, and other equipment used in biotech manufacturing, pharmaceutical manufacturing and food and beverage manufacturing. CIP is performed to remove or obliterate previous [[cell culture]] batch components. It is used to remove in-process residues, control [[bioburden]], and reduce [[endotoxin]] levels within processing equipment and systems. Residue removal is accomplished during CIP with a combination of heat, chemical action, and [[turbulent flow]].

The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] published a CIP regulation in 1978 applicable to pharmaceutical manufacturing. The regulation states, “Equipment and utensils shall be cleaned, maintained, and sanitized at appropriate intervals to prevent malfunctions or contamination that would alter the safety, identity, strength, quality or purity of the drug product beyond the official or other established requirements.”&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration (1978). "Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Finished Pharmaceuticals: Equipment cleaning and maintenance." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{uscfr|21|211|67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repeatable, reliable, and effective cleaning is of the utmost importance in a manufacturing facility. Cleaning procedures are validated to demonstrate that they are effective, reproducible, and under control. In order to adequately clean processing equipment, the equipment must be designed with smooth stainless steel surfaces and interconnecting piping that has cleanable joints. The chemical properties of the cleaning agents must properly interact with the chemical and physical properties of the residues being removed.

A typical CIP cycle consists of many steps which often include (in order):
* Pre-rinse with WFI (water for injection) or PW ([[purified water]]) which is performed to wet the interior surface of the tank and remove residue. It also provides a non-chemical pressure test of the CIP flow path.
* [[Sodium hydroxide|Caustic]] solution single pass flush through the vessel to drain. Caustic is the main cleaning solution.
* Caustic solution re-circulation through the vessel.
* Intermediate WFI or PW rinse
* Acid solution wash – used to remove mineral precipitates and protein residues.
* Final rinse with WFI or PW – rinses to flush out residual cleaning agents.
* Final air blow – used to remove moisture remaining after CIP cycle.

Critical parameters must be met and remain within the specification for the duration of the cycle. If the specification is not reached or maintained, cleaning will not be ensured and will have to be repeated. Critical parameters include temperature, flow rate/supply pressure, chemical concentration, chemical contact time, and final rinse [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]] (which shows that all cleaning chemicals have been removed).

A '''cold chain''' or '''cool chain''' is a [[temperature]]-controlled [[supply chain]]. An unbroken cold chain is an uninterrupted series of refrigerated production, storage and distribution activities, along with associated equipment and logistics, which maintain a desired low-temperature range. It is used to preserve and to extend and ensure the [[shelf life]] of products, such as fresh agricultural [[produce]],&lt;ref name="CTFVPx"&gt;{{cite web | first = Pawanexh | last = Kohli | title = Fruits and Vegetables Post-Harvest Care: The Basics | url = http://crosstree.info/Documents/Care%20of%20F%20n%20V.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | publisher = CrossTree techno-visors }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[seafood]], [[frozen food]], [[photographic film]], chemicals, and [[pharmaceutical drug]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gyesley |first= S.

Cold chain logistics includes all of the means used to ensure a constant temperature for a product that is not heat stable, from the time it is manufactured until the time it is used. Moreover, cold chain is considered as a science, a technology and a process. It is a science as it requires the understanding of the chemical and biological processes associated with product perishability. It is a technology as it relies on physical means to ensure desirable temperature conditions along the supply chain. It is a process as a series of tasks must be performed to manufacture, store, transport and monitor temperature sensitive products.

==Origin==

Mobile refrigeration was innovated in 1940 by [[Frederick McKinley Jones]], who founded [[Thermo King]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatachievements.org/?id=3864|title=Air Conditioning and Refrigeration History - part 4 - Greatest Engineering Achievements of the Twentieth Century|author=|date=|website=www.greatachievements.org|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203195802/http://www.greatachievements.org/?id=3864|archivedate=3 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:VillageReach vaccine cold chain.jpg|thumb|Cold chain being maintained using ice box while transporting polio vaccine]]
Cold chains are common in the [[food]] and [[pharmaceutical]] industries and also in some chemical shipments. One common temperature range for a cold chain in pharmaceutical industries is {{convert|2|to|8|C}}, but the specific temperature (and time at temperature) tolerances depend on the actual product being shipped. Unique to fresh produce cargoes, the cold chain requires to additionally maintain product specific environment parameters&lt;ref name="CTFVPx"/&gt; which include air quality levels (carbon dioxide, oxygen, humidity and others), which makes this the most complicated cold chain to operate.

This is important in the supply of [[vaccines]] to distant clinics in hot climates served by poorly developed transport networks.  Disruption of a cold chain due to war may produce consequences similar to the [[smallpox]] outbreaks in the Philippines during the [[Spanish–American War]].&lt;ref name="alexcode914"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwi/communicablediseases/chapter9.html|title=Office of Medical History|author=|date=|website=history.amedd.army.mil|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216235803/http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwi/communicablediseases/chapter9.html|archivedate=16 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been numerous events where vaccines have been shipped to third world countries with little to no cold chain infrastructure (Sub-Sahara Africa) where the vaccines were inactivated due to excess exposure to heat.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Patients that thought they were being immunized, in reality were put at greater risk due to the inactivated vaccines they received.  Thus great attention is now being paid to the entire cold chain distribution process to ensure that simple diseases can eventually be eradicated from society.

Traditionally all historical stability data developed for vaccines was based on the temperature range of {{convert|2|–|8|C}}. With recent development of biological products by former vaccine developers, [[biologic medical product|biologics]] has fallen into the same category of storage at {{convert|2|–|8|C}} due to the nature of the products and the lack of testing these products at wider storage conditions.

The cold chain distribution process is an extension of the [[good manufacturing practice]] (GMP) environment that all drugs and biological products are required to adhere to, enforced by the various health regulatory bodies. As such, the distribution process must be validated to ensure that there is no negative impact to the safety, efficacy or quality of the drug substance. The GMP environment requires that all processes that might impact the safety, efficacy or quality of the drug substance must be validated, including storage and distribution of the drug substance.

==Validation==
[[File:Sunwell fish packing pumpable slurry ice.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Slurry ice]] used to ship sensitive food products]]
[[File:FE left view.jpg|thumb|Truck with cooling system]]
A cold chain can be managed by a [[quality management system]]. It should be analyzed, measured, controlled, documented, and [[Validation (drug manufacture)|validated]].

The overall approach to validation of a distribution process is by building more and more qualifications on top of each other to get to a validated state. This is done by executing a component qualification on the packaging components, an operational qualification to demonstrate that the process performs at the operational extremes and finally a performance qualification that demonstrates that what happens in the real world is within the limits of what was demonstrated in the operational qualification limits.

Performing thermal testing can also help with validating the cold chain. Certified test labs use environmental chambers to simulate ambient profiles that a package may encounter in the distribution cycle. Thermocouple probes and separate temperature [[datalogger]]s measure temperatures within the product load to determine the response of the package to the test conditions. [[Replication (statistics)|Replicate]] testing based on a qualification protocols is used to create a final qualification report that can be used to defend the configuration when audited by regulators.  It is normally best to have an individual that understands the principles of validation, when defending such processes to a federal regulatory body of any nation.

Cold chains need to be evaluated and controlled:  
* Carriers and logistics providers can assist shippers. These providers have the technical ability to link with airlines for real time status, generate web-based export documentation and provide electronic tracking.
* The use of [[refrigerator truck]]s, [[refrigerator car]]s, [[Reefer (ship)|reefer ships]], [[Reefer (container)|reefer containers]], and refrigerated warehouses is common.
* Shipment in [[insulated shipping container]]s or other specialised [[packaging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Singh |first= S.

* Temperature sensors may need to be [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) traceable depending on the body monitoring the cold chain. &lt;ref name="NIST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.absoluteautomation.com/cold-chain-temperature-monitoring/|title=Cold Chain Temperature Monitoring - Absolute Automation Blog|author=|date=27 May 2016|website=absoluteautomation.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424020630/http://blog.absoluteautomation.com/cold-chain-temperature-monitoring/|archivedate=24 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Documentation is critical. Each step of the custody chain needs to follow established protocols and to maintain proper records.   Customs delays occur due to inaccurate or incomplete customs paperwork, so basic guidelines for creating a commercial invoice should be followed to ensure the proper verbiage, number of copies, and other details.

During the distribution process one should monitor that process until one builds a sufficient data set that clearly demonstrates the process is in compliance and in a state of control.  Each time the process does not conform to the process, the event should be properly documented, investigated and corrected so that the temperature excursion do not occur on future shipments.  Any anomaly is thus considered to be a Non Conformance and should be assigned as a trackable event.  The event must be reported immediately when it is identified and it is the expectation of the FDA that all adverse events be documented and investigated. The investigation should be completed in a timely manner and must come to some form of a "root cause" and also some form of "corrective action".  The system may potentially stay in a Validated state if the root cause identifies that a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) was not followed or followed incorrectly.  If however a SOP needs to be changed or modified, then the system must be re-validated to demonstrate that the change to the SOP maintains the integrity of the process/system.  A Non-Conformance may also generate a Corrective Action Preventative Action (CAPA), again, a documented process to make corrective or preventative actions to SOP's and other documents.

Non Conformances and CAPA's are an essential part of the overall Quality System in the cGMP environment.  Tracking and trending of these events will also allow businesses to monitor the overall "health" of the systems in place.  Excessive Non Conformances can quickly identify areas of concern for management and allow for corrective actions to be taken.  During regulatory inspections of quality systems, inspectors will frequently ask to review a list of all "open" Non Conformances" so that they can quickly assess how an organization is processing these events and ensuring they are dealt with in a timely manner.

Thus the process is continually evolving and correcting for anomalies that occur in the process.  Eventually the process can evolve into periodic monitoring once sufficient data demonstrates that the process is in a state of control.  Any anomaly that occurs once a process is in a state of control may result in the process being invalidated and not in control and could potentially result in product withdraw from the market to ensure patient safety.  A formal product withdraw is only done when the quality, safety or efficacy of a product is questionable.  A single anomaly would not necessarily require a product withdraw if there is sufficient stability data that demonstrates that excursions will not affect product quality.

It is necessary to develop an internal documentation system as well as multi-party communication standards and protocols to transfer or create a central repository or hub to track information across the supply chain. These systems would monitor equipment status, product temperature history, and custody chain, etc. These help ensure that a food, pharmaceutical, or vaccine is safe and effective when reaching its intended consumer.  It is also important to have a complete [[chain of custody]] for the entire life cycle of a product, so there is documented evidence as to whom had control of the product throughout the lifecycle of the product, up to the final users consumption of the product.

[[File:Universal Contactless Card Symbol.svg|thumb|220px|right|Universal contactless smart card reader symbol]]

A '''contactless smart card''' is a contactless credential whose dimensions are [[credit card|credit-card]] size. Its embedded integrated circuits can store (and sometimes process) data and communicate with a terminal via [[Near-field communication|NFC]]. Commonplace uses include transit tickets, bank cards and passports.

There are two broad categories of contactless smart cards. [[Memory card]]s contain non-volatile memory storage components, and perhaps some specific security logic. Contactless smart cards contain read-only [[radio-frequency identification|RFID]] called CSN (Card Serial Number) or UID, and a re-writeable smart card [[microchip]] that can be transcribed via radio waves.

== Overview ==
[[File:Smartcardchip no text.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Size comparison of chip compared to a Canadian [[Penny (Canadian coin)|penny]]]]
A contactless smart card is characterized as follows:
*Dimensions are normally [[credit card]] size. The ID-1 of [[ISO/IEC 7810]] standard defines them as 85.60 × 53.98 × 0.76&amp;nbsp;mm (3.370 × 2.125 × 0.030 in).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=31432&amp;ICS1=35&amp;ICS2=240&amp;ICS3=15 ISO/IEC 7810:2003 ''Identification cards — Physical characteristics'']&lt;/ref&gt;
*Contains a security system with [[Tamper resistance|tamper-resistant]] properties (e.g. a [[secure cryptoprocessor]], secure file system, human-readable features) and is capable of providing security services (e.g. confidentiality of information in the memory).
*Assets managed by way of a central administration systems, or applications, which receive or interchange information with the card, such as card hotlisting and updates for application data.
*Card data is transferred via radio waves to the central administration system through card read-write devices, such as [[Payment terminal|point of sales]] devices, doorway access control readers, ticket readers, [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]s, USB-connected desktop readers, etc.

=== Benefits ===
Contactless smart cards can be used for identification, authentication, and data storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
 | title = Multi-application Smart Cards
 | publisher = Cambridge University Press
}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also provide a means of effecting business transactions in a flexible, secure, standard way with minimal human intervention.

== History ==
Contactless smart cards were first used for electronic ticketing in 1995 in Seoul, South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/922633321|title=Smart card programming : a comprehensive guide to smart card programming in C/C++, Java, C#, VB.NET|last=Ugo,|first=Chirico,|isbn=1291610502|edition= Second |location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=922633321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2010|title=4th Asian Transport Revenue Collection Forum|url=http://www.apsca.org/events/info.php?event=121|journal=Asia Pacific Smart Card Association|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, smart cards with contactless interfaces have been increasingly popular for payment and ticketing applications such as  mass transit. Globally, contactless fare collection is being employed for efficiencies in public transit.  The various standards emerging are local in focus and are not compatible, though the [[MIFARE]] Classic card from Philips has a large market share in the United States and Europe.

In more recent times, [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] and [[MasterCard]] have agreed to standards for general "open loop" payments on their networks, with millions of cards deployed in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartcardalliance.org/pages/publications-contactless-payments-faq Smartcard Alliance FAQ on contactless bank cards]&lt;/ref&gt; in Europe and around the world.

Smart cards are being introduced in personal identification and entitlement schemes at regional, national, and international levels. Citizen cards, drivers’ licenses, and patient card schemes are becoming more prevalent. In Malaysia, the compulsory national ID scheme [[MyKad]] includes 8 different applications and is rolled out for 18 million users. Contactless smart cards are being integrated into [[ICAO]] [[biometric passport]]s to enhance security for international travel.

=== Readers ===
Contactless smart card readers use radio waves to communicate with, and both read and write data on a smart card. When used for electronic payment, they are commonly located near [[PIN pad]]s, cash registers and other places of payment. When the readers are used for public transit they are commonly located on fare boxes, ticket machines, turnstiles, and station platforms as a standalone unit. When used for security, readers are usually located to the side of an entry door.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Technology==
[[File:RF-Smartcard.svg|thumb|RF smart card schematic]]
A contactless smart card is a card in which the chip communicates with the card reader through an induction technology similar to that of an [[RFID]] (at data rates of 106 to 848 kbit/s).  These cards require only close proximity to an antenna to complete a transaction. They are often used when transactions must be processed quickly or hands-free, such as on mass transit systems, where a smart card can be used without even removing it from a [[wallet]].

The standard for contactless smart card communications is [[ISO/IEC 14443]]. It defines two types of contactless cards ("A" and "B")&lt;ref name=14443-2&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=28729 ISO/IEC 14443-2:2001 Identification cards – Contactless integrated circuit(s) cards – Proximity cards – Part 2: Radio frequency power and signal interface]&lt;/ref&gt; and allows for communications at distances up to {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}}{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}. There had been proposals for ISO/IEC 14443 types C, D, E, F and G that have been rejected by the International Organization for Standardization. An alternative standard for contactless smart cards is [[ISO/IEC 15693]], which allows communications at distances up to {{convert|50|cm|ft|abbr=on}}.

Examples of widely used contactless smart cards are [[Taiwan]]'s [[EasyCard]], [[Hong Kong]]'s [[Octopus card]], [[Shanghai]]'s [[Shanghai Public Transportation Card|Public Transportation Card]],  [[South Korea]]'s [[T-money]] (bus, subway, taxi), [[London]]'s [[Oyster card]], [[Beijing]]'s [[Beijing Municipal Administration and Communications Card|Municipal Administration and Communications Card]], [[Southern Ontario]]'s [[Presto card]], [[Japan Rail]]'s [[Suica]] Card, the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]'s [[Clipper Card]], [[Myki|Melbourne's Myki Card]], [[Opal card|Sydney's Opal Card]] and [[India]]'s [[More Card]] which predate the ISO/IEC 14443 standard. The following tables list smart cards used for [[public transportation]] and other [[electronic purse]] applications.

A related contactless technology is [[RFID]] (radio frequency identification). In certain cases, it can be used for applications similar to those of contactless smart cards, such as for [[electronic toll collection]].  RFID devices usually do not include writeable memory or microcontroller processing capability as contactless smart cards often do.{{Dubious |reason=Contactless smart cards use RFID technology -- RFID is a generic term|date=March 2017}}

There are dual-interface cards that implement contactless and contact interfaces on a single card with some shared storage and processing.  An example is [[Porto]]'s multi-application transport card, called [[Andante ticket|Andante]], that uses a chip in contact and contactless (ISO/IEC 14443 type B) mode.

Like smart cards with contacts, contactless cards do not have a battery.  Instead, they use a built-in [[inductor]], using the principle of [[resonant inductive coupling]], to capture some of the incident electromagnetic signal, [[rectifier|rectify]] it, and use it to power the card's electronics.

==Applications==
{{See also|List of smart cards}}

=== Transportation ===
Since the start of using the [[Upass (South Korea)|Seoul Transportation Card]], numerous cities have moved to the introduction of contactless smart cards as the fare media in an [[automated fare collection system]].

In a number of cases these cards carry an [[electronic wallet]] as well as fare products, and can be used for low-value payments.

===Contactless bank cards===
Starting around 2005, a major application of the technology has been [[contactless payment]] credit and debit cards.  Some major examples include:

* [[ExpressPay]] – [[American Express]]
* [[MasterCard Contactless]] (formerly PayPass) – [[MasterCard]]
* [[Visa Contactless]] (formerly payWave) – [[Visa Inc.|Visa]]
* [[QuickPass]] – [[China UnionPay|UnionPay]]
* QUICPay (overseas J/Speedy) – [[JCB Co., Ltd.|JCB]]
* RuPay Contactless - [[RuPay]]
* Zip – [[Discover Card|Discover]]

Roll-outs started in 2005 in the United States, and in 2006 in some parts of Europe and Asia (Singapore).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ComfortDelgro introduces contactless credit card payment|url=http://news.xin.msn.com/en/singapore/article.aspx?cp-documentid=4973581|work=contactless credit card payment}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., contactless (non [[personal identification number|PIN]]) transactions cover a payment range of ~$5–$100.

In general there are two classes of contactless bank cards: magnetic stripe data (MSD) and contactless [[EMV]].

Contactless MSD cards are similar to magnetic stripe cards in terms of the data they share across the contactless interface. They are only distributed in the U.S. Payment occurs in a similar fashion to mag-stripe, without a PIN and often in off-line mode (depending on parameters of the terminal). The security level of such a transaction is better than a mag-stripe card, as the chip cryptographically generates a code which can be verified by the card issuer's systems.

Contactless EMV cards have two interfaces (contact and contactless) and work as a normal EMV card via their contact interface. The contactless interface provides similar data to a contact EMV transaction, but usually a subset of the capabilities (e.g. usually issuers will not allow balances to be increased via the contactless interface, instead requiring the card to be inserted into a device which uses the contact interface). EMV cards may carry an "offline balance" stored in their chip, similar to the [[electronic wallet]] or "purse" that users of transit smart cards are used to.

===Identification===
A quickly growing application is in digital identification cards. In this application, the cards are used for [[authentication]] of identity. The most common example is in conjunction with a [[Public key infrastructure|PKI]]. The smart card will store an encrypted digital certificate issued from the PKI along with any other relevant or needed information about the card holder. Examples include the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) [[Common Access Card]] (CAC), and the use of various smart cards by many governments as identification cards for their citizens. When combined with biometrics, smart cards can provide two- or three-factor authentication. Smart cards are not always a privacy-enhancing technology, for the subject carries possibly incriminating information about him all the time. By employing contactless smart cards, that can be read without having to remove the card from the wallet or even the garment it is in, one can add even more authentication value to the human carrier of the cards.

===Other===
The Malaysian government uses smart card technology in the [[identity cards]] carried by all Malaysian citizens and resident non-citizens. The personal information inside the smart card (called [[MyKad]]) can be read using special APDU commands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpn.gov.my// MyKad website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security==
Smart cards have been advertised as suitable for personal identification tasks, because they are engineered to be [[tamper resistant]]. The embedded chip of a smart card usually implements some [[cryptography|cryptographic algorithm]]. There are, however, several methods of recovering some of the algorithm's internal state.

===Differential power analysis===
Differential power analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
 | title = Power Analysis Attacks
 | publisher = Springer
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
involves measuring the precise time and [[electric current]]{{Dubious|How does one measure the precise current drawn by a contactless card?|date=September 2010}} required for certain encryption or decryption operations. This is most often used against public key algorithms such as [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] in order to deduce the on-chip private key, although some implementations of symmetric ciphers can be vulnerable to timing or power attacks as well.

===Physical disassembly===
Smart cards can be physically disassembled by using acid, abrasives, or some other technique to obtain direct, unrestricted access to the on-board microprocessor. Although such techniques obviously involve a fairly high risk of permanent damage to the chip, they permit much more detailed information (e.g. photomicrographs of encryption hardware) to be extracted.

==Concerns==
;Failure rate: The plastic card in which the chip is embedded is fairly flexible, and the larger the chip, the higher the probability of breaking. Smart cards are often carried in wallets or pockets — a fairly harsh environment for a chip. However, for large banking systems, the failure-management cost can be more than offset by the fraud reduction. A [[card enclosure]] may be used as an alternative to help prevent the smart card from failing.
;Privacy: Using a smart card for mass transit presents a risk for [[privacy]], because such a system enables the mass transit operator (and the authorities) to track the movement of individuals. In Finland, the Data Protection [[Ombudsman]] prohibited the transport operator [[Helsinki Metropolitan Area Council|YTV]] from collecting such information, in spite of YTV's argument that the owner of the card has the right to get a list of journeys paid with the card. Prior to this, such information was used in the investigation of the [[Myyrmanni bombing]].
;Theft and fraud: Contactless technology does not necessarily prevent use of a PIN for authentication of the user, but it is common for low value transactions (bank credit or debit card purchase, or public transport fare payment) not to require a PIN. This may make such cards more likely to be stolen, or used fraudulently by the finder of someone else's lost card.
;Use abroad: Inland data networks quickly convey information between terminals and central banking systems, such that contactless payment limits may be monitored and managed. This may not be possible with use of such cards when abroad.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
;Multiple cards detection: When two or more contactless cards are in close proximity the system may have difficulty determining which card is intended to be used. The card-reader may charge the incorrect card or reject both.&lt;ref name=TFL&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch out for card clash|url=https://www.tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/contactless/card-clash|website=[[Transport for London]]|publisher=Mayor of London|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is generally only an issue where a service provider uses a payment card to facilitate access - eg a wallet containing a parking lot access card, an apartment building entry card and various contactless payment cards can usually be used on entry to a car park or whatever  - the car park entry system can detect its own card in the wallet and open the barrier.   In a retail shop, however, it is advisable to remove the individual contactless card from the wallet when making a payment.  At the very least this gives the cardholder the opportunity to communicate which card they intend to be used to make payment.   It is an issue of the card identifying a subscription -v- payment by transaction.{{clarify|date=December 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3390">A '''coolpower''' setup in a [[truck]] [[engine]] can use an [[aftercooler]] mounted on top of the engine with a tip turbine fan, or an air-to-air cooler in front of the radiator. In either case, the goal is to cool the hot, compressed air going from the turbocharger into the engine. With the tip turbine, a small quantity of compressed air is bled off to spin a small fan that draws air through the aftercooler tubes. In some later models, a water cooler was also used, in addition to the tip turbine setup. Mack called the tip-turbine setup an intercooler and used a pyrometer to alert the operator if the [[exhaust gas]] exceeded a limit. The tip turbine setup was compact and the shorter plumbing runs allowed boost to build faster. Later models with the front mounted air-to-air cooler required a larger turbocharger to fill the tubes faster but with the benefit of additional power. Modern trucks use the air-to-air cooler in nearly all cases. 

Large [[Mack Trucks|Mack]] trucks from the 1970s such as the Mack [[Mack R series|R-600]] used coolpower systems. Some coolpower systems used vertical bar shutters that could be opened and shut in front of the radiator to maintain proper [[operating temperature]]. 

The Mack Cruise Liner model built in 1984, a 6X4 Primemover, used a 
{{convert|320|hp}} coolpower engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trucksplus.com.au/truck_detail.asp?iTruckID=17 Trucks Plus&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109212540/http://trucksplus.com.au/truck_detail.asp?iTruckID=17 |date=2007-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other meanings==
===Air intakes on turbochargers===
The term is also used to refer to “Cool Power” air intake systems for [[turbo]]charged engines. These systems provide cooler air to the turbocharger and engine, instead of the potentially too-warm air from the engine compartment. Cooler intake air is denser, which means that the engine can produce the same power with less fuel. Cooler air also gives the engine more power for applications such as towing heavy loads up driving up steep grades during the summer. Cooler air drawn into the engine compartment lowers the temperature under the hood, which allows  plastic, rubber and electronic parts to last longer. Lastly, cool power systems will supports larger turbochargers by creating additional air flow to the engine.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.psmdiesel.com/air_03_without.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydraulic drive system===
The US military uses the expression "cool power" to describe its "regenerative drive unit", a "light-weight hybrid hydraulic drive system" that weighs 330 pounds. The "system can generate nearly {{convert|1000|ft.lbf|N.m}} of torque and power equivalent to a {{convert|340|hp}} engine." It operates by storing "energy normally lost as heat during the braking process in a high-pressure oil tank called an accumulator." The system use two hydraulic-fluid storage devices controlled by a central processor. One of the reasons the US military is interested in the system is that its "cool" power allows vehicles to move "... without generating a "thermal footprint" that can be identified by enemy tracking systems."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2003/03/03/156278.html Permo-Drive Unveils Compact Hydraulic Drive System at 2003 SAE Show&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Delphi''' '''Forums''' is a [[United States|U.S.]] [[online service provider]] and since the mid 1990s has been a community [[internet forum]] site.  It started as a nationwide [[dialup service]] in 1983.  Delphi Forums remains active as of 2016, claiming 4 million registered members and "more than 8,000 active Forums" in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.delphiforums.com|title=Delphi Forums|work=Delphi Forums|accessdate=16 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060414191355/http://forums.delphiforums.com/|archivedate=14 April 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The company that became Delphi was founded by [[Wes Kussmaul]] as Kussmaul Encyclopedia in 1981, featured [[ASCII]]-based encyclopedia, [[E-mail]], and a primitive chat. Newswires, bulletin boards and better chat were added in early 1982.

Kussmaul recalled:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Delphi was actually launched in October 1981, at Jerry Milden's Northeast Computer Show, as the Kussmaul Encyclopedia--the world's first commercially available computerized encyclopedia. (Frank Greenagle's Arête Encyclopedia was announced at about the same time, but you couldn't buy it until much later.) The Kussmaul Encyclopedia was actually a complete home computer system (your choice of Tandy Color Computer or Apple II) with a 300-bps modem that dialed up to a VAX computer hosting our online encyclopedia database. We sold the system for about the same price and terms as Britannica. People wandered around in it and were impressed with the ease with which they could find information. We had a wonderful cross-referencing system that turned every occurrence of a word that was the name of an entry in the encyclopedia into a hypertext link—in 1981...&lt;ref&gt;Kussmaul, Wes. Own Your Privacy. PKI Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 1982 Wes hired Glenn McIntyre as a software engineer primarily doing internal systems.  Glenn brought in colleagues Kip Bryan and Dan Bruns.  Kip wrote the software that became Delphi Conference and Delphi Forums.  Dan, (another very strong software person) upon finishing his MBA at Harvard, become President and subsequently CEO when Wes moved on to form Global Villages.

On March 15, 1983, the Delphi name was first used by General Videotex Corporation. Forums were text-based, and accessed via [[Telenet]], [[Sprintnet]], [[Tymnet]], Uninet, and [[Datapac]] ([[Canada]]).

Delphi was extended to Argentina in 1985, through a partnership with the Argentine IT company Siscotel S.A.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.monografias.com/trabajos89/desarrollo-internet-argentina/desarrollo-internet-argentina.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Delphi partnered with [[ASCII (company)|ASCII Corp.]] of [[Japan]] to open online services in 1991.

Delphi provided national consumer access to the Internet in 1992. Features included E-mail (July 1992), [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], [[Telnet]], [[Usenet]], text-based [[World Wide Web|Web]] access (November 1992), [[MUD]]s, [[Finger protocol|Finger]], and [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]]. "To a lot of people at the time, we seemed to be in an enviable position" says Dan Bruns, Delphi's CEO. "But we didn't have a lot of financing to fuel our growth..."&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/1999/11/01/270056/index.htm|title=They Coulda Been Contenders Once upon a time, Delphi was fighting it out with AOL. Then along came Rupert. - November 1, 1999|publisher=Money.cnn.com|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 Delphi was sold to [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation]]. News Corporation recognized that there would be growth in consumer use of the internet and attempted to use Delphi as its vehicle. It had 125,000 text-based customers in 1995 and had 150 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/21341433.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun+24%2C+1995&amp;author=Irving+Murphy%2C+Globe+Staff&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=Tenants%2C+acreage+added+at+former+Wang+Towers&amp;pqatl=google&amp;#160|title=Tenants, acreage added at former Wang Towers|publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Murdoch hired away IBM's director of high-performance computing and communications, Alan Baratz, in 1994 to run Delphi.  Bruns and General Manager Rusty Williams stayed on. Delphi peaked with 500,000 paid subscribers and about 600 employees.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt;

By 1995, Delphi had lost many of its subscribers, and Bruns left Delphi.  In 1996, NewsCorp decided to exit the online business, was laying off almost half of Delphi's employees and wanted to sell or close Delphi.  Dan Bruns and some of Delphi's original investors bought Delphi from NewsCorp for an undisclosed amount.  With only 50,000 paying subscribers left, Delphi was back to its pre-NewsCorp size. "We were on the same growth slope, but this time we were going down instead of up," he says. "It felt a little poetic."&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt;

In 1996, Delphi launched a free, ad-supported managed-content website with associated [[Internet forum|message boards]] and [[chat room]]s, under the management of a team led by Dan Bruns and which included Bill Louden, who had headed [[GEnie]] during its heyday. For a period of time, both text-based and web-based community services were available. After a year as a managed content site, Delphi reinvented itself as a community-driven service that allowed anyone to create an online community.

Prospero Technologies was formed in January 2000 as the merger of Delphi Forums and Wellengaged. Webpages for forums were discontinued.

In 2001, [[Robert Brazell|Rob Brazell]] purchased Delphi Forums, merged it with eHow and Idea Exchange, and formed Blue Frogg Enterprises. The Delphi.com domain was sold to [[Delphi Corporation]], the auto parts manufacturer. Prospero partnered with [[Inforonics]].

In 2002, Prospero reacquired Delphi Forums, joining it with [[Talk City]] to form Delphi Forums LLC.

In 2008, online community developer [[Mzinga]] acquired Littleton-based Prospero Technologies LLC, which was then owned by Bruce Buckland, chairman and CEO of Mallory Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoominfo.com/CachedPage/?archive_id=0&amp;page_id=-1780311578&amp;page_url=//www.ceo-roundtable.com/members_news_march2008.asp?pageid=7&amp;page_last_updated=2012-12-10T01:40:15&amp;firstName=Bruce&amp;lastName=Buckland|title=ZoomInfo Cached Page|publisher=Ceo-roundtable.com|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2009, a Forrester Research analyst reported on [[Twitter]] that Mzinga was having financial difficulties after it had completed a second round of layoffs.&lt;ref&gt;"Social Downsizing, the Boston Globe, March 29, 2009"&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 1, 2011, Mzinga sold Delphiforums back to early owner Dan Bruns.

[[File:Delphi Forums 30th Anniversary.gif|thumbnail|Delphi's 30th Anniversary Logo (2013)]]
In February 2013, Delphi Forums celebrated its 30th anniversary.  Delphi owner Dan Bruns said  "It's true that the Delphi that launched in 1983 was very different from today's internet," Bruns said, "but one thing remains the same: places like Delphi Forums provide a friendly, comfortable setting for people to share common interests and passions and to build lasting friendships. If we keep that simple truth in mind, we have a terrific legacy to build on going forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.delphiforums.com/delphihistory/messages?msg=261.1|title=Delphi Forums Celebrates 30 Years|work=Delphi Forums|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2014, Delphi Forums began a beta test of a new forum software, called Zeta Delphi.  The current long-time format, now called Classic Delphi, also remains, and hosts may use either software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.delphiforums.com/zetabeta/messages?msg=522.1|title=1/15 Release Notes|work=Delphi Forums|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Delphi Wednesday science fiction group==
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Delphi had a regular Wednesday night chat group (long before [[IRC]] and other chat programs became mainstream). Frequent attendees in this group included several professional science fiction writers, including Susan Casper, [[Pat Cadigan]], [[Mike Resnick]], [[Michael A. Banks]], [[Jack L. Chalker]], [[Lawrence Watt-Evans]], [[Gardner Dozois]], [[Janet Kagen]], [[Lawrence Person]], [[Martha Soukup]], [[Barbara Delaplace]] and [[Orson Scott Card]] among others.

[[File:XtaLAB Synergy-S picture No. 5 Ver3 2016.09.19.jpg|thumb|Rigaku [https://www.rigaku.com/en/products/smc/synergy XtaLAB Synergy-S] modern single crystal X-ray diffractometer]]
A '''diffractometer''' (pronunciation: di-"frak-'tä-m&amp;-t&amp;r) is a [[measuring instrument]] for analyzing the structure of a material from the [[scattering]] pattern produced when a beam of [[radiation]] or particles (such as [[X-ray]]s or [[neutron]]s) interacts with it.

==Principle==
[[Image:2D x-ray diffractometer at University of Helsinki in English.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The detector end of a simple x-ray diffractometer with an area detector. The direction of the X-rays is indicated with the red arrow.]]
Because it is relatively easy to use [[electron]]s or [[neutron]]s having [[wavelength]]s smaller than a nanometer, electrons and neutrons may be used to study crystal structure in a manner very similar to [[X-ray diffraction]]. Electrons do not penetrate as deeply into matter as X-rays, hence electron diffraction reveals structure near the surface; neutrons do penetrate easily and have an advantage that they possess an intrinsic magnetic moment that causes them to interact differently with atoms having different alignments of their magnetic moments.

A typical diffractometer consists of a source of radiation, a [[monochromator]] to choose the wavelength, slits to adjust the shape of the beam, a sample and a [[detector]]. In a more complicated apparatus, a [[goniometer]] can also be used for fine adjustment of the sample and the detector positions. When an area detector is used to monitor the diffracted radiation, a beamstop is usually needed to stop the intense primary beam that has not been diffracted by the sample, otherwise the detector might be damaged. Usually the beamstop can be completely impenetrable to the X-rays or it may be semitransparent. The use of a semitransparent beamstop allows the possibility to determine how much the sample [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbs]] the radiation using the [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] observed through the beamstop.

There are several types of X-ray diffractometer, depending of the research field (material sciences, powder diffraction, life sciences, structural biology, etc.) and the experimental environment, if it is a laboratory with its home X-ray source or a [[Synchrotron]].
In laboratory, diffractometers are usually a "all in one" equipment, including the diffractometer, the video microscope and the X-ray source. Plenty of companies manufacture "all in one" equipment for X-ray home laboratory, such as [[Rigaku]], [[PANalytical]], [[Thermo Fisher Scientific]], [[Bruker]], and many others.

There are fewer diffractometer manufacturers for [[synchrotron]], owing to few numbers of x-ray beamlines to equip and the need of solid expertise of the manufacturer.
For material sciences, Huber diffractometers are widely known and, for structural biology, [[Arinax]] diffractometers are the reference.

Nonetheless, due to few numbers of manufacturers, a large amount of [[synchrotron]] diffractometers are "Homemade" diffractometers, realized by synchrotron engineers team.

[[File:Different Flashback Arrestors.jpg|alt=Different examples of typical Flashback arrestors for different applications|thumb|Flashback arrestors with different size and flow rate, and different connections]]
A '''flashback arrestor''' or flash arrestor is a gas safety device most commonly used in [[oxy-fuel welding and cutting]] to stop the [[flame]] or reverse flow of gas back up into the equipment or supply line.  It protects the user and equipment from damage or explosions.  These devices are mainly used in industrial processes where oxy-fuel gas mixtures are handled and used.  Flashback arrestors as safety products are essential to secure the workplaces and working environment.  In former times '''wet''' flashback arrestors were also used.  Today the industry standard is to use '''dry''' flashback arrestors with at least two safety elements.

==Dry type==
Dry '''flashback arrestors''' typically use a combination of safety elements to stop a [[flashback (welding)|flashback]] or reverse flow of gas.  This type is typically found in cutting and welding applications all over the world.   They work equally effectively in all orientations, and need very little maintenance.  In many countries or regions they are mandatory to be installed at the gas regulator or gas outlet/ tapping point.  Depending on the application they are also often used at the torch side as an additional safety device.
 
Flashback arrestors help prevent:

* Further gas flow in the case of pressure shocks.
* The entry of air or oxygen into the distribution line or single cylinders.
* Flashbacks which are the rapid propagation of a flame down the hose.
* Further gas flow in the event of a burnback.

According to the norm EN 730-1 / ISO 5175 they include a minimum of two safety elements:

A gas non-return valve (NV), which:
* prevents dangerous gas mixtures.
* ensures the gas only flows in the intended direction.

and a flame arrestor (FA), which:
* cools the flame to below the ignition temperature of the gas or gas mixture.
* prevents flashback.

In addition to these two basic safety functions a flashback arrestor can also have a:

Thermal cut-off valve (TV), which:
* prevents excessive temperatures.
* closes automatically at a certain temperature and cuts off the gas flow long before the ignition temperature of the gas mixture is reached.

and a pressure-sensitive gas cut-off valve (PV), which stops the gas flow in the event of pressure shocks

The flashback arrestors are suitable for most technical gases (fuel gases) such as acetylene, hydrogen, methane, propane, propylene and butane as well as oxygen and compressed air.

Flashback arrestors have to be tested for gas non-return, for tightness and for gas flow by a qualified person depending on the country specific regulations.

==Wet type==
Liquid seal flame arrestors are liquid barriers following the principle of a siphon where the liquid stops the entering deflagration and/or detonation and extinguishes the flame, they work by bubbling the gas through a non-flammable and ideally non-[[gaseous diffusion|gas-absorbing]] liquid, which is typically [[water]]. They stop the flame by preventing it from reaching the submerged intake.

These devices are normally very effective at stopping flashbacks from reaching the protected side of the system. They have the disadvantages of only working in one orientation and tend to be much larger than dry type arrestors. This makes them mainly only suitable for large or fixed installations and the liquid level needs to be constantly checked.

On smaller units having a pressure release valve to prevent the unit from bursting under a severe flashback, the fluid level should be monitored to keep it always above the intake and not so high that the liquid could splash or overflow into the outlet.

'''George Berkeley Ross''' (January 24, 1918 – September 1, 2006) was an early pioneer of information technology in the American petroleum industry who spearheaded the digitization of the exploration for petroleum.

==Biography==

===Early Life at Humble===
In 1936, Ross started his career working as a mail boy for [[Humble Oil]] in [[Midland, Texas]], the epicenter of the oil boom.  Ross married Virginia Louise Elkin of the well-established Midland family in 1941. Fifty years later after serving on the team that had developed the software to computerize the geological exploration for oil, Ross ended his long and successful career as a Senior Analyst for Exploration Systems in Computer Geology at [[Exxon]].

Ross’s mathematical aptitude took him up the corporate ladder. After short stints as a gas station attendant in [[Odessa, Texas|Odessa]] and the mailroom in Midland, he was tapped for the assignment of Field Lab Assistant plotting well logs in the Geologic Lease and Scouting Department, a post that permitted him to work alongside the Scouts in West Texas.

===World War II===
World War II intervened, and Ross served as a first lieutenant in the artillery corps of the [[Ozark Division]] of the [[102nd Infantry]] in the Allied invasion of [[Europe]].

A member of the [[US Army Reserve]] since his high school days in [[San Antonio]], Ross’s mathematical background made him a natural for field artillery. He served with distinction in the European theatre. After landing at [[Normandy]], Ross saw action as the Ozark Division advanced across the border between the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]]. They crossed the [[Wurm]] and [[Roer]] Rivers and occupied the sector from [[Homburg, Saarland|Homburg]] to [[Düsseldorf]]. In April 1945, Ross and the Ozark Division crossed the [[Rhine]] where they encountered stiff opposition in the [[Wesergebirge]], then pushed on to the [[Elbe]], where they halted on orders and established an outpost {{convert|48|mi|km}} from [[Berlin]], occupying their position until [[V-E Day]].

===Wildcatting in Texas and New Mexico===
During the post-war period, Ross remained in the [[US Army Reserve]]. Shortly after his return to Texas, Humble’s Chief Scout, [[Dave Fransen]], urged Ross to accept the position of Junior Scout in West Texas. In his new capacity, Ross worked with wildcats drilling in the [[Kelly-Snyder Field]] and the [[Sprayberry Trend Area Field]], an area fifty-five miles long and twenty miles wide that now contains two thousand oil wells.

In 1953, the Rosses moved their growing family to [[Roswell, New Mexico]], which had become a hive of wildcatting that kept Ross busy monitoring leases, expiration dates and drilling schedules.

The [[Korean War]] intervened, and Ross was recalled to active military duty. Serving as a [[Major (United States)|major]] in [[Field Artillery]] Operations with the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] in Korea and [[Japan]], Ross supervised supply chain management for forces engaged on the peninsula. After he completed two years of service, Ross came home to Roswell now as a Senior Scout, but soon he and his family returned to corporate headquarters in Midland where he continued to contribute to Humble’s drilling success.

===The Pentagon years and the Short Range Committee===
At the same time, Ross maintained his military commission and served annual tours at the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] under a succession of Secretaries of Defence: [[Charles Erwin Wilson|Charles E. Wilson]]; [[Neil H. McElroy]] and [[Thomas S. Gates]]. With twenty years of military service behind him, Ross retired from the [[Army]], but he remained an active veteran attending annual reunions into this century. It was at the Pentagon in the late fifties where Ross first learned about the potential of computerization and information technology and became privy to the work of the [[Short Range Committee]] that led to the origin of [[COBOL]] (Common Business-Oriented Language).

===Writing code in COBOL and FORTRAN===
The need to control and manage the torrent of information and geological data flooding into the petroleum corporations inspired Ross and a small group of perceptive industry savants to pursue the adaptation of computing technology and harness it to the geological exploration for oil. In order to contribute to the design of a viable corporate information technology strategy, Ross taught himself COBOL and the IBM Mathematical Formula Translating System (FORTRAN). Very esoteric subjects in 1962, computer programming and software development would have mystified the average person, but for Ross, a naturally gifted mathematician, they were a piece of cake. He was to become a self-taught expert in many fields. In addition to his studies of computer programming, Ross studied law, geology, economics, mathematics and government.

===Computerizing geological exploration for petroleum===
In the early 1960s, the major companies set up the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] Well Data System, and Ross was selected for work on three of its key committees. In addition to developing computer codes, Ross helped design formats for reporting data relevant to geological exploration. In 1966, Humble began to organize its own internal Information Systems project, and Ross was appointed a member of the first group in Midland. By this time, Ross had been named Scouting Supervisor, but with the pace of technological change his duties increasingly focused on the analysis of records that could best be done by computerization.

In 1970, Ross was promoted to his new post as a Senior Analyst in Computer Geology for the Exploration Information Systems based at the Humble corporate headquarters in [[Houston]]. In his new capacity, Ross managed the computerization of an important portion of the oil industry, geological exploration. Ross had started working in geological analysis when recordkeeping was completely manual, and he had been an integral player in the digitization of the most crucial part of the industry, exploration for new sources of petroleum.

===Later life===
In 1986 on his fiftieth anniversary with [[Humble-Exxon]], Ross was the subject of a lengthy article in [[Exploration Update]] that highlighted his pivotal contribution to the industry. He retired later that year to enter an active retirement filled with travel, cultural pursuits and charitable activities.

A lifelong enthusiast of museums, libraries, the theatre and cultural institutions, Ross launched into a whirlwind of activities to support worthy causes. [[The Alley Theater]], the [[Commemorative Air Force]], the [[Pioneers of the Permian Basin]], [[American Indian College]], [[Lindenwood University]] and [[Mount Holyoke College]] all benefited from his patronage.

Ross was keenly interested in the conservation of natural resources, especially petroleum, and he was an authority on public transportation. A great advocate of rail travel, he supported many railroad organizations in Texas and in several other states. Ross firmly believed that government could and should do much more to invest in rebuilding America’s railroads and adapting new light rail systems for urban transport.

In Europe, Ross admired the much more advanced public transportation systems. While travelling on [[Eurostar]], a high speed train that runs through the [[Channel Tunnel]] between [[Paris]] and [[London]], Ross experienced a vision of the future of swift, clean, efficient and ecologically sound mass transit that inspired him to carry his message to the powers that be back home in America. Many public officials benefited from Ross’s analyses of the need for a more serious approach to mass transportation in America in general and Texas in particular.

In addition to his many public and official pursuits, Ross was a highly accomplished ballroom dancer who cut a dashing figure at the [[Petroleum Club]] and [[Lechner’s]], a favourite restaurant in Houston. Ross performed elegant versions of the [[Waltz]] and the [[Polka]], and he did a masterful and energetic version of the [[Texas Two-Step]].

'''George M. Bretz''' (1842-1895) was an American [[photographer]] who is best known for his photographs of the [[Northeastern Pennsylvania]] [[Coal Region]] and its coal miners.

A collection of Bretz's original [[glass plate]] negatives from the Kohinoor Mine at the [[Shenandoah, Pennsylvania|Shenandoah]] [[Colliery]] were recently rediscovered at the [[National Museum of American History]]. Taken circa 1884, this was one of the earliest fully illuminated photo shoots in an underground mine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/08/the-smithsonian-goes-deep-inside-an-old-pennsylvania-coal-mine/244045/ The Smithsonian Goes Deep Inside an Old Pennsylvania Coal Mine], Aug. 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; These photographs were displayed at the  1884 [[World Cotton Centennial]] in [[New Orleans]], and again at the 1893 [[World’s Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]]. Bretz is also known for his photos of alleged [[Molly Maguires]], radical coal miners who fought against unfair labor practices in the coal fields. For the rest of his life, Bretz was considered an authority on [[coal mining]], and articles about his photography were widely published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://contentdm.ad.umbc.edu/cdm/search/collection/georgebretz/field/all/mode/all/conn/and/order/identi/ad/asc George Bretz Collection] at the [[University of Maryland]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Audiovisual.jpg|thumb|Hi-fi speakers are a key component of quality audio reproduction.]]

'''High fidelity''' (often shortened to '''hi-fi''' or '''hifi''') is a term used by listeners, [[audiophile]]s and [[home audio]] enthusiasts to refer to high-quality [[sound reproduction|reproduction of sound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hartley |first1=H. A. |title=Audio Design Handbook |url=http://www.tech-systems-labs.com/books/hartley.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-08-08 |year=1958 |publisher=Gernsback Library |location=New York, New York |id=[[Library of Congress]] Catalog Card No. 57-9007 |page=200 |chapter=High fidelity |quote=I invented the phrase 'high fidelity' in 1927 to denote a type of sound reproduction that might be taken rather seriously by a music lover. In those days the average radio or phonograph equipment sounded pretty horrible but, as I was really interested in music, it occurred to me that something might be done about it. |ref=Hartley}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to the lower quality sound produced by inexpensive audio equipment, or the inferior quality of sound reproduction that can be heard in recordings made until the late 1940s.

Ideally, high-fidelity equipment has inaudible [[noise]] and [[distortion]], and a flat (neutral, uncolored) [[frequency response]] within the [[human hearing range]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hi-fiworld.co.uk/amplifiers/75-amp-tests/147-frequency-response.html|title=Frequency response|website=www.hi-fiworld.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Bell Laboratories]] began experimenting with a range of recording techniques in the early 1930s.  Performances by [[Leopold Stokowski]] and the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] were recorded in 1931 and 1932 using telephone lines between the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]] in [[Philadelphia]] and the Bell labs in New Jersey.  Some [[multitrack recording]]s were made on optical sound film, which led to new advances used primarily by [[MGM]] (as early as 1937) and [[Twentieth Century Fox|20th Century-Fox Film Corporation]] (as early as 1941).  [[RCA Victor]] began recording performances by several orchestras using optical sound around 1941, resulting in higher-fidelity masters for 78-rpm discs. During the 1930s, [[Avery Fisher]], an amateur [[violin]]ist, began experimenting with audio design and [[acoustics]]. He wanted to make a radio that would sound like he was listening to a live orchestra—that would achieve high fidelity to the original sound.  After [[World War II]], [[Harry F. Olson]] conducted an experiment whereby test subjects listened to a live orchestra through a hidden variable acoustic filter. The results proved that listeners preferred high fidelity reproduction, once the noise and distortion introduced by early sound equipment was removed.

Beginning in 1948, several innovations created the conditions that made for major improvements of home-audio quality possible:

* [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording]], based on technology taken from Germany after WWII, helped musical artists such as [[Bing Crosby]] make and distribute recordings with better fidelity.
* The advent of the 33⅓ rpm [[Long Play]] (LP) microgroove [[vinyl record]], with lower surface noise and quantitatively specified [[RIAA equalization|equalization curves]] as well as noise-reduction and dynamic range systems. [[Classical music]] fans, who were [[opinion leadership|opinion leaders]] in the audio market, quickly adopted LPs because, unlike with older records, most classical works would fit on a single LP.
* [[FM radio]], with wider audio bandwidth and less susceptibility to signal interference and fading than [[AM radio]].
* Better [[electronic amplifier|amplifier]] designs, with more attention to frequency response and much higher power output capability, reproducing audio without perceptible [[distortion]].&lt;ref name="Lander"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/3/2006_3_13.shtml David Lander] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223172555/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/3/2006_3_13.shtml |date=2007-02-23 }} "The Buyable Past: Classic Hi-Fi Components," ''American Heritage'', June/July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* New [[loudspeaker]] designs, including acoustic suspension, developed by [[Edgar Villchur]] and [[Henry Kloss]] improved bass frequency response.

In the 1950s, audio manufacturers employed the phrase ''high fidelity'' as a marketing term to describe records and equipment intended to provide faithful sound reproduction. While some consumers simply interpreted ''high fidelity'' as fancy and expensive equipment, many found the difference in quality between "hi-fi" and the then standard AM radios and 78 rpm records readily apparent and bought 33⅓ LPs such as [[RCA]]'s New Orthophonics and London's ffrr (Full Frequency Range Recording, a UK [[Decca Records|Decca]] system); and high-fidelity phonographs. Audiophiles paid attention to technical characteristics and bought individual components, such as separate turntables, radio tuners, [[preamplifier]]s, [[power amplifier]]s and loudspeakers. Some enthusiasts even assembled their own loudspeaker systems. In the 1950s, ''hi-fi'' became a generic term for home sound equipment, to some extent displacing ''phonograph'' and ''record player''.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the development of the [[Western Electric|Westrex]] single-groove [[stereophonic]] record cutterhead led to the next wave of home-audio improvement, and in common parlance ''stereo'' displaced ''hi-fi''. Records were now played on ''a stereo''. In the world of the audiophile, however, the concept of ''high fidelity'' continued to refer to the goal of highly accurate sound reproduction and to the technological resources available for approaching that goal. This period is regarded as the "Golden Age of Hi-Fi", when [[vacuum tube]] equipment manufacturers of the time produced many models considered endearing by modern audiophiles, and just before [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] ([[transistor]]ized) equipment was introduced to the market, subsequently replacing tube equipment as the mainstream technology.

A popular type of system for reproducing music beginning in the 1970s was the integrated [[music centre]]—which combined a phonograph turntable, AM-FM radio tuner, tape player, preamplifier, and power amplifier in one package, often sold with its own separate, detachable or integrated speakers. These systems advertised their simplicity. The consumer did not have to select and assemble individual components, or be familiar with impedance and power ratings. Purists generally avoid referring to these systems as high fidelity, though some are capable of very good quality sound reproduction. Audiophiles in the 1970s and 1980s preferred to buy each component separately. That way, they could choose models of each component with the specifications that they desired. In the 1980s, a number of audiophile magazines became available, offering reviews of components and articles on how to choose and test speakers, amplifiers and other components.

== Listening tests ==
Listening tests are used by hi-fi manufacturers, audiophile magazines and [[audio engineering]] researchers and scientists. If a listening test is done in such a way that the listener who is assessing the sound quality of a component or recording can see the components that are being used for the test (e.g., the same musical piece listened to through a tube power amplifier and a solid state amplifier), then it is possible that the listener's pre-existing biases towards or against certain components or brands could affect their judgment. To respond to this issue, researchers began to use [[Blind experiment|blind tests]], in which the researchers can see the components being tested, but the listeners undergoing the experiments can't. In a [[double-blind experiment]], neither the listeners nor the researchers know who belongs to the [[control group]] and the [[experimental group]], or which type of audio component is being used for which listening sample. Only after all the data has been recorded (and in some cases, analyzed) do the researchers learn which components or recordings were preferred by the listeners. A commonly used variant of this test is the [[ABX test]]. A subject is presented with two known samples (sample ''A'', the reference, and sample ''B'', an alternative), and one unknown sample ''X,'' for three samples total. ''X'' is randomly selected from ''A'' and ''B'', and the subject identifies ''X'' as being either ''A'' or ''B''. Although there is no way to prove that a certain methodology is [[Transparency (data compression)|transparent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Spanos, Aris|year=1999|title= Probability Theory and Statistical Inference |publisher= Cambridge University Press |page=699 |isbn= 0-521-42408-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; a properly conducted double-blind test can prove that a method is ''not'' transparent.

Scientific double-blind tests are sometimes used as part of attempts to ascertain whether certain audio components (such as expensive, exotic cables) have any subjectively perceivable effect on sound quality. Data gleaned from these double-blind tests is not accepted by some "audiophile" magazines such as ''[[Stereophile]]'' and ''[[The Absolute Sound]]'' in their evaluations of audio equipment. [[John Atkinson (music editor)|John Atkinson]], current editor of ''Stereophile'', stated (in a 2005 July editorial named ''Blind Tests &amp; Bus Stops'') that he once purchased a solid-state amplifier, the Quad 405, in 1978 after seeing the results from blind tests, but came to realize months later that "the magic was gone" until he replaced it with a tube amp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stereophile.com/asweseeit/705awsi |date=2005-07-17 |author=John Atkinson |title=Blind Tests &amp; Bus Stops}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Harley of ''The Absolute Sound'' wrote, in a 2008 editorial (on Issue 183), that: "...blind listening tests fundamentally distort the listening process and are worthless in determining the audibility of a certain phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avguide.com/forums/blind-listening-tests-are-flawed-editorial?page=2 |author=Robert Harley |title=Blind Listening Tests are Flawed: An Editorial |publisher=The Absolute Sound |date=2008-05-28 |accessdate=2011-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930084747/http://www.avguide.com/forums/blind-listening-tests-are-flawed-editorial?page=2 |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doug Schneider, editor of the online Soundstage network, refuted this position with two editorials in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodsound.com/editorial/200905.htm |author=Doug Schneider |title=The Misinformed Misleading the Uninformed – A Bit About Blind Listening Tests |publisher=GoodSound! |date=2009-05-01 |accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodsound.com/editorial/200906.htm |author=Doug Schneider |title=A Bit More About Blind Listening Tests (6/2009) |publisher=GoodSound! |date=2009-06-01 |accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He stated: "Blind tests are at the core of the decades' worth of research into loudspeaker design done at Canada's National Research Council (NRC). The NRC researchers knew that for their result to be credible within the scientific community and to have the most meaningful results, they had to eliminate bias, and blind testing was the only way to do so." Many Canadian companies such as Axiom, Energy, Mirage, Paradigm, PSB and Revel use blind testing extensively in designing their loudspeakers. Audio professional Dr. Sean Olive of Harman International shares this view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Sean Olive |url=http://seanolive.blogspot.com/2009/04/dishonesty-of-sighted-audio-product.html |title=The Dishonesty of Sighted Listening Tests |date=2009-04-09 |accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Semblance of realism ==
[[Stereophonic]] sound provided a partial solution to the problem of creating the [[auditory illusion|illusion]] of live orchestral performers by creating a phantom middle channel when the listener sits exactly in the middle of the two front loudspeakers. When the listener moves slightly to the side, however, this phantom channel disappears or is greatly reduced. An attempt to provide for the reproduction of the reverberation was tried in the 1970s through [[quadraphonic sound]] but, again, the technology at that time was insufficient for the task. Consumers did not want to pay the additional costs and space required for the marginal improvements in realism. With the rise in popularity of [[home cinema|home theater]], however, multi-channel playback systems became affordable, and many consumers were willing to tolerate the six to eight channels required in a home theater. The advances made in [[digital signal processor|signal processors]] to synthesize an approximation of a good concert hall can now provide a somewhat more realistic illusion of listening in a concert hall.

In addition to spatial realism, the playback of music must be subjectively free from noise, such as hiss or hum, to achieve realism. The [[compact disc]] (CD) provides about 90 [[decibel]]s of [[dynamic range]],&lt;ref name="Fries2005"&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital Audio Essentials |last=Fries |first=Bruce |author2=Marty Fries |year=2005 |publisher=O'Reilly Media |isbn=0-596-00856-2 |pages=144–147 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w0vsd5z2Rg4C&amp;pg=PA147 |quote=Digital audio at 16-bit resolution has a theoretical dynamic range of 96 dB, but the actual dynamic range is usually lower because of overhead from filters that are built into most audio systems." ...

== Modularity {{anchor|integrated|mini|lifestyle|midi}}==
[[File:HK AVR 245.jpg|thumb|Modular components made by [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]] and [[Harman Kardon]]]]
''Integrated'', ''mini'', or ''lifestyle'' systems (also known by the older terms ''[[music centre]]'' or ''midi system''&lt;ref name='argos_midi' /&gt;&lt;ref name='matsui_midi_47' /&gt;) contain one or more sources such as a [[Compact Disc player|CD player]], a [[tuner (radio)|tuner]], or a [[compact audio cassette|cassette]] deck together with a [[preamplifier]] and a [[power amplifier]] in one box. Although some [[High-end audio|high-end]] manufacturers do produce integrated systems, such products are generally disparaged by [[audiophile]]s, who prefer to build a system from ''separates'' (or ''components''), often with each item from a different manufacturer specialising in a particular component. This provides the most flexibility for piece-by-piece upgrades and repairs.

For slightly less flexibility in [[upgrade]]s, a [[preamplifier]] and a power [[amplifier]] in one box is called an ''[[integrated amplifier]]''; with a tuner, it is a ''[[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]''. A monophonic power amplifier, which is called a ''[[Amplifier|monoblock]]'', is often used for powering a [[subwoofer]]. Other modules in the system may include components like [[magnetic cartridge|cartridges]], [[tonearm]]s, hi-fi [[phonograph|turntable]]s, [[Digital Media Player]]s, [[digital audio player]]s, [[DVD]] players that play a wide variety of discs including [[CD]]s, [[CD recorder]]s, [[MiniDisc]] recorders, hi-fi [[videocassette recorder]]s (VCRs) and [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] [[tape recorder]]s. Signal modification equipment can include [[Equalization (audio)|equalizers]] and [[signal processor]]s.

This modularity allows the enthusiast to spend as little or as much as they want on a component that suits their specific needs. In a system built from separates, sometimes a failure on one component still allows partial use of the rest of the system. A repair of an integrated system, though, means complete lack of use of the system. Another advantage of modularity is the ability to spend money on only a few core components at first and then later add additional components to the system. Some of the disadvantages of this approach are increased cost, complexity, and space required for the components.

== Modern equipment ==
In the 2000s, modern hi-fi equipment can include signal sources such as [[digital audio tape]] (DAT), [[digital audio broadcasting]] (DAB) or [[HD Radio]] tuners. Some modern hi-fi equipment can be digitally connected using [[fibre optic]] [[TOSLINK]] cables, [[USB|universal serial bus]] (USB) ports (including one to play digital audio files), or [[Wi-Fi]] support. Another modern component is the ''music server'' consisting of one or more [[computer]] [[hard disk|hard drives]] that hold music in the form of [[computer file]]s. When the music is stored in an [[audio file format]] that is [[lossless]] such as [[FLAC]], [[Monkey's Audio]] or [[WMA Lossless]], the computer playback of recorded audio can serve as an audiophile-quality source for a hi-fi system.

'''Hospitality Technology Next Generation''', formerly Hotel Technology Next Generation, commonly referred to as HTNG, is a global, non-profit trade association serving hotel companies and technology providers.  It was founded in 2002 and is governed by a board of directors consisting of senior technology executives from hotel companies.  Membership is open to companies and individuals involved with hospitality technology.

The organization's stated objective is to promote interoperability of the many technology systems used in the hotel industry, such as [[property management system]]s, [[Point of sale|point-of-sale systems]], telephone systems, [[building automation|building automation systems]], guestroom entertainment systems such as [[video on demand]], [[security systems|security]] and [[access control]] systems, and many others.  The organization's members meet regularly in small workgroups, where hotel companies and vendors work together to design interface standards (often using [[XML]]), reference architectures, network designs, and hospitality-specific network devices.  HTNG holds annual members' meetings in North America, Europe, and Asia.

HTNG operates a certification program for selected specifications, administered by [[The Open Group]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3765">The '''International Accreditation Forum, Inc. (IAF)''' is the world association of Conformity Assessment [[Accreditation]] bodies and other bodies interested in [[conformity assessment]] in the fields of management systems, products, services, personnel and other similar programs of conformity assessment. Its primary function is to develop a single worldwide program of conformity assessment which reduces risk for business and its customers by assuring them that accredited certificates may be relied upon. Accreditation assures users of the competence and impartiality of the body accredited.

IAF members accredit certification or registration bodies that issue certificates attesting that an organization's management, products or personnel comply with a specified standard (called conformity assessment).

IAF has prepared an informative [http://www.compad.com.au/cms/iaf/workstation/upFiles/292851.IAF__Screen-ready_2009-02_Rev.pdf brochure] which provides general information about IAF, its activities, membership and programs.

==Role of the IAF==

The primary purpose of IAF is two-fold. Firstly, to ensure that its accreditation body members only accredit bodies that are competent to do the work they undertake and are not subject to conflicts of interest. The second purpose of the IAF is to establish mutual recognition arrangements, known as [[Multilateral Recognition Arrangement]]s (MLA), between its accreditation body members which reduces risk to business and its customers by ensuring that an accredited certificate may be relied upon anywhere in the world. The MLA contributes to the freedom of world trade by eliminating technical barriers to trade. IAF works to find the most effective way of achieving a single system that will allow companies with an accredited conformity assessment certificate in one part of the world, to have that certificate recognized else where in the world. The objective of the MLA is that it will cover all accreditation bodies in all countries in the world, thus eliminating the need for suppliers of products or services to be certified in each country where they sell their products or services.

==Structure of the IAF==

The highest level of authority in IAF is the Members in a General Meeting. General
Meetings make decisions and lay down policy in the name of the members. The Board
is responsible for legal actions to be carried out on behalf of the members, for
developing broad policy directions for IAF and for ensuring that the day-to-day work of
IAF is carried out in accordance with policies approved by members.
The terms of reference, tasks and duties as defined by the Bylaws and the
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) remain unchanged for the members at a
General Meeting, the Board of Directors and the Secretary.
The Executive Committee is responsible to the Board of Directors for the day-to-day
work of IAF on the basis of decisions made by the Members and directions by the Board
of Directors.
The operations of all IAF Committees and Subordinate Groups, including the Executive
Committee, are subject to the IAF General Procedures

==Membership==
Membership of the IAF consists of Accreditation Bodies (which accredit Certification Bodies, which certify or register conforming organisations).  An [https://www.iaf.nu/articles/IAF_Members_&amp;_Signatories/4 official list] is available online.

Members recognise other members as ''equivalent'', through accession to the Multilateral Recognition Agreements.  These attest that Certificates traced to one member is equivalent to that of another.

'''LabelTag''' can create a circular label on the data side of any [[DVD+R]] or [[DVD-R]] disc containing basic information visible to the eye. When burning the data, the label is printed directly behind that data in the same recording session, and on normal recording speed on the same recording layer side. LabelTag works on any disc and does not require a special disc like LightScribe. Currently, LabelTag is an exclusive technology of Lite-On for its DVD writer drives.

An older alternative disc labeling technique was [[DiscT@2]]. To record the label on the opposite or back side of the disc by the drive itself [[LightScribe]] and [[LabelFlash]] are current standards. Besides that, printing using an inkjet printer is currently widely used.

== System description ==
In the image below an overview is presented of the system-functions of LabelTag. The PC host application controls the data location of the regular user data, including the structure of the file system. In the host application the user label input is transformed into a bit-map representation. The host sends print commands with the pixel information of the image to the drive. The drive interface, records the regular data, including lead in, session intros and closures, and finally lead out. The drive Interface (IF) part takes care of the interpretation of the pixel information and location of the image on the disc. The drive Servo part finally records the pixel information on the correct location including the encoded line numbering. The drive Servo part controls the record power, motor frequency, pixel frequency and channel bit frequency.

=== Location and time of image recording ===
The label can be added or appended to the disc at any time if disc space is available. The disc status has to be “appendable” prior to the image recording. The label is recorded adjacent to the last recorded user data. It is up to the user to finalize the disc after the label is added. In case the disc remains "appendable" more user data or more labels can be added. The first section of the disc (26&amp;nbsp;mm) is used for all drives to do the start-up calibrations. Therefore, no label can be recorded at the inner diameter of the disc. If there is a label in this area, the risk of poor performance is big.

=== Space usage ===
If you add a label on the data side of the disc, then this space is no longer available for data. The amount of space it takes depends on the size (width) of the label and the location of the label on the disc. The wider the label and the more it is located on the outside of the disc, the more space it takes. In other words: the bigger the label, the more disc surface is occupied and thus the more data-space you sacrifice. For example: a 5&amp;nbsp;mm label at the inside requires 10% capacity, and at the outside of the disc about 20% of the disc capacity.

=== Image visibility and recording process ===
For LabelTag the [[Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation]] (EFM+) channel code properties are modulated to create the visual label. In the EFM+ code table, the user data bytes are transformed into specific sequences of pits and lands, ranging from 3T up to 14T channel bits. To create a pit, a high power pulse from the laser is focused into a small spot on the dye layer. This heats the dye material such that an irreversible transformation of the dye material creates the pit. To create a land, the laser is turned to a low power, such that no transformation in the dye material occurs. In general for DVD+/-R media, the recorded marks have a different visual reflection. Therefore, by recording long sequences of reflective marks or reflective spaces one can create the visible label. To maintain maximum backwards compatibility, LabelTag uses a majority of long marks in the recording layer for a dark pixel, while the bright image pixels are created by a majority of long spaces in the recording layer. Only in that case a sufficient large Differential Phase Detection (DPD) tracking signal is generated. This DPD signal is required for DVD players to jump over the Label area to reach beyond the label appended user data. 

[[Image:LABELTAG eyepatterns 2.jpg|thumb|center|800px|Scope traces of eyepatterns on DVD+R user data EFM+ (left), BRIGHT pattern (middle), DARK pattern (right).]]

During the recording the normal servo processes are used. The beam follows the tracks (grooves). The spot is in focus on the recording layer. Each image line is recorded by repeating the same recording pattern several tracks. In case of DVD with a track pitch of 740&amp;nbsp;nm, a 100μm image line width is obtained by repeating the pattern 132 consecutive tracks. Because every label pixel is constructed by 132 consecutive tracks, higher image sharpness and contrast is obtained compared to [[DiscT@2]].
Each visible pixel is about 40μm × 100μm (w × l) at the inner radius up to 100μm × 100μm (w × l) at the outer radius. This leads to a picture quality above 250DPI. 

As the label and the user data are recorded in the same dye layer of the DVD+/-R media, and label pattern uses run-lengths within the EFM+ range, the same (castle) write pulse form is used as for the regular user data recordings. To enhance the contrast a higher recording power is optional.

=== Backwards compatibility and logical format ===
After the visual tag is written to the disc, this disc remains accessible, readable and appendable for any legacy drives. For that, the label is recorded within the user data zone of the disc in its own Image Session. Then any regular DVD drive capable to read multi session DVDs is able to access the user data zone beyond the label. Very old DVD drives, supporting only single session DVD, might only retrieve data stored in the first session.

Access of the LabelTag area itself is prevented by two protection mechanisms:
*At File system level, [[ISO 9660]] or [[Universal Disk Format]] (UDF), no file pointers to the label area are present.
*At Physical Format Level, both the Inner Drive Area and &amp; Lead-in area Session pointers (TOC or RMD) and the Session Control Data Information in the Intro or Border-in skip the Visual Image Window by pointing to the actual end of the Image Session Data Zone or RZone.

Besides, directly around the label a buffer zone is present that enhances the seek performance for the adjacent user data zones. Finally, a sufficient DPD tracking signal is required at the image location. For that reason, the bright and dark pixels are created by recording marks and spaces within the EFM+-runlength range.

[[Image:LabelTag session format.jpg|thumb|center|800px|File System and Physical Format pointers for the LabelTag Image session.]]

=== Multiple labels and data sessions ===
The LabelTag format is flexible. It allows as many labels on a disc as space is available. A multisession discs allows burning more data and labels at a later stage. Once the disc is finalized, no more data or labels can be added. But, the more labels you add, the less space you have left for data.

[[Image:Multi session explained further2.jpg|thumb|center|500px|Multi session and tagging explained.]]

== LabelTag application ==
To record a label on the disc, the application has to send the pixel information with a [[SCSI command]] to the drive. 

The application is responsible for:
*Generates pixels based on User Input.
*Defines the LabelTag properties, like size and location.
*Sends the LabelTag pixel information to the drive, using an SCSI-command sequence.
*Sends the FS-Zone1 and FS-Zone2 data containing imported pointers to the location of the root directory as recorded in the last active Primary Volume Descriptor
*Closes the Label by creating the Image Session Structures in the Lead-in TOC/RMD and recording the Closure/Border out.

=== WRITE12 SCSI commands ===
For LabelTag no new commands are introduced; the changes are made to the already existing commands. Pixel data describing the pixels for one or more image lines is sent to the drive via the WRITE12 [[SCSI Write Commands]]. The line width and number of pixels in each line are set in the LabelTag [[SCSI mode pages]]. The &lt;code&gt;WRITE12&lt;/code&gt; command is called &lt;code&gt;TAGWRITE&lt;/code&gt; command to emphasize the dedicated LabelTag [[SCSI mode pages]] settings. After this command the image data is located in the drive buffer. The drive starts writing after the buffer is full or a &lt;code&gt;SYNCHRONIZE CACHE&lt;/code&gt; command is sent.

[[Image:TagWrite Command2.jpg|thumb|center|500px|TAGWRITE command]]
[[Image:TAGWRITE DATA FORMAT2.jpg|thumb|center|500px|Specification of the TagWrite data format]]

=== Image data format ===
The image data is formatted by the application as bitmap into bright pixels and dark pixels. The bright pixel corresponds to bitmap 0 and the dark pixel to bitmap 1. Therefore, LabelTag allows both text and logos to be printed.

In the LabelTag mode page the following properties are exchanged:
*The number of lines n.

=== Process-flow ===
The application confirms if the drive is capable of making visual images using the LabelTag technology by sending the GETCONFIGURATION command. In case the LabelTag feature is current, a supported disc with an appendable session is inserted into the drive. The printing of the Label can begin. 

First the FS-Zone1 data is recorded on the next writable address. To write the image following the FS-Zone1, the mode bit is set in the LabelTag mode page. The drive is now in LabelTag mode. The data in TAGWRITE commands contains the Label pixel data. The label starts on the Next Writable Address of the inserted disc. The application sends a SYNCHRONIZE CACHE to the drive to let the drive start the image burning. The application unsets the mode bit in the LabelTag mode page to let the drive go back in data write mode. Before the drive can add the FS-Zone2, the application has to inquire the Next Writable Address from the drive to know where the end address is of the Image Window. The application finishes the LabelTag writing by closing the Image Session.

'''Latigent LLC''' was an international provider of [[Business Intelligence]], Enterprise RSS, and [[Call Center]] Reporting and Analytics software.

==History==
Latigent, LLC of [[Chicago, IL]], was founded in 2002, as a privately held and funded company, by Chris Crosby and Jason Kolb, two veterans of the contact center industry.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Both founders believed that there was a more efficient way of using the information typically gathered in the contact center to better serve the customer and more profitably serve the enterprise.  As a result, the Latigent BlueVue performance management product was born and introduced to the market in 2003.

In December 2005, Latigent released BlueVue II, a Business Information (BI) suite.  Besides reporting functionality and complete data warehousing capabilities, BlueVue II also offered data integration capabilities for performance management.

On September 27, 2007 [[Cisco Systems]] announced a definitive agreement to acquire Latigent LLC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2007/corp_092707.html Announced A Definitive Agreement to Acquire Latigent LLC]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Leyland L60''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] {{convert|19|litre|cuin|sigfig=2}} vertical six-cylinder [[Opposed-piston engine|opposed-piston]] [[Two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] diesel engine designed by [[Leyland Motors|Leyland Motors Ltd]] in the late 1950's/early 1960's for the [[Chieftain (tank)|Chieftain]] [[Main Battle Tank]] (MBT). The engine was also used in the [[Vickers MBT]] and [[Vijayanta]].

==Origin==
The initial engine choice for the FV4201, the vehicle that would later bear the name 'Chieftain',{{efn-lr|FV4202 was the vehicle built in early 1956 based on Centurion components used to test the reclining driver's position intended for FV4201. It was also referred to as the '40-ton Centurion'.}} had in 1954 been a [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] diesel V8, however during the Chieftain's design phase [[NATO]] changed to requiring a [[multifuel|multi-fuel]] capability in 1957 making the intended Rolls-Royce engine unsuitable, and so a new engine with this capability was required.{{efn-lr|NATO later rescinded this requirement. As events turned out, in service the L60 was only ever run on [[diesel fuel|DERV]] (diesel) fuel.}} 

Leyland Motors, under the direction of the [[Military Vehicles and Engineering Establishment|Fighting Vehicles Research and Development Establishment]] (FVRDE) at [[Chertsey]], was asked to develop such an engine as an opposed-piston two-stroke diesel{{efn-lr|The aircraft diesel engine had been developed in the 1920s–1930s because its fuel economy, and hence the possible aircraft range and endurance, were superior to contemporary petrol engines. This was especially useful for maritime reconnaissance, where the four-stroke diesel's poorer power-to-weight ratio was of less importance than in other applications. To offset this reduction in power-to-weight however, Junkers engines had used the two-stroke cycle, which gave more power for the same displacement than a four-stroke cycle. Rolls-Royce had also used the two-stroke cycle in the wartime petrol-fuelled [[Rolls-Royce Crecy|Crecy]], as had Napier with the post-war diesel [[Napier Nomad|Nomad]].}} of similar design to those previously produced by [[D. Napier &amp; Son|Napier]]{{efn-lr|The Napier company had earlier licensed some of [[Junkers#Junkers_Jumo|Junkers Motorenwerke]]'s (Jumo's) opposed-piston diesel aircraft engine designs such as the [[Junkers Jumo 205]].}} and [[Tilling-Stevens]], the latter's [[Commer TS3]]{{efn-lr|By this time [[Tilling-Stevens]] had been bought out by [[Rootes Group|Rootes]].}} engine being particularly highly regarded. 

This chosen configuration apart from being well-suited to multi-fuel use also had the advantages of being of simple design with a low parts count, had low [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing load]]s, and possessed good cold-starting characteristics. Some technical assistance was provided to Leyland by Rolls-Royce, who by that time had taken over the Napier company.{{efn-lr|The intended estimated design weight for FV4201, previously "Medium Gun Tank No.2", was at this time 47&amp;nbsp;tons. Medium Gun Tank No.1 had been the [[Conqueror (tank)#Design and development|FV221 Carnarvon]].}} Both Tilling-Stevens and Leyland produced single-cylinder prototype engines for the tank engine project and by 1959 the resulting complete engine design had become the Leyland 60, or L60, with the first engine running that same year.{{efn-lr|Rolls-Royce would use the opposed-piston two-stroke design in its [[K60 engine]], used in the [[FV430 series|FV430]] series of vehicles.}}

==Overview==
One of the reasons the L60's unusual configuration was chosen was so as to obtain as compact a power plant as possible so allowing the height of the vehicle to be kept as low as was practicable, a requirement for the Chieftain's design philosophy.{{efn-lr|The Chieftain incorporated a recumbent (lying on the back rather than sitting) driver's position for just this reason.}} 

The use of the two-stroke cycle allowed for a greater [[Power-to-weight ratio|power for a given displacement]], the 19 litres of the projected diesel engine being expected to be capable of around the same power as the previous, larger displacement, 27 litre, 600 hp [[Rolls-Royce Meteor|Rover Meteor]] petrol engine,{{efn-lr|Design target for the L60 was actually 600 hp for initial engines, 700 hp with development, the latter programme being carried out under the [[code name]] "Fleetfoot".}} whilst taking up less room in the engine compartment.{{efn-lr|The use of the two-stroke cycle was to be responsible for the Chieftain's distinctive exhaust sound, as well as its clouds of exhaust smoke.}} [[Scavenging (automotive)|Scavenging]] was performed by a [[Roots-type supercharger|Roots blower]].

==Maintenance==
The Chieftain's L60 engine and cooling system were designed into an integrated [[powerpack (drivetrain)|engine-pack]] which could be changed in-the-field using the crane of an [[FV434]] Armoured Repair Vehicle, which had been designed for this purpose,{{efn-lr|The FV434 fitter's vehicle had been expressly designed for changing Chieftain power-packs, but would also be used for doing the same for the FV432-series of vehicles.}} and a complete engine change took around one-and-a-half, to 2 hours. 

The requirement for an easily changeable engine pack was the result of a [[British Army]] analysis of previous tank battles that concluded that the longest likely future tank battle would last no longer than two hours, and so the most demanding requirement expected for any tank engine during wartime would be for it to be run at full power for this total amount of time only,{{efn-lr|British experience in North Africa during World War II with the [[Cruiser Mk I|A9]], [[Cruiser Mk II|A10]], [[Cruiser Mk IV|A13]] and [[Crusader tank|Crusader]] tanks had led to the need for them to be operated "flat-out" for much of the time when in action. This resulted in accelerated engine wear and a further decrease in vehicle reliability.}} and so it would then be advantageous for it to be removed from the vehicle after the battle and exchanged for another, fresh engine, all within a minimum of time.{{efn-lr|Changing an engine on the earlier [[Centurion (tank)|Centurion]] took around twelve hours and was a complicated procedure necessitating much removal of engine ancillary equipment.}} 

This practice would also allow the engines to be worked-on in properly-equipped [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers|REME]] workshops rather than 'in the field', the engines being exchanged between vehicles and workshops as-and-when required.{{efn-lr|The context here is a battlefield possibly contaminated by nuclear, biological, or chemical (NBC) weapons, and with personnel not protected by being inside vehicles having to wear [[NBC suit|protective clothing]] at all times. In these conditions, any involved or radical work outside, on an engine or other system, is simply not possible.}} This philosophy was also applied to the contemporary [[FV430 series|FV430]] series of vehicles.

==Performance==
The initial production L60 units were, at 585&amp;nbsp;bhp at 2,100&amp;nbsp;rpm, down on the designed initial power of 600&amp;nbsp;bhp,{{efn-lr|Initial production engines were intended to be of 600&amp;nbsp;bhp, with power being increased, with subsequent development, on later engines to 700&amp;nbsp;bhp.}} and were plagued with reliability problems{{efn-lr|These problems were exacerbated by inadequate spares stocks and an insufficient spare engine 'float'.  Although of considerable inconvenience to the users, the L60 reliability problem would have been far worse had it not been for the removable engine pack, which at least usually allowed a vehicle to be operational again with a replacement engine within a couple of hours of breaking down. REME fitters were to become well-versed in the procedure.}} such as burnt pistons and internal coolant leaks in to the cylinders,{{efn-lr|A persistent source of trouble was the failure of the cylinder liner sealing resulting in coolant leakage into the cylinder bore.}} and fan drive belts overstressing fan bearing housings, however reliability was to improve over time with modifications and improvement programmes, such as the "Sundance" programme,{{efn-lr|"Exercise Sundance" was carried out in five main phases between 1976 and 1979. These, in themselves, had been preceded by "Dark Morn", "High Noon", and the initial "Fleetfoot" engine development programme, the person responsible for the choosing of [[code names]] apparently being an admirer of the [[Western film|"Western"]] film.}} which also included increased engine power.{{efn-lr|The "Sundance" programme was to result in parliamentary questions in the [[House of Commons]] in 1978. The programme's result was the final rectification of most of the L60's previous reliability and power problems, resulting in a subsequent rise in vehicle availability levels to 80%. In the [[Gulf War|First Gulf War]] of 1990 Chieftain AARV and CHAVRE availability levels exceeded those of the [[Challenger 1]].&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite book
  |title=The Chieftain Tank Engine
  |publisher=[[HMSO]]  |location=London
  |year=1978
  |isbn=010248578X
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn-lr|The increased reliability that "Sundance" provided however allowed other problems to emerge that had not made themselves felt before, such as the draining of oil from the upper-crankshaft bearings when the engine stood for long periods, requiring the operators to crank the engine for 20 seconds before starting from cold, and rectification measures such as fitting non-return valves to prevent the oil draining back to the sump were only partially successful.}}

Final production engines were of 750&amp;nbsp;bhp.{{efn-lr|Subsequently, engines in service underwent modification to greater powers under the various improvement programmes.}}

Initially, due to unfamiliarity with the two-stroke engine's different exhaust note and [[power band]] compared to a four-stroke engine, and with the resulting difficulty in choosing the correct gear required for the particular driving task, trainee drivers tended to under-rev the engines and use inappropriate gear selections, leading to great difficulty climbing gradients, and when the Chieftain Mk 1 was first introduced some drivers had difficulty climbing the vehicle onto the trailers of [[Thornycroft Antar]] tank transporters.

In 1975 all British Chieftains were brought up to Chieftain Mark 5 standard as part of the "Totem Pole" programme which included the fitting of all vehicles with the 750 bhp L60 '''Mark 8A'''.{{efn-lr|On undergoing "Totem Pole" upgrades Chieftain Mk 2 vehicles were re-designated the Mark 6. Mk 3 vehicles became the Mk 7, and Mk 3/3 vehicles became the Mk 8.}}

==Transmission==
The engine was mated with a [[David Brown Ltd.|Merritt-Brown TN12]]{{efn-lr|Originally designed by [[Self-Changing Gears]] and produced by David Brown Ltd, the gearbox used a steering system devised in 1935 by Dr. Henry E. Merritt, then-Director of Tank Design at [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich Arsenal]]. It would later be copied and used in modified form in the German [[Tiger I]] tank. Merritt wrote a number of authoritative books on the subject of transmissions, e.g., "Gears" (1947), and "Gear Engineering" (1971), and would also contribute to the field of [[Norbar Torque|torque wrench]] design. He was to become Chief Designer at David Brown Ltd, and was to also work for [[Vickers]], and [[Nuffield Organization|Nuffield]], as well as becoming Chief Research Officer for the [[British Transport Commission]].}} triple-differential [[epicyclic gearbox]] providing "regenerative" steering, a derivative of the system first used on the [[Churchill tank]]. The gearbox was semi-automatic foot-operated and had six forward, and two reverse gears. Like the engine, it was designed to be quickly replaceable. The TN12 had originally been developed for the cancelled [[FV300 Series|FV300 light tank series]].{{efn-lr|When installed in the early Chieftains with L60s of around 600&amp;nbsp;bhp the initial TN12 gearbox design suffered from overheating and proved insufficiently robust, having been designed for a vehicle of lower weight and power, a problem which would have been uncovered and rectified sooner had it not been for Leyland's inability to supply pre-production engines of sufficient power for early testing with the gearbox, some of the first L60's built being of only around 485 hp, a figure within the TN12's original design power rating. The overheating was cured by increasing the oil flow and fitting a heat exchanger, while the gearbox itself was redesigned to make it stronger, the resulting increase in gearbox size making it necessary to relocate the previously internal engine bay [[muffler|engine silencer]]s to an armoured external box at the rear of the hull.}}

In [[library science]] and architecture, a '''stack''' or '''bookstack''' (often referred to as a library building's ''stacks'') is a book storage area, as opposed to a reading area.  More specifically, this term refers to a narrow-aisled, multilevel system of iron or steel shelving that evolved in the nineteenth century to meet increasing demands for storage space.&lt;ref name="petroski"&gt;{{cite book|last=Petroski|first=Henry|title=The Book on the Book Shelf|year=1999|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|pages=167–168, 170–172, 184, 191}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An "open-stack" library allows its patrons to enter the stacks to browse for themselves; "closed stacks" means library staff retrieve books for patrons on request.

==Early development==
French architect [[Henri Labrouste]], shortly after making pioneering use of iron in the [[Bibliotheque Sainte-Genevieve]] of 1850, created a four story iron stack for the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].&lt;ref name="ELH"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wiegand|first=Wayne, ed.|title=Encyclopedia of Library History|year=1994|publisher=Garland|pages=352–355}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1857, multilevel stacks with grated iron floors were installed in the [[British Library]].&lt;ref name="petroski" /&gt;  In 1876, William R. Ware designed a stack for [[Gore Hall]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="snead 11" /&gt;  In contrast to the structural relationship found in most buildings, the floors of these bookstacks did not support the shelving, but rather the reverse, the floors being attached to, and supported by, the shelving framework.  Even the load of the building's roof, and of any non-shelving spaces above the stacks (such as offices), may be transmitted to the building's foundation through the shelving system itself. The building's external walls act as an envelope but provide no significant structural support.&lt;ref name="ELH" /&gt;

==Library of Congress and the Snead system==
For the [[Thomas Jefferson Building]] of the [[Library of Congress]], completed in 1897, [[Bernard Richardson Green]] made a number of alterations to the Gore Hall design, including the use of all-metal shelving. The contract was won by the Snead and Company Ironworks, which went on to install its standardized design in libraries around the country.&lt;ref name="snead 11" /&gt; Notable examples include the [[Widener Library]] at Harvard and the seven level stack supporting the Rose Reading Room of the New York Public Library.&lt;ref name="petroski" /&gt;

The Library of Congress bookstacks were designed and patented by Bernard R. Green (1843-1914), the engineer in charge of the Library of Congress construction, where this type of book storage was first used. Although the structure was of cast iron, the shelves were made from strips of thin U section steel, designed to be as light as an equivalent pine shelf. The top surface of the U section was ground, polished and 'lacquered' (the constituents of the lacquer are not known). Green designed the stacks to be modular, able to be erected several stories high as a single freestanding structural entity incorporating staircases and floors, and even capable of supporting a roof structure. He designed the shelves so that they could adjust to book sizes using a simple lug system without the need for any bolts or fixings. Although the bookstacks were decorated and very simply embellished, they are of machine-age industrial design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.salvoweb.com/salvonews/item-snead-cast-iron-bookstack-features-at-hindmans-chicago-sale_23258 |title=Snead cast iron bookstack features at Hindman's Chicago sale |website=salvoweb.com |date= |accessdate=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stacks were typically envisioned for access by library staff fetching books for patrons waiting elsewhere, and so were often built in ways making them unsuitable for public access.  Increasing concern with opening stacks to the public,&lt;ref name="ELH" /&gt; the desire to construct buildings adaptable to changing uses,&lt;ref name="petroski" /&gt; and concerns over the feasibility of storing truly comprehensive collections of books contributed to the decline of the Snead stack. [[Angus Snead Macdonald]], president of the Snead Company from 1915 to 1952, himself advocated for the transition to modular, open plan libraries in the mid twentieth century.&lt;ref name="ELH" /&gt;

==Forms==
For closed stacks, [[mobile shelving]] may be used to minimize floor space.  With computerized indexing, filing by book size saves up to 40% space as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Quito|first1=Anne|title=The New York Public Library has adopted a very unusual sorting system|url=http://qz.com/802744/the-legendary-new-york-public-library-shelves-books-in-its-underground-stacks-by-size-not-subject/|accessdate=13 October 2016|work=[[Quartz (publication)]]|publisher=[[Atlantic Media]]|date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{primarysources|date=July 2008}}

'''MiWi''' and '''MiWi P2P''' are [[proprietary protocol|proprietary]] wireless protocols designed by [[Microchip Technology]] that use small, low-power digital radios based on the [[IEEE 802.15.4]] standard for [[Wireless PAN|wireless personal area networks]] (WPANs). It is designed for low data transmission rates and short distance, cost constrained networks, such as industrial monitoring and control, home and building automation, remote control, low-power wireless sensors, lighting control and automated meter reading.

The MiWi protocols are supported on certain Microchip [[PIC microcontroller|PIC]] and [[PIC_microcontroller#PIC24 and dsPIC 16-bit microcontrollers|dsPIC]] [[microcontroller]]s. When developing for these platforms, proprietary [[Software development kit|SDK]]s and hardware development tools, such as the [[#Hardware|ZENA]] wireless packet sniffer, may be used.

==Protocols==
Microchip has released two application notes which present technical information on MiWi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=1824&amp;appnote=en520606 AN1066] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603054355/http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=1824&amp;appnote=en520606 |date=2007-06-03 }} MiWi Wireless Networking Protocol Stack, describing the Microchip MiWi stack&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=1824&amp;appnote=en536181 AN1204] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215104338/http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=1824&amp;appnote=en536181 |date=2013-02-15 }} Microchip MiWi P2P Wireless Protocol, focusing on MiWi P2P&lt;/ref&gt; These are not primarily protocol specifications and more than half of these documents are focused on implementing the MiWi protocol on Microchip microcontrollers.

As of 2009, interoperable third party implementations have not appeared. Unless they do, it will not be clear if those specifications are complete or accurate enough to serve roles other than supporting Microchip's code or being one more proprietary example of a lightweight WPAN stack. Many developers trying to use WPAN technologies have observed that [[Zigbee]] seems undesirably complex.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Accordingly, there exists a technical niche for a simpler protocols, of which MiWi is a proprietary example.

==Software==
On the PIC platform, the MiWi protocol stacks are small foot-print alternatives (3K-17K) to [[ZigBee]] (40K-100K), which makes them useful for cost-sensitive applications with limited memory. Although the MiWi software can all be downloaded for free from its official website, there exists a unique restriction and obligation to use it only with Microchip microcontrollers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=2113&amp;param=en520414 Microchip ZigBee Protocol Connectivity Solutions]&lt;/ref&gt;
  	  	
The MiWi P2P protocol stack supports [[Star network|star]] and [[peer-to-peer]] wireless-network topologies, useful for simple, short-range, wireless node-to-node communication. Additionally, the stack provides sleeping-node, active-scan and energy-detect features while supporting the low-power requirements of battery-operated devices.

==Hardware==
===MiWi Module===
[[File:Miwi module mchp.png|thumb|MiWi module produced by [[Microchip Technology]] beside a 1 cent coin.]]
In 2008, Microchip released a 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz wireless transceiver module that is compatible with certain Microchip PIC and dsPIC microcontrollers (the Microchip MRF24J40MB), and can be used in production devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=2664&amp;param=en535767 Microchip MRF24J40MA 2.4GHz IEEE 802.15.4 Transceiver Module]&lt;/ref&gt; Being ZigBee compliant, and capable of communicating using MiWi wireless protocols, it is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 Wireless PAN standard. Designed only for low-data rates and being low-cost, it has an integrated [[Antenna (radio)|PCB antenna]]. The module is regulatory-agency certified for the USA ([[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC)), Canada ([[Industry Canada]]) and Europe ([[ETSI]]), eliminating the need to receive independent FCC certification for their wireless products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electronicstalk.com/news/ari/ari279.html Ready-certified transceiver eases radio design] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20081028143538/http://www.electronicstalk.com/news/ari/ari279.html |date=2008-10-28 }} Electronicstalk&lt;/ref&gt;

===Network Analyzer===
The Microchip '''ZENA''' (or formerly, '''Z'''igbee '''E'''nhanced '''N'''etwork '''A'''nalyzer) is a wireless packet sniffer and network analyzer following the IEEE 802.15.4 specification on the 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz band. The ZENA analyzer supports both the ZigBee and MiWi protocols. Accompanying software can analyze network traffic and graphically display decoded packets. It can also display the network topology and the messages as they flow through the network. With the provided key of the network, data on encrypted MiWi networks can be sniffed and viewed as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=1406&amp;dDocName=en520682 Microchip ZENA wireless network analyzer]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation''' is, since 2008, the [[Russia]]n federal ministry responsible for energy policy.

This ministry was created in May 2008 as part of a reorganization by the incoming government of [[President of Russia|President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]]. It is headquartered in [[Moscow]]. The former Ministry of Industry and Energy was turned into the [[Ministry of Industry (Russia)|Ministry of Industry]], whose present Minister is [[Viktor Khristenko]], gaining responsibility for trade policy from the former Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, but losing responsibility for energy policy, which was split off into the new Ministry of Energy. The former Federal Agency for Energy ([[Rosenergo]]) was also merged into the new Ministry of Energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Restructuring without Repopulating | work = [[Kommersant]] | date = 13 May 2008 | url = http://commersant.com/p891024/r_1/Prime_Minister_Vladimir_Putin_government/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''N''-slit interferometer''' is an extension of the [[double-slit experiment|double-slit interferometer]] also known as Young's double-slit interferometer. One of the first known uses of ''N''-slit arrays in optics was illustrated by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]].&lt;ref&gt;I. Newton, ''[[Opticks]]'' (Royal Society, London, 1704).&lt;/ref&gt; In the first part of last century, [[Albert Abraham Michelson|Michelson]]&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Michelson, ''Studies in Optics'' (Chicago University, Chicago, 1927).&lt;/ref&gt; described various cases of ''N''-slit diffraction.

[[Richard Feynman|Feynman]]&lt;ref&gt;R. P. Feynman, R. B. Leighton, and M. Sands, ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'', Vol. III (Addison Wesley, Reading, 1965).&lt;/ref&gt; described [[thought experiment]]s, of two-slit quantum interference, of electrons using [[Braket notation|Dirac's notation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Dirac|P. A. M. Dirac]], ''The Principles of Quantum Mechanics'', 4th Ed. (Oxford, London, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;   This approach was extended to ''N''-slit interferometers, by [[F. J. Duarte|Duarte]] and colleagues in 1989,&lt;ref name="FJD1989"&gt;[[F. J. Duarte]] and D. J. Paine, Quantum mechanical description of ''N''-slit interference phenomena, in ''Proceedings of the International Conference on Lasers '88'', R. C. Sze and 
F. J. Duarte (Eds.) (STS, McLean, Va, 1989) pp. 42–47.&lt;/ref&gt; using narrow-linewidth laser illumination, that is, illumination by indistinguishable photons.  The first application of the ''N''-slit interferometer was the generation and measurement of complex interference patterns.&lt;ref name="FJD1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OC1993"&gt;F. J. Duarte, On a generalized interference equation and interferometric measurements, ''Opt. Commun.'' '''103''', 8-14 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  These interferograms are accurately reproduced, or predicted, by the [[N-slit interferometric equation|''N''-slit interferometric equation]] for either even (''N'' = 2, 4, 6,…), or odd (''N'' = 3, 5, 7,…), numbers of slits.&lt;ref name="OC1993"/&gt;

==''N''-slit laser interferometer==
[[File:FJ DUARTE-N SLIT INTERFEROMETER.jpg|600px|thumb|right|Top view schematics of the N-slit interferometer: TBE is a telescopic beam expander, MPBE is a multiple-prism beam expander.  The N-slit array is at ''j'' (with the slits perpendicular to the beam expansion) and the interferometric plane is at ''x'' where the digital detector is positioned.&lt;ref name="OC1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name=JOA/&gt;&lt;ref name=JOPT2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name = JOPT2011 /&gt;  The intra interferometric distance ''D'' has been reported to be as large as 527 m.  '''Note''': ''N''-slit interferometers include three-slit interferometers (or triple-slit interferometers), four-slit interferometers, etc.&lt;ref name=JOA/&gt;&lt;ref name=JOPT2010 /&gt;]]
The ''N''-slit laser interferometer, introduced by [[F. J. Duarte|Duarte]],&lt;ref name="FJD1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OC1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US1993"&gt;[http://www.patentgenius.com/patent/5255069.html F. J. Duarte, Electro-optical interferometric microdensitometer system, ''US Patent'' 5255069 (1993)].&lt;/ref&gt; uses prismatic [[Beam expander|beam expansion]] to illuminate a transmission grating, or ''N''-slit array, and a photoelectric detector array (such as a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] or [[Active pixel sensor|CMOS]]) at the interference plane to register the interferometric signal.&lt;ref name="OC1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HPDL"&gt;F. J. Duarte, in ''High Power Dye Lasers'' (Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1991) Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  The expanded laser beam illuminating the ''N''-slit array is single-transverse-mode and narrow-linewidth.  This beam can also take the shape, via the introduction of a convex lens prior to the prismatic expander, of a beam extremely elongated in the propagation plane and extremely thin in the orthogonal plane.&lt;ref name="OC1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US1993"/&gt;   This use of one-dimensional (or line) illumination eliminates the need of point-by-point scanning in microscopy and microdensitometry.&lt;ref name="OC1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US1993"/&gt;  Thus, these instruments can be used as straight forward ''N''-slit interferometers or as interferometric microscopes (see section on microscopy).

The disclosure of this interferometric configuration introduced the use of digital detectors to ''N''-slit interferometry.&lt;ref name="FJD1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HPDL" /&gt;

==Applications==

===Secure optical communications===
[[File:FJDUARTE-LASERS-JOPT13-035710(2011).jpg|150px|thumb|right|Interferogram for ''N'' = 3 slits with diffraction pattern superimposed on the right outer wing.  This particular interferogram corresponds to the ''interferometric character'' "b".&lt;ref name = JOPT2011 /&gt;]]  
[[File:Araneus diadematus underside 2.jpg|150px|thumb|right|The diffraction pattern over the interferogram shown above, corresponding to ''N'' = 3 slits, was generated using a single [[spider silk]] fiber with a diameter of about 25 μm.&lt;ref name = JOPT2011 /&gt;]] 
These interferometers, originally introduced for applications in imaging,&lt;ref name="OC1993"/&gt; are also useful in optical metrology and have been proposed for [[Laser communication in space|secure optical communications in free space]],&lt;ref name=JOA&gt;F. J. Duarte, Secure interferometric communications in free space: enhanced sensitivity for propagation in the metre range, ''J. Opt. A: Pure Appl. Opt.'' '''7''', 73–75 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OC2002&gt;F. J. Duarte, Secure interferometric communications in free space, ''Opt. Commun.'' '''205''', 313-319 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  between spacecraft.  This is due to the fact that propagating ''N''-slit interferograms suffer catastrophic collapse from interception attempts using macroscopic optical methods such as beam splitting.&lt;ref name=JOA /&gt;  Recent experimental developments include terrestrial intra-interferometric path lengths of 35 meters&lt;ref name=JOPT2010&gt;[http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/2040-8986/12/1/015705 F. J. Duarte, T. S. Taylor, A. B. Clark, and W. E. Davenport, The ''N''-slit interferometer: an extended configuration, ''J. Opt.'' '''12''', 015705 (2010).]&lt;/ref&gt; and 527 meters.&lt;ref name = JOPT2011&gt;[http://iopscience.iop.org/2040-8986/13/3/035710 F. J. Duarte, T. S. Taylor, A. M. Black, W. E. Davenport, and P. G. Varmette, ''N''-slit interferometer for secure free-space optical communications: 527 m intra interferometric path length , ''J. Opt.'' '''13''', 035710 (2011).]&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
These large, and very large, ''N''-slit interferometers are also being used to study various propagation effects including microscopic disturbances on propagating interferometric signals.  This work has yielded the first observation of diffraction patterns superimposed over propagating interferograms.&lt;ref name = JOPT2011 /&gt;

These diffraction patterns (as shown in the first photograph) are generated by inserting a [[spider web]] fiber (or [[spider silk]] thread) into the propagation path of the N-slit interferogram.  The position of the spider web fiber is perpendicular to the plane of propagation.&lt;ref name = JOPT2011 /&gt;

===Clear air turbulence===

''N''-slit interferometers, using large intra interferometric distances, have been found to be effective detectors of [[Clear-air turbulence|clear air turbulence]].&lt;ref name=JOPT2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=JOPT2011 /&gt; Here, it should be mentioned that the distortions induced by clear air turbulence upon the interferometric signal are different, in both character and magnitude, from the catastrophic collapse resulting from attempted interception of optical signals using macroscopic optical elements such as beam splitters.&lt;ref&gt;F. J. Duarte, Interferometric imaging, in ''Tunable Laser Applications'', 2nd Edition (CRC, New York, 2009) Chapter 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expanded beam interferometric microscopy===

As previously mentioned the original application of the ''N''-slit laser interferometer was ''interferometric imaging''.&lt;ref name="OC1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TLA&gt;F. J. Duarte, Interferometric imaging, in ''Tunable Laser Applications'' (Marcel-Dekker, New York, 1995) Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the one dimensionally expanded laser beam (with a cross section 25-50 mm wide by 10-25 μm high) was used to illuminate imaging surfaces (such as silver-halide films) to measure the microscopic density of the illuminated surface.  Hence the use of the description ''interferometric [[microdensitometer]]''.&lt;ref name="US1993"/&gt;  Resolution down to the nano regime can be provided via the use of [[N-slit interferometric equation|interinterferometric calculations]].&lt;ref name="OC1993"/&gt;  When used as a microdensitometer the ''N''-slit interferometer is also known as a ''laser microdensitometer''.&lt;ref name=TLA /&gt;

The multiple-prism expanded laser beam is also described as an [[beam expander|extremely elongated laser beam]].  The elongated dimension of the beam (25-50 mm) is in the plane of propagation while the very thin dimension (in the μm regime) of the beam is in the orthogonal plane.  This was demonstrated, for imaging and microscopy applications, in 1993.&lt;ref name="OC1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US1993"/&gt; Alternative descriptions of this type of extremely elongated illumination include the terms line illumination, linear illumination, thin light sheet illumination (in light sheet microscopy), and plane illumination (in selective plane illumination microscopy).

[[File:London (1932) Ending the depression through planned obsolescence.pdf|thumb|''Ending the [[Depression (economics)|Depression]] Through Planned Obsolescence'' by Bernard London, 1932]]

'''Obsolescence''' is the state of being which occurs when an object, service, or practice is no longer wanted even though it may still be in good working order; however, the international standard EN62402 Obsolescence Management - Application Guide defines '''Obsolescence''' as being the "transition from availability of products by the original manufacturer or supplier to unavailability". Obsolescence frequently occurs because a replacement has become available that has, in sum, more advantages compared to the disadvantages incurred by maintaining or repairing the original. '''Obsolete''' also refers to something that is already disused or discarded, or antiquated.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler HW and Fowler FG (1st ed.), Thompson Delia (ed.) (1995). The Hardy Boyz use the term "obsolete mule" at times. ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English'', 9th Ed., Clarendon Press, Oxford. {{ISBN|0-19-861319-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, obsolescence is preceded by a gradual decline in popularity.

==Consequences==
Driven by rapid [[technological change]]s, new components are developed and launched on the market with increasing speed. The result is a dramatic change in production methods of all components and their market availability. A growing industry sector is facing issues where life cycles of products no longer fit together with life cycles of required components. This issue is known as obsolescence, the status given to a part when it is no longer available from its original manufacturer. The problem of obsolescence is most prevalent for electronics technology, wherein the procurement lifetimes for microelectronic parts are often significantly shorter than the manufacturing and support life cycles for the products that use the parts. However, obsolescence extends beyond electronic components to other items, such as materials, textiles, and mechanical parts. In addition, obsolescence has been shown to appear for software, specifications, standards, processes, and soft resources, such as human skills. It is highly important to implement and operate an active management of obsolescence to mitigate and avoid extreme costs.&lt;ref&gt;Bjoern Bartels, Ulrich Ermel, Peter Sandborn and Michael G. Pecht (2012). ''Strategies to the Prediction, Mitigation and Management of Product Obsolescence'', 1st. Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., Hoboken, New Jersey. {{ISBN|1-11-814064-8}} .&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Technical obsolescence===
Technical obsolescence usually occurs when a new product or technology supersedes the old one, and it is preferred to use the new technology instead. Historical examples of new technologies superseding old ones include [[bronze]] replacing [[flint]] in hand-tools, [[DVD]]s replacing [[videocassette recorder|videocassettes]], and the [[telephone]] replacing the [[telegraph]]. On a smaller scale, a particular product may become obsolete when a newer version replaces it. Many products in the computer industry become obsolete in this manner. For example, [[central processing unit]]s (CPUs) frequently become obsolete in favor of newer, faster units. Singularly, rapid obsolescence of [[data]] formats along with their supporting hardware and software can lead to loss of critical information, a process known as [[digital obsolescence]].

In many cases, a new technology does not totally replace the old technology because the old technology is still useful in certain applications. For example, [[transistor]]s replaced [[vacuum tube]]s in TV and radio receivers in the 1960s, but vacuum tubes were still used for powerful transmitters because transistors for these power levels were not available. Even today, one has to use multiple transistors for a purpose that used to require just one tube.

Products may also become obsolete when supporting technologies are no longer available to produce or even repair a product. For example, many [[integrated circuit]]s, including CPUs, memory and even some relatively simple logic chips may no longer be produced because the technology has been superseded, their original developer has gone out of business or a competitor has bought them out and effectively killed off their products to remove competition. It is rarely worth redeveloping a product to get around these issues since its overall functionality and price/performance ratio has usually been superseded by that time as well.

Some products become technologically obsolete due to changes in complementary products which results in the function of the first product being made unnecessary. For example, [[buggy whip]]s became obsolete when people started to travel in cars rather than in horse-drawn buggies.

=== Functional obsolescence ===
Items become functionally obsolete when they can no longer adequately perform the function for which they were created. For example, while one could theoretically adapt an [[Avro Lancaster]] to deploy modern [[JDAM]] bombs, the situations in which it could actually succeed at doing so against modern air defenses would be so few that it would be essentially useless.

Manufacturers and repair companies will typically cease support for products once they become obsolete as keeping production lines in place and parts in storage for a shrinking user base becomes unprofitable. This causes scarcity of spare parts and skilled technicians for repairs and thus escalates maintenance costs for obsolete products. This ultimately leads to prohibitive expense in keeping old technology functioning.

=== Architectural obsolescence ===
The term "obsolescence" was first applied to the built environment in 1910 in an attempt to explain American skyscrapers' sudden loss of value.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abramson|first=Daniel|year=2012|title=From Obsolescence to Sustainability, Back Again, and Beyond|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=3|pages=279-298|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York engineer Reginald P. Bolton attributed this phenomenon to "something new and better out-competing the old" and calculated the average architectural lifespan of varying building types in order to formulate a rough estimate for their impending obsolescence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, he suggested that hotel's obsolescence will occur faster than banks due to their ever-changing functions and tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Building for Profit: Principles Governing the Economic Improvement of Real Estate|last=Bolton|first=R.P.|publisher=De Vinne|year=1911|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planned obsolescence===
{{Main article|Planned obsolescence}}
Sometimes [[marketing|marketer]]s deliberately introduce obsolescence into their [[product management|product strategy]], with the objective of generating long-term sales volume by reducing the time between repeat purchases. One example might be producing an appliance which is deliberately designed to wear out within five years of its purchase, pushing consumers to replace it within five years.

===Style obsolescence===
[[File:Jimi Hendrix's bell-bottoms, Hard Rock Cafe Hollywood.JPG|thumb|right|180px|[[Jimi Hendrix]]'s bell-bottoms]]

When a product is no longer desirable because it has gone out of the popular fashion, its style is obsolete. One example is [[Bell-bottoms|flared leg jeans]]; although this article of clothing may still be perfectly functional, it is no longer desirable because style trends have moved away from the flared leg cut.

Because of the "fashion cycle", stylistically obsolete products may eventually regain popularity and cease to be obsolete. A current example is "[[Stone washing|acid-wash]]" jeans, which were popular in the 1980s, became stylistically obsolete in the mid to late 1990s, and returned to popularity in the 2000s.

===Obsolescence management===
{{Main article|DMSMS}}

Obsolescence management, also referred to as "Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages" (DMSMS), is defined as to the activities that are undertaken to mitigate the effects of obsolescence. Activities can include last-time buys, lifetime buys, and obsolescence monitoring.

An '''outrigger''' is a projecting structure on a boat, with specific meaning depending on types of vessel. Outriggers may also refer to legs on a wheeled vehicle which are folded out when it needs stabilization, for example on a [[crane (machine)|crane]] that lifts heavy loads.
[[File:German Patriot missile launcher.jpg|thumb|right|Missile vehicle standing on its outriggers to stabilize launch]]

==Powered vessels and sailboats==
{{See also|Outrigger canoe}}
An outrigger describes any contraposing float [[rigging]] beyond the side ([[gunwale]]) of a boat to improve the vessel's stability. If a single outrigger is used it is usually but not always [[windward]].&lt;ref&gt;''Early Ships and Seafaring: Water Transport Beyond Europe''; Sean McGrail; Glossary&lt;/ref&gt; The technology was originally developed by the [[Austronesian people]]. There are two main types of boats with outriggers: double outriggers (prevalent in [[maritime Southeast Asia]] and [[Madagascar]]) and single outriggers (prevalent in [[Melanesia]], [[Micronesia]] and [[Polynesia]]). [[Multihull]] ships are also derived from outrigger boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Texas|first1=Edwin Doran Jr.|title=Outrigger ages|journal=The Journal of the Polynesian Society|date=1974|volume=83|issue=2|pages=130&amp;ndash;140|url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document//Volume_83_1974/Volume_83%2C_No._2/Outrigger_ages%2C_by_Edwin_Doran_Jnr.%2C_p_130-140/p1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[outrigger canoe]] and in [[sailboats]] such as the [[proa]], an outrigger is a thin, long, solid, [[hull (ship)|hull]] used to stabilise an inherently unstable main hull. The outrigger is positioned rigidly and parallel to the main hull so that the main hull is less likely to [[capsize]].  If only one outrigger is used on a vessel, its [[weight]] reduces the tendency to capsize in one direction and its [[buoyancy]] reduces the tendency in the other direction.

On a [[keelboat]], "outrigger" refers to a variety of structures by which the [[running rigging]] (such as a [[sheet (sailing)|sheet]]) may be attached outboard (outside the lateral limits) of the boat's [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]. The [[Racing Rules of Sailing]] generally prohibit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Racing Rules of Sailing 2017-2020 | url=http://www.sailing.org/tools/documents/WorldSailingRRS20172020-[20946].pdf#page=35 | access-date=2016-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such outriggers, though they are explicitly permitted on specific classes, such as the [[IMOCA 60|IMOCA Open 60]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sailing.org/tools/documents/IMOCA%20CR_2008-[5871].pdf#page=14 |title=Class Rules - IMOCA 60 (Open 60 Monohull)| access-date=2016-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; used in several major offshore races.

==Fishing==
In [[fishing]] from vessels, an outrigger is a pole or series of poles that allow boats to trawl more lines in the water without tangling and simulates a school of fish.

==Rowing==
[[Image:Scullers_with_outriggers_1851.jpg|thumb|Early racing sculls with outriggers in 1851.]]
In a [[Watercraft rowing|rowing]] boat or [[galley]], an outrigger (or just rigger) is a triangular frame that holds the [[rowlock]] (into which the [[oar]] is slotted) away from the saxboard (gunwale for gig rowing) to optimize leverage. Wooden outriggers appear on the new [[trireme]] around the 7th or 6th centuries BC and later on Italian galleys around AD 1300 {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} while [[Harry Clasper]] (1812–1870), a [[United Kingdom|British]] professional rower, popularised the use of the modern metal version and the top rowing events accepted the physiological and ergonomic advantages so acceded to its use in competitions.  '''Wing-riggers''' are made by some manufacturers of [[racing shells]] which are reinforced arcs or form a single projection akin to aircraft wings instead of conventional thin metal triangular structures.

A '''pyrheliometer''' is an instrument for measurement of direct beam [[solar irradiance]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kippzonen.com/?productgroup/881/Pyrheliometers.aspx {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412235813/http://www.kippzonen.com/?productgroup%2F881%2FPyrheliometers.aspx |date=2009-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sunlight enters the instrument through a 
window and is directed onto a [[thermopile]] which converts heat to an electrical signal that can be recorded. The signal voltage is converted via a formula to measure watts per square metre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.global-greenhouse-warming.com/pyrheliometer.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is used with a solar tracking system to keep the instrument aimed at the sun. A pyrheliometer is often used in the same setup with a [[pyranometer]].

==Standards==
Pyrheliometer measurement specifications are subject to [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) standards.
Comparisons between pyrheliometers for intercalibration are carried out regularly to measure the amount of solar energy received.
The aim of the International Pyrheliometer Comparisons,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmodwrc.ch/pmod.php?topic=ipc_menu International Pyrheliometer Comparisons]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which take place every 5 years at the World Radiation Centre&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070702010053/http://www.pmodwrc.ch/pmod.php?topic=world_radiation_center World Radiation Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Davos]], is to ensure the world-wide transfer of the World Radiometric Reference.
During this event, all participants bring their instruments, solar-tracking and data acquisition systems to Davos to conduct simultaneous solar radiation measurements with the World Standard Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pmodwrc.ch/pmod.php?topic=ipc9{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Typical pyrheliometer measurement applications include scientific meteorological and climate observations, material testing research, and assessment of the efficiency of [[Solar thermal collector|solar collector]]s and [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic devices]].

== Usage ==
Pyrheliometers are typically mounted on a [[solar tracker]]. As the pyrheliometer only 'sees' the solar disk, it needs to be placed on a device that follows the path of the sun.

The '''R. J. Mitchell Wind Tunnel''' is a low-speed [[wind tunnel]] which is part of the Faculty of Engineering and the Environment at the [[University of Southampton]]. It is the largest wind tunnel in University ownership in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} It is named after famed British aircraft designer [[R.J. Mitchell]].

== History ==
The tunnel was built in the 1930s as part of the Farnborough Royal Aircraft Establishment cluster of tunnels.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} The tunnel was purchased by the [[University of Southampton]] for a minimal fee in 1979 on the understanding that they would cover the cost of transport and recommissioning at its new site on the Highfield Campus.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} This purchase was in response to a business case put forward at the time which focused around the need for more capacity to cope with increasing motorsport demand.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Previously the 7x5 wind tunnel had been heavily utilised by many F1 teams and a larger facility was deemed desirable to increase model scales. The tunnel was first run in Southampton in 1981{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} and was formally opened by [[R. J. Mitchell]]’s son, Gordon Mitchell.

In the 1980s and 90s the tunnel was used extensively by Formula 1 teams as well as [[Team Penske]] who developed many Indy Cars in the facility.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} In the early 00s the tunnel was able to be utilised by University students and researchers as well as a variety of customers from various industries.

In 2013 the existing building was extended to provide a new entrance area to update the look of the building while providing new facilities for users as well as wheelchair access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studiofourarchitects.com/wind-tunnel-university-of-southampton/|title=Wind Tunnel, University of Southampton - Studio Four Architects|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This extension was formally opened by [[Chris Boardman]] in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southampton.ac.uk/engineering/news/2014/01/13_wind_tunnel_opening.page|title=Wind Tunnel Opening - Engineering and the Environment - University of Southampton|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Wind Tunnel Facility ==
In January 2014 the R. J. Mitchell Wind Tunnel became a ‘[[National Wind Tunnel Facility]]’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/research/facilities/access/otherfacilities/nationalwindtunnelfacility/|title=National Wind Tunnel Facility (NWTF) - EPSRC website|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; under a government initiative announced by minister for Science and Universities [[David Willetts]]. The initiative gave 17 facilities access to a total of £13.3 million with funding coming from both [[EPSRC]] and the UK Aerodynamic Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-25668025|title=Seven universities set up national wind tunnel facility|author=|date=9 January 2014|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funding allocated to the tunnel was used to design and build a traverse system, install a combined chiller/heat pump into the circuit and also funded both a high resolution and high speed [[Particle Image Velocimetry]] (PIV) systems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

== Capabilities ==
The R. J. Mitchell Wind Tunnel is a closed test section, closed return type wind tunnel powered by a {{convert|746|kW|abbr=on}} electric motor. The test section is 3.5m wide by 2.4m high (11&amp;nbsp;ft by 8&amp;nbsp;ft) and the tunnel is capable of creating wind speeds of up to 40&amp;nbsp;m/s (90&amp;nbsp;mph).{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} The tunnel has a moving ground installed along with dual stage boundary layer suction for ground effect or vehicle testing.

The facility has a range of possible configurations including an overhead 6-component balance, mechanised strut with in-car 6-component balance for vehicle work as well as a 2-component underfloor dynamometer that is used primarily for performance sports work. This sports work was initiated before the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games when the tunnel was an integral part of the 'Secret Squirrel Club' used to help improve the performance of the Team GB cycle team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://impact.ref.ac.uk/CaseStudies/CaseStudy.aspx?Id=44168|title=REF Case study search|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success in cycling was also continued in the Winter Games when the Team GB Skeleton Bob team used the tunnel as part of a research project which resulted in [[Amy Williams]] winning Gold in Vancouver.

The facility has various data acquisition systems available including pressure scanning and PIV systems.

[[Image:RollerReamer001.jpg|thumb|Roller reamer]]
'''Roller reamers''' are employed in [[Boring (earth)|boring]] operations for the oil &amp; gas industry.
The main function of roller reamers cut earth formations to enlarge the [[borehole]] to the desirable size during well drilling operation, which may be the original size of the [[drill bit]] in the case where the [[drill bit]] wears to be under-gauged. However, even for new drill bits, roller reamers are employed to cut formations because the bit does not always drill a true bore hole and because of slight lateral shifting which is inherent in the drilling operation, which shifting leaves ledges and other distortions.
Additionally, the second function of a roller reamer is to keep the drill stem in the center of the hole at the specific position of placement of the roller-reamer. In providing such a function, a reamer is often referred to as a stabilizer. Maintaining the drill stem centered has many beneficial effects, its primary one being minimizing unintentional hole-angle [[directional drilling]].

==Sizes==
[[Image:RollerReamer002.jpg|thumb|Range of Roller-reamers]]
Popular hole sizes for well bores range from 5" to 26" in diameter. Size of circulation passage through the center of the body of the reamer typically range from 1 1/2" to 3 1/4" in diameter. The body size on the necks beyond the area where the rollers are mounted typically range from 4 1/8" to 11" in diameter. This latter size will normally be the same size as the drill collar. Body links normally range from 4' to 8'.

==3-point / 6-point==
Most roller-reamers have three rollers equally spaced in a single transverse section. Such roller-reamers are referred to as "3-point reamer". When two sets of three rollers spaced apart longitudinally are used, the roller-reamer is called a "6-point reamer". However, large diameter roller-reamers may have more than three rollers in one transverse section.

[[File:Airbus A380 cockpit.jpg|thumb|[[Airbus A380]] flight deck showing side-sticks]]
[[File:F16 ohjaamo.jpg|thumb|F-16 cockpit showing side-stick]]
A '''side-stick''' or '''sidestick controller''' is an [[aircraft]] control column (or [[joystick]]) that is located on the side console of the [[Aviator|pilot]], usually on the righthand side, or outboard on a two-seat [[Cockpit (aviation)|flightdeck]]. Typically this is found in aircraft that are equipped with [[fly-by-wire]] control systems.&lt;ref name="Crane"&gt;Crane, Dale: ''Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition'', page 463. Aviation Supplies &amp; Academics, 1997. {{ISBN|1-56027-287-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The throttle controls are typically located to the left of the pilot (or centrally on a two-seat flightdeck). Only one hand may thus be used for the stick, and both-hands operation is neither possible nor required.

The side-stick is used in many modern military [[fighter aircraft]], such as the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]], [[Mitsubishi F-2]], [[Dassault Rafale]], and [[F-22 Raptor]], and also on civil aircraft, such as the [[Sukhoi Superjet 100]], [[Airbus A320]] and later [[Airbus]] aircraft,&lt;ref name=fbw_sidestick&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the largest passenger jet in service, the [[Airbus A380]].

This arrangement contrasts with the more conventional design where the stick is located in the centre of the cockpit between the pilot's legs, called a "[[centre stick]]".

In the centre stick design, both the pilot's and co-pilot's controls are mechanically connected together so each pilot has a sense of the control inputs of the other. In typical Airbus side-stick implementations, the sticks are independent. The plane's computer either aggregates multiple inputs or a pilot can press a "priority button" to lock out inputs from the other side-stick.&lt;ref name=getline&gt;{{Citation

'''''Supervisory circuits''''' are [[electronic circuit]]s that monitor one or more parameters of systems such as power supplies and [[microprocessors]] which must be maintained within certain limits,and take appropriate action if a parameter goes out of bounds, creating an unacceptable or dangerous situation.  

Supervisory circuits are known by a variety of names, including battery monitors, power supply monitors, supply supervisory circuits, and reset circuits.

==Thermal protection==

A thermal protection circuit consists of a temperature-monitoring circuit and a control circuit.  The control circuit may either shut down the circuitry it is protecting, reduce the power available in order to avoid overheating, or notify the system (software or user).  These circuits may be quite complex, programmable and software-run, or simple with predefined limits.&lt;ref name="MaximIC"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/an_pk/961 |title = Thermal Protection in Low-Cost Systems |accessdate = 2008-06-30 |publisher = [[Maxim Integrated Products]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overvoltage and undervoltage protection==

Voltage protection circuits protect circuitry from either overvoltage or undervoltage; either of these situations can have detrimental effects.&lt;ref name="TexasInst"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://focus.ti.com/lit/an/slva163/slva163.pdf |title = Overvoltage Protector for High-Voltage Loads |accessdate = 2008-06-30 |publisher = [[Texas Instruments]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supervisory circuits that specifically focus on voltage regulation are often sold as [[supply voltage supervisors]] and will reset the protected circuit when the voltage returns to operating range.

Two types of overvoltage protection devices are currently used: clamping, which passes through voltages up to a certain level, and foldback, which shunts voltage away from the load.  The shunting creates a [[short circuit]] which removes power from the protected circuitry.&lt;ref name="TycoElec"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.tycoelectronics.com/documentation/whitepapers/pdf/eDigest-Circuit_Protection_Devices.pdf |title = Coordinated Circuit Protection Schemes Help Prevent Overvoltage and Overcurrent Damage |accessdate = 2008-06-30 |publisher = [[Tyco Electronics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In certain applications this circuitry can reset itself after the dangerous condition has passed.

[[Image:Speedometer.jpg|thumb|300px|Left figure shows a tachometer that can show up to 7000 [[revolutions per minute|RPM]]]]
A '''tachometer''' ('''revolution-counter''', '''tach''', '''rev-counter''', '''RPM gauge''') is an instrument measuring the rotation speed of a [[axle|shaft]] or disk, as in a motor or other machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erjavec|first=Jack|title=Automotive Technology|year=2005|isbn=1-4018-4831-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The device usually displays the [[revolutions per minute]] (RPM) on a calibrated analogue dial, but digital displays are increasingly common.  
The word comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ταχος'' (''tachos'' "speed") and ''metron'' ("measure"). Essentially the words tachometer and speedometer have identical meaning: a device that measures speed. It is by arbitrary convention that in the automotive world one is used for engine and the other for vehicle speed. In formal engineering nomenclature, more precise terms are used to distinguish the two.

==History==
The first mechanical tachometers were based on measuring the [[centrifugal force]], similar to the operation of a [[centrifugal governor]]. The inventor is assumed to be the German engineer [[Diedrich Uhlhorn|Dietrich Uhlhorn]]; he used it for measuring the speed of machines in 1817.{{fact|date=January 2013}} Since 1840, it has been used to measure the speed of [[Locomotive|locomotives]].

==In automobiles, trucks, tractors and aircraft==

[[Image:c172 g1000 mfd.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Cessna 172]]'s [[G1000]] tachometer (1,060 RPM) and engine hours (1736.7 hours)]]

Tachometers or revolution counters on cars, aircraft, and other vehicles show the rate of rotation of the engine's [[crankshaft]], and typically have markings indicating a safe range of rotation speeds.  This can assist the driver in selecting appropriate throttle and gear settings for the driving conditions. Prolonged use at high speeds may cause inadequate [[lubrication]], overheating (exceeding capability of the cooling system), exceeding speed capability of sub-parts of the engine (for example spring retracted valves) thus causing excessive wear or permanent damage or failure of engines. This is more applicable to [[manual transmission]]s than to automatics. On analogue tachometers, speeds above maximum safe operating speed are typically indicated by an area of the gauge marked in red, giving rise to the expression of "[[redline|redlining]]" an engine — revving the engine up to the maximum safe limit. The red zone is superfluous on most modern{{specify|date=July 2015}} cars, since their engines typically have a [[rev limiter|revolution limiter]] which electronically limits engine speed to prevent damage. [[Diesel engine]]s with traditional mechanical injector systems have an integral [[Governor (device)|governor]] which prevents over-speeding the engine, so the tachometers in vehicles and machinery fitted with such engines sometimes lack a [[redline]].

In vehicles such as tractors and trucks, the tachometer often has other markings, usually a green arc showing the speed range in which the engine produces maximum [[torque]], which is of prime interest to operators of such vehicles. Tractors fitted with a [[power take-off]] (PTO) system have tachometers showing the engine speed needed to rotate the PTO at the standardized speed required by most PTO-driven implements. In many countries, tractors are required to have a [[speedometer]] for use on a road. To save fitting a second dial, the vehicle's tachometer is often marked with a second scale in units of speed. This scale is only accurate in a certain gear, but since many tractors only have one gear that is practical for use on-road, this is sufficient. Tractors with multiple 'road gears' often have tachometers with more than one speed scale.  Aircraft tachometers have a green arc showing the engine's designed cruising speed range.

In older vehicles, the tachometer is driven by the RMS voltage waves from the low tension (LT) side of the [[ignition coil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/encyclopedia/entry/tachomet |title=Tachometer - Facts from the Encyclopedia - Yahoo! Education |publisher=Education.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106222358/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/encyclopedia/entry/tachomet |archivedate=2012-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while on others (and nearly all [[diesel engine]]s, which have no ignition system) engine speed is determined by the frequency from the [[alternator (auto)|alternator]] tachometer output.  This is from a special connection called an "AC tap" which is a connection to one of the stator's coil output, before the rectifier. Tachometers driven by a rotating cable from a drive unit fitted to the engine (usually on the [[camshaft]]) exist - usually on simple diesel-engined machinery with basic or no electrical systems. On recent [[engine management system|EMS]] found on modern vehicles, the signal for the tachometer is usually generated from an [[Engine control unit|ECU]] which derives the information from  either the crankshaft or [[camshaft]] speed sensor.

===Traffic engineering===
Tachometers are used to estimate traffic speed and volume (flow). A vehicle is equipped with the sensor and conducts "tach runs" which record the traffic data. These data are a substitute or complement to [[loop detector]] data. To get statistically significant results requires a high number of runs, and bias is introduced by the time of day, day of week, and the season. However, because of the expense, spacing (a lower density of loop detectors diminishes data accuracy), and relatively low reliability of loop detectors (often 30% or more are out of service at any given time), tach runs remain a common practice.

==In trains and light rail vehicles==
{{Main|Wheel speed sensor}}
Speed sensing devices, termed variously "wheel impulse generators" (WIG), speed probes, or tachometers are used extensively in rail vehicles. Common types include [[opto-isolator]] slotted disk sensors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haslerrail.com/index.php?id=50 |title=HaslerRail Speed Sensors |publisher=Haslerrail.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hall effect sensor]]s.

Hall effect sensors typically use a rotating target attached to a wheel, gearbox or motor. This target may contain magnets, or it may be a toothed wheel.  The teeth on the wheel vary the flux density of a magnet inside the sensor head. The probe is mounted with its head a precise distance from the target wheel and detects the teeth or magnets passing its face. One problem with this system is that the necessary air gap between the target wheel and the sensor allows ferrous dust from the vehicle's underframe to build up on the probe or target, inhibiting its function.

Opto-isolator sensors are completely encased to prevent ingress from the outside environment.  The only exposed parts are a sealed plug connector and a drive fork, which is attached to a slotted disk internally through a [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] and seal.  The slotted disk is typically sandwiched between two [[circuit board]]s containing a photo-[[diode]], photo-[[transistor]], amplifier, and filtering circuits which produce a square wave pulse train output customized to the customers voltage and pulses per revolution requirements.  These types of sensors typically provide 2 to 8 independent channels of output that can be sampled by other systems in the vehicle such as automatic train control systems and propulsion/braking controllers.

The sensors mounted around the circumference of the disk provide [[quadrature encoder|quadrature encoded]] outputs and thus allow the vehicle's computer to determine the direction of rotation of the wheel. This is a legal requirement in Switzerland to prevent ''rollback'' when starting from standstill. Strictly, such devices are not tachometers since they do not provide a direct reading of the rotational speed of the disk. The speed has to be derived externally by counting the number of pulses in a time period. It is difficult to prove conclusively that the vehicle is stationary, other than by waiting a certain time to ensure that no further pulses occur. This is one reason why there is often a time delay between the train stopping, as perceived by a passenger, and the doors being released. Slotted-disk devices are typical sensors used in [[odometer]] systems for rail vehicles, such as are required for [[train protection system]]s — notably the [[European Train Control System]].

As well as speed sensing, these probes are often used to calculate distance travelled by multiplying wheel rotations by wheel circumference.

They can be used to automatically calibrate wheel diameter by comparing the number of rotations of each axle against a master wheel that has been measured manually. Since all wheels travel the same distance, the diameter of each wheel is proportional to its number of rotations compared to the master wheel. This calibration must be done while coasting at a fixed speed to eliminate the possibility of wheel slip/slide introducing errors into the calculation. Automatic calibration of this type is used to generate more accurate traction and braking signals, and to improve wheel slip detection.

A weakness of systems that rely on wheel rotation for tachometry and odometry is that the train wheels and the rails are very smooth and the friction between them is low, leading to high error rates if the wheels slip or slide. To compensate for this, secondary odometry inputs employ [[Doppler radar]] units beneath the train to measure speed independently.

==In analogue audio recording==

In [[sound recording|analogue audio recording]], a tachometer is a device that measures the speed of [[audiotape]] as it passes across the head.  On most audio tape recorders the tachometer (or simply "tach") is a relatively large spindle near the [[ERP head stack]], isolated from the feed and take-up spindles by tension idlers.

On many recorders the tachometer spindle is connected by an axle to a rotating magnet that induces a changing [[magnetic field]] upon a [[Hall effect]] [[transistor]].  Other systems connect the spindle to a [[stroboscope]], which alternates light and dark upon a [[photodiode]].

The tape recorder's drive electronics use signals from the tachometer to ensure that the tape is played at the proper speed.  The signal is compared to a reference signal (either a [[quartz clock|quartz crystal]] or [[alternating current]] from the [[Mains electricity|mains]]).  The comparison of the two [[frequency|frequencies]] drives the speed of the tape transport.  When the tach signal and the reference signal match, the tape transport is said to be "at speed."  (To this day on film sets, the [[film director|director]] calls "Roll sound!" and the sound man replies "Sound speed!"  This is a vestige of the days when recording devices required several seconds to reach a regulated speed.)

Having perfectly regulated tape speed is important because the human ear is very sensitive to changes in pitch, particularly sudden ones, and without a self-regulating system to control the speed of tape across the head, the pitch could drift several percent.  This effect is called a [[wow (recording)|wow]]-and-[[Flutter (electronics and communication)|flutter]], and a modern, tachometer-regulated [[cassette deck]] has a wow-and-flutter of 0.07%.

Tachometers are acceptable for [[high-fidelity]] sound playback, but not for recording in synchronization with a [[movie camera]].  For such purposes, special recorders that record [[pilottone]] must be used.

Tachometer signals can be used to synchronize several tape machines together, but only if in addition to the tach signal, a directional signal is transmitted, to tell slave machines in which direction the master is moving.

A '''vinyl cutter''' is a type of [[computer]]-controlled [[machine]]. Small vinyl cutters look like a [[Printer (computing)|desktop printer]]. Like a printer controls a nozzle, the computer controls the movement of a sharp [[blade]] over the surface of the material.  This blade is used to cut out shapes and letters from sheets of thin [[wikt:sticky|self-adhesive]] [[plastic]] ([[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]]). The vinyl can then be stuck to a variety of surfaces depending on the adhesive and type of material.

To cut out a design a [[Vector graphics|vector-based image]] must be created in a software program (usually Adobe Illustrator or Corel Draw). It is then sent to the cutter where it cuts along the vector paths laid out in the design. The cutter is capable of moving the blade on an X and Y axis over the material, cutting it into any shape imaginable.  Since the vinyl material comes in long rolls, projects with significant length like banners or billboards can be easily cut as well.

The one major limitation with vinyl cutters is that they can only cut shapes from solid colours of vinyl. A design with multiple colours must have each colour cut separately and then layered on top of each other as it is applied to the substrate. Also, since the shapes are cut out of solid colours, photographs and gradients cannot be reproduced with a stand alone cutter.
 
In addition to the capabilities of the cutter itself, the adhesive vinyl comes in a wide variety of colours and materials including gold and silver foil, vinyl that simulates frosted glass, holographic vinyl, reflective vinyl, thermal transfer material, and even clear vinyl imbedded with gold leaf. (Often used in the lettering on fire trucks and rescue vehicles.)

==How it works==
As vinyl film is supplied by the manufacturer, it comes attached to a release liner.

===Design Creation===
Computer designed images are loaded onto the vinyl cutter via cords or over wifi depending on the model. Then the vinyl is loaded into the machine where it is automatically fed through and cut to follow the set design. 

===Cutting===
The vinyl cutter uses a small knife to precisely cut the outline of figures into a sheet or piece of vinyl, but not the release liner. The knife moves side to side and turns, while the vinyl is moved beneath the knife. The results from the cut process is an image cut into the material. 

===Weeding===
The material is then 'weeded' where the excess parts of the figures are removed from the release liner. It is possible to remove the positive parts, which would give a negative sticker, or remove the negative parts, giving a positive sticker. Removing the figure would be like removing the positive, giving a negative image of the figures.

===Transfer tape===
A sheet of transfer tape with an adhesive backing is laid on the weeded vinyl.  A roller is applied to the tape, causing it to adhere to the vinyl.  The transfer tape and the weeded vinyl is pulled off the release liner, and applied to a substrate, such as a sheet of aluminium.  This results in an aluminium sign with vinyl figures.

==Uses==
The vinyl cutter is an entry level machine for making signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://toptennotch.com/best-vinyl-cutter |title=Top 10 Best Vinyl Cutter – [Reviews &amp; Buying Guide 2018] |date=2018-04-04 |website=Top Ten Notch |language=en-US |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612142924/https://toptennotch.com/best-vinyl-cutter |archive-date=12 Jun 2018 |dead-url=no |access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://vinylcuttingmachines.net/beginners-guide-to-the-best-vinyl-cutting-machines |title=Best Vinyl Cutting Machines in 2018 &amp;#124; The Vinyl Cutter Guide |date=January 2, 2018 |website=vinylcuttingmachines.net |language=en-US |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180224091816/https://vinylcuttingmachines.net/beginners-guide-to-the-best-vinyl-cutting-machines/ |archive-date=24 Feb 2018 |dead-url=no |access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer designed [[Vector_graphics|vector files]] with patterns and letters are directly cut on the roll of vinyl which is mounted and fed into the vinyl cutter through USB or serial cable.

Some businesses use their vinyl cutter to produce both signs and custom apparel. Many crafters also have vinyl cutters for home use. These require little maintenance and the vinyl can be bought in bulk relatively cheaply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.thebestvinylcutters.com/best-vinyl-cutting-machine/ |title=Top 10 BEST Vinyl Cutting Machine Choices in 2018 (Reviews &amp; Guide) |website=The Best Vinyl Cutters |language=en-US |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619171427/https://www.thebestvinylcutters.com/best-vinyl-cutting-machine/ |archive-date=2018-06-19 |dead-url=no |access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Von Neumann Architecture.svg|thumb|Von Neumann architecture scheme]]

The '''von Neumann architecture'''—also known as the '''von Neumann model''' or '''Princeton architecture'''—is a [[computer architecture]] based on a 1945 description by the mathematician and physicist [[John von Neumann]] and others in the ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]''.&lt;ref name ="FirstDraftReport" /&gt; That document describes a design architecture for an electronic [[digital computer]] with
* A [[Central processing unit|processing unit]] that contains an [[arithmetic logic unit]] and [[processor register]]s
* A [[control unit]] that contains an [[instruction register]] and [[program counter]]
* [[Computer memory|Memory]] that stores [[Data (computing)|data]] and [[Instruction set|instructions]]
* External [[mass storage]]
* [[Input and output]] mechanisms&lt;ref name="FirstDraftReport"&gt;{{Citation |author-last=von Neumann |author-first=John |author-link=John von Neumann |title=First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC |date=1945 |url=https://sites.google.com/site/michaeldgodfrey/vonneumann/vnedvac.pdf |access-date=2011-08-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314123032/http://qss.stanford.edu/~godfrey/vonNeumann/vnedvac.pdf |archive-date=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GanesanCh4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ganesan|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The word has evolved to mean any [[stored-program computer]] in which an [[instruction fetch]] and a data operation cannot occur at the same time because they share a common [[Bus (computing)|bus]]. This is referred to as the [[#Von Neumann bottleneck|von Neumann bottleneck]] and often limits the performance of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author-last=Markgraf |author-first=Joey D. |title=The Von Neumann Bottleneck |date=2007 |url=http://aws.linnbenton.edu/cs271c/markgrj/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212205159/http://aws.linnbenton.edu/cs271c/markgrj/ |archive-date=December 12, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of a von Neumann architecture machine is simpler than a [[Harvard architecture]] machine—which is also a stored-program system but has one dedicated set of address and data buses for reading and writing to memory, and another set of address and [[Memory bus|data buses]] to fetch [[instruction fetch|instructions]].

A stored-program digital computer keeps both [[Computer program|program instructions]] and data in [[Read-write memory|read-write]], [[random-access memory]] (RAM).  Stored-program computers were an advancement over the program-controlled computers of the 1940s, such as the [[Colossus computer|Colossus]] and the [[ENIAC]]. Those were programmed by setting switches and inserting patch cables to route data and control signals between various functional units. The vast majority of modern computers use the same memory for both data and program instructions. The von Neumann vs. Harvard distinction applies to the [[CPU cache|cache]] architecture, not the main memory ([[Modified Harvard architecture#Split-cache (or_Almost-von-Neumann) architecture|split cache architecture]]).

==History==
The earliest computing machines had fixed programs.  Some very simple computers still use this design, either for simplicity or training purposes.  For example, a desk [[calculator]] (in principle) is a fixed program computer.  It can do basic [[mathematics]], but it cannot run a [[word processor]] or games.  Changing the program of a fixed-program machine requires rewiring, restructuring, or redesigning the machine.  The earliest computers were not so much "programmed" as  "designed" for a particular task.  "Reprogramming"—when possible at all—was a laborious process that started with [[flowchart]]s and paper notes, followed by detailed engineering designs, and then the often-arduous process of physically rewiring and rebuilding the machine. It could take three weeks to set up and debug a program on [[ENIAC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the proposal of the stored-program computer, this changed. A stored-program computer includes, by design, an [[instruction set]], and can store in memory a set of instructions (a [[computer program|program]]) that details the [[computation]].

A stored-program design also allows for [[self-modifying code]]. One early motivation for such a facility was the need for a program to increment or otherwise modify the address portion of instructions, which operators had to do manually in early designs. This became less important when [[index register]]s and [[Addressing mode|indirect addressing]] became usual features of machine architecture. Another use was to embed frequently used data in the instruction stream using [[Addressing mode|immediate addressing]]. Self-modifying code has largely fallen out of favor, since it is usually hard to understand and [[debugging|debug]], as well as being inefficient under modern processor [[pipeline (computing)|pipelining]] and caching schemes.

==Capabilities==
On a large scale, the ability to treat instructions as data is what makes [[Assembly language#Assembler|assemblers]], [[compiler]]s, [[Linker (computing)|linkers]], [[Loader (computing)|loaders]], and other automated programming tools possible. It makes "programs that write programs" possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/M/MFTL.html |title=''MFTL'' (My Favorite Toy Language) entry Jargon File 4.4.7 |access-date=2008-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has made a sophisticated self-hosting computing ecosystem flourish around von Neumann architecture machines.

Some high level languages such as [[LISP]] leverage the von Neumann architecture by providing an abstract, machine-independent way to manipulate executable code at runtime, or by using runtime information to tune [[just-in-time compilation]] (e.g. in the case of languages hosted on the [[Java virtual machine]], or languages embedded in [[web browsers]]).

On a smaller scale, some repetitive operations such as  [[Bit blit|BITBLT]] or [[High-level shader language|pixel and vertex shaders]] can be accelerated on general purpose processors with just-in-time compilation techniques. This is one use of self-modifying code that has remained popular.

==Development of the stored-program concept==
The mathematician [[Alan Turing]], who had been alerted to a problem of mathematical logic by the lectures of [[Max Newman]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], wrote a paper in 1936 entitled ''On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the [[Entscheidungsproblem]]'', which was published in the ''Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society''.&lt;ref name="Turing1936"&gt;{{Citation |author-last=Turing |author-first=Alan M. |author-link=Alan M. Turing |publication-date=1937 |date=1936 |title=On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem |periodical=Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society |series=2 |volume=42 |pages=230–265 |doi=10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230}} (and {{Citation |author-last=Turing |author-first=Alan M. |author-link=Alan M.

A correction |periodical=Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society |series=2 |volume=43 |pages=544–546 |doi=10.1112/plms/s2-43.6.544 |date=1938 |issue=6}})&lt;/ref&gt; In it he described a hypothetical machine he called a ''universal computing machine,'' now known as the "[[Universal Turing machine]]". The hypothetical machine had an infinite store (memory in today's terminology) that contained both instructions and data. [[John von Neumann]] became acquainted with Turing while he was a visiting professor at Cambridge in 1935, and also during Turing's PhD year at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] during 1936 – 1937. Whether he knew of Turing's paper of 1936 at that time is not clear.

In 1936, [[Konrad Zuse]] also anticipated in two patent applications that machine instructions could be stored in the same storage used for data.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Electronic Digital Computers |journal=Nature |date=September 25, 1948 |volume=162 |page=487 |url=http://www.computer50.org/kgill/mark1/natletter.html |access-date=2009-04-10 |doi=10.1038/162487a0 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406014626/http://www.computer50.org/kgill/mark1/natletter.html |archivedate=April 6, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independently, [[J. Presper Eckert]] and [[John Mauchly]], who were developing the [[ENIAC]] at the [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]], at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], wrote about the stored-program concept in December 1943.
&lt;ref name="Lukoff_1979"&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Lukoff |author-first=Herman |author-link=Herman Lukoff |title=From Dits to Bits: A personal history of the electronic computer |date=1979 |publisher=Robotics Press |location=Portland, Oregon, USA |isbn=0-89661-002-0 |lccn=79-90567}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ENIAC project administrator Grist Brainerd's December 1943 progress report for the first period of the ENIAC's development implicitly proposed the stored program concept (while simultaneously rejecting its implementation in the ENIAC) by stating that "in order to have the simplest project and not to complicate matters," the ENIAC would be constructed without any "automatic regulation.".&lt;/ref&gt; In planning a new machine, [[EDVAC]], Eckert wrote in January 1944 that they would store data and programs in a new addressable memory device, a mercury metal [[delay line memory]]. This was the first time the construction of a practical stored-program machine was proposed.  At that time, he and Mauchly were not aware of Turing's work.

Von Neumann was involved in the [[Manhattan Project]] at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], which required huge amounts of calculation. This drew him to the ENIAC project, during the summer of 1944. There he joined the ongoing discussions on the design of this stored-program computer, the EDVAC. As part of that group, he wrote up a description titled ''First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC''&lt;ref name ="FirstDraftReport"/&gt; based on the work of Eckert and Mauchly. It was unfinished when his colleague [[Herman Goldstine]] circulated it with only von Neumann's name on it, to the consternation of Eckert and Mauchly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper was read by dozens of von Neumann's colleagues in America and Europe, and influenced the next round of computer designs.

[[Jack Copeland]] considers that it is "historically inappropriate, to refer to electronic stored-program digital computers as 'von Neumann machines'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author-last=Copeland |author-first=Jack |author-link=Jack Copeland |title=A Brief History of Computing: ENIAC and EDVAC |date=2000 |url=http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/pages/Reference%20Articles/BriefHistofComp.html#ACE |access-date=2010-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Los Alamos colleague [[Stan Frankel]] said of von Neumann's regard for Turing's ideas:
{{quote|
I know that in or about 1943 or '44 von Neumann was well aware of the fundamental importance of Turing's paper of 1936… Von Neumann introduced me to that paper and at his urging I studied it with care. Many people have acclaimed von Neumann as the "father of the computer" (in a modern sense of the term) but I am sure that he would never have made that mistake himself. He might well be called the midwife, perhaps, but he firmly emphasized to me, and to others I am sure, that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing— in so far as not anticipated by Babbage… Both Turing and von Neumann, of course, also made substantial contributions to the "reduction to practice" of these concepts but I would not regard these as comparable in importance with the introduction and explication of the concept of a computer able to store in its memory its program of activities and of modifying that program in the course of these activities.

At the time that the "First Draft" report was circulated, Turing was producing a report entitled ''Proposed Electronic Calculator''. It described in engineering and programming detail, his idea of a machine he called the ''[[Automatic Computing Engine|Automatic Computing Engine (ACE)]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|pp=108–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; He presented this to the Executive Committee of the British [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] on February 19, 1946. Although Turing knew from his wartime experience at Bletchley Park that what he proposed was feasible, the secrecy surrounding [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], that was subsequently maintained for several decades, prevented him from saying so. Various successful implementations of the ACE design were produced.

Both von Neumann's and Turing's papers described stored-program computers, but von Neumann's earlier paper achieved greater circulation and the computer architecture it outlined became known as the "von Neumann architecture". In the 1953 publication ''Faster than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines'' (edited by B. V. Bowden), a section in the chapter on ''Computers in America'' reads as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bowden|1953|pp=176,177}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''The Machine of the Institute For Advanced Studies, Princeton'''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 1945, Professor J. von Neumann, who was then working at the Moore School of Engineering in Philadelphia, where the E.N.I.A.C. had been built, issued on behalf of a group of his co-workers, a report on the logical design of digital computers. The report contained a detailed proposal for the design of the machine that has since become known as the E.D.V.A.C. (electronic discrete variable automatic computer). This machine has only recently been completed in America, but the von Neumann report inspired the construction of the E.D.S.A.C. (electronic delay-storage automatic calculator) in Cambridge (see page 130).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 1947, Burks, Goldstine and von Neumann published another report that outlined the design of another type of machine (a parallel machine this time) that would be exceedingly fast, capable perhaps of 20,000 operations per second. They pointed out that the outstanding problem in constructing such a machine was the development of suitable memory with instantaneously accessible contents. At first they suggested using a special [[vacuum tube]]—called the "[[Selectron tube|Selectron]]"—which the Princeton Laboratories of RCA had invented. These tubes were expensive and difficult to make, so von Neumann subsequently decided to build a machine based on the [[Williams tube|Williams memory]]. This machine—completed in June, 1952 in Princeton—has become popularly known as the Maniac. The design of this machine inspired at least half a dozen machines now being built in America, all known affectionately as "Johniacs."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same book, the first two paragraphs of a chapter on ACE read as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bowden|1953|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Automatic Computation at the National Physical Laboratory'''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One of the most modern digital computers which embodies developments and improvements in the technique of automatic electronic computing was recently demonstrated at the National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, where it has been designed and built by a small team of mathematicians and electronics research engineers on the staff of the Laboratory, assisted by a number of production engineers from the English Electric Company, Limited. The equipment so far erected at the Laboratory is only the pilot model of a much larger installation which will be known as the Automatic Computing Engine, but although comparatively small in bulk and containing only about 800 thermionic valves, as can be judged from Plates XII, XIII and XIV, it is an extremely rapid and versatile calculating machine.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The basic concepts and abstract principles of computation by a machine were formulated by Dr. A. M. Turing, F.R.S., in a paper&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. read before the London Mathematical Society in 1936, but work on such machines in Britain was delayed by the war. In 1945, however, an examination of the problems was made at the National Physical Laboratory by Mr. J. R. Womersley, then superintendent of the Mathematics Division of the Laboratory. He was joined by Dr. Turing and a small staff of specialists, and, by 1947, the preliminary planning was sufficiently advanced to warrant the establishment of the special group already mentioned. In April, 1948, the latter became the Electronics Section of the Laboratory, under the charge of Mr. F. M. Colebrook.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early stored-program computers==
The date information in the following chronology is difficult to put into proper order. Some dates are for first running a test program, some dates are the first time the computer was demonstrated or completed, and some dates are for the first delivery or installation.

* The [[IBM SSEC]] had the ability to treat instructions as data, and was publicly demonstrated on January 27, 1948. This ability was claimed in a US patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|2636672|src=uspto|Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator (USPTO Web site)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|2636672|Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator (Google Patents)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it was partially electromechanical, not fully electronic.

==Evolution==
[[File:Computer system bus.svg|thumb|uprigt=1.8|Single [[system bus]] evolution of the architecture]]

Through the decades of the 1960s and 1970s computers generally became both smaller and faster, which led to evolutions in their architecture. For example, [[memory-mapped I/O]] lets input and output devices be treated the same as memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=A New Architecture for Mini-Computers—The DEC PDP-11 |author-first1=C.

In subsequent decades, simple [[microcontrollers]] would sometimes omit features of the model to lower cost and size.
Larger computers added features for higher performance.

==Design limitations==
===Von Neumann bottleneck===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Random-access memory]] --&gt;
The shared bus between the program memory and data memory leads to the ''von Neumann bottleneck'', the limited [[throughput]] (data transfer rate) between the [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and memory compared to the amount of memory.  Because the single bus can only access one of the two classes of memory at a time, throughput is lower than the rate at which the CPU can work.  This seriously limits the effective processing speed when the CPU is required to perform minimal processing on large amounts of data.  The CPU is continually&lt;!-- http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/continual#Usage_notes --&gt; [[Wait state|forced to wait]] for needed data to move to or from memory.  Since CPU speed and memory size have increased much faster than the throughput between them, the bottleneck has become more of a problem, a problem whose severity increases with every new generation of CPU.

The von Neumann bottleneck was described by [[John Backus]] in his 1977 ACM [[Turing Award]] lecture.  According to Backus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Surely there must be a less primitive way of making big changes in the store than by pushing vast numbers of [[Word (data type)|words]] back and forth through the von Neumann bottleneck. Not only is this tube a literal bottleneck for the data traffic of a problem, but, more importantly, it is an intellectual bottleneck that has kept us tied to word-at-a-time thinking instead of encouraging us to think in terms of the larger conceptual units of the task at hand. Thus programming is basically planning and detailing the enormous traffic of words through the von Neumann bottleneck, and much of that traffic concerns not significant data itself, but where to find it.&lt;ref name="backus"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1145/359576.359579 |title=Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style? A Functional Style and Its Algebra of Programs |author-last=Backus |author-first=John W. |author-link=John Backus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD692.html |title=E. W. Dijkstra Archive: A review of the 1977 Turing Award Lecture |access-date=2008-07-11 |author-first=Edsger W. |author-last=Dijkstra |author-link=Edsger W. Dijkstra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Mitigations====
There are several known methods for mitigating the Von Neumann performance bottleneck.  For example, the following all can improve performance{{why|date=November 2015}}:
*Providing a [[CPU cache|cache]] between the CPU and the [[main memory]]
*providing separate caches or separate access paths for data and instructions (the so-called [[Modified Harvard architecture]])
*using [[branch predictor]] algorithms and logic
*providing a limited CPU stack or other on-chip [[scratchpad memory]] to reduce memory access
*Implementing the CPU and the [[memory hierarchy]] as a [[System on a chip|system on chip]], providing greater [[locality of reference]] and thus reducing latency and increasing throughput between [[Processor register|processor registers]] and [[main memory]]

The problem can also be sidestepped somewhat by using [[parallel computing]], using for example the [[non-uniform memory access]] (NUMA) architecture—this approach is commonly employed by supercomputers. It is less clear whether the ''intellectual bottleneck'' that Backus criticized has changed much since 1977. Backus's proposed solution has not had a major influence.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Modern [[functional programming]] and [[object-oriented programming]] are much less geared towards "pushing vast numbers of words back and forth" than earlier languages like [[FORTRAN]] were, but internally, that is still what computers spend much of their time doing, even highly parallel supercomputers.

As of 1996, a database benchmark study found that three out of four CPU cycles were spent waiting for memory. Researchers expect that increasing the number of simultaneous instruction streams with [[multithreading (computer architecture)|multithreading]] or single-chip [[multiprocessing]] will make this bottleneck even worse.&lt;ref&gt;Sites, Richard L.; Patt, Yale. [http://cva.stanford.edu/classes/cs99s/papers/architects_look_to_future.pdf "Architects Look to Processors of Future"]. Microprocessor report. 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  In the context of [[Multi-core processor|multi-core processors]], additional [[Overhead (computing)|overhead]] is required to maintain [[cache coherence]] between processors and threads. 

===Self-modifying code===
Aside from the von Neumann bottleneck, program modifications can be quite harmful, either by accident or design.  In some simple stored-program computer designs, a malfunctioning program can damage itself, other programs, or the [[operating system]], possibly leading to a computer [[crash (computing)|crash]]. [[Memory protection]] and other forms of [[access control]] can usually protect against both accidental and malicious program modification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16046">'''Warp-field experiments''' are a series of current and proposed experiments to create and detect instances of [[spacetime]] warping. The ultimate goal is to prove or disprove the possibility of spacetime metric engineering with reasonable amounts of energy.

==Motivation==
[[File:Alcubierre.png|thumbnail|Visualisation of York time, a measurement of spacetime curvature as induced by the Alcubierre metric.]]
Spacetime metric engineering is a requirement for physically recreating solutions of general relativity such as [[Einstein–Rosen bridge]]s or the [[Alcubierre drive]]. Current experiments focus on the Alcubierre [[Metric (general relativity)|metric]] and its modifications. Alcubierre's work from 1994 implies that even if the required [[exotic matter]] with [[negative energy]] densities can be created, the total mass–energy demand for his proposed warp drive would exceed anything that could be realistically attained by human technology. Other researchers aimed to improve the energy efficiency (see [[Alcubierre drive#Difficulties|Alcubierre drive: Difficulties]]), however the propositions remain mostly speculative. Research groups at NASA's Johnsons Space Center and [[Dakota State University]] currently aim to experimentally evaluate several new approaches, especially a redesigned energy-density topology as well as an implication of [[brane cosmology]] theory.&lt;ref name="2013SSC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="STAIF" /&gt; If space actually were to be embedded in higher dimensions, the energy requirements could be decreased dramatically and a comparatively small energy density could already lead to a [[spacetime curvature]] measurable using an interferometer.&lt;ref name="WFM 102"&gt;{{cite web| last=White, Harold| title=Warp Field Mechanics 102: Energy Optimization| url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20130011213| publisher=[[NASA Johnson Space Center]]|date=January 2013|accessdate=2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical framework for the experiments dates back to work by [[Harold G. White]] from 2003 as well as work by White and Eric W. Davis from 2006 that was published in the [[American Institute of Physics|AIP]], where they also consider how [[baryon]]ic matter could, at least mathematically, adopt characteristics of [[dark energy]] (see section below). In the process, they described how a toroidal positive energy density may result in a spherical negative-pressure region, possibly eliminating the need for actual exotic matter.&lt;ref name="STAIF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="White101"&gt;{{cite web| last= Harold “Sonny” White| title=Warp Field Mechanics 101| url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110015936_2011016932.pdf| publisher=NASA Johnson Space Center| date=2011-09-30| accessdate=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical framework==
The metric derived by [[Alcubierre drive|Alcubierre]] was mathematically motivated by [[cosmological inflation]]. The original "warp-drive" spacetime metric can be written in (t,x,y,z) coordinates as:

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = -c dt^2 + [dx-v_s(t)f(r_s)dt]^2 +dy^2 +dz^2 &lt;/math&gt;

It uses the curve ([[world line]]) &lt;math&gt;x=x_s(t),y=0,z=0&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x_s&lt;/math&gt; expresses the x-coordinate position of the moving spaceship frame.

The radius &lt;math&gt;r_s=[(x-x_s(t))^2+y^2+z^2]&lt;/math&gt; is the euclidean distance from the curve. Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light and &lt;math&gt;v_s(t)&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;dx_s/dt&lt;/math&gt;, the velocity associated with the curve.

The shaping function &lt;math&gt;f(r_s)&lt;/math&gt; is any smooth function that satisfies &lt;math&gt;f(0)=1&lt;/math&gt; and decreases from the origin, vanishing at &lt;math&gt;r_s&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; for some point &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

The driving phenomenon behind the apparently arbitrary velocity (including &lt;math&gt;v_s&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;) could be (and was) postulated to be the York extrinsic time, &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt;, defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;\Theta=\frac{v_s}{c}\frac{x-x_s}{r_s}\frac{df}{dr_s}&lt;/math&gt;
It provides for the contraction of space in front, and expansion in the back of the warp bubble. The idea can be seen in some way as an applied extension of the hypothesis that the early universe also saw a rapid inflationary expansion that possibly exceeded the speed of light for some time. However, according to research,&lt;ref name="STAIF" /&gt; it appears that the York time behaviour is merely a side effect of another underlying mechanism. The problem that led to the assumption that York time is only one part in the larger picture is the unusual symmetry in the required energy density. Using the [[Einstein field equations]], the stress energy tensor  &lt;math&gt; T^{\mu\nu} &lt;/math&gt; can be derived from the Alcubierre metric, resulting in the necessary energy density:

[[File:Alcubierre energy density.GIF|thumb|right|The energy-density distribution around the x-axis derived from the [[Einstein field equations|EFE]]]]
:&lt;math&gt;T^{00}=-\left(\frac{c^4}{8\pi G}\right)\left[\frac{v_s^2(t)\rho^2}{4r_s^2c^2}\right]\left(\frac{df}{dr_s}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\rho=\sqrt{y^2+z^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

This corresponds to a negative toroidal energy density symmetric to the x-axis. It is notable here, that during a sensitivity analysis for the [[DARPA]]-funded [[100 Year Starship]] symposium, Harold White discovered that changing the energy-density distribution from a thin ring as originally proposed to more of a doughnut shape (effectively increasing the warp-bubble wall thickness) can decrease the required total negative energy by several orders of magnitude.

The symmetry in the energy distribution leads to the scenario in which the choice of positive x-axis is in fact arbitrary. The warp-drive mechanism would not know whether to go forward or backward along the x-axis. This paradox can be resolved by putting the Alcubierre metric into canonical form using Rindler's method and extracting the potential, &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;. With the potential it is possible to derive the field equation for the spacetime expansion "boost", &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name="White101" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WhiteStEng" /&gt;
[[File:Spacetime expansion boost.jpg|thumb|right|Cross-section of the boost topology throughout the sphere]]
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma=\cosh\left[\frac{1}{2}c^2\left(\ln\left|1-\left(\frac{v_s}{c}\right)^2f(r_s)\right|\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
The boost can roughly be seen as a scalar multiplier acting on an initial velocity leading to the actual warp-velocity:
:&lt;math&gt;v_s=\gamma \cdot v_{ini}&lt;/math&gt;
This boost is also an important analogy when considering higher-dimensional models (as seen below).
The expansion and contraction of space as measured by York time are now more of a secondary effect and can be considered equivalent to a pressure gradient of a moving sphere in a fluid. The scalar nature of the effect is an important clue when considering higher dimensions.
Considering the [[Geodesics in general relativity|null geodesics]] for &lt;math&gt;v_s&gt;c &lt;/math&gt; inside the warp field, it can be seen that the world lines are space-like for external observers, but the moving frame never travels outside its local comoving light cone and thus does not violate special relativity.&lt;ref name="STAIF" /&gt;

From there on, White and Davis showed similarities of the spacetime boost when considered in a higher-dimensional spacetime, such as in the Chung-Freese model. In this particular model our space exists on a [[Brane cosmology|brane]] and the space surrounding the brane is called the "bulk". The size of each extra dimension is considered to be at least finite and the latest research at CERN also constrains any large extra dimension theories.&lt;ref name="CERN" /&gt; However, the actual size and total number of extra dimensions is not important when considering the implications on the boost field. The modified [[Robertson–Walker metric]] representing the model by Chung and Freese is:&lt;ref name="Chung Freese Model" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2=-c^2dt^2+\frac{a(t)^2}{e^{2kU}}dX^2+dU^2&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;dX^2&lt;/math&gt; term specifies our normal space and &lt;math&gt;dU^2&lt;/math&gt; the higher-dimensional bulk with our space located at the &lt;math&gt;U=0&lt;/math&gt; plane.

&lt;math&gt;a(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a typical cosmological expansion parameter (see [[accelerated expansion]]) and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary compactification factor for the extra dimensions. Considering the null geodesic solutions ( ds²=0 ) allows to develop the following relationship:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dX}{dt}=\frac{ce^{kU}}{a(t)}\sqrt{1-\frac{dU^2}{c^2dt^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
For zero &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; the expected speed of the photon is c, as expected. For large off-bulk coordinates &lt;math&gt;U&gt;&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; the speed &lt;math&gt;\frac{dX}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; can be made arbitrarily large.

That means that light rays could have a spacelike appearance, an obvious parallel to the Alcubierre model. However, in the Alcubierre model the spacetime expansion boost is the driving phenomenon, whereas in the Chung–Freese model the off-brane bulk location U serves this purpose. It is thus theoretically possible that the boost of a 3+1 spacetime model is a scalar correction factor for higher-dimensional geometric effects on our brane, leading the following analogies to Alcubierre's model:

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma\approx e^U&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi\approx U&lt;/math&gt;  and thus &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\Phi}{dt}\approx \frac{dU}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

If a particle like an electron gains a high spacetime boost relative to an observer, it might actually leave the 3+1 brane (i.e. it gains non-zero U bulk coordinates) and its ability to interact electromagnetically diminishes. To illustrate this, White and Davis stated that in a 2D lab located at the x,y plane, a 2D electron that gets accelerated (obtains a high boost) gains a non-zero z coordinate. Thus, if a photon were to interact with it, it would need to be at the same (t,x,y,z) coordinate.

Considering the null geodesic equation again, one can see that if dU/dt=c, dX/dt=0 meaning that light comes to a standstill. This implies that a high hyperspace velocity reduces spacetime's "stiffness" or ability to resist being curved by energy, effectively reducing the energy requirements to warp it. This observation, together with the modified energy density distribution, first led researchers at NASA to begin thinking of testbeds to verify the new theoretical approach. Using the analogy between U and &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;, it is obvious that a high velocity (dU/dt) with U=0 requires a field oscillation.

Back in the Alcubierre model, it is notable that an outside observer would perceive a uniform potential (from the uniform boost within the sphere) that represents the warp-field region even though it originates from a toroidal energy density. It has similar characteristics as a  [[Gaussian surface|Gaussian spherical surface]] held at constant electrostatic potential. To the outside observer, the warp-field sphere has a uniform energy density. By expanding the spherical region while maintaining the same relative boost value for the Gaussian surface, when considering the [[first law of thermodynamics]], the following can be concluded (limited to the 3+1 brane):
:&lt;math&gt;dE=-p_sdV&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;dE&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced by &lt;math&gt;\rho_sdV&lt;/math&gt;, which is the total energy for the warp sphere with the same volume change &lt;math&gt;dV&lt;/math&gt; as on the right side of the equation.

Thus, the equation of state relating the pressure of the warp sphere &lt;math&gt;p_s&lt;/math&gt; to its energy density &lt;math&gt;\rho_s&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_s=-p_s&lt;/math&gt;
which noticeably resembles the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] of cosmological vacuum energy (moreover, it is the equation of state of dark energy). If &lt;math&gt;\rho_s&lt;/math&gt; of the original warp sphere is negative, &lt;math&gt;p_s&lt;/math&gt; would be positive. However the last equation shows that the opposite is true, &lt;math&gt;\rho_s&lt;/math&gt; is positive and &lt;math&gt;p_s&lt;/math&gt; is negative. Considering that the spacetime expansion boost for the Alcubierre model can be made arbitrarily high depending on the choice of input variables, a high boost is thereby clearly not an exclusive feature common only to negative energy densities and could be obtained in the lab, provided powerful enough equipment.&lt;ref name="STAIF" /&gt;

==Difficulties==

Einstein's field equations show that comparatively high amounts of energy are required for any significant curvature of spacetime under ordinary conditions. With the energy-requirement-decreasing concepts only being partially implemented yet, the available measurement methods are reaching the limits of what is technically possible. That is why current results remain mostly inconclusive until measurements can be further refined or the effect can be increased. New experimental setups have been proposed to boost sensitivity, and using the higher-dimensional yet still purely theoretical approach may increase any effect sufficiently to obtain significant results to prove or disprove the theory.

The only reported warp-field experiment currently being conducted is on a modified Michelson–Morley [[Interferometry|interferometer]] as proposed by Harold White and Eric Davis in 2003. This setup includes a ring-shaped energy device using high-voltage [[barium titanate|barium-titanate]] [[Capacitor|ceramic capacitors]] to attempt to warp space as shown in the diagram. White announced at a 2013 space conference that the first experimental results from this device were inconclusive.&lt;ref name="2013SSC" /&gt;

A '''washing mitt''' is a piece of [[Terrycloth|terry cloth]], shaped like a pouch that the [[hand]] fits in. It is used as an aid in washing the body, for example, to apply [[soap]] to the body, and to remove the soap with a rinsed out washing mitt. It can also be used to freshen up the face. Usually, a  [[towel]] is used to dry off the body afterwards.

A washing mitt is especially useful for people that like to wash themselves at a [[sink]], and do not wish to spill or waste much water.
The washing mitt is also a good tool for nurses and caregivers, who wash their patients in their beds.
An expansion on the washing mitt is the [[showercloth]], with which also the back can be washed.
There are also special [[Sponge (material)|sponges]] which can be used in the shower, or in the bathtub, in combination with a [[shower gel]]. 

In the case of bruises or injuries, a washing mitt can be filled with [[ice]], so that it can be used as an ice bag.

Washing mitts are mostly used in [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Iran]], [[Korea]] and [[The Netherlands]]. Wash cloths are commonly used in Korea both at home and within their public bathhouses. These are famous for being frequently used in public baths in Iran and being the nickname of second football team in there, Esteghlal, as both are common in blue color.  In the rest of the world, [[Washcloth|wash cloths]] are in wider use.{{citation needed|reason=|date=October 2015}}

An alternative name for the washing mitt is ''washglove''.

'''We are fed up!''' ('''''Wir haben es satt!''''') is the theme of a series of demonstrations in [[Germany]] against [[industrial livestock production]] and for more sustainable farming. The biggest demonstrations take place every year in [[Berlin]] since 2011&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.de/protesters-in-berlin-call-for-an-end-to-factory-farming/a-14780207-1 Deutsche Welle, ''Protesters in Berlin call for an end to factory farming'', 22 January 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; and attract up to 30,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/29/farmageddon-cost-cheap-meat-lymbery-review|title=Farmageddon: The True Cost of Cheap Meat by Philip Lymbery – review|author=Tristram Stuart|work=the Guardian|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/stopping-starvation-everyone-can-do-something/a-17155293|title=Stopping starvation: ′Everyone can do something′ - Germany - DW.COM - 14.10.2013|work=DW.COM|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shefali Sharma, [http://www.iatp.org/blog/201401/germans-speaking-out-against-industrial-meat-and-agriculture "Germans speaking out against industrial meat and agriculture"], Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, 9 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 120 different groups, which represent farmers, companies, and environmental rights and animal rights activists organize and sustain the demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/berlin-protests-focus-on-farming-and-food-safety-1.1316948|title=Berlin protests focus on farming and food safety|date=21 January 2013|publisher=|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wir-haben-es-satt.de/start/netzwerk/traegerinnen/ Wir haben es satt!], website of the organizers (German)&lt;/ref&gt; The protests take place parallel to the [[Berlin International Green Week]].

==Overview==
Independent from the protests in Berlin, demonstrations under a similar theme occurred in [[Amsterdam]] in 2012 and 2013. The event in the Netherlands was called ''we zijn het MEGA zat'', which translates to "we are MEGA fed up" and is a reference to the scale of industrial livestock farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wezijnhetmegazat.nl/|title=We zijn het mega zat!!|work=We zijn het mega zat!!|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sp.nl/milieu/nieuwsberichten/11533/120309-manifestatie_we_zijn_mega_zat_ondersteund_door_sp.html SP, ''Manifestatie 'We zijn het mega-zat' ondersteund door SP'', 9 March 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvDA]], [http://www.pvda.nl/berichten/2012/03/Actie-Mega-Zat ''Kom naar actie tegen megastal'', 12.

[[File:White spirit.JPG|right|thumb|308x308px|A {{convert|2|l|imppt|0|adj=on}} container of white spirit]]
'''White spirit''' (UK)&lt;ref group=note&gt;Primarily in the United Kingdom. In Australia and New Zealand "white spirit" can also refer to [[Coleman fuel]] ([[white gas]]).&lt;/ref&gt; or '''mineral spirits''' (US, Canada), also known as '''mineral turpentine''' (AU/NZ), '''turpentine substitute''', '''petroleum spirits''', '''solvent naphtha (petroleum)''', '''Varsol''', '''Stoddard solvent''', or, generically, "[[paint thinner]]", is a petroleum-derived clear liquid used as a common organic [[solvent]] in painting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc187.htm|title=White spirit (EHC 187, 1996)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.inchem.org|publisher=World Health Organization|orig-year=1996|publication-place=Geneva|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mixture of [[aliphatic]], [[open-chain]] or [[alicyclic]] C7 to C12 [[hydrocarbon]]s, white spirit is insoluble in water and is used as an extraction solvent, as a cleaning solvent, as a degreasing solvent and as a solvent in [[aerosol spray|aerosols]], [[paint]]s, [[wood preservation|wood preservatives]], [[lacquer]]s, [[varnish]]es, and [[asphalt]] products. In western Europe about 60% of the total white spirit consumption is used in paints, lacquers and varnishes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; White spirit is the most widely used solvent in the paint industry. In households, white spirit is commonly used to clean paint brushes after use, to clean auto parts and tools, as a starter fluid for charcoal grills, to remove adhesive residue from non-porous surfaces, and many other common tasks.

The word "mineral" in "mineral spirits" or "mineral turpentine" is meant to distinguish it from [[distilled spirits]] (distilled directly from fermented grains and fruit) or from true [[turpentine]] (distilled tree resin).

==Types and grades==
Three different types and three different grades of white spirit exist. The ''type'' refers to whether the solvent has been subjected to [[hydrodesulfurization]] (removal of sulfur) alone (type 1), solvent extraction (type 2) or [[hydrogenation]] (type 3).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/hsg/hsg/hsg103.htm|title=White spirit (HSG 103, 1996)|last=|first=|date=|year=1996|website=www.inchem.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each type comprises three grades: low flash grade, regular grade, and high flash grade (''flash'' refers to flash point). The grade is determined by the [[crude oil]] used as the starting material and the conditions of distillation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In addition there is type 0, which is defined as distillation fraction with no further treatment, consisting predominantly of saturated C9 to C12 hydrocarbons with a boiling range of 140–200&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="ECHA-RAC" /&gt;

'''Stoddard solvent''' is a specific mixture of hydrocarbons, typically &gt; 65% C10 or higher hydrocarbons,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hazard.com/msds/mf/baker/baker/files/s6588.htm|title=STODDARD SOLVENT|website=hazard.com|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed in 1924 by Atlanta [[dry cleaning|dry cleaner]] W. J. Stoddard and Lloyd E. Jackson of the [[Mellon Institute of Industrial Research]] as a less flammable petroleum-based dry cleaning solvent than the petroleum solvents then in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/757405855|title=Environmental law handbook.|date=2011|publisher=Government Institutes|others=Sullivan, Thomas F. P., Bell, Christopher L.|isbn=9781605907253|edition=21st|location=Lanham, Md.|oclc=757405855}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drycleancoalition.org/download/drycleaning-historical_developments.pdf|title=A Chronology of Historical Developments in Drycleaning|last=|first=|date=|year=2007|website=drycleancoalition.org|publisher=State Coalition for Remediation of Drycleaners|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dry cleaners began using the result of their work in 1928 and it soon became the predominant dry cleaning solvent in the United States, until the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Publications/NFPA-Journal/2014/March-April-2014/Features/Dry-Cleaning|title=Cleaning Up the Dry Cleaning Standard|website=www.nfpa.org|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turpentine substitute''' is generally not made to a standard and can have a wider range of components than products marketed as white spirit, which is made to a standard (in the UK, [[British Standard]] BS 245, in Germany, [[DIN]] 51632).  Turpentine substitute can be used for general cleaning but is not recommended for paint thinning as it may adversely affect drying times due to the less volatile components; while it may be used for brush cleaning its heavier components may leave an oily residue.

In Australia, white spirit is normally sold under the generic name of Shellite (etymology unknown), and is composed of C6 to C10 straight alkanes, classing it as light pure naptha. It is used for fuel and cleaning.

==Use==
White Spirit is a [[Distillation|petroleum distillate]] used as a [[paint thinner]] and mild [[solvent]]. In industry, mineral spirits are used for cleaning and [[degreasing]] machine tools and parts, and in conjunction with [[cutting oil]] as a [[Threading (manufacturing)#Thread cutting|thread cutting]] and [[Reamer|reaming]] [[lubricant]].

Mineral spirits are an inexpensive [[petroleum]]-based replacement for the [[vegetable]]-based [[turpentine]]. It is commonly used as a paint thinner for oil-based [[paint]] and cleaning brushes, and as an [[organic solvent]] in other applications. Mineral turpentine is chemically very different from turpentine, which mainly consists of [[pinene]], and it has inferior solvent properties.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Stoye “Solvents” in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry2002, Wiley-VCH, Wienheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a24_437}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2012}} Artists use mineral spirits as an alternative to turpentine since it is less flammable and less toxic. Because of interactions with pigments in [[oil painting|oil paints]], artists require a higher grade of mineral spirits than many industrial users, including the complete absence of residual sulfur.

Mineral spirits were formerly an active ingredient in the laundry soap ''[[Fels Naptha]]'', used to dissolve oils and grease in laundry stains, and as a popular remedy for eliminating the contagious oil [[urushiol]] in [[poison ivy]].  It was removed as a potential health risk.

Mineral spirits have a characteristic unpleasant [[kerosene]]-like odor. Chemical manufacturers have developed a low odor version of mineral turpentine which contains less of the highly volatile shorter hydrocarbons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Mineral Turpentine (Low Odour) Product Sheet | accessdate = 2011-04-30 | url = http://www.recochem.com.au/files/downloads/Cons_Mineral_Turpentine_Low_Odour_PDS_Apr11.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Odorless mineral spirits''' are mineral spirits that have been further refined to remove the more toxic [[aromaticity|aromatic compounds]], and are recommended for applications such as oil painting, where humans have close contact with the solvent.

In [[screen printing]] (also referred to as silk-screening), mineral spirits are often used to clean and unclog screens after printing with oil-based textile and [[plastisol]] inks. They are also used to thin inks used in making [[monoprint]]s.

Mineral spirits are often used inside [[Compass#Modern compasses|liquid-filled compasses]] and [[Gauge (instrument)|gauges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Prince of Guides|journal=Boating Magazine|date=September 2004|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mineral spirits are also used for re-gripping golf clubs.  After the old grip is removed, the mineral spirits are poured into the new grip and shaken.  After the mineral spirits are poured on, the new underlying tape and the new grip are slid on.  After an hour of drying out, the new grip and club are ready to use.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

Although not normally marketed as a fuel, white spirit can be used as an alternative to kerosene in [[portable stove]]s, since it is merely a light grade of kerosene.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  It cannot be used as an alternative to [[white gas]], which is a much more volatile gasoline-like fuel.

White spirits are also a major ingredient in some popular automotive fuel/oil additives, such as [[Marvel Mystery Oil]], as they are capable of dissolving varnish and sludge buildup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = National Transportation Safety Board Incident Report | accessdate = 2012-11-11 | url = https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20020916X01610&amp;ntsbno=NYC02LA181&amp;akey=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mineral spirits are also commonly used for cutting fluid in ultraprecision lathes (commonly referred to as [[diamond turning]] machines).

==Toxicity==
White spirit is mainly classed as an [[irritation|irritant]]. It has a fairly low acute toxicity by inhalation of the vapour, dermal (touching the skin) and oral routes (ingestion). However, acute exposure can lead to central nervous system depression resulting in lack of coordination and slowed reactions. Exposure to very high concentrations in enclosed spaces can lead to general [[narcotic]] effects (drowsiness, dizziness, nausea etc...) and can eventually lead to unconsciousness. Oral ingestion presents a high [[pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]] hazard. Prolonged or repeated skin exposure over a long period of time can result in severe irritant [[dermatitis]], also called [[contact dermatitis]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Exposure to white spirit in direct contact with the skin for several hours can cause severe [[chemical burns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2051479/Businesswoman-suffered-slow-agonising-death-chemical-burns-doused-white-spirits-sleeping-married-man.html | work=Daily Mail | first=Andy | last=Dolan | title=Businesswoman took five months to die from chemical burns after 'being doused in white spirits for sleeping with the chef' | location=London | date=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure to an average white spirit concentration of 240&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (40&amp;nbsp;ppm) for more than 13 years (of continuous exposure time) can lead to chronic [[central nervous system]] effects. Similar long-term studies have been made in which some of the observed effects included [[Amnesia|memory impairment]], poor concentration, increased [[irritability]] etc. White spirit is implicated in the development of [[Chronic solvent-induced encephalopathy|chronic toxic encephalopathy]] (CTE) among house painters. In severe cases CTE may lead to disability and personality changes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ECHA-RAC" /&gt; These effects in painters were first studied in 1970's in Nordic studies.&lt;ref name="ECHA-RAC" /&gt;

Owing to the volatility and low bioavailability of its constituents, white spirit, although it is moderately toxic to aquatic organisms, is unlikely to present significant hazards to the environment. It should not however, be purposely poured down the sink or freshwater drain.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

People can be exposed to Stoddard solvent in the workplace by breathing it in, swallowing it, skin contact, and eye contact. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the legal limit ([[Permissible exposure limit]]) for Stoddard solvent exposure in the workplace as 500 ppm (2900&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[Recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 350&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over an 8-hour workday and 1800&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over 15 minutes. At levels of 20,000&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, Stoddard solvent is [[IDLH|immediately dangerous to life and health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards - Stoddard solvent|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0569.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wink''' is a brand of software and hardware products that connects with and controls smart home devices from a consolidated user interface. Wink, Labs Inc., which develops and markets Wink, was founded in 2014 as a spin-off from invention incubator [[Quirky (company)|Quirky]]. After Quirky went through bankruptcy proceedings, it sold Wink to [[Flextronics|Flex]] in 2015. As of 2016, the Wink software is connected to 1.3 million devices. In July 2017, Flex sold Wink to [[i.am+]] for $38.7M.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/27/i-am-buys-wink-the-smart-home-hub-previously-owned-by-flextronics/|title=i.am+ buys Wink, the smart home hub formerly owned by Flex and Quirky|last=Lunden|first=Ingrid|date=27 July 2017|work=TechCrunch|access-date=4 August 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate history==
Wink, Labs Inc. was founded at Quirky, an incubator program for inventions that relies on crowd-sourced product ideas. Wink, Labs was originally created as part of a collaboration with [[General Electric]] to control co-branded smart home products like air-conditioners.&lt;ref name="lohr2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="popper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rhodes" /&gt; It was founded by current CTO Nathan Smith&lt;ref name="ruth" /&gt; and received about $20 million in funding.&lt;ref name="higginbotham2" /&gt; The company spent twelve months working with fifteen electronics manufacturing companies to offer about 60 Wink-compatible products by July 2014.&lt;ref name="lohr2"/&gt; Wink was spun-off from Quirky in June 2014.&lt;ref name="lohr2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kelly" /&gt;

According to Quirky, Wink products were in 300,000 homes by 2015.&lt;ref name="Higginbotham 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Higginbotham | first=Stacey | title=Quirky’s CEO: Quirky is out of money and needs to find funds for itself and Wink | website=Fortune | date=July 15, 2015 | url=http://fortune.com/2015/07/15/kaufman-quirky-wink/ | accessdate=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015 Wink experienced a security problem that made many of its hubs go offline or break, forcing the company to issue a recall. The recall caused a several-month inventory backlog and subsequent shortage of the Wink hub.&lt;ref name="primack" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lawler" /&gt; Due to financial difficulties, due in part to the recall, Quirky began looking for buyers to sell Wink to in 2015. That November, after Quirky went through bankruptcy proceedings, it sold Wink for $15 million to [[Flextronics]] (now called Flex), to whom Quirky owed $18.7 million. Flex was Wink's primary supplier of [[firmware]] and [[Electronic hardware|hardware]].&lt;ref name="kastrenakes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="palenchar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lohr" /&gt; As of 2016, 1.3 million devices are connected to Wink.&lt;ref name="Kastrenakes 2016"&gt;{{cite news | last=Kastrenakes | first=Jacob | title=Wink opens up about surviving the fall of Quirky | website=The Verge | date=April 1, 2016 | url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/1/11343686/wink-talks-surviving-quirkys-fall-and-move-to-flex | accessdate=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 July 2017, in its First Quarter Report, Flex announced&lt;ref name="mrtgrady1" /&gt; that it has sold its interest in Wink for $59 million, representing a $38.7 million gain on the balance sheet.  Although the Report described the purchaser as "an unrelated third-party venture backed company", stories circulated in the technology press identifying the purchaser as [[i.am+]],&lt;ref name="mrtgrady2" /&gt; the technology firm founded by the performer [[Will.i.am]].

The mobile app is free, while consumers pay for a Wink Hub, or Wink Relay, which connects with smart devices in the home.&lt;ref name="Crist 2014"/&gt; The hubs integrate with competing software standards used by different manufacturers.&lt;ref name="ruth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kastrenakes" /&gt; Wink integrates with software from automated home device brands, such as Canary, which markets an app-controlled home system.&lt;ref name="ruth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="higginbotham" /&gt; In February 2016, new features were introduced to allow Wink to operate on the local network, in case a user's internet connection is down.&lt;ref name="Oswald 2016"&gt;{{cite news | last=Oswald | first=Ed | title=Wink turns on local control for connected light switches, bulbs | website=TechHive | date=February 10, 2016 | url=http://www.techhive.com/article/3031251/hubs-controllers/wink-turns-on-local-control-for-connected-light-switches-bulbs.html | accessdate=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, compatibility with [[Uber (company)|Uber]], [[Fitbit]], and [[IFTTT]], was added to the Relay product.&lt;ref name="Crist 2016"&gt;{{cite news | last=Crist | first=Ry | title=The Wink Relay smart switch adds support for Uber, Fitbit and IFTTT | website=CNET | date=June 28, 2016 | url=http://www.cnet.com/news/the-wink-relay-smart-switch-adds-support-for-uber-fitbit-and-ifttt/ | accessdate=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second generation version of the Wink Hub was released in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heater|first1=Brian|title=Wink’s smart home hub gets some key upgrades for its second generation|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/27/wink-2/|accessdate=27 September 2016|work=[[TechCrunch]]|date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second generation Wink Hub supports most smart home devices with Zigbee, ZWave, [[Lutron]] Clear Connect, and Kidde protocols. Wink 2 also added Bluetooth Low Energy, 5&amp;nbsp;GHz Wi-Fi radio, an Ethernet port, and 512MB of memory.&lt;ref name="Delaney 2016"&gt;{{cite news | last=Delaney | first=John | title=Wink Hub 2 | newspaper=PC Magazine | date=October 20, 2016 | url=https://www.pcmag.com/review/348172/wink-hub-2 | accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, the Wink Lookout home security system was announced, consisting of open/close sensors, motion sensors, a siren, and the Wink hub.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/10/25/199-wink-lookout-home-security-pack/|title=$199 Wink Lookout Home Security Pack Bundles All-Wink Products for the First Time|last=Hardwick|first=Tim|date=25 October 2017|website=Mac Rumors|access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In a 2014 competitive review comparing Wink to [[SmartThings]], [[CNET]] said Wink was cheaper and supported more wireless standards, but had fewer and less reliable sensors to support automation. The article recommended SmartThings for tech-savvy users and Wink for general consumers.&lt;ref name="Crist 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Crist | first=Ry | title=Smart-home showdown: SmartThings vs. Wink | website=CNET | date=November 12, 2014 | url=http://www.cnet.com/news/smart-home-showdown-wink-vs-smartthings/ | accessdate=May 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an August 2014 review, CNET gave Wink a 7.7 score out of 10. It complimented the product for being close to the "ideal" whole-home security and automation service, but lamented that it wasn't "a perfect replacement for some of the more sophisticated standalone smart home device apps."&lt;ref name="wollerton" /&gt; A January 2015 review of Wink by [[Tom's Hardware|Tom's Guide]] rated the product a 7/10, "very good". The reviewer criticized the application for not giving as much control over individual smart home electronics as their own apps, but praised Wink for providing "an easy way for people to dip their toes into smart home systems."&lt;ref name="murphy" /&gt;

A review in ''PCMAG'' of the Wink Hub 2 said it was easy to use and compatible with many devices, but had no battery backup or USB ports.&lt;ref name="Delaney 2016"/&gt; Under "Bottom Line" the review said, "Works with virtually every wireless protocol out there and supports dual-band Wi-Fi. Installation and device pairing is quick and easy."&lt;ref name="Delaney 2016"/&gt; It gave the Hub 2 4.5 out of 5 stars and named it its new Editors' Choice for home automation hubs.&lt;ref name="Delaney 2016"/&gt; In contrast, CNET gave the device three stars. The reviewer said the device is easy to set up and compatible with many devices, but gave the reviewer error messages.&lt;ref name="Wollerton 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Wollerton | first=Megan | title=Take 2: Wink's new smart-home Hub sticks to the script | website=CNET | date=October 19, 2016 | url=https://www.cnet.com/products/wink-hub-2/review/ | accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer was never able to successfully set it up the way she wanted.&lt;ref name="Wollerton 2016"/&gt; Tom's Guide gave the Wink Hub 2 7 out of 10.&lt;ref name="Toms Guide 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=Wink Hub 2 Review: Good for Basic Smart Homes | website=Tom's Guide | date=December 8, 2016 | url=http://www.tomsguide.com/us/wink-hub-2,review-4082.html | accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also said the device was easy to use and compatible with many devices, but missing some advanced features. Tom's Guide said it was good for "basic" smart homes.&lt;ref name="Toms Guide 2016"/&gt;
