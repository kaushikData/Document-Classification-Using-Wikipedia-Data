      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5526">'''Active redundancy''' is a design concept that increases [[operational availability]] and that reduces [[operating cost]] by automating most critical maintenance actions.

This concept is related to [[condition-based maintenance]] and [[fault reporting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doni.daps.dla.mil/OPNAV.aspx|title=Opnav Instruction 4790.16: Condition Based Maintenance|publisher=US Navy Operations|access-date=2012-08-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215134909/http://doni.daps.dla.mil/OPNAV.aspx|archive-date=2013-02-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The initial requirement began with military combat systems during World War I. The approach used for survivability was to install thick armor plate to resist gun fire and install multiple guns.

This became unaffordable and impractical during the Cold War when aircraft and missile systems became common.

The new approach was to build distributed systems that continue to work when components are damaged. This depends upon very crude forms of artificial intelligence that perform reconfiguration by obeying specific rules. An example of this approach is the [[AN/UYK-43]] computer.

Formal design philosophies involving active redundancy are required for critical systems where corrective labor is undesirable or impractical to correct failure during normal operation.

Commercial aircraft are required to have multiple redundant computing systems, hydraulic systems, and propulsion systems so that a single in-flight equipment failure will not cause loss of life.

A more recent outcome of this work is the Internet, which relies on a backbone of routers that provide the ability to automatically re-routre communication without human intervention when failures occur.

Satellites placed into orbit around the earth must include massive active redundancy to ensure operation will continue for a decade or longer despite failures induced by normal failure, radiation-induced failure, and thermal shock.

This strategy now dominates space systems, aircraft, and missile systems.

== Principle ==

Maintenance requires three actions, which usually involve down time and high priority labor costs:
* Automatic fault detection
* Automatic fault isolation
* Automatic reconfiguration

Active redundancy eliminates down time and reduces manpower requirements by automating all three actions. This requires some amount of automated [[artificial intelligence]].

''N'' stands for needed equipment. The amount of excess capacity affects overall system reliability by limiting the effects of failure.

For example, if it takes two generators to power a city, then "N+1" would be three generators to allow a single failure. Similarly, "N+2" would be four generators, which would allow one generator to fail while a second generator has already failed.

Active redundancy improves [[operational availability]] as follows.

:&lt;math&gt;A_{o}^{N} = 0.99 \ Up \ Time&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;\approx failed \ 90 \ hour/year&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_{o}^{N+1} = 1 - \left( (1 - A_{o}^{N} ) \times (1 - A_{o}^{N} ) \right) = 0.9999  \ Up \ Time &lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;\approx failed \ 50 \ minutes/year&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_{o}^{N+2} = 1 - \left( (1 - A_{o}^{N} ) \times (1 - A_{o}^{N} )  \times (1 - A_{o}^{N} ) \right) = 0.999999  \ Up \ Time &lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;\approx failed \ 30 \ seconds/year &lt;/math&gt;

===Passive components===

Active redundancy in passive components requires redundant components that share the burden when failure occurs, like in cabling and piping. 

This allows forces to be redistributed across a bridge to prevent failure if a vehicle ruptures a cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.trb.org/cmsfeed/TRBNetProjectDisplay.asp?ProjectID=2716|title=Bridge System Safety and Redundancy|publisher=Transportation Research Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This allows water flow to be redistributed through pipes when a limited number of valves are shut or pumps shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwsc.org/ABOUT_BWSC/systems/water/PresentDay_water.asp|title=Water Systems|publisher=Boston Water and Sewer Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Active components===

Active redundancy in active components requires reconfiguration when failure occurs. Computer programming must recognize the failure and automatically reconfigure to restore operation. 

All modern computers provide the following when an existing feature is enabled via [[fault reporting]].
* Automatic fault detection
* Automatic fault isolation

Mechanical devices must reconfigure, such as transmission settings on hybrid vehicles that have redundant propulsion systems. The petroleum engine will start up when battery power fails.

Electrical power systems must perform two actions to prevent total system failure when smaller failures occur, such as when a tree falls across a power line. Power systems incorporate communication, switching, and automatic scheduling that allows these actions to be automated.
* Shut down the damaged power line to isolate the failure
* Adjust generator settings to prevent voltage and frequency excursions

== Benefits ==

This is the only known strategy that can achieve high availability.

== Detriments ==

This maintenance philosophy requires custom development with extra components.

}} 
In the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] or conceptual sense, '''balance''' is used to mean a point between two opposite forces that is desirable over purely one state or the other, such as a balance between the metaphysical [[Law]] and [[Randomness|Chaos]] &amp;mdash; law by itself being overly controlling, chaos being overly unmanageable, balance being the point that minimizes the negatives of both.

More recently, the term "balance" has come to refer to a balance of power between multiple opposing forces. Lack of balance (of power) is generally considered to cause aggression by stronger forces towards weaker forces less capable of defending themselves. In the real world, unbalanced stronger forces tend to portray themselves as balanced, and use media controls to downplay this, as well as prevent weaker forces from coming together to achieve a new balance of power. In constructed worlds, such as in video gaming, where nearly all-powerful corporate interests strive to maintain a balance of power among players, players tend to be extremely vocal about what they see as unbalanced mechanics, providing the unbalance negatively affects them. Though the strong and unbalanced (or "overpowered") players commonly are vigorous in denial of any lack of balance, the comparative media equality among all player brings change quickly, to further a sense of balance.

==Artistic balance==
The twentieth century saw the development of both law and chaos in art (and art-music) to the point that the end product became unintelligible at an instinctive/emotional level. Many composers saw one or other of these controlling trends as superior to the other. The truth may lie in a fundamental acceptance of balance as the controlling force in art. In time, we may even come to accept balance between structural and emotional as the essence of beauty.

==Moral balance==
In philosophy, the concept of moral balance exists in various forms, one of them is the [[golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]], which has virtue being between the extreme and the lacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/237719/Golden-Mean|title=Golden Mean (phylosophy) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek philosophers—such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and the [[Pythagoreans]] (who related moral excellence with mathematical perfection)—applied the principle to ethics as well as politics. "Nothing in excess" was one of the three phrases carved into the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] at Delphi.

In Buddhism, this concept is known as the middle way, or ''samatā'', which stated that the way to [[nirvana]] led between bodily sexual indulgence and self-mortification and [[asceticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddhisma2z.com/content.php?id=35|title=BALANCE - A Guide to Buddhism A-Z|publisher=Guide to Buddhism A-Z|accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucian teachings contain the similar [[Doctrine of the Mean|doctrine of Zhōngyōng]]; the middle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friesian.com/confuciu.htm|title=Key Passages in the Analects of Confucius|accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}} "The colours represent creative energy, and the layers of the tower imply that a conlang is built piece by piece, never completed. The tower itself also alludes to the Tower of Babel, as it has long been a tradition to demonstrate a constructed language by translating the Babel legend. The Conlang flag was decided on by a vote between many competing designs, and one of my own contributions to the conlanging world is that I was the person who facilitated this election. The winning design was drawn by Christian Thalmann, who introduced the layers. The idea of including the Tower of Babel on the flag had been introduced by Jan van Steenbergen, and the idea of placing the sun on the horizon behind it by Leland Paul. The idea of having the rising sun on the flag had been introduced by David Peterson, who saw it as representing the rise of conlanging from obscurity to popularity and notoriety."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''constructed language''' (sometimes called a '''conlang''') is a [[language]] whose [[phonology]], [[grammar]], and [[vocabulary]] are, instead of having developed [[natural language|naturally]], consciously devised for communication between intelligent beings, most commonly for use by humanoids. Constructed languages may also be referred to as '''artificial''', '''planned''' or '''invented languages'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ishtar for Belgium to Belgrade |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=554&amp;_t=ishtar_for_belgium_to_belgrade |publisher= European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases [[fictional language|fictional languages]].  There are many possible reasons to create a constructed language, such as to ease human [[communication]] (see [[international auxiliary language]] and [[code]]), to give [[fiction]] or an associated constructed setting an added layer of realism, for experimentation in the fields of [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], and [[machine learning]], for [[artistic language|artistic creation]], and for [[language game]]s. 

The expression ''planned language'' is sometimes used to indicate international auxiliary languages and other languages designed for actual use in human communication. Some prefer it to the adjective ''artificial'', as this term may be perceived as pejorative. Outside [[Esperanto culture]], the term [[language planning]] means the prescriptions given to a natural language to standardize it; in this regard, even a "natural language" may be artificial in some respects, meaning some of its words have been crafted by conscious decision. [[Linguistic prescription|Prescriptive grammar]]s, which date to ancient times for classical languages such as Latin and Sanskrit, are rule-based codifications of natural languages, such codifications being a middle ground between naïve natural selection and development of language and its explicit construction.  The term ''glossopoeia'' &lt;!--, coined by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], {see talk page; can anyone cite a use by Tolkien? Sarah Higley uses the word but does not attribute its coinage to him.}--&gt; is also used to mean language construction, particularly construction of [[artistic language]]s.&lt;ref name="higley2007"&gt;Sarah L. Higley: ''Hildegard of Bingen's Unknown Language''.  Palgrave Macmillan, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conlang speakers are rare. For example, the Hungarian census of 2001 found 4570 speakers of [[Esperanto]], 10 of [[Romanid]], two each of [[Interlingua]] and [[Ido (language)|Ido]] and one each of [[Idiom Neutral]] and [[Mundolinco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepszamlalas2001.hu/hun/kotetek/18/tables/load2_39_1.html Ethnic affiliation, attachment of cultures, languages and language systems Hungarian statistical office]&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian census of 2010 found 992 speakers of Esperanto, nine of Ido, one of Edo and no speakers of [[Slovio]] or Interlingua.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sezonoj.ru/2011/12/censo/ Russian census (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planned, constructed, artificial==
The terms "planned", "constructed", and "artificial" are used differently in some traditions. For example, few speakers of [[Interlingua]] consider their language artificial, since they assert that it has no invented content: Interlingua's vocabulary is taken from a small set of natural languages, and its grammar is based closely on these source languages, even including some degree of irregularity; its proponents prefer to describe its vocabulary and grammar as standardized rather than artificial or constructed.  Similarly, [[Latino sine flexione]] (LsF) is a simplification of Latin from which the [[inflection]]s have been removed. As with Interlingua, some prefer to describe its development as "planning" rather than "constructing". Some speakers of [[Esperanto]] and [[Esperantido]]s also avoid the term "artificial language" because they deny that there is anything "unnatural" about the use of their language in human communication.

By contrast, some philosophers have argued that all human languages are conventional or artificial. [[François Rabelais]], for instance, stated: "C'est abus de dire que nous avons une langue naturelle; les langues sont par institution arbitraires et conventions des peuples."  (''It's an abuse to say that we have a natural language; languages are arbitrary and conventions of peoples by institution.'')&lt;ref&gt;[[François Rabelais]], Œvres complètes, III, 19 (Paris: Seuil, 1973), cited in Claude Piron, ''Le Defi des Langues'' (L'Harmattan, 1994) {{ISBN|2-7384-2432-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An artificial language can also refer to a language that emerges naturally out of experimental studies within the framework of [[artificial language|artificial language evolution]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Furthermore, fictional and experimental languages can be naturalistic in that they are meant to sound natural and have realistic amounts of irregularity. If a naturalistic conlang is derived ''a posteriori'' from a real-world natural language, a real-world reconstructed [[proto-language]] (such as [[Vulgar Latin]] or [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]) or a fictional proto-language, it should imitate natural processes of [[phonology|phonological]], lexical, and [[grammar|grammatical]] change. In contrast with Interlingua, they are not usually intended for easy learning or communication, and most artlangers do not consider Interlingua to be naturalistic in the sense in which this term is used in artlang criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0908E&amp;L=CONLANG&amp;D=0&amp;T=0&amp;P=5208 "Re: "Naturalistic" for auxlangers vs artlangers?"]  AUXLANG mailing list post by Jörg Rhiemeier, 30 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a naturalistic fictional language tends to be more difficult and complex. While Interlingua has simpler grammar, syntax, and orthography than its source languages (though more complex and irregular than Esperanto or its descendants), naturalistic fictional languages typically mimic behaviors of natural languages like [[irregular verbs]] and nouns and complicated phonological processes.

==Overview==

{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}

In terms of purpose, most constructed languages can broadly be divided into:

*''[[Engineered language]]s'' (''engelangs'' {{IPA|/ˈɛnd͡ʒlæŋz/}}), further subdivided into logical languages (''loglangs''), [[philosophical language]]s and [[experimental language]]s; devised for the purpose of experimentation in [[logic]], [[philosophy]], or [[linguistics]];
*''[[International auxiliary language|Auxiliary language]]s'' (''auxlangs'') devised for international communication (also IALs, for International Auxiliary Language);
*''[[Artistic language]]s'' (''artlangs'') devised to create aesthetic pleasure or humorous effect, ''just for fun''; usually secret languages and mystical languages are classified as artlangs.

The boundaries between these categories are by no means clear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Glosso/Glossopoeia.html The "Conlang Triangle"] by Raymond Brown.  Accessed 8 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  A constructed language could easily fall into more than one of the above categories. A logical language created for [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] reasons would also be classifiable as an artistic language, which might be created by someone with philosophical motives intending for said conlang to be used as an auxiliary language. There are no rules, either inherent in the process of language construction or externally imposed, that would limit a constructed language to fitting only one of the above categories.

A constructed language can have native speakers if young children learn it from parents who speak it fluently. According to ''[[Ethnologue]]'', there are "200–2000 [[native Esperanto speakers|who speak Esperanto as a first language]]". A member of the [[Klingon Language Institute]], [[d'Armond Speers]], attempted to raise his son as a native (bilingual with English) [[Klingon language|Klingon]] speaker.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.08/mustread.html?pg=8 Gavin Edwards: ''Babble On Revisited'', Wired Magazine, Issue 7.08, August 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=March 2018}}

As soon as a constructed language has a community of fluent speakers, especially if it has numerous native speakers, it begins to evolve and hence loses its constructed status. For example, [[Modern Hebrew]] and its pronunciation norms were developed from existing traditions of [[Hebrew]], such as [[Mishnaic Hebrew]] and [[Biblical Hebrew]] following a general [[Sephardic]] pronunciation, rather than engineered from scratch, and has undergone considerable changes since the state of [[Israel]] was founded in 1948 (Hetzron 1990:693). However, linguist [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] argues that Modern Hebrew, which he terms "Israeli", is a Semito-European hybrid based not only on Hebrew but also on [[Yiddish]] and other languages spoken by revivalists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns], Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Journal of Language Contact, Varia 2, pp. 40-67 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckermann therefore endorses the translation of the Hebrew Bible into what he calls "Israeli".&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1242212397385&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Let my people know!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916161700/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1242212397385&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |date=2011-09-16 }}, Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Jerusalem Post, May 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Esperanto]] as a living spoken language has evolved significantly from the prescriptive blueprint published in 1887, so that modern editions of the ''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', a 1903 collection of early texts in the language, require many footnotes on the syntactic and lexical differences between early and modern Esperanto.&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', ed. L. L. Zamenhof, 1903; 18th edition with footnotes by Gaston Waringhien, UEA 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of constructed languages often have many reasons for using them. The famous but disputed [[linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] is sometimes cited; this claims that the language one speaks influences the way one thinks. Thus, a "better" language should allow the speaker to think more clearly or intelligently or to encompass more points of view; this was the intention of [[Suzette Haden Elgin]] in creating [[Láadan]], a feminist language&lt;ref name="foer-2012" /&gt; embodied in her [[feminist science fiction]] series ''[[Native Tongue (Suzette Haden Elgin novel)|Native Tongue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"My hypothesis was that if I constructed a language designed specifically to provide a more adequate mechanism for expressing women's perceptions, women would (a) embrace it and begin using it, or (b) embrace the idea but not the language, say "Elgin, you've got it all wrong!" and construct some other "women's language" to replace it."  {{cite web|title=Interview With Suzette Haden Elgin |last=Glatzer |first=Jenna |work= |url=http://www.absolutewrite.com/novels/suzette_haden_elgin.htm |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-03-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612005757/http://www.absolutewrite.com/novels/suzette_haden_elgin.htm |archivedate=2007-06-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A constructed language could also be used to ''restrict'' thought, as in [[George Orwell]]'s [[Newspeak]], or to ''simplify'' thought, as in [[Toki Pona]]. In contrast, linguists such as [[Steven Pinker]] argue that ideas exist independently of language. For example, in the book ''[[The Language Instinct]]'', Pinker states that children spontaneously re-invent slang and even grammar with each generation. These linguists argue that attempts to control the range of human thought through the reform of language would fail, as concepts like "freedom" will reappear in new words if the old words vanish.

Proponents claim a particular language makes it easier to express and understand concepts in one area, and more difficult in others.  An example can be taken from the way various [[programming language]]s make it easier to write certain kinds of programs and harder to write others.

Another reason cited for using a constructed language is the telescope rule, which claims that it takes less time to first learn a simple constructed language and then a natural language, than to learn only a natural language. Thus, if someone wants to learn English, some suggest learning [[Basic English]] first. Constructed languages like Esperanto and Interlingua are in fact often simpler due to the typical lack of [[regular and irregular verbs|irregular verbs]] and other grammatical quirks. Some studies have found that learning Esperanto helps in learning a non-constructed language later (see [[propaedeutic value of Esperanto]]).

[[Codes for constructed languages]] include the [[ISO 639-2]] "&lt;tt&gt;[[Codes for constructed languages|art]]&lt;/tt&gt;" for conlangs; however, some constructed languages have their own [[ISO 639]] language codes (e.g. "&lt;tt&gt;eo&lt;/tt&gt;" and "&lt;tt&gt;epo&lt;/tt&gt;" for [[Esperanto]], "jbo" for [[Lojban]], "&lt;tt&gt;ia&lt;/tt&gt;" and "&lt;tt&gt;ina&lt;/tt&gt;" for [[Interlingua]], "&lt;tt&gt;tlh&lt;/tt&gt;" for [[Klingon language|Klingon]] and "&lt;tt&gt;io&lt;/tt&gt;" and "&lt;tt&gt;ido&lt;/tt&gt;" for [[Ido (language)|Ido]]).

==''A priori'' and ''a posteriori'' languages==

{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}

An ''a priori'' constructed language is one whose features (including vocabulary, grammar, etc.) are not based on an existing language, and an ''a posteriori'' language is the opposite. This categorization, however, is not absolute, as many constructed languages may be both ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' depending on which linguistic factors of them are observed.

===''A priori'' language===

An ''a priori'' language (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''a priori'', "from the former") is any constructed language of which all or a number of features are not based on existing languages, but rather invented or elaborated as to work in a different way or to allude different purposes. Some ''a priori'' languages are designed to be [[international auxiliary language]]s that remove what could be considered an unfair learning advantage for native speakers of a source language that would otherwise exist for ''a posteriori'' languages. Others, known as [[philosophical language|philosophical]] or [[taxonomic languages]], try to categorize their vocabulary, either to express an underlying philosophy or to make it easier to recognize new vocabulary.

====Experimental====
There have been many languages constructed to test linguistic hypotheses (such as the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]]) and/or to explore innovative or invented linguistic features. They are therefore necessarily designed with ''a priori'' features. Examples include [[Ithkuil]], [[Kotava]], [[Lojban]] (and its predecessor [[Loglan]], both of which are also schematic), and even the fictional-setting [[Láadan]].

====Artistic====
Most [[artistic language]]s, i.e. those created for amusement or to serve as natural languages of fictional worlds, are largely ''a priori'' in both vocabulary and grammar. Among classical "fictional natural languages" are [[Klingon language|Klingon]] from the science-fiction franchise ''[[Star Trek]]'' and [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|the languages created]] by fantasy writer [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. Other examples include [[Dothraki]] and [[Valyrian]] from ''[[Game of Thrones]]', '[[The 100 (TV series)|Trigedasleng]] from [[The 100 (TV series)|The 100]], [[Atlantean language|Atlantean]] from ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', [[Kēlen]] by Sylvia Sotomayor and [[aUI (language)|aUI]] by W. John Weilgart. [[Láadan]] is both experimental and artistic.

===''A posteriori'' language===
An '''''a posteriori'' language''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''a posteriori'', "from the latter"), according to [[Louis Couturat]], is any constructed language whose elements are borrowed from or based on existing languages. The term can also be extended to [[controlled language|controlled versions]] of existing languages, and is most commonly used to refer to vocabulary despite other features. In distinguishing whether the language is ''a priori'' or ''a posteriori'', the prevalence and distribution of respectable traits is often the key. They may be controlled, naturalistic or schematic.

====Controlled====
A [[controlled language]] is a version of a [[natural language]] with improvements intended to make it easier to learn and to use, such as reduced vocabulary, simplified grammar, etc. These include:
*[[Latino sine flexione]]
*Controlled versions of English:
**[[Basic English]] 
**[[Special English]]
**[[Globish (Gogate)|Globish]]

====Naturalistic====
Naturalistic languages are constructed languages which largely imitate the grammar and vocabulary of a particular group of related languages within a [[language family|family]], thus being potentially [[zonal constructed language|zonal]], i.e. auxiliary between speakers of these languages.
*[[Occidental language|Occidental]] (also called Interlingue)
*[[Interlingua de IALA]]
*[[Interslavic language|Interslavic]]
*[[Folkspraak]]
*[[Lingua Franca Nova]]

===Schematic===
A constructed language is considered schematic when it features a more original grammar, which is usually precise and regular to avoid ambiguities and other obstacles to an easy study, and a vocabulary coming from languages of different families, to make it as recognizable as possible for potential [[international auxiliary language|international auxiliary]] purposes. For that they can be described as half ''a priori'', half ''a posteriori''. There have been many attempts of developing languages with these characteristics, including:
*[[Volapük]]
*[[Esperanto]] and the [[Esperantido]]s:
**[[Ido (language)|Ido]]
**[[Mundolinco]]
*[[Lojban]] (and [[Loglan]])
*[[Glosa]] (and [[Interglossa]])
*[[Lingwa de planeta]]
*[[Sambahsa]]
*[[Toki Pona]]
*[[Sona language (artificial)|Sona]]

==History==

===Ancient linguistic experiments===
Grammatical speculation dates from [[Classical Antiquity]], appearing for instance in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' in Hermogenes's contention that words are not inherently linked to what they refer to; that people apply "a piece of their own voice&amp;nbsp;... to the thing". [[Athenaeus]] of Naucratis, in Book III of [[Deipnosophistae]], tells the story of two figures: Dionysius of Sicily and Alexarchus. Dionysius of Sicily created [[neologism]]s like ''menandros'' "virgin" (from ''menei'' "waiting" and ''andra'' "husband"), ''menekratēs'' "pillar" (from ''menei'' "it remains in one place" and ''kratei'' "it is strong"), and ''ballantion'' "javelin" (from ''balletai enantion'' "thrown against someone"). Incidentally, the more common Greek words for those three are ''parthenos'', ''stulos'', and ''akon''. [[Alexarchus of Macedon]], the brother of King Cassander of Macedon, was the founder of the city of Ouranopolis. Athenaeus recounts a story told by Heracleides of Lembos that Alexarchus "introduced a peculiar vocabulary, referring to a rooster as a "dawn-crier," a barber as a "mortal-shaver," a drachma as "worked silver"...and a herald as an ''aputēs'' [from ''ēputa'' "loud-voiced"]. "He once wrote something...to the public authorities in Casandreia...As for what this letter says, in my opinion not even the [[Apollo|Pythian god]] could make sense of it." While the mechanisms of grammar suggested by classical philosophers were designed to explain existing languages ([[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Sanskrit]]), they were not used to construct new grammars. Roughly contemporary to Plato, in his descriptive grammar of Sanskrit, [[Pāṇini]] constructed a set of rules for explaining language, so that the text of his grammar may be considered a mixture of natural and constructed language.

===Early constructed languages===
[[File:68r.jpg|thumb|Page 68r of the [[Voynich manuscript]]. This three-page foldout from the manuscript includes a chart that appears astronomical.]]

A legend recorded in the seventh-century [[Irish language|Irish]] work [[Auraicept na n-Éces]] claims that [[Fénius Farsaid]] visited [[Shinar]] after the [[confusion of tongues]], and he and his scholars studied the various languages for ten years, taking the best features of each to create ''in Bérla tóbaide'' ("the selected language"), which he named [[Old Irish|''Goídelc'']]—the Irish language. This appears to be the first mention of the concept of a constructed language in literature.

The earliest non-natural languages were considered less "constructed" than "super-natural", mystical, or divinely inspired. The [[Lingua Ignota]], recorded in the 12th century by St. [[Hildegard of Bingen]] is an example, and apparently the first entirely artificial language.&lt;ref name="foer-2012"&gt;Joshua Foer, [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/12/24/121224fa_fact_foer "John Quijada and Ithkuil, the Language He Invented"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Dec. 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a form of private mystical [[cant (language)|cant]] (see also [[Enochian|language of angels]]). An important example from Middle-Eastern culture is [[Balaibalan]], invented in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="higley2007"/&gt;  [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] grammatical speculation was directed at recovering the original language spoken by [[Adam and Eve]] in [[Paradise]], lost in the [[confusion of tongues]]. The first [[Christian]] project for an ideal language is outlined in [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'', where he searches for the ideal [[Italian language|Italian]] vernacular suited for literature. [[Ramon Llull]]'s ''[[Ramon Llull#Ars generalis ultima (Ars Magna)|Ars Magna]]'' was a project of a perfect language with which the infidels could be convinced of the truth of the Christian faith. It was basically an application of [[combinatorics]] on a given set of concepts.{{Vague|date=October 2014}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} During [[the Renaissance]], Lullian and Kabbalistic ideas were drawn upon in a magical context, resulting in [[cryptography|cryptographic]] applications. The [[Voynich manuscript]] may be an example of this.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Perfecting language===
Renaissance interest in [[Ancient Egypt]], notably the discovery of the ''[[Hieroglyphica]]'' of [[Horapollo]], and first encounters with the [[Chinese script]] directed efforts towards a perfect written language. [[Johannes Trithemius]], in ''Steganographia'' and ''Polygraphia'', attempted to show how all languages can be reduced to one. In the 17th century, interest in [[Magical thinking|magical]] languages was continued by the [[Rosicrucians]] and [[Alchemy|Alchemists]] (like [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] and his [[Enochian]]). [[Jakob Boehme]] in 1623 spoke of a "natural language" (''Natursprache'') of the senses.

[[Musical language]]s from the Renaissance were tied up with [[mysticism]], magic and [[alchemy]], sometimes also referred to as the [[language of the birds]]. The [[Solresol]] project of 1817 re-invented the concept in a more pragmatic context.

===17th and 18th century: advent of philosophical languages===
The 17th century saw the rise of projects for "philosophical" or "a priori" languages, such as:

*[[Francis Lodwick]]'s ''A Common Writing'' (1647) and ''The Groundwork or Foundation laid (or So Intended) for the Framing of a New Perfect Language and a Universal Common Writing'' (1652)
* Sir [[Thomas Urquhart]]'s ''Ekskybalauron'' (1651) and ''Logopandecteision''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/urquhart/index.html|title=Logopandecteision|work=uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1652)
* [[George Dalgarno]]'s ''Ars signorum'', 1661
* [[John Wilkins]]' ''Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language'', 1668

These early taxonomic conlangs produced systems of hierarchical classification that were intended to result in both spoken and written expression.  [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] had a similar purpose for his ''lingua generalis'' of 1678, aiming at a lexicon of characters upon which the user might perform calculations that would yield true propositions automatically, as a side-effect developing [[binary calculus]]. These projects were not only occupied with reducing or modelling grammar, but also with the arrangement of all human knowledge into "characters" or hierarchies, an idea that with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] would ultimately lead to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''.  Many of these 17th−18th centuries conlangs were [[Pasigraphy|pasigraphies]], or purely written languages with no spoken form or a spoken form that would vary greatly according to the native language of the reader.&lt;ref name="einstein1884"&gt;[[Leopold Einstein]], "Al la historio de la Provoj de Lingvoj Tutmondaj de Leibnitz ĝis la Nuna Tempo", 1884.  Reprinted in ''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', UEA 1992 [1903].&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibniz and the encyclopedists realized that it is impossible to organize human knowledge unequivocally in a tree diagram, and consequently to construct an ''a priori'' language based on such a classification of concepts. Under the entry ''Charactère'', [[D'Alembert]] critically reviewed the projects of philosophical languages of the preceding century. After the ''Encyclopédie'', projects for ''a priori'' languages moved more and more to the lunatic fringe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Individual authors, typically unaware of the history of the idea, continued to propose taxonomic philosophical languages until the early 20th century (e.g. [[Ro (language)|Ro]]), but most recent [[engineered language]]s have had more modest goals; some are limited to a specific field, like mathematical formalism or calculus (e.g. [[Lincos (artificial language)|Lincos]] and [[programming language]]s), others are designed for eliminating syntactical ambiguity (e.g., [[Loglan]] and [[Lojban]]) or maximizing conciseness (e.g., [[Ithkuil]]&lt;ref name="foer-2012" /&gt;).

===19th and 20th centuries: auxiliary languages===
{{main article|International auxiliary language}}
Already in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' attention began to focus on ''a posteriori'' auxiliary languages. [[Joachim Faiguet de Villeneuve]] in the article on ''Langue'' wrote a short proposition of a "laconic" or regularized grammar of [[French (language)|French]]. During the 19th century, a bewildering variety of such International Auxiliary Languages (IALs) were proposed, so that [[Louis Couturat]] and [[Léopold Leau]] in ''Histoire de la langue universelle'' (1903) reviewed 38 projects.

The first of these that made any international impact was [[Volapük]], proposed in 1879 by [[Johann Martin Schleyer]]; within a decade, 283 Volapükist clubs were counted all over the globe. However, disagreements between Schleyer and some prominent users of the language led to schism, and by the mid-1890s it fell into obscurity, making way for [[Esperanto]], proposed in 1887 by [[L. L. Zamenhof|Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof]], and its [[Esperantido|descendants]].  [[Interlingua]], the most recent auxlang to gain a significant number of speakers, emerged in 1951, when the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] published its [[Interlingua–English Dictionary]] and an accompanying [[Interlingua: A Grammar of the International Language|grammar]]. The success of Esperanto did not stop others from trying to construct new auxiliary languages, such as Leslie Jones' [[Eurolengo]], which mixes elements of English and Spanish.

[[Loglan]] (1955) and its descendants constitute a pragmatic return to the aims of the ''a priori'' languages, tempered by the requirement of usability of an auxiliary language. Thus far, these modern ''a priori'' languages have garnered only small groups of speakers.

[[Robot Interaction Language]] (2010) is a spoken language that is optimized for communication between machines and humans. The major goals of ROILA are that it should be easily learnable by the human user, and optimized for efficient recognition by computer [[speech recognition]] algorithms.

===Artlangs===
{{main article|Artistic language}}
Language can be artistic to the extent that artists use language as a source of creativity in art, poetry, calligraphy or as a metaphor to address themes as cultural diversity and the vulnerability of the individual in a globalizing world. 

Some people prefer however to take pleasure in constructing, crafting a language by a conscious decision for reasons of literary enjoyment or aesthetic reasons without any claim of usefulness. Such [[Artistic language|artistic languages]] begin to appear in Early Modern literature (in [[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel]], and in [[Utopia]]n contexts), but they only seem to gain notability as serious projects beginning in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="higley2007" /&gt;  ''[[A Princess of Mars]]'' (1912) by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] was possibly the first fiction of that century to feature a constructed language. [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] developed a family of related fictional languages and discussed artistic languages publicly, giving a lecture entitled "''[[A Secret Vice]]''" in 1931 at a congress. (Orwell's Newspeak is considered a satire of an [[International auxiliary language|IAL]] rather than an artistic language proper.)

By the beginning of the first decade of the 21st century, it had become common for science-fiction and fantasy works set in other worlds to feature constructed languages, or more commonly, an extremely limited but defined vocabulary which ''suggests'' the existence of a complete language, and constructed languages are a regular part of the genre, appearing in ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Lord of the Rings]] ([[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish]])'', ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', ''[[Game of Thrones]] ([[Dothraki language]] and [[Valyrian languages]])'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' and the ''[[Myst]]'' series of computer adventure games.

==Modern conlang organizations==
Various paper zines on constructed languages were published from the 1970s through the 1990s, such as ''Glossopoeic Quarterly'', ''Taboo Jadoo'', and ''The Journal of Planned Languages''.&lt;ref name="rosta2007"&gt;[http://archives.conlang.info/ge/bhaelvhua/vhurtaethuan.html "How did you find out that there were other conlangers?"] Conlang list posting by And Rosta, 14 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
The Conlang Mailing List was founded in 1991, and later split off an AUXLANG mailing list dedicated to international auxiliary languages. &lt;!-- to do: find exact date of Conlang/Auxlang split --&gt;  In the early to mid-1990s a few conlang-related zines were published as email or websites, such as ''Vortpunoj''&lt;ref name="vortpunoj"&gt;[http://revo.bierfaristo.com/vortpunoj.html Archives of ''Vortpunoj''] at Steve Brewer's website&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Model Languages''.  The Conlang mailing list has developed a community of [[List of language inventors|conlangers]] with its own customs, such as translation challenges and [[translation relay]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.media-culture.org.au/0003/languages.php Audience, Uglossia, and Conlang: Inventing Languages on the Internet] by Sarah L. Higley. M/C: A Journal of Media and Culture 3.1 (2000). ({{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050616085932/http://journal.media-culture.org.au/0003/languages.php |date=June 16, 2005 }}, media-culture.org.au site sometimes has problems.)&lt;/ref&gt; and its own terminology.  Sarah Higley reports from results of her surveys that the demographics of the Conlang list are primarily men from North America and western Europe, with a smaller number from Oceania, Asia, the Middle East, and South America, with an age range from thirteen to over sixty; the number of women participating has increased over time.

More recently founded online communities include the [[Zompist]] Bulletin Board (ZBB; since 2001) and the Conlanger Bulletin Board.  Discussion on these forums includes presentation of members' conlangs and feedback from other members, discussion of natural languages, whether particular conlang features have natural language precedents, and how interesting features of natural languages can be repurposed for conlangs, posting of interesting short texts as translation challenges, and meta-discussion about the philosophy of conlanging, conlangers' purposes, and whether conlanging is an art or a hobby.&lt;ref name="higley2007"/&gt;  Another 2001 survey by Patrick Jarrett showed an average age of 30.65, with the average time since starting to invent languages 11.83 years.&lt;ref name="jarrett2001"&gt;[http://archives.conlang.info/bhe/gherque/chivirchein.html "Update mailing list statistics—FINAL"], Conlang list posting by Patrick Jarrett, 13 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent thread on the ZBB showed that many conlangers spend a relatively small amount of time on any one conlang, moving from one project to another; about a third spend years on developing the same language.&lt;ref name="avg_age"&gt;[http://www.spinnoff.com/zbb/viewtopic.php?t=28831 "Average life of a conlang"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614035040/http://www.spinnoff.com/zbb/viewtopic.php?t=28831 |date=2011-06-14 }} thread on Zompist Bulletin Board, 15 August 2008; accessed 26 August 2008.&lt;br/&gt;[http://archives.conlang.info/wu/seifi/phirqondal.html "Average life of a conlang"] thread on Conlang mailing list, 27 August 2008 (should be archived more persistently than the ZBB thread)&lt;/ref&gt;{{portal|Constructed languages}}

{{Anti-consumerism |Theories}}
[[Advertising]] is a form of [[communication]] intended to [[persuade]] an audience to purchase products, ideals or services. While advertising can be seen as necessary for [[economic growth]], it is not without [[social cost]]s. [[E-mail spam|Unsolicited commercial email]] and other forms of [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] have become so prevalent that they are a major nuisance to internet users, as well as being a financial burden on [[internet service provider]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/03/03/1528247&amp;tid=111 |title=Slashdot &amp;#124; ISP Operator Barry Shein Answers Spam Questions |publisher=interviews.slashdot.org |date=2003-03-03 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising increasingly invades public spaces, such as schools, which some critics argue is a form of child exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/marketing/marketers_target_kids.cfm |title=How Marketers Target Kids |publisher=Media-awareness.ca |date=2009-02-13 |accessdate=2009-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416200521/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/marketing/marketers_target_kids.cfm |archivedate=2009-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising frequently uses psychological pressure (for example, appealing to feelings of inadequacy) on the intended consumer, which may be harmful. As a result of these criticisms, the advertising industry has seen low approval rates in surveys and negative cultural portrayals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Andrew C.|last2=Dromi|first2=Shai M.|title=Advertising morality: maintaining moral worth in a stigmatized profession|journal=Theory &amp; Society|volume=47|issue=2|pages=175–206|doi=10.1007/s11186-018-9309-7|url=https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s11186-018-9309-7?author_access_token=7NqWYsAc_xBowppAv-q8mve4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY6AEWVv2PLqubmhfuYTCeD-V3SRQ6CfZmxJResEGYJBsoZEDraaO2K-ltnWj2TVPmZ7jDY7bNZ5z2Kbuu8SoXhAHCzJkdSEdHAdS5s0BzfR6w%3D%3D|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criticism of advertising''' is closely linked with [[media criticism|criticism of media]] and often interchangeable. Critics can refer to advertising's
* audio-visual aspects (cluttering of [[public space]]s and airwaves)
* environmental aspects ([[pollution]], oversize packaging, increasing consumption)
* political aspects ([[media dependency]], [[free speech]], [[censorship]])
* financial aspects (costs)
* ethical/moral/social aspects (sub-conscious influencing, invasion of privacy, increasing consumption and waste, target groups, certain products, honesty)

==Hyper-commercialism==

As advertising has become prevalent in modern society, it is increasingly being criticized. Advertising occupies public space and more and more invades the private sphere of people. According to Georg Franck, "It is becoming harder to escape from advertising and the media. Public space is increasingly turning into a gigantic billboard for products of all kind. The aesthetical and political consequences cannot yet be foreseen."&lt;ref name="aufmerksamkeit1998"/&gt; Hanno Rauterberg in the German newspaper ''Die Zeit'' calls advertising a new kind of dictatorship that cannot be escaped.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|author=Die Zeit, Hamburg, Germany |url=http://www.zeit.de/2008/47/Vermuellung |title=Öffentlichkeit: Werbekampagnen vereinnahmen den öffentlichen Raum &amp;#124; Kultur &amp;#124; Nachrichten auf ZEIT ONLINE |language=de |publisher=Zeit.de |date=2008-11-13 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ad creep]] says, "There are ads in schools, airport lounges, doctors offices, movie theaters, hospitals, gas stations, elevators, convenience stores, on the Internet, on fruit, on ATMs, on garbage cans and countless other places. There are ads on beach sand and restroom walls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commercialalert.org/issues/culture/ad-creep |title=Ad Creep — Commercial Alert |publisher=Commercialalert.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114142712/http://www.commercialalert.org/issues/culture/ad-creep |archivedate=2012-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "One of the ironies of advertising in our times is that as [[commercialism]] increases, it makes it that much more difficult for any particular advertiser to succeed, hence pushing the advertiser to even greater efforts."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p. 266, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a decade advertising in radios climbed to nearly 18 or 19 minutes per hour, on prime-time television the standard until 1982 was no more than 9.5 minutes of advertising per hour, today it is between 14 and 17 minutes. With the introduction of the shorter 15-second-spot the total amount of ads increased even more. Ads are not only placed in breaks but also into sports telecasts during the game itself. They flood the Internet, a growing market.

Other growing markets are [[product placement]]s in entertainment programming and movies where it has become standard practice and virtual advertising where products get placed retroactively into rerun shows. Product billboards are virtually inserted into Major League Baseball broadcasts and in the same manner, virtual street banners or logos are projected on an entry canopy or sidewalks, for example during the arrival of celebrities at the 2001 [[Grammy Awards]]. Advertising precedes the showing of films at cinemas including lavish 'film shorts' produced by companies such as Microsoft or DaimlerChrysler. "The largest advertising agencies have begun working to co-produce programming in conjunction with the largest media firms",&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p. 272, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating Infomercials resembling entertainment programming.

Opponents equate the growing amount of advertising with a "[[Tsunami|tidal wave]]" and restrictions with "damming" the flood. [[Kalle Lasn]], one of the most outspoken critics of advertising, considers advertising "the most prevalent and toxic of the mental pollutants. From the moment your radio alarm sounds in the morning to the wee hours of late-night TV microjolts of commercial pollution flood into your brain at the rate of around 3,000 marketing messages per day. Every day an estimated 12 billion display ads, 3 million radio commercials and more than 200,000 television commercials are dumped into North America's collective unconscious".&lt;ref name="Lasn 1999"&gt;Lasn, Kalle in: Culture Jam: The Uncooling of America, William Morrow &amp; Company; 1st edition (November 1999), {{ISBN|0-688-15656-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-688-15656-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of their life, the average American watches three years of advertising on television.&lt;ref&gt;Kilbourne, Jean: Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel, Touchstone, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-684-86600-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video games incorporate products into their content. Special commercial patient channels in hospitals and public figures sporting temporary tattoos. A method unrecognisable as advertising is so-called ''[[guerrilla marketing]]'' which is spreading 'buzz' about a new product in target audiences. Cash-strapped U.S. cities offer police cars for advertising.&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies buy the names of [[Stadium|sports stadiums]] for advertising. The [[Hamburg]] soccer Volkspark stadium first became the AOL Arena and then the [[HSH Nordbank Arena]]. The [[Stuttgart]] Neckarstadion became the [[Mercedes-Benz Arena (Stuttgart)|Mercedes-Benz Arena]], the Dortmund Westfalenstadion is the [[Signal Iduna Park]]. The former SkyDome in Toronto was renamed [[Rogers Centre]].

Whole subway stations in Berlin are redesigned into product halls and exclusively leased to a company. Düsseldorf has "multi-sensorial" adventure transit stops equipped with loudspeakers and systems that spread the smell of a detergent. Swatch used beamers to project messages on the Berlin TV-tower and Victory column, which was fined because it was done without a permit. The illegality was part of the scheme and added promotion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; [[Christopher Lasch]] states that advertising leads to an overall increase in [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] in society; "Advertising serves not so much to advertise products as to promote [[Consumerism|consumption as a way of life]]."&lt;ref&gt;Lasch, Christopher. The Culture of Narcissism: American Life in an Age of Diminishing Expectations, Norton, New York, {{ISBN|978-0-393-30738-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional rights==
In the US, advertising is equated with constitutionally guaranteed freedom of opinion and speech.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csupomona.edu/~jkirkpatrick/Papers/EthicsAdvtTaxation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Currently or in the near future, any number of cases are and will be working their way through the court system that would seek to prohibit any government regulation of... commercial speech (e.g. advertising or food labelling) on the grounds that such regulation would violate citizens' and corporations' First Amendment rights to free speech or free press."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), pp. 132, 249, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example for this debate is advertising for tobacco or alcohol but also advertising by mail or fliers (clogged mail boxes), advertising on the phone, in the Internet and advertising for children. Various legal restrictions concerning spamming, advertising on mobile phones, when addressing children, tobacco, alcohol have been introduced by the US, the EU and other countries.

McChesney argues, that the government deserves constant vigilance when it comes to such regulations, but that it is certainly not "the only antidemocratic force in our society. Corporations and the wealthy enjoy a power every bit as immense as that enjoyed by the lords and royalty of feudal times" and "markets are not value-free or neutral; they not only tend to work to the advantage of those with the most money, but they also by their very nature emphasize profit over all else. Hence, today the debate is over whether advertising or food labelling, or campaign contributions are speech... if the rights to be protected by the First Amendment can only be effectively employed by a fraction of the citizenry, and their exercise of these rights gives them undue political power and undermines the ability of the balance of the citizenry to exercise the same rights and/or constitutional rights, then it is not necessarily legitimately protected by the First Amendment". "Those with the capacity to engage in free press are in a position to determine who can speak to the great mass of citizens and who cannot".&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), pp. 252, 249, 254, 256, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georg Franck at Vienna University of Technology, says that advertising is part of what he calls "mental capitalism",&lt;ref name="aufmerksamkeit1998"&gt;Franck, Georg: ''Ökonomie der Aufmerksamkeit. Ein Entwurf.'' (Economy of Attention), 1. Edition. Carl Hanser, March 1998, {{ISBN|3-446-19348-0}}, {{ISBN|978-3-446-19348-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="medienzeitalter36"&gt;Lecture held at Philosophicum Lech (Austria) 2002, published in Konrad Paul Liessmann (Hrg.), Die Kanäle der Macht. Herrschaft und Freiheit im Medienzeitalter, Philosophicum Lech Vol. 6, Vienna: Zsolnay, 2003, pp. 36-60; preprint in Merkur No. 645, January 2003, S. 1-15&lt;/ref&gt; taking up a term (mental) which has been used by groups concerned with the mental environment, such as [[Adbusters]]. Franck blends the "Economy of Attention" with Christopher Lasch's [[The Culture of Narcissism|culture of narcissism]] into the mental capitalism:&lt;ref name="christopher1995"&gt;Lasch, Christopher: ''Das Zeitalter des Narzissmus.'' (The Culture of Narcissism), 1. Edition. Hoffmann und Campe, Hamburg 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay "Advertising at the Edge of the Apocalypse", [[Sut Jhally]] writes: "20th century advertising is the most powerful and sustained system of propaganda in [[human history]] and its cumulative cultural effects, unless quickly checked, will be responsible for destroying the world as we know it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sutjhally.com/articles/advertisingattheed/ |title=Sut Jhally Website - Advertising at the Edge of the Apocalypse |publisher=Sutjhally.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Costs==
Advertising has developed into a multibillion-dollar business. In 2014, 537 billion US dollars &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/07/internet-ad-spend-to-reach-121b-in-2014-23-of-537b-total-ad-spend-ad-tech-gives-display-a-boost-over-search/ | title=Internet Ad Spend To Reach $121B In 2014, 23% Of $537B Total Ad Spend, Ad Tech Boosts Display |date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; were spent worldwide for advertising. In 2013, TV accounted for 40.1% of ad spending, compared to a combined 18.1% for internet, 16.9% for newspapers, 7.9% for magazines, 7% for outdoor, 6.9% for radio, 2.7% for mobile and 0.5% for cinema as a share of ad spending by medium. Advertising is considered to raise consumption.

Attention and attentiveness have become a new commodity for which a market developed. "The amount of attention that is absorbed by the media and redistributed in the competition for quotas and reach is not identical with the amount of attention, that is available in society. The total amount circulating in society is made up of the attention exchanged among the people themselves and the attention given to media information. Only the latter is homogenised by quantitative measuring and only the latter takes on the character of an anonymous currency."&lt;ref name="aufmerksamkeit1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="medienzeitalter36"/&gt; According to Franck, any surface of presentation that can guarantee a certain degree of attentiveness works as magnet for attention, for example, media which are actually meant for information and entertainment, culture and the arts, public space etc. It is this attraction which is sold to the advertising business. In Germany, the advertising industry contributes 1.5% of the gross national income. The German Advertising Association stated that in 2007, 30.78 billion Euros were spent on advertising in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zaw.de |title=ZAW - Zentralverband der deutschen Werbewirtschaft e.V |publisher=Zaw.de |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 26% in newspapers, 21% on television, 15% by mail and 15% in magazines. In 2002 there were 360,000 people employed in the advertising business. The Internet revenues for advertising doubled to almost 1 billion Euros from 2006 to 2007, giving it the highest growth rates.

Few consumers are aware of the fact that they are the ones paying for every cent spent for public relations, advertisements, rebates, packaging etc., since they ordinarily get included in the price calculation.

The most important element of advertising is not information but suggestion - more or less making use of associations, [[appeal to emotion|emotions]] and drives in the subconscious, such as [[sex drive]], [[herd instinct]], [[desire]]s such as happiness, health, fitness, appearance, [[self-esteem]], [[reputation]], belonging, [[social status]], identity, adventure, distraction, reward, [[appeal to fear|fears]] such as illness, weaknesses, loneliness, need, uncertainty, security or of [[prejudice]]s, learned opinions and comforts. "All [[Need|human needs]], relationships, and [[fear]]s - the deepest recesses of the [[human psyche]] - become mere means for the expansion of the [[commodity]] universe under the force of modern marketing. With the rise to prominence of  modern marketing, [[commercialism]] - the translation of human relations into commodity relations - although a phenomenon intrinsic to capitalism, has expanded exponentially."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p. 265, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cause-related marketing in which advertisers link their product to some worthy social cause has boomed over the past decade.

Advertising uses the model role of [[celebrities]] or popular figures and makes deliberate use of humor as well as of associations with color, tunes, certain names and terms. These are factors of how one perceives themself and one's self-worth. In his description of 'mental capitalism' Franck says, "the promise of consumption making someone irresistible is the ideal way of objects and symbols into a person's subjective experience. Evidently, in a society in which revenue of attention moves to the fore, consumption is drawn by one's self-esteem. As a result, consumption becomes 'work' on a person's attraction. From the subjective point of view, this 'work' opens fields of unexpected dimensions for advertising. Advertising takes on the role of a life councillor in matters of attraction. The cult around one's own attraction is what Christopher Lasch described as 'Culture of Narcissism'."&lt;ref name="medienzeitalter36"/&gt;&lt;ref name="christopher1995"/&gt;

For advertising critics another serious problem is that, "the long standing notion of separation between advertising and editorial/creative sides of media is rapidly crumbling" and advertising is increasingly hard to tell apart from news, information or entertainment. The boundaries between advertising and programming are becoming blurred. According to the media firms all this commercial involvement has no influence over actual media content, but as McChesney puts it, "this claim fails to pass even the most basic giggle test, it is so preposterous."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), pp. 270, 272, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising draws "heavily on psychological theories about how to create subjects, enabling advertising and marketing to take on a 'more clearly psychological tinge'.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Rose, 1997, cited in Thrift, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;67&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, the emphasis in advertising has switched from providing 'factual' information to the symbolic connotations of commodities, since the crucial cultural premise of advertising is that the material object being sold is never in itself enough. Even those commodities providing for the most mundane necessities of daily life must be imbued with symbolic qualities and culturally endowed meanings via the 'magic system' of advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; In this way and by altering the context in which advertisements appear, things 'can be made to mean 'just about anything' and the 'same' things can be endowed with different intended meanings for different individuals and groups of people, thereby offering mass produced visions of individualism."&lt;ref name="oxfordjournals1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joeg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/8/3/421 |title=JEG - Sign In Page |publisher=Joeg.oxfordjournals.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McFall, 2002, p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

Before advertising is done, [[market research]] institutions need to know and describe the target group to exactly plan and implement the advertising campaign and to achieve the best possible results. A whole array of sciences directly deal with advertising and marketing or are used to improve its effects. Focus groups, psychologists and cultural anthropologists are '''de rigueur''' in marketing research".&lt;ref name="mcchesney277"&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p.277, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vast amounts of data on persons and their shopping habits are collected, accumulated, aggregated and analysed with the aid of credit cards, bonus cards, raffles and internet surveying. With increasing accuracy this supplies a picture of behaviour, wishes and weaknesses of certain sections of a population with which advertisement can be employed more selectively and effectively.

The efficiency of advertising is improved through [[advertising research]]. Universities, of course supported by business and in co-operation with other disciplines (s. above), mainly [[Psychiatry]], [[Anthropology]], [[Neurology]] and behavioural sciences, are constantly in search for ever more refined, sophisticated, subtle and crafty methods to make advertising more effective. "[[Neuromarketing]] is a controversial new field of marketing which uses medical technologies such as functional [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (fMRI)—not to heal, but to sell products. Advertising and marketing firms have long used the insights and research methods of psychology in order to sell products, of course. But today these practices are reaching epidemic levels, and with a complicity on the part of the psychological profession that exceeds that of the past. The result is an enormous advertising and marketing onslaught that comprises, arguably, the largest single psychological project ever undertaken. Yet, this great undertaking remains largely ignored by the American Psychological Association."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commercialalert.org/issues/culture/psychology |title=Psychology — Commercial Alert |publisher=Commercialalert.org |date=1999-10-31 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert McChesney calls it "the greatest concerted attempt at [[psychological manipulation]] in all of human history."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas"., (May 1, 2008), p. 277, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media and Corporate censorship==
{{see|Corporate censorship}}
Almost all [[mass media]] are [[advertising media]] and many of them are exclusively advertising media and, with the exception of [[public service broadcasting]], are in the private sector. Their income is predominantly generated through advertising; in the case of newspapers and magazines from 50 to 80%. Public service broadcasting in some countries can also heavily depend on advertising as a source of income (up to 40%).&lt;ref&gt;Siegert, Gabriele, Brecheis Dieter in: Werbung in der Medien- und Informationsgesellschaft, Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, 2005, {{ISBN|3-531-13893-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of critics no media that spreads advertisements can be independent and the higher the proportion of advertising, the higher the dependency. This dependency has "distinct implications for the nature of media content.... In the business press, the media are often referred to in exactly the way they present themselves in their candid moments: as a branch of the advertising industry."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p. 256, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the private media are increasingly subject to mergers and concentration with property situations often becoming entangled and opaque. This development, which Henry A. Giroux calls an "ongoing threat to democratic culture",&lt;ref name="sutjhally.com"&gt;Giroux, Henry A., McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada, in the foreword for: The Spectacle of Accumulation by Sut Jhally, [http://www.sutjhally.com/biography Sutjhally.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  by itself should suffice to sound all alarms in a democracy. Five or six advertising agencies dominate this 400 billion U.S. dollar global industry.

"Journalists have long faced pressure to shape stories to suit advertisers and owners .... the vast majority of TV station executives found their news departments 'cooperative' in shaping the news to assist in 'non-traditional revenue development."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p. 43, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative and undesired reporting can be prevented or influenced when advertisers threaten to cancel orders or simply when there is a danger of such a cancellation. Media dependency and such a threat become very real when there is only one dominant or very few large advertisers. The influence of advertisers is not only in regard to news or information on their own products or services but expands to articles or shows not directly linked to them. In order to secure their advertising revenues the media have to create the best possible 'advertising environment'.

Another problem considered censorship by critics is the refusal of media to accept advertisements that are not in their interest. A striking example of this is the refusal of TV stations to broadcast ads by [[Adbusters]]. Groups try to place advertisements and are refused by networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3581/adbusters_ads_busted/ |title=Adbusters' Ads Busted |publisher=In These Times |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is principally the viewing rates which decide upon the programme in the private radio and television business. "Their business is to absorb as much attention as possible. The viewing rate measures the attention the media trades for the information offered. The service of this attraction is sold to the advertising business"&lt;ref name="medienzeitalter36"/&gt; and the viewing rates determine the price that can be demanded for advertising.

"Advertising companies determining the contents of shows has been part of daily life in the USA since 1933. Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) .... offered a radio station a history-making trade (today known as "bartering"): the company would produce an own show for "free" and save the radio station the high expenses for producing contents. Therefore, the company would want its commercials spread and, of course, its products placed in the show. Thus, the series '[[Ma Perkins]]' was created, which P&amp;G skilfully used to promote Oxydol, the leading detergent brand in those years and the [[Soap opera]] was born ..."&lt;ref name="viadrina1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viadrina.euv-ffo.de/~sk/SS99/werbung99/medien.html |title=Seminar: Werbewelten - Werbung und Medien |language=de |publisher=Viadrina.euv-ffo.de |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While critics basically worry about the subtle influence of the economy on the media, there are also examples of blunt exertion of influence. The US company [[Chrysler]], before it merged with [[Daimler Benz]] had its agency (PentaCom) send out a letter to numerous magazines, demanding that they send an overview of all the topics before the next issue was published, to "avoid potential conflict". Chrysler most of all wanted to know if there would be articles with "sexual, political or social" content, or which could be seen as "provocative or offensive". PentaCom executive David Martin said: "Our reasoning is, that anyone looking at a 22.000 $ product would want it surrounded by positive things. There is nothing positive about an article on child pornography."&lt;ref name="viadrina1"/&gt; In another example, the USA Network held top-level‚ off-the-record meetings with advertisers in 2000 to let them tell the network what type of programming content they wanted in order for USA to get their advertising."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p.271, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Television shows are created to accommodate the needs of advertising, e.g. splitting them up in suitable sections. Their dramaturgy is typically designed to end in suspense or leave an unanswered question in order to keep the viewer attached.

The movie system, at one time outside the direct influence of the broader marketing system, is now fully integrated into it through the strategies of licensing, tie-ins and product placements. The prime function of many Hollywood films today is to aid in the selling of the immense collection of commodities.&lt;ref name="advertisingattheed1"&gt;Jhally, Sut. Advertising at the edge of the apocalypse: [http://www.sutjhally.com/articles/advertisingattheed/ Sutjhally.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
The press called the 2002 Bond film 'Die Another Day' featuring 24 major promotional partners an 'ad-venture' and noted that [[James Bond]] "now has been 'licensed to sell'" As it has become standard practice to place products in motion pictures, it "has self-evident implications for what types of films will attract product placements and what types of films will therefore be more likely to get made".&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), pp. 269, 270, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising and information are increasingly hard to distinguish from each other. "The borders between advertising and media .... become more and more blurred.... What August Fischer, chairman of the board of [[Axel Springer]] publishing company considers to be a 'proven partnership between the media and advertising business' critics regard as nothing but the infiltration of journalistic duties and freedoms". According to [[RTL Group]] former executive Helmut Thoma "private stations shall not and cannot serve any mission but only the goal of the company which is the 'acceptance by the advertising business and the viewer'. The setting of priorities in this order actually says everything about the 'design of the programmes' by private television."&lt;ref name="viadrina1"/&gt;
Patrick Le Lay, former managing director of TF1, a private French television channel with a market share of 25 to 35%, said: "There are many ways to talk about television. But from the business point of view, let's be realistic: basically, the job of TF1 is, e. g. to help Coca Cola sell its product. (...) For an advertising message to be perceived the brain of the viewer must be at our disposal. The job of our programmes is to make it available, that is to say, to distract it, to relax it and get it ready between two messages. It is disposable human brain time that we sell to Coca Cola."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.observatoire-medias.info/article.php3?id_article=225 |title=Selon Le Lay, TF1 a une mission: fournir du "temps de cerveau humain disponible" - [Observatoire français des médias&amp;#93;|publisher=Observatoire-medias.info |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of these dependencies, a widespread and fundamental public debate about advertising and its influence on information and freedom of speech is difficult to obtain, at least through the usual media channels: it would saw off the branch it was sitting on. "The notion that the commercial basis of media, journalism, and communication could have troubling implications for democracy is excluded from the range of legitimate debate" just as "capitalism is off-limits as a topic of legitimate debate in US political culture".&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), pp. 235, 237, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early critic of the structural basis of US journalism was [[Upton Sinclair]] with his novel [[The Brass Check]] in which he stresses the influence of owners, advertisers, public relations, and economic interests on the media. In his book "Our Master's Voice - Advertising" the social ecologist [[James Rorty]] (1890-1973) wrote:
"The gargoyle's mouth is a loudspeaker, powered by the vested interest of a two-billion dollar industry, and back of that the vested interests of business as a whole, of industry, of finance. It is never silent, it drowns out all other voices, and it suffers no rebuke, for it is not the voice of America? That is its claim and to some extent it is a just claim..."&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, James: "Our Master's Voice: Advertising" Ayer Co Pub, 1976, {{ISBN|0-405-08044-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-405-08044-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has taught us how to live, what to be afraid of, what to be proud of, how to be beautiful, how to be loved, how to be envied, how to be successful..  Is it any wonder that the American population tends increasingly to speak, think, feel in terms of this jabberwocky? That the stimuli of art, science, religion are progressively expelled to the periphery of American life to become marginal values, cultivated by marginal people on marginal time?"&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, James: (1934) "Our Master's Voice - Advertising", McMaster Press (June 30, 2008), {{ISBN|1-4097-6973-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4097-6973-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Performances, exhibitions, shows, concerts, conventions and most other events can hardly take place without sponsoring.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}  Artists are graded and paid according to their art's value for commercial purposes.
Corporations promote renowned artists, thereby getting exclusive rights in global advertising campaigns. Broadway shows like 'La Bohème' featured commercial props in their sets.&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p. 276, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising itself is extensively considered to be a contribution to culture. Advertising is integrated into fashion. On many pieces of clothing the company [[logo]] is the only design or is an important part of it. There is only a little room left outside the consumption economy, in which culture and art can develop independently and where alternative values can be expressed. A last important sphere, the universities, is under strong pressure to open up for business and its interests.&lt;ref&gt;Jhally, Sut in: Stay Free Nr. 16, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Competitive sports have become unthinkable without sponsoring and there is a mutual dependency.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} High income with advertising is only possible with a comparable number of spectators or viewers. On the other hand, the poor performance of a team or a sportsman results in less advertising revenues. Jürgen Hüther and Hans-Jörg Stiehler talk about a 'Sports/Media Complex which is a complicated mix of media, agencies, managers, sports promoters, advertising etc. with partially common and partially diverging interests but in any case with common commercial interests. The media presumably is at centre stage because it can supply the other parties involved with a rare commodity, namely (potential) public attention. In sports "the media are able to generate enormous sales in both circulation and advertising."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p. 213, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Sports sponsorship is acknowledged by the tobacco industry to be valuable advertising. A Tobacco Industry journal in 1994 described the Formula One car as 'The most powerful advertising space in the world'. .... In a cohort study carried out in 22 secondary schools in England in 1994 and 1995 boys whose favourite television sport was motor racing had a 12.8% risk of becoming regular smokers compared to 7.0% of boys who did not follow motor racing."&lt;ref name="scientific1998"&gt;Report of the Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health, Prepared March 20, 1998, in [http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/doh/tobacco/part-4.htm Archive.official-documents.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not the sale of tickets but transmission rights, sponsoring and merchandising in the meantime make up the largest part of sports association's and sports club's revenues with the IOC ([[International Olympic Committee]]) taking the lead. The influence of the media brought many changes in sports including the admittance of new 'trend sports' into the [[Olympic Games]], the alteration of competition distances, changes of rules, animation of spectators, changes of sports facilities, the cult of sports heroes who quickly establish themselves in the advertising and entertaining business because of their media value&lt;ref name="merzwissenschaft2006"&gt;Hüther, Jürgen and Stiehler, Hans-Jörg in: Merz, Zeitschrift für Medien und Erziehung, Vol. 2006/6: merzWissenschaft - Sport und Medien, [http://www.jff.de/merz/list.php?katid=3&amp;heft_id=80 JFF.de]&lt;/ref&gt; and last but not least, the naming and renaming of sport stadiums after big companies.

"In sports adjustment into the logic of the media can contribute to the erosion of values such as equal chances or fairness, to excessive demands on athletes through public pressure and multiple exploitation or to deceit ([[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|doping]], manipulation of results ...). It is in the very interest of the media and sports to counter this danger because media sports can only work as long as sport exists.&lt;ref name="merzwissenschaft2006"/&gt;

==Public space==
{{see|public space}}
Every visually perceptible place has potential for advertising, especially urban areas with their structures but also landscapes in sight of thoroughfares are more and more turning into media for advertisements. Signs, posters, [[billboard]]s, flags have become decisive factors in the urban appearance and their numbers are still on the increase. "[[Outdoor advertising]] has become unavoidable. Traditional billboards and transit shelters have cleared the way for more pervasive methods such as wrapped vehicles, sides of buildings, electronic signs, kiosks, taxis, posters, sides of buses, and more. Digital technologies are used on buildings to sport 'urban [[wall display]]s'. In urban areas commercial content is placed in our sight and into our consciousness every moment we are in public space. The German Newspaper 'Zeit' called it a new kind of 'dictatorship that one cannot escape'.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Over time, this domination of the surroundings has become the "natural" state. Through long-term commercial saturation, it has become implicitly understood by the public that advertising has the right to own, occupy and control every inch of available space. The steady normalization of invasive advertising dulls the public's perception of their surroundings, re-enforcing a general attitude of powerlessness toward creativity and change, thus a cycle develops enabling advertisers to slowly and consistently increase the saturation of advertising with little or no public outcry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antiadvertisingagency.com/our-mission |title=Our Mission |publisher=The Anti-Advertising Agency |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The massive optical orientation toward advertising changes the function of public spaces which are utilised by brands. Urban landmarks are turned into trademarks. The highest pressure is exerted on renown and highly frequented public spaces which are also important for the identity of a city (e.g. [[Piccadilly Circus]], [[Times Square]], [[Alexanderplatz]]).
Urban spaces are public commodities and in this capacity they are subject to "aesthetical environment protection", mainly through building regulations, heritage protection and landscape protection. "It is in this capacity that these spaces are now being privatised. They are peppered with billboards and signs, they are remodelled into media for advertising."&lt;ref name="aufmerksamkeit1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="medienzeitalter36"/&gt;

==Sexism, discrimination and stereotyping==
{{see|stereotyping|sexism|discrimination}}
[[File:Two girls examining a bulletin board posted on a fence. An advertisement painted above them asks "Are You a Woman?".jpg|thumb|right|Two girls examining a bulletin board posted on a fence. An advertisement painted above them asks "Are You a Woman?".]]

"Advertising has an "agenda setting function" which is the ability, with huge sums of money, to put consumption as the only item on the agenda. In the battle for a share of the [[public conscience]] this amounts to non-treatment ([[ignorance]]) of whatever is not commercial and whatever  is not advertised for

With increasing force, advertising makes itself comfortable in the [[private sphere]] so that the voice of commerce becomes the dominant way of expression in society."&lt;ref&gt;Eicke, Ulrich in: Die Werbelawine. Angriff auf unser Bewußtsein. München, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
Advertising critics see advertising as the leading light in our culture. Sut Jhally and James Twitchell go beyond considering advertising as kind of [[religion]] and that advertising even replaces religion as a key institution.&lt;ref&gt;Stay Free Nr. 16, On Advertising, Summer 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

"Corporate advertising (or commercial media) is the largest single psychological project ever undertaken by the human race. Yet for all of that, its impact on us remains unknown and largely ignored. When I think of the media's influence over years, over decades, I think of those [[brainwashing]] experiments conducted by Dr. [[Donald Ewen Cameron|Ewen Cameron]] in a Montreal psychiatric hospital in the 1950s (see [[MKULTRA]]). The idea of the CIA-sponsored "[[depatterning]]" experiments was to outfit conscious, unconscious or semiconscious subjects with headphones, and flood their brains with thousands of repetitive "driving" messages that would alter their behaviour over time....Advertising aims to do the same thing."&lt;ref name="Lasn 1999"/&gt;

Advertising is especially aimed at young people and children and it increasingly reduces young people to consumers.&lt;ref name="sutjhally.com"/&gt;
For Sut Jhally it is not "surprising that something this central and with so much being expended on it should become an important presence in social life. Indeed, commercial interests intent on maximizing the consumption of the immense collection of commodities have colonized more and more of the spaces of our culture. For instance, almost the entire media system (television and print) has been developed as a delivery system for marketers, and its prime function is to produce audiences for sale to advertisers. Both the advertisements it carries and the editorial matter that acts as a support for it celebrate the consumer society. The movie system, at one time outside the direct influence of the broader marketing system, is now fully integrated into it through the strategies of licensing, tie-ins and product placements.

The prime function of many Hollywood films today is to aid in the selling of the immense collection of commodities. As public funds are drained from the non-commercial cultural sector, art galleries, museums and symphonies bid for corporate sponsorship."&lt;ref name="advertisingattheed1"/&gt; In the same way effected is the education system and advertising is increasingly penetrating schools and universities. Cities, such as New York, accept sponsors for public playgrounds. "Even the pope has been commercialized ... The pope's 4-day visit to Mexico in ...1999 was sponsored by Frito-Lay and PepsiCo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mularz|first=Stephen|title=The Negative Effects of Advertising, |url=http://www.mularzart.com/writings/THE%20NEGATIVE%20EFFECTS%20OF%20ADVERTISING.pdf|format=PDF|website=mularzart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The industry is accused of being one of the engines powering a convoluted economic mass production system which promotes consumption.
As far as social effects are concerned it does not matter whether advertising fuels consumption but which values, patterns of behaviour and assignments of meaning it propagates.

Advertising is accused of hijacking the language and means of pop culture, of protest movements and even of subversive criticism and does not shy away from scandalizing and breaking taboos (e.g. Benneton). This in turn incites counter action, what Kalle Lasn in 2001 called ''Jamming the Jam of the Jammers''. Anything goes. "It is a central social-scientific question what people can be made to do by suitable design of conditions and of great practical importance. For example, from a great number of experimental psychological experiments it can be assumed, that people can be made to do anything they are capable of, when the according social condition can be created."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, Hans Jürgen. Einführung in das Image-Marketing. Feldtheoretische Forschung. Stuttgart: Kohlhammer (Urban TB, 1977). Hieraus: Aufgabe der Werbung S. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising often uses stereotype gender specific roles of men and women reinforcing existing [[cliché]]s and it has been criticized as "inadvertently or even intentionally promoting sexism, racism, heterosexualism, ableism, ageism, et cetera... At very least, advertising often reinforces stereotypes by drawing on recognizable "types" in order to tell stories in a single image or 30 second time frame." Activities are depicted as typical male or female (stereotyping). In addition, people are reduced to their sexuality or equated with commodities and gender specific qualities are exaggerated. Sexualized female bodies, but increasingly also males, serve as eye-catchers.

In advertising, it is usually a woman that is depicted as
* a servant of men and children that reacts to the demands and complaints of her loved ones with a bad conscience and the promise for immediate improvement (wash, food)
* a sexual or emotional play toy for the self-affirmation of men
* a technically totally clueless being that can only manage a childproof operation
* female expert, but stereotype from the fields of fashion, cosmetics, food or at the most, medicine
* as ultra thin
* doing ground-work for others, e.g. serving coffee while a journalist interviews a politician&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanistische-union.de |title=Humanistische Union: Aktuelles |publisher=Humanistische-union.de |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large portion of advertising deals with the promotion of products in a way that defines an "ideal" body image. This objectification greatly affects women; however, men are also affected. Women and men in advertising are frequently portrayed in unrealistic and distorted images that set a standard for what is considered "beautiful," "attractive" or "desirable." Such imagery does not allow for what is found to be beautiful in various cultures or to the individual. It is exclusionary, rather than inclusive, and consequently, these advertisements promote a negative message about body image to the average person. Because of this form of media, girls, boys, women and men may feel under high pressure to maintain an unrealistic and often unhealthy body weight or even to alter their physical appearance cosmetically or surgically in minor to drastic ways.

The EU parliament passed a resolution in 2008 that advertising may not be discriminating and degrading. This shows that politicians are increasingly concerned about the negative impacts of advertising. However, the benefits of promoting overall health and fitness are often overlooked. Men are also negatively portrayed as incompetent and the butt of every joke in advertising.

==Children and adolescents==
Business is interested in children and adolescents because of their buying power and because of their influence on the shopping habits of their parents. As they are easier to influence they are especially targeted by the advertising business.

Children "represent three distinct markets:
# Primary Purchasers ($2.9 billion annually)
# Future Consumers (Brand-loyal adults)
# Purchase Influencers ($20 billion annually)
Kids will carry forward brand expectations, whether positive, negative, or indifferent. Kids are already accustomed to being catered to as consumers. The long term prize: Loyalty of the kid translates into a brand loyal adult customer"&lt;ref&gt;YTV's 2007 Tween Report in: [http://ontariondp.com/ban-advertising-aimed-children-under-13 Ontariondp.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Kids represent an important demographic to marketers because they have their own purchasing power, they influence their parents' buying decisions and they're the adult consumers of the future." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/marketing/marketers_target_kids.cfm |title=How Marketers Target Kids |publisher=The Media Awareness Network (MNet) |year=2010 |accessdate=2011-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416200521/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/marketing/marketers_target_kids.cfm |archivedate=2009-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Advertising for other products preferably uses media with which they can also reach the next generation of consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Eicke Ulrich u. Wolfram  in: Medienkinder: Vom richtigen Umgang mit der Vielfalt, Knesebeck München, 1994, {{ISBN|3-926901-67-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Key advertising messages exploit the emerging independence of young people".

===Children's exposure to advertising===
The children's market, where resistance to advertising is weakest, is the "pioneer for ad creep".&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p. 269, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is product placement. "[[Product placement]]s show up everywhere, and children aren't exempt. Far from it. The animated film, Foodfight, had 'thousands of products and character icons from the familiar (items) in a grocery store.' Children's books also feature branded items and characters, and millions of them have snack foods as lead characters."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press (May 1, 2008), {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average Canadian child sees 350,000 TV commercials before graduating from high school, spends nearly as much time watching TV as attending classes. In 1980 the Canadian province of Quebec banned advertising for children under age 13.&lt;ref&gt;Consumer Protection Act, R.S.Q., c. P-40.1, ss. 248-9 (see also: ss. 87-91 of the Consumer Protection Regulations, R.R.Q., 1981, c. P-40.1; and Application Guide for Sections 248 and 249 of the Quebec Consumer Protection Act (Advertising Intended for Children Under 13 Years of Age).&lt;/ref&gt;  "In upholding the constitutional validity of the [[Quebec Consumer Protection Act]] restrictions on advertising to children under age 13 (in the case of a challenge by a toy company) the Court held: '...advertising directed at young children is per se manipulative. Such advertising aims to promote products by convincing those who will always believe.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-scc/en/pub/1989/vol1/html/1989scr1_0927.html|title=Redirection&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=umontreal.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Norway (ads directed at children under age 12), and Sweden (television ads aimed at children under age 12) also have legislated broad bans on advertising to children, during child programmes any kind of advertising is forbidden in Sweden, Denmark, Austria and Flemish Belgium. In Greece there is no advertising for kids products from 7 to 22 h. An attempt to restrict advertising directed at children in the US failed with reference to the First Amendment. In Spain bans are also considered undemocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Melanie Rother |url=https://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2001/0203/none/0086/index.html |title=Leichtes Spiel für die Werbeindustrie : Textarchiv : Berliner Zeitung Archiv |publisher=Berlinonline.de |date=2008-05-31 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Corinna|last=Hawkes|title=Marketing Food to Children: The Global Regulatory Environment|location=Geneva|website=World Health Organization|year=2004|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2004/9241591579.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Web sites targeted to children may also display advertisements, though there are fewer ads on non-profit web sites than on for-profit sites and those ads were less likely to contain enticements. However, even ads on non-profit sites may link to sites that collect personal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cai|first=Xiaomei|title=Advertisements and Privacy: Comparing For-Profit and Non-Profit Web Sites for Children|journal=Communication Research Reports|year=2008|volume=25|issue=1|page=67|doi=10.1080/08824090701831826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food advertising===
{{see also|Fast food advertising|Adolescents and food marketing}}
[[Sweets]], [[ice cream]], and [[breakfast food]] makers often aim their promotion at children and adolescents. For example, an ad for a breakfast cereal on a channel aimed at adults will have music that is a soft ballad, whereas on a channel aimed at children, the same ad will use a catchy rock jingle of the same song to aim at kids.
"The marketing industry is facing increased pressure over claimed links between exposure to food advertising and a range of social problems, especially growing obesity levels."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-31767632_ITM |title=Commercial media literacy: what does it do, to whom-and does it matter? (22-JUN-07) |work=[[Journal of Advertising]] |publisher=Accessmylibrary.com |date=2007-06-22 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Fast food]] chains spend more than 3 billion dollars a year on advertising, much of it aimed at children... Restaurants offer incentives such as playgrounds, contests, clubs, games, and free toys and other merchandise related to movies, TV shows and even sports leagues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/marketing/issues_kids_marketing.cfm |title=Special Issues for Young Children: Junk food advertising and nutrition concerns |publisher=[[The Media Awareness Network]] (MNet) |year=2010 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These businesses are constantly reaping the benefits of this child manipulation.
In 2006, forty-four of the largest U.S. [[food industries]] spent about 2 billion dollars on advertising their products, which mainly consisted of unhealthy, sugary and fatty foods. Such massive advertising has a detrimental effect on children and it heavily influences their diets. Extensive research proves that most of the food consumed between ages of 2-18 is low in nutrients. Facing a lot of pressure from health industries and laws, such as the Children's Food and Beverage Advertising initiative, food marketers were forced to tweak and limit their advertising strategies. Despite regulations, a 2009 report shows that three quarters of all food advertising during [[children's television programs]] were outside of the law's boundaries. Government attempts to put a heavy burden on food marketers in order to prevent the issue, but food marketers enjoy the benefits of the [[First Amendment]] which limits government's power to prevent advertising against children. The [[Federal Trade Commission]] states that children between the ages of 2-11 on average see 15 food based commercials on television daily. Most of these commercial involve high-sugar and high-fat foods, which adds to the problem of [[childhood obesity]]. An experiment that took place in a summer camp, where researches showed food advertisements to children between ages 5–8 for two weeks. The outcome-what kids chose to eat at a cafeteria were the ads they saw on TV over the two weeks.&lt;ref name="Health Affairs"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/31/2/392 | title=Government can regulate food advertising to children because cognitive research shows that it is inherently misleading | author=Graff, S., Kunkel, D., Mermin E.

===Cigarettes and alcohol advertising===
{{main|Alcohol advertising|Cigarette advertising}}
{{see also|Alcohol advertising on college campuses|Alcohol consumption by youth in the United States}}

In advertisements, cigarettes "are used as a fashion accessory and appeal to young women. Other influences on young people include the linking of sporting heroes and smoking through sports sponsorship, the use of cigarettes by popular characters in television programmes and cigarette promotions. Research suggests that young people are aware of the most heavily advertised cigarette brands."&lt;ref name="scientific1998"/&gt; Alcohol is portrayed in advertising similarly to smoking, "Alcohol ads continue to appeal to children and portrayals of alcohol use in the entertainment media are extensive".&lt;ref name="eric.ed.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ERIC_ED461810 &lt;!-- http://www.eric.ed.gov:80/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/19/cb/b6.pdf|format=PDF --&gt;|title=ERIC ED461810: Teen Tipplers: America's Underage Drinking Epidemic|publisher=ERIC - [[Education Resources Information Center]] ([[United States Department of Education]]), [[National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[consumption of alcohol]] is glamorized and shown without consequences in advertisements, music, magazines, television, film, etc. The advertisements include alcoholic beverages with colorful packaging and sweet tasting flavors, catering to the interests and likes of children and teens. The [[alcohol industry]] has a big financial stake in underage drinking, hoping to gain lifelong customers. Therefore, the media are overrun with alcohol ads which appeal to children, involving animal characters, popular music, and comedy.&lt;ref name="eric.ed.gov"/&gt;

"Kids are among the most sophisticated observers of ads. They can sing the jingles and identify the logos, and they often have strong feelings about products. What they generally don't understand, however, are the issues that underlie how advertising works. Mass media are used not only to sell goods but also ideas: how we should behave, what rules are important, who we should respect and what we should value."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schechter |first=Danny |url=http://www.mediachannel.org |title=Home |publisher=Media Channel |date=2009-04-16 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition and campaigns against advertising==
According to critics, the total commercialization of all fields of society, the privatization of public space, the acceleration of consumption and waste of resources including the negative influence on lifestyles and on the environment has not been noticed to the necessary extent. The "hyper-commercialization of the culture is recognized and roundly detested by the citizenry, although the topic scarcely receives a whiff of attention in the media or political culture."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. ''The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas''. Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p. 279, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The greatest damage done by advertising is precisely that it incessantly demonstrates the prostitution of men and women who lend their intellects, their voices, their artistic skills to purposes in which they themselves do not believe, and .... that it helps to shatter and ultimately destroy our most precious non-material possessions: the confidence in the existence of meaningful purposes of human activity and respect for the integrity of man."&lt;ref&gt;Baran, Paul and Sweezy, Paul (1964) "Monopoly Capital" in: McChesney, Robert W. ''The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas''. Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p. 52, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The struggle against advertising is therefore essential if we are to overcome the pervasive alienation from all genuine human needs that currently plays such a corrosive role in our society. But in resisting this type of hyper-commercialism we should not be under any illusions. Advertising may seem at times to be an almost trivial if omnipresent aspect of our economic system. Yet, as economist A. C. Pigou pointed out, it could only be 'removed altogether' if 'conditions of monopolistic competition' inherent to [[corporate capitalism]] were removed. To resist it is to resist the inner logic of capitalism itself, of which it is the pure expression."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. ''The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas''. Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p. 281, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Visual pollution]], much of it in the form of advertising, is an issue in all the world's large cities. But what is pollution to some is a vibrant part of a city's fabric to others. New York City without [[Times Square]]'s huge digital billboards or Tokyo without the [[Ginza]]'s commercial panorama is unthinkable. [[Piccadilly Circus]] would be just a London roundabout without its signage. Still, other cities, like Moscow, have reached their limit and have begun to crack down on over-the-top outdoor advertising.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Downie |first=Andrew |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1709961_1711305_1860002,00.html |title=São Paulo Sells Itself - Inner Workings of the World's Megacities |publisher=TIME |date= 2008-02-08|accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Many communities have chosen to regulate [[billboard]]s to protect and enhance their scenic character. The following is by no means a complete list of such communities. [[Scenic America]] estimates the nationwide total of cities and communities prohibiting the construction of new billboards to be at least 1500.

A number of states in the US prohibit all billboards:
* [[Vermont]] - Removed all billboards in the 1970s
* [[Hawaii]] - Removed all billboards in the 1920s
* [[Maine]] - Removed all billboards in the 1970s and early 80s

Technical appliances, such as [[Spam filters]], TV-Zappers, [[ad blocker]]s for TVs and stickers on mail boxes—"No Advertising"—and an increasing number of court cases indicate a growing interest of people to restrict or rid themselves of unwelcome advertising.

Consumer protection associations, environment protection groups, globalization opponents, consumption critics, sociologists, media critics, scientists and many others deal with the negative aspects of advertising. "Antipub" in France, "[[subvertising]]", [[culture jamming]] and [[adbusting]] have become established terms in the anti-advertising community. On the international level [[anti-globalization|globalization critics]] such as [[Naomi Klein]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] are also renowned media and advertising critics. These groups criticize the complete occupation of public spaces, surfaces, the airwaves, the media, schools etc. and the constant exposure of almost all senses to advertising messages, the invasion of privacy, and that only few consumers are aware that they themselves are bearing the costs for this to the very last penny. Some of these groups, such as the Billboard Liberation Front Creative Group in [[San Francisco]] or [[Adbusters]] in [[Vancouver]], Canada, have manifestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboardliberation.com/manifesto.html |title=Billboard Liberation Front Creative Group |publisher=Billboardliberation.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grassroots organizations campaign against advertising or certain aspects of it in various forms and strategies and quite often have different roots. Adbusters, for example contests and challenges the intended meanings of advertising by subverting them and creating unintended meanings instead. Other groups, like Illegal Signs Canada, try to stem the flood of billboards by detecting and reporting ones that have been put up without permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://illegalsigns.ca/|title=Under Construction illegalsigns.ca|work=illegalsigns.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples for various groups and organizations in different countries are L'association {{ill|Résistance à l'Aggression Publicitaire|fr}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antipub.org/ |title=Résistance À l'Agression Publicitaire |publisher=Antipub.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in France, where media critic [[Jean Baudrillard]] is a renowned author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaed.org |title=Media Education Foundation |publisher=Mediaed.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Anti Advertising Agency]] works with parody and humour to raise awareness about advertising,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antiadvertisingagency.com/ |title=The Anti-Advertising Agency |publisher=The Anti-Advertising Agency |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Commercial Alert]] campaigns for the protection of children, family values, community, environmental integrity and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commercialalert.org/ |title=Commercial Alert — Protecting communities from commercialism |publisher=Commercialalert.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Media literacy]] organisations aim at training people, especially children, in the workings of the media and advertising in their programmes. In the US, for example, the [[Media Education Foundation]] produces and distributes documentary films and other educational resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaed.org/ |title=Media Education Foundation |publisher=Mediaed.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
MediaWatch, a Canadian non-profit women's organization, works to educate consumers about how they can register their concerns with advertisers and regulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediawatch.ca|title=Parked domain page|author=|date=|website=www.mediawatch.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Canadian 'Media Awareness Network/Réseau éducation médias' offers one of the world's most comprehensive collections of media education and Internet literacy resources. Its member organizations represent the public, non-profit but also private sectors. Although it stresses its independence, it accepts financial support from [[Bell Canada]], [[CTVglobemedia]], [[Canwest]], [[Telus]] and [[S-VOX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/|title=MediaSmarts|work=media-awareness.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To counter the increasing criticism of advertising aiming at children media literacy organizations are also initiated and funded by corporations and the advertising business themselves. In the US the Advertising Educational Foundation was created in 1983 supported by ad agencies, advertisers and media companies. It is the "advertising industry's provider and distributor of educational content to enrich the understanding of advertising and its role in culture, society and the economy,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Advertising Educational Foundation |url=http://www.aef.com/index.html |title=Advertising Educational Foundation - Educational Advertising Content |publisher=AEF |date=2008-05-20 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; sponsored for example by [[American Airlines]], [[Anheuser-Busch]], [[Campbell Soup]], [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]], [[Colgate-Palmolive]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[General Foods]], [[General Mills]], [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]], [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]], [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]], [[Kellogg Company|Kellogg's]], [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]], [[Nabisco]], [[Nestlé]], [[Altria|Philip Morris]], [[Quaker Oats]], [[Schering AG|Schering]], [[Sterling Jewelers|Sterling]], [[Unilever]], [[Warner Lambert]], advertising agencies like [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]], and media companies like [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[Capital Cities Communications]], [[Cox Enterprises]], [[Forbes]], [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]], [[Meredith Corporation|Meredith]], [[The New York Times]], [[RCA]]/[[NBC]], [[Reader's Digest]], [[Time (magazine)|Time]], and [[The Washington Post]], just to mention a few.

Canadian businesses established [[Concerned Children's Advertisers]] in 1990 "to instill confidence in all relevant publics by actively demonstrating our commitment, concern, responsibility and respect for children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cca-kids.ca/about_cca/mission_mandate.html |title=Mission and Mandate |publisher=Cca-kids.ca |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members are CanWest, Corus, CTV, General Mills, Hasbro, Hershey's, Kellogg's, Loblaw, Kraft, Mattel, McDonald's, Nestle, Pepsi, Walt Disney, and Weston, as well as almost 50 private broadcast partners and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cca-kids.ca/ |title=Concerned Children's Advertisers |publisher=Cca-kids.ca |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Concerned Children's Advertisers was an example for similar organizations in other countries, like 'Media smart' in the United Kingdom, with offspring in Germany, France, the Netherlands and Sweden. [[New Zealand]] has a similar business-funded programme called Willie Munchright. "While such interventions are claimed to be designed to encourage children to be critical of commercial messages in general, critics of the marketing industry suggest that the motivation is simply to be seen to address a problem created by the industry itself, that is, the negative social impacts to which marketing activity has contributed.... By contributing media literacy education resources, the marketing industry is positioning itself as being part of the solution to these problems, thereby seeking to avoid wide restrictions or outright bans on marketing communication, particularly for food products deemed to have little nutritional value directed at children.... The need to be seen to be taking positive action primarily to avert potential restrictions on advertising is openly acknowledged by some sectors of the industry itself.... Furthermore, Hobbs (1998) suggests that such programs are also in the interest of media organizations that support the interventions to reduce criticism of the potential negative effects of the media themselves."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

There has also been movement that began in Paris, France, called "POP_DOWN PROJECT" in which they equate street advertising to the annoying [[pop-up ads]] on the internet. Their goal is "symbolically restoring everyone's right to non-exposure". They achieve their goal by using stickers of the "Close Window" buttons used to close  [[pop-up ads]].

==Taxation as revenue and control==
Public interest groups suggest that "access to the mental space targeted by advertisers should be taxed, in that at the present moment that space is being freely taken advantage of by advertisers with no compensation paid to the members of the public who are thus being intruded upon. This kind of tax would be a [[Pigovian tax]] in that it would act to reduce what is now increasingly seen as a public nuisance. Efforts to that end are gathering more momentum, with Arkansas and Maine considering bills to implement such a taxation. Florida enacted such a tax in 1987 but was forced to repeal it after six months, as a result of a concerted effort by national commercial interests, which withdrew planned conventions, causing major losses to the tourism industry, and cancelled advertising, causing a loss of 12 million dollars to the broadcast industry alone".{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In the US, for example, advertising is tax deductible and suggestions for possible limits to the advertising tax deduction are met with fierce opposition from the business sector, not to mention suggestions for a special taxation. In other countries, advertising at least is taxed in the same manner services are taxed and in some advertising is subject to special taxation although on a very low level. In many cases the taxation refers especially to media with advertising (e.g. Austria, Italy, Greece, Netherlands, [[Turkey]], [[Estonia]]). Tax on advertising in European countries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/13/082/1308226.asc|title=DIP21.bundestag.de|author=|date=|website=bundestag.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Belgium: Advertising or billboard tax (taxe d'affichage or aanplakkingstaks) on public posters depending on size and kind of paper as well as on neon signs
* France: Tax on television commercials (taxe sur la publicité télévisée) based on the cost of the advertising unit
* Italy: Municipal tax on acoustic and visual kinds of advertisements within the municipality (imposta comunale sulla pubblicità) and municipal tax on signs, posters and other kinds of advertisements (diritti sulle pubbliche affisioni), the tariffs of which are under the jurisdiction of the municipalities
* Netherlands: Advertising tax (reclamebelastingen) with varying tariffs on certain advertising measures (excluding ads in newspapers and magazines) which can be levied by municipalities depending on the kind of advertising (billboards, neon signs etc.)
* Austria:  Municipal announcement levies on advertising through writing, pictures or lights in public areas or publicly accessible areas with varying tariffs depending on the fee, the surface or the duration of the advertising measure as well as advertising tariffs on paid ads in printed media of usually 10% of the fee.
* Sweden: Advertising tax (reklamskatt) on ads and other kinds of advertising (billboards, film, television, advertising at fairs and exhibitions, flyers) in the range of 4% for ads in newspapers and 11% in all other cases. In the case of flyers the tariffs are based on the production costs, else on the fee
* Spain: Municipalities can tax advertising measures in their territory with a rather unimportant taxes and fees of various kinds.
In his book, "[[When Corporations Rule the World]]", US author and [[Anti-globalization movement|globalization critic]]  [[David Korten]] even advocates a 50% tax on advertising to counterattack what he calls "an active propaganda machinery controlled by the world's largest corporations" which "constantly reassures us that [[consumerism]] is the path to happiness, governmental restraint of market excess is the cause of our distress, and economic globalization is both a historical inevitability and a boon to the human species."&lt;ref&gt;Korten, David. (1995) When Corporations Rule the World. 2. Edition 2001: Berrett-Koehler, [[San Francisco, California]], {{ISBN|1-887208-04-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[electromagnetism]], '''current density''' is the [[electric current]] per unit area of cross section. The '''current density vector''' is defined as a [[vector (geometric)|vector]] whose magnitude is the [[electric current]] per cross-sectional area at a given point in space, its direction being that of the motion of the charges at this point. In [[SI unit]]s, the electric current density is measured in [[ampere]]s per [[square metre]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), R.G. Lerner, G.L. Trigg, VHC publishers, 1991, ISBN (Verlagsgesellschaft) 3-527-26954-1, ISBN (VHC Inc.) 0-89573-752-3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Assume that ''A'' (SI unit: [[metre|m]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is a small surface centred at a given point ''M'' and orthogonal to the motion of the charges at ''M''. If ''I''{{sub|''A''}} (SI unit: [[ampere|A]]) is the [[electric current]] flowing through ''A'', then '''electric current density''' ''J'' at ''M'' is given by the [[limit of a function|limit]]:&lt;ref&gt;Essential Principles of Physics, P.M. Whelan, M.J. Hodgeson, 2nd Edition, 1978, John Murray, {{ISBN|0-7195-3382-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;J = \lim\limits_{A \rightarrow 0}\frac{I_A}{A},&lt;/math&gt;

with surface ''A'' remaining centred at ''M'' and orthogonal to the motion of the charges during the limit process.

The '''current density vector''' '''J''' is the vector whose magnitude is the electric current density, and whose direction is the same as the motion of the charges at ''M''.

At a given time ''t'', if '''v''' is the speed of the charges at ''M'', and ''dA'' is an infinitesimal surface centred at ''M'' and orthogonal to '''v''', then during an amount of time ''dt'', only the charge contained in the volume formed by ''dA'' and {{nowrap|1='''l''' = '''v''' ''dt''}} will flow through ''dA''. This charge is equal to {{nowrap|''ρ'' {{!!}}''v''{{!!}} d''t'' d''A''}}, where ''ρ'' is the charge density at ''M'', and the electric current at ''M'' is {{nowrap|1=''I'' = ''ρ'' {{!!}}''v''{{!!}} ''dA''}}. It follows that the current density vector can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;J = \rho \mathbf{v}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[surface integral]] of '''J''' over a [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] ''S'', followed by an integral over the time duration ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, gives the total amount of charge flowing through the surface in that time ({{nowrap|''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}):

:&lt;math&gt;q=\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\iint_S \mathbf{J}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}}\,{\rm d}A{\rm d}t. &lt;/math&gt;

More concisely, this is the integral of the [[flux]] of '''J''' across ''S'' between ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The [[area]] required to calculate the flux is real or imaginary, flat or curved, either as a cross-sectional area or a surface. For example, for charge carriers passing through an [[electrical conductor]], the area is the cross-section of the conductor, at the section considered.

The [[vector area]] is a combination of the magnitude of the area through which the charge carriers pass, ''A'', and a [[unit vector]] normal to the area, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;. The relation is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = A \mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the current density '''J''' passes through the area at an angle ''θ'' to the area normal &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{n}}&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}}= J\cos\theta &lt;/math&gt;

where '''⋅''' is the [[dot product]] of the unit vectors. That is, the component of current density passing through the surface (i.e. normal to it) is {{nowrap|''J'' cos ''θ''}}, while the component of current density passing tangential to the area is {{nowrap|''J'' sin ''θ''}}, but there is ''no'' current density actually passing ''through'' the area in the tangential direction. The ''only'' component of current density passing normal to the area is the cosine component.

==Importance==
Current density is important to the design of electrical and [[electronics|electronic]] systems.

Circuit performance depends strongly upon the designed current level, and the current density then is determined by the dimensions of the conducting elements. For example, as [[integrated circuit]]s are reduced in size, despite the lower current demanded by smaller [[semiconductor devices|devices]], there is a trend toward higher current densities to achieve higher device numbers in ever smaller [[semiconductor chip|chip]] areas. See [[Moore's law]].

At high frequencies, the conducting region in a wire becomes confined near its surface which increases the current density in this region. This is known as the [[skin effect]].  

High current densities have undesirable consequences. Most electrical conductors have a finite, positive [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], making them dissipate [[Power (physics)|power]] in the form of heat.  The current density must be kept sufficiently low to prevent the conductor from melting or burning up, the [[electrical insulator|insulating material]] failing, or the desired electrical properties changing. At high current densities the material forming the interconnections actually moves, a phenomenon called ''[[electromigration]]''.  In [[superconductivity|superconductors]] excessive current density may generate a strong enough magnetic field to cause spontaneous loss of the superconductive property.

The analysis and observation of current density also is used to probe the physics underlying the nature of solids, including not only metals, but also semiconductors and insulators. An elaborate theoretical formalism has developed to explain many fundamental observations.&lt;ref name= Martin&gt;{{cite book |title=Electronic Structure:Basic theory and practical methods |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dmRTFLpSGNsC&amp;pg=PA316&amp;dq=isbn=0-521-78285-6#PPA369,M1 |author=Richard P Martin |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-521-78285-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Altland&gt;{{cite book |title=Condensed Matter Field Theory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0KMkfAMe3JkC&amp;pg=RA4-PA557&amp;dq=isbn=978-0-521-84508-3#PRA2-PA378,M1  |author=Alexander Altland &amp; Ben Simons |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-521-84508-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current density is an important parameter in [[Ampère's circuital law]] (one of [[Maxwell's equations]]), which relates current density to [[magnetic field]].

In [[special relativity]] theory, charge and current are combined into a [[4-vector]].

==Calculation of current densities in matter==

===Free currents===
Charge carriers which are free to move constitute a [[free current]] density, which are given by expressions such as those in this section.

Electric current is a coarse, average quantity that tells what is happening in an entire wire. At position '''r''' at time ''t'', the ''distribution'' of [[electric charge|charge]] flowing is described by the current density:&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Handbook of Physics Formulas, G. Woan, Cambridge University Press, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-521-57507-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{r}, t) = \rho(\mathbf{r},t) \; \mathbf{v}_\text{d} (\mathbf{r},t) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where '''J'''('''r''',&amp;thinsp;''t'') is the current density vector, '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;('''r''',&amp;thinsp;''t'') is the particles' average [[drift velocity]] (SI unit: [[metre|m]]∙[[second|s]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), and

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(\mathbf{r}, t)= qn(\mathbf{r},t) &lt;/math&gt;

is the [[charge density]] (SI unit: coulombs per [[cubic metre]]), in which ''n''('''r''',&amp;thinsp;''t'') is the number of particles per unit volume ("number density") (SI unit: m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;), ''q'' is the charge of the individual particles with density ''n'' (SI unit: [[coulomb]]s).

A common approximation to the current density assumes the current simply is proportional to the electric field, as expressed by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \sigma \mathbf{E} \, &lt;/math&gt;

where '''E''' is the [[electric field]] and ''σ'' is the [[electrical conductivity]].

Conductivity ''σ'' is the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] ([[invertible matrix|inverse]]) of electrical [[resistivity]] and has the SI units of [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] per [[metre]] (S⋅m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and '''E''' has the [[SI]] units of [[newton (unit)|newton]]s per [[coulomb]] (N⋅C&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;) or, equivalently, [[volt]]s per [[metre]] (V⋅m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

A more fundamental approach to calculation of current density is based upon:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} (\mathbf{r}, t) =  \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d}t' \int \mathrm{d}^3\mathbf{r}' \; \sigma(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}', t-t') \; \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}',\ t') \, &lt;/math&gt;

indicating the lag in response by the time dependence of ''σ'', and the non-local nature of response to the field by the spatial dependence of ''σ'', both calculated in principle from an underlying microscopic analysis, for example, in the case of small enough fields, the [[linear response function]] for the conductive behaviour in the material. See, for example, Giuliani or Rammer.&lt;ref name=Giuliani&gt;{{cite book |title=Quantum Theory of the Electron Liquid |author=Gabriele Giuliani, Giovanni Vignale |page=111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kFkIKRfgUpsC&amp;pg=PA538&amp;dq=%22linear+response+theory%22+capacitance+OR+conductance#PPA111,M1 |isbn=0-521-82112-6 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rammer&gt;{{cite book |title=Quantum Field Theory of Non-equilibrium States |author=Jørgen Rammer |page=158 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7TbrAm5Wq0C&amp;pg=PR6&amp;dq=%22linear+response+theory%22+capacitance+OR+conductance#PPA158,M1 |isbn=0-521-87499-8 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The integral extends over the entire past history up to the present time.

The above conductivity and its associated current density reflect the fundamental mechanisms underlying charge transport in the medium, both in time and over distance.

A [[Fourier transform]] in space and time then results in:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} (\mathbf{k}, \omega) = \sigma(\mathbf{k}, \omega) \; \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{k}, \omega) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ''('''k''',&amp;thinsp;''ω'') is now a [[Complex function#Complex functions|complex function]].

In many materials, for example, in crystalline materials, the conductivity is a [[tensor]], and the current is not necessarily in the same direction as the applied field. Aside from the material properties themselves, the application of magnetic fields can alter conductive behaviour.
&lt;!--please leave the following sections alone, don't delete them... --&gt;

===Polarization and magnetization currents===
Currents arise in materials when there is a non-uniform distribution of charge.&lt;ref name="Electromagnetism 2008"&gt;Electromagnetism (2nd Edition), I.S. Grant, W.R. Phillips, Manchester Physics, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-471-92712-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In [[dielectric]] materials, there is a current density corresponding to the net movement of [[electric dipole moment]]s per unit volume, i.e. the [[polarization density|polarization]] '''P''':

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_\mathrm{P}=\frac{\partial \mathbf{P}}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

Similarly with [[magnetic materials]], circulations of the [[magnetic dipole moment]]s per unit volume, i.e. the [[magnetization]] '''M,''' lead to [[magnetization current]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herczynski|first=Andrzej|date=2013|year=|title=Bound charges and currents|url=http://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/schools/cas_sites/physics/pdf/herczynski/AJP-81-202.pdf|journal=American Journal of Physics|publisher=the American Association of Physics Teachers|publication-date=|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1119/1.4773441|bibcode=2013AmJPh..81..202H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_\mathrm{M}=\nabla\times\mathbf{M} &lt;/math&gt;

Together, these terms add up to form the [[bound current]] density in the material (resultant current due to movements of electric and magnetic dipole moments per unit volume):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_\mathrm{b}=\mathbf{J}_\mathrm{P}+\mathbf{J}_\mathrm{M} &lt;/math&gt;

===Total current in materials===

The total current is simply the sum of the free and bound currents:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{J}_\mathrm{f}+\mathbf{J}_\mathrm{b} &lt;/math&gt;

===Displacement current===
There is also a [[displacement current]] corresponding to the time-varying [[electric displacement field]] '''D''':&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Electrodynamics (3rd Edition), D.J. Griffiths, Pearson Education, Dorling Kindersley, 2007, {{ISBN|81-7758-293-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Physics for Scientists and Engineers - with Modern Physics (6th Edition), P. A. Tipler, G. Mosca, Freeman, 2008, {{ISBN|0-7167-8964-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}_\mathrm{D}=\frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

which is an important term in [[Ampere's circuital law]], one of Maxwell's equations, since absence of this term would not predict [[electromagnetic waves]] to propagate, or the time evolution of [[electric field]]s in general.

== Continuity equation ==
{{main|Continuity equation}}
Since charge is conserved, current density must satisfy a [[continuity equation]]. Here is a derivation from first principles.&lt;ref name="Electromagnetism 2008"/&gt;

The net flow out of some volume ''V'' (which can have an arbitrary shape but fixed for the calculation) must equal the net change in charge held inside the volume:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_S{ \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}} = -\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \int_V{\rho \; \mathrm{d}V} = - \int_V{ \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}\;\mathrm{d}V}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ'' is the [[charge density]], and ''d'''A''''' is a [[surface integral|surface element]] of the surface ''S'' enclosing the volume ''V''. The surface integral on the left expresses the current ''outflow'' from the volume, and the negatively signed [[volume integral]] on the right expresses the ''decrease'' in the total charge inside the volume. From the [[divergence theorem]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_S{ \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}} = \int_V{\mathbf{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{J}\;  \mathrm{d}V}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_V{\mathbf{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{J}\; \mathrm{d}V}\ = - \int_V{ \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} \;\mathrm{d}V}&lt;/math&gt;

This relation is valid for any volume, independent of size or location, which implies that:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = - \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

and this relation is called the [[continuity equation]].&lt;ref name=Chow&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Electromagnetic Theory: A modern perspective |author = Tai L Chow |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dpnpMhw1zo8C&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=isbn=0-7637-3827-1#PPA204,M1 |isbn=0-7637-3827-1 |year=2006 |pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Griffiths&gt;{{cite book |author= Griffiths, D.J. |title=Introduction to Electrodynamics |page=213 |publisher=Pearson/Addison-Wesley |year=1999 |isbn=0-13-805326-X |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In practice ==
In [[electrical wiring]], the maximum current density can vary from 4&amp;nbsp;A⋅mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; for a wire with no air circulation around it,  to 6&amp;nbsp;A⋅mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; for a wire in free air. Regulations for [[building wiring]] list the maximum allowed current of each size of cable in differing conditions. For compact designs, such as windings of [[Switched-mode power supply|SMPS transformers]], the value might be as low as 2&amp;nbsp;A⋅mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=A. Pressman |display-authors=etal |title=Switching power supply design |edition=3rd |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-07-148272-1 |year=2009 |page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the wire is carrying high frequency currents, the [[skin effect]] may affect the distribution of the current across the section by concentrating the current on the surface of the [[electrical conductor|conductor]]. In [[transformer]]s designed for high frequencies, loss is reduced if [[Litz wire]] is used for the windings. This is made of multiple isolated wires in parallel with a diameter twice the [[skin depth]]. The isolated strands are twisted together to increase the total skin area and to reduce the [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] due to skin effects.

For the top and bottom layers of [[printed circuit boards]],  the maximum current density can be as high as 35&amp;nbsp;A⋅mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; with a copper thickness of 35&amp;nbsp;μm. Inner layers cannot dissipate as much heat as outer layers; designers of circuit  boards avoid putting high-current traces on inner layers.

In the [[semiconductors]] field, the maximum current densities for different elements are given by the manufacturer. Exceeding those limits raises the following problems:
* The [[Joule heating|joule effect]] which increases the temperature of the component.
* The [[electromigration|electromigration effect]] which will erode the interconnection and eventually cause an open circuit.
* The slow [[diffusion|diffusion effect]] which, if exposed to high temperatures continuously, will move metallic ions and [[Doping_(semiconductor)|dopants]] away from where they should be. This effect is also synonym to ageing.

The following table gives an idea of the maximum current density for various materials.

Even if manufacturers add some margin to their numbers, it is recommended to, at least, double the calculated section to improve the reliability, especially for high quality electronics. One can also notice the importance to keep electronic devices cool to avoid them to be exposed to [[electromigration]] and slow [[diffusion]].

In [[biological organism]]s, [[ion channel]]s regulate the flow of [[ion]]s (for example, [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[potassium]]) across the [[Cell membrane|membrane]] in all [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. Current density is measured in pA⋅pF&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Metric prefix|pico]][[ampere]]s per [[Metric prefix|pico]][[farad]]), that is, current divided by [[capacitance]], a de facto measure of membrane area.{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}

In [[gas discharge lamp]]s, such as [[flashlamp]]s, current density plays an important role in the output [[spectroscopy|spectrum]] produced. Low current densities produce [[spectral line]] [[emission spectrum|emission]] and tend to favour longer [[wavelength]]s. High current densities produce continuum emission and tend to favour shorter wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;[https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/1811/5654/1/V71N06_343.pdf Xenon lamp photocathodes]&lt;/ref&gt; Low current densities for flash lamps are generally around 10&amp;nbsp;A⋅mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. High current densities can be more than 40&amp;nbsp;A⋅mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1694">A '''design competition''' is a [[competition]] in which an entity solicits design proposals from the public for a specified purpose.

==Architecture==
An [[architectural design competition]] solicits architects to submit design proposals for a building, bridge, or other structure. Such competitions may be ''open'', receiving bids internationally, domestically, or regionally. The competition may occur in a single stage, or involve two stages, the first of which eliminates non-viable candidates.

Famous early examples of design competitions were for the [[Acropolis of Athens]] in 448 BCE, and the dome of the [[Florence Cathedral]] in 1418.

==Coins and stamps==
Coin and stamp design contests solicit designs to appear on the face of stamps and usually the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] of coins. In 1998, the [[Royal Canadian Mint]] held the Millennium Coin Design Contest, a competition for the design of 24 [[Quarter (Canadian coin)|quarters]], one for each month of 1999 and 2000.&lt;!-- was this a project of the Millennium Bureau of Canada ? --&gt;

==Monuments and sculptures==
The design of artistic objects and monuments is a common subject in design competitions. A well-known example is the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in [[Washington D.C.]] designed by [[Maya Lin]].

==Urban space==
Urban and landscape projects may solicit design proposals in a competition. Among them are projects for urban parks, streetscapes, and rehabilitation of natural areas.

==Student design competition==
A [[student design competition]] is a [[student competition]] to introduce students to real-world engineering practices and design.

In applied mathematics, the '''devex algorithm''' is a pivot rule for the [[simplex method]] developed by Harris.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Paula MJ. "[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01580108 Pivot selection methods of the Devex LP code]." Mathematical programming 5.1 (1973): 1–28.&lt;/ref&gt; It identifies the steepest-edge approximately in its search for the optimal solution.&lt;ref&gt;Forrest, John J., and [[Donald Goldfarb]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10837">'''Difference''' is a key [[concept]] of [[philosophy]], denoting the process or set of [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] by which one [[entity]] is distinguished from another within a [[Relational theory|relational]] field or a given [[conceptual system]]. In the [[Western philosophy|Western philosophical system]], difference is traditionally viewed as being opposed to [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]], following the [[Gottfried Leibniz#The Principles|Principles of Leibniz]], and in particular, his Law of the [[identity of indiscernibles]]. In [[structuralism|structuralist]] and [[poststructuralism|poststructuralist]] accounts, however, difference is understood to be ''constitutive'' of both meaning and identity. In other words, because identity (particularly, [[personal identity]]) is viewed in [[non-essentialism|non-essentialist]] terms as a construct, and because constructs only produce meaning through the interplay of differences (see below), it is the case that for both [[structuralism]] and [[poststructuralism]], identity cannot be said to exist without difference.

==Difference in Leibniz's law==
[[Gottfried Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz's]] Principle of the [[identity of indiscernibles]] states that two things are identical if and only if they share the same and only the same properties. This is a principle which defines identity rather than difference, although it established the tradition in [[logic]] and [[analytical philosophy]] of conceiving of identity and difference as oppositional.

==Kant's critique==
In his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', [[Immanuel Kant]] argues that it is necessary to distinguish between the thing in itself and its appearance. Even if two objects have completely the same properties, if they are at two different places at the same time, they are numerically different:
{{Quote|''Identity and Difference''.— [...] Thus, in the case of two drops of water, we may make complete abstraction of all internal difference (quality and quantity), and, the fact that they are intuited at the same time in different places, is sufficient to justify us in holding them to be numerically different. {{sic|[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibnitz]]}} regarded phaenomena as things in themselves, consequently as {{lang|la|intelligibilia}}, that is, objects of pure understanding [...], and in this case his principle of the indiscernible ({{lang|la|principium identatis indiscernibilium}}) is not to be impugned. But, as phaenomena are objects of sensibility, and, as the understanding, in respect of them, must be employed empirically and not purely or transcendentally, plurality and numerical difference are given by space itself as the condition of external phaenomena. For one part of space, although it may be perfectly similar and equal to another part, is still without it, and for this reason alone is different from the latter [...]. It follows that this must hold good of all things that are in the different parts of space at the same time, however similar and equal one may be to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|title=Critique of Pure Reason|origyear=1781|year=1855|others=Trans. by [[J. M. D. Meiklejohn]]|publisher=Henry G. Bohn|location=London|page=191|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E74IAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA191}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Difference in structuralism ==
[[Structural linguistics]], and subsequently [[structuralism]] proper, are founded on the idea that meaning can only be produced differentially in signifying systems (such as language). This concept first came to prominence in the [[structuralism|structuralist]] writings of Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and was developed for the analysis of social and mental structures by French [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]].

The former was concerned to question the prevailing view of meaning "inhering" in words, or the idea that language is a [[nomenclature]] bearing a one-to-one correspondence to the real. Instead, Saussure argues that meaning arises through differentiation of one [[sign]] from another, or even of one [[phoneme]] from another:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In language there are only differences. Even more important: a difference generally implies positive terms between which the difference is set up; but in language there are only differences without positive terms. Whether we take the signified or the signifier, language has neither ideas nor sounds that existed before the linguistic system, but only conceptual and phonic differences that have issued from the system. The idea or phonic substance that a sign contains is of less importance than the other signs that surround it. [...] A linguistic system is a series of differences of sound combined with a series of differences of ideas; but the pairing of a certain number of acoustical signs with as many cuts made from the mass thought engenders a system of values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saussure|first=Ferdinand de|title=Course in General Linguistics|origyear=1916 |year=1959|publisher=New York Philosophical Library|location=New York|pages=121–22|url=http://faculty.smu.edu/dfoster/cf3324/saussure.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his ''[[Structural Anthropology]]'', [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] applied this concept to the anthropological study of mental structures, [[kinship]] and [[belief systems]], examining the way in which social meaning emerges through a series of structural oppositions between paired/opposed kinship groups, for example, or between basic oppositional categories (such as friend and enemy, life and death, or in a later volume, [[The Raw and the Cooked|the raw and the cooked]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lévi-Strauss|first=Claude|title=Structural Anthropology|origyear=1958 |year=1963|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lévi-Strauss|first=Claude|title=The Raw and the Cooked|origyear=1964 |year=1970|publisher=Cape|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difference and {{lang|fr|différance}} in poststructuralism&lt;!--'Difference (poststructuralism)' redirects here; linked from 'Template:Deleuze-Guattari'--&gt;==
{{also|Alterity}}
The French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] both extended and profoundly critiqued structuralist thought on the processes by which meaning is produced through the interplay of difference in language, and in particular, writing. Whereas structuralist linguistics had recognized that meaning is differential, much structuralist thought, such as [[narratology]], had become too focused on identifying and producing a typology of the fixed differential structures and [[binary oppositions]] at work in any given system. In his work, Derrida sought to show how the differences on which any signifying system depends are not fixed, but get caught up and entangled with each other. Writing itself becomes the prototype of this process of entanglement, and in ''[[Of Grammatology]]'' (1967) and "{{lang|fr|Différance|italic=no}}" (in ''Margins of Philosophy'', 1972) Derrida shows how the concept of writing (as the paradoxical absence or de-presencing of the living voice) has been subordinated to the desired "full presence" of speech within the Western philosophical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Derrida|first=Jacques|title=Of Grammatology|origyear=1967 |year=1976|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Margins"&gt;{{cite book|last=Derrida|first=Jacques|title=Margins of Philosophy|origyear=1972 |year=1982|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=3–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early thought on the relationship between writing and difference is collected in his book of essays entitled ''[[Writing and Difference]]'' (1967).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Derrida|first=Jacques|title=Writing and Difference|origyear=1967 |year=1978|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere, Derrida coined the term {{lang|fr|[[différance]]}} (a deliberate misspelling of {{lang|fr|différence}}) in order to provide a conceptual hook for his thinking on the meaning processes at work within writing/language.&lt;ref name="Margins"/&gt; This [[neologism]] is a play on the two meanings of the French word {{lang|fr|différer}}: to differ and to defer. Derrida thereby argues that meaning does not arise out of fixed differences between static elements in a structure, but that the meanings produced in language and other signifying systems are always partial, provisional and infinitely deferred along a chain of differing/deferring [[Sign (semiotics)|signifiers]]. At the same time, the word {{lang|fr|différance}} itself ''performs'' this entanglement and confusion of differential meanings, for it depends on a minimal difference (the substitution of the letter "a" for the letter "e") which cannot be apprehended in oral speech, since the suffixes "-ance" and "-ence" have the same pronunciation in French. The "[[phonemic]]" (non-)difference between {{lang|fr|différence}} and {{lang|fr|différance}} can only be observed in writing, hence producing differential meaning only in a partial, deferred and entangled manner.

{{lang|fr|Différance}} has been defined as "the non-originary, constituting-disruption of presence": spatially, it differs, creating spaces, ruptures, and differences and temporally, it defers, delaying presence from ever being fully attained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/diff-ont/ "Differential Ontology"] at the [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida's criticism of [[essentialist]] [[ontology]] draws on the differential ontology of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (who introduced the concept of {{lang|de|Verschiedenheit}}, "difference", in his unpublished manuscripts (''[[:de:Nietzsche-Ausgabe|KSA]]'' 11:35[58], p. 537)) and [[Emmanuel Levinas]] (who proposed an ethics of the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]]).&lt;ref name="Margins"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas L. Donkel, ''The Theory of Difference: Readings in Contemporary Continental Thought'', SUNY Press, 2001, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a similar vein, [[Gilles Deleuze]]'s ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'' (1968) was an attempt to think difference as having an [[ontological]] privilege over identity, inverting the traditional relationship between those two concepts and implying that identities are only produced through processes of differentiation.

A '''Domestic Abuse Restraining Order''' (DARO) is a form of [[restraining order]] or [[order of protection]] used under the [[domestic abuse]] laws of the state of [[Wisconsin]]&lt;ref name="dvro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Domestic Abuse Restraining Order|url=http://www.womenslaw.org/laws_state_type.php?id=609&amp;state_code=WI|work=Women'sLaw.Org|publisher=National Network to end Domestic Violence|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="domabusewislegis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Domestic abuse restraining orders and injunctions|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/813/12|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enforceable nationwide under invocation of the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]] in the [[Violence Against Women Act]] ({{UnitedStatesCode|18|2265}}).  It is a legal intervention in which one person (the respondent) who is deemed to be hurting, threatening or stalking another person (the petitioner) is ordered to stop—and often cease all direct and indirect contact—with the goal of reducing risk of further threat or harm to the petitioner.  The petitioner and respondent will generally be in certain specific relationships such as a spousal or sexual relationship.  If the petitioner is in an unwanted stalking relationship with the respondent, however, a closely related form of injunction, a '''Harassment Restraining Order''' (HRO) may be more appropriate.&lt;ref name="hro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harassment Restraining Order|url=http://www.womenslaw.org/laws_state_type.php?id=12418&amp;state_code=WI|work=Women'sLaw.Org|publisher=National Network to end Domestic Violence|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wislegis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harassment restraining orders and injunctions|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/813/125|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 813.12, domestic abuse for the purposes of obtaining either type of restraining order is defined to include intentional infliction of physical pain, physical injury or illness;  intentional impairment of physical condition;  [[sexual intercourse]] under Wis.

In Wisconsin there are similar processes for obtaining a domestic violence or harassment restraining order.&lt;ref name="hro"/&gt;  The first step is ordinarily for the woman—the Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence generally refers to petitioners as female as most are women&lt;ref name="gender"&gt;{{cite web|title=Process for Obtaining a Restraining Order in Wisconsin|url=http://www.endabusewi.org/sites/default/files/resources/process_for_obtaining_a_restraining_order.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310232414/http://www.endabusewi.org/sites/default/files/resources/process_for_obtaining_a_restraining_order.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 March 2016|work=WCADV|publisher=Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence|accessdate=12 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;—to file an initial petition with the court.&lt;ref name="dvro"/&gt; It is free of charge to file a petition for a domestic abuse restraining order.  The harassment restraining order sometimes requires a fee but this is waived if the abuse also qualifies as domestic abuse, which it often does.  The woman often begins the process under extreme stress and overwhelmed with emotion.  She must provide a detailed written statement of the facts supporting the granting of the order.&lt;ref name="montecarloanalysis"/&gt;  She may request that a temporary restraining order be granted for a period of up to 14 days.  The temporary restraining order may be granted [[ex parte]]—without the abuser having the opportunity to appear in court.  Unlike in some states, in Wisconsin an ex parte order can be granted on the basis of past abuse, with no further evidence of the likelihood of future abuse being needed.&lt;ref name="wrecking"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stark|first1=Debra|last2=Choplin|first2=Jessica|title=Seeing the Wrecking Ball in Motion: Ex Parte Protection Orders and the Realities of Domestic Violence|url=https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1672&amp;context=facpubs|date=2017|work=[[University of Wisconsin Law School|Wisconsin Journal of Law, Gender &amp; Society]]|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin Law School]]|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The woman will also request that a full hearing—at which the abuser will be present—be held to determine whether to grant a permanent restraining order.&lt;ref name="dvro"/&gt;  Wisconsin courts will have jurisdiction to hear the case if the petitioner resides in Wisconsin--even if the respondent does not also reside in Wisconsin.&lt;ref name="jurisdiction"&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal jurisdiction, grounds for generally|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/801/05|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=24 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temporary restraining order does not go into effect until it is served to the person being restrained. Serving the restraining order is the responsibility of the [[petitioner]]. Service can be carried out by the [[Sheriffs in the United States|Sheriff's Department]] of the county where the harasser lives or works, or by any adult who is not a party named in the case.&lt;ref name="dvro"/&gt;  Judges are assigned to restraining order hearings on a rotating basis, with each judge handling restraining order hearings for one week every few months.  At the full hearing, petitioners are seated on one side of the courtroom, and respondents on the other side.  The hearing usually lasts about 15–30 minutes.&lt;ref name="montecarloanalysis"/&gt;  At the hearing, both parties will have an opportunity to testify and present evidence, and the judge will make a decision.  The permanent restraining order, if granted, may be in effect for up to four years, and the judge must, if granting it, grant it for as long as the petitioner requests up to four years.&lt;ref name="wislegis"/&gt;  The order may also be granted, or extended, up to ten years if there is a substantial risk that the respondent may commit [[homicide]] or [[sexual assault]] against the petitioner.&lt;ref name="wcadvrestrainingordergrid"/&gt;  Respondents are supposed to be held by the bailiff for 15 minutes after the hearing ends to allow petitioners to leave safely, but this rule isn't always followed.&lt;ref name="montecarloanalysis"/&gt;

An HRO or DARO can require the harasser to stop harassing the victim, and/or avoid the victim's residence or temporary place of accommodation.&lt;ref name="hro"/&gt;  Like a DARO, subsequent to 17 April 2014, an HRO may also require that the harasser avoid all contact with the victim.&lt;ref name="act2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Wisconsin Act 322|url=https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2013/related/acts/322|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=24 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GPS monitoring for respondents==
Wisconsin is considering requiring [[Ankle monitor|GPS monitoring]] for all persons subject to a harassment or domestic abuse restraining order.  At the present time, a pilot program will provide funds for testing such a program in some counties before it is implemented statewide.&lt;ref name="wsj27"&gt;{{cite web|title=State budget committee rejects GPS monitoring expansion|url=http://host.madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/state-budget-committee-rejects-gps-monitoring-expansion/article_17f6213e-5584-5d90-9e57-81b4f147a89b.html|publisher=Wisconsin State Journal|accessdate=14 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wislegis27"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global positioning system pilot programs; grants|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/165/94|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=14 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once implemented, the program would make Wisconsin the only state in the country to order GPS monitoring for those who are under, but who have not violated, a restraining order.  The program has not yet been implemented by the [[Wisconsin Department of Justice]] ('''DOJ'''), however.  The DOJ claims that current law does not permit judges to order [[GPS tracking unit|GPS tracking]] for those who have not violated a restraining order.  The governor's office has pledged to tweak the language in the next budget so the program can go ahead.&lt;ref name="doj"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin DOJ never launched GPS program|url=http://host.madison.com/news/state-and-regional/wisconsin-doj-never-launched-gps-program/article_0c4fb21e-e3b5-5795-bb95-6a4f3baf8b1f.html|publisher=Madison.com|accessdate=19 Sep 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140920002332/http://host.madison.com/news/state-and-regional/wisconsin-doj-never-launched-gps-program/article_0c4fb21e-e3b5-5795-bb95-6a4f3baf8b1f.html|archivedate=2014-09-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punishment for violation==
Law enforcement must make an arrest if they have probable cause to believe that the abuser has violated a HRO or DARO.  Upon conviction, the penalty is a fine of up to $10,000 and/or a prison term of up to 9 months.&lt;ref name="wislegis"/&gt;  Violators may be subject to [[Ankle monitor|global positioning system tracking]] based upon a risk assessment by the department of corrections.  The victim may be referred to a [[domestic violence]] or sexual assault victim service provider.&lt;ref name="wislegis2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global positioning system tracking|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/813/129|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=5 Jul 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An [[exclusion zone]] will be created which the violator is not permitted to enter under GPS tracking.&lt;ref name="wislegisexclusionzone"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global positioning system tracking for persons who violate certain orders or injunctions|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/301/49|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NCIC registration and firearms restrictions==
The HRO or DARO will generally be registered in the Protection Order File of the [[National Crime Information Center]].  At the state level, a domestic abuse restraining order will automatically trigger a restriction on owning or possessing firearms.  For a harassment restraining order, such restrictions are at the discretion of the judge granting the order and are not automatic.

Federal restrictions on firearms may also apply.  The NCIC entry will include a "Brady indicator" indicating whether the restrained person is prohibited from owning firearms under federal law, with a "Y" indicating yes (the restrictions do apply), "N" for no, and "U" for unknown.  Generally the Brady indicator will be set to "Y" only if certain relationships exist between the parties, such as a sexual/romantic relationship or a parent/child relationship.  If the restraining order does not specify the relationship, an attempt is made to determine the relationship from other available data before setting it to "U".&lt;ref name="brady"&gt;{{cite web|title=Protection Orders and Federal Firearms Prohibitions|url=http://www.atf.gov/files/publications/download/i/atf-i-3310-2.pdf|work=www.atf.gov|publisher=Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|accessdate=22 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The federal Brady indicator restrictions, which are automatic if, and only if, certain conditions apply are distinct from possible state restrictions on HRO or DARO respondents possessing firearms.  For an HRO, a state restriction on the respondent possessing firearms will depend on whether the judge, at his or her discretion, feels the respondent is a risk to use a firearm to harm others, but it is not automatic.&lt;ref name="wcadvrestrainingordergrid"/&gt;

==Types of Restraining Orders in Wisconsin==
The domestic abuse and harassment restraining orders are among the several types of restraining orders used in Wisconsin.  The DARO is similar to the HRO but requires that certain specific relationships exist or did exist between the parties.&lt;ref name="dvro"/&gt;  The child abuse restraining order is also similar but is used where the victim of the abuse is a minor.&lt;ref name="caro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Abuse Restraining Order|url=http://www.womenslaw.org/laws_state_type.php?id=12360&amp;state_code=WI|work=Women'sLaw.Org|publisher=National Network to end Domestic Violence|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the HRO, both the domestic abuse and child abuse restraining orders carry an automatic requirement not to possess firearms under state law.&lt;ref name="wcadvrestrainingordergrid"/&gt;  The individual at risk restraining order is a restraining order designed to protect adults with significant impairment in their ability to care for themselves.&lt;ref name="iarro"&gt;{{cite web|title=Individual at Risk Restraining Order|url=http://www.womenslaw.org/laws_state_type.php?id=12425&amp;state_code=WI|work=Women'sLaw.Org|publisher=National Network to end Domestic Violence|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The petitioner will sometimes have a choice as to whether to file a domestic abuse or harassment restraining order.  The differences between the two orders have grown less over the years.  In the past the penalties were less for violating a harassment restraining order, and a full no contact order could not be issued in a harassment restraining order hearing.  A petitioner whose request for a temporary restraining order was denied was formerly entitled to a later injunction hearing only for domestic abuse restraining orders.  If the respondent and petitioner shared a residence, the respondent could, in the past, not be ordered to avoid that residence under a harassment restraining order.  These differences have been significantly reduced.  Harassment and domestic abuse restraining orders now have the same penalties for violation, and a full no contact order can now be made in either case.  The respondent can now be ordered to avoid the petitioner's residence in either case.  A full hearing will now be granted in either case even if the temporary order is denied provided that, in the case of a harassment restraining order, the harassment also meets the definition of domestic abuse.&lt;ref name="meuer1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Meuer|first=Tess|title=Harassment Orders Become More Parallel to Domestic Abuse Orders|url=http://www.endabusewi.org/FileStream.aspx?FileID=84|publisher=Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence|date=Jan 2010|page=9|accessdate=24 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="act2013"/&gt;  The significant difference between the two types of orders that remains is the fact that the domestic abuse order carries an automatic firearms ban, while the harassment order does not.  Sometimes petitioners who are eligible for both will opt for the harassment order because they don't want to force the respondents to give up their firearms.  This can carry significant risks for petitioners, as guns are the most common cause of domestic abuse homicides in Wisconsin.  Between 2000 and 2010, there were 213 domestic abuse murders in Wisconsin by guns, more than the 194 murders by knives, other weapons, or other means combined.  As such, a petitioner stipulating to a harassment restraining order rather than a domestic abuse order must be questioned to the judge as to whether she entered into the stipulation voluntarily and understands the differences between the two types of orders.  The petitioner must be fully informed of the consequences of opting for a harassment restraining order.&lt;ref name="meuer1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="meuer2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Meuer|first=Tess|title=Conversion from Domestic Abuse to Harassement|url=http://www.endabusewi.org/FileStream.aspx?FileID=84|publisher=Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence|date=Jan 2010|page=11|accessdate=24 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="homicide-report-2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin Domestic Violence Homicide Report 2010|url=http://www.endabusewi.org/FileStream.aspx?FileID=53|publisher=Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence|date=2011|page=34|accessdate=24 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="domabusewislegis"/&gt;

Out of state orders, including from any [[U.S. state|state]], the [[District of Columbia]], [[Puerto Rico]], the [[United States Virgin Islands]], a [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States#Tribal courts|tribal court]],&lt;ref name="out-of-state"&gt;{{cite web|title=Uniform interstate enforcement of domestic violence protection orders act|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/813/128|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province or territory]] of [[Canada]],&lt;ref name="out-of-state-canada"&gt;{{cite web|title=Uniform Recognition and Enforcement of Canadian Domestic Violence Protection Orders Act|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/813/1283|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be enforced in Wisconsin with similar penalties for violation as if the out of state order was actually a Wisconsin domestic abuse restraining order.

==Petitioner success rates==
A 2006 Wisconsin study showed that female petitioners were successful about 62 percent of the time in seeking restraining orders at the full hearing where the respondents had the chance to be present.  The success rate appeared to be higher if the petitioners were represented by advocates or attorneys.&lt;ref name="montecarloanalysis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legalaidresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/Research-Increasing-Access-to-REstraining-Order-for-Low-Income-Victims-of-DV-A-Cost-Benefit-Analysis-of-the-Proposed-Domestic-Abuse-Grant-Program.pdf| title=Increasing Access to Restraining Orders for Low Income Victims of Domestic Violence:  A Cost-Benefit Analysis of the Proposed Domestic Abuse Grant Program |publisher=[[State Bar of Wisconsin]] |date=December 2006 |accessdate=2016-12-12|last1=Elwart|first1=Liz|last2=Emerson|first2=Nina|last3=Enders|first3=Christina|last4=Fumia|first4=Dani|last5=Murphy|first5=Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
Experts disagree on whether restraining orders are effective in preventing further harassment. A 2010 analysis published in the ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law]]'' reviewed 15 U.S. studies of restraining order effectiveness, and concluded that restraining orders "can serve a useful role in threat management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benitez, MD|first1=Christopher T.|last2=McNiel, PhD|first2=Dale E.|last3=Binder, MD|first3=Renée L.|title=Do Protection Orders Protect?|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and Law|year=2010|volume=38|series=3|pages=376–385|url=http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/content/full/38/3/376|accessdate=14 June 2011|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2002 analysis of 32 U.S. studies found that restraining orders are violated an average of 40 per cent of the time and are perceived as being "followed by worse events" almost 21 per cent of the time, and concluded that "evidence of [restraining orders'] relative efficacy is lacking," and that they may pose some degree of risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spitzberg|first=Brian H.|title=The Tactical Topography of Stalking Victimization and Management|journal=Trauma, Violence and Abuse|date=October 2002|volume=3|series=4|pages=261–288|url=http://tva.sagepub.com/content/3/4/261.full.pdf+html|accessdate=14 June 2011|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large America-wide [[Statistical_survey#Telephone|telephone survey]] conducted in 1998 found that, of stalking victims who obtained a restraining order, more than 68 per cent reported it being violated by their stalker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tjaden|first=P.|author2=Thoennes, N.|title=Stalking In America: Findings From the National Violence Against Women Survey|journal=National Institute of Justice and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date=April 1998|issue=NCJ 169592|pages=1–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Threat management experts are often suspicious of restraining orders, believing they may escalate or enrage stalkers. In his 1997 book ''[[The Gift of Fear|The Gift Of Fear]]'', well-known American security specialist [[Gavin de Becker]] characterized restraining orders as "homework assignments police give to women to prove they're really committed to getting away from their pursuers," and said they "clearly serve police and prosecutors," but "they do not always serve victims."  De Becker also observed that restraining orders are most effective when the emotional involvement is lowest—for example, when used following a brief, unsatisfactory, dating relationship as opposed to with an ex-spouse.  In the case of stalking, de Becker advised that restraining orders are most effective if the woman rejects once, and then obtains the restraining order immediately following any further unwanted contact.  If she continues to allow contact for an extended period after an initial firm rejection, any eventual restraining order may be less effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Becker|first=Gavin|title=The Gift Of Fear And Other Survival Signals That Will Protect Us From Violence|year=1997|publisher=Dell Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0-440-22619-8|pages=223–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Festival Internacional da Linguagem Eletrônica - 2006 banner.jpg|thumb|250px|Electronic Language international Festival]]
The '''Festival Internacional de Linguagem Eletrônica''' ('''FILE'''; English: '''Electronic Language International Festival''') is a [[New media art]] festival that usually takes place in three different cities of Brazil: São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre and it has also participated in other events around the world. It is the biggest art &amp; technology festival in Brazil, and it serves as a lead indicator of the plurality of the work created in the interactive art field not only nationally but also internationally.&lt;ref name="Globo-17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Festival Internacional de Linguagem Eletrônica começa em SP|url=http://g1.globo.com/sao-paulo/noticia/2015/06/festival-internacional-de-linguagem-eletronica-comeca-em-spp.html|website=globo.com|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FILE festival is split in different areas of interest, although some overlap and sub-categorization occurs. The main groups of interest are:

* FILE Prix Lux is an international prize that is granted to professionals in the area of electronic-digital languages. It grants seven prizes (first place, second place, and five honorable mentions) to each of three categories that are: Interactive Art, Digital Language, and Electronic Sonority. Besides the jury's selection, there is a popular vote through the FILE Prix Lux website.
* FILE PAI (Paulista Avenue Interactive = Interactive Public Art) is a project of digital public art that occupies several spaces at Paulista Avenue with interactive works of art. It intends to highlight the significance of interactive public art in order to understand and to absorb the new social phenomena provided by technology and, thus, to constitute strategies to interconnect with those new mass behaviors.&lt;ref name="Globo-2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Em sua 11ª edição, File mostra arte e tecnologia pela Avenida Paulista|url=http://g1.globo.com/pop-arte/noticia/2010/07/em-sua-11-edicao-file-mostra-arte-e-tecnologia-pela-avenida-paulista.html|website=globo.com|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="outdoorArt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Avenida Paulista recebe 12 obras interativas de arte eletrônica|url=http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/cultura/avenida-paulista-recebe-12-obras-interativas-de-arte-eletronica/n1237728874657.html|website=ig.com.br|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* FILE Exhibition shows a great diversity of national and international research and productions. Artists - among groups, collectives and individual works – participate with productions in the areas of digital culture. In the exhibition, FILE presents some digital and interactive installations, FILE Media Art works, Hypersonica and others. 
* FILE Media Art presents digital works that propose different ways to explore new technologies as ways of creation and interaction. Films, sites, web and software art show that with digital art, technology can be more than its usual functionality.
* FILE Hipersonica explores the role of music in a technological culture with audio and visual performances.
* FILE Symposium is a collection of lectures by leading artists and technologists on the new media art field.
* FILE Games brings a repertoire of experimental and artistic electronic games.

An '''empirical theory of perception''' is a kind of explanation for how [[percept]]s arise. These theories hold that sensory systems incorporate information about the statistical properties of the natural world into their design and relate incoming stimuli to this information, rather than analyzing sensory stimulation into its components or [[Feature detection (nervous system)|features]].

== Empirical accounts of vision ==
[[Visual perception]] is initiated when objects in the world reflect light [[Ray (optics)|rays]] towards the eye. Most empirical theories of visual perception begin with the observation that stimulation of the [[retina]] is fundamentally ambiguous. In empirical accounts, the most commonly proposed mechanism for circumventing this ambiguity is "[[unconscious inference]]," a term that dates back to [[Helmholtz]].

According to Hatfield,&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield, Gary. Perception as Unconscious Inference. Accessed from http://repository.upenn.edu/ircs_reports/9/ .&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alhazen#Book of Optics|Alhazen]] was the first to propose that higher-level cognitive processes ("judgments") could supplement sense perception to lead to veridical perception of distance, suggesting that these "judgments" are formally equivalent to [[syllogisms]]. [[Descartes]] extended and refined this account. [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] departed from this tradition, putting forth the new idea that sensory systems, rather than performing logical operations on stimuli to reach veridical conclusions (i.e. these light rays come with certain orientations relative to each other, therefore their source is at a certain distance), make ''associations'', so that for instance if certain co-occurring sensory attributes are usually present when an object is at a given distance an observer would see an object with those attributes as being at that distance. For Helmholtz Berkeleyan associations form the premises for inductive "judgements," in Alhazen's sense of the term. [[Helmholtz]] was one of the first thinkers on the subject to augment his reasoning with detailed knowledge of the anatomy of sensory mechanisms.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In current work Helmholtz's use of the term is construed as referring to some mechanism that augments sense impressions with acquired knowledge or through application of [[heuristics]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} In general, contemporary empirical theories of perception seek to describe and/or explain the physiological underpinnings of this "unconscious inference," particularly in terms of how sensory systems acquire information about general statistical features of their environments (see [[natural scene statistics]]) and apply this information to sensory data in order to shape perception. A recurring theme in these theories is that stimulus ambiguity is rectified by ''a priori'' knowledge about the natural world.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Wholly empirical approach to visual perception==
The wholly empirical approach to perception, developed by [[Dale Purves]] and his colleagues, holds that percepts are determined solely by evolutionary and individual experience with sensory impressions and the objects from which they derive. The success or failure of behavior in response to these sensory impressions tends to increase the prevalence of neural structures that support some ways of interpreting sensory input while decreasing the prevalence of neural structures that support other ways of interpreting sensory input.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Purves|first=Dale|last2=Monson|first2=Brian B.|last3=Sundararajan|first3=Janani|last4=Wojtach|first4=William T.|date=2014-04-01|title=How biological vision succeeds in the physical world|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/13/4750|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=111|issue=13|pages=4750–4755|doi=10.1073/pnas.1311309111|issn=0027-8424|pmc=3977276|pmid=24639506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the wholly empirical account, this strategy determines qualities of perception in all visual domains and sensory modalities. Accumulating evidence suggests that the perception of color,&lt;ref&gt;Perceiving Colour. Lotto RB, Purves D. Review of Progress in Coloration 34:12-25.

=== The wholly empirical strategy ===
{{inappropriate person|date=March 2013}}

The wholly empirical theory of perception departs from many other empirical theories by recognizing the seriousness of the [[inverse problem in optics|optical inverse problem]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} To illustrate this problem, imagine that three hoses are used to fill a bucket with water. If how much water each hose has contributed is known, it is straightforward to calculate how much water is in the bucket. These kinds of problems are known as “forward” problems, and scientists like them because they are easy to solve. But if instead, all that is known is the amount of water in the bucket, it is impossible to figure out, on this basis alone, how much water came from each hose: it is impossible to work “backwards” from the bucket to the hoses.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} This is a simple example of an [[inverse problem]].  Solutions to these problems are rarely possible, although they can sometimes be approximated by imposing assumption-based constraints on the “[[solution space]]”.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Navigating the world on the basis of sensory stimulation alone represents an inverse problem in the realm of biology. Consider, for example, the case of the distance and line length. When light reflected from a [[linearity|linear]] object falls on the [[retina]], the object in 3-D space is transformed into a two-dimensional line.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Note, however, that a distant line can form the same image on the retina as a shorter but close line. All the eyes receive is an image, which is analogous to the bucket of water. It is impossible to go backward to know the real distance, length, and orientation of the source of the projected line, analogous to the amounts of water that came from each hose. Despite this fact, percipients usually manage to behave effectively in response to sensory stimulation.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The inverse optics problem presents a quandary for traditional approaches to perception. For example, advocates of [[Feature detection (nervous system)|feature detection]] or, in more current terms, neural [[filter (signal processing)|filtering]], propose that the visual system performs logical computations on retinal inputs to determine higher-level aspects of a perceptual scene such as contrast, contour, shape and color percepts.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} However, given the inverse problem, it is hard to imagine how these computations, if they were actually performed, would be useful, since they would have little or nothing to do with properties of the real world. Empirical approaches to perception take a different tack, arguing that the only way for organisms to successfully overcome the inverse problem is to exploit their long and varied past experience with the real world.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}
	
The wholly empirical approach holds that this experience is the sole determinant of perceptual qualities. The reason percipients see an object as dark or light, the argument goes, is that in both our own past and the past of the species it paid off to see it that particular way. Returning to the bucket analogy, imagine that each of the three hoses pumps out water of a different color: one pumps out black water, one pumps out gray water, and one pumps out clear water.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} All one sees is the water in the bucket, which can be clear, gray, black, or any shade in between. As expected, it is impossible to perform some calculation on the color of the water in the bucket to find out how much water came out of each hose. Now imagine that it is your job to bet on how much water came out of the gray hose. The output ratios of the hoses are not random, but [[covariance|co-vary]] in all kinds of complicated ways based on the time of day, how long it takes to fill up the bucket, etc. At first your behavior in response to the color of the bucket might not be so good, but over time this would gradually improve as different shades and behaviors in response became associated by trial and error. The key is that in order to improve you have to know whether or not your behaviors worked by interacting with the world.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

On the wholly empirical view, the retinal image is like the bucket and what you see is determined by past behaviors that have succeeded. Although this example is simplistic, it illustrates the general strategy that visual system uses to work around the inverse problem.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Over millions of years individuals whose visual systems more successfully linked sensory stimulation with successful behavior won out. In this view the inverse problem is not actually solved—which would be analogous to computing the outputs of all three hoses—the result might be close enough to behave appropriately in response to stimuli.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Color ===

[[Color vision]] is dependent on activation of three [[cone cell]] types in the human retina, each of which is primarily responsive to a different spectrum of [[physics of light|light frequencies]]. While these [[retina]]l mechanisms enable subsequent color processing, their properties alone cannot account for the full range of color perception phenomena. In part this is due to the fact that [[illuminance]] (the amount of light shining on an object), [[reflectance]] (the amount of light an object is predisposed to reflect), and [[transmittance]] (the extent to which the light medium distorts the light as it travels) are conflated in the retinal image. This is problematic because, if color vision is to be useful, it must somehow guide behavior in line with these properties. Even so, the visual system only has access to retinal input, which does not distinguish the relative contributions of each of these factors to the final [[electromagnetic spectrum|light spectra]] that stimulate the [[retina]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

According to the empirical framework, the visual system solves this problem by drawing on species and individual experience with retinal images that have signified different combinations of illuminance, reflectance, and transmittance in the past. Only those associations that led to appropriate behavior were retained through evolution and development, leading to a repertoire of neural associations and predispositions that ground color perception in the world.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

One way to test this idea is to see whether the frequency of co-occurrence of light spectra predicts simultaneous color contrast effects (see side image, Fig. 1). Long and Purves&lt;ref&gt;Natural scene statistics as the universal basis for color context effects. Long F, Purves D. Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences 100(25): 15190-15193. (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; showed that by sampling thousands of [[scene statistics|natural images]], analysis of associations between target colors and the colors of their surrounds could explain perceptual effects like those seen on the right. Rather than explaining the diverging color percepts as unfortunate byproducts of a normally veridical color perception mechanism, according to this work the different colors humans see are simply the byproducts of our species and individual exposure to the distribution of color spectra in the world.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Brightness ===
[[File:Grey square optical illusion.svg|thumb|alt=Striking demonstration of simultaneous brightness contrast.|Fig. 2. Squares A and B are identical in luminance returns but look differently bright depending on context.]]
’’[[Brightness]]’’ refers to a subjective sense that the object considered is emitting light. Whereas the perceptual correlates of color are the frequencies of light that compose the [[visible spectrum|light spectrum]], the perceptual correlate of brightness is [[luminance]], or the intensity of light emitted by an object. While it may seem obvious that the sensation of brightness is straightforwardly related to the amount or intensity of light coming to the eyes, perception researchers have long known that brightness is not caused solely by the luminance incident on the retina.&lt;ref&gt;Fechner G.T., Adler, H.E., Howes, D.H. &amp; Boring, E.G., (1966) Elements of Psychophysics (Holt Rinehart and Winston, New York).&lt;/ref&gt; A common example is simultaneous brightness contrast (shown to the right), in which the two identical target diamonds appear differently bright.

In the empirical account, the same general framework used to rationalize simultaneous color contrast applies to simultaneous [[brightness]] contrast. Because the three factors that determine luminance emissions—[[transmittance]], [[reflectance]], and [[illuminance]]—are blended in the retinal image of the object, operations on the luminance returns as such cannot in principle yield percepts that are good guides to behavior.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The visual system solves this problem by associating luminance values and their given contexts with the success or failure of ensuing behavior, leading to percepts that often (but only incidentally) reflect properties of objects rather than their associated images.

The image on the right (Fig. 2.) strongly supports this view of how brightness perception works. Although other frameworks have either no explanation for this effect or explanations that are highly inconsistent with their explanations for similar effects, the empirical framework makes the case that the perceived brightness differences are due to empirical associations between the targets and their respective contexts. In this case, because the “lighter” targets would typically have been shadowed, humans perceive them in a way that is consistent with their having a higher [[reflectance]] despite their presumably low levels of [[illuminance]]. Note that this approach is considerably different from computational “context”-driven approaches, since in this case the target/context relationships are contingent and world-based, and therefore cannot be generalized to other cases in any meaningful way.

=== Line length ===

Perception of line length is confounded by another [[inverse problem in optics|optical inverse problem]]: the further away a line in the world, the smaller the projected line will be on the retina. Different orientations of a line relative to the observer may obscure true line length as well. It is well known that straight lines are erroneously reported as longer or shorter as a function of their angular orientation,&lt;ref&gt;Shipley W C, Mann B M, Penfield M J (1949) J Exp Psychol 39:548–551&lt;/ref&gt; as is evident in Fig. 3. While no generally accepted explanations of this phenomenon have been offered previously, the empirical approach has had some success in explaining the effect as a function of the distribution of lines in natural scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Howe and Purves  (2002). PNAS  99(20): 13184-13188.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Howe and Purves (2002) analyzed [[scene statistics|natural scene]] photographs to find projected lines that corresponded to straight line sources. They found that the ratios of the actual length of the lines to the projected lines on the retina, when classified by their respective orientations on the retina, almost perfectly matched subjective estimation of line length as a function of angle relative to the observer. For example, horizontal lines on the retinal image would typically have turned out to issue from relatively short physical sources, while lines at about 60 degrees relative to the observer would typically have signified longer physical sources, which explains why individuals tend to see the 60° line in Fig. 3 as longer than the 0° (horizontal) line. While there is no way for the visual system to know this ''a priori'', the fact that it seems to take this knowledge for granted in its construction of length estimation percepts strongly supports the wholly empirical view of perception.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Motion ===
Perception of motion is also confounded by an inverse problem: movement in three-dimensional space does not map perfectly onto movement on the retinal plane. A distant object moving at a given speed will translate more slowly on the retina than a nearby object moving at the same speed, and as mentioned previously size, distance and orientation are also ambiguous given only the retinal image. As with other aspects of perception, empirical theorists propose that this problem is solved by trial-and-error experience with moving stimuli, their associated retinal images and the consequences of behavior.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} 
One way to test this hypothesis is by seeing whether it can explain the [[flash lag illusion]], a visual effect in which a flash superimposed on a moving bar is falsely seen to lag behind the bar. The task for empirical theorists is to explain why individuals perceive the flash in this way, and further, why the perceived lag increases with the speed of the moving bar. To investigate this question, Wojtach et al. (2008)&lt;ref&gt;An empirical explanation of the flash-lag effect. Wojtach W.T., Sung K., Truong S., Purves D. (2008) Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences 105(2): 16338-16343.&lt;/ref&gt; simulated a three-dimensional environment full of moving virtual particles. They modeled the transformation from three dimensions to the two-dimensional image plane and tallied up the frequency of occurrence of particle speeds, particle distances, image speeds, and image distances (image meaning the path projected across the computer-modeled “retina”). The [[probability distributions]] they obtained in this way predicted the magnitude of the bar-flash disparity quite well. The authors concluded that the flash-lag effect was a signature of the way brains evolve and develop to behave appropriately in response to moving retinal images.

{{Sustainable energy}}

The '''Energy Hierarchy''' is a classification of [[energy]] options, prioritised to assist progress towards a more [[sustainable energy]] system. It is a similar approach to the [[waste hierarchy]] for minimising [[resource depletion]], and adopts a parallel sequence.

The highest priorities cover the prevention of unnecessary energy usage both through eliminating waste and improving [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]. The sustainable production of energy resources is the next priority. Depletive and waste-producing energy generation options are the lowest priority.

For an energy system to be sustainable: the resources applied to producing the energy must be capable of lasting indefinitely; [[energy conversion]] should produce no harmful by-products, including net emissions, nor wastes which cannot be fully recycled; and it must be capable of meeting reasonable energy demands.

==Energy saving==
{{main article|Energy conservation}}
The top priority under the Energy Hierarchy is energy conservation or the prevention of unnecessary [[use of energy]]. This category includes eliminating waste by turning off unneeded lights and appliances and by avoiding unnecessary [[travelling|journeys]]. [[Heat loss]] from buildings is a major source of energy wastage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bartlett|first=Dave|title=The Top Ten Ways We Waste Energy And Water In Buildings|url=http://energy.aol.com/2011/07/26/the-top-ten-ways-we-waste-energy-and-water-in-buildings/|publisher=AOL Energy|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  so improvements to building insulation and air-tightness can make a significant contribution to energy conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Conservation in Buildings and Community Systems|url=http://www.ecbcs.org/home.htm|work=About the ECBCS|publisher=International Energy Agency|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries have agencies to encourage [[energy saving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/|publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=United Kingdom|title=Energy Saving Trust|url=http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/|publisher=The Energy Saving Trust|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency==
The second priority under the energy hierarchy is to ensure that energy that is used is produced and consumed efficiently. [[Energy efficiency (physics)|Energy efficiency]] has two main aspects.

===Conversion efficiency of energy consumption===
{{main article|Efficient energy use}}
Energy efficiency is the ratio of the productive output of a device to the energy it consumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy efficiency definition and meaning|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/energy-efficiency.html|work=Business Dictionary|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy efficiency was a lower priority when energy was cheap and awareness of its environmental impact was low. In 1975 the average fuel economy of a car in the US was under 15 miles per gallon&lt;ref name=EPA_vehicles&gt;{{cite web|title=Light-Duty Automotive Technology, Carbon Dioxide Emissions, and Fuel Economy Trends: 1975 Through 2011|url=http://www.epa.gov/otaq/cert/mpg/fetrends/2012/420r12001a.pdf|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incandescent light bulbs, which were the most common type until the late 20th century, waste 90% of their energy as heat, with only 10% converted to useful light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learn about LEDs|url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=lighting.pr_what_are|publisher=Energy Star|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, energy efficiency has become a priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Energy savings to be first policy priority for 2030|url=http://www.energy-cities.eu/IMG/pdf/20121120_press_release_Coalition_call_for_2030_energy_savings.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2013|newspaper=Energy Cities (Europe)|date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last reported average fuel efficiency of US cars had almost doubled from the 1975 level;&lt;ref name=EPA_vehicles /&gt; LED lighting is now being promoted which are between five and ten times more efficient than incandescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LED basics|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/ssl/sslbasics_ledbasics.html#how_efficient|work=Solid State Lighting|publisher=USDOE Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many household appliances are now required to display [[Energy input labeling|labels]] to show their energy efficiency.

===Conversion efficiency of energy production===
{{main article|Energy conversion efficiency}}
Losses are incurred when energy is harvested from the natural resource from which it is derived, such as fossil fuels, radioactive materials, solar radiation or other sources. Most electricity production is in thermal power stations, where much of the source energy is lost as heat. The average efficiency of world electricity production in 2009 was c.37%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 Energy Balance for the World|url=http://www.iea.org/stats/balancetable.asp?COUNTRY_CODE=29|publisher=International Energy Agency|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A priority in the Energy Hierarchy is to improve the efficiency of energy conversion, whether in traditional power stations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Efficiency in electricity generation|url=http://www.eurelectric.org/Download/Download.aspx?DocumentID=13549|publisher=Eurelectric|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by improving the [[Photovoltaic power station#System performance|performance ratio]] of [[Photovoltaic power stations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012|url=http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/de/downloads/pdf-files/aktuelles/photovoltaics-report.pdf|work=Photovoltaics Report|publisher=Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other energy sources.

Overall efficiency and sustainability can also be improved by capacity- or [[Climate change mitigation#Fuel switching|fuel-switching]] from less efficient, less sustainable resources to better ones; but this is mainly covered under the [[#Low impact energy production|fourth level]] of the hierarchy.

==Sustainable energy production==
{{main article|Renewable energy}}
Renewable energy describes naturally occurring, theoretically inexhaustible sources of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Renewable Energy|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/renewable-energy.html|publisher=Business Dictionary|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sources are treated as being inexhaustible, or naturally replenished, and fall into two classes.

===Elemental renewables===
The first class of renewables derive from climatic or elemental sources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renewable Energy |url=http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/students/options/sectors/energy/renewable/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419123506/http://www.careers.manchester.ac.uk/students/options/sectors/energy/renewable/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-19 |publisher=Manchester University |accessdate=23 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as sunlight, wind, waves, tides or rainfall ([[hydropower]]). [[Geothermal energy]] from the heat of the earth's core also falls in this category.

These are treated as being inexhaustible because most derive ultimately from energy emanating from the [[sun]], which has an estimated life of 6.5 billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Sun's lifetime going to be?|url=http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/ask/a10395.html|work=Ask the space scientist|publisher=NASA|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bio-energy===
The other main class of renewables, [[bioenergy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Renewable Energy|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/tech/home|publisher=Renewable Energy World|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; derives from biomass, where the relatively short growing cycle means that usage is replenished by new growth. Bioenergy is usually converted by combustion, and therefore gives rise to carbon emissions. It is treated as carbon neutral overall, because an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide will have been extracted from the atmosphere during the growing cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pingoud|first=Kim|title=Harvested Wood Products|volume=4|series=IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories|url=http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_12_Ch12_HWP.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioenergy sources can be solid, such as wood and [[energy crop]]s; liquid, such as biofuels; or gaseous, such as biomethane from anaerobic digestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is bioenergy?|url=http://www.bioenergywiki.net/What_is_bioenergy|publisher=Bioenergy Wiki|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low impact energy production==
{{main article|Low carbon power}}
The next priority in the hierarchy covers energy sources that are not entirely sustainable, but have a low environmental impact. These include the use of fossil fuels with [[carbon capture and storage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbon dioxide capture and storage|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_technicalsummary.pdf|work=Technical Report|publisher=IPCC|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear energy is sometimes treated as a low impact source, because it has low carbon emissions.

==High impact energy production==

The lowest priority under the energy hierarchy is energy production using unsustainables sources, such as unabated fossil fuels.

There is a consensus that the share of such energy sources must decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An energy vision for a planet under pressure|url=http://www.igbp.net/publications/policybriefsforrio20summit/policybriefsforrio20summit/anenergyvisionforaplanetunderpressure.5.7edb9cae136f47276108000494.html|publisher=International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many suggest that when such high impact energy usage has been minimised, the effects of any unavoidable residual usage should be counterbalanced by emissions [[offsetting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liyanage|first=Chandratilak De Silva|title=Sustainable Energy Management and CSR|series=Encyclopedia of Corporate Social Responsibility|url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/343555.html|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the energy hierarchy==
The Energy Hierarchy was first proposed in 2005 by [[Philip Wolfe (engineer)|Philip Wolfe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfe|first=Philip|title=A proposed Energy Hierarchy|url=http://www.wolfeware.com/library/publications/EnergyHierarchy.pdf|publisher=WolfeWare|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was Director General of the [[Renewable Energy Association]]. This first version had three levels; energy efficiency, renewables and traditional energy production. It was endorsed and adopted in 2006 by a consortium of institutions, associations and other bodies in the Sustainable Energy Manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Groups release energy 'manifesto'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4921896.stm|accessdate=23 February 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=19 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, the concept has been adopted and refined by others in the energy industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Institution of Mechanical Engineers |title=The Energy Hierarchy |year=2009 |series=Energy Policy Statement |issue=09/03 |url=http://www.imeche.org/Libraries/Position_Statements-Energy/EnergyHierarchyIMechEPolicy.sflb.ashx |accessdate=23 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625001718/http://www.imeche.org/Libraries/Position_Statements-Energy/EnergyHierarchyIMechEPolicy.sflb.ashx |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thinking differently - the energy hierarchy|url=http://www.cabe.org.uk/sustainable-places/advice/the-energy-hierarchy|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110118095356/http:/www.cabe.org.uk/sustainable-places/advice/the-energy-hierarchy|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-01-18|publisher=UK Government National Archives|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Energy Hierarchy |url=http://www.london.gov.uk/thelondonplan/climate/sustainable_energy.jsp |work=The London Plan |publisher=Greater London Authority |accessdate=23 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305005446/http://www.london.gov.uk/thelondonplan/climate/sustainable_energy.jsp |archivedate=2013-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The English word ''faith'' is thought to date from 1200–1250, from the Middle English ''feith'', via Anglo-French ''fed'', Old French ''feid'', ''feit'' from Latin ''fidem'', accusative of ''fidēs'' (trust), akin to ''fīdere'' (to trust).&lt;ref name=dict&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/faith |title=Faith – Define Faith |work=Dictionary.com |accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stages of faith development ==
{{Main|James W. Fowler#Stages of Faith}}

[[James W. Fowler]] (1940–2015) proposes a series of stages of faith-development (or [[spiritual development]]) across the human life-span. His stages relate closely to the work of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], Erikson, and [[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg]] regarding aspects of psychological development in children and adults. Fowler defines faith as an activity of trusting, committing, and relating to the world based on a set of assumptions of how one is related to others and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Nancy|last1=Evans |first2=Deanna |last2=Forney |first3=Florence |last3=Guido |first4=Lori |last4=Patton |first5=Kristen |last5=Renn |title=Student Development in College: Theory, Research, and Practice |edition=Second |publisher=Jossey-Bass |location=|year=2010 |isbn=978-0787978099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stages of faith ===
# Intuitive-Projective: a stage of confusion and of high impressionability through stories and [[ritual]]s (pre-school period).
# Mythic-Literal: a stage where provided information is accepted in order to conform with [[social norm]]s (school-going period).
# Synthetic-Conventional: in this stage the faith acquired is concreted in the [[belief system]] with the forgoing of personification and replacement with [[authority]] in individuals or groups that represent one's beliefs (early-late adolescence).
# Individuative-Reflective: in this stage the individual critically analyzes adopted and accepted faith with existing systems of faith. Disillusion or strengthening of faith happens in this stage. Based on needs, experiences and paradoxes (early adulthood).
# Conjunctive faith: in this stage people realize the limits of [[logic]] and, facing the paradoxes or [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] of [[personal life|life]], accept the "mystery of life" and often return to the sacred stories and symbols of the pre-acquired or re-adopted faith system. This stage is called negotiated settling in life (mid-life).
# Universalizing faith: this is the "enlightenment" stage where the individual comes out of all the existing systems of faith and lives life with universal principles of compassion and love and in service to others for upliftment, without worries and [[doubt]] (middle-late adulthood (45–65 years old and plus).&lt;ref&gt;Works of [[Daniel Levinson|Daniel J. Levinson]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=May 2018}}

No hard-and-fast rule requires individuals pursuing faith to go through all six stages. There is a high probability for individuals to be content and fixed in a particular stage for a lifetime; stages from 2-5 are such stages. Stage 6 is the summit of faith development. This state is often{{quantify|date=December 2015}} considered as "not fully" attainable.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, J.W.; Stages of Faith – The Psychology of Human Development and the Quest for Meaning&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bahá'í Faith ===
{{See also|Role of faith in the Baha'i Faith}}
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], faith is meant, first, conscious knowledge, and second, the practice of good deeds,&lt;ref&gt;Baha'i World Faith – Abdu'l-Baha Section, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately the acceptance of the divine authority of the [[Manifestations of God]].&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith |first=P. |year=1999 |title=A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford, UK |page=155|isbn=1-85168-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the religion's view, faith and knowledge are both required for spiritual growth.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; Faith involves more than outward obedience to this authority, but also must be based on a deep personal understanding of religious teachings.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

=== Buddhism ===
{{Main|Faith in Buddhism}}
Faith in Buddhism (''{{lang-pi|saddhā}}'', ''{{lang-sa|śraddhā}}'') refers to a serene commitment in the practice of the Buddha's teaching and trust in enlightened or highly developed beings, such as [[Buddha (title)|Buddhas]] or ''[[bodhisattvas]]'' (those aiming to become a Buddha).&lt;ref name="Gomez 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gómez|first1=Luis O.|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|editor1-link=Robert Buswell Jr.|title=Faith|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-02-865720-9|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|pages=277–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|pp=388–9}} Buddhists usually recognize multiple objects of faith, but many are especially devoted to one particular object of faith, such as one particular Buddha.&lt;ref name="Gomez 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kinnard|first1=Jacob N.|author-link=Jacob N. Kinnard|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|editor1-link=Robert Buswell Jr.|title=Worship|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-02-865720-9|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|p=907}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|pp=386, 396–7}}

In [[early Buddhism]], faith was focused on the [[Triple Gem]], that is, [[Gautama Buddha]], his teaching (the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dhamma]]), and the community of spiritually developed followers, or the monastic community seeking enlightenment (the [[Sangha]]). Although offerings to the monastic community were valued highest, early Buddhism did not morally condemn peaceful offerings to [[deva (Buddhism)|deities]].{{sfn|Lamotte|1988|pp=74–5, 81}} A faithful devotee was called [[upasaka and Upasika|''upāsaka'' or ''upāsika'']], for which no formal declaration was required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Tremblay|first1=Xavier|editor1-last=Heirman|editor1-first=Ann|editor2-last=Bumbacher|editor2-first=Stephan Peter|encyclopedia=The spread of Buddhism|title=The spread of Buddhism in Serindia|date=2007|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004158306|edition=online|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early Buddhism, personal verification was valued highest in attaining the truth, and sacred scriptures, reason or faith in a teacher were considered less valuable sources of authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fuller|first1=Paul|title=The notion of diṭṭhi in Theravāda Buddhism : the point of view|date=2004|publisher=[[RoutledgeCurzon]]|location=London|isbn=0-203-01043-4|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/31392862/The_notion_of_Ditthi.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1507847029&amp;Signature=ZGrJoGZcaUjL%2FEaIJ55xwsailIU%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DThe_notion_of_Ditthi.pdf|page=36}}{{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As important as faith was, it was a mere initial step to the path to [[Paññā|wisdom]] and [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], and was obsolete or redefined at the final stage of that path.{{sfn|Lamotte|1988|pp=49–50}}{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|pp=384, 396–7}}

While [[faith in Buddhism]] does not imply "blind faith", Buddhist practice nevertheless requires a degree of trust, primarily in the spiritual attainment of [[Gautama Buddha]]. Faith in [[Buddhism]] centers on the understanding that the Buddha is an Awakened being, on his superior role as teacher, in the truth of his [[Dharma]] (spiritual teachings), and in his [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] (community of spiritually developed followers). Faith in Buddhism can be summarised as faith in the [[Three Jewels]]: the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. It is intended to lead to the goal of enlightenment, or [[bodhi]], and [[Nirvana]]. Volitionally, faith implies a resolute and courageous act of will. It combines the steadfast resolution that one will do a thing with the self-confidence that one can do it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Way of Wisdom The Five Spiritual Faculties|first= Edward |last=Conze|authorlink=Edward Conze|year=1993|url= http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/conze/wheel065.html|website=www.accesstoinsight.org|publisher=[[Buddhist Publication Society]]|isbn=978-9552401107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the role of faith increased throughout Buddhist history. However, from the nineteenth century onward, [[Buddhist modernism]] in countries like Sri Lanka and Japan, and also in the West, has downplayed and criticized the role of faith in Buddhism. Faith in Buddhism still has a role in modern Asia or the West, but is understood and defined differently from traditional interpretations.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=378, 429, 444}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gombrich|first1=Richard F.|authorlink1=Richard F.

{{Main|Faith in Christianity}}
The word translated as "faith" in the New Testament is the Greek word ''πίστις'' (''pístis'') which can also be translated "belief", "faithfulness", and "trust".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/greek/4102.htm|title=Strong's Greek: 4102. πίστις (pistis) -- faith, faithfulness|work=biblehub.com|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various views in Christianity regarding the nature of faith. Some see faith as being persuaded or convinced that something is true.&lt;ref name= Wilkin2012&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Ten Most Misunderstood Words in the Bible |year=2012 |author=Wilkin, Robert N. |page=221 |publisher=GES |location=Corinth, TX}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, a person believes something when they are presented with adequate evidence that it is true. Theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] did not hold that faith is mere opinion: on the contrary, he held that it is a mean (understood in the Platonic sense) between excessive reliance on science (i.e. demonstration) and excessive reliance on opinion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3001.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Then there are numerous views regarding the results of faith. Some believe that true faith results in good works, while others believe that while faith in [[Jesus]] brings eternal life, it does not necessarily result in good works.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://redeeminggod.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/Faith-and-Good-Works-JD-Myers.pdf (PDF) Jeremy Myers, The Gospel Under Siege: 3 Views on the Relationship Between Faith and Good Works]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of which approach to faith a Christian takes, all agree that the Christian faith is aligned with the ideals and the example of the life of Jesus. The Christian sees the mystery of [[God]] and his [[Divine grace|grace]] and seeks to know and become obedient to God. To a Christian, faith is not static but causes one to learn more of God and to grow; Christian faith has its origin in God.&lt;ref name= Wuerl2004&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IzqDiPALzKEC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;dq=a#PPA237,M1 |title=The Teaching of Christ: A Catholic Catechism for Adults, Edition: 5, revised |year=2004 |author=Wuerl, By Donald W. |page=238 |isbn=1-59276-094-5 |accessdate=21 April 2009|publisher=Our Sunday Visitor Pub.

The definition of faith given by the apostle Paul at Hebrews 11:1 carries particular weight with Christians that respect the Bible as the source of divine truth. There the apostle writes:

"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." — King James Version

"Now faith is the assurance that what we hope for will come about and the certainty that what we cannot see exists." — International Standard Version

“The naive or inexperienced person[is easily misled and believes every word he hears, but the prudent man is discreet and astute.” (Proverbs 14:15, Amplified Bible) The Christian apostle Paul wrote: “Test everything that is said to be sure it is true, and if it is, then accept it.” (1 Thessalonians 5:21, Living Bible)

In Christianity, faith causes change as it seeks a greater understanding of God. Faith is not only [[fideism]] or simple obedience to a set of rules or statements.&lt;ref&gt;Migliore, Daniel L. 2004. ''Faith seeking understanding: an introduction to Christian theology''. Grand Rapids, Mich: W.B. Eerdmans. pp. 3-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Before Christians have faith, they must understand in whom and in what they have faith. Without understanding, there cannot be true faith, and that understanding is built on the foundation of the community of believers, the scriptures and traditions and on the personal experiences of the [[belief|believer]].&lt;ref&gt;Inbody, Tyron. 2005. The faith of the Christian church: an introduction to theology. Grand Rapids, Mich: William B. Eerdmans Pub. pp. 1-10&lt;/ref&gt; In English translations of the New Testament, the word "faith" generally corresponds to the Greek noun πίστις (''pistis'') or to the Greek verb πιστεύω (''pisteuo''), meaning "to trust, to have confidence, faithfulness, to be reliable, to assure".&lt;ref name=Thomas1981&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Robert L. |last2=Editor |first2=General |year = 1981 |title= New American standard exhaustive concordance of the Bible: |pages= 1674–75 |isbn= 0-87981-197-8 |publisher= A.J.

==== Christian apologetic views ====
In contrast to noted atheist [[Richard Dawkins]]' view of faith as "blind trust, in the absence of evidence, even in the teeth of evidence",&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins, The Selfish Gene. 2nd edn. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989, 198.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alister McGrath]] quotes the Oxford Anglican theologian W. H. Griffith-Thomas (1861–1924), who states that faith is "not blind, but intelligent" and that it "commences with the conviction of the mind based on adequate evidence...", which McGrath sees as "a good and reliable definition, synthesizing the core elements of the characteristic Christian understanding of faith".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGrath|first=Alister E.|title= The Order of Things: Explorations in Scientific Theology|year= 2008|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn= 1-4051-2556-X|page= 33|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WrRZBOxJzDcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American biblical scholar [[Archibald Thomas Robertson]] stated that the Greek word ''pistis'' used for faith in the New Testament (over two hundred forty times), and rendered "assurance" in Acts 17:31 (KJV), is "an old verb meaning "to furnish", used regularly by Demosthenes for bringing forward evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Robertson|first= Archibald Thomas|title= WORD PICTURES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT|pages= Chapter 17|url= http://www.ccel.org/ccel/robertson_at/wp_acts.xviii.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Price (Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics) affirms that when the New Testament talks about faith positively it only uses words derived from the Greek root [pistis] which means "to be persuaded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Price|first= Thomas|title= Faith is about 'just trusting' God isn't It?|url= http://www.bethinking.org/bible-jesus/introductory/faith-is-about-just-trusting-god-isnt-it.htm|accessdate= 23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Christian apologist [[John Lennox]] argues that "faith conceived as belief that lacks warrant is very different from faith conceived as belief that has warrant". He states that "the use of the adjective 'blind' to describe 'faith' indicates that faith is not necessarily, or always, or indeed normally, blind". "The validity, or warrant, of faith or belief depends on the strength of the evidence on which the belief is based." "We all know how to distinguish between blind faith and evidence-based faith. We are well aware that faith is only justified if there is evidence to back it up." "Evidence-based faith is the normal concept on which we base our everyday lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Lennox|first= John|title= Gunning for God: Why the New Atheists Are Missing the Target|year=2011|publisher=Lion|location=United kingdom|isbn= 0-7459-5322-0|page= 55|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kxBRhMYsadwC&amp;dq=faith+defined+as+warranted+based+on+evidence&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter S Williams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterswilliams.com|title=Peter S. Williams|work=peterswilliams.com|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; holds that "the classic Christian tradition has always valued rationality, and does not hold that faith involves the complete abandonment of reason while believing in the teeth of evidence."{{page needed|date=February 2015}} Quoting Moreland, faith is defined as "a trust in and commitment to what we have reason to believe is true."

Regarding [[doubting Thomas]] in John 20:24-31, Williams points out that "Thomas wasn't asked to believe without evidence". He was asked to believe on the basis of the other disciples' testimony. Thomas initially lacked the first-hand experience of the evidence that had convinced them... Moreover, the reason John gives for recounting these events is that what he saw is evidence... Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples...But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name. John 20:30,31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Williams|first=  Peter S|title= A Faithful Guide to Philosophy: A Christian Introduction to the Love of Wisdom|year= 2013|publisher= Authentic Media|isbn= 1-84227-811-8|pages= Chapter 1.4 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DCEVL-8d-J4C&amp;dq=A+Faithful+Guide+To+Philosophy:+A+Christian+Introduction+To+The+Love+Of+Wisdom&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning [[doubting Thomas]], Michael R. Allen wrote, "Thomas's definition of faith implies adherence to conceptual propositions for the sake of personal knowledge, knowledge of and about a person ''qua'' person".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Michael|title=The Christ's Faith: A Dogmatic Account|date=2009|publisher=T&amp;T Clark Studies in Systematic Theology|location=London|isbn=978-0-567-03399-4|page=80}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 January 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth Boa and Robert M. Bowman Jr. describe a classic understanding of faith that is referred to {{by whom|date=February 2015}}as ''[[evidentialism]]'', and which is part of a larger epistemological tradition called ''classical [[foundationalism]]'', which is accompanied by ''[[deontologism]]'', which holds that humans have an obligation to regulate their beliefs in accordance with evidentialist structures.

They show how this can go too far,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Boa|first= Kenneth|author2= Robert M.Bowman|title= Faith Has Its Reasons: Integrative Approaches to Defending the Christian Faith|date= March 1, 2006|publisher= IVP Books|location= USA|isbn= 978-0-8308-5648-0|pages= 253|url= https://www.amazon.com/Faith-Has-Its-Reasons-Integrative/dp/083085648X#reader_083085648X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alvin Plantinga]] deals with it. While Plantinga upholds that faith may be the result of evidence testifying to the reliability of the source (of the truth claims), yet he sees having faith as being the result of hearing the truth of the gospel with the internal persuasion by the Holy Spirit moving and enabling him to believe. "Christian belief is produced in the believer by the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit, endorsing the teachings of Scripture, which is itself divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit. The result of the work of the Holy Spirit is faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Plantinga|first= Alvin|title= Warranted Christian Belief|year= 2000|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= USA|isbn= 0-19-513192-4|pages= 250, 291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Catholicism ====

The four-part ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' (CCC) gives Part One to "The Profession of Faith".  This section describes the content of faith.  It elaborates and expands particularly upon the [[Apostles' Creed]].  CCC 144 initiates a section on the "Obedience of Faith".

In the [[theology]] of [[Pope John Paul II]], faith is understood in personal terms as a trusting commitment of person to person and thus involves Christian commitment to the divine person of [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;

==== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ====

Some alternative, yet impactful, ideas regarding the nature of faith were presented in a collection of sermons now presented as {{cite book|url=https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/lectures-faith-historical-perspective/lectures-faith-1990-edited-version/lecture-1|title=Lectures on Faith|}}

# Lectures 3 and 4 make clear the necessary and unchanging attributes of God; 
# Lecture 5 deals with the nature of God the Father, his Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost;

=== Hinduism ===
{{Main|Hinduism}}
[[Ahimsa]], also referred to as [[nonviolence]], is the fundamental tenet of Hinduism which advocates harmonious and peaceful co-existence and evolutionary growth in grace and wisdom for all humankind unconditionally.

In Hinduism, most of the Vedic prayers begins with the chants of Om. Om is the Sanskrit symbol that amazingly resonates the peacefulness ensconced within one's higher self. Om is considered to have a profound effect on the body and mind of the one who chants and also creates a calmness, serenity, healing, strength of its own to prevail within and also in the surrounding environment.

=== Islam ===
{{Main|Iman (concept)}}
In Islam, a believer's faith in the metaphysical aspects of [[Islam]] is called "Iman" ({{lang-ar|{{large|الإيمان}}}}), which is complete submission to the will of God, not unquestionable or blind belief.&lt;ref&gt;Farāhī, Majmū‘ah Tafāsīr, 2nd ed. (Faran Foundation, 1998), 347.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frederick M. Denny, ''An Introduction to Islam, 3rd ed., p. 405''&lt;/ref&gt; A man must build his faith on well-grounded convictions beyond any reasonable doubt and above uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=gLi2X1rzeZIC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=build+his+faith+on+well-grounded+convictions&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JAAqmVe6FQ&amp;sig=1rwgFIQDOphU5cSSPyGRBFOtACI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisooTPpZrZAhVFtY8KHavTD10Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=build%20his%20faith%20on%20well-grounded%20convictions&amp;f=false|title=Encountering the World of Islam|last=Swartley|first=Keith E.|date=2005-11-02|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=9780830856442|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} According to the Quran, Iman must be accompanied by righteous deeds and the two together are necessary for entry into [[Jannah|Paradise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|95|6|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Hadith of Gabriel, ''Iman'' in addition to ''Islam'' and ''[[Ihsan]]'' form the three dimensions of the Islamic religion.

[[Muhammad]] referred to the six articles of faith in the [[Hadith of Gabriel]]: "Iman is that you believe in God and His Angels and His Books and His Messengers and the Hereafter and the good and evil fate [ordained by your God]."&lt;ref&gt;Muslim, Al-Jami‘ al-sahih, 22, (no. 93).&lt;/ref&gt; The first five are mentioned together in the Qur'an&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|2|285|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran states that faith can grow with remembrance of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|8|2|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an also states that nothing in this world should be dearer to a true believer than faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|9|24|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judaism ===
{{Main|Jewish principles of faith}}
Faith itself is not a religious concept in [[Judaism]]. The ''faith in God'' is mentioned in the [[Book of Genesis]] Chapter 15 verse 6 and in the [[Book of Exodus]] Chapter 4 verse 31 and in the [[Book of Isaiah]], Chapter 43 verse 10, in the 24 books of the [[Jewish Bible]]. The word translated as "faith" here is the Hebrew word אָמַן which can also be translated "believe", "reliable", and "trustworthy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/hebrew/539.htm|title=Strong's Hebrew: 539. אָמַן (aman) -- believe, reliable|work=biblehub.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Book of Isaiah]], Chapter 43 verse 10, the commandment to know [[God in Judaism|God]] is followed by the commandments to believe and to understand, thus denoting descending importance.&lt;ref name=beliefInGod&gt;{{cite web|last=Mizrachi|first=Yosef|title=Who God Is|url=http://www.divineinformation.com/who-hashem-is/|work=Audios English 5min:40sec-9min:02sec|publisher=DivineInformation.com|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Judaism does recognize the positive value of ''Emunah''&lt;ref name="chabad"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1398519/jewish/Emunah.htm |title=What Is Emunah – Beyond Belief – Essentials |work=chabad.org |accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (generally translated as faith, trust in God) and the negative status of the ''[[Epikoros|Apikorus]]'' (heretic), but faith is not as stressed or as central as it is in other religions, especially compared with [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. It could be a necessary means for being a practicing religious Jew, but the emphasis is placed on true [[knowledge]], true [[Prophecy#Judaism|prophecy]] and practice rather than on faith itself. Very rarely does it relate to any teaching that must be believed.&lt;ref name=beliefInGod /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brueggemann2002 /&gt; Judaism does not require one to explicitly identify God (a key tenet of [[Christian faith]], which is called [[Avodah Zarah]] in Judaism, a minor form of [[idolatry|idol worship]], a big sin and strictly forbidden to Jews). Rather, in Judaism, one is to honour a (personal) idea of God, supported by the many principles quoted in the Talmud to define Judaism, mostly by what it is not. Thus there is no established formulation of [[Jewish principles of faith]] which are mandatory for all (observant) [[Jews]].

In the Jewish scriptures trust in God – ''Emunah'' – refers to how God acts toward his people and how they are to respond to him; it is rooted in the everlasting covenant established in the [[Torah]], notably&lt;ref name=Brueggemann2002&gt;{{Cite book |last=Brueggemann |first=Walter |year=2002 |title=Reverberations of faith: a theological handbook of Old Testament themes |pages=76–78 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dBJQ71RIpdMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=faith+in+the+old+testament |isbn=0-664-22231-5 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |location=Louisville, Ky.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deuteronomy 7:9:

{{Quote|text= Know, therefore, that the Lord, your God He is God, the faithful God, Who keeps the covenant and loving kindness with those who love Him and keep His commandments to a thousand generations.&lt;ref&gt;(The [[Torah]] – A Modern Commentary; Union of American Hebrew Congregations, NY 1981 by W. G. Plaut)&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=[[Tanakh]]|source={{Bibleref|Deuteronomy|7:9|JPR}}}}

The specific tenets that compose required belief and their application to the times have been disputed throughout Jewish history. Today many, but not all, [[Orthodox Jew]]s have accepted [[Maimonides]]' Thirteen Principles of Belief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studentorgs.utexas.edu/cjso/Chabad/moshiach/techiya-masim.html The 13 Principles and the Resurrection of the Dead] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208182008/http://studentorgs.utexas.edu/cjso/Chabad/moshiach/techiya-masim.html |date=2006-02-08 }} from ''The Wolf Shall Lie With the Lamb'', Rabbi Shmuel Boteach (Oxford University)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a wide history of this dispute see: Shapiro, Marc: ''The Limits of Orthodox Theology: Maimonides' Thirteen Principles Reappraised'' (Littman Library of Jewish Civilization (Series).)&lt;/ref&gt;

A traditional example of ''Emunah'' as seen in the Jewish annals is found in the person of [[Abraham]]. On a number of occasions, Abraham both accepts statements from God that seem impossible and offers obedient actions in response to direction from God to do things that seem implausible (see [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 12-15).
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The [[Talmud]] describes how a thief also believes in G‑d: On the brink of his forced entry, as he is about to risk his life—and the life of his victim—he cries out with all sincerity, 'G‑d help me!' The thief has faith that there is a G‑d who hears his cries, yet it escapes him that this G‑d may be able to provide for him without requiring that he abrogate G‑d’s will by stealing from others. For ''emunah'' to affect him in this way he needs study and contemplation."&lt;ref name="chabad" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Sikhism ===
{{Main|Sikhism|Five Ks}}
Faith itself is not a religious concept in Sikhism. However, the five Sikh symbols, known as Kakaars or [[Five Ks]] (in Punjabi known as pañj kakkē or pañj kakār), are sometimes referred to as the ''Five articles of Faith''. The articles include ''[[Kesh (Sikhism)|kēs]]'' (uncut hair), ''[[Kanga (Sikhism)|kaṅghā]]'' (small wooden comb), ''[[Kara (Sikhism)|kaṛā]]'' (circular steel or iron bracelet), ''[[kirpan|kirpān]]'' (sword/dagger), and ''[[kaccha|kacchera]]'' (special undergarment). Baptised [[Sikhs]] are bound to wear those five articles of faith, at all times, to save them from bad company and keep them close to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realsikhism.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1193703788&amp;ucat=5|title=Sikhism: Five Articles of Faith|work=realsikhism.com|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epistemological validity ==
There is a wide spectrum of opinion with respect to the [[epistemological]] validity of faith&lt;ref name="isbn0-06-065292-6"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[C.S. Lewis|Lewis, C.S.]] |title=[[Mere Christianity]]: a revised and amplified edition, with a new introduction, of the three books, Broadcast talks, Christian behaviour, and Beyond personality |publisher=HarperSanFrancisco |location=[[San Francisco]] |year=2001 |isbn=0-06-065292-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; - that is, whether it is a reliable way to acquire true beliefs.

=== Fideism ===
{{Main|Fideism}}
Fideism is an [[epistemology|epistemological theory]] which maintains that faith is independent of [[reason]], or that reason and faith are hostile to each other and faith is superior at arriving at particular [[truth]]s (see [[natural theology]]). Fideism is not a synonym for religious belief, but describes a particular philosophical proposition in regard to the relationship between faith's appropriate jurisdiction at arriving at truths, contrasted against reason. It states that faith is needed to determine some philosophical and religious truths, and it questions the ability of reason to arrive at all truth. The word and concept had its origin in the mid- to late-19th century by way of [[Catholic]] thought, in a movement called [[Traditionalism (Catholicism)|Traditionalism]]. The Roman Catholic [[Magisterium]] has, however, repeatedly condemned [[fideism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/|title=Fideism|work=stanford.edu|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Support ===
[[Religious epistemology|Religious epistemologists]] have formulated and defended reasons for the rationality of accepting belief in God without the support of an argument.&lt;ref name=InternetReligious&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/relig-ep/ |title=Religious Epistemology |author=Clark, Kelly James |date=2 October 2004 |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some religious epistemologists hold that belief in God is more analogous to belief in a person than belief in a scientific hypothesis. Human relations demand trust and commitment. If belief in God is more like belief in other persons, then the trust that is appropriate to persons will be appropriate to God. American [[psychologist]] and [[philosopher]] [[William James]] offers a similar argument in his lecture ''[[The Will to Believe]].''&lt;ref name=InternetReligious /&gt;&lt;ref name=WillToBelieve&gt;{{cite journal |last=James |first=William |title=1896 |journal=New World |volume=5 |pages=327–347 |url=http://educ.jmu.edu//~omearawm/ph101willtobelieve.html |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Foundationalism]] is a view about the structure of justification or [[knowledge]].&lt;ref name="InternetFoundational"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/found-ep/ |title=Foundationalism |author=Poston, Ted |date=10 June 2010 |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="InternetFoundational" /&gt; Foundationalism holds that all knowledge and [[Theory of justification|justified belief]] are ultimately based upon what are called [[Basic belief|properly basic beliefs]]. This position is intended to resolve the [[Regress argument|infinite regress]] problem in [[epistemology]]. According to foundationalism, a belief is epistemically justified only if it is justified by properly basic beliefs. One of the significant developments in foundationalism is the rise of [[reformed epistemology]].&lt;ref name=InternetFoundational /&gt;

Reformed epistemology is a view about the epistemology of religious belief, which holds that belief in God can be properly basic. [[Analytic philosophy|Analytic]] philosophers [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]] develop this view.&lt;ref name=Plantinga1983&gt;{{cite book |title=Faith and Rationality: Reason and Belief in God |last=Plantinga |first=Alvin |authorlink=Alvin Plantinga |author2=Nicholas Wolterstorff |year=1983 |publisher=University of Notre Dame Press |location=Notre Dame, IN |isbn=0-268-00964-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga holds that an individual may rationally believe in God even though the individual does not possess sufficient evidence to convince an agnostic. One difference between reformed epistemology and [[fideism]] is that the former requires defence against known objections, whereas the latter might dismiss such objections as irrelevant.&lt;ref name=StanfordReligious&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-epistemology/ |title=The Epistemology of Religion |author=Forrest, Peter |date=11 March 2009 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga has developed reformed epistemology in ''Warranted Christian Belief'' as a form of [[externalism]] that holds that the [[Theory of justification|justification]] conferring factors for a belief may include external factors.&lt;ref name=Plantinga2000&gt;{{cite book |title=Warranted Christian Belief |last=Plantinga |first=Alvin |authorlink=Alvin Plantinga |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-513192-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Theism|theistic]] philosophers have defended theism by granting [[evidentialism]] but supporting theism through deductive arguments whose premises are considered justifiable. Some of these arguments are probabilistic, either in the sense of having weight but being inconclusive, or in the sense of having a [[probability|mathematical probability]] assigned to them.&lt;ref name=InternetReligious /&gt; Notable in this regard are the cumulative arguments presented by [[United Kingdom|British]] philosopher [[Basil Mitchell (academic)|Basil Mitchell]] and [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosopher [[Richard Swinburne]], whose arguments are based on [[Bayesian probability]].&lt;ref name=Mitchell1973&gt;{{cite book |title=The Justification of Religious Belief |last=Basic |first=Mitchell |authorlink=Basil Mitchell (academic) |publisher=Macmillan |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Swinburne1979&gt;{{cite book |title=The Existence of God |last=Swinburne |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Swinburne |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a notable exposition of his arguments, Swinburne appeals to an inference for the best explanation.&lt;ref name=Forrest1996&gt;{{cite book |title=God without the Supernatural |last=Forrest |first=Peter | authorlink=Peter Forrest (philosopher) |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Swinburne1997&gt;{{cite book |title=Is there a God? |last=Swinburne |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Swinburne |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Professor of Mathematics]] and [[philosopher of science]] at [[University of Oxford]] [[John Lennox]] has stated, "Faith is not a leap in the dark; it’s the exact opposite. It’s a commitment based on [[evidence]]… It is irrational to reduce all faith to blind faith and then subject it to ridicule. That provides a very anti-intellectual and convenient way of avoiding intelligent discussion.” He criticises [[Richard Dawkins]] as a famous proponent of asserting that faith equates to holding a belief without evidence, thus that it is possible to hold belief without evidence, for failing to provide evidence for this assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lennox|first=John|title=God's Undertaker: Has Science Buried God?|publisher=Lion UK|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{huh|date=May 2018}}

{{quote|Christians hold that their faith does good, but other faiths do harm. At any rate, they hold this about the communist faith. What I wish to maintain is that all faiths do harm. We may define “faith” as a firm belief in something for which there is no evidence. Where there is evidence, no one speaks of “faith.” We do not speak of faith that two and two are four or that the earth is round. We only speak of faith when we wish to substitute emotion for evidence. The substitution of emotion for evidence is apt to lead to strife, since different groups substitute different emotions. Christians have faith in the Resurrection; communists have faith in [[Labor theory of value|Marx’s Theory of Value]]. Neither faith can be defended rationally, and each therefore is defended by propaganda and, if necessary, by war.| Will Religious Faith Cure Our Troubles?}}

[[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] criticizes all faith by generalizing from specific faith in propositions that conflict directly with scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=The God Delusion|publisher=Bantam Books|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes faith as belief without evidence; a process of active non-thinking. He states that it is a practice that only degrades our understanding of the natural world by allowing anyone to make a claim about nature that is based solely on their personal thoughts, and possibly distorted perceptions, that does not require testing against nature, has no ability to make reliable and consistent predictions, and is not subject to peer review.&lt;ref name="Is Science a Religion?"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dawkins, Richard |date=January–February 1997 |url=http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/articles/dawkins.html |title=Is Science a Religion? |accessdate=15 March 2008 |publisher=American Humanist Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030144700/http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/articles/dawkins.html |archivedate=30 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophy professor Peter Boghossian argues that reason and evidence are the only way to determine which "claims about the world are likely true". Different religious traditions make different religious claims, and Boghossian asserts that faith alone cannot resolve conflicts between these without evidence. He gives as an example of the belief held by that Muslims that [[Muhammad]] (who died in the year 632) was the last prophet, and the contradictory belief held by Mormons that [[Joseph Smith]] (born in 1805) was a prophet. Boghossian asserts that faith has no "built-in corrective mechanism". For factual claims, he gives the example of the belief that the Earth is 4,000 years old. With only faith and no reason or evidence, he argues, there is no way to correct this claim if it is inaccurate. Boghossian advocates thinking of faith either as "belief without evidence" or "pretending to know things you don't know".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Manual for Creating Atheists |author=Peter Boghossian |year=2013 |publisher=Pitchstone Publishing |isbn=978-1-939578-09-9 |page=31}} &lt;/ref&gt;

A '''feud''' {{IPAc-en|f|juː|d}}, referred to in more extreme cases as a '''blood feud''', '''vendetta''', '''faida''', '''beef''', '''clan war''', '''gang war''', or '''private war''', is a long-running argument or fight, often between [[social group]]s of people, especially [[family|families]] or [[clan]]s. Feuds begin because one party (correctly or incorrectly) perceives itself to have been attacked, insulted or wronged by another. Intense feelings of [[resentment]] trigger the initial [[Retributive justice|retribution]], which causes the other party to feel equally aggrieved and [[revenge|vengeful]]. The dispute is subsequently fuelled by a long-running cycle of retaliatory [[violence]]. This continual cycle of provocation and retaliation makes it extremely difficult to end the feud peacefully. Feuds frequently involve the original parties' family members or associates, can last for [[generation]]s, and may result in extreme acts of [[violence]]. They can be interpreted as an extreme outgrowth of social relations based in [[family honor]].

Until the [[early modern period]], feuds were considered legitimate legal instruments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manaraefan.co.uk/index_files/Page3400.htm |title=Revenue, Lordship, Kinship &amp; Law |publisher=Manaraefan.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were regulated to some degree. For example, [[Serbs|Serb]] culture calls this ''krvna osveta'', meaning "blood revenge", which had unspoken{{dubious|date=January 2018}}&lt;!-- if people didn't talk about the rules of ''krvna osveta'', how did they know about them? --&gt; but highly valued rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boehm|first=Christopher|title=Blood Revenge: The Anthropology of Feuding in Montenegro and Other Tribal Societies|year=1984|publisher=The University of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kansas|isbn=0-7006-0245-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tribal societies, the blood feud, coupled with the practice of [[blood money (term)|blood wealth]], functioned as an effective form of social control for limiting and ending conflicts between individuals and groups who are related by [[kinship]], as described by anthropologist [[Max Gluckman]] in his article "The Peace in the Feud"&lt;ref&gt;Gluckman, Max. "The Peace in the Feud". ''Past and Present'', 1955, 8(1):1-14&lt;/ref&gt; in 1955.

== Blood feuds ==
{{Redirect|Blood feud||Blood Feud (disambiguation)}}
A '''blood feud''' is a feud with a cycle of retaliatory violence, with the relatives of someone who has been killed or otherwise wronged or [[honor|dishonored]] seeking vengeance by killing or otherwise physically punishing the culprits or their relatives. In the [[English-speaking world]], the Italian word '''''vendetta''''' is used to mean a blood feud, but in reality it means (personal) "vengeance" or "revenge", originating from the [[Latin]] ''vindicta'' ([[wikt:vengeance|vengeance]]), while the word ''[[:wiktionary:faida|faida]]'' would be more appropriate for a blood feud. In the English-speaking world, "vendetta" is sometimes extended to mean any other long-standing feud, not necessarily involving bloodshed. Sometimes, it is not mutual, but rather refers to a prolonged series of hostile acts waged by one person against another without reciprocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vendetta |title=Definition of vendetta |work=Merriam-Webster dictionary online|publisher=Merriam-Webster.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Blood feuds were common in societies with a weak rule of law (or where the state does not consider itself responsible for mediating this kind of dispute), where family and kinship ties are the main source of [[authority]]. An entire family is considered responsible for the actions of any of its members. Sometimes two separate branches of the same family have even come to blows, or worse, over some dispute.

[[File:1673 Heintz Wettstreit auf der Ponte dei Pugni in Venedig anagoria.JPG|thumb|Ponte dei Pugni ("Bridge of Fists") in [[Venice]] was used by rival clans to stage fist fights]]
The practice has mostly disappeared with more centralized societies where [[law enforcement]] and [[criminal law]] take responsibility for punishing lawbreakers.

In [[Homeric]] [[ancient Greece]], the practice of personal vengeance against wrongdoers was considered natural and customary: "Embedded in the Greek morality of retaliation is the right of vengeance... Feud is a war, just as war is an indefinite series of revenges; and such acts of vengeance are sanctioned by the gods".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=John Gwyn |last=Griffiths |title=The Divine Verdict: A Study of Divine Judgement in the Ancient Religions |year=1991 |page=90 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=90-04-09231-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ancient Israel|ancient Hebraic]] context, it was considered the duty of the individual and family to avenge evil on behalf of God. The executor of the law of blood-revenge who personally put the initial killer to death was given a special designation: ''[[go'el haddam]]'', the blood-avenger or blood-redeemer ([[Book of Numbers]] 35: 19, etc.). Six [[Cities of Refuge]] were established to provide protection and [[due process]] for any unintentional manslayers. The avenger was forbidden from harming the unintentional killer if the killer took refuge in one of these cities. As the ''Oxford Companion to the Bible'' states: "Since life was viewed as sacred ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 9.6), no amount of [[blood money (term)|blood money]] could be given as recompense for the loss of the life of an innocent person; it had to be [[lex talionis|'life for life']] ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 21.23; [[Deuteronomy]] 19.21)".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Oxford Companion to the Bible |first1=Bruce M. |last1=Metzger |first2=Michael D. |last2=Coogan |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |page=68 |isbn=0-19-504645-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Marc Bloch]]:
{{bquote|
The [[Middle Ages]], from beginning to end, and particularly the [[feudal]] era, lived under the sign of private [[revenge|vengeance]]. The [[Blame|onus]], of course, lay above all on the wronged individual; vengeance was imposed on him as the most sacred of duties ... The solitary individual, however, could do but little. Moreover, it was most commonly a death that had to be avenged. In this case the family group went into action and the ''faide'' (feud) came into being, to use the old Germanic word which spread little by little through the whole of Europe — 'the vengeance of the kinsmen which we call ''faida''', as a German canonist expressed it. No moral obligation seemed more sacred than this ... The whole kindred, therefore, placed as a rule under the command of a [[chieftain]], took up arms to punish the murder of one of its members or merely a wrong that he had suffered.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc Bloch]], trans. L. A. Manyon, ''Feudal Society'', Vol. I, 1965, p. 125-126&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:hoher atlas dadestal.jpg|thumb|A [[kasbah]] in the Dades valley, [[High Atlas]]. Historically, tribal feuding and banditry were a way of life for the [[Berber people|Berbers]] of Morocco.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} As a result, hundreds of ancient kasbahs were built.]]
[[Rita of Cascia]], a popular 15th-century Italian saint, was canonized by the [[Catholic Church]] due mainly to her great effort to end a feud in which her family was involved and which claimed the life of her husband.

The blood feud has certain similarities to the ritualized warfare found in many [[pre-industrial]] tribes. Thus, for instance, more than a third of [[Ya̧nomamö]] males, on average, died from [[Prehistoric warfare|warfare]]. The accounts of missionaries to the area have recounted constant infighting in the tribes for women or prestige, and evidence of continuous warfare for the [[enslavement]] of neighboring tribes such as the [[Marueta people|Macu]] before the arrival of European settlers and government.&lt;ref name="Keeley"&gt;Keeley, Lawrence H. ''[[War Before Civilization|War Before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage]]'' Oxford University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan's feudal past, the [[samurai]] class upheld the honor of their family, clan, and their lord by ''katakiuchi'' ({{lang|ja|敵討ち}}), or revenge killings. These killings could also involve the relatives of an offender. While some vendettas were punished by the government, such as that of the [[Forty-seven Ronin]], others were given official permission with specific targets.

At the [[Holy Roman Empire]]'s [[Diet of Worms (1495)|''Reichstag'' at Worms in 1495 AD]], the right of waging feuds was abolished. The [[Imperial Reform]] proclaimed an "eternal [[public peace]]" (''[[Ewiger Landfriede]]'') to put an end to the abounding feuds and the anarchy of the [[Robber baron (feudalism)|robber baron]]s, and it defined a new [[standing army|standing imperial army]] to enforce that peace. However, it took a few more decades until the new regulation was universally accepted.&lt;!-- non-reliable source &lt;ref&gt;{{NNDB|id=399/000096111|name=Maximilian I|accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In 1506, for example, knight Jan Kopidlansky killed a family rival in [[Prague]], and the town councillors sentenced him to death and had him executed.

Konrad Schott von Schottenstein|Nuremberg-Schott]] feud, in which Maximilian was forced to step in to halt the damages done by robber knight Schott.

In Greece, the custom of blood feud is found in several parts of the country, for instance in [[Crete]] and [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]]. Throughout history, the [[Maniots]] have been regarded by their neighbors and their enemies as fearless warriors who practice [[Maniots#Vendettas|blood feuds]], known in the Maniot dialect of Greek as "Γδικιωμός" (Gdikiomos). Many vendettas went on for months, some for years. The families involved would lock themselves in their towers and, when they got the chance, would murder members of the opposing family. The Maniot vendetta is considered the most vicious and ruthless;{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} it has led to entire family lines being wiped out. The last vendetta on record required the [[Greek Army]] with [[artillery]] support to force it to a stop. Regardless of this, the Maniot Greeks still practice vendettas even today. Maniots in America, Australia, Canada and [[Corsica]] still have on-going vendettas which have led to the creation of [[Mafia]] families known as "Γδικιωμέοι" (Gdikiomeoi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mani.org.gr/en/history/venteta.htm |title=Vendetta |publisher=Mani.org.gr |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2015}}

[[File:Vathia Mani Greece.jpg|thumb|[[Vatheia]], a typical Maniot village famous for its towers]]

In [[Corsica]], vendetta was a social code that required Corsicans to kill anyone who wronged the family honor. Between 1821 and 1852, no less than 4,300 murders were perpetrated in Corsica.&lt;ref&gt;Gregorovius, Ferdinand. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=udhEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Wanderings in Corsica: Its History and Its Heroes]''. (1855). p.&amp;nbsp;196. Retrieved 2015-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Late Middle Ages]], the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] was ravaged by the [[War of the Bands]], bitter partisan wars between local ruling families. In [[Navarre]], these conflicts became polarised in a violent struggle between the Agramont and Beaumont parties. In [[Biscay]], the two major warring factions were named Oinaz and Gamboa. (''Cf.'' the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]] in Italy). High defensive structures ("towers") built by local noble families, few of which survive today, were frequently razed by fires, and sometimes by royal decree.

Leontiy Lyulye, an expert on conditions in the [[Caucasus]], wrote in the mid-19th century: "Among the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|mountain people]] the blood feud is not an uncontrollable permanent feeling such as the vendetta is among the Corsicans. It is more like an obligation imposed by the public opinion." In the [[Dagestan]]i ''[[aul]]'' of Kadar, one such blood feud between two antagonistic clans lasted for nearly 260 years, from the 17th century till the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reliefweb.int/report/russian-federation/chechen-society-and-mentality |title=Chechen society and mentality |author=Souleimanov, Emil Aslan |work=Prague Watchdog |date=2003-05-25 |accessdate=2015-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ushguli1.JPG|thumb|The defensive towers built by feuding clans of [[Svaneti]], in the [[Caucasus]] mountains]]

The [[Celts|Celtic]] phenomenon of the ''blood feud'' demanded "an eye for an eye," and usually descended into murder. Disagreements between [[clan]]s might last for generations in Scotland and Ireland.

Due to the Celtic heritage of many people living in [[Appalachia]], a series of prolonged violent engagements in late nineteenth-century [[Kentucky]] and [[West Virginia]] were referred to commonly as feuds, a tendency that was partly due to the nineteenth-century popularity of [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Sir Walter Scott]], both of whom had written [[historical fiction|semihistorical]] accounts of blood feuds. These incidents, the most famous of which was the [[Hatfield–McCoy feud]], were regularly featured in the newspapers of the eastern U.S. between the [[Reconstruction Era]] and the early twentieth century, and are seen by some as linked to a [[Culture of honor (Southern United States)|Southern culture of honor]] with its roots in the [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] forebears of the residents of the area.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malcolm Gladwell]], ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]'' (2008), Chapter 6, citing, for example, [[David Hackett Fischer]], ''[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent example is the [[Regulator–Moderator War]], which took place between rival factions in the [[Republic of Texas]]. It is sometimes considered the largest blood feud in American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texasescapes.com/AllThingsHistorical/The-Worst-Feud-BB1006.htm |title=The Worst Feud |publisher=TexasEscapes.com |author=Bowman, Bob|date=2006-10-15 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative to feud was ''[[blood money (term)|blood money]]'' (or ''[[weregild]]'' in the [[Norsemen|Norse]] culture), which demanded payment of some kind from those responsible for a wrongful death, even an accidental one. If these payments were not made, or were refused by the offended party, a blood feud would ensue.

===Feuds in modern times===
Blood feuds are still practised in some areas in:
* France (especially [[Corsica]] and within [[Sinti|Manush]] communities)
* Ireland (especially [[Dublin]] and [[Limerick]])
* In Northern Ireland between [[Republican movement (Ireland)|Irish republican]] and [[Loyalist|Ulster loyalism]] communities; particularly during [[The Troubles]]
* [[Southern Italy]] (especially [[Sicily]],  [[Campania]], [[Calabria]], [[Apulia]] and other areas of the same territory)&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/police-search-calabrian-village-as-murders-are-linked-to-clan-feud-461917.html Police search Calabrian village as murders are linked to clan feud]", ''The Independent'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226231852/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/police-search-calabrian-village-as-murders-are-linked-to-clan-feud-461917.html |date=February 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blood feuds within [[Russian people|Russian]] communities do exist (mostly related to criminal gangs), but are neither as common nor as pervasive as they are in the [[Caucasus]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In the United States, blood feuds are also not as pervasive or common, but do exist within the [[African-American]] and [[Chicano]] communities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lGBsoIz8KncC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=chicano+++++feuds&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UU_Wayz1N5&amp;sig=KM2jXLtITX1UXZhy59sUKucIXDU&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-oRZUPGwMcm0hAfP_4HICw&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=chicano%20%20%20%20%20feuds&amp;f=false|title=Chicano Timespace: The Poetry and Politics of Ricardo Sánchez|author=López, Miguel R.|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=2000|accessdate=2015-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes gang-related, but not necessarily).

This has resulted in gun violence and murders in cities like [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Miami]], [[Ciudad Juarez]], [[Medellin]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Cape Town]], [[Amsterdam]], [[London]], [[Liverpool]], and [[Glasgow]], to name just a few.

Blood feuds also have a long history within the White [[Southern United States|Southern]] population of the U.S., where it is called the "[[Culture of honor (Southern United States)|culture of honor]]", and still exist to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://untpress.unt.edu/catalog/3376|author=Parsons, Chuck|title=The Sutton-Taylor Feud: The Deadliest Blood Feud in Texas|publisher=University of North Texas Press|year=2013|pages=400|accessdate=2015-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Albania====
{{main|Gjakmarrja}}
In [[Albania]], ''[[gjakmarrja]]'' (blood feuding) is a tradition. They have returned in rural areas after more than 40 years of being abolished by Albanian communists led by [[Enver Hoxha]], and more than 3000 Albanian families are currently engaged in them.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} There are now more than 1,600 families who live under an ever-present death sentence because of them, and since 1992, at least 10,000 [[Albanians]] have been killed in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2008/0625/p01s02-woeu.html |title=Peacemaker breaks the ancient grip of Albania's blood feuds |work=The Christian Science Monitor |author=White, Jeffrey|publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=2008-05-25 |accessdate=2015-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood feuds in Albania trace back to the Kanun, this custom is also practiced among the Albanians of Kosovo

A feud may develop into a vicious circle of further [[murder|killings]], retaliation, [[counterattack]]s, and all-out [[war]]fare that can end in the mutual extinction of both families. Often the original cause is forgotten, and feuds continue simply because it is perceived that there has always been a feud.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

====Kosovo====
Blood feuds have also been part of a centuries-old tradition in [[Kosovo]], tracing back to the [[Kanun (Albania)|Kanun]], a 15th-century codification of Albanian customary rules. In the early 1990s, most cases of blood feuds were reconciled in the course of a large-scale reconciliation movement to end blood feuds led by [[Anton Çetta]].&lt;ref name="BJC2017"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://academic.oup.com/bjc/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bjc/azx002/2990197 |title=Did Nonviolent Resistance Fail in Kosovo? |last1=Marsavelski |first1=Aleksandar |last2=Sheremeti |first2=Furtuna |last3=Braithwaite |first3=John |website=British Journal of Criminology |accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest reconciliation gathering took place at Verrat e Llukës on 1 May 1990, which had between 100,000 and 500,000 participants. By 1992 the reconciliation campaign ended at least 1,200 deadly blood feuds, and in 1993 not a single homicide occurred in Kosovo.&lt;ref name="BJC2017"/&gt;

====Republic of Ireland====
Criminal gang feuds also exist in [[Dublin]], Ireland and in the Republic's third-largest city, [[Limerick]]. [[Irish Travellers|Traveller]] feuds are also common in towns across the country. Feuds can be due to personal issues, money, or disrespect, and grudges can last generations. Since 2001, over 300 people have been killed in feuds between different drugs gangs, [[dissident republican]]s, and [[Irish Travellers|Traveller]] families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/garda%C3%AD-suspect-dublin-drug-feud-link-in-double-killing-1.477711 |title=Gardaí suspect Dublin drug feud link in double killing |author=Lally, Conor |work=The Irish Times |publisher=IrishTimes.com |date=2012-03-09 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2015}}

====Philippines====
Family and clan feuds, known locally as ''[[rido]]'', are characterized by sporadic outbursts of retaliatory violence between families and kinship groups, as well as between communities. It can occur in areas where the government or a central authority is weak, as well as in areas where there is a perceived lack of justice and security. ''Rido'' is a [[Maranao language|Maranao]] term commonly used in [[Mindanao]] to refer to clan feuds. It is considered one of the major problems in Mindanao because, apart from numerous casualties, ''rido'' has caused destruction of property, crippled local economies, and displaced families.

Located in the southern Philippines, Mindanao is home to a majority of the country’s Muslim community, and includes the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]]. Mindanao "is a region suffering from poor infrastructure, high poverty, and violence that has claimed the lives of more than 120,000 in the last three decades."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiafoundation.org/2007/10/31/in-the-philippines-conflict-resolution-in-mindanao/ |title=In the Philippines: Conflict in Mindanao |author=Wilfredo Magno Torres III |accessdate=September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a widely held stereotype that the violence is perpetrated by armed groups that resort to terrorism to further their political goals, but the actual situation is far more complex. While the Muslim-Christian conflict and the state-rebel conflicts dominate popular perceptions and media attention, a survey commissioned by [[The Asia Foundation]] in 2002 — and further verified by a recent [[Social Weather Stations]] survey — revealed that citizens are more concerned about the prevalence of ''rido'' and its negative impact on their communities than the conflict between the state and rebel groups.&lt;ref name="Torres, Wilfredo M 2007" /&gt; The unfortunate interaction and subsequent confusion of ''rido''-based violence with [[secession]]ism, [[communist]] [[insurgency]], banditry, military involvement and other forms of armed violence shows that violence in Mindanao is more complicated than what is commonly believed.

''Rido'' has wider implications for conflict in Mindanao, primarily because it tends to interact in unfortunate ways with separatist conflict and other forms of armed violence. Many armed confrontations in the past involving insurgent groups and the military were triggered by a local ''rido''. The studies cited above investigated the dynamics of ''rido'' with the intention of helping design strategic interventions to address such conflicts.

=====Causes=====
The causes of ''rido'' are varied and may be further complicated by a society's concept of [[Face (sociological concept)|honor and shame]], an integral aspect of the social rules that determine accepted practices in the affected communities. The triggers for conflicts range from petty offenses, such as theft and jesting, to more serious crimes, like homicide. These are further aggravated by land disputes and political rivalries, the most common causes of ''rido''. Proliferation of firearms, lack of law enforcement and credible mediators in conflict-prone areas, and an inefficient justice system further contribute to instances of ''rido''.

=====Statistics=====
Studies on ''rido'' have documented a total of 1,266 ''rido'' cases between the 1930s and 2005, which have killed over 5,500 people and displaced thousands. The four provinces with the highest numbers of ''rido'' incidences are: [[Lanao del Sur]] (377), [[Maguindanao]] (218), [[Lanao del Norte]] (164), and [[Sulu Province|Sulu]] (145). Incidences in these four provinces account for 71% of the total documented cases. The findings also show a steady rise in ''rido'' conflicts in the eleven provinces surveyed from the 1980s to 2004. According to the studies, during 2002–2004, 50% (637 cases) of total ''rido'' incidences occurred, equaling about 127 new ''rido'' cases per year. Out of the total number of ''rido'' cases documented, 64% remain unresolved.&lt;ref name="Torres, Wilfredo M 2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Torres, Wilfredo M. (ed) |year=2007 |title=Rido: Clan Feuding and Conflict Management in Mindanao |location=[[Makati]] |publisher=[[The Asia Foundation]] |pages=348 |isbn=978-971-92445-2-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Resolution=====
''Rido'' conflicts are either resolved, unresolved, or reoccurring. Although the majority of these cases remain unresolved, there have been many resolutions through different conflict-resolving bodies and mechanisms. These cases can utilize the formal procedures of the Philippine government or the various indigenous systems. Formal methods may involve official courts, local government officials, police, and the military. Indigenous methods to resolve conflicts usually involve elder leaders who use local knowledge, beliefs, and practices, as well as their own personal influence, to help repair and restore damaged relationships. Some cases using this approach involve the payment of [[blood money (term)|blood money]] to resolve the conflict. Hybrid mechanisms include the collaboration of government, religious, and traditional leaders in resolving conflicts through the formation of collaborative groups. Furthermore, the institutionalization of traditional conflict resolution processes into laws and ordinances has been successful with the hybrid method approach. Other conflict-resolution methods include the establishment of ceasefires and the intervention of youth organizations.&lt;ref name="Torres, Wilfredo M 2007"/&gt;

The '''first-sale doctrine''' is a legal concept playing an important role in U.S. [[copyright]] and [[trademark]] law by limiting certain rights of a copyright or trademark owner. The doctrine enables the distribution chain of copyrighted products, library lending, giving, video rentals and secondary markets for copyrighted works (for example, enabling individuals to sell their legally purchased books or CDs to others). In trademark law, this same doctrine enables reselling of trademarked products after the trademark holder put the products on the market. The doctrine is also referred to as the "right of first sale," "first sale rule," or "exhaustion rule."

The first-sale doctrine is one of the [[limitations and exceptions to copyright]].

==Overview==
Copyright law grants a copyright owner an exclusive right "to distribute copies or [[phonorecord]]s of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending." [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106 17 U.S.C. 106(3)]. This is called a "distribution right" and differs from the copyright owner's "reproduction right" which involves making copies of the copyrighted works. Rather than the right to copy, the distribution right involves the right to transfer physical copies or phonorecords (i.e., recorded music) of the copyrighted work. For example, the distribution right could be infringed when a retailer acquires and sells to the public unlawfully made audio or video tapes. Although the retailer may not have copied the work in any way and may not have known that the tapes were made unlawfully, he nevertheless infringes the distribution right by the sale. The distribution right allows the copyright owner to seek redress from any member in the chain of distribution.

The first-sale doctrine creates a basic exception to the copyright holder's distribution right. Once the work is lawfully sold or even transferred gratuitously, the copyright owner's interest in the material object in which the copyrighted work is embodied is exhausted. The owner of the material object can then dispose of it as he sees fit. Thus, one who buys a copy of a book is entitled to resell it, rent it, give it away, or destroy it. However, the owner of the copy of the book will not be able to make new copies of the book because the first-sale doctrine does not limit copyright owner's reproduction right. The rationale of the doctrine is to prevent the copyright owner from restraining the free [[Alienation (property law)|alienability of goods]]. Without the doctrine, a possessor of a copy of a copyrighted work would have to negotiate with the copyright owner every time he wished to dispose of his copy. After the initial transfer of ownership of a legal copy of a copyrighted work, the first-sale doctrine exhausts copyright holder's right to control how ownership of that copy can be disposed of. For this reason, this doctrine is also referred to as the "exhaustion rule."

The doctrine was first recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1908 (see ''[[Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus]]'') and subsequently codified in the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/109 17 U.S.C. § 109]. In the ''Bobbs-Merrill'' case, the publisher, Bobbs-Merrill, had inserted a notice in its books that any retail sale at a price under $1.00 would constitute an infringement of its copyright. The defendants, who owned [[Macy's]] department store, disregarded the notice and sold the books at a lower price without Bobbs-Merrill's consent. The Supreme Court held that the exclusive statutory right to "vend" applied only to the first sale of the copyrighted work.

Section 109(a) provides:
"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106 (3), the owner of a particular copy or [[phonorecord]] lawfully made under this title, or any person authorized by such owner, is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord." The elements of the first sale doctrine can be summarized as follows: (1) the copy was lawfully made with the authorization of the copyright owner; (2) ownership of the copy was initially transferred under the copyright owner's authority; (3) the defendant is a lawful owner of the copy in question; and (4) the defendant's use implicates the distribution right only; not the reproduction or some other right given to the copyright owner.

===Application to public display right===
[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/109 17 U.S.C. §109(c)] creates a limited exception to a copyright owner's public display right. Owners of a lawful copy of a copyrighted work can, without permission from the copyright owner, display that copy to viewers present at the place where the copy is located. {{cn span|text=For example, an owner of copy of a computer program (and ''only'' a computer program under §109(c)) cannot display the copy publicly on a website under this provision.|date=December 2013}}

An [[amicus brief]] in ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]]'' argued that Section 109 was a key provision for US art museums:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Most U.S. art museums have permanent collections that were acquired through purchases, gifts, and bequests, and on which they draw for exhibitions to the public. Museums also present special exhibitions, largely made up of works not in their collections, through loans from private collectors, galleries, and other institutions. For all these activities museums depend on the protections afforded by Section 109. Section 109(c) provides that the owner of a particular copy "lawfully made under this title" is entitled to display that copy publicly without the copyright owner's permission. Section 109(a) similarly allows museums to buy, borrow, loan, and sell such "lawfully made" artworks.&lt;ref&gt;No. 11-697, [http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/briefs/11-697_petitioneramcuassnofartmuseumdirectorsetal.authcheckdam.pdf BRIEF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF ART MUSEUM DIRECTORS, THE ART INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO, THE J. PAUL GETTY TRUST, MUSEUM ASSOCIATES DBA LOS ANGELES COUNTY MUSEUM OF ART, THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, THE SAN FRANCISCO MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, THE SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM FOUNDATION, THE WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART, ET AL. AS AMICI CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONER], p2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Limitations ==
The first sale doctrine only limits the distribution rights of copyright holders. This principle sometimes clashes with the holder's other rights, such as the right of reproduction &amp; derivative work rights. For example, in [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7811317241368435030 ''Lee v. A.R.T. Co.''], the defendant bought plaintiff's artworks in the form of notecards and then mounted them on ceramic tiles, covering the artworks with transparent epoxy resin. Despite plaintiff's assertion of violation of his right to prepare derivative works, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|7th Circuit]] held that the derivative work right was not violated and that defendant's sale of the tiles was protected under the first sale doctrine. However, based on very similar facts, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th Circuit]] in [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1465323101896646559 ''Mirage Editions, Inc. v. Albuquerque A.R.T. Company''] held that plaintiff's right to prepare derivative works was infringed and that the first sale doctrine did not protect the defendant under such circumstances.

===Application to digital copies===
The first-sale doctrine does not neatly fit transfers of copies of digital works because an actual transfer does not actually happen – instead, the recipient receives a new copy of the work while, at the same time, the sender has the original copy (unless that copy is deleted, either automatically or manually). For example, this exact issue played out in [[Capitol Records, LLC v. ReDigi Inc.]], a case involving online marketplace for pre-owned digital music.

E-books have the same issue. Because the first sale doctrine does not apply to electronic books, libraries cannot freely lend e-books indefinitely after purchase. Instead, electronic book publishers came up with business models to sell the subscriptions to the license of the text. This results in e-book publishers placing restrictions on the number of times an e-book can circulate and/or the amount of time a book is within a collection before a library's license expires, then the book no longer belongs to them.&lt;ref&gt;Chiarizio, M. (2013). An American Tragedy: E-Books, Licenses, and the End of Public Lending Libraries?  Vanderbilt Law Review, 66(2), 615-644.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question is whether the first-sale doctrine should be retooled to reflect the realities of the digital age. Physical copies degrade over time, whereas digital information may not. Works in digital format can be reproduced without any flaws and can be disseminated worldwide without much difficulty. Thus, applying the first sale doctrine to digital copies affects the market for the original to a greater degree than transfers of physical copies. The [[United States Copyright Office|U.S. Copyright Office]] stated that "[t]he tangible nature of a copy is a defining element of the first sale doctrine and critical to its rationale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Summary Digital Millennium Copyright Act Section 104 Report |url=http://www.copyright.gov/reports/studies/dmca/dmca_executive.html|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled, on July 3, 2012, that it is indeed permissible to resell software licenses even if the digital good has been downloaded directly from the Internet, and that the first sale doctrine applied whenever software was originally sold to a customer for an unlimited amount of time, as such sale involves a transfer of ownership, thus prohibiting any software maker from preventing the resale of their software by any of their legitimate owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,16069323,00.html|title=Oracle loses court fight over software resale rules|quote=''A European court has ruled that it's permissible to resell software licenses even if the package has been downloaded directly from the Internet.

===Ownership requirement===
For the first sale doctrine to apply, lawful "ownership" of the copy or phonorecord is required. As [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/109 §109(d)] prescribes, first sale doctrine does not apply if the possession of the copy is "by rental, lease, loan, or otherwise without acquiring ownership of it."

Some software and digital content publishers claim in their [[end-user license agreement]]s (EULA) that their software or content is licensed, not sold, and thus the first sale doctrine does not apply to their works. These publishers have had some success in contracting around first sale doctrine through various [[clickwrap]], [[shrink wrap]], and other license agreements. For example, if someone buys [[MP3]] songs from Amazon.com, the MP3 files are merely licensed to them and hence they may not be able to resell those MP3 files. However, MP3 songs bought through [[iTunes Store]] may be characterized as "sales" because of Apple's language in its EULA and hence they may be resell-able, if other requirements of first sale doctrine are met.

Courts have struggled and taken dramatically different approaches to sort out when only a license was granted to the end user as compared to ownership. Most of these cases involved software-licensing agreements. In general, courts look beneath the surface of the agreements to conclude whether the agreements create a licensing relationship or if they amount to, in substance, sales subject to first sale doctrine under §109(a). Thus, specifying that the agreement grants only a "license" is necessary to create the licensing relationship, but not sufficient. Other terms of the agreement should be consistent with such a licensing relationship.

In ''[[Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc.]]'' the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th Circuit]] created a three-factor test to decide whether a particular software licensing agreement is successful in creating a licensing relationship with the end user. The factors include: 1) whether a copyright owner specifies that a user is granted a license; 2) whether the copyright owner significantly restricts the user's ability to transfer the software to others; and 3) whether the copyright owner imposes notable use restrictions on the software. In ''Vernor'', [[Autodesk]]'s license agreement specified that it retains title to the software and the user is only granted a non-exclusive license. The agreement also had restrictions against modifying, translating, or reverse-engineering the software, or removing any proprietary marks from the software packaging or documentation. The agreement also specified that software could not be transferred or leased without Autodesk's written consent, and could not be transferred outside the Western Hemisphere. Based on these facts, the 9th Circuit held that the user is only a licensee of Autodesk's software, not an owner and hence the user could not resell the software on eBay without Autodesk's permission.

However, the same 9th Circuit panel that decided ''Vernor v. Autodesk'', refused to apply ''Vernor's'' three-factor test in ''[[UMG v. Augusto]]'' to a purported licensing agreement created when UMG sent unsolicited promotional CDs to music critics. The promotional CDs' packaging contained the language: "This CD is the property of the record company and is licensed to the intended recipient for personal use only. Acceptance of this CD shall constitute an agreement to comply with the terms of the license. Resale or transfer of possession is not allowed and may be punishable under federal and state laws." Augusto tried to sell these CDs on eBay and UMG argued that first sale doctrine did not apply since the CDs were not sold and only a licensing relationship was created. However the court held that first sale doctrine applies when a copy is given away and that recipients of the promotional CDs did not accept the terms of the license agreement by merely not sending back the unsolicited CDs.

In the case ''[[UsedSoft]] v Oracle'', the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled that the sale of a software product, either through a physical support or download, constituted a transfer of ownership in EU law, thus the first sale doctrine applies; the ruling thereby breaks the "licensed, not sold" legal theory, but leaves open numerous questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerlaw.co.uk/2012/the-legality-of-second-hand-software-sales-in-the-eu/|title=The legality of second hand software sales in the EU|author=Jas Purewal|publisher=gamerlaw.co.uk}} (mirror [http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/173538/ here])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importation of copies===
[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/602 Section 602(a)(1)] of the Copyright statute states that "importation into the United States, without the authority of the owner of copyright under this title, of copies or [[phonorecord]]s of a work that have been acquired outside the United States is an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute copies or phonorecords." This provision provides copyright owner an opportunity to stop goods from entering the United States market altogether.

Application of this provision created difficult legal issues in the context of [[gray market]] products. Gray market dealers buy the genuine goods in foreign countries at a significant discount from U.S. prices. They then import these genuine goods into the U.S. and sell them at discount prices, undercutting the authorized U.S. dealers. The gray market exists where the price for goods outside the US is lower than the price inside.

On the surface, §602(a), barring unauthorized importation, would seem to clash with the first-sale doctrine, which permits the resale of lawfully made copies. The issue comes down to whether §602(a) creates an affirmative right to bar all unauthorized importation, or does the first-sale doctrine limit the reach of §602(a), thus permitting the resale of at least some lawfully made imported copies.

In 1998, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[Quality King Distributors Inc., v. L'anza Research International Inc.|Quality King v. L'Anza]]'' found that first-sale doctrine applied to imported goods at least where the imported goods are first lawfully made in the United States, shipped abroad for resale, and later reenter the United States. That case involved importation of hair care products bearing copyrighted labels. A unanimous Supreme Court found that the first-sale doctrine does apply to importation into the US of copyrighted works (the labels), which were made in the US and then exported.

However, the Supreme Court did not decide the issue where gray-market products are initially manufactured abroad and then imported into the US. The Court indicated that importation of goods made outside the US could perhaps be barred under §602(a), since such goods would not be "lawfully made under this title." Such products might be lawfully made, either by the copyright owner or a licensee, but they would not be lawfully made under US copyright law. Rather, they would be lawfully made under the copyright laws of the other country; and the first-sale doctrine would therefore not limit the §602 importation restriction.

The 2008 ''[[Omega S.A. v. Costco Wholesale Corp.|Omega v. Costco]]'' case involved this exact unresolved issue, where the defendant [[Costco]] obtained authentic Omega watches, which feature a copyrighted design on the back of the watches, through the gray market and resold them in its stores in the US. Omega manufactured these watches outside the US and did not authorize their importation into the US. Based on the ''Quality King'' case, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th Circuit]] held that "application of first-sale doctrine to foreign-made copies would impermissibly apply" the Copyright Act extraterritorially. However, the court stated that first-sale doctrine might still apply to a foreign manufactured copy if it was imported "with the authority of the U.S. copyright owner." The Supreme Court granted certiorari to ''Omega v. Costco'', and affirmed 4-4.  However, as an evenly split decision, it set precedent only in the 9th Circuit, not nationwide.&lt;ref name="libraryjournal omega"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/communityacademiclibraries/889113-419/in_wake_of_costco_v..csp | title=In Wake of Costco v. Omega, Libraries Can Proceed with "Fair Degree of Confidence" | publisher=Library Journal | date=February 3, 2011 | accessdate=November 28, 2012 | author=Hadro, Josh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc. v. Kirtsaeng |url= https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013, the [[United States Supreme Court]] held in a 6-3 decision that the first-sale doctrine applies to goods manufactured abroad with the copyright owner's permission and then imported into the US.  The case involved a plaintiff who imported Asian editions of textbooks that had been manufactured abroad with the publisher-plaintiff's permission. The defendant, without permission from the publisher, imported the textbooks and resold on eBay. The Supreme Court's holding severely limits the ability of copyright holders to charge vastly different prices in different markets due to ease of [[arbitrage]]. The decision removes the incentive to US manufacturers of shifting manufacturing abroad purely in an attempt to circumvent the first-sale doctrine.

==Exceptions==

===Record rentals===
The Record Rental Amendment of 1984, codified in 17 USC §109(b) prohibits an owner of a phonorecord that embodies a sound recording or musical work from renting it to the public for direct or indirect commercial advantage. This exception was designed to prevent music stores from renting records and thereby facilitating home copying.

Section 109(b) is an exception to the first sale doctrine, but it is limited in several ways. It applies only to rentals, and not to resale or other transfers.  It is also limited to a subset of sound recordings—only those sound recordings that contain only a musical work.  It does not apply to sound recordings that contain other content, such as commentaries or dialog soundtrack, or to non-musical sound recordings, for example [[audiobook]]s. Lastly, libraries and educational institutions are exempt from this restriction, and may rent or loan musical sound recordings.

===Software rentals===
The Copyright Software Rental Amendments Act of 1990 amended §109(b) further to prohibit rentals of computer software for direct or indirect commercial advantage. The exception does not apply to lending of a copy by a nonprofit library for nonprofit purposes, provided the library affixes an appropriate warning. The amendment also specifically excluded:
* A computer program which is embodied in a machine or product and which cannot be copied during the ordinary operation or use of the machine or product; or
* A computer program embodied in or used in conjunction with a [[Video game console|limited purpose computer that is designed for playing video games]] and may be designed for other purposes.

==Application in trademark law==
With reference to trade in tangible merchandise, such as the retailing of goods bearing a trademark, the first sale doctrine serves to immunize a reseller from infringement liability. Such protection to the reseller extends to the point where said goods have not been altered so as to be materially different from those originating from the trademark owner.

{{General relativity |phenomena}}

'''Frame-dragging''' is an effect on [[spacetime]], predicted by [[Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]], that is due to non-static stationary distributions of [[mass–energy]]. A stationary [[Field (physics)|field]] is one that is in a steady state, but the masses causing that field may be non-static, rotating for instance. More generally, the subject of effects caused by mass–energy currents is known as [[gravitomagnetism]], in analogy with [[classical electromagnetism]]. 

The first frame-dragging effect was derived in 1918, in the framework of general relativity, by the Austrian physicists [[Josef Lense]] and [[Hans Thirring]], and is also known as the [[Lense–Thirring effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thirring |first=H. |authorlink= |date=1918 |title=Über die Wirkung rotierender ferner Massen in der Einsteinschen Gravitationstheorie |journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift |volume=19 |issue= |page=33 |bibcode=1918PhyZ...19...33T |url= |accessdate= |quote=}} [On the Effect of Rotating Distant Masses in Einstein's Theory of Gravitation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thirring |first=H. |authorlink= |date=1921 |title=Berichtigung zu meiner Arbeit: ‘Über die Wirkung rotierender Massen in der Einsteinschen Gravitationstheorie’ |journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift |volume=22 |issue= |page=29 |bibcode=1921PhyZ...22...29T |url= |accessdate= |quote=}} [Correction to my paper "On the Effect of Rotating Distant Masses in Einstein's Theory of Gravitation"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lense |first=J. |authorlink= |author2=Thirring, H. |date=1918 |title=Über den Einfluss der Eigenrotation der Zentralkörper auf die Bewegung der Planeten und Monde nach der Einsteinschen Gravitationstheorie |journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift |volume=19 |issue= |pages=156–163 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode=1918PhyZ...19..156L}} [On the Influence of the Proper Rotation of Central Bodies on the Motions of Planets and Moons According to Einstein's Theory of Gravitation]&lt;/ref&gt; They predicted that the rotation of a massive object would distort the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|spacetime metric]], making the orbit of a nearby test particle [[precess]]. This does not happen in [[Newtonian mechanics]] for which the [[gravitational field]] of a body depends only on its mass, not on its rotation. The Lense–Thirring effect is very small—about one part in a few trillion. To detect it, it is necessary to examine a very massive object, or build an instrument that is very sensitive.

In 2015, new general-relativistic extensions of Newtonian rotation laws were formulated to describe geometric dragging of frames which incorporates a newly discovered antidragging effect.&lt;ref&gt;Patryk Mach and Edward Malec, General-relativistic rotation laws in rotating fluid bodies, Phys. Rev. D 91, 124053 – Published 17 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
'''Rotational frame-dragging''' (the [[Lense–Thirring effect]]) appears in the [[general principle of relativity]] and similar theories in the vicinity of rotating massive objects. Under the Lense–Thirring effect, the frame of reference in which a clock ticks the fastest is one which is revolving around the object as viewed by a distant observer. This also means that light traveling in the direction of rotation of the object will move past the massive object faster than light moving against the rotation, as seen by a distant observer. It is now the best known frame-dragging effect, partly thanks to the [[Gravity Probe B]] experiment. Qualitatively, frame-dragging can be viewed as the gravitational analog of [[electromagnetic induction]].

Also, an inner region is dragged more than an outer region. This produces interesting locally rotating frames. For example, imagine that a north-south–oriented ice skater, in orbit over the equator of a black hole and rotationally at rest with respect to the stars, extends her arms. The arm extended toward the black hole will be "torqued" spinward due to gravitomagnetic induction ("torqued" is in quotes because gravitational effects are not considered "forces" under [[General relativity|GR]]). Likewise the arm extended away from the black hole will be torqued anti-spinward. She will therefore be rotationally sped up, in a counter-rotating sense to the black hole. This is the opposite of what happens in everyday experience. There exists a particular rotation rate that, should she be initially rotating at that rate when she extends her arms, inertial effects and frame-dragging effects will balance and her rate of rotation will not change. Due to the [[equivalence principle]], gravitational effects are locally indistinguishable from inertial effects, so this rotation rate, at which when she extends her arms nothing happens, is her local reference for non-rotation. This frame is rotating with respect to the fixed stars and counter-rotating with respect to the black hole. This effect is analogous to the [[hyperfine structure]] in atomic spectra due to nuclear spin. A useful metaphor is a [[planetary gear]] system with the black hole being the sun gear, the ice skater being a planetary gear and the outside universe being the ring gear. See [[Mach's principle]].

Another interesting consequence is that, for an object constrained in an equatorial orbit, but not in freefall, it weighs more if orbiting anti-spinward, and less if orbiting spinward. For example, in a suspended equatorial bowling alley, a bowling ball rolled anti-spinward would weigh more than the same ball rolled in a spinward direction. Note, frame dragging will neither accelerate or slow down the bowling ball in either direction. It is not a "viscosity". Similarly, a stationary [[plumb-bob]] suspended over the rotating object will not list. It will hang vertically. If it starts to fall, induction will push it in the spinward direction.

'''Linear frame dragging''' is the similarly inevitable result of the general principle of relativity, applied to [[linear momentum]]. Although it arguably has equal theoretical legitimacy to the "rotational" effect, the difficulty of obtaining an experimental verification of the effect means that it receives much less discussion and is often omitted from articles on frame-dragging (but see Einstein, 1921).&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, A ''The Meaning of Relativity'' (contains transcripts of his 1921 Princeton lectures).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Static mass increase''' is a third effect noted by Einstein in the same paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Meaning of Relativity |last=Einstein |first=A. |authorlink= |date=1987 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |location=London |isbn= |page= |pages=95–96 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is an increase in [[inertia]] of a body when other masses are placed nearby. While not strictly a frame dragging effect (the term frame dragging is not used by Einstein), it is demonstrated by Einstein that it derives from the same equation of general relativity. It is also a tiny effect that is difficult to confirm experimentally.

A somewhat equivalent, cheaper version of such an idea was put forth in 1986 by Ciufolini&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ciufolini |first=I. |authorlink= |year=1986 |month= |title=Measurement of Lense–Thirring Drag on High-Altitude Laser-Ranged Artificial Satellites |journal=Phys.

The measurable quantity was, in this case, the sum of the nodes of LAGEOS and of the new spacecraft, later named LAGEOS III, [[LARES (satellite)|LARES]], WEBER-SAT.

Limiting the scope to the scenarios involving existing orbiting bodies, the first proposal to use the LAGEOS satellite and the Satellite Laser Ranging ([[Satellite laser ranging|SLR]]) technique to measure the Lense–Thirring effect dates back to 1977–1978.&lt;ref&gt;Cugusi, L., Proverbio E.

Astrophys'', '''69''', 321–325, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Tests have started to be effectively performed by using the LAGEOS and [[LAGEOS II]] satellites in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;Ciufolini, I., Lucchesi, D.

In the case of stars orbiting close to a spinning, supermassive black hole, frame dragging should cause the star's orbital plane to [[Lense–Thirring precession|precess]] about the black hole spin axis. This effect should be detectable within the next few years via [[astrometry|astrometric]] monitoring of stars at the center of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
c^{2} d\tau^{2} =&amp;
\left( 1 - \frac{r_{s} r}{\rho^{2}} \right) c^{2} dt^{2}
- \frac{\rho^{2}}{\Lambda^{2}} dr^{2}
- \rho^{2} d\theta^{2} \\
&amp; {} - \left( r^{2} + \alpha^{2} + \frac{r_{s} r \alpha^{2}}{\rho^{2}} \sin^{2} \theta \right) \sin^{2} \theta \ d\phi^{2}
+ \frac{2r_{s} r\alpha c \sin^{2} \theta }{\rho^{2}} d\phi dt
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild radius]]

:&lt;math&gt;
r_{s} = \frac{2GM}{c^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

and where the following shorthand variables have been introduced for brevity

:&lt;math&gt;
\alpha = \frac{J}{Mc}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho^{2} = r^{2} + \alpha^{2} \cos^{2} \theta\,\!
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\Lambda^{2} = r^{2} - r_{s} r + \alpha^{2}\,\!
&lt;/math&gt;

In the non-relativistic limit where ''M'' (or, equivalently, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;) goes to zero, the Kerr metric becomes the orthogonal metric for the [[oblate spheroidal coordinates]]

:&lt;math&gt;
c^{2} d\tau^{2} =
c^{2} dt^{2}
- \frac{\rho^{2}}{r^{2} + \alpha^{2}} dr^{2}
- \rho^{2} d\theta^{2}
- \left( r^{2} + \alpha^{2} \right) \sin^{2}\theta d\phi^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

We may rewrite the Kerr metric in the following form

:&lt;math&gt;
c^{2} d\tau^{2} =
\left( g_{tt} - \frac{g_{t\phi}^{2}}{g_{\phi\phi}} \right) dt^{2}
+ g_{rr} dr^{2} + g_{\theta\theta} d\theta^{2} +
g_{\phi\phi} \left( d\phi + \frac{g_{t\phi}}{g_{\phi\phi}} dt \right)^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

This metric is equivalent to a co-rotating reference frame that is rotating with angular speed Ω that depends on both the radius ''r'' and the [[colatitude]] θ

:&lt;math&gt;
\Omega = -\frac{g_{t\phi}}{g_{\phi\phi}} = \frac{r_{s} \alpha r c}{\rho^{2} \left( r^{2} + \alpha^{2} \right) + r_{s} \alpha^{2} r \sin^{2}\theta}
&lt;/math&gt;

In the plane of the equator this simplifies to:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tartaglia |first=A. |authorlink= |date=2008 |title=Detection of the gravitometric clock effect |journal= Classical and Quantum Gravity|volume= 17|issue= |pages= 783–792|id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |arxiv=gr-qc/9909006v2|bibcode = 2000CQGra..17..783T |doi = 10.1088/0264-9381/17/4/304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\Omega = \frac{r_{s} \alpha c}{r^{3} + \alpha^{2} r + r_{s} \alpha^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, an inertial reference frame is entrained by the rotating central mass to participate in the latter's rotation; this is frame-dragging.

Consequently, particles within this ergosphere must co-rotate with the inner mass, if they are to retain their time-like character.]]

An extreme version of frame dragging occurs within the [[ergosphere]] of a rotating [[black hole]]. The Kerr metric has two surfaces on which it appears to be singular. The inner surface corresponds to a spherical [[event horizon]] similar to that observed in the [[Schwarzschild metric]]; this occurs at

:&lt;math&gt;
r_\text{inner} = \frac{r_{s} + \sqrt{r_{s}^{2} - 4\alpha^{2}}}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the purely radial component ''g&lt;sub&gt;rr&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the metric goes to infinity. The outer surface can be approximated by an [[oblate spheroid]] with lower spin parameters, and resembles a pumpkin-shape&lt;ref name=visser /&gt;&lt;ref name=blundell /&gt; with higher spin parameters. It touches the inner surface at the poles of the rotation axis, where the colatitude θ equals 0 or π; its radius in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates is defined by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;
r_\text{outer} = \frac{r_{s} + \sqrt{r_{s}^{2} - 4\alpha^{2} \cos^{2}\theta}}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the purely temporal component ''g&lt;sub&gt;tt&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the metric changes sign from positive to negative. The space between these two surfaces is called the [[ergosphere]]. A moving particle experiences a positive [[proper time]] along its [[worldline]], its path through [[spacetime]]. However, this is impossible within the ergosphere, where ''g&lt;sub&gt;tt&lt;/sub&gt;'' is negative, unless the particle is co-rotating with the interior mass ''M'' with an angular speed at least of Ω. However, as seen above, frame-dragging occurs about every rotating mass and at every radius ''r'' and colatitude θ, not only within the ergosphere.

===Lense–Thirring effect inside a rotating shell===
The [[Lense–Thirring effect]] inside a rotating shell was taken by [[Albert Einstein]] as not just support for, but a vindication of [[Mach's principle]], in a letter he wrote to [[Ernst Mach]] in 1913 (five years before Lense and Thirring's work, and two years before he had attained the final form of [[general relativity]]). A reproduction of the letter can be found in [[Gravitation (book)|Misner, Thorne, Wheeler]].&lt;ref name=mtw&gt;Misner, Thorne, Wheeler, ''Gravitation'', Figure 21.5, page 544&lt;/ref&gt; The general effect scaled up to cosmological distances, is still used as a support for Mach's principle.&lt;ref name=mtw/&gt;

Inside a rotating spherical shell the acceleration due to the Lense–Thirring effect would be&lt;ref name=phister&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pfister |first=Herbert |authorlink= |date=2005 |title=On the history of the so-called Lense–Thirring effect |journal=General Relativity and Gravitation |volume=39 |issue=11 |pages=1735–1748 |doi=10.1007/s10714-007-0521-4 |url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00002681/ |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode = 2007GReGr..39.1735P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d_1 &amp;= \frac{4MG}{3Rc^2} \\
d_2 &amp;= \frac{4MG}{15Rc^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''MG'' ≪ ''Rc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or more precisely,

: &lt;math&gt;
d_1 = \frac{4 \alpha(2 - \alpha)}{(1 + \alpha)(3- \alpha)}, \qquad \alpha=\frac{MG}{2Rc^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

The spacetime inside the rotating spherical shell will not be flat. A flat spacetime inside a rotating mass shell is possible if the shell is allowed to deviate from a precisely spherical shape and the mass density inside the shell is allowed to vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pfister |first=H. |authorlink= |date=1985 |title=Induction of correct centrifugal force in a rotating mass shell |journal=Class.

'''Frequency-dependent selection''' is an evolutionary process by which the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of a [[phenotype]] depends on its frequency relative to other phenotypes in a given [[population]].

* In '''positive''' frequency-dependent selection, the fitness of a phenotype increases as it becomes more common.
* In '''negative''' frequency-dependent selection, the fitness of a phenotype decreases as it becomes more common. This is an example of [[balancing selection]].

Frequency-dependent selection is usually the result of interactions between species (predation, parasitism, or competition), or between genotypes within species (usually competitive or symbiotic), and has been especially frequently discussed with relation to [[anti-predator adaptations]]. Frequency-dependent selection can lead to [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] equilibria, which result from interactions among genotypes within species, in the same way that multi-species equilibria require interactions between species in competition (e.g. where ''α''&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; parameters in [[Lotka-Volterra]] competition equations are non-zero).

[[File:The anvil stone of a thrush - geograph.org.uk - 1751348.jpg|thumb|Anvil stone, where a thrush has broken open the shells of polymorphic [[grove snail]]s, may be a sign of frequency-dependent selection.]]

The first explicit statement of frequency-dependent selection appears to have been by [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]] in 1884, on the way that predators could maintain color polymorphisms in their prey.&lt;ref&gt;Poulton, E. B. 1884. Notes upon, or suggested by, the colours, markings and protective attitudes of certain lepidopterous larvae and pupae, and of a phytophagous hymenopterous larva. Transactions of the Entomological Society of London 1884: 27–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Allen | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Clarke | first2 = B.C. | year = 1984 | title = Frequency-dependent selection -- homage to Poulton, E.B | url = | journal = Biological Journal of the Linnean Society | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 15–18 | doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1984.tb00802.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the best known early modern statement of the principle is [[Bryan Clarke]]'s 1962 paper on [[apostatic selection]] (a synonym of negative frequency-dependent selection).&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, B. 1962. Balanced polymorphism and the diversity of sympatric species. Pp. 47-70 in D. Nichols ed. Taxonomy and Geography. Systematics Association, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke discussed predator attacks on polymorphic British snails, citing [[Luuk Tinbergen]]'s classic work on [[searching image]]s as support that predators such as birds tended to specialize in common forms of palatable species.&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen, L. 1960. The natural control of insects in pinewoods. I. Factors influencing the intensity of predation in songbirds. Archs.Neerl.Zool. 13:265-343.&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke later argued that frequency-dependent balancing selection could explain molecular polymorphisms (often in the absence of [[heterosis]]) in opposition to the [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]].

Another example is [[plant self-incompatibility]] [[allele]]s. When two plants share the same incompatibility allele, they are unable to mate. Thus, a plant with a new (and therefore, rare) allele has more success at mating, and its allele spreads quickly through the population {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}.

In human pathogens, such as the [[flu]] virus, once a particular strain has become common, most individuals have developed an immune response to that strain. But a rare, novel strain of the flu virus is able to spread quickly to almost any individual, causing continual evolution of viral strains.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) is involved in the recognition of foreign antigens and cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Takahata | first1 = N. | last2 = Nei | first2 = M. | date = 1990 | title = Allelic genealogy under overdominant and frequency-dependent selection and polymorphism of major histocompatibility complex loci | url = | journal = Genetics | volume = 124 | issue = | pages = 967–78 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequency-dependent selection may explain the high degree of polymorphism in the MHC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Borghans | first1 = JA | last2 = Beltman | first2 = JB | last3 = De Boer | first3 = RJ. |date=Feb 2004 | title = MHC polymorphism under host-pathogen coevolution. | url = | journal = Immunogenetics | volume = 55 | issue = 11| pages = 732–9 | doi=10.1007/s00251-003-0630-5 | pmid=14722687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[behavioral ecology]], negative frequency-dependent selection often maintains multiple behavioral strategies within a species. A classic example is the Hawk-Dove model of interactions among individuals in a population. In a population with two traits A and B, being one form is better when most members are the other form.  As another example, male [[common side-blotched lizard]]s have three morphs, which either defend large territories and maintain large harems of females, defend smaller territories and keep one female, or mimic females in order to sneak matings from the other two morphs. These three morphs participate in a [[rock paper scissors]] sort of interaction such that no one morph completely outcompetes the other two.&lt;ref name="S&amp;L1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sinervo |first=B. |author2=C.M.

[[File:Müllerian mimicry among Heliconius species.tiff|thumb|Müllerian mimetic species of ''Heliconius'' from South America]]

Positive frequency-dependent selection gives an advantage to common phenotypes. A good example is warning coloration in aposematic species.  Predators are more likely to remember a common color pattern that they have already encountered frequently than one that is rare. This means that new mutants or migrants that have color patterns other than the common type are eliminated from the population by differential predation.  Positive frequency-dependent selection provides the basis for Müllerian mimicry, as described by Fritz Müller &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Müller, F. |authorlink=Fritz Müller |year=1879 |title=Ituna and Thyridia; a remarkable case of mimicry in butterflies |journal=Proceedings of the Entomological Society of London |pages=20–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;, because all species involved are aposematic and share the benefit of a common, honest signal to potential predators.

Another, rather complicated example occurs in the [[Batesian mimicry]] complex between a harmless mimic, the scarlet kingsnake (''[[Lampropeltis elapsoides]]''), and the model, the eastern coral snake (''[[Micrurus fulvius]]''), in locations where the model and mimic were in deep [[sympatry]], the [[phenotype]] of the scarlet kingsnake was quite variable due to relaxed selection. But where the pattern was rare, the predator population was not 'educated', so the pattern brought no benefit. The scarlet kingsnake was much less variable on the allopatry/sympatry border of the model and mimic, most probably due to increased selection since the eastern coral snake is rare, but present, on this border. Therefore, the coloration is only advantageous once it has become common.&lt;ref name="Harper 1955–1961"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harper |first=G. R. |author2=Pfennig, D. W. |title=Mimicry on the edge: why do mimics vary in resemblance to their model in different parts of their geographical range? |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |date=22 August 2007 |volume=274 |issue=1621 |pages=1955–1961 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.0558 |pmid=17567563 |pmc=2275182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genetypes''' is a taxonomic concept proposed in 2010 to describe any [[genetic sequence|genetic sequences]] from [[type (biology)|type specimens]].&lt;ref name=Chakrabarty2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chakrabarty|first=Prosanta|title=Genetypes: a concept to help integrate molecular systematics and traditional taxonomy|journal=Zootaxa|year=2010|volume=2632|pages=67–68|url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2010/f/zt02632p068.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrisonetal2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harrison|first=I.

F. |title=Correct nomenclature and recommendations for preserving and cataloguing voucher material and genetic sequences|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|date=May 2011|volume=78|issue=5|pages=1283–1290|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.2011.02979.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2011.02979.x/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; This nomenclature integrates [[molecular systematics]] and terms used in [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological taxonomy]]. This nomenclature is designed to label, or flag, genetic sequences that were sampled from type specimens. The nomenclature of genetypes proposes that genetic sequences from a [[holotype]] should be referred to as a “hologenetype” (from: '''holo'''type and '''genetype'''), sequences from a topotype will be a “topogenetype,” and so forth. In addition, the genetic marker(s) used should also be incorporated into the nomenclature (e.g., paragenetype ND2).

The genetypes nomenclatural system could be used to flag “gold standard” sequences that due to their direct link to type specimens will be more credible than standard sequences whose species identification may be problematic. Misidentifications plague many sequences on [[GenBank]]{{cn|date=December 2013}} and having some sequences that are linked to type specimens will help locate and manage misidentifications and to create positively identified "gold standard" sequences available for comparison. It is suggested that this nomenclature be used in publications and databases that display or discuss sequences from type specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFB Instruction to Authors |url=http://www.wiley.com/bw/submit.asp?ref=0022-1112 |publisher=Journal of Fish Biology }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrisonetal2011/&gt;

The genetypes concept was superseded by the [[GenSeq]] concept, proposed in 2013 due to some confusion among researchers that genetypes were equivalent to [[name-bearing type]]s.&lt;ref name=Chakrabarty2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chakrabarty|first=Prosanta|author2=Warren, Melanie |author3=Page, Lawrence |author4= Baldwin, Carole |title=GenSeq: An updated nomenclature and ranking for genetic sequences from type and non-type sources|journal=ZooKeys|year=2013|volume=346|pages=29–41|doi=10.3897/zookeys.346.5753|pmid=24223486 |pmc=3821064}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarification needed|reason=What does "genetypes were equivalent to name-bearing types" mean?|date=February 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2240">'''Gossen's laws''', named for [[Hermann Heinrich Gossen]] (1810 – 1858), are three laws of economics:
* '''Gossen's First Law''' is the [[Law of diminishing marginal utility|"law" of diminishing marginal utility]]: that [[marginal utility|marginal utilities]] are diminishing across the ranges relevant to decision-making.
* '''[[Gossen's second law|Gossen's Second Law]]''', which presumes that [[utility]] is at least weakly quantified, is that in equilibrium an agent will allocate expenditures so that the ratio of marginal utility to price (marginal cost of acquisition) is equal across all [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]].
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U/\partial x_i}{p_i}=\frac{\partial U/\partial x_j}{p_j}\,\forall\left(i,j\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:where
:* &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is utility
:* &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is quantity of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th good or service
:* &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; is the price of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th good or service
* '''Gossen's Third Law''' is that [[scarcity]] is a precondition for economic value.

The citation referenced is the translation by Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen in which the traslator names only two laws: 1) ”If an enjoyment is experienced uninterruptedly, the corresponding intensity of pleasure decreases continuously until satiety is ultimately reached, at which point the intensity becomes nil." and, 2) "A similar decrease of the intensity of pleasure takes place if a previous enjoyment of the same kind of pleasure is repeated. Not only does the initial intensity of pleasure become smaller but also the duration of the enjoyment becomes shorter, so that satiety is reached sooner. Moreover, the sooner the repetition, the smaller becomes the initial intensity as well as the duration of the enjoyment." (p.lxxx)

== Model form ==

The general case is a [[non-linear system|non-linear model]] with a partial theoretical structure and some unknown parts derived from data. Models with unlike theoretical structures need to be evaluated individually,&lt;ref name="Bohlin06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mathworks13"&gt;Mathworks, 2013. [http://www.mathworks.com.au/help/ident/ug/supported-grey-box-models.html Supported grey box models ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hauth08"&gt;{{Citation |last=Hauth |first=J. |year=2008|title=Grey Box Modelling for Nonlinear Systems| url=https://kluedo.ub.uni-kl.de/files/2045/diss.pdf | type= dissertation, [[Kaiserslautern University of Technology]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; possibly using [[simulated annealing]] or [[genetic algorithms]].

Within a particular model structure, [[System identification|parameters]]&lt;ref name="Hauth08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nash87" &gt;Nash, J.C. and Walker-Smith, M. 1987.

Queensland Branch, Brisbane), 129-148.&lt;/ref&gt; may need to be found. For a particular structure it is arbitrarily assumed that the data consists of sets of feed vectors '''f''', product vectors '''p''', and operating condition vectors '''c'''.&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt;  Typically '''c''' will contain values extracted from '''f''', as well as other values. In many cases a model can be converted to a function of the form:&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten94"&gt;Whiten, W.J., 1994. Determination of parameter relations within non-linear models, SIGNUM Newsletter,   29(3–4,) 2–5.  10.1145/192527.192535.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten14"&gt;Whiten, B., 2014. [http://journal.austms.org.au/ojs/index.php/ANZIAMJ/article/view/7767 Determining the form of ordinary differential equations using model inversion], ANZIAM J. 55 (EMAC2013) pp.C329–C347. &lt;/ref&gt;
: '''m(f,p,q)'''
where the vector function '''m''' gives the errors between the data '''p''', and the model predictions. The vector '''q''' gives some variable parameters that are the model's unknown parts.

The parameters '''q''' vary with the operating conditions '''c''' in a manner to be determined.&lt;ref name="Whiten13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten94"/&gt; This relation can be specified as '''q''' = '''Ac''' where '''A''' is a matrix of unknown coefficients, and '''c''' as in [[linear regression]]&lt;ref name="Draper98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weisburg05"/&gt; includes a constant term and possibly transformed values of the original operating conditions to obtain non-linear relations&lt;ref name="Wikipolynomial"&gt;[[Polynomial]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wikispline"&gt;[[Spline (mathematics)]]&lt;/ref&gt; between the original operating conditions and '''q'''. It is then a matter of selecting which terms in '''A''' are non-zero and assigning their values. The model completion becomes an [[Mathematical optimization|optimisation]] problem to determine the non-zero values in '''A''' that minimizes the error terms '''m(f,p,Ac)''' over the data.&lt;ref name="Bohlin06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojovic94" &gt;Kojovic, T., and Whiten W. J., 1994. Evaluation of the quality of simulation models, Innovations in mineral processing, (Lauretian University, Sudbury) pp 437–446.  {{isbn|088667025X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojovic89"&gt;Kojovic, T., 1989.

Extensions of model building techniques and their applications in mineral processing, PhD thesis, The University of Queensland.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Model completion ==

Once a selection of non-zero values is made, the remaining coefficients in '''A''' can be determined by minimizing '''''m''(''f'',''p'',''Ac'')''' over the data with respect to the nonzero values in '''A''', typically by [[non-linear least squares]]. Selection of the nonzero terms can be done by optimization methods such as [[simulated annealing]] and [[evolutionary algorithms]]. Also the [[non-linear least squares]] can provide accuracy estimates&lt;ref name="Press07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nash87" /&gt; for the elements of '''A''' that can be used to determine if they are significantly different from zero, thus providing a method of [[Model selection|term selection]].&lt;ref name="Linhart86"&gt;{{cite book|first=H. |last=Linhart|first2=W. |last2=Zucchini|title=Model selection|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=fzDm34Z8ctUC}}|year=1986|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-83722-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller02"&gt;{{cite book|first=Alan |last=Miller|title=Subset Selection in Regression|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=V-vLBQAAQBAJ}}|date=15 April 2002|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-3593-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes possible to calculate values of '''q''' for each data set, directly or by [[non-linear least squares]]. Then the more efficient [[linear regression]] can be used to predict '''q''' using '''c'''  thus selecting the non-zero values in '''A''' and estimating their values. Once the non-zero values are located [[non-linear least squares]] can be used on the original model '''m(f,p,Ac)''' to refine these values .&lt;ref name="Whiten71"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojovic94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojovic89"/&gt;

A third method is [[model inversion]],&lt;ref name="Whiten13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten14"/&gt; which converts the non-linear '''m'''('''f''','''p''','''Ac''') into an approximate linear form in the elements of '''A''', that can be examined using efficient term selection&lt;ref name="Linhart86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller02"/&gt; and evaluation of the linear regression.&lt;ref name="Lawson96"/&gt;  For the simple case of a single '''q''' value ('''q''' = '''a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''c''') and an estimate '''q*''' of '''q'''. Putting d'''q'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''c'''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;'''q*''' gives

: '''m(f,p,a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''c) = m(f,p,q* + '''d'''q) ≈ m(f,p.q*) + '''d'''q m’(f,p,q*) = m(f,p.q*) + (a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''c − q*) m’(f,p,q*)'''

so that '''a'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is now in a linear position with all other terms known, and thus can be analyzed by [[linear regression]] techniques. For more than one parameter the method extends in a direct manner.&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiten94"/&gt; After checking that the model has been improved this process can be repeated until convergence. This approach has the advantages that it does not need the parameters '''q''' to be able to be determined from an individual data set and the linear regression is on the original error terms&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt;

== Model validation ==

Where sufficient data is available, division of the data into a separate model construction set and one or two [[Cross-validation (statistics)|evaluation sets]] is recommended. This can be repeated using multiple selections of the construction set and the [[Bootstrap aggregating|resulting models averaged]] or used to evaluate prediction differences.

A statistical test such as [[Chi-squared distribution|chi-squared]] on the residuals is not particularly useful.&lt;ref name="Deming2000"&gt;{{cite book|first=William Edwards | last = Deming|title=Out of the Crisis p272|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=LA15eDlOPgoC |page=272}}|year=2000|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-54115-2| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chi squared test requires known standard deviations which are seldom available, and failed tests give no indication of how to improve the model&lt;ref name="Press07" /&gt;

An attempt to predict the residuals '''m(, )''' with the operating conditions '''c''' using linear regression will show if the residuals can be predicted.&lt;ref name="Kojovic94" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kojovic89"/&gt; Residuals that cannot be predicted offer little prospect of improving the model using the current operating conditions.&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt; Terms that do predict the residuals are prospective terms to incorporate into the model to improve its performance.&lt;ref name="Kojovic94" /&gt;

The model inversion technique above can be used as a method of determining whether a model can be improved. In this case selection of nonzero terms is not so important and linear prediction can be done using the significant [[eigenvectors]] of the [[Design matrix|regression matrix]]. The values in '''A''' determined in this manner need to be substituted into the nonlinear model to assess improvements in the model errors. The absence of a significant improvement indicates the available data is not able to improve the current model form using the defined parameters.&lt;ref name="Whiten13" /&gt; Extra parameters can be inserted into the model to make this test more comprehensive.

'''Henry James Richter''' (1772–1857), artist and philosopher, was born in Middlesex, possibly at 40 Great Newport Street, Soho, on 8 March 1772 and baptised at [[St Anne's Church, Soho]], on 5 April at that same year.&lt;ref name="Cust"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|last=Cust |first=Lionel |authorlink=Lionel Cust |volume=48 |pages=260-261 |wstitle=Richter, Henry James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
Henry James was the second son (of five children) of John Augustus Richter and Mary Haig. John was originally from [[Dresden, Germany]] and was an artist, engraver, and [[Scagliola|scagliolist]], well known for his works in imitation of marble.&lt;ref name="Cust"&gt;{{cite ODNB|last1=Cust |first1=Lionel |last2=Wootton |first2=David |id=23599 |date=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Augustus Richter was a partner with [[Domenico Bartoli]] another scagliolist in London beginning in 1767 and continuing through the 1777 or 1778. Bartoli emigrated from the port city of Livorn, Italy (often referred to in English as Leghorn) and, after working for almost 10 years with Richter, moved on to Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://217.204.55.158/henrymoore/sculptor/browserecord.php?-action=browse&amp;-recid=141 The Henry Moore Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140608183633/http://217.204.55.158/henrymoore/sculptor/browserecord.php?-action=browse&amp;-recid=141 |date=8 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable item the elder Richter produced was a child's building blocks set called Richter's Anchor Blocks (an example of which is currently in the collection of the UK National Trust Museum of Childhood.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrustcollections.org.uk/object/660330 UK National Trust Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; Henry's older brother, John Richter (1769?–1830), was a prominent radical politician, and member of the [[London Corresponding Society]]. He was later arrested for high treason and incarcerated briefly in the [[Tower of London]]. In 1794, the Richter brothers compiled and printed [[John Milton]]'s book of poems called [[Paradise Lost]] which included 13 illustrations done by Henry James. The book was dedicated and presented to [[George IV of the United Kingdom|His Royal Highness George, Prince of Wales]] while John Richter was on trial for treason.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Joseph (2011).

He had a sister, Elizabeth Richter, who married Rev. James Stuart Freeman around July 1808.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Gentleman's Magazine (London, England)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H20dAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1039|year=1808|publisher=F. Jefferies|pages=1039–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richter was educated at Dr Barrow's school, Soho and [[St Martin's Library School]], London.&lt;ref name="Cust"/&gt; In about 1787, he began instruction under the artist [[Thomas Stothard]], with whom he remained a close friend. He also began an association with [[William Blake]].&lt;ref name="Cust"/&gt; In 1788 he produced his first illustrations (to Shakespeare's plays), and first exhibited paintings, showing two landscapes at the Royal Academy, where he exhibited for many years. He became a student of the [[Royal Academy Schools]] in 1790, and reportedly studied anatomy.

==Career==
Throughout the 1790s Richter worked mainly as an illustrator, demonstrating skills as both draftsman and engraver; projects included editions of [[Samuel Richardson]]'s ''[[Sir Charles Grandison]]'' and ''[[Clarissa Harlowe]]'' (with others, both 1793), [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[Lives of the English Poets]]'' (with others, 1797), and J.-H. Bernardin de Saint-Pierre's Paul and Virginia (1799).&lt;ref name="Cust"/&gt; In 1809 Richter began to exhibit at the Associated Artists in Water Colours, Bond Street, becoming a member in 1810, and president in 1811–12. His most popular work at this stage was the genre subject A Brute of a Husband, though he also established himself as a literary painter, with depictions of such characters as Don Quixote and Falstaff, and became one of the few notable artists to paint historical subjects in watercolour. With the dissolution of the Associated Artists in Water Colours in 1812 he was elected a member of the Society of Painters in Oil and Water Colours, though he resigned his membership in December of the same year, and until 1820 was represented on its walls only as an exhibitor. (In that year the society returned to its original form as the Society of Painters in Water Colours.)

Richter was a pioneer in painting from nature, in both practice and theory. In 1812 he painted the oil ''Christ Giving Sight to the Blind'', in bright sunlight on the roof of his house in Newman Street; the work was purchased by the trustees of the [[British Institution]] for 500 guineas and later presented to the New Church, Greenwich, completed in 1825, where it was installed as an altarpiece.&lt;ref name="Bryan1889"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Bryan|title=Dictionary of painters and engravers: biographical and critical|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V6IZAAAAYAAJ|year=1889|publisher=G. Bell and sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second version, attempting to improve on its truth to nature, was exhibited four years later. Then, in 1817, he published the pamphlet Daylight: a recent discovery in the art of painting, with hints on the philosophy of the fine arts, and on that of the human mind, as first dissected by [[Immanuel Kant]]. His more general ideas, including his approach to color and use of models of his compositions in clay or wax, influenced other painters, notably the miniature painter [[James Holmes (artist)|James Holmes]]. Daylight combined his artistic interests with his study of metaphysical philosophy. Richter also wrote the article 'Metaphysics' in the Encyclopaedia Londonensis and a paper, German Transcendentalism (1855).&lt;ref name="Cust"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Story1894"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred Thomas Story|title=James Holmes and John Varley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JR-aAAAAIAAJ|year=1894|publisher=R. Bentley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1821 Richter was again elected to the [[Royal Watercolour Society|Society of Painters in Water Colours]], though his membership and the frequency of his exhibits varied through the decade. But from 1829 until his death he was both a member and a frequent exhibitor. The subjects of his most ambitious paintings of this later phase were taken from Shakespeare. He was also known for drawings and engravings of characters of [[Sir Walter Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.is.ed.ac.uk/luna/servlet/view/all/who/Richter,+Henry+James The University of Edinburgh image collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

His work became highly popular through reproductive engravings and, from 1828, through the illustrations he produced for annuals such as the Forget-me-Not and Fisher's Drawing Room Scrapbook for 1833; The painting, ''The School in an Uproar'', was reproduced in several variations and even printed on pocket handkerchiefs. He reportedly produced as many as 150 works in the form of drawings, engravings and paintings. Some examples of his work are in the British Museum and in private collections. [[File:"The Love Letter" painting by Henry James Richter.jpg|thumb|The painting The Love Letter, currently in a private collection.]]The painting, ''The Love Letter'' was shows two characters taken from Sir Walter Scott's [[The Antiquary]] and was painted between 1816–1833. A poem of the same name was authored by [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]] who was noted for creating literary pieces based on drawings and paintings and well known during that period in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher's Drawing Room Scrapbook, London Fisher, Son and Co. 1833. Pages 58–59.[http://digital.tcl.sc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/annuals/id/9700/rec/1]&lt;/ref&gt; The painting depicts the Mrs Mailsetter in an admonishing pose and Jenny Caxon the recipient of a love letter from her older, male beau, Lieutenant Richard Taffril, who was away at sea. An engraving by Charles Rolls of the painting and the poem were published side-by-side in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrapbook for 1833 (London, UK Fisher Jackson). Rolls contributed by engraving a number of drawings and paintings done by Richter. It is believed that the painting may have been based on the drawing and subsequent engraving of a different view of the scene. This engraving has been referenced by the titles ''One Peep Was Enough'' and ''At the Post Office'' showing Mrs Mailsetter, Jenny and two other characters; Mrs Heukbane and Mrs Shortcake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://illustratingscott.lib.ed.ac.uk/itemshow/616 Illustrating Scott. The Antiquary 1832 Engraving]&lt;/ref&gt;

Richter was married twice: first, at Marylebone on 9 July 1808, to Elizabeth née Smith; and second, at Marylebone on 2 May 1818, to Charlotte Sophia née Edson (d. 1862). He had at least two sons and two daughters. On 8 April 1857, Henry James Richter died at his home at 101 Lisson Grove, London. He was 85. At the time of his death, he was translating a metaphysical work by J. S. Beck, a former student of Kant. His daughter Henrietta Sophia Richter (1813–1896) was a successful amateur portrait painter, who exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1842 to 1849. His son [[Henry Constantine Richter]] (1821–1902) became a well recognised draftsman and lithographer, noted for his illustrations of birds and mammals which were reproduced in the works of the English ornithologist and bird artist, [[John Gould]].

'''Immorality''' is the violation of [[morality|moral]] [[law]]s, [[Norm (social)|norm]]s or standards. Immorality is normally applied to people or actions, or in a broader sense, it can be applied to groups or corporate bodies, beliefs, religions, and works of art.

==Aristotle==
[[Aristotle]] saw many vices as excesses or deficits in relation to some virtue, as cowardice and rashness relate to courage. Some attitudes and actions{{snd}}such as [[envy]], [[murder]], and [[theft]]{{snd}}he saw as [[wrong]] in themselves, with no question of a deficit/excess in relation to the [[Golden mean (philosophy)|mean]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion and sexuality==
Immorality is often closely linked with both [[religion and sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Kirkpatrick ed, ''Roget's Thesaurus'' (1998) pp. 650 and 670&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Weber]] saw rational articulated religions as engaged in a long-term struggle with more physical forms of religious experience linked to dance, intoxication and sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, ''The Sociology of Religion'' (1971) p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; [[Durkheim]] pointed out how many primitive rites culminated in abandoning the distinction between licit and immoral behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Émile Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'' (1971) p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freud]]'s dour conclusion was that "In every age immorality has found no less support in religion than morality has".&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual immorality==
{{See also|Paraphilia}}

Coding of sexual behavior has historically been a feature of all human societies, as too; has been the policing of breaches of its [[mores]]{{snd}}sexual immorality{{snd}}by means of formal and [[informal social control]].&lt;ref&gt;F. Dabhoiwala, 'The first sexual revolution', ''The Oxford Historian'' X (2012) p. 426&lt;/ref&gt; Interdictions and [[taboo]]s among primitive societies&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, p. 410&lt;/ref&gt; were arguably no less severe than in traditional agrarian societies.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter, the degree of control might vary from time to time and region to region, being least in urban settlements;&lt;ref&gt;E. Ladurie, ''Montaillou'' (1980) p. 149 and p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; however, only the last three centuries of intense urbanisation, commercialisation and modernisation have broken with the restrictions of the pre-modern world,&lt;ref&gt;Dabhoiwala, p. 41–3&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of a successor society of fractured and competing sexual codes and subcultures, where sexual expression is integrated into the workings of the commercial world.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Marcuse, ''One-Dimensional Man'' (2002) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, while the meaning of sexual immorality has been drastically redefined in recent times, arguably the boundaries of what is acceptable remain publicly policed and as highly charged as ever, as the decades-long debates in the US over reproductive rights after ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', or 21st-century [[Internet Watch Foundation and Wikipedia|controversy over child images on Wikipedia]] and Amazon would tend to suggest.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lih, ''The Wikipedia Revolution'' (2010) p. 204–9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernity==
[[Michel Foucault]] considered that the modern world was unable to put forward a coherent [[morality]]&lt;ref&gt;G, Gutting ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Foucault'' (2003) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}}an inability underpinned philosophically by [[emotivism]]. Nevertheless, [[modernism]] has often been accompanied by a cult of immorality,&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Games People Play'' (1966) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; as for example when [[John Ciardi]] acclaimed [[Naked Lunch]] as "a monumentally moral descent into the hell of narcotic addiction".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. Campbell, ''This is the Beat Generation'' (1999) p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immoral psychoanalysis==
[[Psychoanalysis]] received much early criticism for being the unsavory product of an immoral town{{snd}}Vienna; psychoanalysts for being both unscrupulous and dirty-minded.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 194-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud himself however was of the opinion that "anyone who has succeeded in educating himself to truth about himself is permanently defended against the danger of immorality, even though his standard of morality may differ".&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 485-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary references==
*When questioned by a proof-reader whether his description of [[Meleager of Gadara|Meleager]] as the immoral poet should be immor''t''al poet, [[T. E. Lawrence]] replied: "Immorality I know. Immortality I cannot judge. As you please: Meleager will not sue us for libel".&lt;ref&gt;T. E. Lawrence, ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' (1936) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[De Quincey]] set out an (inverted) hierarchy of immorality in his study [[On Murder Considered as one of the Fine Arts]]: "if once a man indulges himself in murder, very soon he comes to think little of robbing; and from robbing he comes next to drinking and Sabbath-breaking, and from that to procrastination and incivility...this downward path".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas De Quincey, ''On Murder Considered as one of the Fine Arts'' (2004) p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Impartiality''' (also called '''evenhandedness''' or '''fair-mindedness''') is a principle of [[justice]] holding that decisions should be based on [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective criteria]], rather than on the basis of [[bias]], [[prejudice]], or preferring the benefit to one person over another for improper reasons.

==Legal concept==
[[European Union law]] refers in the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] to:
*A right to good administration:
:''Every person has the right to have his or her affairs handled '''impartially''', fairly and within a [[reasonable time]] by the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the [[European Union|Union]]'' (Article 41)
*A right to an effective remedy and to a [[fair trial]]:
:''Everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and '''impartial''' tribunal previously established by law'' (Article 47).&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament, Council and Commission, [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012P/TXT&amp;from=EN Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union], 26 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious concepts==

===Buddhism===
*Developing seven factors are conducive to the attainment of enlightenment: careful observation/attention/monitoring, curiosity/investigation of observed phenomena, effort/exertion/striving, anticipation/rapture, calm/tranquility, immersion/absorption, and equanimity/impartiality.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
*The "four sublime states" are benevolence, compassion, appreciation, and impartiality/equanimity, which are claimed to be prerequisite skills for rebirth in a realm of gods, called Brahma realm. (Accesstoinsight.com){{reliable source|date=March 2014}}

===Christianity===
*"For there is no respect of persons with God." —[[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 2:11, [[KJV]]
*"But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons." —[[Colossians]] 3:25, KJV
*"My dear brothers and sisters, how can you claim that you have faith in our glorious Lord [[Jesus Christ]] if you favor some people more than others? For instance, suppose someone comes into your meeting dressed in fancy clothes and expensive jewelry, and another comes in who is poor and dressed in shabby clothes. If you give special attention and a good seat to the rich person, but you say to the poor one, 'You can stand over there, or else sit on the floor'—well, doesn't this discrimination show that you are guided by wrong motives? Listen to me, dear brothers and sisters. Hasn't God chosen the poor in this world to be rich in faith? Aren't they the ones who will inherit the Kingdom he promised to those who love him? And yet, you insult the poor man! Isn't it the rich who oppress you and drag you into court? Aren't they the ones who slander Jesus Christ, whose noble name you bear? Yes indeed, it is good when you truly obey our Lord's royal command found in the scriptures: '[[Love thy neighbor as thyself|Love your neighbor as yourself]]'. But if you pay special attention to the rich, you are committing a sin, for you are guilty of breaking that law." —[[Epistle of James]] 2:1-9, NLT
*"But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere." -[[Epistle of James]] 3:17, [[NIV]]

===Hinduism===
*"Truth, O [[Bhārat Gaṇarājya|Bharata]], as it exists in all the world, is of thirteen kinds. The forms that Truth assumes are impartiality, self-control, forgiveness, modesty, endurance, goodness, renunciation, contemplation, dignity, fortitude, compassion, and abstention from injury."—Truth, The Mahabharata, Santi Parva, Section CLXII.

===Islam===
* "O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm in justice, witnesses for Allah, even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives. Whether one is rich or poor, Allah is more worthy of both. So follow not [personal] inclination, lest you not be just. And if you distort [your testimony] or refuse [to give it], then indeed Allah is ever, with what you do, Acquainted." Quran 4:135.
* "O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm for Allah, witnesses in justice, and do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being just. Be just; that is nearer to righteousness. And fear Allah ; indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what you do." Quran 5:8.

===Judaism===

*"You shall do no injustice in court. You shall not be partial to the poor or defer to the great, but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor." —[[Leviticus]] 19:15, [[English Standard Version]]
*"You shall not be partial in judgment. You shall hear the small and the great alike." —[[Deuteronomy]] 1:17, ESV
*"These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment." —[[Book of Proverbs]] 24:23, KJV

[[File:PARAMOUNT Eli Lilly Informed Consent Document.djvu|thumbnail|right|Example of informed consent document from the [[PARAMOUNT trial]]]]
'''Informed consent''' is a process for getting permission before conducting a healthcare intervention on a person, or for disclosing personal information. A [[health care provider]] may ask a patient to [[consent]] to receive [[therapy]] before providing it, or a [[clinical research]]er may ask a [[research participant]] before enrolling that person into a [[clinical trial]]. Informed consent is collected according to guidelines from the fields of [[medical ethics]] and [[research ethics]].

An informed consent can be said to have been given based upon a clear appreciation and understanding of the facts, implications, and consequences of an action. Adequate informed consent is rooted in respecting a person’s dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elsayyad|first=Ahmed|title=Informed Consent for Comparative Effectiveness Trials|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1403310|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=370|doi=10.1056/NEJMc1403310|pages=1958–1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; To give informed consent, the individual concerned must have adequate reasoning faculties and be in possession of all relevant facts. Impairments to reasoning and judgment that may prevent informed consent include basic intellectual or emotional immaturity, high levels of stress such as [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) or a severe [[intellectual disability]], severe [[mental disorder]], [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]], severe [[sleep deprivation]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], or being in a [[coma]].

Obtaining informed consent is [[#Waiver of requirement|not always required]]. If an individual is considered unable to give informed consent, another person is generally authorized to give consent on his behalf, e.g., parents or [[legal guardian]]s of a child (though in this circumstance the child may be required to provide [[informed assent]]) and conservators for the [[mentally disordered]], or consent can be assumed through the doctrine of [[implied consent]], e.g., when an unconscious person will die without immediate medical treatment.

In cases where an individual is provided insufficient information to form a reasoned decision, serious ethical issues arise. Such cases in a [[clinical trial]] in [[medical research]] are anticipated and prevented by an [[ethics committee]] or [[Institutional Review Board]].

Informed Consent Form Templates can be found on the World Health Organization Website for practical use.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/rpc/research_ethics/informed_consent/en/index.html|title=WHO &amp;#124; Informed Consent Form Templates|publisher=who.int|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==

Informed consent can be complex to evaluate, because neither expressions of consent, nor expressions of understanding of implications, necessarily mean that full adult consent was in fact given, nor that full comprehension of relevant issues is internally digested. Consent may be implied within the usual subtleties of human communication, rather than explicitly negotiated verbally or in writing. In some cases consent cannot legally be possible, even if the person protests he does indeed understand and wish. There are also structured instruments for evaluating capacity to give informed consent, although no ideal instrument presently exists.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Thus, there is always a degree to which informed consent must be assumed or inferred based upon observation, or knowledge, or legal reliance. This especially is the case in sexual or relational issues. In medical or formal circumstances, explicit agreement by means of signature—normally relied on legally—regardless of actual consent, is the norm. This is the case with certain procedures, such as a "[[do not resuscitate]]" directive that a patient signed before onset of their illness.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} 

Brief examples of each of the above:
# A person may verbally agree to something from fear, perceived social pressure, or psychological difficulty in asserting true feelings. The person requesting the action may honestly be unaware of this and believe the consent is genuine, and rely on it. ''Consent is expressed, but not internally given.''
# A person may claim to understand the implications of some action, as part of consent, but in fact has failed to appreciate the possible consequences fully and may later deny the validity of the consent for this reason. ''Understanding needed for informed consent is present but is, in fact (through ignorance), not present.''
# A person signs a [[legal release]] form for a [[medical procedure]], and later feels he did not really consent. Unless he can show actual misinformation, the release is usually persuasive or conclusive in law, in that the clinician may rely legally upon it for consent. ''In formal circumstances, a written consent usually legally overrides later denial of informed consent (unless obtained by misrepresentation)''.
# Informed consent in the U.S. can be overridden in emergency medical situations pursuant to [[21CFR50.24]], which was first brought to the general public's attention via the controversy surrounding the study of [[Polyheme]].

==Valid elements==

For an individual to give valid informed consent, three components must be present: disclosure, capacity and voluntariness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faden |first=R. R. |last2=Beauchamp |first2=T. L. |title=A History and Theory of Informed Consent |year=1986 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-503686-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beauchamp |first=Tom L. |last2=Childress |first2=James F. |title=Principles of Biomedical Ethics |year=1994 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |edition=Fourth |isbn=0-19-508536-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Disclosure'' requires the researcher to supply each prospective subject with the information necessary to make an autonomous decision and also to ensure that the subject adequate understands the information provided. This latter requirement implies that a written consent form be written in lay language suited for the comprehension skills of subject population, as well as assessing the level of understanding through conversation.
* ''Capacity'' pertains to the ability of the subject to both understand the information provided and form a reasonable judgment based on the potential consequences of his/her decision.
* ''Voluntariness'' refers to the subject’s right to freely exercise his/her decision making without being subjected to external pressure such as coercion, manipulation, or undue influence.

==Waiver of requirement==

Waiver of the consent requirement may be applied in certain circumstances where no foreseeable harm is expected to result from the study or when permitted by law, federal regulations, or if an ethical review committee has approved the non-disclosure of certain information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Council for International Organization of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) and World Health Organization (WHO) Geneva, Switzerland, 2002 |title=International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects |url=http://www.cioms.ch/publications/layout_guide2002.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823205120/http://www.cioms.ch/publications/layout_guide2002.pdf |archivedate=2010-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides studies with minimal risk, waivers of consent may be obtained in a military setting. According to 10 USC 980, the United States Code for the Armed Forces, Limitations on the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects, a waiver of advanced informed consent may be granted by the Secretary of Defense if a research project would:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McManus, J.|author2=S.

# Directly benefit subjects.

These practices are part of what constitutes informed consent, and their history is the history of informed consent.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|60}}  They combine to form the modern concept of informed consent—which rose in response to particular incidents in modern research.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|60}}  Whereas various cultures in various places practiced informed consent, the modern concept of informed consent was developed by people who drew influence from [[Western culture|Western tradition]].&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|60}}

===Medical history===
Historians cite a series of medical guidelines to trace the history of informed consent in medical practice.

[[The Hippocratic Oath]], a 500&amp;nbsp;BC Greek text, was the first set of Western writings giving guidelines for the conduct of medical professionals. It advises that physicians conceal most information from patients to give the patients the best care.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|61}}  The rationale is a [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]] model for care—the doctor knows better than the patient, and therefore should direct the patient's care, because the patient is not likely to have better ideas than the doctor.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|61}}

[[Henri de Mondeville]], a French surgeon who in the 14th century, wrote about medical practice. He traced his ideas to the Hippocratic Oath.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|63}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burns|first=Chester R.|title=Legacies in ethics and medicine|year=1977|publisher=Science History Publications|location=New York|isbn=9780882021669}} In this book see Mary Catherine Welborn's excerpts from her 1966 ''The long tradition: A study in fourteenth-century medical deontology''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Jay|title=The silent world of doctor and patient|year=2002|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0801857805|pages=7–9|edition=Johns Hopkins Paperbacks|author2=Alexander Morgan Capron}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his recommendations were that doctors "promise a cure to every patient" in hopes that the good prognosis would inspire a good outcome to treatment.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|63}} Mondeville never mentioned getting consent, but did emphasize the need for the patient to have confidence in the doctor.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|63}} He also advised that when deciding therapeutically unimportant details the doctor should meet the patients' requests "so far as they do not interfere with treatment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burns|first=Chester R.|title=Legacies in ethics and medicine|year=1977|publisher=Science History Publications|location=New York|isbn=9780882021669}} In this book see De Mondeville's "On the morals and ethics of medicine" from ''Ethics in Medicine''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Rush]] was an 18th-century United States physician who was influenced by the [[Age of Enlightenment]] cultural movement.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|65}} Because of this, he advised that doctors ought to share as much information as possible with patients. He recommended that doctors educate the public and respect a patient's informed decision to accept therapy.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|65}} There is no evidence that he supported seeking a consent from patients.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|65}} In a lecture titled "On the duties of patients to their physicians", he stated that patients should be strictly obedient to the physician's orders; this was representative of much of his writings.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|65}} John Gregory, Rush's teacher, wrote similar views that a doctor could best practice beneficence by making decisions for the patients without their consent.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|66}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gregory|first=John|title=Lectures on the Duties and Qualifications of a Physician|year=1772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Percival]] was a British physician who published a book called ''Medical Ethics'' in 1803.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|68}} Percival was a student of the works of Gregory and various earlier Hippocratic physicians.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|68}} Like all previous works, Percival's ''Medical Ethics'' makes no mention of soliciting for the consent of patients or respecting their decisions.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|68}} Percival said that patients have a right to truth, but when the physician could provide better treatment by lying or withholding information, he advised that the physician do as he thought best.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|68}}

When the [[American Medical Association]] was founded they in 1847 produced a work called the first edition of the ''American Medical Association Code of Medical Ethics''.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|69}} Many sections of this book are verbatim copies of passages from Percival's ''Medical Ethics''.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|69}} A new concept in this book was the idea that physicians should fully disclose all patient details truthfully when talking to other physicians, but the text does not also apply this idea to disclosing information to patients.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|70}} Through this text, Percival's ideas became pervasive guidelines throughout the United States as other texts were derived from them.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|70}}

[[Worthington Hooker]] was an American physician who in 1849 published ''Physician and Patient''.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|70}} This medical ethics book was radical demonstrating understanding of the AMA's guidelines and Percival's philosophy and soundly rejecting all directives that a doctor should lie to patients.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|70}} In Hooker's view, benevolent deception is not fair to the patient, and he lectured widely on this topic.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|70}} Hooker's ideas were not broadly influential.&lt;ref name="historytheory"/&gt;{{rp|70}}

===Research history===
Historians cite a series of [[human subject research]] experiments to trace the history of informed consent in research.

The U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission “is considered the first research group in history to use consent forms.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cutter|first=Laura|title=Walter Reed, Yellow Fever, and Informed Consent|url=http://militarymedicine.amsus.org/doi/pdf/10.7205/MILMED-D-15-00430|journal=Military Medicine|volume=181|issue=1|pages=90–91|doi=10.7205/milmed-d-15-00430}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, Major [[Walter Reed]] was appointed head of the four man U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission in [[Cuba]] that determined [[Mosquito|mosquitoes]] were the vector for [[yellow fever]] transmission. His earliest experiments were probably done without formal documentation of informed consent. In later experiments he obtained support from appropriate military and administrative authorities. He then drafted what is now “one of the oldest series of extant informed consent documents.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/yellowfever/yellow-fever-commission-work/|title=The U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission in Cuba - U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission|last=|first=|date=|work=U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission|access-date=2017-08-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three surviving examples are in Spanish with English translations; two have an individual’s signature and one is marked with an X.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/yellowfever/yellow-fever-commission-work/|title=The U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission in Cuba - U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission|work=U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission|access-date=2017-08-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Tearoom Trade]]'' is the name of a book by American psychologist [[Laud Humphreys]]. In it he describes his research into male [[homosexual]] acts.&lt;ref name="babbie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Babbie|first=Earl|title=The practice of social research|year=2010|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage|location=Belmont, Calif|isbn=0495598410|edition=12th}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conducting this research he never sought consent from his research subjects and other researchers raised concerns that he violated the right to [[privacy for research participants]].&lt;ref name="babbie"/&gt;

The [[Milgram experiment]] is the name of a 1961 experiment conducted by American psychologist [[Stanley Milgram]]. In the experiment Milgram had an authority figure order research participants to commit a disturbing act of harming another person.&lt;ref name="baumrind"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Baumrind | first1 = D. | title = Some thoughts on ethics of research: After reading Milgram's "Behavioral Study of Obedience." | doi = 10.1037/h0040128 | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 421–423 | year = 1964 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the experiment he would reveal that he had deceived the participants and that they had not hurt anyone, but the research participants were upset at the experience of having participated in the research.&lt;ref name="baumrind"/&gt; The experiment raised broad discussion on the ethics of recruiting participants for research without giving them full information about the nature of the research.&lt;ref name="baumrind"/&gt;

[[Chester M. Southam]] used HeLa cells to inject into cancer patients and [[Ohio State Penitentiary]] inmates without informed consent to determine if people could become immune to cancer and if cancer could be transmitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skloot|first1=Rebecca|title=The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks|date=2010|publisher=Braodway Paperbacks|location=New York|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical procedures==
The doctrine of informed consent relates to [[professional negligence]] and establishes a breach of the duty of care owed to the patient (see [[duty of care in English law|duty of care]], [[breach of duty in English law|breach of the duty]], and [[respect for persons]]). The doctrine of informed consent also has significant implications for medical trials of medications, devices, or procedures.

===Requirements of the professional===
Until 2015 in the [[United Kingdom]] and in countries such as [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], informed consent in medical procedures requires proof as to the standard of care to expect as a recognised standard of acceptable professional practice (the [[Bolam Test]]), that is, what risks would a medical professional usually disclose in the circumstances (see [[Loss of right in English law]]). Arguably, this is "sufficient consent" rather than "informed consent." The UK has since departed from the Bolam test for judging standards of informed consent, due to the landmark ruling in ''[[Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board]]''. This moves away from the concept of a reasonable physician and instead uses the standard of a [[Reasonable person|reasonable patient]], and what risks an individual would attach significance to.

Medicine in the United States, Australia, and Canada also takes this patient-centric approach to "informed consent." Informed consent in these jurisdictions requires healthcare providers to disclose significant risks, as well as risks of particular importance to that patient. This approach combines an objective (a hypothetical reasonable patient) and subjective (this particular patient) approach.

The doctrine of informed consent should be contrasted with the general doctrine of medical consent, which applies to [[assault (tort)|assault]] or [[battery (tort)|battery]]. The consent standard here is only that the person understands, in general terms, the nature of and purpose of the intended intervention. As the higher standard of informed consent applies to negligence, not battery, the other elements of negligence must be made out. Significantly, causation must be shown: That had the individual been made aware of the risk he would not have proceeded with the operation (or perhaps with that surgeon).

Optimal establishment of an informed consent requires adaptation to cultural or other individual factors of the patient. For example, people from Mediterranean and Arab appear to rely more on the context of the delivery of the information, with the information being carried more by who is saying it and where, when, and how it's being said, rather than ''what'' is said, which is of relatively more importance in typical "Western" countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/746187?src=mp&amp;spon=25 Too Much Information: Informed Consent in Cultural Context]. By Joseph J. Fins and Pablo Rodriguez del Pozo. Medscape 07/18/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The informed consent doctrine is generally implemented through good healthcare practice: pre-operation discussions with patients and the use of medical consent forms in hospitals. However, reliance on a signed form should not undermine the basis of the doctrine in giving the patient an opportunity to weigh and respond to the risk. In one British case, a doctor performing routine surgery on a woman noticed that she had cancerous tissue in her womb. He took the initiative to remove the woman's womb; however, as she had not given informed consent for this operation, the doctor was judged by the [[General Medical Council]] to have acted negligently. The council stated that the woman should have been informed of her condition, and allowed to make her own decision.

===Obtaining informed consents===

To capture and manage informed consents, hospital management systems typically use paper-based consent forms which are scanned and stored in a document handling system after obtaining the necessary signatures. Hospital systems and research organizations are adopting an electronic way of capturing informed consents to enable indexing, to improve comprehension, search and retrieval of consent data, thus enhancing the ability to honor to patient intent and identify willing research participants.&lt;ref name="healthsciencessc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthsciencessc.org/IT.asp|title=Health Sciences South Carolina|publisher=healthsciencessc.org|accessdate=14 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011200835/http://healthsciencessc.org/IT.asp|archivedate=11 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chalil Madathil | first1 = K. | last2 = Koikkara | first2 = R. | last3 = Gramopadhye | first3 = A.

===Competency of the patient===

The ability to give informed consent is governed by a general requirement of competency. In common law jurisdictions, adults are presumed competent to consent. This presumption can be rebutted, for instance, in circumstances of mental illness or other incompetence. This may be prescribed in legislation or based on a common-law standard of inability to understand the nature of the procedure. In cases of incompetent adults, a [[health care proxy]] makes medical decisions. In the absence of a proxy, the medical practitioner is expected to act in the patient's best interests until a proxy can be found.

By contrast, '[[Minor (law)|minors]]' (which may be defined differently in different jurisdictions) are generally presumed incompetent to consent, but depending on their age and other factors may be required to provide [[Informed assent]]. In some jurisdictions (e.g. much of the U.S.), this is a strict standard. In other jurisdictions (e.g. England, Australia, Canada), this presumption may be rebutted through proof that the minor is ‘mature’ (the ‘[[Gillick competence|Gillick standard]]’). In cases of incompetent minors, informed consent is usually required from the parent (rather than the 'best interests standard') although a [[parens patriae]] order may apply, allowing the court to dispense with parental consent in cases of refusal.

===Deception===

Research involving deception is controversial given the requirement for informed consent. Deception typically arises in social psychology, when researching a particular psychological process requires that investigators deceive subjects. For example, in the [[Milgram experiment]], researchers wanted to determine the willingness of participants to obey authority figures despite their personal conscientious objections. They had authority figures demand that participants deliver what they thought was an electric shock to another research participant. For the study to succeed, it was necessary to deceive the participants so they believed that the subject was a peer and that their electric shocks caused the peer actual pain.

Nonetheless, research involving deception prevents subjects from exercising their basic right of autonomous informed decision-making and conflicts with the ethical principle of [[respect for persons]].

The [[Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct]] set by the [[American Psychological Association]] says that psychologists may conduct research that includes a deceptive compartment only if they can both justify the act by the value and importance of the study's results and show they could not obtain the results by some other way. Moreover, the research should bear no potential harm to the subject as an outcome of deception, either physical pain or [[emotional distress]]. Finally, the code requires a debriefing session in which the experimenter both tells the subject about the deception and gives subject the option of withdrawing the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=2. American Psychological Association. (2002)|title=2010 Amendments to the American Psychological Association ethical principles of psychologists and code of conduct.|url=http://www.apa.org/ethics/code/index.aspx|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abortion===

In some U.S. states, informed consent laws (sometimes called "right to know" laws) require that a woman seeking an elective [[abortion]] receive information from the abortion provider about her legal rights, alternatives to abortion (such as [[adoption]]), available public and private assistance, and other information specified in the law, before the abortion is performed. Other countries with such laws (e.g. [[Germany]]) require that the information giver be properly certified to make sure that no abortion is carried out for the financial gain of the abortion provider and to ensure that the decision to have an abortion is not swayed by any form of incentive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Taupitz |first1=Jochen |last2=Weschka |first2=Marion |date=2009 |title=CHIMBRIDS - Chimeras and Hybrids in Comparative European and International Research: Scientific, Ethical, Philosophical and Legal Aspects.

Some informed consent laws have been criticized for allegedly using "loaded language in an apparently deliberate attempt to 'personify' the fetus,"&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Rachel and Nash, Elizabeth.[http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/10/4/gpr100406.html State Abortion Counseling Policies and the Fundamental Principles of Informed Consent], Guttmacher Policy Review, Fall 2007, Volume 10, Number 4.&lt;/ref&gt; but those critics acknowledge that "most of the information in the [legally mandated] materials about abortion comports with recent scientific findings and the principles of informed consent", although "some content is either misleading or altogether incorrect."&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Chinue and Nash, Elizabeth. [http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/09/4/gpr090406.html "Misinformed Consent: The Medical Accuracy of State-Developed Abortion Counseling Materials"], Guttmacher Policy Review
Fall 2006, Volume 9, Number 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children==

As children often lack the decision making ability or legal power (competence) to provide true informed consent for medical decisions, it often falls on parents or legal guardians to provide ''informed permission'' for medical decisions. This "consent by proxy" usually works reasonably well, but can lead to ethical dilemmas when the judgment of the parents or guardians and the medical professional differ with regard to what constitutes appropriate decisions "in the best interest of the child". Children who are [[Emancipation of minors|legally emancipated]], and certain situations such as decisions regarding sexually transmitted diseases or pregnancy, or for unemancipated minors who are deemed to have medical decision making capacity, may be able to provide consent without the need for parental permission depending on the laws of the jurisdiction the child lives in. The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] encourages medical professionals also to seek the assent of older children and adolescents by providing age appropriate information to these children to help empower them in the decision making process.&lt;ref name="AAP"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Committee on Bioethics  | year = 1995 | title = Informed consent, parental permission, and assent in pediatric practice | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/95/2/314.full.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 95 | issue = 2| pages = 314–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on children has benefited society in many ways. The only effective way to establish normal patterns of growth and metabolism is to do research on infants and young children. When addressing the issue of informed consent with children, the primary response is parental consent. This is valid, although only legal guardians are able to consent for a child, not adult siblings.&lt;ref name="Annas, Glantz, Katz 1977 63–93"&gt;{{cite book|last=Annas, Glantz, Katz|first=George, Leonard, Barbara|title=Informed Consent to Human Experimentation|year=1977|publisher=Ballinger Publishing Company|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-88410-147-9|pages=63–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, parents may not order the termination of a treatment that is required to keep a child alive, even if they feel it is in the best interest.&lt;ref name="Annas, Glantz, Katz 1977 63–93"/&gt;  Guardians are typically involved in the consent of children, however a number of doctrines have developed that allow children to receive health treatments without parental consent. For example, emancipated minors may consent to medical treatment, and minors can also consent in an emergency.&lt;ref name="Annas, Glantz, Katz 1977 63–93"/&gt;

==Research==
Informed consent is part of the ethical [[clinical research]] as well, in which a human subject voluntarily confirms his or her willingness to participate in a particular [[clinical trial]], after having been informed of all aspects of the trial that are relevant to the subject's decision to participate. Informed consent is documented by means of a written, signed, and dated informed consent form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Efficacy/E6/E6_R1_Guideline.pdf |title=Guideline For Good Clinical Practice |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[medical research]], the [[Nuremberg Code]] set a base international standard in 1947, which continued to develop, for example in response to the ethical violation in the [[Holocaust]]. Nowadays, medical research is overseen by an [[ethics committee]] that also oversees the informed consent process.

As the medical guidelines established in the Nuremberg Code were imported into the ethical guidelines for the [[social science]]s, informed consent became a common part of the research procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Homan |first=R. |year=1991 |title=The Ethics of Social Research |location=London; New York |publisher=Longman |isbn=0-582-05879-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while informed consent is the default in medical settings, it is not always required in the social science. Here, research often involves low or no risk for participants, unlike in many medical experiments. Second, the mere knowledge that they participate in a study can cause people to alter their behavior, as in the [[Hawthorne Effect]]: "In the typical lab experiment, subjects enter an environment in which they are keenly aware that their behavior is being monitored, recorded, and subsequently scrutinized."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levitt |first=S. D. |last2=List |first2=J. A. |year=2007 |title=What Do Laboratory Experiments Measuring Social Preferences Reveal about the Real World? |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=153–174 |doi= 10.1257/jep.21.2.153|jstor=30033722 |url=https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.21.2.153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|168}}
In such cases, seeking informed consent directly interferes with the ability to conduct the research, because the very act of revealing that a study is being conducted is likely to alter the behavior studied. List exemplifies the potential dilemma that can result: "if one were interested in exploring whether, and to what extent, race or gender influences the prices that buyers pay for used cars, it would be difficult to measure accurately the degree of discrimination among used car dealers who know that they are taking part in an experiment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=List |first=J. A. |year=2008 |title=Informed Consent in Social Science |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=322 |issue=5902 |page=672 |doi=10.1126/science.322.5902.672a |last2=List |first2=J. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases where such interference is likely, and after careful consideration, a researcher may forgo the informed consent process. This is commonly done after weighting the risk to study participants versus the benefit to society and whether participants are present in the study out of their own wish and treated fairly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levitt |first=S. D. |last2=List |first2=J. A. |year=2009 |title=Field experiments in economics: The past, the present, and the future |journal=[[European Economic Review]] |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2008.12.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers often consult with an ethics committee or institutional review board to render a decision.

The birth of new online media, such as social media, has complicated the idea of informed consent. In an online environment people pay little attention to Terms of Use agreements and can subject themselves to research without thorough knowledge. This issue came to the public light following a study conducted by [[Facebook|Facebook Inc.]] in 2014, and published by that company and [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kramer|first1=Adam|last2=Guillory|first2=Jaime|last3=Jeffrey|first3=Hancock|title=Experimental evidence of massive-scale emotional contagion through social networks|journal=PNAS|date=2014|volume=111|doi=10.1073/pnas.1320040111|pmid=24889601|pages=8788–90|pmc=4066473}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook conducted a study where they altered the Facebook News Feeds of roughly 700,000 users to reduce either the amount of positive or negative posts they saw for a week. The study then analyzed if the users status updates changed during the different conditions. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The lack of informed consent led to outrage among many researchers and users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=LANIER|first1=Jaron|title=Should Facebook Manipulate Users?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/opinion/jaron-lanier-on-lack-of-transparency-in-facebook-study.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many believed that by potentially altering the mood of users by altering what posts they see, Facebook put at-risk individuals at higher dangers for depression and suicide. However, supports of Facebook claim that Facebook details that they have the right to use information for research in their terms of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boyd|first1=Danah|title=What does the Facebook experiment teach us?|url=http://socialmediacollective.org/2014/07/01/facebook-experiment/|website=Social Media Collective Research Blog|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others say the experiment is just a part of Facebook’s current work, which alters News Feeds algorithms continually to keep people interested and coming back to the site. Others pointed out that this specific study is not along but that news organizations constantly try out different headlines using algorithms to elicit emotions and garner clicks or Facebook shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watts|first1=Duncan|title=Stop complaining about the Facebook study. It's a golden age for research|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/07/facebook-study-science-experiment-research|website=The Guardian|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They say this Facebook study is no different than things people already accept. Still, others say that Facebook broke the law when conducting the experiment on user that didn’t give informed consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grimmelmann|first1=James|title=Illegal, Immoral, and Mood-Altering How Facebook and OkCupid Broke the Law When They Experimented on Users|url=https://medium.com/@JamesGrimmelmann/illegal-unethical-and-mood-altering-8b93af772688|website=Medium|accessdate=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Facebook study controversy raises numerous questions about informed consent and the differences in the ethical review process between publicly and privately funded research. Some say Facebook was within its limits and others see the need for more informed consent and/or the establishment of in-house private review boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink1=Matthew J.

==Conflicts of interest==
Other, long-standing controversies underscore the role for [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] among medical school faculty and researchers. For example, coverage of University of California (UC) medical school faculty members has included news of ongoing corporate payments to researchers and practitioners from companies that market and produce the very devices and treatments they recommend to patients.&lt;ref name="Petersen2014"&gt;Petersen, Melody.

The '''international date line&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In this article, the convention used is to capitalize "Date Line" (or "International Date Line") when it refers to the ''standard'' [[International Date Line]], but to use small letters to refer to possible construct(s) under Jewish law.&lt;/ref&gt;  in Judaism''' is used to demarcate the change of one calendar day to the next in the [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish calendar]]. The Jewish calendar defines days as running from sundown to sundown rather than midnight to midnight. So in the context of Judaism, an international date line demarcates when the line of sundown moving across the Earth's surface stops being the sundown ending and starting one day and starts being the sundown ending and starting the following day.

However, the conventional [[International Date Line]] is a relatively recent geographic and political construct whose exact location has moved from time to time depending on the needs of different interested parties. While it is well-understood why the conventional date line is located in the Pacific Ocean, there are not really objective criteria for its exact placement within the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[International Date Line|main article]] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; In that light, it cannot be taken for granted that the conventional International Date Line can (or should) be used as a date line under Jewish law. In practice, within Judaism the ''[[Jewish law|halakhic]]'' date line is similar to, but not necessarily identical with, the conventional Date Line, and the differences can have consequences under religious law.

==Location of the date line==

===Theoretical basis for the discussion===
Many of the opinions about the ''halakhic'' date line are structured as a response to the question of what days someone should observe as [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holidays]]. Shabbat occurs every seven days at any location on earth. It is normally thought to occur on Saturday—or more precisely, from Friday at sundown to Saturday at nightfall. But if the ''halakhic'' date line is not identical to the conventional Date Line, it is possible that what is Saturday with respect to the conventional Date Line is not Saturday with respect to the ''halakhic'' date line, at least in some places.

There are several opinions regarding where exactly the ''halakhic'' date line should be according to Jewish law, and at least one opinion that says that no ''halakhic'' date line really exists.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;&lt;ref name="taarich"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Taplin |first1=Rabbi Yisroel |authorlink1=Yisroel Taplin |title=Sefer Taarich Yisroel |date=1998–1999 |location=Lakewood, NJ |url=http://www.datelineinhalacha.com/dateline_in_halacha.html |language=Hebrew|postscript=,}} which is summarized in English at {{cite web |title=Kitzur Taarich Yisroel: The Dateline in Halacha |url=http://www.datelineinhalacha.com/dateline_in_halacha.html |website=www.datelineinhalacha |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=map&gt;[http://www.star-k.org/articles/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IDL_Map.pdf The International Dateline in Halacha (Star-K)(map)], 170 kB&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|90}}'''1. ''90 degrees east of Jerusalem.''''' The concept of a ''halakhic'' date line is mentioned in the ''[[Baal HaMeor]],'' a 12th-century Talmudic commentary,&lt;ref name=kashrus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/493/a-travelers-guide-to-the-international-dateline/ |last=Heber|first=Rabbi Dovid|title=A Traveller's Guide To The International Dateline |publisher=Star-k.org |accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabbeinu Zecharya Halevi, ''Baal Hameor'', Tractate Rosh Hashana, 20b&lt;/ref&gt; which seems to indicate that the day changes in an area where the time is six hours ahead of [[Jerusalem]] (90 degrees east of Jerusalem, about 125.2°E, a line now known to run through [[Australia]], the [[Philippines]], [[China]] and [[Russia]]). This line, which he refers to as the ''K'tzai Hamizrach'' (the easternmost line), is used to calculate the day of [[Rosh Hashanah]], the Jewish New Year. According to some sources it is alluded to in both the [[Babylonian Talmud]] ([[Rosh Hashanah (tractate)|Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Eruvin (Talmud)|Eruvin]]) and in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]].  The ''[[Kuzari]]'' of [[Yehuda Halevi]], also a 12th-century work, seems to agree with this ruling.

Later decisors like the ''[[Chazon Ish]]'' (twentieth century) fundamentally agree with this ruling. However, they recognize practical issues associated with the pure use of a line of longitude for this purpose. As an example, 125.2°E passes directly through Dongfeng Street in [[Changchun]], China.&lt;ref&gt;To be precise, at a point 1.11 km east of Xihu Rd. See [https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=43.84%2C125.2#map=12/43.8400/125.1999 location on OpenStreetMaps.]&lt;/ref&gt; If this line of longitude were used strictly, people could simply avoid Shabbat altogether by crossing the street. To prevent that, the Chazon Ish rules{{refn|Cited in Taplin&lt;ref name="taarich /&gt; at footnote 16 of the web page.}}&lt;ref name="RJJ"&gt;This is rejected by the [[Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik|Brisker Rav]] (see {{cite journal|last1=Pahmer|first1=David|title=The International Date Line and Related Issues|journal=RJJ Journal of Halacha and Contemporary Society|date=1990|volume=XXI|pages=60–83|url=http://download2.yutorah.org/1991/1053/735807.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2016|postscript=}} at page 69), who rules that the use of this meridian is absolute.&lt;/ref&gt; that the contiguous land masses to the east of that line of longitude are considered secondary (''tafel'') to the land masses west of that line. As a result, he rules that the date line runs along 125.2°E when over water, but curves around the eastern coast of mainland Asia and Australia. By this view, Russia, China and Australia are west of the date line and observe Shabbat on local Saturday. [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Tasmania]] are east of the date line and should observe Shabbat on local Sunday, as defined by the conventional International Date Line. By this view, the Philippines and [[Indonesia]] would have portions west of the line and portions east of the line.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;

'''2. ''180 degrees east of Jerusalem.''''' Rabbi [[Yechiel Michel Tucazinsky]] ruled that the International Date Line is 180 degrees east of Jerusalem.  That would mean that the date line, rather than being near 180°, would be at 144.8°W.  By this view, places east of the conventional International Date Line but west of 144.8°W—[[Alaska]], [[Hawaii]] and a variety of archipelagos in the Pacific—would observe Shabbat on the local Friday instead of the local Saturday.

It is possible (but not certain) under this view to apply the principal of ''tafel'' described above as well. In that event, mainland Alaska would be east of the date line, but the [[Aleutian Islands]] would be west of the date line.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;

'''3. ''Mid-Pacific.''''' A variety of decisors{{refn|''Inter alia,'' Rabbis David Shapira, B. Rabinowitz Thumim, the ''Atzei Sodeh,'' and the ''Alai Yonah.'' These decisors do not necessarily rule identically to each other.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;&lt;ref name=chabad&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shurpin|first1=Rabbi Yehuda|title=The Sabbath, the International Date Line and Jewish Law|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1736567/jewish/|website=Chabad.org|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} rule that the date line runs in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, close to (but not necessarily the same as) the conventional International Date Line. According to this point of view, all of the major populated areas of the Pacific (such as New Zealand, Japan, Alaska and Hawaii) observe Shabbat on local Saturday (that is, consistent with the conventional International Date Line). Only certain Pacific islands, generally having few or no permanent Jewish residents, might not observe Shabbat on local Saturday.&lt;ref name=map/&gt;

'''4. ''Following local custom/There is no fixed date line.''''' According to Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Kasher]], there is no clear tradition or Talmudic source dictating any of the preceding opinions as binding. For that reason, and consistent with a [[History of responsa in Judaism|responsum]] of the [[Radbaz]], Rabbi Kasher starts with the default law that a Jew not knowing the proper day for Shabbat should count days from the last time s/he observed Shabbat, and that every seven days is Shabbat. In his view, established Jewish communities are presumed to have fixed their calendars according to this principle. Therefore, Shabbat in an established community is whatever day the community has established. Rabbi [[Isser Zalman Meltzer]] and Rabbi [[Zvi Pesach Frank]] apparently agree with this position.&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;&lt;ref name=gewirtz&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gewirtz|first1=William L.|title=Zemannim: On the Introduction of New Constructs in Halakhah|journal=The Torah U-Madda Journal|date=2012–13|volume=16|pages=153–172|jstor=23596060}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|155}} This position does not in and of itself require a formal date line to be established, and Rabbi Kasher does not seem to think that it is necessary to do so. But the ''de facto'' result of this position is consistent with the conventional International Date Line, at least anywhere there is an established Jewish community.&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;{{refn|Rabbi Shurpin&lt;ref name=chabad/&gt;{{rp|Note 14}} and Gewirtz&lt;ref name=gewirtz/&gt;{{rp|Note 4}} provide treatments as to how [[International Date Line#Historical alterations|changes in the location of the International Date Line]] might affect its use as a ''de facto'' standard in Jewish Law.}}

===Practical rulings===
In practice, the conventional International Date Line (or another mid-Pacific line near it) is the ''de facto'' date line under Jewish law, at least for established Jewish communities. The communities of Japan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jccjapan.or.jp/ Jewish Community of Japan], [http://www.jcckobe.org/ Jewish Community of Kansai]&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chc.org.nz/ Canterbury Hebrew Congregation], [http://ahc.org.nz/category/events/ Auckland Hebrew Congregation]&lt;/ref&gt; Hawaii,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sofmaarav.org/ Congregation Sof Maarav], [http://www.mauijews.org/#!events/c17et Jewish Congregation of Maui]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[French Polynesia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Andrew|title=Shabbat in Tahiti paradise|url=http://www.jewishnews.net.au/shabbat-in-tahiti-paradise/14535|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=The Australian Jewish News|date=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; all observe Shabbat on local Saturday ''(i.e.,'' Friday night until Saturday night). No known Jewish community observes Shabbat on a day other than local Saturday.&lt;ref name=jta&gt;The one arguable exception is [[Samoa]], which moved from the east side of the International Date Line to the west side around New Year's Day 2012. The [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] located one relatively observant Jewish individual living on Samoa, who said at the time that he would follow the lead of local [[Seventh-Day Adventist]] churches and light Shabbat candles on Saturday night. (See {{cite news|last1=Soclof|first1=Adam|title=Samoa time warps into Shabbat|url=http://www.jta.org/2012/01/03/the-archive-blog/samoa-time-warps-into-shabbat|accessdate=27 April 2016|agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=3 January 2012|postscript=.)}} However, the practice of a single individual may not be sufficient to establish a community practice in Jewish law.&lt;/ref&gt; However, that practical conclusion is reached in two different ways, resulting in somewhat different practice patterns in each case.

'''''Following local custom/There is no fixed date line.''''' As noted above, according to this point of view, Shabbat is simply observed on the date previously established as Shabbat by the local community—uniformly, local Saturday&lt;ref name=jta/&gt;—without any need for any further observance. This appears to be the default practice for residents of such places as Japan, New Zealand and Hawaii. At minimum, it is difficult to find evidence of other practices by residents of those areas.&lt;ref name=worker&gt;See, as an anecdotal example, {{cite web|title=The international dateline and halacha|url=http://jewishworker.blogspot.com/2005/09/international-dateline-and-halacha.html|website=The Jewish Worker|accessdate=27 April 2016|postscript=;}} search the page for "NZ".&lt;!--This is a blog, and the pertinent comment was in the responses, not in the blog post itself. As a source, it doesn't really qualify as a RS, and it is intended to be illustrative, rather than definitive. But there is little in the way of reliable evidence, which is not surprising given that one is essentially trying to prove a negative.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Taken to a fully logical conclusion, ''no fixed date line'' means that anyone in a location without an established tradition of which day is Shabbat should always depend on his own personal count of days. It is not clear whether this can currently apply to someone traveling on his or her own to an island in the Western Pacific without an established tradition. (See, for example, Rabbi Shurpin {{refn|name=chabad}} at the end of the section "The Samoa issue".) However, it seems clear that at minimum one construes an "established community" relatively broadly. So while Japan, for example, has only a scattered handful of synagogues, their uniform practice of observing Shabbat on Saturday seems sufficient to fix Saturday as the established day for Shabbat anywhere in Japan.}}

'''''Establishment of a date line by a majority among three halakhic positions.''''' The travelers' guide of the [[Star-K]] kosher supervision service, compiled according to the rulings of its rabbinic administrator, Rabbi [[Moshe Heinemann]], uses the following approach,&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt; which is also cited by others. According to this approach, the [[#90|first three numbered sections above]] constitute three valid, parallel, ''halakhic'' rulings. Shabbat is consequently fully observed on whichever day is consistent with the majority view among those opinions (two out of three). However, out of respect to the minority view of the third ruling, and with an eye toward not desecrating Shabbat, [[Melacha|Torah-level prohibitions]] are to be avoided on the day consistent with the minority view, although that day is otherwise considered a weekday. According to this rule, practice is as follows: 
* In New Zealand and Japan, the local Saturday is Shabbat according to the majority opinion (sections 2 and 3 above), and it should therefore be fully observed as Shabbat. However, since according to the minority opinion (section 1 above), Shabbat is on the local Sunday, one should not perform any Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions on Sunday. Nevertheless, on Sunday, one should pray the regular weekday prayers, donning [[tefillin]] during morning prayers.
* In Hawaii and French Polynesia, the local Saturday is Shabbat according to majority opinion (sections 1 and 3 above), and it should therefore be fully observed as Shabbat. However, since according to the minority opinion (section 2 above), Shabbat is on the local Friday, one should not perform any Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions on Friday. Friday prayers are weekday prayers, and preparation for Shabbat must be done with an eye to avoiding Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions.&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt; 
* In principle, a zone of pure doubt exists in approximately the area of 169°W–177°E,&lt;ref name=map/&gt; including places like [[Tonga]], Samoa and [[American Samoa]]. The rulings of the ''Mid-Pacific'' group above are not perfectly consistent in this area,&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt; so there is no possibility of an unambiguous "two out of three" consensus here. Rabbi Dovid Heber of the Star-K suggests that in such locations one might need to observe Shabbat fully for two days every week.&lt;ref name="heber2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heber|first1=Rabbi Dovid|title=How to Keep This Shabbos in Samoa? STAR-K Tells Us How (Samoa &amp; Tokelau To Cross International Date Line)|url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/113307/how-to-keep-this-shabbos-in-samoa-star-k-tells-us-how-samoa-tokelau-to-cross-international-date-line.html|website=The Yeshiva World News|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Star-K's international kosher supervision staff follows this approach, and there is evidence that some other travelers also do.&lt;ref name=worker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Dateline|url=http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.culture.religion.jewish.avodah/26561|website=avodah@aishdas.com|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities suggesting this approach often advise travelers to avoid the zone of doubt entirely near weekends, or to consult with a competent rabbinical authority directly.&lt;ref name=heber2/&gt;

==Crossing the halakhic date line==
The issues discussed in the previous section apply ''per se'' to individuals or communities in fixed locations. However, the act of crossing the date line (wherever it may be drawn) introduces a number of additional issues under Jewish law. Questions potentially affected include:&lt;ref name=kashrus/&gt;
{{div col}}
*Crossing the line into or out of Shabbat or a holiday, or a [[Ta'anit|rabbinic fast day]], while already aboard an airplane or a ship
*Determining what prayers to say (and when) while in transit
*Lighting candles on [[Hanukkah]]
*[[Counting of the Omer]], and consequently fixing the day for [[Shavuot]]
*[[Niddah|Counting days until relations are permitted following menstruation]]
*Fixing the date for [[Brit Milah]], [[Pidyon Haben]] or [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]]
{{div col end}}
In some cases, crossing the date line (wherever it may be drawn) has a specific impact on practice or prohibitions under Jewish law. In others, an individual's count of days (by the experience of sunset and sunrise) is the determining factor, regardless of the crossing of the date line. Details around specific questions, cases and rulings of Jewish law are beyond the scope of this article.{{refn|See Taplin&lt;ref name="taarich" /&gt;, which covers these questions in some detail. The author notes that there are consensus opinions about some—but not all—of these issues.}}

==Considerations for astronauts==
Before Israeli astronaut [[Ilan Ramon]] flew on the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] in 2003, he decided (after consultation with rabbis) to observe Shabbat according to time in his last residence, [[Kennedy Space Center|Cape Canaveral]], since he would be crossing the date line and observing sunset many times per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ask the rabbi: Shabbat in space|date=18 January 2003|website=ohr.edu|publisher=[[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem]]|url=https://ohr.edu/explore_judaism/ask_the_rabbi/ask_the_rabbi/637|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|title=Ilan Ramon|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ilan-ramon|date=February 2, 2003|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=standard /&gt; [[Judith Resnik]], the first American Jewish astronaut in space, lit (electronic) Shabbat candles according to the time in [[Johnson Space Center|Houston, TX]], her home and the location of [[Christopher C.

'''Jivatva''' ([[Sanskrit]]: जीवत्व) means – the state of life or the state of the individual soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url= http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=jIvatva&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jivatva is the state of life of the [[Jiva]] (transmigratory individual soul), the living entity, which is a particular manifestation of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], the embodied being limited to psycho-physical states, and the source of [[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]] that suffers (repeated) transmigration as result of its actions. Until ignorance ceases the Jiva remains caught in experience of the results of actions bringing merit and demerit, and in the state of individuality (''jivatva'') ([[Brahma Sutras|Brahma Sutra]] I.iv.6), and so long as the connection with the intellect as conditioning adjunct lasts, so long the individuality and transmigration of soul lasts (Brahma Sutra II.iii.30).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Method of the Vedanta: A Critical Account of the advaita Tradition|author=Swami Satchidanandendra|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZMkbWhjE2M4C&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Jivatva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2t3dUuC7OOKS7Aanq4CgDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Jivatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jivatva-bhavana is the feeling of limitation induced by the body, mind and intellect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On Wings and Wheels: A Dialogue of Moral Conflict|author=Swami Chinmayananda|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=12|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=F9MPEuEC2U8C&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Jivatva&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W-HdUouLI7Kh7AbN14DgBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Jivatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of Jivatva is adventitious, dependent on external factors; Jivatva is accidental and not an essential nature of [[Brahman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultura Indica|author=Visvanatha Devasarma|publisher=Sharda Publishing House|page=220|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CAQaAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Jivatva+Sankara&amp;dq=Jivatva+Sankara&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xuTdUs-mI8aU7Qa244CwDQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ}} &lt;/ref&gt; It is illusorily superimposed on Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hymns of Sankara|author=Sankaracarya|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=71|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IIGtWoS75HcC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=jivatva&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1utDy9qgDR&amp;sig=cNQ5nIAiZ4GfTwdl3LNGIOnaKUY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QwHeUuq0Iu2V7Aa5yYHAAw&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=jivatva&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Atman is the witness (saksin) of the activities of [[antahkarana]]  (inward intellect) composed of [[buddhi]] (intellect), [[ahankara]] (I-faculty) and [[Mind|manas]] (mind). [[Viraj]] has one Jiva and [[Hiranyagarbha]] another, because it is commonly known that when bodies are different the Jivas are different, but it is possible to have one Jiva for the past and future bodies, a difference in the bodies does not indicate difference in respect to the Jiva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language and Release: Sarvajnatman’s Pancaprakriya|author=Sarvajnatman|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=94,99|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=684DCRytbasC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=Jivatva+Sankara&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xuTdUs-mI8aU7Qa244CwDQ&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Jivatva%20Sankara&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jiva==
{{main|Jiva}}
According to [[Dvaitadvaita]] (dualism) Brahman and Jiva are different entities; that God, Soul and the Universe are three separate entities with the former governing the latter two. The Jiva (individual soul that lives in the world) is one of the three categories of realities, the other two being Jagat (the Universe or the world) and Brahman (the Universal Soul and the substratum behind the Jagat and the Jivas).The soul can migrate to the heaven and live with God. According to [[Vishishtadvaita]] (qualified dualism), God alone exists who is formless.  The Jagat and the Jivas form his body and the soul becomes liberated when it realizes that it is a part of God. According to [[Advaita Vedanta]] (non-dualism), Brahman is the ultimate supreme sole Reality beyond names and forms. Brahman, which is Truth, Consciousness and Bliss, and the soul are non-different, identical, unchangeable and eternal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Indian Scriptures|url=http://indianscriptures.50webs.com/vedanta.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the dvaita schools, jiva is essentially an eternal spiritual entity (ajada-dravya) whose essence is constituted by knowledge (jnana). As jnana-svarupa it is a sentient being (cetna) and self-revealing (svayam-prakasa), as the knower or subject of knowledge (jnata) and as the agent of action (karta) it experiences both pleasure and pain (bhokta). It is monadic in character (anu) unlike Ishvara who is all-pervasive ([[vibhu]]). Jiva is a part (amsa) of [[Paramatman]], it is supported (adheya) by, controlled (niyamya) and dependent (sesa) on the Paramatman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vaishnavism: Its Philosophy, Theology and Religious Discipline|author=S.M.Srinivasa Chari|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=245|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=evmiLInyxBMC&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=jiva+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RMvdUuvqD6aR7AbdtoDoBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=jiva%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the finite individual who experiences the waking (jagarita), sleep (svapna) and dreamless sleep (susupti) states of mind which can be successive, but rarely the Fourth ([[turiya]]) which is being-in-Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Shankar’s Advaita|author=Shyama Kumar Chattopadayaya|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|page=343|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPasbJW-1PwC&amp;pg=PA340&amp;dq=Jiva+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SdLdUuPYGYKS7AaQ5oHQAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Jiva%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; On account of the [[adhyasa]], Jiva interacts with the objects and other Jivas with a sense of doer-ship etc.; and experiences [[Saṃsāra|samsara]]; liberation from samsara is called [[moksha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prakriya Bheda in Advaita Vedanta|author=D.Krishna Ayyar|publisher=Vedantaadvaita.org|url= http://www.vedantaadvaita.org/Annexure_1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation between Jiva and Brahman==

In the [[Katha Upanishad]] the Jiva, the individual soul, and Brahman, the Universal Soul, are regarded as being at par with each other as enjoying equally the fruits of their action. In the [[Mundaka Upanishad]] only the individual soul is described as tasting of the fruits of action, the Universal Soul described simply as the on-looker. In the [[Śvetāśvatara|Svetasvatra Upanishad]] the individual soul enjoys the unborn [[Prakṛti|Prakrti]] consisting of three qualities, which the Universal Soul leaves off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is with regard to the relation of the Two Souls first dealt with by the Rig Veda in mantra I.164.17 which reads:-

:द्वा सुवर्णा सयुजा सखाया समानं वृक्षं परि षस्वजाते |
:तयोरन्यः पिप्पलं स्वाद्वत्त्यनश्नन्नयो अभि चाकशीति ||

:“Two birds of beautiful plumage closely united in friendship reside on the same tree. 
:One of them eats the sweet fruit thereof, the other witnesses without eating.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mundaka and Mandukya Upanishads|author=Swami Sharvananda|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|page=51|url= http://www.estudantedavedanta.net/Mundaka_and_Mandukya_Upanishads%20-%20Swami%20Sarvanand%20[Sanskrit-English].pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And, adapting which ideation and imagery the sage of the Mundaka Upanishad (III.1.2) proceeds to tell us that:-

:समाने वृक्षे पुरुषो निमग्नोऽनीशया शोचति मुह्यमानः |
:जुष्टं यदा पश्यत्यन्यमीशमस्य महिमानमिति वीतशोकः || 

:“Being seated on the same tree, the [[Purusha]] deluded grieves over his helplessness. 
:But when he upholds the other worshipful Lord and His Glory, he becomes free from grief.”

Jiva is limited by the inner sense organ, being limited it is distinct from the substratum consciousness of objects which is the all-pervasive consciousness (saksi). It always feels its distinction from God, because Brahman is not the object of ordinary knowledge. Jiva is the locus ([[asraya]]) of avidya. The identification between Jiva, a false entity, and Brahman, occurs only when the Jiva aspect of the Self is totally eliminated by true knowledge of the real nature of the Self dispelling the primordial avidya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advaita Vedanta and Vaishnism|author=Sanjukta Gupta|publisher=Routledge|page=85|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4AFxluCHsoAC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=jiva+in+advaita+vedanta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lh1k4TlWck&amp;sig=DmH5izrXJNDTwSszmFTLMqZsViY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nkTeUrG5HoLb7AbG-IG4Dg&amp;ved=0CHYQ6AEwCTgK#v=snippet&amp;q=jiva%20&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Svatantryavada is the doctrine of the absolute sovereignty and freedom of the Divine Will to express and manifest itself in any way it likes; Svatantrya makes the moveable and the immoveable objects appear as separate though in essence they are not separate from samvit (Universal Consciousness) and which does not conceal the nature of the Supreme. From the point of its manifestation, it is known as Abhasavada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pratyabhijnahrdayam: The Secret of Self-recognition|author=Jaideva Singh|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=17|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dVJSChd9hOoC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=abhasavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BQXeUra8OIbQ7Aaoq4HgDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhasavada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abhasavada]] is the theory of appearance, the creation theory of the Saiva and the Sakta schools according to which theory the universe consists of appearances which are all real as the aspects of the ultimate reality; the world is an abhasa (prakasa or light) of [[Shiva]], it is not [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]. In the Advaita Vedanta this is the theory according to which the Jiva is the illusory appearance of Brahma-consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World|author=Ganga Ram Garg|publisher=Concept Publishing Co.|pages=50,74,95|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=w9pmo51lRnYC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=abhasavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BQXeUra8OIbQ7Aaoq4HgDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=achhedavada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of Abhasavada finds its roots in Brahma Sutra II.iii.50 which reads – 

:आभास एव च | 

:(And, (the individual soul) is only a reflection (of the supreme Self) to be sure), 

This theory was advocated by [[Maṇḍana Miśra|Suresvara]] in which the Jivas are as real as Brahman, they being primary appearances in and through avidya, while the objects of the world are unreal, they being secondary appearances, mere reflections of the primary appearances.  The Vivarna School upholds the theory of Bimba-pratibimbavada or theory of reflection, in which the Absolute Reality, reflected in upadhis, appears as numerous selves due to the intervening adjuncts and their cause Avidya. The Bhamati School of [[Vācaspati Miśra|Vacaspati Misra]] upholds the Avacchedavada, the theory of limitation, in which the jivas are Brahman Itself but appearing as though limited by adjuncts such as the mind-body-complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhamati and Vivarna Schools of Advaita Vedanta: A Critical Approach|author=Poolasth Soobah Roodurmum|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=160|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2pU2ZQB2wUYC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=Abhasavada+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MBfeUoTBF4qL7Aa2hoGADQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Abhasavada%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

According to [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]], the Jivatva of the Jiva is a consequence of the Jiva’s false sense of identity i.e. one-ness, with the body, making Jiva an empirical individual. The sense of bodied being-hood (sasariratvam) of the Jiva is entirely due to false conviction (mithyapratiyayanimittantvat), the truly enlightened person is bodyless even when living in this life and in this body. Avidya or ignorance consists in the wrong identification of the Self with the psycho-physical complex called the individual’s body and in the development of the self-sense (atmabhimana) in the bodied being; this is the [[upadhi]] cutting into the very nature of the Jiva. The apparent modification is an epistemic fact, and the totality of cosmic plurality is also an epistemic fact. The apparently substantial Jivatva is an offshoot of avidya sustained and nourished by mithyajnana. Jivatva, the phenomenal individuality, although beginning-less, is terminable (santa) in the case of one getting release and gaining Brahmatva. The Jivatva of the Jiva is Jiva’s limitedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Shankar’s Advaita|author=Shyama Kumar Chattopadayaya|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|page=170,369-375|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPasbJW-1PwC&amp;pg=PA374&amp;dq=Pratibimbavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2B3eUof-DM-V7Aak44BQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=jivatva&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jivahood of the atman (the individualization of the soul) is unreal, it is merely an imagination caused by the delusion of buddhi, and vanishes with the annulment of the delusion that comes about by the realization of one’s real nature. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|author=Sri [[Chandrashekhara Bharati III]] of Sringeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=218|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncQYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=sri+samkara's+vivekacudamani&amp;dq=sri+samkara's+vivekacudamani&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cSjAUOuVM4vprQe-moHoCw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA|quote=Sloka 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roseboro was born in [[Ashland, Ohio]] and enrolled at [[Central State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Meet A Dodger |agency= |work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |page=17 |date=1 March 1959 |accessdate=30 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19390301&amp;id=7pkcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=D2UEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5997,102077&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers as an amateur free agent prior to the [[1952 Brooklyn Dodgers season|1952]] season and, began his [[professional baseball]] career with the [[Sheboygan Indians]] of the [[Wisconsin State League]].&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt;&lt;ref name="John Roseboro minor league statistics"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.cgi?id=rosebo001joh |title=John Roseboro minor league statistics |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He posted a .365 [[batting average]] with Sheboygan in 1952 to finish second in the league batting championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/leader.cgi?type=bat&amp;id=8c53a924 |title=1952 Wisconsin State League Batting Leaders |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roseboro missed the 1954 season due to military service but, after five years in the [[Minor league baseball|minor leagues]], he was promoted to the major leagues in June 1957 at the age of 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Johnny_Roseboro |title=Johnny Roseboro |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campanella's heir apparent===
During his first season, Roseboro served as backup catcher for the Dodgers' perennial All-Star catcher, [[Roy Campanella]], and was being groomed to be Campanella's replacement. However, he was promoted to the starting catcher's position ahead of schedule when Campanella had a tragic car accident in January 1958 that ended his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scouts Rave Over New Campy In Praising John Roseboro |agency=ANP |work=Washington Afro-American |page=13 |date=5 February 1957 |accessdate=30 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2238&amp;dat=19570205&amp;id=EuElAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=o_QFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5430,1091082&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=John Roseboro Is Learning Fast As Replacement For Roy Campanella |agency= |work=The Day |page=16 |date=17 March 1959 |accessdate=30 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&amp;dat=19590317&amp;id=9qs0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EHMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=911,1829623&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first full season, with the team having moved to Los Angeles, Roseboro hit for a .271 batting average along with 14 [[home run]]s and 43 [[runs batted in]].&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He was also named as a reserve player for the [[National League]] in the [[1958 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1958 All-Star game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/ALS/ALS195807080.shtml |title=1958 All-Star game |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1959 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1959]], Roseboro led the league's catchers in [[putout]]s and in baserunners [[caught stealing]], helping the Dodgers win the [[List of National League pennant winners|National League Pennant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1959-fielding-leaders.shtml |title=1959 National League Fielding Leaders |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1959.shtml |title=1959 National League Team Statistics and Standings |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dodgers went on to win the [[1959 World Series]], defeating the [[1959 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] in six games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1959_WS.shtml |title=1959 World Series |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After having a below par season in [[1960 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1960]], Roseboro rebounded in [[1961 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1961]] posting career highs with 18 home runs and 59 runs batted in.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He also led the National League catchers in putouts and [[double play]]s and finished second in [[fielding percentage]] and in [[Assist (baseball)|assists]] to earn his first Gold Glove Award as, the Dodgers finished the season in second place behind the [[1961 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1961-fielding-leaders.shtml |title=1961 National League Fielding Leaders |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/gold_glove_nl.shtml#1961 |title=1961 National League Gold Glove Award winners |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1961.shtml |title=1961 National League Team Statistics and Standings |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also earned his second All-Star team berth as a reserve player in the [[1961 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (second game)|1961 All-Star game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NLS/NLS196107110.shtml |title=1961 All-Star game |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He won his third All-Star berth as a reserve in the [[1962 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (first game)|1962 All-Star game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/ALS/ALS196207100.shtml |title=1962 All-Star game |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dodgers battled the [[1962 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] in a tight pennant race during the [[1962 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1962]] season with the two teams ending the season tied for first place and met in the [[1962 National League tie-breaker series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1962.shtml |title=1962 National League Team Statistics and Standings |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Giants won the three-game series to clinch the National League championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=mlb&amp;id=3617483|title=Tiebreaker Playoff Results|work=[[ESPN.com]]|date=September 30, 2008|accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marichal incident===
Roseboro was involved in a major altercation with [[Juan Marichal]] during a game between the Dodgers and [[San Francisco Giants]] at [[Candlestick Park]] on August 22, {{Baseball year|1965}}.&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mann |first=Jack |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1965/08/30/605969/the-battle-of-san-francisco |title=The Battle Of San Francisco |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=August 30, 1965 |accessdate=December 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Giants and the Dodgers had nurtured a heated [[Dodgers–Giants rivalry|rivalry]] with each other dating back to their days together in the New York City market.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"&gt;{{cite news |title=Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball |agency=Associated Press |work=The Times-News |page=18 |date=22 August 1990 |accessdate=31 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1665&amp;dat=19900822&amp;id=llYaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tSQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6791,5769085&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 1965 season neared its climax, the Dodgers were involved in a tight pennant race, entering the game leading the [[1965 Milwaukee Braves season|Milwaukee Braves]] by half a game and the Giants by one and a half games.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; The incident occurred in the aftermath of the [[Watts riots]] near Roseboro's Los Angeles home and while the [[Dominican Civil War]] raged in Marichal's home country, so emotions were raw.&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"&gt;{{cite web |last=Rosengren |first=John |url=https://www.si.com/mlb/2014/04/21/juan-marichal-johnny-roseboro-brawl-excerpt |title=Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=2014 |accessdate=December 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maury Wills]] led off the game with a [[Bunt (baseball)|bunt]] single off Marichal, and eventually scored a [[Run (baseball)|run]] when [[Ron Fairly]] hit a [[Double (baseball)|double]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SFN/SFN196508220.shtml |title=August 22, 1965 Dodgers-Giants box score |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=31 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marichal, a fierce competitor, viewed the bunt as a cheap way to get on base and took umbrage with Wills.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt; When Wills came up to bat in the second [[Inning (baseball)|inning]], Marichal threw a pitch directly at Wills sending him sprawling to the ground.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt; [[Willie Mays]] then led off the bottom of the second inning for the Giants and Dodgers' pitcher [[Sandy Koufax]] threw a pitch over Mays' head as a token form of retaliation.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt; In the top of the third inning with two [[Out (baseball)|outs]], Marichal threw a [[fastball]] that came close to hitting Fairly, prompting him to dive to the ground.&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt; Marichal's act angered the Dodgers sitting in the [[Dugout (baseball)|dugout]] and home plate umpire [[Shag Crawford]] then warned both teams that any further retaliations would not be tolerated.&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt;

Marichal came to bat in the third inning expecting Koufax to take further retaliation against him but instead, he was startled when Roseboro's return throw to Koufax after the second pitch either brushed his ear or came close enough for him to feel the breeze off the ball.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; When Marichal confronted Roseboro about the proximity of his throw, Roseboro came out of his crouch with his fists clenched.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; Marichal afterwards stated that he thought Roseboro was about to attack him and raised his bat, striking Roseboro at least twice over the head with his bat, opening a two-inch gash that sent blood flowing down the catcher's face that required 14 stitches.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Put up your dukes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/basebrawl.html |title=Put up your dukes |publisher=espn.go.com |accessdate=4 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Koufax raced in from the mound to attempt to separate them and was joined by the umpires, players and coaches from both teams.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;

A 14-minute brawl ensued on the field before Koufax, Giants captain Willie Mays and other peacemakers restored order.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt; Marichal was ejected from the game and afterwards, National League president [[Warren Giles]] suspended him for eight games (two starts), fined him a then-NL record US$1,750&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MLBN Remembers ("Incident at Candlestick") |publisher=[[MLB Network|MLBN-tv]] |date=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Inflation|US|1750|1965|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}),{{Inflation-fn|US}} and also forbade him from traveling to [[Dodger Stadium]] for the final, crucial two-game series of the season.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; Roseboro filed a $110,000 damage suit against Marichal one week after the incident, but eventually settled out of court for $7,500.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;

Years later, Roseboro stated that he was retaliating for Marichal having thrown at Wills.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; He explained that Koufax would not throw at batters for fear of hurting them due to the velocity of his pitches.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; He further stated that his throwing close to Marichal's ear was, "standard operating procedure", as a form of retribution.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; Marichal didn't face the Dodgers again until [[spring training]] in April 3, {{Baseball year|1966}}. In his first at bat against Marichal after the incident, Roseboro hit a three-run home run.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro Hammers Homer In First Meeting With Juan Marichal"&gt;{{cite news |title=John Roseboro Hammers Homer In First Meeting With Juan Marichal |agency=Associated Press |work=The Day |page=25 |date=4 April 1966 |accessdate=30 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&amp;dat=19660404&amp;id=yuwgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wnIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=873,438492&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; San Francisco General Manager [[Chub Feeney]] approached Dodgers General Manager [[Buzzy Bavasi]] to attempt to arrange a handshake between Marichal and Roseboro, but Roseboro declined the offer.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro Hammers Homer In First Meeting With Juan Marichal"/&gt;

Dodger fans remained angry with Marichal for several years after the altercation, and reacted unfavorably when he was signed by the Dodgers in [[1975 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1975]].  By then, however, Roseboro had forgiven Marichal, and personally appealed to fans to do the same.&lt;ref name = "boiling"/&gt;

===Later career===
The Dodgers went on to win the [[1965 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1965]] National League Pennant by two games over the Giants. Even though the Giants won the two games against the Dodgers during which Marichal had been suspended, the outcome of the season may have been different without the Giants' pitcher's suspension, as he finished the season with a 22-13 [[Win–loss record (pitching)|win-loss]] record.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; Roseboro once again guided the Dodgers' pitching staff to a league-leading 2.81 earned run average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1965.shtml |title=1965 National League Team Statistics and Standings |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He caught for two twenty game winners in 1965 with Koufax winning 26 games, while [[Don Drysdale]] won 23 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/LAD/1965.shtml |title=1965 Los Angeles Dodgers Batting, Pitching, &amp; Fielding Statistics |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''[[The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract]]'', baseball historian [[Bill James]] said the decision to give [[Joe Torre]]  a {{Baseball year|1965}} National League Gold Glove Award was absurd, stating that he was given the award because of his offensive statistics and that either Roseboro or [[Tom Haller]] was more deserving of the award.&lt;ref name="The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract"/&gt; In the [[1965 World Series]] against the [[1965 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]], Roseboro contributed a two-run [[Single (baseball)|single]] to win Game 3 of the series as, the Dodgers went on to win the world championship in seven games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/LAN/LAN196510090.shtml |title=1965 World Series Game 3 box score |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1965_WS.shtml |title=1965 World Series |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dodgers' pitching staff continued to lead the league in earned run average in [[1966 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1966]] as they battled with the [[1966 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] and the [[1966 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] in a tight pennant race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1966.shtml#teams_standard_pitching::7 |title=1966 National League Team Pitching Statistics |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dodgers eventually prevailed to win the National League Pennant for a second consecutive year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1966.shtml |title=1966 National League Team Statistics and Standings |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roseboro led the league with a career-high 903 putouts and finished second to Joe Torre in fielding percentage to win his second Gold Glove Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1964-fielding-leaders.shtml |title=1966 National League Fielding Leaders |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/gold_glove_nl.shtml#1966 |title=1966 National League Gold Glove Award winners |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dodgers would eventually lose the [[1966 World Series]], getting swept in four games by the [[1966 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1966_WS.shtml |title=1966 World Series |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dodgers would fall to 8th place in the [[1967 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1967]] season and Roseboro would be traded to the [[Minnesota Twins]] after the season with [[Bob Miller (baseball, born 1939)|Bob Miller]] and [[Ron Perranoski]] for [[Mudcat Grant]] and [[Zoilo Versalles]].&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt; While with the Twins, he would be named to his fourth and final All-Star team when he was named as a reserve for the [[American League]] team in the [[1969 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1969 All-Star game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/ALS/ALS196907230.shtml |title=1969 All-Star game |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=30 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the season, Roseboro was released by the Twins.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He signed as a [[free agent]] with the [[Washington Senators (1961–71)|Washington Senators]] on December 31, 1969 but appeared in only 46 games for the last place Senators.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He played in his final major league game on August 11, [[1970 Washington Senators season|1970]] at the age of 37.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt;

==Career statistics==
In an fourteen-year major league career, Roseboro played in 1,585 [[Games played|games]], accumulating 1,206 [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] in 4,847 [[at bats]] for a .249 career batting average along with 104 home runs, 548 runs batted in and an [[on-base percentage]] of .326.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He had a .989 career fielding percentage as a catcher.

==Later life==
After completing his playing career with Washington, Roseboro coached for the Senators (1971) and [[California Angels]] (1972–74). Later, he served as a [[Minor league baseball|minor league]] batting instructor (1977) and catching instructor (1987) for the Dodgers. Roseboro and his wife, Barbara Fouch Roseboro, also owned a [[Beverly Hills]] [[public relations]] firm.

Roseboro appeared as a [[Undercover operation#Plainclothes law enforcement|plainclothes]] officer in the 1966 ''[[Dragnet (series)#1966 television series|Dragnet]]'' TV movie. He also appeared as himself in the 1962 film ''[[Experiment in Terror]]'' along with [[Don Drysdale]] and [[Wally Moon]], and as himself in the 1963 ''[[Mister Ed]]'' episode "Leo Durocher Meets Mister Ed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Roseboro|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0741771/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1|website=imdb|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chevrolet]] was one of the sponsors of the Dodgers' radio coverage in the mid-1960s. The song "See the USA in Your Chevrolet", made famous by [[Dinah Shore]] in the '50s, was sung in Chevrolet commercials by Roseboro and other Dodger players. Dodger announcer [[Jerry Doggett]] once joked that Roseboro was a singer "whose singing career was destined to go absolutely nowhere."

After several years of bitterness over their famous altercation, Roseboro and Marichal became friends in the 1980s.&lt;ref name = "boiling"&gt;{{cite news |title=Baseball Boiling Over: 25 Years After Juan Marichal Clubbed John Roseboro |agency=Associated Press |work=Gettysburg Times |page=B1 |date=21 August 1990 |accessdate=30 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2202&amp;dat=19900821&amp;id=oVwlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j-YFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1637,2098490&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roseboro personally appealed to the [[Baseball Writers' Association of America]] not to hold the incident against Marichal after he was passed over for election to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] in his first two years of eligibility.  Marichal was elected in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1983|1983]], and thanked Roseboro during his induction speech.&lt;ref name="Put up your dukes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TBT"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Team-by-Team Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball |last=Purdy |first=Dennis |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=[[Workman Publishing Company|Workman]] |location=New York City |isbn=0-7611-3943-5 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "There were no hard feelings on my part," Roseboro said, "and I thought if that was made public, people would believe that this was really over with. So I saw him at a Dodger old-timers' game, and we posed for pictures together, and I actually visited him in the Dominican. The next year, he was in the Hall of Fame. Hey, over the years, you learn to forget things."&lt;ref name="Put up your dukes"/&gt;

Roseboro died of heart disease on August 16, 2002 in [[Los Angeles]] at age 69.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro Dies"/&gt; Marichal served as an honorary pallbearer at his funeral.  "Johnny's forgiving me was one of the best things that happened in my life," he said, at the service. "I wish I could have had John Roseboro as my catcher."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/la-sp-roseboro-marichal-plaschke-20150823-column.html|first=Bill|last=Plaschke|title=Fifty years after Giants' Juan Marichal hit Dodgers' John Roseboro with a bat, all is forgiven|date=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bacciarelli Jan Zamoyski.jpg|225px|thumb|right|[[Jan Zamoyski]], an important 16th-century [[Poland|Polish]] magnate]]
'''Magnate''', from the [[Late Latin]] ''magnas'', a great man, itself from [[Latin]] ''magnus'', 'great', designates a noble or other man in a high social position, by birth, wealth or other qualities. In reference to the [[Middle Ages]], the term is often used to distinguish higher territorial landowners and warlords such as [[count]]s, [[earl]]s, [[duke]]s, and territorial-[[prince]]s from the [[baronage]].

==England==
In [[Kingdom of England|England]], the magnate class went through a change in the later Middle Ages. It had previously consisted of all [[tenants-in-chief]] of the crown, a group of more than a hundred families. The emergence of [[English Parliament|Parliament]] led to the establishment of a parliamentary peerage that received personal summons, rarely more than sixty families.&lt;ref name="ChrimesRoss1972"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pugh|first=T.B|editor=S.B. Chrimes, C.D. Ross and R.A. Griffiths|title=Fifteenth-Century England, 1399-1509: Studies in Politics and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7US8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA86|accessdate=17 July 2013|year=1972|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780064911269|page=86|chapter=The magnates, knights and gentry}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar class in the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] world were the [[Flatha]]. In the Middle Ages a [[bishop]] sometimes held territory as a magnate, collecting the revenue of the [[Manorialism|manors]] and the associated [[knight's fee|knights' fees]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In the Tudor period, after [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] defeated [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] at [[Battle of Bosworth Field|Bosworth Field]], Henry made a point of executing or neutralizing as many magnates as possible. Henry VII would make parliament [[attainder|attaint]] undesirable nobles and magnates, thereby stripping them of their wealth, protection from torture, and power. Henry VII also used the [[Court of the Star Chamber]] to have powerful nobles executed. [[Henry VIII]] continued this approach in his reign; he inherited a survivalistic mistrust of nobles from his father. Henry VIII ennobled very few men and the ones he did were all "new men": [[novus homo|novi homines]], greatly indebted to him and having very limited power.

==Hungary==
The term was specifically applied to the members (equivalent to British Peers) of the Upper House in the [[Apostolic Majesty|Apostolic Kingdom of Hungary]], the ''Főrendiház'' or [[House of Magnates]].

== Poland and Lithuania ==
{{main|Magnates of Poland and Lithuania}}
Magnates were a [[social class]] of wealthy and influential [[nobility]] in the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], and later the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

== Serbia ==
{{main|Velikaš}}
{{see also|Medieval Serbian nobility}}
 [[File:Jovan Oliver.jpg|thumb|[[Jovan Oliver]] (1310–1356), the Serbian magnate, held several prestigious titles such as ''[[despot (court title)|despot]]'', ''[[sevastokrator]]'', ''veliki vojvoda'' and ''[[veliki čelnik]]''.]]
The magnates, ''velikaši'', of [[Serbia in the Middle Ages]] were noted by their higher titles in relation to those held by the lesser nobles. In the Early and High Middle Ages the highest (most prestigious) title was ''vojvoda'', a military rank and title of governors. During the [[Serbian Empire]] (1345–71) the higher court members held titles such as ''[[despot (court title)|despot]]'', ''[[sevastokrator]]'' and ''[[kesar (title)|kesar]]''. During foreign rule, under [[Ottoman Serbia|the Ottoman Empire]], [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Republic of Venice]], and later in [[Serbian Revolution|the Revolution]], and [[Principality of Serbia|Principality]] the magnates were influential voivodes (though all voivodes were not considered magnates).

== Spain ==
In Spain, since the late Middle Ages the highest class of nobility hold the appellation of [[Grandee of Spain]].

== Sweden ==
{{further|Swedish nobility}}
In Sweden, the wealthiest medieval lords were known as ''storman'' (plural ''stormän''), "great men", a similar description and meaning as the English term magnate.

{{Standard model of particle physics}}

A '''Majorana fermion''' ({{IPAc-en|m|aɪ|ə|'|r|ɒ|n|ə|_|'|f|ɛər|m|iː|ɒ|n}}&lt;ref name=youtube_pronunciation&gt;{{YouTube| XHUgetdkJmg | "Quantum Computation possible with Majorana Fermions" }}, uploaded 19 April 2013, retrieved 5 October 2014; and also based on [[Ettore Majorana|the physicist's name's pronunciation]].&lt;/ref&gt;), also referred to as a '''Majorana particle''', is a [[fermion]] that is its own [[antiparticle]]. They were hypothesized by [[Ettore Majorana]] in 1937. The term is sometimes used in opposition to a [[Dirac fermion]], which describes fermions that are not their own antiparticles.

With the exception of the [[neutrino]], all of the [[Standard Model]] fermions are known to behave as Dirac fermions at low energy (after [[electroweak symmetry breaking]]), and none are Majorana fermions. The nature of the neutrinos is not settled – they may be either Dirac or Majorana fermions.

In [[condensed matter physics]], bound Majorana fermions can appear as [[quasiparticle]] [[Excited state|excitations]] – the collective movement of several individual particles, not a single one, and they are governed by [[Anyon#Non-abelian anyons|non-abelian statistics]].

== Theory ==
The concept goes back to Majorana's suggestion in 1937&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-48095-2_10 |chapter=A symmetric theory of electrons and positrons |title=Ettore Majorana Scientific Papers |pages=201–33 |year=2006 |last1=Majorana |first1=Ettore |last2=Maiani |first2=Luciano |isbn=978-3-540-48091-4 |editor1-first=Giuseppe Franco |editor1-last=Bassani }} Translated from: {{cite journal |doi=10.1007/bf02961314 |title=Teoria simmetrica dell'elettrone e del positrone |journal=Il Nuovo Cimento |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=171–84 |year=1937 |last1=Majorana |first1=Ettore |language=Italian |bibcode=1937NCim...14..171M }}&lt;/ref&gt; that neutral [[Spin (physics)|spin]]-{{frac|1|2}} particles can be described by a real [[relativistic wave equations|wave equation]] (the [[Majorana equation]]), and would therefore be identical to their antiparticle (because the wave functions of particle and antiparticle are related by [[complex conjugate|complex conjugation]]).

The difference between Majorana fermions and Dirac fermions can be expressed mathematically in terms of the [[creation and annihilation operators]] of [[second quantization]]: The creation operator &lt;math&gt;\gamma^{\dagger}_j&lt;/math&gt; creates a fermion in quantum state &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; (described by a ''real'' wave function), whereas the annihilation operator &lt;math&gt;\gamma_j&lt;/math&gt; annihilates it (or, equivalently, creates the corresponding antiparticle). For a Dirac fermion the operators &lt;math&gt;\gamma^{\dagger}_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_j&lt;/math&gt; are distinct, whereas for a Majorana fermion they are identical. The ordinary fermionic annihilation and creation operators &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{\dagger}&lt;/math&gt; can be written in terms of two Majorana operators &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_2&lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;f=(\gamma_1+i\gamma_2)/\sqrt{2},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f^{\dagger}=(\gamma_1-i\gamma_2)/\sqrt{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

In supersymmetry models, [[neutralino]]s — superpartners of gauge bosons and Higgs bosons — are Majorana.

=== Identities ===
Another common convention for the normalization of the Majorana fermion [[creation and annihilation operators|operator]] is
:&lt;math&gt;f=(\gamma_1+i\gamma_2)/2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f^\dagger=(\gamma_1-i\gamma_2)/2&lt;/math&gt;
This convention has the advantage that the Majorana operator [[idempotence|squares to the identity]].

Using this convention, a collection of Majorana fermions &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;i=1,2,..,n&lt;/math&gt;) obey the following [[commutator|commutation]] identities
*&lt;math&gt;\{\gamma_i,\gamma_j\}=2\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{ijkl} [\gamma_i A_{ij} \gamma_j, \gamma_k B_{kl} \gamma_l]= \sum_{ij}4\gamma_i [A,B]_{ij} \gamma_j &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are [[skew-symmetric matrix|antisymmetric]] matrices.

== Elementary particles ==
Because particles and antiparticles have opposite conserved charges, Majorana fermions have zero charge. All of the elementary fermions of the [[Standard Model]] have gauge charges, so they cannot have fundamental [[Majorana mass]]es.

However, the right-handed [[sterile neutrino]]s introduced to explain [[neutrino oscillation]] could have Majorana masses. If they do, then at low energy (after [[electroweak symmetry breaking]]), by the [[seesaw mechanism]], the neutrino fields would naturally behave as six Majorana fields, with three of them expected to have very high masses (comparable to the [[GUT scale]]) and the other three expected to have very low masses (below 1&amp;nbsp;eV). If right-handed neutrinos exist but do not have a Majorana mass, the neutrinos would instead behave as three [[Dirac fermion]]s and their antiparticles with masses coming directly from the Higgs interaction, like the other Standard Model fermions.
[[File:Ettore Majorana.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Ettore Majorana]] hypothesised the existence of Majorana fermions in 1937]]

The seesaw mechanism is appealing because it would naturally explain why the observed neutrino masses are so small. However, if the neutrinos are Majorana then they violate the conservation of [[lepton number]] and even of [[B − L]].

[[Double beta decay#Neutrinoless double beta decay|Neutrinoless double beta decay]], which has not (yet) been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Werner |last=Rodejohann |title=Neutrino-less double beta decay and particle physics |journal=[[International Journal of Modern Physics]] |volume=E20 |issue=9 |pages=1833–1930 |year=2011 |doi=10.1142/S0218301311020186 |arxiv=1106.1334 |bibcode=2011IJMPE..20.1833R |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be viewed as two ordinary [[beta decay]] events whose resultant antineutrinos immediately annihilate with each other, and is only possible if neutrinos are their own antiparticles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= J. |last1=Schechter |first2= J.W.F. |last2=Valle |title=Neutrinoless double beta decay in SU(2) x U(1) – Theories |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=25 |issue=11 |pages=2951–2954 |year=1982 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.25.2951 |bibcode=1982PhRvD..25.2951S |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Majorana bound states ==
In [[Superconductivity|superconducting materials]], Majorana fermions can emerge as (non-fundamental) [[quasiparticle]]s (more commonly referred to as [[Bogoliubov quasiparticles]] in condensed matter physics). This becomes possible because a quasiparticle in a superconductor is its own antiparticle.

Mathematically, the superconductor imposes [[electron hole]] "symmetry" on the quasiparticle excitations, relating the creation operator &lt;math&gt;\gamma(E)&lt;/math&gt; at energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; to the annihilation operator  &lt;math&gt;{\gamma^{\dagger}(-E)}&lt;/math&gt; at energy &lt;math&gt;-E&lt;/math&gt;. Majorana fermions can be bound to a defect at zero energy, and then the combined objects are called Majorana bound states or Majorana zero modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Frank | last = Wilczek | title = Majorana returns | journal = [[Nature Physics]] | volume=5 | pages=614–618 | date=2009 | doi = 10.1038/nphys1380 | url = http://ctp.lns.mit.edu/Wilczek_Nature/Majorana_return434.pdf | issue=9 | bibcode=2009NatPh...5..614W }}&lt;/ref&gt; This name is more appropriate than Majorana fermion (although the distinction is not always made in the literature), because the statistics of these objects is no longer [[Quantum field theory#Fermions|fermionic]]. Instead, the Majorana bound states are an example of [[Anyon#Non-abelian anyons|non-abelian anyons]]: interchanging them changes the state of the system in a way that depends only on the order in which the exchange was performed. The non-abelian statistics that Majorana bound states possess allows them to be used as a building block for a [[topological quantum computer]].&lt;ref name=nayak2008&gt;{{cite journal | title = Non-Abelian anyons and topological quantum computation | journal = [[Reviews of Modern Physics]] | volume = 80 | issue = 3 | pages = 1083–1159 | date = 2008 | first1 = Chetan | last1 = Nayak | first2= Steven H. | last2 = Simon | first3 = Ady | last3 = Stern | first4 = Michael | last4 = Freedman | first5 = Sankar | last5 = Das Sarma | bibcode = 2008RvMP...80.1083N |doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.80.1083 | arxiv = 0707.1889 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[quantum vortex]] in certain superconductors or superfluids can trap midgap states, so this is one source of Majorana bound states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=N.B. Kopnin|author2=M.M.

=== Experiments in superconductivity ===
In 2008, Fu and Kane provided a groundbreaking development by theoretically predicting that Majorana bound states can appear at the interface between [[topological insulators]] and superconductors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Liang | last1 = Fu | first2 = Charles L. | last2 = Kane |title=Superconducting Proximity Effect and Majorana Fermions at the Surface of a Topological Insulator|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=10|page=096407|date=2008|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.096407|issue=9|bibcode = 2008PhRvL.100i6407F |arxiv = 0707.1692 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Liang | last1 = Fu | first2 = Charles L. | last2 = Kane | title=Josephson current and noise at a superconductor/quantum-spin-Hall-insulator/superconductor junction|journal=[[Physical Review B]]|volume=79|page=161408|date=2009|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.79.161408|issue=16|bibcode = 2009PhRvB..79p1408F |arxiv = 0804.4469 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many proposals of a similar spirit soon followed, where it was shown that Majorana bound states can appear even without any topological insulator.

On 16 August 2018, a strong evidence for the existence of Majorana bound states (or Majorana anyons) in an [[iron-based superconductor]], which many alternative trivial explanations cannot account for, was reported by researchers in Prof. Gao Hong-jun's team and Prof. Ding Hong's team at Institute of Physics, [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] and [[University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences|University of Chinese Academy of Sciences]], when they used [[scanning tunneling spectroscopy]] on the superconducting Dirac surface state of the iron-based superconductor. It was the first time that Majorana particles were observed in a bulk of pure substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Dongfei|last2=Kong|first2=Lingyuan|last3=Fan|first3=Peng|last4=Chen|first4=Hui|last5=Zhu|first5=Shiyu|last6=Liu|first6=Wenyao|last7=Cao|first7=Lu|last8=Sun|first8=Yujie|last9=Du|first9=Shixuan|date=2018-08-16|title=Evidence for Majorana bound states in an iron-based superconductor|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aao1797|journal=Science|pages=eaao1797|doi=10.1126/science.aao1797|issn=0036-8075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Majorana bound states in quantum error correction===

Majorana bound states can also be realized in quantum [[error correcting code]]s.  This is done by creating so called 'twist defects' in codes such as the [[Toric code]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bombin|first1=H.|title=Topological Order with a Twist: Ising Anyons from an Abelian Model|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=14 July 2010|volume=105|issue=3|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.030403|bibcode=2010PhRvL.105c0403B|arxiv=1004.1838}}&lt;/ref&gt; which carry unpaired Majorana modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.92.245139 | volume=92 | title=Demonstrating non-Abelian statistics of Majorana fermions using twist defects | journal=Physical Review B| arxiv=1508.04166 | bibcode=2015PhRvB..92x5139Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; The braiding of Majoranas realized in such a way forms a [[projective representation]] of the [[braid group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.87.045130 | volume=87 | title=Twist defects and projective non-Abelian braiding statistics | journal=Physical Review B| arxiv=1208.4834 | bibcode=2013PhRvB..87d5130B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a realization of Majoranas would allow them to be used to store and process [[quantum information]] within a [[Quantum computer|quantum computation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hastings|first1=M. B.|last2=Geller|first2=A.|title=Reduced Space-Time and Time Costs Using Dislocation Codes and Arbitrary Ancillas|journal=QIC|date=2015|volume=15|pages=0962–0986|url=http://www.rintonpress.com/xxqic15/qic-15-1112/0962-0986.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the codes typically have no Hamiltonian to provide suppression of errors, fault-tolerance would be provided by the underlying quantum error correcting code.

The Tree of Life is the tallest and largest three-dimensional indoor staircase mural&lt;ref&gt;http://www.limcabookofrecords.in/subcategory_detailed.asp?cat=PAINTING&amp;id=81#&lt;/ref&gt; by artist Manav Gupta. It covers approximately 5,000 sq ft of visible frontage through a glass façade and 10,000 sq ft of total painted surface. Its significance lies in the methodology of creation as a work of contemporary art, with the first of its kind simultaneous use of four different art practices in conceptual, site specific, collaborative and performance art.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-07-13/people/28308156_1_paint-mural-employees&lt;/ref&gt;

When commissioned by [[Bharti Airtel]] Ltd to create a "staircase artwork"&lt;ref&gt;http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/bharti-airtel-racing-for-top-telecom-firm-spot/1/17990.html&lt;/ref&gt; at their headquarters, the artist introduced a unique sustainable development process in corporate entity, by establishing that art can contribute to the business environment as well, by refreshing the intangible quality of its soft power among employees. 
Adding a collaborative dimension, he conceptualised the mural as a public art project by allowing thousands of employees the experience of putting brush strokes. In the process, a series of role plays of teaching and motivating employees took effect as performance art. In the second half of the project, a three dimensional site specific composition took shape. With Gupta working solo all through the day,live in front of 3500 employees and almost as many visitors at the corporate campus site, the mural took three months to complete as an evolving storyline of five elements in Nature. Keeping in mind the visibility of the staircase all over the campus through a 60&amp;nbsp;ft high glass facade,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indianexpress.com/news/mittal-unveils-5storey-high-mural-at-airtel-centre/650710/1&lt;/ref&gt; the site specific intervention amalgamated the background wall and the front face of the staircase perspectives of five floors into a single canvas merging surrounding sides and roof within one composition.
He has pioneered co-creation with his "Jugalbandis" (Collaborations) with leading musicians,poets,dancers including Dr.L.Subramanium,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flickr.com/photos/36719111@N03/3386555395/in/photostream/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shubha Mudgal]], [[Anup Jalota]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mangalorean.com/news.php?newstype=broadcast&amp;broadcastid=51185 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002423/http://mangalorean.com/news.php?newstype=broadcast&amp;broadcastid=51185 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rahul Sharma (musician)|Rahul Sharma]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apexstuff.com/bt/200709/intown.asp&lt;/ref&gt; where he translates a performing artist's oveure LIVE on stage on canvas(2003–2011).He has co authored a book of poems and paintings with former President of India Dr [[A.P.J.

'''Marfa Inofuentes Pérez''' (1969–2015) was an [[Afro-Bolivian]] activist involved in the Constitutional reform movement to recognize black Bolivians as an ethnic minority in the country. After achieving the goal for Afro-Bolivians to be protected under the law, she served as the head the Ministry of Gender and was appointed deputy mayor of the Peripheral Macrodistrict of the Municipality of La Paz.

==Early life==
Marfa Inofuentes Pérez was born in 1969 in [[La Paz]], Bolivia, one of three children of Benjamín Inofuentes.{{sfn|Cajías de la Vega|Cronin|2016}}{{sfn|Insumisos Latinoamericanos|n.d.|p=4}} Her father was born in Tocaña, a village in the [[Bolivian Yungas|Bolivian Yungas Region]], where the majority of the country's of Afro-Bolivians originated. After completion of her secondary studies, Inofuentes enrolled in the [[Universidad Mayor de San Andrés]], studying sociology and law.{{sfn|Cajías de la Vega|Cronin|2016}}{{sfn|Insumisos Latinoamericanos|n.d.|pp=4–5}}

==Career==
In 1990 Inofuentes joined the Afro-Bolivian Saya Cultural Movement ({{lang-es|Movimiento Cultural Saya Afroboliviana (MCSA)}}), a group organized to preserve the cultural traditions of black Bolivians, particularly the artform of ''[[Saya (artform)|saya]]'', by increasing their visibility and acceptance in the wider society. She participated in a public performance of saya in Tocaña in 1990, one of the first times that the public was allowed to witness the ceremonies.{{sfn|Cajías de la Vega|Cronin|2016}} 

In 2001, after the [[World Conference against Racism 2001|World Conference against Racism]], Inofuentes and Jorge Medina, co-founded the Afro-Bolivian Center for Community Development ({{lang-es|Centro Afroboliviano para el Desarrollo Integral y Comunitario (CADIC)}}) to advocate for government recognition of Bolivia's black population.{{sfn|Cajías de la Vega|Cronin|2016}}{{sfn|''Erbol Digital''|2015}} According to a 1997 poll by the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], which included [[Mónica Rey Gutiérrez]], another Afro-Bolivian activist, the population numbered around 20,000 people,{{sfn|Murphy|2008}}{{sfn|Busdiecker|2016}} but the previous census in 2001 had no category except "other" to survey the actual size of the ethnic group. She believed that lack of state recognition as a minority, and inability to determine the size of the population, furthered marginalization of Afro-Bolivians, as there were no protections in law for discrimination or racial violence.{{sfn|Murphy|2008}}

Traveling widely, Inofuentes represented Bolivia's black women at meetings of the [[Organization of Ibero-American States]] in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and the United States. She was also a member of the feminist organization the Network of Caribbean Latin American and African Diaspora Women ({{lang-es|Red de Mujeres del Caribe, de América Latina y la Diáspora Africana (RMCALDA)}}).{{sfn|Cajías de la Vega|Cronin|2016}} 

In 2006, after the election of President [[Evo Morales]], lawmakers met in [[Sucre]] to rewrite the [[Constitution of Bolivia|Constitution]]. Inofuentes and other black activists lobbied all of the political parties, pressing for recognition as an ethnic group.{{sfn|Murphy|2008}} As one of the main activists involved in the [[Bolivian Constitutional Assembly election, 2006|Bolivian Constitutional Assembly]], Inofuentes argued for the addition of articles to protect the civil rights of Afro-Bolivians,{{sfn|Cajías de la Vega|Cronin|2016}} including language that recognized the population and protected their culture with the same provisions afforded to indigenous people and other intercultural minorities.{{sfn|Martínez Mita|2008|p=67}} Gaining the concessions desired, in 2009, Afro-Bolivians gained constitutional protection and recognition, after the [[Bolivian constitutional referendum, 2009|Bolivian constitutional referendum]] passed.{{sfn|Martínez Mita|2008|p=69}}{{sfn|Schipani|2011}} Her activism led to her being appointed to head the Ministry of Gender.{{sfn|Cajías de la Vega|Cronin|2016}} In 2010, she was appointed as Deputy Mayor of the Peripheral Macrodistrict of the Municipality of La Paz, but after one year, she developed health problems and entered into a coma from which she did not recover.{{sfn|Cuiza|2015}}

==Death and legacy==
Inofuentes died on 4 March 2015 at the Obrero Hospital in La Paz and is most remembered for her activism to gain recognition for the cultural traditions and identity of Afro-Bolivians.{{sfn|Cuiza|2015}}{{sfn|Ortega|2015}}

The definition was intended to clarify when the U.S. Attorney General could assist state and local authorities in investigations of violent acts and shootings in places of public use.''"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ingraham|first1=Christopher|title=What makes a 'mass shooting' in America|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/03/what-makes-a-mass-shooting-in-america/|accessdate=5 November 2017|work=Washington Post|date=3 December 2015|quote="''But starting in 2013, federal statutes defined "mass killing" as three or more people killed, regardless of weapons.''"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Follman|first1=Mark|title=What Exactly Is A Mass Shooting|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/08/what-is-a-mass-shooting|publisher=Mother Jones|accessdate=August 9, 2015|quote="''In January 2013, a mandate for federal investigation of mass shootings authorized by President Barack Obama lowered that baseline to three or more victims killed.

A mass shooting may be committed by individuals or organizations in public or non-public places. [[Terrorist groups]] in recent times have used the tactic of mass shootings to fulfill their political aims. Individuals who commit mass shootings may fall into any of a number of categories, including [[Familicide|killers of family]], of [[Workplace violence|coworkers]], of [[School shooting|students]], and of random strangers. Individuals' motives for shooting vary.

Responses to mass shootings take a variety of forms, depending on the context: number of casualties, the country, political climate, and other factors. The [[News media|media]] cover mass shootings extensively and often sensationally, and the effect of that coverage has been examined. Countries such as the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]] have changed their gun laws in the wake of mass shootings. In contrast, the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|United States' constitution]] prohibits laws which disallow firearm ownership outright and owns about half of the world's guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/world/americas/mass-shootings-us-international.html|title=What Explains U.S. Mass Shootings?

In Australia, a 2006 paper defined a mass shooting as "one in which ⩾5 firearm‐related homicides are committed by one or two perpetrators in proximate events in a civilian setting, not counting any perpetrators".&lt;ref name=PMC&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Chapman|first1=S.|title=Australia's 1996 gun law reforms: faster falls in firearm deaths, firearm suicides, and a decade without mass shootings|pmc=2704353|pmid=17170183|doi=10.1136/ip.2006.013714|volume=12|date=December 2006|pages=365–72|journal=Injury Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crime violence research group [[Gun Violence Archive]], whose research is used by all major American media outlets defines Mass Shooting as "FOUR or more shot and/or killed in a single event [incident], at the same general time and location not including the shooter" differentiating between Mass Shooting and Mass Murder [Killing] and not counting shooters as victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/methodology|title=General Methodology - Gun Violence Archive|website=www.gunviolencearchive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A U.S. [[Congressional Research Service]] report explicitly excluded from its definition of public mass shootings those in which the violence is a means to an end, for example where the gunmen "pursue criminal profit or kill in the name of terrorist ideologies".&lt;ref name="CRS"/&gt;

The single deadliest event was the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]] in which 164 people were killed and a further 308 people were wounded by terrorists.

====South Korea====
South Korea has suffered multiple mass shootings in the [[South Korean Army]], mainly due to soldier's stress and conflicts from its violence and detention from society.

====Japan====
Japan has as few as two gun-related homicides per year. These numbers include all homicides in the country, not just mass shootings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/07/a-land-without-guns-how-japan-has-virtually-eliminated-shooting-deaths/260189/|title=A Land Without Guns: How Japan Has Virtually Eliminated Shooting Deaths|work=The Atlantic|date=July 23, 2012|accessdate=December 16, 2015|first=Max|last=Fisher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when adjusting for different population sizes, analysing data between 2009 and 2015 (therefore excluding shootings like the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting and the 2017 Las Vegas shooting), the US falls to 12th in a comparison between the US and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://crimeresearch.org/2015/06/comparing-death-rates-from-mass-public-shootings-in-the-us-and-europe |title= UPDATED: Comparing Death Rates from Mass Public Shootings and Mass Public Violence in the US and Europe |agency= Crime Prevention Research Center |first=John |last=Lott |date= January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motives==
Mass shootings can be motivated by [[misanthropy]]&lt;ref&gt;De Freitas, Julian, and Mina Cikara. "Deep down my enemy is good: Thinking about the true self reduces intergroup bias." (2017)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[terrorism]] and caused by [[mental illness]], [[inceldom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/other-hand/2018/02/high-school-students-demand-action-gun-control-following-parkland|title=High school students demand action on gun control following Parkland shooting - rabble.ca|website=rabble.ca|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Brunt, Brian, and W.

"Exploring school rampage shootings: Research, theory, and policy." The Social Science Journal 49.3 (2012): 304-313.&lt;/ref&gt; among other reasons.&lt;ref name=frum/&gt; Forensic psychologist [[Stephen Ross (psychologist)|Stephen Ross]] says that extreme anger and the thought shooters are working for a cause, rather than mental illness, is most often the explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=Holly|title=Inside the mind of a mass murderer|url=http://wane.com/2015/12/02/inside-the-mind-of-a-mass-murderer/|publisher=WANE.com|date=December 2, 2015|accessdate=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by [[Vanderbilt University]] researchers found that "fewer than 5% of the 120,000 gun-related killings in the United States between 2001 and 2010 were perpetrated by people diagnosed with mental illness".&lt;ref name=wolf&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolf|first1=Amy|title=Mental Illness is the wrong scapegoat after mass shootings|url=http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2014/12/mental-illness-wrong-scapegoat-shootings/|publisher=Vanderbilt University|date=December 11, 2014|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Roman]] of the [[Urban Institute]] argues that, while better access to mental health care, restricting high powered weapons, and creating a defensive infrastructure to combat terrorism are constructive, they don't address the greater issue, which is "we have a lot of really angry young men in our country and in the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-roman-phd/angry-young-men-and-mass_b_10503106.html Angry young Men and Mass Killings].

Author [[Dave Cullen]] described killer Eric Harris as an "injustice collector" in his 2009 book ''[[Columbine (book)|Columbine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Finally understand why.

Likewise, mass shooting expert and former FBI profiler Mary O'Toole also uses the phrase "injustice collector" in characterizing motives of some mass shooting perpetrators.&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bekiempis|first1=Victoria|title=Meet Mass-Shooting Expert Mary Ellen O'Toole|url=http://www.newsweek.com/serial-killer-mass-shooter-school-shootings-federal-bureau-investigation-367374|date=September 4, 2015|publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation, criminologist [[James Alan Fox]] contends that mass murderers are "enabled by social isolation" and typically experience "years of disappointment and failure that produce a mix of profound hopelessness and deep-seated resentment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James Alan |last=Fox |date=January 16, 2011 |url= http://www.boston.com/community/blogs/crime_punishment/2011/01/the_real_causes_of_mass_murder.html |title= The real causes of mass murder |work= Boston.com |accessdate= November 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/12/03/james-alan-fox-san-bernardino-focus-murderous-partnership/76725342/|title=James Alan Fox: In San Bernardino, focus on the murderous partnership|work=USA Today|date=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jillian Peterson]], an assistant professor of criminology at [[Hamline University]] who is participating in the construction of a database on mass shooters, noted that two phenomena surface repeatedly in the statistics: hopelessness and a need for notoriety in life or in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wanamaker |first=John |date=October 8, 2017|title='This shooter is a little different': Hamline professor studies mass shootings|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/10/08/this-shooter-is-a-little-different-hamline-professor-studies-mass-shootings|work= [[Minnesota Public Radio|MPR]] News |location= |access-date=October 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Notoriety was first suggested as a possible motive and researched by Justin Nutt.  Nutt stated in a 2013 article, "those who feel nameless and as though no one will care or remember them when they are gone may feel doing something such as a school shooting will make sure they are remembered and listed in the history books."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialjusticesolutions.org/2013/12/14/school-shootings-possible-causes/|title=School Shootings and Possible Causes|date=14 December 2013|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In considering the frequency of mass shootings in the United States, criminologist Peter Squires says that the individualistic culture in the United States puts the country at greater risk for mass shootings than other countries, noting that "many other countries where gun ownership is high, such as Norway, Finland, Switzerland and Israel . . . tend to have more tight-knit societies where a strong social bond supports people through crises, and mass killings are fewer." He is an advocate of gun control, but contends there is more to mass shootings than the prevalence of guns.&lt;ref name=europe&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dorell|first1=Oren|title=In Europe, fewer mass killings due to culture not guns|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2012/12/17/guns-mass-killings-worldwide/1776191/|publisher=USA Today|date=December 18, 2012|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social science and family structure==

According to Michael Cook and Carolyn Moynihan of Mercatornet,&lt;ref name="mercatornet.com"&gt;https://www.mercatornet.com/features/articles/21046/&lt;/ref&gt; an angle that is missed by mainstream media is the findings of important social scientists such as eminent Harvard sociologist [[Robert J. Sampson]] who wrote: “Family structure is one of the strongest, if not the strongest, predictor of variations in urban violence across cities in the United States. The close empirical connection between family breakdown and crime suggests that increased spending on crime-fighting, imprisonment, and criminal justice in the United States over the last 40 years is largely the direct or indirect consequence of marital breakdown.” His views are echoed by the eminent criminologists [[Michael Gottfredson]] and [[Travis Hirschi]], who have written that “such family measures as the percentage of the population divorced, the percentage of households headed by women, and the percentage of unattached individuals in the community are among the most powerful predictors of crime rates.”&lt;ref name="aei.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/publication/sons-of-divorce-school-shooters/|title=Sons of divorce, school shooters|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the research of another social scientist who was himself raised by a single mother, Bradford Wilcox, "boys living in single mother homes are almost twice as likely to end up delinquent compared to boys who enjoy good relationships with their father."&lt;ref name="aei.org"/&gt;

Moynihan said that "almost all school shooters come from families where the parents are either divorced or alienated",&lt;ref name="mercatornet.com"/&gt; and Cook argued that "perhaps they wouldn’t need more gun control if they had better divorce control.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mercatornet.com/features/view/an-act-of-pure-evil/20506|title=MercatorNet: ‘An act of pure evil’|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses==

===Media===
{{sect-stub|date=November 2017}}
Some people have considered whether media attention revolving around the perpetrators of mass shootings is a factor in sparking further incidents.&lt;ref name=birch&gt;{{cite web|last1=Birch|first1=Jenna|title=Does Media Coverage After a Mass Shooting Do More Harm Than Good?|url=https://www.yahoo.com/health/does-media-coverage-after-a-mass-shooting-do-more-125177743017.html|publisher=Yahoo! News|date=July 27, 2015|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, some in law enforcement have decided against naming mass shooting suspects in media-related events to avoid giving them notoriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elinson|first1=Zusha|last2=Lazo|first2=Alejandro|title=More Police Decide Against Naming Mass-Shooting Suspects|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-police-decide-against-naming-mass-shooting-suspects-1443985970|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=October 4, 2015|accessdate=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of messages used in the coverage of mass shootings has been studied. Researchers studied the role the coverage plays in shaping attitudes toward persons with serious mental illness and public support for [[gun control]] policies.&lt;ref name=emma&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=McGinty|first1=Emma|title=Effects of News Media Messages About Mass Shootings on Attitudes Toward Persons With Serious Mental Illness and Public Support for Gun Control Policies|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=170|issue=5|pages=494–501|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13010014|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|accessdate=11 August 2015|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13010014|pmid=23511486|date=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a paper written by a physicist and statistician, [[Sherry Towers]], along with four colleagues was published, which proved that there is indeed mass shooting contagion using [[mathematical modeling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Towers|first1=Sherry|last2=Gomez-Lievano|first2=Andres|last3=Khan|first3=Maryam|last4=Mubayi|first4=Anuj|last5=Castillo-Chavez|first5=Carlos|date=2 July 2015|editor-last=Yukich|editor-first=Joshua|editor-link=Joshua Yukich|title=Contagion in Mass Killings and School Shootings|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0117259|access-date=17 June 2018|journal=[[PLOS ONE]]|publisher=[[Public Library of Science]]|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0117259|layurl=https://www.livescience.com/51429-mass-shootings-are-contagious.html|laysource=Live Science|laydate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However in 2017 Towers said in an interview that she prefers [[Industry self-regulation|self-regulation]] to [[censorship]] to address this issue, just like years ago major news outlets successfully prevent [[copycat suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Towers |first=Sherry |interviewer= John Hook|title= Newsmaker Sunday: Sherry Towers|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sQKZcpolAY |publisher=[[Fox 10 Phoenix]] |location=Phoenix, Arizona, United States |date=6 December 2017|work=Newsmaker Sunday |access-date=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the [[American Psychological Association]] published a [[press release]], claiming that mass shooting contagion does exist and news media and social media enthusiasts should withhold the name(s) and face(s) of the victimizer(s) when reporting a mass shooting to deny the fame the shooter(s) want to curb contagion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last= Johnston|first= Jennifer|authorlink=Jennifer Johnston|date= 4 August 2016|title= "Media Contagion" Is Factor in Mass Shootings, Study Says|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2016/08/media-contagion.aspx |location= |publisher= American Psychological Association |access-date=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some news media have weighed in on the gun control debate. After the [[2015 San Bernardino attack]], the ''[[New York Daily News]]''{{'}} front-page headline, "God isn't fixing this", was accompanied by "images of tweets from leading Republicans who shared their [[thoughts and prayers|'thoughts' and 'prayers']] for the shooting victims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/daily-news-cover-san-bernardino-shooting-2015-12|title=Hard-hitting Daily News cover blasts Republicans for offering only 'prayers' after latest shooting|author=Colin Campbell|publisher=Business Insider|date=December 2, 2015|accessdate=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Marina|last=Fang|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-daily-news-cover_565fa492e4b08e945fee15ce|title=New York Daily News Skewers Politicians Refusing to Act on Gun Violence: 'God Isn't Fixing This'|work=Huffington Post|date=December 2, 2015|accessdate=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[2014 Isla Vista killings]], satirical news website ''[[The Onion]]'' has republished the story "'No Way To Prevent This', Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens" with minor edits after major mass shootings, to satirise the popular consensus that there is a lack of political power in the United States to prevent mass shootings.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/10/03/why-this-onion-article-goes-viral-after-every-mass-shooting/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gun law reform===
{{See also|Overview of gun laws by nation}}
Responses to mass shootings take a variety of forms, depending on the country and political climate.

====Australia====
After the 1996 [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur massacre]] in [[Australia]], the government changed [[Gun laws in Australia#The Port Arthur massacre and its consequences|gun laws in Australia]]. As in the United States, figures vary according to the definition of "mass shooting"; a 2006 paper used a definition "one in which ⩾5 firearm‐related homicides are committed by one or two perpetrators in proximate events in a civilian setting, not counting any perpetrators",&lt;ref name=PMC/&gt; compared to the usual U.S. definition of an indiscriminate rampage in public places resulting in four or more victims killed. Between 1981 and the passing of the law in 1996 there were 13 mass shootings with five or more deaths; in the following decade, while the new law was in place, there were no such mass shootings.&lt;ref name=PMC/&gt; Overall gun deaths have continued to decline for two decades since the law was passed,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dewan|first1=Angela|last2=Tarabay|first2=Jamie|title=What the UK and Australia did differently after mass shootings|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/04/world/gun-control-uk-australia/index.html|accessdate=31 January 2018|publisher=CNN|date=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, however there have been several shootings with three or more deaths since 1996 where the victims were related to the shooter.

There were five significant shootings, though not meeting the "mass shooting" definition of the 2006 paper, between 1996 {{As of|2016|6|alt=and June 2018}}:
* the [[Monash University shooting]] in 2002 in which Huan Yun Xiang shot and killed two and injured five
* the [[2011 Hectorville siege|Hectorville Siege]] in 2011 where 39-year-old man Donato Anthony Corbo shot four people on a neighbouring property (three of whom died), and also wounded two police officers, before being arrested by Special Operations police after an eight-hour siege
* the Logan family shooting in 2014 of a neighbour family (Greg Holmes, 48, his mother Mary Lockhart, 75, and her husband Peter Lockhart, 78) by Ian Francis Jamieson
* the Hunt family murders, in October 2014 when Geoff Hunt murdered four relatives before killing himself
* The Osmington shooting in May 2018, involving the death of 7 when a grandfather shot and killed his four grandchildren, his daughter, his wife and then himself.

====United Kingdom====
As a result of the 1987 [[Hungerford massacre]] and 1996 [[Dunblane school massacre]] mass shootings, the [[United Kingdom]] enacted tough gun laws and a buyback program to remove guns from private ownership.&lt;ref name=hart&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hartmann|first1=Margaret|title=How Australia and Britain Tackled Gun Violence|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/10/how-australia-and-britain-tackled-gun-violence.html#|publisher=Daily Intelligencer|date=October 2, 2015|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been two mass shootings since the laws were restricted, the [[Cumbria shootings]] in 2010 which killed 13 people&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and the [[Moss Side mass shooting]] in 2018, in which no-one was killed.

====United States====
{{See also|Gun law in the United States|Gun laws in the United States by state|Gun politics in the United States}}
In the [[United States]], support for gun law reform [[gun politics in the United States|varies considerably by political party]], with Democrats generally more supportive and Republicans generally more opposed. Some in the U.S. believe that tightening gun laws would prevent future mass shootings.&lt;ref name=progress&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Sam|title=One Change To Our Gun Laws That Could Have Prevented The Last Mass Shooting|url=http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/07/28/3685169/gun-laws-mental-health-lafayette/|publisher=Think Progress|date=July 28, 2015|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some politicians in the U.S. introduced legislation to reform the background check system for purchasing a gun.&lt;ref name=ali&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weinberg|first1=Ali|title=These 6 Stalled Bills Aimed at Mass Shootings Like Umpqua Flounder in Congress|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/stalled-bills-aimed-mass-shootings-umpqua-flounder-congress/story?id=34208798|publisher=ABC News|date=October 2, 2015|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A vast majority of Americans support tighter background checks. "According to a poll [Made by CNN] by Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, 93 percent of registered voters said they would support universal background checks for all gun buyers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2015/10/americans-support-universal-background-checks|title=An Overwhelming Majority of Americans Still Support Universal Background Checks|work=Mother Jones|date=October 1, 2015|accessdate=December 16, 2015|first=Becca|last=Andrews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others contend that mass shootings should not be the main focus in the gun law reform debate because these shootings account for less than one percent of the U.S. homicide rate and believe that these shootings are hard to stop. They often argue that civilians with concealed guns will be able to stop shootings.&lt;ref name=volokh&gt;{{cite web|last1=Volokh|first1=Eugene|title=Do civilians with guns ever stop mass shootings?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/10/03/do-civilians-with-guns-ever-stop-mass-shootings/|publisher=Washington Post|date=October 3, 2015|accessdate=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gun control policies may cause a lot of controversy due to divided opinions on who should be able to carry a weapon.  An opinion survey was conducted by the firm GfK Knowledge Networks to differentiate between the different attitudes towards gun control. There was a gun policy survey and a mental illness survey. Studies showed that over 85% of those questioned supported national background checks into the mental health records of citizens attempting to purchase a gun. More than 50% of people felt that those suffering with mental health issues were more deviant and threatening than those who had good mental health. The study also proved that there is large interest in contributing to mental health awareness as well as simply prohibiting those suffering from purchasing guns. Nearly two thirds of respondents supported greater government spending on mental health, with more than 60% of people believing this would reduce gun violence in the USA. (Colleen L. Barry, 2013)

===Leaders===
As of June 2016, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] had spoken in the aftermath of fourteen mass shootings during his nearly eight-year presidency, repeatedly calling for more gun safety laws in the United States.&lt;ref name=korte&gt;{{cite web|last1=Korte|first1=Gregory|title=11 mass shootings, 11 speeches: How Obama has responded|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/02/11-mass-shootings-11-speeches-how-obama-has-responded/73177526/|publisher=USA Today|date=October 2, 2015|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Charleston church shooting]], U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] said, "At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn't happen in other places with this kind of frequency."&lt;ref name=benen&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benen|first1=Steve|title=Comparing U.S. mass shootings to the rest of the world|url=http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/comparing-us-mass-shootings-the-rest-the-world|publisher=MSNBC|date=June 23, 2015|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the December [[2015 San Bernardino attack]], Obama renewed his call for reforming gun-safety laws and also said that the frequency of mass shootings in the United States has "no parallel in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/obama-san-bernardino-shooting-2015-12|title=OBAMA: 'We have a pattern now of mass shootings ... that has no parallel'|work=Business Insider|date=December 2, 2015|accessdate=December 16, 2015|first=Maxwell|last=Tani}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the February 2018 attack at Florida's [[Parkland school shooting]] at [[Stoneman Douglas High School]], the school's student survivors, teachers, and parents became strong leaders in the effort to ban [[assault weapon]] sales and easy accessibility to [[military weapons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Witt|first1=Emily|title=How the Survivors of Parkland Began the Never Again Movement|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-survivors-of-parkland-began-the-never-again-movement?CNDID=30462369&amp;spMailingID=12971483&amp;spUserID=MTMzMTgzMTA1MjA0S0&amp;spJobID=1341843325&amp;spReportId=MTM0MTg0MzMyNQS2|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=20 February 2018|language=en|date=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael John Denton''' (born 25 August 1943) is a [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[Australian]] author and biochemist. He is a Senior Fellow at the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture. Denton’s most prominent book, ''[[Evolution: A Theory in Crisis]]'', inspired [[intelligent design]] proponents Phillip Johnson and Michael Behe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.discovery.org/p/521&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Denton gained a medical degree from [[Bristol University]] in 1969 and a [[PhD]] in biochemistry from [[King's College London]] in 1974. He was a senior research fellow in the Biochemistry Department at the [[University of Otago]], [[Dunedin]], [[New Zealand]] from 1990 to 2005. He later became a scientific researcher in the field of genetic eye diseases. He has spoken worldwide on [[genetics]], [[evolution]] and the anthropic argument for design. Denton's current interests include defending the "anti-Darwinian evolutionary position" and the design hypothesis formulated in his book ''Nature’s Destiny''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaeljdenton.com/?p=5 Background of Denton and his scientific work] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304125001/http://www.michaeljdenton.com/?p=5 |date=March 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Denton describes himself as an [[agnostic]].&lt;ref name=Agnostic1&gt;{{cite book|title=Signature in the Cell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=laW5vuTLNXEC&amp;pg=PA556 |author=Stephen C.

==Books==

===''Evolution: A Theory in Crisis''===
{{See also|Evolution: A Theory in Crisis}}

In 1985 Denton wrote the book ''Evolution: A Theory in Crisis'', presenting a systematic critique of [[neo-Darwinism]] ranging from [[paleontology]], [[fossils]], [[homology (biology)|homology]], [[molecular biology]], [[genetics]] and [[biochemistry]], and argued that evidence of design exists in nature.
Some of book reviews criticized his arguments.&lt;ref&gt;Mark I. Vuletic. [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/denton.html "Review of Michael Denton's Evolution: A Theory in Crisis"], The Talk Origins Archive&lt;/ref&gt; He describes himself as an [[evolutionist]] and he has rejected biblical [[creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NKZeO1H9fh8C&amp;pg=PA155&amp;dq=michael+denton+evolutionist&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mcrNTYLQCoyu8QP_8Nj9DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CFsQuwUwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=michael%20denton%20evolutionist "Profile in Evolution and creationism in the public schools by Angus Macleod Gunn"]&lt;/ref&gt; The book influenced both [[Phillip E. Johnson]], the father of intelligent design, Michael Behe, a proponent of irreducible complexity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intelligent Design Video: 'Unlocking the Mystery of Life'|url=http://evomech1.blogspot.com/2007/01/intelligent-design-video-unlocking.html|website=Evolution Research - General Evolution News|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Gilder]], co-founder of the [[Discovery Institute]], the hub of the [[intelligent design movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Forrest and Gross(2004) pp 17, 259&lt;/ref&gt;  Since writing the book Denton has changed many of his views on evolution, however he still believes that the existence of life is a matter of design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaeljdenton.com/?p=1 My Biological World View] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529165507/http://www.michaeljdenton.com/?p=1 |date=May 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Nature's Destiny''===
Denton still accepts design and embraces a non-Darwinian evolutionary theory. He denies that randomness accounts for the [[biology]] of [[organisms]]; he has proposed an evolutionary theory which is a "directed evolution" in his book ''Nature's Destiny'' (1998).  Life, according to Denton, did not exist until the initial conditions of the universe were fine-tuned (see [[Fine-tuned Universe]]).&lt;ref&gt;Allene Phy-Olsen, Evolution, Creationism, and Intelligent Design, 2010, p.72&lt;/ref&gt; Denton was influenced by [[Lawrence Joseph Henderson]] (1878-1942), [[Paul Davies]] and [[John D. Barrow]] who argued for an [[anthropic principle]] in the cosmos (Denton 1998, v, Denton 2005). His second book ''Nature's Destiny'' (1998)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/camp.html 29+ Evidences for Macroevolution: A Response to Ashby Camp's "Critique"], [[Talk.Origins]] "Interestingly, it appears that Denton has finally rectified his misunderstanding about nested hierarchies and common descent, since in his latest book he unconditionally assumes the validity of the nested hierarchy, common descent, and the tree of life."&lt;/ref&gt; is his biological contribution to the anthropic principle debate, dominated by physicists. He argues for a law-like evolutionary unfolding of life.&lt;ref&gt;"[T]he second argument, developed in Part 2, that the cosmos is fit also for the evolutionary development of life" (p. xiv). See also especially chapter 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peraldus Knight.jpg|thumb|An early example of the ''miles christianus'' allegory in a manuscript of the ''Summa Vitiorum'' by [[William Peraldus]], mid 13th century. The knight is equipped with a detailed [[Armour of God]], including an early depiction of the [[Shield of the Trinity]], and he is crowned by an angel holding the gloss ''non coronabuntur nisi qui legitime certaverint'' "none will be crowned but those who truly [[:wikt:certo#Latin|struggle]]" and in the other hand a list of the seven [[beatitudes]], matched with the [[seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]] and the [[seven heavenly virtues]] which in turn are set against the [[seven cardinal vices]].]]
[[File:Ghent Altarpiece E - Knights of Christ.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Christi milites''  to the left of the "Adoration of the Mystic Lamb" in the [[Ghent Altarpiece]] (c. 1430)]]

The '''''miles Christianus''''' ([[Christian]] soldier) or "'''''miles Christi'''''" (soldier of [[Jesus in Christianity|Christ]]) is a Christian [[allegory]] based on [[New Testament military metaphors]], especially the [[Armor of God]] metaphor of military equipment standing for Christian virtues &lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ephesians|6:14-17|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on certain passages of the Old Testament from the [[Latin Vulgate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Job|7:1|4}} ([[Vulgate]]): ''Militia est vita hominis super terram''...&lt;/ref&gt;

By the fifth century, the Church had started to develop doctrines that allowed for Christian participation in battle, though this was limited by a requirement that the fighting must be undertaken to convert [[infidel]]s or spread the [[Christ in Majesty|glory of Christ]]. Christians were not to fight for conquest or personal glory.&lt;ref name=ideal&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 1449-9320| volume = 8| issue = Journal Article| pages = 77–| last = Iwanczak| first = Wojciech| title = Miles Christi: the medieval ideal of knighthood| journal = Journal of the Australian Early Medieval Association| date = 2012| url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=GPS&amp;sw=w&amp;u=wikipedia&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA454359740&amp;asid=b7bcab1e0aab147ff62b696318501ae7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts of ''miles Christi'' and ''militia Christi'' can be traced back to the first century AD.&lt;ref name=ideal/&gt; The phrase ''miles Christi'', derived from a letter from [[Paul the Apostle]] and much employed by [[Pope Gregory VII]], also appeared in the ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'' in reference to the young [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Prince Tancred]], [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond]], [[Godfrey of Bouillon|Godfrey]] and [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse|Count Raymond of Toulouse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HQEM2MzGP58C&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |last=Kostick |first=Conor |year=2008 |title=The Social Structure of the First Crusade |location=Leiden, Netherlands |publisher=Koninklijnke Brill NV |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; each of whom were Christian leaders in the [[First Crusade]].

The metaphor has its origins in early Christianity of the Roman Empire, and gave rise to the contrasting term ''[[pagan]]us'' (hitherto used in the sense of "civilian", "one lacking discipline") for its opposite, i.e. one who was not a soldier of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Weekley, ''Etymological Dictionary of English'', s.v. "pagan".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chivalry]] as the idealized image of [[knighthood]] was a common [[Allegory in the Middle Ages|moral allegory]] in early Christian literature.&lt;ref name=ideal/&gt; Knighthood emerged as a concept during the time of [[Charlemagne]]. During the [[Saxon Wars]], Charlemagne's Christian knights attended mass, surrounded by relics, before battles.&lt;ref name=ideal/&gt;

Fragments from 15th c. Polish chronicler [[Jan Długosz]] describe the [[sanctification]] of weapons and a concept of knighthood that was grounded in religion.&lt;ref name=ideal/&gt; It became a theme in [[medieval art|art]] during the [[High Middle Ages]], with depictions of a [[knight]] with his various pieces of equipment identified with various [[virtue]]s. This parallels the development of the understanding in medieval [[Christendom]] of the armed nobility as defenders of the faith, first emphasized by [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] in the context of the [[Investiture controversy]] and later made even more explicit with the actual military expeditions of the [[crusades]]. 
Depictions of the ''miles christianus'' with the emblematic Armour of God however remained very rare in the medieval period and only became prominent after the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;"depictions of the miles christianus in emblematic armour are extremely rare before the Reformation" (Evans p. 14)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early modern period, the understanding of the term again became more metaphorical, but it survives in various Christian orders or confessions; it is especially pronounced among the [[Jesuits]] and in the [[Salvation Army]], and it is the central theme of the 18th century hymn "[[Soldiers of Christ, Arise]]" and the 19th century hymn "[[Onward, Christian Soldiers]]."

'''Minnie M. Kenny''' (1929–August 17, 2005) was a [[cryptanalyst]], educator and equal opportunity activist who worked at the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). She served as Deputy Commandant at the [[National Cryptologic School]] and was responsible for creating scholarships for NSA employees. The recipient of numerous awards, including the Meritorious and the Exceptional Civilian Service Awards, the presidential Meritorious Executive Award and Distinguished Service Award of the CIA, Kenny was inducted into the [[NSA Hall of Honor|Cryptologic Hall of Honor]] in 2009.

==Biography==
Minnie McNeal was born in 1929 in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Roelofsma|2005}} After graduating from the [[Philadelphia High School for Girls]], she worked for the Philadelphia Commerce Department and the [[United States Census Bureau]] in [[Washington, D. C.]], before being hired in 1951 to work at [[Arlington Hall]] for the [[United States Army Security Agency|Army Security Agency]]. She was part of the first group of [[African Americans]] who were allowed to work upstairs in the Operations Division, out of the basement, and was assigned to the 'U' Street School for training.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=34}} After her training and the change of the organization from military footing to the [[National Security Agency]] in 1952, McNeal was assigned as a communications clerk to the ALLO (All Other (non-Soviet)) linguistics unit.{{sfn|National Security Agency|1/2009}} She was particularly well known for her expertise in cryptanalysis, language and traffic analysis and worked with an elite "think tank" at NSA, to develop programs for [[cryptanalysis]] and language, serving as chair of the agency's Language Panel.{{sfn|National Security Agency|12/2009}} In 1972, McNeal married Herbert Cornelius Kenny, one of the singers of [[The Ink Spots]], with whom she had a daughter Daphne.{{sfn|''The Washington Post''|1992}}

In 1973, Kenny became the founding editor of NSA's Group B journal ''Dragon Seeds'' and pressed for each cryptanalyst to have their own personal computer as a necessary tool.{{sfn|Kenny|1978|p=11}} From 1975 to 1981, she served in the Office of Techniques and Standards of the NSA, as the chief of the language and linguistics.{{sfn|Stokes|1993}} In 1980, she was the recipient of the Meritorious Civilian Service Award.{{sfn|National Security Agency|1/2009}} Beginning in 1982,{{sfn|Stokes|1993}} Kenny served as Deputy Commandant at the National Cryptologic School,{{sfn|National Security Agency|12/2009}} and worked with traditional Black colleges and universities to increase diversity.{{sfn|Roelofsma|2005}} She introduced computer assisted teaching techniques and founded the Computer Assisted Learning and Instruction Consortium (CALICO) to bring professional language teachers and those who use language together in an international association.{{sfn|Stokes|1993}} In 1984, Kenny was awarded a second civilian honor, the Exceptional Civilian Service Award by the NSA and both presidents [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]] awarded her with the Meritorious Executive Award. After a decade working to improve the school, Kenny served on the Department of Defense Congressional Task Force on Women, Minorities, and the Handicapped in Science and Technology and as the NSA Director for Equal Employment Opportunity, before her 1993 retirement. She was a recipient of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s Distinguished Service Award.{{sfn|National Security Agency|1/2009}}

Kenny then served as a Congressional Fellow on the staff of Congressman [[Louis Stokes]] and worked on the drafting of the Underground Railroad Act{{sfn|Roelofsma|2005}} of 1997, which was designed to preserve and protect the history of significant buildings associated with the [[Underground Railroad|historic organization]].{{sfn|Larkin|1997}}

Kenny died August 17, 2005, in [[Columbia, Maryland]], and was buried at St. John's Cemetery in [[Ellicott City, Maryland]].{{sfn|''The Baltimore Sun''|2005}} Posthumously, in 2009, she was inducted into the [[NSA Hall of Honor|Cryptologic Hall of Honor]].

These obligations may be of either a [[natural and legal rights|legal or moral]] character. The notion of positive and negative rights may also be applied to [[liberty rights]].

To take an example involving [[Party (law)|two parties in a court of law]]: Adrian has a ''negative right to x'' against Clay [[if and only if]] Clay is ''prohibited'' from acting upon Adrian in some way regarding ''x''. In contrast, Adrian has a ''positive right to x'' against Clay if and only if Clay is obliged to act upon Adrian in some way regarding ''x''. A case in point, if Adrian has a ''negative right to life'' against Clay, then Clay is required to refrain from killing Adrian; while if Adrian has a ''positive right to life'' against Clay, then Clay is required to act as necessary to preserve the life of Adrian.

Rights considered ''negative rights'' may include [[civil and political rights]] such as [[freedom of speech]], life, [[property (ownership right)|private property]], freedom from [[violent crime]], [[freedom of religion]], ''[[habeas corpus]]'', a [[fair trial]], and freedom from [[slavery]].

Rights considered ''positive rights'', as initially proposed in 1979 by the Czech jurist [[Karel Vasak]], may include other civil and political rights such as [[police]] protection of person and property and the [[right to counsel]], as well as [[economic, social and cultural rights]] such as [[right to food|food]], [[right to housing|housing]], [[public education]], [[employment]], [[national security]], [[military]], [[right to health|health care]], [[social security]], [[right to internet access|internet access]], and a minimum [[right to an adequate standard of living|standard of living]]. In the [[three generations of human rights|"three generations"]] account of human rights, negative rights are often associated with the first generation of rights, while positive rights are associated with the second and third generations.

Some philosophers (see criticisms) disagree that the negative-positive rights distinction is useful or valid.

==Overview==
Under the theory of positive and negative rights, a negative right is a right ''not to be'' subjected to an action of another person or group—a government, for example—usually in the form of abuse or [[coercion]].  As such, negative rights exist unless someone acts to ''negate'' them. A positive right is a right ''to be'' subjected to an action of another person or group.  In other words, for a positive right to be exercised, someone else's actions must be ''added'' to the equation. In theory, a negative right forbids others from acting against the right holder, while a positive right obligates others to act with respect to the right holder. In the framework of the [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] [[categorical imperative]], negative rights can be associated with [[Categorical imperative#Perfect duty|perfect duties]] while positive rights can be connected to [[Categorical imperative#Imperfect duty|imperfect duties]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Belief in a distinction between positive and negative rights is usually maintained, or emphasized, by [[libertarianism|libertarian]]s, who believe that positive rights do not exist until they are created by contract. The [[United Nations]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] lists both positive and negative rights (but does not identify them as such). The constitutions of most [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] guarantee negative rights, but not all include positive rights. Nevertheless, positive rights are often guaranteed by other laws, and the majority of liberal democracies provide their citizens with publicly funded education, health care, social security and [[unemployment benefit]]s.

==When they conflict==

{{Refimprove|date=October 2008}}

Rights are often spoken of as [[natural rights|inalienable]] and sometimes even [[moral absolutism|absolute]]. However, in practice this is often taken as [[graded absolutism]]; rights are ranked by degree of importance, and violations of lesser ones are accepted in the course of preventing violations of greater ones. Thus, even if the right not to be killed is inalienable, the corresponding obligation on others to refrain from killing is generally understood to have at least one exception: [[right of self-defense|self-defense]]. Certain widely accepted negative obligations (such as the obligations to refrain from theft, murder, etc.) are often considered [[prima facie]], meaning that the legitimacy of the obligation is accepted "on its face"; but even if not questioned, such obligations may still be ranked for ethical analysis.

Thus a thief may have a negative obligation not to steal, and a [[police officer]] may have a negative obligation not to tackle people&amp;mdash;but a police officer tackling the thief easily meets the [[legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] that he acted justifiably, since his was a breach of a lesser obligation and negated the breach of a greater obligation. Likewise a shopkeeper or other passerby may also meet this burden of proof when tackling the thief. But if any of those individuals pulled a gun and shot the (unarmed) thief for stealing, most modern societies would not accept that the burden of proof had been met. The obligation not to kill&amp;mdash;being universally regarded as one of the highest, if not the highest obligation&amp;mdash;is so much greater than the obligation not to steal that a breach of the latter does not justify a breach of the former. Most modern societies insist that other, very serious ethical questions need come into play before stealing could justify killing.

Positive obligations confer duty. But as we see with the police officer, exercising a duty may violate negative obligations (e.g. not to overreact and kill). For this reason, in ethics positive obligations are almost never considered ''[[prima facie]]''. The greatest negative obligation may have just one exception&amp;mdash;one higher obligation of self-defense&amp;mdash;but even the greatest positive obligations generally require more complex ethical analysis. For example, one could easily justify failing to help, not just one, but a great many injured children quite ethically in the case of [[triage]] after a disaster. This consideration has led ethicists to agree in a general way that positive obligations are usually junior to negative obligations because they are not reliably ''prima facie''. Some critics of positive rights implicitly suggest that because positive obligations are not reliably ''prima facie'' they must always be agreed to through contract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html "Individual rights"], ''Ayn Rand Lexicon''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteenth-century philosopher [[Frédéric Bastiat]] summarized the conflict between these negative and positive rights by saying:
{{quote|M. de Lamartine wrote me one day: "Your doctrine is only the half of my program; you have stopped at liberty; I go on to fraternity." I answered him: "The second half of your program will destroy the first half." And, in fact, it is quite impossible for me to separate the word "fraternity" from the word "voluntary." It is quite impossible for me to conceive of fraternity as legally enforced, without liberty being legally destroyed, and justice being legally trampled underfoot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

According to [[Jan Narveson]], the view of some that there is no distinction between negative and positive rights on the ground that negative rights require police and courts for their enforcement is "mistaken". He says that the question between what one has a right to do and who if anybody enforces it are separate issues. If rights are only negative then it simply means no one has a duty to enforce them, although individuals have a right to use any non-forcible means to gain the cooperation of others in protecting those rights. Therefore, he says "the distinction between negative and positive is quite robust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan Narveson - Libertarianism: A Philosophical Introduction|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210122955/http://www.againstpolitics.com/libertarianism/index.html|url=http://www.againstpolitics.com/libertarianism/index.html|author=Narveson, Jan|work=Against Politics|archivedate=February 10, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Libertarians]] hold that positive rights, which would include a right to be protected, do not exist until they are created by contract. However, those who hold this view do not mean that police, for example, are not obligated to protect the rights of citizens. Since they contract with their employers to defend citizens from violence, then they have created that obligation to their employer. A negative right to life allows an individual to defend his life from others trying to kill him, or obtain voluntary assistance from others to defend his life&amp;mdash;but he may not force others to defend him, because he has no natural right to be provided with defense. To force a person to defend one's own negative rights, or the negative rights of a third party, would be to violate that person's negative rights.

Other advocates of the view that there is a distinction between negative and positive rights argue that the presence of a police force or army is not due to any positive right to these services that citizens claim, but rather because they are [[natural monopolies]] or [[public goods]]&amp;mdash;features of any human society that arise naturally, even while adhering to the concept of negative rights only. [[Robert Nozick]] discusses this idea at length in his book ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]''.{{ref|nozick}}

===In medicine===
In the field of [[medicine]], positive rights of [[patient]]s often conflict with negative rights of [[physician]]s.  In controversial areas such as [[abortion]] and [[assisted suicide]], medical professionals may not wish to offer certain services for moral or philosophical reasons. If enough practitioners opt out as a result of conscience, a right granted by [[conscience clause]] statutes in many jurisdictions, patients may not have any means of having their own positive rights fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/do-we-need-a-pro-choice-l_b_178456.html|title=Do We Need a Pro-Choice Litmus Test for Obstetricians?|last=Appel|first=Jacob M.|website=[[Huffington Post]]|date=24 April 2009|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the case of [[Janet Murdock]], a Montana woman who could not find any physician to assist her suicide in 2009.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/big-sky-dilemma-must-doct_b_275034.html|title=Big Sky Dilemma: Must Doctors Help Their Patients Die?|last=Appel|first=Jacob M.|website=[[Huffington Post]]|date=18 October 2009|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This controversy over positive and negative rights in medicine has become a focal point in the ongoing public debate between conservative ethicist [[Wesley J. Smith]] and bioethicist [[Jacob M. Appel]].&lt;ref name="firstthings.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Wesley J.|url=http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/secondhandsmoke/2009/09/03/right-to-die-means-a-physician-duty-to-kill/|title=The 'Right to Die' Means a Physician Duty to Kill?|date=3 September 2009|website=First Things|accessdate=9 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In discussing ''[[Baxter v. Montana]]'', Appel has written:
{{quote|Medical licenses are a limited commodity, reflecting an artificial shortage created by a partnership between Congress and organizations representing physicians&amp;mdash;with medical school seats and residency positions effectively allotted by the government, much like radio frequencies. Physicians benefit from this arrangement in that a smaller number of physicians inevitably leads to increased rates of reimbursement. There's nothing inherently wrong with this arrangement. However, it belies any claim that doctors should have the same right to choose their customers as barbers or babysitters. Much as the government has been willing to impose duties on radio stations (e.g., indecency codes, equal time rules) that would be impermissible if applied to newspapers, Montana might reasonably consider requiring physicians, in return for the privilege of a medical license, to prescribe medication to the dying without regard to the patient's intent.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;}}

Smith replies that this is "taking the duty to die and transforming it into a duty to kill", which he argues "reflects a profound misunderstanding of the government’s role".&lt;ref name="firstthings.com"/&gt;

==Criticisms==
[[File:Aid Pakistan Truck.jpeg|thumb|right|180px|A right to adequate nutrition requires duties to avoid stealing, but also duties to act in ways that protect or repair the delivery of the supplies. The right cannot be fully guaranteed by only positive, or else only negative duties; it needs both.]]
Presumably, if a person has positive rights it implies that other people have positive duties (to take certain actions); whereas negative rights imply that others have negative duties (to avoid certain other actions). Philosopher [[Henry Shue]] is skeptical; he believes that all rights (regardless of whether they seem more "negative" or "positive") requires both kinds of duties at once. In other words, Shue says that honouring a right will require avoidance (a "negative" duty) but also protective or reparative actions ("positive" duties). The negative positive distinction may be a matter of emphasis; it is therefore unhelpful to describe ''any right'' as though it requires only one of the two types of duties.&lt;ref name=ShueRights/&gt;

To Shue, rights can always be understood as confronting "standard threats" against humanity. Dealing with standard threats requires all kinds of duties, which may be divided across time (e.g. "if avoiding the harmful behaviour fails, begin to repair the damages"), but also divided across people. The point is that every right provokes all 3 types of behaviour (avoidance, protection, repair) to some degree. Dealing with a threat like murder, for instance, will require one individual to practice avoidance (e.g. the potential murderer must stay calm), others to protect (e.g. the police officer, who must stop the attack, or the bystander, who may be obligated to call the police), and others to repair (e.g. the doctor who must resuscitate a person who has been attacked). Thus, even the negative right not to be killed can only be guaranteed with the help of some positive duties. Shue goes further, and maintains that the negative and positive rights distinction can be harmful, because it may result in the neglect of necessary duties.&lt;ref name=ShueRights&gt;Shue, Henry (1980). Chapters 1-2 of ''[[Basic Rights: Subsistence, Affluence, and U.S. Foreign Policy]]''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

James P. Sterba makes similar criticisms. He holds that any right can be made to appear either positive or negative depending on the language used to define it. He writes:
{{quote|What is at stake is the liberty of the poor not to be interfered with in ''taking from the surplus possessions of the rich'' what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs. Needless to say, libertarians would want to deny that the poor have this liberty. But how could they justify such a denial? As this liberty of the poor has been specified, it is not a positive right to receive something, but a negative right of non-interference.(emphasis added){{ref|sterba}}}}
Sterba has rephrased the traditional "positive right" to provisions, and put it in the form of a sort of "negative right" ''not to be prevented'' from taking the resources on their own.. Thus, all rights may not only require both "positive" and "negative" duties, but it seems that rights that do not involve forced labor can be phrased positively or negatively at will.{{ref|sterba}} The distinction between positive and negative may not be very useful, or justified, as rights requiring the provision of labor can be rephrased from "[[right to education]]" or "[[right to health|right to health care]]" to "right to take surplus money to pay teachers" or "right to take surplus money to pay doctors".

'''Organizational behavior''' ('''OB''') or '''organisational behaviour''' is "the study of [[human behavior]] in organizational settings, the interface between human behavior and the organization, and the organization itself".&lt;ref name = "Moorhead"&gt;Moorhead, G., &amp; Griffin, R. W. (1995). ''Organizational behavior: Managing people and organizations'' (5th edition). Boston. Houghton Mifflin, (p.4)&lt;/ref&gt; OB research can be categorized{{by whom?|date=October 2017}} in at least three ways, including the study of:&lt;ref&gt; Management which is the process of stated Objectives, Planning, Organizing, Directing, Controlling, and Staffing to achieve stated (formalized) objectives.

&lt;/ref&gt;

* work groups (meso-level)
* how organizations behave (macro-level)

==Overview==
[[Chester Barnard]] recognized that individuals behave differently when acting in their organizational role than when acting separately from the organization.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938 /&gt; Organizational behavior researchers study the behavior of individuals primarily in their organizational roles. One of the main goals of organizational behavior is "to revitalize organizational theory and develop a better conceptualization of organizational life".&lt;ref&gt;Simms, L.M., Price, S.A., &amp; Ervin, N.E. (1994). ''The professional practice of nursing administration''. Albany, NY: Delmar Publishers. (p. 121)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to industrial and organizational psychology==

Miner (2006) mentioned that "there is a certain arbitrariness" in identifying a "point at which organizational behavior became established as a distinct discipline" (p.&amp;nbsp;56), suggesting that it could have emerged in the 1940s or 1950s.&lt;ref name = "Miner"&gt;Miner, J.B. (2006). ''Organizational behavior, Vol. 3: Historical origins, theoretical foundations, and the future''. Armonk, NY and London: M.E. Sharpe.&lt;/ref&gt; He also underlined the fact that the industrial psychology division of the American Psychological Association did not add "organizational" to its name until 1970, "long after organizational behavior had clearly come into existence" (p.&amp;nbsp;56), noting that a similar situation arose in sociology. Although there are similarities and differences between the two disciplines, there is still confusion around differentiating organizational behavior and organizational psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Jex, S. &amp; Britt, T. (2008). ''Organizational psychology: A scientist-practitioner approach. 2nd ed''. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

As a multi-disciplinary , organizational behavior has been influenced by developments in a number of related disciplines including: [[Sociology]], [[industrial/organizational psychology]], and [[economics]].

The [[Industrial Revolution]] is a period from the 1760s where new technologies resulted in the adoption of new manufacturing techniques and increased mechanization. In his famous [[iron cage]] metaphor, [[Max Weber]] raised concerns over the reduction in religious and vocational work experiences. Weber claimed that the Industrial Revolution's focus on efficiency constrained the worker to a kind of "prison" and "stripped a worker of their individuality".&lt;ref&gt;Weber, M. (1993). ''The Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism'' (T. Parsons, Trans.). London, England: Routledge. (Original work published 1904–1905)&lt;/ref&gt; The significant social and cultural changes caused by the Industrial Revolution also gave rise to new forms of organization. Weber analyzed one of these organizations and came to the conclusion that bureaucracy was "an organization that rested on [[rational-legal]] principles and maximized technical efficiency."&lt;ref name="Weber1947"&gt;[[Weber, Max]]. The Theory of Social and Economic Organization. Translated by A.M. Henderson and Talcott Parsons. London: Collier Macmillan Publishers, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of OB practitioners documented their ideas about management and organisation. The best known theories today originate from [[Henri Fayol]], [[Chester Barnard]], and [[Mary Parker Follet]]. All three of them drew from their experience to develop a model of effective organizational management, and each of their theories independently shared a focus on human behavior and motivation.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938&gt;{{cite book |title= The Functions of the Executive |last= Barnard |first= Chester I. |authorlink= Chester Barnard |year= 1938 |publisher= Harvard University Press |location= Cambridge, MA |oclc= 555075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fayol1917 &gt;{{citation | last=Fayol | first=Henri | year=1917 | title=Administration industrielle et générale; prévoyance, organisation, commandement, coordination, controle | publisher =Paris, H.

Taylor advocated for maximizing task efficiency through the scientific method.&lt;ref name="Taylor1911"&gt;{{Citation | last = Taylor | first = Frederick Winslow | authorlink = Frederick Winslow Taylor | year = 1911 | title = The Principles of Scientific Management | publisher = Harper &amp; Brothers | location = New York, NY, USA and London, UK | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HoJMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;f=false | oclc = 233134 | doi =   | ref = harv | postscript =. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6435 Also available from Project Gutenberg].'' | lccn = 11010339}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific method was further refined by [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|Lillian]] and [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr.|Frank Gilbreth]], who utilized [[time and motion study]] to further improve worker efficiency.&lt;ref name="price1989"&gt;Price, B 1989, ‘Frank and Lillian Gilbreth and the Manufacture and Marketing of Motion Study, 1908-1924’, Business and Economic History, vol. 18, no. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century the idea of [[Fordism]] emerged. Named after automobile mogul [[Henry Ford]], the method relied on the standardization of production through the use of assembly lines. This allowed unskilled workers to produce complex products efficiently. Sorenson later clarified that Fordism developed independently of Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, C. E. (1956). ''My forty years with Ford''. New York, NY: Collier Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Fordism can be explained as the application of bureaucratic and scientific management principles to whole manufacturing process. The success of the scientific method and Fordism resulted in the widespread adoption of these methods.

In the 1920s, the [[Hawthorne Works]] [[Western Electric]] factory commissioned the first of what was to become known as the [[Hawthorne Studies]]. These studies initially adhered to the traditional scientific method, but also investigated whether workers would be more productive with higher or lower lighting levels. The results showed that regardless of lighting levels, when workers were being studied, productivity increased, but when the studies ended, worker productivity would return to normal. In following experiments, [[Elton Mayo]] concluded that [[job performance]] and the so-called [[Hawthorne Effect]] was strongly correlated to social relationships and job content.&lt;ref name = "Cullen"&gt;Cullen, David O'Donald. ''A new way of statecraft: The career of Elton Mayo and the development of the social sciences in America, 1920–1940.'' ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; 1992; ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Full Text.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Hawthorne Studies [[motivation]] became a focal point in the OB community. A range of theories emerged in the 1950s and 1960s and include theories from notable OB researchers such as: [[Frederick Herzberg]], [[Abraham Maslow]], [[David McClelland]], [[Victor Vroom]], and [[Douglas McGregor]]. These theories underline employee motivation, [[work performance]], and [[job satisfaction]].&lt;ref name = "Miner"/&gt;

[[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]]'s ''[[Administrative Behavior]]'' introduced a number of important OB concepts, most notably decision-making. Simon, along with [[Chester Barnard]], argued that people make decisions differently inside an organization when compared to their decisions outside of an organization. While classical economic theories assume that people are rational decision-makers, Simon argued a contrary point. He argued that cognition is limited because of [[bounded rationality]] For example, decision-makers often employ [[satisficing]], the process of utilizing the first marginally acceptable solution rather than the most optimal solution.&lt;ref name = "Simon1997"&gt;[[Simon, Herbert A.]] (1997) ''Administrative Behavior: A Study of Decision-Making Processes in Administrative Organizations, 4th ed., The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Simon was awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]] for his work on organizational decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: Studies of decision-making lead to prize in economics|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1978/press.html|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=11 May 2014|date=16 October 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, the field started to become more [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[resource dependence|resource dependent]]. This gave rise to [[contingency theory]], [[institutional theory]], and [[organizational ecology]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} Starting in the 1980s, cultural explanations of organizations and organizational change became areas of study, in concert with fields such as [[anthropology]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]].

==Current state of the field==
Research in and the teaching of OB primarily takes place in university [[management]] departments in colleges of business. Sometimes OB topics are taught in [[industrial and organizational psychology]] graduate programs.

{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
There have been additional developments in OB research and practice. [[Anthropology]] has become increasingly influential, and led to the idea that one can understand firms as communities, by introducing concepts such as [[organizational culture]], organizational rituals, and symbolic acts.&lt;ref name="Moorhead"/&gt; [[Leadership studies]] have also become part of OB.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} OB researchers have shown increased interest in ethics and its importance in an organization.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} Some OB researchers have become interested in the aesthetic sphere of organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = S. | last2 = Hansen | first2 = H. | year = 2005 | title = Finding form: Looking at the field of organizational aesthetics drawing on theories and methods from the humanities, including theater, literature, music, and art. | url = | journal = Journal of Management Studies | volume = 42 | issue = 6| pages = 1211–1231 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6486.2005.00539.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research methods used==
A variety of methods are used in organizational behavior, many of which are found in other social sciences.

===Quantitative methods===
{{Main article|Quantitative research}}
Statistical methods used in OB research commonly include [[correlation]], [[analysis of variance]], [[meta-analysis]], [[multilevel model]]ing, [[multiple regression]], [[structural equation modeling]], and [[time series analysis]]&lt;ref name = "Brewerton"&gt;Brewerton, P.M., &amp; Millward, L.J.

===Computer simulation===
{{Main article|Computer simulation and organization studies}}

Computer simulation is a prominent method in organizational behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Lin, Carroll, &amp; Carley, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; While there are many uses for [[computer simulation]], most OB researchers have used computer simulation to understand how organizations or firms operate. More recently, however, researchers have also started to apply computer simulation to understand individual behavior at a micro-level, focusing on individual and interpersonal [[cognition]] and [[behavior]]&lt;ref name="Hughes et al (2012) JOOP"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hughes | first1 = H.

===Qualitative methods===
{{Main article|Qualitative research}}
Qualitative research&lt;ref name = "Brewerton"/&gt; consists of a number of methods of inquiry that generally do not involve the quantification of variables. Qualitative methods can range from the [[content analysis]] of interviews or written material to written narratives of observations. Common methods include [[ethnography]], [[case study|case studies]], historical methods, and interviews.

==Topics==

=== Consulting ===
Consultants use principles developed in OB research to assess clients' organizational problems and provide high quality services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ob.blogsite.org/index.php/2018/02/06/how-to-work-with-a-demanding-client/|title=How to work with a demanding client – Organizational Behavior Guide for Consultants|date=2018-02-06|work=Organizational Behavior Guide for Consultants|access-date=2018-02-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counterproductive work behavior===
{{Main article|Counterproductive work behavior}}
Counterproductive work behavior is employee behavior that harms or intends to harm an organization.&lt;ref&gt;Spector, P. E., &amp; Fox, S. (2005). The Stressor-Emotion Model of Counterproductive Work Behavior. In S. Fox, P. E. Spector (Eds.), ''Counterproductive work behavior: Investigations of actors and targets'' (pp. 151-174). Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association. {{DOI|10.1037/10893-007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision-making===
{{Main article|Decision-making}}

Many OB researchers embrace the [[rational planning model]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Decision-making research often focuses on how decisions are ordinarily made (normative decision-making), how thinkers arrive at a particular judgement (descriptive decision-making), and how to improve this decision-making (prescriptive decision-making).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Employee mistreatment===

There are several types of mistreatment that employees endure in organizations including: Abusive supervision, bullying, incivility, and sexual harassment.

====Abusive supervision====
{{Main article|Abusive supervision}}

Abusive supervision is the extent to which a [[supervisor]] engages in a pattern of behavior that harms subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tepper | first1 = B. J. | year = 2000 | title = Consequences of abusive supervision | url = | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 178–190 | doi = 10.2307/1556375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bullying====
{{Main article|Workplace bullying}}
Although definitions of workplace bullying vary, it involves a repeated pattern of harmful behaviors directed towards an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, C., &amp; Keashly, L. (2005). Bullying at Work: A Perspective From Britain and North America. In S. Fox &amp; P. E. Spector (Eds.), Counterproductive work behavior: Investigations of actors and targets. (pp. 271-296). Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; In order for a behavior to be termed bullying, the individual or individuals doing the harm have to possesses (either singly or jointly) more power than the victim.

====Incivility====
{{Main article|Workplace incivility}}

Workplace incivility consists of low-intensity discourteous and [[rude]] behavior and is characterized by an ambiguous intent to harm, and the violation of [[Norm (social)|social norms]] governing appropriate workplace behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andersson | first1 = L. M. | last2 = Pearson | first2 = C. M. | year = 1999 | title = Tit for tat? The spiraling effect of incivility in the workplace | doi = 10.5465/amr.1999.2202131 | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 452–471 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sexual harassment====
{{Main article|Sexual harassment}}
Sexual harassment is behavior that denigrates or mistreats an individual due to his or her gender, often creating an offensive workplace that interferes with job performance.&lt;ref&gt;Rospenda, K. M., &amp; Richman, J. A. (2005). Harassment and discrimination. In J. Barling, E. K. Kelloway &amp; M. R. Frone (Eds.), Handbook of work stress (pp. 149-188). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teams===
{{Main article|Team}}

===Job-related attitudes and emotions===
Organizational behavior deals with employee attitudes and feelings, including [[job satisfaction]], [[organizational commitment]], and [[emotional labor]]. Job satisfaction reflects the feelings an employee has about his or her job or facets of the job, such as pay or supervision.&lt;ref&gt;Balzer, W. K. &amp; Gillespie, J. Z. (2007). Job satisfaction. In Rogelberg, S. G. (Ed.). Encyclopedia of industrial and organizational psychology Vol. 1 (pp. 406-413). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational commitment represents the extent to which employees feel attached to their organization.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, N. J. Organizational commitment. In Rogelberg, S. G. (Ed.). Encyclopedia of industrial and organizational psychology Vol. 2 (pp. 548-551). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional labor concerns the requirement that an employee display certain emotions, such smiling at customers, even when the employee does not feel the emotion he or she is required to display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ashkanasy | first1 = N. M. | last2 = Härtel | first2 = C. E. J. | last3 = Daus | first3 = C.

===Leadership===
{{Main article|Leadership}}
There have been a number of theories that concern leadership. Early theories focused on characteristics of leaders, while later theories focused on leader behavior, and conditions under which leaders can be effective. Among these approaches are [[contingency theory]], the [[consideration and initiating structure]] model, [[leader-member exchange theory|leader-member exchange or LMX theory]], [[path-goal theory]], and [[transformational leadership theory]].

Contingency theory indicates that good leadership depends on characteristics of the leader and the situation.&lt;ref name="Fielder1"&gt;Fiedler, F. E. (1978). The contingency model and the dynamics of the leadership process. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in experimental social psychology (pp. 59-112). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ohio State Leadership Studies identified dimensions of leadership known as consideration (showing concern and respect for subordinates) and initiating structure (assigning tasks and setting performance goals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fleishman | first1 = E. A. | last2 = Harris | first2 = E. F. | year = 1962 | title = Patterns of leadership behavior related to employee grievances and turnover | url = | journal = Personnel Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 43–56 | doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.1962.tb01845.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levy, P. E. (2006). Industrial/organizational psychology: Understanding the workplace. Boston: Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt; LMX theory focuses on exchange relationships between individual supervisor-subordinate pairs.&lt;ref name="Novak1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graen | first1 = G.

J. | last2 = Mitchell | first2 = T. R. | year = 1974 | title = Path-goal theory of leadership | url = | journal = Contemporary business | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 81–98 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transformational leadership theory concerns the behaviors leaders engage in that inspire high levels of motivation and performance in followers. The idea of [[charismatic leadership]] is part of transformational leadership theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bass | first1 = B. M. | last2 = Avolio | first2 = B. J. | last3 = Atwater | first3 = L.

===Managerial roles===

{{Main article|Mintzberg's managerial roles}}
In the late 1960s [[Henry Mintzberg]], a graduate student at MIT, carefully studied the activities of five executives. On the basis of his observations, Mintzberg arrived at three categories that subsume managerial roles: interpersonal roles, decisional roles, and informational roles.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, S. P. (2009). Organizational behaviour. Cape Town, Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivation===
Baron and Greenberg (2008)&lt;ref&gt;Baron, Robert A., and Greenberg, Jerald. ''Behavior in organizations'' &amp;ndash; 9th edition. Pearson Education Inc., New Jersey: 2008. p.248&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that motivation involves "the set of processes that arouse, direct, and maintain human behavior toward attaining some goal." There are several different theories of motivation relevant to OB, including [[equity theory]],&lt;ref name="Adams1965"&gt;Adams, J. S. (1965). Inequity in social exchange. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in experimental social psychology (pp. 276-299). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[expectancy theory]],&lt;ref name="Vroom1964"&gt;Vroom, V. H. (1964).

(1968, January/February). One more time: How do you motivate employees? Harvard Business Review, 52-62.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Theory X and Theory Y]].&lt;ref name="McGregor, D. M. 1960"&gt;McGregor, D. M. (1960). The human side of enterprise. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

===National culture===

National culture is thought to affect the behavior of individuals in organizations. This idea is exemplified by [[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory]]. Hofstede surveyed a large number of cultures and identified six dimensions of national cultures that influence the behavior of individuals in organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstede, Geert, Gert Jan Hofstede and Michael Minkov.Cultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind, 3rd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; These dimensions include power distance, individualism vs. collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity vs. femininity, long-term orientation vs. short term orientation, and indulgence vs. restraint.

===Organizational citizenship behavior===
{{Main article|Organizational citizenship behavior}}

Organizational citizenship behavior is behavior that goes beyond assigned tasks and contributes to the well-being of organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Organ, D. W. (1988). Organizational citizenship behavior: The good soldier syndrome. Lexington, MA, England: Lexington Books/D C Heath and Com.f&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizational culture===
{{Main article|Organizational culture}}

Organizational culture reflects the values and behaviors that are commonly observed in an organization. Investigators who pursue this line of research assume that organizations can be characterized by cultural dimensions such as beliefs, values, rituals, symbols, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;Shein, Edgar (1992). Organizational Culture and Leadership: A Dynamic View. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have developed models for understanding an organization's culture or developed typologies of organizational culture. [[Edgar Schein]] developed a model for understanding organizational culture. He identified three levels of organizational culture: (a) artifacts and behaviors, (b) espoused values, and (c) shared basic assumptions. Specific cultures have been related to organizational performance&lt;ref&gt;Kotter, John and Heskett, James L. (1992) Corporate Culture and Performance, Free Press; {{ISBN|0-02-918467-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Denison, Daniel R. (1990) Corporate culture and organizational effectiveness, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===
{{Main article|Personality}}
Personality concerns consistent patterns of behavior, [[cognition]], and [[emotion]] in individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Michel, W., Shoda, Y., &amp; Smith, R. E. (2004). ''Introduction to personality: Toward an integration''. New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; The study of personality in organizations has generally focused on the relation of specific traits to employee performance. There has been a particular focus on the [[Big Five personality traits]], which refers to five overarching personality traits.

===Occupational stress===
{{Main article|Occupational stress}}

There are number of ways to characterize occupational stress. One way of characterizing it is to term it an imbalance between job demands (aspects of the job that require mental or physical effort) and resources that help manage the demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Demerouti | first1 = E. | last2 = Bakker | first2 = A. B. | last3 = Nachreiner | first3 = F. | last4 = Schaufeli | first4 = W.

===Work-family===
{{Main article|Work-family conflict}}
[[Chester Barnard]] recognized that individuals behave differently when acting in their work role than when acting in roles outside their work role.&lt;ref name=Barnard1938 /&gt; Work-family conflict occurs when the demands of family and work roles are incompatible, and the demands of at least one role interfere with the discharge of the demands of the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenhaus | first1 = J. H. | last2 = Beutell | first2 = N. J. | year = 1985 | title = Sources and conflict between work and family roles | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 76–88 | doi=10.5465/amr.1985.4277352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization theory==
{{Main article|Organizational theory}}
Organization theory is concerned with explaining the workings of an organization as a whole or of many organizations. The focus of organizational theory is to understand the structure and processes of organizations and how organizations interact with each other and the larger society.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Bureaucracy===

{{Main article|Bureaucracy}}

[[Max Weber]] argued that bureaucracy involved the application of [[rational-legal]] authority to the organization of work, making bureaucracy the most technically efficient form of organization.&lt;ref name="Weber1947"/&gt; Weber enumerated a number of principles of bureaucratic organization including: a formal organizational hierarchy, management by rules, organization by functional specialty, selecting people based on their skills and technical qualifications, an "up-focused" (to organization's board or shareholders) or "in-focused" (to the organization itself) mission, and a purposefully impersonal environment (e.g., applying the same rules and structures to all members of the organization). These rules reflect Weberian "ideal types," and how they are enacted in organizations varies according to local conditions. [[Charles Perrow]] extended Weber's work, arguing that all organizations can be understood in terms of bureaucracy and that organizational failures are more often a result of insufficient application of bureaucratic principles.&lt;ref&gt;Perrow, C. (1986). ''Complex organizations: A critical essay'' (3rd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic theories of organization===

At least three theories are relevant here, [[theory of the firm]], [[transaction cost economics]], and [[agency theory]].

===Theories pertaining to organizational structures===

Theories pertaining to organizational structures and dynamics include [[complexity theory and organizations|complexity theory]], [[French and Raven's five bases of power]],&lt;ref&gt;French, J. R. P., Jr., &amp; Raven, B. (1959). The bases of social power. In D. Cartwright (Ed.), Studies in social power (pp. 150-167). Ann Arbor, MI: Institute for Social Research.&lt;/ref&gt; [[hybrid organization|hybrid organization theory]], [[informal organization|informal organizational theory]], [[resource dependence theory]], and [[Mintzberg]]'s [[organigraph]].

===Institutional theory===

{{Main article|Institutional theory}}

===Systems theory===

{{Main article|Systems theory}}
The systems framework is also fundamental to organizational theory. [[Organization]]s are complex, goal-oriented entities.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, D., &amp; Kahn, R. L. (1978). ''The social psychology of organizations'' (2 ed.). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Bogdanov]], an early thinker in the field, developed his [[tectology]], a theory widely considered a precursor of [[Bertalanffy]]'s [[general systems theory]]. One of the aims of general systems theory was to model human organizations. [[Kurt Lewin]], a social psychologist, was influential in developing a systems perspective with regard to organizations. He coined the term "systems of ideology," partly based on his frustration with behaviorist psychology, which he believed to be an obstacle to sustainable work in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ash | first1 = M.G. | year = 1992 | title = Cultural contexts and scientific change in psychology: Kurt Lewin in Iowa | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 198–207 | doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.47.2.198 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niklas Luhmann]], a sociologist, developed a sociological systems theory.

===Organizational ecology===

{{Main article|Organizational ecology}}
Organizational ecology models apply concepts from [[evolutionary theory]] to the study of populations of organisations, focusing on birth (founding), growth and change, and death (firm mortality). In this view, organizations are 'selected' based on their fit with their operating environment.

===Scientific management===
{{Main article|Scientific management}}

Scientific management refers to an approach to management based on principles of [[engineering]]. It focuses on incentives and other practices empirically shown to improve productivity.

[[Image:English dialects1997.svg|thumb|right|Pie chart of populations of [[English language|English]] native speakers]]
A '''pie chart''' (or a '''circle chart''') is a circular  [[Statistical graphics|statistical graphic]], which is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion.  In a pie chart, the [[arc length]] of each slice (and consequently its [[central angle]] and [[area]]), is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the quantity it represents. While it is named for its resemblance to a [[pie]] which has been sliced, there are variations on the way it can be presented. The earliest known pie chart is generally credited to [[William Playfair]]'s ''Statistical Breviary'' of 1801.&lt;ref name="Spence2005"&gt;Spence (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tufte, p. 44"&gt;Tufte, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Pie charts are very widely used in the business world and the mass media.&lt;ref name="Cleveland"&gt;Cleveland, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; However, they have been criticized,&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"&gt;Wilkinson, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and many experts recommend avoiding them,&lt;ref name="tufte"&gt;Tufte, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vanbelle"&gt;van Belle, p. 160–162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sfew"&gt;Stephen Few. [http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/08-21-07.pdf "Save the Pies for Dessert"], August 2007, Retrieved 2010-02-02&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fenton"&gt;Steve Fenton [http://www.stevefenton.co.uk/Content/Pie-Charts-Are-Bad/ "Pie Charts Are Bad"]&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out that research has shown it is difficult to compare different sections of a given pie chart, or to compare data across different pie charts. Pie charts can be replaced in most cases by other plots such as the [[bar chart]], [[box plot]] or [[dot plot (statistics)|dot plots]].

The earliest known pie chart is generally credited to [[William Playfair]]'s ''Statistical Breviary'' of 1801, in which two such graphs are used.&lt;ref  name="Spence2005"&gt;Spence (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tufte, p. 44"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datavis.ca/milestones/index.php?group=1800%2B&amp;mid=ms89 Milestones in the History of Thematic Cartography, Statistical Graphics, and Data Visualization]&lt;/ref&gt; Playfair presented an illustration, which contained a series of pie charts. One of those charts depicting the proportions of the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish Empire]] located in [[Asia]], [[Europe]] and [[Africa]] before 1789. This invention was not widely used at first;&lt;ref name="Spence2005"&gt;Spence (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The French engineer [[Charles Joseph Minard]] was one of the first to use pie charts in 1858, in particular in maps. Minard's map, 1858 used pie charts to represent the cattle sent from all around [[France]] for consumption in [[Paris]] (1858).

Playfair thought that pie charts were in need of a third dimension to add additional information.&lt;ref&gt;Palsky, p. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that [[Florence Nightingale]] invented it, though in fact she just popularised it and she was later assumed to have created it due to the obscurity of Playfair's creation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uktv.co.uk/dave/article/aid/631002 Dave article on this information on QI]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants and similar charts==

==={{anchor|Perspective}}3D pie chart and perspective pie cake===
&lt;!-- '3D pie chart', '3d pie chart', and 'Perspective pie cake' redirect here. Please do not remove the anchor. --&gt;
A 3d pie chart, or perspective pie chart, is used to give the chart a [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] look. Often used for aesthetic reasons, the third dimension does not improve the reading of the data; on the contrary, these plots are difficult to interpret because of the distorted effect of [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] associated with the third dimension. The use of superfluous dimensions not used to display the data of interest is discouraged for charts in general, not only for pie charts.&lt;ref name="sfew" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Good and Hardin, chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doughnut chart===
[[File:Example of a doughnut chart.png|thumb|Information on the data as a hole in the center of a doughnut chart]]
A doughnut chart (also spelled donut) is a variant of the pie chart, with a blank center allowing for additional information about the data as a whole to be included.

===Exploded pie chart===
&lt;!-- 'Exploded pie chart' redirects here. If you rename this section, please also update the redirect. --&gt;
[[Image:Pie chart EP election 2004 exploded.png|thumb|150px|left|Exploded pie chart for the example data (see below), with the largest party group exploded.]]
A chart with one or more sectors separated from the rest of the disk is known as an ''exploded pie chart''. This effect is used to either highlight a sector, or to highlight smaller segments of the chart with small proportions.

===Polar area diagram===
[[Image:Nightingale-mortality.jpg|thumb|"''Diagram of the causes of mortality in the army in the East''" by Florence Nightingale.]]
The polar area diagram is similar to a usual pie chart, except sectors have equal angles and differ rather in how far each sector extends from the center of the circle.
The polar area diagram is used to plot cyclic phenomena (e.g., counts of deaths by month).
For example, if the counts of deaths in each month for a year are to be plotted then there will be 12 sectors (one per month) all with the same angle of 30 degrees each. The radius of each sector would be proportional to the square root of the death count for the month, so the area of a sector represents the number of deaths in a month.
If the death count in each month is subdivided by cause of death, it is possible to make multiple comparisons on one diagram, as is seen in the polar area diagram famously developed by [[Florence Nightingale]].

The first known use of polar area diagrams was by [[André-Michel Guerry]], which he called {{lang|fr|courbes circulaires}}, in an 1829 paper showing seasonal and daily variation in wind direction over the year and births and deaths by hour of the day.&lt;ref name="Friendly, p. 509"&gt;Friendly, p. 509&lt;/ref&gt; [[Léon Lalanne]] later used a polar diagram to show the frequency of wind directions around compass points in 1843. The [[wind rose]] is still used by [[meteorologist]]s. Nightingale published her rose diagram in 1858. Although the name "coxcomb" has come to be associated with this type of diagram, Nightingale originally used the term to refer to the publication in which this diagram first appeared--an attention-getting book of charts and tables--rather than to this specific type of diagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.florence-nightingale-avenging-angel.co.uk/GraphicsPaper/Graphics.htm | title=Florence Nightingale's Statistical Diagrams | accessdate=2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Disk usage (Boabab).png|thumb|right|Multi-level pie chart representing disk usage in a Linux file system]]
{{See also|Radial tree}}
A ring chart, also known as a [[sunburst]] chart or a multilevel pie chart, is used to visualize hierarchical data, depicted by concentric circles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neoformix.com/2006/MultiLevelPieChart.html Clark Jeff. (2006). ''Neoformix''. "Multi-level Pie Charts"]&lt;/ref&gt; The circle in the center represents the root node, with the hierarchy moving outward from the center. A segment of the inner circle bears a hierarchical relationship to those segments of the outer circle which lie within the angular sweep of the parent segment.&lt;ref&gt;Webber Richard, Herbert Ric, Jiangbc Wel. "Space-filling Techniques in Visualizing Output from Computer Based Economic Models"&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Spie chart===
[[Image:Spie_chart_001.png|thumb|left|A spie chart comparing number of students with student costs across four different schools]]
A variant of the polar area chart is the spie chart designed by Dror Feitelson.&lt;ref name="spie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~feit/papers/Spie03TR.pdf|title=Feitelson, Dror (2003) Comparing Partitions With Spie Charts|year=2003|access-date=2010-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This superimposes a normal pie chart with a modified polar area chart to permit the comparison of two sets of related data. 
The base pie chart represents the first data set in the usual way, with different slice sizes. The second set is represented by the superimposed polar area chart, using the same angles as the base, and adjusting the radii to fit the data. For example, the base pie chart could show the distribution of age and gender groups in a population, and the overlay their representation among road casualties. Age and gender groups that are especially susceptible to being involved in accidents then stand out as slices that extend beyond the original pie chart.

=== Square chart / Waffle chart===
[[File:Square Pie Chart - Waffle Chart.jpg|thumb|Square pie chart (Waffle chart), showing how smaller percentages are more easily shown than on circular charts. On the 10x10 grid, each cell represents 1%.]]
Square charts, also called Waffle Charts, are a form of pie charts that use squares instead of circles to represent percentages. Similar to basic circular pie charts, square pie charts take each percentage out of a total 100%.They are usually 10x10 grids, where each cell represents 1%. Despite the name, circles, pictograms (such as of people), and other shapes may be used instead of squares. The benefit to these is that it is easier to depict smaller percentages that would be hard to see on traditional pie charts. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Example==
[[Image:Pie chart EP election 2004.svg|thumb|A pie chart for the example data]]
The following example chart is based on preliminary results of the [[European Parliament election, 2004|election for the European Parliament in 2004]]. The table lists the number of seats allocated to each party group, along with the derived percentage of the total that they each make up. The values in the last column, the derived central angle of each sector, Is found by multiplying the percentage by 360°.

{| class="wikitable"
!Group           !! Seats !! Percent (%) !! Central angle (°)
|-
|[[European United Left–Nordic Green Left|EUL]] ||   39  ||     5.3     ||  19.2
|-
|[[Party of European Socialists|PES]]         ||  200  ||    27.3     ||  98.4
|-
|[[European Free Alliance|EFA]]        ||   42  ||     5.7     ||  20.7
|-
|[[Europe of Democracies and Diversities|EDD]]         ||   15  ||     2.0     ||   7.4
|-
|[[European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party|ELDR]]        ||   67  ||     9.2     ||  33.0
|-
|[[European People's Party|EPP]]         ||  276  ||    37.7     || 135.7
|-
|[[Union for Europe of the Nations|UEN]]         ||   27  ||     3.7     ||  13.3
|-
|Other           ||   66  ||     9.0     ||  32.5
|-
|Total           ||   732 ||    99.9*    || 360.2*
|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Because of rounding, these totals do not add up to 100 and 360.

The size of each central angle is proportional to the size of the corresponding quantity, here the number of seats. Since the sum of the central angles has to be 360°, the central angle for a quantity that is a fraction ''Q'' of the total is 360''Q'' degrees.
In the example, the central angle for the largest group (European People's Party (EPP)) is 135.7° because 0.377 times 360, rounded to one decimal place, equals 135.7.

==Use and effectiveness==
[[File:Atmospheric air components percentage.jpg|thumb|left|3D pie chart showing Atmospheric air components percentage]]
An obvious flaw exhibited by pie charts is that they cannot show more than a few values without separating the visual encoding (the “slices”) from the data they represent (typically percentages). When slices become too small, pie charts have to rely on colors, textures or arrows so the reader can understand them. This makes them unsuitable for use with larger amounts of data. Pie charts also take up a larger amount of space on the page compared to the more flexible bar charts, which do not need to have separate legends, and can display other values such as averages or targets at the same time.&lt;ref name="sfew" /&gt;

[[Statisticians]] generally regard pie charts as a poor method of displaying information, and they are uncommon in scientific literature. One reason is that it is more difficult for comparisons to be made between the size of items in a chart [[Stevens' power law|when area is used instead of length]] and when different items are shown as different shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Krygier |first1=John |title=Perceptual Scaling of Map Symbols |url=http://makingmaps.net/2007/08/28/perceptual-scaling-of-map-symbols/ |website=makingmaps.net |accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Piecharts.svg|thumb|right|Three sets of percentages, plotted as both piecharts and barcharts. Comparing the data on barcharts is generally easier.]]
Further, in research performed at [[AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories]], it was shown that comparison by angle was less accurate than comparison by length. This can be illustrated with the adjacent diagram, showing three pie charts, and, below each of them, the corresponding bar chart representing the same data. Most subjects have difficulty ordering the slices in the pie chart by size; when the bar chart is used the comparison is much easier.&lt;ref name="cleveland85"&gt;Cleveland, p. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, comparisons between data sets are easier using the bar chart. However, if the goal is to compare a given category (a slice of the pie) with the total (the whole pie) in a single chart and the multiple is close to 25 or 50 percent, then a pie chart can often be more effective than a bar graph.&lt;ref&gt;Simkin, D., &amp; Hastie, R.

[[Image:Badpie.png|thumb|left|An example of a pie chart with 18 values]]
The example (left) is of a pie chart with 18 values, having to separate the data from its representation. Note also that several values are represented with the same color, making interpretation difficult.

Several studies presented at the ''European Visualization Conference'' analyzed the relative accuracy of several pie chart formats,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eagereyes.org/blog/2016/an-illustrated-tour-of-the-pie-chart-study-results|title=An Illustrated Tour of the Pie Chart Study Results|date=2016-06-28|newspaper=eagereyes|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skau|first=Drew|last2=Kosara|first2=Robert|year=2016|title=Arcs, Angles, or Areas: Individual Data Encodings in Pie and Donut Charts|url=http://kosara.net/publications/Skau-EuroVis-2016.html|journal=EuroVis|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kosara|first=Robert|last2=Skau|first2=Drew|year=2016|title=Judgment Error in Pie Chart Variations|url=http://kosara.net/publications/Kosara-EuroVis-2016.html|journal=EuroVis|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching the conclusion that pie charts and doughnut charts produce similar error levels when reading them, and square pie charts provide the most accurate reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eagereyes.org/blog/2016/a-reanalysis-of-a-study-about-square-pie-charts-from-2009|title=A Reanalysis of A Study About (Square) Pie Charts from 2009|date=2016-07-11|newspaper=eagereyes|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2100">In [[mathematics]], the '''quasi-commutative property''' is an extension or generalization of the general [[commutative property]]. This property is used in specific applications with various definitions.

==Applied to matrices==

Two [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] ''p'' and ''q'' are said to have the [[commutative property]] whenever
:&lt;math&gt;pq = qp&lt;/math&gt;

The quasi-commutative property in matrices is defined&lt;ref name=McCoy&gt;Neal H. McCoy. [http://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1934-036-02/S0002-9947-1934-1501746-8/S0002-9947-1934-1501746-8.pdf On quasi-commutative matrices. ''Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, 36''(2), 327–340].&lt;/ref&gt; as follows. Given two non-commutable matrices ''x'' and ''y''
:&lt;math&gt; xy - yx = z&lt;/math&gt;
satisfy the quasi-commutative property whenever ''z'' satisfies the following properties:
:&lt;math&gt; xz = zx &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; yz = zy &lt;/math&gt;

An example is found in the [[matrix mechanics]] introduced by [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] as a version of [[quantum mechanics]]. In this mechanics, ''p'' and ''q'' are infinite matrices corresponding respectively to the momentum and position variables of a particle.&lt;ref name=McCoy/&gt; These matrices are written out at [[Matrix mechanics#Harmonic oscillator]], and z = iħ times the infinite [[Identity matrix|unit matrix]], where ħ is the [[reduced Planck constant]].

==Applied to functions==

A function ''f'', defined as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;f: X \times Y \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;
is said to be quasi-commutative&lt;ref&gt;Benaloh, J., &amp; De Mare, M. (1994, January). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.13.8287&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf One-way accumulators: A decentralized alternative to digital signatures]. In ''Advances in Cryptology—EUROCRYPT’93'' (pp. 274–285). Springer Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt; if for all &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; and for all &lt;math&gt;y_1, y_2 \in Y&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;f(f(x,y_1),y_2) = f(f(x,y_2),y_1)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2610">'''Real freedom''' is a term coined by the [[political philosophy|political philosopher]] and [[economist]] [[Philippe Van Parijs]]. It expands upon notions of [[negative freedom]] by incorporating not simply institutional or other constraints on a person's choices, but also the requirements of physical reality, resources and personal capacity. To have real freedom, according to Van Parjis, an individual must:

:1. not be prevented from acting on their will (i.e. they must have traditional negative freedom)
:2. possess the resources or capacities actually to carry out their will.

Under this conception, a [[moral agent]] could be ''negatively'' free to take a holiday in [[Miami]], because no-one is forcing them not to (condition 1 is met); but not ''really'' free to do so, because they cannot afford the flight (condition 2 is not met). Similarly, someone could be negatively free to swim across the [[English Channel]]; but not really free, because they are not a good enough swimmer and would not be able to succeed in the task. Real freedom is, then, a matter of ''degree'' — one is more or less really free, not just either really free or not; and no-one has ''complete'' real freedom — no-one is currently really free to [[Teleportation|teleport]] to [[Mars]], for instance.

Real freedom expands on negative freedom by adding the idea of actually being able to exercise a capacity or resource in the absence of constraint; but does not go as far as some ideas of positive freedom, by refraining from appeal to self-government by a real, best, or higher self.

Van Parijs uses the concept of real freedom as part of his influential argument for a [[universal basic income]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Philippe |last=Van Parijs |title=Real Freedom For All: What (if anything) can justify capitalism? |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rigo 23''' (born '''Ricardo Gouveia''', 1966) is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[muralist]], [[Painting|painter]], and political artist residing in [[San Francisco, California]]. He is known in the San Francisco community for having painted a number of large, graphic "sign" murals including: ''[http://foundsf.org/images/0/09/Rigo_one-tree.jpg One Tree]'' next to the [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]] on-ramp at 10th and Bryant Street, ''[http://foundsf.org/index.php?title=File:Art1$innercity-home.jpg Innercity Home]'' on a large public housing structure, ''[http://www.billyverse.com/x/sky_ground.html Sky/Ground]'' on a tall abandoned building at 3rd and [[Mission Street]], and ''[http://foundsf.org/index.php?title=File:Rigo_extinct.jpg Extinct]'' over a Shell gas station.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cometmagazine.org/cometsite4/cometsite3/rigo.html|title=Walls with Tongues: Muralist RIGO 02 Speaks|last=Fleming|first=Siobhan|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Early life and education==
Rigo was born and raised on the island of [[Madeira]]. He later established himself as an artist in San Francisco, earning a BFA from [[San Francisco Art Institute]] in 1991 and an MFA from [[Stanford University]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="comet"&gt;[http://www.cometmagazine.com/cometsite4/cometsite3/rigo.html "Walls with Tongues: Muralist RIGO 02 Speaks"] by Siobhan Fleming, ''Comet Magazine'' 3, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Career==
From 1984-2002, Rigo used the last two digits of the current year as part of his name, finally settling upon "23" in 2003.&lt;ref name="comet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kpfk"&gt;[http://www.kpfk.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1310&amp;Itemid=79&amp;lang=en Calendar item for 'Jam Sessions: Rigo 84–23'], "Another World is Possible" (radio show) website, ''[[KPFK]].com'', January 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bulk of Rigo's work more literally highlights world politics and political prisoners from the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]] and the [[Angola Three]] to [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]], whose conviction for the murder of a policeman is contested, and the [[American Indian Movement]]'s [[Leonard Peltier]]. Rigo create a controversial [[Statue of Leonard Peltier|statue of Peltier]] that was removed from the grounds of the [[American University]] in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/01/04/anger-at-a-cop-killer-a-plea-for-clemency-and-a-fight-over-free-expression-at-au/?tid=hybrid_collaborative_1_na&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.american.edu/cas/museum/upload/AU-Peltier.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, he created a statue based on the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute]] titled ''Victory Salute'', a twenty-two foot tall monument of two men: [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]]. In the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympic Games]] in [[Mexico City]], these men each raised a black-gloved fist for human rights. Their simple gesture of the hand is considered as one of the most controversial statements of political and social activism in Olympic history. ''Victory Salute'' is a monument of that moment which was specifically built on the [[San Jose State University]] campus because Smith and Carlos were both student-athletes at the college.

Rigo is one of the founding members of [http://www.meganwilson.com/related/clarion.php Clarion Alley Mural Project] collective and is still an active member, as of 2006, as well as an occasional professor at The San Francisco Art Institute.&lt;ref name="comet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="clarion"&gt;[http://www.meganwilson.com/related/clarion.php "Clarion Alley Mural Project"] by Megan Wilson, ''MeganWilson.com'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
He has also designed several installations as part of the 2006 Liverpool Biennial.&lt;ref name="biennial"&gt;[http://www.biennial.com/corporate/archive/2006/content/Programme/ArtistDirectory/article_35_108.html "Rigo 23"]. Liverpool Biennnial 2006 artists directory.&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered by some [[art critics]] and curators to be part of the first generation of the San Francisco [[Mission School]] art movement.&lt;ref name="helfand"&gt;[http://www.sfbg.com/36/28/art_mission_school.html "The Mission school"] by Glen Helfand, ''[[San Francisco Bay Guardian]]'', October 28, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="remarketing"&gt;[http://www.stretcher.org/archives/r6_a/2005_01_17_r6_archive.php Reader responses to "Marketing the Mission"], ''Stretcher.org'', January 17, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; His work is in the collection of di Rosa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Collection|url=http://www.dirosaart.org/about/the-collection/|website=dirosaart.org|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5570">'''Sex Industry Network''' (also known as '''SIN''') is a peer-based, not for profit organisation, funded by SA Health, a [[South Australia]] government organisation. Its aim is to maintain low rates of [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs), [[Blood-borne disease|blood borne viruses]] (BBVs) and [[HIV]] among [[sex workers]] and their clients in South Australia.

SIN provides safer sex supplies such as [[condoms]] and [[Personal lubricant|lube]] and delivers outreach to brothels, parlours, private and street based sex workers.

==History==
SIN was formed out of the Prostitutes Association of South Australia (PASA), a group formed in 1986 by sex workers.&lt;ref name="SIN Jennings"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jennings|first1=S.|title=Sex Industry Network – best practice sex worker organisation|url=http://pag.aids2014.org/Abstracts.aspx?AID=2116|website=pag.aids2014.prog|publisher=20th International AIDS Conference|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time community groups from priority populations (sex workers, men who have sex with men and injecting drug users) were being funded to deliver HIV prevention information and education within communities as part of Australia’s partnership approach to HIV/AIDS. In 1987, PASA received a grant from the SA Health Commission to conduct a three-month HIV/AIDS education project with sex workers called the ‘Travelling Parlour Show’. Several sex workers received training to become ‘peer educators’ and joined with a nurse from the [[sexually transmitted infection]]s clinic and took their education and information sessions to the workplaces of sex workers across the metropolitan area of [[Adelaide]].

In 1989, PASA and the AIDS council of South Australia (ACSA) joined forces to develop an ongoing HIV/AIDS education project with the sex workers of South Australia.&lt;ref name="Scarlet Alliance SIN"&gt;{{cite web|title=June 2010 "The House of Ill Repute – 21 Years of SIN" Adelaide|url=http://www.scarletalliance.org.au/media/News_Item.2010-05-21.4545 |website=scarletalliance.org.au|publisher=Scarlet Alliance|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project has had several name changes including ‘the PASA project’ and ‘SWIPE’ but has been known as the SA Sex Industry Network or SIN since 1994.&lt;ref name="Same Memory, SA State Library"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Industry Page 5|url=http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=670|website=samememory.sa.gov.au|publisher=Government of South Australia State Library|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SIN was a founding member and continues to be an active member of [[Scarlet Alliance]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Prostitution Hope Ditmore"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hope Ditmore|first1=Melissa|title=Encyclopedia of Prostitution and Sex Work, Volume 2|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0313329702|page=431|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-5WyPfynlwMC&amp;pg=PA431&amp;lpg=PA431&amp;dq=Prostitutes+Association+of+South+Australia+%2B+PASA#v=onepage&amp;q=Prostitutes%20Association%20of%20South%20Australia%20%2B%20PASA&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, ACSA became insolvent and SIN was temporarily closed.&lt;ref name="Star Observer Ozturk"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ozturk|first1=Serkan|title=SA Govt Forces Closure of AIDS Council|url=http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/sa-govt-forces-closure-of-aids-council/107340|accessdate=12 October 2014|publisher=Star Observer|date=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarlet Alliance supported a group of volunteer sex workers in South Australia to keep limited services going while new arrangements were negotiated with the funding bodies. The SA health department agreed to fund  Scarlet Alliance to complete ACSA’s original contract.&lt;ref name=SWOP&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Worker Organisations|url=http://www.swop.org.au/links|website=swop.org.au|publisher=SWOP Sex Workers Outreach Project|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political advocacy==
SIN has supported Labor MP [[Steph Key]]'s attempts to decriminalize prostitution in South Australia. In 2012, the decriminalisation bill was defeated by one vote.&lt;ref&gt;[https://au.news.yahoo.com/sa/a/24846631/selling-sex-in-the-city-adelaides-illegal-prostitution-industry/ Selling sex in the city: Adelaide's illegal prostitution industry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011002615/https://au.news.yahoo.com/sa/a/24846631/selling-sex-in-the-city-adelaides-illegal-prostitution-industry/ |date=2014-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In 2017, an improved bill which had support of sex workers, the working women's centre and unions was introduced into the upper house. The decriminalisation of sex work bill &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/B/CURRENT/STATUTES%20AMENDMENT%20(DECRIMINALISATION%20OF%20SEX%20WORK)%20BILL%202015_HON%20MICHELLE%20LENSINK%20MLC.aspx/ Decriminalisation of Sex Work Bill (2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;  passed the upper house 13 votes to 8. .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-06/sa-sex-work-decriminalisation-marathon-debate/8682738/ Sex work decriminalisation one step closer in South Australia after marathon debate]&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2017, the lower house was set to debate the bill, however time ran out, resulting in a further delay to any progress.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26578">'''Thermal depolymerization''' ('''TDP''') is a [[depolymerization]] process using [[hydrous pyrolysis]] for the reduction of complex [[organic material]]s (usually [[waste]] products of various sorts, often [[biomass]] and [[plastic]]) into light [[crude oil]]. It mimics the natural [[geology|geological]] processes thought to be involved in the production of [[fossil fuel]]s. Under pressure and heat, long chain [[polymer]]s of [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[carbon]] decompose into short-chain [[petroleum]] [[hydrocarbon]]s with a maximum length of around 18 [[carbon]]s.

==Similar processes==
Thermal depolymerisation is similar to other processes which use [[superheated water]] as a major step to produce fuels, such as direct [[Hydrothermal Liquefaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =Biomass Program, direct Hydrothermal Liquefaction| work =| publisher =US Department of Energy.

These are distinct from processes using dry materials to depolymerize, such as [[pyrolysis]]. The term Thermochemical Conversion (TCC) has also been used for conversion of biomass to oils, using superheated water, although it is more usually applied to fuel production via pyrolysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Other commercial scale processes include the "SlurryCarb" process operated by EnerTech, which uses similar technology to decarboxylate wet solid biowaste, which can then be physically dewatered and used as a solid fuel called E-Fuel. The plant in Rialto, California was designed to process 683 tons of waste per day.   However, it failed to perform to design standards and was closed down.  The Rialto facility defaulted on its bond payments and is in the process of being liquidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==

Thermal depolymerization is similar to the geological processes that produced the fossil fuels used today, except that the technological process occurs in a timeframe measured in hours. Until recently, the [[human]]-designed processes were not efficient enough to serve as a practical source of fuel&amp;mdash;more [[energy]] was required than was produced.

The first industrial process to obtain gas, [[diesel fuel]]s and other petroleum products through pyrolysis of coal, tar or biomass was designed and patented in the late 1920s by [[Fischer-Tropsch]]. In U. S. patent [http://www.google.com/patents?id=-MlwAAAAEBAJ 2,177,557], issued in 1939, Bergstrom and Cederquist discuss a method for obtaining oil from wood in which the wood is heated under pressure in water with a significant amount of [[calcium hydroxide]] added to the mixture. In the early 1970s Herbert R. Appell and coworkers worked with hydrous pyrolysis methods, as exemplified by U. S. patent [http://www.google.com/patents?id=UEU9AAAAEBAJ 3,733,255] (issued in 1973), which discusses the production of oil from sewer [[sludge]] and municipal refuse by heating the material in water, under pressure, and in the presence of [[carbon monoxide]].

An approach that exceeded [[break-even]] was developed by [[Illinois]] [[microbiology|microbiologist]] [[Paul Baskis]] in the 1980s and refined over the next 15 years  (see U. S. patent [http://www.google.com/patents?id=0LYmAAAAEBAJ 5,269,947], issued in 1993). The technology was finally developed for commercial use in 1996 by [[Changing World Technologies]] (CWT). [[Brian S. Appel]] (CEO of CWT) took the technology in 2001 and expanded and changed it into what is now referred to as TCP (Thermal Conversion Process), and has applied for and obtained several patents (see, for example, published patent [http://www.google.com/patents?id=KxbsAQAAEBAJ 8,003,833], issued August 23, 2011). A Thermal Depolymerization demonstration plant was completed in 1999 in [[Philadelphia]] by Thermal Depolymerization, LLC, and the first full-scale commercial plant was constructed in [[Carthage, Missouri]], about {{convert|100|yd|m}} from [[ConAgra Foods]]' massive [[Butterball]] turkey plant, where it is expected to process about 200 [[ton]]s of [[domesticated turkey|turkey]] waste into {{convert|500|oilbbl|m3}} of oil per day.

==Theory and process==

In the method used by CWT, the water improves the heating process and contributes hydrogen to the reactions.

In the [[Changing World Technologies]] (CWT) process,&lt;ref&gt;The description of the operation of the process, including temperatures, pressures, and time, has been adapted from the description in Brad Lemley (May 2003). [http://discovermagazine.com/2003/may/featoil/ Anything Into Oil.] Discover. See also the description of the operation of the process in Appel et al., published U. S. patent application US [http://www.google.com/patents?id=VrGfAAAAEBAJ 2004/0192980], publication date September 30, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; the feedstock material is first ground into small chunks, and mixed with water if it is especially dry. It is then fed into a [[pressure vessel]] reaction chamber where it is heated at [[isochoric process|constant volume]] to around 250 °[[Celsius|C]]. Similar to a [[pressure cooker]] (except at much higher pressure), steam naturally raises the pressure to 600 psi (4 [[MPa]]) (near the point of [[Boiling point|saturated water]]). These conditions are held for approximately 15 minutes to fully heat the mixture, after which the pressure is rapidly released to boil off most of the water (see: [[Flash evaporation]]). The result is a mix of crude hydrocarbons and solid [[mineral]]s. The minerals are removed, and the hydrocarbons are sent to a second-stage reactor where they are heated to 500&amp;nbsp;°C, further breaking down the longer hydrocarbon chains. The hydrocarbons are then sorted by [[fractional distillation]], in a process similar to conventional [[oil refining]].

The CWT company claims that 15 to 20% of feedstock energy is used to provide energy for the plant. The remaining energy is available in the converted product. Working with turkey [[offal]] as the feedstock, the process proved to have yield efficiencies of approximately 85%; in other words, the energy contained in the end products of the process is 85% of the energy contained in the inputs to the process (most notably the energy content of the feedstock, but also including electricity for pumps and natural gas or [[woodgas]] for heating). If one considers the energy content of the feedstock to be free (i.e., waste material from some other process), then 85 units of energy are made available for every 15 units of energy consumed in process heat and electricity. This means the "[[EROEI|Energy Returned on Energy Invested]]" (EROEI) is (6.67), which is comparable to other energy harvesting processes. Higher efficiencies may be possible with drier and more carbon-rich feedstocks, such as waste [[plastic]].

By comparison, the current processes{{specify|date=July 2015}} used to produce [[alcohol as fuel|ethanol]] and [[biodiesel]] from [[agriculture|agricultural]] sources have EROEI in the 4.2 range, when the energy used to produce the feedstocks is accounted for (in this case, usually [[sugar cane]], [[maize|corn]], [[soybean]]s and the like). These EROEI values are not directly comparable, because these EROEI calculations include the energy cost to produce the feedstock, whereas the above EROEI calculation for thermal depolymerization process (TDP) does not.

The process breaks down almost all materials that are fed into it. TDP even efficiently breaks down many types of hazardous materials, such as [[poison]]s and difficult-to-destroy biological agents such as [[prion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Andrew A.|last2=Vogel|first2=Frédéric|last3=Lachance|first3=Russell P.|last4=Fröling|first4=Morgan|last5=Antal, Jr.|first5=Michael J.|last6=Tester|first6=Jefferson W.|title=Thermochemical biofuel production in hydrothermal media: A review of sub- and supercritical water technologies|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|date=2008|volume=1|issue=1|page=35|doi=10.1039/B810100K|citeseerx=10.1.1.467.3674}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=I have not heard anything about this.

===Carthage plant products===
As reported on 04/02/2006 by [[Discover (magazine)|Discover Magazine]], a [[Carthage, Missouri]] plant was producing {{convert|500|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} of oil made from 270 tons of turkey entrails and 20 tons of hog lard. This represents an oil yield of 22.3 percent. The Carthage plant produces API 40+, a high value crude oil. It contains light and heavy [[naphtha]]s, a [[kerosene]], and a [[gas oil]] fraction, with essentially no heavy fuel oils, tars, asphaltenes or waxes. It can be further refined to produce No. 2 and No. 4 [[fuel oil]]s.

The fixed carbon solids produced by the TDP process have multiple uses as a filter, a fuel source and a fertilizer. It can be used as activated carbon in [[wastewater]] treatment, as a fertilizer, or as a fuel similar to [[coal]].

==Advantages==
The process can break down organic poisons, due to breaking chemical bonds and destroying the molecular shape needed for the poison's activity. It is likely to be highly effective at killing pathogens, including [[prion]]s.{{Citation needed|reason=I have not heard anything about this. PrPSc does not break down by burning and I have not heard anything about high pressure and temperature (autoclaving does not work|date=September 2011}} It can also safely remove [[heavy metals]] from the samples by converting them from their ionized or organometallic forms to their stable oxides which can be safely separated from the other products.

Along with similar processes, it is a method of recycling the energy content of organic materials without first removing the water. It can produce liquid fuel, which separates from the water physically without need for drying. Other methods to recover energy often require pre-drying (e.g. [[burning]], [[pyrolysis]]) or produce gaseous products (e.g. [[anaerobic digestion]]).

==Potential sources of waste inputs==
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates that in 2006 there were 251 million tons of municipal solid [[waste]], or 4.6 pounds generated per day per person in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/muncpl/facts.htm Municipal Solid Waste - Basic Facts]&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this mass is considered unsuitable for oil conversion.

==Limitations==
The process only breaks long molecular chains into shorter ones, so small molecules such as [[carbon dioxide]] or [[methane]] cannot be converted to oil through this process. However, the methane in the feedstock is recovered and burned to heat the water that is an essential part of the process. In addition, the gas can be burned in a [[Cogeneration|combined heat and power plant]], consisting of a [[gas turbine]] which drives a generator to create electricity, and a heat exchanger to heat the process input water from the exhaust gas. The electricity can be sold to the power grid, for example under a [[feed-in tariff]] scheme. This also increases the overall efficiency of the process (already said to be over 85% of feedstock energy content).

Another option is to sell the methane product as [[biogas]]. For example, biogas can be compressed, much like [[compressed natural gas|natural gas]], and used to power [[Alternative fuel vehicle|motor vehicles]].

Many agricultural and animal wastes could be processed, but many of these are already used as [[fertilizer]], animal feed, and, in some cases, as feedstocks for [[paper mill]]s or as [[boiler]] fuel. [[Energy crop]]s constitute another potentially large feedstock for thermal depolymerization.

==Current status==
Reports in 2004 claimed that the Carthage facility was selling products at 10% below the price of equivalent oil, but its production costs were low enough that it produced a profit. At the time it was paying for turkey waste (see also below).

The plant then consumed 270 tons of turkey offal (the full output of the turkey processing plant) and 20 tons of egg production waste daily. In February 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Carthage plant was producing about {{convert|400|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} of crude oil.

In April 2005 the plant was reported to be running at a loss. Further 2005 reports summarized some economic setbacks which the Carthage plant encountered since its planning stages. It was thought that concern over mad cow disease would prevent the use of turkey waste and other animal products as cattle feed, and thus this waste would be free. As it turned out, turkey waste may still be used as feed in the United States, so that the facility must purchase that feed stock at a cost of $30 to $40 per ton, adding $15 to $20 per barrel to the cost of the oil. Final cost, as of January 2005, was $80/barrel ($1.90/gal).

The above cost of production also excludes the operating cost of the thermal oxidizer and scrubber added in May 2005 in response to odor complaints (see below).

A biofuel tax credit of roughly $1 per US gallon (26 ¢/L) on production costs was not available because the oil produced did not meet the definition of "biodiesel" according to the relevant American tax legislation. The [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] specifically added thermal depolymerization to a $1 renewable diesel credit, which became effective at the end of 2005, allowing a profit of $4/barrel of output oil.

===Company expansion===
The company has explored expansion in California, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, and is presently examining projects in Europe, where animal products cannot be used as cattle feed. TDP is also being considered as an alternative means for sewage treatment in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/andrewkantor/2004-01-22-kantor_x.htm |title=Killing germs, reducing waste, making oil: TDP might be the next big thing |accessdate=2007-02-21 |last=Kantor |first=Andrew |date= 2004-01-23 |work=[[USA Today]] |quote=The City of Philadelphia currently turns a lot of its sewage sludge into landfill. (All together now: Eww.) But working with Changing World, the city is planning a TDP project to divert that sludge — and whatever pathogens are living in it — away from the land and into oil. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smell complaints===
The pilot plant in Carthage was temporarily shut down due to smell complaints. It was soon restarted when it was discovered that few of the odors were generated by the plant.&lt;ref&gt;Reported by the Kansas City Star, April 12, 2005. The Kansas City Star website has since archived this article: [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?s_dispstring=(turkey-to-oil)%20AND%20date(2005) Kansas City: Search results]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the plant agreed to install an enhanced thermal oxidizer and to upgrade its [[air scrubber]] system under a court order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ago.mo.gov/lawsuits/2005/050605rescarthage.pdf In the circuit court of Jasper country, Missouri, at Carthage]&lt;br /&gt; "The company said it has finished installation of a thermal oxidizer and upgraded odor scrubber system that were ordered as part of a consent agreement with the city and the Missouri attorney general's office." [http://www.joplinglobe.com/story.php?story_id=188739&amp;c=87 City questions RES]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the plant is located only four blocks from the tourist-attracting town center, this has strained relations with the mayor and citizens of Carthage.

According to a company spokeswoman, the plant has received complaints even on days when it is not operating. She also contended that the odors may not have been produced by their facility, which is located near several other agricultural processing plants.&lt;ref&gt;"A plant spokeswoman, Julie Gelfand, tells the Pitch that repeated odor complaints have been lodged on days when the plant wasn't in operation or when wind conditions were inconsistent with the complaints." [http://www.pitch.com/Issues/2005-11-24/news/feature_4.html Fowl &amp; Crude]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 29, 2005, the plant was ordered by the state governor to shut down once again over allegations of foul odors as reported by MSNBC.&lt;ref&gt;"A foul-smelling plant that turns turkey byproducts into fuel oil was ordered closed by the governor Wednesday until the company finds a way to clear the air." [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10636943 Turkey-oil plant closed due to foul odors.]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 7, 2006, the plant has begun limited test runs to validate it has resolved the odor issue.&lt;ref&gt;"An experimental plant that turns turkey byproducts into fuel oil can resume normal operations for 15 days to test whether new equipment solves a problem with bad smells that prompted the state to shut it down in December. [http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/local/14040813.htm Kansascity.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 24, 2006, the last lawsuit connected with the odor issue has been dismissed and the problem is acknowledged as fixed.&lt;ref&gt;"The last lawsuit left from a dispute over odors from a plant that converts turkey waste into fuel oil was dismissed Thursday after the facility fixed its odor problems."
[http://www.dfw.com/mld/dfw/business/15352930.htm Last lawsuit dropped in Carthage turkey plant odor case]&lt;/ref&gt; In late November, however, another complaint was filed over bad smells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belleville.com/mld/belleville/news/state/16029275.htm Belleville.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This complaint was closed on January 11 of 2007 with no fines assessed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnr.mo.gov/newsrel/nr07_012.htm News Release 012 - MoDNR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status as of February 2009===
A May 2003 article in Discover magazine stated, "Appel has lined up federal grant money to help build demonstration plants to process chicken offal and manure in Alabama and crop residuals and grease in Nevada. Also in the works are plants to process turkey waste and manure in Colorado and pork and cheese waste in Italy. He says the first generation of depolymerization centers will be up and running in 2005. By then it should be clear whether the technology is as miraculous as its backers claim."&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovermagazine.com/2003/may/featoil/ Anything Into Oil.] Discover magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as of August 2008, the only operational plant listed at the company's website is the initial one in Carthage, Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.changingworldtech.com/where/index.asp Changingworldtech.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Changing World Technology applied for an [[Initial public offering|IPO]] on August 12; 2008, hoping to raise $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10017027-54.html?tag=nefd.top News.Cnet.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The unusual [[Dutch Auction]] type IPO failed possibly because CWT has lost nearly $20 million with very little revenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earth2tech.com/2009/02/13/changing-world-ipo-is-a-no-go/ Earth2tech.com], changing world IPO is a no go&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/governmentFilingsNews/idUKN0130987720090201 UK.reuters.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

CWT, the parent company of Renewable Energy Solutions, filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy. No details on plans for the Carthage plant have been released.&lt;ref&gt;

In [[metaphysics]], a '''universal''' is what particular things have in common, namely characteristics or qualities. In other words, universals are repeatable or recurrent entities that can be instantiated or exemplified by many particular things.&lt;ref&gt;Price (1953); Loux (1998), p 20.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, suppose there are two chairs in a room, each of which is green. These two chairs both share the quality of "[[wikt:chairness|chairness]]", as well as greenness or the quality of being green; in other words, they share a "universal". There are three major kinds of qualities or characteristics: [[type (metaphysics)|types or kinds]] (e.g. mammal), [[property (metaphysics)|properties]] (e.g. short, strong), and [[relation (metaphysics)|relations]] (e.g. father of, next to). These are all different types of universals.&lt;ref&gt;Loux (2001), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradigmatically, universals are ''[[abstract (philosophy)|abstract]]'' (e.g. humanity), whereas [[particular]]s are ''[[concrete (philosophy)|concrete]]'' (e.g. the personhood of Socrates). However, universals are not necessarily abstract and particulars are not necessarily concrete.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez-Pereyra (2008), §1.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one might hold that numbers are [[abstract particular|particular yet abstract objects]].  Likewise, some philosophers, such as [[David Malet Armstrong|D. M. Armstrong]], consider universals to be concrete.

Most do not consider [[class (philosophy)|classes]] to be universals, although some prominent philosophers do, such as John Bigelow.

==Problem of universals==
{{Main|Problem of universals}}
''The [[problem of universals]]'' is an ancient problem in metaphysics about whether universals exist. The problem arises from attempts to account for the phenomenon of similarity or attribute agreement among things.&lt;ref&gt;Loux (1998), p. 20; (2001), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[grass]] and [[Granny Smith|Granny Smith apples]] are similar or agree in attribute, namely in having the attribute of greenness. The issue is how to account for this sort of agreement in attribute among things.

There are many philosophical positions regarding universals. Taking "beauty" as an example, three positions are:
* [[Idealism]] or [[conceptualism]]: beauty is a property constructed in the mind, so it exists only in descriptions of things.
* Platonic realism: beauty is a property that exists in an ideal form independently of any mind or thing.
* Aristotelian realism: beauty is a property that only exists when beautiful things exist.

Taking a broader view, the main positions are generally considered classifiable as: [[Philosophical realism|realism]], [[nominalism]], and [[idealism]] (sometimes simply named "anti-realism" with regard to universals).&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein (2006), §3.&lt;/ref&gt; Realists posit the existence of independent, abstract universals to account for attribute agreement. Nominalists deny that universals exist, claiming that they are not necessary to explain attribute agreement. Conceptualists posit that universals exist only in the [[philosophy of mind|mind]], or when conceptualized, denying the independent existence of universals. Complications which arise include the implications of language use and the complexity of relating language to [[ontology]].

==Particular==
{{Main|Particular}}
A universal may have instances, known as its ''particulars''. For example, the type ''dog'' (or ''doghood'') is a universal, as are the property ''red'' (or ''redness'') and the relation ''betweenness'' (or ''being between''). Any particular dog, red thing, or object that is between other things is not a universal, however, but is an ''instance'' of a universal. That is, a universal type (''doghood''), property (''redness''), or relation (''betweenness'') ''[[Substance theory#Inherence|inheres]]'' in a particular object (a specific dog, red thing, or object between other things).

==Platonic realism==
[[Platonic realism]] holds universals to be the [[referent]]s of general terms, such as the ''[[abstraction|abstract]]'', nonphysical, non-mental entities to which words such as "sameness", "circularity", and "beauty" refer. Particulars are the referents of proper names, such as "Phaedo," or of definite descriptions that identify single objects, such as the phrase, "that bed over there". Other metaphysical theories may use the terminology of universals to describe physical entities.

Plato's examples of what we might today call universals included mathematical and geometrical ideas such as a circle and natural numbers as universals.  Plato's views on universals did, however, vary across several different discussions. In some cases, Plato spoke as if the perfect circle functioned as the [[substantial form|form]] or blueprint for all copies and for the word definition of ''circle''. In other discussions, Plato describes particulars as "participating" in the associated universal.

Contemporary realists agree with the thesis that universals are multiply-exemplifiable entities. Examples include by D. M. Armstrong, Nicholas Wolterstorff, Reinhardt Grossmann, Michael Loux.

==Nominalism==
Nominalists hold that universals are not real mind-independent entities but either merely concepts (sometimes called "conceptualism") or merely names. Nominalists typically argue that properties are abstract particulars (like tropes) rather than universals. [[JP Moreland]] distinguishes between "extreme" and "moderate" nominalism.&lt;ref&gt;Moreland (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of nominalists include the medieval philosophers [[Roscelin of Compiègne]] and [[William of Ockham]] and contemporary philosophers [[W.

The '''ness-ity-hood principle'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is used mainly by English-speaking philosophers to generate convenient, concise names for universals or [[Property (philosophy)|properties]].&lt;ref&gt;Feldman (2005), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Ness-Ity-Hood Principle, a name for any universal may be formed that is distinctive, "of left-handers" may be formed by taking the predicate "left-handed" and adding "ness", which yields the name "left-handedness".  The principle is most helpful in cases where there is not an established or standard name of the universal in ordinary English usage:  What is the name of the universal distinctive of chairs?  "Chair" in English is used not only as a subject (as in "The chair is broken"), but also as a predicate (as in "That is a chair").  So to generate a name for the universal distinctive of chairs, take the predicate "chair" and add "ness", which yields "chairness".

'''Vithal Mahadeo Tarkunde''' (3 July 1909 in [[Saswad]] – 22 March 2004 in [[Delhi]]), was a prominent Indian lawyer, civil rights activist, and humanist leader and has been referred to as the "Father of the Civil Liberties movement" in India and a former judge of the Bombay High Court&lt;ref name="Outlook"&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?223371 Outlook MAR 24, 2004 TRIBUTE – Father Of Civil Liberties In India]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PUCL Bulletin Special Issue Justice Tarkunde: Vol. XXVII, No. 3 {{ISSN|0970-8693}} MARCH 2007 ("''This is a special number of the PUCL Bulletin dedicated to the memory of V M Tarkunde, the doyen of the Civil Liberties Movement in India''")&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court of India also praised him as "undoubtedly the most distinguished judge of the post-[[M. C. Chagla|Chagla]] 1957 period" in the [[Bombay High Court]].&lt;ref name="court"&gt;Full Court Reference in memory of Late Shri V M Tarkunde,Senior Advocate, on Wednesday, 7 April 2004 in the Supreme Court of India Address by Soli J Sorabjee Attorney General for India&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Vithal Mahadeo Tarkunde was born in [[Saswad]], [[Pune District]], Maharashtra on 3 July 1909. He was the 2nd of the five children of Mahadeo Rajaram Tarkunde, a popular lawyer and social reformer at [[Saswad]],then headquarters of [[Purandar taluka]] adjoining Pune. His father, a [[Brahmin]] by caste, had fought against the practice of [[untouchability]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;A Restless Crusader for Human Rights – M A Rane, PUCL Bulletin Special Issue Justice Tarkunde: Vol. XXVII, No. 3 {{ISSN|0970-8693}} MARCH 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920 he migrated from Saswad to Pune and joined the New English School, Pune. In the Matriculation examination of 1925 held by the [[Bombay University]], he stood first in the erstwhile [[Bombay Presidency]]. He also secured the prestigious Jagannath Shankersheth Scholarship for Sanskrit. He then joined the [[Fergusson College]] for BA which he completed in 1929, subsequently moving to London, where he attended the Lincoln's Inn and qualified as a [[Barrister-at-Law]] in 1931. He also attended lectures in economics, political science and social anthropology at the [[London School of Economics]](LSE) as an external student. He returned to India the next year in December and commenced his legal practice in Pune.&lt;ref name="court"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Author Overview – Voice of A Great Sentinel: Selected Writings of V.M. Tarkunde – 1 January 2004 , 1st ed. – Renaissance Publishers Pvt. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inmemoriam"&gt;[http://www.pucl.org/Topics/PUCL/2004/tarkunde-condolence4.htm  In Memoriam, Justice V.M. Tarkunde (1909–2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal career==

Tarkunde started practice at Pune soon after he returned to India in 1933. He continued there till 1942 when he gave up his practice to become a full-time member of the [[Radical Democratic Party (India)|Radical Democratic Party]]. He resumed his legal practice in the [[Bombay High Court]] in 1948 after [[Independence of India|Independence]] and was elevated to the bench as a Judge of the [[Bombay High Court]] in September 1957. He stepped down voluntarily as Judge of the Bombay High Court in 1969 and set up practice in the [[Supreme Court of India]] where he continued till his resignation in 1977 at the age of 68. He was chiefly concerned with [[Public Interest Litigation]]s and constitutional cases, most of which he conducted with little or no fees.&lt;ref name="inmemoriam"/&gt;

==Activism==
In 1933, he joined the [[Congress Socialist Party]](CSP) and the [[Indian National Congress]] but later left the CSP disillusioned with their vote against [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] in the January 1939 Tripuri session of Congress. He then joined the League of Radical Congressmen led by his mentor [[M. N. Roy]] in April 1939.&lt;ref&gt;"Why I left the Congress", Through Humanist Eyes Vithal Mahadev Tarkunde.1st ed. New Delhi, Ajanta Publications,1997&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, Roy and Tarkunde, along with several others, left the Congress after dissenting on the question of participation in the [[Second World War]]. Roy advocated participation in the war against the [[Axis powers]], while simultaneously striving for Indian independence, and founded the [[Radical Democratic Party (India)|Radical Democratic Party]] to further this cause.In 1942, Tarkunde gave up his legal practice to become a full-time member of the [[Radical Democratic Party (India)|Radical Democratic Party]] and was elected General Secretary of the RDP in 1944, thereby migrating to Delhi. By 1946 Roy formulated the philosophy of New Humanism. By 1948 he and Roy decided that political parties were an inadequate instrument for promoting freedom of the people and so dissolved the RDP in December 1948. He returned to legal practice the same year.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Radical Humanism==

In 1969, Tarkunde founded the Indian Radical Humanist Association as an organisation for radical humanists. He also began editing the ''Radical Humanist'' (founded in 1937 by Roy as ''Independent India'') in April 1970, supporting it initially with his own income. In 1973 he was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II|Humanist Manifesto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II | title=Humanist Manifesto II | publisher=American Humanist Association | accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergency==

During the [[Indian Emergency|emergency]], he worked closely with [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], providing leadership to the NGOs Citizens for Democracy and [[People's Union for Civil Liberties]], of which he was the founding president. He also worked on the [[Citizen's Justice Committee]] and played a principal part in resisting and investigating the excesses of the period, including the [[1984 Anti-Sikh riots]],&lt;ref&gt;Judge V.M. Tarkunde, et al., Oppression in Punjab: Report to the Nation, New Delhi: Citizens for Democracy, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; and human rights violations in the Punjab, Kashmir, and the North-East.&lt;ref name="Outlook"/&gt; His refusal to consider kashmiri pandits who had fled valley in 1990 as human right victims caused much controversy and led to his dubbing as " Terrorists' defender in chief" as he regularly attacked Indian army for fake encounters and extra judicial killings.In 1995, he departed from his earlier stand of considering firing by police as human rights violation and defended UP government in Muzaffarnagar police firing and rape on Uttarakhand state demand activists on 2 October 1994 in Supreme Court.His volte face was noted by honourable bench with humour and he won the case with court ruling that there was not adequate evidence of wilful human rights violation by State government.But it led to his breaking ranks with radical humanists.

Tarkunde was a board member for the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]([[IHEU]]), the world union of Humanist organisations for over 40 years.&lt;ref name="iheu"&gt;[http://www.iheu.org/glossary/term/372?Array IHEU Glossary VM Tarkunde]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==

At the 1978 London Congress of the [[IHEU]], VM Tarkunde received the International Humanist Award 1978.&lt;ref name="iheu"/&gt; The Government of India awarded him the civilian honour of the [[Padma Bhushan]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf | title=Padma Awards | publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India | date=2015 | accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sanskrit]] word, '''Vidya''', figures prominently in all texts pertaining to [[Indian philosophy]] - to mean science, learning, knowledge and scholarship; most importantly, it refers to valid knowledge which cannot be contradicted and true knowledge which is the knowledge of the Self intuitively gained. ''Vidya'' is not mere intellectual knowledge, for the [[Vedas]] demand understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophy of the Upanishads|author=Archibald Edward Gough|publisher=Trubner &amp; Co.|page=48|url= https://archive.org/details/philosophyofupan00gouguoft }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==

'''Vidya''' or ''vidyā'' ([[Sanskrit]]: विद्या) primarily means science, learning, philosophy, knowledge, scholarship, any knowledge whether true or false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spokensanskrit.de Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url= http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its root is ''Vid'' ([[Sanskrit]]: विद्) which means - to reason upon, knower, finding, knowing, acquiring or understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spokensanskrit.de Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url= http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=vid+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevance==

In [[Hindu philosophy]], '' Vidyā'' refers to the knowledge of the soul or spiritual knowledge;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=The Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=325|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.1.apte.694114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it refers to the study of the six schools of Hindu philosophy – [[Nyaya]], [[Yoga]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Mīmāṃsā|Purvamimamsa]] and [[Vedanta|Uttaramimamsa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Going to school in South Asia|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=75|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LQcBMtetBDkC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DITQU_mCBcm1uATD8YK4Cg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of gaining the knowledge of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] cannot commence unless one has explored the ''Prānavidya'' or ''Agnividya''  to the full in all its numerous phase; through ''vidyā'' or '' [[upasana]] '' to ''[[jnana]] '' was always the eternal order indicated by the Upanishads. ''Jnāna'' dawns after the completion and perfection of the being through the ''vidyās''; then, one crosses over beyond birth and death having already destroyed the bonds of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Commentary on the Katha Upanishad (Verses I.1.17/18)|author=Swami Krishnananda|pages=20, 21|url= http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/katha1/Commentary_on_Katha_Upanishad.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==

During the [[Vedic]] period, ''Vidyādāna'' or the gift for the sake of education was considered to be the best of gifts, possessing a higher religious efficacy than even the gift of land. ''Vidyā'' comes from the root ''Vid'' ('to know'), it therefore means knowledge, science, learning, lore, scholarship and philosophy. There are basically four ''Vidyas'' – 1) ''Trayi'' (triple) which is the study of the [[Vedas]] and their auxiliary texts, 2) ''[[Anviksiki]]'' which is logic and metaphysics, 3) ''Dandaniti'' which is the science of government, and 4) ''Varum'', the practical arts such as agriculture, commerce, medicine etc. ''Vidyā'' gives insight, in the spiritual sphere it leads to salvation, in the mundane sphere it leads to progress and prosperity. ''Vidyā'' illuminates the mind and shatters illusions, increases intelligence, power and efficiency; develops the intellect and makes it more re-fined; it effects a complete transformation as the root of all happiness and as the source of illumination and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Aryans ti Swaraj|author=S.R.Bakshi|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|pages=11 to 15|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ldo1QtQigosC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8oXQU5qaEcOJuASwjIDIDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word, ''Vidyā'', does not occur in the [[Rig Veda]], it occurs in the [[Atharvaveda]] and in the [[Brahmana]] portions of the [[Yajurveda]] and in the [[Upanishads]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Devi Mahatmya|author=Thomas B.Coburn|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=189|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hy9kf7_TOHgC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q5bQU4KyN9OeugS1pIGIBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tantra==

In [[Hinduism]], Goddesses are personifications of the deepest level of power and energy. The concept of [[Shakti]], in its most abstract terms, relates to the energetic principle of Ultimate Reality, the dynamic aspect of the divine. This concept surfaces in the [[Kena Upanishad]] as Goddess Umā bestowing ''Brahma-vidya'' on [[Indra]]; when linked with ''shakti'' and ''maya'', she embodies the power of illusion (''maya''), encompassing ignorance (''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]]'') and knowledge (''vidyā'') and thereby presented with a dual personality. According to the Saktas, [[Maya (Illusion)|Māyā]] is basically a positive, creative, magical energy of the Goddess that brings forth the universe. The ten ''Mahāvidyās''  are bestowers or personifications of transcendent and liberating religious knowledge; the term ''Vidyā'' in this context refers to power, essence of reality and the ''mantras''. The gentle and motherly forms of Goddess Sri Vidyā are 'right-handed'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hindu Goddesses: Beliefs and Practices|author=Lynn Foulston|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|pages=9,14,115,|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XgwVgPx5G5UC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=sri+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LrbQU5juHcu8ugSUsILoDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=sri%20vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the awareness of the 'exterior' ([[Shiva]]) combined with the "I" encompasses the entire space as "I" it is called ''sada-siva-tattva''. When later, discarding the abstraction of the Self and the exterior, clear identification with the insentient space takes place, it is called ''isvara-tattva''; the investigation of these two last steps is pure ''vidyā'' (knowledge).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tripura Rahasya|publisher=world Wisdom|page=89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SOpi_CkDfKQC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=X4PQU_a4IdKzuAS3pYHwCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Māyā'', which has been identified with ''[[Prakrti]]'' in the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] represents its three ''[[guna]]s''; also identified with ''avidyā'', which term primarily means the dark abyss of non-being and secondarily the mysterious darkness of the unmanifest state, ''Māyā'' binds through ''avidyā'' and releases through ''vidyā'' .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Taittiriya Upanishad (Verse III.2)|publisher=The Ramakrishna Math|page=13|url=http://www.estudantedavedanta.net/Taittiriya%20Upanishad%20-%20Swami%20Sarvanand%20[Sanskrit-English].pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist belief==

In [[Mahayana]] texts, the female divinities are designated grammatically feminine terms ''Dhārāni'' and ''Vidyā''. ''Dharani'' refers to [[mantra]]s, the sounds that carry the essence or energy of a deity, which enable contact with the goddess on her plane of reality because the mantras invoke all deities. ''Vidyā'' is also synonymous with mantra and refers to the mantric invocation of female deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhist Goddesses of India|author=Miranda Eberie Shaw|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MvDKOK1h3zMC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=X4PQU_a4IdKzuAS3pYHwCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tibet]], the word, ''[[rigpa]]'' , meaning ''vidyā'', refers to the non-dualistic awareness or intrinsic awareness. In [[Theravada Buddhism]], ''vidyā'' means 'non-dual awareness' of [[three marks of existence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Three Characteristics of Existence|publisher=Maithri Publications|url= http://www.maithri.com/links/articles/tri_lakshana1.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reflections in a mirror|author=Charlie Singer|publisher=iUniverse|pages=15, 49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=myZdqZhmAwIC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8oXQU5qaEcOJuASwjIDIDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agni Vidyā==

''Agni Vidyā'' or the science of Fire is said to be the greatest discovery of the ancient Indians who gained direct experience of divine fire through continuous research, contemplation, observation and experimentation; their experience led them to discover ways of using this knowledge to heal and nurture the outer and the inner worlds. To them fire is sacred, and because of the pervasive nature of fire all things are sacred. Body and mind which are extensions of the fire that the soul spontaneously emits are also sacred. Within the body the most significant centres of fire are more subtle than those of the sense organs. They are called the ''chakras'' which are seven fields of sacred fire. The understanding of the role of fire without and within gives proper self-understanding which understanding is gained through yogic practices. The performance of [[yajna]]s is the ''karma-kānda'' aspect of ''agni vidyā''. All rituals follow set rules and conditions. The main function of the fire ritual is to make an offering to nature’s finest forces and divinities that fill the space of inner consciousness; fire carries oblations to these forces and divinities. The fire has seven tongues all having unique qualities. The gods, goddesses, divinities and nature’s forces are grouped in seven main categories which match with the qualities of the seven tongues of fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pursuit of Power and Freedom|publisher=Himalayan Institute Press|pages=33, 34, 38, 39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ph55FuAfQ7AC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pYXQU-agGNeiugS9wILwCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Atmaikatva==

''Atmaikatva'' or the absolute oneness of the self is the theme of entire [[Advaita Vedanta]] which distinguishes six ''[[pramana]]s'' or means of valid knowledge, but this ''vidyā'' or knowledge of [[Brahman]] is ''guhahita'', ''gahavareshta'' i.e. set in the secret place and hidden in its depth, unattainable except through ''adhyātma-yoga'', the meditation centering upon the nature of the self. Vedanta literature is only preparatory to it, it dispels ignorance and makes the mind receptive but does not reveal the truth therefore it is an indirect means of knowledge. The oneness of the self, which is self-established and self-shining, is called ''vidyā'' in cosmic reference which reveals the true nature of [[Brahman]], the self-shining pure consciousness which is not a ''visaya'' ('object matter or content') but the one subject, transcendent of all conventional subjects and objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Sankar’s Advaita Vedanta|author=S.K.chattopadhyaya|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPasbJW-1PwC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=To_QU-SoEYqHuATuiILYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Self or the Atman is to be sought, the Self is to be enquired into, known and understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chandogy Upanishad (Verse VIII.vii.1)|page=446|url= https://archive.org/details/Shankara.Bhashya-Chandogya.Upanishad-Ganganath.Jha.1942.English }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hierarchy of knowledge==

The sage of the [[Mundaka Upanishad]](Verse I.1.4), more in the context of the ritualistic than of epistemological concerns, states that there are two kinds of knowledge (''vidyā'') to be attained, the higher (''para'') and the lower (''apara''). ''[[Para Vidya|Para vidyā]]'', the higher knowledge, is knowledge of the Absolute ([[Brahman]], [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]]); ''Apara'', the lower knowledge, is knowledge of the world – of objects, events, means, ends, virtues and vices. ''Para vidyā'' has Reality as its content; ''Apara vidyā'', the phenomenal world. According to Advaita Vedanta, ''Para vidyā'', by the nature of its content, possesses a unique quality of ultimacy that annuls any supposed ultimacy that might be attached to any other or form of knowledge, and is intuitively gained as self-certifying. Once Brahman is realized all other modes of knowledge are seen to be touched by ''avidyā'', the root of ignorance. In this context, ''Vidyā'' means true knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advaita Vedanta: A Philosophical Re-construction|author=Eliot Deutsch|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=63gdKwhHeV0C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q5bQU4KyN9OeugS1pIGIBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, it is argued that the Advaita Vedanta interpretation does not answer the final question: what is the reality or truth-value of ''avidyā'' or what is the substratum that is the basis or cause of ''avidyā''?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Indian Interpreters of the Bhagavad Gita|publisher=SUNY Press|page=181|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ku2DGm20WWUC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;dq=vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DITQU_mCBcm1uATD8YK4Cg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vidya&amp;f=false  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valid knowledge==

The Upanishads teach us that the knowledge of difference is ''avidyā'' or ignorance, and the knowledge of identity is true knowledge or ''vidyā'' or valid knowledge, which leads to life eternal. For the [[Cārvāka]]s, perception is the only means of valid knowledge (''pramana''). Vadi Deva Suri of the [[Jainism|Jaina school]] defines valid knowledge as determinate cognition which apprehends itself and an object and which is capable of prompting activity which attains a desirable object or rejects an undesirable object; the result of valid knowledge is cessation of ignorance. [[Vaisheshika]]s recognized four kinds of valid knowledge – Perception, Inference, Recollection and Intuition. The Mimamsa schools introduced the concept of intrinsic validity of knowledge (''svatahpramanya'') and extrinsic validity of knowledge (''parastah-apramana'') but agreed that the validity of knowledge cannot be determined by the knowledge of any special excellence in its cause or the knowledge of its harmony with the real nature of its object or the knowledge of a fruitful action. [[Adi Shankara|Sankara]] accepted perception, inference, scriptural testimony, comparison, presumption and non-apprehension as the six sources of knowledge and concluded that the knowledge which corresponds with the real nature of its object is valid. The Atman is the reality in the empirical self as the ever present foundational subject-objectless universal consciousness which sustains the empirical self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outlines of Indian Philosophy|author=Jadunath Sinha|publisher=Pilgrim Books|pages=16,120,162,319,368|url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Outlines_of_Indian_Philosophy.html?id=99aBngEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

In ''upāsanā'' the movement starts from the outer extremities and gradually penetrates into the inmost recesses of the soul, and the whole investigation is conducted in two spheres, in the subject as well as in the object, in the individual as well as in the world, in the ''aham'' as also in the '' [[idam]] '', in the ''adhyātma'' and also in ''adhidaiva'' spheres and conducted synthetically as well as analytically, through ''apti'' as well as ''samrddhi'', which the [[Bhagavad Gita]] calls '' [[yoga]] '' and '' [[vibhooti]] ''. The ''vidyās'' do not rest content in knowing the reality simply as a whole but proceed further to comprehend it in all its infinite details too. The higher includes the lower grades and adds something more to it and never rejects it; the lower has its fulfilment in the higher and finds its consummation there but never faces extinction. All forms of contemplation have only one aim: to lead to the Supreme Knowledge and hence they are termed as ''vidyās''; through ''vidyā'', which is ''amrta'', one attains immortality ([[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] Verse V.1). ''[[Dahara-vidya|Dahara Vidyā]]'', ''Udgitha Vidyā'' and ''[[Madhu-vidya|Madhu Vidyā]]'' are the synthetic way whereas the analytic way is signified by the Sleeping man of the ''Garga-Ajātsatru'' episode and by the Five Sheaths, which ways show that the world and the individual spring from the same eternal source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in the Upanishads|author=Govindagopal Mukhopadhyaya|publisher=Pilgrims Book|pages=171, 175|url= http://www.abebooks.com/Studies-Upanishads-Govindagopal-Mukhopadhyaya-Pilgrims-Publishing/12423632861/bd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5365">In [[mathematics]], '''Vopěnka's principle''' is a [[large cardinal]] axiom. 
The intuition behind the axiom is that the set-theoretical universe is so large that in every [[proper class]], some members are similar to others, with this similarity formalized through [[elementary embedding]]s.

Vopěnka's principle was first introduced by [[Petr Vopěnka]] and independently considered by [[H. Jerome Keisler]], and was written up by {{harvtxt|Solovay|Reinhardt|Kanamori|1978}}.
According to {{harvtxt|Pudlák|2013|loc=p. 204}}, Vopěnka's principle was originally intended as a joke: Vopěnka was apparently unenthusiastic about large cardinals and introduced his principle as a bogus large cardinal property, planning to show later that it was not consistent. However, before publishing his inconsistency proof he found a flaw in it.

==Definition==

Vopěnka's principle asserts that for every [[proper class]] of [[binary relation]]s (each with set-sized domain), there is one [[elementary embedding|elementarily embeddable]] into another. This cannot be stated as a single sentence of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] as it involves a quantification over classes.  A cardinal κ is called a '''Vopěnka cardinal''' if it is [[inaccessible cardinal|inaccessible]] and Vopěnka's principle holds in the rank ''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt; (allowing arbitrary ''S'' ⊂ ''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt; as "classes").
&lt;ref name="Kan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kanamori|first1=Akihiro||author-link=Akihiro Kanamori|title=The higher infinite: large cardinals in set theory from their beginnings|date=2003|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin [u.a.]|isbn=9783540003847|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many equivalent formulations are possible.
For example, Vopěnka's principle is equivalent to each of the following statements. 
* For every proper class of [[Directed graph|simple directed graphs]], there are two members of the class with a homomorphism between them.&lt;ref name="AdR"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosicky|first1=Jiří Adámek ; Jiří|title=Locally presentable and accessible categories|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=0521422612|edition=Digital print. 2004.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For any [[Signature (logic)|signature]] ''Σ'' and any proper class of ''Σ''-structures, there are two members of the class with an elementary embedding between them.&lt;ref name="Kan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AdR" /&gt;
* For every predicate ''P'' and proper class ''S'' of [[ordinal number|ordinals]], there is a non-trivial elementary embedding ''j'':(''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt;, ∈, ''P'') → (V&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;, ∈, ''P'') for some κ and λ in ''S''.&lt;ref name="Kan" /&gt;
* The [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of ordinals cannot be fully embedded in the category of graphs.&lt;ref name="AdR" /&gt;
* Every subfunctor of an [[Accessible category|accessible functor]] is accessible.&lt;ref name="AdR" /&gt;
* (In a definable classes setting) For every natural number ''n'', there exists a [[Extendible cardinal#Variants and relation to other cardinals|''C&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;''-extendible cardinal]].&lt;ref name="Bag"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bagaria|first1=Joan|title=''C&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;''-cardinals|journal=Archive for Mathematical Logic|date=23 December 2011|volume=51|issue=3–4|pages=213–240|doi=10.1007/s00153-011-0261-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strength==

Even when restricted to predicates and proper classes definable in first order set theory, the principle implies existence of Σ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; correct [[extendible cardinal]]s for every ''n''.

If κ is an [[huge cardinal|almost huge cardinal]], then a strong form of Vopěnka's principle holds in ''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt;:

:There is a  κ-complete [[ultrafilter]] ''U'' such that for every {''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;κ} where each ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a binary relation and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt;, there is ''S''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''U'' and a non-trivial elementary embedding ''j'': ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; for every ''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''b'' in ''S''.

[[File:Locotypes.gif|thumb|upright|A selection of early 20th century locomotive types according to their Whyte notation and their comparative size]]
[[File:Locomotive classification--Colvin 1906--300dpi.jpg|thumb|upright|Whyte notation from a handbook for railroad industry workers published in 1906&lt;ref name="railroad pocket-book"&gt;{{cite book| last=Colvin| first=Fred H.| authorlink=Fred H.

The '''Whyte notation''' for classifying [[steam locomotive]]s by [[wheel arrangement]] was devised by [[Frederick Methvan Whyte]],&lt;ref name="steam glossary" /&gt; and came into use in the early twentieth century following a December 1900 editorial in ''American Engineer and Railroad Journal''. The notation counts the number of [[leading wheel]]s, then the number of [[driving wheel]]s, and finally the number of [[trailing wheel]]s, groups of numbers being separated by dashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.trains.com/trn/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=201| title=Builder's plates: A locomotive's birth certificate| publisher=[[Kalmbach Publishing]]| author=Thompson, Keith| date=2006-05-01| accessdate=2008-02-08| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122011919/http://www.trains.com/trn/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=201| archivedate=22 November 2008| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other classification schemes, like [[UIC classification]] and the French, Turkish and [[Swiss locomotive and railcar classification|Swiss]] systems for steam locomotives, count axles rather than wheels.

In the notation a locomotive with two leading axles (four wheels) in front, then three driving axles (six wheels) and then one trailing axle (two wheels) is classified as [[4-6-2]], and is commonly known as a ''Pacific''.

== Method ==

=== Articulated locomotives ===
[[Articulated locomotive]]s such as [[Garratt]]s, which are effectively two locomotives joined by a common [[boiler]], have a + between the arrangements of each engine. Thus a "double Pacific" type Garratt is a 4-6-2+2-6-4.  For Garratt locomotives the + sign is used even when there are no intermediate unpowered wheels, e.g. the [[LMS Garratt]] [[2-6-0+0-6-2]].  This is because the two engine units are more than just [[power bogie]]s. They are complete engines, carrying fuel and water tanks. The + sign represents the bridge (carrying the boiler) that links the two engines.

Simpler articulated types such as [[Mallet (locomotive)|Mallet]]s, have a jointed frame under a common boiler where there are no unpowered wheels between the sets of powered wheels. Typically, the forward frame is free to swing, whereas the rear frame is rigid with the boiler. Thus a [[Union Pacific Big Boy]] is a 4-8-8-4; four leading wheels, one group of eight driving wheels, another group of eight driving wheels, and then four trailing wheels.

=== Duplex locomotives ===
This numbering system is shared by [[Duplex locomotive|duplex locomotives]], which have powered wheel sets sharing a rigid frame.

=== Suffixes ===
No suffix means a [[tender locomotive]].

T indicates a [[tank locomotive]]: in European practice, this is sometimes extended to indicate the type of tank locomotive: T means [[side tank]], PT [[pannier tank]], ST [[Saddle tank (locomotive)|saddle tank]], WT [[well tank]]. T+T means a tank locomotive that also has a tender.

In Europe, the suffix R can signify rack (0-6-0RT) or reversible (0-6-0TR), the latter being ''Bi-cabine'' locomotives used in France.

The suffix F indicates a [[fireless locomotive]] (0-4-0F). This locomotive has no tender.

Other suffixes have been used, including ng for [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] (less than {{RailGauge|1435mm}} ) and CA or ca for compressed air (running on compressed air from a tank instead of steam from a boiler).

=== Internal combustion locomotives ===
In Britain, small diesel and [[gasoline|petrol]] locomotives are usually classified in the same way as steam locomotives, e.g. 0-4-0, 0-6-0, 0-8-0. This may be followed by D for diesel or P for petrol, and another letter describing the transmission: E for electric, H hydraulic, M mechanical. Thus, 0-6-0DE denotes a six-wheel diesel locomotive with electric transmission. Where the axles are coupled by chains or shafts (rather than side rods) or are individually driven, the terms 4w, 6w or 8w are generally used. Thus, 4wPE indicates a four-wheel petrol locomotive with electric transmission. For large diesel locomotives the [[UIC classification]] is used.

== Limitations ==
The main limitation of Whyte Notation is that it does not cover non-standard types such as [[Shay locomotive]]s, which use geared trucks rather than driving wheels. The most commonly used system in Europe outside the United Kingdom is UIC classification, based on German practice, which can define the exact layout of a locomotive.

== Naming ==
In American (and to a lesser extent British) practice, most wheel arrangements in common use were given names, sometimes from the name of the first such locomotive built. For example, the [[2-2-0]] type arrangement is named ''Planet'', after [[Planet (locomotive)|the 1830 locomotive]] on which it was first used. (This naming convention is similar to the naming of warship classes.)

=== Common wheel arrangements ===
The most common wheel arrangements are listed below. In the diagrams, the front of the locomotive is to the left.
