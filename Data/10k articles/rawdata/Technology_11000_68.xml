      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4734">'''Abel Bliss''', Jr. was born on August 8, 1853. His father, Abel Bliss, Sr., was a native of [[Wilbraham, Mass]], and was born on February 9, 1810. His mother was Lucinda Blake, a native of the [[Massachusetts|Bay State]] and born in [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], October 14, 1816.  He was the sixth of the seven children born into his family, and attended high school at [[Englewood, Chicago|Englewood]], and afterward was a student of engineering at [[University of Illinois]] at Champaign. He was married, on February 21, 1877, to Nettie Lynk. &lt;ref&gt;[http://files.usgwarchives.net/il/will/bios/bliss553gbs.txt Will County IL Archives Biographies : Bliss, Abel Jr 1853]&lt;/ref&gt; He gave up engineering partway through his degree, due to circumstances that required him to take charge of the family farm, where he grew wealthy through his agricultural business and real estate investments. In June 1874, the University granted him a partial certificate in civil engineering. His business ventures included agriculture and real estate, and by 1929, he was a partner in the land development and oil production company of Bliss &amp; Wetherbee. Mr. Bliss died in the mid-1930s.

==Abel Bliss Professorship==

Helen Eva Bliss, the daughter of Abel Bliss Jr., graduated from the University of Illinois in 1911 with a degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences. &lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.illinois.edu/news/2011/Apr29-01 News &amp; Events] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304195204/http://cs.illinois.edu/news/2011/Apr29-01 |date=March 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After her retirement from working life, she established The Bliss Professor of Engineering in memory of her father.  Part of the Bliss bequest was earmarked to support the [[Grainger Engineering Library|Grainger Engineering Library and Information Center Endowment]], and the remainder towards other projects for “advancing the scholastic activities of the School of Engineering.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://cee.illinois.edu/node/2237 Engineering at Illinois]&lt;/ref&gt;  The bequest was so generous that it currently sustains several professorships annually at the School of Engineering, University of Illinois.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17521">{{Accounting}}
An '''accounting as an information system''' (AIS) is a system of collecting, [[information storage|storing]] and processing financial and [[accounting]] data that are used by [[decision maker]]s. An accounting information system is generally a computer-based method for tracking accounting activity in conjunction with information technology resources. The resulting financial [[report]]s can be used internally by management or externally by other interested parties including [[investor]]s, [[creditor]]s and tax authorities. Accounting information systems are designed to support all accounting functions and  activities including [[auditing]], [[financial accounting]] &amp; reporting, managerial/ [[management accounting]] and [[tax]].  The most widely adopted  accounting  information systems are auditing and financial reporting modules.

==History==
Traditionally, accounting is purely based on manual approach. Experience and skilfulness of an individual accountant are critical in accounting processes. Even using the manual approach can be ineffective and inefficient. Accounting information systems resolve many of above issues. AISs can  support an automation of processing large amount of data and produce timely and accuracy of information.

Early accounting information systems were designed for payroll functions in 1970s. Initially, accounting information systems were predominantly developed "in-house" as legacy systems. Such solutions were expensive to develop and difficult to maintain. Therefore, many accounting practitioners preferred the manual approach rather than computer-based. Today, accounting information systems are more commonly sold as prebuilt software packages from large vendors such as Microsoft, Sage Group, SAP AG|SAP and Oracle Corporation|Oracle where it is configured and customized to match the organization’s business processes. Small businesses often use accounting lower costs software packages such as MYOB and Quickbooks. Large organisations would often choose ERP systems. As the need for connectivity and consolidation between other business systems increased, accounting information systems were merged with larger, more centralized systems known as [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP). Before, with separate applications to manage different business functions, organizations had to develop complex interfaces for the systems to communicate with each other.  In ERP, a system such as accounting information system is built as a module integrated into a suite of applications that can include manufacturing, supply chain, human resources.  These modules are integrated together and are able to access the same data and execute complex business processes.  Today, Cloud-based accounting information systems are increasingly popular for both SMEs and large organisations for lower costs. With adoption of accounting information systems, many businesses have removed low skills, transactional and operational accounting roles.

==An example of architecture==
An AIS typically follows a [[multitier architecture]] separating the presentation to the user, application processing and data management in distinct layers.  The presentation layer manages how the information is displayed to and viewed by functional users of the system (through mobile devices, web browsers or client application). The entire system is backed by a centralized database that stores all of the data.  This can include transactional data generated from the core business processes (purchasing, inventory, accounting) or static, [[master data]] that is referenced when processing data (employee and customer account records and configuration settings).  As transactions occur, the data is collected from the business events and stored into the system’s database where it can be retrieved and processed into information that is useful for making decisions.  The application layer retrieves the raw data held in the log [[database]] layer, processes it based on the configured business logic and passes it onto the presentation layer to display to the users.   For example, consider the accounts payable department when processing an invoice.   With an accounting information system, an [[accounts payable]] clerk enters the [[invoice]], provided by a [[vendor (supply chain)|vendor]], into the system where it is then stored in the database. When goods from the vendor are received, a receipt is created and also entered into the AIS. Before the accounts payable department pays the vendor, the system’s application processing tier performs a three-way matching where it automatically matches the amounts on the invoice against the amounts on the receipt and the initial purchase order.  Once the match is complete, an email is sent to an accounts payable manager for approval.  From here a [[voucher]] can be created and the vendor can ultimately be paid.

==Advantages and implications==
A big advantage of computer-based accounting information systems is that they automate and streamline [[Financial reporting|reporting]], develop advanced modelling and support data mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/accounting/3504565-1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018134425/http://www.allbusiness.com/accounting/3504565-1.html |archivedate=October 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Reporting is major tool for organizations to accurately see summarized, timely information used for [[decision-making]] and [[financial reporting]]. The accounting information system pulls data from the centralized database, processes and transforms it and ultimately generates a summary of that data as information that can now be easily consumed and analyzed by business analysts, managers or other decision makers.  These systems must ensure that the reports are timely so that decision-makers are not acting on old, irrelevant information and, rather, able to act quickly and effectively based on report results. [[Consolidation (business)|Consolidation]] is one of the hallmarks of reporting as people do not have to look through an enormous number of transactions.  For instance, at the end of the month, a financial accountant consolidates all the paid vouchers by running a report on the system.  The system’s application layer provides a report with the total amount paid to its vendors for that particular month. With large corporations that generate large volumes of transactional data, running reports with even an AIS can take days or even weeks.

After the wave of corporate scandals from large companies such as [[Tyco International]], [[Enron]] and [[WorldCom]], major emphasis was put on enforcing public companies to implement strong internal controls into their transaction-based systems.  This was made into law with the passage of the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] of 2002 which stipulated that companies must generate an internal control report stating who is responsible for an organization’s internal control structure and outlines the overall effectiveness of these controls.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coso.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Since most of these scandals were rooted in the companies' accounting practices, much of the emphasis of [[Sarbanes Oxley]] was put on computer-based accounting information systems. Today, AIS vendors tout their [[governance, risk management, and compliance]] features to ensure business processes are robust and protected and the organization's assets (including data) are secured.

==Implementation==

Many large and SMEs are now adopting cost effective cloud-based accounting information system in recent years.

Looking back years ago, most organizations, even larger ones, hire outside consultants, either from the software publisher or consultants who understand the organization and who work to help select and implement the ideal configuration, taking all components into consideration.

The steps to implement an accounting information system are as follows:
 
;Detailed Requirements Analysis: where all individuals involved in the system are interviewed. The current system is thoroughly understood, including problems, and complete documentation of the system—transactions, reports, and questions that need to be answered—are gathered. User needs that are not in the current system are outlined and documented. Users include everyone, from top management to data entry. The requirements analysis not only provides the developer with the specific needs, it also helps users accept the change. Users who have the opportunity to ask questions and provide input are much more confident and receptive of the change, than those who sit back and don't express their concerns.
 
;Systems Design (synthesis): The analysis is thoroughly reviewed and a new system is created. The system that surrounds the system is often the most important. What data needs to go into the system and how is this going to be handled?  What information needs to come out of the system how is it going to be formatted? If we know what needs to come out, we know what we need to put into the system. The program we select will need to appropriately handle the process. The system is built with control files, sample master records, and the ability to perform processes on a test basis. The system is designed to include appropriate internal controls and to provide management with the information needed to make decisions. It is a goal of an accounting information system to provide information that is relevant, meaningful, reliable, useful, and current.  To achieve this, the system is designed so that transactions are entered as they occur (either manually or electronically) and information is immediately available online for management.

:Once the system is designed, an RFP is created detailing the requirements and fundamental design. Vendors are asked to respond to the proposal, to provide demonstrations of the product, and to specifically respond to the needs of the organization. Ideally, the vendor will input control files, sample master records, and be able to show how transactions are processed that result in the information that management needs to make decisions. An RFP for the information technology infrastructure follows the selection of the software product because the software product generally has specific requirements for infrastructure. Sometimes, the software and the infrastructure is selected from the same vendor. If not, the organization must ensure that vendors will work together without "pointing fingers" when there is an issue with either the software or the infrastructure.
 
;Documentation:As the system is being designed, it is documented. The documentation includes vendor documentation of the system and, more importantly, the procedures or detailed instructions that help users handle each process specific to the organization. Most documentation and procedures are online and it is helpful if organizations can add to the help instructions provided by the software vendor. Documentation and procedures tend to be an afterthought but is the insurance policy and the tool used during testing and training—before launch. The documentation is tested during the training so that when the system is launched, there is no question that it works and that the users are confident with the change.
 
;Testing: Before launch, all processes are tested from input through output, using the documentation as a tool to ensure that all processes are thoroughly documented and that users can easily follow the procedures: They know it works and that the procedures will be followed consistently. The reports are reviewed and verified, so that there’s no garbage in-garbage out. This is done in a test system not yet fully populated with live data. Unfortunately, most organizations launch systems before thorough testing, adding to end-user frustration when processes don't work. The documentation and procedures may be modified during this process. All identified transactions must be tested during this step. All reports and online information must be verified and traced through the audit trail so that management is ensured that transactions will be handled consistently and that the information can be relied upon to make decisions.
 
;Training: Before launch, all users need to be trained, with procedures. This means a trainer using the procedures to show each end user how to handle a procedures. The procedures often need to be updated during training as users describe their unique circumstances and the "design" is modified with this additional information. The end user then performs the procedure with the trainer and the documentation. The end user then performs the procedure with the documentation alone. The end user is then on his or her own with the support, either in person or by phone, of the trainer or other support person. This is before data conversion.
 
;Data Conversion: Tools are developed to convert the data from the current system (which was documented in the requirements analysis) to the new system. The data is mapped from one system to the other and data files are created that will work with the tools that are developed. The conversion is thoroughly tested and verified before final conversion. There’s a backup so it can be restarted, if necessary.
 
;Launch: The system is implemented only after all of the above is completed. The entire organization is aware of the launch date. Ideally, the current system is retained and often run in "parallel" until the new system is in full operation and working properly. With the current mass-market software used by thousands of companies and fundamentally proven to work, the "parallel" run that is mandatory with software tailor-made to a company is generally not done. This is only true, however, when the above process is followed, the system is thoroughly documented and tested, and users are trained before launch.

;Tools: Online resources are available to assist with strategic planning of accounting information systems. Information systems and financial forms aid in determining the specific needs of each organization, as well as assigning responsibility to principles involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountinginformationsystems.org/ ''Accounting Information Systems: Information on Collection, Storage and Processing of Financial and Accounting Data.''] Accounting Information Systems. Retrieved 7 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Support: The end users and managers have ongoing support available at all times. System upgrades follow a similar process and all users are thoroughly apprised of changes, upgraded in an efficient manner, and trained.

:Many organizations chose to limit the time and money spent on the analysis, design, documentation, and training, and move right into software selection and implementation. If a detailed requirements analysis is performed with adequate time being spent on the analysis, the implementation and ongoing support will be minimal. Organizations that skip the steps to ensure the system meets their needs are often left with frustrated end users, costly support, and information that is not current or correct. Worse yet, these organizations build the system three times instead of once.

Many AIS professionals work for consulting firms, large corporations, insurance companies, financial firms, government agencies and public accounting firms, among other types of companies. With technological advancement, traditional accounting practice will shift to accounting information systems practice. Both accounting and information technology professional bodies are working on the new directions of accounting programs and industry practices.  System Auditors is one of the top choices in the past two decades, they look at the controls, data processing, data integrity, general operation, maintenance, security and other aspects of all types of information systems used by businesses.  A lot of the companies will deal with software and finding a software that is right for the company, or maintaining a software for a company. 
If you are interested in the career, you might have the choice of working in the financial department of any type of business, or of working with a financially oriented company or a programming-oriented company that specializes in AIS. Some job titles in this field of work include financial manager, financial examiner and chief financial officer. You could also become a computer systems analyst, a computer information systems manager or a computer software engineer or programmer specializing in financial software.

If you are working with a financially oriented company, your job duties could range from analyzing an AIS for data integrity to managing the entire AIS. In a programming-oriented company, your focus may be directed towards developing new software in AIS or fixing bugs in an AIS. In both cases, you may also have the option of consulting, which requires travelling to different companies to provide analysis and advice concerning the company's AIS.

There are industry associations offer certificates that related to AIS area include CISA, AIS, CISSP, CIA, AFE, CFE, and CITP.

'''American Empire''' is a [[France|French]]-inspired [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] style of [[United States|American]] furniture and decoration that takes its name and originates from the [[Empire (style)|Empire style]] introduced during the [[First French Empire]] period under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] rule. It gained its greatest popularity in the U.S. after 1820 and is considered the second, more robust phase of the Neoclassical style, which earlier had been expressed in the [[Adam style]] in Britain and ''Louis Seize'', or [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], in France. As an early-19th-century design movement in the United States, it encompassed [[architecture]], [[furniture]] and other [[decorative art]]s, as well as the [[visual arts]].

In American furniture, the Empire style was most notably exemplified by the work of [[New York City|New York]] cabinetmakers [[Duncan Phyfe]] and [[Paris]]-trained [[Charles-Honoré Lannuier]]. Other major furniture centers renowned for regional interpretations of the American Empire style were [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[Baltimore]].  Many examples of American Empire cabinetmaking are characterized by antiquities-inspired carving, gilt-brass furniture mounts, and decorative inlays such as stamped-brass banding with [[egg-and-dart]], diamond, or [[Greek key (art)|Greek-key]] patterns, or individual shapes such as stars or circles.

The most elaborate furniture in this style was made around 1815-25, often incorporating columns with rope-twist carving, animal-paw feet, [[anthemion]], stars, and [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]]-leaf ornamentation, sometimes in combination with gilding and ''vert antique'' (antique green, simulating aged bronze). The [[Red Room (White House)|Red Room]] at the [[White House]] is a fine example of American Empire style. A simplified version of American Empire furniture, often referred to as the Grecian style, generally displayed plainer surfaces in curved forms, highly figured mahogany veneers, and sometimes gilt-[[stencil]]led decorations. Many examples of this style survive, exemplified by massive chests of drawers with [[volute|scroll]] pillars and glass pulls, work tables with scroll feet and [[figure (wood)|fiddleback]] chairs. Elements of the style enjoyed a brief revival in the 1890s with, particularly, chests of drawers and vanities or dressing tables, usually executed in oak and oak veneers.

This Americanized interpretation of the [[Empire style]] continued in popularity in conservative regions outside the major metropolitan centers well past the mid-nineteenth century.

[[File:Perforación Bautista-esquema.jpg|thumb|Baptist well drilling diagram in Spanish]]

'''Baptist well drilling''' is a very simple, manual method to drill [[water well]]s. The Baptist drilling rig can be built in any ordinary arc welding workshop and materials for a basic version costs about 150 US dollars (2006 prices). In suitable conditions, boreholes over 100 m deep have been drilled with this method.

==History==
The method was developed by Terry Waller, a North American [[Baptist]] missionary in Africa and Bolivia. It applies some of the same principles used in mechanized commercial [[well drilling]], but does so using the simplest, most available and cheapest possible materials.

==Social / development context==
Rural people in developing countries often cannot afford to have specialists drill or dig wells for them. This method was developed to provide poor people with a way to help themselves with their water supply.

A Baptist drilling rig, fit to drill holes up to {{convert|30|m|ft}} deep, can be built in [[Nicaragua]] for about US $150. This includes all essential non-common tools to operate it. Its core element, the drill bits, can be made in about any [[arc-welding]] workshop, using only scrap steel and materials that can be found in virtually any hardware store.

Once the well is drilled, it is cased with an inexpensive [[PVC]] tube. Fitting the well with a slab of concrete as a sanitary seal and a simple PVC piston pump (also built by the users themselves) will cost about 2.5 dollars per meter well depth.

==Suitable conditions==
A hybrid between [[sludging]] and percussion drilling, this method permits to drill through all kinds of loose [[alluvial]] soils, sands, silts and clays, as well as “soft” rocks, like light [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]], consolidated volcanic ashes, some calcareous rocks and weathered materials. It will not penetrate hard [[igneous]] rock or [[boulder]]s (e.g. in ancient river beds).

==Technical specifications==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Baptist Drilling-schematic.jpg|thumb|Concept of Baptist Manual Well Drilling.]] --&gt;
Like in sludging, the drilling process is continuous: the drill bit is normally not removed from the borehole until it is finished and the broken-up material is pumped to the surface in the drilling liquid (mud). But instead of using a hand as a valve on top of the drill pipe (sludging), the drill bit itself doubles as a foot-valve. The operator’s hand does not have to reach the end of the drill pipe and drill stem extensions can be several meters long.

Percussion action is performed by lifting the drill stem with a rope over a [[pulley]], attached to a simple [[derrick]], made with locally available materials, such as [[wood]] or [[bamboo]] poles.

The borehole diameter is kept as small as possible in order to remove a minimum of material and hence advance rapidly. The standard drill bit is based on {{convert|1.25|in|cm}} water pipe fittings and unless a larger diameter is required, the borehole is cased with {{convert|1.5|in|cm}} PVC pipe.

The main drill tool consists of a length of metal pipe with a bit/valve.  Extensions are standard PVC potable water pipes.

No temporary casing is used.  The [[borehole]] being kept full of mud and the “caking” of mud into any unstable sand layers, as a consequence of the percussion action and friction of the smooth lateral edges of the bit, is normally sufficient to stabilize it. The drilling mud is evacuated from the borehole after casing the well by pouring or injecting water into the casing, called backwashing.

This technique adapts best to sand, loam and light rock. The standard drill bits also work through sticky and even consolidated clays.  Nevertheless, best results in varying conditions are obtained with an array of different bits:
* Movable point bits for general purpose and clay-holding soils: the moving stem of the heavy dart helps to keep the foot valve clean.
* Fixed point bits for sandy and rocky layers, where there is no risk for sticky material to obstruct the foot valve.
* Open-ended (hollow) bits without a foot valve (pure sludging) for layers of pure clay or [[gravel]].  In these conditions the presence of a foot valve may slow down progress, since clay has to be pounded into suspension and stones have to be ground to small pieces in order to enter the drilling tool through the foot valve.

==Reaming==
If required, the upper part of the well can be reamed and cased with larger diameter pipe (3 or 5&amp;nbsp;inches), to accommodate larger pumps.   A shallow (large diameter) [[rope pump]], for example, may require a wider well and submersible pumps commonly need at least 4".  Note that there is no need to enlarge the entire depth of the borehole: reaming until slightly below the lowest expected water table (the pump's water intake) is sufficient.

'''Boleto Bancário''', simply referred to as '''Boleto''' ([[English language|English]]: Ticket) is a payment method in [[Brazil]] regulated by [[FEBRABAN]], short for Brazilian Federation of Banks.

A boleto can be paid at ATMs, branch facilities and internet banking of any Bank, Post Office, Lottery Agent and some supermarkets until its due date. After the due date it can only be paid at the issuer bank facilities.

Boleto can only be collected by an authorized Collector Agent in the Brazilian territory.{{citation needed|reason=Alibaba accepts Boleto Bancário|date=May 2014}} All Brazilian banks, Post Offices ([[Correios]]) and Lottery Agencies plus some companies from the private sector have joined the system.&lt;ref&gt;http://thebrazilbusiness.com/article/boleto-bancario-for-beginners Boleto Bancario for Beginners&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Open source]] projects like [[BoletoPHP]] allow the merchandisers to generate unregistered Boleto Bancários without communicating with the bank. &lt;ref&gt;http://techinbrazil.com/online-payment-for-e-commerce-in-brazil Online Payment for E-Commerce in Brazil&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kevgir.JPG|thumb|A stainless-steel colander]]
[[File:Plastic Colander.jpg|thumb|A plastic colander]]

A '''colander''' (or '''cullender''') is a bowl-shaped kitchen utensil with holes in it used for draining food&lt;ref name=MerriamWebster&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/colander|title= Colander (2011)|publisher = Merriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as pasta or rice. A colander is also used to rinse vegetables.

The perforated nature of the colander allows liquid to drain through while retaining the solids inside. It is sometimes also called a '''pasta strainer''' or '''kitchen sieve'''.

Conventionally, colanders are made of a light [[metal]], such as [[aluminium]] or thinly rolled [[stainless steel]].  Colanders are also made of plastic, silicone, ceramic, and [[enamelware]].&lt;ref&gt;Colander. CooksInfo.com. Published 02/12/2007. Updated 10/15/2010. Web. Retrieved 11/30/2012 from http://www.cooksinfo.com/colander&lt;/ref&gt;

The word colander comes from the Latin ''colum'' meaning ''sieve''.&lt;ref name=MerriamWebster/&gt;

'''Condeep''' (abbr. ''concrete deep water structure'') refers to a make of [[gravity-based structure]] for [[oil platform]]s developed by engineer Olav Mo in Hoeyer-Ellefsen and fabricated by [[Norwegian Contractors]] in [[Stavanger]], [[Norway]].&lt;ref name=tnc&gt;Fagerberg; Mowery; Verspagen, p.192&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mehta, Povindar K. p.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerwick, Ben C. p.166&lt;/ref&gt; A Condeep usually consists of a base of concrete oil storage tanks from which one, three or four concrete shafts rise.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. techn. Olav Olsen, [http://www.npd.no/Templates/OD/Article.aspx?id=3514 Condeep platforms], (in Norwegian) 2011, web page by [[Norwegian Petroleum Directorate]], retrieved 2011-08-30&lt;/ref&gt; The Condeep base always rests on the sea floor, and the shafts rise to about 30 meters above the sea level. The platform deck itself is not a part of the construction.

The Condeep is used for a series of production platforms introduced for [[crude oil]] and [[natural gas]] production in the [[North Sea]] and [[Norwegian continental shelf]].&lt;ref name=tnc/&gt;

Following the success of the concrete oil storage tank on the [[Ekofisk]] field, Norwegian Contractors introduced the Condeep production platform concept in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Arentsen; Künneke p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

This gravity-based structure for a platform was unique in that it was built from [[reinforced concrete]] instead of steel, which was the norm up to that point. This platform type was designed for the heavy weather conditions and the great water depths often found in the North Sea.&lt;ref name=tnc/&gt;

Condeep has the advantage that it allows for storage of oil at sea in its own construction. It further allows equipment installation in the hollow legs well protected from the sea. In contrast, one of the challenges with steel platforms is that they only allow for limited weight on the deck compared with a Condeep where the weight allowance for production equipment and living quarters is seldom a problem.

== Troll A ==
{{Main article|Troll A platform}}
The Troll A platform is the largest Condeep to date.&lt;ref&gt;Fagerberg; Mowery; Verspagen, p.191&lt;/ref&gt; It was built over a period of four years, using a workforce of 2,000, and deployed in 1995 to produce gas from the enormous [[Troll oil field]].

With a total height of 472 meters, Troll A was the tallest structure ever to be built and moved. Many sources erroneously state that it is the largest. The largest structure ever moved (also a Condeep) was the Gullfaks C platform in the Norwegian North Sea{{Citation needed|date=October 2017|reason=No source on the claim that Gullfaks C is larger}}. The total weight of the Troll A Condeep when launching was 1.2 million tons. 245,000 m³ of concrete and 100,000 tons of steel for reinforcement were used.&lt;ref name=guiness&gt;{{cite web |title= Guinness World Records - tallest offshore gas platform | work=[[Guinness World Records]] | year= 1996| url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records/science_and_technology/buildings/largest_offshore_gas_platform.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of steel corresponds to 15 [[Eiffel tower]]s.&lt;ref name=guiness/&gt; The platform is placed at a depth of 300 meters. For stability, it is dug 35 meters into the sea floor.

{{for|Daisy chain (network topology)|Network topology#Daisy chain}}
In electrical and electronic engineering a '''daisy chain''' is a wiring scheme in which multiple devices are wired together in sequence or in a ring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxim-ic.com/glossary/index.cfm/Ac/V/ID/71/Tm/Daisy_Chain maxim-ic.com - Electrical Engineering Glossary Definition for Daisy Chain]&lt;/ref&gt; Other than a full, single loop, systems which contain internal loops cannot be called daisy chains.

Daisy chains may be used for power, analog signals, digital data, or a combination thereof.

The term daisy chain may refer either to large scale devices connected in series, such as a series of [[power strips]] plugged into each other to form a single long line of strips, or to the wiring patterns embedded inside of devices.  Other examples of devices which can be used to form daisy chains are those based on [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], [[FireWire]], [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] and [[Ethernet]] cables.

== Signal transmission ==
{{See also|Passthrough}}
For [[analog signal]]s, connections usually consist of a simple [[Bus (computing)|electrical bus]] and, especially in the case of a [[Signal chain (signal processing chain)|chain of many devices]], may require the use of one or more [[repeater]]s or [[amplifier]]s within the chain to counteract [[attenuation]] (the natural loss of energy in such a system). [[Digital signal (electronics)|Digital signal]]s between devices may also travel on a simple electrical bus, in which case a bus [[Electrical termination|terminator]] may be needed on the last device in the chain. However, unlike analog signals, because digital signals are [[Discrete signal|discrete]], they may also be electrically regenerated, but not modified, by any device in the [[Signal chain (signal processing chain)|chain]].

== Types ==
=== Computer hardware ===
Some hardware can be attached to a computing system in a daisy chain configuration by connecting each component to another similar component, rather than directly to the computing system that uses the component. Only the last component in the chain directly connects to the computing system. For example, chaining multiple components that each have a [[Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter|UART]] port to each other. The components must also behave cooperatively. e.g., only one seizes the communications bus at a time.

* [[SCSI]] is an example of a digital system that is electrically a [[Computer bus|bus]], in the case of external devices, is physically wired as a daisy chain. Since the network is electrically a bus, it must be terminated and this may be done either by plugging a terminator into the last device or selecting an option to make the device terminate internally.
* [[MIDI 1.0|MIDI]] devices are usually designed to be wired in a daisy chain. It is normal for a device to have both a THRU port and an OUT port and often both can be used for chaining. The THRU port transmits the information through with minimal delay and no alteration, while the OUT port sends a completely regenerated signal and may add, remove, or change messages, at the cost of some delay in doing so. The difference can result in the signals arriving at different times; if the chain is long enough, it will be distorted so much that the system can become unreliable or non-functional.
* Some [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus]] (SPI) IC products are designed with daisy chain capability.
* All [[Joint Test Action Group|JTAG]] integrated circuits should support daisy chaining according to JTAG daisy chaining guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jtagtest.com/downloads/viatap.pdf ViaTAP user's manual, chapter Design guidelines for use with ViaTAP]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thunderbolt (interface)]] also supports daisy-chained devices such as [[RAID]] arrays and [[computer monitors]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intel.com/technology/io/thunderbolt/index.htm Intel - Thunderbolt I/O technology]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Hexbus]] is the 10-wire bus of [[Texas Instruments]], used in the [[TI-99/4A]], [[CC-40]] and [[TI-74]].

=== Network topology ===
{{main|Network topology#Daisy chain}}
Any particular daisy chain forms one of two network topologies:

* Linear topology: For example, A-B-C-D-E, A-B-C-D-E &amp; C-M-N-O (branched at C) are daisy chain.
* Ring topology: there is a loop connection back from the last device to the first. For example, A-B-C-D-E-A (loop). This is often called a "daisy chain loop".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== System access ===
{{see also|Jump server}}
Users can daisy chain computing sessions together. Using services such as [[Telnet]] or  [[Secure Shell|SSH]], the user creates a session on a second computer via Telnet, and from the second session, Telnets to a third and so on. Another typical example is the "terminal session inside a terminal session" using [[Remote Desktop Protocol|RDP]]. Reasons to create daisy chains include connecting to a system on a non-routed network via a gateway system, preserving sessions on the initial computer while working on a second computer, to save bandwidth or improve connectivity on an unstable network by first connecting to a better connected machine. A less wholesome purpose is camouflaging activity while engaged in [[cybercrime]].

They tend to fit into three categories: a physical [[nation|locality]] with weak information-system enforcement and [[extradition]] laws, a physical locality with intentionally strong protections of data, and [[Virtuality|virtual]] domains designed to secure data via technical means (such as [[encryption]]) regardless of any legal environment.

[[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]]'s [[.onion|onion space]] (hidden service), [[HavenCo]] (centralized), and [[Freenet]] (decentralized) are three models of modern-day virtual data havens.

==Purposes of data havens==
Reasons for establishing data havens include access to [[Freedom of speech|free political speech]] for users in countries where [[Internet censorship|censorship]] of the [[Internet]] is practiced.

Other reasons can include:
* [[Whistleblower|Whistleblowing]]
* Distributing [[software]], data or speech that violates laws such as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]]
* [[Copyright infringement]]
* Circumventing [[data protection]] laws
* [[Online gambling]]
* [[Pornography]]

==History of the term==
The 1978 report of the British government's Data Protection Committee expressed concern that different [[privacy]] standards in different countries would lead to the transfer of personal data to countries with weaker protections; it feared that Britain might become a "data haven."  &lt;ref name="NewSci1978"&gt;{{cite news|last=Michael|first=James|title=New Report on Computer Data Banks|work=[[New Scientist]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tTs5-WSNM6AC&amp;lpg=PA432&amp;pg=PA432#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=November 9, 1978|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1978, Adrian Norman published a mock consulting study on the feasibility of setting up a company providing a wide range of data haven services, called "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110903080638/http://www.adminet.co.uk/clients/ANAAL/goldfish.pdf Project Goldfish]." 

Science fiction novelist [[William Gibson]] used the term in his novels ''[[Count Zero]]'' and ''[[Mona Lisa Overdrive]]'', as did Bruce Sterling in ''[[Islands in the Net]]''.  The 1990s segments of [[Neal Stephenson]]'s 1999 novel ''[[Cryptonomicon]]'' concern a small group of entrepreneurs attempting to create a data haven.

A '''disc filter''' is a type of [[filter (water)|water filter]] used primarily in [[irrigation]], similar to a [[screen filter]], except that the filter cartridge is made of a number of plastic discs stacked on top of each other like a pile of [[poker]] chips.  Each disc is covered with small grooves or bumps.  The discs (or rings) each have a hole in the middle, forming a hollow cylinder in the middle of the stack. The [[water]] passes through the small passages in between and the impurities are trapped behind.&lt;ref name="Tomatoes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stryker"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stryker|first1=Jess|title=Irrigation Water Filtration &amp; Filter Recommendations|url=http://www.irrigationtutorials.com/filters.htm|website=Irrigation Tutorials|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The filtration quality is based on the quantity and size of particles that the filtering element is able to retain.  Higher quality filtration simply means cleaner water.  This depends on the geometry of the channels, including the size, length, angle, and number of generated intersection points.&lt;ref name="CarrowDuncan2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert N. Carrow|author2=Ronny R. Duncan|author3=Michael T.

The typical range is from 25 microns for the finest level of filtration to 400 microns for the coarsest.&lt;ref name="Allhands &amp; Prochaska" /&gt;  Sometimes the filtration quality is given as the equivalent [[mesh size]] of a comparable screen filter.  Typical mesh sizes range from 40 to 600.&lt;ref name="Tomatoes" /&gt;  When using mesh sizes, 40 is the coarsest and 600 is the finest or highest level of filtration.

Disc filters range in size from small units with a 3/4" inlet and outlet used for landscape [[drip irrigation]] systems to very large banks of multiple filters manifolded together used for filtering large volumes of water for agricultural and industrial applications.&lt;ref name="Allhands &amp; Prochaska" /&gt;

Some disc filters, especially the smaller ones, must be taken apart and cleaned by hand.&lt;ref name="Stryker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maintaining Microirrigation" /&gt;  Many of the larger ones can be backflushed in such a way that the discs are able to separate and spin during the cleaning cycle.&lt;ref name="Tomatoes"&gt;{{cite book|title=Drip Irrigation of Processing Tomatoes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R7jn7l75kYMC&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=7 August 2017|year=2008|publisher=UCANR Publications|isbn=978-1-60107-436-2|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CarrowDuncan2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert N.

However, when used to filter organic matter, they will clog more quickly than a [[media filter]] and will have to be cleaned more often.  One advantage that the disc filter has over the media filter is that it can backflush more quickly with less flush water.&lt;ref name="Tomatoes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maintaining Microirrigation"&gt;{{cite book|title=Maintaining Microirrigation Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b32OIhEpqFoC&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=7 August 2017|year=2008|publisher=UCANR Publications|isbn=978-1-60107-488-1|pages=33, 37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disc filters used in agricultural irrigation are covered by the ISO 9912-2 standard.&lt;ref name="ISO 9912-2"&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO 9912-2:2013 Agricultural irrigation equipment -- Filters for microirrigation -- Part 2: Strainer-type filters and disc filters|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/39769.html|website=International Organization for Standardization|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The disc filter was originally developed in 1936 to filter [[hydraulic fluid]] in the [[B-17 bomber]].  In these filters, the discs were made of stainless steel and brass.  This type of filter began to be used in [[Israel]] to filter irrigation water in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Allhands &amp; Prochaska"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allhands|first1=Marcus|last2=Prochaska|first2=James|title=Disc Filtration: Something Old, Something New|url=https://www.ksre.k-state.edu/sdi/abstracts/discfiltration.pdf|website=K-State Research and Extension|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US 20080257801 A1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Device For Filtering Solid Particles For Liquids Containing Such Particles|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US20080257801|website=Google Patents|accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60164">The '''elaboration likelihood model''' ('''ELM''') of [[persuasion]]&lt;ref&gt;Petty (1986) "Communication and persuasion: central and peripheral routes to attitude change." Springer-Verlag, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[dual process theory]] describing the change of attitudes. The ELM was developed by [[Richard E. Petty]] and [[John Cacioppo]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The model aims to explain different ways of processing stimuli, why they are used, and their outcomes on attitude change. The ELM proposes two major routes to persuasion: the central route and the peripheral route.

* Under the ''central route'', persuasion will likely result from a person's careful and thoughtful consideration of the true merits of the information presented in support of an advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petty|first1=Richard E|last2=Cacioppo|first2=John T|title=Source factors  and the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion|journal=Advances in Consumer Research|date=1984|volume=11|page=668}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central route involves a high level of message elaboration in which a great amount of cognition about the arguments are generated by the individual receiving the message. The results of attitude change will be relatively enduring, resistant, and predictive of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petty|first1=Richard E|last2=Cacioppo|first2=John T|title=The elaboration likelihood model of persuasion|journal=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|page=126|doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(08)60214-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* On the other hand, under the ''peripheral route'', persuasion results from a person's association with positive or negative cues in the stimulus or making a simple inference about the merits of the advocated position. The cues received by the individual under the peripheral route are generally unrelated to the logical quality of the stimulus. These cues will involve factors such as the credibility or attractiveness of the sources of the message, or the production quality of the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Katherine|title=Theories of message processing, Chapter 8, Communication theories: perspectives, processes, and contexts|date=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The likelihood of elaboration will be determined by an individual's motivation and ability to evaluate the argument being presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petty|first1=Richard E|last2=Cacioppo|first2=John T|title=The elaboration likelihood model of persuasion|journal=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|date=1986|page=129|doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(08)60214-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Routes of ELM.png|alt=Examples: Routes of ELM (Central and Peripheral)|thumb|379x379px|'''Examples: Routes of ELM (Central and Peripheral)''']]

==Origin==
Elaboration likelihood model is a general theory of [[attitude change]]. According to the theory's developers [[Richard E. Petty]] and [[John T. Cacioppo]], they intended to provide a general "framework for organizing, categorizing, and understanding the basic processes underlying the effectiveness of persuasive communications".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petty|first1=Richard E|last2=Cacioppo|first2=John T|title=The elaboration likelihood model of persuasion|journal=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|date=1986|page=125|doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(08)60214-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and persuasion began as the central focus of social psychology, featured in the work of psychologists [[Gordon Allport]] (1935) and [[Edward Alsworth Ross]] (1908). Allport described attitudes as "the most distinctive and indispensable concept in contemporary social psychology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allport|first1=Gordon|title=Attitudes|journal=A Handbook of Social Psychology|date=1935|pages=789–844}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considerable research was devoted to the study of attitudes and persuasion from the 1930s through the late 1970s. These studies embarked on various relevant issues regarding attitudes and persuasion, such as the [[Attitude behavior consistency|consistency between attitudes and behaviors]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ajzen|first1=Icek|last2=Fishbein|first2=Martin|title=Attitude-behavior relations: A theoretical analysis and review of empirical research.|journal=Psychological Bulletin, American Psychological Association|date=1977|volume=84|issue=5|pages=888–918|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.84.5.888}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fazio|first1=Russell H|last2=Zanna|first2=Mark P|title=Direct experience and attitude-behavior consistency|journal=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|date=1981|volume=14|pages=161–202|doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(08)60372-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the processes underlying [[Attitude-behavior consistency|attitude/behavior correspondence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sherman|first1=Steve J|last2=Fazio|first2=Russell H|last3=Herr|first3=Paul M|title=On the consequences of priming: Assimilation and contrast effects|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=1983|volume=19|issue=4|pages=323–340|doi=10.1016/0022-1031(83)90026-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Petty and Cacioppo noticed a major problem facing attitude and persuasion researchers to the effect that there was minimal agreement regarding "if, when, and how the traditional source, message, recipient, and channel variables affected attitude change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petty|first1=Richard E|last2=Cacioppo|first2=John T|title=The elaboration likelihood model of persuasion|journal=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|date=1986|pages=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noticing this problem, Petty and Cacioppo developed the elaboration likelihood model as their attempt to account for the differential persistence of communication-induced attitude change. Petty and Cacioppo suggested that different empirical findings and theories on attitude persistence could be viewed as stressing one of two routes to persuasion which they presented in their elaboration likelihood model.

==Routes==
The elaboration likelihood model proposes two distinct routes for [[information processing]]: a central route and a peripheral route. The ELM holds that there are numerous specific processes of change on the "elaboration continuum" ranging from low to high. When the operation processes at the low end of the continuum determine attitudes, persuasion follows the peripheral route. When the operation processes at the high end of the continuum determine attitudes, persuasion follows the central route.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of theories of social psychology|last = Kruglanski|first = Arie W.|publisher = Sage|year = 2012|isbn = |location = London, England|pages = 224–245|last2 = Van Lange|first2 = Paul A.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central route===
[[File:Elm-diagram.jpg|thumb|477x477px|ELM Diagram]]
The central route is used when the message recipient has the motivation as well as the ability to think about the message and its topic. When people process information centrally, the cognitive responses, or elaborations, will be much more relevant to the information, whereas when processing peripherally, the individual may rely on heuristics and other rules of thumb when elaborating on a message. Being at the high end of the elaboration continuum, people assess object-relevant information in relation to schemas that they already possess, and arrive at a reasoned attitude that is supported by information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is important to consider two types of factors that influence how and how much one will elaborate on a persuasive message. The first are the factors that influence our motivation to elaborate, and the second are the factors that influence our ability to elaborate. Motivation to process the message may be determined by a personal interest in the subject of the message,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morris | first1 = J. D. | last2 = Singh | first2 = A. J. | last3 = Woo | first3 = C. | year = | title = Elaboration likelihood model: A missing intrinsic emotional implication | url = | journal = Journal of Targeting, Measurement and Analysis for Marketing | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 79–98 | doi=10.1057/palgrave.jt.5740171}}&lt;/ref&gt; or individual factors like the [[need for cognition]]. However, if the message recipient has a strong, negative attitude toward the position proposed by the message, a [[Boomerang effect (psychology)|boomerang effect]] (an opposite effect) is likely to occur. That is, they will resist the message, and may move away from the proposed position.&lt;ref name=Griffin&gt;Griffin, E. (2012). In addition, there are different variables that a persuader can use to affect an individual’s ability to process a message (commonly used factors are the presence or absence of distractions, background knowledge of the topic, and the comprehensibility of the message or how easy it is to understand) that can enhance or reduce the amount of critical thinking that one would use to create elaborations from the message being presented. A First Look at Communication Theory, 8th ed. McGraw-Hill: New York, 205-207.&lt;/ref&gt; Two advantages of the central route are that attitude changes tend to last longer and are more predictive of behavior than the changes from the peripheral route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.gate.lib.buffalo.edu/ehost/detail/detail?sid=431af8ef-0d10-4e05-afd2-2c517701e4ba%40sessionmgr111&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=103&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=pdh&amp;AN=1989-19793-001|title = Reconceptualizing social influence in counseling: The Elaboration Likelihood Model.|last = McNeill|first = Brian W.|date = 1989|journal = Journal of Counseling Psychology|accessdate = |doi = 10.1037/0022-0167.36.1.24|pmid =|volume=36|pages=24–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, as people’s motivation and ability to process the message and develop elaborations decreases, the peripheral cues present in the situation become more important in their processing of the message.

===Peripheral route===
The peripheral route is used when the message recipient has little or no interest in the subject and/or has a lesser ability to process the message. Being at the low end of the elaboration continuum, recipients do not examine the information as thoroughly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the peripheral route, they are more likely to rely on general impressions (e.g. "this feels right/good"), early parts of the message, their own mood, positive and negative cues of the persuasion context, etc. Because people are "cognitive misers," looking to reduce mental effort, they often use the peripheral route and thus rely on [[Heuristics in judgment and decision-making|heuristics]] (mental shortcuts) when processing information. When an individual is not motivated to centrally process an issue because they lack interest in it, or if the individual does not have the cognitive ability to centrally process the issue, then these heuristics can be quite persuasive. [[Robert Cialdini]]'s Principles of [[Social influence|Social Influence]] (1984), which include commitment, social proof, scarcity, reciprocation, authority, as well as liking the person who is persuading you, are some examples of frequently used heuristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43607370|title=Influence : science and practice|last=B.,|first=Cialdini, Robert|date=2001|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|isbn=0321011473|edition= 4th|location=Boston, MA|oclc=43607370}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, credibility can also be used as a heuristic in peripheral thinking because when a speaker is seen as having a higher credibility, then the listener may be more likely to believe the message. Credibility is a low-effort and somewhat reliable way to give us an answer of what to decide and/or believe without having to put in much work to think it through.

If these peripheral influences go completely unnoticed, the message recipient is likely to maintain their previous attitude towards the message. Otherwise, the individual will temporarily change his attitude towards it. This attitude change can be long-lasting, although durable change is less likely to occur than it is with the central route.&lt;ref name="Griffin"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chaiken&gt;Chaiken &amp; Trope (Eds.)(1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Determinants of route==
The two most influential factors that affect which processing route an individual uses are [[motivation]] (the desire to process the message; see Petty and Cacioppo, 1979) and ability (the capability for critical evaluation; see Petty, Wells and Brock, 1976). The extent of motivation is in turn affected by attitude and personal relevance. Individuals' ability for elaboration is affected by distractions, their cognitive busyness (the extent to which their cognitive processes are engaged by multiple tasks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://webspace.ship.edu/ambart/Psy_220/SocCog_outline.htm|title = Social Cognition|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and their overall knowledge.

=== Motivation ===
''[[Attitude (psychology)|Attitudes]]'' towards a message can affect [[motivation]]. Drawing from [[cognitive dissonance|cognitive dissonance theory]], when people are presented with new information (a message) that conflicts with existing beliefs, ideas, or values, they will be motivated to eliminate the dissonance, in order to remain at peace with their own thoughts.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For instance, people who want to believe that they will be academically successful may recall more of their past academic successes than their failures. They may also use their world knowledge to construct new theories about how their particular personality traits may predispose them to academic success (Kunda, 1987). If they succeed in accessing and constructing appropriate beliefs, they may feel justified in concluding that they will be academically successful, not realizing that they also possess knowledge that could be used to support the opposite conclusion.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Case for Motivated Reasoning|last = Kunda|first = Ziva|date = 1990|journal = Psychological Bulletin|accessdate = |doi =10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480  |pmid = 2270237|pages = 480–498|volume = 108|issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Elaboration Likelihood Model2.jpg|thumb|351x351px|Motivation and ability]]
''Personal relevance'' can also affect an individual's degree of motivation. For instance, undergraduate students were told of a new exam policy that would take effect either one or ten years later. The proposal of the new exam policy was either supported by strong or weak arguments. Those students who were going to personally be affected by this change would think more about the issue than those students who were not going to be personally affected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An additional factor that affects degree of motivation is an individual's [[need for cognition]]. Individuals who take greater pleasure in thinking than others tend to engage in more effortful thinking because of its intrinsic enjoyment for them, regardless of the importance of the issue to them or the need to be correct.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Ability ===
''Ability'' includes the availability of [[Cognitive resource theory|cognitive resources]] (for instance, the absence of time pressures or distractions) and the relevant knowledge needed to examine arguments. [[Distraction]]s (for instance, noise in a library where a person is trying to read a journal article) can decrease a person's ability to process a message. Cognitive busyness, which can also serve as a distraction, limits the cognitive resources otherwise available for the task at hand (assessing a message). Another factor of ability is familiarity with the relevant subject. Though they might not be distracted nor cognitively busy, their insufficiency in knowledge can hinder people's engagement in deep thinking.

=== Opportunity ===
Some psychologists lump opportunity in with Ability as it primarily relates to the time available to the individual to make a decision.  The popular train of thought today is that this is a category of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Craig|first=Andrews, J.|date=1988|title=Motivation, Ability, and Opportunity to Process Information: Conceptual  and Experimental Manipulation Issues|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/6813/volumes/v15/NA-15|journal=ACR North American Advances|language=en|volume=NA-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==

===Core ideas===
There are four core ideas to the ELM.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

# The ELM argues that when a person encounters some form of communication, they can process this communication with varying levels of thought (elaboration), ranging from a low degree of thought (low elaboration) to a high degree of thought (high elaboration).
# The ELM predicts that there are a variety of psychological processes of change that operate to varying degrees as a function of a person's level of elaboration. On the lower end of the continuum are the processes that require relatively little thought, including [[classical conditioning]] and [[Mere-exposure effect|mere exposure]]. On the higher end of the continuum are processes that require relatively more thought, including [[Expectancy-value theory|expectancy-value]] and [[Cognitive response model|cognitive response processes]]. When lower elaboration processes predominate, a person is said to be using the peripheral route, which is contrasted with the central route, involving the operation of predominantly high elaboration processes.
# The ELM predicts that the degree of thought used in a persuasion context determines how consequential the resultant attitude becomes. Attitudes formed via high-thought, central-route processes will tend to persist over time, resist persuasion, and be influential in guiding other judgments and behaviors to a greater extent that attitudes formed through low-thought, peripheral-route processes.
# The ELM also predicts that any given variable can have multiple roles in persuasion, including acting as a cue to judgment or as an influence on the direction of thought about a message. The ELM holds that the specific role by which a variable operates is determined by the extent of elaboration.

=== Assumptions ===
One of the main assumptions of the ELM is that the attitudes formed through the central route rather than the peripheral route are stronger and more difficult to change.&lt;ref name="Petty (1986)"&gt;Petty R. and Cacioppo J. "Communication and persuasion: central and peripheral routes to attitude change." Springer-Verlag, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that when the central route is taken (involving high-elaboration thought in which all information is being carefully analyzed), the attitudes formed become more stable and less susceptible to counter-persuasion, whereas when the peripheral route is taken (involving low-elaboration thought based on [[heuristics]] and shortcuts to establish an attitude) short-term attitude change is more likely to occur.

=== Variables ===
A [[Variable and attribute (research)|variable]] is essentially anything that can ''increase'' or ''decrease'' the persuasiveness of a message.'' Motivation'' (desire to process the message), ''ability'' (capability for critical evaluation), ''attractiveness'', ''mood'' and ''expertise'' are just a few examples of variables that can influence persuasiveness. Variables also have different roles, for example, they may have a positive effect as a cue, but a negative effect if it ends up decreasing thought about a strong message.

Under high elaboration, a given variable (e.g., expertise) can serve as an ''argument'' (e.g., "If Einstein agrees with the theory of relativity, then this is a strong reason for me to as well") or a ''biasing factor'' (e.g., "If an expert agrees with this position it is probably good, so let me see who else agrees with this conclusion"), at the expense of contradicting information.&lt;ref name="Petty (2002)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petty | first1 = R. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2002 | title = Thought confidence as a determinant of persuasion: the self validation hypothesis | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 82 | issue = | pages = 722–741 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.82.5.722}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under low-elaboration conditions, a variable may act as a ''peripheral cue'' (e.g., the belief that "experts are always right"). While this is similar to the Einstein example above, this is a shortcut which (unlike the Einstein example) does not require thought. Under moderate elaboration, a variable may direct the ''extent of information processing'' (e.g., "If an expert agrees with this position, I should really listen to what (s)he has to say").

Recent adaptations of the ELM&lt;ref name="Petty (2002)" /&gt; have added a role for variables: to affect the extent to which a person trusts their thoughts in response to a message (''self-validation role'').&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A person may think, "If an expert presented this information, it is probably correct, and thus I can trust that my reactions to it are informative with respect to my attitude." This role, because of its [[metacognition|metacognitive]] nature, only occurs in high-elaboration conditions.

Scholars have been studying different variables in this model in difference context. For example, in "The Elaboration Likelihood Model: Limitations and Extensions in Marketing", Bitner et al. proposed that motivation and ability are under an interlaced influence of situational variables, person variables, and product categories variables.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bitner|first=Mary J.|last2=Carl|first2=Obermiller|title=The Elaboration Likelihood Model: Limitations and Extensions in Marketing|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1293434198/|journal=Advances in Consumer Research|volume=12|pages=420–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences===
For an individual intent on forming long-lasting beliefs on topics, the central route is advantageous by the fact that arguments are scrutinized intensely and that information is unlikely to be overlooked. However, this route uses a considerable amount of energy, time, and mental effort.

It is not worthwhile to exert considerable mental effort to achieve correctness in all situations and people do not always have the requisite knowledge, time, or opportunity to thoughtfully assess the merits of a proposal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For those, the use of the peripheral route excels at saving energy, time, and mental effort. This is particularly advantageous in situations in which one must make a decision within a small time constraint. On the other hand, the peripheral route is prone to errors in judgment, at least in attributing reasons for behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = On Cognitive Busyness: When Person Perceivers Meet Persons Perceived|last = Gilbert|first = Daniel T.|date = 1988|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|accessdate = |doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.54.5.733|pmid = |volume = 54|issue = 5|pages = 733–740|last2 = Pelham|first2 = Brett W.|last3 = Krull|first3 = Douglas S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Researchers have applied the elaboration likelihood model to many fields, including [[advertising]], [[marketing]], [[consumer behavior]] and [[health care]], just to name a few.

===In advertising and marketing===
[[File:Brading car park advertising.JPG|thumb|Advertising]]
The elaboration likelihood model can be applied to [[advertising]] and [[marketing]].

In 1983, Petty, Cacioppo and Schumann conducted a study to examine source effects in advertising.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petty|first1=Richard E|last2=Cacioppo|first2=John T|last3=Schumann|first3=David|title=Central and peripheral routes to advertising effectiveness: The moderating role of involvement|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=1983|pages=135–146|doi=10.1086/208954|volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a product advertisement about a new disposable razor. The authors purposefully made one group of subjects highly involved with the product, by telling them the product would be test marketed soon in the local area and by the end of the experiment they would be given a chance to get a disposable razor. Whereas, the authors made another group of subjects have low involvement with the product by telling them that the product would be test marketed in a distant city and by the end of the experiment they would have the chance to get a toothpaste. In addition to varying involvement, the authors also varied source and message characteristics by showing a group of the subjects ads featuring popular athletes, whereas showing other subjects ads featuring average citizens; showing some subjects ads with strong arguments and others ads with weak arguments. This experiment shows that when the elaboration likelihood was low, featuring famous athletes in the advertisement would lead to more favorable product attitudes, regardless of the strength of the product attributes presented. Whereas when elaboration likelihood was high, only the argument strength would manipulate affected attitudes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petty|first1=Richard E|last2=Cacioppo|first2=John T|title=Source factors and the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion|journal=Advances in Consumer Research|date=1984|pages=668–672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee et al. supported the studies on that product involvement strengthens the effects of "endorser–product congruence on consumer responses" when the endorsers expertise is well related with product to create source credibility. Lee's finding also helps to understand celebrity endorsement as not only a peripheral cue but also a motivation for central route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Younghan|last2=Koo|first2=Jakeun|date=2016-02-09|title=Can a Celebrity Serve as an Issue-Relevant Argument in the Elaboration Likelihood Model?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mar.20865|journal=Psychology &amp; Marketing|volume=33|issue=3|pages=195–208|doi=10.1002/mar.20865|issn=0742-6046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1985, Bitner, Mary J., and Carl Obermiller expand this model theoretically in the field of marketing. They proposed in the marketing context, the determinant of routes is more complex, involving variables of situation, person, and product categories.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Trampe et al. (2010) also discovered that product relevance is directional proportional to the attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-07-30|title=Retracted: Beauty as a tool: The effect of model attractiveness, product relevance, and elaboration likelihood on advertising effectiveness|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mar.20565|journal=Psychology &amp; Marketing|volume=29|issue=10|pages=805–805|doi=10.1002/mar.20565|issn=0742-6046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is widely acknowledged that effects of ads are not only limited to the information contained in the ad alone but are also a function of the different appeals used in the ads (like use celebrities or non-celebrities as endorsers).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rollins | first1 = B. | last2 = Bhutada | first2 = N. | year = 2014 | title = Impact Of Celebrity Endorsements In Disease-Specific Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) Advertisements: An Elaboration Likelihood Model Approach | url = | journal = International Journal of Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Marketing | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 164–177 | doi=10.1108/ijphm-05-2013-0024}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by Rollins and Bhutada in 2013, ELM theory was the framework used to understand and evaluate the underlying mechanisms describing the relationships between endorser type, disease state involvement and consumer response to direct-to-consumer advertisements (DTCA). The finding showed while endorser type did not significantly affect consumer attitudes, behavioral intentions and information search behavior; level of disease state involvement, though, did. More highly involved consumers had more positive attitudes, behavioral intentions and greater information search behavior.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Caveat ====

* However, when looking into advertising among young people, Te'eni-Harari et al. found out that in contradistinction to adults, ELM don't hold truth for the young. Instead of two information processing routes, young people are in little influence of motivation and ability variables, hence only one route. Their findings also indicates young people are representative of the less intellectually oriented population at large, who probably only have one route to process information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Te'eni-Harari|first=Tali|last2=Lampert|first2=Shlomo I.|last3=Lehman-Wilzig|first3=Sam|date=2007-09|title=Information Processing of Advertising among Young People: The Elaboration Likelihood Model as Applied to Youth|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2501/s0021849907070341|journal=Journal of Advertising Research|volume=47|issue=3|pages=326–340|doi=10.2501/s0021849907070341|issn=0021-8499}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although using peripheral is a choice of persuasion, advertisers need to be extremely careful addressing some issue to avoid controversy, such as using sacred symbol as peripheral cues in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dotson|first=Michael J|last2=Hyatt|first2=Eva M|date=2000-04|title=Religious Symbols as Peripheral Cues in Advertising|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0148-2963(98)00076-9|journal=Journal of Business Research|volume=48|issue=1|pages=63–68|doi=10.1016/s0148-2963(98)00076-9|issn=0148-2963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In healthcare===
[[File:Doctor talking with a patient.jpg|thumb|Healthcare]]
Recent research has been conducted to apply the ELM to the [[Health care|healthcare]] field. In 2009, Angst and Agarwal published a research article, "Adoption of Electronic Health Records in the Presence of Privacy Concerns: the Elaboration Likelihood Model and Individual Persuasion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Angst|first1=Corey|last2=Agarwal|first2=Ritu|title=Adoption of electronic health records in the presence of privacy concerns: the elaboration likelihood model and individual persuasion|journal=MIS Quarterly|date=2009|volume=33|issue=2|pages=339–370}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research studies [[electronic health records]] (EHRs), (an individual's) concern for information privacy (CFIP) and the elaboration likelihood model (ELM). The two researchers aimed to investigate the question, "Can individuals be persuaded to change their attitudes and opt-in behavioral intentions toward EHRs, and allow their medical information to be digitized even in the presence of significant privacy concerns?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Angst|first1=Corey|last2=Agarwal|first2=Ritu|title=Adoption of electronic health records in the presence of privacy concerns: the elaboration likelihood model and individual persuasion|journal=MIS Quarterly|date=2009|volume=33|issue=2|page=339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the ELM model provides an understanding how to influence attitudes, the said model could be leveraged to alter perceptions and attitudes regarding adoption and adaptation of change.

Findings of the research included:
* "Issue involvement and argument framing interact to influence attitude change, and that concern for information privacy further moderates the effects of these variables."
* "Likelihood of adoption is driven by concern for information privacy and attitude."
* "An individual's CFIP interacts with argument framing and issue involvement to affect attitudes toward EHR use and CFIP directly influence opt-in behavioral intentions."
* "Even people have high concerns for privacy, their attitudes can be positively altered with appropriate message framing."

=== In e-commerce ===
[[File:Ecommerce sales.jpg|thumb|E-commerce]]
Chen and Lee conducted a study about [[online shopping]] persuasion by applying the elaboration likelihood model back to 2008. In this study, how online shopping influences consumers' beliefs and perceived values on attitude and approach behavior were examined. "Twenty cosmetics and 20 hotel websites were selected for participants to randomly link to and read, and the students were then asked to fill in a 48-item questionnaire via the internet. It was found that when consumers have higher levels of [[agreeableness]] and [[conscientiousness]], central route website contents would be more favorable for eliciting utilitarian shopping value; whereas when consumers have higher levels of emotional stability, openness, and extraversion, peripheral route website contents would be more critical in facilitating experiential and hedonic shopping value", Chen explained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = S. | last2 = Lee | first2 = K. | year = 2008 | title = The Role Of Personality Traits And Perceived Values In Persuasion: An Elaboration Likelihood Model Perspective On Online Shopping | url = | journal = Social Behavior &amp; Personality: An International Journal | volume = 36 | issue = 10| pages = 1379–1400 | doi = 10.2224/sbp.2008.36.10.1379 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, highly skeptical consumers tend to stick with their original impression than been influenced by other factors (Central Route); which means, they are biased against certain types of information and indifferent to the message quality. Second, consumers with low skepticism tend to adopt the peripheral route in forming attitude; that is, they are more persuaded by online review quantity. Lee indicated, "these findings contribute to the ELM research literature by considering a potentially important personality factor in the ELM framework".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== In media ===
[[File:Electronic-media.jpg|thumb|Media]]
In order to reduce youth smoking by developing improved methods to communicate with higher risk youth, Flynn and his colleagues conducted a study in 2013, exploring the potential of smoking prevention messages on TV based on the ELM.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Flynn | first1 = B.

Students categorized as likely to have higher involvement in a decision to initiate cigarette smoking, are reported relatively high ratings on a cognitive processing indicator for messages focused on factual arguments about negative consequences of smoking than for messages with fewer or no direct arguments. Message appeal ratings did not show greater preference for this message type among higher involved versus lower involved students. Ratings from students reporting lower academic achievement suggested difficulty processing factual information presented in these messages. The ELM may provides a useful strategy for reaching adolescents at risk for smoking initiation, but particular attention should be focused on lower academic achievers to ensure that messages are appropriate for them."''&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Another research directed by Boyce and Kuijer was focusing on media body ideal images triggers food intake among restrained eaters based on ELM.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boyce | first1 = J. | last2 = Kuijer | first2 = R. | year = 2014 | title = Focusing On Media Body Ideal Images Triggers Food Intake Among Restrained Eaters: A Test Of Restraint Theory And The Elaboration Likelihood Model | url = | journal = Eating Behaviors | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 262–270 | doi = 10.1016/j.eatbeh.2014.03.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their hypotheses were based on restraint theory and the ELM. From the research, they found participants' attention (advertent/inadvertent) toward the images was manipulated. Although restrained eaters' weight satisfaction was not significantly affected by either media exposure condition, advertent (but not inadvertent) media exposure triggered restrained eaters' eating. These results suggest that teaching restrained eaters how to pay less attention to media body ideal images might be an effective strategy in media–literary interventions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

With the development of the internet and the emerging new media, L. G. Pee (2012) has conduct interesting research on the influence of trust on social media using the ELM theory. The findings resulted that source credibility, the majority influence, and information quality has strong effect on the trust for users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pee|first=L. G.|last2=Lee|first2=Jung|date=2016-03-31|title=Trust in User-Generated Information on Social Media during Crises : An Elaboration Likelihood Perspective|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.14329/apjis.2016.26.1.1|journal=Asia Pacific Journal of Information Systems|volume=26|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.14329/apjis.2016.26.1.1|issn=1229-0270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In politics ===
Hans-Joachim Mosler applied ELM to study if and how a minority can persuade the majority to change its opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/9/3/4.html | title=Better Be Convincing or Better Be Stylish? a Theory Based Multi-Agent Simulation to Explain Minority Influence in Groups Via Arguments or Via Peripheral Cues | author=Hans-Joachim Mosler | journal=Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study used [[Agent-based social simulation]]. There were 5 agents. 3 (or 4) of whom held a neutral opinion on some abstract topic, while the other 2 (or 1) held a different opinion. In addition, there were differences between the agents regarding their ''argument quality'' and ''peripheral cues''. The simulation was done in rounds. In each round, one of the agents had an opportunity to influence the other agents. The level of influence was determined by either the argument strength (if the central route was taken) or the peripheral cues (if the peripheral route was taken). After 20 rounds of persuasion, the distance between the majority's original opinion to its new opinion was studied. It was found that, the peripheral cues of the minority were more important than the argument quality. I.e, a minority with strong arguments but negative cues (e.g., different skin-color or bad reputation) did not succeed in convincing the majority, while a minority with weak arguments and positive cues (e.g., appearance or reputation) did succeed. The results depend also on the level of ''personal relevance'' – how much the topic is important to the majority and to the minority.

'''In Mental Health Counseling'''
[[File:Counseling.png|alt=Mental Heath Conseling|thumb|Mental Heath Conseling]]
''Counseling and Stigma''

One of the most common reasons why an individual does not attend counseling is because they are worried about the falling into a [[Social stigma|stigma]] (being considered crazy, or having serious “issues”).&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, G. D., &amp; Barbaro, M. B. (1985). Fighting the stigma: A unique approach to marketing mental health. Health Marketing Quarterly, 2, 89–101.&lt;/ref&gt; This stigma—which was prevalent 30 years ago, still exists today.&lt;ref&gt;Topkaya, N., Vogel, D. L., &amp; Brenner, R. E. (2017). Examination of the stigmas toward help seeking among Turkish college students. Journal Of Counseling &amp; Development, 95(2), 213-225. doi:10.1002/jcad.12133&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately, an implementation of the ELM can help increase the positive perceptions of counseling amongst the undergraduate student population. Students that repeatedly watched a video that explained the function and positive outcomes of mental health counseling demonstrated a significant and lasting change in their perception to counseling. Students who watched the video once or not at all maintained a relatively negative view towards counseling.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, S. A., Vogel, D. L., Gentile, D. A., &amp; Wade, N. G. (2012). Increasing positive perceptions of counseling: The importance of repeated exposures. The Counseling Psychologist, 40(3), 409-442. doi:10.1177/0011000011414211&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, repeated exposure towards the positive elements of counseling lead towards a greater elaboration and implementation of the central route to combat negative social stigma of counseling. Most negative intuitions exist within the realm of the peripheral route, and therefore to work against stigmas the general public needs to engage their central route of processing.

''Counselor Credibility''

The more credible a counselor is perceived as, the more likely that counseling clients are to perceive the counselor’s advice as impactful. However, counselor credibility is strongly mediated by the degree to which the client understands the information conveyed by the counselor.&lt;ref&gt;Hu, B. (2013). Examining elaboration likelihood model in counseling context. Asian Journal Of Counselling, 20(1-2), 33-58.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is extremely important that counseling clients feel that they understand their counselor. The use of [[metaphor]] is helpful for this. Metaphors require a deeper level of elaboration, thereby engaging the central route of processing. Kendall (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, W. A. (2010). Examining the persuasive effect of metaphor use in psychotherapy: An experimental test of contributing factors. Dissertation Abstracts International, 71, 3377.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests using metaphor in counseling as a valid method towards helping clients understand the message/psychological knowledge conveyed by the client. When the client hears a metaphor that resonates with them, they are far more likely to trust and build positive rapport with the counselor.&lt;ref&gt;Fonagy, P., &amp; Allison, E. (2014). The role of mentalizing and epistemic trust in the therapeutic relationship. Psychotherapy, 51(3), 372-380. doi:10.1037/a0036505&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodological considerations==
[[File:Elaboration Likelihood Model Information Graphic of Bias and Objective Thinking.jpg|thumb|177x177px]]
In designing a test for the aforementioned model, it is necessary to determine the quality of an argument, i.e., whether it is viewed as strong or weak. If the argument is not seen as strong, then the results of persuasion will be inconsistent. A strong argument is defined by Petty and Cacioppo as "one containing arguments such that when subjects are instructed to think about the message, the thoughts they generate are fundamentally favorable."&lt;ref name="Griffin (2012)"&gt;Griffin E. ''A First Look at Communication Theory'', 8th ed. McGraw-Hill, New York, p366 - 377.&lt;/ref&gt; An argument that is universally viewed as weak will elicit unfavorable results, especially if the subject considers it under high elaboration, thus being the central route. Test arguments must be rated by ease of understanding, complexity and familiarity. To study either route of the elaboration likelihood model, the arguments must be designed for consistent results.&lt;ref name="Berkowitz (1986)"&gt;Berkowitz L. ''Advances in Experimental Social Psychology''. Vol 19. Academic press, Orlando 1986 p132 - 134. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, when assessing persuasion of an argument, the influence of peripheral cues needs to be taken into consideration as cues can influence attitude even in the absence of argument processing.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication and Persuasion: Central and Peripheral Routes to Attitude Change|last = Petty|first = Richard E.|publisher = Springer New York|year = 1986|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent or direction of message processing also needs to be taken into consideration when assessing persuasion, as variables can influence or bias thought by enabling or inhibiting the generation of a particular kind of thought in regard to the argument.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; "''While the ELM theory continues to be widely cited and taught as one of the major cornerstones of persuasion, questions are raised concerning its relevance and validity in 21st century communication contexts.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kitchen | first1 = P. | last2 = Kerr | first2 = G. | last3 = Schultz | first3 = D. | last4 = McColl | first4 = R. | last5 = Pals | first5 = H. | year = 2014 | title = The Elaboration Likelihood Model: Review, Critique And Research Agenda | url = | journal = European Journal of Marketing | volume = 48 | issue = 11/12| pages = 2033–2050 | doi = 10.1108/EJM-12-2011-0776 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misinterpretions of the theory==

Some researchers have been criticized for misinterpreting the ELM. One such instance is Kruglanski and Thompson, who write that the processing of central or peripheral routes is determined by the ''type'' of information that affects message persuasion. For example, message variables are only influential when the central route is used and information like source variables is only influential when the peripheral route is used. In fact, the ELM does not make statements about ''types'' of information being related to routes. Rather, the key to the ELM is ''how'' any type of information will be used depending on central or peripheral routes, regardless of what that information is.&lt;ref name="Chaiken" /&gt; For example, the central route may permit source variables to influence preference for certain language usage in the message (e.g. "beautiful") or validate a related product (e.g. cosmetics), while the peripheral route may only lead individuals to associate the "goodness" of source variables with the message. Theoretically, all of these could occur simultaneously. Thus, the distinction between central and peripheral routes is not the type of information being processed as those types can be applied to both routes, but rather how that information is processed and ultimately whether processing information in one way or the other will result in different attitudes.

A second instance of misinterpretation is that processing of the central route solely involves thinking about the message content and not thoughts about the issue.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.psy.ohio-state.edu/petty/PDF%20Files/1999-PI-Petty,Wheeler,Bizer.pdf|title = Is There One Persuasion Process or More? Lumping Versus Splitting in Attitude Change Theories|author1=Richard E. Petty |author2=S. Christian Wheeler |author3=George Y. Bizer |date = 1999|journal = |accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Petty and Cacioppo (1981) stated "If the issue is very important to the person, but the person doesn't understand the arguments being presented in the message, or if no arguments are actually presented, then elaboration of arguments cannot occur.…Nevertheless, the person may still be able to think about the issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Attitudes and persuasion: Classic and contemporary approaches|author1=Petty, R. E. |author2= Cacioppo, J. T. |last-author-amp=yes|publisher = |year = 1981|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, issue-relevant thinking is still a part of the central route and is necessary for one to think about the message content.

Lastly, a third instance of misinterpretation by Kruglanski and Thompson is the disregard for the quantitative dimension presented by the ELM and more focus on the qualitative dimension. This quantitative dimension is the peripheral route involves low-elaboration persuasion that is quantitatively different from the central route that involves high elaboration. With this difference the ELM also explains that low-elaboration persuasion processes are qualitatively different as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is seen as incorrect if the ELM focuses on a quantitative explanation over a qualitative one; however one of the ELM's key points is that elaboration can range from high to low which is not incorrect as data from experiments conducted by Petty (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.psy.ohio-state.edu/petty/documents/1997EVOLUTIONOFTHEORYPetty.pdf|title = The Evolution of Theory  and Research in Social  Psychology: From Single to  Multiple Effect and Process  Models of Persuasion|last = Petty|first = Richard E.|date = 1997|journal = |accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Petty and Wegener (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.psy.ohio-state.edu/petty/PDF%20Files/1999-DUAL%20PROCESS-Petty,Wegener.pdf|title = The Elaboration Likelihood Model: Current Status and Controversies|author1=Petty, R.E.  |author2=Wegener, D.T.|date = 1999|journal = |accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that persuasion findings can be explained by a quantitative dimension without ever needing a qualitative one.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Issues concerning the ELM ==
In 2014, J. Kitchen et al. scrutinized the literatures of the ELM for the past 30 years. They came up with four major research areas that have received most significant criticism:&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=J. Kitchen|first=Philip|last2=Kerr|first2=Gayle|last3=E. Schultz|first3=Don|last4=McColl|first4=Rod|last5=Pals|first5=Heather|date=2014-11-04|title=The elaboration likelihood model: review, critique and research agenda|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/ejm-12-2011-0776|journal=European Journal of Marketing|volume=48|issue=11/12|pages=2033–2050|doi=10.1108/ejm-12-2011-0776|issn=0309-0566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The descriptive nature of the model ====
The first critique lies on the basis of the model's initial development. For the fact that ELM was built on previous empirical researches and diverse literature base to unify disparate ideas, the model is inherently descriptive because of the intuitive and conceptual assumptions underlying.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; For example, Choi and Salmon criticized Petty and Cacioppo's assumption that correct recall of a products led directly to highly involvement. They proposed that the high involvement are likely to be the result of other variations, for example sample population; and the weak/strong arguments in one study are likely to result in different involvement characteristics in another study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=S. M.|last2=Salmon|first2=C. T.|date=2003|title=The elaboration likelihood model of persuasion after two decades: A review of criticisms and contributions|url=|journal=The Kentucky Journal of Communication|volume=22(1)|pages=47–77|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Continuum questions ====
The elaboration likelihood continuum is ought to show that a human can undergo a natural progression from high involvement to low involvement with the corresponding effects. This continuum can account for the swift between the central and the peripheral routes, but has yet been lack of comprehensive and empirical testing since the beginning. However, researches has been done under three distinct conditions: high, low, and moderate.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==== The issue of multi-channel processing ====
This area of critique basically lands on the nature of ELM being a dual-process model, which indicates that the receivers will rely on one of the routes (central or peripheral) to process messages and possibly change attitude and behaviour. Stiff (1986) questioned the validity of ELM because the message should be able to be processed through two routes simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stiff|first=James B.|date=1986-03|title=Cognitive processing of persuasive message cues: A meta‐analytic review of the effects of supporting information on attitudes|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637758609376128|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=53|issue=1|pages=75–89|doi=10.1080/03637758609376128|issn=0363-7751}}&lt;/ref&gt; On top of Stiff's questioning, alternative models have been raised. Mackenzie et al (1986) advocated a '''Dual Mediation Hypothesis''' (DMH) that allow receivers to process the ad's content and its execution at the same time with reasonable vigilance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacKenzie|first=Scott B.|last2=Lutz|first2=Richard J.|last3=Belch|first3=George E.|date=1986-05|title=The Role of Attitude toward the Ad as a Mediator of Advertising Effectiveness: A Test of Competing Explanations|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3151660|journal=Journal of Marketing Research|volume=23|issue=2|pages=130|doi=10.2307/3151660|issn=0022-2437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord et al. (1995) proposed a '''Combined Influence Hypothesis''' which argues that the central and peripheral cues worked in combination despite the variables of motivation and ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lord|first=Kenneth R.|last2=Lee|first2=Myung-Soo|last3=Sauer|first3=Paul L.|date=1995-03|title=The Combined Influence Hypothesis: Central and Peripheral Antecedents of Attitude toward the Ad|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00913367.1995.10673469|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=24|issue=1|pages=73–85|doi=10.1080/00913367.1995.10673469|issn=0091-3367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kruglanski et al. (1999) proposed a single cognitive process instead of the dual-process model. Although drawing on the fundamental conception from ELM, such as motivation, ability and continuum, the '''unimodel''' suggests a normative and heuristic rules for human to make judgement based on the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kruglanski|first=Arie W.|last2=Thompson|first2=Erik P.|date=1999-04|title=Persuasion by a Single Route: A View From the Unimodel|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327965pl100201|journal=Psychological Inquiry|volume=10|issue=2|pages=83–109|doi=10.1207/s15327965pl100201|issn=1047-840X}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Heuristic-systematic model of information processing|The Heuristic Systematic Model]]''' (HSM) is another alternative model concerning this issue.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==== The analysis of the different variables which mediate elaboration likelihood ====
Many studies have been expanding and/or refining the model by examining and testing the variables, particularly in advertising research. For example, Britner and Obermiller (1985) were among the first to expand the model to new variables under the peripheral processing. They proposed situation, person, and product categories as new variables under the context of marketing.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

A '''fixture''' is a work-holding or support device used in the [[manufacturing]] industry.{{sfn|Colvin|Haas|1938|p=1}}{{sfn|Henriksen|1973|p=1}} Fixtures are used to securely locate (position in a specific location or orientation) and support the work, ensuring that all parts produced using the fixture will maintain conformity and interchangeability. Using a fixture improves the economy of production by allowing smooth operation and quick transition from part to part, reducing the requirement for skilled labor by simplifying how workpieces are mounted, and increasing conformity across a production run.{{sfn|Henriksen|1973|p=1}}

A fixture differs from a [[jig (tool)|jig]] in that when a fixture is used, the tool must move relative to the workpiece; a jig moves the piece while the tool remains stationary.{{sfn|Colvin|Haas|1938|p=3}}

==Purpose==
A fixture's primary purpose is to create a secure mounting point for a workpiece, allowing for support during operation and increased accuracy, precision, reliability, and interchangeability in the finished parts. It also serves to reduce working time by allowing quick set-up, and by smoothing the transition from part to part.{{sfn|Colvin|Haas|1938|p=3}} It frequently reduces the complexity of a process, allowing for unskilled workers to perform it and effectively transferring the skill of the [[Tool and die maker|tool maker]] to the unskilled worker.{{sfn|Henriksen|1973|p=1}} Fixtures also allow for a higher degree of operator safety by reducing the concentration and effort required to hold a piece steady.{{sfn|Colvin|Haas|1938|p=3}}

Economically speaking the most valuable function of a fixture is to reduce labor costs. Without a fixture, operating a machine or process may require two or more operators; using a fixture can eliminate one of the operators by securing the workpiece.{{sfn|Colvin|Haas|1938|p=4}}

==Design==
[[File:Tooling fixtures.jpg|thumb|These modular fixture components may be built into various arrangements to accommodate different workpieces]]
Fixtures must always be designed with economics in mind; the purpose of these devices is to reduce costs, and so they must be designed in such a way that the cost reduction outweighs the cost of implementing the fixture. It is usually better, from an economic standpoint, for a fixture to result in a small cost reduction for a process in constant use, than for a large cost reduction for a process used only occasionally.{{sfn|Colvin|Haas|1938|p=4}}


Most fixtures have a solid component, affixed to the floor or to the body of the machine and considered immovable relative to the motion of the machining bit, and one or more movable components known as '''clamps'''. These clamps (which may be operated by many different mechanical means) allow workpieces to be easily placed in the machine or removed, and yet stay secure during operation. Many are also adjustable, allowing for workpieces of different sizes to be used for different operations. Fixtures must be designed such that the pressure or motion of the machining operation (usually known as the '''feed''') is directed primarily against the solid component of the fixture. This reduces the likelihood that the fixture will fail, interrupting the operation and potentially causing damage to infrastructure, components, or operators.{{sfn|Colvin|Haas|1938|p=5}}

Fixtures may also be designed for very general or simple uses. These multi-use fixtures tend to be very simple themselves, often relying on the precision and ingenuity of the operator, as well as surfaces and components already present in the workshop, to provide the same benefits of a specially-designed fixture. Examples include workshop [[vise]]s, adjustable [[Clamp (tool)|clamps]], and improvised devices such as weights and furniture.

Each component of a fixture is designed for one of two purposes: '''location''' or '''support'''.

===Location===
Locating components ensure the ''geometrical stability'' of the workpiece. They make sure that the workpiece rests in the correct position and orientation for the operation by addressing and impeding all the [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] the workpiece possesses.{{sfn|Henriksen|1973|p=18}}

For locating workpieces, fixtures employ pins (or ''buttons''), clamps, and surfaces. These components ensure that the workpiece is positioned correctly, and remains in the same position throughout the operation. Surfaces provide support for the piece, pins allow for precise location at low surface area expense, and clamps allow for the workpiece to be removed or its position adjusted. Locating pieces tend to be designed and built to very tight specifications.{{sfn|Henriksen|1973|loc=Ch. 4}}

===Support===
In designing the locating parts of a fixture, only the ''direction'' of forces applied by the operation are considered, and not their ''magnitude''. Locating parts technically support the workpiece, but do not take into account the strength of forces applied by the process and so are usually inadequate to actually secure the workpiece during operation. For this purpose, '''support''' components are used.{{sfn|Henriksen|1973|p=19}}

To secure workpieces and prevent motion during operation, support components primarily use two techniques: positive stops and friction. A '''positive stop''' is any immovable component (such as a solid surface or pin) that, by its placement, physically impedes the motion of the workpiece. Support components are more likely to be adjustable than locating components, and normally do not press tightly on the workpiece or provide absolute location.{{sfn|Henriksen|1973|loc=Ch. 12}}

Support components usually bear the brunt of the forces delivered during the operation. To reduce the chances of failure, support components are usually not also designed as clamps.

==Types of fixtures==
Fixtures are usually classified according to the machine for which they were designed. The most common two are ''[[Milling machine|milling]] fixtures'' and ''[[drill]] fixtures''.{{sfn|Henriksen|1973|p=3}}

===Milling fixtures===
{{see also|Milling machine}}
Milling operations tend to involve large, straight cuts that produce lots of chips and involve varying force. Locating and supporting areas must usually be large and very sturdy in order to accommodate milling operations; strong clamps are also a requirement. Due to the vibration of the machine, positive stops are preferred over friction for securing the workpiece. For high-volume automated processes, milling fixtures usually involve [[Hydraulic machinery|hydraulic]] or [[Pneumatics|pneumatic]] clamps.{{sfn|Henriksen|1973|loc=Ch. 19}}{{sfn|Colvin|Haas|1938|loc=Ch. 11}}

===Drilling fixtures===
{{see also|Drill}}
Drilling fixtures cover a wider range of different designs and procedures than milling fixtures. Though workholding for drills is more often provided by [[Jig (tool)|jigs]], fixtures are also used for drilling operations.

Two common elements of drilling fixtures are the hole and [[Plain bearing#Bushing|bushing]]. Holes are often designed into drilling fixtures, to allow space for the drill bit itself to continue through the workpiece without damaging the fixture or drill, or to guide the drill bit to the appropriate point on the workpiece. '''Bushings''' are simple bearing sleeves inserted into these holes to protect them and guide the drill bit.{{sfn|Colvin|Haas|1938|loc=Ch. 4}}

Because drills tend to apply force in only one direction, support components for drilling fixtures may be simpler. If the drill is aligned pointing down, the same support components may compensate for the forces of both the drill and gravity at once. However, though monodirectional, the force applied by drills tends to be concentrated on a very small area. Drilling fixtures must be designed carefully to prevent the workpiece from bending under the force of the drill.{{sfn|Colvin|Haas|1938|loc=Ch. 10}}

The '''Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents''' (FIPA) is a body for developing and setting  [[computer software]] standards for heterogeneous and interacting [[Software agent|agents]] and agent-based systems.

FIPA was founded as a Swiss [[not-for-profit]] organization in 1996 with the ambitious goal of defining a full set of standards for both implementing systems within which agents could execute (agent platforms) and specifying how agents themselves should communicate and interoperate in a standard way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poslad|first=S.|title=Specifying Protocols for Multi-agent System Interaction|year=2007|journal=ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems|volume=4|issue=4|doi=10.1145/1293731.1293735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within its lifetime the organization's membership included several academic institutions and a large number of companies including [[Hewlett Packard]], [[IBM]], [[British Telecom|BT]] (formerly British Telecom), [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Fujitsu]] and many more.  A number of standards were proposed, however, despite several agent platforms adopting the "FIPA standard" for agent communication it never succeeded in gaining the commercial support which was originally envisaged. The Swiss organization was dissolved in 2005 and an [[IEEE]] standards committee was set up in its place.

The most widely adopted of the FIPA standards are the Agent Management and [[Agent Communication Language]] (FIPA-ACL) specifications.

The name FIPA is somewhat of a [[misnomer]] as the "physical [[Software agent|agents]]" with which the body is concerned exist solely in software (and hence have no physical aspect).

{{nihongo|'''Funai Electric Co., Ltd.'''|船井電機株式会社|Funai Denki Kabushiki Kaisha}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[consumer electronics]] company headquartered in [[Daitō, Osaka|Daitō]], [[Osaka Prefecture|Osaka]], [[Japan]]. Its United States-based subsidiary '''Funai''' Corporation, Inc., based in [[Torrance, California]], markets Funai products in the US along with Funai-licensed brands including [[Magnavox]], [[Emerson Radio]], and [[Sanyo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.funai.us/our-brands/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110080833/http://www.funai.us/our-brands/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 November 2016  | date=10 November 2016|title=Our Brands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funai is the main supplier of electronics to [[Walmart]] and [[Sam's Club]] stores in the US,{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} with production output in excess of 2 million flat-panel televisions during the summertime per year for [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] sale. Funai is the [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] providing assembled [[television]]s and video players/recorders to major corporations such as [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]], [[Toshiba]], [[Denon]], and others.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Funai also manufactures [[Printer (computing)|printers]] for [[Dell]] and [[Lexmark]] and produces printers under the Kodak name.

==History==
Funai was founded by Tetsuro Funai, the son of a sewing machine manufacturer. During the 1950s before the company was formed, Funai produced sewing machines and was one of the first Japanese makers to enter the United States retail market. Then, the introduction of transistor technology had begun to change the face of the electronics market. The Funai company was formed, Tetsuro Funai became CEO for 47 years and a US dollar billionaire, and the first actual products produced were the transistor radios.

In 1980, Funai launched a sales and manufacturing subsidiary in Germany. Funai also developed the [[Compact Video Cassette]] (CVC) format in the same year, a joint development with [[Technicolor]], trying to compete with [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]]. Sales were poor and not well-received due to ongoing VHS vs. Beta war, and the CVC format was abandoned a few years later.

Funai began to see rising sales of the [[VHS]] format, so in 1984, Funai released its first VHS video cassette player (VP-1000) for the worldwide market, while ordering all transport chassis mechanisms from [[Shintom]] for quick and efficient production. By the late 1980s, Funai quickly became the largest 2-head mono VHS [[video cassette recorder]] (VCR) manufacturer in Japan.

In 1991, a U.S. sales subsidiary was established in New Jersey, and it began to sell [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) televisions. In 1992, Funai canceled its contract from [[Shintom]] due to the rising cost of VCR chassis mechanism and the expensive Japanese labor, and decided to build its own lower-cost chassis mechanism instead. This creative move dramatically boosted up profits and reduced VCR prices down fast. Funai developed a new, permanent strategy in 1993 by opening two new state-of-the-art factories in China, which transferred all VHS VCRs production out from Japan. By 1997, Funai became the first manufacturer to sell a new VHS VCR below $100 for the North American Market, while Philips Magnavox brand they produced for was the best-seller. Quickly, Tetsuro Funai, the founder, became Japan's first US dollar billionaire electronic CEO. Later, the [[DVD]] technology was formed, and by 2001, Funai sold its first DVD player for less than $100.  By then, Funai's U.S. subsidiary had relocated to Torrance, California.  Today, Funai is one of the world's largest producer of DVD players, and is now one of the major suppliers of electronics to Wal-Mart on [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]]

In 2008, CEO and founder Tetsuro Funai retired and stepped down from CEO to become chairman. Philips signed a seven-year contract with Funai to license, sell, and distribute [[Philips]]- and [[Magnavox]]-branded televisions in [[North America]].&lt;ref name="Funai Owns Magnavox"&gt;{{cite web

Funai acquired more than 1,500 inkjet patents, Lexmark's inkjet-related research and development assets and tools, all outstanding shares and the manufacturing facility of Lexmark International (Philippines), Inc., and other inkjet-related technologies and assets. Through this transaction, Funai acquired the capabilities to develop, manufacture and sell inkjet hardware as well as inkjet supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://newsroom.lexmark.com/2013-04-01-Funai-acquiring-Lexmarks-inkjet-related-technology-and-assets | title=Funai acquiring Lexmark's inkjet-related technology and assets | publisher=Newsroom.lexmark.com | date=April 1, 2013 | accessdate= September 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==VHS videotape==

'''Geoffrey Gunther Eichholz''', (June 29, 1920 – January 8, 2018) an educational leader in health physics at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]. Dr. Eichholz played a key role in the successful establishment of the Department of Nuclear Engineering and Health Physics. The Department has been a constant source of well-educated and well trained graduates in the field of nuclear engineering, health physics and medical physics. Professor Eichholz was involved at all levels of the educational ladder including leadership roles and participation in doctoral and masters committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geoffrey G. Eichholz, PhD|url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/atlanta/obituary.aspx?page=lifestory&amp;pid=188143963|publisher=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and times==
Eichholz was born on 29 June 1920 in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]] to Max Eichholz and Adele "Daisy" née Elias. Dr. Max Eichholz was a lawyer and senior member of the [[Hamburg Parliament|Hamburg City Parliament]] and a well-known opponent of the [[Nazi]] party. As a result, after 1933, his father was severely persecuted and arrested multiple times. In 1943, Dr. Max Eichholz died at [[Auschwitz]].

At the age of 18 during [[Kristallnacht]] the Nazis expelled him from [[Berlin Technical University]] and he was forced to leave his home country. Relatives in England offered him a place to stay.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Michael T. (December 2004). 2004 Robley D. Evans Commemorative Medal. Health Physics. 87(6): 575-576.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and training==
In 1938, Eichholz graduated from the [[Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums|Johanneum High School]]. He attended the [[Berlin Technical University]] for two partial semesters that ended on 9 November 1938 during [[Krystallnacht]]. He was expelled from the University and was fortunate to escape arrest after witnessing the destruction and burning of [[synagogues]]. Early in 1939 Eichholz was awarded a Refugee Scholarship from [[Harvard University]] effective in the following Fall semester. With this information, he was able to secure a [[transit visa]] to [[Great Britain]] where he could stay with relatives.

In March 1939, Eichholz arrived in England without any money to his name. He obtained a position as an unpaid research assistant in the physics department at [[Bristol University]]. 
A distant relative, David Eichholz, Professor in Classics at the [[University of Bristol]] set young Eichholz up with a position as an unpaid researcher for Professor [[Arthur Mannering Tyndall]], Department of Physics. Eichholz worked for [[Cecil F. Powell]] scanning [[photographic emulsion]]s.&lt;ref name=Bristol&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.alumni.bris.ac.uk/publications/nonesuch/2010-summer.pdf |title=This is My Bristol, Geoffrey G. Eichholz |journal=The University of Bristol Magazine |date=Summer 2010 |issue=Summer 2010 |pages=36–37 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He worked alongside another refugee, Harald Rossi. In 1950, Powell would go on to be awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in Physics for his discovery of [[pi mesons]] in these very same photographic emulsions.&lt;ref name=Bristol&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.alumni.bris.ac.uk/publications/nonesuch/2010-summer.pdf |title=This is My Bristol, Geoffrey G. Eichholz |journal=The University of Bristol Magazine |date=Summer 2010 |issue=Summer 2010 |pages=36–37 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1939, war in Europe erupted and Eichholz was called into duty as a firewatch on top of the Physics tower. He was formally recognized as a [[Association of Jewish Refugees|Victim of Nazi Oppression]]. Due to the outbreak of war, the U.S. [[Consulate General]] refused to grant Eichholz a [[student visa]]. At this point Professor Tyndall arranged for Eichholz to be admitted to Bristol as a first-year honours student with tuition and fees waived. Eichholz was formally matriculated by [[Chancellor]] [[Winston Churchill]]. At Bristol, as an undergraduate student Eichholz had on occasion interacted with noteworthy scientists including: [[Walter Heitler]], [[Herbert Fröhlich]], Kurt Hoselitz and Hans Heitler.&lt;ref name=Bristol/&gt; Finally in February 1940, Eichholz was reunited with his mother who had escaped from Germany one week before the War.

In May 1940, after the [[Battle of Dunkirk]], all male refugee [[enemy aliens]] were [[interned]]. Eichholz spent the summer under canvas and was eventually transferred to the [[Isle of Man]]. In December 1940, he was released and rejoined his mother, now in [[Bradford, Yorkshire]]. A recommendation from Tyndall and an interview with Professor [[Edmund Clifton Stoner]] at the [[University of Leeds]] garnered Eichholz admittance to Leeds as a second year physics student in the midst of an accelerated wartime curriculum. In May 1942, he graduated with [[First-Class Honours]] in [[physics]]. [[James Chadwick]] was the [[external examiner]]. Eichholz was assigned to the [[Admiralty Research Establishment|Admiralty Signal Establishment]], [[Witley, Surrey]] for work on [[radar]] development. The assignment involved work with [[microwaves]] and [[waveguides]], state of the art technology at the time.&lt;ref name=Bristol/&gt;

At the end of [[World War II]], in January 1946, Eichholz returned to his studies at Leeds to complete his PhD. 
Professor Stoner suggested the topic of Magnetic Resonances at Microwave Frequencies.  The thesis in physics was completed in September 1947, passed the oral examination and scrutiny by the external examiner in [[Sheffield]] and the oral presentation was completed just prior to departing via ship to Canada.

==Canada==
In early 1947, Eichholz had replied to an advertisement in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] for a faculty position at the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC) and was offered the position of [[assistant professor]], contingent upon completion of his PhD and becoming a British citizen. The conditions were met and so he began a long trip to [[Vancouver]], with 5 days at sea, followed by 6 days by train across Canada.

Eichholz experienced [[culture shock]] as he encountered the change from wartime England to the immensity of Canada. At UBC Eichholz was assigned teaching duties with returning veterans as his primary student group. He had to establish laboratories and initiate research projects in [[nuclear physics]]. He became involved with [[ionizing radiation]] and [[Particle detector|radiation detection]]. A productive summer was spent at the [[AECL]] [[Chalk River Laboratories]], and he witnessed the startup of the [[NRX|NRX Reactor]]. During his time off, he enjoyed sailing on the [[Ottawa River]] with [[W.B. Lewis]]. Lewis was known as the father of the [[CANDU]] nuclear reactor.

In 1951, Eichholz moved to [[Ottawa]] and accepted a position with the [[Ministry of Northern Development and Mines|Canadian Bureau of Mines]], as head of the Physics and Radiotracer Subdivision. The work focused on uranium assays of ores and minerals. Later projects involved development of novel [[Particle detector|radiation detectors]] and the utilization of [[radioisotopes]] in industry.&lt;ref&gt;Canada Centre for Mineral and Energy Technology, &amp; Ignatieff, Alexis. (1982). Canadian Research Heritage-75 Years of Federal Government Research in Minerals, Metals and Fuels.&lt;/ref&gt; Eichholz developed the first multiwire spark counter.&lt;ref&gt;Eichholz, G.G. (1952). The Rosenblum Spark Counter. Nucleonics. 10 (10):46-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional studies involved neutron activation analysis to determine the oxygen content in steel and the use of radiotracers in explosives and the steel industry.&lt;ref&gt;Eichholz, G.G.

==Georgia Institute of Technology==
In 1963, Eichholz was recruited by the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (Georgia Tech) for the position of [[Professor]] in the newly established graduate program in the School of [[Nuclear Engineering]]. He remained there for 25 years. At the time the program did not offer an undergraduate degree in nuclear engineering. By the end of the 1960s, a significant program in [[Health Physics]] was added. Eichholz developed additional courses for these programs that added to the breadth and depth of these specialties. He published or coauthored several books for these courses and they include: Radioisotope Engineering, Environmental Aspects of Nuclear Power, Nuclear Radiation Detection, and Radon.&lt;ref&gt;Eichholz, G.G. (1972). Radioisotope Engineering. Marcel Dekker, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eichholz, G.G. (1976). Environmental Aspects of Nuclear Power. Ann Arbor Science.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eichholz, G.G. &amp; Poston, John W. (1979). Principles of Nuclear Radiation Detection. Ann Arbor Science.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eichholz, G. G. (1987). Environmental Radon. Environmental Science Research Series.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 Eichholz was named [[Regents’ Professor]] of Nuclear Engineering.

While at Georgia Tech, Eichholz maintained an active research program that encompassed laboratories in 4 different building on campus. Research focus areas included radiotracer utilization, irradiation effects, radon, and dosimetry. He devoted a great deal of effort to studies on the migration of radioactive material and pollutants through unsaturated soils.

In a somewhat unrelated field, he also taught a course on [[Architectural Acoustics]] in the [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Architecture|College of Architecture]] for over 20 years.

==Leisure activities==

A '''guidance system''' is a virtual or physical device, or a group of devices implementing a guidance process used for controlling the movement of a [[ship]], [[aircraft]], [[missile]], [[rocket]], [[satellite]], or any other moving object. Guidance is the process of calculating the changes in position, velocity, [[attitude control|attitude]], and/or rotation rates of a moving object required to follow a certain trajectory and/or attitude profile based on information about the object's state of motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A guidance system is usually part of a [[Guidance, navigation and control]] system, whereas navigation refers to the systems necessary to calculate the current position and orientation based on sensor data like those from [[compass]]es, [[GPS|GPS receivers]], [[Loran-C]], [[star tracker]]s, [[inertial measurement unit]]s, [[altimeter]]s, etc. The output of the navigation system, the navigation solution, is an input for the guidance system, among others like the environmental conditions (wind, water, temperature, etc.) and the vehicle's characteristics (i.e. mass, control system availability, control systems correlation to vector change, etc.). In general, the guidance system computes the instructions for the control system, which comprises the object's actuators (e.g., [[Spacecraft propulsion|thrusters]], [[reaction wheels]], [[Flap (aeronautics)|body flaps]], etc.), which are able to manipulate the flight path and orientation of the object without direct or continuous human control.

One of the earliest examples of a true guidance system is that used in the German [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]] during [[World War II]]. The navigation system consisted of a simple [[gyroscope]], an [[airspeed]] sensor, and an [[altimeter]]. The guidance instructions were target altitude, target velocity, cruise time, and engine cut off time.

A guidance system has three major sub-sections: Inputs, Processing, and Outputs. The input section includes [[sensor]]s, [[Course (navigation)|course]] data, [[radio]] and [[satellite link]]s, and other information sources. The processing section, composed of one or more [[Central processing unit|CPUs]], integrates this data and determines what actions, if any, are necessary to maintain or achieve a proper [[Aircraft heading|heading]]. This is then fed to the outputs which can directly affect the system's course. The outputs may control [[speed]] by interacting with devices such as [[turbine]]s, and [[fuel pump]]s, or they may more directly alter course by actuating [[aileron]]s, [[rudder]]s, or other devices.

==History==
Inertial guidance systems were originally developed for [[rocket]]s. American rocket pioneer [[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard]] experimented with rudimentary [[gyroscope|gyroscopic]] systems. Dr. Goddard's systems were of great interest to contemporary German pioneers including [[Wernher von Braun]]. The systems entered more widespread use with the advent of [[spacecraft]], [[guided missile]]s, and commercial [[airliner]]s.

US guidance history centers around 2 distinct communities. One driven out of [[Caltech]] and [[NASA]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], the other from the German scientists that developed the early [[V-2 rocket#Technical details|V2 rocket guidance]] and [[MIT]]. The GN&amp;C system for V2 provided many innovations and was the most sophisticated military weapon in 1942 using self-contained closed loop guidance. Early V2s leveraged 2 gyroscopes and lateral accelerometer with a simple analog computer to adjust the azimuth for the rocket in flight. Analog computer signals were used to drive 4 external rudders on the tail fins for flight control. Von Braun engineered the surrender of 500 of his top rocket scientists, along with plans and test vehicles, to the Americans. They arrived in Fort Bliss, Texas in 1945 and were subsequently moved to [[Huntsville, Al]] in 1950 (aka [[Redstone arsenal]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://history.nasa.gov/sputnik/braun.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/photo/50s.html&lt;/ref&gt; Von Braun's passion was interplanetary space flight. However his tremendous leadership skills and experience with the V-2 program made him invaluable to the US military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/astros/vonbraun.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817172206/http://astronautix.com/astros/vonbraun.htm |archivedate=2013-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 the Redstone team was selected to put America's first satellite into orbit putting this group at the center of both military and commercial space.

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory traces its history from the 1930s, when Caltech professor [[Theodore von Karman]] conducted pioneering work in [[rocket propulsion]]. Funded by Army Ordnance in 1942, JPL's early efforts would eventually involve technologies beyond those of aerodynamics and propellant chemistry. The result of the Army Ordnance effort was JPL's answer to the German V-2 missile, named [[MGM-5 Corporal]], first launched in May 1947. On December 3, 1958, two months after the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was created by Congress, JPL was transferred from Army jurisdiction to that of this new civilian space agency. This shift was due to the creation of a military focused group derived from the German V2 team. Hence, beginning in 1958, NASA JPL and the Caltech crew became focused primarily on unmanned flight and shifted away from military applications with a few exceptions. The community surrounding JPL drove tremendous innovation in telecommunication, interplanetary exploration and earth monitoring (among other areas).&lt;ref&gt;http://ethics.jpl.nasa.gov/welcome.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s, the US government wanted to insulate itself against over dependency on the Germany team for military applications. Among the areas that were domestically "developed" was missile guidance. In the early 1950s the [[MIT Instrumentation Laboratory]] (later to become the [[Charles Stark Draper Laboratory]], Inc.) was chosen by the Air Force Western Development Division to provide a self-contained guidance system backup to Convair in San Diego for the new [[Atlas (missile)|Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile]]. The technical monitor for the MIT task was a young engineer named Jim Fletcher who later served as the NASA Administrator. The Atlas guidance system was to be a combination of an on-board autonomous system, and a ground-based tracking and command system. This was the beginning of a philosophic controversy, which, in some areas, remains unresolved. The self-contained system finally prevailed in ballistic missile applications for obvious reasons. In space exploration, a mixture of the two remains.

In the summer of 1952, Dr. [[Richard Battin]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.space.com/peopleinterviews/RichardBattin_profile_991027.html&lt;/ref&gt; and Dr. [[J. Halcombe Laning|J. Halcombe ("Hal") Laning Jr.]], researched computational based solutions to guidance as computing began to step out of the analog approach. As computers of that time were very slow (and missiles very fast) it was extremely important to develop programs that were very efficient. Dr. J. Halcombe Laning, with the help of Phil Hankins and Charlie Werner, initiated work on MAC, an algebraic [[programming language]] for the [[IBM 650]], which was completed by early spring of 1958. MAC became the work-horse of the MIT lab. MAC is an extremely readable language having a three-line format, [[vector-matrix]] notations and [[mnemonic]] and indexed subscripts. Today's Space Shuttle (STS) language called HAL, (developed by Intermetrics, Inc.) is a direct offshoot of MAC. Since the principal architect of HAL was Jim Miller, who co-authored with [[J. Halcombe Laning|Hal Laning]] a report on the MAC system, it is a reasonable speculation that the space shuttle language is named for Jim's old mentor, and not, as some have suggested, for the electronic superstar of the Arthur Clarke movie "2001-A Space Odyssey." (Richard Battin, AIAA 82-4075, April 1982)

Hal Laning and Richard Battin undertook the initial analytical work on the Atlas [[inertial guidance]] in 1954. Other key figures at Convair were Charlie Bossart, the Chief Engineer, and Walter Schweidetzky, head of the guidance group. Walter had worked with Wernher von Braun at Peenemuende during World War II.

The initial "Delta" guidance system assessed the difference in position from a reference trajectory. A velocity to be gained (VGO) calculation is made to correct the current trajectory with the objective of driving VGO to Zero. The mathematics of this approach were fundamentally valid, but dropped because of the challenges in accurate inertial navigation (e.g. IMU Accuracy) and analog computing power. The challenges faced by the "Delta" efforts were overcome by the "Q system" of guidance. The "Q" system's revolution was to bind the challenges of missile guidance (and associated equations of motion) in the matrix Q. The Q matrix represents the partial derivatives of the velocity with respect to the position vector. A key feature of this approach allowed for the components of the vector cross product (v, xdv,/dt) to be used as the basic autopilot rate signals-a technique that became known as "cross-product steering." The [[Q-guidance|Q-system]] was presented at the first Technical Symposium on Ballistic Missiles held at the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation in Los Angeles on June 21 and 22, 1956. The "Q System" was classified information through the 1960s. Derivations of this guidance are used for today's military missiles. The CSDL team remains a leader in the military guidance and is involved in projects for most divisions of the US military.

On August 10 of 1961 NASA Awarded MIT a contract for preliminary design study of a guidance and navigation system for [[Apollo program]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eng.buffalo.edu/~psingla/Teaching/CelestialMechanics/Battin.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (see Apollo on-board guidance, navigation, and control system, Dave Hoag, International Space Hall of Fame Dedication Conference in [[Alamogordo]], N.M., October 1976 &lt;ref&gt;http://web.mit.edu/digitalapollo/Documents/Chapter5/r500.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;). Today's space shuttle guidance is named PEG4 (Powered Explicit Guidance). It takes into account both the Q system and the predictor-corrector attributes of the original "Delta" System (PEG Guidance). Although many updates to the shuttles navigation system have taken place over the last 30 years (ex. GPS in the OI-22 build), the guidance core of today's Shuttle GN&amp;C system has evolved little. Within a manned system, there is a human interface needed for the guidance system. As Astronauts are the customer for the system, many new teams are formed that touch GN&amp;C as it is a primary interface to "fly" the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4205/ch2-4.html&lt;/ref&gt; For the Apollo and STS (Shuttle system) CSDL "designed" the guidance, [[McDonnell Douglas]] wrote the requirements and IBM programmed the requirements.

Much system complexity within manned systems is driven by "redundancy management" and the support of multiple "abort" scenarios that provide for crew safety. Manned US Lunar and Interplanetary guidance systems leverage many of the same guidance innovations (described above) developed in the 1950s. So while the core mathematical construct of guidance has remained fairly constant, the facilities surrounding GN&amp;C continue to evolve to support new vehicles, new missions and new hardware. The center of excellence for the manned guidance remains at MIT (CSDL) as well as the former McDonnell Douglas Space Systems (in Houston).

== Description ==
{{main|Missile guidance|Precision-guided munition#Types}}

Guidance systems consist of 3 essential parts: '''navigation''' which tracks current location, '''guidance''' which leverages navigation data and target information to direct flight control "where to go", and '''control''' which accepts guidance commands to effect change in aerodynamic and/or engine controls.

'''Navigation''' is the art of determining where you are, a science that has seen tremendous focus in 1711 with the [[Longitude prize]]. Navigation aids either measure position from a ''fixed'' point of reference (ex. landmark, north star, LORAN Beacon), ''relative'' position to a target (ex. radar, infra-red, ...) or track ''movement'' from a known position/starting point (e.g. IMU). Today's complex systems use multiple approaches to determine current position. For example, today's most advanced navigation systems are embodied within the [[Anti-ballistic missile]], the [[RIM-161 Standard Missile 3]] leverages GPS, IMU and [[ground segment]] data in the boost phase and relative position data for intercept targeting. Complex systems typically have multiple redundancy to address drift, improve accuracy (ex. relative to a target) and address isolated system failure. Navigation systems therefore take multiple inputs from many different sensors, both internal to the system and/or external (ex. ground based update). [[Kalman filter]] provides the most common approach to combining navigation data (from multiple sensors) to resolve current position. Example navigation approaches:

* [[Celestial navigation]] is a position fixing technique that was devised to help sailors cross the featureless oceans without having to rely on dead reckoning to enable them to strike land. Celestial navigation uses angular measurements (sights) between the horizon and a common celestial object. The Sun is most often measured. Skilled navigators can use the Moon, planets or one of 57 navigational stars whose coordinates are tabulated in nautical almanacs. Historical tools include a [[sextant]], [[watch]] and ephemeris data. Today's space shuttle, and most interplanetary spacecraft, use optical systems to calibrate inertial navigation systems: Crewman Optical Alignment Sight (COAS),&lt;ref&gt;http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/reference/shutref/orbiter/avionics/gnc/coas.html&lt;/ref&gt; Star Tracker.&lt;ref&gt;http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/reference/shutref/orbiter/avionics/gnc/startracker.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Inertial Measurement Unit]]s (IMUs) are the primary inertial system for maintaining current position (navigation) and orientation in missiles and aircraft. They are complex machines with one or more rotating Gyroscopes that can rotate freely in 3 degrees of motion within a complex [[gimbal]] system. IMUs are "spun up" and calibrated prior to launch. A minimum of 3 separate IMUs are in place within most complex systems. In addition to relative position, the IMUs contain accelerometers which can measure acceleration in all axes. The position data, combined with acceleration data provide the necessary inputs to "track" motion of a vehicle. IMUs have a tendency to "drift", due to friction and accuracy. Error correction to address this drift can be provided via ground link [[telemetry]], [[GPS]], [[radar]], optical [[celestial navigation]] and other navigation aids. When targeting another (moving) vehicle, relative vectors become paramount. In this situation, navigation aids which provide updates of position ''relative to the target'' are more important. In addition to the current position, [[inertial navigation]] systems also typically estimate a predicted position for future computing cycles. See also [[Inertial navigation system]].
*[[Astro-inertial guidance]] is a [[sensor fusion]]/[[information fusion]] of the [[Inertial guidance]] and [[Celestial navigation]].
* [[LORAN|Long-range Navigation]] ([[LORAN]]) : This was the predecessor of GPS and was (and to an extent still is) used primarily in commercial sea transportation. The system works by [[triangulation|triangulating]] the ship's position based on directional reference to known [[transmitter]]s.
*[[Global Positioning System]] ([[GPS]]) : GPS was designed by the US military with the primary purpose of addressing "drift" within the inertial navigation of [[Submarine-launched ballistic missile]](SLBMs) prior to launch. GPS transmits 2 signal types: military and a commercial. The accuracy of the military signal is classified but can be assumed to be well under 0.5 meters. GPS is a system of 24 satellites orbiting in unique planes 10.9-14.4 Nautical miles above the earth. The Satellites are in well defined orbits and transmit highly accurate time information which can be used to triangulate position.
{{anchor|Navigation}}
* Radar/Infrared/Laser : This form of navigation provides information to guidance ''relative to a known target'', it has both civilian (ex rendezvous) and military applications.
**[[active radar homing|active]] (employs own radar to [[fire-control system|illuminate the target]]),
**[[anti-radiation missile|passive]] (detects target's radar emissions),
**[[semi-active radar homing|semiactive radar homing]],
**[[Infrared homing]] : This form of guidance is used exclusively for military munitions, specifically [[air-to-air missile|air-to-air]] and [[surface-to-air missile]]s. The missile's seeker head homes in on the [[infrared]] (heat) signature from the target's engines (hence the term "heat-seeking missile"),
**Ultraviolet homing, used in [[FIM-92 Stinger]] - more resistive to countermeasures, than IR homing system
**[[Laser guidance]] : A [[laser designator]] device calculates relative position to a highlighted target. Most are familiar with the military uses of the technology on [[Laser-guided bomb]]. The space shuttle crew leverages a hand held device to feed information into rendezvous planning. The primary limitation on this device is that it requires a [[line of sight (telecommunications)|line of sight]] between the target and the designator.
** Terrain contour matching ([[TERCOM]]). Uses a ground scanning radar to "match" topography against digital map data to fix current position. Used by cruise missiles such as the [[Tomahawk (missile)]].

'''Guidance''' is the "driver" of a vehicle. It takes input from the navigation system (where am I) and uses targeting information (where do I want to go) to send signals to the flight control system that will allow the vehicle to reach its destination (within the operating constraints of the vehicle). The "targets" for guidance systems are one or more state vectors (position and velocity) and can be inertial or relative. During powered flight, guidance is continually calculating steering directions for flight control. For example, the [[space shuttle]] targets an altitude, velocity vector, and gamma to drive main engine cut off. Similarly, an [[Intercontinental ballistic missile]] also targets a vector. The target vectors are developed to fulfill the mission and can be preplanned or dynamically created.

'''Control'''. Flight control is accomplished either aerodynamically or through powered controls such as engines. Guidance sends signals to flight control. A Digital Autopilot (DAP) is the interface between guidance and control. Guidance and the DAP are responsible for calculating the precise instruction for each flight control. The DAP provides feedback to guidance on the state of flight controls.

'''High Power User Equipment (HPUE)''' is a special class of user equipment for the [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] cellular network.

In Release 11 of the LTE standard, [[3GPP]] proposed so called High Power User Equipment (HPUE) for band 14 (700&amp;nbsp;MHz).&lt;ref&gt;3GPP, “TR 36.837 - V11.0.0 - Public safety broadband high power User Equipment (UE) for band 14,” 2012&lt;/ref&gt; While current off-the-shelf [[User equipment|UE]] is only allowed to transmit at a maximum output power of 23 dBm, the HPUE are allowed to transmit with an output power of up to 31 dBm. Since the transmission range depends on the transmit power, the cell range can be increased by nearly 80% and user devices can operate better in challenging RF environments, such as inside large concrete buildings.

The first HPUE has been presented by the Finnish company [[Elektrobit Group|Bittium Oyj]] formerly known as [[Elektrobit Group|Elektrobit]], together with [[Rohde &amp; Schwarz]] at [[Mobile World Congress]] 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Rohde &amp; Schwarz, “Rohde &amp; Schwarz and Elektrobit first to test high-power user equipment for public safety networks on LTE Band 14,” http://www.rohde-schwarz.de/de/news_events/press-room/pressemitteilungen/press-Rohde_%26_Schwarz_and_Elektrobit_first_to_test_high-power_user_equipment_for_public_safety_networks_on_LTE_Band_14_.html?tl=en, 2014, [Online; accessed 05-Jan-2016].&lt;/ref&gt; They implemented the test cases of 3GPP, to show that the use of HPUE does indeed not interfere with adjacent commercial LTE networks.

The first portable, battery-operated device to operate with HPUE capabilities in actual field operation is the HPUE Band 14 Personal Gateway device by Assured Wireless Corporation in early 2017. &lt;ref&gt;"PSC Online, Assured Wireless Demonstrates Industry’s First High Power Portable User Equipment for LTE Band 14 Public Safety Wireless Networks," http://psc.apcointl.org/2017/03/16/assured-wireless-demonstrates-industrys-first-high-power-portable-user-equipment-for-lte-band-14-public-safety-wireless-networks/ 2017&lt;/ref&gt; This device is fully compliant with 3GPP specifications for HPUE and operates at the full 31dBm maximum transmit power levels.  Tests on networks around the U.S. and, specifically, actual public safety user experience at the 2017 Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo &lt;ref&gt;"Mission Critical Communications, Public-Safety LTE High-Power User Devices Tested at Houston Rodeo," https://www.rrmediagroup.com/News/NewsDetails/NewsID/15424, April 2017 &lt;/ref&gt; showed the ability of this HPUE equipment to operate with any LTE Band 14 network with reliable performance that stays connected in areas where all existing standard-power LTE devices fail to connect, while also improving user data rates even in areas of good coverage and increasing overall cell capacity.

The '''International Open Source Network''' has as its slogan "software freedom for all". It is a Centre of Excellence for [[free software]] ([[alternative terms for free software|also known as]] [[FLOSS]], FOSS, or [[open-source software]]) in the Asia-Pacific region.

IOSN says it "shapes its activities around FOSS technologies and applications. It is "tasked specifically to facilitate and network FOSS advocates and human resources in the region."

== FLOSS's perceived potential ==
IOSN's website says: "FOSS presents itself as an access solution for developing countries. It represents an opportunity for these countries to adopt affordable software and solutions towards bridging the [[digital divide]]. Only the use of FOSS permits sustainable development of software; it is technology that is free to learn about, maintain, adapt and reapply".

It explains its emphasis on Free and Open Source Software for the following reasons:
* Universal access to software without restrictions.
* Less dependence on imported technology.
* Freedom to share and collaborate in development efforts.
* Freedom to customize software to local languages and cultures.
* Development of local software capacity.
* Open standards and vendor independence.

Beginning 2008, IOSN is now managed from three centers of excellence: University of the Philippines Manila (ASEAN+3), CDAC in Chennai, India (South Asia), and a consortium composed of members from the academe and government in the Pacific Island Countries (PIC).

==IOSN objectives==
IOSN's objectives include:
* Serve as a clearing house for information on FOSS in the Asia-Pacific region.
* Strengthen current FOSS capacities.
* Assist with the development of needed toolkits and resource materials, including localisation efforts.
* Assist in the coordination of FOSS programmes and initiatives through information sharing and networking in the Asia-Pacific region.

==Affiliations and sponsorships==
IOSN is an initiative of the [[UNDP Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme]] and is supported by the [[International Development Research Centre (IDRC)]].

[[File:Ritter-almanach.png|thumb|Extract from ''Almanach voor't jaar 1796'' 92&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;105&amp;nbsp;mm]]

'''Johann Christian Ritter''' (25 July 1755 &amp;ndash; 9 September 1810)&lt;ref name="Germans at the Cape"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoge|first=J|title=Personalia of the Germans at the Cape|publisher=Archives Year Book for South African History}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a German in the service of the [[Dutch East India Company]] who came to South Africa in 1784.  He was the first to print in the [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape]], the earliest record is an almanac titled "Almanach voor't jaar 1796".

==History==
J.C. Ritter was born in 1755 either in [[Bayreuth]]&lt;ref name="Early Cape Printing"&gt;, "Early Cape Printing 1796–1802", South African Library Reprint Series, No. 1, South African Library, Cape Town, (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Hof an der Saale]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Names of German Immigrants 1652–1806 (L-R) |url=http://www.safrika.org/Names/PersonaliaL-R.html|accessdate=2 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Monolith to Microfilm"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewin Robinson|first=A.M.|title=From Monolith to Microfilm: a story of the recorded word|year=1979|publisher=South African Library|isbn=0-86968-020-X|location=Cape Town}}&lt;/ref&gt; these are cities less than 50&amp;nbsp;km distant from each other in Germany and may have referred to the same place. He was the Son of the book binder Georg Stephan Ritter and his wife Johanna Dorothea (née. Leidenforst).  He married Barbara Fuhrmann of Danzig and they had no children and she died after him in 1813-6-9.&lt;ref name="The Culture of the German share in the construction of the Boer nation"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmidt-Pretoria|first=Werner|title=Der Kulturanteil des Deutschtums am Aufbau des Burenvolkes|year=1938|location=Hannover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was in the service of the [[Dutch East India Company]] when he arrived&lt;ref name="Five Hundred Years of Printing"&gt;SH Steinberg, "Five Hundred Years of Printing", Penguin Books, Middlesex, (1955) 2nd ed. 1961, p.214&lt;/ref&gt; at the Cape Colony in the later half of 1784 and was appointed by them in 1794 to print government notices, forms and so forth.&lt;ref name="Monolith to Microfilm"/&gt;

In the 10 years before he started to print he bound books,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewin Robinson|first=A.M.|title=From Monolith to Microfilm: a story of the recorded word|year=1979|publisher=South African Library|isbn=0-86968-020-X|location=Cape Town}}p.37&lt;/ref&gt; he may have been a book binder by trade&lt;ref name="Early Cape Printing"/&gt; when he arrived at the Cape though it may be that he took on this work through familiarity, having been the son of a bookbinder.&lt;ref name="South Africa in Print"&gt;, "South Africa in Print", Book Exhibition Committee van Riebeeck Festival, Cape Town, (1952), facing p.157 p.160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Travels Into ..

He died at the age of 55.

==Legacy==

It is not certain if he brought the small hand-press with him&lt;ref name="Early Cape Printing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="South Africa in Print"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Travels Into .. Southern Africa"/&gt; or if the press only arrived later when he prepared for printing or was appointed to the task.&lt;ref name="Monolith to Microfilm"/&gt;

He undertook to print official forms and handbills as well as almanacs. The surviving (1796) almanac was printed in 1795.&lt;ref name="South Africa in Print"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Travels Into .. Southern Africa"/&gt; As he also printed almanacs for at least the years 1795 and 1797, so he would likely have started his printing in 1794 or before but none of his earlier work has been discovered.&lt;ref name="Monolith to Microfilm"/&gt; His almanac did not bring him any great financial reward, having been used by many to copy out of by hand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnard|first1=Anne Lindsay|title=South Africa a century ago; letters written from the Cape of Good Hope (1791–1801)|date=1901|publisher=Smith, Elder|location=London|page=305|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=yale.39002040501190;view=1up;seq=325|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; notwithstanding some factual errors relating to dates of lunar eclipses.&lt;ref name="South Africa in Print"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Travels Into .. Southern Africa"/&gt; Only one copy of the first leaf is known to exist in the Sir George Grey Collection of the [[National Library of South Africa|South African Library]]&lt;ref name="Early Cape Printing"/&gt; and this one may be a proof sheet.&lt;ref name="Monolith to Microfilm"/&gt;

Soon after 1797 when the British took occupation of the Cape, permission to print was transferred to Messrs Walker and Robertson who had questionable ties with the briefly serving governor [[Sir George Yonge, 5th Baronet|Sir George Yonge]] even though Ritter and [[Harry Harwood Smith]], a printing contemporary of his, had petitioned for the printing rights.&lt;ref name="Monolith to Microfilm"/&gt;

Ritter's press may also have been used in 1799 by [[Valentine Alexius Schoonberg|V.A. Schoonberg]] for printing the first book in South Africa which was also the first printed religious text. It was a translation, into Dutch, of a letter brought to the Cape, and published, by [[Johannes van der Kemp|J.T. van der Kemp]] of the London Missionary Society.&lt;ref name="Early Cape Printing"/&gt; It was used to print a military proclamation in 1799 as it was the only available press.&lt;ref name="The Culture of the German share in the construction of the Boer nation"/&gt;

'''Lead picrate''', Pb(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is an organic chemical compound from the group of [[picrate]]s, salt of [[picric acid]] and [[lead]] with a +2 [[oxidation state]]. It is an initiating explosive, and thus highly sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = High Energy Materials: Propellants, Explosives and Pyrotechnics | author = Jai Prakash Agrawal | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | date = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For demonstration purposes, it can be most easily and safely prepared ''in situ''. [[Picric acid]] is mixed with [[red lead]] (Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and then heated. It is not recommended that more than 50&amp;nbsp;mg is ever made at any one time. At around 130–160&amp;nbsp;°C, as the picric acid melts, the mixture detonates violently.

The '''Llandarcy Oil Refinery''' was the UK's first [[oil refinery]] in 1922, owned by BP. Previously to this refinery, the only oil refined in the UK came from Scottish shale. 

==History==
It was known as the National Oil Refinery and BP Llandarcy. BP would later have its [[Kent Refinery]] and [[Grangemouth Refinery]]. 

===Construction===
Construction began in February 1919, with a new railway line; it cost £3m. The refinery was formally opened on 29 June 1922 by [[Stanley Baldwin]], President of the Board of Trade.

In 1961 a new oil terminal was built by BP at [[Angle Bay]] in [[Pembrokeshire]].

===Production===
When opened it was making around 150,000 gallons of petrol a day. In 1960 it was refining 8 million tons of crude oil a year. It was the third biggest oil refinery in the UK after [[Fawley Refinery]] and [[Lindsey Oil Refinery]].

===Closure===
It closed in 1998. The site was demolished in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/looking-ahead-new-village-skyline-2073847 Demolition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The site of the refinery was off the Llandarcy Interchange of the present-day [[M4 motorway|M4]], near the B4290 and [[Skewen]]. The area is known as [[Coedffranc]]. To the south, off the [[A483 road|A483]], is [[Crymlyn Burrows]].

The site covered 650 acres.

A '''magnetoquasistatic field''' is a class of [[electromagnetic field]] in which a slowly oscillating magnetic field is dominant. A magnetoquasistatic field is typically generated by ''low-frequency'' induction from a magnetic dipole or a current loop. The magnetic near-field of such an emitter behaves differently from the more commonly used far-field [[electromagnetic radiation]]. At low frequencies the rate of change of the instantaneous field strength with each cycle is relatively slow, giving rise to the name "magneto-quasistatic". The near field or quasistatic region typically extends no more than a wavelength from the antenna, and within this region the electric and magnetic fields are approximately decoupled.

Weakly conducting non-magnetic bodies, including the human body and many mineral rocks, are effectively transparent to magnetoquasistatic fields, allowing for the transmission and reception of signals through such obstacles. Also, long-wavelength (i.e. low-frequency) signals are better able to propagate round corners than shorter-wave signals. Communication therefore need not be line-of-sight.

The communication range of such signals depends on both the wavelength and the electromagnetic properties of the intervening medium at the chosen frequency, and is typically limited to a few tens of meters.

==Physical principles==
The laws of primary interest are [[Ampère's circuital law]] (with the displacement current density neglected) and the magnetic flux continuity law. These laws have associated with them continuity conditions at interfaces. In the absence of magnetizable materials, these laws determine the magnetic field intensity H given its source, the current density J. H is not everywhere irrotational. However, it is solenoidal everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Haus, Hermann A., and James R. Melcher, Electromagnetic Fields and Energy. (Massachusetts Institute of Technology: MIT OpenCourseWare). http://ocw.mit.edu [http://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-6-001-electromagnetic-fields-and-energy-spring-2008/chapter-8/08.pdf] (accessed 18 June 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment design==
A typical antenna comprises a 50-turn coil around a polyoxymehtylene tube with diameter 16.5&amp;nbsp;cm, driven by a class E [[oscillator]] circuit. Such a device is readily portable when powered by batteries. Similarly, a typical receiver consist of an active receiving loop with diameter of one meter, an ultra-low-noise amplifier, and a [[band-pass filter]].&lt;ref name="arumugam2014"&gt;D. Arumugam, Two-dimensional position measurement using magnetoquasistatic fields http://disneyresearch.com [http://www.disneyresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/AWPC_2011_Arumugam.pdf] pg.2 (accessed 17 June 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

In operation the oscillator drives current through the transmitting loop to create an oscillating magnetic field. This field induces a voltage in the receiving loop, which is then amplified.&lt;ref name="arumugam2014" /&gt;

Because the quasistatic region is defined within one wavelength of the electromagnetic source, emitters are limited to a frequency range between about 1&amp;nbsp;kHz and 1&amp;nbsp;MHz. Reducing the oscillating frequency increases the wavelength and hence the range of the quasistatic region, but reduces the induced voltage in the receiving loops which worsens the signal-to-noise ratio. In experiments carried out by the Carnegie Institute of Technology, the maximum range reported by was 50 meters.&lt;ref&gt;Arumugam, D. D. (2011). Position and orientation measurements using magnetoquasistatic fields. (Order No. 3516108, Carnegie Mellon University). ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, 159. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/1027933791&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Resonant inductive coupling===
{{main|Resonant inductive coupling}}
In resonant coupling, the source and receiver are tuned to resonate at the same frequency and are given similar impedances. This allows power as well as information to flow from the source to the receiver. Such coupling via the magnetoquasistatic field is called [[resonant inductive coupling]] and can be used for [[wireless energy transfer]].

Applications include [[induction cooking]], [[induction charger|induction charging]] of batteries and some kinds of [[RFID tag]].

===Communications===
Conventional electromagnetic communication signals cannot pass through the ground. Most mineral rock is neither electrically conducting nor magnetic, allowing magnetic fields to penetrate. Magnetoquasistatic systems have been successfully used for underground wireless communication, both surface-to-underground and between underground parties.{{citation needed|date=June 2014|reason=needs referencing}}

At extremely low frequencies, below about 1&amp;nbsp;kHz, the wavelength is long enough for long-distance communication, although at a slow data rate. Such systems have been installed in submarines, with the local antenna comprising a wire up to several kilometers in length and trailed behind the vessel when at or near the surface.{{citation needed|date=June 2014|reason=needs referencing}}

===Position and orientation tracking===
Wireless position tracking is being increasingly used in applications such as navigation, security, and asset tracking. Conventional position tracking devices use high frequencies or microwaves, including [[global positioning systems]] (GPS), [[ultra-wide band]] (UWB) systems, and [[radio frequency identification]] systems (RFID), but these systems can easily be blocked by obstacles in their path. Magnetoquasistatic positioning takes advantage of the fact that the fields are largely undisturbed when in the presence of human beings and physical structures, and can be used for both position and orientation tracking for ranges up to 50 meters.

To accurately determine the orientation and position of a dipole/emitter, allowance must be made not only for the field pattern generated by the emitter, but also for the [[eddy-currents]] they induce in the earth, which create secondary fields detectable by the receivers. By using complex image theory to correct this field generation from earth, and by using [[frequencies]] on the order of a few hundred kilohertz to obtain the required [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR), it is possible to analyze the position of the dipole through [[azimuthal]] orientation, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, and [[inclination]] orientation, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.

A [[Disney]] research team has used this technology to effectively determine the position and orientation of an American football, something not traceable through conventional wave propagation techniques due to human body obstruction. They inserted an oscillator-driven coil, around the diameter of the center of the ball, to generate the magnetoquasistatic field. The signal was able to pass undisturbed through multiple players.

[[File:William Scott Luce Window Malmesbury Abbey.jpg|thumb|A Morris &amp; Co. [[stained glass window]] to a design by [[Edward Burne-Jones]] installed in [[Malmesbury Abbey]]. The window shows characteristic themes based on [[King Arthur|Arthurian legends]].]]

'''Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co.''' (1861–1875) was a [[furniture|furnishings]] and [[decorative arts]] manufacturer and retailer founded by the artist and designer [[William Morris]] with friends from the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]]. With its successor '''Morris &amp; Co.''' (1875–1940) the firm's [[Middle Ages|medieval]]-inspired aesthetic and respect for [[craft|hand-craftsmanship]] and traditional [[textile arts]] had a profound influence on the decoration of churches and houses into the early 20th century.

Although its most influential period was during the flourishing of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] in the 1880s and 1890s, Morris &amp; Co. remained in operation in a limited fashion from [[World War I]] until its closure in 1940.  The firm's designs are still sold today under licences given to [[Sanderson and Sons]] part of the [[Walker Greenbank]] wallpaper and fabrics business (which owns the "Morris &amp; Co." brand&lt;ref&gt;http://www.walkergreenbank.com/morris-and-co-anniversary.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty of London]].

==Early years==
[[File:William Morris design for Trellis wallpaper 1862.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Design for ''Trellis'' wallpaper, 1862]]

Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co., "Fine Art Workmen in Painting, Carving, Furniture and the Metals," was jointly created by Morris, [[Ford Madox Brown]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[Charles Joseph Faulkner|Charles Faulkner]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[Peter Paul Marshall|P. P. Marshall]], and [[Philip Webb]] in 1861 to create and sell medieval-inspired, handcrafted items for the home.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;''Dictionary of National Biography'', 1901, "William Morris"&lt;/ref&gt; The  prospectus set forth that the firm would undertake carving, [[stained glass]],  metal-work, paper-hangings, [[chintz]]es (printed fabrics), and [[carpet]]s.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Morris, William |volume=18 |pages=871–873 |first=Arthur |last=Waugh }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first headquarters of the firm were at 8 [[Red Lion Square]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The work shown by the firm at the [[1862 International Exhibition]] attracted much notice, and within a few years it was flourishing. In the autumn of 1864 a severe illness obliged Morris to choose between giving up his home at [[Red House (London)|Red House]] in Kent and giving up his work in London. With great reluctance he gave up Red House, and in 1865 established himself under the same roof with his workshops, now relocated to larger premises in Queen Square, [[Bloomsbury]].&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt;

The decoration of churches was from the first an important part of the business. A great wave of church-building and remodelling by the [[Church of England]] in the 1840s and 1850s increased the demand for ecclesiastical decoration of all kinds, especially stained glass.  But this market shrank in the general depression of the later 1860s, and the firm increasingly turned to secular commissions.&lt;ref name="Bus"&gt;Charles Harvey and Jon Press, "The Businessman." in Parry, ''William Morris'', pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;  On its non-ecclesiastical side, the product line was extended to include, besides painted windows and mural decoration, furniture, metal and glass wares, cloth and paper wall-hangings, [[embroidery|embroideries]], [[jewellery]], woven and knotted carpets, [[silk]] [[damask]]s, and [[tapestry|tapestries]].

Morris was producing repeating patterns for wallpaper as early as 1862, and some six years later he designed his first pattern specifically for fabric printing. As in so many other areas that interested him, Morris chose to work with the ancient technique of [[woodblock printing on textiles|hand woodblock printing]] in preference to the [[roller printing on textiles|roller printing]] which had almost completely replaced it for commercial uses.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parry, pp. 36"&gt;Parry, ''William Morris Textiles'', pp. 36–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reorganization and expansion==
In August 1874, Morris determined to restructure the partnership, generating a dispute with Marshall, Rossetti, and Madox Brown over the return on their shares. The company was dissolved and reorganized under Morris's sole ownership as Morris &amp; Co. on 31 March 1875.&lt;ref name="Bus" /&gt;

During these years, Morris took up the practical art of dyeing as a necessary adjunct of his manufacturing business. He spent much of his time at the [[Staffordshire]] dye works of [[Thomas Wardle (industrialist)|Thomas Wardle]], mastering the processes of that art and making experiments in the revival of old or discovery of new methods. One result of these experiments was to reinstate [[indigo dye|indigo]] dyeing as a practical industry, and generally to renew the use of those vegetable dyes, like [[Rose madder|madder]], which had been driven almost out of use by the [[aniline dyes|anilines]].

Dyeing of wools, silks, and cottons was the necessary preliminary to what he had much at heart, the production of woven and printed fabrics of the highest excellence; and the period of incessant work at the dye-vat (1875–76) was followed by a period during which he was absorbed in the production of textiles (1877–78), and more especially in the revival of carpet-weaving as a fine art.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parry, pp. 36"/&gt;

[[File:L L Pocock Pond at Merton Abbey.jpg|thumb|''The Pond at Merton Abbey'' by [[Lexden Lewis Pocock]] is an idyllic representation of the works in the time of William Morris.]]
In June 1881, Morris relocated his dyeworks from Queen Square to an early eighteenth-century silk-throwing works at [[Merton Abbey Mills]], after determining that the water of the [[River Wandle]] was suitable for dyeing.  The complex, on {{convert|7|acre|m2}}, included several buildings and a dyeworks, and the various buildings were soon adapted for stained-glass, textile printing, and fabric- and carpet-weaving.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, ''William Morris'', p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, Morris had taught himself [[tapestry]] weaving in the medieval style and set up a tapestry workshop with his apprentice [[John Henry Dearle]] at Queen Square.&lt;ref name="Text1"&gt;Parry, Linda: ''William Morris Textiles'', New York, Viking Press, pp. 103–104&lt;/ref&gt;  Dearle executed Morris and Co.'s first figural tapestry from a design by [[Walter Crane]] in 1883.&lt;ref name="Tapestry"&gt;Waggoner, ''The Beauty of Life'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Dearle was soon responsible for the training of all tapestry apprentices in the expanded workshop at Merton Abbey, and partnered with Morris on designing details such as fabric patterns and floral backgrounds for tapestries based on figure drawings or ''cartoons'' by Burne-Jones (some of them repurposed from stained glass cartoons).&lt;ref name="Text1" /&gt; and animal figures by Philip Webb. Suites of tapestries were made as part of whole-house decorating schemes, and tapestries of Burne-Jones angels and scenes from the [[King Arthur|Arthurian legends]] were a staple of Morris &amp; Co. into the twentieth century.

==Important commissions==
Two significant secular commissions helped establish the firm's reputation in the late 1860s: a royal project at [[St. James's Palace]] and the "green dining room" at the South Kensington Museum (now the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|Victoria and Albert]]) of 1867. The green dining room (preserved as the Morris Room at the V&amp;A) featured stained glass windows and panel figures by Burne-Jones, panels with branches of fruit or flowers by Morris, and olive branches and a frieze by Philip Webb. The St. James's commission comprised decorative schemes for the Armoury and the Tapestry Room, and included panels of stylized floral patterns painted on ceilings, [[cornice]]s, [[Dado (architecture)|dado]]s, windows, and doors.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Parry, "Domestic Decoration." In Parry, ''William Morris'', pp. 139–140&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871 Morris &amp; Co. were responsible for the windows at [[All Saints Church, Wilden|All Saints]] church in the village of [[Wilden, Worcestershire|Wilden]] near to [[Stourport-on-Severn]]. They were designed by [[Edward Burne-Jones]] for [[Alfred Baldwin (politician)|Alfred Baldwin]], his wife's brother-in-law.

[[Standen]] near [[East Grinstead]], [[West Sussex]], was designed between 1892 and 1894 by Philip Webb for a prosperous [[London]] solicitor, James Beale, his wife Margaret, and their family. It is decorated with Morris carpets, fabrics and wallpapers.

Stanmore Hall was the last major decorating commission executed by Morris &amp; Co. before Morris's death in 1896. It was also the most extensive commission undertaken by the firm, and included a series of [[Holy Grail tapestries|tapestries based on the story of the Holy Grail]] for the dining room, to which Morris devoted his energies, the rest of the work being executed under the direction of Dearle.&lt;ref name="Dom"&gt;Linda Parry, "Domestic Decoration." In Parry, ''William Morris'', pp. 146–147&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Morris &amp; Co. commissions include the ceiling within the dining room of [[Charleville Forest Castle]], Ireland, interiors of Bullers Wood House, now [[Bullers Wood School]] in [[Chislehurst]], [[Kent]], and stained glass windows at [[Adcote]].

==Last stages==
[[File:Morris and Company Textile Printing Merton Abbey.jpg|thumb|Textile printing at [[Merton Abbey Mills|Merton Abbey]] c. 1890, from a booklet commemorating the 50th anniversary of the firm, 1911]]

As Morris pursued other interests, notably [[socialism]] and the [[Kelmscott Press]], day-to-day work at the firm was delegated. Morris's daughter [[May Morris|May]] became the director of the embroidery department in 1885, when she was in her early twenties.  Dearle, who had begun designing repeating patterns for wallpapers and textiles in the late 1880s,&lt;ref name="Text2"&gt;Parry, Linda: ''William Morris Textiles'', pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; was head designer for the firm by 1890, handling interior design commissions and supervising the tapestry, weaving, and fabric-printing departments at [[Merton Abbey Mills|Merton Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Linda, ed.: ''William Morris'', Abrams, 1996, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Dearle's contributions to textile design were long overshadowed by Morris. Dearle exhibited his designs under the Morris name rather than his own in the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts Exhibition]]s and the major Morris retrospective of 1899,&lt;ref name="TAC"&gt;Parry, Linda: ''Textiles of the Arts &amp; Crafts Movement'', Thames and Hudson, revised edition 2005, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Linda: ''William Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement: A Sourcebook'', New York, Portland House, 1989, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; and even today many Dearle designs are popularly offered as "William Morris" patterns.

On Morris's death in 1896, Dearle became Art Director of the firm, which changed its name again to Morris &amp; Co. Decorators Ltd. in 1905.&lt;ref name="Dom" /&gt; Dearle managed the company's textile works at Merton Abbey until his own death in 1932.&lt;ref name="TAC" /&gt; The firm was finally dissolved in the early months of [[World War II]].

'''Oil mist lubrication''' oils are applied to [[Rolling-element bearing|rolling element]] (antifriction) bearings as an oil mist. Neither [[Ring oiler|oil rings]] nor constant level lubricators are used in pumps and drivers connected to plant-wide oil mist systems. Oil mist is an atomized amount of oil carried or suspended in a volume of pressurized dry air. The oil mist, actually a ratio of one volume of oil suspended or carried in 200,000 volumes of clean, dry air, moves in a piping system (header).  The point of origin is usually a [[mixing valve]] (the oil mist generator), connected to this header. Branch lines often feed oil mist to hundreds of rolling elements in the many pumps and drivers connected to a plant-wide system. 

At standstill, or while on standby, pump and driver bearings are preserved by the surrounding oil mist, which exists in the bearing housing space at a pressure just barely higher than ambient. These pump and driver bearings are lubricated from the time when atomized oil globules join (or wet out) to become larger oil droplets. This joining-into-large-droplets starts whenever the equipment shafts rotate, which is when small globules come into contact with each other and start coating the bearing elements. 

As of April 2017 over 150,000 process centrifugal pumps are operating with oil mist as the sole bearing lubricant. The estimated number of electric motors on pure oil mist exceeds 27,000; several of these at a Texas Gulf Coast petrochemical facility have been in flawless service since 1978. &lt;ref. Bloch &amp; Shamim, "Oil Mist Lubrication: Practical Applications," The Fairmont Press, Lilburn, GA, {{ISBN|0-88173-256-7}} &gt;&lt;/ref. Bloch, "Pump Wisdom: Problem Solving for Operators and Specialists," John Wiley &amp; Sons, Hoboken, NJ, {{ISBN|978-1-118-04123-9}}&gt;

There are also plant-wide oil distribution systems whereby liquid oil (not an oil/air mixture) is pressurized and injected, through [[spray nozzle]]s, into the pump bearings. These oil spray systems are not to be confused with the more economical oil mist systems. However, both oil mist and oil spray applications can take credit for lower [[Friction loss|frictional losses]] and both should be taken into account while performing cost justification analyses.

An [[optical modulator]] is an optical device which is used to modulate a beam of light with a perturbation device. It is a kind of transmitter to convert information to optical binary signal through [[optical fiber]] ([[optical waveguide]]) or transmission medium of optical frequency in fiber optic communication. There are several methods to manipulate this device depending on the parameter of a light beam like [[amplitude modulator]] (majority), [[phase modulator]], polarization modulator etc.
The easiest way to obtain modulation is modulation of intensity of a light by the current driving the light source ([[laser diode]]). This sort of modulation is called direct modulation, as opposed to the external modulation performed by a light modulator. For this reason, light modulators are called external light modulators.
According to manipulation of the properties of material modulators are divided into two groups, absorptive modulators ([[absorption coefficient]]) and refractive modulators ([[refractive index]] of the material). [[Absorption coefficient]] can be manipulated by Franz-Keldysh effect, Quantum-Confined [[Stark Effect]], excitonic absorption, or changes of free carrier concentration. Usually, if several such effects appear together, the modulator is called electro-absorptive modulator. Refractive modulators most often make use of [[electro-optic effect]] (amplitude &amp; phase modulation), other modulators are made with [[acousto-optic effect]], [[magneto-optic effect]] such as Faraday and Cotton-Mouton effects. The other case of modulators is [[spatial light modulator]] (SLM) which is modified two dimensional distribution of amplitude &amp; phase of an optical wave.

[[Optical modulators]] can be implemented using Semiconductor Nano-structures to increase the performance like high operation, high stability, high speed response, and highly compact system. Highly compact [[electro-optical modulators]] have been demonstrated in compound semiconductors.&lt;ref&gt;Sadagopan, T., Choi, S. J., Dapkus, P. D. &amp; Bond, A. E. Digest of the LEOS Summer Topical Meetings MC2–-3 (IEEE, Piscataway, New Jersey (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[silicon photonics]], electro-optical modulation has been demonstrated only in large structures, and is therefore inappropriate for effective on-chip
integration. Electro-optical control of light on [[silicon]] is challenging owing to its weak electro-optical properties. The large dimensions of previously demonstrated structures were necessary to achieve a significant modulation of the transmission in spite of the small change of refractive index of silicon. Liu et al. have recently demonstrated a high-speed silicon [[optical modulator]] based on a metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) configuration.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, A. et al. Nature 427, 615–618 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Their work showed a high-speed optical active device on silicon—a critical milestone towards [[optoelectronic]] integration on silicon.

== Electro-optic modulator of nano-structures ==

An electro-optic modulator is a device which can be used for controlling the power, phase or polarization of a laser beam with an electrical control signal. It typically contains one or two [[Pockels cell]]s, and possibly additional optical elements such as polarizers. The principle of operation is based on the linear [[electro-optic effect]] (the [[Pockels effect]], the modification of the [[refractive index]] of a nonlinear crystal by an electric field in proportion to the field strength).

The crystal which is covered by electrode may be considered to be a voltage-variable wave-plate. When a voltage is applied, the retardation of laser polarization of the light would be changed while a beam passes through an ADP crystal. This variation in polarization results in intensity modulation downstream from the output polarizer. The output polarizer converts the phase shift into an [[amplitude modulation]].

Micrometre-scale silicon electro-optic modulator&lt;ref&gt;Nature 435, 325–327 (19 May 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

This device was fabricated a shape of the p-i-n ring resonator on a [[silicon-on-insulator]] substrate with a 3-mm-thick buried oxide layer. Both the waveguide coupling to the ring and that forming the ring have awidth of 450&amp;nbsp;nm and a height of 250&amp;nbsp;nm. The diameter of the ring is 12&amp;nbsp;mm, and the spacing between the ring and the straight waveguide is 200&amp;nbsp;nm.

== Acousto-optic modulator of nano-structures ==

Acousto-optic modulators are used to vary and control laser beam intensity. A Bragg configuration gives a single first order output beam, whose intensity is directly linked to the power of RF control signal. The rise time of the modulator is simply deduced by the necessary time for the acoustic wave to travel through the laser beam. For highest speeds the laser beam will be focused down, forming a beam waist as it passes through the modulator.

In an AOM a laser beam is caused to interact with a high frequency ultrasonic sound wave inside an optically polished block of crystal or glass (the interaction medium). By carefully orientating the laser with respect to the sound waves the beam can be made to reflect off the acoustic wave-fronts ([[Bragg diffraction]]). Therefore, when the sound field is present the beam is deflected and when it is absent the beam passes through undeviated. By switching the sound field on and off very rapidly the deflected beam appears and disappears in response (digital modulation). By varying the amplitude of the acoustic waves the intensity of the deflected beam can similarly be modulated (analogue modulation).

Acoustic [[solitons]] in semiconductor nanostructures&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Physics: Conference Series 92 (PHONONS 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Acoustic [[solitons]] strongly influence the electron states in a semiconductor nanostructure. The amplitude of [[soliton]] pulses is so high that the electron states in a [[quantum well]] make temporal excursions in energy up to 10 meV. The subpicosecond duration of the [[solitons]] is less than the coherence time of the optical transition between the electron states and a frequency modulation of emitted light during the coherence time (chirping effect) is observed. This system is for an ultrafast control of electron states in semiconductor nanostructures.

== Magneto-optic modulator of nano-structures ==

A dc magnetic field Hdc is applied perpendicular to the light propagation direction to produce a single domain, transverse directed 4~Ms. The rf modulation field Hrf, applied by means of a coil along the light propagation direction, wobbles 4~Ms through an angle of @ and produces a time varying magnetization component in the longitudinal direction. This component then produces an ac variation in the plane of polarization via the longitudinal Faraday effect. Conversion to [[amplitude modulation]] is accomplished by the indicated analyzer.

Wideband magneto-optic modulation in a bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet waveguide&lt;ref&gt;Optics Communications Volume 220, Issues 4–6&lt;/ref&gt;

The current transient creates a time-varying magnetic field that has a component along the direction of optical propagation. This component (underneath the microstrip line) acts to tip the magnetization, M, along the propagation direction of the optical beam. A static in-plane magnetic field, by, is applied perpendicular to the light propagation direction, thus ensuring the return of M to its initial orientation after the passage of the current transient. Depending on the component of the magnetization along the z-direction, Mz, the optical beam experiences a rotation of its polarization due to the Faraday effect. The polarization modulation is converted into an intensity modulation via a polarization analyzer, which is detected by a high-speed [[photodiode]].

MODULATION OF THz RADIATION BY SEMICONDUCTOR NANOSTRUCTURES&lt;ref&gt;MICROWAVE AND OPTICAL TECHNOLOGY LETTERS / Vol. 35, No. 5, December 5, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of increased demand for bandwidth, wireless short-range communication systems are expected to extend into the THz frequency range. Therefore, the fundamental interactions between THz radiation and semiconductors are receiving increasing attention. This new quantum structure is based on the well-established technology for producing high electron mobility transistors where an electron gas is confined at a GaAs/AlxGa1 xAs interface. The electron density at the hetero-interface can be controlled by the application of an external gate voltage, which in turn will alter the transmission/reﬂection characteristics of the device to an incident THz beam.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17951">'''SD-WAN''' is an acronym for [[software-defined networking]] in a [[wide area network]] (WAN).  An SD-WAN simplifies the management and operation of a WAN by decoupling (separating) the networking hardware from its control mechanism.  This concept is similar to how software-defined networking implements [[virtualization]] technology to improve [[data center]] management and operation.&lt;ref name=networkworld1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/3031279/internet/sd-wan-what-it-is-and-why-you-ll-use-it-one-day.html|title=SD-WAN: What it is and why you’ll use it one day |publisher=networkworld.com |date=2016-02-10 |accessdate=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key application of an SD-WAN is to allow companies to build higher-performance WANs using lower-cost and commercially available [[Internet access]], enabling businesses to partially or wholly replace more expensive private WAN connection technologies such as [[MPLS]].&lt;ref name=networkworld1/&gt;

American marketing research firm [[Gartner]] predicted in 2015 that by the end of 2019 30% of enterprises will deploy SD-WAN technology in their branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/2015/12/15/predicting-sd-wan-adoption/|title=Predicting SD-WAN Adoption |publisher=gartner.com |date=2015-12-15 |accessdate=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
WANs allow companies to extend their computer networks over large distances, to connect remote branch offices to data centers and each other, and deliver the applications and services required to perform business functions.  When companies extend networks over greater distances and sometimes across multiple carriers' networks, they face operational challenges including [[network congestion]], [[packet delay variation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2223363/cisco-subnet/how-to-address-wan-jitter-issues-for-real-time-applications.html |title=How to address WAN jitter issues for real-time applications |publisher=networkworld.com |date=2012-10-22 |accessdate=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[packet loss]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Whats-slowing-down-your-network-and-how-to-fix-it |title=What’s slowing down your network and how to fix it |publisher=computerweekly.com |date=2015-04-01 |accessdate=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even service outages.  Modern applications such as [[VoIP]] calling, [[videoconferencing]], [[streaming media]], and [[Desktop virtualization#Application virtualization|virtualized applications]] and [[Desktop virtualization|desktops]] require [[low latency]].&lt;ref name=gigaom&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2012/04/06/low-latency-networks-arent-just-for-wall-street-anymore/ |title=Low-latency networks aren’t just for Wall Street anymore |publisher=gigaom.com |date=2012-04-06 |accessdate=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bandwidth requirements are also increasing, especially for applications featuring [[high-definition video]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/fast-internet-connection-for-streaming-hd-movies1.htm |title=How fast should my Internet connection be to watch streaming HD movies? |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |date=2011-10-31 |accessdate=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can be expensive and difficult to expand WAN capability, with corresponding difficulties related to network management and troubleshooting.&lt;ref name=networkworld1/&gt;

SD-WAN products are designed to address these network problems.&lt;ref name=networkcomputing1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkcomputing.com/networking/software-defined-wan-primer/2018665838 |title=Software-Defined WAN: A Primer| publisher=networkcomputing.com |date=2014-09-09 |accessdate=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By enhancing or even replacing traditional branch routers with virtualization appliances that can control application-level policies and offer a network overlay, less expensive consumer-grade Internet links can act more like a dedicated circuit. This simplifies the setup process for branch personnel.&lt;ref name=techtarget&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchsdn.techtarget.com/feature/SD-What-Understanding-SD-WAN |title=SD-What? Understanding SD-WAN |publisher=techtarget.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SD-WAN products can be physical appliances or virtual appliances, and are placed in small remote and branch offices, larger offices, corporate data centers, and increasingly on cloud platforms.&lt;ref name=networkcomputing1/&gt;

A centralized controller is used to set policies and prioritize traffic. The SD-WAN takes into account these policies and the availability of network bandwidth to route traffic. This helps ensure that application performance meets [[service-level agreement|service level agreements]] (SLAs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkcomputing.com/networking/sd-wan-vendors-making-splash/1374423624 |title=SD-WAN Vendors Making A Splash|publisher=networkcomputing.com |date=2015-08-27 |accessdate=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
SD-WAN consists of several technologies combined with newer enhancements. Redundant telecommunication links connecting remote sites date back to the 1970s with [[X.25]] links used for remote mainframe terminal access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2222089/cisco-subnet/a-brief-history-of-the-enterprise-wan.html |title=A Brief History of the Enterprise WAN |publisher=networkworld.com |date=2012-04-06 |accessdate=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Central management of those links with a greater focus on application delivery across the WAN started to become popular in the mid-2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2309455/lan-wan/managing-the-wan.html |title=Managing the WAN |publisher=networkworld.com |date=2006-03-13 |accessdate=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SD-WAN combines the two, and adds the ability to dynamically share network bandwidth across the connection points.&lt;ref name=networkworld1/&gt;  Additional enhancements include central controllers, integrated analytics and on-demand circuit provisioning, with some network intelligence based in the [[cloud computing|cloud]], allowing centralized [[policy-based management|policy management]] and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkcomputing.com/networking/sd-wan-killer-app-enterprise-sdn/1747434541 |title=SD-WAN: The Killer App For Enterprise SDN? |publisher=networkcomputing.com |date=2015-07-22 |accessdate=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Networking publications started using the term SD-WAN to describe this new networking trend as early as 2014.&lt;ref name=networkcomputing1/&gt;

==Required characteristics==
Research firm Gartner has defined an SD-WAN as having four required characteristics:&lt;ref name=networkworld1/&gt;

* The ability to support multiple connection types, such as [[MPLS]], [[frame relay]] and higher speed [[LTE (telecommunications)|LTE wireless]] communications
* The ability to do dynamic path selection, for load sharing and resiliency purposes
* A simple interface that is easy to configure and manage
* The ability to support [[VPN]]s, and third party services such as WAN optimization controllers, firewalls and web gateways

==Form factors==
SD-WAN products can be physical appliances or software based.&lt;ref name=nojitter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nojitter.com/post/240170850/sdwan-bringing-wan-sexy-back |title=SD-WAN: Bringing WAN Sexy Back |publisher=nojitter.com |date=2015-11-02 |accessdate=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Features of SD-WANs include resilience, security and quality of service (QoS), with flexible deployment options and simplified administration and troubleshooting.

===Resilience===
A resilient SD-WAN reduces network downtime. The technology must feature real time detection of outages and automatic switch over to working links.&lt;ref name=techtarget2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchsdn.techtarget.com/tip/Do-wide-area-networks-need-to-get-software-defined |title=Do wide area networks need to get software-defined?|publisher=techtarget.com|date= |accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality of service===
SD-WAN technology supports quality of service by having application level awareness, giving bandwidth priority to the most critical applications.  This may include dynamic path selection, sending an application on a faster link, or even splitting an application between two paths to improve performance by delivering it faster.&lt;ref name=techtarget2/&gt;

===Security===
SD-WAN communication is usually secured using [[IPsec]], a staple of WAN security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchenterprisewan.techtarget.com/tip/How-IPsec-provides-secure-communications/ |title=How IPsec provides secure communications |publisher=techtarget.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application optimization===
SD-WANs can improve application delivery using [[Cache (computing)|caching]], storing recently accessed information in memory to speed future access.&lt;ref name=packetpushers&gt;{{cite web|url=https://packetpushers.net/virtual-toolbox/list-sd-wan-vendors/ |title=List of SD-WAN Vendors |publisher=packetpushers.net |date= |accessdate=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unclear|date=October 2018}}

===Deployment options===
Most SD-WAN products are available as pre-configured appliances, placed at the network edge in data centers, branch offices and other remote locations.  There are also virtual appliances that can work on existing network hardware, or the appliance can be deployed as a virtual appliance on the cloud in environments such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). This allows enterprises to benefit from SD-WAN services as they migrate application delivery from corporate servers to cloud based services such as [[Salesforce.com]] and [[Google]] apps.&lt;ref name=nojitter/&gt;

===Administration and troubleshooting===
Management simplicity is a key requirement for SD-WANs, per Gartner.  As with network equipment in general, [[GUI]]s may be preferred to [[command line interface]] (CLI) methods of configuration and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.differencebtw.com/difference-between-gui-and-command-line/ |title=Difference Between GUI and Command Line |publisher=differencebtw.com |date=2015-05-29 |accessdate=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other beneficial administrative features include automatic path selection, the ability to centrally configure each end appliance by pushing configuration changes out, and even a true software defined networking approach that lets all appliances and virtual appliances be configured centrally based on application needs rather than underlying hardware.&lt;ref name=networkworld1/&gt;

===Online traffic engineering===
With a global view of network status, a controller that manages SD-WAN can perform careful and adaptive traffic engineering by assigning new transfer requests according to current usage of resources (links). For example, this can be achieved by performing central calculation of transmission rates at the controller and rate-limiting at the senders (end-points) according to such rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Achieving High Utilization with Software-Driven WAN |author= C.

==Complementary technology==
===SD-WAN versus WAN Optimization===
There are some similarities between SD-WAN and [[WAN optimization]], the name given to the collection of techniques used to increase data-transfer efficiencies across WANs.  The goal of each is to accelerate application delivery between branch offices and data centers, but SD-WAN technology focuses additionally on cost savings and efficiency, specifically by allowing lower cost network links to perform the work of more expensive leased lines, whereas WAN Optimization focuses squarely on improving packet delivery.  An SD-WAN utilizing virtualization techniques assisted with WAN Optimization traffic control allows network bandwidth to dynamically grow or shrink as needed.  SD-WAN technology and WAN optimization can be used separately or together,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/feature/Why-the-next-breed-of-WAN-optimization-is-SD-WAN |title=Why SD-WAN is the next breed of WAN optimization |publisher=techtarget.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some SD-WAN vendors are adding WAN optimization features to their products.&lt;ref name=packetpushers/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://packetpushers.net/citrix-combines-sd-wan-wan-optimization-single-appliance/ |title=Citrix Combines SD-WAN, WAN Optimization In Single Appliance |publisher=packetpushers.com |date=2016-03-16|accessdate=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WAN edge routers===
A WAN [[edge device|edge]] [[router (computing)|router]] is a device that routes data packets between different WAN locations, giving an enterprise access to a carrier network.  Also called a boundary router, it is unlike a core router, which only sends packets within a single network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/edge-router |title=Definition: edge router  |publisher=techtarget.com |date=|accessdate=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SD-WANs can work as an overlay to simplify the management of existing WAN edge routers, by lowering dependence on routing protocols.&lt;ref name=networkcomputing1/&gt;  SD-WAN can also potentially be an alternative to WAN Edge routers.&lt;ref name=techtarget/&gt;

===SD-WAN versus hybrid WAN===

SD-WANs are similar to hybrid WANs, and sometimes the terms are used interchangeably, but they are not identical.  A hybrid WAN consists of different connection types, and may have a software defined network (SDN) component, but doesn't have to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/hybrid-WAN |title=Definition hybrid WAN |publisher=techtarget.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing &amp; validation==

As there is no standard algorithm for SD-WAN controllers, device manufacturers each use their own proprietary algorithm in the transmission of data. These algorithms determine which traffic to direct over which link and when to switch traffic from one link to another. Given the breadth of options available in relation to both software and hardware SD-WAN control solutions, it's imperative they be tested and validated under real-world conditions within a lab setting prior to deployment.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

There are multiple solutions available for testing purposes, ranging from purpose-built [[Network emulation|network emulation]] appliances which can apply specified network impairments to the network being tested in order to reliably validate performance, to software-based solutions.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

==Marketplace==
IT website [[Network World]] divides the SD-WAN vendor market into three groups: established networking vendors who are adding SD-WAN products to their offerings, WAN specialists who are starting to integrate SD-WAN functionality into their products, and startups focused specifically on the SD-WAN market.&lt;ref name=networkworld1/&gt;

Alternatively, a market overview by [[Nemertes Research]] groups SD-WAN vendors into categories based on their original technology space, and which are "Pure-play SD-WAN providers", "WAN optimization vendors", "Link-aggregation vendors", and "General network vendors"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://searchsdn.techtarget.com/tip/SD-WAN-providers-Consider-the-small-with-the-big|title=SD-WAN providers: Consider the small with the big|work=SearchSDN|access-date=2017-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Network World's second category (startups focused specifically on the SD-WAN market), is generally equivalent to Nemertes' "Pure-play SD-WAN providers" category, Nemertes offers a more detailed view of the preexisting WAN and overall networking providers. 

Additionally, Nemertes Research also describes the in-net side of the SD-WAN market, describing the [[Go to market|go-to-market]] strategy of connectivity providers entering the SD-WAN market. These providers include "Network-as-a-service vendors", "Carriers or telcos", "Content delivery networks" and "Secure WAN providers".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Several online resources, including the networking technology podcast "Packet Pushers", keep an updated list of existing SD-WAN vendors&lt;ref name="packetpushers" /&gt;. In June 2018, [[Network World]] named 10 hot SD-WAN startups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.networkworld.com/article/3284367/sd-wan/10-hot-sd-wan-startups-to-watch.html|title=10 hot SD-WAN startups to watch|last=Vance|first=Jeff|work=Network World|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saladero''' is a basic industry that produces [[Salting (food)|salted meat]] such as [[charqui]]. It was one of the earliest industries of [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]] after the [[Argentine War of Independence]], benefiting from the availability of cattle in the [[Humid Pampas]] and the low technology and manpower requirements. Most of the production was sold to Cuba and Brazil to feed slaves. In time, it expanded into other areas, such as extracting the leather, horns and fat from cows (fat was useful for public lighting, soaps and candles). Saladero declined at the end of the 19th century, with the lowering numbers of foreign slaves (and thus the smaller demand for food for them) and the expansion of [[refrigeration]] techniques.

[[Image:Terminal_Blocks_01CJC.png|thumb|upright|Screw terminals, as individual connectors to a board at left, as a barrier strip with setscrews at top, and as a barrier strip with attached spade and loop lugs at bottom.]]

A '''screw terminal''' is a type of [[electrical connector]] where a [[wire]] is held by the tightening of a [[screw]]. 

== Description ==
The wire may be wrapped directly under the head of a screw, may be held by a metal plate forced against the wire by a screw, or may be held by what is, in effect, a [[set screw]] in the side of a metal tube. The wire may be directly stripped of insulation and inserted under the head of a screw or into the terminal. Otherwise, it may be either inserted first into a [[ferrule]], which is then inserted into the terminal, or else attached to a connecting lug. which is then fixed under the screw head. 

Depending on the design, a flat-blade [[screwdriver]], a cross-blade screwdriver, [[hex key]], [[Torx]] key, or other tool may be required to properly tighten the connection for reliable operation.

== Applications ==
Screw terminals are used extensively in [[building wiring]] for the distribution of [[electricity]] - connecting [[electrical outlet]]s, [[Light fixture|luminaires]] and [[switch]]es to the [[Mains electricity|mains]], and for directly connecting [[major appliance]]s such as [[clothes dryer]]s and [[oven]]s drawing in excess of 15 amperes.  

Screw terminals are commonly used to connect a [[chassis ground]], such as on a [[record player]] or [[surge protector]].  Most [[public address]] systems in buildings also use them for [[Loudspeaker|speakers]], and sometimes for other outputs and inputs. [[Alarm system]]s and building sensor and control systems have traditionally used large numbers of screw terminations.

Grounding screws are often [[color code|color-coded]] green and, when used on [[consumer electronics]], often have a [[washer (hardware)|washer]] with gripping "teeth".  

Printed circuit board (PCB) terminal blocks are specially designed with a copper alloy pin of suitable size and length and can be inserted in printed circuit boards to be soldered to allow electrical signals and current to flow to and from PCBs and electrical equipment. Some designs provide features that allow the flow of molten solder to endure a better connection between the circuit traces of the board and the electrical equipment which is meant to be controlled or fed appropriate power.  

== Multiway versions ==
[[Image:Leuchterklemme_75dpi.jpg|thumb|Two paired screw terminals, typically used for connecting ceiling-mounted [[light fixture]]s]]
Multiple screw terminals can be arranged in the form of a '''barrier strip''' (as illustrated at the top right), with a number of short metal strips separated by a raised insulated "barrier" on an insulating "block" - each strip having a pair of screws with each screw connecting to a separate conductor, one at each end of the strip. These are known as connector strips or chocolate blocks ("choc blocks") in the UK. This nick-name arises from the first such connectors made in the UK by GEC, Witton in the 1950s. Moulded in brown plastic they were said to resemble a small bar of chocolate.

A similar arrangement is common with paired screw terminals, where metal tubes are loosely encased in an insulating block with a [[set screw]] at each end of each tube to hold and thus connect a conductor.  These are often used to connect [[light fixture]]s and are shown at the right.  

Alternatively, terminals can also be arranged as a '''terminal strip''' or '''terminal block''', with several screws along (typically) two long strips.  This creates a [[bus bar]] for [[power distribution]], and so may also include a master input connector, usually [[binding post]]s or [[banana connector]]s.

== Installation ==
Assembly of a screw connection requires some care in workmanship to ensure proper removal of insulation, containment of all wire strands, and the adequate tightening of the screw. If the wire diameter is small in relation to the size of the screw, the wire may be cut through by the over-tightening of the screw.  This is less likely to occur when a wire is clamped between two plates by the action of a screw.  Since wire strands may not be contained by the screw head in a basic screw terminal, stranded wires may be crimped into a [[Electric wire ferrule|ferrule]] to prevent the bridging of terminals; this partly offsets the economy of a "bare" wire termination.

While wires may be crimped, they should not be heavily tinned with [[solder]] prior to installation in a screw terminal, since the soft metal will [[creep (deformation)|cold flow]], resulting in a loose connection and possible fire hazard. Screw connectors sometimes come loose if not done up tightly enough at fitting time. Verifying adequate tightening torque requires calibrated installation tools and proper training. In the UK, all screw connectors on fixed mains installations are required to be accessible for servicing, for this reason.

== Advantages and disadvantages==
[[Image:Screw Terminals. Basic and Compression Types..jpg|thumb|left|Two types of screw terminals showing a significant development in design. Basic, with the wires held between the screw heads and the terminals (left) and with the wires held, reversely, between the metal clamping plates and the rear of the terminals (right).]]
Screw terminals are low in cost when compared to other types of connectors, and can be readily designed into products for circuits carrying currents of from a fraction of an ampere up to several hundred amperes at low to moderate frequencies. The terminals easily can be re-used in the field, allowing for the replacement of wires or equipment, generally with standard hand tools.  Screw terminals usually avoid the requirement for a specialized mating connector to be applied to the ends of wires.

When properly tightened, the connections are physically and electrically secure because they firmly contact a large section of wire. The terminals are relatively low cost compared with other types of connector, and a screw terminal can easily be integrated into the design of a building wiring device (such as a socket, switch, or lamp holder).  

Disadvantages include the time taken to strip a wire and, in basic terminals, properly wrap it around a screw head, since it is essential that any wire installed under a screw head be "wound" in the correct direction (usually clockwise,) so that the conductors are not forced outwards when the screw is tightened.  This procedure is more time consuming than using a plug-in connector - thus making screw connections uncommon for portable equipment, where wires are repeatedly connected and disconnected.

However, with the clamping plate type of screw terminal this time is reduced, since it is necessary only to insert the stripped wire between the terminal and the rear clamping plate then tighten the connection, using the screw to clamp the wire between the terminal and the clamping plate, without any need properly to wrap it around the screw head.

The screw mechanism limits the minimum physical size of a terminal, making screw terminals less useful where very many connections are required.


It is difficult to automate multiple terminations with screw connections. 

[[Vibration]] or [[corrosion]] can cause a screw connection to deteriorate over time.
{{-}}

The use of screw terminal "chocolate blocks" in building wiring installations has sharply declined in favour of crimp, push and twist type connectors which are not prone to working loose and easier to fit. In the UK chocolate blocks are no longer approved for connections that are not accessible for inspection (ie. under floors).

[[File:solar cell.png|thumb|A conventional [[crystalline silicon]] solar cell (as of 2005). Electrical contacts made from [[busbar]]s (the larger silver-colored strips) and fingers (the smaller ones) are printed on the carbon [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]].]]
[[File:Photovoltaic cell.svg|thumb|Symbol of a Photovoltaic cell.]]
A '''solar cell''', or '''photovoltaic cell''', is an electrical device that converts the energy of [[light]] directly into [[electricity]] by the [[photovoltaic effect]], which is a [[physics|physical]] and [[Chemical substance|chemical]] phenomenon.&lt;ref name="chemistryexplained.com"&gt;[http://www.chemistryexplained.com/Ru-Sp/Solar-Cells.html Solar Cells]. chemistryexplained.com&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of photoelectric cell, defined as a device whose electrical characteristics, such as [[Electric current|current]], [[voltage]], or [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]], vary when exposed to light. Individual solar cell devices can be combined to form modules, otherwise known as [[solar panel]]s.  In basic terms a single junction silicon solar cell can produce a maximum open-circuit voltage of approximately 0.5 to 0.6 volts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solarbotics.net/starting/200202_solar_cells/200202_solar_cell_use.html|title=Solar cells -- performance and use|website=solarbotics.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar cells are described as being [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]], irrespective of whether the source is [[sunlight]] or an artificial light. They are used as a [[photodetector]] (for example [[infrared detector]]s), detecting light or other [[electromagnetic radiation]] near the visible range, or measuring light intensity.

The operation of a photovoltaic (PV) cell requires three basic attributes:
* The absorption of light, generating either [[electron]]-[[Electron hole|hole]] pairs or [[exciton]]s.
* The separation of [[charge carrier]]s of opposite types.
* The separate extraction of those carriers to an external circuit.

In contrast, a [[solar thermal collector]] supplies [[heat]] by [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbing sunlight]], for the purpose of either direct heating or indirect [[electrical power generation]] from heat. A "photoelectrolytic cell" ([[photoelectrochemical cell]]), on the other hand, refers either to a type of photovoltaic cell (like that developed by [[Edmond Becquerel]] and modern [[dye-sensitized solar cell]]s), or to a device that [[Water splitting|splits water]] directly into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] using only solar illumination.
{{TOC_limit|3}}

== Applications ==
[[File:From a solar cell to a PV system.svg|thumb|From a solar cell to a PV system. Diagram of the possible components of a [[photovoltaic system]]]]

Assemblies of solar cells are used to make [[Solar panel|solar modules]] that generate electrical power from [[sunlight]], as distinguished from a "solar thermal module" or "solar hot water panel". A solar array generates [[solar power]] using [[solar energy]].

=== Cells, modules, panels and systems ===
{{Main|Photovoltaic system}}
Multiple solar cells in an integrated group, all oriented in one plane, constitute a [[Solar panel|solar photovoltaic panel or module]]. Photovoltaic modules often have a sheet of glass on the sun-facing side, allowing light to pass while protecting the semiconductor [[Wafer (electronics)|wafers]]. Solar cells are usually connected in [[series and parallel circuits]] or series in modules, creating an additive voltage. Connecting cells in parallel yields a higher current; however, problems such as shadow effects can shut down the weaker (less illuminated) parallel string (a number of series connected cells) causing substantial power loss and possible damage because of the reverse bias applied to the shadowed cells by their illuminated partners. Strings of series cells are usually handled independently and not connected in parallel, though as of 2014, individual [[Electric power conversion|power boxes]] are often supplied for each module, and are connected in parallel. Although modules can be interconnected to create an array with the desired peak DC voltage and loading current capacity, using independent MPPTs ([[Maximum power point tracking|maximum power point trackers]]) is preferable. Otherwise, shunt [[diode]]s can reduce shadowing power loss in arrays with series/parallel connected cells.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

== History ==
{{Main|Timeline of solar cells}}
The [[photovoltaic effect]] was experimentally demonstrated first by French physicist [[Edmond Becquerel]]. In 1839, at age 19, he built the world's first photovoltaic cell in his father's laboratory. [[Willoughby Smith]] first described the "Effect of Light on Selenium during the passage of an Electric Current" in a 20 February 1873 issue of [[Nature (magazine)|Nature]]. In 1883 [[Charles Fritts]] built the first [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] photovoltaic cell by coating the [[semiconductor]] [[selenium]] with a thin layer of [[gold]] to form the junctions; the device was only around 1% efficient.

In 1888 Russian physicist [[Aleksandr Stoletov]] built the first cell based on the outer [[photoelectric effect]] discovered by [[Heinrich Hertz]] in 1887.&lt;ref name="Gevorkian2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gevorkian |first=Peter |title=Sustainable energy systems engineering: the complete green building design resource|url={{google books|id=i8rcHsOfPScC|p=498|plainurl=y}}|year=2007|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-147359-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 [[Albert Einstein]] proposed a new quantum theory of light and explained the [[photoelectric effect]] in a landmark paper, for which he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/ "The Nobel Prize in Physics 1921: Albert Einstein"], Nobel Prize official page&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vadim Lashkaryov]] discovered ''p''-''n''-junctions in Cu&lt;math&gt;_2&lt;/math&gt;O and silver sulphide protocells in 1941.&lt;cite&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lashkaryov, V. E. (1941) [http://ujp.bitp.kiev.ua/files/journals/53/si/53SI11p.pdf Investigation of a barrier layer by the thermoprobe method] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928014344/http://ujp.bitp.kiev.ua/files/journals/53/si/53SI11p.pdf |date=28 September 2015 }}, Izv. Akad. Nauk SSSR, Ser. Fiz. '''5''', 442–446, English translation: Ukr. J. Phys. '''53''', 53–56 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;

[[Russell Ohl]] patented the modern junction semiconductor solar cell in 1946&lt;ref&gt;"Light sensitive device" {{US patent|2402662}} Issue date: June 1946&lt;/ref&gt; while working on the series of advances that would lead to the [[transistor]].

The first practical photovoltaic cell was publicly demonstrated on 25 April 1954 at [[Bell Laboratories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=April 25, 1954: Bell Labs Demonstrates the First Practical Silicon Solar Cell |work=APS News |volume=18 |issue=4 |date=April 2009 |publisher=American Physical Society |url=http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200904/physicshistory.cfm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The inventors were [[Calvin Souther Fuller]], [[Daryl Chapin]] and [[Gerald Pearson]].&lt;ref name="Tsokos2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=K. A. |last=Tsokos|title=Physics for the IB Diploma Full Colour|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=uWVQrIZqz_MC}}|date=28 January 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-13821-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar cells gained prominence with their incorporation onto the 1958 [[Vanguard I]] satellite.

=== Space applications ===
Solar cells were first used in a prominent application when they were proposed and flown on the Vanguard satellite in 1958, as an alternative power source to the [[primary cell|primary battery]] power source. By adding cells to the outside of the body, the mission time could be extended with no major changes to the spacecraft or its power systems. In 1959 the United States launched [[Explorer 6]], featuring large wing-shaped solar arrays, which became a common feature in satellites. These arrays consisted of 9600 [[H. Leslie (Les) Hoffman|Hoffman solar cells]].

By the 1960s, solar cells were (and still are) the main power source for most Earth orbiting satellites and a number of probes into the solar system, since they offered the best [[power-to-weight ratio]]. However, this success was possible because in the space application, power system costs could be high, because space users had few other power options, and were willing to pay for the best possible cells. The space power market drove the development of higher efficiencies in solar cells up until the [[National Science Foundation]] "Research Applied to National Needs" program began to push development of solar cells for terrestrial applications.

In the early 1990s the technology used for space solar cells diverged from the silicon technology used for terrestrial panels, with the spacecraft application shifting to [[gallium arsenide]]-based III-V semiconductor materials, which then evolved into the modern III-V [[multijunction photovoltaic cell]] used on spacecraft.

=== Price reductions ===
Improvements were gradual over the 1960s. This was also the reason that costs remained high, because space users were willing to pay for the best possible cells, leaving no reason to invest in lower-cost, less-efficient solutions. The price was determined largely by the semiconductor industry; their move to [[integrated circuit]]s in the 1960s led to the availability of larger [[Boule (crystal)|boules]] at lower relative prices. As their price fell, the price of the resulting cells did as well. These effects lowered 1971 cell costs to some $100 per watt.{{sfn|Perlin|1999|p= 50}}

In late 1969 Elliot Berman joined [[Exxon]]'s task force which was looking for projects 30 years in the future and in April 1973 he founded Solar Power Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon at that time.{{sfn|Perlin|1999|p=53}}&lt;ref name="williams 2005"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The group had concluded that electrical power would be much more expensive by 2000, and felt that this increase in price would make alternative energy sources more attractive. He conducted a market study and concluded that a [[price per watt]] of about $20/watt would create significant demand.{{sfn|Perlin|1999|p=53}} The team eliminated the steps of polishing the wafers and coating them with an anti-reflective layer, relying on the rough-sawn wafer surface. The team also replaced the expensive materials and hand wiring used in space applications with a [[printed circuit board]] on the back, [[acrylate polymer|acrylic]] plastic on the front, and [[silicone]] glue between the two, "potting" the cells.{{sfn|Perlin|1999|p=54}} Solar cells could be made using cast-off material from the electronics market. By 1973 they announced a product, and SPC convinced [[Tideland Signal]] to use its panels to power navigational [[buoy]]s, initially for the U.S. Coast Guard.&lt;ref name="williams 2005" /&gt;

=== Research and industrial production ===
Research into solar power for terrestrial applications became prominent with the U.S. National Science Foundation's Advanced Solar Energy Research and Development Division within the "Research Applied to National Needs" program, which ran from 1969 to 1977,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/about/history/nsf50/nsf8816.jsp The National Science Foundation: A Brief History], Chapter IV, NSF 88-16, 15 July 1994 (retrieved 20 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; and funded research on developing solar power for ground electrical power systems. A 1973 conference, the "Cherry Hill Conference", set forth the technology goals required to achieve this goal and outlined an ambitious project for achieving them, kicking off an applied research program that would be ongoing for several decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Herwig, Lloyd O.|title=AIP Conference Proceedings|journal=National center for photovoltaics (NCPV) 15th program review meeting. AIP Conference Proceedings |volume=462 |page=785 |doi=10.1063/1.58015 |bibcode=1999AIPC..462..785H |chapter=Cherry Hill revisited: Background events and photovoltaic technology status|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was eventually taken over by the [[Energy Research and Development Administration]] (ERDA),&lt;ref&gt;Deyo, J. N., Brandhorst, H. W., Jr., and Forestieri, A. F., [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19770006594 Status of the ERDA/NASA photovoltaic tests and applications project], 12th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conf., 15–18 Nov. 1976&lt;/ref&gt; which was later merged into the [[U.S. Department of Energy]].

Following the [[1973 oil crisis]], oil companies used their higher profits to start (or buy) solar firms, and were for decades the largest producers. Exxon, ARCO, Shell, Amoco (later purchased by BP) and Mobil all had major solar divisions during the 1970s and 1980s. Technology companies also participated, including General Electric, Motorola, IBM, Tyco and RCA.&lt;ref name="Information1979"&gt;{{cite book |author=Reed Business Information|title=The multinational connections-who does what where|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=x3w5ZfGUS_0C}}|date=18 October 1979 |publisher=Reed Business Information|issn=0262-4079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adjusting for inflation, it cost $96 per watt for a solar module in the mid-1970s. Process improvements and a very large boost in production have brought that figure down 99%, to 68¢ per watt in 2016, according to data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance.&lt;ref&gt;Buhayar, Noah (28 January 2016) [https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-solar-power-buffett-vs-musk/ Warren Buffett controls Nevada’s legacy utility. Elon Musk is behind the solar company that’s upending the market. Let the fun begin.] ''Bloomberg Businessweek''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Swanson's law]] is an observation similar to [[Moore's Law]] that states that solar cell prices fall 20% for every doubling of industry capacity. It was featured in an article in the British weekly newspaper [[The Economist]] in late 2012.&lt;ref name="Econ1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/21566414-alternative-energy-will-no-longer-be-alternative-sunny-uplands| title =Sunny Uplands: Alternative energy will no longer be alternative| publisher=The Economist| accessdate = 28 December 2012| date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further improvements reduced production cost to under $1 per watt, with wholesale costs well under $2. [[Balance of system]] costs were then higher than those of the panels. Large commercial arrays could be built, as of 2010, at below $3.40 a watt, fully commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;$1/W Photovoltaic Systems DOE whitepaper August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="247wallst.com"&gt;[http://247wallst.com/2011/10/06/solar-stocks-does-the-punishment-fit-the-crime-fslr-spwra-stp-jaso-tsl-ldk-tan/ Solar Stocks: Does the Punishment Fit the Crime?]. 24/7 Wall St. (6 October 2011). Retrieved 3 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the semiconductor industry moved to ever-larger [[Boule (crystal)|boules]], older equipment became inexpensive. Cell sizes grew as equipment became available on the surplus market; [[ARCO]] Solar's original panels used cells {{convert|2|to|4|in|mm|-1}} in diameter. Panels in the 1990s and early 2000s generally used 125&amp;nbsp;mm wafers; since 2008, almost all new panels use 156&amp;nbsp;mm cells. The widespread introduction of [[flat screen television]]s in the late 1990s and early 2000s led to the wide availability of large, high-quality glass sheets to cover the panels.

During the 1990s, [[polysilicon]] ("poly") cells became increasingly popular. These cells offer less efficiency than their monosilicon ("mono") counterparts, but they are grown in large vats that reduce cost. By the mid-2000s, poly was dominant in the low-cost panel market, but more recently the mono returned to widespread use.

Manufacturers of wafer-based cells responded to high silicon prices in 2004–2008 with rapid reductions in silicon consumption. In 2008, according to Jef Poortmans, director of [[IMEC]]'s organic and solar department, current cells use {{convert|8|-|9|g|oz}} of silicon per watt of power generation, with wafer thicknesses in the neighborhood of 200&amp;nbsp;[[microns]].  [[Crystalline silicon]] panels dominate worldwide markets and are mostly manufactured in China and Taiwan. By late 2011, a drop in European demand dropped prices for crystalline solar modules to about $1.09&lt;ref name="247wallst.com"/&gt; per watt down sharply from 2010. Prices continued to fall in 2012, reaching $0.62/watt by 4Q2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Parkinson|first=Giles |title=Plunging Cost Of Solar PV (Graphs) |url=http://cleantechnica.com/2013/03/07/plunging-cost-of-solar-pv-graphs/ |publisher=Clean Technica |accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsidies and grid parity===

Solar-specific [[feed-in tariff]]s vary by country and within countries. Such tariffs encourage the development of solar power projects.
Widespread [[grid parity]], the point at which photovoltaic electricity is equal to or cheaper than [[Mains electricity|grid power]] without subsidies, likely requires advances on all three fronts. Proponents of solar hope to achieve grid parity first in areas with abundant sun and high electricity costs such as in [[California]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bp.com/genericarticle.do?categoryId=9013609&amp;contentId=7005395 |title=BP Global&amp;nbsp;– Reports and publications&amp;nbsp;– Going for grid parity |accessdate=2012-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608081013/http://www.bp.com/genericarticle.do?categoryId=9013609&amp;contentId=7005395 |archivedate=8 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}.

The price of solar panels fell steadily for 40 years, interrupted in 2004 when high subsidies in Germany drastically increased demand there and greatly increased the price of purified silicon (which is used in computer chips as well as solar panels). The [[2008–2012 global recession|recession of 2008]] and the onset of Chinese manufacturing caused prices to resume their decline. In the four years after January 2008 prices for solar modules in Germany dropped from €3 to €1 per peak watt. During that same time production capacity surged with an annual growth of more than 50%. China increased market share from 8% in 2008 to over 55% in the last quarter of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Sam (20 April 2011) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130512121859/http://energy.colostate.edu/docs/BaldwinTalkColoradoStateUniversity2011-04-20final.pdf Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy: Challenges and Opportunities].

[[File:Silicon Solar cell structure and mechanism.svg|thumb|220px|Working [[Theory of solar cells|mechanism]] of a solar cell]]
{{Main|Theory of solar cells}}
The solar cell works in several steps:
* [[Photon]]s in [[sunlight]] hit the solar panel and are absorbed by [[List of semiconductor materials|semiconducting materials]], such as [[silicon]].
* [[Electrons]] are [[Excited state|excited]] from their current [[Molecular orbital|molecular]]/[[Atomic orbital|atomic orbita]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l. Once excited an electron can either dissipate the energy as heat and [[Relaxation (physics)|return to its orbital]] or travel through the cell until it reaches an electrode. Current flows through the material to cancel the potential and this electricity is captured. The [[chemical bonds]] of the material are vital for this process to work, and usually [[silicon]] is used in two layers, one layer being [[doped]] with [[boron]], the other [[phosphorus]]. These layers have different chemical electric charges and subsequently both drive and direct the current of electrons.&lt;ref name="chemistryexplained.com"/&gt;
* An array of solar cells converts solar energy into a usable amount of [[direct current]] (DC) electricity.
* An [[inverter]] can convert the power to [[alternating current]] (AC).

The most commonly known solar cell is configured as a large-area [[p–n junction]] made from silicon. Other possible solar cell types are organic solar cells, dye sensitized solar cells, perovskite solar cells, quantum dot solar cells etc. The illuminated side of a solar cell generally has a [[transparent conducting film]] for allowing light to enter into active material and to collect the generated charge carriers. Typically, films with high transmittance and high electrical conductance such as [[indium tin oxide]], conducting polymers or conducting nanowire networks are used for the purpose.&lt;ref name=kumar2017&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Ankush|date=2017-01-03|title=Predicting efficiency of solar cells based on transparent conducting electrodes|url=http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4973117|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=121|issue=1|pages=014502|doi=10.1063/1.4973117|issn=0021-8979|bibcode=2017JAP...121a4502K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiconductors with [[band gap]] between 1 and 1.5[[Electronvolt|eV]], or near-infrared light, have the greatest potential to form an efficient single-junction cell.

{{Main|Solar cell efficiency}}
Solar cell efficiency may be broken down into reflectance efficiency, thermodynamic efficiency, charge carrier separation efficiency and conductive efficiency. The overall efficiency is the product of these individual metrics.

The [[Energy conversion efficiency|power conversion efficiency]] of a solar cell is a parameter which is defined by the fraction of incident power converted into electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pveducation.org/pvcdrom/solar-cell-efficiency|title=Solar Cell Efficiency {{!}} PVEducation|website=www.pveducation.org|access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A solar cell has a voltage dependent efficiency curve, temperature coefficients, and allowable shadow angles.

Due to the difficulty in measuring these parameters directly, other parameters are substituted: thermodynamic efficiency, [[Quantum efficiency of a solar cell|quantum efficiency]], [[Quantum efficiency|integrated quantum efficiency]], [[Open-circuit voltage|V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;]] ratio, and fill factor. Reflectance losses are a portion of quantum efficiency under "[[Quantum efficiency#Types of quantum efficiency|external quantum efficiency]]". Recombination losses make up another portion of quantum efficiency, V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; ratio, and fill factor. Resistive losses are predominantly categorized under fill factor, but also make up minor portions of quantum efficiency, V&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; ratio.

The [[Solar cell efficiency#Fill factor|fill factor]] is the ratio of the actual maximum obtainable [[power (physics)|power]] to the product of the [[open circuit voltage]] and [[short circuit current]]. This is a key parameter in evaluating performance. In 2009, typical commercial solar cells had a fill factor &gt; 0.70. Grade B cells were usually between 0.4 and 0.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=T.Bazouni: What is the Fill Factor of a Solar Panel| url=http://www.solarfreaks.com/what-is-the-fill-factor-of-a-solar-panel-t138.html| accessdate=17 February 2009| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415162123/http://www.solarfreaks.com/what-is-the-fill-factor-of-a-solar-panel-t138.html| archivedate=15 April 2009| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cells with a high fill factor have a low [[equivalent series resistance]] and a high [[Shunt (electrical)|equivalent shunt resistance]], so less of the current produced by the cell is dissipated in internal losses.

In 2014, three companies broke the record of 25.6% for a silicon solar cell. Panasonic's was the most efficient. The company moved the front contacts to the rear of the panel, eliminating shaded areas. In addition they applied thin silicon films to the (high quality silicon) wafer's front and back to eliminate defects at or near the wafer surface.&lt;ref&gt;Bullis, Kevin (13 June 2014) [http://www.technologyreview.com/news/528351/record-breaking-solar-cell-points-the-way-to-cheaper-power Record-Breaking Solar Cell Points the Way to Cheaper Power].

In 2015, a 4-junction GaInP/GaAs//GaInAsP/GaInAs solar cell achieved a new laboratory record efficiency of 46.1 percent (concentration ratio of sunlight = 312) in a French-German collaboration between the [[Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE|Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE)]], CEA-LETI and SOITEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimroth|first=Frank|last2=Tibbits|first2=Thomas N.D.|last3=Niemeyer|first3=Markus|last4=Predan|first4=Felix|last5=Beutel|first5=Paul|last6=Karcher|first6=Christian|last7=Oliva|first7=Eduard|last8=Siefer|first8=Gerald|last9=Lackner et al.|first9=David|year=2016|title=Four-Junction Wafer Bonded Concentrator Solar Cells|journal=IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics|volume=6|issue=1|pages=343–349|doi=10.1109/jphotov.2015.2501729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Global Market Share by PV Technology from 1990 to 2013.svg|thumb|260px|Global market-share in terms of annual production by PV technology since 1990]]

Solar cells are typically named after the [[semiconducting material]] they are made of. These [[List of semiconductor materials|materials]] must have certain characteristics in order to absorb [[sunlight]]. Some cells are designed to handle sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, while others are optimized for [[Solar panels on spacecraft|use in space]]. Solar cells can be made of only one single layer of light-absorbing material ([[p-n junction|single-junction]]) or use multiple physical configurations ([[multi-junction]]s) to take advantage of various absorption and charge separation mechanisms.

Solar cells can be classified into first, second and third generation cells. The first generation cells—also called conventional, traditional or [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]-based cells—are made of [[crystalline silicon]], the commercially predominant PV technology, that includes materials such as [[polysilicon]] and [[monocrystalline silicon]]. Second generation cells are [[thin film solar cells]], that include [[amorphous silicon]], [[Cadmium telluride photovoltaics|CdTe]] and [[Copper indium gallium selenide solar cell|CIGS]] cells and are commercially significant in utility-scale [[photovoltaic power station]]s, [[building integrated photovoltaics]] or in small [[stand-alone power system]]. The [[third-generation photovoltaic cell|third generation of solar cells]] includes a number of thin-film technologies often described as emerging photovoltaics—most of them have not yet been commercially applied and are still in the research or development phase. Many use organic materials, often [[organometallic]] compounds as well as inorganic substances. Despite the fact that their efficiencies had been low and the stability of the absorber material was often too short for commercial applications, there is a lot of research invested into these technologies as they promise to achieve the goal of producing low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.

=== Crystalline silicon ===
{{Main|Crystalline silicon}}
By far, the most prevalent bulk material for solar cells is [[crystalline silicon]] (c-Si), also known as "solar grade silicon".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Bulk silicon is separated into multiple categories according to crystallinity and crystal size in the resulting [[ingot]], [[ribbon]] or [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]. These cells are entirely based around the concept of a [[p-n junction]].
Solar cells made of c-Si are made from [[wafer (electronics)|wafers]] between 160 and 240&amp;nbsp;micrometers thick.

==== Monocrystalline silicon ====
{{Main|Monocrystalline silicon}}
[[Image:Sono Sion 2017-08-18 1213.JPG|thumb|The roof, bonnet and large parts of the outer shell of the [[Sion (electric car)|Sion]] are equipped with highly efficient monocrystalline silicon cells]]

[[Monocrystalline silicon]] (mono-Si) solar cells are more efficient and more expensive than most other types of cells. The corners of the cells look clipped, like an octagon, because the wafer material is cut from cylindrical ingots, that are typically grown by the [[Czochralski process]]. Solar panels using mono-Si cells display a distinctive pattern of small white diamonds.

====Epitaxial silicon development====
[[Epitaxial wafer]]s of crystalline silicon can be grown on a monocrystalline silicon "seed" wafer by [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD), and then detached as self-supporting wafers of some standard thickness (e.g., 250&amp;nbsp;µm) that can be manipulated by hand, and directly substituted for wafer cells cut from monocrystalline silicon ingots. Solar cells made with this "[[Saw#Terminology|kerf]]less" technique can have efficiencies approaching those of wafer-cut cells, but at appreciably lower cost if the CVD can be done at [[atmospheric pressure]] in a high-throughput inline process.&lt;ref name=NexWafe/&gt;&lt;ref name="DrießenAmiri2016"/&gt; The surface of epitaxial wafers may be textured to enhance light absorption.&lt;ref name=pyramid&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b01240 | pmid=27525513 | title=Ultrathin Epitaxial Silicon Solar Cells with Inverted Nanopyramid Arrays for Efficient Light Trapping | first1= Alexandre| last1= Gaucher| first2= Andrea| last2= Cattoni| first3= Christophe| last3= Dupuis| first4= Wanghua| last4= Chen| first5= Romain| last5= Cariou|last6 = Foldyna| first6=Martin | last7=Lalouat | first7=Loı̈c | last8=Drouard | first8=Emmanuel | last9=Seassal | first9=Christian | last10=Roca i Cabarrocas | first10=Pere | last11=Collin | first11=Stéphane | publisher= | journal= Nano Letters| year= 2016| volume= 16| issue=9 | pages= 5358| bibcode=2016NanoL..16.5358G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChenCariou2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Chen | first1=Wanghua | last2=Cariou | first2=Romain | last3=Foldyna | first3=Martin | last4=Depauw | first4=Valerie | last5=Trompoukis | first5=Christos | last6=Drouard | first6=Emmanuel | last7=Lalouat | first7=Loic | last8=Harouri | first8=Abdelmounaim | last9=Liu | first9=Jia | last10=Fave | first10=Alain | last11=Orobtchouk | first11=Régis | last12=Mandorlo | first12=Fabien | last13=Seassal | first13=Christian | last14=Massiot | first14=Inès | last15=Dmitriev | first15=Alexandre | last16=Lee | first16=Ki-Dong | last17=Cabarrocas | first17=Pere Roca i | title=Nanophotonics-based low-temperature PECVD epitaxial crystalline silicon solar cells | journal=Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics | volume=49 | issue=12 | year=2016 | pages=125603 | issn=0022-3727 | doi=10.1088/0022-3727/49/12/125603| bibcode=2016JPhD...49l5603C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, it was reported that [[heterojunction]] solar cells grown epitaxially on n-type monocrystalline silicon wafers had reached an efficiency of 22.5% over a total cell area of 243.4&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;math&gt;^2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="KobayashiWatabe2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kobayashi|first1=Eiji|last2=Watabe|first2=Yoshimi|last3=Hao|first3=Ruiying|last4=Ravi|first4=T.

==== Polycrystalline silicon ====
{{Main|Polycrystalline silicon}}
[[Polycrystalline silicon]], or multicrystalline silicon (multi-Si) cells are made from cast square ingots—large blocks of molten silicon carefully cooled and solidified. They consist of small crystals giving the material its typical [[Crystallite|metal flake effect]]. Polysilicon cells are the most common type used in photovoltaics and are less expensive, but also less efficient, than those made from monocrystalline silicon.

==== Ribbon silicon ====
[[Ribbon silicon]] is a type of polycrystalline silicon—it is formed by drawing flat thin films from [[molten]] silicon and results in a polycrystalline structure. These cells are cheaper to make than multi-Si, due to a great reduction in silicon waste, as this approach does not require [[saw]]ing from [[ingot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ece.gatech.edu/research/UCEP/papers/3world/STRING%20RIBBON%20SILICON%20SOLAR%20CELLS%20WITH%2017.8%25%20EFFICIENCY.pdf|title=String ribbon silicon solar cells with 17.8% efficiency|author=Kim, D.S.|journal=Proceedings of 3rd World Conference on Photovoltaic Energy Conversion, 2003|date=18 May 2003|pages= 1293–1296|volume=2|isbn=4-9901816-0-3
|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are also less efficient.

==== Mono-like-multi silicon (MLM) ====
This form was developed in the 2000s and introduced commercially around 2009. Also called cast-mono, this design uses polycrystalline casting chambers with small "seeds" of mono material. The result is a bulk mono-like material that is polycrystalline around the outsides. When sliced for processing, the inner sections are high-efficiency mono-like cells (but square instead of "clipped"), while the outer edges are sold as conventional poly. This production method results in mono-like cells at poly-like prices.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne McMillan, [http://btimaging.com/Downloads/bt_PV_eng-Advertorial3_Final.pdf "The Cast Mono Dilemma"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105134839/http://www.btimaging.com/downloads/bt_pv_eng-advertorial3_final.pdf |date=5 November 2013 }}, BT Imaging&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thin film ===
{{Main|Thin-film solar cell}}
Thin-film technologies reduce the amount of active material in a cell. Most designs sandwich active material between two panes of glass. Since silicon solar panels only use one pane of glass, thin film panels are approximately twice as heavy as crystalline silicon panels, although they have a smaller ecological impact (determined from [[life cycle analysis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| doi = 10.1115/SED2002-1051| chapter = Net Energy Analysis for Sustainable Energy Production from Silicon Based Solar Cells| title = Solar Energy| page = 181| year = 2002| last1 = Pearce| first1 = J.| last2 = Lau| first2 = A.| isbn = 0-7918-1689-3| url = http://www.cede.psu.edu/users/alau/ases02_net_energy_pv.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100622021014/http://www.cede.psu.edu/users/alau/ASES02_Net_Energy_PV.pdf| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- The majority of film panels have 2–3 percentage points lower conversion efficiencies than crystalline silicon.&lt;ref&gt;Datasheets of the market leaders: ''First Solar'' for thin film, ''Suntech'' and ''SunPower'' for crystalline silicon&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cadmium telluride]] (CdTe), [[copper indium gallium selenide]] (CIGS) and [[amorphous silicon]] (a-Si) are three thin-film technologies often used for outdoor applications. As of December 2013, CdTe cost per installed watt was $0.59 as reported by First Solar. CIGS technology laboratory demonstrations reached 20.4% conversion efficiency as of December 2013. The lab efficiency of GaAs thin film technology topped 28%.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} The [[quantum efficiency]] of thin film solar cells is also lower due to reduced number of collected charge carriers per incident photon. Most recently, CZTS solar cell emerge as the less-toxic thin film solar cell technology, which achieved ~12% efficiency. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Thin Film Solar Cells: Research in an Industrial Perspective|journal = AMBIO|date = March 2012|issn = 0044-7447|pmc = 3357764|pmid = 22434436|pages = 112–118|volume = 41|issue = 2|doi = 10.1007/s13280-012-0265-6|first = Marika|last = Edoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cadmium telluride ====
{{Main|Cadmium telluride photovoltaics}}
Cadmium telluride is the only thin film material so far to rival crystalline silicon in cost/watt. However cadmium is highly toxic and [[tellurium]] ([[anion]]: "telluride") supplies are limited. The [[cadmium]] present in the cells would be toxic if released. However, release is impossible during normal operation of the cells and is unlikely during fires in residential roofs.&lt;ref name="Fthenakis 303–334"&gt;{{Cite journal

==== Copper indium gallium selenide ====
{{Main|Copper indium gallium selenide solar cell}}
Copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) is a [[Direct and indirect band gaps|direct band gap]] material. It has the highest efficiency (~20%) among all commercially significant thin film materials (see [[Copper indium gallium selenide solar cell|CIGS solar cell]]). Traditional methods of fabrication involve vacuum processes including co-evaporation and sputtering. Recent developments at [[IBM]] and [[Nanosolar]] attempt to lower the cost by using non-vacuum solution processes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/24464.wss "IBM and Tokyo Ohka Kogyo Turn Up Watts on Solar Energy Production"], IBM&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Silicon thin film ====
[[Silicon thin-film cell]]s are mainly deposited by [[chemical vapor deposition]] (typically plasma-enhanced, PE-CVD) from [[silane]] gas and [[hydrogen]] gas. Depending on the deposition parameters, this can yield [[amorphous silicon]] (a-Si or a-Si:H), [[protocrystalline]] silicon or [[nanocrystalline silicon]] (nc-Si or nc-Si:H), also called microcrystalline silicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0927-0248(02)00436-1| title = Evolution of microstructure and phase in amorphous, protocrystalline, and microcrystalline silicon studied by real time spectroscopic ellipsometry| journal = Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells| volume = 78| page = 143| year = 2003| last1 = Collins | first1 = R.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amorphous silicon is the most well-developed thin film technology to-date. An amorphous silicon (a-Si) solar cell is made of non-crystalline or microcrystalline silicon. Amorphous silicon has a higher bandgap (1.7&amp;nbsp;eV) than crystalline silicon (c-Si) (1.1&amp;nbsp;eV), which means it absorbs the visible part of the solar spectrum more strongly than the higher power density [[infrared]] portion of the spectrum. The production of a-Si thin film solar cells uses glass as a substrate and deposits a very thin layer of silicon by [[plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition]] (PECVD).

Protocrystalline silicon with a low volume fraction of nanocrystalline silicon is optimal for high open circuit voltage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1063/1.2714507| title = Optimization of open circuit voltage in amorphous silicon solar cells with mixed-phase (amorphous+nanocrystalline) p-type contacts of low nanocrystalline content| journal = Journal of Applied Physics| volume = 101| issue = 11| page = 114301| year = 2007| last1 = Pearce| first1 = J.

The top cell in a-Si absorbs the visible light and leaves the infrared part of the spectrum for the bottom cell in nc-Si.

==== Gallium arsenide thin film ====
The semiconductor material [[Gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) is also used for single-crystalline thin film solar cells. Although GaAs cells are very expensive, they hold the world's record in efficiency for a [[Single-junction cell|single-junction]] solar cell at 28.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1109/PVSC.2012.6317891|chapter=The opto-electronic physics that broke the efficiency limit in solar cells|title=2012 38th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference|year=2012|last1=Yablonovitch|first1=Eli|last2=Miller|first2=Owen D.|last3=Kurtz|first3=S. R.|isbn=978-1-4673-0066-7|page=001556}}&lt;/ref&gt; GaAs is more commonly used in [[multijunction photovoltaic cell]]s for [[concentrated photovoltaics]] (CPV, HCPV) and for [[solar panels on spacecraft]]s, as the industry favours efficiency over cost for [[space-based solar power]].

=== Multijunction cells ===
[[File:Dawn solar panel.jpg|thumb|[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'s 10&amp;nbsp;[[Kilowatt|kW]] triple-junction gallium arsenide solar array at full extension]]
{{Main|Multi-junction solar cell}}
Multi-junction cells consist of multiple thin films, each essentially a solar cell grown on top of another, typically using [[metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy]]. Each layer has a different band gap energy to allow it to absorb [[electromagnetic radiation]] over a different portion of the spectrum. Multi-junction cells were originally developed for special applications such as [[satellite]]s and [[space exploration]], but are now used increasingly in terrestrial [[concentrator photovoltaics]] (CPV), an emerging technology that uses lenses and curved mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto small, highly efficient multi-junction solar cells. By concentrating sunlight up to a thousand times, ''High concentrated photovoltaics (HCPV)'' has the potential to outcompete conventional solar PV in the future.&lt;ref name=Fraunhofer-PR-2014&gt;

== Research in solar cells ==
=== Perovskite solar cells ===
{{Main|Perovskite solar cell}}
[[Perovskite solar cell]]s are solar cells that include a [[perovskite]]-structured material as the active layer. Most commonly, this is a solution-processed hybrid organic-inorganic tin or lead halide based material. Efficiencies have increased from below 5% at their first usage in 2009 to over 20% in 2014, making them a very rapidly advancing technology and a hot topic in the solar cell field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NREL effiiciency chart|url=http://www.nrel.gov/ncpv/images/efficiency_chart.jpg|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122164942/http://www.nrel.gov/ncpv/images/efficiency_chart.jpg|archivedate=22 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perovskite solar cells are also forecast to be extremely cheap to scale up, making them a very attractive option for commercialisation. So far most types of perovskite solar cells have not reached sufficient operational stability to be commercialised, although many research groups are investigating ways to solve this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kosasih|first1=Felix Utama|last2=Ducati|first2=Caterina|title=Characterising degradation of perovskite solar cells through in-situ and operando electron microscopy|journal=Nano Energy|date=May 2018|volume=47|pages=243–256|doi=10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.02.055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bifacial solar cells ===
[[File:Noto Bifacial Plant.png|thumb|Bifacial solar cell plant in Noto (Senegal), 1988 - Floor painted in white to enhance albedo.]]
With a transparent rear side, bifacial solar cells can absorb light from both the front and rear sides. Hence, they can produce more electricity than conventional monofacial solar cells. The first patent of bifacial solar cells was filed by Japanese researcher Hiroshi Mori, in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1961-10-03|others=Mori Hiroshi, Hayakawa Denki Kogyo KK|title=Radiation energy transducing device|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US3278811}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it is said that Russia was the first to deploy bifacial solar cells in their space program in the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} In 1976, the [http://www.ies.upm.es/ Institute for Solar Energy] of the [[Technical University of Madrid]], began a research program for the development of bifacial solar cells led by [[Antonio Luque López|Prof. Antonio Luque]]. Based on 1977 US and Spanish patents by Luque, a practical bifacial cell was proposed with a front face as anode and a rear face as cathode; in previously reported proposals and attempts both faces were anodic and interconnection between cells was complicated and expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|ES|453575 (A1)|A. Luque: "Procedimiento para obtener células solares bifaciales" filing date 05.05.1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|4169738 (A)|A.

With an initial production capacity of 300kW/yr. of bifacial solar cells, early landmarks of Isofoton's production were the 20kWp power plant in [[San Agustín de Guadalix]], built in 1986 for [[Iberdrola]], and an off grid installation by 1988 also of 20kWp in the village of Noto Gouye Diama ([[Senegal]]) funded by the [[Spanish_Agency_for_International_Development_Cooperation|Spanish international aid and cooperation programs]]. 

Due to the reduced manufacturing cost, companies have again started to produce commercial bifacial modules since 2010. By 2017, there were at least eight certified PV manufacturers providing bifacial modules in North America. It has been predicted by the International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaics (ITRPV) that the global market share of bifacial technology will expand from less than 5% in 2016 to 30% in 2027.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itrpv.net/|title=International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaic (ITRPV) - Home|website=www.itrpv.net|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the significant interest in the bifacial technology, a recent study has investigated the performance and optimization of bifacial solar modules worldwide.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Xingshu|last2=Khan|first2=Mohammad Ryyan|last3=Deline|first3=Chris|last4=Alam|first4=Muhammad Ashraful|title=Optimization and performance of bifacial solar modules: A global perspective|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306261917317567|journal=Applied Energy|volume=212|pages=1601–1610|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.12.041}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khan|first=M.

However, the gain can be increased to ~30% by elevating the module 1 m above the ground and enhancing the ground albedo coefficient to 50%. Sun ''et al.'' also derived a set of empirical equations that can optimize bifacial solar modules analytically.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Intermediate Band ===
{{Main|Intermediate band photovoltaics}}

'''Intermediate band photovoltaics''' in solar cell research provides methods for exceeding the [[Shockley–Queisser limit]] on the efficiency of a cell. It introduces an intermediate band (IB) energy level in between the valence and conduction bands. Theoretically, introducing an IB allows two [[photons]] with energy less than the [[bandgap]] to excite an electron from the [[valence band]] to the [[conduction band]]. This increases the induced photocurrent and thereby efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Luque, Antonio, and Antonio Martí. "Increasing the Efficiency of Ideal Solar Cells by Photon Induced Transitions at Intermediate Levels." Physical Review Letters 78.26 (1997): 5014-017. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antonio Luque López|Luque]] and Marti first derived a theoretical limit for an IB device with one midgap energy level using [[detailed balance]]. They assumed no carriers were collected at the IB and that the device was under full concentration. They found the maximum efficiency to be 63.2%, for a bandgap of 1.95eV with the IB 0.71eV from either the valence or conduction band.
Under one sun illumination the limiting efficiency is 47%.&lt;ref&gt;Okada, Yoshitaka, Tomah Sogabe, and Yasushi Shoji.

=== Liquid inks ===
In 2014, researchers at [[California NanoSystems Institute]] discovered using [[kesterite]] and [[perovskite]] improved [[electric power conversion]] efficiency for solar cells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2014-09-liquid-inks-solar-cells.html Researchers use liquid inks to create better solar cells], Phys.org, 17 September 2014, Shaun Mason&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Upconversion and downconversion===
[[Photon upconversion]] is the process of using two low-energy (''e.g.'', infrared) photons to produce one higher energy photon; '''downconversion''' is the process of using one high energy photon (''e.g.,'', ultraviolet) to produce two lower energy photons. Either of these techniques could be used to produce higher efficiency solar cells by allowing solar photons to be more efficiently used. The difficulty, however, is that the conversion efficiency of existing [[phosphor]]s exhibiting up- or down-conversion is low, and is typically narrow band.

One upconversion technique is to incorporate [[lanthanide]]-doped materials ([[Erbium|{{chem|Er|3+}}]], [[Ytterbium|{{chem|Yb|3+}}]], [[Holmium|{{chem|Ho|3+}}]] or a combination), taking advantage of their [[luminescence]] to convert [[infrared radiation]] to visible light. Upconversion process occurs when two [[infrared]] photons are absorbed by [[rare-earth]] [[ion]]s to generate a (high-energy) absorbable photon. As example, the energy transfer upconversion process (ETU), consists in successive transfer processes between excited ions in the near infrared. The upconverter material could be placed below the solar cell to absorb the infrared light that passes through the silicon. Useful ions are most commonly found in the trivalent state. {{chem|Er|+}} ions have been the most used. {{chem|Er|3+}} ions absorb solar radiation around 1.54&amp;nbsp;µm. Two {{chem|Er|3+}} ions that have absorbed this radiation can interact with each other through an upconversion process. The excited ion emits light above the Si bandgap that is absorbed by the solar cell and creates an additional electron–hole pair that can generate current. However, the increased efficiency was small. In addition, fluoroindate glasses have low [[phonon]] energy and have been proposed as suitable matrix doped with {{chem|Ho|3+}} ions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hernández-Rodríguez|first=M.A.|author2=Imanieh, M.H. |author3=Martín, L.L. |author4= Martín, I.R. |title=Experimental enhancement of the photocurrent in a solar cell using upconversion process in fluoroindate glasses exciting at 1480nm|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|date=September 2013|volume=116|pages=171–175|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2013.04.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Light-absorbing dyes ===
{{Main|Dye-sensitized solar cell|l1=Dye-sensitized solar cells}}
[[Dye-sensitized solar cell]]s (DSSCs) are made of low-cost materials and do not need elaborate manufacturing equipment, so they can be made in a [[Do it yourself|DIY]] fashion. In bulk it should be significantly less expensive than older [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] cell designs. DSSC's can be engineered into flexible sheets and although its [[conversion efficiency]] is less than the best [[thin film cell]]s, its [[price/performance ratio]] may be high enough to allow them to compete with [[fossil fuel electrical generation]].

Typically a [[ruthenium]] [[Metalorganics|metalorganic]] [[dye]] (Ru-centered) is used as a [[monolayer]] of light-absorbing material. The dye-sensitized solar cell depends on a [[mesoporous]] layer of [[nanoparticulate]] [[titanium dioxide]] to greatly amplify the surface area (200–300 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g {{chem|TiO|2}}, as compared to approximately 10 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g of flat single crystal). The photogenerated electrons from the light absorbing dye are passed on to the n-type {{chem|TiO|2}} and the holes are absorbed by an [[electrolyte]] on the other side of the dye. The circuit is completed by a [[redox]] couple in the electrolyte, which can be liquid or solid. This type of cell allows more flexible use of materials and is typically manufactured by [[screen printing]] or [[ultrasonic nozzle]]s, with the potential for lower processing costs than those used for bulk solar cells. However, the dyes in these cells also suffer from [[chemical decomposition|degradation]] under heat and [[UV]] light and the cell casing is difficult to [[Seal (mechanical)|seal]] due to the solvents used in assembly. The first commercial shipment of DSSC solar modules occurred in July 2009 from G24i Innovations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.g24i.com Dye Sensitized Solar Cells]. G24i.com (2 April 2014). Retrieved 20 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quantum dots ===
{{Main|Quantum dot solar cell}}
[[Quantum dot solar cell]]s (QDSCs) are based on the Gratzel cell, or [[dye-sensitized solar cell]] architecture, but employ low [[band gap]] [[semiconductor]] [[nanoparticle]]s, fabricated with crystallite sizes small enough to form [[quantum dots]] (such as [[cadmium sulfide|CdS]], [[cadmium selenide|CdSe]], [[Stibnite|{{chem|Sb|2|S|3}}]], [[Lead(II) sulfide|PbS]], etc.), instead of organic or organometallic dyes as light absorbers. Due to the toxicity associated with Cd and Pb based compounds there are also a series of "green" QD sensitizing materials in development (such as CuInS&lt;sub href="Refractive index"&gt;2,&lt;/sub&gt; CuInSe&lt;sub href="multiple exciton generation"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CuInSeS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-10-01|title=Quantum dot sensitized solar cell: Recent advances and future perspectives in photoanode|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927024816301696|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|volume=155|pages=294–322|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2016.05.062|issn=0927-0248}}&lt;/ref&gt; QD's size quantization allows for the band gap to be tuned by simply changing particle size. They also have high [[Refractive index|extinction coefficients]] and have shown the possibility of [[multiple exciton generation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1209845|title=Peak External Photocurrent Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 100% via MEG in a Quantum Dot Solar Cell|year=2011|last1=Semonin|first1=O.

In a QDSC, a [[mesoporous]] layer of [[titanium dioxide]] nanoparticles forms the backbone of the cell, much like in a DSSC. This {{chem|TiO|2}} layer can then be made photoactive by coating with semiconductor quantum dots using [[chemical bath deposition]], [[electrophoretic deposition]] or successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction.

=== Organic/polymer solar cells ===
{{Main|Organic solar cell|Polymer solar cell}}
[[Organic solar cell]]s and [[polymer solar cell]]s are built from thin films (typically 100&amp;nbsp;nm) of [[organic semiconductor]]s including polymers, such as [[polyphenylene vinylene]] and small-molecule compounds like copper phthalocyanine (a blue or green organic pigment) and [[fullerene|carbon fullerenes]] and fullerene derivatives such as [[PCBM]].

They can be processed from liquid solution, offering the possibility of a simple roll-to-roll printing process, potentially leading to inexpensive, large-scale production. In addition, these cells could be beneficial for some applications where mechanical flexibility and disposability are important. Current cell efficiencies are, however, very low, and practical devices are essentially non-existent.

Energy conversion efficiencies achieved to date using conductive polymers are very low compared to inorganic materials. However, [[Konarka]] Power Plastic reached efficiency of 8.3%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pv-tech.org/news/nrel_validates_konarkas_8.3_power_plastic_efficiency_record Konarka Power Plastic reaches 8.3% efficiency]. pv-tech.org. Retrieved 7 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and organic tandem cells in 2012 reached 11.1%.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The active region of an organic device consists of two materials, one electron donor and one electron acceptor. When a photon is converted into an electron hole pair, typically in the donor material, the charges tend to remain bound in the form of an [[exciton]], separating when the exciton diffuses to the donor-acceptor interface, unlike most other solar cell types. The short exciton diffusion lengths of most polymer systems tend to limit the efficiency of such devices.

=== Adaptive cells ===
Adaptive cells change their absorption/reflection characteristics depending to respond to environmental conditions. An adaptive material responds to the intensity and angle of incident light. At the part of the cell where the light is most intense, the cell surface changes from reflective to adaptive, allowing the light to penetrate the cell. The other parts of the cell remain reflective increasing the retention of the absorbed light within the cell.&lt;ref name=tr1407&gt;Bullis, Kevin (30 July 2014) [http://www.technologyreview.com/news/529476/adaptive-material-could-cut-the-cost-of-solar-in-half Adaptive Material Could Cut the Cost of Solar in Half]. ''MIT Technology Review''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a system was developed that combined an adaptive surface with a glass substrate that redirect the absorbed to a light absorber on the edges of the sheet. The system also includes an array of fixed lenses/mirrors to concentrate light onto the adaptive surface. As the day continues, the concentrated light moves along the surface of the cell. That surface switches from reflective to adaptive when the light is most concentrated and back to reflective after the light moves along.&lt;ref name=tr1407/&gt;

=== Surface texturing ===
For the past years, researchers have been trying to reduce the price of solar cells while maximizing efficiency. [[Thin-film solar cell]] is a cost-effective second generation solar cell with much reduced thickness at the expense of light absorption efficiency. Efforts to maximize light absorption efficiency with reduced thickness have been made. Surface texturing is one of techniques used to reduce optical losses to maximize light absorbed. Currently, surface texturing techniques on silicon photovoltaics are drawing much attention. Surface texturing could be done in multiple ways. Etching single crystalline silicon substrate can produce randomly distributed square based pyramids on the surface using anisotropic etchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Patrick|author2=Green, Martin A. |title=Light Trapping Properties of Pyramidally textured surfaces|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=Feb 1987|volume=62| pages=243–249|doi=10.1063/1.339189|bibcode=1987JAP....62..243C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies show that c-Si wafers could be etched down to form nano-scale inverted pyramids. Multicrystalline silicon solar cells, due to poorer crystallographic quality, are less effective than single crystal solar cells, but mc-Si solar cells are still being used widely due to less manufacturing difficulties. It is reported that multicrystalline solar cells can be surface-textured to yield solar energy conversion efficiency comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon cells, through isotropic etching or photolithography techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Jianhua|author2=Wang, Aihua |author3=Green, Martin A.|title=19.8% efficient "honeycomb" textured multicrystalline and 24.4% monocrystalline silicon solar cells|journal=Applied Physics Letters|date=May 1998|volume=73|issue=14| pages=1991–1993|doi=10.1063/1.122345|bibcode=1998ApPhL..73.1991Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hauser|first=H.|author2=Michl, B.|author3=Kubler, V.|author4= Schwarzkopf, S.|author5= Muller, C.|author6= Hermle, M.|author7= Blasi, B.|title=Nanoimprint Lithography for Honeycomb Texturing of Multicrystalline Silicon|journal=Energy Procedia|date=2011|volume=8|pages=648–653|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2011.06.196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incident light rays onto a textured surface do not reflect back out to the air as opposed to rays onto a flat surface. Rather some light rays are bounced back onto the other surface again due to the geometry of the surface. This process significantly improves light to electricity conversion efficiency, due to increased light absorption. This texture effect as well as the interaction with other interfaces in the PV module is a challenging optical simulation task. A particularly efficient method for modeling and optimization is the [[OPTOS formalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tucher|first=Nico|last2=Eisenlohr|first2=Johannes|last3=Gebrewold|first3=Habtamu|last4=Kiefel|first4=Peter|last5=Höhn|first5=Oliver|last6=Hauser|first6=Hubert|last7=Goldschmidt|first7=Jan Christoph|last8=Bläsi|first8=Benedikt|date=2016-07-11|title=Optical simulation of photovoltaic modules with multiple textured interfaces using the matrix-based formalism OPTOS|journal=Optics Express|volume=24|issue=14|pages=A1083–A1093|doi=10.1364/OE.24.0A1083|bibcode=2016OExpr..24A1083T}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, researchers at MIT reported that c-Si films textured with nanoscale inverted pyramids could achieve light absorption comparable to 30 times thicker planar c-Si.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mavrokefalos|first=Anastassios|author2=Han, Sang Eon. |author3=Yerci, Selcuk |author4= Branham, M.S.|author5= Chen, Gang. |title=Efficient Light Trapping in Inverted Nanopyramid Thin Crystalline Silicon Membranes for Solar Cell Applications|journal=Nano Letters|date=June 2012|volume=12|issue=6| pages=2792–2796|doi=10.1021/nl2045777|bibcode=2012NanoL..12.2792M |pmid=22612694}}&lt;/ref&gt; In combination with [[anti-reflective coating]], surface texturing technique can effectively trap light rays within a thin film silicon solar cell. Consequently, required thickness for solar cells decreases with the increased absorption of light rays.

=== Encapsulation ===
Solar cells are commonly encapsulated in a transparent polymeric resin to protect the delicate solar cell regions for coming into contact with moisture, dirt, ice, and other conditions expected either during operation or when used outdoors. The encapsulants are commonly made from [[polyvinyl acetate]] or glass. Most encapsulants are uniform in structure and composition, which increases light collection owing to light trapping from total internal reflection of light within the resin. Research has been conducted into structuring the encapsulant to provide further collection of light. Such encapsulants have included roughened glass surfaces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1109/PVSC.2010.5614568|chapter=Light management for reduction of bus bar and gridline shadowing in photovoltaic modules|title=2010 35th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference|pages=000979|year=2010|last1=Jaus|first1=J.|last2=Pantsar|first2=H.|last3=Eckert|first3=J.|last4=Duell|first4=M.|last5=Herfurth|first5=H.|last6=Doble|first6=D.|isbn=978-1-4244-5890-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; diffractive elements,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mingareev|first=I.|last2=Berlich|first2=R.|last3=Eichelkraut|first3=T.

[[File:FX-77.JPG|thumb|upright|Early [[solar-powered calculator]]]]
Solar cells share some of the same processing and manufacturing techniques as other semiconductor devices. However, the stringent requirements for cleanliness and quality control of semiconductor fabrication are more relaxed for solar cells, lowering costs.

[[Polycrystalline silicon]] wafers are made by wire-sawing block-cast silicon ingots into 180 to 350 micrometer wafers. The wafers are usually lightly [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]]-doped. A surface diffusion of [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] dopants is performed on the front side of the wafer. This forms a p–n junction a few hundred nanometers below the surface.

[[Anti-reflective coating|Anti-reflection coatings]] are then typically applied to increase the amount of light coupled into the solar cell. [[Silicon nitride]] has gradually replaced titanium dioxide as the preferred material, because of its excellent surface passivation qualities. It prevents carrier recombination at the cell surface. A layer several hundred nanometers thick is applied using PECVD. Some solar cells have textured front surfaces that, like anti-reflection coatings, increase the amount of light reaching the wafer. Such surfaces were first applied to single-crystal silicon, followed by multicrystalline silicon somewhat later.

A full area metal contact is made on the back surface, and a grid-like metal contact made up of fine "fingers" and larger "bus bars" are screen-printed onto the front surface using a [[silver]] paste. This is an evolution of the so-called "wet" process for applying electrodes, first described in a US patent filed in 1981 by [[Bayer AG]].&lt;ref&gt;Fitzky, Hans G. and Ebneth, Harold (24 May 1983) {{US patent|4385102}}, "Large-area photovoltaic cell"&lt;/ref&gt; The rear contact is formed by screen-printing a metal paste, typically aluminium. Usually this contact covers the entire rear, though some designs employ a grid pattern. The paste is then fired at several hundred degrees Celsius to form metal electrodes in [[ohmic contact]] with the silicon. Some companies use an additional electro-plating step to increase efficiency. After the metal contacts are made, the solar cells are interconnected by flat wires or metal ribbons, and assembled into [[photovoltaic module|modules]] or "solar panels". Solar panels have a sheet of [[tempered glass]] on the front, and a [[polymer]] encapsulation on the back.

A '''spork''' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''spoon'' and ''fork''), is a hybrid form of [[cutlery]] taking the form of a [[spoon]]-like shallow scoop with two to four [[wikt:tine|tines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.articlearchives.com/travel-hospitality-tourism/restaurants-food-service/471277-1.html|title=The splendid spork a marvel to behold|last=Shepard|first=Helen-Marie|date=27 May 2002|publisher=The Register Guard|accessdate=1 February 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512003334/http://www.articlearchives.com/travel-hospitality-tourism/restaurants-food-service/471277-1.html|archivedate=12 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spork-like utensils, such as the terrapin fork or ice cream fork,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Petroski|first = Henry|publisher = Knopf|isbn = 0-679-41226-3| year = 1992| title = The Evolution of Useful Things| page = 135| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zZtRAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=terrapin&amp;pgis=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been manufactured since the late 19th century;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prices4antiques.com/silver-gold/flatware/Terrapin-Forks-12-Sterling-Gorham-Imperial-Chrysanthemum-Pattern-Engraved-D9814231.htm|title = Terrapin Forks (1890 - 1900)|publisher = Prices 4 Antiques}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[patent]]s for spork-like designs date back to at least 1874, and the word "spork" was registered as a [[trademark]] in the US and the UK decades later. They are used by fast food restaurants, schools, prisons, the military, backpackers and in [[airline meal]]s.

The word ''spork'' combines ''spoon'' and ''fork''. It appeared in the 1909 supplement to the ''[[Century Dictionary]],'' where it was described as a [[trade name]] and "a '[[portmanteau]]-word' applied to a long, slender spoon having, at the end of the bowl, projections resembling the tines of a fork".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/centurydictionar12whituoft#page/1256/mode/2up/search/spork|title=The Century dictionary and cyclopedia; a work of universal reference in all departments of knowledge with a new atlas of the world|website=archive.org|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In the US, patents for sporks and proto-sporks have been issued. A combined spoon, fork, and knife closely resembling the modern spork was invented by Samuel W. Francis and issued {{US Patent|147,119}} in February 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{US-patent|147,119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early patents predating the modern spork include {{US Patent|904,553}},&lt;ref&gt;{{US-patent|904,553}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a "cutting spoon", granted on November 24, 1908 to Harry L. McCoy and {{US Patent | 1,044,869}},&lt;ref&gt;{{US-patent|1,044,869}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a spoon with a tined edge, granted to Frank Emmenegger in November 1912. Many of these inventions predated the use of the term "spork". Given this significant prior art, the basic concept of combining aspects of a spoon and fork is well established; more modern patents have limited themselves to the specific implementation and appearance of the spork. These [[design patent]]s do not prevent anyone from designing and manufacturing a different version of a spork. Examples of modern US design patents for sporks include patent number D247,153 issued in February 1978&lt;ref&gt;{{US-patent|D247,153}}&lt;/ref&gt; and patent D388,664 issued in January 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{US-patent|D388,664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''word'' spork [[neologism|originated]] in the early 20th century to describe such devices. In 1951, Hyde W. Ballard of [[Westtown Township, Pennsylvania|Westtown, Pennsylvania]] filed an application with the [[United States Patent Office]] (USPO; now the United States Patent and Trademark Office) to register "Spork" as a [[trademark]] for a combination spoon and fork made of stainless steel.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. trademark application, serial no. 609,277, filed January 26, 1951. [[Trademark Official Gazette|Official Gazette of the United States Patent Office]], [https://archive.org/details/officialgazette664unit vol. 665], no. 3, p. 673, &lt;!-- page 1171 in the PDF  --&gt;December 16, 1952.  Accessed April 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jones |first=Stacy V. |title=Small Fry Attempting to Get Peek At Yule Gifts May Be Caught in Act: Device Resembling Mouse Trap Registers Every Time Door Is Opened -- Another Patent Covers Rubber Beanie -- List of Inventions Patented In Week |newspaper=New York Times |date=December 20, 1952 |pages=23, 27 |quote=Hyde W.

[http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=901492&amp;caseType=US_REGISTRATION_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch 901,492], filed October 24, 1969, registered October 27, 1970.

[http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=2514381&amp;caseType=US_REGISTRATION_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch 2,514,381], filed March 23, 2000, registered December 4, 2001. Accessed April 2, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, [[Plastico Limited]] registered Spork as a trademark in relation to cutlery with effect from September 18, 1975 (reg. no. 1052291, now expired&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00001052291|title=Search for a trade mark - Intellectual Property Office|website=trademarks.ipo.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The trademark is also registered in the UK in relation to gardening tools in the name of the same UK based individual who owns US trademark registration no. 2514381. Another British company, [[Lifeventure]], sells [[titanium]] and plastic versions using the name "Forkspoon".

In an unsuccessful [[lawsuit]] in 1999 where the company [[Regalzone]] sought to invalidate Plastico Limited's UK registration for Spork, Justice Neuberger wrote:{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
{{quote|I accept that the word ''Spork'' involves a clever idea of making a single word by [[Elision|eliding]] the beginning of the word spoon and the end of the word fork. The fact that it is clever and the fact that the meaning of ''Spork'' could be said to be obvious once it is explained does not mean that it is obvious what it is. Indeed, I would have thought that if one asked a person in 1975 what a Spork was, he or she would not know. If one then explained what it was and how the word came about, one might then be told that it was obvious or that it was clever.}}

==Materials and uses==
[[Image:CodazziSugakiya1.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Japan]]ese spork]]
Materials such as [[stainless steel]], [[silver]], [[aluminum]], [[titanium]], and [[Polycarbonate|polycarbonate plastic]] have been used in spork manufacturing. Plastic sporks are common in prisons in the [[United States]] because they are difficult to form into [[Shiv (weapon)|shiv]]-type [[weapon]]s to attack other inmates.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Prepackaged meals may come with a disposable plastic spork. Sporks are also frequently used by [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpackers]], [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] and other outdoorsmen as they are a lightweight and space-saving alternative to carrying both a fork and spoon.

[[File:AMiBA 1.jpg|thumb|The [[AMiBA]] radio telescope, a [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] experiment, is mounted on a 6 m [[carbon fibre]] hexapod.]]
A '''Gough-Stewart platform''' is a type of [[parallel robot]] that has six [[prismatic joint|prismatic actuators]], commonly [[hydraulic jack]]s or electric actuators, attached in pairs to three positions on the platform's baseplate, crossing over to three mounting points on a top plate.  Devices placed on the top plate can be moved in the six [[Degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]] in which it is possible for a freely-suspended body to move.  These are the three linear movements x, y, z (lateral, longitudinal and vertical), and the three rotations [[Roll, pitch, and yaw|pitch, roll, &amp; yaw]].  The terms "six-axis" or "6-DoF" (Degrees of Freedom) platform are also used, also "synergistic" (see below).

==Name of the device==
[[Image:Hexapod positioner aka Stewart platform x2.jpg|thumb|Two hexapod positioners]]

===Designed by Gough and Stewart===
This specialised six-jack layout was first used by V E (Eric) Gough of the [[UK]] and was operational in 1954,&lt;ref name="Gough, 1956" &gt;{{Cite journal 
  |last=Gough  |first=V. E.

  |pages=392–394
  |year=1956–1957
}}&lt;/ref&gt; the design later being publicised in a 1965 paper by D Stewart to the UK [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]].&lt;ref name="Stewart, 1965" &gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the short title ''Stewart Platform'' is now used for this jack layout, it would be fairer to Eric Gough to call it a ''Gough/Stewart platform''. To be more precise, the original Stewart platform had a slightly different design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Lazard | first1 = D. | last2 = Merlet | first2 = J. -P. | doi = 10.1109/ROBOT.1994.350969 | chapter = The (true) Stewart platform has 12 configurations | title = Proceedings of the 1994 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation | pages = 2160 | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-8186-5330-2 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; See the more detailed references at the end of this article.

===Synergistic===
Because the motions are produced by a combination of movements of several of the jacks, such a device is sometimes called a ''synergistic motion platform'', due to the synergy (mutual interaction) between the way that the jacks are programmed.

===Hexapod===
Because the device has six jacks, it is often also known as a ''hexapod'' (six legs).  The [[trademark]]ed name "hexapod" (by Geodetic Technology)&lt;ref&gt;Parallel Robots - Second Edition by J.P. Merlet (pp. 48)&lt;/ref&gt; was originally for Stewart platforms used in [[machine tool]]s. However, the term is now used for 6-jack platforms outside of the machine tool area, since it simply means "six legs".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fraunhofer.de/fhg/archiv/magazin/pflege.zv.fhg.de/english/publications/df/df2001/magazine2_2001_46.pdf Fraunhofer Research: Hexapod Robot for Spine Surgery]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Stewart platforms have applications in flight simulators, machine tool technology, crane technology, underwater research, air-to-sea rescue, [[mechanical bull]]s, satellite dish positioning, [[Hexapod-Telescope|telescopes]] and orthopedic surgery.

===Flight simulation===
[[Image:Simulator-flight-compartment.jpeg|thumb|right|A Stewart Platform in use by Lufthansa]]

The Stewart platform design is extensively used in [[flight simulation]], particularly in the so-called [[full flight simulator]] for which all 6 degrees of freedom are required. This application was developed by [[Thales Training &amp; Simulation|Redifon]], whose simulators featuring it became available for the Boeing 707, Douglas DC-8, [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]], [[Canadair CL-44]], [[Boeing 727]], Comet, [[Vickers Viscount]], [[Vickers Vanguard]],
[[Convair 990 Coronado|Convair CV 990]], [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]], [[Vickers VC10]], and [[Fokker F27 Friendship|Fokker F-27]] by 1962.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1962/1962%20-%201616.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In  this role, the payload is a replica cockpit and a visual display system, normally of several channels, for showing the outside-world visual scene to the aircraft crew that are being trained.  Payload weights in the case of a full flight simulator for a large transport aircraft can be up to about 15,000 kilogrammes.

Similar platforms are used in [[driving simulators]], typically mounted on large [[x-y tables]] to simulate short term acceleration.  Long term acceleration can be simulated by tilting the platform, and an active research area is how to mix the two.

===RoboCrane===
[[James S. Albus]] of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] ([[NIST]]) developed the [[robocrane|RoboCrane]], where the platform hangs from six cables instead of being supported by six jacks.

[[Image:gough-platform.jpg|thumb|right|Eric Gough's Tire Testing Machine, which is a Stewart Platform with large jacks]]

===LIDS===
The [[Low impact docking system]] developed by NASA uses a Stewart platform to manipulate space vehicles during the docking process.

===CAREN===
The Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment developed by Motek Medical uses a Stewart platform coupled with virtual reality to do advanced biomechanical and clinical research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.motekforcelink.com/caren&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taylor Spatial Frame===
Dr. J. Charles Taylor utilized the Stewart platform to develop the [[Taylor Spatial Frame]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jcharlestaylor.com&lt;/ref&gt; an [[external fixator]] used in [[orthopedic surgery]] for the correction of bone deformities and treatment of complex fractures.

=== Mechanical testing ===
* First application: Eric Gough was an automotive engineer and worked at [[Fort Dunlop]], the [[Dunlop Tyres]] factory in [[Birmingham]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

  |pages=86, 91
}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed his "Universal Tyre-Testing Machine" (also called the "Universal Rig") in the 1950s and his platform was operational by 1954.&lt;ref name="Gough, 1956" /&gt; The rig was able to mechanically test tyres under combined loads. Dr. Gough died in 1972 but his testing rig continued to be used up until the late 1980s when the factory was closed down and then demolished. His rig was saved and transported to the [[Science Museum (London)]] storage facility at Wroughton near Swindon.
* Recent applications: the rebirth of interest for a mechanical testing machine based on Gough-Stewart platform occurred in the mid '90s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michopoulos|first=John G.|last2=Hermanson|first2=John C.|last3=Furukawa|first3=Tomonari|title=Towards the robotic characterization of the constitutive response of composite materials|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compstruct.2008.03.009|journal=Composite Structures|volume=86|issue=1-3|pages=154–164|doi=10.1016/j.compstruct.2008.03.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often biomedical applications (for example spinal study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stokes|first=Ian A.|last2=Gardner-Morse|first2=Mack|last3=Churchill|first3=David|last4=Laible|first4=Jeffrey P.|title=Measurement of a spinal motion segment stiffness matrix|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0021-9290(01)00221-4|journal=Journal of Biomechanics|volume=35|issue=4|pages=517–521|doi=10.1016/s0021-9290(01)00221-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;) because of the complexity and large amplitude of the motions needed to reproduce human or animal behaviour. Such requirements are also encountered in the civil engineering field for seism simulation. Controlled by a full-field kinematic measurement algorithm, such machines can also be used to study complex phenomena on stiff specimens (for example the curved propagation of a crack through a concrete block&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jailin|first=Clément|last2=Carpiuc|first2=Andreea|last3=Kazymyrenko|first3=Kyrylo|last4=Poncelet|first4=Martin|last5=Leclerc|first5=Hugo|last6=Hild|first6=François|last7=Roux|first7=Stéphane|title=Virtual hybrid test control of sinuous crack|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmps.2017.03.001|journal=Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids|volume=102|pages=239–256|doi=10.1016/j.jmps.2017.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that need high load capacities and displacement accuracy.

==History==
[[Image:Édouard-Henri Avril (27).jpg|thumb|300 px|Late 19th-century painting by [[Édouard-Henri Avril]] showing the use of a strap-on dildo by lesbians.]]
Due to the often taboo nature of strap-on activities, information on their history is difficult to find.
 
Many artifacts from the [[Upper Paleolithic]] have been found that appear to be dildos, including a double "baton" with a hole in the middle, theorized to be for a strap to hold it to a wearer. 

Female-female dildo usage in ancient [[China]] has been documented, but it is not clear if this was double-dildos, strap-on dildos, or just a simple dildo being used by one woman on another. 

In ancient [[Greece]], dildos were made of stone or padded leather, and some evidence shows aforementioned leather was used to make a harness as well, with [[olive oil]] used for anal penetration. 

The ''[[Kama Sutra]]''(2nd century CE) includes mention of dildos ([[darshildo]] in [[Hindi]]) made from a wide variety of materials, and used by hand, with ties (straps), or in a harness. 

A double-penetration dildo was found in ancient [[France]], but its use is lost to time. 

A 19th-century Chinese painting shows a woman using a dildo strapped to her shoe, showing that creative use of strap-ons was already well under way. 

An 1899 report by [[Michael Haberlandt|Haberlandt]] documented current and historical use of double-ended dildos in [[Zanzibar]], and is one of the few historical documents of this kind. 

It is likely the history of the strap-on parallels the history of the dildo, and given the age of many discoveries, is a rather long history.

==Harnesses==
===Harness types===
The first part of a strap-on setup is the harness, which connects the dildo to the wearer's body, usually in a position similar to that of a male's genitals. A good harness should be sturdy yet comfortable, and is often designed to provide stimulation for the wearer. Many types of harnesses are available, with different features and drawbacks. Some dildos do not need a harness or are built onto one; for these, please see the sections on [[#Dildo types|dildo types]] and [[#Dildo attachment methods|dildo attachment methods]].

====Two-strap====
[[Image:2-strap harness with pink dildo 01.jpg|thumb|right|A two-strap harness]]
A 2-strap harness, in its most basic form, is similar to a [[g-string]]. One strap goes around the wearer's waist, like a belt, while the other goes between the wearer's legs and connects to the other strap in the middle at the lower back. While these are simple, many people find them uncomfortable because the strap rubs against the anus and other areas, and they sometimes do not hold the dildo very firmly, causing it to sag, flop, twist, or squeak.

====Three-strap====
&lt;!-- [[File:4-strap harness with orange dildo 01.jpg|thumb|right|A three-strap harness]] --&gt;
Three-strap harnesses have one strap around the wearer's waist, but instead of one strap between the legs, they have two straps, one around each thigh, rejoining the first strap near the front. This design leaves the genitals and anus uncovered, and attaches the dildo more firmly, giving the wearer more control. Not all people find this design comfortable, and sometimes they are difficult to fit properly, and tend to slip.

====Corsets and other clothing items====
Strap-on harnesses built into various clothing items are available, most often as a [[corset]] or other item of [[lingerie]]. Some are designed to be worn underneath normal clothing for quick use (if done with the dildo in place, either to give the appearance of a penis or to be able to quickly initiate intercourse, this is sometimes called ''[[Packing (phallus)|packing]]''), while others take advantage of the additional strength and sturdiness an item of clothing can provide over a few straps, or just to integrate the strap-on into an erotic outfit.

====Body locations====
Harnesses are not limited to the crotch, and indeed many types are available for other body parts. A popular one is a thigh harness, which attaches a dildo to the wearer's thigh (or other part of the legs or arms, though this is much less common), allowing for many unique positions, as penetration is no longer limited to what could be done with a penis. Another unusual design attaches a dildo to the chin of the wearer, allowing vaginal penetration while performing [[Anal–oral sex|anilingus]] or vice versa. Also, an additional design is a [[Head bondage|gag-style harness]], in which a gag is inserted into the wearer's mouth and a dildo protrudes at the other end.

====Upon objects====
[[Image:ez-rider ball with purple dildo 01.jpg|thumb|right|Inflatable ball with Vac-u-lock plug and attached dildo]]
Harnesses are available to attach dildos to just about any household object, allowing for many creative uses. A dildo could be attached to a chair, bed, or any other item of furniture, and penetrate someone during other activities, with or without a partner. Another item, while not technically a harness, but worth mentioning, is an inflatable ball, usually 9 to 18&amp;nbsp;inches (250 to 500&amp;nbsp;mm) diameter, made of sturdy rubber designed to support the weight of one or two people, with an attachment for a dildo on it. This allows many unique positions, such as double penetration for a woman by lying face down on the ball for vaginal penetration while her partner penetrates her anally doggy style, which is much more effective than a solid object due to the "bounce" of the ball. These inflatable balls are also quite popular for solo use.

===Harness materials===
Harnesses are available in many different materials, and the choice of which to use depends greatly on individual preference.

====Synthetic====
[[Image:Nylon and foam harness 01.jpg|thumb|right|O-ring harness, made with foam and nylon]]
Nylon webbing and soft foam-like synthetic leather are common, relatively affordable, and very durable.  Synthetic harnesses are relatively easy to clean and require relatively little maintenance.  Some, such as the ''Spare Parts'' harness,  are machine-washable.

====Leather====
Leather is comfortable and adjusts to the wearer's body, but still is strong. Leather is harder to clean and requires more work to maintain than other materials.

====Cloth====
Cloth is used mostly for clothing harnesses such as corsets and other lingerie, although is occasionally used by extremely inexpensive harnesses.

====Plastic====
[[Image:clear harness with purple dildo 01.jpg|thumb|right|Clear plastic harness]]
Some harnesses are made with soft plastic, such as flexible [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]]. These are often available in colors besides traditional black, and may be completely transparent (not possible with other materials). They may be less comfortable than other materials, and may be difficult to make fit well, however they are very easy to clean and fairly robust.

====Latex, rubber, PVC====
[[Latex]] harnesses usually cover the entire area, rather than just using straps. They tend to be medium-priced, and have a limited lifespan, especially if used with oil-based lubricants. Latex can require much care, such as special cleaners or shiners to keep it from turning dry and dusty. Latex harnesses may or may not have the dildo(s) molded as part of the harness, and in either case, they tend to be floppy due to the flexibility of the latex. Similar harnesses are also available made of rubber or [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], and are similar to latex harnesses, although PVC tends to be much less flexible and elastic.

==Dildos==

===Dildo types===
The most noticeable feature of any strap-on setup is the [[dildo]] used. A wide variety of dildos are available, and while the choices may be limited by the type of harness in use, generally one can choose from several common types. This section discusses the shape and features of the penetrating end of the dildo, not of the entire dildo or how it's attached, which can be found in the section on [[#Dildo attachment methods|dildo attachment methods]] for the double dildo and strapless dildo.

====Standard====
[[Image:realistic dildo 01.jpg|thumb|right|A standard dildo with crotchless Vac-u-lock harness]]
The standard dildo has a non-tapered or slightly tapered shaft, and often has an enlarged head, similar to a penis. The shaft may be slightly curved, but if it is strongly curved, it is often classified as a g-spot/prostate dildo as well. This type is by far the most popular, both for vaginal and anal use, although some beginners prefer a probe-type dildo. Depending on the type of harness the dildo is meant for, it may have molded testicles as part of the base, which many people say gives more pleasure and helps keep the dildo from "bottoming out." Standard dildos are the most common by a large margin, and are available in virtually any length and width, material, texture, etc.

====Probe====
[[Image:probe dildo 01.jpg|thumb|right|A combination probe and g-spot dildo with a Vac-u-lock harness]]
A probe dildo is often highly tapered, and many resemble a cone in overall shape, or may have a narrow diameter its entire length, although ones resembling an elongated [[butt plug]] are also common, their defining feature being a bulb in the middle which tapers down again towards the harness before flaring wider. These dildos are often advertised as being for beginners, especially newcomers to [[pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]], who may find a narrow, tapered dildo easier to start with if they have never had [[anal sex|anal penetration]] before. Many people find that once they are familiar with the activity, the probe dildos are inadequate and unsatisfying, and purchase a standard dildo to use with their harness. Due to this, many kits include both a probe dildo and a standard dildo, so it is not necessary to purchase another.

====G-spot and prostate====
Dildos designed for [[g-spot]] or [[prostate]] stimulation often have a sharp upwards curve at the head, or gradual but still strong curvature the entire length. When used in many sexual positions, the curve causes strong pressure against the g-spot in women or the prostate in men. Some men report that strong prostate stimulation is important for an [[Orgasm#Anal and nipple stimulation in males and females|anal orgasm]], while others report it as a distraction rather than a help. When using one of these dildos for the first time, care should be taken at first to make sure it's comfortable for the receiver, as the strong bend can be difficult to insert or control. For many positions, such as [[doggy style]], the curved tip should point downwards, as otherwise it points in the wrong direction for either g-spot or prostate stimulation.

====Textured====
[[Image:Double dildo simple end 01.jpg|thumb|right|End of textured double dildo]]
For added stimulation, many dildos for harness use are manufactured with bulbs along their length, or having ripples, bumps, or other shapes on the surface to increase the stimulation given to the receiver. A bulbous dildo causes repeated expansion of the vaginal opening when used for vaginal penetration or of the anus when used for anal penetration, and causes a unique pulsating effect and additional stimulation. Ripples along the length of the dildo increase friction and cause a washboard effect, which some people find increases their pleasure, while others find tend to cause numbness. Individual bumps or a water droplet texture on the shaft also causes extra stimulation, and often avoids the washboard effect of evenly spaced ripples. Some dildos modeled to be realistic penises contain very heavy [[vein]] textures on the surface, causing a similar effect.

==== Vibrating and rotating====
[[Image:Stephswift dildo closeup 01.jpg|thumb|right|Multi-function dildo with rotating beads and vibrating egg]]
Some dildos, especially recent ones, may have rotating beads along the shaft, a wiggling shaft, vibrating ticklers or other clitoral stimulation devices, or other features to give more pleasure to the user. While their effectiveness is a matter of opinion, they are becoming increasingly popular. An inexpensive design is basically a standard [[rabbit vibrator]] designed for harness use (often exactly the same toy with a slightly different base), while more expensive dildos are designed from the ground-up for harness use and are usually superior. Rotating beads provide extra stimulation of the [[vulva]] and vaginal opening when used for vaginal penetration or stimulation of the [[anus]] when used for anal penetration, while the various clitoral stimulation devices are generally intended only for vaginal intercourse. These dildos are often bulky or heavy, and like all other vibrators need a power source (usually batteries in a pack that clips onto the harness or slips into a pocket on it), but can provide additional stimulation for those who desire it.

====Double penetration====
[[Double penetration dildo]]s are generally two dildos molded onto a common base, designed for simultaneous vaginal and anal penetration or simultaneous vaginal and vaginal penetration, not to be confused with a man using a strap-on along with his penis for double penetration, which is discussed below. A typical double-penetration dildo has a longer, thicker main shaft for vaginal penetration, and a shorter, thinner, often more curved shaft for anal penetration. Although rare, dildos with the anal shaft being equally as large as the vaginal shaft are available for women who find a larger anal dildo more satisfying. These dildos tend to greatly limit the possible positions they are used in, as the angle has to be right for both vaginal and anal penetration when thrusting, however they can provide a unique experience for couples to try.

====Specialty functions====
[[Image:inflatable enema nozzle in harness 01.jpg|thumb|right|Inflatable enema nozzle]]
Many specialty dildos are available, such as ones that expand when an attached inflator bulb is squeezed, simulate [[ejaculation]] by releasing warm water on demand when a reservoir is compressed, or function as [[enema]] nozzles, allowing an enema to be given while using the strap-on for anal intercourse. Inflatable dildos generally expand in girth when inflated (they usually come with a simple hand-squeeze inflator bulb), allowing the dildo to keep expanding during intercourse as the receiver slowly stretches, giving a unique completely filled feeling which is hard to obtain using normal dildos. Ejaculating dildos contain a squeeze bulb or other reservoir, which when filled with hot water beforehand, allows the wearer to "come" into the receiver at the proper moment. Enema nozzle dildos contain tubing connections, and when used for anal penetration (most often with silicone [[sexual lubricant|lube]], as water-soluble lube would quickly break down when combined with an enema) allow the receiver to receive an enema during intercourse. Some [[BDSM]] mistresses specialize in offering this service. A relatively new product in this field is dildos with electrodes for [[erotic electrostimulation]], further increasing the range of sensations the receiver can experience.

====Penis extensions====
Hollow dildos are often sold as penis extensions to increase size (length and/or girth), but the most common use is for men with [[erectile dysfunction]]. The penis is inserted into the hollow inside of the dildo, then the harness is put on, allowing the man to penetrate his partner with the dildo, the thrusting of which is transferred to his penis.

==== Foreskin ====
Dildos with retractable [[Foreskin|foreskins]] or [[uncircumcised]] dildos are to try to give a natural feel. They can often have fake veins in order to enhance this feel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bettystoybox.com/collections/uncut-dildos|title=35 Amazing Uncut / Uncircumcised Dildos (with retracting Foreskin)|last=Box|first=Betty's Toy|website=Betty's Toy Box|language=en|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lovehoney.co.uk/product.cfm?p=37303|title=Lovehoney|last=|first=|date=|website=www.lovehoney.co.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dildo attachment methods===
The principal feature of any strap-on setup is the attachment—the dildo used to penetrate the other partner. While there's a huge array of different dildos available, most are attached to the harness in one of several ways. All methods have tradeoffs, and many couples will have different harnesses depending on which type of dildo they want to use.

====Ring and wide base====
[[Image:O-ring harness with pink dildo 01.jpg|thumb|right|O-ring harness with wide-base dildo]]
The most common means of holding the dildo to the harness is to have an opening or ring in the harness through which a wide-based dildo is inserted. Inexpensive harnesses tend to just have a round hole in the fabric or [[leather]], while more expensive ones will use a steel or rubber ring. The advantage of this method is that dildos which fit are widely available and inexpensive, and even many dildos not meant for harness use will work in one of these harnesses, such as most dildos with testicles. The major disadvantage is the dildo is often held loosely (especially on cheap harnesses) and tends to flop downwards, and the dildo often can rotate in the harness, making it difficult or impossible to use [[g-spot]] or other shaped dildos.

====Vacuum seal====
[[Image:Vac-u-lock plug 01.jpg|thumb|right|Vac-u-lock plug and powder lubricant]]
Used primarily by [[Doc Johnson]], Vac-u-lock dildos have a rippled hollow in their base, which fits onto a matching plug on the harness or other toy. Powdered lubricant is used on the plug to facilitate removal.  The advantage of this design is the dildo is firmly attached and can not easily rotate, and does not tend to flop downwards or slip like ring harnesses, as well as there being a wide variety of other devices the dildos can be attached to, such as handles and inflatable balls. The disadvantage is the relatively low availability and high cost of compatible attachments. A number of brands have non-compatible clones of the vac-u-lock system, but dildos and accessories for them are virtually unavailable.

====Strapless====
A recent design is a strapless strap-on, designed to be held in a [[vagina]] or [[anus]] with an [[oval (geometry)|egg]]-shaped bulb and thus not to require the use of a harness. This differs from a [[double dildo]] where both ends are phallic and a harness is required. The [[Feeldoe]] is a strapless dildo which was patented by [[Melissa Mia Kain]] in 1997. Advantages of this design are that it can be used spontaneously, that it provides deep internal thrusting to both partners, and that the lack of harness makes it more comfortable. Disadvantages are that the eggs do not prevent rotation or droop, leading to a reduced amount of control unless a harness is employed anyway; a requirement for strong muscles; and the practice needed to become familiar with its use. Many strapless strap ons can also be used with a harness when partners want to increase control. Not all harnesses are suitable for strapless strap ons. It is highly recommended that you use a strap on with very adjustable O-ring or a two-hole harness.&lt;ref name="Strapless"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bestdildo.net/a-strap-on-for-a-feeldoe/ |title=A Strap-on For a Feeldoe |accessdate=2010-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705193553/http://bestdildo.net/a-strap-on-for-a-feeldoe/ |archivedate=2015-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Double penetration====
[[Image:Double dildo overview 01.jpg|thumb|right|Double dildo with digital controls]]
A [[double dildo]] can be used with or without a harness, although most provide no means of using them with a harness. A double dildo, as its name implies, is a dildo in which both ends are designed for insertion, and often is 18 inches (450&amp;nbsp;mm) or more long. While special ones meant for use with a harness do exist, a normal double dildo is straight, is rarely at a comfortable angle for intercourse, and jabs into the [[cervix]] of a woman using one. However, double dildos can be used for a variety of creative positions for which a harness would be awkward, such as both partners in [[doggy style]] positions or sitting facing each other.

====One-piece latex====
Some harnesses and dildos are made of a single piece of molded latex, with the dildo permanently built into the front. These are often inexpensive, shoddy products, although higher quality ones are available. The advantages are simple use and an appearance some people find erotic, but this is often outweighed by the inability to use a different dildo, the often weak, floppy nature of the dildo, the inability to adjust to a given person for a comfortable fit, and their relatively short lifespan.

====Molded straps====
[[Image:Orange 1-strap dildo 01.jpg|thumb|right|Inexpensive dildo with molded snaps]]
Some very cheap "strap-on dildos" have straps or attachments for straps directly molded into the material of the dildo. This design is very flimsy, and is only used on the cheapest products. They are essentially useless for the traditional purpose of a strap-on dildo (one partner penetrating another using a dildo in a position similar to a penis), but can be strapped around chairs and other objects for a variety of other activities.

==Methods of stimulation for the wearer==
Pleasure for the wearer of the strap-on generally comes from pressure against the genitals, particularly the clitoris, during use and from psychological arousal. Many designs of strap-on have various features to increase the stimulation of the wearer.

Some harnesses intentionally leave the genital area and anus open (either intentionally with an opening in the material or by the design simply not having any straps that would cover it), which allows any toy to be used for the stimulation of the wearer, or even for the wearer to be penetrated while wearing the strap-on. This can often be useful when the partners wish to switch roles during their play, as the strap-on can be put on before hand without interfering or needing to be taken off for play to continue. This type of harness is ill-suited for using toys, however, as the harness would not touch the toys, both preventing them from falling out while thrusting and not providing movement to them from the harness.

===External stimulation===

====Built-in features====
[[Image:Stephswift egg closeup 01.jpg|thumb|right|Jelly-coated vibrating egg]]
Some harnesses and dildos provide raised bumps or other features designed to rub against the clitoris of the wearer, either attached to the inside of the harness, or on the back of the base of the dildo. Harnesses that work with such dildos have to have an open back, where the base of the dildo presses directly against the user's body. As high-quality harnesses usually have padding or other means of attaching the dildo to the harness than a simple opening, these features are usually only seen on low-quality, inexpensive dildos. They provide only limited stimulation, and while better than nothing, are usually considered inferior to other types.

====Vibrators====
Another means of providing stimulation to the wearer is a vibrating egg, "clit blaster", vibrating gel pads or whiskers, or other device mounted on the inside of the strapon. These are almost always intended for use by people with vulva, as the external vibrator is rarely positioned well nor provides stimulation for a penis. These devices provide external stimulation to the clitoris, vagina, and other parts of the vulva, but do not provide any penetrative stimulation or anal stimulation.

===Internal stimulation===

====Double-ended attachments====
While a double dildo obviously would provide stimulation to the wearer as well, the standard straight dildo is very poorly suited for harness use. To overcome this, many dildos are available for harness use that have an offset in the middle, with the main attachment and a smaller vaginal attachment for the wearer having a flat vertical section between them. This way, the main attachment is at a good angle and position for thrusting, while its movement is transmitted directly to the vaginal plug and clitoris of the wearer.

=====Double-ended/sided hands and strap free dildos=====
The latest technological achievement is totally new kind of strapless strap on. A special example of these are [[Feeldoe]], Sysil, Super Strapless Silicone Dildo, Share, Nexus Maximus and Transfer, which has an egg shaped bulb designed to be inserted into the vagina or anus of the wearer. Due to the shape of the dildo, thrusting on the main dildo translates to lateral movement of the plug, providing great stimulation to the wearer. Additionally, the shape of the plug allows it to be used without a harness in many instances. It can also allow a man to perform a double penetration (actually doing anal while the dildo penetrate the vagina) while being anal-plugged himself, all with only a single toy.

====Internal plugs====
[[Image:Dual internal plug harness 01.jpg|thumb|right|Strap-on harness with dual internal plugs]]
Many of the "professional" harnesses have one or two plugs (vaginal, anal, or both) on the inside of the harness, to penetrate the wearer. These plugs (may be shaped either like small dildos, the standard butt plug shape, or a combination/hybrid thereof) are usually firmly attached to the harness, and provide stimulation to the wearer as they thrust with the main dildo. Some harnesses may only come with the anal plug while others come with both plugs; most report the latter provides the more pleasure than using one.

While a plug can be used in combination with most any harness, just by inserting the plugs before putting on the harness, all the harness tends to do is push the plugs in, and not move them as to provide stimulation when the wearer thrusts. Depending on the type of harness, different ways are used to properly attach plugs to the harness. A common type consists of an opening or rubber ring with a cloth or leather back, similar to what might be used to hold the main dildo to the front of the harness, but positioned over the anus, vagina, or ones for both. A dildo/plug with a wide base is inserted through the ring, then when the harness is put on, the material pulls tight against it, holding it firm. For vac-u-lock harnesses, one or two additional vac-u-lock plugs are mounted on the inside of the harness, allowing any vac-u-lock attachment to be used. Most vac-u-lock harnesses that have the connectors for internal plugs come with two plug-shaped vac-u-lock attachments, a smaller one for anal use and a larger one for vaginal use. Like other types of harnesses, both plugs may be used at once, and often are separately adjustable on the strap to fit the wearer's body.

==Sexual positions==
{{See also|List of sex positions}}
[[Image:Wiki-pegging.png|thumb|right|A woman pegging a man doggy-style with a 4-strap harness and dildo]]

A number of positions can be performed using a strap-on dildo. These include:

*'''Doggy style''': [[Doggy style]] is popular as it is simple, easy, and allows deep thrusting. The receptive partner kneels down with his or her face against the bed (or other surface), and is penetrated from behind. This position works well for both vaginal and anal penetration, and allows deep, smooth strokes, however it sometimes stimulates the prostate less than other positions during [[Pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]].
*'''Missionary''': The [[missionary position]] is also popular, and allows both partners to cuddle, see each other, kiss, or perform other activities during intercourse. When used for anal penetration, a pillow or other object placed under the buttocks of the receiver will elevate the anus to a comfortable position and angle.
*'''Bent over''': Usually used for [[Pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]], the man stands or kneels while leaning forwards, supported by the bed, chair, wall, or other object. Similar to doggy style, he is then penetrated from behind. This position angles the dildo such that it typically strokes firmly across his prostate, and for some men can lead to an anal orgasm much more effectively.

==Common uses==
Even more than the different types of harnesses and dildos, there are different ways to make use of a strap-on setup. Generally ways of using them can be divided into several broad categories, however there are infinite variations.

*'''Pegging''': Is when a woman uses a strap-on dildo to penetrate a man anally.
*'''Sex between women''': Female, same-sex intercourse is one of the more common uses of strapons. Strap-ons are one means for women to enjoy penetration with their sex partner.
*'''Erectile dysfunction''': Men with [[erectile dysfunction]] may use a strap-on to be able to penetrate their partner either by using one with a hollow dildo, or by having their penis beneath the dildo. For example, in one documented case, a [[prostate cancer]] patient with erectile dysfunction due to anti-cancer [[androgen deprivation therapy]] would penetrate his partner with the dildo while she manually stimulated his penis. The report includes a narrative by the patient of his experience where he writes that although he and his partner were initially reluctant, they became highly satisfied, beyond their previous sexual experience as a couple: He found more comfortable without the worry of whether he would be able to keep an erection, and experienced [[multiple orgasms]], felt more diffuse and spreading from his pelvis. His partner reliably achieved orgasm, whereas previously she didn't have orgasms by penetration alone.&lt;ref name="Warkentin 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Restoration of Satisfying Sex for a Castrated Cancer Patient with Complete Impotence: A Case Study |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6830068_Restoration_of_Satisfying_Sex_for_a_Castrated_Cancer_Patient_with_Complete_Impotence_A_Case_Study |last1=Warkentin |first1=Karen |last2=Gray |first2=Ross E. |last3=Wassersug |first3=Richard |year=2006 |journal=J.

*'''Double penetration''': Some women find simultaneous vaginal and anal penetration to be enjoyable, and aside from using a double-penetration dildo discussed previously, can experience this with a male partner using a strap-on. A harness is selected that allows the man's penis to extend under the dildo of the harness, thereby allowing him to insert both his penis and the dildo into his partner. In a face-to-face position (such as the [[missionary position]]) the penis would penetrate the anus and the dildo the vagina; in a position such as doggy style the penis would penetrate the vagina and the dildo the anus.
*'''Masturbation''': Non-traditional harnesses, such as furniture attachments and ride-on balls, can be used for [[masturbation]] by both men and women. A ride-on ball can take the position of another person, in that it can be on bottom for most positions that have the person being penetrated on top, and furniture harnesses can be attached to many objects, an example being a [[bathtub]], to penetrate the user doggy-style before or in a bath.
*'''Transsexual people''': Some [[transsexual]] people use a strap-on to provide the function of a penis, for example an [[transman|FTM]], as he was not originally born with one. This option may appeal to people who have not undergone surgery, for any one of many reasons. Strap-ons may also be used by [[Trans woman|MTF]] transsexuals, who are either genitally post-operative or not using their own phallus.
*'''Premature ejaculation''': In couples where a male partner suffers from [[premature ejaculation]], a strap-on can be used to prolong penetrative sex in order to sexually satisfy the other partner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thegrittywoman.com/beginners-guide-purchasing-your-first-strap-on-harness/ Beginners Guide: Purchasing Your First Strap-On Harness | Gritty Woman]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2017/06/02/25185409/savage-love-letter-of-the-day-hes-perfect-but-a-premie Savage Love Letter of the Day: He's Perfect, But a Premie - Slog - The Stranger]&lt;/ref&gt; This practice may feel more personal and satisfying than other types of [[non-penetrative sex]] since [[pelvic thrust]]ing is involved, and the pace is set by the male partner experiencing the premature ejaculation. The strap-on can be in a size similar to the wearer, or the couple can experiment with other sizes or shapes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.purepleasureshop.com/blogs/ask-amy/15152581-rose-answers-premature-ejaculation-101 Rose Answers: Premature Ejaculation 101 – Pure Pleasure Shop]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Orgasm Denial''': Some couples who practice [[BDSM]] use a strap-on to allow penetrative vaginal sex while denying the male partner the ability to orgasm as a form of [[erotic sexual denial]]. This is distinct from pegging, as the strap-on in this case replaces the penis of the male. In addition to wearing the strap-on, the male may also sometimes wear a [[Chastity belt (BDSM)|chastity belt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tickleberry.co.uk/male-chastity/dildo-harnesses-for-men/ Male Dildo Harness - A guide for Men how to wear a strap-on]&lt;/ref&gt; The strap-on can substitute the penis either as a form of foreplay, or for the complete duration of the intercouse.
*'''Fellatio''': Many people, using a strap-on for any of the above purposes, often like to either suck or have a partner suck a strap-on, performing [[fellatio]] on it. The reasons given vary; possible reasons include power or role reversal. If complemented with erotic stimulation (e.g.: manual stimulation of the penis or the clitoris) and the receiving partner is willing to engage in [[suspension of disbelief]], this can give the illusion to the wearer of the sensation of having an own penis stimulated, similar to the [[rubber hand illusion]]. In the narrative of the prostate cancer patient (see above), he reported receiving oral sex with the dildo and apparently found it satisfying, again after being initially reluctant of the idea.{{r|Warkentin 2006}}

Almost every position associated with sexual intercourse (or not, in the case of simultaneous penetration) can be performed with a strap-on. Indeed, with other harnesses that allow a dildo to be mounted on inanimate objects, endless new positions can be conceived.

A '''stuck-at fault''' is a particular [[fault model]] used by fault simulators and [[automatic test pattern generation]] (ATPG) tools to mimic a manufacturing defect within an [[integrated circuit]]. Individual signals and pins are assumed to be ''stuck'' at Logical '1', '0' and 'X'.  For example, an input is tied to a logical 1 state during test generation to assure that a manufacturing defect with that type of behavior can be found with a specific test pattern. Likewise the input could be tied to a logical 0 to model the behavior of a defective circuit that cannot switch its output pin.
Not all faults can be analyzed using the stuck-at fault model. Compensation for static hazards, namely branching signals, can render a circuit untestable using this model.  Also, redundant circuits cannot be tested using this model, since by design there is no change in any output as a result of a single fault.

== Single stuck at line ==

'''Single stuck line''' is a [[fault model]] used in [[digital circuits]]. It is used for post manufacturing testing, not design testing. The model assumes one line or node in the digital circuit is stuck at logic high or logic low. When a line is stuck it is called a fault.

Digital circuits can be divided into:
# Gate level or combinational circuits which contain no storage (latches and/or flip flops) but only gates like [[Negated AND gate|NAND]], [[OR gate|OR]], [[XOR gate|XOR]], etc.
# Sequential circuits which contain storage.

This fault model applies to gate level circuits, or a block of a sequential circuit which can be separated from the storage elements.
Ideally a gate-level circuit would be completely tested by applying all possible inputs and checking that they gave the right outputs, but this is completely impractical: an adder to add two 32-bit numbers would require 2&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.8*10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; tests, taking 58 years at 0.1 ns/test.
The ''stuck at'' fault model assumes that only one input on one gate will be faulty at a time, assuming that if more are faulty, a test that can detect any single fault, should easily find multiple faults.

To use this fault model, each input pin on each gate in turn, is assumed to be grounded, and a ''test vector'' is developed to indicate the circuit is faulty. The test vector is a collection of bits to apply to the circuit's inputs, and a collection of bits expected at the circuit's output. If the gate pin under consideration is grounded, and this test vector is applied to the circuit, at least one of the output bits will not agree with the corresponding output bit in the test vector. After obtaining the test vectors for grounded pins, each pin is connected in turn to a logic one and another set of test vectors is used to find faults occurring under these conditions. Each of these faults is called a single ''stuck-at-0'' or a single ''stuck-at-1'' fault, respectively.

This model worked so well for transistor-transistor logic ([[Transistor–transistor logic|TTL]]), which was the logic of choice during the 1970s and 1980s, that manufacturers advertised how well they tested their circuits by a number called "stuck-at [[fault coverage]]", which represented the percentage of all possible stuck-at faults that their testing process could find.
While the same testing model works moderately well for [[CMOS]], it is not able to detect all possible CMOS faults. This is because CMOS may experience a failure mode known as a ''stuck-open'' fault, which cannot be reliably detected with one test vector and requires that two vectors be applied sequentially. The model also fails to detect bridging faults between adjacent signal lines, occurring in pins that drive bus connections and array structures. Nevertheless, the concept of single stuck-at faults is widely used, and with some additional tests has allowed industry to ship an acceptable low number of bad circuits.

The testing based on this model is aided by several things:
# A test developed for a single stuck-at fault often finds a large number of other stuck-at faults.
# A series of tests for stuck-at faults will often, purely by [[serendipity]], find a large number of other faults, such as stuck-open faults. This is sometimes called "windfall" fault coverage.
#  Another type of testing called ''[[Iddq testing|IDDQ testing]]'' measures the way the power supply current of a CMOS integrated circuit changes when a small number of slowly changing test vectors are applied. Since CMOS draws a very low current when its inputs are static, any increase in that current indicates a potential problem.

Chemical changes can be written very quickly through rapid probe scanning, since no mass is transferred from the tip to the surface, and writing speed is limited only by the heat transfer rate{{Citation needed|date = May 2015}}. TCNL was invented in 2007 by a group at the Georgia Institute of Technology.&lt;ref name="TCNL-NL2" /&gt; Riedo and collaborators demonstrated that TCNL can produce local chemical changes with feature sizes down to 12&amp;nbsp;nm at scan speeds up to 1&amp;nbsp;mm/s.&lt;ref name="TCNL-NL2" /&gt;

TCNL was used in 2013 to create a nano-scale replica of the [[Mona Lisa]] "painted" with different probe tip temperatures.

== Technique ==
The [[Atomic force microscopy|AFM]] thermal cantilevers are generally made from a silicon wafers using traditional [[Bulk micromachining|bulk]] and [[Surface micromachining|surface]] micro-machining processes. Through the application of an electric [[Electric current|current]] through its highly [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] [[silicon]] wings, [[Joule heating|resistive heating]] occurs at the light doping zone around the probe tip, where the largest fraction of the heat is dissipated. The tip is able to change its temperature very quickly due to its small volume; an average tip in contact with [[polycarbonate]] has a time constant of 0.35&amp;nbsp;ms.{{Citation needed|date = May 2015}} The tips can be cycled between ambient temperature and 1100&amp;nbsp;°C at up to 10&amp;nbsp;MHz{{Citation needed|date = May 2015}} while the distance of the tip from the surface and the tip temperature can be controlled independently.

== Comparison with other lithographic techniques ==
''Thermo-mechanical'' scanning probe lithography relies on the application of heat and force order to create indentations for patterning purposes (see also: [[Millipede memory]]). [[Thermal probe lithography|''Thermal scanning probe lithography'']] (t-SPL) specializes on removing material from a substrate without the intent of chemically altering the created topography. [[Local oxidation nanolithography]] relies on [[Redox|oxidation reactions]] in a water [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] around the probe tip.

'''Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center (TBRC)''' is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to seeking out, preserving, organizing, and disseminating [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] texts and [[Tibetan literature]]. Founded in 1999 by [[E. Gene Smith]], TBRC is located in [[Cambridge, MA|Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and hosts a digital library of the largest collection of digitized Tibetan texts in the world.&lt;ref name="Economist obituary"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary- Gene Smith|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17899572/|publisher=The Economist | date=January 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TBRC's [[Harvard Square]] headquarters facilitates its ongoing cooperative relationships with [[Harvard University]]. TBRC also has international offices in [[New Delhi|New Delhi, India]] and [[Kathmandu|Kathmandu, Nepal]], and a newly opened scanning and text-preservation center located within the E. Gene Smith Library at [[Southwest University for Nationalities]] in [[Chengdu|Chengdu, China]].&lt;ref name="Jacobs"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jacobs|first=Andrew|title=After Winding Odyssey, Tibetan Texts Find Home in China|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/world/asia/after-winding-odyssey-tibetan-texts-find-home-in-china.html|publisher=New York Times|date=February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==

To preserve and share the Tibetan literary heritage through the union of technology and scholarship.

== History ==
[[File:Traditional Tibetan Texts.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Traditional Tibetan Texts]]
In the early 1960s, while working on his PhD. at the [[University of Washington]], [[E. Gene Smith]] studied with the Venerable [[Dezhung Rinpoche]]. In 1964, Dezhung Rinpoche encouraged Smith to move to India in order to seek out and study Tibetan books more directly. He gave Smith letters of introduction to show to the lamas living among the [[Tibetan diaspora]].&lt;ref name="Patron Kings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Patron Kings Part IX: Gene Smith and TBRC|url=http://khyentsefoundation.org/2010/12/part-ix-gene-smith-and-tbrc/|publisher=Khyentse Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968 the [[U.S. Library of Congress]] hired Smith as a field director in [[New Delhi]] where he worked on the Food for Peace humanitarian effort [[Public Law 480]]. Through the program, Smith began to copy and print thousands of Tibetan texts while keeping a version of each one for his own collection. He moved from India to Indonesia in 1985 and then Egypt, along with his collection of 12,000 volumes of texts.&lt;ref name="Patron Kings"/&gt;

In 1997 Smith retired from the Library of Congress and began working to implement his vision of making the preserved texts accessible using the new scanning and digitization technologies that were, at that time, just beginning to become available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Noa|title=Take Note|url=http://www.tricycle.com/-life/take-note|publisher=Tricycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 with friends including [[Harvard University|Harvard]] professor and fellow [[Tibetology|Tibetologist]] [[Leonard van der Kuijp]], he founded the '''Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center''' in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Smith's texts from India that were digitized at TBRC became the foundation for Tibetan studies in the United States.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|title=Religion Journal; War Resister Becomes Savior of Tibet's Literature|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/15/nyregion/religion-journal-war-resister-becomes-savior-of-tibet-s-literature.html?src=pm/|last=Stewart|first=Barbara|publisher=New York Times|date=June 15, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 with the support of Shelley and Donald Rubin, TBRC moved to [[New York City]] where Smith became an advisor to the [[Rubin Museum of Art]].  Major grants from the Patricia and Peter Gruber Foundation, Khyentse Foundation, and the Shelley and Donald Rubin Foundation allowed TBRC to acquire a significant number of texts, develop its archiving system, and add more professional staff. Starting as Technical Director in 2001, Jeff Wallman was personally selected by Smith to be Executive Director and was appointed by the Board of Directors in 2009.&lt;ref name="Spotlight"/&gt;

Gene Smith died on December 16, 2010. TBRC had scanned 7 million pages of Tibetan texts at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="Economist obituary"/&gt;

== TBRC's Work ==
[[File:Tibetan texts and a planetary book scanner; microfilm scanner on the bottom.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Tibetan texts on a planetary book scanner next to a  microfilm scanner]]
TBRC seeks out and preserves undiscovered texts, organizes them into a library catalog system, and disseminates the library online and to remote locations on hard drives so anyone can read, print, or share the texts. Tibetan language texts are cataloged by work, genre, subject, person, and place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center Digital Library|url=http://library.hds.harvard.edu/key-e-resources/tibetan-buddhist-resource-center-digital-library|publisher=Andover-Harvard Theological Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the collection contains more than 7,000 works (17,000 volumes, totaling nearly 9 million pages) of Tibetan texts.&lt;ref name="Suber"&gt;{{cite web|title=Suber and Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center Collaborate to Provide Open Access to Tibetan Literature|url=http://library.harvard.edu/08192013-1108/suber-and-tibetan-buddhist-resource-center-collaborate-provide-open-access-tibetan/|publisher=Harvard Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars and students are able to study the physical qualities of the texts since the scans are searchable and zoomable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knafl|first=Anne|title=Library purchases access to important digitized Tibetan texts|url=http://news.lib.uchicago.edu/blog/2013/06/06/library-purchases-access-to-important-digitized-tibetan-texts/|publisher=University of Chicago Library News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 5,000 users from 66 countries currently access the website per day, up from 815 per day in 2006. Between 500,000 and 1,000,000 pages are added every year.&lt;ref name="Spotlight"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spotlight on the Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center|url=http://khyentsefoundation.org/2010/02/spotlight-on-the-tibetan-buddhist-resource-center|publisher=Khyentse Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TBRC's work was recognized by the [[Orgyen Trinley Dorje|17th Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje]] in a letter offering his support, gratitude, and prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Elizabeth|title=BIFF 2013: Find, save, copy, paste 'Digital Dharma' tells of one scholar’s work to save thousands of Tibetan texts|url=http://www.boulderweekly.com/article-10645-biff-2013-find-save-copy-paste.html/|publisher=Boulder Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gene Smith's life and TBRC were the subject of the 2012 [[documentary]] [[Digital Dharma]], directed by Dafna Yachin of Lunchbox Communications. [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] film critic John Anderson described the film as, "A divinely inspired gift... also an affectionate tribute to the late E. Gene Smith, the scholar, librarian and ex-Mormon who waged a 50-year struggle to save the endangered texts of Tibetan Buddhism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=John|title=Review: "Digital Dharma"|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/reviews/digital-dharma-1117948104/|publisher=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== TBRC and Harvard ==
In summer 2012 TBRC relocated back to [[Harvard Square]] in Cambridge, MA, where the staff hand-picked by Smith continues its ongoing mission to preserve and provide access to Tibetan literature.

In cooperation with the Harvard University Open Access Project (HOAP), TBRC is currently working to make its entire library completely open access.&lt;ref name="Suber"/&gt; TBRC also coordinates internships with graduate students from [[Harvard Divinity School]] and the Department of South Asian Studies at Harvard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center moves US office to Cambridge, MA|url=http://shambhalasun.com/news/?p=34921|publisher=Buddhadharma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scanning and Text-Preservation in China ==
In 2007, Gene Smith bequeathed his personal collection of 12,000 Tibetan texts to the [[Southwest University for Nationalities]] in [[Chengdu|Chengdu, China]]. These texts are now housed in a newly constructed library that bears Smith's name, and which is now China's pre-eminent center for Tibetan literature.&lt;ref name="Jacobs"/&gt;

In October 2013, TBRC opened a scanning and text-preservation center at SWUN's E. Gene Smith Library, where four full-time archivists scan, catalog, and digitize Tibetan manuscripts, some centuries old, that are being brought to the library from around the region as news of its existence spreads. Some of these recent additions, now preserved and accessible in TBRC's digital archive, represent the only known versions of ancient texts.&lt;ref name="Jacobs"/&gt;

==Buddhist Digital Resource Center==
TBRC announced the expansion of institutional mission to include the preservation of texts in languages beyond Tibetan, including Sanskrit, Pali and Chinese. To reflect this expansion, they have officially changed organizational name from Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center (TBRC) to [[Buddhist Digital Resource Center]] (BDRC). In 2017, BDRC will begin preserving and making accessible texts in languages beyond Tibetan, starting with Pali, Sanskrit, and Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tbrc.org/?locale=bo#!footer/news/20170210 Introducing Buddhist Digital Resource Center (BDRC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turbine inlet air cooling''' is a group of technologies and techniques consisting of cooling down the intake air of the [[gas turbine]]. The direct consequence of cooling the turbine inlet air is power output augmentation. It may also improve the energy efficiency of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TURBINEINLET COOLING ASSOCIATION |url=http://www.turbineinletcooling.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology is widely used in hot climates with high ambient temperatures that usually coincides with on-peak demand period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ESTIMATION OF ELECTRICITY DEMAND FOR REMOTE AREA POWER SUPPLY SYSTEMS INCLUDING WATER DESALINATION AND DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT MODELS |url=http://itee.uq.edu.au/~aupec/aupec02/Final-Papers/Ali-Al-Alawi1.pdf |publisher= Centre for Renewable Energy and Sustainable Technologies Australia |author1=Ali Al-Alawi  |author2=Syed Islam  |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==

[[File:Gas Turbine power output according turbine inlet air cooling (TIAC) technology.png|thumbnail|Effect of inlet air cooling on power output]][[Gas turbine]]s take in filtered, fresh ambient air and compress it in the  compressor stage. The compressed air is mixed with fuel in the combustion chamber and ignited. This produces a high-temperature and high-pressure flow of exhaust gases that enter in a turbine and produce the shaft work output that is generally used to turn an electric generator as well as powering the compressor stage.
As the gas turbine is a constant volume machine, the air [[volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] introduced in the combustion chamber after the compression stage is fixed for a given shaft speed (rpm). Thus the air mass flow in is directly related to the [[density of air]], and the introduced volume.
:&lt;math&gt; 
{m} = {\rho}{V} &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density and &lt;math&gt;{V}&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the gas. As the volume &lt;math&gt;{V}&lt;/math&gt; is fixed, only density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; of the air can be modified to vary air mass. The density of the air depends of the [[relative humidity]], [[Atmospheric pressure|altitude]], [[pressure drop]] and temperature.

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho_{\,\mathrm{humid~air}} = \frac{p_{d}}{R_{d} T} + \frac{p_{v}}{R_{v} T} = \frac{p_{d}M_{d}+p_{v}M_{v}}{R T} \,
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=wahiduddin&gt;[http://wahiduddin.net/calc/density_altitude.htm Equations - Air Density and Density Altitude&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_{\,\mathrm{humid~air}} =&lt;/math&gt; Density of the humid air (kg/m³)
:&lt;math&gt;p_{d} =&lt;/math&gt; Partial pressure of dry air (Pa)
:&lt;math&gt;R_{d} =&lt;/math&gt; Specific gas constant for dry air, 287.058 J/(kg·K)
:&lt;math&gt;T =&lt;/math&gt; Temperature (K)
:&lt;math&gt;p_{v} =&lt;/math&gt; Pressure of water vapor (Pa)
:&lt;math&gt;R_{v} =&lt;/math&gt; Specific gas constant for water vapor, 461.495 J/(kg·K)
:&lt;math&gt;M_{d} =&lt;/math&gt; Molar mass of dry air, 0.028964 (kg/mol)
:&lt;math&gt;M_{v} =&lt;/math&gt; Molar mass of water vapor, 0.018016 (kg/mol)
:&lt;math&gt;R =&lt;/math&gt; [[Gas constant|Universal gas constant]], 8.314 J/(K·mol)

The performance of a gas turbine, its efficiency ([[Heat rate (efficiency)|heat rate]]) and the generated power output strongly depend on the climate conditions, which may decrease the output power ratings by up to 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Inlet Air Cooling |author= GE |url=http://site.ge-energy.com/businesses/ge_oilandgas/en/literature/en/downloads/inletair_cooling.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applied technologies ==
[[File:Turbine Inlet Air Cooling Filter-house modification.png|thumbnail|Filter-house modified to place the heat exchanger after the filtering stage.]]
Different technologies are available in the market. Each particular technology has its advantages and inconveniences according to different factors such as ambient conditions, investment cost and payback time, power output increase and cooling capacity.

=== Fogging ===

Inlet air fogging consists of spraying finely atomized water (fog) into the inlet airflow of a gas turbine engine. The water droplets evaporate quickly, which cools the air and increases the power output of the turbine.

Demineralized water is typically pressurized to 2000 psi (138 bar) then injected into the inlet air duct through an array of stainless steel fog nozzles. Demineralized water is used in order to prevent fouling of the compressor blades that would occur if water with mineral content were evaporated in the airflow. Fog systems typically produce a water spray, with about 90% of the water flow being in droplets that are 20 microns in diameter or smaller.&lt;ref&gt;C. Meher-Homji, T. Mee, 2000. “Gas Turbine Power Augmentation by Fogging of Inlet Air.” Proceedings of the 28th turbomachinery Symposium (2000), Texas A &amp; M. [http://turbolab.tamu.edu/proc/turboproc/T28/Vol28010.pdf Turbolab]&lt;/ref&gt;

Inlet fogging has been in commercial use since the late 1980s and is a popular retrofit technology. As of 2015, there were more than 1000 inlet fog systems installed around the world.&lt;ref&gt;S. Savic, B. Hemminger, T. Mee “High Fogging Application for Alstom Gas Turbines,” Proceedings of PowerGen November 2013. [http://www.meefog.com/wp-content/uploads/High-Fogging-Alsotom-Mee_-2013-2.pdf High-Fogging]&lt;/ref&gt; Inlet fog systems are, “simple, easy to install and operate” and less expensive than other power augmentation systems such as evaporative coolers and chillers.&lt;ref&gt;“Inlet Cooling Options” Turbomachinery international, May 2010 [http://www.meefog.com/wp-content/uploads/ar-gt-inlet-cooling-options.pdf Inlet Cooling Options]&lt;/ref&gt;

Inlet fogging is the least expensive gas turbine inlet air cooling option and has low operating costs, particularly when one accounts for the fact that fog systems impose only a negligible pressure drop on the inlet airflow when compared to media-type evaporative coolers.&lt;ref&gt;“To fog or not to fog:  What is the answer?” Combined Cycle Journal, Third Quarter 2008. [http://www.ccj-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/308_FOGGING.pdf%5D Combined Cycle Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Savic, M. Stevens, 2014. "Gas Turbine Air Inlet Cooling Technologies for Power Augmentation in the Gulf/Middle East Regions"[http://pennwell.sds06.websds.net//2014/abudhabi/pgme/papers/T2S5O2-paper.pdf  Penwell]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fog nozzle manifolds are typically located in the inlet air duct just downstream of the final air filters but other locations can be desirable depending on the design of the inlet duct and the intended use of the fog system.&lt;ref&gt;M. Chaker, T. Mee. “Design Considerations of Fogging and Wet Compression Systems as [a] Function of Gas Turbine Inlet Duct Configurations.” Proceedings of ASME Turbo Expo. June, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On a hot afternoon in a desert climate, it is possible to cool by as much as 40&amp;nbsp;°F (22.2&amp;nbsp;°C), while in a humid climate hot-afternoon cooling potential can be just 10&amp;nbsp;°F (5.6&amp;nbsp;°C) or less. Nevertheless, there are many successful inlet-fogging installations in humid climates such as Thailand, Malaysia and the American Gulf States.&lt;ref&gt;T. Mee. “Gas turbine inlet air fogging for humid environments.” The Singapore Engineer, May 2015, p. 30. [https://www.ies.org.sg/publication/se/may15.pdf Singapore Engineer]&lt;/ref&gt;

Inlet fogging reduces emissions of Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) because the additional water vapor quenches hot spots in the combustors of the gas turbine.&lt;ref&gt;T Mee, 1999. “Reduction of Gas Turbine NOX Emissions by Inlet Air Fogging” 18th Annual Power Systems Conference, Iran. [http://irandanesh.febpco.com/FileEssay/11-E-ENV-864.pdf Irandanesh]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wet Compression====

Fog systems can be used to produce more power than can be obtained by evaporative cooling alone. This is accomplished by spraying more fog than is required to fully saturate the inlet air. The excess fog droplets are carried into the gas turbine compressor where they evaporate and produce an intercooling effect, which results in a further power boost. This technique was first employed on an experimental gas turbine in Norway in 1903. There are many successful systems in operation today.&lt;ref&gt;S. Savic, B. Hemminger, T. Mee, High Fogging Application for Alstom Gas TurbinesProceedings of PowerGen November 2013. [http://www.meefog.com/wp-content/uploads/High-Fogging-Alsotom-Mee_-2013-2.pdf High-Fogging]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several gas turbine manufactures offer both fogging and wet compression systems. Systems are also available from third-party manufacturers.

=== Evaporative cooling ===

The [[evaporative cooler]] is a wetted rigid media where water is distributed throughout the header and where air passes through the wet porous surface. Part of the water is evaporated, absorbing the  sensible heat from the air and increasing its relative humidity. The air dry-bulb temperature is decreased but the wet-bulb temperature is not affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Theory and Operation of Evaporative Coolers For Industrial Gas Turbine Installations |publisher= Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exposition |date=June 5–9, 1988 |location=Amsterdam |author= R. S. JOHNSON, Sr., P.E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the fogging system, the theoretical limit is the wet bulb temperature, but performance of the evaporative cooler is usually around 80%. Water consumption is less than that of fogging cooling.

=== Vapour compression chiller ===
[[File:Gas turbine filter-house with cooling coil chilling air..png|thumbnail|Turbine Inlet Air Cooling|Turbine inlet air cooling filter-house modification to place the cooling coil coming from ammonia compression chiller plant]]
In a mechanical compression chiller technology, the coolant is circulated through a chilling coil heat exchanger that is inserted in the filter house, downstream from the filtering stage. Downstream from the coil, a droplet catcher is installed to collect moisture and water drops.  The mechanical chiller can increase the turbine output and performance better than wetted technologies due to the fact that inlet air can be chilled below the wet bulb temperature, indifferent to the weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Enhancing gas turbine output through inlet air cooling. |publisher=Sudan Eng. Soc. J., 52(4-6): 7-14. |year=2006 |vauthors=Kamal NA, Zuhair AM }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compression chiller equipment has higher electricity consumption than evaporative systems. Initial capital cost is also higher, however turbine power augmentation and efficiency is maximized, and the extra-cost is amortized due to increased output power.

The majority of such systems involve more than one chiller unit and the configuration of the chillers can have a great bearing on the system parasitic power consumption. The series counterflow configuration can reduce the compressor work needed on each chiller, improving the overall chiller system by as much as 8%.&lt;ref name="JCIPEI"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Green|first1=Stephen|title=Achieving optimal economic benefit from air inlet cooling|journal=Power Engineering|date=May 2015|pages=42–47|url=http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/en_sg/~/media/jci/be/singapore/gas-turbine-inlet-air-cooling/files/be_article_optimaleconomicbenefitfromairinletcooling.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other options such a steam driven compression are also used in industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Steam driven compressor  |url=http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/content/dam/WWW/jci/be/commercial/products/industrial___commercial/chiller_products/centrifugal__steam/ASHRAE_Journal_Steam_Turbine_Chillers.pdf |author=Ian Spanswick |publisher=ASHRAE Journal |date=September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vapour-absorption chiller ===

In [[Absorption refrigerator|vapor-absorption chillers]] technology, thermal energy is used to produce cooling instead of mechanical energy. The heat source is usually leftover steam coming from combined cycle, and it is bypassed to drive the cooling system. Compared to mechanical chillers, absorption chillers have a low coefficient of performance, however, it should be taken into consideration that this chiller usually uses waste heat, which decreases the operational cost.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Low-Grade Waste Steam to Power Absorption Chillers |url=https://www1.eere.energy.gov/manufacturing/tech_assistance/pdfs/steam14_chillers.pdf |author=U.S. Department of Energy |date= January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Combination with thermal energy storage ===

A [[thermal energy storage]] tank is a naturally stratified thermal accumulator that allows the storage of chilled water produced during off-peak time, to use this energy later during on-peak time to chill the turbine inlet air and increment its power output.  A thermal energy storage tank reduces operational cost and refrigerant plant capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TES tank: How it works |url=http://www.araner.com/#!thermal-storage-tank/c1ed}}&lt;/ref&gt; One advantage is the production of chilled water when demand is low, using the excess of power generation, which usually coincides with the night, when ambient temperature is low and chillers have better performance. Another advantage is the reduction of the chilling plant capacity and operational cost in comparison with an on-line chilling system, which produce delays during periods of low demand.

== Benefits ==

In areas where there is demand cooling, daily summer on-peak periods coincide with the highest atmospheric temperatures, which may reduce the efficiency and power gas turbines.  With the vapor mechanical compression technologies, cooling can be used during these periods so that the performance and the power output of the turbine may be less affected by ambient conditions

Another benefit is the lower cost per extra inlet-cooling kilowatt compared to newly installed gas turbine kilowatt{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}. Moreover, the extra inlet-cooling kilowatt uses less fuel than the new turbine kilowatt due to the lower heat-rate (higher efficiency) of the chilled turbine. Other benefits may include the incrementation of steam mass flow in a [[combined cycle]], the reduction of turbine emissions (SOx, NOx, CO2),&lt;ref name="Powergenu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powergenu.com/courses/13/PDF/3-PGU_TurbineInletCooling.pdf|title=Turbine Inlet Cooling: An Energy Solution That's Better for the Environment, Ratepayers and Plant Owners|author=Powergenu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increase in power-to-installed volume ratio.

Calculating the benefits of turbine air cooling requires a study to determine payback periods, taking into consideration several aspects like ambient conditions, cost of water, hourly electric demand values, cost of fuel.&lt;ref name="stewart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashrae.org/File%20Library/docLib/eNewsletters/Stewart-091998--feature.pdf|title=Turbine Inlet Air Cooling|date=September 2008|publisher=ASHRAE JOURNAL|author=William E.

The '''University of Warwick Science Park''' (also known as '''UWSP''' and '''Warwick Science Park''') was one of the first university based science parks in the United Kingdom when it was opened by the Rt. Hon. [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.insidermedia.com/insider/midlands/4889-cover-story-rowes-rollercoaster/]." ''Insider Media''. Retrieved on 13 July 2011. "Rowe's Rollercoaster"&lt;/ref&gt; It was a joint venture between the [[University of Warwick]], [[Coventry City Council]], [[Warwickshire County Council]] and [[Barclays]]. The latter are no longer shareholders having been replaced by WM Enterprise. The University of Warwick agreed in 2011 to purchase the shareholding of Coventry City Council.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-12690034]." ''BBC News''.

The '''Utility Radio''' or '''Wartime Civilian Receiver''' was a [[vacuum tube|valve]] domestic [[Superheterodyne receiver|radio receiver]], manufactured in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] during [[World War II]] starting in July  1944. It was designed by G.D Reynolds of [[Murphy Radio]]. Both AC and battery-operated versions were made.&lt;ref name="Miller2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Charles Edward|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=_DJZf2P0gFoC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Valve Radio and Audio Repair Handbook|publisher=Newnes|year=2000|isbn=0-7506-3995-4|pp= 144-151}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vintage-radio.com/manufacturers-and-sets/wartime.html |title=Wartime manufactuerers and sets |publisher=vintageradio.com |accessdate=2014-12-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233134/http://www.vintage-radio.com/manufacturers-and-sets/wartime.html |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Street2002" /&gt;

==History==
When war broke out in 1939, British radio manufacturers devoted their resources to producing a range of military radio equipment required for the armed forces. This resulted in a shortage of consumer radio sets and spare parts, particularly valves, as all production was for the services. The war also prompted a shortage of radio repairmen, as virtually all of them were needed in the services to maintain vital radio and radar equipment. This meant it was very difficult for the average citizen to get a radio repaired, and with very few new sets available, there was a desperate need to overcome the problem.&lt;ref name="ClassicWireless" /&gt;

The Government solved this by arranging for over 40 radio manufacturers to produce sets to a standard design with as few components as possible consistent with ability to source them. Earlier the Government had introduced the [[Utility clothing|'Utility']] brand to ensure that all clothing, which was rationed, was produced to a reasonable quality standard as prior to its introduction a lot of shoddy goods had appeared on the market. So the 'Utility' brand was adopted for this wartime radio.&lt;ref name="Street2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sean Street|title=A Concise History of British Radio, 1922-2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y7jo0IcUZeoC&amp;pg=PA78|year=2002|publisher=Kelly Publications|isbn=978-1-903053-14-0|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller2000"/&gt;

The Utility Set had limited reception on [[medium wave]] and lacked a [[longwave]] band to simplify the design.   The tuning scale listed only BBC stations. After the war a version with LW was made available and modification kits to retrofit existing sets were marketed.&lt;ref name="valve"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thevalvepage.com/radios/wartime/mains/warmains.htm |title=Wartime mains |publisher=Thevalvepage.com |accessdate=2006-03-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192706/http://www.thevalvepage.com/radios/wartime/mains/warmains.htm |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 175,000 sets were sold, at a price of £12 3s 4d each.&lt;ref name="ClassicWireless"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicwireless.btinternet.co.uk/warciva.htm|title=Wartime Civilian Receiver|publisher=ClassicWireless.co.uk|year=2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011231913/http://www.classicwireless.btinternet.co.uk/warciva.htm|archivedate=2012-10-11|accessdate=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The set is sometimes characterized as the British equivalent of the German [[Volksempfänger]] "Peoples' Receiver"; however there were dissimilarities. The ''Volksempfänger'' were radio sets designed to be inexpensive enough for any German citizen to purchase one. A supply of higher quality consumer radios were always available to Germans who could afford to pay higher prices. By contrast, the Utility Set was the only consumer radio receiver that could be purchased on the British market for much of the latter part of the war.&lt;ref name="Ross2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Corey Ross|title=Media and the Making of Modern Germany: Mass Communications, Society, and Politics from the Empire to the Third Reich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RxytXTsadScC&amp;pg=PA1805|date=6 May 2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-161494-1|pages=1805–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in June 1942, manufacture of consumer radio receivers in the [[United States]] also ceased due to military production needs.&lt;ref name="McGregorDriscoll2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael A.

== Specifications ==
The sets used a four-valve [[Superheterodyne receiver|superhet]] circuit with an audio output of 4 watts at 10% total [[harmonic distortion]]; they performed as well as many pre-war sets. The valve complement consisted of a [[Pentagrid converter#Hexode|triode-hexode]] [[frequency changer]], a [[variable mu|variable-μ]] RF [[pentode]] IF amplifier and a high slope output pentode. A "Westector" solid-state [[Metal_rectifier|copper oxide diode]] was used for [[demodulation]], which saved one valve and allowed use of an available type of pentode for the audio stage.&lt;ref name="Miller2000"/&gt; The [[HT (vacuum tube)|HT]] line was derived from a [[full wave rectifier]]. All valves were on International Octal sockets apart from the rectifier which was on a British 4-pin base. There were minor variations between set makers; for instance [[Philips]] used [[intermediate frequency|IF]] transformers with adjustable [[ferrite core]]s (so-called slug tuning) rather than the conventional trimmer capacitors.&lt;ref name="Street2002" /&gt;

== Manufacturers ==
More than 40 manufacturers, such as [[Pye Ltd.]] and [[Marconiphone]], made Utility radios. The manufacturer of a particular set was not readily apparent to the general public, although each manufacturer stamped a code letter on the radio to identify themselves to dealers. UK makers often used different designations for the same valve (tube). Octal tubes might be of USA origin. All valves in the Utility radio used standard designations prefixed by BVA (British Valve Association). They were produced by valve makers such as [[Mullard]], [[Marconi-Osram Valve|MOV]], [[Cossor]], Mazda and Brimar. Dealers, knowing the maker of a set and which valve manufacturer that maker used, could easily deduce which pre-war types these were and make warranty claims on the manufacturer.&lt;ref name="valve" /&gt;
