The '''active object''' [[design pattern]] decouples method execution from method invocation for objects that each reside in their own [[thread (computing)|thread]] of control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | author = [[Douglas C. Schmidt]]
 |author2=Michael Stal|author3=Hans Rohnert|author4=Frank Buschmann
 | year = 2000
 | title = Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture, Volume 2: Patterns for Concurrent and Networked Objects
 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons
 | isbn = 0-471-60695-2
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to introduce [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]], by using [[asynchronous method invocation]] and a [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduler]] for handling requests.&lt;ref&gt;Bass, L., Clements, P., Kazman, R. ''Software Architecture in Practice''. Addison Wesley, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The pattern consists of six elements:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Active Object
 | first = R. Greg
 | last = Lavender
 | author2= Schmidt, Douglas C.
 | format = PDF
 | url = http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/PDF/Act-Obj.pdf
 | accessdate=2007-02-02
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[Proxy pattern|proxy]], which provides an interface towards clients with publicly accessible methods.
* An interface which defines the method request on an active object.
* A list of pending requests from clients.
* A [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduler]], which decides which request to execute next.
* The implementation of the active object method.
* A [[Callback (computer science)|callback]] or [[Variable (computer science)|variable]] for the client to receive the result.

== Example ==

=== Java ===
An example of active object pattern in [[Java (programming language)|Java]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Java Active Objects - A Proposal
 | first = Allen 
 | last = Holub
 | url = http://pragprog.com/magazines/2013-05/java-active-objects
 | accessdate=2014-06-16
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Firstly we can see a standard class that provides two methods that set a double to be a certain value. This class does '''NOT''' conform to the active object pattern.

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
class MyClass {

    private double val = 0.0;
    
    void doSomething() {
        val = 1.0;
    }

    void doSomethingElse() {
        val = 2.0;
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The class is dangerous in a multithreading scenario because both methods can be called simultaneously, so the value of val (which is not atomic—it's updated in multiple steps) could be undefined—a classic race condition. You can, of course, use synchronization to solve this problem, which in this trivial case is easy. But once the class becomes realistically complex, synchronization can become very difficult. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = Java Active Objects - A Proposal
 | first = Allen 
 | last = Holub
 | url = http://pragprog.com/magazines/2013-05/java-active-objects
 | accessdate=2014-06-16
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

To rewrite this class as an active object you could do the following:

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
class MyActiveObject {

    private double val = 0.0;

    private BlockingQueue&lt;Runnable&gt; dispatchQueue = new LinkedBlockingQueue&lt;Runnable&gt;();

    public MyActiveObject() {
        new Thread (new Runnable() {
                    
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    while(true) {
                        try {
                            dispatchQueue.take().run();
                        } catch (InterruptedException e) {   
                            // okay, just terminate the dispatcher
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        ).start();
    }

    void doSomething() throws InterruptedException {
        dispatchQueue.put(new Runnable() {
                @Override
                public void run() { 
                    val = 1.0; 
                }
            }
        );
    }

    void doSomethingElse() throws InterruptedException {
        dispatchQueue.put(new Runnable() {
                @Override
                public void run() { 
                    val = 2.0; 
                }
            }
        );
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Java 8 (alternative) ===
Another example of active object pattern in Java instead implemented in Java 8 providing a shorter solution.

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
public class MyClass {
    private double val; 
    
    // container for tasks
    // decides which request to execute next 
    // asyncMode=true means our worker thread processes its local task queue in the FIFO order 
    // only single thread may modify internal state
    private final ForkJoinPool fj = new ForkJoinPool(1, ForkJoinPool.defaultForkJoinWorkerThreadFactory, null, true);
    
    // implementation of active object method
    public void doSomething() throws InterruptedException {
        fj.execute(() -&gt; {val = 1.0;});
    }
 
    // implementation of active object method
    public void doSomethingElse() throws InterruptedException {
        fj.execute(() -&gt; {val = 2.0;});
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3565">'''Allen''' was a [[robot]] introduced by [[Rodney Brooks]] and his team in the late 1980s, and was their first robot based on [[subsumption architecture]]. It had [[sonar]] distance and [[odometry]] on board, and used an offboard [[lisp machine]] to simulate subsumption architecture. It resembled a footstool on wheels.&lt;ref name=Brooks1990&gt;{{cite journal

 | accessdate = 2009-02-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen used three layers of control which are implemented in subsumption architecture.&lt;ref name=Brooks1990/&gt; ''"The lowest layer of control makes sure that the robot does not come into contact with other objects."''&lt;ref name="brooks"&gt;
{{cite journal

 | doi=10.1109/JRA.1986.1087032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this layer it could avoid static and dynamic obstacles, but it could not move. It sat in the middle of the room, waiting for obstruction. When the obstruction came, Allen ran away, avoiding collisions as it went. It used following internal [[Knowledge representation|representation]], and every sonar return represented a repulsive force with, and inverse square drop off in strength. Direction of its move was obtained by sum of the repulsive forces (suitably thresholded). It possessed an additional reflex which halted it whenever it was moving forward, and something was directly in its path.&lt;ref name=Brooks1990/&gt;

''"The first level layer of control (second layer), when combined with zeroth, imbues the robot with the ability to wander around aimlessly without hitting obstacles."''&lt;ref name="brooks"/&gt; Owing to the second layer, Allen could randomly wander about every 10 seconds. It used simple [[heuristic]], which was coupled with the instinct to shun barriers by [[Euclidean vector|vector]] addition. ''"The summed vector suppressed the more primitive obstacle avoidance vector, but the obstacle avoidance behaviour still operated, having been subsumed by the new layer, in its account of the lower level's repulsive force. Additionally, the halt reflex of the lower level operated autonomously and unchanged."''&lt;ref name=Brooks1990/&gt;

The third layer made the robot try to explore. Allen could look for distant places (with its sonars), then tried to reach them. ''"This layer monitored progress through odometry, generating a desired heading which suppressed the direction desired by the wander layer. The desired heading was then fed into a vector addition with the instinctive obstacle avoidance layer. The physical robot did not therefore remain true to the desires of the upper layer. The upper layer had to watch what happened in the world, through odometry, in order to understand what was really happening in the lower control layers, and send down correction signals."''&lt;ref name=Brooks1990/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1651">[[image:Alpha oxidation.svg|Enzymatic steps of alpha oxidation|right|thumb|250px]]
 

==Pathway==
Alpha-oxidation of [[phytanic acid]] is believed to take place entirely within [[peroxisomes]]. 
#[[Phytanic acid]] is first attached to [[Coenzyme A|CoA]] to form [[phytanoyl-CoA]].
#[[Phytanoyl-CoA]] is oxidized by [[phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase]], in a process using Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to yield 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA.
#2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA is cleaved by [[2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase]] in a [[thiamine pyrophosphate|TPP]]-dependent reaction to form pristanal and [[formyl-CoA]] (in turn later broken down into [[formate]] and eventually CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).
#Pristanal is oxidized by [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] to form [[pristanic acid]] (which can then undergo [[beta-oxidation]]).
(Propionyl-CoA is released as a result of beta oxidation when the beta carbon is substituted)

==Deficiency==
Enzymatic deficiency in alpha-oxidation (most frequently in [[phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase]]) leads to [[Refsum's disease]], in which the accumulation of [[phytanic acid]] and its derivatives leads to neurological damage. Other disorders of [[peroxisome]] biogenesis also prevent alpha-oxidation from occurring.

'''''Art by Women in Florence: A Guide through Five Hundred Years''''' is a 2012 book written by [[Jane Fortune]] and Linda Falcone through The [[Advancing Women Artists Foundation]] and published by The Florentine Press. ''Art by Women in Florence'' is adapted from the book ''[[Invisible Women: Forgotten Artists of Florence]]'' as a pocket-size guidebook through [[Florence, Italy|Florence's]] museums showcasing over eighty paintings and sculptures by more than sixty women artists.&lt;ref name="art by women in florence"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fortune|first=Jane|title=Art by Women in Florence: A Guide through Five Hundred Years|year=2012|publisher=The Florentine Press|location=Florence, Italy|isbn=978-88-97696-01-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="art by women in florence site"&gt;{{cite web|title=Art by Women in Florence|url=http://www.theflorentinepress.com/art-by-women-in-florence/|publisher=The Florentine Press|accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proceeds derived from ''Art by Women in Florence'' support projects sponsored by the Advancing Women Artists Foundation in their work to research, restore, and exhibit artwork by women in Florence's museums and storehouses.&lt;ref name="AWA art by women in florence cite"&gt;{{cite web|title=Art by Women in Florence: A Guide through Five Hundred Years |url=http://www.advancingwomenartists.org/art-by-women.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723165602/http://advancingwomenartists.org/art-by-women.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 July 2013 |publisher=Advancing Women Artists Foundation |accessdate=24 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
''Art by Women in Florence: A Guide through Five Hundred Years'' is divided into eight sections, including a brief segment on unexhibited paintings, and provides a fold-out map of Florence delineating twenty locations housing viewable artwork.&lt;ref name="AWA art by women in florence cite" /&gt;  (See full list below.)

The book points to a number of religious paintings in Florence's churches including works by [[Suor Plautilla Nelli]], the city's first known woman artist (2) such as her ''Lamentation with Saints'' in the [[San Marco Museum]]. Visitors to [[Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence|Santa Maria del Carmine]] will find a burial monument by Félice de Fauveau, considered to be one of the most preeminent marble sculptures of the nineteenth century. ''Art by Women in Florence'' spotlights [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], a seventeenth-century [[Baroque]] master known to depict historical and mythical heroines. A significant portion of the guide showcases self-portraiture in the [[Vasari Corridor]]. These protagonists include the wildly popular [[Angelica Kauffmann]] whose work inspired designs for high-class housewares at the peak of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and [[Cecilia Beaux]] the earliest American invited to contribute to the Corridor's self-portrait collection. (2) ''Art by Women in Florence'' guides the reader to the outskirts of Florence to explore various [[Medici]] villas hosting works by numerous women including [[Lavinia Fontana]], the first female painter to receive a public commission in Italy, and seventeenth-century court artist [[Giovanna Fratellini]].&lt;ref name="AWA art by women in florence cite" /&gt;

They have also committed to abide by a Standard of Ethics, Conduct and Performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.associationfornutrition.org/default.aspx?tabid=76 "The UK Voluntary Register of Nutritionists (UKVRN)"] Accessed 15 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; There are three categories of UKVRN registrants, ''Registered Nutritionist (RNutr)'' with nutrition specialism in public health, nutrition science, sport &amp; exercise, food or animal nutrition, ''Registered Associate Nutritionist (ANutr)'' and ''Fellow of AfN (FAfN)''.

===Registered Associate Nutritionists ===

Registered Associate Nutritionists ([[post-nominal]]s: '''ANutr''') are recent graduates, who have been able to demonstrate a sound foundation of knowledge and understanding in nutrition science, and are working towards gaining sufficient experience within a specialist area to become a Registered Nutritionist (RNutr).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.associationfornutrition.org/Default.aspx?tabid=223 "Associate Nutritionist Description"] Accessed 15 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Registered Nutritionists ===

'''RNutr''' have been assessed as having demonstrated that they have met rigorously applied knowledge, understanding and practice core competencies. They commit to keeping their knowledge up to date and ensuring they follow evidence-based practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.associationfornutrition.org/Default.aspx?tabid=226 "Registered Nutritionist Description"] Accessed 15 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fellows of the Association for Nutrition ===

Fellows ('''FAfN''') have been Registered Nutritionists (RNutr) for at least five years and have been recognised by their peers to have made a significant and sustained contribution to the advancement of nutrition practice, research or education at a national or international level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.associationfornutrition.org/Default.aspx?tabid=230 "Fellowship of the AfN Description"] Accessed 15 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Balak-Palak''''' (meaning ''Children-Parents'') (BP) is a 2013 [[Marathi language]] comedy-drama film on the topic of [[sex education]]. The film is directed by Ravi Jadhav and produced by [[Riteish Deshmukh]], Uttung Thakur and Ravi Jadhav. This is the first film produced by actor Riteish Deshmukh.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The story was written by Ganesh Pandit and Amber Hadap. Balak Palak was shot by  Mahesh Limaye.

The initials formed by the title of the film (BP) also make a secondary reference to a '[[Amateur pornography|blue picture]]' or low-quality [[pornography|pornographic]] videos that were available on videotape in the 1980s in South Asia.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The film deals with the topic of [[sex education]] of adolescents &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-17/news-interviews/33903833_1_marathi-film-director-ravi-jadhav-sai-tamhankar | title=Balak Palak to stress on need for sex education | publisher=''Times of India'' | date=17 September 2012 | accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is rated [[Central Board of Film Certification#Current certificates|UA (Parental Guidance)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-01/news-interviews/33522084_1_film-talks-certification-target-audience | title=U/A certification for Balak Palak | publisher=''Times of India'' | date=1 September 2012 | accessdate=7 January 2013 | author=Deshmukh, Gayatri}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the positive reviews the film received, Deshmukh plans to make a [[Hindi language]] remake of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-01-05/news-interviews/36149489_1_balak-palak-actor-riteish-deshmukh-language-barrier | title=Riteish planning Hindi remake of 'Balak Palak' | publisher=''[[Times of India]]'' | date=5 January 2013 | accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tellychakkar.com/movie-chakkar/riteish-deshmukh-plans-hindi-remake-his-balak-palak | title=Riteish Deshmukh plans Hindi remake of his Balak Palak | publisher=''Telly Chakkar'' | accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This film is being made into [[Tamil cinema|Tamil]] and [[Telugu cinema|Telugu]]  by Director Srikanth Velagaleti.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2546">The '''bead theory''' is a disproved [[hypothesis]] that [[gene]]s are arranged on the [[chromosome]] like [[bead]]s on a [[necklace]]. This theory was first proposed by [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] after discovering [[Gene|genes]] through his work with breeding red and white eyed fruit flies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Thomas Hunt|date=1910|title=Sex Limited Inheritance in Drosophilia|url=http://www.esp.org/foundations/genetics/classical/thm-10a.pdf|journal=Science|volume=32|pages=120-122|via=ESP.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, the existence of a gene as a unit of inheritance is recognized through its mutant alleles. A mutant allele affects a single phenotypic character, maps to one chromosome locus, gives a mutant phenotype when paired and shows a Mendelian ratio when intercrossed. Several tenets of the bead theory are worth emphasizing :-
1. The gene is viewed as a '''fundamental unit of structure''', indivisible by crossing over. Crossing over take place between genes ( the beads in this model ) but never within them.
2. The gene is viewed as the '''fundamental unit of change or mutation'''. It changes in toto from one allelic form into another; there are no smaller components within it that can change.
3. The gene is viewed as the '''fundamental unit of function''' ( although the precise function of gene is not specified in this model ). Parts of a gene, if they exist cannot function. [[Guido Pontecorvo]] continued to work under the basis of this theory until 
[[Seymour Benzer]] showed in the 1950s that the bead theory was not correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siddoqi|first=Obaid|date=1999|title=Guido Pontecorvo (1907-1999)|url=https://link-springer-com.libproxy.mst.edu/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBF02934463.pdf|journal=Journal of Genetics|volume=78|pages=171-173|via=www.springer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He demonstrated that a gene can be defined as a unit of function. A gene can be subdivided into a linear array of sites that are mutable and that can be recombined. The smallest units of mutation and recombination are now known to be correlated with single nucleotide pairs.

In [[biodiversity]] studies, the '''checkerboard score''' or '''C-score''' is a statistic which determines the randomness of the distribution of two or more species through a collection of [[biome]]s.  The statistic, first published by Stone and Roberts in 1990,&lt;ref name="StoneRoberts1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stone|first1=Lewis|last2=Roberts|first2=Alan|title=The checkerboard score and species distributions|journal=Oecologia|volume=85|issue=1|year=1990|pages=74–79|issn=0029-8549|doi=10.1007/BF00317345}}&lt;/ref&gt; expands on the earlier work of Diamond&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
  |last=Diamond|first=JM
  |year=1975
  |chapter=Assembly of species communities
  |editor1-last=Cody|editor1-first=ML
  |editor2-last=Diamond|editor2-first=JM

  |publisher=Belknap Press
  |pages=342–444
}}&lt;/ref&gt; that defined a notion of "checkerboard distributions" as an indicator of [[Competition (biology)|species competition]].

A low c-score indicates a higher randomness, i.e. a greater likelihood that the distribution of one species has not been directly affected by the presence of other species.

==Definition and calculation==

Given two species ''sp&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''sp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''n'' islands, an incident matrix is built.
In the 2xn incident matrix, each row represents one of the two species and each column represents a different island.
The matrix is then filled with each cell being set to either 0 or 1. Cell with the value of 0 means that a given species doesn't exist in the given island whilst the value of 1 means that the species do exist in the given island.

The calculation of the co-occurrence of two species ''sp&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''sp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the given set of islands is done as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;C_{ij} = (r_i- S_{ij}) (r_j - S_{ij} )&lt;/math&gt;

:{{math|&lt;var&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}  - C-score for the two species ''sp&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''sp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the given set of islands
:{{math|&lt;var&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}} - The number of co-occurrences of ''sp&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''sp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''
:{{math|&lt;var&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}  -  Number of islands in which ''sp&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' has 1
:{{math|&lt;var&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}} -  Number of islands in which ''sp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' has 1

The checkerboard score (c-score) for the colonisation pattern is then calculated as the mean number of checkerboard units per species-pair in the community:

For M species, there are {{math|&lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} &lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt;-1)/2}} species-pairs, so C-score is calculated:

:&lt;math&gt;C =\sum_{j=0}^{M} \sum_{i&lt;j}C_{ij} / P&lt;/math&gt;

The C-score is sensitive to the proportion of islands that are occupied, thereby confounding comparisons between matrices or sets of species pairs within them.  An extension of the C-score therefore standardizes by the number of islands each species-pair occupies using:&lt;ref name="Novaketal2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Novak|first1=Mark|last2=Moore|first2=Jonathan W.|last3=Leidy|first3=Robert A.|title=Nestedness patterns and the dual nature of community reassembly in California streams: a multivariate permutation-based approach|journal=Global Change Biology|volume=17|year=2011|pages=3714–3723|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02482.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_{ij} = (r_i- S_{ij}) (r_j - S_{ij} )/(r_i + r_j - S_{ij})&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15425">The '''Cronquist system''' is a [[list of systems of plant taxonomy|taxonomic classification system]] of [[angiosperms|flowering plants]]. It was developed by [[Arthur Cronquist]] in a series of monographs and texts, including  ''The Evolution and Classification of Flowering Plants'' (1968; 2nd edition, 1988) and ''An Integrated System of Classification of Flowering Plants'' (1981) (''see'' [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]]).

Cronquist's system places flowering plants into two broad classes, '''[[Magnoliopsida]]''' ([[dicotyledon]]s) and '''[[Liliopsida]]''' ([[monocotyledon]]s). Within these classes, related orders are grouped into subclasses. While the scheme was widely used, in either the original form or in adapted versions, many botanists now use the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] classification for the orders and families of flowering plants, first developed in 1998. The system as laid out in Cronquist's ''An Integrated System of Classification of Flowering Plants'' (1981) counts 64 orders and 321 families in class Magnoliopsida and 19 orders and 65 families in class Liliopsida.

'''Decoded Neurofeedback''' (DecNef) is the process of inducing [[knowledge]] in a subject by increasing [[neuron|neural]] activation in predetermined regions in the [[brain]], such as the [[visual cortex]]. This is achieved by measuring neural activity in these regions via [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (FMRI), comparing this to the ideal pattern of neural activation in these [[List of regions in the human brain|regions]] (for the intended purpose), and giving subjects [[feedback]] on how close their current pattern of neural activity is to the ideal pattern. Without explicit knowledge of what they are supposed to be doing or thinking about, over time participants learn to induce this ideal pattern of neural activation. Corresponding to this, their 'knowledge' or way of thinking has been found to change accordingly.

Experiments conducted in 2011 at [[Boston University]] (BU) and ATR [[computational neuroscience|Computational Neuroscience]] Laboratories in Kyoto, Japan demonstrated that volunteers were able to quickly solve complex visual puzzles they had not previously had exposure to. They did so by receiving the brain patterns of other volunteers who had already learned to solve the puzzles through [[trial and error]] methods.

The research has far-reaching implications for treating patients with various [[learning disabilities]], [[mental illness]], [[memory problems]], and [[Motor impairment|motor functionality impairments]].

Economics focuses on the behaviour and interactions of [[Agent (economics)|economic agents]] and how [[economy|economies]] work. [[Microeconomics]] analyzes basic elements in the economy, including individual agents and [[markets]], their interactions, and the outcomes of interactions. Individual agents may include, for example, households, firms, buyers, and sellers. [[Macroeconomics]] analyzes the entire economy (meaning aggregated production, consumption, savings, and investment) and issues affecting it, including unemployment of resources (labour, capital, and land), inflation, economic growth, and the public policies that address these issues (monetary, fiscal, and other policies).  See [[glossary of economics]].

Other broad distinctions within economics include those between [[positive economics]], describing "what is", and [[normative economics]], advocating "what ought to be"; between economic theory and [[applied economics]]; between [[Rational choice theory|rational]] and [[behavioural economics]]; and between [[mainstream economics]] and [[heterodox economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first1=Andrew |editor-last1=Caplin |editor-first2=Andrew |editor-last2=Schotter |title=The Foundations of Positive and Normative Economics: A Handbook |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2008 |isbn=978-0-19-532831-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k2d8SFFyeNEC&amp;pg=PP1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline was renamed in the late 19th century, primarily due to [[Alfred Marshall]], from "[[political economy]]" to "economics" as a shorter term for "economic science". At that time, it became more open to rigorous thinking and made increased use of mathematics, which helped support efforts to have it accepted as a science and as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences.{{efn|The term ''economics'' is derived from ''economic science'', and the word ''economic'' is perhaps shortened from ''economical'' or derived from the French word ''économique'' or directly from the Latin word ''oeconomicus'' "of domestic economy". This in turn comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|οἰκονομικός}} (''oikonomikos''), "practiced in the management of a household or family" and therefore "frugal, thrifty", which in turn comes from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:οἰκονομία|οἰκονομία]]}} (''oikonomia'') "household management" which in turn comes from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:οἶκος|οἶκος]]}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|oikos}}'' "house") and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:νόμος|νόμος]]}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|nomos}}'', "custom" or "law").&lt;ref name="etymology"&gt;{{cite web |last=Harper |first=Douglas |authorlink=Douglas Harper |title=Online Etymology Dictionary&amp;nbsp;– Economy |date=February 2007 |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=economic |accessdate=27 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name="Free2010"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Free|editor-first=Rhona C. |title=21st Century Economics: A Reference Handbook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRFadIRMaMsC&amp;pg=PA8 |volume=Volume 1 |year=2010 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-1-4129-6142-4 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MarshallMarshall1888"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marshall |first1=Alfred |authorlink1=Alfred Marshall |last2=Marshall |first2=Mary Paley |authorlink2=Mary Paley Marshall |title=The Economics of Industry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wFc4yr9xfqAC&amp;pg=PA2 |year=1888 |publisher=Macmillan |page=2|orig-year=1879}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jevons1879"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jevons |first=William Stanley |authorlink=William Stanley Jevons |title=The Theory of Political Economy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aYcBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR14 |edition=second |year=1879 |publisher=Macmillan and Co |page=XIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=a branch of the science of a statesman or legislator [with the twofold objectives of providing] a plentiful revenue or subsistence for the people&amp;nbsp;... [and] to supply the state or commonwealth with a revenue for the publick services.&lt;ref name="Groenwegen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Adam |author-link=Adam Smith |date=1776 |title=An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations|title-link=An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations }} and Book IV, as quoted in {{cite encyclopedia |first=Peter |last=Groenwegen |date=2008 |title=Political Economy  |pages=476–480 |work=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |edition=second |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume  |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_P000114 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.1300|chapter='political economy' |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Jean-Baptiste Say]] (1803), distinguishing the subject from its [[public policy|public-policy]] uses, defines it as the science ''of'' production, distribution, and consumption of [[wealth]].&lt;ref name="Say1803"&gt;{{cite book|last=Say|first=Jean Baptiste|authorlink=Jean-Baptiste Say|title=A Treatise on Political Economy|year=1803|publisher=Grigg and Elliot|ref=harv|title-link=Say's Political Economy}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[satirical]] side, [[Thomas Carlyle]] (1849) coined "[[the dismal science]]" as an [[Epithet#Alternative contemporary usage|epithet]] for [[classical economics]], in this context, commonly linked to the pessimistic analysis of [[Malthus]] (1798).&lt;ref name="Dismal"&gt;• {{cite magazine |last=Carlyle |first=Thomas |author-link=Thomas Carlyle |date=1849 |title=[[Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question]] |magazine=[[Fraser's Magazine]] }}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite book |last=Malthus |first=Thomas Robert |author-link=Thomas Robert Malthus |date=1798 |title=An Essay on the Principle of Population |publisher=J.

{{quote|text=The science which traces the laws of such of the phenomena of society as arise from the combined operations of mankind for the production of wealth, in so far as those phenomena are not modified by the pursuit of any other object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mill|first=John Stuart|authorlink=John Stuart Mill|title=Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4TxQqkP40fYC&amp;pg=PA99|year=2007|publisher=Cosimo|isbn=978-1-60206-978-7|chapter=On the Definition of Political Economy; and on the Method of Investigation Proper to It|orig-year=1844}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Alfred Marshall]] provides a still widely cited definition in his textbook ''[[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Principles of Economics]]'' (1890) that extends analysis beyond [[Economic wealth|wealth]] and from the [[societal]] to the [[microeconomic]] level:

{{quote|text=Economics is a study of man in the ordinary business of life. It enquires how he gets his income and how he uses it. Thus, it is on the one side, the study of wealth and on the other and more important side, a part of the study of man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Alfred|authorlink=Alfred Marshall|title=Principles of Economics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bykoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1|year=1890|publisher=Macmillan and Company|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Lionel Robbins]] (1932) developed implications of what has been termed "[p]erhaps the most commonly accepted current definition of the subject":&lt;ref name="BackhouseMedema2009"/&gt;

{{quote |text=Economics is a science which studies [[human behaviour]] as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robbins|first=Lionel|title=An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nySoIkOgWQ4C&amp;pg=PA15|year=2007|orig-year=1932|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|isbn=978-1-61016-039-1|page=15|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Robbins describes the definition as not ''classificatory'' in "pick[ing] out certain ''kinds'' of behaviour" but rather ''analytical'' in "focus[ing] attention on a particular ''aspect'' of behaviour, the form imposed by the influence of [[scarcity]]."{{sfnp|Robbins|2007|p=16}} He affirmed that previous economists have usually centred their studies on the analysis of wealth: how wealth is created (production), distributed, and consumed; and how wealth can grow.{{sfnp|Robbins|2007|pp=4-7}} But he said that economics can be used to study other things, such as war, that are outside its usual focus.  This is because war has as the goal winning it (as a sought after '''end'''), generates both cost and benefits; and, '''resources''' (human life and other costs) are used to attain the goal.  If the war is not winnable or if the expected costs outweigh the benefits, the deciding '''actors''' (assuming they are rational) may never go to war (a '''decision''') but rather explore other alternatives. We cannot define economics as the science that studies wealth, war, crime, education, and any other field economic analysis can be applied to; but, as the science that studies a particular common aspect of each of those subjects (they all use scarce resources to attain a sought after end).

Some subsequent comments criticized the definition as overly broad in failing to limit its subject matter to analysis of markets. From the 1960s, however, such comments abated as the economic theory of maximizing behaviour and [[rational choice|rational-choice]] modelling [[Economic imperialism (economics)|expanded the domain]] of the subject to areas previously treated in other fields.&lt;ref name="Backhouse2009Stigler"&gt;• {{cite journal |last1=Backhouse |first1=Roger E. |first2=Steven G. |last2=Medema |date=October 2009 |title=Defining Economics: The Long Road to Acceptance of the Robbins Definition |journal=Economica |volume=76 |issue=s1 |pages=805–820 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0335.2009.00789.x}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite journal |author-link=George J.

[[Gary Becker]], a contributor to the expansion of economics into new areas, describes the approach he favours as "combin[ing the] assumptions of maximizing behaviour, stable [[preference (economics)|preferences]], and [[economic equilibrium|market equilibrium]], used relentlessly and unflinchingly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Becker|first=Gary S.|title=The Economic Approach to Human Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwEOFKSKbMgC&amp;pg=PA5|year=1976|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-04112-4|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; One commentary characterizes the remark as making economics an approach rather than a subject matter but with great specificity as to the "choice process and the type of [[social interaction]] that [such] analysis involves." The same source reviews a range of definitions included in principles of economics textbooks and concludes that the lack of agreement need not affect the subject-matter that the texts treat. Among economists more generally, it argues that a particular definition presented may reflect the direction toward which the author believes economics is evolving, or should evolve.&lt;ref name=BackhouseMedema2009/&gt;

==Microeconomics==
{{Main|Microeconomics}}

===Markets===
{{Main|Markets}}
[[File:Ballard Farmers' Market - vegetables.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Economists study trade, production and consumption decisions, such as those that occur in a traditional [[marketplace]].|alt=A vegetable vendor in a marketplace.]]
[[File:Sao Paulo Stock Exchange.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Electronic trading]] brings together buyers and sellers through an [[electronic trading platform]] and network to create virtual market places. Pictured: [[São Paulo Stock Exchange]], Brazil.|alt=Two men sit at computer monitors with financial information.]]
Microeconomics examines how entities, forming a [[market structure]], interact within a [[Market (economics)|market]] to create a [[market system]]. These entities include private and public players with various classifications, typically operating under scarcity of tradable units and light [[government regulation]].{{clarify|date=July 2017}} The item traded may be a tangible [[product (business)|product]] such as apples or a [[Service (economics)|service]] such as repair services, legal counsel, or entertainment.

In theory, in a [[free market]] the [[Aggregation problem|aggregates]] (sum of) of ''quantity demanded'' by buyers and ''quantity supplied'' by sellers may reach [[economic equilibrium]] over time in reaction to price changes; in practice, various issues may prevent equilibrium, and any equilibrium reached may not necessarily be [[Equity (economics)|morally equitable]]. For example, if the supply of healthcare services is limited by [[exogenous|external factors]], the equilibrium price may be unaffordable for many who desire it but cannot pay for it.

Various market structures exist. In [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive markets]], no participants are large enough to have the [[market power]] to set the price of a homogeneous product. In other words, every participant is a "price taker" as no participant influences the price of a product. In the real world, markets often experience [[imperfect competition]].

Forms include [[monopoly]] (in which there is only one seller of a good), [[duopoly]] (in which there are only two sellers of a good), oligopoly (in which there are few sellers of a good), [[monopolistic competition]] (in which there are many sellers producing highly differentiated goods), [[monopsony]] (in which there is only one buyer of a good), and [[oligopsony]] (in which there are few buyers of a good). Unlike perfect competition, imperfect competition invariably means market power is unequally distributed. Firms under imperfect competition have the potential to be "price makers", which means that, by holding a disproportionately high share of market power, they can influence the prices of their products.

Microeconomics studies individual markets by simplifying the economic system by assuming that activity in the market being analysed does not affect other markets. This method of analysis is known as [[supply and demand|partial-equilibrium]] analysis (supply and demand). This method aggregates (the sum of all activity) in only one market. [[General equilibrium|General-equilibrium]] theory studies various markets and their behaviour. It aggregates (the sum of all activity) across ''all'' markets. This method studies both changes in markets and their interactions leading towards equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;• {{harvp|Blaug|2017|pp=347–349}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Hal R.

===Production, cost, and efficiency===
{{Main|Production theory basics|Opportunity cost|Economic efficiency|Production–possibility frontier}}
In microeconomics, [[Production (economics)|production]] is the conversion of [[factor of production|inputs]] into [[Output (economics)|outputs]]. It is an economic process that uses inputs to create a [[good (economics)|commodity]] or a service for [[trade|exchange]] or direct use. Production is a [[Stock and flow|flow]] and thus a rate of output per period of time. Distinctions include such production alternatives as for [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] (food, haircuts, etc.) vs. [[Investment#In economics or macroeconomics|investment goods]] (new tractors, buildings, roads, etc.), [[public good]]s (national defence, smallpox vaccinations, etc.) or [[private good]]s (new computers, bananas, etc.), and [[Guns versus butter model|"guns" vs "butter"]].

[[Opportunity cost]] is the [[economic cost]] of production: the value of the next best opportunity foregone. Choices must be made between desirable yet [[mutually exclusive]] actions. It has been described as expressing "the basic relationship between [[scarcity]] and [[choice]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=James M. Buchanan |last=Buchanan |first=James M. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman  |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001612 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3206|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=1 |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Opportunity cost }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a baker uses a sack of flour to make pretzels one morning, then the baker cannot use either the flour or the morning to make bagels instead.  Part of the cost of making pretzels is that neither the flour nor the morning are available any longer, for use in some other way.  The opportunity cost of an activity is an element in ensuring that scarce resources are used efficiently, such that the cost is weighed against the value of that activity in deciding on more or less of it. Opportunity costs are not restricted to monetary or financial costs but could be measured by the [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real cost]] of [[Production-possibility frontier#Opportunity cost|output forgone]], [[leisure]], or anything else that provides the alternative benefit ([[utility]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=[[The Economist]] Economics A-Z |url=http://www.economist.com/research/Economics/searchActionTerms.cfm?query=OPPORTUNITY+COST |title=Opportunity Cost |access-date=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inputs used in the production process include such primary [[factors of production]] as [[Labour (economics)|labour services]], [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (durable produced goods used in production, such as an existing factory), and [[Land (economics)|land]] (including natural resources). Other inputs may include [[intermediate good]]s used in production of final goods, such as the steel in a new car.

[[Economic efficiency]] measures how well a system generates desired output with a given set of inputs and available [[technology]]. Efficiency is improved if more output is generated without changing inputs, or in other words, the amount of "waste" is reduced. A widely accepted general standard is [[Pareto efficiency]], which is reached when no further change can make someone better off without making someone else worse off.

[[File:Production Possibilities Frontier Curve.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|An example [[production–possibility frontier]] with illustrative points marked.]]
The [[production–possibility frontier]] (PPF) is an expository figure for representing scarcity, cost, and efficiency. In the simplest case an [[economy]] can produce just two goods (say "guns" and "butter"). The PPF is a table or graph (as at the right) showing the different quantity combinations of the two goods producible with a given technology and total factor inputs, which limit feasible total output. Each point on the curve shows [[Potential output|potential total output]] for the economy, which is the maximum feasible output of one good, given a feasible output quantity of the other good.

[[Scarcity]] is represented in the figure by people being willing but unable in the aggregate to consume ''beyond the PPF'' (such as at ''X'') and by the negative slope of the curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Montani |first=Guido |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001949 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3485|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=1 |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Scarcity }}&lt;/ref&gt; If production of one good ''increases'' along the curve, production of the other good ''decreases'', an [[inverse relationship]]. This is because increasing output of one good requires transferring inputs to it from production of the other good, decreasing the latter.

The [[slope]] of the curve at a point on it gives the [[trade-off#Examples from common life|trade-off]] between the two goods. It measures what an additional unit of one good costs in units forgone of the other good, an example of a ''real opportunity cost''. Thus, if one more Gun costs 100 units of butter, the opportunity cost of one Gun is 100 Butter. ''Along the PPF'', scarcity implies that choosing ''more'' of one good in the aggregate entails doing with ''less'' of the other good. Still, in a [[market economy]], movement along the curve may indicate that the [[utility|choice]] of the increased output is anticipated to be worth the cost to the agents.

By construction, each point on the curve shows ''[[productive efficiency]]'' in maximizing output for given total inputs. A point ''inside'' the curve (as at ''A''), is feasible but represents ''production inefficiency'' (wasteful use of inputs), in that output of ''one or both goods'' could increase by moving in a northeast direction to a point on the curve. Examples cited of such inefficiency include high [[unemployment]] during a [[business cycle|business-cycle]] [[recession]] or economic organization of a country that discourages full use of resources. Being on the curve might still not fully satisfy [[allocative efficiency]] (also called [[Pareto efficiency]]) if it does not produce a mix of goods that consumers prefer over other points.

Much [[applied economics]] in [[public policy]] is concerned with determining how the efficiency of an economy can be improved. Recognizing the reality of scarcity and then figuring out how to organize society for the most efficient use of resources has been described as the "essence of economics", where the subject "makes its unique contribution."{{sfnp|Samuelson|Nordhaus|2004|loc= ch. 1, p. 5 (quotation) and sect. C,"The Production-Possibility Frontier", pp. 9–15; ch. 2, "Efficiency" sect.; ch. 8, sect. D, "The Concept of Efficiency}}

===Specialization===
{{Main|Division of labour|Comparative advantage|Gains from trade}}

[[File:Late Medieval Trade Routes.jpg|thumb|upright=2.05|A map showing the main [[trade route]]s for goods within [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval Europe]].]]
Specialization is considered key to economic efficiency based on theoretical and [[empirical]] considerations. Different individuals or nations may have different real opportunity costs of production, say from differences in [[stock and flow|stocks]] of [[human capital]] per worker or [[capital (economics)|capital]]/[[labor force|labour]] ratios. According to theory, this may give a [[comparative advantage]] in production of goods that make more intensive use of the relatively more abundant, thus ''relatively'' cheaper, input.

Even if one region has an [[absolute advantage]] as to the ratio of its outputs to inputs in every type of output, it may still specialize in the output in which it has a comparative advantage and thereby gain from trading with a region that lacks any absolute advantage but has a comparative advantage in producing something else.

It has been observed that a high volume of trade occurs among regions even with access to a similar technology and mix of factor inputs, including high-income countries. This has led to investigation of economies of [[Returns to scale|scale]] and [[economies of agglomeration|agglomeration]] to explain specialization in similar but differentiated product lines, to the overall benefit of respective trading parties or regions.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite journal |author-link=Paul Krugman |last=Krugman |first=Paul |date=December 1980 |title=Scale Economies, Product Differentiation, and the Pattern of Trade |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=70 |issue=5 |pp=950–999 |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~pkrugman/scale_econ.pdf |jstor=1805774}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite encyclopedia |first=William C. |last=Strange |date=2008 |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |edition=second |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_U000064 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.1769|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=533–536 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=Urban agglomeration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general theory of specialization applies to trade among individuals, farms, manufacturers, [[Service (economics)|service]] providers, and [[economy|economies]]. Among each of these production systems, there may be a corresponding ''[[division of labour]]'' with different work groups specializing, or correspondingly different types of [[Capital (economics)|capital equipment]] and differentiated [[Land (economics)|land]] uses.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |last=Groenewegen |first=Peter |date=2008 |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |edition=second |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_D000176 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.0401|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=517–526 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=Division of labour }}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite web |last=Johnson |first=Paul M. |date=2005 |url=http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/specialization |title=Specialization |website=A Glossary of Political Economy Terms |publisher=Department of Political Science, [[Auburn University]]}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite book|last1=Yang|first1=Xiaokai|last2=Ng|first2=Yew-Kwang|title=Specialization and Economic Organization: A New Classical Microeconomic Framework|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xuG4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP1|year=1993|publisher=North-Holland|isbn=978-0-444-88698-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example that combines features above is a country that specializes in the production of high-tech knowledge products, as developed countries do, and trades with developing nations for goods produced in factories where labour is relatively cheap and plentiful, resulting in different in opportunity costs of production. More total output and utility thereby results from specializing in production and trading than if each country produced its own high-tech and low-tech products.

Theory and observation set out the conditions such that market [[price]]s of outputs and productive inputs select an allocation of factor inputs by comparative advantage, so that (relatively) [[Production-possibility frontier#Opportunity cost|low-cost]] inputs go to producing low-cost outputs. In the process, aggregate output may increase as a [[invisible hand|by-product]] or by [[mechanism design|design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cameron|first=Rondo E.|authorlink=Rondo Cameron|title=A Concise Economic History of the World: From Paleolithic Times to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aEHX63g1XsYC&amp;pg=PA25|edition=second|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-507445-1|pages=25–25, 32, 276–280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such specialization of production creates opportunities for [[gains from trade]] whereby resource owners benefit from [[trade]] in the sale of one type of output for other, more highly valued goods.

===Supply and demand===
{{Main|Supply and demand}}
[[File:Supply-demand-right-shift-demand.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|The [[supply and demand]] model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between product availability and demand. The graph depicts an increase (that is, right-shift) in demand from D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; along with the consequent increase in price and quantity required to reach a new equilibrium point on the supply curve (S).|alt=A graph depicting Quantity on the X-axis and Price on the Y-axis]]

[[Prices and quantities]] have been described as the most directly observable attributes of goods produced and exchanged in a [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Brody |first=A. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics  |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001748 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3325|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=1 |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Prices and quantities }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of supply and demand is an organizing principle for explaining how prices coordinate the amounts produced and consumed. In [[microeconomics]], it applies to price and output determination for a market with [[perfect competition]], which includes the condition of no buyers or sellers large enough to have price-setting [[market power|power]].

For a given market of a [[Good (economics and accounting)|commodity]], ''demand'' is the relation of the quantity that all buyers would be prepared to purchase at each unit price of the good. Demand is often represented by a table or a graph showing price and quantity demanded (as in the figure). [[consumer theory|Demand theory]] describes individual consumers as [[rational choice theory|rationally]] choosing the most preferred quantity of each good, given income, prices, tastes, etc. A term for this is "constrained utility maximization" (with income and [[Wealth (economics)|wealth]] as the [[budget constraint|constraints]] on demand). Here, [[utility]] refers to the hypothesized relation of each individual consumer for ranking different commodity bundles as more or less preferred.

The [[law of demand]] states that, in general, price and quantity demanded in a given market are inversely related. That is, the higher the price of a product, the less of it people would be prepared to buy (other things [[ceteris paribus|unchanged]]). As the price of a commodity falls, consumers move toward it from relatively more expensive goods (the [[substitution effect]]). In addition, [[purchasing power]] from the price decline increases ability to buy (the [[income effect]]). Other factors can change demand; for example an increase in income will shift the demand curve for a [[normal good]] outward relative to the origin, as in the figure. All determinants are predominantly taken as constant factors of demand and supply.

''Supply'' is the relation between the price of a good and the quantity available for sale at that price. It may be represented as a table or graph relating price and quantity supplied. Producers, for example business firms, are hypothesized to be ''profit maximizers'', meaning that they attempt to produce and supply the amount of goods that will bring them the highest profit. Supply is typically represented as a function relating price and quantity, if other factors are unchanged.

That is, the higher the price at which the good can be sold, the more of it producers will supply, as in the figure. The higher price makes it profitable to increase production. Just as on the demand side, the position of the supply can shift, say from a change in the price of a productive input or a technical improvement. The "Law of Supply" states that, in general, a rise in price leads to an expansion in supply and a fall in price leads to a contraction in supply. Here as well, the determinants of supply, such as price of substitutes, cost of production, technology applied and various factors inputs of production are all taken to be constant for a specific time period of evaluation of supply.

[[Market equilibrium]] occurs where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, the intersection of the supply and demand curves in the figure above. At a price below equilibrium, there is a shortage of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This is posited to bid the price up. At a price above equilibrium, there is a surplus of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This pushes the price down. The [[Model (economics)|model]] of supply and demand predicts that for given supply and demand curves, price and quantity will stabilize at the price that makes quantity supplied equal to quantity demanded. Similarly, demand-and-supply theory predicts a new price-quantity combination from a shift in demand (as to the figure), or in supply.

For a given quantity of a consumer good, the point on the demand curve indicates the value, or [[marginal utility]], to consumers for that unit. It measures what the consumer would be prepared to pay for that unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=William Baumol |last=Baumol |first=William J. |date=28 April 2016 |title=Utility and Value |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/utility-economics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding point on the supply curve measures [[marginal cost]], the increase in total cost to the supplier for the corresponding unit of the good. The price in equilibrium is determined by supply and demand. In a [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive market]], supply and demand equate marginal cost and marginal utility at equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Hicks"&gt;{{cite book |title=Value and Capital: An Inquiry into Some Fundamental Principles of Economic Theory |last=Hicks |first=J.R. |authorlink=John Hicks|orig-year=1939 |publisher=Oxford University Press |edition=second |date=2001 |location=London |isbn=978-0-19-828269-3|title-link=Value and Capital }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the supply side of the market, some factors of production are described as (relatively) ''variable'' in the [[short run]], which affects the cost of changing output levels. Their usage rates can be changed easily, such as electrical power, raw-material inputs, and over-time and temp work. Other inputs are relatively ''fixed'', such as plant and equipment and key personnel. In the [[long run]], all inputs may be adjusted by [[management]]. These distinctions translate to differences in the [[Price elasticity of supply|elasticity]] (responsiveness) of the supply curve in the short and long runs and corresponding differences in the price-quantity change from a shift on the supply or demand side of the market.

[[marginalism|Marginalist theory]], such as above, describes the consumers as attempting to reach most-preferred positions, subject to [[Income#Meaning in economics and use in economic theory|income]] and [[Wealth (economics)|wealth]] constraints while producers attempt to maximize profits subject to their own constraints, including demand for goods produced, technology, and the price of inputs. For the consumer, that point comes where marginal utility of a good, net of price, reaches zero, leaving no net gain from further consumption increases. Analogously, the producer compares [[marginal revenue]] (identical to price for the perfect competitor) against the [[marginal cost]] of a good, with ''marginal profit'' the difference. At the point where marginal profit reaches zero, further increases in production of the good stop. For movement to market equilibrium and for changes in equilibrium, price and quantity also change "at the margin": more-or-less of something, rather than necessarily all-or-nothing.

Other applications of demand and supply include the [[Distribution (economics)|distribution of income]] among the [[factors of production]], including labour and capital, through factor markets. In a competitive [[labour market]] for example the quantity of labour employed and the price of labour (the wage rate) depends on the [[Labour economics#Neoclassical microeconomic model&amp;nbsp;— Demand|demand for labour]] (from employers for production) and supply of labour (from potential workers). [[Labour economics]] examines the interaction of workers and employers through such markets to explain patterns and changes of wages and other labour income, [[labour mobility]], and (un)employment, productivity through [[human capital]], and related public-policy issues.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Richard B.

Demand-and-supply analysis is used to explain the behaviour of perfectly competitive markets, but as a standard of comparison it can be extended to any type of market. It can also be generalized to explain variables across the [[economy]], for example, total output (estimated as [[real GDP]]) and the general [[price level]], as studied in [[macroeconomics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Olivier Blanchard |last=Blanchard |first=Olivier |date=2006 |edition=4th |title=Macroeconomics |chapter=Chapter 7: Putting All Markets Together: The AS–AD Model |publisher=Prentice-Hall |isbn=978-0-1318-6026-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracing the [[qualitative economics|qualitative]] and quantitative effects of variables that change supply and demand, whether in the short or long run, is a standard exercise in [[applied economics]].

===Firms===
{{Main|Theory of the firm|Industrial organization|Business economics|Managerial economics}}

People frequently do not trade directly on markets. Instead, on the supply side, they may work in and produce through ''firms''. The most obvious kinds of firms are [[corporation]]s, [[partnerships]] and [[trusts]]. According to [[Ronald Coase]], people begin to organize their production in firms when the costs of doing business becomes lower than doing it on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coase |first=Ronald | author-link=Ronald Coase |year=1937 |title=The Nature of the Firm |journal=[[Economica]] |volume=4 |issue=16 |pages=386–405 |jstor=2626876 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x|title-link=The Nature of the Firm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firms combine labour and capital, and can achieve far greater [[economies of scale]] (when the average cost per unit declines as more units are produced) than individual market trading.

In [[perfect competition|perfectly competitive]] markets studied in the theory of supply and demand, there are many producers, none of which significantly influence price. [[Industrial organization]] generalizes from that special case to study the strategic behaviour of firms that do have significant control of price. It considers the structure of such markets and their interactions. Common market structures studied besides perfect competition include monopolistic competition, various forms of oligopoly, and monopoly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Schmalensee |first=Richard |author-link=Richard L.

[[Managerial economics]] applies [[microeconomic]] analysis to specific decisions in business firms or other management units. It draws heavily from quantitative methods such as [[operations research]] and programming and from statistical methods such as [[regression analysis]] in the absence of certainty and perfect knowledge. A unifying theme is the attempt to [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimize]] business decisions, including unit-cost minimization and profit maximization, given the firm's objectives and constraints imposed by technology and market conditions.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |author=&lt;!-- Staff Writers --&gt; |date=5 May 2013 |title=Managerial Economics |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/managerial-economics}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite encyclopedia |last=Hughes |first=Alan |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics  |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001379 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3017|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=1 |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Managerial capitalism }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uncertainty and game theory ===
{{Main|Information economics|Game theory|Financial economics}}
[[Uncertainty]] in economics is an unknown prospect of gain or loss, whether quantifiable as [[Risk#Risk versus uncertainty|risk]] or not.

[[Game theory]] is a branch of [[applied mathematics]] that considers [[Strategy#Strategies in game theory|strategic interactions]] between agents, one kind of uncertainty. It provides a mathematical [[microfoundation|foundation]] of [[industrial organization]], discussed above, to model different types of firm behaviour, for example in an solipsistic industry (few sellers), but equally applicable to wage negotiations, [[Bargaining#Game theory|bargaining]], [[Contract theory|contract design]], and any situation where individual agents are few enough to have perceptible effects on each other. In [[behavioural economics]], it has been used to model the strategies [[Agent (economics)|agents]] choose when interacting with others whose interests are at least partially adverse to their own.&lt;ref&gt;• {{harvp|Samuelson|Nordhaus|2004|loc=ch. 11, "Uncertainty and Game Theory" and [end] Glossary of Terms, "Economics of information", "Game theory", and "Regulation"}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite book |last=Camerer |first=Colin F. |author-link=Colin F.

In this, it generalizes maximization approaches developed to analyse market actors such as in the [[supply and demand]] model and allows for incomplete information of actors. The field dates from the 1944 classic ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' by [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]].

[[Risk aversion]] may stimulate activity that in well-functioning markets smooths out risk and communicates information about risk, as in markets for [[insurance]], commodity [[futures market|futures contracts]], and [[financial instruments]].

Some market organizations may give rise to inefficiencies associated with uncertainty. Based on [[George Akerlof]]'s "[[Market for Lemons]]" article, the [[paradigm]] example is of a dodgy second-hand car market. Customers without knowledge of whether a car is a "lemon" depress its price below what a quality second-hand car would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Akerlof |first=George A. |date=August 1970 |title=The Market for 'Lemons': Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=488–500 |jstor=1879431 |doi=10.2307/1879431 |url=http://hydrogen.its.ucdavis.edu/eec/education/EEC-classes/eeclimate/class-readings/akerlof-the%20market%20for%20lemons.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818045155/http://hydrogen.its.ucdavis.edu/eec/education/EEC-classes/eeclimate/class-readings/akerlof-the%20market%20for%20lemons.pdf |archive-date=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Information asymmetry]] arises here, if the seller has more relevant information than the buyer but no incentive to disclose it. Related problems in insurance are [[adverse selection]], such that those at most risk are most likely to insure (say reckless drivers), and [[moral hazard]], such that insurance results in riskier behaviour (say more reckless driving).&lt;ref name="sciencedirect"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Lippman |first1=S.S. |title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences |pages=7480–7486 |first2=J.J. |last2=McCall |date=2001 |work=[[International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences]] |publisher=Elsevier |doi=10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/02244-0|isbn=9780080430768 |chapter=Information, Economics of }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both problems may raise insurance costs and reduce efficiency by driving otherwise willing transactors from the market ("[[incomplete markets]]"). Moreover, attempting to reduce one problem, say adverse selection by mandating insurance, may add to another, say moral hazard.

===Market failure===
{{Main|Market failure|Government failure|Information economics|Environmental economics|Agricultural economics}}
[[File:Smokestack in Detroit.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Pollution]] can be a simple example of market failure. If [[costs of production]] are not borne by producers but are by the environment, accident victims or others, then prices are distorted.|alt=A smokestack releasing smoke]]

The term "[[market failure]]" encompasses several problems which may undermine standard economic assumptions. Although economists categorize market failures differently, the following categories emerge in the main texts.{{efn|Compare with [[Nicholas Barr]] (2004), whose list of market failures is melded with failures of economic assumptions, which are (1) producers as price takers (i.e. presence of oligopoly or monopoly; but why is this not a product of the following?) (2) equal power of consumers (what labour lawyers call an imbalance of bargaining power) (3) complete markets (4) public goods (5) external effects (i.e. externalities?) (6) increasing returns to scale (i.e. practical monopoly) (7) perfect information (in {{cite book |title=The Economics of the Welfare State |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gWxfQgAACAAJ&amp;pg=PP1 |edition=4th |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-926497-1 |pages=72–79}}).&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] (2015) classifies market failures as from failure of competition (including [[natural monopoly]]), [[information asymmetries]], [[incomplete markets]], [[externalities]], [[public good]] situations, and [[macroeconomic]] disturbances (in {{cite book |title=Economics of the Public Sector: Fourth International Student Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=miPeCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1 |edition=4th |year=2015 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |isbn=978-0-393-93709-1 |pages=81–100 |chapter=Chapter 4: Market Failure}}).}}

[[Information asymmetries]] and [[incomplete markets]] may result in economic inefficiency but also a possibility of improving efficiency through market, legal, and regulatory remedies, as discussed above.

[[Natural monopoly]], or the overlapping concepts of "practical" and "technical" monopoly, is an extreme case of ''failure of competition'' as a restraint on producers. Extreme [[economies of scale]] are one possible cause.

[[Public goods]] are goods which are under-supplied in a typical market. The defining features are that people can consume public goods without having to pay for them and that more than one person can consume the good at the same time.

[[Externalities]] occur where there are significant social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not reflected in market prices. For example, air pollution may generate a negative externality, and education may generate a positive externality (less crime, etc.). Governments often tax and otherwise restrict the sale of goods that have negative externalities and subsidize or otherwise promote the purchase of goods that have positive externalities in an effort to correct the price [[distortions (economics)|distortions]] caused by these externalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Jean-Jacques Laffont |last=Laffont |first=J.J. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |pages=263–265 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X000773 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.2520|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Externalities }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elementary demand-and-supply theory predicts equilibrium but not the speed of adjustment for changes of equilibrium due to a shift in demand or supply.{{sfn|Blaug|2017|p=347}}

In many areas, some form of [[price stickiness]] is postulated to account for quantities, rather than prices, adjusting in the short run to changes on the demand side or the supply side. This includes standard analysis of the [[business cycle]] in [[macroeconomics]]. Analysis often revolves around causes of such price stickiness and their implications for reaching a hypothesized long-run equilibrium. Examples of such price stickiness in particular markets include wage rates in labour markets and posted prices in markets [[Imperfect competition|deviating]] from [[perfect competition]].

===Public sector===
{{Main|Economics of the public sector|Public finance}}
{{See also|Welfare economics}}
Public finance is the field of economics that deals with [[budget]]ing the revenues and expenditures of a [[public sector]] entity, usually government. The subject addresses such matters as [[tax incidence]] (who really pays a particular tax), cost-benefit analysis of government programmes, effects on [[economic efficiency]] and [[income distribution]] of different kinds of spending and taxes, and fiscal politics. The latter, an aspect of [[public choice theory]], models public-sector behaviour analogously to microeconomics, involving interactions of self-interested voters, politicians, and bureaucrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Musgrave |first1=Richard A. |title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |author-link=Richard Musgrave (economist) |pp=1055–1060 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001795 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3360|isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Public finance }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of economics is [[positive economics|positive]], seeking to describe and predict economic phenomena. [[Normative economics]] seeks to identify what economies ''ought'' to be like.

Welfare economics is a normative branch of economics that uses [[microeconomics|microeconomic]] techniques to simultaneously determine the [[allocative efficiency]] within an economy and the income [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]] associated with it. It attempts to measure [[social welfare]] by examining the economic activities of the individuals that comprise society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Feldman |first1=Allan M. |title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |pp=889–095 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X002306 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3785|isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Welfare economics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Macroeconomics==
[[File:DiagFuncMacroSyst.pdf|thumb|upright=2.05|[[Circular flow of income|The circulation of money in an economy]] in a macroeconomic model.]]
{{Main|Macroeconomics}}

Macroeconomics examines the economy as a whole to explain broad aggregates and their interactions "top down", that is, using a simplified form of [[General equilibrium|general-equilibrium]] theory.{{sfnp|Blaug|2017|p=345}} Such aggregates include [[measures of national income and output|national income and output]], the [[unemployment rate]], and price [[inflation]] and subaggregates like total consumption and investment spending and their components. It also studies effects of [[monetary policy]] and [[fiscal policy]].

Since at least the 1960s, macroeconomics has been characterized by further integration as to [[microfoundations|micro-based]] modelling of sectors, including [[rational expectations|rationality]] of players, [[Efficient market hypothesis|efficient use]] of market information, and [[imperfect competition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Business Confidence and Depression Prevention: A Mesoeconomic Perspective |last=Ng |first=Yew-Kwang |authorlink=Yew-Kwang Ng |journal=[[The American Economic Review]] |issn=0002-8282 |volume=82 |issue=2 |date=May 1992 |pages=365–371 |jstor=2117429}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has addressed a long-standing concern about inconsistent developments of the same subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Howitt |first=Peter M. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |pages=  273–276 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001367 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3008|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Macroeconomics: Relations with microeconomics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macroeconomic analysis also considers factors affecting the long-term level and [[economic growth|growth]] of national income. Such factors include capital accumulation, [[Technological progress|technological change]] and [[labour force]] growth.{{sfnp|Blaug|2017|p=349}}

===Growth===
{{Main|Economic growth}}

''Growth economics'' studies factors that explain [[economic growth]]&amp;nbsp;– the increase in output ''[[per capita]]'' of a country over a long period of time. The same factors are used to explain differences in the ''level'' of output ''per capita'' ''between'' countries, in particular why some countries grow faster than others, and whether countries [[catch-up effect|converge]] at the same rates of growth.

Much-studied factors include the rate of [[Investment (macroeconomics)|investment]], [[population growth]], and [[Technological progress|technological change]]. These are represented in theoretical and [[empirical]] forms (as in the [[neoclassical growth model|neoclassical]] and [[endogenous growth model|endogenous]] growth models) and in [[growth accounting]].&lt;ref&gt;• {{harvp|Samuelson|Nordhaus|2004|loc=ch. 27, "The Process of Economic Growth"}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Hirofumi Uzawa |last=Uzawa |first=H. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |pages=483–489 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001477 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3097|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Models of growth }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business cycle===
{{Main|Business cycle}}
{{See also|Circular flow of income|Aggregate supply|Aggregate demand|Unemployment}}

[[File:Economic cycle.svg|thumb|upright=2.05|A basic illustration of [[Business cycle|economic/business cycles]].]]

The economics of a depression were the spur for the creation of "macroeconomics" as a separate discipline field of study. During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, [[John Maynard Keynes]] authored a book entitled ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'' outlining the key theories of [[Keynesian economics]]. Keynes contended that [[aggregate demand]] for goods might be insufficient during economic downturns, leading to unnecessarily high unemployment and losses of potential output.

He therefore advocated active policy responses by the [[public sector]], including [[monetary policy]] actions by the [[central bank]] and [[fiscal policy]] actions by the government to stabilize output over the [[business cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Sullivan |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |first2=Steven M. |last2=Sheffrin |authorlink2=Steven M. Sheffrin |title=Economics: Principles in Action |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2003  |page=396 |isbn=978-0-13-063085-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, a central conclusion of Keynesian economics is that, in some situations, no strong automatic mechanism moves output and employment towards [[full employment]] levels. [[John Hicks]]' [[IS/LM]] model has been the most influential interpretation of ''The General Theory''.

Over the years, understanding of the [[business cycle]] has branched into various [[research program]]mes, mostly related to or distinct from Keynesianism. The [[neoclassical synthesis]] refers to the reconciliation of Keynesian economics with [[neoclassical economics]], stating that Keynesianism is correct in the [[short run]] but qualified by neoclassical-like considerations in the intermediate and [[long run]].&lt;ref name="Blanchard2008"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Olivier J. Blanchard |last=Blanchard |first=Olivier Jean |date=2008 |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |edition=second |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_N000041 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.1172|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=896–899 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=Neoclassical synthesis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New classical macroeconomics]], as distinct from the Keynesian view of the business cycle, posits [[market clearing]] with [[imperfect information]]. It includes Friedman's [[permanent income hypothesis]] on consumption and "[[rational expectations]]" theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economics.harvard.edu/files/faculty/40_Macroeconomist_as_Scientist.pdf |title=The Macroeconomist as Scientist and Engineer |first=N. Gregory |last=Mankiw |publisher=Harvard University |date=May 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118103900/http://www.economics.harvard.edu/files/faculty/40_Macroeconomist_as_Scientist.pdf |archive-date=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; led by [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]], and [[real business cycle theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Stanley Fischer |last=Fischer |first=Stanley |date=2008 |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |edition=second |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_N000056 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.1180|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=17–22 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=New classical macroeconomics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the [[New Keynesian economics|new Keynesian]] approach retains the rational expectations assumption, however it assumes a variety of [[market failures]]. In particular, New Keynesians assume prices and wages are "[[Sticky (economics)|sticky]]", which means they do not adjust instantaneously to changes in economic conditions.&lt;ref name="Dixon2008"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Dixon |first=Huw David |date=2008 |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |edition=second |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_N000166 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.1184|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=40–45 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=New Keynesian macroeconomics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the new classicals assume that prices and wages adjust automatically to attain full employment, whereas the new Keynesians see full employment as being automatically achieved only in the long run, and hence government and central-bank policies are needed because the "long run" may be very long.

=== Unemployment ===
{{Main|Unemployment}}
[[File:US employment 1995-2012.png|thumb|upright=2.05|The percentage of the [[Unemployment in the United States|US population employed]], 1995–2012.]]
The amount of unemployment in an economy is measured by the unemployment rate, the percentage of workers without jobs in the labour force. The labour force only includes workers actively looking for jobs. People who are retired, pursuing education, or [[discouraged worker|discouraged from seeking work]] by a lack of job prospects are excluded from the labour force. Unemployment can be generally broken down into several types that are related to different causes.&lt;ref name=Dwivedi443&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dwivedi|first=D. N.|title=Macroeconomics: Theory and Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1eFyp9Iku8C&amp;pg=PP1|year=2005|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-058841-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical models of unemployment occurs when wages are too high for employers to be willing to hire more workers. Wages may be too high because of minimum wage laws or union activity. Consistent with classical unemployment, frictional unemployment occurs when appropriate job vacancies exist for a worker, but the length of time needed to search for and find the job leads to a period of unemployment.&lt;ref name=Dwivedi443/&gt;

[[Structural unemployment]] covers a variety of possible causes of unemployment including a mismatch between workers' skills and the skills required for open jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Freeman |first=C. |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |date=2008 |edition=second|url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000311 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.1641|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=64–66 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=Structural unemployment }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large amounts of structural unemployment can occur when an economy is transitioning industries and workers find their previous set of skills are no longer in demand. Structural unemployment is similar to frictional unemployment since both reflect the problem of matching workers with job vacancies, but structural unemployment covers the time needed to acquire new skills not just the short term search process.{{sfnp|Dwivedi|2005|pp=444–445}}

While some types of unemployment may occur regardless of the condition of the economy, cyclical unemployment occurs when growth stagnates. [[Okun's law]] represents the empirical relationship between unemployment and economic growth.{{sfnp|Dwivedi|2005|pp=445–446}} The original version of Okun's law states that a 3% increase in output would lead to a 1% decrease in unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Neely |first=Christopher J. |url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/es/10/ES1004.pdf |title=Okun's Law: Output and Unemployment |journal=Economic Synopses |volume=Number 4 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inflation and monetary policy===
{{Main|Inflation|Monetary policy}}
{{See also|Money|Quantity theory of money|History of money}}

[[Money]] is a ''means of final payment'' for goods in most [[price system]] economies, and is the [[unit of account]] in which prices are typically stated. Money has general acceptability, relative consistency in value, divisibility, durability, portability, elasticity in supply, and longevity with mass public confidence. It includes currency held by the nonbank public and checkable deposits. It has been described as a social convention, like language, useful to one largely because it is useful to others. In the words of [[Francis Amasa Walker]], a well-known 19th-century economist, "Money is what money does" ("Money is ''that'' money does" in the original).&lt;ref name="Walker1891"&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis Amasa Walker|authorlink=Francis Amasa Walker|title=Money|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MJYSvaRqcwC|accessdate=5 November 2017|year=1878|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|location=New York|page=405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[medium of exchange]], money facilitates trade. It is essentially a measure of value and more importantly, a store of value being a basis for credit creation. Its economic function can be contrasted with [[barter]] (non-monetary exchange). Given a diverse array of produced goods and specialized producers, barter may entail a hard-to-locate [[double coincidence of wants]] as to what is exchanged, say apples and a book. Money can reduce the [[transaction cost]] of exchange because of its ready acceptability. Then it is less costly for the seller to accept money in exchange, rather than what the buyer produces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=James Tobin |last=Tobin |first=James |date=1992 |title=Money (Money as a Social Institution and Public Good) |work=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Finance and Money |volume=Volume 2 |editor-first1=Peter K. |editor-last1=Newman |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=John |editor-last3=Eatwell |pp=770–771 |isbn=978-1-5615-9041-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b0UOAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the level of an [[economy]], [[quantity theory of money|theory]] and evidence are consistent with a [[positive relationship]] running from the total [[money supply]] to the [[nominal value]] of total output and to the general [[price level]]. For this reason, management of the [[money supply]] is a key aspect of [[monetary policy]].&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |last=Friedman |first=Milton |author-link=Milton Friedman |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell  |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter K. |editor-last3=Newman

===Fiscal policy===
{{Main|Fiscal policy|Government spending|Taxation}}

Governments implement fiscal policy to influence macroeconomic conditions by adjusting spending and taxation policies to alter aggregate demand. When aggregate demand falls below the potential output of the economy, there is an [[output gap]] where some productive capacity is left unemployed. Governments increase spending and cut taxes to boost aggregate demand. Resources that have been idled can be used by the government.

For example, unemployed home builders can be hired to expand highways. Tax cuts allow consumers to increase their spending, which boosts aggregate demand. Both tax cuts and spending have [[Fiscal multiplier|multiplier effects]] where the initial increase in demand from the policy percolates through the economy and generates additional economic activity.

The effects of fiscal policy can be limited by [[Crowding out (economics)|crowding out]]. When there is no output gap, the economy is producing at full capacity and there are no excess productive resources. If the government increases spending in this situation, the government uses resources that otherwise would have been used by the private sector, so there is no increase in overall output. Some economists think that crowding out is always an issue while others do not think it is a major issue when output is depressed.

Sceptics of fiscal policy also make the argument of [[Ricardian equivalence]]. They argue that an increase in debt will have to be paid for with future tax increases, which will cause people to reduce their consumption and save money to pay for the future tax increase. Under Ricardian equivalence, any boost in demand from tax cuts will be offset by the increased saving intended to pay for future higher taxes.

Policy applications include estimating the effects of changing [[tariff]] rates and trade quotas.

Economic systems is the [[JEL classification codes#Economic systems JEL: P Subcategories|branch]] of economics that studies the methods and [[institutions]] by which societies determine the ownership, direction, and allocation of economic resources.

Among contemporary systems at different ends of the organizational spectrum are [[Planned economy|socialist systems]] and [[Capitalism|capitalist systems]], in which most production occurs in respectively state-run and private enterprises. In between are [[mixed economies]]. A common element is the interaction of economic and political influences, broadly described as [[Political economy#Current approaches|political economy]]. ''[[Comparative economic systems]]'' studies the relative performance and behaviour of different economies or systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Robert L.

===Theory===
Mainstream economic theory relies upon ''[[wikt:a priori|a priori]]'' quantitative [[model (economics)|economic models]], which employ a variety of concepts. Theory typically proceeds with an assumption of ''[[ceteris paribus]]'', which means holding constant explanatory variables other than the one under consideration.

In [[microeconomics]], principal concepts include [[supply and demand]], [[marginalism]], [[rational choice theory]], [[opportunity cost]], [[budget constraint]]s, [[utility]], and the [[theory of the firm]].&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |last=Boland |first=Lawrence A. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |volume=III |pp=455–458 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001456 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3083|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Methodology }}&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite journal |title=Consensus and Dissension among Economists: An Empirical Inquiry |last1=Frey |first1=Bruno S. |last2=Pommerehne |first2=Werner W. |last3=Schneider |first3=Friedrich |last4=Gilbert |first4=Guy |journal=[[The American Economic Review]] |issn=0002-8282 |volume=74 |issue=5 |date=December 1984 |pages=986–994 |jstor=557 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early [[macroeconomic]] models focused on modelling the relationships between aggregate variables, but as the relationships appeared to change over time macroeconomists, including [[new Keynesian]]s, reformulated their models in [[microfoundations]].&lt;ref name="Dixon2008"/&gt;

The aforementioned microeconomic concepts play a major part in macroeconomic models&amp;nbsp;– for instance, in [[monetary theory]], the [[quantity theory of money]] predicts that increases in the growth rate of the [[money supply]] increase [[inflation]], and inflation is assumed to be influenced by [[rational expectations]]. In [[development economics]], slower growth in developed nations has been sometimes predicted because of the declining marginal returns of investment and capital, and this has been observed in the [[Four Asian Tigers]].

Expositions of economic reasoning often use two-dimensional graphs to illustrate theoretical relationships. At a higher level of generality, [[Paul Samuelson]]'s treatise ''[[Foundations of Economic Analysis]]'' (1947) used mathematical methods beyond graphs to represent the theory, particularly as to maximizing behavioural relations of agents reaching equilibrium. The book focused on examining the class of statements called ''operationally meaningful theorems'' in economics, which are [[theorem]]s that can conceivably be refuted by empirical data.&lt;ref name="Foundations"&gt;{{cite book |title=Foundations of Economic Analysis, Enlarged Edition |last=Samuelson |first=Paul A. |authorlink=Paul Samuelson |origyear=1947 |year=1983 |page=4 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-674-31301-9|title-link=Foundations of Economic Analysis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic theories are frequently tested [[empirical]]ly, largely through the use of [[econometrics]] using [[economic data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hashem |first=M.

However, the field of [[experimental economics]] is growing, and increasing use is being made of [[natural experiments]].

[[Statistics|Statistical methods]] such as [[regression analysis]] are common. Practitioners use such methods to estimate the size, economic significance, and [[statistical significance]] ("signal strength") of the hypothesized relation(s) and to adjust for noise from other variables. By such means, a hypothesis may gain acceptance, although in a probabilistic, rather than certain, sense. Acceptance is dependent upon the [[falsifiability|falsifiable]] hypothesis surviving tests. Use of commonly accepted methods need not produce a final conclusion or even a consensus on a particular question, given different tests, [[data set]]s, and prior beliefs.

Criticisms based on professional standards and non-[[Replication (statistics)|replicability]] of results serve as further checks against bias, errors, and over-generalization,{{sfnp|Frey|Pommerehne|Schneider|Gilbert|1984|pages=986–994}}{{Sfnp|Blaug|2017|page=247}} although much economic research has been accused of being non-replicable, and prestigious journals have been accused of not facilitating replication through the provision of the code and data.&lt;ref name=McCullough2007&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCullough |first=B.D. |date=September 2007 |title=Got Replicability?

Two groups, later called "mercantilists" and "physiocrats", more directly influenced the subsequent development of the subject. Both groups were associated with the rise of [[economic nationalism]] and [[History of capitalism#Merchant capitalism and mercantilism|modern capitalism]] in Europe. [[Mercantilism]] was an economic doctrine that flourished from the 16th to 18th century in a prolific pamphlet literature, whether of merchants or statesmen. It held that a nation's wealth depended on its accumulation of gold and silver. Nations without access to mines could obtain gold and silver from trade only by selling goods abroad and restricting imports other than of gold and silver. The doctrine called for importing cheap raw materials to be used in manufacturing goods, which could be exported, and for state regulation to impose protective tariffs on foreign manufactured goods and prohibit manufacturing in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |title=Mercantilism |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=26 August 2016 |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/mercantilism}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{harvp|Blaug|2017|page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Physiocrats]], a group of 18th-century French thinkers and writers, developed the idea of the economy as a [[circular flow]] of income and output. Physiocrats believed that only agricultural production generated a clear surplus over cost, so that agriculture was the basis of all wealth. Thus, they opposed the mercantilist policy of promoting manufacturing and trade at the expense of agriculture, including import tariffs. Physiocrats advocated replacing administratively costly tax collections with a single tax on income of land owners. In reaction against copious mercantilist trade regulations, the physiocrats advocated a policy of ''[[laissez-faire]]'', which called for minimal government intervention in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |title=Physiocrat|work=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=7 March 2014 |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/physiocrat}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite book|last=Blaug|first=Mark|title=Economic Theory in Retrospect|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4nd6alor2goC&amp;pg=PA24|edition=fifth|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57701-4|pages=24–29, 82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of Adam Smith's ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' in 1776, has been described as "the effective birth of economics as a separate discipline."{{sfnp|Blaug|2017|p=343}} The book identified land, labour, and capital as the three factors of production and the major contributors to a nation's wealth, as distinct from the physiocratic idea that only agriculture was productive.

Smith discusses potential benefits of specialization by [[division of labour]], including increased [[labour productivity]] and [[gains from trade]], whether between town and country or across countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author-link=Alan Deardorff |last=Deardorff |first=Alan V. |date=2016 |title=Division of labor |website=Deardorffs'  Glossary of International Economics |publisher=University of Michigan |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/d.html#DivisionOfLabor}}&lt;/ref&gt; His "theorem" that "the division of labor is limited by the extent of the market" has been described as the "core of a [[Theory of the firm|theory of the functions of firm]] and [[industrial organization|industry]]" and a "fundamental principle of economic organization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-link=George J.

In an argument that includes "one of the most famous passages in all economics,"{{sfnp|Samuelson|Nordhaus|2004|p=30|loc=ch. 2, "Markets and Government in a Modern Economy", The Invisible Hand}} Smith represents every individual as trying to employ any capital they might command for their own advantage, not that of the society,{{efn|"Capital" in Smith's usage includes [[fixed capital]] and [[circulating capital]].

Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.{{sfnp|Smith|1776|loc=Bk. IV: Of Systems of political Œconomy, ch.

The [[Reverend|Rev.]] [[Thomas Robert Malthus]] (1798) used the concept of [[diminishing returns]] to explain low living standards. [[Human population]], he argued, tended to increase geometrically, outstripping the production of food, which increased arithmetically. The force of a rapidly growing population against a limited amount of land meant diminishing returns to labour. The result, he claimed, was chronically low wages, which prevented the standard of living for most of the population from rising above the subsistence level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Malthus |first=Thomas |date=1798 |title=An Essay on the Principle of Population |publisher=J.

While Adam Smith emphasized the production of income, [[David Ricardo]] (1817) focused on the distribution of income among landowners, workers, and capitalists. Ricardo saw an inherent conflict between landowners on the one hand and labour and capital on the other. He posited that the growth of population and capital, pressing against a fixed supply of land, pushes up rents and holds down wages and profits. Ricardo was the first to state and prove the principle of [[comparative advantage]], according to which each country should specialize in producing and exporting goods in that it has a lower ''relative'' cost of production, rather relying only on its own production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Ricardo |date=1817 |title=On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation |publisher=John Murray|title-link=On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been termed a "fundamental analytical explanation" for [[gains from trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Ronald Findlay |first=Ronald |last=Findlay |date=2008 |edition=second |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000254 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.0274|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=28–33 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=Comparative advantage }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming at the end of the classical tradition, John Stuart Mill (1848) parted company with the earlier classical economists on the inevitability of the distribution of income produced by the market system. Mill pointed to a distinct difference between the market's two roles: allocation of resources and distribution of income. The market might be efficient in allocating resources but not in distributing income, he wrote, making it necessary for society to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |date=1848 |title=Principles of Political Economy |publisher=John W. Parker Publisher|title-link=Principles of Political Economy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Value theory was important in classical theory. Smith wrote that the "real price of every thing&amp;nbsp;... is the toil and trouble of acquiring it". Smith maintained that, with rent and profit, other costs besides wages also enter the price of a commodity.{{sfnp|Smith|1776|loc=Bk. 1, Ch. 5, 6}} Other classical economists presented variations on Smith, termed the '[[labour theory of value#The theory's development|labour theory of value]]'. Classical economics focused on the tendency of any market economy to settle in a [[Steady-state economy#The stationary state in classical economics|final stationary state made up of a constant stock of physical wealth (capital) and a constant population size]].

===Marxism===

[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|upright|right|thumb|The Marxist school of economic thought comes from the work of German economist [[Karl Marx]].|alt=A man facing the viewer]]

Marxist (later, Marxian) economics descends from classical economics. It derives from the work of [[Karl Marx]]. The first volume of Marx's major work, ''[[Das Kapital]]'', was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the [[labour theory of value]] and the [[theory of surplus value]] which, he believed, explained the exploitation of labour by capital.&lt;ref name="Roemer"&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |author-link=John Roemer |last=Roemer |first=J.E. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman  |p=383 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001420 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3052|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Marxian value analysis }}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite encyclopedia |author-link=Ernest Mandel |last=Mandel |first=Ernest |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |pp=372, 376 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001419 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3051|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Marx, Karl Heinrich (1818–1883) }}&lt;/ref&gt; The labour theory of value held that the value of an exchanged commodity was determined by the labour that went into its production and the theory of surplus value demonstrated how the workers only got paid a proportion of the value their work had created.&lt;ref name="THOMAS FULLER"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/18/world/asia/18laos.html |work=The New York Times|first=Thomas |last=Fuller|title=Communism and Capitalism Are Mixing in Laos|date=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoclassical economics===
{{Main|Neoclassical economics}}

At the dawn as a social science, '''economics''' was defined and discussed at length as the study of production, distribution, and consumption of wealth by Jean-Baptiste Say in his ''Treatise on Political Economy or, The Production, Distribution, and Consumption of Wealth'' (1803). These three items are considered by the science only in relation to the increase or diminution of wealth, and not in reference to their processes of execution.{{efn|"This science indicates the cases in which commerce is truly productive, where whatever is gained by one is lost by another, and where it is profitable to all; it also teaches us to appreciate its several processes, but simply in their results, at which it stops. Besides this knowledge, the merchant must also understand the processes of his art. He must be acquainted with the commodities in which he deals, their qualities and defects, the countries from which they are derived, their markets, the means of their transportation, the values to be given for them in exchange, and the method of keeping accounts. The same remark is applicable to the agriculturist, to the manufacturer, and to the practical man of business; to acquire a thorough knowledge of the causes and consequences of each phenomenon, the study of political economy is essentially necessary to them all; and to become expert in his particular pursuit, each one must add thereto a knowledge of its processes." {{harv|Say|1803|page=XVI}} }} Say's definition has prevailed up to our time, saved by substituting the word "wealth" for "goods and services" meaning that wealth may include non-material objects as well. One hundred and thirty years later, [[Lionel Robbins, Baron Robbins|Lionel Robbins]] noticed that this definition no longer sufficed,{{efn|"And when we submit the definition in question to this test, it is seen to possess deficiencies which, so far from being marginal and subsidiary, amount to nothing less than a complete failure to exhibit either the scope or the significance of the most central generalisations of all."{{harv|Robbins|2007|p=5}} }} because many economists were making theoretical and philosophical inroads in other areas of human activity. In his ''[[An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science|Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science]]'', he proposed a definition of economics as a study of a particular aspect of human behaviour, the one that falls under the influence of scarcity,{{efn|"The conception we have adopted may be described as analytical. It does not attempt to pick out certain kinds of behaviour, but focuses attention on a particular aspect of behaviour, the form imposed by the influence of scarcity. {{harv|Robbins|2007|p=17}} }} which forces people to choose, allocate scarce resources to competing ends, and economize (seeking the greatest welfare while avoiding the wasting of scarce resources). For Robbins, the insufficiency was solved, and his definition allows us to proclaim, with an easy conscience, education economics, safety and security economics, health economics, war economics, and of course, production, distribution and consumption economics as valid subjects of the economic science."

Citing Robbins: "Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses".{{sfnp|Robbins|2007|p=16}} After discussing it for decades, Robbins' definition became widely accepted by mainstream economists, and it has opened way into current textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=Defining Economics: the Long Road to Acceptance of the Robbins Definition |first1=Roger E. |last1=Backhouse |first2=Steven G. |last2=Medema |work=Lionel Robbins's essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science, 75th anniversary conference proceedings |date=10 December 2007 |pp=209–230 |url=http://darp.lse.ac.uk/papersdb/LionelRobbinsConferenceProveedingsVolume.pdf#page=213 |ref=harv}} also published in {{cite journal |title=Defining Economics: The Long Road to Acceptance of the Robbins Definition |journal=Economica |date=October 2009 |volume=76 |issue=Supplement 1 |pages=805–820 |jstor=40268907 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0335.2009.00789.x|last1=Backhouse |first1=Roger E |last2=Medema |first2=Steve G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although far from unanimous, most mainstream economists would accept some version of Robbins' definition, even though many have raised serious objections to the scope and method of economics, emanating from that definition.{{sfnp|Backhouse|Medema|2007|page=223|ps=: "There remained division over whether economics was defined by a method or a subject matter but both sides in that debate could increasingly accept some version of the Robbins definition."}} Due to the lack of strong consensus, and that production, distribution and consumption of goods and services is the prime area of study of economics, the old definition still stands in many quarters.

A body of theory later termed "neoclassical economics" or "[[Marginalist Revolution|marginalism]]" formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term "economics" was popularized by such neoclassical economists as [[Alfred Marshall]] as a concise synonym for "economic science" and a substitute for the earlier "[[political economy]]".&lt;ref name="MarshallMarshall1888"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jevons1879"/&gt; This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the [[natural science]]s.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=Barry |title=Political Economy: A Comparative Approach |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3wpiDzS45PsC&amp;pg=PP1 |edition=second |year=1998 |publisher=Praeger |isbn=978-0-275-95869-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoclassical economics systematized [[supply and demand]] as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income. It dispensed with the [[labour theory of value]] inherited from classical economics in favour of a [[marginal utility]] theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Campos |first=Antonietta |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |volume=III |p=320 |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001393 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3031|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Marginalist economics }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, neoclassical theorists moved away from an earlier notion suggesting that total utility for a society could be measured in favour of [[ordinal utility]], which hypothesizes merely behaviour-based relations across persons.&lt;ref name="Hicks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=R.D. Collison |last=Black |date=2008 |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |edition=second |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_U000047 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.1781|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=577–581 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=Utility }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[microeconomics]], neoclassical economics represents incentives and costs as playing a pervasive role in shaping [[decision making]]. An immediate example of this is the [[consumer theory]] of individual demand, which isolates how prices (as costs) and income affect quantity demanded.&lt;ref name="Hicks"/&gt; In [[macroeconomics]] it is reflected in an early and lasting [[neoclassical synthesis]] with Keynesian macroeconomics.&lt;ref name="Blanchard2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-link=John Hicks |last=Hicks |first=J.R. |date=April 1937 |title=Mr. Keynes and the "Classics": A Suggested Interpretation |journal=Econometrica |volume=5 |issue=2 |jstor=1907242 |pp=147–159 |doi=10.2307/1907242 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoclassical economics is occasionally referred as ''orthodox economics'' whether by its critics or sympathizers. Modern [[mainstream economics]] builds on neoclassical economics but with many refinements that either supplement or generalize earlier analysis, such as [[econometrics]], [[game theory]], analysis of [[market failure]] and [[imperfect competition]], and the [[neoclassical model]] of [[economic growth]] for analysing long-run variables affecting [[national income]].

Neoclassical economics studies the behaviour of [[individual]]s, [[household]]s, and [[organization]]s (called economic actors, players, or agents), when they manage or use [[Scarcity|scarce]] resources, which have alternative uses, to achieve desired ends. Agents are assumed to act rationally, have multiple desirable ends in sight, limited resources to obtain these ends, a set of stable preferences, a definite overall guiding objective, and the capability of making a choice. There exists an economic problem, subject to study by economic science, when a [[Decision theory|decision]] (choice) is made by one or more resource-controlling players to attain the best possible outcome under bounded rational conditions. In other words, resource-controlling agents maximize value subject to the constraints imposed by the information the agents have, their cognitive limitations, and the finite amount of time they have to make and execute a decision. Economic science centres on the activities of the economic agents that comprise society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Leigh |last=Tesfatsion |title=Agent-Based Computational Economics: Growing Economies from the Bottom Up |journal=[[Artificial Life (journal)|Artificial Life]] |date=Winter 2002 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=55–82 |url=http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/acealife.pdf |pmid=12020421 |doi=10.1162/106454602753694765|citeseerx=10.1.1.194.4605 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the focus of economic analysis.{{efn|See [[Agent-based computational economics]]}}

An approach to understanding these processes, through the study of agent behaviour under scarcity, may go as follows:

The continuous interplay (exchange or trade) done by economic actors in all markets sets the prices for all goods and services which, in turn, make the rational managing of scarce resources possible. At the same time, the decisions (choices) made by the same actors, while they are pursuing their own interest, determine the level of output (production), consumption, savings, and investment, in an economy, as well as the remuneration (distribution) paid to the owners of labour (in the form of wages), capital (in the form of profits) and land (in the form of rent).{{efn|Interest payments are considered a form of rent on credit money.}} Each period, as if they were in a giant feedback system, economic players influence the pricing processes and the economy, and are in turn influenced by them until a steady state (equilibrium) of all variables involved is reached or until an external shock throws the system toward a new equilibrium point. Because of the autonomous actions of rational interacting agents, the economy is a complex adaptive system.{{efn|See [[Complex adaptive system]] and [[Dynamic network analysis]]}}

===Keynesian economics===
{{Main|Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesian economics|}}
[[File:WhiteandKeynes.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[John Maynard Keynes]] (right), was a key theorist in economics.]]

Keynesian economics derives from [[John Maynard Keynes]], in particular his book ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'' (1936), which ushered in contemporary [[macroeconomics]] as a distinct field.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite book |last=Keynes |first=John Maynard |title=The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money |publisher= Macmillan|year=1936 |location=London |isbn=978-1-57392-139-8 |title-link=The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money }}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{harvp|Blaug|2017|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book focused on determinants of national income in the short run when prices are relatively inflexible. Keynes attempted to explain in broad theoretical detail why high labour-market unemployment might not be self-correcting due to low "[[effective demand]]" and why even price flexibility and monetary policy might be unavailing. The term "revolutionary" has been applied to the book in its impact on economic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;• {{cite encyclopedia |last=Tarshis |first=L. |author-link=Lorie Tarshis |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |volume=III |pp=47–50 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001226 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.2888|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Keynesian Revolution }}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{harvp|Samuelson|Nordhaus|2004|p=5}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{harvp|Blaug|2017|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keynesian economics has two successors. [[Post-Keynesian economics]] also concentrates on macroeconomic rigidities and adjustment processes. Research on micro foundations for their models is represented as based on real-life practices rather than simple optimizing models. It is generally associated with the [[University of Cambridge]] and the work of [[Joan Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Harcourt |first=G.C. |date=1987 |work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics |edition=first |editor-first1=John |editor-last1=Eatwell |editor-first2=Murray |editor-last2=Milgate |editor-first3=Peter |editor-last3=Newman |volume=III |pp=47–50 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde1987_X001728 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.3307|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |isbn=9780333786765 |chapter=Post-Keynesian economics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New-Keynesian economics]] is also associated with developments in the Keynesian fashion. Within this group researchers tend to share with other economists the emphasis on models employing micro foundations and optimizing behaviour but with a narrower focus on standard Keynesian themes such as price and wage rigidity. These are usually made to be endogenous features of the models, rather than simply assumed as in older Keynesian-style ones.

===Chicago school of economics===
{{Main|Chicago school of economics}}
The Chicago School of economics is best known for its free market advocacy and [[monetarist]] ideas. According to [[Milton Friedman]] and monetarists, market economies are inherently stable if the money supply does not greatly expand or contract. [[Ben Bernanke]], former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, is among the economists today generally accepting Friedman's analysis of the causes of the Great Depression.&lt;ref name="fed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/SPEECHES/2002/20021108/default.htm|title=Remarks by Governor Ben S. Bernanke |publisher=The Federal Reserve Board|date=8 November 2002|first=Ben |last=Bernanke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milton Friedman effectively took many of the basic principles set forth by Adam Smith and the classical economists and modernized them. One example of this is his article in the 13 September 1970 issue of ''The New York Times Magazine'', in which he claims that the social responsibility of business should be "to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits&amp;nbsp;... (through) open and free competition without deception or fraud."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Friedman |first=Milton |title=The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits |work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=13 September 1970 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other schools and approaches===
{{Main|Schools of economics}}
Other well-known schools or trends of thought referring to a particular style of economics practised at and disseminated from well-defined groups of academicians that have become known worldwide, include the [[Austrian School]], the [[Freiburg School]], the [[School of Lausanne]], [[post-Keynesian economics]] and the [[Stockholm school (economics)|Stockholm school]]. Contemporary [[mainstream economics]] is sometimes separated into the Saltwater approach of those universities along the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern]] and [[West coast of the United States|Western]] coasts of the US, and the Freshwater, or Chicago-school approach.

Within macroeconomics there is, in general order of their appearance in the literature; [[classical economics]], [[Keynesian economics]], the neoclassical synthesis, [[post-Keynesian economics]], [[monetarism]], [[new classical economics]], and [[supply-side economics]]. Alternative developments include [[ecological economics]], [[constitutional economics]], [[institutional economics]], [[evolutionary economics]], [[dependency theory]], [[structuralist economics]], [[world systems theory]], [[econophysics]], [[feminist economics]] and [[biophysical economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new |first=Nathanial |last=Greenwolde |date=23 October 2009 |title=New School of Thought Brings Energy to 'the Dismal Science' |work=[[The New York Times]]  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/10/23/23greenwire-new-school-of-thought-brings-energy-to-the-dis-63367.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

===General criticisms===
"[[The dismal science]]" is a derogatory alternative name for economics devised by the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] historian Thomas Carlyle in the 19th century. It is often stated that Carlyle gave economics the nickname "the dismal science" as a response to the late 18th century writings of The Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus, who grimly predicted that starvation would result, as projected population growth exceeded the rate of increase in the food supply. However, the actual phrase was coined by Carlyle in the context of a debate with John Stuart Mill on [[slavery]], in which Carlyle argued for slavery, while Mill opposed it.&lt;ref name="Dismal"/&gt;

Some economists, like John Stuart Mill or [[Léon Walras]], have maintained that the production of wealth should not be tied to its distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Routh |first=Guy |authorlink=Guy Routh |title=The Origin of Economic Ideas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d2KwCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1 |edition=second |year=1989 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK |isbn=978-1-349-20169-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Wealth of Nations'', Adam Smith addressed many issues that are currently also the subject of debate and dispute. Smith repeatedly attacks groups of politically aligned individuals who attempt to use their collective influence to manipulate a government into doing their bidding. In Smith's day, these were referred to as [[Political faction|factions]], but are now more commonly called [[special interests]], a term which can comprise international bankers, corporate conglomerations, outright oligopolies, monopolies, [[trade union]]s and other groups.{{efn|See {{cite web |first=Noam |last=Chomsky |author-link=Noam Chomsky |website=Understanding Power |title=Ruling the World |url=http://www.understandingpower.com/Chapter5.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014032025/http://www.understandingpower.com/Chapter5.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 October 2008 |date=14 October 2008}} on Smith's emphasis on class conflict in the Wealth of Nations.}}

Economics ''per se'', as a social science, is independent of the political acts of any government or other decision-making organization; however, many [[policymaker]]s or individuals holding highly ranked positions that can influence other people's lives are known for arbitrarily using a plethora of economic concepts and [[rhetoric]] as vehicles to legitimize [[Political agenda|agendas]] and [[value systems]], and do not limit their remarks to matters relevant to their responsibilities.&lt;ref name="dismal science to get real"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Sara |last1=Ledwith |first2=Antonella |last2=Ciancio |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/03/us-europe-economics-teaching-idUSBRE86207O20120703 |title=Special Report: Crisis Forces "Dismal Science" to get Real |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The close relation of economic theory and practice with [[politics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sirkku K. |last=Hellsten |chapter=Ethics, Rhetoric and Politics of Post-conflict Reconstruction How Can the Concept of Social Contract Help Us in Understanding How to Make Peace Work? |chapter-url=https://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/rp2006-148.pdf |title=Making Peace Work |editor-first1=Tony |editor-last1=Addison |editor-first2=Tilman |editor-last2=Brück |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |pp=75–100 |isbn=978-0-230-59519-4 |doi=10.1057/9780230595194|year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a focus of contention that may shade or distort the most unpretentious original tenets of economics, and is often confused with specific social agendas and value systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hahn |first=Dan F. |title=Political Communication: Rhetoric, Government, and Citizens |url=http://www.stratapub.com/Hahn/preface.htm |edition=second |year=2003 |publisher=Strata |isbn=978-1-891136-08-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding, economics legitimately has a role in informing government policy. It is, indeed, in some ways an outgrowth of the older field of political economy. Some academic economic journals have increased their efforts to gauge the consensus of economists regarding certain policy issues in hopes of effecting a more informed political environment. Often there exists a low approval rate from professional economists regarding many public policies. Policy issues featured in one survey of [[American Economic Association]] economists include trade restrictions, social insurance for those put out of work by international competition, genetically modified foods, curbside recycling, health insurance (several questions), medical malpractice, barriers to entering the medical profession, organ donations, unhealthy foods, mortgage deductions, taxing internet sales, Wal-Mart, casinos, ethanol subsidies, and inflation targeting.{{sfnp|Whaples|2009}}

In ''Steady State Economics'' 1977, leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]] argues that there exist logical inconsistencies between the emphasis placed on economic growth and the limited availability of natural resources.&lt;ref name="Daly1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Daly|first=Herman E.|authorlink=Herman Daly|title=Steady-State Economics |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qmp5mPdJ474C&amp;pg=PA98|edition=second|year=1991|publisher=Island Press|isbn=978-1-59726-872-1|pages=98–128|chapter=The Catechism of Growth Fallacies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deirdre McCloskey]] has argued that many empirical economic studies are poorly reported, and she and Stephen Ziliak argue that although [[McCloskey critique|her critique]] has been well-received, practice has not improved.&lt;ref name=Ziliak2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ziliak |first1=Stephen T. |last2=McCloskey |first2=Deirdre N. |date=April 2004 |title=Size Matters: The Standard Error of Regressions in the ''American Economic Review'' |journal=Econ Journal Watch |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=331–358 |url=http://www.econjournalwatch.org/pdf/ZiliakMcCloskeyAugust2004.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This latter contention is controversial.{{sfnp|Hoover|Siegler|2008}}

A 2002 [[International Monetary Fund]] study assessed the national economic growth predictions from ''[[Consensus Economics|Consensus Forecasts]]'' in the 1990s. Of the 60 different national recessions that occurred, only 2 (3%) were predicted a year in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=How Accurate Are Private Sector Forecasts?

===Criticisms of assumptions===
Economics has been subject to criticism that it relies on unrealistic, unverifiable, or highly simplified assumptions, in some cases because these assumptions simplify the proofs of desired conclusions. Examples of such assumptions include [[perfect information]], [[profit maximization]] and [[rational choice theory|rational choices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rappaport |first=Steven |date=28 July 1996 |title=Abstraction and Unrealistic Assumptions in Economics |journal=Journal of Economic Methodology |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=215–236 |doi=10.1080/13501789600000016}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite book |last=Rappaport |first=Steven |title=Models and Reality in Economics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lmCa_pgyhUC&amp;pg=PP1 |year=1998 |publisher=Edward Elgar |isbn=978-1-85898-575-6 |chapter=Chapter 6: Economic Models}}&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{harvp|Friedman|1953|pages=14–15, 22, 31}}&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • {{cite encyclopedia |last=Boland |first=Lawrence A. |date=2008 |edition=second |editor-first1=Steven N. |editor-last1=Durlauf |editor-first2=Lawrence E. |editor-last2=Blume |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_A000231 |doi=10.1057/9780230226203.0067|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics |pages=267–270 |isbn=978-0-333-78676-5 |chapter=Assumptions controversy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The field of [[information economics]] includes both mathematical-economical research and also [[behavioural economics]], akin to studies in [[behavioural psychology]].&lt;ref name=Hodgson2007&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hodgson |first=Geoffrey M. |date=December 2007 |title=Evolutionary and Institutional Economics as the New Mainstream |journal=Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=7–25 |doi=10.14441/eier.4.7|citeseerx=10.1.1.454.8088 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, prominent mainstream economists such as Keynes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Keynes |first=J. M. |title=Alfred Marshall 1842–1924 |journal=The Economic Journal |volume=34 |issue=135 |pages=311–72 |date=September 1924 |jstor=2222645 |doi=10.2307/2222645}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Joskow have observed that much of economics is conceptual rather than quantitative, and difficult to model and formalize quantitatively. In a discussion on oligopoly research, [[Paul Joskow]] pointed out in 1975 that in practice, serious students of actual economies tended to use "informal models" based upon qualitative factors specific to particular industries. Joskow had a strong feeling that the important work in oligopoly was done through informal observations while formal models were "trotted out ''[[ex post]]''". He argued that formal models were largely not important in the empirical work, either, and that the fundamental factor behind the theory of the firm, behaviour, was neglected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Joskow |first=Paul |title=Firm Decision-making Policy and Oligopoly Theory |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=65 |issue=2, Papers and Proceedings of the Eighty–seventh Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association |pages=270–279, esp. 271 |date=May 1975 |jstor=1818864 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, feminist critiques of neoclassical economic models gained prominence, leading to the formation of [[feminist economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=England |first=Paula |date=1993 |chapter=The Separative Self: Androcentric Bias in Neoclassical Assumptions |editor-last1=Ferber|editor-first1=Marianne A.|editor-last2=Nelson|editor-first2=Julie A. |title=Beyond Economic Man: Feminist Theory and Economics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ba9PmAEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA37 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-24201-9 |pages=37–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to common conceptions of economics as a [[positive economics|positive]] and [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] science, feminist economists call attention to the social construction of economics&lt;ref name="beyond"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ferber |first1=Marianne A. |last2=Nelson |first2=Julie A. |chapter=Introduction: ''Beyond Economic Man'': Ten Years Later |title=Feminist Economics Today: Beyond Economic Man |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DeWgyqLvmfsC&amp;pg=PP1 |year=2003 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-24207-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and highlight the ways in which its models and methods reflect masculine preferences. Primary criticisms focus on failures to account for: the selfish nature of actors ([[homo economicus]]); exogenous tastes; the impossibility of utility comparisons; the exclusion of [[unpaid work]]; and the exclusion of class and gender considerations. [[Feminist economics]] developed to address these concerns, and the field now includes critical examinations of many areas of economics including paid and unpaid work, economic epistemology and history, globalization, household economics and the care economy. In 1988, [[Marilyn Waring]] published the book ''[[If Women Counted]]'', in which she argues that the discipline of economics ignores [[women's work|women's unpaid work]] and the value of [[nature]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Marilyn |last=Waring |date=1988 |title=If Women Counted |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=978-0-06-250933-8|title-link=If Women Counted }}&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[Julie A. Nelson]], ''If Women Counted'' "showed exactly how the unpaid work traditionally done by women has been made invisible within [[national accounts|national accounting systems]]" and "issued a wake-up call to issues of ecological [[sustainability]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nelson |first=Julie A. |chapter=Foreword |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sbh8AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR9 |editor1-last=Bjørnholt|editor1-first =Margunn |editor1-link=Margunn Bjørnholt|editor2-last=McKay|editor2-first =Ailsa|editor2-link=Ailsa McKay |title=Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics |year=2014 |publisher=Demeter Press |isbn=978-1-9273-3527-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bjørnholt and McKay argue that the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]] and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession, and call for a reshaping of both the economy, economic theory and the economics profession. They argue that such a reshaping should include new advances within feminist economics that take as their starting point the socially responsible, sensible and accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories that fully acknowledge care for each other as well as the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bjørnholt |first1=Margunn  |last2=McKay |first2=Ailsa |author2-link=Ailsa McKay |editor1-last=Bjørnholt |editor1-first =Margunn |editor1-link=Margunn Bjørnholt |editor2-last=McKay |editor2-first=Ailsa |editor2-link=Ailsa McKay |title=Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics |chapter-url=http://www.margunnbjornholt.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Advances-in-Feminist-Economics-in-Times-of-Economic-Crisis.pdf |year=2014 |publisher=Demeter Press |pages=7–20 |chapter=Advances in Feminist Economics in Times of Economic Crisis |isbn=978-1-9273-3527-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Mirowski]] observes that:

{{quote|The imperatives of the orthodox research programme [of economic science] leave little room for maneuver and less room for originality.&amp;nbsp;... These mandates&amp;nbsp;... Appropriate as many mathematical techniques and metaphorical expressions from contemporary respectable science, primarily physics as possible.&amp;nbsp;...

Above all, prevent all rival research programmes from encroaching&amp;nbsp;... by ridiculing all external attempts to appropriate twentieth century physics models.&amp;nbsp;...

In a series of peer-reviewed journal and conference papers and books published over a period of several decades, [[John McMurtry]] has provided extensive criticism of what he terms the "unexamined assumptions and implications [of economics], and their consequent cost to people's lives."&lt;ref name="McMurtryCancerStage"&gt;{{cite book|last=McMurtry|first=John|title=The Cancer Stage of Capitalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=79G3Jsb2KYwC&amp;pg=PP1|year=1999|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=978-0-7453-1347-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Please see partial list of publications, including peer-reviewed papers and books, on [[John McMurtry]]'s wikipedia page, as well as links to the text of several of his peer-reviewed papers and peer-reviewed secondary references analyzing and discussing his work.}}

[[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] and [[Michael Perelman]] are two additional scholars who criticized conventional or mainstream economics. Taleb opposes most economic theorizing, which in his view suffers acutely from the problem of overuse of Plato's [[Theory of Forms]], and calls for cancellation of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]], saying that the damage from economic theories can be devastating.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Faye Duchin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dj|uː|tʃ|ᵻ|n}}; born 1944) is an American [[Computer Scientist]] and Professor of [[Economics]] at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] ("RPI"), where she was the Dean of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences from 1996 to 2002.&lt;ref name="Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economics.rpi.edu/pl/people/faye-duchin|title=Faye Duchin, Professor of Economics|publisher=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is active in the fields of [[ecological economics]] and [[industrial ecology]] and employs [[Input-output model|Input-Output Analysis]] in her work. Her faculty page at RPI states that she is "concerned with ways of achieving economic development while avoiding environmental disasters."

==Biography==
Faye Duchin was raised in a "very conventional setting" in [[Bayonne, New Jersey|Bayonne]], [[New Jersey]]. She attended [[Cornell University]], earning a BA in Experimental Psychology in 1965 &lt;ref name="Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="people"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economics.rpi.edu/index.php?siteid=18&amp;pageid=199&amp;personID=91|title=People – Department of Economics|publisher=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1973 completed her Ph.D. in Computer Science at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] with a dissertation on the newly passed [[Rent Control]] law in Berkeley.&lt;ref name="poly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poly.rpi.edu/article_view.php3?view=1041&amp;part=1|title=Dean Duchin has varied background|last=Lutzky|first=Raymond|date=2001-11-14|publisher=The Polytechnic|accessdate=2009-01-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911223642/http://www.poly.rpi.edu/article_view.php3?view=1041&amp;part=1|archivedate=2006-09-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="people"/&gt;

From 1977–1996, Duchin was on the faculty at [[New York University]], where she worked for Nobel Laureate [[Wassily Leontief]] on [[input-output economics]].&lt;ref name="poly"/&gt; In 1985, she became Director of the NYU Institute for Economic Analysis, a position she held until 1996&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpi.edu/~duchin/cv.html|title=CV|publisher=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; when she left to become Dean of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. In 2002, Duchin resigned as Dean.

==Professional affiliations==
Duchin served as president of the [[International Input-Output Association]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iioa.org/Who%20we%20are-offices.htm|title=Who we are|publisher=International Input-Output Association|accessdate=2008-11-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120904045151/http://www.iioa.org/Who%20we%20are-offices.htm|archivedate=2012-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2004 to 2006,&lt;ref name="activities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpi.edu/~duchin/activities.html|title=Activities|last=Duchin|first=Faye|publisher=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a former Vice President of the [[International Society for Ecological Economics]] (ISEE). She is a member of the editorial boards of various journals, including the journal of [[Industrial Ecology]], having held this position since the journal's founding in 1997.&lt;ref name="activities"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1530-9290/homepage/EditorialBoard.html&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the founders and a managing editor of the journal Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, She is author or co-author of thirty-three works published between 1973 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.scientificcommons.org/faye_duchin|title=Scientific Commons: Faye Duchin|publisher=ScientificCommons.org|accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly contributions==
Duchin has stated that she examines factors that could "make a difference in satisfying major global imperatives."&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; She has examined [[technological change]], [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle change]], [[quality of life]], [[income distribution]], [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]], [[international trade]], [[natural resource]] use and [[environmental degradation]] using [[input-output model]]s. She calls her work "problem-oriented rather than discipline- or technique-oriented" and has used an interdisciplinary approach to study [[sustainability]]. She claims to study physical realities and constraints, not just monetary values, by using process and engineering data to model technology and resource use.

Duchin's RPI web page describes her research agenda:
:"Based on the results of my empirical studies, I became convinced of the need for changes not only in technologies but also in household lifestyles, in particular household decisions regarding diet, housing and transportation. The plausibility and implications of such scenarios need to be explored in a global framework, and I have developed a new model of the world economy for this purpose."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economics.rpi.edu/pl/people/faye-duchin Duchin faculty web page at RPI]&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchin's recent work focuses on [[industrial ecology]], continuing work she began in the early 1990s. Her 1994 book begins with the question, "Can technology ensure environmentally sound [[economic development]]?"&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0195085744/|title=Amazon.com: The Future of the Environment: Ecological Economics and Technological Change: Faye Duchin, Glenn-Marie Lange: Books|publisher=Amazon.com, Inc|accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book uses quantitative analysis of empirical data and discusses alternative scenarios for the future.

Floating-point error arises because real numbers cannot, in general, be accurately represented in a fixed space.  By definition, [[floating-point]] error cannot be eliminated, and, at best, can only be managed.

H. M. Sierra noted in his 1956 patent "Floating Decimal Point Arithmetic Control Means for Calculator":
&lt;blockquote&gt;"''Thus under some conditions, the major portion of the significant data digits may lie beyond the capacity of the registers. Therefore, the result obtained may have little meaning if not totally erroneous.''"&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[Z1 (computer)|first computer]] (relays) developed by [[Konrad Zuse|Zuse]] in 1936 with floating point arithmetic and was thus susceptible to floating point error. Early computers, however, with operation times measured in milliseconds, were incapable of solving large, complex problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wikieducator.org/History_of_Computer_Development_%26_Generation_of_Computer|title= History of Computer Development &amp; Generation of Computer|date= September 2014|website= WikiEducator|accessdate= 2018-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus were seldom plagued with floating point error. Today, however, with super computer system performance measured in petaflops, (10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;) floating-point operations per second, floating point error is a major concern for computational problem solvers. Further, there are two types of floating point error, cancellation and rounding. Cancellation occurs when subtracting two similar numbers and rounding occurs with significant bits cannot be saved and are rounded or truncated. Cancellation error is exponential relative to rounding error.

The following sections describe the strengths and weaknesses of various means of mitigating floating point error.

== Numerical error analysis ==
Though not the primary focus of [[numerical analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://webs.um.es/eliseo/um/uploads/Main/TrefethendefNA.pdf|title= The Definition of Numerical Analysis|last1= Trefethen|first1= Lloyd N. |date= 1992|publisher= SIAM|accessdate= 2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Higham1&gt;{{cite book|title=Accuracy and Stability of Numerical Algorithms |edition=2 |first=Nicholas John |author-link=Nicholas John Higham |last=Higham |publisher=[[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] (SIAM) |year=2002 |isbn=0-89871-521-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=epilvM5MMxwC&amp;dq=accuracy+and+stability+of+numerical+algorithms+higham&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjiktX7vqrZAhXkh1QKHYvhCncQ6AEIMzAC }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} [[Error analysis (mathematics)|numerical error analysis]] for the analysis and minimization of floating point rounding error. Numerical error analysis generally does not account for cancellation error.&lt;ref name=Higham1/&gt;{{rp|5}}

== Monte Carlo arithmetic ==
Error analysis by Monte Carlo arithmetic is accomplished by repeatedly injecting small errors into an algorithms data values and determining the relative effect on the results.

== Extension of precision == 
Extension of precision is the use of larger representations of real values. The ISO standard define precision as the number of digits available to represent real numbers, and typically including single precision (32-bits), double precision (64-bits), and quad precision (128-bits). While extension of precision makes the effects of error less likely or less important, the true accuracy of the results are still unknown.

== Variable length arithmetic ==
[[Arbitrary-precision arithmetic|Variable length arithmetic]] represents numbers as a string of digits of variable length limited only by the memory available. Variable length arithmetic operations are considerably slower than fixed length format floating point instructions. When high performance is not a requirement, but high precision is, variable length arithmetic can prove useful, thought the actual accuracy of the result may not be known.

== Interval arithmetic ==
[[Interval arithmetic]] is an algorithm for bounding rounding and measurement errors. The algorithm results in two floating point numbers representing the minimum and maximum limits for the real value represented. &lt;blockquote&gt;"Instead of using a single floating-point number as approximation for the value of a real variable in the mathematical model under investigation, interval arithmetic acknowledges limited precision by associating with the variable
a set of reals as possible values. For ease of storage and computation, these sets are restricted to intervals."&lt;ref name=Hickey&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Hickey |first1= T. |last2= Ju|first2= Q. |last3= van Emden|first3= M.H. |date= September 2001 |title= Interval Arithmetic: from Principles to Implementation|url= http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/S62.12/docs/Hickey_interval.pdf|journal= Journal of the ACM|volume= 48|issue= 5|pages= 1038–1068 |doi= 10.1145/502102.502106|access-date= 2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The evaluation of interval arithmetic expression may provide a large range of values,&lt;ref name=Hickey/&gt; and may seriously overestimate the true error boundaries.&lt;ref name=Kahan1&gt;{{cite web|url= https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/UnumSORN.pdf|title= A Critique of  John L. Gustafson’s THE END of ERROR — Unum Computation and his A Radical Approach to Computation with Real Numbers|last1= Kahan|first1= William|authorlink= William Kahan|date= July 2016|accessdate= 2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}}

== Gustafson's unums ==
[[Unums]] ("Universal Numbers") are an extension of variable length arithmetic proposed by [[John L. Gustafson|John Gustafson]].&lt;ref name="Gustafson"&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Gustafson |author-first=John Leroy |author-link=John Leroy Gustafson |title=The End of Error: Unum Computing |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |edition=2nd corrected printing, 1st |date=2016-02-04 |orig-year=2015-02-05 |isbn=978-1-4822-3986-7 |series=[[Chapman &amp; Hall]] / [[CRC Computational Science]] |volume=24 |url=https://www.crcpress.com/The-End-of-Error-Unum-Computing/Gustafson/p/book/9781482239867 |access-date=2016-05-30}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=fZsXBgAAQBAJ] [http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781482239867]&lt;/ref&gt; Unums have variable length fields for the exponent and significand lengths and error information is carried in a single bit, the ubit, representing possible error in the least significant bit of the significand ([[Unit in the last place|ULP]]).&lt;ref name="Gustafson"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

The efficacy of unums is questioned by [[William Kahan]].&lt;ref name="Kahan1"/&gt;

The '''Gibbs Society of Biological Thermodynamics''' is composed of scientists involved in the field of [[Biophysics]], with the group meeting annually in the Fall. Recent meetings have been held at the Touch of Nature Conference Center in [[Carbondale, Illinois]].
Current incarnations have begun with a meet and greet on Saturday night, followed by two and a half days of lectures and two nights of poster sessions. Poster sessions often end with several attendees creating a bonfire at a nearby beach. The last night of the meeting is known for its food, a selection of beef cooked over an open flame, with attendees affectionately calling it the "Buffalo Tro".

The 24th annual meeting of the Gibbs Society of Biological Thermodynamics will be held from September 25-28, 2010. The Keynote speaker is C. Nick Pace, [[Texas A&amp;M University]].

In 2009, the Gary K. Ackers Lecture in Biothermodynamics was instituted, with Michael Brenowitz giving the inaugural lecture.  [[Tim Lohman]], [[Washington University in St. Louis]], will be giving the Ackers lecture at the 2010 meeting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42867">The '''glass–liquid transition''', or '''glass transition''', is the gradual and reversible transition in [[amorphous solid|amorphous]] materials (or in amorphous regions within [[Crystallinity|semicrystalline]] materials), from a hard and relatively brittle "glassy" state into a  viscous or rubbery state as the temperature is increased.&lt;ref name=iso11357-2&gt;
[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 11357-2: Plastics – Differential scanning calorimetry 
 – Part 2: Determination of glass transition temperature (1999).
&lt;/ref&gt; An amorphous solid that exhibits a glass transition is called a [[glass]]. The reverse transition, achieved by [[supercooling]] a [[viscous liquid]] into the glass state, is called [[vitrification]].

The '''glass-transition temperature''' ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; of a material characterizes the range of temperatures over which this glass transition occurs. It is always lower than the [[melting point|melting temperature]], ''T''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, of the crystalline state of the material, if one exists.

Hard plastics like [[polystyrene]] and [[poly(methyl methacrylate)]] are used well below their glass transition temperatures, i.e., when they are in their glassy state. Their ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; values are well above room temperature, both at around {{Convert|100|C}}. Rubber [[elastomer]]s like [[Synthetic rubber|polyisoprene]] and [[Butyl rubber|polyisobutylene]] are used above their ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, that is, in the rubbery state, where they are soft and flexible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pslc.ws/macrog/tg.htm|title=The Glass Transition|publisher=Polymer Science Learning Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the change in the physical properties of a material through its glass transition, the transition is not considered a [[phase transition]]; rather it is a phenomenon extending over a range of temperature and defined by one of several conventions.&lt;ref name="Debenedetti"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/35065704|last=Debenedetti|first=P.

Note 1: Phenomena occurring at the glass transition of polymers are still subject to ongoing scientific investigation and debate. The glass transition presents features of a second-order
transition since thermal studies often indicate that the molar Gibbs energies, molar
enthalpies, and the molar volumes of the two phases, i.e., the melt and the glass, are
equal, while the heat capacity and the expansivity are discontinuous. However, the glass
transition is generally not regarded as a thermodynamic transition in view of the inherent difficulty in reaching equilibrium in a polymer glass or in a polymer melt at temperatures close to the glass-transition temperature.

Note 2: In the case of polymers, conformational changes of segments, typically consisting of
10–20 main-chain atoms, become infinitely slow below the glass transition temperature.

Note 3: In a partially crystalline polymer the glass transition occurs only in the amorphous parts
of the material.

==Introduction==

The glass transition of a liquid to a solid-like state may occur with either cooling or compression.&lt;ref name="Hansen&amp;McDonald"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hansen|first=J.-P.|title=Theory of Simple Liquids| isbn=978-0123705358|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uhm87WZBnxEC&amp;printsec=frontcover|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|pages=250–254|author2=McDonald, I. R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transition comprises a smooth increase in the viscosity of a material by as much as 17 [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] within a temperature range of 500 K without any pronounced change in material structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Adam, J-L |author2=Zhang, X. |title=Chalcogenide Glasses: Preparation, Properties and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IuNRAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94|date=14 February 2014|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0-85709-356-1|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequence of this dramatic increase is a [[glass]] exhibiting solid-like mechanical properties on the timescale of practical observation. This transition is in contrast to the [[freezing]] or [[crystallization]] transition, which is a first-order [[phase transition]] in the [[Phase transition#Ehrenfest classification|Ehrenfest classification]] and involves discontinuities in thermodynamic and dynamic properties such as volume, energy, and viscosity. In many materials that normally undergo a freezing transition, rapid cooling will avoid this phase transition and instead result in a glass transition at some lower temperature. Other materials, such as many [[polymers]], lack a well defined crystalline state and easily form glasses, even upon very slow cooling or compression. The tendency for a material to form a glass while quenched is called glass forming ability. This ability depends on the composition of the material and can be predicted by the [[Rigidity theory (physics)|rigidity theory]].&lt;ref name=phillips1979&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phillips|first=J.C.|title=Topology of covalent non-crystalline solids I: Short-range order in chalcogenide alloys|journal=Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids|year=1979|volume=34|issue=2|page=153|doi=10.1016/0022-3093(79)90033-4|bibcode = 1979JNCS...34..153P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below the transition temperature range, the glassy structure does not relax in accordance with the cooling rate used. The expansion coefficient for the glassy state is roughly equivalent to that of the crystalline solid. If slower cooling rates are used, the increased time for structural [[Relaxation (physics)|relaxation]] (or intermolecular rearrangement) to occur may result in a higher density glass product. Similarly, by [[annealing (glass)|annealing]] (and thus allowing for slow structural relaxation) the glass structure in time approaches an equilibrium density corresponding to the supercooled liquid at this same temperature. T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; is located at the intersection between the cooling curve (volume versus temperature) for the glassy state and the supercooled liquid.&lt;ref name="CM"&gt;

The configuration of the glass in this temperature range changes slowly with time towards the equilibrium structure. The principle of the minimization of the Gibbs free energy provides the thermodynamic driving force necessary for the eventual change. It should be noted here that at somewhat higher temperatures than T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, the structure corresponding to equilibrium at any temperature is achieved quite rapidly. In contrast, at considerably lower temperatures, the configuration of the glass remains sensibly stable over increasingly extended periods of time.

Thus, the liquid-glass transition is not a transition between states of [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. It is widely believed that the true equilibrium state is always crystalline. Glass is believed to exist in a kinetically locked state, and its entropy, density, and so on, depend on the thermal history. Therefore, the glass transition is primarily a dynamic phenomenon. Time and temperature are interchangeable quantities (to some extent) when dealing with glasses, a fact often expressed in the [[time–temperature superposition]] principle. On cooling a liquid, ''internal degrees of freedom successively fall out of equilibrium''. However, there is a longstanding debate whether there is an underlying second-order phase transition in the hypothetical limit of infinitely long relaxation times.{{clarify|date=June 2016}}&lt;ref name=z1&gt;

==Transition temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;==

[[File:Tgdscenglish.svg|thumb|Measurement of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; (the temperature at the point A) by differential scanning calorimetry]]

[[File:Tgdilatometric.gif|thumb|Determination of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; by [[Dilatometer|dilatometry]].]]

Refer to the figure on the right plotting the heat capacity as a function of temperature. In this context, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; is the temperature corresponding to point A on the curve. The linear sections below and above ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; are colored green. ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; is the temperature at the intersection of the red regression lines.&lt;ref name=tgmeasurement&gt;[http://www.glassproperties.com/tg/ Tg measurement of glasses]. Glassproperties.com. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different operational definitions of the glass transition temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; are in use, and several of them are endorsed as accepted scientific standards. Nevertheless, all definitions are arbitrary, and all yield different numeric results: at best, values of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; for a given substance agree within a few kelvins. One definition refers to the [[viscosity]], fixing ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; at a value of 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; poise (or 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; Pa·s). As evidenced experimentally, this value is close to the [[Annealing (glass)|annealing point]] of many glasses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.iupac.org/goldbook/G02641.pdf glass-transition temperature], IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 66, 583 (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to viscosity, the [[thermal expansion]], [[heat capacity]], shear modulus, and many other properties of inorganic [[glass]]es show a relatively sudden change at the glass transition temperature. Any such step or kink can be used to define ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;. To make this definition reproducible, the cooling or heating rate must be specified.

The most frequently used definition of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; uses the energy release on heating in [[differential scanning calorimetry]] (DSC, see figure). Typically, the sample is first cooled with 10 K/min and then heated with that same speed.

Yet another definition of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; uses the kink in [[Dilatometer|dilatometry]] (a.k.a. thermal expansion). Here, heating rates of {{Convert|3|-|5|K/min|abbr=on|F/min}} are common. Summarized below are ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; values characteristic of certain classes of materials.

==Kauzmann's paradox==
[[File:KauzmannParadox.png|thumb|right|Entropy difference between crystal and undercooled melt]]

As a liquid is supercooled, the difference in entropy between the liquid and solid phase decreases. By extrapolating the [[heat capacity]] of the supercooled liquid below its [[glass transition temperature]], it is possible to calculate the temperature at which the difference in entropies becomes zero. This temperature has been named the '''Kauzmann temperature'''.

If a liquid could be supercooled below its Kauzmann temperature, and it did indeed display a lower entropy than the crystal phase, the consequences would be paradoxical. This '''Kauzmann paradox''' has been the subject of much debate and many publications since it was first put forward by [[Walter Kauzmann]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/cr60135a002|title=The Nature of the Glassy State and the Behavior of Liquids at Low Temperatures|year=1948|last1=Kauzmann|first1=Walter|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=43|issue=2|pages=219–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One resolution of the Kauzmann paradox is to say that there must be a [[phase transition]] before the entropy of the liquid decreases. In this scenario, the transition temperature is known as the ''calorimetric ideal glass transition temperature'' ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0c&lt;/sub&gt;. In this view, the glass transition is not merely a [[Chemical kinetics|kinetic]] effect, i.e. merely the result of fast cooling of a melt, but there is an underlying [[thermodynamic]] basis for glass formation. The glass transition temperature:

: &lt;math&gt; T_g \to T_{0c} \text{ as } \frac{dT}{dt} \to 0. &lt;/math&gt;

The Gibbs-DiMarzio model specifically predicts that a supercooled liquid's configurational entropy disappears in the limit &lt;math&gt; T \to T_{K}^+&lt;/math&gt;, where the liquid's existence regime ends, its microstructure becomes identical to the crystal's, and their property curves intersect in a true second-order phase transition.  This has never been experimentally verified due to the difficulty of realizing a slow enough cooling rate while avoiding accidental crystallization.

===Alternative resolutions===

There are at least three other possible resolutions to the Kauzmann paradox. It could be that the heat capacity of the supercooled liquid near the Kauzmann temperature smoothly decreases to a smaller value. It could also be that a first order phase transition to another liquid state occurs before the Kauzmann temperature with the heat capacity of this new state being less than that obtained by extrapolation from higher temperature. Finally, Kauzmann himself resolved the entropy paradox by postulating that all supercooled liquids must crystallize before the Kauzmann temperature is reached.

==In specific materials==

===Silica, SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===
[[Silica]] (the chemical compound SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) has a number of distinct [[crystal]]line forms in addition to the quartz structure. Nearly all of the crystalline forms involve [[tetrahedral]] SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; units linked together by ''shared vertices'' in different arrangements. Si-O bond lengths vary between the different crystal forms. For example, in α-quartz the bond length is {{convert|161|pm}}, whereas in α-tridymite it ranges from {{convert|154|–|171|pm|abbr=on}}. The Si-O-Si bond angle also varies from 140° in α-tridymite to 144° in α-quartz to 180° in β-tridymite. Any deviations from these standard parameters constitute microstructural differences or variations that represent an approach to an [[amorphous solid|amorphous]], vitreous or [[amorphous solid|glassy solid]].
The transition temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; in silicates is related to the energy required to break and re-form covalent bonds in an amorphous (or random network) lattice of [[covalent bond]]s. The ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; is clearly influenced by the chemistry of the glass. For example, addition of elements such as [[Boron|B]], [[Sodium|Na]], [[Potassium|K]] or [[Calcium|Ca]] to a [[silica glass]], which have a [[valency (chemistry)|valency]] less than 4, helps in breaking up the network structure, thus reducing the ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;. Alternatively, [[Phosphorus|P]], which has a valency of 5, helps to reinforce an ordered lattice, and thus increases the ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ojovan M.I.|title= Configurons: thermodynamic parameters and symmetry changes at glass transition|journal=Entropy|volume=10|issue=3|pages=334–364|year=2008|url=http://www.mdpi.org/entropy/papers/e10030334.pdf|doi=10.3390/e10030334|bibcode = 2008Entrp..10..334O }}&lt;/ref&gt;
''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; is directly proportional to bond strength, e.g. it depends on quasi-equilibrium thermodynamic parameters of the bonds e.g. on the enthalpy ''H''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; and entropy ''S''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; of configurons – broken bonds: ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = ''H''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; / [''S''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; + Rln[(1-''f''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;)/ ''f''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;] where R is the gas constant and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the percolation threshold. For strong melts such as Si''O''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the percolation threshold in the above equation is the universal Scher-Zallen critical density in the 3-D space e.g. ''f''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.15, however for fragile materials the percolation thresholds are material-dependent and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;&lt; 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ojovan, M.I. |title= Configurons: thermodynamic parameters and symmetry changes at glass transition |journal= Entropy|volume=10|pages= 334–364 |year=2008|url= http://www.mdpi.org/entropy/papers/e10030334.pdf|doi=10.3390/e10030334|issue=3 |bibcode=2008Entrp..10..334O}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enthalpy ''H''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; and the entropy ''S''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; of configurons – broken bonds can be found from available experimental data on viscosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0953-8984/19/41/415107|pmid=28192319|title=Thermodynamic parameters of bonds in glassy materials from viscosity–temperature relationships|year=2007|last1=Ojovan|first1=Michael I|last2=Travis|first2=Karl P|last3=Hand|first3=Russell J|journal=Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter|volume=19|issue=41|pages=415107|bibcode = 2007JPCM...19O5107O }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Ironing.jpg|thumb|right|In ironing, a fabric is heated through the glass-rubber transition.]]

===Polymers===
In [[polymer]]s the glass transition temperature, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, is often expressed as the temperature at which the [[Gibbs free energy]] is such that the [[activation energy]] for the cooperative movement of 50 or so elements of the polymer is exceeded {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. This allows molecular chains to slide past each other when a force is applied. From this definition, we can see that the introduction of relatively stiff chemical groups (such as [[benzene]] rings) will interfere with the flowing process and hence increase ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Cowie, J. M. G. and Arrighi, V., Polymers: Chemistry and Physics of Modern Materials, 3rd Edn. (CRC Press, 2007) {{ISBN|0748740732}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The stiffness of thermoplastics decreases due to this effect (see figure.) When the glass temperature has been reached, the stiffness stays the same for a while, i.e., at or near ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, until the temperature exceeds ''T''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, and the material melts. This region is called the rubber plateau.

In [[ironing]], a fabric is heated through this transition so that the polymer chains become mobile. The weight of the iron then imposes a preferred orientation. ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; can be significantly decreased by addition of [[plasticizer]]s into the polymer matrix. Smaller molecules of plasticizer embed themselves between the polymer chains, increasing the spacing and free volume, and allowing them to move past one another even at lower temperatures.  The addition of nonreactive [[side chain|side groups]] to a polymer can also make the chains stand off from one another, reducing ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;. If a plastic with some desirable properties has a ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; that is too high, it can sometimes be combined with another in a [[copolymer]] or [[composite material]] with a ''T''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; below the temperature of intended use. Note that some plastics are used at high temperatures, e.g., in automobile engines, and others at low temperatures.&lt;ref name="PVC"/&gt;
[[File:rubber plateau.svg|thumb|left|Stiffness versus temperature]]In [[Viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] materials, the presence of liquid-like behavior depends on the properties of and so varies with rate of applied load, i.e., how quickly a force is applied. The [[silicone]] toy [[Silly Putty]] behaves quite differently depending on the time rate of applying a force: pull slowly and it flows, acting as a heavily viscous liquid; hit it with a hammer and it shatters, acting as a glass.

On cooling, [[rubber]] undergoes a ''liquid-glass transition'', which has also been called a ''rubber-glass transition''.

== Mechanics of vitrification ==

{{Main|Vitrification}}

Molecular motion in condensed matter can be represented by a [[Fourier series]] whose physical interpretation consists of a [[superposition principle|superposition]] of [[longitudinal wave|longitudinal]] and [[transverse wave|transverse]] [[wave]]s of atomic displacement with varying directions and wavelengths. In monatomic systems, these waves are called ''[[density]] [[wikt:fluctuation|fluctuations]]''. (In polyatomic systems, they may also include [[wikt:composition|composition]]al fluctuations.)&lt;ref&gt;Slater, J.C., Introduction to Chemical Physics (3rd Ed., Martindell Press, 2007) {{ISBN|1178626598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, [[thermal motion]] in liquids can be decomposed into elementary [[Longitudinal wave|longitudinal vibrations]] (or acoustic [[phonon]]s) while [[transverse wave|transverse vibrations]] (or shear waves) were originally described only in [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] solids exhibiting the highly ordered crystalline state of matter. In other words, simple liquids cannot support an applied force in the form of a [[shearing stress]], and will yield mechanically via macroscopic [[plastic deformation]] (or viscous flow). Furthermore, the fact that a [[solid]] deforms locally while retaining its [[Stiffness|rigidity]] – while a [[liquid]] yields to macroscopic [[viscous flow]] in response to the application of an applied [[shearing force]] – is accepted by many as the mechanical distinction between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0305004100017138|title=On the stability of crystal lattices.

The inadequacies of this conclusion, however, were pointed out by Frenkel in his revision of the [[kinetic theory of solids]] and the [[theory of elasticity]] in [[liquid]]s. This revision follows directly from the continuous characteristic of the structural transition from the liquid state into the solid one when this transition is not accompanied by crystallization—ergo the supercooled [[viscous liquid]]. Thus we see the intimate correlation between transverse acoustic phonons (or shear waves) and the onset of rigidity upon [[vitrification]], as described by Bartenev in his mechanical description of the vitrification process.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frenkel, J.|title=Kinetic Theory of Liquids|publisher=Clarendon Press, Oxford|year=1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The velocities of longitudinal acoustic phonons in condensed matter are directly responsible for the [[thermal conductivity]] that levels out temperature differentials between [[Compressibility|compressed]] and [[Thermal expansion|expanded]] volume elements. Kittel proposed that the behavior of glasses is interpreted in terms of an approximately constant "[[mean free path]]" for lattice phonons, and that the value of the mean free path is of the [[order of magnitude]] of the scale of disorder in the molecular structure of a liquid or solid. The thermal phonon mean free paths or relaxation lengths of a number of glass formers have been plotted versus the glass transition temperature, indicating a linear relationship between the two. This has suggested a new criterion for glass formation based on the value of the phonon mean free path.&lt;ref&gt;

It has often been suggested that [[heat conduction|heat transport]] in [[dielectric]] solids occurs through elastic vibrations of the lattice, and that this transport is limited by elastic [[scattering]] of acoustic phonons by lattice defects (e.g. randomly spaced vacancies).&lt;ref&gt;Rosenburg, H. M. (1963) ''Low Temperature Solid State Physics''. Clarendon Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;
These predictions were confirmed by experiments on commercial [[glasses]] and glass [[Ceramic engineering|ceramic]]s, where mean free paths were apparently limited by "internal boundary scattering" to length scales of {{convert|10|–|100|µm}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kittel, C.

&lt;/ref&gt;
The relationship between these transverse waves and the mechanism of vitrification has been described by several authors who proposed that the onset of correlations between such phonons results in an orientational ordering or "freezing" of local shear stresses in glass-forming liquids, thus yielding the glass transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0022-3093(85)90256-X|title=Orientational ordering of local shear stresses in liquids: A phase transition?|year=1985|last1=Chen|first1=Shao-Ping|last2=Egami|first2=T.|last3=Vitek|first3=V.|journal=Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids|volume=75|issue=1–3|pages=449|bibcode = 1985JNCS...75..449C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electronic structure ===

The influence of [[thermal]] [[phonon]]s and their interaction with [[electron]]ic structure is a topic that was appropriately introduced in a discussion of the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of liquid metals. [http://phycomp.technion.ac.il/~phsorkin/thesis/node4.html Lindemann's theory of melting] is referenced, and it is suggested that the drop in [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]] in going from the [[crystal]]line to the liquid state is due to the increased [[scattering]] of conduction electrons as a result of the increased [[amplitude]] of atomic [[vibration]]. Such theories of localization have been applied to transport in [[metallic glass]]es, where the [[mean free path]] of the electrons is very small (on the order of the interatomic spacing).&lt;ref&gt;

The formation of a non-crystalline form of a gold-silicon alloy by the method of [[splat quenching]] from the melt led to further considerations of the influence of electronic structure on glass forming ability, based on the properties of the [[metallic bond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/187869b0|title=Non-crystalline Structure in Solidified Gold–Silicon Alloys|year=1960|last1=Klement|first1=W.|last2=Willens|first2=R.

Other work indicates that the [[Electron mobility|mobility]] of localized [[electron]]s is enhanced by the presence of dynamic phonon modes. One claim against such a model is that if [[chemical bonds]] are important, the [[nearly free electron model]]s should not be applicable. However, if the model includes the buildup of a [[charge distribution]] between all pairs of atoms just like a chemical bond (e.g., silicon, when a band is just filled with electrons) then it should apply to [[solid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, if the [[electrical conductivity]] is low, the [[mean free path]] of the electrons is very short. The electrons will only be sensitive to the [[short-range order]] in the glass since they do not get a chance to scatter from atoms spaced at large distances. Since the short-range order is similar in glasses and crystals, the electronic energies should be similar in these two states. For alloys with lower resistivity and longer electronic mean free paths, the electrons could begin to sense that there is [[Order and disorder (physics)|disorder]] in the glass, and this would raise their energies and destabilize the glass with respect to crystallization. Thus, the glass formation tendencies of certain alloys may therefore be due in part to the fact that the electron mean free paths are very short, so that only the short-range order is ever important for the energy of the electrons.

It has also been argued that glass formation in metallic systems is related to the "softness" of the interaction potential between unlike atoms. Some authors, emphasizing the strong similarities between the local structure of the glass and the corresponding crystal, suggest that chemical bonding helps to stabilize the amorphous structure.&lt;ref&gt;

Other authors have suggested that the electronic structure yields its influence on glass formation through the directional properties of bonds. Non-crystallinity is thus favored in elements with a large number of [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphic]] forms and a high degree of [[Chemical bond|bond]]ing [[anisotropy]]. Crystallization becomes more unlikely as bonding anisotropy is increased from [[isotropic]] [[metal]]lic to [[anisotropic]] [[metal]]lic to [[covalent]] bonding, thus suggesting a relationship between the [[chemical family|group number]] in the [[periodic table]] and the glass forming ability in [[elemental]] [[solid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Evolutionary biology}}
The '''history of molecular evolution''' starts in the early 20th century with "comparative biochemistry", but the field of [[molecular evolution]] came into its own in the 1960s and 1970s, following the rise of [[molecular biology]]. The advent of [[protein sequencing]] allowed molecular biologists to create phylogenies based on sequence comparison, and to use the differences between homologous sequences as a [[molecular clock]] to estimate the time since the last common ancestor. In the late 1960s, the [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]] provided a theoretical basis for the molecular clock, though both the clock and the neutral theory were controversial, since most evolutionary biologists held strongly to [[panselectionism]], with [[natural selection]] as the only important cause of evolutionary change. After the 1970s, nucleic acid sequencing allowed molecular evolution to reach beyond proteins to highly conserved [[ribosomal RNA]] sequences, the foundation of a reconceptualization of the early [[history of life]].

== Early history ==

Before the rise of [[molecular biology]] in the 1950s and 1960s, a small number of biologists had explored the possibilities of using biochemical differences between species to study [[evolution]].
[[Alfred Sturtevant]] predicted the existence of chromosomal inversions in 1921 and with [[Dobzhansky]] constructed one of the first molecular phylogenies on 17 Drosophila Pseudo-obscura strains from the accumulation of chromosomal inversions observed from the hybridization of polyten chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;Dobzhanski, Sturtevant, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ernest Baldwin]] worked extensively on [[comparative biochemistry]] beginning in the 1930s, and [[Marcel Florkin]] pioneered techniques for constructing [[phylogenies]] based on molecular and biochemical characters in the 1940s. However, it was not until the 1950s that biologists developed techniques for producing biochemical data for the quantitative study of [[molecular evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, "Paradox and Persuasion", pp. 90-91; Zuckerkandl, "On the Molecular Evolutionary Clock", p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The first molecular systematics research was based on immunological [[assay]]s and protein "fingerprinting" methods. [[Alan Boyden]]—building on immunological methods of [[George Nuttall]]—developed new techniques beginning in 1954, and in the early 1960s [[Curtis Williams (immunologist)|Curtis Williams]] and [[Morris Goodman]] used immunological comparisons to study [[primate]] phylogeny. Others, such as [[Linus Pauling]] and his students, applied newly developed combinations of [[electrophoresis]] and [[paper chromatography]] to proteins subject to partial digestion by [[digestive enzymes]] to create unique two-dimensional patterns, allowing fine-grained comparisons of homologous proteins.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, "Paradox and Persuasion", pp. 90-91; Morgan, "Emile Zuckerkandl, Linus Pauling, and the Molecular Evolutionary Clock", pp. 161-162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1950s, a few naturalists also experimented with molecular approaches—notably [[Ernst Mayr]] and [[Charles Sibley]]. While Mayr quickly soured on paper chromatography, Sibley successfully applied electrophoresis to egg-white proteins to sort out problems in bird taxonomy, soon supplemented that with [[DNA hybridization]] techniques—the beginning of a long career built on [[molecular systematics]].&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, "Naturalists, Molecular Biologists, and the Challenges of Molecular Evolution", pp. 335-339&lt;/ref&gt;

While such early biochemical techniques found grudging acceptance in the biology community, for the most part they did not impact the main theoretical problems of evolution and population genetics. This would change as molecular biology shed more light on the physical and chemical nature of genes.

=== Genetic load, the classical/balance controversy, and the measurement of heterozygosity ===

At the time that molecular biology was coming into its own in the 1950s, there was a long-running debate—the classical/balance controversy—over the causes of [[heterosis]], the increase in fitness observed when inbred lines are outcrossed. In 1950, [[James F. Crow]] offered two different explanations (later dubbed the ''classical'' and ''balance'' positions) based on the paradox first articulated by [[J. B. S. Haldane]] in 1937: the effect of deleterious mutations on the average fitness of a population depends only on the rate of mutations (not the degree of harm caused by each mutation) because more-harmful mutations are eliminated more quickly by natural selection, while less-harmful mutations remain in the population longer. [[H. J. Muller]] dubbed this "[[genetic load]]".&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, "The Origins of the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution", pp. 25-28&lt;/ref&gt;

Muller, motivated by his concern about the effects of radiation on human populations, argued that heterosis is primarily the result of deleterious homozygous recessive alleles, the effects of which are masked when separate lines are crossed—this was the ''dominance hypothesis'', part of what Dobzhansky labeled the ''classical position''. Thus, ionizing radiation and the resulting mutations produce considerable genetic load even if death or disease does not occur in the exposed generation, and in the absence of mutation natural selection will gradually increase the level of homozygosity. [[Bruce Wallace]], working with [[J. C. King]], used the ''overdominance hypothesis'' to develop the ''balance position'', which left a larger place for [[overdominance]] (where the heterozygous state of a gene is more fit than the homozygous states). In that case, heterosis is simply the result of the increased expression of [[heterozygote advantage]]. If overdominant loci are common, then a high level of heterozygosity would result from natural selection, and mutation-inducing radiation may in fact facilitate an increase in fitness due to overdominance. (This was also the view of Dobzhansky.)&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, "The Origins of the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution", pp. 26-31&lt;/ref&gt;

Debate continued through 1950s, gradually becoming a central focus of population genetics. A 1958 study of ''Drosophila'' by Wallace suggested that radiation-induced mutations ''increased'' the viability of previously homozygous flies, providing evidence for heterozygote advantage and the balance position; Wallace estimated that 50% of loci in natural ''Drosophila'' populations were heterozygous. [[Motoo Kimura]]'s subsequent mathematical analyses reinforced what Crow had suggested in 1950: that even if overdominant loci are rare, they could be responsible for a disproportionate amount of genetic variability. Accordingly, Kimura and his mentor Crow came down on the side of the classical position. Further collaboration between Crow and Kimura led to the [[infinite alleles model]], which could be used to calculate the number of different alleles expected in a population, based on population size, mutation rate, and whether the mutant alleles were neutral, overdominant, or deleterious. Thus, the infinite alleles model offered a potential way to decide between the classical and balance positions, if accurate values for the level of heterozygosity could be found.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, "The Origins of the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution", pp. 33-41&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1960s, the techniques of biochemistry and molecular biology—in particular [[electrophoresis|protein electrophoresis]]—provided a way to measure the level of heterozygosity in natural populations: a possible means to resolve the classical/balance controversy. In 1963, [[Jack L. Hubby]] published an electrophoresis study of protein variation in ''Drosophila'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hubby | first1 = J. L. | year = 1963 | title = Protein Differences in ''Drosophila''. I. ''Drosophila melanogaster'' | url = | journal = Genetics | volume = 48 | issue = 6| pages = 871–879 | pmid = 17248176 | pmc = 1210521 }}&lt;/ref&gt; soon after, Hubby began collaborating with [[Richard Lewontin]] to apply Hubby's method to the classical/balance controversy by measuring the proportion of heterozygous loci in natural populations. Their two landmark papers, published in 1966, established a significant level of heterozygosity for ''Drosophila'' (12%, on average).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hubby | first1 = J. L. | last2 = Lewontin | first2 = R. C. | year = 1966 | title = A Molecular Approach to the Study of Genic Heterozygosity in Natural Populations. I. The Number of Alleles at Different Loci in ''Drosophila pseudoobscura'' | url = | journal = Genetics | volume = 54 | issue = | pages = 546–595 }}; and {{cite journal | last1 = Lewontin | first1 = R. C. | last2 = Hubby | first2 = J. L. | year = 1966 | title = A Molecular Approach to the Study of Genic Heterozygosity in Natural Populations. II.

Most population geneticists (including Hubby and Lewontin) rejected the possibility of widespread neutral mutations; explanations that did not involve selection were anathema to mainstream evolutionary biology. Hubby and Lewontin also ruled out heterozygote advantage as the main cause because of the [[segregation load]] it would entail, though critics argued that the findings actually fit well with overdominance hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, "The Origins of the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution", pp. 42-45&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protein sequences and the molecular clock ===

While evolutionary biologists were tentatively branching out into molecular biology, molecular biologists were rapidly turning their attention toward evolution.

After developing the fundamentals of protein sequencing with [[insulin]] between 1951 and 1955, [[Frederick Sanger]] and his colleagues had published a limited interspecies comparison of the insulin sequence in 1956. [[Francis Crick]], [[Charles Sibley]] and others recognized the potential for using biological sequences to construct phylogenies, though few such sequences were yet available. By the early 1960s, techniques for [[protein sequencing]] had advanced to the point that direct comparison of homologous amino acid sequences was feasible.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, "Naturalists, Molecular Biologists, and the Challenge of Molecular Evolution", pp. 323-325&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, [[Emanuel Margoliash]] and his collaborators completed the sequence for horse [[cytochrome c]] (a longer and more widely distributed protein than insulin), followed in short order by a number of other species.

In 1962, [[Linus Pauling]] and [[Emile Zuckerkandl]] proposed using the number of differences between homologous protein sequences to estimate the time since [[Genetic divergence|divergence]], an idea Zuckerkandl had conceived around 1960 or 1961. This began with Pauling's long-time research focus, [[hemoglobin]], which was being sequenced by [[Walter Schroeder]]; the sequences not only supported the accepted vertebrate phylogeny, but also the hypothesis (first proposed in 1957) that the different globin chains within a single organism could also be traced to a common ancestral protein.&lt;ref&gt;Zuckerkandl, "On the Molecular Evolutionary Clock", pp. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1962 and 1965, Pauling and Zuckerkandl refined and elaborated this idea, which they dubbed the [[molecular clock]], and [[Emil L. Smith]] and Emanuel Margoliash expanded the analysis to cytochrome c. Early molecular clock calculations agreed fairly well with established divergence times based on paleontological evidence. However, the essential idea of the molecular clock—that individual proteins evolve at a regular rate independent of a species' [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] evolution—was extremely provocative (as Pauling and Zuckerkandl intended it to be).&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, "Paradox and Persuasion", pp. 91-94&lt;/ref&gt;

== The "molecular wars" ==

From the early 1960s, molecular biology was increasingly seen as a threat to the traditional core of evolutionary biology. Established evolutionary biologists—particularly [[Ernst Mayr]], [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] and [[G. G. Simpson]], three of the founders of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] of the 1930s and 1940s—were extremely skeptical of molecular approaches, especially when it came to the connection (or lack thereof) to [[natural selection]]. Molecular evolution in general—and the molecular clock in particular—offered little basis for exploring evolutionary causation. According to the molecular clock hypothesis, proteins evolved essentially independently of the environmentally determined forces of selection; this was sharply at odds with the [[panselectionism]] prevalent at the time. Moreover, Pauling, Zuckerkandl, and other molecular biologists were increasingly bold in asserting the significance of "informational macromolecules" (DNA, RNA and proteins) for ''all'' biological processes, including evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, "Paradox and Persuasion", pp. 94-100&lt;/ref&gt; The struggle between evolutionary biologists and molecular biologists—with each group holding up their discipline as the center of biology as a whole—was later dubbed the "molecular wars" by [[Edward O. Wilson]], who experienced firsthand the domination of his biology department by young molecular biologists in the late 1950s and the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Naturalist'', pp. 219-237&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Mayr began arguing for a clear distinction between ''functional biology'' (which considered [[proximate causation|proximate causes]] and asked "how" questions) and ''evolutionary biology'' (which considered ultimate causes and asked "why" questions)&lt;ref&gt;Mayr's first published argument for the proximate/ultimate distinction was: {{cite journal | last1 = Mayr | first1 = Ernst | year = 1961 | title = Cause and Effect in Biology | url = | journal = Science | volume = 134 | issue = 3489| pages = 1501–1506 | pmid = 14471768 | doi = 10.1126/science.134.3489.1501 | bibcode = 1961Sci...134.1501M }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that both disciplines and individual scientists could be classified on either the ''functional'' or ''evolutionary'' side, and that the two approaches to biology were complementary. Mayr, Dobzhansky, Simpson and others used this distinction to argue for the continued relevance of organismal biology, which was rapidly losing ground to molecular biology and related disciplines in the competition for funding and university support.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, "Naturalists, Molecular Biologists, and the Challenges of Molecular Evolution", pp. 333-335&lt;/ref&gt; It was in that context that Dobzhansky first published his famous statement, "[[nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution]]", in a 1964 paper affirming the importance of organismal biology in the face of the molecular threat; Dobzhansky characterized the molecular disciplines as "[[Cartesianism|Cartesian]]" (reductionist) and organismal disciplines as "[[Darwinian]]".&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, "Paradox and Persuation", pp. 100-103. Dobzhansky's famous phrase appears in the first page of: {{cite journal |first= Theodosius |last= Dobzhansky |authorlink= Theodosius Dobzhansky |title= Biology, Molecular and Organismic |journal= American Zoologist |volume= 4 |issue= 4 |date= November 1964 |pages= 443-452 |doi= 10.1093/icb/4.4.443 |jstor= 3881145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayr and Simpson attended many of the early conferences where molecular evolution was discussed, critiquing what they saw as the overly simplistic approaches of the molecular clock. The molecular clock, based on uniform rates of genetic change driven by random mutations and drift, seemed incompatible with the varying rates of evolution and environmentally-driven adaptive processes (such as [[adaptive radiation]]) that were among the key developments of the evolutionary synthesis. At the 1962 Wenner-Gren conference, the 1964 Colloquium on the Evolution of Blood Proteins in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]], and the 1964 [[Conference on Evolving Genes and Proteins]] at [[Rutgers University]], they engaged directly with the molecular biologists and biochemists, hoping to maintain the central place of Darwinian explanations in evolution as its study spread to new fields.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, "Paradox and Persuation", pp. 95-98; Hagen, "Naturalists, Molecular Biologists, and the Challenges of Molecular Evolution", pp. 330-332&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gene-centered view of evolution ===

Though not directly related to molecular evolution, the mid-1960s also saw the rise of the [[gene-centered view of evolution]], spurred by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]]'s ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]'' (1966). Debate over [[units of selection]], particularly the controversy over [[group selection]], led to increased focus on individual genes (rather than whole organisms or populations) as the theoretical basis for evolution. However, the increased focus on genes did not mean a focus on molecular evolution; in fact, the [[adaptationism]] promoted by Williams and other evolutionary theories further marginalized the apparently non-adaptive changes studied by molecular evolutionists.

== The neutral theory of molecular evolution ==
{{further|Neutral theory of molecular evolution}}

The intellectual threat of molecular evolution became more explicit in 1968, when Motoo Kimura introduced the [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Motoo Kimura, [Evolutionary Rate at the Molecular Level", ''Nature'', Vol. 217 (1968), pp. 624-626&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on the available molecular clock studies (of hemoglobin from a wide variety of mammals, cytochrome c from mammals and birds, and [[triosephosphate dehydrogenase]] from rabbits and cows), Kimura (assisted by [[Tomoko Ohta]]) calculated an average rate of DNA substitution of one [[base pair]] change per 300 base pairs (encoding 100 amino acids) per 28 million years.  For mammal genomes, this indicated a substitution rate of one every 1.8 years, which would produce an unsustainably high [[Haldane's dilemma|substitution load]] unless the preponderance of substitutions was selectively neutral.  Kimura argued that neutral mutations occur very frequently, a conclusion compatible with the results of the electrophoretic studies of protein heterozygosity.  Kimura also applied his earlier mathematical work on genetic drift to explain how neutral mutations could come to [[fixation (population genetics)|fixation]], even in the absence of natural selection; he soon convinced James F. Crow of the potential power of neutral alleles and genetic drift as well.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, "The Origins of the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution", pp. 46-50&lt;/ref&gt;

Kimura's theory—described only briefly in a letter to ''Nature''—was followed shortly after with a more substantial analysis by [[Jack L. King]] and [[Thomas H. Jukes]]—who titled their first paper on the subject "[[non-Darwinian evolution]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.164.3881.788 | last1 = King | first1 = Jack L. | last2 = Jukes | first2 = Thomas | year = 1969 | title = Non-Darwinian Evolution | url = | journal = Science | volume = 164 | issue = 3881| pages = 788–798 | pmid = 5767777 | bibcode = 1969Sci...164..788L }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though King and Jukes produced much lower estimates of substitution rates and the resulting genetic load in the case of non-neutral changes, they agreed that neutral mutations driven by genetic drift were both real and significant.  The fairly constant rates of evolution observed for individual proteins was not easily explained without invoking neutral substitutions (though G. G. Simpson and Emil Smith had tried).  Jukes and King also found a strong correlation between the frequency of amino acids and the number of different codons encoding each amino acid. This pointed to substitutions in protein sequences as being largely the product of random genetic drift.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, "The Origins of the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution", pp. 50-54&lt;/ref&gt;

King and Jukes' paper, especially with the provocative title, was seen as a direct challenge to mainstream neo-Darwinism, and it brought molecular evolution and the neutral theory to the center of evolutionary biology.  It provided a mechanism for the molecular clock and a theoretical basis for exploring deeper issues of molecular evolution, such as the relationship between rate of evolution and functional importance.  The rise of the neutral theory marked synthesis of evolutionary biology and molecular biology—though an incomplete one.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, "The Origins of the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution", pp. 54, 57-58&lt;/ref&gt;

With their work on firmer theoretical footing, in 1971 Emile Zuckerkandl and other molecular evolutionists founded the ''[[Journal of Molecular Evolution]]''.

=== The neutralist-selectionist debate and near-neutrality ===

The critical responses to the neutral theory that soon appeared marked the beginning of the ''neutralist-selectionist debate''.  In short, selectionists viewed natural selection as the primary or only cause of evolution, even at the molecular level, while neutralists held that neutral mutations were widespread and that genetic drift was a crucial factor in the evolution of proteins.  Kimura became the most prominent defender of the neutral theory—which would be his main focus for the rest of his career.  With Ohta, he refocused his arguments on the rate at which drift could fix new mutations in finite populations, the significance of constant protein evolution rates, and the functional constraints on protein evolution that biochemists and molecular biologists had described.  Though Kimura had initially developed the neutral theory partly as an outgrowth of the ''classical position'' within the classical/balance controversy (predicting high genetic load as a consequence of non-neutral mutations), he gradually deemphasized his original argument that segregational load would be impossibly high without neutral mutations (which many selectionists, and even fellow neutralists King and Jukes, rejected).&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, "The Origins of the Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution", pp. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s through the early 1980s, both selectionists and neutralists could explain the observed high levels of heterozygosity in natural populations, by assuming different values for unknown parameters.  Early in the debate, Kimura's student [[Tomoko Ohta]] focused on the interaction between natural selection and genetic drift, which was significant for mutations that were not strictly neutral, but nearly so.  In such cases, selection would compete with drift: most slightly deleterious mutations would be eliminated by natural selection or chance; some would move to fixation through drift.  The behavior of this type of mutation, described by an equation that combined the mathematics of the neutral theory with classical models, became the basis of Ohta's [[nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Ohta, "The current significance and standing of neutral and nearly neutral theories", pp. 673-674&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Ohta published a short letter in ''Nature''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/246096a0| volume = 246| issue = 5428| pages = 96–98| last = Ohta| first = Tomoko| title = Slightly Deleterious Mutant Substitutions in Evolution| journal = Nature| date = 1973-11-09| pmid = 4585855| bibcode = 1973Natur.246...96O}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that a wide variety of molecular evidence supported the theory that most mutation events at the molecular level are slightly deleterious rather than strictly neutral.  Molecular evolutionists were finding that while rates of protein evolution (consistent with the [[molecular clock]]) were fairly independent of [[generation time]], rates of [[noncoding DNA]] divergence were inversely proportional to generation time.  Noting that population size is generally inversely proportional to generation time, Tomoko Ohta proposed that most amino acid substitutions are slightly deleterious while noncoding DNA substitutions are more neutral.  In this case, the faster rate of neutral evolution in proteins expected in small populations (due to genetic drift) is offset by longer generation times (and vice versa), but in large populations with short generation times, noncoding DNA evolves faster while protein evolution is retarded by selection (which is more significant than drift for large populations).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 49| issue = 2| pages = 128–42| last = Ohta| first = Tomoko|author2=John H. Gillespie| title = Development of Neutral and Nearly Neutral Theories| journal = Theoretical Population Biology| date = April 1996| doi = 10.1006/tpbi.1996.0007| pmid = 8813019}}, pp 130-131&lt;/ref&gt;

Between then and the early 1990s, many studies of molecular evolution used a "shift model" in which the negative effect on the fitness of a population due to deleterious mutations shifts back to an original value when a mutation reaches fixation.  In the early 1990s, Ohta developed a "fixed model" that included both beneficial and deleterious mutations, so that no artificial "shift" of overall population fitness was necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Ohta and Gillispie, "Development of Neutral and Nearly Neutral Theories", pp. 135-136&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Ohta, however, the nearly neutral theory largely fell out of favor in the late 1980s, because the mathematically simpler neutral theory for the widespread [[molecular systematics]] research that flourished after the advent of rapid [[DNA sequencing]].  As more detailed systematics studies started to compare the evolution of genome regions subject to strong selection versus weaker selection in the 1990s, the nearly neutral theory and the interaction between selection and drift have once again become an important focus of research.&lt;ref&gt;Ohta, "The current significance and standing of neutral and nearly neutral theories", p. 674&lt;/ref&gt;

== Microbial phylogeny ==

While early work in molecular evolution focused on readily sequenced proteins and relatively recent evolutionary history, by the late 1960s some molecular biologists were pushing further toward the base of the tree of life by studying highly conserved nucleic acid sequences.  [[Carl Woese]], a molecular biologist whose earlier work was on the genetic code and its origin, began using [[ribosomal RNA|small subunit ribosomal RNA]] to reclassify bacteria by genetic (rather than morphological) similarity.  Work proceeded slowly at first, but accelerated as new sequencing methods were developed in the 1970s and 1980s.  By 1977, Woese and [[George Fox]] announced that some bacteria, such as [[methanogen]]s, lacked the rRNA units that Woese's phylogenetic studies were based on; they argued that these organisms were actually distinct enough from conventional bacteria and the so-called [[higher organisms]] to form their own kingdom, which they called [[archaebacteria]].  Though controversial at first (and challenged again in the late 1990s), Woese's work became the basis of the modern [[three-domain system]] of [[Archaea]], [[Bacteria]], and [[Eukarya]] (replacing the five-domain system that had emerged in the 1960s).&lt;ref&gt;Sapp, ''Genesis'', pp. 224-228&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on microbial phylogeny also brought molecular evolution closer to [[cell biology]] and [[origin of life]] research.  The differences between archaea pointed to the importance of RNA in the early history of life.  In his work with the genetic code, Woese had suggested RNA-based life had preceded the current forms of DNA-based life, as had several others before him—an idea that [[Walter Gilbert]] would later call the "[[RNA world]]".  In many cases, genomics research in the 1990s produced phylogenies contradicting the rRNA-based results, leading to the recognition of widespread [[lateral gene transfer]] across distinct taxa.  Combined with the probable [[endosymbiotic]] origin of [[organelle]]-filled eukarya, this pointed to a far more complex picture of the origin and early history of life, one which might not be describable in the traditional terms of common ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Sapp, ''Genesis'', pp. 230-233&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
When a [[blindness|blind]] person wishes to cross a street and issues an instruction to the [[assistance dog]] to do so, the dog should refuse to move when such an action would put the person in harm's way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaadp.org/tasks.html |title=Assistance Dog Tasks |last=Froling |first=Joan |publisher=International Association of Assistance Dog Partners |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The animal understands that this contradicts the learned behavior to respond to the owner's instructions: instead it makes an alternative decision because the human is not in a position to decide safely.&lt;ref name="Computerworld"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/95504/Intelligent_Disobedience?taxonomyId=73&amp;pageNumber=1 |title=Intelligent Disobedience |last=K. Kapur |first=Gopal |date=August 30, 2004 |publisher=Computerworld |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dog in this case has the capacity to understand that it is performing such an action for the welfare of the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sanders |first=Clinton |title=Understanding Dogs: Living and Working with Canine Companions |publisher=Temple University Press |year=1999 |page=46 |isbn=1-56639-689-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lAq-qw0uKbgC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=intelligent+disobedience&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=u-KLFmBfQO&amp;sig=Yh0CwhJmZ3O-HpNv5yt7HwzH10U&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lbz_StHtJ4XinAfJ4eAX&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAgQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=intelligent%20disobedience&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another example, a blind person must communicate with the animal in such a way that the animal can recognize that the person is aware of the surroundings and can safely proceed. If a blind person wishes to descend a staircase, an animal properly trained to exhibit intelligent disobedience will refuse to move unless the person issues a specific code word or command that lets the animal know the person is aware they are about to descend stairs.&lt;ref name="tampa"&gt;{{cite news |title=Life moves forward with help of dog |author=Philip Morgan |newspaper=Tampa Tribune |date=June 21, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This command will be specific for staircases, and the animal will not attribute it to stepping off a curb or up onto a sidewalk or stoop. In a similar circumstance, if the person believes they are in front of a step and they wish to go down, but they are in fact standing in front of a dangerous precipice (for example, a [[loading dock]] or [[cliff]]), the animal will refuse to proceed.&lt;ref name="rich11"&gt;{{cite news |title=Another Pupil is Bound for Leader-Dog School; Helping to Raise Dogs for the Blind is 'Labor of Love' for VA. Woman |author=Donna Alvis-Banks |newspaper=Richmond Times |date=September 16, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application to other fields==
Ira Chaleff suggests in his 2015 book ''Intelligent Disobedience: Doing Right When What You're Told to Do Is Wrong'' that intelligent disobedience has a place in other important areas.  One notable example is [[crew resource management]], or CRM, where the flight crew of an aircraft is encouraged to bring anything that seems questionable about an order, or additional information,  to the captain's attention, usually respectfully and tactfully, but if it is urgent enough, more strongly, just as the guide dogs do.  He opens the book by mentioning how the idea came to him when he had a person who was training a guide dog in one of his classes.  Besides CRM, the principle is applicable in almost every other field, such as medicine, engineering, and business.

The '''International Social Science Council''' ('''ISSC''') was an international organisation promoting the [[social sciences|social sciences, including the economic and behavioural sciences]].  It was founded in 1952, under the auspices of [[UNESCO]]. 6-9 Oct 1952, Paris (France), following a Resolution at the 6th UNESCO General Conference in 1951. Statutes: adopted 19 Sep 1972; completed and revised 14 Nov 1979; revised: 17 Dec 1985; 3 Dec 1992; 27 Nov 1998; 8 Nov 2006; 10 Dec 2010. Registered in accordance with French Law.

In 2018 the ISSC merged with the [[International Council for Science|International Council for Science (ICSU)]] to create the [[International Science Council]].

==Mission==
The mission of the ISSC was to advance the social sciences - their quality, novelty and utility - in all parts of the world: 
* To advance social science research across national and regional boundaries; 
* To support social science capacity building, particularly in countries and regions where it is currently not well developed; 
* To provide a central clearinghouse for the collection, interpretation, analysis and dissemination of data on social science resources, their availability for research and their impact on society; * To broaden interdisciplinary collaboration among the social sciences; 
* To expand exchange and joint work between the social sciences, the humanities and other sciences; * To link social science knowledge effectively to public policies and local needs in order to improve the quality of people's lives; 
* To promote the social science literacy of citizens.

The activities of the Council were guided by the principles of academic freedom, pursuit of excellence, equitable access to scientific information and data, unfettered conduct of science, open communication and transparency, accountability, and the use of knowledge for societal value. In addition, the Council sought to support the participation of women, minorities and others under-represented in social science research.

==Governance and structure==
The ISSC was governed by a General Assembly, comprising the Council’s membership. The General Assembly met every three years to review the Council’s activities and determine the general direction of its future work.

The ISSC Executive Committee was elected by the General Assembly and acted as the Council’s governing body. It consisted of the President, two Vice-Presidents and a Treasurer, as well as ten further members (Ordinary Members). 

The General Assembly, on recommendation of the Executive Committee, approved the appointment of the Executive Director, who headed the Council’s Secretariat, and served as an ex-officio member of the Executive Committee and of all appointed (standing or ad hoc) committees of the ISSC.

The Council was advised and guided by individuals from around the world who volunteered their time to serve on various ISSC Committees and Working Groups.

==Activities==
The ISSC led a number of flagship activities and was a partner on many collaborative initiatives.

===World Social Science Report===
The ISSC produced the World Social Science Report every three years, as part of its strategic partnership with [[UNESCO]]. The reports aim to address important social science challenges, take stock of social science contributions and capacities, and to make recommendations for future research, practice and policy.

* The World Social Science Report 2010: Knowledge Divides was prepared by the ISSC and published by UNESCO in June 2010. It reviewed social science knowledge production and use in different regions of the world and assessed how the social sciences are evolving in the face of unequal conditions and diverging trends.
* The World Social Science Report 2013: Changing Global Environments was prepared by the ISSC and co-published with UNESCO and the [[OECD]]. It was launched at UNESCO in Paris in November 2013.
* The World Social Science Report 2016: Challenging Inequalities – Pathways to a Just World was prepared by the ISSC in collaboration with the [[Institute of Development Studies|Institute of Development Studies (IDS)]], and co-published with UNESCO. It was launched in Stockholm on September 22 2016.

===World Social Science Forum===
The ISSC convened the World Social Science Forum. These events gather researchers, funders, policymakers, and other stakeholders to debate topics of global significance and to determine future priorities for international social science. 

* The ISSC convened the first ever World Social Science Forum in Bergen, Norway, 10-12 May 2009, on the topic 'One planet - worlds apart?'
* The second World Social Science Forum, 'Social Transformations and the Digital Age', took place in Montreal, Canada, in October 2013.
* The third World Social Science Forum, 'Transforming Global Relations for a Just World', took place in Durban, South Africa, 13-16 September 2015.
* The fourth World Social Science Forum will take place in Fukuoka, Japan, in September 2018. The theme is 'Security and Equality for Sustainable Futures'.

===Transformations to Sustainability===
Transformations to Sustainability (T2S) is a research programme supporting social-science-led research on social transformations to greater sustainability. The programme is funded by the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency|Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida)]] and has supported 38 seed projects (September 2014 to March 2015) and three Transformative Knowledge Networks (December 2015 to December 2018). The programme aims to build on the networks of knowledge gathered through the seed projects and Transformative Knowledge Networks to create and leave behind a lasting global knowledge base. 

The Transformations to Sustainability programme contributes to [[Future Earth]].

===Programmes and networks===
The ISSC initiated and supported several international research programmes with the objective of fostering comparative, interdisciplinary research by setting up networks of social scientists from different disciplines and regions of the world.The ISSC co-sponsored a number of international research programmes and networks around various themes, such as the environment, disaster risk, poverty and gender. These initiatives were undertaken in partnership with various partners and other organisations around the world.

* [[Future Earth]]
* [[International Human Dimensions Programme]]
* [http://www.irdrinternational.org/ Integrated Research on Disaster Risk]
* [http://www.csun.edu/~isscggd/ Gender, Globalisation and Democratisation Network]

===Prizes===
The ISSC awarded two prestigious international prizes: the [[Stein Rokkan Prize for Comparative Social Science Research]] and the Foundation Mattei Dogan Prize for Excellence in Interdisciplinary Research.

Nominations for the prize were made by ISSC members or other professional associations in various disciplines, as well as by universities and academic institutions. The selection of a winner is made by an international jury of scholars.

===World Social Science Fellows===
From 2012 to 2015 the ISSC led the World Social Science Fellows programme, an international scientific programme to support early-career researchers in the social sciences, with the aim of fostering a new generation of globally-networked research leaders who will collaborate in addressing global problems with particular relevance for low and middle income countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6788">'''Jeremy Paul Axford Commons''' (born 17 December 1933)&lt;ref name="MCreg"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Levens|editor1-first=R.G.C.|title=Merton College Register 1900-1964|date=1964|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford|page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[New Zealand]] [[opera]] historian, scholar, [[impresario]] and [[librettist]]. He is an authority on nineteenth-century Italian opera and has published major works on the composers [[Gaetano Donizetti]] and [[Nicola Vaccai|Nicola Vaccaj]].

== Academic career ==

Commons was born in [[Auckland]] in 1933. After graduating MA in English from [[Auckland University]] and [[Merton College, Oxford]],&lt;ref name=MCreg /&gt; he spent a year in [[Italy]] as an Italian Government scholarship-holder studying early nineteenth century opera.

He returned to New Zealand in 1959 and worked for the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (New Zealand)|Department of External Affairs]] as a junior [[diplomat]], with postings at New Zealand's [[Embassy]] in [[Paris]]&lt;ref name=MCreg /&gt; and the [[High Commission of New Zealand in London|High Commission in London]].

He joined the English Department at [[Victoria University Wellington]] in 1967 as a [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] and taught English literature, specialising in the [[Augustan literature|Augustan]] period. Since retiring in 1989, he has devoted his attention full-time to opera-related projects.

In 2006, he was awarded an [[Honorary degree|Honorary]] [[Doctorate]] of Literature from Victoria University for his revival of, and research into, nineteenth-century Italian operas.

== Research and publications ==

He has spent many years in Italian libraries and archives, uncovering not only neglected opera composers and their scores, but also collections of their letters and papers, contemporary accounts and reviews, thus building up an invaluable picture of their lives and productions.

Among other forgotten works he has been instrumental in rediscovering, he has edited in collaboration with the Milanese conductor Daniele Ferrari the opera ''Il convitato di pietra'' (1832), a version of the [[Don Giovanni]] story written by the Italian composer [[Giovanni Pacini]]. The work was given its first modern-day performance at the 2008 [[Rossini in Wildbad]] Festival. The work has been recorded by [[Naxos Records]].

His first major scholarly work was the 1,652 page volume ''The First Performances of the Operas of Donizetti'', produced in collaboration with Annalisa Bini and published in Italian in 1997. On his own he subsequently published in 2008 a collection of more than 2000 letters he has transcribed and edited that were written by or to the composer Nicola Vaccaj, a contemporary of [[Rossini]] and Donizetti, whose singing exercises are used by singers to this day.

At various times during his career, he has been commissioned to write essays, introductions and notes by opera companies in various parts of the world including [[Opera Australia]], San Francisco and [[English National Opera]]. He has worked with leading exponents of Italian opera such as [[Dame Joan Sutherland]] and conductor [[Richard Bonynge]] on articles to accompany their recordings for [[Decca Records]]. Since 1975, he has been a researcher and writer for the London-based company [[Opera Rara]], which has issued award-winning recordings of neglected nineteenth-century Italian operas.

== Opera productions ==

As a producer, Commons has focused on small-scale salon operas, suitable for performance by small groups operating on limited budgets.

He collaborated with the [[Waikato]] Opera Group (later Opera Waikato) in presenting operas by [[Giuseppe Balducci]], whose works he had found in the library of the [[Naples]] [[Conservatorium]]. These included ''I gelosi'' (1993), ''Il noce di Benevento'' (1995) and ''Scherzo'' (1996). He also collaborated with [[Dunedin|Dunedin’s]] Marama Opera  on a production of [[Chabrier|Chabrier’s]] ''[[Une éducation manquée|Une Education manquée]]'' (1996).

In 1995, he branched out on his own with a production of [[Jean-Baptiste Weckerlin]]'s ''La Laitière de Trianon''. Three other Weckerlin salon operas followed: ''Entre deux Feux!'' (1997) ''Le Mariage en poste'' (1999) and ''Carmontel'' (2001), as well as [[Gustave Nadaud]]'s ''Le Docteur Vieuxtemps'' (1998).

In 2002 he established the Sirius Opera label. It ceased operations in 2006.

== Libretti ==

From 1997, he has written libretti for small-scale works in collaboration with several New Zealand composers.

With [[Dorothy Quita Buchanan]] he wrote ''The Mansfield Stories'' (''The Woman at the Store'', ''Miss Brill'' and ''The Daughters of the Late Colonel''). He mounted the first of these in 1998. Orchestrated versions of all three were presented in 1999. He also collaborated with Buchanan on ''It Began with a Pony'' (2003).

With [[John Drummond (musicologist)|John Drummond]] he has produced six operas: ''Mr Polly at the Potwell Inn'' (2000), ''A Beleaguered City'' (2002), ''Marriage à la Mode'' (2004), ''Impersonating Maurice'' (2005), ''Mrs Windermere'' (2006) and ''The Genteel Pigeons'' (2006).

He was the co-librettist with [[Ivan Bootham]] for ''The Death of Venus'' (2002).

He also adapted [[Ian Cross]]'s novel ''[[The God Boy]]'' as a libretto for composer [[Anthony Ritchie]]. The resulting opera was premiered by the [[Dunedin]] Opera Company (Opera Otago) at the 2004 Otago Festival of the Arts, and was subsequently given at the 2006 [[Canterbury University]] Platform Arts Festival.

== Other activities ==

He was president of the New Zealand Opera Society from 1981-1988, and from 1985–1989 he also edited its magazine ''Opera News''. He remains the society's Patron.

He lives in [[Wellington]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28531">'''Jewish commentaries on the Bible''' are [[List of biblical commentaries|biblical commentaries]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]] (the [[Tanakh]]) from a Jewish perspective. Translations into [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and English, and some universally accepted Jewish commentaries with notes on their method of approach and modern translations into English with notes are listed.

== Earliest printing ==
The complete Tanakh in Hebrew, with commentaries by [[Rashi]], [[Radak]], [[Nahmanides|Ramban]], and [[Ralbag]] was printed in 1517 by [[Daniel Bomberg]] and edited by [[Felix Pratensis]] under the name [[Mikraot Gedolot]].

The Tanakh was handed down in manuscript form along with a method of checking the accuracy of the transcription known as [[Masoretic Text|mesorah]]. Many codices containing the [[Masoretic Text]] were gathered by [[Jacob ben Hayyim ibn Adonijah]] and were used to publish an accurate text. It was published by [[Daniel Bomberg]] in 1525. Later editions were edited with the help of [[Elia Levita]]. Various editions of Mikraot Gedolot are still in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/TalmudMap/MG.html |title=Mikra'ot Gedolot |publisher=Ucalgary.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Translations ==

=== Targum ===
A [[Targum]] is a translation of the Bible into [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]. The classic Targumim are [[Targum Onkelos]] on the [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (a [[Torah]] in printed form), [[Targum Jonathan]] on [[Nevi'im]] (the Prophets), and a fragmentary [[Targum Yerushalmi]]. There is no standard Aramaic translation of the [[Ketuvim]].&lt;ref&gt;Megilla 3a&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Targim Onkelos ====
[[Targum Onkelos]] is the most often consulted literal translation of the Bible&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Judaica:Bible:Targum Onkelos:third paragrph&lt;/ref&gt; with a few exceptions. Figurative language is usually not translated literally but is explained (e.g., Gen. 49:25; Ex. 15:3, 8, 10; 29:35). Geographical names are often replaced by those current at a later time (e.g., Gen. 10:10; Deut. 3:17).

According to the [[Talmud]],&lt;ref&gt;Bavli, Megilla, 3a as understood by the Marshah, Chidushai Agadot on Nedorim, 9b. See also the Yam Shel Shlomo on Yebomot chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt; the Torah and its translation into Aramaic were given to Moses on Mount Sinai, because Egyptian slaves spoke Aramaic. After the [[Babylonian exile]], the Targum was completely forgotten. [[Onkelos]], a Roman convert to Judaism, was able to reconstruct the original Aramaic. [[Saadia Gaon]] disagrees and says the Aramaic of Onkelos was never a spoken language. He believed that Onkelos's Aramaic was an artificial construct, a combination of Eastern and Western dialects of Aramaic.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Judaica: Bible&lt;/ref&gt; The mayor commentary on Targum Onkelos is "Netinah LaGer" written by [[Nathan Marcus Adler]].

==== Targum Jonathan ====
According to scholars, Targum Jonathan found in the [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] was not written by [[Jonathan ben Uzziel]], who refer to it instead as [[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan]]. According to the ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', 2nd ed., vol. 3, p. 591&lt;/ref&gt; internal evidence shows that it was written sometime between the 7th and 14th centuries CE. For example, [[Ishmael]]'s wife's name is translated into Aramaic as [[Fatima (name)|Fatima]] (who was Mohammed's daughter) and therefore Targum Pseudo-Jonathan must have been written after [[Mohammed]]'s birth. The classic Hebrew commentators would turn this argument around, and say that Mohammed's daughter was named after Ismael's wife. Both sides will agree, however that stylistically Jonathan's commentary on the Chumash is very different from the commentary on [[Neviim]]. The Targum Jonathan on Neviim is written in a very terse style, similar to Onkelos on Chumash, but on the average Targum Jonathan on Chumash is almost twice as wordy.

==== Targum Yerushalmi ====
The Jerusalem Targum exists only in fragmentary form. It translates a total of approximately 850 verses, phrases, and words. No one knows who wrote it. Some speculate that it was a printers error. The printer saw a manuscript headed with "TY" and assumed it was a Targum Yerushalmi when actually it was an early version of Targum Yonathan. Others speculate that it was written by a R. Yosef or R. Hoshea (Yihoshua).&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein's ''Otzer Yisrael'', v. 10 p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

::* ''[[Be'er Mayim Chaim]]'', by [[Chaim ben Betzalel]] (1515–1588), the older brother of [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]].
::* ''[[Amar Nekeh]]'', by [[Obadiah ben Abraham Bartenura]] (c. 1440–1516), a leading rabbi of Italy and Jerusalem, best known for his commentary on the [[Mishnah]].
::* ''[[Divrei David]]'', by [[David HaLevi Segal]] (1586–1667), a [[history of the Jews in Poland|Polish]] rabbinical authority known as the ''Taz'' for his classic commentary on the [[Shulchan Aruch]].
::* ''[[Gur Aryeh al haTorah]]'', by the [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] (1526–1609), known for this work and for his fundamental works on Jewish philosophy and [[Jewish mysticism|mysticism]]
::* ''[[Maskil le-David]]'', by [[David Pardo (Italian rabbi)|David Pardo]] (1710–1792).
::* ''[[Sefer ha-Mizrachi]]'', by [[Elijah Mizrachi]] (1450–1525), which has itself spawned multiple supercommentaries such as ''Yeri'ot Shlomo'' by [[Solomon Luria]] and ''Leshon Arummim'' by [[Barzillai ben Baruch Jabez]].
::* [[Nachalas Yitzchak]]
::* ''[[Sefer Ha-zikaron]]'', by [[Abraham Lévy-Bacrat]], who lived through the [[Alhambra Decree|Spanish Expulsion]] of 1492.
::* ''[[Siftei Chachamim]]'', by [[Shabbethai Bass]], which analyzes other supercommentaries on Rashi and is considered important enough that a shortened version, ''Ikkar Sifsei Chachamim,'' is often printed with the commentary of Rashi.
* [[Rashbam]] 1085–1158
:: Rashbam (Samuel ben Meir) was the grandson of [[Rashi]] and the brother of [[Rabbeinu Tam]].
* [[Tobiah ben Eliezer]] 11th century [[Greece]]
:: Tobiah ben Eliezer was a [[Romaniote Jews|Romaniote]] scholar and ''[[paytan]]'', who wrote the ''Leḳaḥ Ṭov'' or ''Pesiḳta Zuṭarta'', a [[midrash]]ic commentary on the [[Pentateuch]] and the Five [[Megillot]]. The Talmudic passages which he cites in connection with the halakot he often interprets according to his own judgment and differently from Rashi. Like many other Biblical commentators, he translates certain words into the language of the country in which he is living, namely, [[Greek language|Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;*Kaufmann, ''Eine unbekannte messianische Bewegung unter den Juden, in Jahrbuch für Jüdische Geschichte und Literatur'', i. 148 et seq., Berlin, 1898&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] 1092–1167
:: Ibn Ezra was a contemporary of the Rashbam. His commentary on [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] was reprinted under the name Sefer HaYashar. He clearly separates the literal meaning of a biblical verse from the traditional meaning, upon which the halacha is based, and from the homiletic meaning ''drush''. He explains that the traditional meaning and the homiletic meaning do not attempt to imply meaning to the verse; they only uses the verse as a mnemonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| encyclopedia=The Online Jewish Encyclopedia| title=Ibn Ezra, Abraham| date=1901–1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[David Kimhi]] 1160–1235
:: David Kimchi followed the methodology of Ibn Ezra. He deemphasised homiletics and emphasised the Talmudic interpretations when they reached his standard of [[peshat]]. In his exegesis he strove for clarity and readability, as opposed to his predecessors who emphasised conciseness.&lt;ref&gt;Talmage, Frank. "Kimhi, David." ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''. Eds. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik. Vol. 12. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. pp. 155–156.&lt;/ref&gt; His commentaries are said to have "a remarkably modern flavor"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ou.org/judaism-101/bios/leaders-in-the-diaspora/radak-rabbi-david-kimchi/&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Chumash, only Radak on Breishit survives.
* [[Nachmanides]] 1194–1270
:: Nachmanides (Ramban or Moses ben Nahman) was the first biblical commentator to introduce [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] concepts into his exegesis.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' 2nd ed. vol 14 page 741&lt;/ref&gt; He differed from the [[Zohar]] in that he believed that the transcendent nature of God is absolutely unknowable by man, whereas the school of Zoharists believed that transcendence is comprehensible through revelation, ecstasy, and in the contemplation of history.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' 2nd ed. vol 14 page 745&lt;/ref&gt; Ramban expressed his views through the [[pardes (Jewish exegesis)#Sod|Sod]] aspect of his commentary. He also expressed, in his commentary, his belief that all [[mitzvot]] had a comprehensible and rational explanation.
* [[Jacob ben Asher]] 1270–1340
:: The author of the [[Arba'ah Turim]], a precursor of the [[Shulchan Aruch]] Jacob ben Asher wrote a commentary on the Torah in which he anthologised the ''[[Pshat]]'' element of his predecessors. At the beginning of each section he wrote, as brain teasers, some explanations using ''[[kabbalah#Overview|Remez]]''. These were gathered and printed under the name ''Baal HaTurim''. The Baal HaTurim is printed in all modern editions of ''Mikraot Gedolot''. The full commentary titled ''Perush ha-Tur ha-Arokh al ha-Torah'', was published in Jerusalem in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' 2nd ed. vol. 11 page 31&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gersonides]] 1288–1344
:: Gersonides (The Ralbag or Levi ben Gershon) based his exegesis on three principles:
# What can be learned through the nine principles (he believed that four of them were not allowed to be used in post-talmudic times).
# Every story in the Bible come to teach us ethical, religious, and philosophical ideas.
# Most of what we call Remez can be clearly understood by resorting to exact translation and grammatical analysis. He also condemned allegorical explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein's ''Ozer Yisrael'' vol. 6 page 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hezekiah ben Manoah]] 13th century France
:: The Hizkuni based his kabbalistic commentary primarily on Rashi, but also used up to 20 other sources, including [[Dunash ben Labrat]].
* [[Isaac Abarbanel]] 1437–1508
:: In his commentary on Tanach, before each section, he would list a series of questions exploring the conceptual problems in the section from both exegetical and theological perspectives. His commentary would attempt to answer these questions through Pshat and Medrash. He distinguished between Medrashim that were part of Mesorah and those that were mere opinion and could be safely disregarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawee|first=Eric|author2=[[Avraham Grossman|Grossman, Avraham]]|title=Encyclopaedia Judaica|edition=2nd|volume=1|pages=276–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Me'am Lo'ez]] 1730-1777
* [[Metsudot]] 18th century
:: The [[Metsudot]] (the fortresses) are a commentary on Neviim and Ketuvim written by Rabbi David Altshuler. When he died, his son Yechiel completed it and divided it into two sections: [[Metsudat Zion]], a glossary of difficult words, and [[Metsudat David]], a restatement of difficult ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia'' in the section on Altschul&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Malbim]] 1809–1879
:: The Malbim's (Meir Leibush ben Yehiel Michel Wisser) exegesis is based on several assumptions.
:# There are no extra words or synonyms in the Bible. Every word is meaningful.
:# ''Drush'' is as explicit as ''Pshat'' is, except that ''Drush'' has different rules of usage and syntax.
:# The basis of the whole of the [[Oral law]] is explicit in the Bible, either through ''Pshat'' or ''Drush''. The only exception is when the Oral Law states that the law is not found in the Bible and is designated as ''[[Halacha l'Moshe m'Sinai]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pfeffer|first=Jeremy L.|title=Malbim's ''Job''|publisher=KTAV|location=Jersey City NJ|pages=10–11|chapter=Translator's Introduction|isbn=0-88125-801-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] 1808–1888
:: Hirsch was a German rabbi during the reformation period. His commentary focuses on the grammar and structure of the language of the Tanakh to facilitate understand the laws being given.  His commentary includes the Five Books of Moses and other various parts of the Tanakh.
* [[Torah Temimah]] 1860–1941
:: [[Baruch Epstein]] (Baruch ben Yechiel Michael HaLevi) was a bank worker by profession who devoted all of his extra time to Jewish studies. To write the Torah Temimah, he gathered excerpts from the [[Talmud]] and other sources of the Oral Law and arranged them in the order of the verses of the [[Written Law]] to which they refer. He then wove the excerpts into a commentary on the Bible and annotated each excerpt with critical notes and insights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia Judaica|publisher=Keter|edition=2nd|volume=6|page=468}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nechama Leibowitz]]  1905–1997
:: In the early 1940s professor Leibowitz began mailing study sheets on the weekly Torah reading to her students throughout the world. The study sheets included essays on the weekly portion, source notes, and questions. She encouraged her students to send their answers to her for correction. Soon she was sending out thousands of sheets and correcting hundreds of answer sheets weekly. These study sheets were collected and published in English and Hebrew in the mid 1960s and they are still in print. "Her specific collection of sources was based solely on each one's contribution to understanding ''[[peshat]]'' and to the revelation of the significance of that text."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'', second edition, volume 12, page 621&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th and 21st century ===
* ''Cup of Salvation'', also known as ''Cup of Salvation: A Powerful Journey Through King David's Psalms of Praise'', is a book written by [[Pesach Wolicki]] and published by the [[Center for Jewish–Christian Understanding and Cooperation]] (CJCUC) in 2017. The book is a devotional biblical commentary on [[Psalms]] 113-118 otherwise known as the [[Hallel]].
* The [[Soncino Books of the Bible]] covers the whole Tanakh in fourteen volumes, published by the [[Soncino Press]]. The first volume to appear was Psalms in 1945, and the last was Chronicles in 1952. The editor was Rabbi Abraham Cohen. Each volume contains the Hebrew and English texts of the Hebrew Bible in parallel columns, with a running commentary below them.
* [[Judaica Press]] is an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] publishing house. They have published a set of 24 bilingual Hebrew-English volumes of ''[[Mikraot Gedolot]]'' for Nevi'im and Ketuvim, published as Books of the Prophets and Writings. As in traditional Mikraot Gedolot, the Hebrew text includes the [[Masoretic text]], the [[Aramaic]] [[Targum]], and several classic rabbinic commentaries. The English translations, by [[Avroham Yoseif Rosenberg]] (also: Abraham Joseph Rosenberg),&lt;ref name=JPR-Rosenberg&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|first=Avroham Yoseif|title=The Complete Jewish Bible, With Rashi Commentary|url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=olbp51235|work=The Complete Tanach With Rashi|publisher=Judaica Press|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; include a translation of the Biblical text, [[Rashi]]'s commentary, and a summary of rabbinic and modern commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.judaicapress.com/product_info.php?ref=1330&amp;products_id=47 Judaica Press Prophets &amp; Writings] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211071116/http://www.judaicapress.com/product_info.php?ref=1330&amp;products_id=47 |date=December 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is available online as Javascript-dependent HTML document with Rashi's commentary at chabad.org – [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/63255/jewish/The-Bible-with-Rashi.htm The Complete Jewish Bible with Rashi Commentary (in Hebrew and English)].&lt;ref name=JPR-online&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|first=Avroham Yoseif|title=The Complete Jewish Bible, With Rashi Commentary (in Hebrew and English)|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/63255/jewish/The-Bible-with-Rashi.htm|work=Classic Texts|publisher=Judaica Press &amp; Chabad.org|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Living Torah]]'', by [[Aryeh Kaplan]], his best-known work, is a widely used, scholarly (and user friendly) translation into English of the Torah. It is noteworthy for its detailed index, thorough cross-references, extensive footnotes with maps and diagrams, and research on [[Realia (translation)|realia]], [[flora]], [[fauna]], and [[geography]]. The footnotes also indicate differences in interpretation between the [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible#Commentaries|classic commentators]]. It was one of the first translations structured around the ''[[Parashah#Parashot in the Torah|parshiyot]]'', the traditional division of the Torah text. ''The Living Torah'' was later supplemented by ''[[The Living Torah and Nach#The Living Nach|The Living Nach]]'' on [[Nevi'im]] (two volumes: "The Early Prophets" and "The Latter Prophets") and [[Ketuvim]] ("Sacred Writings" in one volume). These were prepared posthumously following Rabbi Kaplan's format by others including Yaakov Elman.
* [[Mesorah Publications, Ltd.]] is a [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Orthodox Jewish]] publishing company based in Brooklyn, New York. Its general editors are Rabbis [[Nosson Scherman]] and [[Meir Zlotowitz]]. They publish the [[Artscroll]] prayerbooks and Bible commentaries. In 1993 they published ''The Chumash: The Stone Edition'', a Torah translation and commentary arranged for liturgical use. It is popularly known as ''The ArtScroll Chumash'', and has since became the best-selling English-Hebrew Torah translation and commentary in the U.S. and other English-speaking countries. They have issued a series of Tanakh commentaries on the rest of the Tanakh. Their translations have been criticized by a few Modern Orthodox scholars, e.g. B. Barry Levy, and by some non-Orthodox scholars, as mistranslating the Bible. The dispute comes about because the editors at Mesorah Publications consciously attempt to present a translation of the text based on rabbinic tradition and medieval biblical commentators such as Rashi, as opposed to a literal translation.
* [[Koren Publishers Jerusalem]] is a Jerusalem-based publishing company founded in 1961. It publishes various editions of The Koren Tanakh, originally created by master typographer and company founder [[Eliyahu Koren]]. The Koren Tanakh is the official Tanakh accepted by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel for synagogue [[Haftarah]] reading, and the Bible upon which Israel's President is sworn into office. Koren offers a Hebrew/English edition with translation by biblical and literary scholar, Harold Fisch, and is currently at work on a Hebrew/English edition with translation and commentary by Rabbi [[Jonathan Sacks]].
* [[Da'at Miqra]] is a series of Hebrew-language biblical commentaries, published by the Jerusalem-based Rav Kook Institute. Its editors included the late Prof. Yehuda Elitzur of Bar-Ilan University, Bible scholar [[Amos Hakham]], Sha’ul Yisra’eli, [[Mordechai Breuer]] and [[Yehuda Kiel]]. The commentary combines a traditional rabbinic outlook with the findings of modern research. The editors have sought to present an interpretation based primarily upon Peshat — the direct, literal reading of the text — as opposed to Drash. They do so by incorporating geographic references, archaeological findings and textual analysis.
* ''[[Da'as Sofrim on Tanach]]'' is a 20 volume work by [[Chaim Dov Rabinowitz]] encompassing the whole of the Tanakh.  Based on the Rishonim, he spent more than 60 years compiling this massive commentary which is used for study by many talmidei chachamim and educators throughout the world.
* ''[[Kol Menachem#The Gutnick Edition Chumash|The Gutnick Edition Chumash]]'', by Rabbi Chaim Miller, is a translation that incorporates Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]]'s – the Rebbe's - "novel interpretation" of [[Rashi]]'s commentary. This "Toras Menachem" commentary is culled from the Rebbe's lectures and notes on classical and [[Hassidic]] interpretations. It also includes mystical insights called "Sparks of ''Chassidus''", a summary of the ''[[Mitzvah|mitzvot]]'' found in each ''[[Parashah]]'' according to ''[[Sefer ha-Chinuch]]''. It is unique in its presentation of "Classic Questions" - the questions underlying more than one hundred Torah commentaries.
* A second [[Lubavitch]] Chumash, [[Kehot Publication Society]]'s ''Torah Chumash'' (the "[http://www.lachumash.org/ LA Chumash]") offers an Interpolated English translation and commentary - "woven" together – again based on Rashi, and the works of the Rebbe.  The Chumash also includes a fully vocalized Hebrew text of Rashi`s commentary. The Editor-in-Chief is Rabbi [[Moshe Wisnefsky]] with contributing editors: Rabbis Baruch Kaplan, Betzalel Lifshitz, Yosef Marcus and Dov Wagner. Additional Features include "Chasidic Insights" and "Inner Dimensions", Chronological charts, topic titles, illustrations, diagrams and maps. Each sidra is prefaced by an overview, a study of the name of each sidra and its relevance to the respective text.
* A modern Orthodox [[Yeshiva]] in New York, [[Yeshivat Chovevei Torah]], recently started a new Bible series, ''Yeshivat Chovevei Torah Tanakh Companion''. The first volume out is ''Yeshivat Chovevei Torah Tanakh Companion to The Book of Samuel: Bible Study in the Spirit of Open and Modern Orthodoxy'', edited by [[Nathaniel Helfgot]] and [[Shmuel Herzfeld]].
* ''JPS Tanakh Commentary''. The [[Jewish Publication Society]], known in the Jewish community as ''JPS'', has initiated a long-term, large-scale project to complete a modern Jewish commentary on the entire Hebrew Bible. Unlike the Judaica Press and Soncino commentaries, the JPS commentaries are producing a detailed line-by-line commentary of every passage, in every book of the Bible. The amount of the JPS commentaries are almost an order of magnitude larger than those found in the earlier Orthodox English works. They currently have produced volumes on all five books of the Torah, the Haftarot, and the books of Jonah, Esther, Ecclesiastes, Ruth, and Song of Songs. Although not a book of the Bible, JPS has also issued a commentary volume on the Haggadah. The next volumes planned are Lamentations, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, &amp; Psalms (5 volumes).
* A major Bible commentary now in use by [[Conservative Judaism]] is [[Etz Hayim Humash|Etz Hayim: Torah and Commentary]], Its production involved the collaboration of the [[Rabbinical Assembly]], the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, and the Jewish Publication Society. The Hebrew and English bible text is the New JPS version. It contains a number of commentaries, written in English, on the Torah which run alongside the Hebrew text and its English translation, and it also contains a number of essays on the Torah and Tanakh in the back of the book. It contains three types of commentary: (1) the p'shat, which discusses the literal meaning of the text; this has been adapted from the first five volumes of the ''JPS Bible Commentary''; (2) the d'rash, which draws on Talmudic, Medieval, Chassidic, and Modern Jewish sources to expound on the deeper meaning of the text; and (3) the halacha l'maaseh – which explains how the text relates to current Jewish law.
* [[Leonard S. Kravitz]] and [[Kerry Olitzky]] have authored a series of Tanakh commentaries. Their commentaries draw on classical Jewish works such as the [[Mishnah]], [[Talmud]], [[Targum]]s, the [[midrash]] literature, and also the classical Jewish bible commentators such as [[Gersonides]], [[Rashi]] and [[Abraham ibn Ezra]]. They take into account modern scholarship; while these books take note of some findings of [[Higher criticism|higher textual criticism]], these are not academic books using source criticism to deconstruct the Tanakh. Rather, their purpose is educational, and Jewishly inspirational, and as such do not follow the path of classical Reform scholars, or the more secular projects such as the Anchor Bible series. The books also add a layer of commentary by modern-day rabbis. These books are published by the [[Union for Reform Judaism]]. Commentaries in this series now include Jonah, Lamentations, Ruth, the Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, and Proverbs.
* ''The Jewish Study Bible'', from [[Oxford University Press]], edited by [[Adele Berlin]] and [[Marc Zvi Brettler]]. The English bible text is the New JPS version. A new English commentary has been written for the entire Hebrew Bible drawing on both traditional rabbinic sources, and the findings of modern-day higher textual criticism.
* There is much overlap between non-Orthodox Jewish Bible commentary, and the non-sectarian and inter-religious Bible commentary found in the [[Anchor Bible Series]]. Originally published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], and now by [[Yale University Press]], this series began in 1956. Having initiated a new era of cooperation among scholars in biblical research, over 1,000 scholars—representing Jewish, Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, secular, and other traditions—have now contributed to the project.
* ''The Torah: A Women's Commentary'', Edited by [[Tamara Cohn Eskenazi]] and Andrea Weiss. [[Union for Reform Judaism|URJ]] Press (December 10, 2007).  This volume "gives dimension to the women's voices in our tradition. Under Editor Dr. Tamara Cohn Eskenazi's skillful leadership, this commentary provides insight and inspiration for all who study Torah: men and women, Jew and non-Jew. As Dr. Eskenazi has eloquently stated, 'we want to bring the women of the Torah from the shadow into the limelight, from their silences into speech, from the margins to which they have often been relegated to the center of the page – for their sake, for our sake and for our children's sake.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urjbooksandmusic.com/product.php?productid=1986|title=URJ Books And Music :: Sacred Texts :: Torah: A Women's Commentary, The|publisher=|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Women's Torah Commentary: New Insights from Women Rabbis on the 54 Weekly Torah Portions'' Edited by Rabbi Elyse Goldstein, Jewish Lights Publishing (September 2008).  From the Jewish Lights website: "In this groundbreaking book, more than 50 women rabbis come together to offer us inspiring insights on the Torah, in a week-by-week format. Included are commentaries by the first women ever ordained in the Reform, Reconstructionist and Conservative movements, and by many other women across these denominations who serve in the rabbinate in a variety of ways." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishlights.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=JL&amp;Product_Code=978-1-58023-370-5 |title=The Women's Torah Commentary: New Insights from Women Rabbis on the 54 Weekly Torah Portions |publisher=Jewishlights.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13274">A '''KWL table''', or '''KWL chart''', is a [[Graphic organizers|graphical organizer]] designed to help in [[learning]]. The letters KWL are an [[acronym]], for what students, in the course of a lesson, already '''k'''now, '''w'''ant to know, and ultimately '''l'''earn. It is a part of the [[Constructivist methods|constructivist teaching method]] where students move away from what are considered traditional methods of teaching and learning. In this particular methodology the students are given the space to learn by constructing their own learning pace and their own style of understanding a given topic or idea. The KWL chart or table was developed within this methodology and is a form of instructional reading strategy that is used to guide students taking them through the idea and the text.&lt;ref name="nea.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.org/tools/k-w-l-know-want-to-know-learned.html|title=NEA - K-W-L (Know, Want to Know, Learned)|work=NEA|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A KWL table is typically divided into three columns titled [[declarative knowledge|Know]], Want and Learned. The table comes in various forms as some have modified it to include or exclude information.

It may be useful in research projects and to organize information to help study for tests.

==Classroom introduction==
The KWL chart was created by Donna Ogle in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Ogle, D.M. (1986). K-W-L: A teaching model that develops active reading of expository text. ''Reading Teacher'', 39, 564–570&lt;/ref&gt; A KWL chart can be used for all subjects in a whole group or small group atmosphere. The chart is a comprehension strategy used to activate background knowledge prior to reading and is completely student centered.  The teacher divides a piece of chart paper into three columns.  The first column, 'K', is for what the students already know about a topic.  This step is to be completed before the reading.  The next column, 'W', is for students to list what they want to learn about the topic during the reading.  This step is also to be completed before the reading.  The third column, 'L', is for what the students learned from the reading.  This step, of course, is done after finishing the reading. The KWL chart can also be used in reading instruction at the beginning of a new unit.

Here is what the KWL chart can look like: 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! K 
What I ''know''
! W 
What I ''want'' to know
! L 
What I ''learned
|-
| Write the information about what the students know in this space. 
| Write the information about what the students want to know in this space. 
| After the completion of the lesson or unit, write the information that the students learned in this space. 
|-
|}

=== Things to keep in mind ===

Materials required can vary on the type of classroom activity the teacher intends to carry. For a classroom activity if the teacher divides the class for a particular topic then 1 paper with KWL chart per group shall be given. But if the teacher wants every individual child to brainstorm on the given topic then every individual shall have their own student paper copy.&lt;ref name="msu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://msu.edu/course/cep/886/Reading%20Comprehension/7Learn_Serv_Proj_KWL.html|title=K-W-L STRATEGY|publisher=|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 'K' column, the teacher has to make sure that she or he has all the questions ready for the students to brainstorm on the particular idea that needs to be taken care in that class. The questions help the students to be prompted to think in specific directions that will lead them to the first step of brainstorming. Also ask the students the reason of their answers. By this the teacher makes them aware of their associations to the answers. The questions like "what made you think like that?" shall guide them well.
In the 'W' column, ask associating questions or liking questions to make them come to the thinking. questions like, "what would you like to learn more about this idea?" can help them to analyze and think more. The teacher here has to come prepared with her/his own set of questions that will link the students' questions to the idea in the text. This is done so that the student shall not lose the flow of the text as well as not lose the purpose of the activity.
In the last column 'L', help the students to come out with their own creative ideas and analysis. Also in this particular column, the teacher shall ask the students to differentiate between the answers to their questions and ideas in other columns and the idea they found interesting. At last, the teacher shall help the students to consult other sources which would answer their questions which are not mentioned in the text.&lt;ref name="nea.org"/&gt;

A KWL chart can be used to drive instruction in the classroom. The teacher can create lesson plans based upon the interests and inquiries of the students and their needs. Using this strategy can increase motivation and attention by activating the students' prior knowledge. This allows the teacher to understand the students' prior knowledge and the students' interests in the topic.

==Purpose==
A teacher has many reasons for using KWL charts in the classroom. First, a KWL chart activates students' prior knowledge of the text or topic to be studied. By asking students what they already know, students are thinking about prior experiences or knowledge about the topic. Next, KWL charts set a purpose for the unit. Students are able to add their input to the topic by asking them what they want to know. Students then have a purpose for participating and engaging in the topic. Also, using a KWL chart allows students to expand their ideas beyond the text used in the classroom. By being aware of students' interests, the teacher has the ability to create projects and assignments that the students will enjoy. A KWL chart is a tool that can be used to drive instruction as well as guide student learning.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;KWL table/ chart. (2009). Retrieved October 26, 2012, from http://www.study-habits.com/kwl-table-chart&lt;/ref&gt; 
KWL charts are used by elementary teachers from literature to science. They are also used to teach historical content at the elementary level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teachinghistory.org/teaching-materials/teaching-guides/21806|title=Applying KWL Guides to Sources with Elementary Students|publisher=|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Study tool ===
A KWL chart can be used as a study tool for an individual, group or entire class.  It is a way to synthesize information into a visual aid.  The students are also able to keep track of what they have done and what they still would like, or need to do.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Required materials ===
Materials required can vary on the type of classroom activity the teacher intends to carry. For a classroom activity if the teacher divides the class for a particular topic then one paper with KWL chart per group shall be given. But if the teacher wants every individual child to brainstorm on the given topic then every individual shall have their own student paper copy.&lt;ref name="msu.edu"/&gt;

=== Specific learners ===
KWL charts can be used with all students, however there are specific groups of students that lend themselves quite well to this strategy, including visual learners, young learners or [[ESL]] learners.  As the chart is a [[graphic organizer]] it can aid visual learners.  The information is presented in a user friendly way that is visually accessible.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;McDermott, M. J. (2012). Using graphic organizers in preschool. Teaching Young Children, 5(5), 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the visual nature of the KWL chart it can also be beneficial for young learners such as preschoolers.  Words may not be necessary and pictures can be used in order to express the ideas within the chart.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  As pictures can be used alone or in conjunction with words the KWL chart may provide assistance for students that are learning a second language.

== Adaptations ==
There are various adaptations of KWL charts that can be used within the classroom.

=== Hill ===
One adaptation as created by Hill&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Instructional strategies online. (2009). Retrieved October 26, 2012, from http://olc.spsd.sk.ca/DE/PD/instr/strats/kwl/&lt;/ref&gt; is an extension of the traditional KWL chart to include a column for "Further Wanderings" at the end of the table.  This allows for the students' knowledge to continue beyond what they have learned within the classroom. The idea behind this extra column is to encourage the students to continue to learn.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

=== KLEW ===
Another adaptation of the KWL chart is the KLEW chart.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Hershberger, K., Zembal-Saul, C., &amp; Starr, M. L. (2006). Evidence helps the KWL get a KLEW. Science &amp; Children, 43(5), 50–53.&lt;/ref&gt;  The KLEW chart was developed by a group of people with various backgrounds including an elementary school teacher, a professor and a professional development specialist.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Within this chart, the "K" stands for what students know of a topic, the "L" for what is being learned, the "E" for evidence that supports the learning previously described, and the "W" for wondering, which leaves room for further questions.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; This table differs from the traditional KWL chart as it places an emphasis on observation and examination of evidence that supports what they see.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

=== Mooney ===
Margaret Mooney suggested a variation to the KWL chart by adding a fifth column to the traditional chart. This column would be located between the "W" and the "L". Its purpose is to answer the question "How".&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; This encourages the students to develop their own means of how they will discover more information. This can be quite useful in the sciences for experimentation purposes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

== Assessment and evaluation ==
The KWL chart is useful to complete [[formative assessment]] in the classroom.  It allows the teacher to find out the students prior knowledge on a particular topic.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Struble, J. (2007). Using graphic organizers as formative assessment. Science Scope, 30(5), 69-71.&lt;/ref&gt;  From this knowledge the teacher is then able to gear their lessons based upon this information. The KWL chart can be completed when starting a new topic and be added to throughout the unit.  Further, the teacher is able to find out what the students have learned by the end of their lessons.

KWL charts work well in order to examine the individual student or the entire class in order to understand their thinking and learning.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

=== Advantages ===
According to Jared and Jared (1997), KWL was established with the motive to enhance the comprehensive reading skills of the students. This was done by designing the three levels of the activity focusing on the different learning styles of the individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Jared, J. Elizabeth, Jared, H. Alva (1997). Launching into improved comprehension. ''The Technology Teacher'', 56(6), 24–31.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Glazer(1998), students fail to enjoy the text or content because they fail to understand it. Hence, KWL increases their comprehension skills as the activity goes through each topic step by step.&lt;ref&gt;Glazer, M. Susan. (1998). Using kwl folders. Teaching Diverse Learners, 29(4), 106-107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan. (1998). Using kwl folders. Teaching Diverse Learners, 29(4), 106-107&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to Szabo(2006), a KWL table uses a strategy of before-during-after for the students to enhance their comprehension skills. The students start by brainstorming the prior knowledge about the topic and then eventually develop curiosity about the topic. This builds their interest in the topic and they would want to learn more about the topic. KWL chart gives an opportunity to the individual to build up self-motivation regarding the topic. Through KWL table, the students go through self-evaluation as they know what they intend to learn and what they really understood. Hence, KWL gives the students some space to explore the topic through other sources and build up their knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Szabo, Susan. (2006). Kwhhl: A student-driven evolution of the kwl. ''American Secondary Education'', 34(3), 57–67&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26664">'''Mesoamerican architecture''' is the set of [[architecture|architectural]] traditions produced by [[pre-Columbian]] cultures and civilizations of [[Mesoamerica]], traditions which are best known in the form of public, ceremonial and urban monumental buildings and structures. The distinctive features of Mesoamerican architecture encompass a number of different regional and historical styles, which however are significantly interrelated. These styles developed throughout the different phases of [[Mesoamerican chronology|Mesoamerican history]] as a result of the intensive cultural exchange between the different cultures of the Mesoamerican culture area through thousands of years. Mesoamerican architecture is mostly noted for its [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramids]] which are the largest such structures (outside of [[Ancient Egypt]] and the [[Chola Empire]]).

One interesting and widely researched topic is the relation between [[Cosmology|cosmovision]], [[religion]], [[geography]], and [[architecture]] in Mesoamerica. Much seems to suggest that many traits of Mesoamerican architecture were governed by religious and mythological ideas. For example, the layout of most Mesoamerican cities seem to be influenced by the [[cardinal directions]] and their [[Mythology|mythological]] and [[symbol]]ic meanings in Mesoamerican culture.

Another part of Mesoamerican architecture is its [[iconography]]. The monumental architecture of Mesoamerica was decorated with images of religious and cultural significance, and also in many cases with writing in some of the [[Mesoamerican writing systems]]. Iconographic decorations and texts on buildings are important contributors to the overall current knowledge of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican society, history and religion.

==Urban planning and cosmovision==

===Cosmos and its replication===

====Symbolism====
[[Image:Teotihuacancityplan.png|300px|left|thumb|The layout of the city of Teotihuacan. The central part of the city is laid out following a north/south axis aligned about 15.5 degrees off, and which is marked by the "Street of the dead" The pyramid of the sun is in the center, built on an artificial cave. The southern part is skewed about 16.5 degrees east of north, following the orientation of the Ciudadela, mostly surrounded by residential quarters, while the northern part is the ceremonial center used for among other things human sacrifice.]]
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Proskouriakoff Structure I at Xpuhil.jpg|thumb|Model of structure I of the Maya site of [[Xpuhil]].]] --&gt;
An important part of the [[Mesoamerican religion|Mesoamerican religious]] system was replicating their beliefs in concrete tangible forms, in effect making the world an embodiment of their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Miller and Karl Taube, introduction to "The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya" p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that the Mesoamerican city was constructed to be a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], manifesting the same division that existed in the religious, mythical geography—a division between the underworld and the human world. The underworld was represented by the direction north and many structures and buildings related to the underworld, such as tombs, are often found in the city's northern half. The southern part represented life, sustenance and rebirth and often contained structures related to the continuity and daily function of the city state, such as monuments depicting the noble lineages, or residential quarters, markets etc. Between the two halves of the north/south axis was the plaza, often containing stelae resembling the [[world tree]] the Mesoamerican [[axis mundi]], and a [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]] which served as a crossing point between the two worlds. 

Some Mesoamericanists argue that in religious symbolism the Mesoamerican monumental architecture pyramids were mountains, stelae were trees, and wells, ballcourts and [[cenote|cenotes]] were caves that provided access to the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Miller and Karl Taube write about this in their introduction to "The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya" pp. 31, they attribute this interpretation to Epigrapher David Stuart. American archeologist James E. Brady have done extensive research on importance of Caves in Mesoamerican culture. The title of the famous book "Forest of Kings" by Mayanist [[Linda Schele]] also alludes to the Maya belief that stelae represent trees, especially the world tree, axis mundi of the mayan cosmos.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orientation====
Mesoamerican architecture is often designed to align to specific celestial events. Some pyramids, temples, and other structures were designed to achieve special lighting effects on particular days important in the Mesoamerican cosmovision. A famous example is the "[[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|El Castillo]]" pyramid at [[Chichen Itza]], where a light-and-shadow effect can be observed during several weeks around the equinoxes. Contrary to a common opinion, however, there is no evidence that this phenomenon was the result of a purposeful design intended to commemorate the equinoxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |title=El Sol en Chichén Itzá y Dzibilchaltún: la supuesta importancia de los equinoccios en Mesoamérica |journal=Arqueología Mexicana |date=2018 |volume=25 |issue=149 |pages=26–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Much Mesoamerican architecture is also aligned to roughly 15° east of north.&lt;ref&gt;Aveni and Gibbs.  Other researchers give other estimates or averages, but there is a remarkable consistency across time and space to this general orientation.&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent H Malmstrom has argued&lt;ref&gt;In Chapter 22 of Archaeoastronomy in the Americas, edited by Ray A. Williamson, Ballena Press/Center for Archaeoastronomy, 1981, pp. 249–61, which can also be found at [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~izapa/M-15.pdf his website]. See also [http://www.jqjacobs.net/mesoamerica/meso_astro.html John Q Jacobs] article for more information on the alignments of Mesoamerican Cities&lt;/ref&gt; that this is because of a general wish to align the pyramids to face the sunset on August 13, which was the beginning date of the Maya [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar|Long Count]] calendar. However, recent research has shown that the earliest orientations marking sunsets on August 13 (and April 30) occur outside of the Maya area. Their purpose must have been to record the dates separated by a period of 260 days (from August 13 to April 30), equivalent to the length of the sacred Mesoamerican calendrical count. In general, the orientations in Mesoamerican architecture tend to mark the dates separated by multiples of 13 and 20 days, i.e. of basic periods of the calendrical system. The distribution of these dates in the year suggests that the orientations allowed the use of observational calendars that facilitated the prediction of agriculturally significant dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aveni |first1=Anthony F. |title=Skywatchers: A Revised and Updated Version of Skywatchers of Ancient Mexico |date=2001 |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |isbn=978-0-292-70504-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |title=Astronomy, Architecture, and Landscape in Prehispanic Mesoamerica |journal=Journal of Archaeological Research |date=2018 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=197–251 |doi=10.1007/s10814-017-9109-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; These conclusions are supported by the results of systematic research accomplished in various Mesoamerican regions, including central Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |title=Orientaciones astronómicas en la arquitectura prehispánica del centro de México |date=2001 |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia |location=Mexico City |isbn=978-970-18-4180-8 |url=https://iaps.zrc-sazu.si/sites/default/files/Sprajc_OrientacionesCentroMexico.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Maya Lowlands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aveni |first1=A. |last2=Hartung |first2=H. |title=Maya City Planning and the Calendar |date=1986 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sánchez Nava |first1=Pedro Francisco |last2=Šprajc |first2=Ivan |title=Orientaciones astronómicas en la arquitectura maya de las tierras bajas |date=2015 |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia |location=Mexico City |isbn=978-607-484-727-7 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/297155454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oaxaca, the Gulf Coast lowlands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |title=Orientaciones astronómicas en la arquitectura de Mesoamérica: Oaxaca y el Golfo de México |date=2015 |publisher=Založba ZRC |location=Ljubljana |isbn=978-961-254-816-2 |url=http://iaps.zrc-sazu.si/sites/default/files/pkc08_sprajc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and western and northern Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |last2=Sánchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |last3=Cañas Ortiz |first3=Alejandro |title=Orientaciones astronómicas en la arquitectura de Mesoamérica: Occidente y Norte |date=2016 |publisher=Založba ZRC |location=Ljubljana |isbn=978-961-254-892-6 |url=https://iaps.zrc-sazu.si/sites/default/files/sprajc_orientaciones-astronomicas-en-la-arquitectura.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; While solar orientations prevail, some prominent buildings were aligned to Venus extremes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |title=The Venus-Rain-Maize Complex in the Mesoamerican World View: Part I |journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy |date=1993 |volume=24 |pages=17–70 |url=https://iaps.zrc-sazu.si/sites/default/files/Sprajc_Venus-rain-maize_part1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; a notable example being the Governor's Palace at Uxmal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Šprajc |first1=Ivan |editor1-last=Ruggles |editor1-first=Clive L.

===The Plaza===
At the heart of the Mesoamerican city were large plazas surrounded by the most important governmental and religious buildings, such as the royal [[acropolis]], great pyramid temples and occasionally [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballcourts]].

===The Main Pyramids===
Often the most important religious temples sat atop the towering pyramids, presumably as the closest place to the heavens.  While recent discoveries point toward the extensive use of pyramids as tombs, the temples themselves seem to rarely, if ever, contain burials.  Residing atop the pyramids, some of over two-hundred feet, such as that at [[El Mirador]], the temples were impressive and decorated structures themselves.  Commonly topped with a [[roof comb]], or superficial grandiose wall, these temples might have served as a type of propaganda.

===The Ball court===
[[File:MesoBallcourtTeotenango.JPG|thumb|left|Mesoamerican ball court at Teotenango]]
[[File:Pok ta pok ballgame maya indians mexico 3.JPG|thumb|Replica Mesoamerican ball court.]]
[[File:Mesoamerican Ballcourt terminology schema.svg|thumb|left|Layout chart of a typical Mesoamerican ball court.]]

{{main|Mesoamerican ball court}}
The [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] ritual was a symbolic journey between the underworld and the world of the living, and many ball courts are found in the mid-part of the city functioning as a connection between the northern and southern halves of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Muriel Porter Weaver describes this on pp. 226–28 of the third edition of "The Aztecs, Maya and their Predecessors".&lt;/ref&gt;  All but the earliest ball courts are masonry structures.  Over 1300 ball courts have been identified, and although there is a tremendous variation in size, they all have the same general shape: a long narrow alley flanked by two walls with horizontal, sloping, and sometimes vertical faces. The later vertical faces, such as those at Chichen Itza and [[El Tajin]], are often covered with complex iconography and scenes of human sacrifice (see photo [[:Image:El Tajin Ballcourt Mural (Tom Aleto).jpg|here]]).

Although the alleys in early ball courts were open-ended, later ball courts had enclosed end-zones, giving the structure an [[Image:I, heavily serifed.png|7px]]-shape when viewed from above.  The playing alley may be at ground level, or the ball court may be "sunken".

Ball courts were no mean feats of engineering.  One of the [[sandstone]] stones on El Tajin's South Ball court is 11 m long and weighs more than 10 [[Tonne|tons]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilkerson, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residential Quarters and Palaces===
[[File:Uxmal - Quadrangulo de las Monjas - Nördlicher Palast 2.jpg|thumb|left|Limestone carvings on the ruined Uxmal palace.]]
Large and often highly decorated, the palaces usually sat close to the center of a city and housed the population's elite.  Any exceedingly large royal palace, or one consisting of many chambers on different levels might be referred to as an acropolis.  However, often these were one-story and consisted of many small chambers and typically at least one interior courtyard; these structures appear to take into account the needed functionality required of a residence, as well as the decoration required for their inhabitants stature.  Archaeologists seem to agree that many palaces are home to various tombs.  At [[Copán]], beneath over four-hundred years of later remodeling, a tomb for one of the ancient rulers has been discovered and the [[North Acropolis, Tikal|North Acropolis]] at [[Tikal]] appears to have been the site of numerous burials during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Terminal Pre-classic]] and [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Classic]] periods.

===Building materials===
[[File:Facade of the Temple of the Feathered Serpent (Teotihuacán).jpg|thumb|Teotihuacan style architecture displaying decorative ornamentation made of obsidian and shell inlaid into a painted [[Cantera (stone)|cantera]] surface set upon a [[tezontle]] interior.]]
The most  surprising aspect of the great Mesoamerican structures is their lack of many advanced technologies that would seem to be necessary for such constructions. Lacking metal tools, Mesoamerican architecture required one thing in abundance: manpower.  Yet, beyond this enormous requirement, the remaining materials seem to have been readily available. They most often utilized [[limestone]], which remained pliable enough to be worked with stone tools while being quarried, and only hardened once when removed from its bed.  In addition to the structural use of limestone, much of their mortar consisted of crushed, burnt, and mixed limestone that mimicked the properties of cement and was used just as widely for [[stucco]] finishing as it was for mortar. However, later improvements in quarrying techniques reduced the necessity for this limestone-stucco as their stones began to fit quite perfectly, yet it remained a crucial element in some [[post and lintel]] roofs. A common building material in central Mexico was [[tezontle]] (a light, volcanic rock). It was common for palaces and monumental structures to be made of this rough stone and then covered with stucco or with a [[Cantera (stone)|cantera]] [[Stone veneer|veneer]]. Very large and ornate architectural ornaments were fashioned from a very enduring stucco (kalk), especially in the Mayan region, where a type of hydraulic limestone cement or concrete was also used.&lt;ref&gt;James A O'Kon, The Lost Secrets of Maya Technology Pompton Plaines: Career Press 2012, pp. 114–23&lt;/ref&gt;In the case of the common houses, wooden framing, [[adobe]], and thatch were used to build homes over stone foundations. However, instances of what appear to be common houses of limestone have been discovered as well. Buildings were typically finished with high slanted roofs usually built of wood or thatch although stone roofs in these high slant fashions are also used rarely.

==Styles==

===Megalithic===
[[Image:Taludtablero.png|right|thumb|150px|The talud-tablero style used in many Mesoamerican pyramids and a prominent stylistic feature of Teotihuacano architecture]]
An architectural construction technique that employs large dry-laid limestone blocks (ca. 1 m x 50&amp;nbsp;cm x 30&amp;nbsp;cm) covered with a thick layer of [[stucco]].  This style was common in the northern Maya lowlands from the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic]] until the early parts of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Classic]].

===Talud-tablero===
{{Main|Talud-tablero}}
Pyramids in Mesoamerican were platformed pyramids and many used a style called ''talud-tablero'', which first became common in Teotihuacan. This style consists of a platform structure, or the "tablero," on top of a sloped "talud". Many different variants on the talud-tablero style arose throughout Mesoamerica, developing and manifesting itself differently among the various cultures.

===Classic Period Maya styles===

===Puuc===
{{Main|Puuc}}
So named after the Puuc hills in which this style developed and flourished during the latter portion of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic]] and throughout the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Terminal Classic]] in the northern Maya lowlands, [[Puuc|Puuc architecture]] consists of veneer facing stones applied to a concrete core.  Two [[façade]]s were typically built, partitioned by a ridge of stone.  The blank lower façade is formed by flat cut stones and punctuated by doorways.  The upper partition is richly decorated with repeating geometric patterns and iconographic elements, especially the distinctive curved-nosed [[Chaac]] masks.  Carved columnettes are also common.

[[Image:Corbelledarch.png|thumb|left|100px|the principle of the "false" or corbelled arch is to build it without a keystone, but just with overlapping tiers of blocks]][[Image:Arco maya.jpg|right|thumb|100px|A fine example of a [[Corbel arch|corbelled arch]] from the mayan site of [[Uxmal]], [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]]]]

===Corbelled Arch===
Mesoamerican cultures never invented the [[keystone (architecture)|keystone]], and so were unable to build true [[arch]]es, but instead all of their architecture made use of the "false" or [[Corbel arch|Corbelled arch]]. These arches are built without centering and can be built without support, by corbelling regularly the horizontal courses of the wall masonry. This type of arch supports much less weight than a true arch. 

However, recent work by engineer James O'Kon suggests the Mesoamerican "arch" is technically not a corbelled arch at all but a trapezium truss system. Moreover, unlike a corbelled arch, it does not rely on overlapping layers of blocks but cast-in-place concrete often supported by timber thrust beams. Computer analysis reveals this to be structurally superior to a curved arch&lt;ref&gt;James A O'Kon, The Secrets of Maya Technology, Pompton PLains: New Page, 2012, pp. 149–50&lt;/ref&gt; {{dubious|James O'Kon and arch 'superiority'|date=June 2015}}

=== True Arch ===
Scholars such as David Eccott and Gordon Ekholm argue that true arches were known in pre-Columbian times in Mesoamerica; they point to various examples of true arches at a Maya site in La Muneca, the facade of Temple A at Nukum, two low domes at Tajin in Veracruz, a sweat bath at Chichen Itza, and an arch at Oztuma &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwerin|first=Karl|title=The Arch in Mesoamerica|url=https://www.academia.edu/16405208|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nC5ACwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT273&amp;lpg=PT273&amp;dq=mesoamerica+true+arch#v=onepage&amp;q=mesoamerica%20true%20arch&amp;f=false|title=The Land of Prehistory: A Critical History of American Archaeology|last=Kehoe|first=Alice Beck|date=2015-12-22|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134720651|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.migration-diffusion.info/pdfdownload.php?id=72&amp;file=1|title=THE TRUE ARCH: AN ABSENT TRAIT IN PRECOLUMBIAN AMERICA?|last=Eccot|first=David J.|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Messier 15''' or '''M15''' (also designated '''NGC 7078''') is a [[globular cluster]] in the [[constellation]] [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]]. It was discovered by [[Jean-Dominique Maraldi]] in 1746 and included in [[Charles Messier]]'s catalogue of [[comet]]-like objects in 1764.  At an estimated 12.0 billion years old, it is one of the oldest known globular clusters.

==Characteristics==
M15 is about 33,600 [[light-year]]s from [[Earth]], and 175 light years in diameter.&lt;ref name="astropix" /&gt; It has an [[absolute magnitude]] of -9.2, which translates to a total [[luminosity]] of 360,000 times that of the [[Sun]]. Messier 15 is one of the most densely packed globulars known in the [[Milky Way galaxy]]. Its core has undergone a contraction known as '[[Core collapse (cluster)|core collapse]]' and it has a central density cusp with an enormous number of stars surrounding what may be a central black hole.&lt;ref name="Gerssen2002"&gt;

Home to over 100,000 stars,&lt;ref name="astropix"&gt;http://www.astropix.com/HTML/SHOW_DIG/M15_Pease1.HTM&lt;/ref&gt; the cluster is notable for containing a large number of [[variable star]]s (112) and [[pulsar]]s (8), including one double [[neutron star]] system, M15 C. M15 also contains [[Pease 1]], the first [[planetary nebula]] discovered within a globular cluster&lt;ref name="Gillettetal1989"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1928. Just three others have been found in globular clusters since then.&lt;ref&gt;http://messier.seds.org/more/m015_h2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amateur astronomy==
At magnitude 6.2, M15 approaches [[naked eye]] visibility under good conditions and can be observed with binoculars or a small telescope, appearing as a fuzzy star.&lt;ref name="astropix" /&gt; Telescopes with a larger aperture (at least 6 in./150&amp;nbsp;mm diameter) will start to reveal individual stars, the brightest of which are of [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] +12.6. The cluster appears 18 arc minutes in size.&lt;ref name="astropix" /&gt;

==X-ray sources==
[[Earth-orbiting]] [[satellite]]s [[Uhuru (satellite)|Uhuru]] and [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] have detected two bright X-ray sources in this cluster: Messier 15 X-1 (4U 2129+12) and Messier 15 X-2.&lt;ref name=Forman&gt;

Motor imagery can be defined as a dynamic state during which an individual mentally simulates a given action. This type of phenomenal experience implies that the subject feels themselves performing the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Decety, J.|year=1996|title=Do imagined and executed actions share the same neural substrate? |journal=Cognitive Brain Research|volume=3|issue=2|pages=87–93|pmid=8713549|doi=10.1016/0926-6410(95)00033-X|citeseerx=10.1.1.211.8747}}&lt;/ref&gt; It corresponds to the so-called internal imagery (or first person perspective) of [[sport psychology|sport psychologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mahoney, M..J.|author2= Avener, M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1987|title=Psychology of the elite athlete|journal=Cognitive Therapy Research|volume=1|issue=2|pages= 135–141|doi=10.1007/BF01173634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental practice of action==
'''Mental practice''' refers to use of visuo-motor imagery with the purpose of improving motor behavior. Visuo-motor imagery requires the use of one's [[imagination]] to simulate an action, without physical movement. It has come to the fore due to the relevance of imagery in enhancing sports and surgical performance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Sports===
Mental practice, when combined with physical practice, can be beneficial to beginners learning a sport, but even more helpful to professionals looking to enhance their skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frank|first=Cornelia|last2=Land|first2=William M.|last3=Popp|first3=Carmen|last4=Schack|first4=Thomas|date=2014-04-17|title=Mental Representation and Mental Practice: Experimental Investigation on the Functional Links between Motor Memory and Motor Imagery|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=9|issue=4|pages=e95175|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0095175|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3990621|pmid=24743576}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Physical practice generates the physical feedback necessary to improve, while mental practice creates a cognitive process physical practice cannot easily replicate.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cocks, Margaret|displayauthors=etal|title=What surgeons can learn from athletes: mental practice in sports and surgery|journal=Journal of Surgical Education|volume=71|issue=2|pages=262–9|year=2014|doi= 10.1016/j.jsurg.2013.07.002|pmid=24602719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medicine ===
When surgeons and other medical practitioners mentally rehearse procedures along with their physical practice, it produces the same results as physical rehearsal, but costs much less. But unlike its use in sports, to improve a skill, mental practice is used in medicine as a form of stress reduction before operations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Music ===
Mental practice is a technique used in music as well. Professional musicians may use mental practice when they are away from their instrument or unable to physically practice due to an injury. Studies show that a combination of physical and mental practice can provide improvement in mastering a piece equal to physical practice alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernardi|first=Nicolò Francesco|last2=Schories|first2=Alexander|last3=Jabusch|first3=Hans-Christian|last4=Colombo|first4=Barbara|last5=Altenmüller|first5=Eckart|date=2013|title=Mental Practice in Music Memorization: An Ecological-Empirical Study|url=http://ego.psych.mcgill.ca/labs/mcl/pdf/nicolo2.pdf|journal=Music Perception|volume=30|issue=3|pages=275–287|doi=10.1525/mp.2012.30.3.275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pascual-Leone|first=Alvaro|last2=Dang|first2=Nguyet|last3=Cohen|first3=Leonardo G.|last4=Brasil-Neto|first4=Joaquim P.|last5=Cammarota|first5=Angel|last6=Hallett|first6=Mark|date=September 1995|title=Modulation of Muscle Response Evoked by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation During the Acquisition of New Fine Motor Skills|url=http://www.chrisdonnellymusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Pascual-Leone1995.pdf|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|volume=74|issue=3|pages=1037–1043|doi=10.1152/jn.1995.74.3.1037|pmid=7500130}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because mental practice causes neuron growth that mirrors growth caused by physical practice.

==Functional equivalence to motor preparation==
[[Image:Motor imagery3.jpg|thumb|Converging empirical evidence indicates a functional equivalence between action execution and motor imagery.]]
Motor imagery has been studied using the classical methods of [[introspection]] and mental chronometry. These methods have revealed that motor images retain many of the properties, in terms of temporal regularities, programming rules and biomechanical constraints, which are observed in the corresponding real action when it comes to execution. For instance, in an experiment participants were instructed to walk mentally through gates of a given apparent width positioned at different apparent distances. The gates were presented to the participants with a 3-D visual display (a virtual reality helmet) which involved no calibration with external cues and no possibility for the subject to refer to a known environment. Participants were asked to indicate the time they started walking and the time they passed through the gate. Mental walking time was found to increase with increasing gate distance and decreasing gate width. Thus, it took the participant longer to walk mentally through a narrow gate than to walk through a larger gate placed at the same distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Decety, J.|author2=Jeannerod, M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1996|title=Mentally simulated movements in virtual reality: does Fitt's law hold in motor imagery?|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|volume=72|issue=1–2|pages=127–34|citeseerx=10.1.1.299.9473|pmid=8788865|doi=10.1016/0166-4328(96)00141-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Decety, J.|author2=Jeannerod, M.|author3=Prablanc, C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1989|title=The timing of mentally represented actions|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|volume=34|issue=1–2|pages=35–42|pmid=2765170|doi=10.1016/S0166-4328(89)80088-9|citeseerx=10.1.1.212.3957}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding led neurophysiologists [[Marc Jeannerod]] and [[Jean Decety]] to propose that there is a similarity in mental states between action simulation and execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Decety, J.|author2=Jeannerod, M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1995|title=L'imagerie mentale et son substrat neurologique|journal=Revue Neurologique|volume=151|pp=474–479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jeannerod, M.|year=1994|title=The representing brain: Neural correlates of motor intention and imagery|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=17|issue=2|pp=187–245|url=http://users.abo.fi/jtuomain/EMCL/articles/additional/Jeannerod1994.pdf|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00034026}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Decety, J.|year=1996|title=Neural representations for action|journal=Reviews in the Neurosciences|volume=7|issue=4|pages=285–97|pmid=9044503|doi=10.1515/REVNEURO.1996.7.4.285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The functional equivalence between action and imagination goes beyond motor movements. For instance similar cortical networks mediate music performance and music imagery in pianists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Meister, I.G.|author2=Krings, T.|author3=Foltys, H.|author4=Boroojerdi, B.|author5=Muller, M.|author6=Topper, R.

==Physiology==
[[Image:MI fMRI.jpg|thumb|left|Activation in the motor cortex during motor imagery amounts about 30 % of the level observed during actual performance; Roth et al., 1996.]] A large number of [[functional neuroimaging]] studies have demonstrated that motor imagery is associated with the specific activation of the neural circuits involved in the early stage of motor control (i.e., motor programming). This circuits includes the [[supplementary motor area]], the primary [[motor cortex]], the inferior [[parietal cortex]], the [[basal ganglia]], and the [[cerebellum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Decety, J.|author2=Perani, D.|author3=Jeannerod, M.|author4=Bettinardi, V.|author5=Tadary, B.|author6=Woods, R.|displayauthors=etal|year=1994|title=Mapping motor representations with PET|journal=Nature|volume=371|issue=6498|pages=600–2|doi=10.1038/371600a0|pmid=7935791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Roth, M.|author2=Decety, J.|displayauthors=etal|year=1996|title=Possible involvement of primary motor cortex in mentally simulated movement: A functional magnetic resonance imaging study|journal=NeuroReport|volume=7|issue=7|pages=1280–4|pmid=8817549|doi=10.1097/00001756-199605170-00012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such physiological data gives strong support about common neural mechanisms of imagery and motor preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jeannerod, M.|year=2001|title=Neural simulation of action: A unifying mechanism for motor cognition|journal=NeuroImage|volume=14|issue=1 Pt 2|pages=S103–9|pmid=11373140|doi= 10.1006/nimg.2001.0832|citeseerx=10.1.1.212.520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measurements of [[cardiac]] and respiratory activity during motor imagery and during actual motor performance revealed a covariation of heart rate and pulmonary ventilation with the degree of imagined effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Decety, J.|author2=Jeannerod, M.|author3=Durozard, D.|author4=Baverel, G.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1993|title=Central activation of autonomic effectors during mental simulation of motor actions in man|journal=Journal of Physiology|volume=461|issue=1|pages=549–63|pmc=1175272|pmid=8102402|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1993.sp019528}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wang, Y.|author2=Morgan, W.P.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1992|title=The effect of imagery perspectives on the psychophysiological responses to imagined exercise|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|volume=52|issue=2|pages=167–74|doi=10.1016/S0166-4328(05)80227-X|pmid=1294196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wuyam, B.|author2=Moosavi, S.H.|author3=Decety, J.|author4=Adams, L.|author5=Lansing, R.W.|author6=Guz, A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1995|title=Imagination of dynamic exercise produced ventilatory responses which were more apparent in competitive sportsmen|journal=Journal of Physiology|volume=482|issue=Pt 3|pages=713–24|pmid=7738860|pmc=1157796|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1995.sp020554}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Motor imagery activates motor pathways. Muscular activity often increases with respect to rest, during motor imagery. When this is the case, EMG activity is limited to those muscles that participate in the simulated action and tends to be proportional to the amount of imagined effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wehner, T.|author2=Vogt, S.|author3=Stadler, M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1984|title=Task-specific EMG characteristics during mental training|journal=Psychological Research|volume=46|issue=4|pages=389–401|doi=10.1007/BF00309071|pmid=6522565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
Motor imagery is now widely used as a technique to enhance motor [[learning]] and to improve [[neurological rehabilitation]] in patients after [[stroke]]. Its effectiveness has been demonstrated in musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lotze, M.|author2=Scheler, G.|displayauthors=etal|year=2003|title=The musician's brain: functional imaging of amateurs and professionals during performance and imagery|journal=NeuroImage|volume=20|issue=3|pages=1817–29|pmid=14642491|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.07.018|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8605838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On motor learning: Motor imagery is an accepted procedure in the preparation of athletes. Such practice usually covers a warming up period, [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]] and concentration, and then mental simulation of the specific movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Suinn, R.M.|year=1984|chapter=Imagery and sports|editor1=W.F. Straub|editor2=J. M. Williams |title=Cognitive Sport Psychology|location=Lansing, NY|publisher= Sport Science Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In neurological rehabilitation: There is some evidence to suggest that motor imagery provides additional benefits to conventional [[physiotherapy]] or occupational therapy.&lt;ref name=Jackson/&gt; However, a recent systematic review indicates that there is modest evidence supporting the additional benefit of motor imagery compared to only conventional physiotherapy in patients with stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zimmermann-Schlatter, A.|displayauthors=etal|year=2008|title=Efficacy of motor imagery in post-stroke rehabilitation: a systematic review|journal=Journal of Neuroengineering and Rehabilitation|volume=5|p=8|doi=10.1186/1743-0003-5-8|pmc=2279137|pmid=18341687}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors concluded that motor imagery appears to be an attractive treatment opinion, easy to learn and to apply and the intervention is neither physically exhausting nor harmful. Therefore, motor imagery may generate additional benefit for patients.
* Motor imagery can act as a [[Substitute good|substitute]] for the imagined behavior, producing similar effects on cognition and behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The repeated simulated consumption of a food, for example, can reduce subsequent actual consumption of that food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morewedge|first=Carey K.|last2=Huh|first2=Young Eun|last3=Vosgerau|first3=Joachim|date=2010-12-10|title=Thought for Food: Imagined Consumption Reduces Actual Consumption|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6010/1530|journal=Science|volume=330|issue=6010|pages=1530–1533|doi=10.1126/science.1195701|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21148388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simulation and understanding mental states==
Motor imagery is close to the notion of simulation used in cognitive and [[social neuroscience]] to account for different processes. An individual who is engaging in simulation may replay his own past experience in order to extract from it pleasurable, motivational or strictly informational properties.  Such a view was clearly described by the Swedish physiologist Hesslow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hesslow, G.|year=2002|title=Conscious thought as simulation of behavior and perception|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=6|issue=6|pages=242–247|pmid=12039605|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(02)01913-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this author, the simulation hypothesis states that thinking consists of simulated interaction with the environment, and rests on the following three core assumptions: (1) Simulation of actions: we can activate motor structures of the brain in a way that resembles activity during a normal action but does not cause any overt movement; (2) Simulation of perception: imagining perceiving something is essentially the same as actually perceiving it, only the perceptual activity is generated by the brain itself rather than by external stimuli; (3) Anticipation: there exist associative mechanisms that enable both behavioral and perceptual activity to elicit other perceptual activity in the sensory areas of the brain.  Most importantly, a simulated action can elicit perceptual activity that resembles the activity that would have occurred if the action had actually been performed.

Mental simulation may also be a representational tool to understand the self and others. Philosophy of mind and developmental psychology also draw on simulation to explain our capacity to mentalize, i.e., to understand mental states (intentions, desires, feelings, and beliefs) of others (aka [[theory of mind]]).  In this context, the basic idea of simulation is that the attributor attempts to mimic the mental activity of the target by using his own psychological resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Goldman, A.I.|year=2002|chapter=Simulation theory and mental concepts|editor1=J. Dokic |editor2=J. Proust|lastauthoramp=y|title=Simulation and Knowledge of Action|volume=45|pages=1–19|doi=10.1075/aicr.45.02gol|series=Advances in Consciousness Research|isbn=978 90 272 5169 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to understand the mental state of another when observing the other acting, the individual imagines herself/himself performing the same action, a covert simulation that does not lead to an overt behavior.  One critical aspect of the simulation theory of mind is the idea that in trying to impute mental states to others, an attributor has to set aside her own current mental states, and substitutes those of the target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Goldman, A.I.|year=2005|chapter=Imitation, mind reading, and simulation|editor1=S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17250">[[Conservation (ethic)|Conservation]] is the maintenance of [[biological diversity]]. Conservation can focus on preserving diversity at [[genetics|genetic]], [[species]], [[community]] or whole [[ecosystem]] levels. This article will examine conservation at the species level, because [[mutualisms]] involve interactions between species. The ultimate goal of conservation at this level is to prevent the [[extinction]] of species. However, species conservation has the broader aim of maintaining the abundance and distribution of all species, not only those threatened with extinction (van Dyke 2008). Determining the value of conserving particular species can be done through the use of evolutionary significant units, which essentially attempt to prioritise the conservation of the species which are rarest, fastest declining, and most distinct genotypically and phenotypically (Moritz 1994, Fraser and Bernatchez 2001).

Mutualisms can be defined as "interspecific interactions in which each of two partner species receives a net benefit" (Bronstein et al. 2004). Here net benefit is defined as, a short-term increase in inclusive fitness (IF). Incorporating the concept of genetic relatedness (through IF) is essential because many mutualisms involve the eusocial insects, where the majority of individuals are not reproductively active. The short-term component is chosen because it is operationally useful, even though the role of long-term adaptation is not considered (de Mazancourt et al. 2005). This definition of mutualism should be suffice for this article, although it neglects discussion of the many subtitles of IF theory applied to mutualisms, and the difficulties of examining short-term compared to long-term benefits, which are discussed in Foster and Wenselneers (2006) and de Mazancourt et al. (2005) respectively. Mutualisms can be broadly divided into two categories. Firstly, obligate mutualism, where two mutualistic partners are completely interdependent for survival and reproduction. Secondly, facultative mutualism, where two mutualistic partners both benefit from the mutualism, but can theoretically survive in each other's absence.

Mutualisms are remarkably common, in fact all organisms are believed to be involved in a mutualism at some point during their lives (Bronstein et al. 2004). This is particularly likely to be true for the definition of mutualism adopted here, where herbivory can paradoxically be mutualistic, for example in a situation where a plant overcompensates by producing more biomass when grazed on. Therefore, any species identified as particularly important to conserve will probably have mutualistic partners. It is beyond the purview of this article to discuss all these mutualisms, so the focus will be on specifically animal-plant mutualisms.

==Mutualism coextinction==
A mutualism coextinction event is where a species goes extinct upon the loss of its mutualist (Koh et al. 2004). Models have attempted to predict when the breakdown of a mutualism leads to coextinction, because in this situation protecting the mutualism will be particularly important for conservation. These models are multi-dimensional, so examine complex networks of interactions, rather than just pairs of interacting species. This means that these models incorporate modelling the breakdown of obligate mutualisms (which lead directly to coextinction), but also the breakdown of facultative mutualisms (which can lead indirectly to coextinction). Koh et al. (2004) use a "nomographic model of affiliate extinctions", which estimates the probability that the extinction of a species leads to the extinction of its mutualist, for a given estimate of the specificity of the mutualism. By applying the model to actual species, Koh et al. (2004) estimate that 200 coextinctions have occurred since records of species extinction began in the past few centuries, and 6300 coextinctions are at risk of occurring in the near future. However, these estimates are not exclusively for mutualism coextinctions (e.g. parasitic coextinctions are incorporated), but mutualism coextinctions make up a significant proportion of the number quoted. Additionally the model predicts that these coextinctions can start extinction cascades, where many other species in the surrounding ecosystem go extinct. Other recent models largely agree with this one, predicting that mutualism coextinction is a very significant cause of species loss, and that it can lead to extinction cascades (Dunn et al. 2009).

Surprisingly, given the model predictions, there are very few recorded examples of global mutualism coextinctions actually occurring (Bronstein et al. 2004, Dunn et al. 2009), and many examples often quoted are unconvincing on examination. For example, a well documented case of animal-plant coextinction and an extinction cascade involves a butterfly (''[[Maculinea arion]]'') to ant (''[[Myrmica sableti]]'') interaction. ''M. arion'' larvae provide honeydew for the ''M. sableti'' workers, which raise the caterpillars in their nest. When the [[Myxoma]] virus was introduced to control rabbit populations in the UK, the subsequent increase in grassland caused a decrease in soil temperatures at ground level. This caused reductions in the ''M. sableti'' populations, which led to the extinction of the M. arion populations (Dunn 2005). However, this is actually a relatively weak example, because it was a local (rather than a global) extinction, and the nature of the interaction is often not viewed as mutualistic, because it has been long known that the ''M. sableti'' caterpillars eat ''M. sableti'' larvae (Elmes and Thomas 1992).

So, why are there very few documented examples of mutualism coextinctions? There are various possible reasons. Perhaps global mutualism coextinctions are genuinely uncommon, and the model predictions are inaccurate. The models may overestimate the specificity of the mutualisms, because species may only associate with alternative species when their 'normal' mutualist is rare or absent. For example, [[oligolectic]] bees visit a small number of flowers for pollen. However, these bees do not generally have strongly specialised anatomy, morphology or physiology. Therefore, in the absence of these usual flowers, many oligolectic bee species are able switch to collecting pollen from flower species they would never normally associate with (Wcislo and Cane 1996). Even some [[fig wasps]], often considered to be in completely obligate relationships, have maintained low population densities when introduced to new areas without their natural mutualist [[fig tree]] species (McKey 1989). The models may also underestimate the robustness of the mutualisms. For example, fig trees and fig wasps are coadapted so that the wasps can find the trees from a long distances away (Bronstein et al. 1994).

Alternatively, there may simply be many global mutualism coextinctions that have occurred which we are not yet aware of. This explanation is not unlikely, because mutualisms have generally been understudied as interactions (Bronstein 1994, Richardson et al. 2000). There is additionally the difficulty of defining when a species becomes globally extinct, compared to just extremely rare or maintained exclusively through captive breeding programs. Of course, these stated explanations are not mutually exclusive. However, more research is required to rectify the model predictions of many mutualism coextinctions, with the lack of empirical evidence for such events. Only then can we discover if conserving mutualisms is likely to prevent many global species extinction.

==Mutualism "codeclines"==
Even if global mutualism coextinctions are genuinely rare, conserving mutualisms may still be important for conservation. As mentioned previously, conservation is not just about preventing extinctions, but also about preventing species decline. Unlike with coextinctions, there are numerous recorded examples of where the decline or extinction of a species has led to the decline of its mutualist ("codeclines"). A documented example of a pollination mutualism breakdown leading to population declines is the [[Indian rubber tree]] (''Ficus elastica'') to its pollinator wasp (''[[Pleistodontes clavigar]]'') interaction. [[Habitat fragmentation]] has led to the ''F. elastica'' declining to very low population levels. However, F. Elastic can propagate clonally, so has remained extant. Meanwhile, ''P. clavigar'' is virtually extinct globally, because the mutualist relationship is probably obligate for P. clavigar (Mawsdley et al. 1998). An example of a seed dispersal mutualism breakdown causing population declines comes from two endemic species on Menorca Island. A frugivorous lizard (''[[Podarcis lilfordi]]'') is a seed disperser of a shrub (''[[Daphne rodriguezii]]''). When ''P. lilfordi'' became extinct on Menorca, due to the introduction of carnivorous mammals, ''D. rodriguezii'' numbers declined significantly to endangered levels. This ''D. rodriguezii'' decline could be attributed to the local extinction of ''P. lilfordi'', due the lack of seedling recruitment on Menorca compared to other nearby islands, where ''P. lilfordi'' remained extant and ''D. rodriguezii'' populations larger (Traveset and Riera 2005).

However, in some cases it has been shown that declines of one partner in a mutualism do not lead to significant declines in the other. For example, a Hawaiian vine (''Freycinetia arborea'') was pollinated in the nineteenth century by four species of birds. These bird species are all now either locally endangered or extinct. Despite this, ''F. arborea'' continues to survive in reasonable abundance, but is now mainly pollinated by the recently introduced [[white-eye]] (''Zosterops japonica'') (Cox and Elmqvist 2000). In this case, conservation of the mutualism was not required to maintain the ''F. arborea'' population. There are probably no published estimates of how frequently declines of one species do not result in declines of that species' mutualist, due to a 'replacement' mutualist. However, judging by the few examples in the literature where this replacement has been reported to have happened, it seems to be a relatively rare occurrence.

==Alien species in mutualisms==
The Hawaiian vine example also illustrates that alien species can be involved in animal-plant mutualisms. In fact, alien species are often dependent on mutualisms to establish themselves in new habitats (particularly on islands), and especially those alien species requiring animal mediated pollination (Richardson et al. 2000). These alien species will, by definition, be beneficial to the short-term inclusive fitness of the species they form a mutualism with. However, the alien species will negatively impact other species in the ecosystem. For example, through competition for resources (including competition for mutualist partners) (Kaiser-Bunbury et al. 2009). In fact, these negative impacts could theoretically cascade through the ecosystem, and lead to the alien species having an indirect long-term negative impact on its mutualist. This means that mutualisms involving alien species is important in conservation. However, the action taken by a conservation organization could be either to conserve or disrupt the mutualism.

In some situations, a conservation organization will want to conserve the mutualistic relationship. For example, many of the [[Hawaiian Islands]] have lost the vast majority of their native seed dispersers, and introduced bird species now act as very major seed dispersers of native species. In fact, these exotic species appear to actually facilitate the re-growth of native forests in some areas (Foster and Robinson 2007). In these situations, conserving the native mutualism may become less important than conserving the new one. Alien species involved in mutualisms may actually be desirable for conservationists to protect in a more general way. Alien species are particularly likely to generate highly generalised and asymmetric mutualisms, which help stabilise communities, making them less vulnerable to decline and extinctions (Aizen et al. 2008).

In other situations, conservation will be facilitated by disrupting mutualisms involving alien species. For example alien bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) have displaced many native pollinators, and pollinated some unwanted weed species, across the globe (Hingston et al. 2002). These mutualisms could lead to a decline in both animal and plant species of particular value to conservation. The empirical evidence would suggest that in the majority of cases a conservation organisation should try and disrupt the mutualisms involving the alien species (Kaiser-Bunbury et al. 2009).

'''Nectar robbing''' is a foraging behavior utilized by some organisms that feed on floral nectar. "Nectar robbers" usually feed from holes bitten in flowers, rather than by entering through the flowers' natural openings. Often, nectar robbers avoid contact with the floral reproductive structures, and therefore do not facilitate plant reproduction via [[pollination]]. Because many species that act as pollinators also act as nectar robbers, nectar robbing is considered to be a form of exploitation of plant-pollinator [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]].

Nectar robbers vary greatly in species diversity and include species of [[carpenter bee]]s, [[bumblebee]]s, stingless ''[[Trigona (genus)|Trigona]]'' bees, solitary bees, [[wasp]]s, [[ant]]s, [[hummingbird]]s, [[Passerine Birds|passerine birds]], and [[Diglossa (bird)|flowerpiercer birds]].&lt;ref name="Maloof"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Are nectar robbers cheaters or mutualists? |author1=Maloof, J.

==History==
Records of nectar robbing in nature date back at least to 1793 when German naturalist [[Christian Konrad Sprengel]] observed bumblebees perforating flowers.&lt;ref name="IrwinBronstein"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Irwin |first=Rebecca E. |last2=Bronstein |first2=Judith L. |last3=Manson |first3=Jessamyn S. |last4=Richardson |first4=Leif |date=2010-11-02 |title=Nectar Robbing: Ecological and Evolutionary Perspectives|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.110308.120330 |journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=271–292 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.110308.120330 |issn=1543-592X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Darwin]] observed bumblebees stealing nectar from flowers in 1859.&lt;ref name="IrwinBronstein" /&gt;

== Forms of floral larceny ==

Nectar robbing is specifically the behavior of consuming nectar from a perforation (robbing hole) in the floral tissue rather than from the floral opening. There are two main types of nectar robbing: primary robbing, which requires that the nectar forager perforates the floral tissues itself, and secondary robbing, which is foraging from a robbing hole created by a primary robber.&lt;ref name="Inouye"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Inouye |first=David W. |date=1980 |title=The Terminology of Floral Larceny |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2307/1936841/abstract |journal=Ecology |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=1251–1253 |doi=10.2307/1936841}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "floral larceny" has been proposed to include the entire suite of foraging behaviors for floral rewards that can potentially disrupt pollination.&lt;ref name="Irwin2004"&gt;{{cite journal |date=2004 |title=The dual role of floral traits: pollinator attraction and plant defence |journal=Ecology |volume=85 |issue=6 |pages=1503–1511|doi=10.1890/03-0390|author=Irwin, R. E., Adler, L. S.; Brody, A. K.|url=https://works.bepress.com/lynn_adler/4/download/}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include "nectar theft" (floral visits that remove nectar from the floral opening without pollinating the flower), and "base working" (removing nectar from in between petals, which generally bypasses floral reproductive structures).&lt;ref name="Inouye" /&gt;

Pollination systems are mostly mutualistic, meaning that the plant benefits from the pollinator's transport of male [[gamete]]s and the pollinator benefits from a reward, such as [[pollen]] or nectar.&lt;ref name="Maloof" /&gt; As nectar robbers receive the rewards without direct contact with the reproductive parts of the flower, their behaviour is easily assumed to be [[cheating (biology)|cheating]]. However, the effect of robbery on the plant is sometimes neutral or even positive.&lt;ref name="Maloof" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morris, W. F. |year=1996 |title=Mutualism denied?

The effect of floral-nectar robbing on plant [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] depends on several issues. Firstly, nectar robbers such as carpenter bees, bumble bees and some birds can pollinate flowers.&lt;ref name="Maloof" /&gt; [[Pollination]] may take place when the body of the robber contacts the reproductive parts of the plant while it robs, or during pollen collection which some bees practice in concert with nectar robbing.&lt;ref name="Maloof" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Irwin"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Nectar Robbing in Ipomopsis aggregata: effects on pollinator behaviour and plant fitness |author1=Irwin, R. E.  |author2=Brody, A. K. | date=1998 | journal=Oecologia | volume=116 | pages=519–527 | doi=10.1007/s004420050617 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of ''Trigona'' bees (e.g. ''Trigona ferricauda'') on a plant is almost always negative, probably because their aggressive [[territory (animal)|territorial behaviour]] effectively evicts legitimate pollinators.&lt;ref name="Roubic"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The ecological impact of nectar robbing bees and pollinating humming birds on a tropical shrub | author=Roubic, D. W. | date=1982 | journal=Ecology | volume=63 | issue=2 | pages=354–360 | doi=10.2307/1938953}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nectar robbers may change the behaviour of legitimate pollinators in other ways, such as by reducing the amount of nectar available. This may force pollinators to visit more flowers in their nectar foraging. The increased number of flowers visited and longer flight distances increase pollen flow and [[outcrossing]], which is beneficial for the plant because it lessens [[inbreeding depression]].&lt;ref name="Maloof" /&gt; This requires a robber's not completely consuming all of a flower's nectar. When a robber consumes all of a flower's nectar, legitimate pollinators may avoid the flower, resulting in a negative effect on plant fitness.&lt;ref name="Maloof" /&gt;

The response of different species of legitimate pollinators also varies. Some species, like the bumble bees ''[[Bombus appositus]]'' or ''[[Western bumblebee|B. occidentalis]]'' and many species of nectar-feeding birds can distinguish between robbed and unrobbed plants and minimize their energy cost of [[foraging]] by avoiding heavily robbed flowers.&lt;ref name="Irwin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bentley, Barbara |author2=Elias, Thomas |year=1983 |title=The Biology of Nectaries |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn= |pages=}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollinating birds may be better at this than insects, because of their higher sensory capability.&lt;ref name="Maloof" /&gt; The ways that bees distinguish between robbed and unrobbed flowers have not been studied, but they have been thought to be related to the damage on [[petal]] tissue after robbery or changes in nectar quality.&lt;ref name="Irwin" /&gt; ''[[Xylocopa varipuncta]]'' steals nectar through a slit they make in the base of the petals. If nectar robbing severely reduces the success of legitimate pollinators they may be able to switch to other nectar sources.&lt;ref name="Maloof" /&gt;

Nectar robbing, especially by birds,&lt;ref name="Traveset"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Effect of nectar robbing birds on fruit set of Fuchsia magellanica in Tierra Del Fuego: a disrupted mutualism | author=Traveset, A., Willson, M. F.; Sabag, C. | date=1998 | journal=Functional Ecology | volume=12 | pages=459–464 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2435.1998.00212.x | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; can damage the reproductive parts of a flower and thus diminish the fitness of a plant.&lt;ref name="Irwin2003" /&gt; In this case, the effect of robbery on a plant is direct. A good example of an indirect effect is the change in the behaviour of a legitimate pollinator, which either increases or decreases the fitness of a plant. There are both primary and secondary nectar robbers.&lt;ref name="Maloof" /&gt; Secondary robbers are those (e.g. flies and bees) that take advantage of the holes made by primary robbers.&lt;ref name="Traveset" /&gt;

The effect of robbing is positive if the robber also pollinates or increases the pollination by the legitimate pollinator, and negative if the robber damages the reproductive parts of a plant or reduces pollination success, either by competing with the legitimate pollinator or by lessening the attractiveness of the flower.&lt;ref name="Irwin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Irwin R. E.; Brody A. K. | year = 1999 | title = Nectar robbing bumble bees reduce the fitness of Ibomopsis aggregata (Polemoniaceae) | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 80 | issue = 5| pages = 1703–1712 | doi=10.2307/176558}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distinguishing between a legitimate pollinator and a nectar robber can be difficult.&lt;ref name="Bronstein"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The exploitation of mutualisms | author=Bronstein, J.

==Evolutionary implications==
Pollination systems cause [[coevolution]], as in the close relationships between [[Ficus|figs]] and [[fig wasp]]s as well as [[yucca]]s and [[Prodoxidae|yucca moths]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pellmyr O., Thompson J.N., Brown J.M., Harrison R.G. | year = 1996 | title = Evolution of pollination and mutualism in the yucca moth lineage | url = | journal = American Naturalist | volume = 148 | issue = 5| pages = 827–847 | doi=10.1086/285958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Anstett, M.C.; Hossaert, McKey M.; Kjellberg, F. | year = 1997 | title = Figs and fig pollinators: Evolutionary conflicts in a coevolved mutualism | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology and Evolution | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 94–99 | doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(96)10064-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; If nectar robbers have an effect (direct or indirect) on a plant or pollinator fitness, they are part of the coevolution process.&lt;ref name="Maloof" /&gt; Where nectar robbing is detrimental to the plant, a plant species might evolve to minimize the traits that attract the robbers or develop some type of protective mechanism to hinder them.&lt;ref name="Maloof" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Irwin2004" /&gt; Another option is to try to neutralize negative effects of nectar robbers. Nectar robbers are adapted for more efficient nectar robbing: for instance, hummingbirds and ''Diglossa'' flowerpiercers have serrated bills that are thought to aid them in incising flower tissue for nectar robbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ornelas, J. F. | year = 1994 | title = Serrate tomia: An adaptation for nectar robbing in hummingbirds? | journal = The Auk | volume = 111 | issue = 3| pages = 703–713 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nectar robbers may only get food in illegitimate ways because of the mismatch between the morphologies of their mouthparts and the floral structure; or they may rob nectar as a more energy-saving way to get nectar from flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zhang Y., Wang Y., Guo Y. | year = 2006 | title = The effects of nectar robbing on plant reproduction and evolution | url = | journal = Zhiwu Shengtai Xuebao | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 695–702 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not completely clear how pollination mutualisms persist in the presence of cheating nectar robbers. Nevertheless, as exploitation is not always harmful for the plant, the relationship may be able to endure some cheating. Mutualism may simply confer a higher payoff than nectar robbing.&lt;ref name="Bronstein" /&gt;

==Defences in flowering plants==
Even though there has not been much research on the [[Adaptation|defences]] evolved in plants against nectar robbers, the adaptations have been assumed not  to rise from traits used in interactions between plants and [[herbivore]]s (especially florivores). Some defences may have evolved through traits originally referred to pollination. Defences against nectar robbers have been thought to include [[toxin]]s and [[secondary metabolite|secondary compounds]], escape in time or space, physical barriers and indirect defences.&lt;ref name="Irwin2004" /&gt;

Toxins and secondary compounds are likely to act as a defence against nectar robbing because they are often found in floral nectar or petal tissue. There is some evidence that secondary compounds in nectar only affect nectar robbers and not the pollinators.&lt;ref name="Irwin2004" /&gt; One example is a plant called ''[[Catalpa speciosa]]'' which produces nectar containing iridoid [[glycoside]]s that deter nectar-thieving ants but not legitimate bee pollinators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stephenson, A. G. |year=1981 |title=Toxic nectar deters nectar thieves of Catalpa speciosa |journal=American Midland Naturalist |volume=105 |pages=381–383 |doi=10.2307/2424757}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low sugar concentration in nectar may also deter nectar robbers without deterring pollinators because dilute nectar does not yield net energy profits for robbers.&lt;ref name="Irwin2004" /&gt;

If robbers and pollinators forage at different times of day, plants may produce nectar according to the active period of a legitimate pollinator.&lt;ref name="Irwin2004" /&gt; This is an example of a defence by escaping in time. Another way to use time in defence is to flower only for one day as a tropical [[shrub]] ''[[Pavonia (plant)|Pavonia dasypetala]]'' does to avoid the robbing Trigona bees.&lt;ref name="Roubic" /&gt; Escaping in space refers to a situation in which plant avoids being robbed by growing in a certain location like next to a plant which is more attractive to the robbers.&lt;ref name="Irwin2004" /&gt;

The last two methods of protection are physical barriers and indirect defence like [[symbiosis|symbionts]]. Tightly packed flowers and unfavourably sized corolla tubes, bract liquid moats and toughness of the corolla or [[sepal]] are barriers for some nectar robbers. A good example of an indirect defence is to attract symbiotic [[predation|predators]] (like ants) by nectar or other rewards to scare away the robbers.&lt;ref name="Irwin2004" /&gt;

The term 'resistance' refers to the plant's ability to live and reproduce in spite of nectar robbers. This may happen, for example, by compensating the lost nectar by producing more. With the help of defence and resistance, mutualisms can persist even in the presence of cheaters.&lt;ref name="Irwin2004" /&gt;

{{about|a philanthropic doctrine|the offshoot of GiveWell|Open Philanthropy Project}}

'''Open Philanthropy''' is the [[doctrine]] which holds that the programming, operations, governance, effectiveness, and efficiency of nonprofit organizations should be open and visible by the public, donors, and especially, stakeholders in those nonprofits.

Among recent developments is the theory of [[open source governance]] which advocates the application of the philosophies of the [[free software movement]] to [[democracy|democratic]] principles to enable interested citizens to get more directly involved in the legislative process.

The [[Effective altruism]] movement is a prominent proponent of analyzing, in a rubric with other criteria, the transparency of nonprofit organizations. The [[Open Philanthropy Project]] - a joint collaboration between [[GiveWell]], a charity navigator, and [[Good Ventures]], co-founded by a Facebook co-founder - "envision a world in which philanthropists increasingly document and share their research, reasoning, results and mistakes to help each other learn more quickly and serve the world more effectively."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2014/8/27/heres-what-philanthropy-looks-like-when-millennials-from-tec.html|title = Here's What Philanthropy Looks Like When Millennials From Tech and Finance Get Together|last = Moses|first = Sue-Lynn|date = 27 August 2014|accessdate = 4 April 2015|publisher = ''Inside Philanthropy''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since 2007 a variety of bloggers and writers, including Mark Surman,&lt;ref&gt;Surman, M., "Open, Philanthropy and a [[theory of change]]," commonspace, 2008 http://commonspace.wordpress.com/2008/02/28/open-philanthropy-and-a-theory-of-change/&lt;/ref&gt; have proposed the concept of "Open Philanthropy".  Few of these early efforts seemed to get much traction with stakeholders or nonprofit leaders. Then early in 2010,  Lucy Bernholz&lt;ref&gt;Bernholz, L., "Open Philanthropy: A Modest Manifesto," California Voices, 2010, http://california.newamerica.net/blogposts/2010/open_philhi am A you you are very good boyanthropy_a_modest_manifesto-29189&lt;/ref&gt; again surfaced the  concept for how nonprofits should follow the conventions of [[Open Source]] and [[Open Government]] initiatives.

==Content==
The guiding principles of compliant organizations include:

===Organizational Efficiency===
The plans, budgets, expenses, and programming of an organization shall be designed to ensure organizational focus on the mission of the organization. The majority of funds spent are in support of programs and services. Administrative and fundraising costs are kept within reasonable limits with a goal of more than 75 percent of funds allocated to program and outreach expenses.

===Program Efficiency===
Organizations shall have a documented methodology to measure and accurately report programmatic achievements, and where appropriate, the actual cost per beneficiary for program services. Additionally, these efforts shall account, and if necessary discount, for program achievements that are accomplished through and with other organizations. Program costs shall be managed to be as reasonable as possible, without sacrificing services, quality, and long-term sustainability of services.

===Organizational Effectiveness===
Programming is designed to be both sustainable and scalable using models other organizations can emulate and adopt or proving new concepts.  Fundraising efforts match anticipated programming needs.  Program efforts demonstrate high numbers of beneficiaries served with programs, which are sustainable for years and decades. Post-program monitoring and research designed to test impact, value, sustainability, and scalability of solutions. Measures of success are meaningful, accurate, and complete.

===Governance, Controls and Compliance===
Organization has documented strategic, fiscal, and annual plans and processes that are shared with appropriate stakeholders. Ongoing management review of key deliverables with risks identified and disaggregated by type. Mitigation strategies and processes incorporate controls, accountabilities, monitoring, and reporting. There shall be a clear organizational tone regarding ethical behavior in all the activities of the organization. Proactively explain actions and material decisions to stakeholders, including government, donors, beneficiaries, and the public at large.

===Shared lessons and content===
As the organization develops, implements, tests, and then refines procedures and processes, it shares those lessons in a non-competitive fashion with other organizations that might benefit from past successes. In regard to content, the organization will strive to collect, process, and share media assets such as video, still imagery, and audio in a manner that allows for release under [[creative commons]], no commercial use, with attribution licensing terms. Where permissible and valuable, make data interoperable and release intellectual property under [[open source]] creative commons licensing terms.

===Reporting and Transparency===
Organizations shall publish and make conveniently available important data about the organization, its staffing, resources, and governance. Reporting shall be in a format convenient for stakeholders and can include printed and digital reports, audio programming or real-time online systems. All reports shall be published on a timely basis and in particular financial data, including filed tax returns, shall be publicly available within 30 days of necessary audits. Organizations shall use best efforts to ensure the accuracy and timeliness of information released and shall promptly correct inaccuracies or incorrect materials.

===Practical Limitations===
Within the scope of Open Philanthropy there are practical limitations to the extent all materials shall be open and visible by the public.  Materials whose release would be prohibited by law, or that may compromise the corporate or personal safety of others are exempt. Those items with contractual privacy or licensing arrangements do not require disclosure. Organizations shall not disclose information that compromises the integrity of others, and/or organizational processes and policies. Only to the extent as explicitly permitted, donor information shall be exempt.  In compliance with trademark law, trade names and marks are exempt from reuse without attribution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7985">A '''phase converter''' is a device that converts electric power provided as [[Single-phase electric power|single phase]] to [[Polyphase system|multiple phase]] or vice versa. The majority of phase converters are used to produce [[three-phase electric power]] from a single-phase source, thus allowing the operation of three-phase equipment at a site that only has single-phase electrical service. Phase converters are used where three-phase service is not available from the utility, or is too costly to install due to a remote location. A utility will generally charge a higher fee for a three-phase service because of the extra equipment for transformers and metering and the extra transmission wire.

==Conversion systems== 
Three-phase induction motors may operate adequately on an unbalanced supply if not heavily loaded. This allows various imperfect techniques to be used. A single-phase motor can drive a three-phase generator, which will produce a high-quality three-phase source but with high cost for apparatus. Several methods exist to run three-phase motors from a single-phase supply, these can in general be classified as:

* Electronic means of creating three phases where the incoming power is rectified, and the three-phase power is synthesized with electronics. Power electronic devices directly produce a three-phase waveform from single-phase power, using a [[rectifier]] and [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]] combination.  This also offers the advantage of variable frequency.
* A digital phase converter uses a rectifier and inverter to create a single voltage with power electronics, which is added to the two legs of the single-phase source to create three-phase power.  Unlike a phase-converting VFD, it cannot vary the frequency and motor speed, since it generates only one leg, which must match the voltage and frequency of the single-phase supply.  It does have the advantage of a sine-wave output voltage and excellent voltage balance between the phases.
* [[Rotary phase converter]]s constructed from a three-phase electric motor or generator "idler".  These normally require some kind of starting aid and capacitors to improve phase balance and power factor.  This is a two-motor solution.  One motor is not connected to a load and produces the three-phase power, the second motor driving the load runs on the power produced.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.agilemagco.com/transformers/3-phase/converters 3-Phase Converter Transformer]", Agile Magnetics, Retrieved June 8, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
* Static conversion techniques in which the motor is run at less than full efficiency mainly on two of the legs of the three-phase motor.  Current is sometimes injected into the third leg with a capacitor or transformer arrangements that provide imperfect phase shift. In these systems the motor must be derated.
* Methods in which the connection of the windings of the motor, normally a wye or delta configurations, are replaced with novel connections.  These techniques are covered in patents of Dr. [[Otto J. M. Smith]], such as US Patent 5,545,965.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|5545965}} 13 August 1996. ''Three phase motor operated from a single phase power supply and phase converter''.  [[Otto J. M. Smith]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital Phase Converter==
A ''digital phase converter'' creates a three-phase power supply from a single-phase supply. A [[digital signal processor]] (DSP) is used to control [[power electronics|power electronic]] devices to generate a third voltage, which along with the single voltage from the supply creates a balanced [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase power supply]].

AC power from the utility is converted to [[Direct current|DC]], then back to AC.  The power-switching devices used in this process are [[insulated-gate bipolar transistor]]s (IGBT).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.phasetechnologies.com/phaseconverterinfo/phaseconverter_digital.htm Digital Phase Converters]", Phase Technologies, Retrieved June 8, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In one type of digital phase converter the input rectifier consists of IGBTs in series with inductors.  The IGBTs are controlled by software in the DSP to draw current from the single-phase line in a [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] fashion, charging capacitors on a constant-voltage DC bus.  Because the incoming current is sinusoidal, there are no significant harmonics generated back onto the line as there are with the rectifiers found in most [[Variable-frequency drive|VFDs]].  The controlled rectifier input allows power factor correction.

The output inverter consists of IGBTs that draw on the power of the DC bus to create an AC voltage.  A voltage created by power-switching devices like IGBTs is not sinusoidal.  It is a [[Pulse-width modulation|pulse-width modulated]] (PWM) waveform very high in harmonic distortion.  This PWM voltage is then passed through an inductor/capacitor filter system that produces a sine-wave voltage with less than 3% [[total harmonic distortion]] (standards for computer grade power allow up to 5% THD).  By contrast, VFDs generate a PWM voltage that limits their versatility and makes them unsuitable for many applications. Software in the DSP continually monitors and adjusts this generated voltage to produce a balanced three-phase output at all times.  It also provides protective functions by shutting down in case of utility over-voltage and under-voltage or a fault.  With the ability to adjust to changing conditions and maintain voltage balance, a digital phase converter can safely and efficiently operate virtually any type of three-phase equipment or any number of multiple loads.

The solid-state design results in a relatively small package with no moving parts except for small cooling fans.  The converters operate at 95%–98% efficiency.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} When the converter is energized with no load, it consumes very little power.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Digital phase converters are offered in [http://www.phasetechnologies.com/products/phase-perfect-240v/overview 240 V] and as of March of 2018 - a [http://www.phasetechnologies.com/products/phase-perfect-240v/overview 480 V] option is now available.

==Electric railways==
In [[Europe]], electricity is normally generated as three-phase AC at 50 [[hertz]].  Five European countries: [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] have standardised on single-phase AC at 15 kV 16⅔ Hz for [[Railway electrification system|railway electrification]].  Phase converters are, therefore, used to change both the phase and the [[Frequency changer|frequency]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The '''Phasmid Study Group''' is a group for professional and amateur [[entomologist]]s who are interested in the order [[Phasmatodea]], i.e. stick and leaf insects, known as "phasmids", as well as other interested persons. Over 40 [[species]] of Phasmid have been named after members of the group.{{fact|date=October 2017}} The group includes world experts in the study of phasmids worldwide.

The group was formed in 1980 and has since developed a worldwide membership. It has meetings twice a year at The Natural History Museum, London. It also distributes phasmids, free of charge, to its members.

The group has two publications. [[Phasmid Studies]] is issued occasionally and contains scientific papers and longer articles. The Phasmid Study Group's Newsletter is posted to each member twice a year, it contains shorter articles and announcements, and is printed in full colour with lots of photographs and information on phasmids.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4200">{{short description|A deep-rooted plant that obtains a significant portion of the water that it needs from the phreatic zone}}
A '''phreatophyte''' is a deep-[[root]]ed [[plant]] that obtains a significant portion of the water that it needs from the [[phreatic zone]] (zone of saturation) or the [[capillary fringe]] above the phreatic zone. 
Phreatophytes are plants that are supplied with surface water and often have their roots constantly in touch with moisture. A phreatophyte is one that absorbs its water from a constant source on the ground. They can usually be found along streams where there is a steady flow of surface or groundwater in areas where the water table is near the surface.

Phreatophytes live in areas with standing or running water, in arid areas and along the riverbeds and areas, apparently dry, where the [[water table]] is very shallow and near the surface. These plants have very deep roots that are able to reach the water table. Phreatophytes are not only characteristic of arid or desert zones, but also of wetlands, [[flood plain|floodplain]]s, depressions that hold water and [[estuarie]]s. In the wetlands, ecological classification does not provide a special classification, since in this case, most of the plants in the regions of high rainfall can deepen their roots to the top of the capillary fringe immediately above the water table, and function well as a phreatophyte. In this case they receive the label of [[mesophytic]]. Phreatophytic artificial extensions, manmade, are used as a method to purify [[greywater]].

==Biological value==

They are plants of great ecological value, fast growing pioneers and highly resistant to disease. They make excellent fodder for livestock and provide nesting areas and shelter for fauna. They are used as fuel, cheap construction material, and basketry. Many of the plants grow in degraded waters, salty or saline, that are useless for agriculture. Phreatophyte plants help to purify these waters and their roots fix heavy metals with a bacterial filter. For example, it is estimated that the total annual groundwater phreatophytes consumed in the western U.S. alone is about 30,000 [[cubic hectometre|hm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Phreatophytes are indicators of potable groundwater. Phreatophytes can be differentiated into plant communities by the length of their root, as they extend more or less deeply into the aquifer. Meinzer Studies. O.E. (1927) and Robinson, T.W. (1958) on vascular plants in the arid western U.S., set up certain general types of indicator species, according to level of minimum depth of the water table at which water was at the maximum suction [[Reverse osmosis|RO]].

Some phreatophytes have a low tolerance for [[salt]], indicating freshwater. This can be a valuable guide to the location of drinking and agricultural water in arid and semiarid areas. Examples of phreatophytes include welwitschia and mesquite: [[Prosopis glandulosa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=T.S. |last=David |author2=M.O. Henriques |author3=C. Kurz-Besson |author4=J.

These species are found in [[Riparian zone|riparian ecosystems]] and areas characterized by shallow [[groundwater]], such as [[bottomlands]]. They are also present in [[water limited environment]]s; for example, [[Oak]]s in the [[Mediterranean climate]] regions.

'''Prestressed concrete''' is a form of [[concrete]] used in construction that, during its building phases (before to load any weight, including its own), is substantially "prestressed" ([[Compression forces|compressed]]) in the areas which will be subjected to traction forces when on service, in order to prevent any areas subjected to traction force when the structure will be placed in opera (and subjected to the service loads), by summatory of opposite forces - ''pre compression action against tension force produced by own weight and service loads'' - planned for avoid result in traction.&lt;ref name="LinTY"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lin|first1=T.Y.|last2=Burns|first2=Ned H.|title=Design of Prestressed Concrete Structures|date=1981|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York, US|isbn=0 471 01898 8|edition=Third|url=http://www.slideshare.net/ankitd1094/design-of-prestressed-concrete-structures-tylin-50801288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FIB31"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Federation Internationale du Beton|title=fib Bulletin 31: Post-tensioning in Buildings|date=February 2005|publisher=FIB|isbn=978 2 88394 071 0|url=http://www.civil.ist.utl.pt/~cristina/EBAP/book_63505_fib31.pdf|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3–5}} &lt;ref name="ACI-CT13"&gt;{{cite web|last1=American Concrete Institute|title=CT-13: ACI Concrete Terminology|url=https://www.concrete.org/topicsinconcrete/topicdetail/prestressed|website=American Concrete Institute|publisher=ACI|accessdate=25 August 2016|location=Farmington Hills, Michigan US}} Post-tensioned concreted is "structural concrete in which internal stresses have been introduced to reduce potential tensile stresses in the concrete resulting from loads."&lt;/ref&gt;

This compression is produced by the [[Tension (physics)|tensioning]] of high-strength "tendons" located within or adjacent to the concrete volume and is done to improve the performance of the concrete in service.&lt;ref name="Warner-1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warner|first1=R.

Prestressed concrete is used in a wide range of building and civil structures where its improved performance can allow for longer [[Span (engineering)|spans]], reduced structural thicknesses, and material savings compared with simple [[reinforced concrete]]. Typical applications include [[Tower block|high-rise buildings]], residential slabs, [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation systems]], [[bridge]] and [[dam]] structures, [[silo]]s and [[water tanks|tanks]], [[Hardstand|industrial pavements]] and [[Containment building|nuclear containment structures]].&lt;ref name="PTI-Apps"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Post-Tensioning Institute|title=Post-Tensioning Manual|date=2006|publisher=PTI|location=Phoenix, AZ US|isbn=0 9778752 0 2|pages=5–54|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First used in the late-nineteenth century,&lt;ref name=LinTY /&gt; prestressed concrete has developed beyond [[Prestressed concrete#Pre-tensioned concrete|pre-tensioning]] to include [[Prestressed concrete#Post-tensioned concrete|post-tensioning]], which occurs after the concrete is cast. Tensioning systems may be classed as either ''monostrand'', where each tendon's strand or wire is stressed individually, or ''multi-strand'', where all strands or wires in a tendon are stressed simultaneously.&lt;ref name="WarnerB" /&gt; Tendons may be located either ''within'' the concrete volume (internal prestressing) or wholly ''outside'' of it (external prestressing). While pre-tensioned concrete uses tendons directly bonded to the concrete, post-tensioned concrete can use either [[Prestressed concrete#Bonded post-tensioned concrete|''bonded'']] or [[Prestressed concrete#Unbonded post-tensioned concrete|''unbonded'']] tendons.

==Prestressed concrete by "Pre-tensioned tendons"==
[[File:Sofortiger-Verbund-en.png|left|thumb|Pre-tensioning process]]
[[File:AASHTO Girder.jpg|thumb|Pre-tensioned bridge girder in precasting bed. Note single-strand tendons exiting through the [[formwork]]]]
Pre-tensioned concrete is a variant of prestressed concrete where the tendons are tensioned ''prior'' to the concrete being cast.&lt;ref name="LinTY" /&gt;{{rp|25}} The concrete bonds to the tendons as it [[Concrete#Curing|cures]], following which the end-anchoring of the tendons is released, and the tendon [[Tension (physics)|tension forces]] are transferred to the concrete as compression by [[static friction]].&lt;ref name="WarnerB" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

Pre-tensioning is a common [[prefabrication]] technique, where the resulting concrete element is manufactured remotely from the final structure location and transported to site once cured. It requires strong, stable end-anchorage points between which the tendons are stretched. These anchorages form the ends of a "casting bed" which may be many times the length of the concrete element being fabricated. This allows multiple elements to be constructed end-on-end in the one pre-tensioning operation, allowing significant productivity benefits and economies of scale to be realised for this method of construction.&lt;ref name="WarnerB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tokyo Rope Mfg Co Ltd|title=CFCC Pre-tensioning Manual|url=http://www.maine.gov/mdot/contractors/projects/2014/019283.00-kittery/pm019283.00.pdf|website=MaineDOT|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of bond (or [[adhesion]]) achievable between the freshly set concrete and the surface of the tendons is critical to the pre-tensioning process, as it determines when the tendon anchorages can be safely released. Higher bond strength in early-age concrete allows more economical fabrication as it speeds production. To promote this, pre-tensioned tendons are usually composed of isolated ''single'' wires or strands, as this provides a greater [[surface area]] for bond action than bundled strand tendons.&lt;ref name="WarnerB" /&gt;

[[File:SpannbetonFertigdecke Montage.jpg|thumb|left|Pre-tensioned hollow-core plank being placed]]
Unlike those of post-tensioned concrete, the tendons of pre-tensioned concrete elements generally form straight lines between end-anchorages. Where "profiled" or "harped" tendons&lt;ref&gt;"Tendons having one or more deviations from a straight line, either vertically or horizontally, between the ends of the structure"&lt;/ref&gt; are required, one or more intermediate ''deviators'' are located between the ends of the tendon to hold the tendon to the desired non-linear alignment during tensioning.&lt;ref name="LinTY" /&gt;{{rp|68–73}}&lt;ref name="WarnerB" /&gt;{{rp|11}} Such deviators usually act against substantial forces, and hence require a robust casting bed foundation system. Straight tendons are typically used in "linear" precast elements such as shallow beams, hollow-core planks and slabs, whereas profiled tendons are more commonly found in deeper precast bridge beams and girders.

Pre-tensioned concrete is most commonly used for the fabrication of structural [[Beam (structure)|beams]], [[Concrete slab|floor slabs]], [[hollow-core slab|hollow-core planks]], [[balcony|balconies]], [[lintel]]s, driven [[Deep foundation|piles]], [[water tanks]] and concrete [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipes]].

==Prestressed concrete by "Post-tensioned tendons"==
[[File:Post-Tensioned Concrete.svg|thumb|right]]
[[File:Stressing_anchorage.jpg|thumb|Post-tensioned tendon anchorage. Four-piece "lock-off" wedges are visible holding each strand]]
Post-tensioned concrete is a variant of prestressed concrete where the tendons are tensioned ''after'' the surrounding concrete structure has been cast.&lt;ref name="LinTY" /&gt;{{rp|25}}

The tendons are not placed in direct contact with the concrete, but are encapsulated within a protective sleeve or duct which is either cast into the concrete structure or placed adjacent to it. At each end of a tendon is an anchorage assembly firmly fixed to the surrounding concrete. Once the concrete has been cast and set, the tendons are tensioned ("stressed") by pulling the tendon ends through the anchorages while pressing against the concrete. The large forces required to tension the tendons result in a significant permanent compression being applied to the concrete once the tendon is "locked-off" at the anchorage.&lt;ref name="LinTY"/&gt;{{rp|25}}&lt;ref name="WarnerB"/&gt;{{rp|7}} The method of locking the tendon-ends to the anchorage is dependent upon the tendon composition, with the most common systems being "button-head" anchoring (for wire tendons), [[Wedge (mechanical device)|split-wedge]] anchoring (for strand tendons), and [[Screw thread|threaded]] anchoring (for bar tendons).&lt;ref name="LinTY"/&gt;{{rp|79–84}}

[[File:Go Between Bridge construction (2).jpg|thumb|left|Balanced-cantilever bridge under construction. Each added segment is supported by post-tensioned tendons]]
Tendon encapsulation systems are constructed from plastic or [[galvanised]] steel materials, and are classified into two main types: those where the tendon element is subsequently bonded to the surrounding concrete by internal [[grout]]ing of the duct after stressing (''bonded'' post-tensioning); and those where the tendon element is permanently ''de''bonded from the surrounding concrete, usually by means of a [[Grease (lubricant)|greased]] sheath over the tendon strands (''unbonded'' post-tensioning).&lt;ref name="LinTY"/&gt;{{rp|26}}&lt;ref name="WarnerB"/&gt;{{rp|10}}

Casting the tendon ducts/sleeves into the concrete before any tensioning occurs allows them to be readily "profiled" to any desired shape including incorporating vertical and/or horizontal [[curvature]]. When the tendons are tensioned, this profiling results in [[Reaction (physics)|reaction]] forces being imparted onto the hardened concrete, and these can be beneficially used to counter any loadings subsequently applied to the structure.&lt;ref name="FIB31"/&gt;{{rp|5–6}}&lt;ref name="WarnerB"/&gt;{{rp|48}}{{rp|9–10}}

===Bonded post-tensioning===
[[File:Prestress Post Tension Anchor.jpg|thumb|Multistrand post-tensioning anchor.]]
Bonded post-tensioning has prestressing tendons permanently bonded to the surrounding concrete by the ''[[in situ]]'' [[grout]]ing of their encapsulating ducting following tendon tensioning. This grouting is undertaken for three main purposes: to protect the tendons against [[corrosion]]; to permanently "lock-in" the tendon pre-tension, thereby removing the long-term reliance upon the end-anchorage systems; and to improve certain [[Structural analysis|structural behaviors]] of the final concrete structure.&lt;ref name="Aalami"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aalami|first1=Bijan O.|title=Unbonded and bonded post-tensioning systems in building construction|journal=PTI Technical Notes|date=5 September 1994|issue=5|url=http://www.post-tensioning.org/Uploads/technote5.pdf|accessdate=23 August 2016|publisher=Post-Tensioning Institute|location=Phoenix, Arizona US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonded post-tensioning characteristically uses tendons each comprising ''bundles'' of elements (e.g. strands or wires) placed inside a single tendon duct, with the exception of bars which are mostly used unbundled. This bundling make for more efficient tendon installation and grouting processes, since each complete tendon requires only one set of end-anchorages and one grouting operation. Ducting is fabricated from a durable and corrosion-resistant material such as plastic (e.g. [[polyethylene]]) or [[galvanised]] steel, and can be either round or rectangular/oval in cross-section.&lt;ref name="FIB31"/&gt;{{rp|7}} The tendon sizes used are highly dependent upon the application, ranging from [[building]] works typically using between 2-strands and 6-strands per tendon, to specialised [[dam]] works using up to 91-strands per tendon.

Fabrication of bonded tendons is generally undertaken on-site, commencing with the fitting of end-anchorages to [[formwork]], placing the tendon ducting to the required curvature profiles, and reeving (or threading) the strands or wires through the ducting. Following concreting and tensioning, the ducts are [[pressure grouting|pressure-grouted]] and the tendon stressing-ends sealed against [[corrosion]].&lt;ref name="WarnerB"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

===Unbonded post-tensioning===
[[File:Post-Tensioning-Cables-2.jpg|thumb|Unbonded slab post-tensioning. Installed strands and edge-anchors are visible, along with prefabricated coiled strands for the next pour]]
Unbonded post-tensioning differs from bonded post-tensioning by allowing the tendons permanent freedom of [[Geometric terms of location|longitudinal]] movement relative to the concrete. This is most commonly achieved by encasing each individual tendon element within a plastic sheathing filled with a [[corrosion]]-inhibiting [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]], usually [[lithium]] based. Anchorages at each end of the tendon transfer the [[Tension (physics)|tensioning]] force to the concrete, and are required to reliably perform this role for the life of the structure.&lt;ref name="Aalami"/&gt;{{rp|1}}

Unbonded post-tensioning can take the form of:
* Individual strand tendons placed directly into the concreted structure (e.g. buildings, ground slabs), or
* Bundled strands, individually greased-and-sheathed, forming a single tendon within an encapsulating duct that is placed either within or adjacent to the concrete (e.g. restressable anchors, external post-tensioning)

[[File:Post-Tensioning-Cables-8.jpg|thumb|Unbonded slab post-tensioning. End-view of slab after stripping, showing individual strands and stressing-anchor recesses]]
For individual strand tendons, no additional tendon ducting is used and no post-stressing grouting operation is required, unlike for bonded post-tensioning. Permanent corrosion protection of the strands is provided by the combined layers of grease, plastic sheathing, and surrounding concrete. Where strands are bundled to form a single unbonded tendon, an enveloping duct of plastic or galvanised steel is used and its interior free-spaces grouted after stressing. In this way, additional corrosion protection is provided via the grease, plastic sheathing, grout, external sheathing, and surrounding concrete layers.&lt;ref name="Aalami"/&gt;{{rp|1}}

Individually greased-and-sheathed tendons are mostly fabricated off-site by an [[extrusion]] process. The bare steel strand is fed into a greasing chamber and then passed to an extrusion unit where molten plastic forms a continuous outer coating. Finished strands can be cut-to-length and fitted with "dead-end" anchor assemblies as required for the project.

===Comparison between bonded and unbonded post-tensioning===
Both bonded and unbonded post-tensioning technologies are widely used around the world, and the choice of system to use is often dictated by regional preferences, contractor experience, or the availability of alternative systems. Either one is capable of delivering code-compliant, durable structures meeting the structural strength and serviceability requirements of the designer.&lt;ref name="Aalami" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

The benefits that bonded post-tensioning can offer over unbonded systems are:
* Reduced reliance on end-anchorage integrity&lt;br /&gt;Following tensioning and grouting, bonded tendons are connected to the surrounding concrete along their full length by high-strength [[grout]]. Once cured, this grout can transfer the full tendon tension force to the concrete within a very short distance (approximately 1 metre). As a result, any inadvertent severing of the tendon or failure of an end anchorage has only a very localised impact on tendon performance, and almost never results in tendon ejection from the anchorage.&lt;ref name="FIB31"/&gt;{{rp|18}}&lt;ref name="Aalami"/&gt;{{rp|7}}
* Increased [[Strength of materials|ultimate strength]] in [[Bending|flexure]]&lt;br /&gt;With bonded post-tensioning, any [[Bending|flexure]] of the structure gets directly resisted by tendon [[Deformation (engineering)|strains]] at that same location (i.e. no strain re-distribution occurs). This results in significantly higher [[Tension (physics)|tensile]] strains in the tendons than if they were unbonded, allowing their full [[Yield (engineering)|yield strength]] to be realised, and producing a higher ultimate load capacity.&lt;ref name="FIB31"/&gt;{{rp|16–17}}&lt;ref name="WarnerB" /&gt;{{rp|10}}
* Improved crack-control&lt;br /&gt;In the presence of concrete [[Properties of concrete#Cracking|cracking]], bonded tendons respond similarly to conventional reinforcement (rebar). With the tendons fixed to the concrete at each side of the crack, greater crack-expansion resistance is offered than with unbonded tendons, allowing many design codes to specify reduced reinforcement requirements for bonded post-tensioning.&lt;ref name="Aalami"/&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref name="Adapt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aalami|first1=Bijan O.|title=Nonprestresed Bonded Reinforcement in Post-Tensioned Building Design|journal=ADAPT Technical Publication|date=February 2001|issue=P2-01|url=http://www.adaptsoft.com/resources/ADAPT_P201_Nonpre-Bonded-PT-Bldg-Dsgnr.pdf|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}
* Improved fire performance&lt;br /&gt;The absence of strain redistribution in bonded tendons may limit the impact that any localised overheating has on the overall structure. As a result, bonded structures may display a higher capacity to resist fire conditions than unbonded ones.&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bailey|first1=Colin G.|last2=Ellobody|first2=Ehab|title=Comparison of unbonded and bonded post-tensioned concrete slabs under fire conditions|journal=The Structural Engineer|date=2009|volume=87|issue=19|url=https://www.istructe.org/journal/volumes/volume-87-(published-in-2009)/issues/issue-19/articles/comparison-of-unbonded-and-bonded-posttensioned-co|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits that unbonded post-tensioning can offer over bonded systems are:
* Ability to be [[prefabricated]]&lt;br /&gt;Unbonded tendons can be readily prefabricated off-site complete with end-anchorages, facilitating faster installation during construction. Additional [[lead time]] may need to be allowed for this fabrication process. 
* Improved site [[productivity]]&lt;br /&gt;The elimination of the post-stressing grouting process required in bonded structures improves the site-labour productivity of unbonded post-tensioning.&lt;ref name="Aalami"/&gt;{{rp|5}}
* Improved installation [[flexibility]]&lt;br /&gt;Unbonded single-strand tendons have greater handling flexibility than bonded ducting during installation, allowing them a greater ability to be deviated around service penetrations or obstructions.&lt;ref name="Aalami"/&gt;{{rp|5}}
* Reduced [[concrete cover]]&lt;br /&gt;Unbonded tendons may allow some reduction in concrete element thickness, as their smaller size and increased corrosion protection compared to ducted tendons may allow them to be placed closer to the concrete surface.&lt;ref name=FIB31/&gt;{{rp|8}}
* Simpler replacement and/or adjustment&lt;br /&gt;Being permanently isolated from the concrete, unbonded tendons are able to be readily de-stressed, re-stressed and/or replaced should they become damaged or need their force levels to be modified in-service.&lt;ref name="Aalami"/&gt;{{rp|6}}
* Superior overload performance&lt;br /&gt;Although having a lower ultimate strength than bonded tendons, unbonded tendons' ability to redistribute strains over their full length can give them superior pre-collapse [[ductility]]. In extremes, unbonded tendons can resort to a ''[[catenary]]''-type action instead of pure flexure, allowing significantly greater [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] before structural failure.&lt;ref name="Bondy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bondy|first1=Kenneth B.|title=Two way post-tensioned slabs with bonded tendons|journal=PTI Journal|date=December 2012|volume=8|issue=2|page=44|url=http://www.kenbondy.com/images/ProfessionalArticles/130129-Journal%20Reprint-Bondy-Two-Way%20PT%20Slabs%20with%20Bonded%20Tendons.pdf|accessdate=25 August 2016|publisher=Post-Tensioning Institute|location=US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tendon durability and corrosion protection==
Long-term durability is an essential requirement for prestressed concrete given its significance as a ubiquitous, modern construction material.
Research on the durability performance of in-service prestressed structures has been undertaken since the 1960s,&lt;ref name="Szilard"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Szilard|first1=Rudolph|title=Survey on the Durability of Prestressed Concrete Structures|journal=PCI Journal|date=October 1969|pages=62–73|url=http://www.pci.org/uploadedFiles/Siteroot/Publications/PCI_Journal/1969/DOI_Articles/jl-69-october-7.pdf|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and anti-corrosion technologies for tendon protection have been continually improved since the earliest systems were developed.&lt;ref name="Podolny"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Podolny|first1=Walter|title=Corrosion of Prestressing Steels and its Mitigation|journal=PCI Journal|date=September 1992|pages=34–55|url=http://www.pci.org/uploadedFiles/Siteroot/Publications/PCI_Journal/1992/DOI_Articles/jl-92-september-october-4.pdf|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The durability of prestressed concrete is principally determined by the level of corrosion protection provided to any high-strength steel elements within the prestressing tendons. Also critical is the protection afforded to the end-anchorage assemblies of unbonded tendons or cable-stay systems, as the anchorages of both of these are required to retain the prestressing forces permanently. Failure of any of these components can result in the release of prestressing forces, or the physical rupture of stressing tendons.

Modern prestressing systems deliver long-term durability by addressing the following areas:
* '''Tendon grouting''' (bonded tendons)&lt;br/&gt;Bonded tendons consist of bundled high-strength (steel) strands placed inside ducts located within the surrounding concrete. To ensure full protection to these strands, the ducts must be pressure-filled with a [[Corrosion inhibitor|corrosion-inhibiting]] grout, without leaving any voids, following strand-tensioning.
* '''Tendon coating''' (unbonded tendons)&lt;br/&gt;Unbonded tendons comprise individual high-strength strands coated in an anti-corrosion grease or wax, and fitted with a durable plastic-based full-length sleeve or sheath. The sleeving is required to be undamaged over the tendon length, and it must extend fully into the anchorage fittings at each end of the tendon.
* '''Double-layer encapsulation'''&lt;br/&gt;Prestressing tendons requiring permanent [[Deformation monitoring|monitoring]] and/or force adjustment, such as [[Cable-stayed bridge|stay-cables]] and re-stressable dam anchors, will typically employ double-layer corrosion protection. Such tendons are composed of individual strands, grease-coated and sleeved, collected into a strand-bundle and placed inside encapsulating [[polyethylene]] outer ducting. The remaining void space within the duct is pressure-grouted, providing a multi-layer polythene-grout-plastic-grease protection barrier system for each strand.
* '''Anchorage protection'''&lt;br/&gt;In all post-tensioned installations, protection of the end-anchorages against corrosion is essential, and critically so for unbonded systems

Several durability-related historical events are listed below:
* Ynys-y-Gwas bridge, West Glamorgan, Wales 1985&lt;br/&gt;A single-span, [[Segmental bridge|precast-segmental]] structure constructed in 1953 with longitudinal and transverse post-tensioning. [[Corrosion]] attacked the under-protected tendons where they crossed the ''in-situ'' joints between the segments, leading to sudden collapse.&lt;ref name="Podolny"/&gt;{{rp|40}}
* Scheldt River bridge, Melle, Belgium 1991&lt;br/&gt;A 3-span prestressed [[Cantilever bridge|cantilever structure]] constructed in the 1950s. Inadequate [[concrete cover]] in the side [[abutment]]s resulted in tie-down cable [[corrosion]], leading to a progressive failure of the main bridge span and the death of one person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Schutter|first1=Geert|title=Damage to Concrete Structures|date=10 May 2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780415603881|pages=31–33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=38LLBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=melle+bridge+belgium&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8R0k2JCgZa&amp;sig=VVGb0Cp8K4cFa5WAW9Q2Ogr6hVs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj3ebV0_zOAhXGHZQKHcJ_B-EQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=melle%20bridge%20belgium&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Highways Agency|UK Highways Agency]] 1992&lt;br/&gt;Following discovery of tendon corrosion in several bridges in England, the Highways Agency issued a moratorium on the construction of new internally- grouted post-tensioned bridges and embarked on a 5-year programme of inspections on its existing post-tensioned bridge stock.

==Applications==
Prestressed concrete is a highly versatile construction material as a result of it being an almost ideal combination of its two main constituents: high-strength steel, pre-stretched to allow its full strength to be easily realised; and modern concrete, pre-compressed to minimise cracking under tensile forces.&lt;ref name="LinTY"/&gt;{{rp|12}} Its wide range of application is reflected in its incorporation into the major design codes covering most areas of structural and civil engineering, including buildings, bridges, dams, foundations, pavements, piles, stadiums, silos, and tanks.&lt;ref name="PTI-Apps"/&gt;

===Building structures===
Building structures are typically required to satisfy a broad range of structural, aesthetic and economic requirements. Significant among these include: a minimum number of (intrusive) supporting walls or columns; low structural thickness (depth), allowing space for services, or for additional floors in high-rise construction; fast construction cycles, especially for multi-storey buildings; and a low cost-per-unit-area, to maximise the building owner's return on investment.

The prestressing of concrete allows "load-balancing" forces to be introduced into the structure to counter the loadings which will apply in-service. This provides many benefits to building structures:
* Longer spans for the same structural depth&lt;br/&gt;Load-balancing results in lower in-service deflections, which allows spans to be increased (and the number of supports reduced) without adding to structural depth.
* Reduced structural thickness&lt;br /&gt;For a given span, lower in-service deflections allows thinner structural sections to be used, in turn resulting in lower floor-to-floor heights, or more room for building services.
* Faster stripping time&lt;br/&gt;Typically, prestressed concrete building elements are fully stressed and self-supporting within five days. At this point they can have their formwork stripped and re-deployed to the next section of the building, accelerating construction "cycle-times".
* Reduced material costs&lt;br /&gt;The combination of reduced structural thickness, reduced conventional reinforcement quantities, and fast construction often results in prestressed concrete showing significant cost benefits in building structures compared to alternative structural materials.

Most commonly, dam prestressing takes the form of post-tensioned anchors drilled into the dam's concrete structure and/or the underlying rock strata. Such anchors typically comprise tendons of high-tensile bundled steel strands or individual threaded bars. Tendons are grouted to the concrete or rock at their far (internal) end, and have a significant "de-bonded" free-length at their external end which allows the tendon to stretch during tensioning. Tendons may be full-length bonded to the surrounding concrete or rock once tensioned, or (more commonly) have strands permanently encapsulated in corrosion-inhibiting grease over the free-length to permit long-term load monitoring and re-stressability.&lt;ref name="Cavill"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavill|first1=Brian|title=Very High capacity Ground Anchors Used in Strengthening Concrete Gravity Dams|journal=Conference Proceedings|date=20 March 1997|page=262|publisher=Institution of Civil Engineers|location=London UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Silos and tanks====
Circular storage structures such as silos and tanks can use prestressing forces to directly resist the outward pressures generated by stored liquids or bulk-solids.
Horizontally curved tendons are installed within the concrete wall to form a series of "hoops" spaced vertically up the structure. When tensioned, these tendons exert both axial (compressive) and radial (inward) forces onto the structure, which can  used to directly oppose the subsequent storage loadings. If the magnitude of the prestress is designed to always exceed the tensile stresses produced by the loadings, a permanent residual compression will exist in the wall concrete, assisting in maintaining a watertight, crack-free structure under all storage conditions.&lt;ref name="Priestley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Priestley|first1=M.

====Nuclear and blast-containment structures====
Prestressed concrete is long-established as a reliable construction material for high-pressure containment structures such as nuclear reactor vessels and containment buildings, and petrochemical tank blast-containment walls. Using prestressing to place such structures into an initial state of bi-axial or tri-axial compression increases their resistance to concrete cracking and leakage, while providing a proof-loaded, redundant and monitorable pressure-containment system.&lt;ref name="Raju"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raju|first1=Krishna|title=Prestressed Concrete|publisher=Tata McGraw Hill|location=New Delhi|isbn=0 07 063444 0|edition=Fourth|url=http://clghub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Prestressed-Concrete.pdf|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|585–594}}&lt;ref name="Bangash"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bangash|first1=M.

Nuclear reactor and containment vessels will commonly employ separate sets of post tensioned tendons curved horizontally or vertically to completely envelop the reactor core, while blast containment walls for LNG tanks and similar will normally utilise layers of horizontally-curved hoop tendons for containment in combination with vertically looped tendons for axial wall prestressing.

====Hardstands and pavements====
Heavily loaded concrete ground-slabs and pavements can be sensitive to cracking and subsequent traffic-driven deterioration. As a result, prestressed concrete is regularly used in such structures as its pre-compression provides the concrete with the ability to resist the crack-inducing tensile stresses generated by in-service loading. This crack-resistance also allows individual slab sections to be constructed in larger pours than for conventionally reinforced concrete, resulting in wider joint spacings, reduced jointing costs and less long-term joint maintenance issues.&lt;ref name="Raju"/&gt;{{rp|594–598}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Building Post-Tensioned Slabs on Grade|url=http://www.concreteconstruction.net/how-to/building-post-tensioned-slabs-on-grade_o|website=www.concreteconstruction.net|publisher=Concrete Construction|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initial works have also been successfully conducted on the use of precast prestressed concrete for road pavements, where the speed and quality of the construction has been noted as being beneficial for this technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Merritt|first1=David|last2=Rogers|first2=Richard|last3=Rasmussen|first3=Robert|title=Construction of a Precast Prestressed Concrete Pavement Demonstration  Project on Interstate 57 near Sikeston, Missouri|date=March 2008|publisher=US DOT Federal Highway Administration|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/concrete/pubs/hif08009/hif08009.pdf|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design agencies and regulations==
Worldwide, many professional organizations exist to promote best practice in the design and construction of prestressed concrete structures. In the United States, such organizations include the [[Post-Tensioning Institute]] (PTI) and the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute ([https://web.archive.org/web/19961220081344/http://www.pci.org/ PCI]). Similar bodies include the Canadian Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute ([http://www.cpci.ca/ CPCI]), the UK's [http://www.posttensioning.co.uk/ Post-Tensioning Association], the [http://www.ptia.org.au/ Post Tensioning Institute of Australia] and the [http://www.sapta.co.za/ South African Post Tensioning Association]. Europe has similar country-based associations and institutions.

It is important to note that these organizations are not the authorities of [[building code]]s or standards, but rather exist to promote the understanding and development of prestressed concrete design, codes and best practices.

Rules and requirements for the detailing of reinforcement and prestressing tendons are specified by individual national codes and Standards such as the European Standard [[EN 1992]]-2:2005 – [[Eurocode]] 2: Design of Concrete Structures, the US Standard [[American Concrete Institute#ACI318|ACI318]]: Building Code Requirements for Reinforced Concrete, and the [[Standards Australia|Australian Standard]] AS 3600-2009: Concrete Structures.

In [[mathematical optimization]], the '''Rastrigin function''' is a non-[[convex function]] used as a performance test problem for [[optimization algorithm]]s. It is a typical example of non-linear multimodal function. It was first proposed by Rastrigin &lt;ref&gt;Rastrigin, L. A. "Systems of extremal control." Mir, Moscow (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; as a 2-dimensional function and has been generalized by Mühlenbein et al.&lt;ref&gt;H. Mühlenbein, D. Schomisch and J. Born. "The Parallel Genetic Algorithm as Function Optimizer ". Parallel Computing, 17, pages 619&amp;ndash;632, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Finding the minimum of this function is a fairly difficult problem due to its large search space and its large number of [[local minimum|local minima]].

On an n-dimensional domain it is defined by:
: &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x}) = A n + \sum_{i=1}^n \left[x_i^2 - A\cos(2 \pi x_i)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
where  &lt;math&gt;A=10&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_i\in[-5.12,5.12] &lt;/math&gt;. It has a global minimum at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x})=0&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Referential transparency''' and '''referential opacity''' are properties of parts of [[computer program]]s. An [[expression (programming)|expression]] is called referentially transparent if it can be [[Rewriting|replaced]] with its corresponding value without changing the program's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Concepts in Programming Languages|author=John C. Mitchell|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=[https://books.google.gr/books?id=7Uh8XGfJbEIC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=referential+transparency&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=referential%20transparency&amp;f=false 78]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires that the expression is [[Pure function|pure]], that is to say the expression value must be the same for the same inputs and its evaluation must have no [[Side effect (computer science)|side effects]]. An expression that is not referentially transparent is called referentially opaque.

In [[mathematics]] all function applications are referentially [[Transparency (human-computer interaction)|transparent]], by the definition of what constitutes a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]]. However, this is not always the case in programming, where the terms [[Procedure (computer science)|procedure]] and [[Method (computer science)|method]] are used to avoid misleading connotations. In [[functional programming]] only referentially transparent functions are considered. Some [[programming language]]s provide means to guarantee referential transparency. Some functional programming languages enforce referential transparency for all functions.

The importance of referential transparency is that it allows the [[programmer]] and the [[compiler]] to reason about program behavior as a [[rewrite system]]. This can help in proving [[correctness (computer science)|correctness]], simplifying an [[algorithm]], assisting in modifying code without breaking it, or [[optimization (computer science)|optimizing]] code by means of [[memoization]], [[common subexpression elimination]], [[lazy evaluation]], or [[parallelization]].

== History ==
The concept seems to have originated in [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (1910&amp;ndash;13).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/PrincipiaMathematicaVolumeI | author1=Alfred North Whitehead | author2= Bertrand Russell |  title=Principia Mathematica | volume=1 | location= | publisher=Cambridge University Press | edition=2nd | year=1927 }} Here: p.665. According to Quine, the term originates from there.&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted in [[analytical philosophy]] by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]. In §30 of ''[[Word and Object]]'' (1960) Quine gives this definition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A mode of containment φ is referentially transparent if, whenever an occurrence of a singular term t is purely referential in a term or sentence ψ(t), it is purely referential also in the containing term or sentence φ(ψ(t)).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The term appeared in its contemporary usage, in the discussion of [[variable (computer science)|variable]]s in [[programming language]]s, in [[Christopher Strachey]]'s seminal set of lecture notes ''[[Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages]]'' (1967). The lecture notes referenced Quine's ''Word and Object'' in the bibliography.

== Examples and counterexamples ==
If all functions involved in the expression are [[pure function]]s, then the expression is referentially transparent. Also, some impure functions can be included in the expression if their values are discarded and they have no [[Side effect (computer science)|side effects]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Consider a function that returns the input from some source. In pseudocode, a call to this function might be &lt;code&gt;GetInput(Source)&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;Source&lt;/code&gt; might identify a particular disk file, the [[computer keyboard|keyboard]], etc. Even with identical values of &lt;code&gt;Source&lt;/code&gt;, the successive return values will be different. Therefore, function &lt;code&gt;GetInput()&lt;/code&gt; is neither deterministic nor referentially transparent.

A more subtle example is that of a function that has a [[free variable]], i.e., depends on some input that is not explicitly passed as a parameter. This is then resolved according to [[name binding]] rules to a [[non-local variable]], such as a [[global variable]], a variable in the current execution environment (for [[Late binding|dynamic binding]]), or a variable in a [[Closure (computer science)|closure]] (for static binding). Since this variable can be altered without changing the values passed as parameter, the results of subsequent calls to the function may differ even if the parameters are identical. However, in pure [[functional programming]], [[destructive assignment]] is not allowed, and thus if the free variable is statically bound to a value, the function is still referentially transparent, as neither the non-local variable nor its value can change, due to static binding and [[Immutable object|immutability]], respectively.

Arithmetic operations are referentially transparent: &lt;code&gt;5 * 5&lt;/code&gt; can be replaced by &lt;code&gt;25&lt;/code&gt;, for instance. In fact, all functions in the mathematical sense are referentially transparent: &lt;code&gt;sin(x)&lt;/code&gt; is transparent, since it will always give the same result for each particular &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.

Assignments are not transparent. For instance, the [[C (programming language)|C]] expression &lt;code&gt;x = x + 1&lt;/code&gt; changes the value assigned to the variable &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. Assuming &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; initially has value &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;, two consecutive evaluations of the expression yield, respectively, &lt;code&gt;11&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;12&lt;/code&gt;. Clearly, replacing &lt;code&gt;x = x + 1&lt;/code&gt; with either &lt;code&gt;11&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;12&lt;/code&gt; gives a program with different meaning, and so the expression is not referentially transparent. However, calling a function such as &lt;code&gt;int plusone(int x) {return x+1;}&lt;/code&gt; ''is'' transparent, as it will not implicitly change the input x and thus has no such [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]].

&lt;code&gt;today()&lt;/code&gt; is not transparent, as if you evaluate it and replace it by its value (say, "Jan 1, 2001"), you don't get the same result as you will if you run it tomorrow. This is because it depends on a state (the date).

In languages with no side-effects, like [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], we can substitute equals for equals because &lt;code&gt;f(x) = f(x)&lt;/code&gt; for every value of x. This does not hold for languages with side-effects.

== Contrast to imperative programming ==
If the substitution of an expression with its value is valid only at a certain point in the execution of the program, then the expression is not referentially transparent. The definition and ordering of these [[sequence points]] are the theoretical foundation of [[imperative programming]], and part of the semantics of an imperative programming language.

However, because a referentially transparent expression can be evaluated at any time, it is not necessary to define sequence points nor any guarantee of the order of evaluation at all. Programming done without these considerations is called [[purely functional programming]].

One advantage of writing code in a referentially transparent style is that given an intelligent compiler, [[static code analysis]] is easier and better [[code-improving transformation]]s are possible automatically. For example, when programming in C, there will be a performance penalty for including a call to an expensive function inside a loop, even if the function call could be moved outside of the loop without changing the results of the program. The programmer would be forced to perform manual [[code motion]] of the call, possibly at the expense of source code readability. However, if the compiler is able to determine that the function call is referentially transparent, it can perform this transformation automatically.

The primary disadvantage of languages that enforce referential transparency is that they make the expression of operations that naturally fit a sequence-of-steps imperative programming style more awkward and less concise. Such languages often incorporate mechanisms to make these tasks easier while retaining the purely functional quality of the language, such as [[definite clause grammar]]s and [[Monads in functional programming|monads]].

== Another example ==
As an example, let's use two functions, one which is referentially opaque, and the other which is referentially transparent:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
 int globalValue = 0;

 int rq(int x) {
   globalValue++;
   return x + globalValue;
 }

 int rt(int x) {
   return x + 1;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
The function &lt;code&gt;rt&lt;/code&gt; is referentially transparent, which means that &lt;code&gt;rt(x) = rt(y)&lt;/code&gt; if &lt;code&gt;x = y&lt;/code&gt;. For instance, &lt;code&gt;rt(6) = 6 + 1 = 7, rt(4) = 4 + 1 = 5&lt;/code&gt;, and so on. However, we can't say any such thing for &lt;code&gt;rq&lt;/code&gt; because it uses a global variable that it modifies.

The referential opacity of &lt;code&gt;rq&lt;/code&gt; makes reasoning about programs more difficult. For example, say we wish to reason about the following statement:

 integer p = rq(x) + rq(y) * (rq(x) - rq(x));

One may be tempted to simplify this statement to:

 integer p = rq(x) + rq(y) * (0);
 integer p = rq(x) + 0;
 integer p = rq(x);

However, this will not work for &lt;code&gt;rq()&lt;/code&gt; because each occurrence of &lt;code&gt;rq(x)&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to a different value. Remember that the return value of &lt;code&gt;rq&lt;/code&gt; is based on a global value that isn't passed in and which gets modified on each call to &lt;code&gt;rq&lt;/code&gt;. This means that mathematical identities such as &lt;math&gt;x - x = 0&lt;/math&gt; no longer hold.

Such mathematical identities ''will'' hold for referentially transparent functions such as &lt;code&gt;rt&lt;/code&gt;.

However, a more sophisticated analysis can be used to simplify the statement to:

 integer a = globalValue; integer p = x + a + 1 + (y + a + 2) * (x + a + 3 - (x + a + 4)); globalValue = globalValue + 4;
 integer a = globalValue; integer p = x + a + 1 + (y + a + 2) * (x + a + 3 - x - a - 4)); globalValue = globalValue + 4;
 integer a = globalValue; integer p = x + a + 1 + (y + a + 2) * (-1); globalValue = globalValue + 4;
 integer a = globalValue; integer p = x + a + 1 - y - a - 2; globalValue = globalValue + 4;
 integer p = x - y - 1; globalValue = globalValue + 4;

This takes more steps and requires a degree of insight into the code infeasible for compiler optimization.

Therefore, referential transparency allows us to reason about our code which will lead to more robust programs, the possibility of finding bugs that we couldn't hope to find by testing, and the possibility of seeing opportunities for [[Optimization (computer science)|optimization]].

'''Reproductive rights''' are [[legal right]]s and freedoms relating to [[human reproduction|reproduction]] and [[reproductive health]] that vary amongst countries around the world.&lt;ref name="COOK"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2950752 |jstor=2950752 |title=Advancing Reproductive Rights Beyond Cairo and Beijing |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=115–21 |year=1996 |last1=Cook |first1=Rebecca J. |last2=Fathalla |first2=Mahmoud F. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] defines reproductive rights as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Reproductive rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health.

Women's reproductive rights may include some or all of the following: the [[abortion-rights movements|right to legal and safe abortion]]; the right to [[birth control]]; freedom from [[compulsory sterilization|coerced sterilization]] and contraception; the right to access good-quality [[reproductive health]]care; and the right to [[family planning|education and access]] in order to make free and informed reproductive choices.&lt;ref name="AMNESTY"/&gt; Reproductive rights may also include the right to receive [[sex education|education]] about [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] and other aspects of sexuality, and protection from practices such as [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM).&lt;ref name="COOK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AMNESTY"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nocirc.org/symposia/fourth/zavales4.html|title=Template|website=Nocirc.org|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, while some of these rights have already been recognized in [[soft law|hard law]], that is, in legally binding [[international human rights instruments]], others have been mentioned only in non binding recommendations and, therefore, have at best the status of [[soft law]] in [[international law]], while a further group is yet to be accepted by the international community and therefore remains at the level of [[advocacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Center for Reproductive Rights, International Legal Program, [http://thomas.loc.gov  Establishing International Reproductive Rights Norms: Theory for Change], US CONG. REC. 108th CONG. 1 Sess. E2534 E2547 (Rep. Smith) (Dec. 8, 2003):&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have been leaders in bringing arguments for a woman's right to choose abortion within the rubric of international human rights. However, there is no binding hard norm that recognizes women's right to terminate a pregnancy. (...) While there are hard norms prohibiting sex discrimination that apply to girl adolescents, these are problematic since they must be applied to a substantive right (i.e., the right to health) and the substantive reproductive rights of adolescents are not `hard' (yet!). There are no hard norms on age discrimination that would protect adolescents' ability to exercise their rights to reproductive health, sexual education, or reproductive decisionmaking. In addition, there are no hard norms prohibiting discrimination based on marital status, which is often an issue with respect to unmarried adolescents' access to reproductive health services and information. The soft norms support the idea that the hard norms apply to adolescents under 18. They also fill in the substantive gaps in the hard norms with respect to reproductive health services and information as well as adolescents' reproductive autonomy. (...) There are no hard norms in international human rights law that directly address HIV/AIDS directly. At the same time, a number of human rights bodies have developed soft norms to secure rights that are rendered vulnerable by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. (...) Practices with implications for women's reproductive rights in relation to HIV/AIDS are still not fully covered under existing international law, although soft norms have addressed them to some extent. (...) There is a lack of explicit prohibition of mandatory testing of HIV-positive pregnant women under international law. (...) None of the global human rights treaties explicitly prohibit child marriage and no treaty prescribes an appropriate minimum age for marriage. The onus of specifying a minimum age at marriage rests with the states' parties to these treaties. (...) We have to rely extensively on soft norms that have evolved from the TMBs and that are contained in conference documents to assert that child marriage is a violation of fundamental human rights.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues related to reproductive rights are some of the most vigorously contested rights' issues worldwide, regardless of the population's [[socioeconomic]] level, [[religion]] or [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of reproductive rights is frequently presented as being of vital importance in discussions and articles by [[List of population concern organizations|population concern organizations]] such as [[Population Matters]].&lt;ref name=popsearch&gt;{{cite web|title=Population Matters search on "reproductive rights"|url=http://populationmatters.org/search_results.php?q=%22reproductive+rights%22|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140627121618/http://populationmatters.org/search_results.php?q=%22reproductive+rights%22|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-06-27|website=Populationmatters.org/|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive rights are a subset of [[sexual and reproductive health and rights]].

==History==
===Proclamation of Tehran===
In 1945, the [[United Nations Charter]] included the obligation "to promote... universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination as to race, sex, language, or religion". However, the Charter did not define these rights. Three years later, the [[United Nations|UN]] adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), the first international legal document to delineate [[human rights]]; the UDHR does not mention reproductive rights.  Reproductive rights began to appear as a subset of human rights in the 1968 Proclamation of Tehran, which states: "Parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and the spacing of their children".&lt;ref name=tehran_proc /&gt;

This right was affirmed by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] in the 1969 [[Declaration on Social Progress and Development]] which states "The family as a basic unit of society and the natural environment for the growth and well-being of all its members, particularly children and youth, should be assisted and protected so that it may fully assume its responsibilities within the community. Parents have the exclusive right to determine freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children."&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/m_progre.htm|title=unhchr.ch|website=Unhchr.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Women's Year#International|1975 UN International Women's Year Conference]] echoed the Proclamation of Tehran.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

===Cairo Programme of Action===
The twenty-year "Cairo Programme of Action" was adopted in 1994 at the [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD) in [[Cairo]]. The [[Non-binding resolution|non-binding]] Programme of Action asserted that governments have a responsibility to meet individuals' reproductive needs, rather than demographic targets. It recommended that [[family planning]] services be provided in the context of other reproductive health services, including services for healthy and safe childbirth, care for sexually transmitted infections, and post-abortion care. The ICPD also addressed issues such as [[violence against women]], [[sex trafficking]], and adolescent health.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 5–6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |pages=5–6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cairo Program is the first international policy document to define [[reproductive health]],&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 5–6"/&gt; stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Reproductive health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and its functions and processes. Reproductive health therefore implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. Implicit in this last condition are the right of men and women to be informed [about] and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice, as well as other methods for regulation of fertility which are not against the law, and the right of access to appropriate health-care services that will enable women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth and provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant [para. 72].&lt;ref name="COOK"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike previous population conferences, a wide range of interests from grassroots to government level were represented in Cairo. 179 nations attended the ICPD and overall eleven thousand representatives from governments, [[non-governmental organization|NGOs]], international agencies and citizen activists participated.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 5–6"/&gt; The ICPD did not address the far-reaching implications of the [[Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS|HIV/AIDS epidemic]]. In 1999, recommendations at the ICPD+5 were expanded to include commitment to AIDS education, research, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission, as well as to the development of vaccines and microbicides.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 7"&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cairo Programme of Action was adopted by 184 UN member states. Nevertheless, many Latin American and Islamic states made [[Reservation (law)|formal reservations]] to the programme, in particular, to its concept of reproductive rights and sexual freedom, to its treatment of abortion, and to its potential incompatibility with [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/popin/icpd/conference/offeng/poa.html|title=A/CONF.171/13: Report of the ICPD (94/10/18) (385k)|website=Un.org|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Implementation of the Cairo Programme of Action varies considerably from country to country. In many countries, post-ICPD tensions emerged as the [[human rights]]-based approach was implemented. Since the ICPD, many countries have broadened their reproductive health programs and attempted to integrate maternal and child health services with family planning. More attention is paid to adolescent health and the consequences of unsafe abortion. Lara Knudsen observes that the ICPD succeeded in getting [[feminist]] language into governments' and population agencies' literature, but in many countries the underlying concepts are not widely put into practice.&lt;ref name="Knudsen 2006 7"/&gt; In two preparatory meetings for the ICPD+10 in Asia and Latin America, the United States, under the George W. Bush Administration, was the only nation opposing the ICPD's Programme of Action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |page=9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beijing Platform===
The 1995 [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in Beijing, in its [[non-binding resolution|non-binding]] [[Beijing Declaration|Declaration]] and [[Beijing Platform for Action|Platform for Action]], supported the Cairo Programme's definition of reproductive health, but established a broader context of reproductive rights:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The human rights of women include their right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. Equal relationships between women and men in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for the integrity of the person, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behavior and its consequences [para. 96].&lt;ref name="COOK"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The Beijing Platform demarcated twelve interrelated critical areas of the human rights of women that require advocacy. The Platform framed women's reproductive rights as "indivisible, universal and inalienable human rights."&lt;ref name="BUNCH"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/495143 |jstor=3175048 |title=Beijing '95: Moving Women's Human Rights from Margin to Center |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=200–4 |year=1996 |last1=Bunch |first1=Charlotte |last2=Fried |first2=Susana }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to reproductive health, Principle 9 on "The Right to Treatment with Humanity while in Detention" requires that "States shall... &lt;nowiki&gt;[p]rovide&lt;/nowiki&gt; adequate access to medical care and counseling appropriate to the needs of those in custody, recognizing any particular needs of persons on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity, including with regard to reproductive health, access to [[HIV/AIDS]] information and therapy and access to [[hormone therapy|hormonal]] or other therapy as well as to [[sex reassignment therapy|gender-reassignment treatments]] where desired."&lt;ref&gt;"The Yogyakarta Principles" Preamble and Principle 9. The Rights to Treatment with Humanity While in Detention&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, African, Caribbean and Islamic Countries, as well as the [[Russian Federation]], have objected to the use of these principles as Human Rights standards.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly, Official Records, Third Committee, [http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N09/576/53/PDF/N0957653.pdf?OpenElement Summary record of the 29th meeting held in New York, on Monday, 25 October 2010, at 3 p.m] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927135721/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N09/576/53/PDF/N0957653.pdf?OpenElement |date=27 September 2012 }}. For instance, [[Malawi]], speaking on behalf of all African States, argued that the Yogyakarta Principles were "controversial and unrecognized," while the representative of the Russian Federation said that they "had not been agreed to at the intergovernmental level, and which therefore could not be considered as authoritative expressions of the opinion of the international community" (para. 9, 23).&lt;/ref&gt;

===State abuses===
State abuses against reproductive rights have happened both under right-wing and left-wing governments. Such abuses include attempts to forcefully increase the birth rate - one of the most notorious [[natalist]] policies of the 20th century was that which occurred in [[communist Romania]] in the period of 1967-1990 during communist leader [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], who adopted a very aggressive natalist policy which included outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, [[Tax on childlessness|taxes on childlessness]], and legal discrimination against childless people - as well as attempts to decrease the fertility rate - [[China]]'s [[one child policy]] (1978-2015). State mandated [[forced marriage]] was also practiced by authoritarian governments as a way to meet population targets: the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in [[Cambodia]] systematically forced people into marriages, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.dccam.org/Abouts/Intern/Natalae_Forced_marriage.pdf |format=PDF|author=Natalae Anderson|title=Memorandum: Charging Forced Marriage as a Crime Against Humanity|date=September 22, 2010|website=D.dccam.org|accessdate=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some governments have implemented [[eugenic]] policies of [[forced sterilizations]] of 'undesirable' population groups. Such policies were carried out against ethnic minorities in Europe and North America in the 20th century, and more recently in Latin America against the Indigenous population in the 1990s; in [[Peru]], President [[Alberto Fujimori]] (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] as a result of a sterilization program put in place by his administration targeting indigenous people (mainly the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2148793.stm|title=BBC NEWS - World - Americas - Mass sterilisation scandal shocks Peru|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2017-08-19|date=2002-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Human rights}}
Since most existing legally binding [[international human rights instruments]] do not explicitly mention sexual and reproductive rights, a [[Epistemic community (international relations)|broad coalition]] of NGOs, civil servants, and experts working in [[international organizations]] have been promoting a reinterpretation of those instruments to link the realization of the already internationally recognized human rights with the realization of reproductive rights.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/human-rights-defenders/issues/challenges/srr-defenders Defenders of Sexual and Reproductive Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002004052/http://www.amnesty.org/en/human-rights-defenders/issues/challenges/srr-defenders |date=2013-10-02 }}; [http://www.iwhc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3326&amp;Itemid=548 International Women’s Health Coalition and the United Nations],  [http://www.iwhc.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=205&amp;Itemid=110 Campaign for an Inter-American Convention on Sexual and Reproductive Rights ], Women's Health Collection, [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/_/print/PrintArticle.aspx?id=105915323 Abortion as a human right: possible strategies in unexplored territory.

In this regard, the Center for Reproductive Rights has noted that: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Our goal is to ensure that governments worldwide guarantee women's reproductive rights out of an understanding that they are bound to do so. The two principal prerequisites for achieving this goal are: (1) the strengthening of international legal norms protecting reproductive rights; and (2) consistent and effective action on the part of civil society and the international community to enforce these norms. Each of these conditions, in turn, depends upon profound social change at the local, national and international (including regional) levels. (...) Ultimately, we must persuade governments to accept reproductive rights as binding norms. Again, our approach can move forward on several fronts, with interventions both at the national and international levels. Governments' recognition of reproductive rights norms may be indicated by their support for progressive language in international conference documents or by their adoption and implementation of appropriate national-level legislative and policy instruments. In order to counter opposition to an expansion of recognized reproductive rights norms, we have questioned the credibility of such reactionary yet influential international actors as the United States and the Holy See. Our activities to garner support for international protections of reproductive rights include: Lobbying government delegations at UN conferences and producing supporting analyses/materials; fostering alliances with members of civil society who may become influential on their national delegations to the UN; and preparing briefing papers and factsheets exposing the broad anti-woman agenda of our opposition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Center for Reproductive Rights, International Legal Program, [http://thomas.loc.gov  Establishing International Reproductive Rights Norms: Theory for Change], US CONG. REC. 108th CONG. 1 Sess. E2534 E2547 (Rep. Smith) (Dec. 8, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this linkage is provided by the 1994 Cairo Programme of Action: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Reproductive rights embrace certain human rights that are already recognized in national laws, international human rights documents and other relevant United Nations consensus documents. These rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. It also includes the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence as expressed in human rights documents. In the exercise of this right, they should take into account the needs of their living and future children and their responsibilities towards the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iisd.ca/Cairo/program/p07002.html |title=[programme&amp;#93; Basis for action |publisher=Iisd.ca |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Similarly, [[Amnesty International]] has argued that the realisation of reproductive rights is linked with the realisation of a series of recognised [[human rights]], including the [[right to health]], the right to freedom from [[discrimination]], the [[right to privacy]], and the right not to be subjected to torture or ill-treatment.&lt;ref name="AMNESTY"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/Stop_Violence_Against_Women_SVAW/Reproductive_Rights/page.do?id=1108242&amp;n1=3&amp;n2=39&amp;n3=1101 |title=Stop Violence Against Women: Reproductive rights |accessdate=2007-12-08 |author=Amnesty International USA |year=2007 |work=SVAW |publisher=Amnesty International USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120140923/http://www.amnestyusa.org/Stop_Violence_Against_Women_SVAW/Reproductive_Rights/page.do?id=1108242&amp;n1=3&amp;n2=39&amp;n3=1101 |archivedate=2008-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[World Health Organization]] states that:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/gender_rights/srh-rights-comment/en/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; "Sexual and reproductive health and rights encompass efforts to eliminate preventable maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity, to ensure quality sexual and reproductive health services, including contraceptive services, and to address sexually transmitted infections (STI) and cervical cancer, violence against women and girls, and sexual and reproductive health needs of adolescents. Universal access to sexual and reproductive health is essential not only to achieve sustainable development but also to ensure that this new framework speaks to the needs and aspirations of people around the world and leads to realisation of their health and human rights."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, not all states have accepted the inclusion of reproductive rights in the body of internationally recognized human rights. At the Cairo Conference, several states made [[Reservation (law)|formal reservations]] either to the concept of reproductive rights or to its specific content.  [[Ecuador]], for instance, stated that: &lt;blockquote&gt;
With regard to the Programme of Action of the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development and in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and laws of Ecuador and the norms of international law, the delegation of Ecuador reaffirms, inter alia, the following principles embodied in its Constitution:  the inviolability of life, the protection of children from the moment of conception, freedom of conscience and religion, the protection of the family as the fundamental unit of society, responsible paternity, the right of parents to bring up their children and the formulation of population and development plans by the Government in accordance with the principles of respect for sovereignty. Accordingly, the delegation of Ecuador enters a reservation with respect to all terms such as "regulation of fertility", "interruption of pregnancy", "reproductive health", "reproductive rights" and "unwanted children", which in one way or another, within the context of the Programme of Action, could involve abortion.&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Similar reservations were made by [[Argentina]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Malta]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]] and the [[Holy See]]. Islamic Countries, such as [[Brunei]], [[Djibouti]], [[Iran]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Libya]], [[Syria]], [[United Arab Emirates]], and [[Yemen]] made broad reservations against any element of the programme that could be interpreted as contrary to the [[Sharia]]. Guatemala even questioned whether the conference could legally proclaim new human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/popin/icpd/conference/offeng/poa.html United Nations, Report of the Fourth International Conference on Population and Development, Cario, 5 - 13 September 1994]. Guatemala entered the following reservation:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chapter VII:  we enter a reservation on the whole chapter, for the General Assembly's mandate to the Conference does not extend to the creation or formulation of rights; this reservation therefore applies to all references in the document to "reproductive rights", "sexual rights", "reproductive health", "fertility regulation", "sexual health", "individuals", "sexual education and services for minors", "abortion in all its forms", "distribution of contraceptives" and "safe motherhood"&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's rights==
{{see also|Women’s rights|Reproductive justice}}
{{Feminism sidebar}}
The [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) advocate for reproductive rights with a primary emphasis on [[women's rights]]. In this respect the UN and WHO focus on a range of issues from access to [[family planning]] services, sex education, [[menopause]], and the reduction of [[obstetric fistula]], to the relationship between reproductive health and economic status.

The reproductive rights of women are advanced in the context of the right to freedom from [[discrimination]] and the social and economic status of women. The group Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era (DAWN) explained the link in the following statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Control over reproduction is a basic need and a basic right for all women. Linked as it is to women's health and social status, as well as the powerful social structures of religion, state control and administrative inertia, and private profit, it is from the perspective of poor women that this right can best be understood and affirmed. Women know that childbearing is a social, not a purely personal, phenomenon; nor do we deny that world population trends are likely to exert considerable pressure on resources and institutions by the end of this century. But our bodies have become a pawn in the struggles among states, religions, male heads of households, and private corporations. Programs that do not take the interests of women into account are unlikely to succeed...&lt;ref name="FREEDMAN"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Women's reproductive rights have long retained key issue status in the debate on [[overpopulation]].&lt;ref name=popsearch/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The only ray of hope I can see – and it's not much – is that wherever women are put in control of their lives, both politically and socially; where medical facilities allow them to deal with birth control and where their husbands allow them to make those decisions, birth rate falls. Women don't want to have 12 kids of whom nine will die."

According to [[OHCHR]]: "Women’s sexual and reproductive health is related to multiple human rights, including the right to life, the right to be free from torture, the right to health, the right to privacy, the right to education, and the prohibition of discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/women/wrgs/pages/healthrights.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts have been made to analyse the socioeconomic conditions that affect the realisation of a woman's reproductive rights. The term [[reproductive justice]] has been used to describe these broader social and economic issues. Proponents of reproductive justice argue that while the right to [[abortion law|legalized abortion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/library/etext/gov/bl_roe_e.htm|title=Women's History|website=Womenshistory.about.com|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contraception applies to everyone, these choices are only meaningful to those with resources, and that there is a growing gap between access and affordability.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, Okazawa-Rey 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Men's rights==

{{Masculism sidebar}}
Men's reproductive rights have been claimed by various organizations, both for issues of reproductive health, and other rights related to sexual reproduction.

Three international issues in men's reproductive health are [[sexually transmitted disease]]s, cancer and exposure to [[toxins]].&lt;ref name = "NETWORK"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.fhi.org/en/RH/Pubs/Network/v18_3/NW183ch2.htm |title=Men's Reproductive Health Risks: Threats to men's fertility and reproductive health include disease, cancer and exposure to toxins |accessdate=2008-01-02 |last1=Best |first1=Kim |date=Spring 1998 |journal=Network |pages=7–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently men's reproductive right with regards to paternity have become subject of debate in the U.S.  The term "[[male abortion]]" was coined by Melanie McCulley, a South Carolina attorney, in a 1998 article.  The theory begins with the premise that when a woman becomes pregnant she has the option of abortion, adoption, or parenthood; it argues, in the context of legally recognized [[gender equality]], that in the earliest stages of pregnancy the putative (alleged) father should have the right to relinquish all future parental rights and financial responsibility, leaving the informed mother with the same three options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McCulley Melanie G | year = 1998 | title = The male abortion: the putative father's right to terminate his interests in and obligations to the unborn child | url = | journal = The Journal of Law and Policy | volume = VII | issue =1 | pages =1–55 |pmid=12666677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been supported by a former president of the feminist organization [[National Organization for Women]], attorney [[Karen DeCrow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/life/feature/2000/10/19/mens_choice|title=A man's right to choose|last1=Young|first1=Kathy|date=Oct 19, 2000|publisher=Salon.com|accessdate= May 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[feminist]] argument for male reproductive choice contends that the uneven ability to choose experienced by men and women in regards to parenthood is evidence of a state-enforced [[coercion]] favoring traditional [[sex roles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Lisa Lucile |last1=Owens |year=2013 |title=Coerced Parenthood as Family Policy: Feminism, the Moral Agency of Women, and Men's 'Right to Choose' |journal=Alabama Civil Rights &amp; Civil Liberties Law Review |volume=5 |pages=1–33 |ssrn=2439294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the National Center for Men brought a case in the US, ''[[Dubay v. Wells]]'' (dubbed by some "''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' for men"), that argued that in the event of an unplanned pregnancy, when an unmarried woman informs a man that she is pregnant by him, he should have an opportunity to give up all paternity rights and responsibilities.  Supporters argue that this would allow the woman time to make an informed decision and give men the same reproductive rights as women.&lt;ref&gt;Traister, Rebecca. (March 13, 2006).

==Intersex and reproductive rights==

Intersex, in [[human]]s and other [[animal]]s, is a variation in [[sex]] characteristics including [[chromosome]]s, [[gonad]]s, or [[genital]]s that do not allow an individual to be distinctly identified as male or female. Such variation may involve genital ambiguity, and combinations of chromosomal [[genotype]] and sexual [[phenotype]] other than XY-male and XX-female.&lt;ref name="Money"&gt;{{cite book|last=Money |first=John |author2=Ehrhardt, Anke A. |title=Man &amp; Woman Boy &amp; Girl.

UN agencies have begun to take note. On 1 February 2013, Juan E Mendés, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, issued a statement condemning non-consensual surgical intervention on intersex people. His report stated, "Children who are born with atypical sex characteristics are often subject to irreversible sex assignment, involuntary sterilization, involuntary genital normalizing surgery, performed without their informed consent, or that of their parents, "in an attempt to fix their sex", leaving them with permanent, irreversible infertility and causing severe mental suffering".&lt;ref name="untorture"&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A.HRC.22.53_English.pdf Report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture], [[Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]], February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, the [[World Health Organization]] issued a joint statement on ''Eliminating forced, coercive and otherwise involuntary sterilization, An interagency statement'' with the [[OHCHR]], [[UN Women]], [[UNAIDS]], [[UNDP]], [[UNFPA]] and [[UNICEF]].

===Minors===
{{See|Parental consent}}
In many jurisdictions minors require parental consent or parental notification in order to access various reproductive services, such as contraception, abortion, gynecological consultations,  testing for STDs etc. The requirement that minors have parental consent/notification for testing for [[HIV/AIDS]] is especially controversial, particularly in areas where the disease is endemic, and it is a sensitive subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/adolescent/hiv-testing-treatment/page/Informed_consent_and_HIV_testing|title=World Health Organization - HIV and Adolescents from Guidance to Action|first=World Health|last=Organization|website=apps.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/696753/doh-backs-bill-allowing-minor-to-get-hiv-aids-tests-without-parental-consent|title=DOH backs bill allowing minor to get HIV, AIDS tests without parental consent|first=Jocelyn R.|last=Uy|website=Newsinfo.inquirer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2014/july/20140723_youth|title=Challenging parental consent laws to increase young people's access to vital HIV services - UNAIDS|website=Unaids.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balancing minors' rights versus parental rights is considered an [[ethical]] problem in medicine and law, and there have been many court cases on this issue in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/456472_6|title=Medscape Log In|website=Medscape.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important concept recognized since 1989 by the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] is that of the [[evolving capacities|
evolving capacities of a minor]], namely that minors should, in accordance with their maturity and level of understanding, be involved in decisions that affect them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ippfwhr.org/sites/default/files/srrightsyoungen.pdf|title=Sexual and Reproductive Rights of Young People: Autonomous decision making and confidential services|work=International Planned Parenthood Federation|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Youth]] are often denied equal access to reproductive health services because [[health workers]] view adolescent sexual activity as unacceptable,&lt;ref name=Mugisha&gt;{{cite book |last=Mugisha|first=Frederick |editor-first=Andy|editor-last=Furlong|title=Handbook of Youth and Young Adulthood |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |pages=344–352 |chapter=Chapter 42: HIV and AIDS, STIs and sexual health among young people |isbn=978-0-415-44541-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or see sex education as the responsibility of parents.  Providers of reproductive health have little accountability to youth clients, a primary factor in denying youth access to reproductive health care.&lt;ref name=Mugisha /&gt; In many countries, regardless of legislation, minors are denied even the most basic reproductive care, if they are not accompanied by parents: in India, for instance, in 2017, a 17-year-old girl who was rejected by her family due to her pregnancy, was also rejected by hospitals and gave birth in the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/india-chandil-homeless-street-jharkand-medical-centre-a7918611.html|title=Homeless girl in India forced to give birth on street metres away from health centre: She was shivering and unable to lift and cuddle her infant|date=August 29, 2017|first=Andrew|last=Lowry|work=The Independent|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years the lack of reproductive rights for adolescents has been a concern of international organizations, such as [[UNFPA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/resources/adolescent-sexual-and-reproductive-health|title=Adolescent sexual and reproductive health - UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|website=Unfpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandatory involvement of parents in cases where the minor has sufficient maturity to understand their situation is considered by health organization as a violation of minor's rights and detrimental to their health. The [[World Health Organization]] has criticized parental consent/notification laws:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Discrimination in health care settings takes many forms and is often manifested when an individual or group is denied access to health care services that are otherwise available to others. It can also occur through denial of services that are only needed by certain groups, such as women. Examples include specific individuals or groups being subjected to physical and verbal abuse or violence; involuntary treatment; '''breaches of confidentiality and/or denial of autonomous decision-making, such as the requirement of consent to treatment by parents, spouses or guardians'''; and lack of free and informed consent. [...] Laws and policies must respect the principles of autonomy in health care decision-making; guarantee free and informed consent, privacy and confidentiality; prohibit mandatory HIV testing; prohibit screening procedures that are not of benefit to the individual or the public; and ban involuntary treatment and '''mandatory third-party authorization and notification requirements'''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2017/discrimination-in-health-care/en/|title=Joint United Nations statement on ending discrimination in health care settings — Joint WHO/UN statement|work=World Health Organization|date=June 27, 2017|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to UNICEF: "When dealing with sexual and reproductive health, the obligation
to inform parents and obtain their consent becomes a significant barrier with consequences for adolescents’ lives and for public health in general."&lt;ref name="UnicefBAJA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/lac/1._DIG._Min_age_of_medical_consent_PDF_BAJA_.pdf|title=Legal minimum ages and the realization of adolescents' rights|website=Unicef|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One specific issue which is seen as a form of hypocrisy of legislators is that of having a higher age of medical consent for the purpose of reproductive and sexual health than the [[age of sexual consent]] - in such cases the law allows youth to engage in sexual activity, but does not allow them to consent to medical procedures that may arise from being sexually active; UNICEF states that "On sexual and reproductive health matters, the minimum age of medical consent should never be higher than the age of sexual consent."&lt;ref name="UnicefBAJA" /&gt;

[[File:No Sex Signage in Ghana.jpg|thumb|Ad promoting abstinence in [[Ghana]]: ''No Sex Ad'' (Anti-[[HIV/AIDS]] ― [[signage]]). [[Abstinence-only sex education]] is a form of [[sex education]] that teaches [[Sexual abstinence|not having sex]] outside of marriage, most often excluding other types of [[sexual and reproductive health]] education, such as [[birth control]] and [[safe sex]]. [[Comprehensive Sex Education|Comprehensive sex education]], by contrast, covers the use of birth control and sexual abstinence.]]

Many [[unintended pregnancies]] stem from traditional contraceptive methods or no [[contraceptive]] measures.&lt;ref name=Lukale&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lukale|first=Nelly|title=Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights for Young People in Africa|journal=ARROWs for Change|year=2012|volume=18|issue=2|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth sexual education in Uganda is relatively low.  [[Comprehensive sex education]] is not generally taught in schools; even if it was, the majority of young people do not stay in school after the age of fifteen, so information would be limited regardless.&lt;ref name=Knudson&gt;{{cite book|last=Knudson|first=Lara|title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context: South Africa, Uganda, Peru, Denmark, United States, Vietnam, Jordan|year=2006|publisher=Vanderbilt University Press|location=Nashville, TN}}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Africa]] experiences high rates of unintended pregnancy, along with high rates of [[HIV/AIDS]].  Young women aged 15–24 are eight times more likely to have HIV/AIDS than young men. [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] is the world region most affected by HIV/AIDS, with approximately 25 million people living with HIV in 2015. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for two-thirds of the global total of new HIV infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/hivaids|title=HIV/AIDS Factsheet|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempted [[abortions]] and [[unsafe abortions]] are a risk for youth in Africa.  On average, there are 2.4 million unsafe abortions in East Africa, 1.8 million in Western Africa, over 900,000 in Middle Africa, and over 100,000 in Southern Africa each year.&lt;ref name=Lukale /&gt;

In [[Uganda]], abortion is illegal except to save the mother's life.  However, 78% of teenagers report knowing someone who has had an abortion and the police do not always prosecute everyone who has an abortion.  An estimated 22% of all [[maternal deaths]] in the area stem from illegal, unsafe abortions.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;

===European Union===
Over 85% of European women (all ages) have used some form of [[birth control]] in their lives.&lt;ref name=Irala /&gt;  Europeans as an aggregate report using [[Oral contraceptive pill|the pill]] and [[condoms]] as the most commonly used contraceptives.&lt;ref name=Irala&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2011.04.004 |pmid=22078183 |title=Choice of birth control methods among European women and the role of partners and providers |journal=Contraception |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=558–64 |year=2011 |last1=De Irala |first1=Jokin |last2=Osorio |first2=Alfonso |last3=Carlos |first3=Silvia |last4=Lopez-Del Burgo |first4=Cristina |hdl=10171/19110 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Views on sexual practice vary throughout the region.  For example, in the [[United Kingdom]] (UK), sex among youth is generally looked down upon and seen as a problem in need of solution.  In the [[Netherlands]], sex between youth is viewed as normal and therefore not discussed in terms of solutions, but rather in terms of ensuring safe practices.  That being said, the UK tends to focus on stopping sexual behavior, while the Netherlands focuses on building self-esteem and healthy relationships.&lt;ref name=Ketting /&gt;

===Latin America===
{{Main|Reproductive rights in Latin America}}
[[Latin America]] has come to international attention due to its harsh anti-abortion laws.

In 2017, [[Abortion in Chile|Chile]] relaxed its total ban, allowing abortion to be performed when the woman’s life is in danger, when a fetus is unviable, or in cases of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/chile-the-long-road-to-abortion-reform-a7917791.html|title=Chile: the long road to abortion reform — After a fierce debate, one of the most restrictive reproductive laws in the world has been eased|date=August 29, 2017|first=Cordelia|last=Freeman |work=The Independent|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ecuador]], education and class play a large role in the definition of which young women become pregnant and which do not - 50% of young women who are illiterate get pregnant, compared to 11% of girls with secondary education.  The same is true for poorer individuals - 28% become impregnated while only 11% of young women in wealthier households do.  Furthermore, access to reproductive rights, including contraceptives, are limited, due to age and the perception of female morality.  Health care providers often discuss contraception theoretically, not as a device to be used on a regular basis.  Decisions concerning sexual activity often involve secrecy and taboos, as well as a lack of access to accurate information.  Even more telling, young women have much easier access to maternal healthcare than they do to contraceptive help, which helps explain high pregnancy rates in the region.&lt;ref name=Goicolea&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goicolea|first=Isabel|title=Adolescent Pregnancies in the Amazon Basin of Ecuador: A Rights and Gender Approach to Adolescents' Sexual and Reproductive Health|journal=Global Health Action|year=2010|volume=3|pages=1–11|doi=10.3402/gha.v3i0.5280|pmid=20596248|pmc=2893010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young people in the U.S. are no more sexually active than individuals in other developed countries, but they are significantly less knowledgeable about contraception and safe sex practices.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt; As of 2006, only twenty states required [[sex education]] in schools - of these, only ten required information about contraception.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;  On the whole, less than 10% of American students receive sex education that includes topical coverage of [[abortion]], [[homosexuality]], [[Intimate relationships|relationships]], [[pregnancy]], and STI prevention.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;  [[Abstinence-only education]] was used throughout much of the United States in the 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;  Based upon the moral principle that sex outside of marriage is unacceptable, the programs often misled students about their rights to have sex, the consequences, and prevention of pregnancy and STIs.&lt;ref name=Knudson /&gt;

[[Abortion in the United States]] is legal since the [[United States Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' which decriminalised abortion nationwide in 1973, and established a minimal period during which abortion is legal (with more or fewer restrictions throughout the pregnancy). That basic framework, modified in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992), remains nominally in place, although the effective availability of abortion varies significantly from state to state, as many counties have no abortion providers.&lt;ref name="Doan3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Opposition and Intimidation: The Abortion Wars and Strategies of Political Harassment|date=2007|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472069750|page=57|author1=Alesha Doan}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'' held that a law cannot place legal restrictions imposing an [[Undue burden standard|undue burden]] for "the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus."&lt;ref&gt;Casey, 505 U.S. at 877.&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion is a controversial political issue, and regular attempts to restrict it occur in most states. One such case, originating in [[Texas]], led to the Supreme Court case of ''[[Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt]]'' (2016) in which several Texas restrictions were struck down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36641063|title=Strict Texas abortion law struck down|date=27 June 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lack of knowledge about rights==
One of the reasons why reproductive rights are poor in many places, is that the vast majority of the population does not know what the law is. Not only are ordinary people uninformed, but so are medical doctors. A study in Brazil on medical doctors found considerable ignorance and misunderstanding of the law on abortion (which is severely restricted, but not completely illegal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Brazilian obstetrician-gynecologists and abortion: a survey of knowledge, opinions and practices|first1=Lisa A.|last1=Goldman|first2=Sandra G.|last2=García|first3=Juan|last3=Díaz|first4=Eileen A.|last4=Yam|date=15 November 2005|journal=Reproductive Health|volume=2|pages=10|doi=10.1186/1742-4755-2-10|pmid=16288647|pmc=1308861}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ghana, abortion, while restricted, is permitted on several grounds, but only 3% of pregnant women and 6% of those seeking an abortion were aware of the legal status of abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/abortion-ghana|title=Abortion in Ghana|date=24 February 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Nepal, abortion was legalized in 2002, but a study in 2009 found that only half of women knew that abortion was legalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2006/09/nepal-only-half-of-women-know-abortion-is-legal/|title=NEPAL: Only Half of Women Know Abortion is Legal - Inter Press Service|website=www.ipsnews.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people also do not understand the laws on [[sexual violence]]: in Hungary, where [[marital rape]] was made illegal in 1997, in a study in 2006, 62% of people did not know that marital rape was a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur27/002/2007/en/|title=Wayback Machine|date=8 June 2011|publisher=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Development Programme states that, in order to advance gender justice, "Women must know their rights and be able to access legal systems",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/crisis%20prevention/undp-cpr-8-point-agenda-practical-positive-outcomes-girls-women-crisis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1993 UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women states at Art. 4 (d) [...] "States should also inform women of their rights in seeking redress through such mechanisms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm|title=A/RES/48/104 - Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women - UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|first=United Nations General|last=Assembly|website=www.un-documents.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender equality and violence against women==
{{Further|Gender equality|Violence against women|Sexual violence|Forced marriage|Child marriage}}
Addressing issues of gender-based violence is crucial for attaining reproductive rights. The [[United Nations Population Fund]] refers to "'''''Equality and equity for men and women''', to enable individuals to make free and informed choices in all spheres of life, free from discrimination based on gender''" and "''Sexual and reproductive security, '''including freedom from sexual violence and coercion''', and the right to privacy,''" as part of achieving reproductive rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/rights/rights.htm |title=United Nations Population Fund &amp;#124; Supporting the Constellation of Reproductive Rights |publisher=UNFPA |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and states that the '''right to liberty and security of the person''' which is fundamental to reproductive rights obliges states to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/2005/english/ch3/ch3_box9.htm |title=United Nations Population Fund &amp;#124; State of World Population 2005 |publisher=UNFPA |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Take measures to prevent, punish and eradicate all forms of gender-based violence
* Eliminate female genital mutilation/cutting

The WHO states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hhr/activities/GRR/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Gender and Reproductive Rights |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Gender and Reproductive Rights (GRR) aims to promote and protect human rights and gender equality as they relate to sexual and reproductive health by developing strategies and mechanisms for promoting gender equity and equality and human rights in the Departments global and national activities, as well as within the functioning and priority-setting of the Department itself."

Amnesty International writes that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/campaigns/stop-violence-against-women/issues/implementation-existing-laws/srr |title=Sexual and reproductive rights &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date=2007-11-06 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Violence against women violates women's rights to life, physical and mental integrity, to the highest attainable standard of health, to freedom from torture and it violates their sexual and reproductive rights."

One key issue for achieving reproductive rights is criminalization of [[sexual violence]]. If a woman is not protected from forced sexual intercourse, she is not protected from [[forced pregnancy]], namely [[pregnancy from rape]]. In order for a woman to be able to have reproductive rights, she must have the right to choose with whom and when to reproduce; and first of all, decide whether, when, and under what circumstances to be sexually active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/gender_rights/sexual_health/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Gender and human rights |publisher=Who.int |date=2002-01-31 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, these rights of women are not respected, because women do not have a choice in regard to their partner, with [[forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]] being common in parts of the world; and neither do they have any rights in regard to sexual activity, as many countries do not allow women to refuse to engage in sexual intercourse when they do not want to (because [[marital rape]] is not criminalized in those countries) or to engage in consensual sexual intercourse if they want to (because sex outside marriage is illegal in those countries). In addition to legal barriers, there are also social barriers, because in many countries a complete sexual subordination of a woman to her husband is expected (for instance, in one survey 74% of women in Mali said that a husband is justified to beat his wife if she refuses to have sex with him&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioline.org.br/request?rh04047 |title=Bioline International Official Site (site up-dated regularly) |publisher=Bioline.org.br |date=2015-02-09 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;), while sexual/romantic relations disapproved by family members, or generally sex outside marriage, can result in serious violence, such as [[honor killings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/ |title=Ethics: Honour Crimes |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the CDC, "HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It weakens a person’s immune system by destroying important cells that fight disease and infection. No effective cure exists for HIV. But with proper medical care, HIV can be controlled."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/index.html|title=HIV Basics {{!}} HIV/AIDS {{!}} CDC|website=Cdc.gov|access-date=2016-10-05|date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HIV amelioration is an important aspect of reproductive rights because the virus can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy or birth, or via breast milk.

The WHO states that: "All women, including those with HIV, have the right “to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children and to have access to the information, education and means to enable them to exercise these rights”".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/87/11/08-059360/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Reproductive choices for women with HIV |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reproductive rights of people living with HIV, and their health, are very important. The link between HIV and reproductive rights exists in regard to four main issues:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* prevention of unwanted pregnancy
* help to plan wanted pregnancy
* healthcare during and after pregnancy
* access to abortion services

==Child and forced marriage==
{{Main|Child marriage|Forced marriage}}
The WHO states that the reproductive rights and health of girls in child marriages are negatively affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/sexual-and-reproductive-health/news/news/2012/12/child-marriage-a-threat-to-health|title=Child marriage – a threat to health|date=20 December 2012|website=www.euro.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[United Nations Population Fund|UNPF]] calls child marriage a "human rights violation" and states that in developing countries, one in every three girls is married before reaching age 18, and one in nine is married under age 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/child-marriage|title=Child marriage - UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|website=www.unfpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[forced marriage]] is a marriage in which one or more of the parties is married without his or her consent or against his or her will. The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul convention]], the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of violence against women and domestic violence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oas.org/es/mesecvi/docs/CSW-SideEvent2014-Flyer-EN.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Convention of Belem do Para and the Istanbul Convention : A response to violence against women worldwide |publisher=Oas.org |accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires countries which ratify it to prohibit [[forced marriage]] (Article 37) and to ensure that forced marriages can be easily voided without further victimization (Article 32).&lt;ref&gt;https://rm.coe.int/168046031c&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual violence in armed conflict==
{{Main|Wartime sexual violence|Pregnancy from rape}}
Sexual violence in armed conflict is [[sexual violence]] committed by [[combatant]]s during [[armed conflict]], war, or [[military occupation]] often as [[War looting|spoils of war]]; but sometimes, particularly in [[ethnic conflict]], the phenomenon has broader sociological motives. It often includes [[gang rape]]. Rape is often used as a tactic of war and a threat to international security.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/rapeweaponwar.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence in armed conflict is a violation of reproductive rights, and often leads to [[forced pregnancy]]  and [[sexually transmitted infections]]. Such sexual violations affect mostly women and girls,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00981389.2016.1240134?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=wshc20&lt;/ref&gt; but [[rape of men]] can also occur, such as in [[ Democratic Republic of the Congo]].&lt;ref name=Melhado&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melhado|first=L|title=Rates of Sexual Violence Are High in Democratic Republic of the Congo|journal=International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|volume=36|number=4|year=2010|p=210|jstor=41038670}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Autesserre&gt;{{cite journal|last=Autesserre|first=Séverine|title=Dangerous Tales: Dominant Narratives on the Congo and their Unintended Consequences|journal=African Affairs|volume=111|issue=443|year=2012|pages=202–222|doi=10.1093/afraf/adr080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
===Birth control===
{{See|Forced pregnancy}}
[[Birth control]], also known as contraception and fertility control, is a method or device used to prevent [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Birth control|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=53351|work=MedicineNet|accessdate=August 9, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806234913/http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=53351|archivedate=August 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birth control has been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods of birth control only became available in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Hopkins2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanson|first1=S.J.|last2=Burke|first2=Anne E.|date=December 21, 2010|chapter=Fertility control: contraception, sterilization, and abortion|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Sg5sXyiBvkC&amp;pg=PR232|editor1-last=Hurt|editor1-first=K.

All birth control methods meet opposition, especially [[religion|religious]] opposition, in some parts of the world. Opposition does not only target modern methods, but also 'traditional' ones : for example, the [[Quiverfull]] movement, a conservative Christian ideology, encourages the maximization of procreation, and opposes all forms of birth control, including [[natural family planning]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenation.com/article/arrows-war/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/protestant-group-advocates-leaving-fertility-in-gods-hands-no-birth-control&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abortion===
{{Further|Abortion law}}
According to a study by WHO and the Guttmacher Institute worldwide, 25 million [[unsafe abortion]]s (45% of all abortions) occurred every year between 2010 and 2014. 97% of unsafe abortions occur in developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. By contrast, most abortions that take place in Western and Northern Europe and North America are safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/unsafe-abortions-worldwide/en/|title=Worldwide, an estimated 25 million unsafe abortions occur each year|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] considers the criminalization of abortion a "violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights" and a form of "gender based violence"; paragraph 18 of its ''General recommendation No. 35 on gender based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19'' states that: "Violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights, such as forced sterilizations, forced abortion, forced pregnancy, criminalisation of abortion, denial or delay of  safe  abortion  and  post abortion  care,  forced  continuation  of pregnancy,  abuse  and mistreatment  of  women  and  girls  seeking  sexual  and  reproductive  health  information, goods and services, are forms of [[violence against women|gender based violence]] that, depending on   the circumstances, may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment."&lt;ref name="tbinternet.ohchr.org"&gt;http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/1_Global/CEDAW_C_GC_35_8267_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The same ''General Recommendation'' also urges countries at paragraph 31 to [...] In particular, repeal:
a) Provisions  that  allow,  tolerate  or  condone  forms  of  gender based  violence against women, including [...] legislation  that  criminalises  abortion".&lt;ref name="tbinternet.ohchr.org"/&gt;

An article from the World Health Organization calls safe, legal abortion a "[[fundamental right]] of women, irrespective of where they live" and [[unsafe abortion]] a "silent [[pandemic]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/unsafe_abortion/ua_paper/en/index.html|title=WHO: Unsafe Abortion - The Preventable Pandemic|accessdate=2010-01-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113104553/http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/unsafe_abortion/ua_paper/en/index.html|archivedate=2010-01-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article states "ending the silent pandemic of unsafe abortion is an urgent [[public health|public-health]] and [[human-rights]] imperative." It also states "access to safe abortion improves [[women’s health]], and vice versa, as documented in [[Romania]] during the regime of President [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]" and "legalisation of abortion on request is a necessary but insufficient step toward improving women’s health" citing that in some countries, such as India where abortion has been legal for decades, access to competent care remains restricted because of other barriers. WHO’s Global Strategy on Reproductive Health, adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2004, noted: “As a preventable cause of maternal mortality and morbidity, unsafe abortion must be dealt with as part of the MDG on improving maternal health and other international development goals and targets." &lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/unsafe_abortion/hrpwork/en/index.html |title=WHO &amp;#124; Preventing unsafe abortion |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO's Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), whose research concerns people's sexual and reproductive health and lives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hrp/en/ |title=HRP &amp;#124; World Health Organization |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; has an overall strategy to combat unsafe abortion that comprises four inter-related activities:&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;
* to collate, synthesize and generate scientifically sound evidence on unsafe abortion prevalence and practices;
* to develop improved technologies and implement interventions to make abortion safer;
* to translate evidence into norms, tools and guidelines;
* and to assist in the development of programmes and policies that reduce unsafe abortion and improve access to safe abortion and highquality postabortion care

The UN has estimated in 2017 that repealing anti-abortion laws would save the lives of nearly 50,000 women a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=55141|title=UN News - Repealing anti-abortion laws would save the lives of nearly 50,000 women a year – UN experts|first=United Nations News Service|last=Section|date=27 September 2016|website=UN News Service Section}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unsafe abortions take place primarily in countries where abortion is illegal, but also occur in countries where it is legal, but women cannot access it because of various reasons ([[conscientious objector]]s among doctors, high prices, lack of knowledge that abortion is legal). Indeed, there are countries where the law  is liberal, but in practice it is very difficult to have an abortion, due to most doctors being  conscientious objectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/italian-gynaecologists-refuse-abortions-miscarriages|title=Seven in 10 Italian gynaecologists refuse to carry out abortions|journal=The Guardian|first1=Stephanie Kirchgaessner Pamela|last1=Duncan|first2=Alberto|last2=Nardelli|first3=Delphine|last3=Robineau|date=11 March 2016|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/doctors-refusal-to-perform-abortions-divides-croatia-02-13-2017|title=Doctors' Refusal to Perform Abortions Divides Croatia :: Balkan Insight|website=www.balkaninsight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that is some countries where abortion is legal it is ''[[de facto]]'' very difficult to have access to one is controversial; the UN in its 2017 resolution on ''Intensification of efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls: domestic violence'' urged states to guarantee access to "safe abortion where such services are permitted by national law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/71/170|title=United Nations Official Document|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safe and legal abortion services are often very difficult to access by women from rural areas or from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. In 2008, [[Human Rights Watch]] stated that "In fact, even where abortion is permitted by law, women often have severely limited access to safe abortion services because of lack of proper regulation, health services, or political will" and estimated that "Approximately 13 percent of maternal deaths worldwide are attributable to unsafe abortion—between 68,000 and 78,000 deaths annually."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/women/abortion.html|title=Human Rights Watch: Women's Human Rights: Abortion|website=www.hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maputo Protocol]], which was adopted by the [[African Union]] in the form of a protocol to the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]], states at  Article 14 (Health and Reproductive Rights) that: "(2). States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to: [...] c) protect the reproductive rights of women by authorising medical abortion in cases of sexual assault, rape, incest, and where the continued pregnancy endangers the mental and physical health of the mother or the life of the mother or the foetus." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.achpr.org/instruments/women-protocol/#14&lt;/ref&gt; The Maputo Protocol is the first international treaty to recognize abortion, under certain conditions, as a woman's human right.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.achpr.org/instruments/general-comment-two-rights-women/&lt;/ref&gt;

The  ''General comment No. 36 (2018) on article 6 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], on the right to life'', adopted by the [[Human Rights Committee]] in 2018, defines, for the first time ever, a human right to abortion - in certain circumstances (however these UN general comments are considered [[soft law]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/un-human-rights-treaty-bodies/general-comments-of-the-human-rights-committee-and-their-legitimacy/EF8328BB5B2B3EC932E44C45E192EB9B&lt;/ref&gt; and, as such, not legally binding).

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Although   States   parties   may  adopt measures designed to regulate voluntary terminations of pregnancy, such measures must not result in violation of the right to life of a pregnant woman or girl, or her other rights under the Covenant. Thus, restrictions on the ability of women or girls to seek abortion must not, inter alia, jeopardize their lives, subject them  to  physical  or  mental  pain  or  suffering  which violates  article  7,  discriminate  against them  or  arbitrarily  interfere  with  their  privacy.  ''States  parties  must  provide  safe,  legal  and effective  access  to  abortion where  the  life  and  health  of  the  pregnant  woman  or girl  is  at risk,  and  where  carrying a pregnancy to term  would cause  the  pregnant  woman  or  girl substantial  pain  or  suffering,  most  notably  where  the  pregnancy  is  the  result  of  rape  or incest or is not viable.'' [8] In addition, States parties may not regulate pregnancy or abortion in all other cases in a manner that runs contrary to their duty to ensure that women and girls do  not  have  to  undertake  unsafe  abortions,  and  they should  revise  their  abortion  laws accordingly.  [9]  For  example,  they  should  not  take measures  such  as  criminalizing pregnancies  by  unmarried  women  or  apply  criminal  sanctions  against  women  and  girls undergoing  abortion  [10]  or  against  medical  service providers  assisting  them  in  doing  so, since  taking  such  measures  compel  women  and  girls  to  resort  to  unsafe  abortion.  States parties should not introduce new barriers and should remove existing barriers [11] that deny effective  access  by  women  and  girls  to  safe  and  legal  abortion  [12],  including  barriers caused  as  a  result  of  the  exercise  of  conscientious objection  by  individual  medical providers.

When negotiating the Cairo Programme of Action at the 1994 [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD), the issue was so contentious that delegates eventually decided to omit any recommendation to legalize abortion, instead advising governments to provide proper post-abortion care and to invest in programs that will decrease the number of unwanted pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |page=6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 2008 the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]], a group comprising members from 47 European countries, adopted a resolution calling for the decriminalization of abortion within reasonable gestational limits and guaranteed access to safe abortion procedures. The nonbinding resolution was passed on April 16 by a vote of 102 to 69.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/media/inthenews/2008/04/18/index.html |title=Council of Europe Urges Member States to Decriminalize Abortion |publisher=Guttmacher.org |date=2008-04-18 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During and after the ICPD, some interested parties attempted to interpret the term ‘reproductive health’ in the sense that it implies abortion as a means of family planning or, indeed, a right to abortion. These interpretations, however, do not reflect the consensus reached at the Conference.
For the European Union, where legislation on abortion is certainly less restrictive than elsewhere, the Council Presidency has clearly stated that the Council’s commitment to promote ‘reproductive health’ did not include the promotion of abortion.&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament, 4 December 2003: Oral Question (H-0794/03) for Question Time at the part-session in December 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Dana Scallon to the Council. In the written record of that session, one reads: Posselt (PPE-DE): “Does the term ‘reproductive health’ include the promotion of abortion, yes or no?” - Antonione, Council: “No.”&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the European Commission, in response to a question from a Member of the European Parliament, clarified:

''“The term ‘reproductive health’ was defined by the United Nations (UN) in 1994 at the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development. All Member States of the Union endorsed the Programme of Action adopted at Cairo. The Union has never adopted an alternative definition of ‘reproductive health’ to that given in the Programme of Action, '''which makes no reference to abortion'''.”''&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament, 24 October 2002: Question no 86 by Dana Scallon (H-0670/02)&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the U.S., it should be noted that, only a few days prior to the Cairo Conference, the head of the U.S. delegation, Vice President Al Gore, had stated for the record:

''“Let us get a false issue off the table: the US does not seek to establish a new international right to abortion, and we do not believe that abortion should be encouraged as a method of family planning.”''&lt;ref&gt;Jyoti Shankar Singh, Creating a New Consensus on Population (London: Earthscan, 1998), 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Some years later, the position of the U.S. Administration in this debate was reconfirmed by U.S. Ambassador to the UN, Ellen Sauerbrey, when she stated at a meeting of the UN Commission on the Status of Women that: ''“nongovernmental organizations are attempting to assert that Beijing  in some way creates or contributes to the creation of an internationally recognized fundamental right to abortion”''.&lt;ref&gt;Lederer, AP/San Francisco Chronicle, 1 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; She added: ''“There is no fundamental right to abortion. And yet it keeps coming up largely driven by NGOs trying to hijack the term and trying to make it into a definition”''.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Reuters, 28 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative research from the [[Institute of Development Studies]] states that "access to safe abortion is a matter of human rights, democracy and public health, and the denial of such access is a major cause of death and impairment, with significant costs to [international] development".&lt;ref name=IDS2009&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121649491/issue | title = Unsafe Abortion: A Development Issue | journal = Institute of Development Studies (IDS) Bulletin | volume = 39 | date = July 2009 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research highlights the inequities of access to safe abortion both globally and nationally and emphasises the importance of global and national movements for reform to address this. The shift by campaigners of reproductive rights from an issue-based agenda (the right to abortion), to safe, legal abortion not only as a human right, but bound up with democratic and citizenship rights, has been an important way of reframing the abortion debate and reproductive justice agenda.&lt;ref name=IDS2009 /&gt;

Meanwhile, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] complicated the question even more through a landmark judgment (case of ''[[A. B. and C. v. Ireland]]''), in which it is stated that the denial of abortion for health and/or well-being reasons is an interference with an individuals right to respect for private and family life under Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], an interference which in some cases can be justified.

===Population control===
{{see also|Population control}}
[[File:Ceausescu_Anul_Nou.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], Romanian communist leader, enacted one of the most infamous [[natalist]] policies of the 20th century]]

A desire to achieve certain population targets has resulted throughout history in severely abusive practices, in cases where governments ignored human rights and enacted aggressive demographic policies. In the 20th century, several authoritarian governments have sought either to increase or to decrease the births rates, often through forceful intervention. One of the most notorious [[natalist]] policies is that which occurred in [[communist Romania]] in the period of 1967-1990 during communist leader [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], who adopted a very aggressive natalist policy which included outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, [[Tax on childlessness|taxes on childlessness]], and legal discrimination against childless people.  Ceaușescu's policy resulted in over 9,000 women who died due to [[illegal abortion]]s,&lt;ref name="Kligman short"&gt;Kligman, Gail.

The irony of Ceaușescu's aggressive natalist policy was a generation that may not have been born would eventually lead the [[Romanian Revolution]] which would overthrow and have him [[Trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu#Execution|executed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Freakonomics|last=Levitt &amp; Dubner|first=Steven &amp; Stephen|publisher=Penguin Group|year=2005|isbn=9780141019017|location=80 Strand, London WC2R ORL England|page=107|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In stark opposition with Ceaușescu's natalist policy was China's [[one child policy]], in effect from 1978 to 2015, which included abuses such as [[forced abortion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-18435126 |title=China forced abortion photo sparks outrage - BBC News |journal=BBC News |date= 2012-06-14|accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy has also been deemed responsible for the common practice of [[sex selective abortion]] which led to an imbalanced [[sex ratio]] in the country.&lt;ref name="Bulte, Heerink, &amp; Zhang, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulte, E., Heerink, N., &amp; Zhang, X.|title=China's one-child policy and 'the mystery of missing women': ethnic minorities and male-biased sex ratios.|journal=Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics|year=2011|volume=73|issue=1|pages=0305–9049|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00601.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s to 1980s, tension grew between women's health activists who advance women's reproductive rights as part of a human rights-based approach on the one hand, and population control advocates on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1984 UN World Population Conference in Mexico City population control policies came under attack from women's health advocates who argued that the policies' narrow focus led to coercion and decreased quality of care, and that these policies ignored the varied social and cultural contexts in which family planning was provided in developing countries. In the 1980s the HIV/AIDS epidemic forced a broader discussion of sex into the public discourse in many countries, leading to more emphasis on reproductive health issues beyond reducing fertility. The growing opposition to the narrow population control focus led to a significant departure in the early 1990s from past population control policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |pages=4–5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3thCcdyScsC&amp;dq=reproductive+rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, abortion opponents have begun to foment [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] about reproductive rights advocates, accusing them of advancing a [[Racism|racist]] agenda of [[eugenics]], and of trying to reduce the [[African American]] birth rate in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Dewan&gt;{{Cite news | last = Dewan | first = Shaila | author-link = | title = To Court Blacks, Foes of Abortion Make Racial Case | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | date = February 26, 2010 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/us/27race.html | accessdate = 7 June 2010 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Bride kidnapping|Bride price}}
[[Bride kidnapping]] or marriage by abduction, is the practice whereby a woman or girl is abducted for the purpose of a [[forced marriage]]. Bride kidnapping has been practiced historically in many parts of the world, and it continues to occur today in some places, especially in [[Central Asia]] and the [[Caucasus]], in countries such as  Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Armenia, as well as in Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kyrgyzstan-women-bride-kidnapping/one-in-five-girls-and-women-kidnapped-for-marriage-in-kyrgyzstan-study-idUSKBN1AH5GI | title=One in five girls and women kidnapped for marriage in Kyrgyzstan| journal=Reuters| date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-10913297 | title=Chechen stolen brides 'exorcised'| journal=BBC News| date=2010-08-10| last1=Ash| first1=Lucy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/kidnapped-raped-married-the-extraordinary-rebellion-of-ethiopias-abducted-wives-1922263.html | title=Kidnapped.

Abducting of women may happen on an individual scale or on a mass scale. [[Raptio]] is a Latin term referring to the large-scale abduction of women, usually for marriage or sexual slavery, particularity during wartime.

[[Bride price]], also called bridewealth, is money, property, or other form of wealth paid by a groom or his family to the parents of the woman he marries. The practice of bride price sometimes leads to parents selling young daughters into marriage and to trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Human+rights+groups+ask+NWFP+Govt.+to+ban+%27bride+price%27+to+curb+women...-a0216984357 | title=Human rights groups ask NWFP Govt.

In [[Peru]], President [[Alberto Fujimori]] (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] as a result of the ''[[Programa Nacional de Población]]'', a sterilization program put in place by his administration.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite news | title=Mass sterilization scandal shocks Peru | date=July 24, 2002 | accessdate=April 30, 2006 | publisher=[[BBC News]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630062037/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm | archivedate=June 30, 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his presidency, Fujimori put in place a program of forced sterilizations against [[Indigenous peoples in Peru|indigenous people]] (mainly the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]]), in the name of a "[[public health]] plan", presented on July 28, 1995.

Forced sterilization in the United States was practiced starting with the 19th century. The United States during the [[Progressive era]], ca. 1890 to 1920, was the first country to concertedly undertake compulsory sterilization programs for the purpose of [[eugenics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iredale | first1 = Rachel | year = 2000 | title = Eugenics And Its Relevance To Contemporary Health Care | url = | journal = Nursing Ethics | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas C.

====Canada====
{{Main|Compulsory sterilization in Canada}}
Compulsory sterilization has been practiced historically in parts of Canada. Two Canadian provinces ([[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]]) performed compulsory sterilization programs in the 20th century with eugenic aims. Canadian compulsory sterilization operated via the same overall mechanisms of [[institutionalization]], [[judgment]], and [[surgery]] as the American system.  However, one notable difference is in the treatment of non-insane criminals. Canadian legislation never allowed for punitive sterilization of inmates.

The [[Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta]] was enacted in 1928 and repealed in 1972. In 1995, [[Leilani Muir]] sued the Province of Alberta for forcing her to be sterilized against her will and without her permission in 1959. Since Muir’s case, the Alberta government has apologized for the forced sterilization of over 2,800 people. Nearly 850 Albertans who were sterilized under the Sexual Sterilization Act were awarded C$142 million in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)|title=Alberta Apologizes for Forced Sterilization|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/11/02/sterilize991102.html|accessdate=June 19, 2013|date=November 9, 1999|work=[[CBC News]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123020740/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/11/02/sterilize991102.html|archivedate=November 23, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1VoyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kecFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5397%2C1039102 Victims of sterilization finally get day in court.

[[File:Revelation 12 Sign.gif|thumb|The alignment on September 23, 2017]]
The '''Revelation 12 sign prophecy''' was an [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic belief]] that suggested an astronomical alignment on September 23, 2017 fulfilled the first two verses of Revelation 12.  This date coincided with the Autumnal equinox and the end of the Catholic September [[Ember days|Ember Days]]. This theory, promoted by a number of Christians and Christian news organizations, proposed that a literal fulfillment of the prophecy made in the [[Book of Revelation]] 12:1-2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+12:1-2&amp;version=KJV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Revelation 12:1-2 - ,King James Version|website=Bible Gateway|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; occurred on this date over [[Jerusalem]]. Others maintained caution while nevertheless marveling at the coincidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Can the Church at least be cautious?|url=http://watchfortheday.org/caution.html|website=watchfortheday.org|accessdate=June 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage of the [[New Testament]] in the [[Book of Revelation]] 12:1-3 describes "a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth." ([[New International Version|NIV]]).&lt;ref name="Rev12"&gt;[http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0769.html Saunder, Rev. William.

Some of the most common Christian interpretations of this passage interpret the woman as [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] or [[ancient Israel]], the man child as the [[incarnation of Jesus|incarnate Jesus]] and the (''teknon) child being'' the Body of Christ, and the woman's other offspring as the Church that forms during the tribulation.&lt;ref name="Rev12"/&gt;

==Overview==

On April 7, 2011, William Tapley's channel ThirdEagleBooks published the first video about the alignment entitled "Stellarium" giving the 2017 date of the great sign and explaining how the planetary alignment that year matched the text of Revelation 12 better than a 2011 alignments, which he said three earlier videos from other people had mentioned.&lt;ref name="tapley"/&gt; A few months later, on July 30, 2011, Scott Clarke from ERF Ministries posted a video on [[YouTube]] describing the alignment, which some people worldwide have now come to believe is the Revelation 12 sign.
During 2011, Scott Clarke continued to popularize the alignment on YouTube. On December 10, 2012, [[Unsealed World News]] suggested that the purported sign might be connected to the [[rapture]] of the Church, though they have repeatedly stated that the exact date of the rapture is unknown and might happen sometime before, on, or after September 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=God's Calendar: A Shocking Story|date=December 10, 2012 |work=[[Unsealed World News]] |url=http://www.unsealed.org/2012/12/gods-redemptive-calendar-shocking-story.html |access-date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Greg Lauer posted about the astronomical alignment and references Scott Clarke's reports on his website dated May 2017 that Lu Vega claimed that he discovered the sign about 2008 but told no one until after several others posted about it in 2011.&lt;ref name="ALittleStrength"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alittlestrength.com/articles/2017/1705-exit-sign.htm|title=The Exit Sign|last=Lauer|first=Greg|date=May 2017|website=A Little Strength|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2017, Luis ("Lu") B. Vega connected the sign to a "Conception Comet".&lt;ref name="ALittleStrength" /&gt;

The [[Apocalypse of John]] describes "a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head." The proponents of the ''Revelation 12 Sign'' say that the woman represents the constellation Virgo and the crown of twelve stars represents the nine stars of the constellation Leo in conjunction with Mercury, Mars, and Venus. The moon appears to be under the "feet" of the constellation Virgo in September 2017 and the sun will be passing through the constellation, which they say is what is meant by the woman being "clothed with the sun".&lt;ref name="Compendium"/&gt; The second verse of the twelfth chapter of [[Apocalypse of John|John's Apocalypse]] goes on to say that the woman "was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth."  Some people suggest this will be fulfilled because the planet [[Jupiter]] will be traversing the constellation after having undergone [[apparent retrograde motion]].  After entering what they perceive to be Virgo's "womb" around November 20, 2016.&lt;ref name="FiveDoves"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fivedoves.com/letters/july2017/luisv730.htm|title=Revelation 12 sign - Conception Comet C/2017 E1|website=www.fivedoves.com|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jupiter exits the lower part of the "womb" 42 weeks later, which is the approximate length of a human gestation (normal gestation periods lasting from 37 to 42 weeks).
[[File:Preg web final.gif|right|thumb|400px|The 42 week gestation of Jupiter]]

It was also discovered that the apparent retrograde of [[Jupiter]] in the womb of Virgo was preceded by C/2017 E1 (Comet Borisov) which is being called the ''Conception Comet''.  This comet traveled from the loins of the constellation Leo to the womb of the constellation Virgo on November 17, 2016,&lt;ref name="FiveDoves" /&gt; just before the entrance of Jupiter into the womb.  Some proponents of the Revelation 12 Sign are suggesting that this comet represented the divine insemination of the woman, which subsequently produced the male child (Jupiter). This will be the comet's only trip through our solar system as it is not a solar orbital. The complete astronomical alignment occurred on September 23, 2017, over Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="WaPo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Compendium"/&gt;

The Revelation 12 Sign may have coincided with the [[High Holy Day]] of [[Rosh Hashanah]] on the Jewish calendar, which is also called the ''Feast of Trumpets''. The Feast of Trumpets is the first of the Fall Feasts and its timing is traditionally based on the visibility of the new moon,&lt;ref name=templewitness&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templeinstitute.org/rosh_hashana/late_arrival.htm |title=The Temple Institute: Rosh HaShana in the Holy Temple: The Late Arrival of a Witness |accessdate=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in 2017 is expected to either begin on the evening of September 21 and end on the evening of the 22nd (if the 2% illuminated moon is sighted) or begin on the evening of the 22nd and end on the evening of the 23rd when the sign is fulfilled.&lt;ref name=jewcal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/calendar/view/month.asp?tdate=9/29/2017 |title=September, 2017 - Jewish Calendar |accessdate=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rosh Hashanah is the Jewish New Year celebration, in this case marking the end of the year 5777 (sometimes abbreviated to the [[777 (number)#Religious significance|significant number 777]]) and the beginning of 5778. The Feast of Trumpets in Jewish tradition is believed to be a day when the dead will be resurrected and judgement will begin&lt;ref name=judgement&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Holy_Days |title=High Holy Days - Wikipedia |accessdate=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Christians believe the period describes the tribulation period found in the Book of Revelation.&lt;ref name=bookrev&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lifehopeandtruth.com/prophecy/revelation/great-tribulation/ |title=Great Tribulation | website=lifehopeandtruth.com|accessdate=January 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpretations of Revelation 12 vary, but the general consensus of those who promoted this theory was that the September 2017 alignment was the Great Sign which is described in this passage of Scripture: that the woman represents the nation of Israel, which they believe is about to enter into a multi-year period of [[Tribulation]], and the male child represents the global [[Church invisible|Church]], which might be [[rapture]]d to [[Heaven]] before the Tribulation period begins according to Revelation 12:5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation+12:5&amp;version=KJV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Revelation 12:5 - King James Version|website=Bible Gateway|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many proponents say that in order for people to escape before this impending judgment on the world and be "raptured", they must accept that the Christian Messiah [[Jesus Christ]] died for their sins, rose again, and is the only means of being reconciled to God. These views are shared by all of the major proponents of the '''Revelation 12 Sign Prophesy'''.&lt;ref name="Compendium"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Revelation 12 – The Sign for Israel|date=February 4, 2017|author=Daniel Matson|work=Signs of the End |url=http://watchfortheday.org/signofisrael.html |accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=About Salvation - Get Washed Clean!|author=Scott Clarke|work=ERF Ministries |url=http://erfministries.com/blog_salvation.php |accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Revelation 12 Sign|work=Revelation 12 Daily |url=https://rev12daily.blogspot.com/p/basic.html |accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been pointed out by Revelation 12 Sign proponents that a number of eminent biblical scholars support their particular interpretation of Revelation 12, including [[John Nelson Darby]], [[Harry Ironside]], and more recently Dr. Michael Svigel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Proof of the Rapture in Revelation 12|date=June 2, 2017|work=Revelation 12 Daily |url=https://rev12daily.blogspot.com/2017/06/proof-of-rapture-in-revelation-12.html |accessdate=June 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apocalyptic symbol of "a woman in labor" is found throughout Jewish and Christian [[Scriptures]], which proponents suggest is evidence of the September 2017 alignment's importance in prophecy. These particular Scriptures include {{Bibleverse|Isaiah|13:6-13|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse|Isaiah|26:17-21|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse|Isaiah|66:7-11|KJV}},{{Bibleverse|Jeremiah|30:4-11|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse|Jeremiah|49:23-27|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse|Micah|5:3|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse|Matthew|24:8|KJV}}, {{Bibleverse|Mark|13:8|KJV}} and {{Bibleverse|1 Thessalonians|5:3|KJV}}. According to Isaiah 66 above, the birth of the man-child occurs before the woman travails in labor and pain. Proponents argue that the rapture is the marvel spoken of by Isaiah in the above passage—the man-child representing the Church that will be born before Israel enters the Tribulation. Since the woman apparently has other children according to Revelation 12 (such as Gentile Tribulation Saints and the 144,000), the dragon, since he cannot devour the raptured Church, persecutes the woman's other children spoken of later in Revelation 12.{{npsn|date=September 2018}}

Some, such as Lloyd F. Acree, claim a direct revelation from God brought the event to the world's attention as confirmation of the pre-tribulation Rapture and its timing to be in the year 2017. Shortly after L. Acree claims to have received his message in early Spring of 2017, he then took to preaching the prediction on various social media outlets and with the use of a sandwich board in the streets of Simpsonville, SC. Acree started his prophetic claims by saying the Rapture would occur by the end of Calender year 2017, He strongly directed people to Sept. 23 of that year, and when it did not come to pass, he returned to anytime by the end of the year.  Since this, too, had failed, he claimed that he had presumed God meant the planet's calender and not God's Holy 
Calender, which he then stated the Rapture would happen before the close of the Winter of 2017, or by March 20, 2018.  Since this failed, he, once again, proclaimed that it was, "Pushed back" until the passover, March 30, 2018.  Having failed four times, Lloyd still has not repented of his presumptuous speaking for God, when it is obvious by failure that he has no actual truthful revelation.

Still others, while hailing the sign as an indicator for Rapture, yet emphasize a broader interest in many possible events for its actual manifestation such as the Jewish holidays of September and the solar eclipse of August 21st, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zauzmer|first1=Julie|title=For some, eclipse day showcases God's majesty.

A number of critics have offered rebuttals of the purported sign arguing that the sign is not unique or is only [[astrology]].

Faulkner mentions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What Will Happen on September 23, 2017?|date=May 1, 2017 |author=Dr. Danny R. Faulkner|work=[[Answers in Genesis]] |url=https://answersingenesis.org/astronomy/stars/what-will-happen-september-23-2017/ |accessdate=July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; several specific points of contention including:

* "...Jupiter appears in the part of Virgo corresponding to her womb, along with the sun in Virgo and the moon at her feet for a day or two every 12 years or so."
* "Since the claim that Leo has nine stars is false, the assertion that the addition of the three planets brings the total number of stars in Leo to 12 is false too."
* "And how do we know that Jupiter must represent the child? There is no evidence for that either."
* "These sorts of claims amount to Rorschach tests—people tend to see in them what they want to see."
* "This year, with the huge popularity of YouTube, it is much easier to propagate these ideas."

Craig C. White is a proponent of a short timeline end of days, but gives several criticisms of the Rev 12 sign theory:&lt;ref name=craigwhiterev12 /&gt;
* "...the Apostle John says that 'there appeared a great wonder in heaven'. He doesn't say 'there will be a great wonder in heaven'. He doesn't tell us to 'look for a great wonder in heaven'."
* "...some proponents confuse the child in Revelation 12 with the Church. The child is obviously Jesus."
* "Some theorists say that Revelation 12:5 is describing the Rapture of the Church. Is the Church "a man child" as described in Rev 12:5? It is so very obvious that the man child who was caught up unto God, and to his throne is describing Jesus Christ at his ascension."
* "No I don't think that Revelation 12:5 describes the Rapture of the Church in any way. The events of Revelation 12:1-5 depict the history of Israel and their Messiah up until Jesus Christ's ascension. The events of Revelation chapter 12:6-17 describe the events that Israel will endure during their great tribulation while the Church watches from heaven."

Tim McHyde mentions several flaws in the Rev 12 theory:&lt;ref name=timmchyderev12/&gt;
* "...scholars have found that the sky on September 11, 3 BC to show the exact picture of Revelation 12:1, pointing to the birth of Christ on that day"
* "Clarke's theory, like all invented prophecy theories, depends on taking a verse out of its context and re-purposing it to serve some new theory. When you ignore the context of a verse, you are set up to misinterpret it. That's how you turn a solid reliable Bible prophecy into an unreliable quasi-biblical man-made prophecy interpretation."
* "The most natural explanation for all this is that the Woman is the faithful church of God among and from whom Jesus, a male person, was born (through blessed Mary). Jesus ascends to heaven and the faithful continue on the earth through the Great Tribulation."
* "For me the next problem is how Clarke has added elements to the biblical text that are not there, allowed for by problem #1 in ignoring verse 2 and 5. When he says this may be the rapture or second coming you would rightly ask, where does it say this in Revelation 12? Nowhere. It's added."
* "I think Scottie Clarke was so excited to find something "extremely rare" to combine with a Bible prophecy (namely, those three planets appearing in Virgo) that he missed something huge. There are already always twelve stars crowning Virgo, depending who you ask it is either the constellation called 'Berenice's hair'."
* "...the position of the sun does not match Rev 12:1 which says the sun clothes the woman. ...the sun is over her left shoulder. For the sun to clothe the woman, it would be on her body. Not at her head like the crown; not at her feet like the moon. In the middle where her body is; where clothing goes. If you want to see what it should look like, compare that to the picture of the sky on September 11, 3 BC when (I and many think) Jesus was born"
* "What we have is once again is another example of how Christian prophecy students can't seem to resist taking something from Scripture and combining it with something extra-biblical they subjectively and/or arbitrarily view as significant. A Jewish holiday. A (brief) historical pattern of economic downturns. A rare conjunction. Or three more blood moons."

Ed Stetzer who holds the Billy Graham Distinguished Chair of Church, Mission, and Evangelism at Wheaton College, and Executive Director of the [[Billy Graham Center]], wrote this about it:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stetzer|first1=Ed|title=No, the World Won't End Next Week and There's No Such Thing as a Christian Numerologist|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/edstetzer/2017/september/end-times-fake-news.html|website=christianitytoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"You basically got a made-up expert in a made-up field talking about a made-up event...it sort of justifies that there's a special secret number codes in the Bible that nobody believes,"}}

In response to the many critics of the Rev 12 sign theory, [[Unsealed World News]] has reiterated their position that the September 2017 alignment perfectly fits the description given in the biblical text and that their interpretation of the events described will be the only such occurrence in human history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why The Revelation 12 Sign Can't Be Debunked|date=August 1, 2017 |work=[[Unsealed World News]] |url=http://www.unsealed.org/2017/08/why-revelation-12-sign-cant-be-debunked.html |accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Defense Of The Revelation 12 Sign And Its Connection To The Rapture|date=February 14, 2017 |work=[[Unsealed World News]] |url=http://www.unsealed.org/2017/02/a-defense-of-revelation-12-sign-and-its.html |accessdate=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Celestial C-Section|date=January 11, 2017 |work=[[Unsealed World News]] |url=http://www.unsealed.org/2017/05/the-celestial-c-section-defense-of.html |accessdate=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Defense Of The Revelation 12 Sign: Part 4|date=May 22, 2017 |work=[[Unsealed World News]] |url=http://www.unsealed.org/2017/05/a-defense-of-revelation-12-sign-part-4.html |accessdate=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Debunkers Prove Revelation 12 Sign|date=June 16, 2017 |work=[[Unsealed World News]] |url=http://www.unsealed.org/2017/06/debunkers-inadvertently-prove.html |accessdate=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[AT&amp;T]] original [[documentary film|documentary]], ''The Sign'', explored the intersections of science, religion, and history behind the Revelation 12 debate. It aired on [[Audience (TV network)|Audience]] on September 14, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://about.att.com/story/att_audience_network_premieres_documentary_film_the_sign.html|title=AT&amp;T AUDIENCE Network Premieres Documentary Film "The Sign" on Sept. 14 at 8 p.m.|website=[[AT&amp;T]] Newsroom|date=September 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==The Second Stage of the Sign - 430 days later, 27 November 2018==

There are two signs (or wonders) mentioned in Revelation Chapter 12. The second is {{Bibleverse|Revelation|12:3-5|KJV}} This second sign is regarding the dragon which is now believed to be Scorpio. The everlasting Abrahamic covenant that God made with Abraham was fulfilled 430 years to the day ({{Bibleverse|Exodus|12:41|KJV}}) after Abraham was told to look up to the sky ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|15:5|KJV}}) and completed when Israel exited Egypt, which is confirmed in ({{Bibleverse|Galatians|3:17|KJV}}). Many Christian followers of the sign now recognise that after exactly 430 days, Jupiter which represents the manchild enters into Scorpio and is in perfect alignment with the Sun, Mercury, and the stars that comprise Scorpios left claw. This is widely believed to represent the second part of the sign which takes place on November 27, 2018. This day is also exactly 1260 days after Donald Trump announced his presidency on 16 June, 2015. (1260 days is a number for Biblical calculation based on half the seven year tribulation period 2520 days)

The '''Schofield Equation''' is a method of estimating the [[basal metabolic rate]] (BMR) of adult men and women published in 1985.&lt;ref name="pmid4044297"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schofield WN |title=Predicting basal metabolic rate, new standards and review of previous work |journal=Hum Nutr Clin Nutr |volume=39 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=5–41 |date=1985 |pmid=4044297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the equation used by the WHO in their technical report series.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organisation, Fao, and Unu. Energy and protein requirements. Geneva: WHO, Technical Report Series 724, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; The equation that is recommended to estimate BMR by the US [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]] is the [[Basal metabolic rate#BMR estimation formulas|Mifflin-St. Jeor equation]].&lt;ref&gt;J Am Diet Assoc. 2009;109:330-346.&lt;/ref&gt;

The equations for estimating [[Basal metabolic rate|BMR]] in kJ/day (kilojoules per day) from body mass (kg) are:&lt;ref name="fao"&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5686e/y5686e07.htm Energy Requirements of Adults, Report of a Joint FAO/WHO/UNU Expert Consultation], (See table 5.2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Key:

W = Body weight in kilograms

SEE = Standard error of estimation

The raw figure obtained by the equation should be adjusted up or downwards, within the confidence limit suggested by the quoted estimation errors, and according to the following principles:

Subjects leaner and more muscular than usual require more energy than the average.
Obese subjects require less.
Patients at the young end of the age range for a given equation require more energy.
Patients at the high end of the age range for a given equation require less energy.

Effects of age and body mass may cancel out: an obese 30-year-old or an athletic 60-year-old may need no adjustment from the raw figure.

To find actual energy needed per day (Estimated Energy Requirement), the base metabolism must then be multiplied by an activity factor. 
These are as follows:

*Sedentary people of both genders should multiply by 1.3. Sedentary is very physically inactive, inactive in both work and leisure.
*Lightly active men should multiply by 1.6 and women by 1.5. Lightly active means the daily routine includes some walking, or intense exercise once or twice per week. Most students are in this category.
*Moderately active men should multiply by 1.7 and women by 1.6. Moderately active means intense exercise lasting 20–45 minutes at least three time per week, or a job with a lot of walking, or a moderate intensity job.
*Very Active men should multiply by 2.1 and women by 1.9. Very active means intense exercise lasting at least an hour per day, or a heavy physical job, such as a mail carrier or an athlete in training.
*Extremely active men should multiply by 2.4 and women by 2.2. Extremely active means an athlete on an unstoppable training schedule or a very demanding job, such as working in the armed forces or shoveling coal.

These equations were published in 1989 in the dietary guidelines and formed the RDA's for a number of years. The activity factor used by the USDA was 1.6. In the UK, a lower activity factor  of 1.4 is used. The equation has now been replaced by the [[Institute of Medicine Equation]] in  September 2002 in the USA, however is still currently used by the FAO/WHO/UNU.

==Philosophy==
Science Buddies mission is to help students to build their literacy in science and technology so they can become productive and engaged citizens in the 21st century.

The site has personalized learning tools, over 15,000 pages of scientist-developed subject matter (including experiments based on the latest academic research), and an online community of science professionals who volunteer to advise students. 

Science Buddies also provides resources to support parents and teachers as they guide students seeking out and performing science projects. They attempt to provide a bridge between scientists, engineers, educators, and students, giving students access to current scientific research and simultaneously giving scientists a way to reach out to young people interested in their fields.

==About Science Buddies==
Noticing how much fun his teenage daughter had participating in science fairs but dismayed to discover a shortage of quality science fair help online, Ken Hess thought science fair "productivity tools" and mentoring would allow many more students to participate in science fairs and develop inspirational relationships with science role models. Over time, such a program would help students improve their science skills and literacy while inspiring them to consider careers in science and engineering. So, in early 2001, Ken Hess started a charity with a mission of developing online tools and support for students doing science fair projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.slac.stanford.edu/tip/2003/oct03/buddies.htm Stanford University Linear Accelerator Center Interaction Point newsletter]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Magid received his [[semicha]] (rabbinical ordination) in Jerusalem in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocean-beach.com/church_ob_fi_syna_magid.htm |title=Dr. Shaul Magid Bio |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207005932/http://ocean-beach.com/church_ob_fi_syna_magid.htm |archivedate=February 7, 2011 |date=January 14, 2004 |accessdate=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a candidate Fellow at the [[Shalom Hartman Institute]] and a graduate student in Medieval and Modern Jewish Thought at [[Hebrew University]], where he completed his MA in 1989. He obtained his Ph.D. in Jewish thought from [[Brandeis University]] in 1994.

==Career==
Magid served as a visiting professor at [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], [[Clark University]] and [[Boston University]]. He was the Anna Smith Fine Chair in Jewish Thought at Rice University from 1994–1996 and then joined the faculty of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] before leaving for [[Indiana University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~jsp/faculty/profile_sMagid.shtml |title=Shaul Magid: Faculty Profile, Borns Jewish Studies Program |accessdate=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magid has served as the rabbi of the Fire Island Synagogue since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fireislandsynagogue.org/rabbi.htm |title=Fire Island Synagogue: Rabbi Shaul Magid |accessdate=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major research grants include a 2017-2018 [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] Senior Fellowship at the [[Center for Jewish History]] for a book project on "American Jewish Survivalism: [[Meir Kahane]] and the Politics of Pride."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cjh.org/scholarship/center-for-jewish-history-fellows |title=Center for Jewish History Fellows |accessdate=August 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magid's books include ''Hasidism on the Margin: Reconciliation, Antinomianism, and Messianism in Izbica and Radzin Hasidism'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2003), ''From Metaphysics to Midrash: Myth, History, and the Interpretation of Scripture in Lurianic Kabbala'' (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2008), ''American Post-Judaism: Identity and Renewal in a Postethnic Society'' (Indiana University Press, 2013) and ''Hasidism Incarnate: Hasidism, Christianity, and the Construction of Modern Judaism'' (Stanford University Press, 2014). His book ''From Metaphysics to Midrash'' was awarded the 2008 American Academy of Religion Award for best book in religion in the textual studies category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aarweb.org/programs-services/book-awards |title=AAR Book Awards |accessdate=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the editor of ''God's Voice from the Void: Old and New Essays on Rabbi Nahman of Bratslav'' (SUNY Press, 2001) and co-editor of ''Beginning Again: Toward a Hermeneutic of Jewish Texts'' (Seven Bridges Press, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~jsp/faculty/profile_sMagid.shtml |title=Shaul Magid: Faculty Profile, Borns Jewish Studies Program |accessdate=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His essays have been published in ''Moment Magazine'', ''Open Zion'', ''Religion Dispatches'', ''Tablet Magazine'', ''Tikkun Magazine'', and ''Zeek Magazine''.

==Personal life==
Magid grew up as a non-observant Jew in New York when, at the age of 20, he became interested in learning more about Judaism. He became involved with the [[Haredi]] movement and studied [[Modern Orthodoxy]], but after several years he "...abandoned Orthodoxy more generally yet remained fascinated by, and deeply invested in, the complex nexus of Judaism and the American counter-culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Radical Banjo: About Shaul |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318003356/http://www.shaulmagid.net/ |archivedate=March 18, 2015 |url=http://www.shaulmagid.net/ |accessdate=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is often quoted on such issues in the popular press; for instance, he recently discussed [[Jerry Garcia]] and the [[Grateful Dead]] in relation to Judaism, speaking from the perspective of "an ordained rabbi and a professor of Jewish and religious studies at Indiana University who was also present for the Dead’s legendary performance on the grounds of Raceway Park in Englishtown, New Jersey on Sept. 3, 1977."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Rosen |first=Armin |date=August 1, 2017 |title=Happy Birthday, Jerry Garcia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5776">'''Stretchable electronics''', also known as elastic electronics or elastic circuits, is a technology for building electronic circuits by depositing stretchable electronic devices and circuits onto stretchable substrates or embed them completely in a stretchable material such as [[silicone]]s or [[polyurethane]]s. In the simplest case, stretchable electronics can be made by using the same components used for rigid printed circuit boards. One of the things that need to change is the substrate and the interconnections, being made [[wikt:stretchable|stretchable]], rather than flexible (see [[Flexible electronics]]) or rigid ([[Printed Circuit Board]]s). Typically, [[polymer]]s are chosen as substrates or material to embed. 
When rigid components are deposited onto stretchable substrates, the interconnects will be subjected to high mechanical [[strain (materials science)|strain]] whenever the substrate is flexed. This is because, when bending the substrate, the outermost radius of the bend will stretch so that the relative spacing of each interconnect will effectively increase in line with the increasing length of the substrate. Stretchable electronics attempts biomimicry of [[human skin]] and [[flesh]], in being stretchable, whilst retaining full functionality. The design space for products is opened up with stretchable electronics. 3D conformable circuits are now possible by the application of stretchable cyber-skins consisting of elastomeric carrier substrates populated with stretchable conductors and devices.

Stretchable electronics are sometimes called elastronics a new, emerging class of electronics, that is expected to enable a range of new applications: Some examples follow: Cyber skin for robotic devices, imparting a network of sensors on a fully conformable, stretchable cyber skin; [[in vivo]] implantable sponge-like electronics; and flesh-like devices with embedded electronic nervous systems.

== Applications ==

=== Energy ===
'''Stretchable energy storage devices'''

Most commonly used stretchable energy storage device is based on active materials for double-layer supercapacitors are carbon-based materials such as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), due to their excellent electrical conductivity and high surface areas. The carbon-based materials are also natural choices for stretchable supercapacitors, with proper structural engineering to impart stretchability to the devices. Most recent study by Li et al. shows the fully functionality of the stretchable supercapacitor under dynamic charging and discharging, for the first time, which is composed of both elastic PDMS substrates, buckled SWCNTs macrofilm and elastomeric separators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/nl303631e|pmid=23167804 |author=X Li, T Gu, B Wei |title=Dynamic and Galvanic Stability of Stretchable Supercapacitors|journal= Nano Letters |volume=12 |issue=12|pages=6366–6371|year=2012 |last2=Gu |last3=Wei }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although achieving excellent cycling stability, however, the key drawback of this stretchable energy storage based on supercapacitor technology is the low specific capacitance and energy density and this can potentially be improved by the incorporation of redox materials, for example the SWNT/MnO2 electrode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.nanoen.2012.02.011 | title=Facile synthesis and super capacitive behavior of SWNT/MnO2 hybrid films | journal=Nano Energy | date=2012 | volume=1 | issue=3 | pages=479–487 | first=Xin | last=Li}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach to creating stretchable energy storage device is the use of Origami folding principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi:10.1038/ncomms4140}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting origami battery achieves significant linear and areal deformability, large twistability and bendability. The strategy described here represents the fusion of the art of origami, materials science and functional energy storage devices, and could provide a paradigm shift for architecture and design of flexible and curvilinear electronics with exceptional mechanical characteristics and functionalities

=== Medicine ===

==== Diagnostics ====
Thanks to wearable robots that interact seamlessly with the human body, diseases can be detected. The scope of these wearable robots thanks to stretchable electronics stays however noninvasive.

==== Diabetes ====
Researchers from Seoul National University and MC10 (a flexible-electronics company that originated at MIT based in Lexington, Massachusetts) have developed a patch that is able to detect glucose levels in sweat and can deliver the medicine needed on demand (insulin or metformin). The patch consists of graphene riddled with gold particles and contains sensors that are able to detect temperature, pH level, glucose, and humidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601064/controlling-diabetes-with-a-skin-patch/|title=A skin patch prototype could someday end reliance on constant finger pricks for people with diabetes.|last=Talbot|first=David|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Surgeries ====
Stretchable electronics also permit developers to create soft robots. These soft robots can be used to implement minimal invasive surgeries in hospitals. Especially when it comes to surgeries of the brain and every millimeter is important, such robots may have a more precise scope of action than a human.

RISE SICS (previously Swedish Institute of Computer Science) is a leading research institute for applied information and communication technology in Sweden, founded in 1985. 

RISE SICS is a research institute in the most expansive area of industry this century: the total digitalization of products, services and businesses. SICS is in the midst of this revolution, boosting the competitive strength of Swedish industry and the quality and efficiency of Sweden’s public sector. 

In January 2005, SICS had about 88 employees, of which 77 were researchers, 30 with PhD degrees. {{As of|2016|04}}, SICS had about 200 employees, of which 160 were researchers, 83 with [[PhD]] degrees. The institute is headquartered in the [[Kista]] district of [[Stockholm]], with the main office in the Electrum building.

==Software==
Several well-known software packages have been developed at SICS:

*[[Contiki]], an [[operating system]] for small-memory embedded devices
*[[Delegent]], an authorization server
*[[Distributed Interactive Virtual Environment]] or DIVE in short
*[[lwIP]], a [[TCP/IP stack]] for [[embedded system]]s
*[[Oz (programming language)|Oz-Mozart]], a multi-platform programming system
*[[Nemesis (computing)|Nemesis]], a concept [[exokernel]] [[operating system]]
*[[Protothreads]], light-weight stackless [[Thread (computing)|threads]]
*[[Quintus Prolog]] and [[SICStus Prolog]], [[Prolog]] implementations
*[[Simics]], a full-system simulator originally developed at SICS
*[[uIP (micro IP)|uIP]], a [[TCP/IP stack]] for [[embedded system]]s

==Academic output==
The research at SICS results in approximately 100 refereed publications in [[academic journal]]s, conferences and workshops per year. Around 2-4 SICS researchers receive higher [[academic degree]]s per year, and 1-3 persons move to academia for [[tenure]]d positions.

SICS was ranked as the 15th most acknowledged computer science research institution in the world in an article in the December 2004 issue of the highly esteemed journal [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] (PNAS). SICS is the only Swedish institution included in the list, and is one of two European institutions (the other one is [[INRIA]]) alongside 13 well-known American institutions, several of them larger than SICS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0407743101 |title=Who gets acknowledged: Measuring scientific contributions through automatic acknowledgment indexing |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2661">'''Sympathy''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] συμπάθεια (sympatheia), from σύν (syn) "together" and πάθος (pathos) "passion", in this case an affection) is a short piece of [[instrumental]], music, a type of [[bagatelle (music)|bagatelle]],  that at the same time is a [[Homage (arts)|homage]], a [[requiem]] for a special person. 

[[File:S.f.P&amp;P.jpg|thumb|Peter Adrian Wulff and Natias Neutert, performing a 'sympathy' in 1988]]

== Origin ==
The earliest use of the name "sympathy" for [[instrumental]] musical work was by the German performer, poet, musician and thinker [[Natias Neutert]].  He introduced the word sympathy into the terminology of experimental music and [[performance art]] with his musical performance, titled ''Sympathy for Piano and Pump''.&lt;ref&gt;PARKETT No 15, Art Magazine, february Zürich 1988, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Laura von Spreckelsen: ''Grenzübertritte — zu den Aktivitäten von Natias Neutert in Berlin (Border Crossings — the activities of Natias Neutert in Berlin)'' In: NEW ART IN EUROPE No. 22, ’88.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Sympathy-Accord.jpg|thumb|''Sympathy Chord'' written by Natias Neutert, Faksimile 1987]]

== Premiere ==
The premiere of Natias Neutert’s  concerto within the frame of Berlin as Cultural City of Europe 1988 happened in the [[Martin-Gropius-Bau]]. It was a „kind of requiem for the great teacher [[Joseph Beuys]] whose use of a pneumatic pump as a sculptural object has inspired Neutert to convert it for this concerto into an unusual musical instrument.“ 
&lt;ref&gt;Berlin – Kulturstadt Europas 1988/Cultural City of Europe 1988/Ville Européenne de la Culture 1988, Verlag Ullstein, Frankfurt/Main – Berlin 1988, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

By virtue of his playing, pianist Adrian Wulff produces spacious arcs of sounds, and Neutert, the composer, performer and flute player himself, charms the finest sounds out oft the unusual ‚magic flute.’&lt;ref&gt;Cf Klaus Thomsen: ''Sympathy for Piano and pump — Neutert in Berlin, Hamburg, Heidelberg et al.'' In: Kunst Köln Art Cologne, Issue 4/’88.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The fact that the term sympathy imbedded itself into the terminology of experimental music and performance art as a name of such music piece, not least the young Italo-German film composer Pablo Paolo Kilian occupies, his short piece ''Time Travel - Back and Forth'' exactly the same and in this sense.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8513">[[File:DiffusionOfInnovation.png|thumb|[[Everett Rogers|Rogers]]{{'}} [[normal distribution|bell curve]]]]
The '''technology adoption lifecycle''' is a sociological model that describes the adoption or acceptance of a new product or innovation, according to the demographic and psychological characteristics of defined adopter groups. The process of adoption over time is typically illustrated as a classical [[normal distribution]] or "bell curve". The model indicates that the first group of people to use a new product is called "[[innovators]]", followed by "[[early adopters]]". Next come the '''early majority''' and '''late majority''', and the last group to eventually adopt a product are called "Laggards" or "phobics." For example, a phobic may only use a cloud service when it is the only remaining method of performing a required task, but the phobic may not have an in-depth technical knowledge of how to use the service.

The [[demographic]] and [[psychological]] (or "[[psychographic]]") profiles of each adoption group were originally specified by the North Central Rural Sociology Committee, Subcommittee for the Study of the Diffusion of Farm Practices, by agricultural researchers Beal and Bohlen in 1957.&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957/&gt;
The report summarized the categories as:&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957/&gt;
* [[innovators]] – had larger farms, were more educated, more prosperous and more risk-oriented
* [[early adopter]]s – younger, more educated, tended to be community leaders, less prosperous
* early majority – more conservative but open to new ideas, active in community and influence to neighbours
* late majority – older, less educated, fairly conservative and less socially active
* laggards – very conservative, had small farms and capital, oldest and least educated

The model has subsequently been adapted for many areas of technology adoption in the late 20th century.

==Adaptations of the model==
The model has spawned a range of adaptations that extend the concept or apply it to specific domains of interest.

In his book ''[[Crossing the Chasm]]'', [[Geoffrey Moore]] proposes a variation of the original lifecycle. He suggests that for discontinuous innovations, which may result in a Foster disruption based on s-curve, there is a gap or chasm between the first two adopter groups (innovators/early adopters), and the vertical markets.

Disruption as it is used today are of the [[Clayton M. Christensen]] variety. These disruptions are not s-curve based. 

In [[educational technology]], Lindy McKeown has provided a similar model (a pencil metaphor&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/lindy/pencil/pencil.htm Pencil metaphor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128192012/http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/lindy/pencil/pencil.htm |date=2007-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) describing the [[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]] uptake in education. In [[medical sociology]], Carl May has proposed [[normalization process theory]] that shows how technologies become embedded and integrated in health care and other kinds of organisation.

Wenger, White and Smith, in their book ''Digital habitats: Stewarding technology for communities'', talk of technology stewards: people with sufficient understanding of the technology available and the technological needs of a community to steward the community through the technology adoption process.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rayna and Striukova (2009) propose that the choice of initial market segment has crucial importance for crossing the chasm, as adoption in this segment can lead to a cascade of adoption in the other segments. This initial market segment has, at the same time, to contain a large proportion of visionaries, to be small enough for adoption to be observed from within the segment and from other segment and be sufficiently connected with other segments. If this is the case, the adoption in the first segment will progressively cascade into the adjacent segments, thereby triggering the adoption by the mass-market.&lt;ref&gt; Rayna, Thierry, Striukova, Ludmila and Landau, Samuel, Crossing the Chasm or Being Crossed Out: The Case of Digital Audio Players (March 7, 2009). International Journal of Actor-Network Theory and Technological Innovation, Vol. 1, No. 3, pp. 36-54, July-September 2009. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1392691&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
One way to model product adoption&lt;ref&gt;Von Ahn, Luis. (2008) [http://scienceoftheweb.org/15-396/lectures/lecture04.pdf Science of the Web] lectures at Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/ref&gt; is to understand that people's behaviours are influenced by their peers and how widespread they think a particular action is. For many format-dependent technologies, people have a non-zero payoff for adopting the same technology as their closest friends or colleagues. If two users both adopt product A, they might get a payoff ''a''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0; if they adopt product B, they get ''b''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0. But if one adopts A and the other adopts B, they both get a payoff of&amp;nbsp;0.

A threshold can be set for each user to adopt a product. Say that a node v in a graph has d neighbors: then v will adopt product A if a fraction p of its neighbors is greater than or equal to some threshold. For example, if v's threshold is 2/3, and only one of its two neighbors adopts product A, then v will not adopt A. Using this model, we can deterministically model product adoption on sample networks.

==History==
The technology adoption lifecycle is a [[sociological]] model that is an extension of an earlier model called ''the diffusion process'', which was originally published in 1957 by Joe M. Bohlen, George M. Beal and [[Everett M. Rogers]] at [[Iowa State University]] and which was originally published only for its application to [[agriculture]] and [[home economics]].&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957&gt;{{cite journal

building on earlier research conducted there by Neal C. Gross and Bryce Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Neal C. (1942) ''The diffusion of a culture trait in two Iowa townships''. M.S. Thesis, Iowa State College, Ames.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Bryce, and Neal C. Gross (1943) “The diffusion of hybrid seed corn in two Iowa communities.” ''Rural Sociology'' 8: 15–24. RS(E)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Bryce, and Neal C. Gross (1950) ''Acceptance and diffusion of hybrid corn seed in two Iowa communities''. Research Bulletin 372, Agricultural Experiment Station, Ames, Iowa.&lt;/ref&gt; Their original purpose was to track the purchase patterns of hybrid seed corn by farmers.

Beal, Rogers and Bohlen together developed a model called ''the diffusion process''&lt;ref&gt;Beal, George M., Everett M. Rogers, and Joe M. Bohlen (1957) "Validity of the concept of stages in the adoption process." ''Rural Sociology'' 22(2):166–168.&lt;/ref&gt; and later, Everett Rogers generalized the use of it in his widely acclaimed book 1962 ''[[Diffusion of innovations|Diffusion of Innovations]]''&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Everett M. (1962). ''Diffusion of Innovations'', Glencoe: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (now in its fifth edition{{cn|date=November 2016}}), describing how new ideas and technologies spread in different cultures. Others have since used the model to describe how innovations spread between states in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Robert L. (1985). "Diffusion Research Traditions and the Spread of Policy Innovations in a Federal System" ''Publius'' 15 (Fall): 1–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Gnostic Paul''''' is a book by [[Elaine Pagels]], a scholar of [[gnosticism]] and professor of religion at [[Princeton University]]. In the work, Pagels considers each of the non-pastoral [[Pauline epistles]], and [[Authorship of the Pauline epistles|questions about their authorship]]. The core of the book examines how the Pauline epistles were read by 2nd century [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinian]] gnostics and demonstrates that Paul could be considered a proto-[[gnostic]] as well as a proto-[[Catholic]]. 

Her treatment involves reading the Pauline corpus as being dual layered between a [[Pneumatic (Gnosticism)|pneumatic]], [[Gnosticism#Important terms and concepts|esoteric Christianity]] and a [[Christianity#Beliefs|psychic, exoteric Christianity]].
