'''Accidental Adversaries''' is one of the ten [[system archetype]]s used in [[system dynamics]] modelling, or [[systems thinking]]. This archetype describes the degenerative pattern that develops when two subjects cooperating for a common goal, accidentally take actions that undermine each other's success. It is similar to the [[System archetype#Escalation|escalation system archetype]] in terms of pattern behaviour that develops over time.&lt;ref name="fieldbook"&gt;Senge, P. et al. (1994). The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook. New York: Doubleday Currency.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archetype description==

The archetype describes a pattern where two subjects have decided to work together because they will benefit from the alliance.&lt;ref name="Braun"&gt;Braun B. (2002) [http://www.albany.edu/faculty/gpr/PAD724/724WebArticles/sys_archetypes.pdf The System Archetypes]&lt;/ref&gt; Each take actions believing that it will bring benefit to the other and if the cooperation works, they will both benefit from it. Problems start arising when one or both of the subjects need to fix a local gap in performance, maybe due to external pressure. They initiate action to fix the gap and accidentally undermine each other's success. The result of these activities may produce a sense of resentment or frustration between the subjects or it may even turn the subjects into adversaries (hence the archetype name), thereby destroying the alliance.

===History===

The original set of system archetypes were published in [[The Fifth Discipline]] by [[Peter Senge]].  The exact source of these generic structures is not known.  However "Accidental Adversaries"  has a clear origin.  It is derived from observations made by Jennifer Kemeny, a colleague of Senge's and a contributor to the original archetype descriptions. In her consulting work in the late 1980s she was intrigued at how often potential strategic alliances were unsuccessful, or devolved into outright hostility. Such a recurring phenomenon suggested a structural cause.  The essential elements of the archetype were first described during a session Kemeny facilitated.  It was the first meeting of the first ever alliance between Walmart and Procter and Gamble.  Employees diagrammed how their protective business policies caused unintentional damage to the other company – which responded with similarly defensive actions.  The net effect of these "back and forth" behaviors was lower profit and less goodwill –  which for a long period of time had overshadowed the possibility of mutual benefit between the organizations. An early description of "Accidental Adversaries" is in The Fifth Discipline: Fieldbook, by Senge, ''et al.''

===Description of the model===
Let's consider two parties A and B. They have realised that by uniting forces, they can increase their success, whatever that may be. At a certain point in time, say B, takes corrective actions in order to counteract a decrease in performance due to external pressure. Although B's actions are important for B, their impact on A are not understood or not considered. The result is that now A feels that he is being betrayed and reacts to diminish the negative effects of B's actions. Ironically, A's new actions now obstruct B's success. If this situation persists and the results worsen, the alliance breaks down. A [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle#Vicious circle|vicious circle]] is created and each partner has now even forgotten the original purpose of the alliance. A and B's actions now only focus on counteracting the hostile actions taken by the other. A and B thus 'accidentally' become adversaries.&lt;ref name="systemswiki"&gt;Accidental Adversaries Systems Archetype at SystemsWiki.org. {{cite web|url=http://www.systemswiki.org/index.php?title%3DAccidental_Adversaries_Systems_Archetype |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920154719/http://www.systemswiki.org/index.php?title=Accidental_Adversaries_Systems_Archetype |archivedate=2011-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causal Loop diagram==
The [[causal loop diagram]] in Figure 1 shows the pattern dynamics of the system.&lt;ref name="systemsthinking"&gt;Accidental Adversaries at Systems-Thinking.org. http://www.systems-thinking.org/theWay/saa/aa.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Accidental Adversaries Causal Loop original.svg|thumb|center|350px|alt=Causal loop diagram|Figure 1. Causal loop diagram]]
The pattern of behaviour begins with the outer [[Positive feedback|reinforcing loop]] R1 where A and B have formed a synergistic alliance that benefits both. An action taken by A in favour of B increases B's success and vice versa. At some point in time, though, say B, initiates a series of corrective actions in order to adjust its performance. The actions taken increase performance, whose effects balance the number of corrective actions required. This results in the creation of a [[Negative feedback|balancing loop]], B2. These actions also unintentionally obstruct the other party's success, and result in the formation of the negative reinforcing loop R2 that undermines the [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle#Virtuous circle|virtuous]] reinforcing loop R1. Now each corrective action taken by B causes A to start taking corrective measures as well, thus activating its own balancing loop B1. The formation of R2 is the critical point at which the dynamics of the system go out of control, resembling the [[System archetype#Escalation|Escalation]] archetype.

==Stock and flow diagram==
Figure 2 shows the [[stock and flow|stock and flow diagram]] for this archetype.&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Accidental Adversaries Stock and flow.svg|thumb|center|350px|alt=Stock&amp;Flow diagram|Figure 2. Stock and Flow diagram]]

==Alternative model==
An alternative form of the model is shown in Figure 3. The differences are in the two reinforcing loops R3 and R4. Here, A and B specifically take actions to improve their growth, not, as before, to adjust their performance to a pre-determined target. By seeking improvement through R3 and R4, A and B suppress the effects of R1 and establish the negative-effect reinforcing loop R2, that in turn, completely takes over B5 and B6. The two balancing loops B5 and B6 are formed by, respectively,&lt;br/&gt;
:''B's success-&gt;B's actions in A's favour-&gt;A's success-&gt;A's actions to improve A's success-&gt;A's unintended obstruction of B's success'' and
:''A's success-&gt;A's actions in B's favour-&gt;B's success-&gt;B's actions to improve B's success-&gt;B's unintended obstruction of A's success''.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Accidental Adversaries Causal Loop Alternative model.svg|thumb|350px|center|Figure 3. Alternative Causal Loop diagram]].

==Model behaviour==

The archetype behaviour over time is shown in Figure 4.[[File:Accidental Adversaries TimeBehaviour.png|thumb|center|400px|Figure 4. Behaviour over time]]&lt;br/&gt;Both parties show a similar trend in direction and rate of change of success, with one trailing behind the other one due to system delays. Even though the pattern shows stable periods, the overall trend follows a downward direction.&lt;ref name="Braun" /&gt; The above simulation can be run from [[InsightMaker]].&lt;ref name="Insight Maker"&gt;{{cite web | title=Clone of Accidental Adversaries | website=Insight Maker | url=http://insightmaker.com/insight/678 | access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible leverage points==

It is possible to achieve leverage by introducing or re-emphasising a link between each party's success,&lt;ref name="wolstenholme"&gt;Wolstenholme E. F. (2003)
[http://www.symmetricsd.co.uk/files/Towards_definition_of_a_core_set_of_archetypal_structures.pdf Towards the definition and use of a core set of archetypal structures in system dynamics]&lt;/ref&gt; thus re-establishing the outer virtuous reinforcing loop shown in Figure 3. Kemeny proposes a list of seven action steps to deal with the unintended consequences of each party's actions, given their [[mental model]]s:&lt;ref name="kemeny"&gt;Kemeny J (1994) "Accidental Adversaries": When Friends Become Foes, ''The Systems Thinker'', Vol. 5, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

* Reconstruct the conditions that were the catalyst for collaboration.
* Review the original understandings and expected mutual benefits.
* Identify conflicting incentives that may be driving adversarial behaviour.
* Map the unintended side effects of each party’s actions.
* Develop overarching goals that align the efforts of the parties.
* Establish metrics to monitor collaborative behaviour.
* Establish routine communication

==Example==

A classic example of the Accidental Adversaries system archetype is that of [[Procter &amp; Gamble|Procter and Gamble]] supplying [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]]. When Procter and Gamble's profits decline, they introduce promotions. This results in extra costs and decreasing profitability for Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart's responds by stocking-up – buying large quantities of products during the discount period – and then selling them at regular prices when promotions end, thereby increasing its margins. Procter and Gamble's production now faces great swings in volume because Wal-Mart does not need to order products for months, which adds to P and G's costs. To improve their situation, Procter and Gamble pushes even more on promotions, blaming at the same time Wal-Mart for their problems. Wal-Mart reacts by stocking-up even more. Eventually, Procter and Gamble finds itself putting a lot of effort into promotions, at the expense of new product development, while Wal-Mart concentrates solely on buying and storing promoted products rather than improving their operations. The situation is described by the causal loop diagram in Figure 5.
In the Procter and Gamble/Wal-Mart case, leverage was achieved by bringing both parties together to understand the structure they had unintentionally created, even though each party 's action was completely rational and understandable from their local perspective.&lt;ref name="kemeny" /&gt;

[[Image:Euclid flowchart.svg|thumb|right| [[Flowchart]] of an algorithm ([[Euclid's algorithm]]) for calculating the greatest common divisor (g.c.d.) of two numbers ''a'' and ''b'' in locations named A and B. The algorithm proceeds by successive subtractions in two loops: IF the test B ≥ A yields "yes" (or true) (more accurately the ''number'' ''b'' in location B is greater than or equal to the ''number'' ''a'' in location A) THEN, the algorithm specifies B ← B − A (meaning the number ''b'' − ''a'' replaces the old ''b''). Similarly, IF A &gt; B, THEN A ← A − B. The process terminates when (the contents of) B is 0, yielding the g.c.d. in A. (Algorithm derived from Scott 2009:13; symbols and drawing style from Tausworthe 1977).]]

In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], an '''algorithm''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-algorithm.ogg|ˈ|æ|l|ɡ|ə|r|ɪ|ð|əm}}) is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform [[calculation]], [[data processing]] and [[automated reasoning]] tasks.

As an [[effective method]], an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time&lt;ref&gt;"Any classical mathematical algorithm, for example, can be described in a finite number of English words" (Rogers 1987:2).&lt;/ref&gt; and in a well-defined formal language&lt;ref&gt;Well defined with respect to the agent that executes the algorithm: "There is a computing agent, usually human, which can react to the instructions and carry out the computations" (Rogers 1987:2).&lt;/ref&gt; for calculating a [[Function (mathematics)|function]].&lt;ref&gt;"an algorithm is a procedure for computing a ''function'' (with respect to some chosen notation for integers) ... this limitation (to numerical functions) results in no loss of generality", (Rogers 1987:1).&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps [[Empty string|empty]]),&lt;ref&gt;"An algorithm has [[zero]] or more inputs, i.e., [[quantity|quantities]] which are given to it initially before the algorithm begins" (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; the instructions describe a [[computation]] that, when [[Execution (computing)|executed]], proceeds through a finite&lt;ref&gt;"A procedure which has all the characteristics of an algorithm except that it possibly lacks finiteness may be called a 'computational method'" (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output"&lt;ref&gt;"An algorithm has one or more outputs, i.e. quantities which have a specified relation to the inputs" (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily [[deterministic]]; some algorithms, known as [[randomized algorithms]], incorporate random input.&lt;ref&gt;Whether or not a process with random interior processes (not including the input) is an algorithm is debatable. Rogers opines that: "a computation is carried out in a discrete stepwise fashion, without use of continuous methods or analogue devices . . . carried forward deterministically, without resort to random methods or devices, e.g., dice" Rogers 1987:2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept of algorithm has existed for centuries. Greek mathematicians used algorithms in, for example, the [[sieve of Eratosthenes]] for finding prime numbers and the [[Euclidean algorithm]] for finding the [[greatest common divisor]] of two numbers.&lt;ref name=Cooke2005&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooke |first=Roger L. |title=The History of Mathematics: A Brief Course |date=2005 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118460290}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The word ''algorithm'' itself derives from the 9th century mathematician [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]], Latinized ''Algoritmi''. A partial formalization of what would become the modern concept of algorithm began with attempts to solve the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] (decision problem) posed by [[David Hilbert]] in 1928. Later formalizations were framed as attempts to define "[[effective calculability]]"&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:274&lt;/ref&gt; or "effective method".&lt;ref&gt;Rosser 1939 in Davis 1965:225&lt;/ref&gt; Those formalizations included the [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]]–[[Jacques Herbrand|Herbrand]]–[[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive functions]] of 1930, 1934 and 1935, [[Alonzo Church]]'s [[lambda calculus]] of 1936, [[Emil Post]]'s [[Formulation 1]] of 1936, and [[Alan Turing]]'s [[Turing machines]] of 1936–37 and 1939.

== Etymology ==
The word 'algorithm' has its roots in Latinizing the name of [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi]] in a first step to ''algorismus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Al-Khwarizmi.html|title=Al-Khwarizmi biography|website=www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Etymology of algorithm|url=http://chambers.co.uk/search/?query=algorithm&amp;title=21st|website=Chambers Dictionary|accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Khwārizmī ({{lang-fa|خوارزمی}}, c. 780–850) was a [[Persian people|Persian]]  mathematician, [[astronomer]], [[geographer]], and scholar in the [[House of Wisdom]] in [[Baghdad]], whose name means 'the native of [[Khwarezm]]', a region that was part of [[Greater Iran]] and is now in [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref name="Hogendijk"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jan P. |last=Hogendijk |title=al-Khwarzimi |journal=Pythagoras |volume=38 |issue=2 |year=1998 |pages=4–5 |url=http://www.kennislink.nl/web/show?id=116543 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412193516/http://www.kennislink.nl/web/show?id=116543 |archivedate=April 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oaks"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jeffrey A.|last=Oaks|url=http://facstaff.uindy.edu/~oaks/MHMC.htm|title=Was al-Khwarizmi an applied algebraist?|publisher=[[University of Indianapolis]]|accessdate=May 30, 2008|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGLbfttF?url=http://facstaff.uindy.edu/~oaks/MHMC.htm|archive-date=November 15, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 825, al-Khwarizmi wrote an [[Arabic language]] treatise on the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]], which was translated into [[Latin]] during the 12th century under the title ''Algoritmi de numero Indorum''. This title means "Algoritmi on the numbers of the Indians", where "Algoritmi" was the translator's [[Latinisation of names|Latinization]] of Al-Khwarizmi's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Brezina| first = Corona| title = Al-Khwarizmi: The Inventor Of Algebra| url = https://books.google.com/?id=955jPgAACAAJ| year = 2006| publisher = The Rosen Publishing Group| isbn = 978-1-4042-0513-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Khwarizmi was the most widely read mathematician in Europe in the late Middle Ages, primarily through another of his books, the [[Al-Jabr|Algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Boyer_Foremost_Text.html Foremost mathematical texts in history], according to [[Carl B. Boyer]].&lt;/ref&gt; In late medieval Latin, ''algorismus'', English '[[algorism]]', the corruption of his name, simply meant the "decimal number system". In the 15th century, under the influence of the Greek word ἀριθμός 'number' (''cf.'' 'arithmetic'), the Latin word was altered to ''algorithmus'', and the corresponding English term 'algorithm' is first attested in the 17th century; the modern sense was introduced in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', Third Edition, 2012 [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/4959 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, it was first used in about 1230 and then by [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] in 1391. English adopted the French term, but it wasn't until the late 19th century that "algorithm" took on the meaning that it has in modern English.

Another early use of the word is from 1240, in a manual titled ''Carmen de Algorismo'' composed by [[Alexander of Villedieu|Alexandre de Villedieu]]. It begins thus:

{{quote|''Haec algorismus ars praesens dicitur, in qua / Talibus Indorum fruimur bis quinque figuris.''}}
which translates as:
{{quote|Algorism is the art by which at present we use those Indian figures, which number two times five.}}

The poem is a few hundred lines long and summarizes the art of calculating with the new style of Indian dice, or Talibus Indorum, or Hindu numerals.

==Informal definition==
{{about||a detailed presentation of the various points of view on the definition of "algorithm"| Algorithm characterizations}}
An informal definition could be "a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations."&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1973:4&lt;/ref&gt; which would include all computer programs, including programs that do not perform numeric calculations. Generally, a program is only an algorithm if it stops eventually.&lt;ref&gt;Stone simply requires that "it must terminate in a finite number of steps" (Stone 1973:7–8).&lt;/ref&gt;

A prototypical example of an algorithm is the [[Euclidean algorithm]] to determine the maximum common divisor of two integers; an example (there are others) is described by the [[flowchart]] above and as an example in a later section.

{{Harvtxt|Boolos|Jeffrey|1974, 1999|ref=CITEREFBoolosJeffrey1999}} offer an informal meaning of the word in the following quotation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No human being can write fast enough, or long enough, or small enough† ( †"smaller and smaller without limit ...you'd be trying to write on molecules, on atoms, on electrons") to list all members of an enumerably infinite set by writing out their names, one after another, in some notation. But humans can do something equally useful, in the case of certain enumerably infinite sets: They can give ''explicit instructions for determining the '''n'''th member of the set'', for arbitrary finite ''n''. Such instructions are to be given quite explicitly, in a form in which ''they could be followed by a computing machine'', or by a ''human who is capable of carrying out only very elementary operations on symbols.''&lt;ref&gt;Boolos and Jeffrey 1974,1999:19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An "enumerably infinite set" is one whose elements can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the integers. Thus, Boolos and Jeffrey are saying that an algorithm implies instructions for a process that "creates" output integers from an ''arbitrary'' "input" integer or integers that, in theory, can be arbitrarily large. Thus an algorithm can be an algebraic equation such as ''y = m + n'' – two arbitrary "input variables" ''m'' and ''n'' that produce an output ''y''. But various authors' attempts to define the notion indicate that the word implies much more than this, something on the order of (for the addition example):
:Precise instructions (in language understood by "the computer")&lt;ref&gt;cf Stone 1972:5&lt;/ref&gt; for a fast, efficient, "good"&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:7 states: "In practice we not only want algorithms, we want ''good'' algorithms ... one criterion of goodness is the length of time taken to perform the algorithm ... other criteria are the adaptability of the algorithm to computers, its simplicity, and elegance, etc."&lt;/ref&gt; process that specifies the "moves" of "the computer" (machine or human, equipped with the necessary internally contained information and capabilities)&lt;ref&gt;cf Stone 1973:6&lt;/ref&gt; to find, decode, and then process arbitrary input integers/symbols ''m'' and ''n'', symbols ''+'' and ''='' ... and "effectively"&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1973:7–8 states that there must be, "...a procedure that a robot [i.e., computer] can follow in order to determine precisely how to obey the instruction." Stone adds finiteness of the process, and definiteness (having no ambiguity in the instructions) to this definition.&lt;/ref&gt; produce, in a "reasonable" time,&lt;ref&gt;Knuth, loc. cit&lt;/ref&gt; output-integer ''y'' at a specified place and in a specified format.

The concept of ''algorithm'' is also used to define the notion of [[decidability (logic)|decidability]]. That notion is central for explaining how [[formal system]]s come into being starting from a small set of [[axiom]]s and rules. In [[logic]], the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured, as it is not apparently related to our customary physical dimension. From such uncertainties, that characterize ongoing work, stems the unavailability of a definition of ''algorithm'' that suits both concrete (in some sense) and abstract usage of the term.

==Formalization==
&lt;!-- [[Computer program]] links here. --&gt;
Algorithms are essential to the way computers process data. Many computer programs contain algorithms that detail the specific instructions a computer should perform (in a specific order) to carry out a specified task, such as calculating employees' paychecks or printing students' report cards. Thus, an algorithm can be considered to be any sequence of operations that can be simulated by a [[Turing reduction|Turing-complete]] system. Authors who assert this thesis include Minsky (1967), Savage (1987) and Gurevich (2000):
&lt;blockquote&gt; Minsky: "But we will also maintain, with Turing . . . that any procedure which could "naturally" be called effective, can, in fact, be realized by a (simple) machine. Although this may seem extreme, the arguments . . . in its favor are hard to refute".&lt;ref name="Minsky 1967:105"&gt;{{harvnb|Minsky|1967|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;blockquote&gt;Gurevich: "...Turing's informal argument in favor of his thesis justifies a stronger thesis: every algorithm can be simulated by a Turing machine ... according to Savage [1987], an algorithm is a computational process defined by a Turing machine".&lt;ref&gt;Gurevich 2000:1, 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Typically, when an algorithm is associated with processing information, data can be read from an input source, written to an output device and stored for further processing. Stored data are regarded as part of the internal state of the entity performing the algorithm. In practice, the state is stored in one or more [[data structure]]s.

For some such computational process, the algorithm must be rigorously defined: specified in the way it applies in all possible circumstances that could arise. That is, any conditional steps must be systematically dealt with, case-by-case; the criteria for each case must be clear (and computable).

Because an algorithm is a precise list of precise steps, the order of computation is always crucial to the functioning of the algorithm. Instructions are usually assumed to be listed explicitly, and are described as starting "from the top" and going "down to the bottom", an idea that is described more formally by ''[[control flow|flow of control]]''.

So far, this discussion of the formalization of an algorithm has assumed the premises of [[imperative programming]]. This is the most common conception, and it attempts to describe a task in discrete, "mechanical" means. Unique to this conception of formalized algorithms is the [[assignment operation]], setting the value of a variable. It derives from the intuition of "[[memory]]" as a scratchpad. There is an example below of such an assignment.

For some alternate conceptions of what constitutes an algorithm see [[functional programming]] and [[logic programming]].

===Expressing algorithms===
Algorithms can be expressed in many kinds of notation, including [[natural language]]s, [[pseudocode]], [[flowchart]]s, [[DRAKON|drakon-charts]], [[programming language]]s or [[control table]]s (processed by [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreters]]). Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous, and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms. Pseudocode, flowcharts, [[DRAKON|drakon-charts]] and control tables are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in natural language statements. Programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed by a computer but are often used as a way to define or document algorithms.

There is a wide variety of representations possible and one can express a given [[Turing machine]] program as a sequence of machine tables (see more at [[finite-state machine]], [[state transition table]] and [[control table]]), as flowcharts and [[DRAKON|drakon-charts]] (see more at [[state diagram]]), or as a form of rudimentary [[machine code]] or [[assembly code]] called "sets of quadruples" (see more at [[Turing machine]]).

Representations of algorithms can be classed into three accepted levels of Turing machine description:&lt;ref&gt;Sipser 2006:157&lt;/ref&gt;
; 1 High-level description
: "...prose to describe an algorithm, ignoring the implementation details. At this level, we do not need to mention how the machine manages its tape or head."
; 2 Implementation description
: "...prose used to define the way the Turing machine uses its head and the way that it stores data on its tape. At this level, we do not give details of states or transition function."
; 3 Formal description
: Most detailed, "lowest level", gives the Turing machine's "state table".

For an example of the simple algorithm "Add m+n" described in all three levels, see [[Algorithm#Examples]].

==Design==

{{See also|Algorithm#By design paradigm}}

Algorithm design refers to a method or mathematical process for problem-solving and engineering algorithms. The design of algorithms is part of many solution theories of [[operation research]], such as [[dynamic programming]] and [[Divide and conquer algorithm|divide-and-conquer]]. Techniques for designing and implementing algorithm designs are also called algorithm design patterns,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://ww3.algorithmdesign.net/ch00-front.html|title=Algorithm Design: Foundations, Analysis, and Internet Examples|last1=Goodrich|first1=Michael T.|author1-link=Michael T. Goodrich|last2=Tamassia|first2=Roberto|author2-link=Roberto Tamassia|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2002|isbn=0-471-38365-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the template method pattern and decorator pattern.

One of the most important aspects of algorithm design is creating an algorithm that has an efficient run-time, also known as its [[Big O notation|Big O]].

Typical steps in the development of algorithms:
# Problem definition
# Development of a model
# Specification of the algorithm
# Designing an algorithm
# Checking the correctness of the algorithm
# Analysis of algorithm
# Implementation of algorithm
# Program testing
# Documentation preparation

==Implementation==
[[Image:TTL npn nand.svg|right|thumb|[[Logical NAND]] algorithm implemented electronically in [[7400 series|7400]] chip]]
Most algorithms are intended to be implemented as [[computer programs]]. However, algorithms are also implemented by other means, such as in a [[biological neural network]] (for example, the [[human brain]] implementing [[arithmetic]] or an insect looking for food), in an [[electrical circuit]], or in a mechanical device.

==Computer algorithms==
[[File:Euclid's algorithm structured blocks 1.png|thumb|right|176px|Flowchart examples of the canonical [[Structured program theorem|Böhm-Jacopini structures]]: the SEQUENCE (rectangles descending the page), the WHILE-DO and the IF-THEN-ELSE. The three structures are made of the primitive conditional GOTO (&lt;tt&gt;IF ''test''=true THEN GOTO step xxx&lt;/tt&gt;) (a diamond), the unconditional GOTO (rectangle), various assignment operators (rectangle), and HALT (rectangle). Nesting of these structures inside assignment-blocks result in complex diagrams (cf Tausworthe 1977:100,114).]]

In [[computer systems]], an algorithm is basically an instance of [[logic]] written in software by software developers, to be effective for the intended "target" computer(s) to produce ''output'' from given (perhaps null) ''input''. An optimal algorithm, even running in old hardware, would produce faster results than a non-optimal (higher [[time complexity]]) algorithm for the same purpose, running in more efficient hardware; that is why algorithms, like computer hardware, are considered technology.

''"Elegant" (compact) programs, "good" (fast) programs '': The notion of "simplicity and elegance" appears informally in [[Donald Knuth|Knuth]] and precisely in [[Gregory Chaitin|Chaitin]]:
:Knuth: ". . .we want ''good'' algorithms in some loosely defined aesthetic sense. One criterion . . . is the length of time taken to perform the algorithm . . .. Other criteria are adaptability of the algorithm to computers, its simplicity and elegance, etc"&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:7&lt;/ref&gt;

:Chaitin: " . . . a program is 'elegant,' by which I mean that it's the smallest possible program for producing the output that it does"&lt;ref&gt;Chaitin 2005:32&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaitin prefaces his definition with: "I'll show you can't prove that a program is 'elegant'"—such proof would solve the [[Halting problem]] (ibid).

''Algorithm versus function computable by an algorithm'': For a given function multiple algorithms may exist. This is true, even without expanding the available instruction set available to the programmer. Rogers observes that "It is . . . important to distinguish between the notion of ''algorithm'', i.e. procedure and the notion of ''function computable by algorithm'', i.e. mapping yielded by the procedure. The same function may have several different algorithms".&lt;ref&gt;Rogers 1987:1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, there may be a tradeoff between goodness (speed) and elegance (compactness)—an elegant program may take more steps to complete a computation than one less elegant. An example that uses Euclid's algorithm appears below.

''Computers (and computors), models of computation'': A computer (or human "computor"&lt;ref&gt;In his essay "Calculations by Man and Machine: Conceptual Analysis" Seig 2002:390 credits this distinction to Robin Gandy, cf Wilfred Seig, et al., 2002 ''Reflections on the foundations of mathematics: Essays in honor of Solomon Feferman'', Association for Symbolic Logic, A. K Peters Ltd, Natick, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a restricted type of machine, a "discrete deterministic mechanical device"&lt;ref&gt;cf Gandy 1980:126, Robin Gandy ''Church's Thesis and Principles for Mechanisms'' appearing on pp. 123–148 in [[Jon Barwise|J. Barwise]] et al. 1980 ''The Kleene Symposium'', North-Holland Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; that blindly follows its instructions.&lt;ref&gt;A "robot": "A computer is a robot that performs any task that can be described as a sequence of instructions." cf Stone 1972:3&lt;/ref&gt; Melzak's and Lambek's primitive models&lt;ref&gt;Lambek's "abacus" is a "countably infinite number of locations (holes, wires etc.) together with an unlimited supply of counters (pebbles, beads, etc). The locations are distinguishable, the counters are not". The holes have unlimited capacity, and standing by is an agent who understands and is able to carry out the list of instructions" (Lambek 1961:295). Lambek references Melzak who defines his Q-machine as "an indefinitely large number of locations . . . an indefinitely large supply of counters distributed among these locations, a program, and an operator whose sole purpose is to carry out the program" (Melzak 1961:283). B-B-J (loc. cit.) add the stipulation that the holes are "capable of holding any number of stones" (p. 46). Both Melzak and Lambek appear in ''The Canadian Mathematical Bulletin'', vol. 4, no. 3, September 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; reduced this notion to four elements: (i) discrete, distinguishable ''locations'', (ii) discrete, indistinguishable ''counters''&lt;ref&gt;If no confusion results, the word "counters" can be dropped, and a location can be said to contain a single "number".&lt;/ref&gt; (iii) an agent, and (iv) a list of instructions that are ''effective'' relative to the capability of the agent.&lt;ref&gt;"We say that an instruction is ''effective'' if there is a procedure that the robot can follow in order to determine precisely how to obey the instruction." (Stone 1972:6)&lt;/ref&gt;

Minsky describes a more congenial variation of Lambek's "abacus" model in his "Very Simple Bases for [[Computability]]".&lt;ref&gt;cf Minsky 1967: Chapter 11 "Computer models" and Chapter 14 "Very Simple Bases for Computability" pp. 255–281 in particular&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minsky machine|Minsky's machine]] proceeds sequentially through its five (or six, depending on how one counts) instructions, unless either a conditional IF–THEN GOTO or an unconditional GOTO changes program flow out of sequence. Besides HALT, Minsky's machine includes three ''assignment'' (replacement, substitution)&lt;ref&gt;cf Knuth 1973:3.&lt;/ref&gt; operations: ZERO (e.g. the contents of location replaced by 0: L ← 0), SUCCESSOR (e.g. L ← L+1), and DECREMENT (e.g. L ← L − 1).&lt;ref&gt;But always preceded by IF–THEN to avoid improper subtraction.&lt;/ref&gt; Rarely must a programmer write "code" with such a limited instruction set. But Minsky shows (as do Melzak and Lambek) that his machine is [[Turing complete]] with only four general ''types'' of instructions: conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment/replacement/substitution, and HALT.&lt;ref&gt;However, a few different assignment instructions (e.g. DECREMENT, INCREMENT, and ZERO/CLEAR/EMPTY for a Minsky machine) are also required for Turing-completeness; their exact specification is somewhat up to the designer. The unconditional GOTO is a convenience; it can be constructed by initializing a dedicated location to zero e.g. the instruction " Z ← 0 "; thereafter the instruction IF Z=0 THEN GOTO xxx is unconditional.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Simulation of an algorithm: computer (computor) language'': Knuth advises the reader that "the best way to learn an algorithm is to try it . . . immediately take pen and paper and work through an example".&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:4&lt;/ref&gt; But what about a simulation or execution of the real thing? The programmer must translate the algorithm into a language that the simulator/computer/computor can ''effectively'' execute. Stone gives an example of this: when computing the roots of a quadratic equation the computor must know how to take a square root. If they don't, then the algorithm, to be effective, must provide a set of rules for extracting a square root.&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1972:5. Methods for extracting roots are not trivial: see [[Methods of computing square roots]].&lt;/ref&gt;

This means that the programmer must know a "language" that is effective relative to the target computing agent (computer/computor).

But what model should be used for the simulation? Van Emde Boas observes "even if we base [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]] on abstract instead of concrete machines, arbitrariness of the choice of a model remains. It is at this point that the notion of ''simulation'' enters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Leeuwen| first = Jan| title = Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science: Algorithms and complexity. Volume A| url = https://books.google.com/?id=-X39_rA3VSQC| year = 1990| publisher = Elsevier| isbn = 978-0-444-88071-0 | page = 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; When speed is being measured, the instruction set matters. For example, the subprogram in Euclid's algorithm to compute the remainder would execute much faster if the programmer had a "[[modular arithmetic|modulus]]" instruction available rather than just subtraction (or worse: just Minsky's "decrement").

''Structured programming, canonical structures'': Per the [[Church–Turing thesis]], any algorithm can be computed by a model known to be [[Turing complete]], and per Minsky's demonstrations, Turing completeness requires only four instruction types—conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment, HALT. Kemeny and Kurtz observe that, while "undisciplined" use of unconditional GOTOs and conditional IF-THEN GOTOs can result in "[[spaghetti code]]", a programmer can write structured programs using only these instructions; on the other hand "it is also possible, and not too hard, to write badly structured programs in a structured language".&lt;ref&gt;[[John G. Kemeny]] and [[Thomas E. Kurtz]] 1985 ''Back to Basic: The History, Corruption, and Future of the Language'', Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc. Reading, MA, {{ISBN|0-201-13433-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tausworthe augments the three [[Structured program theorem|Böhm-Jacopini canonical structures]]:&lt;ref&gt;Tausworthe 1977:101&lt;/ref&gt; SEQUENCE, IF-THEN-ELSE, and WHILE-DO, with two more: DO-WHILE and CASE.&lt;ref&gt;Tausworthe 1977:142&lt;/ref&gt; An additional benefit of a structured program is that it lends itself to [[proof of correctness|proofs of correctness]] using [[mathematical induction]].&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973 section 1.2.1, expanded by Tausworthe 1977 at pages 100ff and Chapter 9.1&lt;/ref&gt;

''Canonical flowchart symbols&lt;ref&gt;cf Tausworthe 1977&lt;/ref&gt;'': The graphical aide called a [[flowchart]], offers a way to describe and document an algorithm (and a computer program of one). Like the program flow of a Minsky machine, a flowchart always starts at the top of a page and proceeds down. Its primary symbols are only four: the directed arrow showing program flow, the rectangle (SEQUENCE, GOTO), the diamond (IF-THEN-ELSE), and the dot (OR-tie). The Böhm–Jacopini canonical structures are made of these primitive shapes. Sub-structures can "nest" in rectangles, but only if a single exit occurs from the superstructure. The symbols, and their use to build the canonical structures are shown in the diagram.

===Algorithm example===
[[File:Sorting quicksort anim.gif|thumb|right|An animation of the [[quicksort|quicksort algorithm]] sorting an array of randomized values. The red bars mark the pivot element; at the start of the animation, the element farthest to the right-hand side is chosen as the pivot.]]

One of the simplest algorithms is to find the largest number in a list of numbers of random order. Finding the solution requires looking at every number in the list. From this follows a simple algorithm, which can be stated in a high-level description of English prose, as:

''High-level description:''
# If there are no numbers in the set then there is no highest number.
# Assume the first number in the set is the largest number in the set.
# For each remaining number in the set: if this number is larger than the current largest number, consider this number to be the largest number in the set.
# When there are no numbers left in the set to iterate over, consider the current largest number to be the largest number of the set.

''(Quasi-)formal description:''
Written in prose but much closer to the high-level language of a computer program, the following is the more formal coding of the algorithm in [[pseudocode]] or [[pidgin code]]:

{{algorithm-begin|name=LargestNumber}}
   Input: A list of numbers ''L''.
   Output: The largest number in the list ''L''.

   '''if''' ''L.size'' = 0 '''return''' null
   ''largest'' ← ''L''[0]
   '''for each''' ''item'' '''in''' ''L'', '''do'''
     '''if''' ''item'' &gt; ''largest'', '''then'''
       ''largest'' ← ''item''
   '''return''' ''largest''
{{algorithm-end}}

===Euclid's algorithm===
{{further|Euclid's algorithm}}
[[File:Euclid's algorithm Book VII Proposition 2 2.png|250px|thumb|left|The example-diagram of Euclid's algorithm from T.L. Heath (1908), with more detail added. Euclid does not go beyond a third measuring and gives no numerical examples. Nicomachus gives the example of 49 and 21: "I subtract the less from the greater; 28 is left; then again I subtract from this the same 21 (for this is possible); 7 is left; I subtract this from 21, 14 is left; from which I again subtract 7 (for this is possible); 7 is left, but 7 cannot be subtracted from 7." Heath comments that "The last phrase is curious, but the meaning of it is obvious enough, as also the meaning of the phrase about ending 'at one and the same number'."(Heath 1908:300).]]

[[Euclid]]'s algorithm to compute the [[greatest common divisor]] (GCD) to two numbers appears as Proposition II in Book VII ("Elementary Number Theory") of his ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Heath 1908:300; Hawking's Dover 2005 edition derives from Heath.&lt;/ref&gt; Euclid poses the problem thus: "Given two numbers not prime to one another, to find their greatest common measure". He defines "A number [to be] a multitude composed of units": a counting number, a positive integer not including zero. To "measure" is to place a shorter measuring length ''s'' successively (''q'' times) along longer length ''l'' until the remaining portion ''r'' is less than the shorter length ''s''.&lt;ref&gt;" 'Let CD, measuring BF, leave FA less than itself.' This is a neat abbreviation for saying, measure along BA successive lengths equal to CD until a point F is reached such that the length FA remaining is less than CD; in other words, let BF be the largest exact multiple of CD contained in BA" (Heath 1908:297)&lt;/ref&gt; In modern words, remainder ''r'' = ''l'' − ''q''×''s'', ''q'' being the quotient, or remainder ''r'' is the "modulus", the integer-fractional part left over after the division.&lt;ref&gt;For modern treatments using division in the algorithm, see Hardy and Wright 1979:180, Knuth 1973:2 (Volume 1), plus more discussion of Euclid's algorithm in Knuth 1969:293–297 (Volume 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

For Euclid's method to succeed, the starting lengths must satisfy two requirements: (i) the lengths must not be zero, AND (ii) the subtraction must be “proper”; i.e., a test must guarantee that the smaller of the two numbers is subtracted from the larger (alternately, the two can be equal so their subtraction yields zero).

Euclid's original proof adds a third requirement: the two lengths must not be prime to one another. Euclid stipulated this so that he could construct a [[reductio ad absurdum]] proof that the two numbers' common measure is in fact the ''greatest''.&lt;ref&gt;Euclid covers this question in his Proposition 1.&lt;/ref&gt; While Nicomachus' algorithm is the same as Euclid's, when the numbers are prime to one another, it yields the number "1" for their common measure. So, to be precise, the following is really Nicomachus' algorithm.

[[File:Euclids-algorithm-example-1599-650.gif|350px|thumb|right|A graphical expression of Euclid's algorithm to find the greatest common divisor for 1599 and 650.
&lt;source lang="text" highlight="1,5"&gt;
 1599 = 650×2 + 299
 650 = 299×2 + 52
 299 = 52×5 + 39
 52 = 39×1 + 13
 39 = 13×3 + 0&lt;/source&gt;]]

====Computer language for Euclid's algorithm====
Only a few instruction ''types'' are required to execute Euclid's algorithm—some logical tests (conditional GOTO), unconditional GOTO, assignment (replacement), and subtraction.
* A ''location'' is symbolized by upper case letter(s), e.g. S, A, etc.
* The varying quantity (number) in a location is written in lower case letter(s) and (usually) associated with the location's name. For example, location L at the start might contain the number ''l'' = 3009.

====An inelegant program for Euclid's algorithm====
[[File:Euclid's algorithm Inelegant program 1.png|thumb|163px|right|"Inelegant" is a translation of Knuth's version of the algorithm with a subtraction-based remainder-loop replacing his use of division (or a "modulus" instruction). Derived from Knuth 1973:2–4. Depending on the two numbers "Inelegant" may compute the g.c.d. in fewer steps than "Elegant".]]

The following algorithm is framed as Knuth's four-step version of Euclid's and Nicomachus', but, rather than using division to find the remainder, it uses successive subtractions of the shorter length ''s'' from the remaining length ''r'' until ''r'' is less than ''s''. The high-level description, shown in boldface, is adapted from Knuth 1973:2–4:

'''INPUT''':
 {{vanchor|1|el1}} [Into two locations L and S put the numbers ''l'' and ''s'' that represent the two lengths]:
   INPUT L, S
 {{vanchor|2|el2}} [Initialize R: make the remaining length ''r'' equal to the starting/initial/input length ''l'']:
   R ← L

'''E0: [Ensure ''r'' ≥ ''s''.]'''
 {{vanchor|3|el3}} [Ensure the smaller of the two numbers is in S and the larger in R]:
   IF R &gt; S THEN
     the contents of L is the larger number so skip over the exchange-steps [[#4|4]], [[#5|5]] and [[#6|6]]:
     GOTO step [[#6|6]]
   ELSE
     swap the contents of R and S.
 {{vanchor|4|el4}}   L ← R (this first step is redundant, but is useful for later discussion).
 {{vanchor|5|el5}}   R ← S
 {{vanchor|6|el6}}   S ← L

'''E1: [Find remainder]''': Until the remaining length ''r'' in R is less than the shorter length ''s'' in S, repeatedly subtract the measuring number ''s'' in S from the remaining length ''r'' in R.
 {{vanchor|7|el7}} IF S &gt; R THEN
     done measuring so
     GOTO [[#10|10]]
   ELSE
     measure again,
 {{vanchor|8|el8}}   R ← R − S
 {{vanchor|9|el9}}   [Remainder-loop]:
     GOTO [[#7|7]].

'''E2: [Is the remainder zero?]''': EITHER (i) the last measure was exact, the remainder in R is zero, and the program can halt, OR (ii) the algorithm must continue: the last measure left a remainder in R less than measuring number in S.
 {{vanchor|10|el10}} IF R = 0 THEN
      done so
      GOTO [[#15|step 15]]
    ELSE
      CONTINUE TO [[#11|step 11]],

'''E3: [Interchange ''s'' and ''r'']''': The nut of Euclid's algorithm. Use remainder ''r'' to measure what was previously smaller number ''s''; L serves as a temporary location.
 {{vanchor|11|el11}}  L ← R
 {{vanchor|12|el12}}  R ← S
 {{vanchor|13|el13}}  S ← L
 {{vanchor|14|el14}}  [Repeat the measuring process]:
     GOTO [[#7|7]]

'''OUTPUT''':

 {{vanchor|15|el15}} [Done. S contains the [[greatest common divisor]]]:
    PRINT S

'''DONE''':
 {{vanchor|16|el16}} HALT, END, STOP.

====An elegant program for Euclid's algorithm====
The following version of Euclid's algorithm requires only six core instructions to do what thirteen are required to do by "Inelegant"; worse, "Inelegant" requires more ''types'' of instructions. The flowchart of "Elegant" can be found at the top of this article. In the (unstructured) Basic language, the steps are numbered, and the instruction &lt;source lang="cbmbas" inline&gt;LET [] = []&lt;/source&gt; is the assignment instruction symbolized by ←.
&lt;source lang="cbmbas"&gt;
  5 REM Euclid's algorithm for greatest common divisor
  6 PRINT "Type two integers greater than 0"
  10 INPUT A,B
  20 IF B=0 THEN GOTO 80
  30 IF A &gt; B THEN GOTO 60
  40 LET B=B-A
  50 GOTO 20
  60 LET A=A-B
  70 GOTO 20
  80 PRINT A
  90 END
&lt;/source&gt;
The following version can be used with Object Oriented languages:
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
// Euclid's algorithm for greatest common divisor
integer euclidAlgorithm (int A, int B){
     A=Math.abs(A);
     B=Math.abs(B);
     while (B!=0){
          if (A&gt;B) A=A-B;
          else B=B-A;
     }
     return A;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
''How "Elegant" works'': In place of an outer "Euclid loop", "Elegant" shifts back and forth between two "co-loops", an A &gt; B loop that computes A ← A − B, and a B ≤ A loop that computes B ← B − A. This works because, when at last the minuend M is less than or equal to the subtrahend S ( Difference = Minuend − Subtrahend), the minuend can become ''s'' (the new measuring length) and the subtrahend can become the new ''r'' (the length to be measured); in other words the "sense" of the subtraction reverses.

===Testing the Euclid algorithms===
Does an algorithm do what its author wants it to do? A few test cases usually suffice to confirm core functionality. One source&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookVII/propVII2.html |title=Euclid's Elements, Book VII, Proposition 2 |publisher=Aleph0.clarku.edu |date= |accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses 3009 and 884. Knuth suggested 40902, 24140. Another interesting case is the two [[relatively prime]] numbers 14157 and 5950.

But exceptional cases must be identified and tested. Will "Inelegant" perform properly when R &gt; S, S &gt; R, R = S? Ditto for "Elegant": B &gt; A, A &gt; B, A = B? (Yes to all). What happens when one number is zero, both numbers are zero? ("Inelegant" computes forever in all cases; "Elegant" computes forever when A = 0.) What happens if ''negative'' numbers are entered? Fractional numbers? If the input numbers, i.e. the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of the function computed by the algorithm/program, is to include only positive integers including zero, then the failures at zero indicate that the algorithm (and the program that [[instance (computer science)|instantiates]] it) is a [[partial function]] rather than a [[total function]]. A notable failure due to exceptions is the [[Ariane 5 Flight 501]] rocket failure (June 4, 1996).

''Proof of program correctness by use of mathematical induction'': Knuth demonstrates the application of [[mathematical induction]] to an "extended" version of Euclid's algorithm, and he proposes "a general method applicable to proving the validity of any algorithm".&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:13–18. He credits "the formulation of algorithm-proving in terms of assertions and induction" to R. W. Floyd, Peter Naur, C. A. R. Hoare, H. H. Goldstine and J. von Neumann. Tausworth 1977 borrows Knuth's Euclid example and extends Knuth's method in section 9.1 ''Formal Proofs'' (pages 288–298).&lt;/ref&gt; Tausworthe proposes that a measure of the complexity of a program be the length of its correctness proof.&lt;ref&gt;Tausworthe 1997:294&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measuring and improving the Euclid algorithms===
''Elegance (compactness) versus goodness (speed)'': With only six core instructions, "Elegant" is the clear winner, compared to "Inelegant" at thirteen instructions. However, "Inelegant" is ''faster'' (it arrives at HALT in fewer steps). [[Algorithm analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;cf Knuth 1973:7 (Vol. I), and his more-detailed analyses on pp. 1969:294–313 (Vol II).&lt;/ref&gt; indicates why this is the case: "Elegant" does ''two'' conditional tests in every subtraction loop, whereas "Inelegant" only does one. As the algorithm (usually) requires many loop-throughs, ''on average'' much time is wasted doing a "B = 0?" test that is needed only after the remainder is computed.

''Can the algorithms be improved?'': Once the programmer judges a program "fit" and "effective"—that is, it computes the function intended by its author—then the question becomes, can it be improved?

The compactness of "Inelegant" can be improved by the elimination of five steps. But Chaitin proved that compacting an algorithm cannot be automated by a generalized algorithm;&lt;ref&gt;Breakdown occurs when an algorithm tries to compact itself. Success would solve the [[Halting problem]].&lt;/ref&gt; rather, it can only be done [[heuristic]]ally; i.e., by exhaustive search (examples to be found at [[Busy beaver]]), trial and error, cleverness, insight, application of [[inductive reasoning]], etc. Observe that steps 4, 5 and 6 are repeated in steps 11, 12 and 13. Comparison with "Elegant" provides a hint that these steps, together with steps 2 and 3, can be eliminated. This reduces the number of core instructions from thirteen to eight, which makes it "more elegant" than "Elegant", at nine steps.

The speed of "Elegant" can be improved by moving the "B=0?" test outside of the two subtraction loops. This change calls for the addition of three instructions (B = 0?, A = 0?, GOTO). Now "Elegant" computes the example-numbers faster; whether this is always the case for any given A, B, and R, S would require a detailed analysis.

==Algorithmic analysis==
{{Main|Analysis of algorithms}}
It is frequently important to know how much of a particular resource (such as time or storage) is theoretically required for a given algorithm. Methods have been developed for the [[analysis of algorithms]] to obtain such quantitative answers (estimates); for example, the sorting algorithm above has a time requirement of O(''n''), using the [[big O notation]] with ''n'' as the length of the list. At all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values: the largest number found so far, and its current position in the input list. Therefore, it is said to have a space requirement of ''O(1)'', if the space required to store the input numbers is not counted, or O(''n'') if it is counted.

Different algorithms may complete the same task with a different set of instructions in less or more time, space, or '[[algorithmic efficiency|effort]]' than others. For example, a [[binary search]] algorithm (with cost O(log n) ) outperforms a sequential search (cost O(n) ) when used for [[lookup table|table lookups]] on sorted lists or arrays.

===Formal versus empirical===
{{Main|Empirical algorithmics|Profiling (computer programming)|Program optimization}}
The [[analysis of algorithms|analysis, and study of algorithms]] is a discipline of [[computer science]], and is often practiced abstractly without the use of a specific [[programming language]] or implementation. In this sense, algorithm analysis resembles other mathematical disciplines in that it focuses on the underlying properties of the algorithm and not on the specifics of any particular implementation. Usually [[pseudocode]] is used for analysis as it is the simplest and most general representation. However, ultimately, most algorithms are usually implemented on particular hardware/software platforms and their [[algorithmic efficiency]] is eventually put to the test using real code. For the solution of a "one off" problem, the efficiency of a particular algorithm may not have significant consequences (unless n is extremely large) but for algorithms designed for fast interactive, commercial or long life scientific usage it may be critical. Scaling from small n to large n frequently exposes inefficient algorithms that are otherwise benign.

Empirical testing is useful because it may uncover unexpected interactions that affect performance. [[Benchmark (computing)|Benchmarks]] may be used to compare before/after potential improvements to an algorithm after program optimization.
Empirical tests cannot replace formal analysis, though, and are not trivial to perform in a fair manner.&lt;ref name="KriegelSchubert2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kriegel|first1=Hans-Peter|authorlink=Hans-Peter Kriegel|last2=Schubert|first2=Erich|last3=Zimek|first3=Arthur|authorlink3=Arthur Zimek|title=The (black) art of run-time evaluation: Are we comparing algorithms or implementations?|journal=Knowledge and Information Systems|volume=52|issue=2|year=2016|pages=341–378|issn=0219-1377|doi=10.1007/s10115-016-1004-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Execution efficiency ===
{{Main|Algorithmic efficiency}}
To illustrate the potential improvements possible even in well-established algorithms, a recent significant innovation, relating to [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]] algorithms (used heavily in the field of image processing), can decrease processing time up to 1,000 times for applications like medical imaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Better Math Makes Faster Data Networks| author=Gillian Conahan| date=January 2013| url=http://discovermagazine.com/2013/jan-feb/34-better-math-makes-faster-data-networks#.URAnVieX98F| publisher=discovermagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, speed improvements depend on special properties of the problem, which are very common in practical applications.&lt;ref name="Hassanieh12"&gt;Haitham Hassanieh, [[Piotr Indyk]], Dina Katabi, and Eric Price, "[http://siam.omnibooksonline.com/2012SODA/data/papers/500.pdf ACM-SIAM Symposium On Discrete Algorithms (SODA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704180806/http://siam.omnibooksonline.com/2012SODA/data/papers/500.pdf |date=July 4, 2013 }}, Kyoto, January 2012. See also the [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/netmit/sFFT/ sFFT Web Page].&lt;/ref&gt; Speedups of this magnitude enable computing devices that make extensive use of image processing (like digital cameras and medical equipment) to consume less power.

== Classification ==
There are various ways to classify algorithms, each with its own merits.

=== By implementation ===
One way to classify algorithms is by implementation means.

; Recursion
: A [[recursive algorithm]] is one that invokes (makes reference to) itself repeatedly until a certain condition (also known as termination condition) matches, which is a method common to [[functional programming]]. [[Iteration|Iterative]] algorithms use repetitive constructs like [[Program loops|loops]] and sometimes additional data structures like [[Stack (data structure)|stacks]] to solve the given problems. Some problems are naturally suited for one implementation or the other. For example, [[towers of Hanoi]] is well understood using recursive implementation. Every recursive version has an equivalent (but possibly more or less complex) iterative version, and vice versa.
; Logical
: An algorithm may be viewed as controlled [[Deductive reasoning|logical deduction]]. This notion may be expressed as: ''Algorithm = logic + control''.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski 1979&lt;/ref&gt; The logic component expresses the axioms that may be used in the computation and the control component determines the way in which deduction is applied to the axioms. This is the basis for the [[logic programming]] paradigm. In pure logic programming languages, the control component is fixed and algorithms are specified by supplying only the logic component. The appeal of this approach is the elegant [[Formal semantics of programming languages|semantics]]: a change in the axioms produces a well-defined change in the algorithm.
; Serial, parallel or distributed
: Algorithms are usually discussed with the assumption that computers execute one instruction of an algorithm at a time. Those computers are sometimes called serial computers. An [[algorithm design]]ed for such an environment is called a serial algorithm, as opposed to [[parallel algorithm]]s or [[distributed algorithms]]. Parallel algorithms take advantage of computer architectures where several processors can work on a problem at the same time, whereas distributed algorithms utilize multiple machines connected with a [[computer network]]. Parallel or distributed algorithms divide the problem into more symmetrical or asymmetrical subproblems and collect the results back together. The resource consumption in such algorithms is not only processor cycles on each processor but also the communication overhead between the processors. Some sorting algorithms can be parallelized efficiently, but their communication overhead is expensive. Iterative algorithms are generally parallelizable. Some problems have no parallel algorithms and are called inherently serial problems.
; Deterministic or non-deterministic
: [[Deterministic algorithm]]s solve the problem with exact decision at every step of the algorithm whereas [[non-deterministic algorithm]]s solve problems via guessing although typical guesses are made more accurate through the use of [[heuristics]].
; Exact or approximate
: While many algorithms reach an exact solution, [[approximation algorithm]]s seek an approximation that is closer to the true solution. The approximation can be reached by either using a deterministic or a random strategy. Such algorithms have practical value for many hard problems. One of the examples of an approximate algorithm is the [[Knapsack problem]]. The Knapsack problem is a problem where there is a set of given items. The goal of the problem is to pack the knapsack to get the maximum total value. Each item has some weight and some value. Total weight that we can carry is no more than some fixed number X. So, we must consider weights of items as well as their value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540402862|title=Knapsack Problems {{!}} Hans Kellerer {{!}} Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Quantum algorithm]]
: They run on a realistic model of [[quantum computation]]. The term is usually used for those algorithms which seem inherently quantum, or use some essential feature of [[Quantum computing]] such as [[quantum superposition]] or [[quantum entanglement]].

=== By design paradigm ===
Another way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or paradigm. There is a certain number of paradigms, each different from the other. Furthermore, each of these categories includes many different types of algorithms. Some common paradigms are:

; [[Brute force search|Brute-force]] or exhaustive search
: This is the naive method of trying every possible solution to see which is best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Carroll| first1 = Sue| last2 = Daughtrey| first2 = Taz| title = Fundamental Concepts for the Software Quality Engineer| url = https://books.google.com/?id=bz_cl3B05IcC&amp;pg=PA282| date = July 4, 2007| publisher = American Society for Quality| isbn = 978-0-87389-720-4| pages = 282 et seq. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Divide and conquer
: A [[divide and conquer algorithm]] repeatedly reduces an instance of a problem to one or more smaller instances of the same problem (usually [[recursion|recursively]]) until the instances are small enough to solve easily. One such example of divide and conquer is [[mergesort|merge sorting]]. Sorting can be done on each segment of data after dividing data into segments and sorting of entire data can be obtained in the conquer phase by merging the segments. A simpler variant of divide and conquer is called a ''decrease and conquer algorithm'', that solves an identical subproblem and uses the solution of this subproblem to solve the bigger problem. Divide and conquer divides the problem into multiple subproblems and so the conquer stage is more complex than decrease and conquer algorithms. An example of the decrease and conquer algorithm is the [[binary search algorithm]].
; Search and enumeration
: Many problems (such as playing [[chess]]) can be modeled as problems on [[graph theory|graphs]]. A [[graph exploration algorithm]] specifies rules for moving around a graph and is useful for such problems. This category also includes [[search algorithm]]s, [[branch and bound]] enumeration and [[backtracking]].
;[[Randomized algorithm]]
: Such algorithms make some choices randomly (or pseudo-randomly). They can be very useful in finding approximate solutions for problems where finding exact solutions can be impractical (see heuristic method below). For some of these problems, it is known that the fastest approximations must involve some [[randomness]].&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the [[volume]] of a [[convex polytope]] (described using a membership oracle) can be approximated to high accuracy by a randomized polynomial time algorithm, but not by a deterministic one: see {{citation

# [[Monte Carlo algorithm]]s return a correct answer with high-probability. E.g. [[RP (complexity)|RP]] is the subclass of these that run in [[polynomial time]].
# [[Las Vegas algorithm]]s always return the correct answer, but their running time is only probabilistically bound, e.g. [[Zero-error Probabilistic Polynomial time|ZPP]].
; [[Reduction (complexity)|Reduction of complexity]]
: This technique involves solving a difficult problem by transforming it into a better-known problem for which we have (hopefully) [[asymptotically optimal]] algorithms. The goal is to find a reducing algorithm whose [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] is not dominated by the resulting reduced algorithm's. For example, one [[selection algorithm]] for finding the median in an unsorted list involves first sorting the list (the expensive portion) and then pulling out the middle element in the sorted list (the cheap portion). This technique is also known as ''[[Transform and conquer algorithm|transform and conquer]]''.
; [[Back tracking]]
: In this approach, multiple solutions are built incrementally and abandoned when it is determined that they cannot lead to a valid full solution.

=== Optimization problems ===

For [[optimization problem]]s there is a more specific classification of algorithms; an algorithm for such problems may fall into one or more of the general categories described above as well as into one of the following:

; [[Linear programming]]
: When searching for optimal solutions to a linear function bound to linear equality and inequality constraints, the constraints of the problem can be used directly in producing the optimal solutions. There are algorithms that can solve any problem in this category, such as the popular [[simplex algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;
[[George B. Dantzig]] and Mukund N. Thapa. 2003. ''Linear Programming 2: Theory and Extensions''. Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; Problems that can be solved with linear programming include the [[maximum flow problem]] for directed graphs. If a problem additionally requires that one or more of the unknowns must be an [[integer]] then it is classified in [[integer programming]]. A linear programming algorithm can solve such a problem if it can be proved that all restrictions for integer values are superficial, i.e., the solutions satisfy these restrictions anyway. In the general case, a specialized algorithm or an algorithm that finds approximate solutions is used, depending on the difficulty of the problem.
; [[Dynamic programming]]
: When a problem shows [[optimal substructure]]s – meaning the optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems – and [[overlapping subproblems]], meaning the same subproblems are used to solve many different problem instances, a quicker approach called ''dynamic programming'' avoids recomputing solutions that have already been computed. For example, [[Floyd–Warshall algorithm]], the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a weighted [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] can be found by using the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices. Dynamic programming and [[memoization]] go together. The main difference between dynamic programming and divide and conquer is that subproblems are more or less independent in divide and conquer, whereas subproblems overlap in dynamic programming. The difference between dynamic programming and straightforward recursion is in caching or memoization of recursive calls. When subproblems are independent and there is no repetition, memoization does not help; hence dynamic programming is not a solution for all complex problems. By using memoization or maintaining a [[Mathematical table|table]] of subproblems already solved, dynamic programming reduces the exponential nature of many problems to polynomial complexity.
; The greedy method
: A [[greedy algorithm]] is similar to a dynamic programming algorithm in that it works by examining substructures, in this case not of the problem but of a given solution. Such algorithms start with some solution, which may be given or have been constructed in some way, and improve it by making small modifications. For some problems they can find the optimal solution while for others they stop at [[local optimum|local optima]], that is, at solutions that cannot be improved by the algorithm but are not optimum. The most popular use of greedy algorithms is for finding the minimal spanning tree where finding the optimal solution is possible with this method. [[Huffman coding|Huffman Tree]], [[kruskal's algorithm|Kruskal]], [[Prim's algorithm|Prim]], [[Sollin's algorithm|Sollin]] are greedy algorithms that can solve this optimization problem.
;The heuristic method
:In [[optimization problem]]s, [[heuristic algorithm]]s can be used to find a solution close to the optimal solution in cases where finding the optimal solution is impractical. These algorithms work by getting closer and closer to the optimal solution as they progress. In principle, if run for an infinite amount of time, they will find the optimal solution. Their merit is that they can find a solution very close to the optimal solution in a relatively short time. Such algorithms include [[local search (optimization)|local search]], [[tabu search]], [[simulated annealing]], and [[genetic algorithm]]s. Some of them, like simulated annealing, are non-deterministic algorithms while others, like tabu search, are deterministic. When a bound on the error of the non-optimal solution is known, the algorithm is further categorized as an [[approximation algorithm]].

=== By field of study ===
{{See also|List of algorithms}}
Every field of science has its own problems and needs efficient algorithms. Related problems in one field are often studied together. Some example classes are [[search algorithm]]s, [[sorting algorithm]]s, [[merge algorithm]]s, [[numerical analysis|numerical algorithms]], [[graph theory|graph algorithms]], [[string algorithms]], [[computational geometry|computational geometric algorithms]], [[combinatorial|combinatorial algorithms]], [[medical algorithm]]s, [[machine learning]], [[cryptography]], [[data compression]] algorithms and [[parsing|parsing techniques]].

Fields tend to overlap with each other, and algorithm advances in one field may improve those of other, sometimes completely unrelated, fields. For example, dynamic programming was invented for optimization of resource consumption in industry but is now used in solving a broad range of problems in many fields.

=== By complexity ===
{{See also|Complexity class| Parameterized complexity}}
Algorithms can be classified by the amount of time they need to complete compared to their input size:

* Constant time: if the time needed by the algorithm is the same, regardless of the input size. E.g. an access to an [[Array data structure|array]] element.
* Linear time: if the time is proportional to the input size. E.g. the traverse of a list.
* Logarithmic time: if the time is a logarithmic function of the input size. E.g. [[binary search algorithm]].
* Polynomial time: if the time is a power of the input size. E.g. the [[bubble sort]] algorithm has quadratic time complexity.
* Exponential time: if the time is an exponential function of the input size. E.g. [[Brute-force search]].

Some problems may have multiple algorithms of differing complexity, while other problems might have no algorithms or no known efficient algorithms. There are also mappings from some problems to other problems. Owing to this, it was found to be more suitable to classify the problems themselves instead of the algorithms into equivalence classes based on the complexity of the best possible algorithms for them.

== Continuous algorithms ==
The adjective "continuous" when applied to the word "algorithm" can mean:
* An algorithm operating on data that represents continuous quantities, even though this data is represented by discrete approximations—such algorithms are studied in [[numerical analysis]]; or
* An algorithm in the form of a [[differential equation]] that operates continuously on the data, running on an [[analog computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Tsypkin| title = Adaptation and learning in automatic systems| url = https://books.google.com/?id=sgDHJlafMskC&amp;pg=PA54| year = 1971| publisher = Academic Press| isbn = 978-0-08-095582-7| page = 54 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal issues ==
{{see also|Software patent}}

Algorithms, by themselves, are not usually patentable. In the United States, a claim consisting solely of simple manipulations of abstract concepts, numbers, or signals does not constitute "processes" (USPTO 2006), and hence algorithms are not patentable (as in [[Gottschalk v. Benson]]). However practical applications of algorithms are sometimes patentable. For example, in [[Diamond v. Diehr]], the application of a simple [[feedback]] algorithm to aid in the curing of [[synthetic rubber]] was deemed patentable. The [[Software patent debate|patenting of software]] is highly controversial, and there are highly criticized patents involving algorithms, especially [[data compression]] algorithms, such as [[Unisys]]' [[Graphics Interchange Format#Unisys and LZW patent enforcement|LZW patent]].

Additionally, some cryptographic algorithms have export restrictions (see [[export of cryptography]]).

== History: Development of the notion of "algorithm" ==

=== Ancient Near East ===
Algorithms were used in ancient Greece. Two examples are the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]], which was described in [[Introduction to Arithmetic]] by [[Nicomachus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.wichita.edu/history/men/eratosthenes.html|title=Eratosthenes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooke2005/&gt;{{rp|Ch 9.2}} and the [[Euclidean algorithm]], which was first described in [[Euclid's Elements]] (c. 300 BC).&lt;ref name=Cooke2005/&gt;{{rp|Ch 9.1}} [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian clay tablets]] describe and employ algorithmic procedures to compute the time and place of significant astronomical events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Aaboe | first = Asger | author-link = Asger Aaboe | date = 2001 | title = Episodes from the Early History of Astronomy | publisher = Springer | place = New York | pages = 40–62 | isbn = 0-387-95136-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discrete and distinguishable symbols ===
'''Tally-marks''': To keep track of their flocks, their sacks of grain and their money the ancients used tallying: accumulating stones or marks scratched on sticks or making discrete symbols in clay. Through the Babylonian and Egyptian use of marks and symbols, eventually [[Roman numerals]] and the [[abacus]] evolved (Dilson, p.&amp;nbsp;16–41). Tally marks appear prominently in [[unary numeral system]] arithmetic used in [[Turing machine]] and [[Post–Turing machine]] computations.

=== Manipulation of symbols as "place holders" for numbers: algebra ===
The work of the ancient [[Greek mathematics|Greek geometers]] ([[Euclidean algorithm]]), the [[List of Indian mathematicians|Indian mathematician]] [[Brahmagupta]], and the [[List of Iranian mathematicians|Persian mathematician]] [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|Al-Khwarizmi]] (from whose name the terms "[[algorism]]" and "algorithm" are derived), and Western European mathematicians culminated in [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s notion of the [[calculus ratiocinator]] (ca 1680):
{{quote|A good century and a half ahead of his time, Leibniz proposed an algebra of logic, an algebra that would specify the rules for manipulating logical concepts in the manner that ordinary algebra specifies the rules for manipulating numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2000:18&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Mechanical contrivances with discrete states ===
''The clock'': Bolter credits the invention of the weight-driven [[clock]] as "The key invention [of Europe in the Middle Ages]", in particular, the [[verge escapement]]&lt;ref&gt;Bolter 1984:24&lt;/ref&gt; that provides us with the tick and tock of a mechanical clock. "The accurate automatic machine"&lt;ref&gt;Bolter 1984:26&lt;/ref&gt; led immediately to "mechanical [[automata theory|automata]]" beginning in the 13th century and finally to "computational machines"—the [[difference engine]] and [[analytical engine]]s of [[Charles Babbage]] and Countess [[Ada Lovelace]], mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bolter 1984:33–34, 204–206.&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelace is credited with the first creation of an algorithm intended for processing on a computer – Babbage's analytical engine, the first device considered a real [[Turing-complete]] computer instead of just a [[calculator]] – and is sometimes called "history's first programmer" as a result, though a full implementation of Babbage's second device would not be realized until decades after her lifetime.

''Logical machines 1870—[[Stanley Jevons]]' "logical abacus" and "logical machine"'': The technical problem was to reduce [[Boolean equation]]s when presented in a form similar to what is now known as [[Karnaugh map]]s. Jevons (1880) describes first a simple "abacus" of "slips of wood furnished with pins, contrived so that any part or class of the [logical] combinations can be picked out mechanically . . . More recently, however, I have reduced the system to a completely mechanical form, and have thus embodied the whole of the indirect process of inference in what may be called a ''Logical Machine''" His machine came equipped with "certain moveable wooden rods" and "at the foot are 21 keys like those of a piano [etc] . . .". With this machine he could analyze a "[[syllogism]] or any other simple logical argument".&lt;ref&gt;All quotes from W. Stanley Jevons 1880 ''Elementary Lessons in Logic: Deductive and Inductive'', Macmillan and Co., London and New York. Republished as a googlebook; cf Jevons 1880:199–201. Louis Couturat 1914 ''the Algebra of Logic'', The Open Court Publishing Company, Chicago and London. Republished as a googlebook; cf Couturat 1914:75–76 gives a few more details; he compares this to a typewriter as well as a piano. Jevons states that the account is to be found at January 20, 1870 ''The Proceedings of the Royal Society''.&lt;/ref&gt;

This machine he displayed in 1870 before the Fellows of the Royal Society.&lt;ref&gt;Jevons 1880:199–200&lt;/ref&gt; Another logician [[John Venn]], however, in his 1881 ''Symbolic Logic'', turned a jaundiced eye to this effort: "I have no high estimate myself of the interest or importance of what are sometimes called logical machines ... it does not seem to me that any contrivances at present known or likely to be discovered really deserve the name of logical machines"; see more at [[Algorithm characterizations]]. But not to be outdone he too presented "a plan somewhat analogous, I apprehend, to Prof. Jevon's ''abacus'' ... [And] [a]gain, corresponding to Prof. Jevons's logical machine, the following contrivance may be described. I prefer to call it merely a logical-diagram machine ... but I suppose that it could do very completely all that can be rationally expected of any logical machine".&lt;ref&gt;All quotes from John Venn 1881 ''Symbolic Logic'', Macmillan and Co., London. Republished as a googlebook. cf Venn 1881:120–125. The interested reader can find a deeper explanation in those pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jacquard loom, Hollerith punch cards, telegraphy and telephony—the electromechanical relay'': Bell and Newell (1971) indicate that the [[Jacquard loom]] (1801), precursor to [[Hollerith cards]] (punch cards, 1887), and "telephone switching technologies" were the roots of a tree leading to the development of the first computers.&lt;ref&gt;Bell and Newell diagram 1971:39, cf. Davis 2000&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-19th century the [[telegraph]], the precursor of the telephone, was in use throughout the world, it's discrete and distinguishable encoding of letters as "dots and dashes" a common sound. By the late 19th century the [[ticker tape]] (ca 1870s) was in use, as was the use of Hollerith cards in the 1890 U.S. census. Then came the [[teleprinter]] (ca. 1910) with its punched-paper use of [[Baudot code]] on tape.

''Telephone-switching networks'' of electromechanical [[relay]]s (invented 1835) was behind the work of [[George Stibitz]] (1937), the inventor of the digital adding device. As he worked in Bell Laboratories, he observed the "burdensome' use of mechanical calculators with gears. "He went home one evening in 1937 intending to test his idea... When the tinkering was over, Stibitz had constructed a binary adding device".&lt;ref&gt;* Melina Hill, Valley News Correspondent, ''A Tinkerer Gets a Place in History'', Valley News West Lebanon NH, Thursday, March 31, 1983, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis (2000) observes the particular importance of the electromechanical relay (with its two "binary states" ''open'' and ''closed''):
: It was only with the development, beginning in the 1930s, of electromechanical calculators using electrical relays, that machines were built having the scope Babbage had envisioned."&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2000:14&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics during the 19th century up to the mid-20th century ===
''Symbols and rules'': In rapid succession, the mathematics of [[George Boole]] (1847, 1854), [[Gottlob Frege]] (1879), and [[Giuseppe Peano]] (1888–1889) reduced arithmetic to a sequence of symbols manipulated by rules. Peano's ''The principles of arithmetic, presented by a new method'' (1888) was "the first attempt at an axiomatization of mathematics in a symbolic language".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:81ff&lt;/ref&gt;

But Heijenoort gives Frege (1879) this kudos: Frege's is "perhaps the most important single work ever written in logic. ... in which we see a " 'formula language', that is a ''lingua characterica'', a language written with special symbols, "for pure thought", that is, free from rhetorical embellishments ... constructed from specific symbols that are manipulated according to definite rules".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort's commentary on Frege's ''Begriffsschrift, a formula language, modeled upon that of arithmetic, for pure thought'' in van Heijenoort 1967:1&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Frege was further simplified and amplified by [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] in their [[Principia Mathematica]] (1910–1913).

''The paradoxes'': At the same time a number of disturbing paradoxes appeared in the literature, in particular, the [[Burali-Forti paradox]] (1897), the [[Russell paradox]] (1902–03), and the [[Richard Paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1906, cf. Kleene 1952:36–40&lt;/ref&gt; The resultant considerations led to [[Kurt Gödel]]'s paper (1931)—he specifically cites the paradox of the liar—that completely reduces rules of [[recursion]] to numbers.

''Effective calculability'': In an effort to solve the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] defined precisely by Hilbert in 1928, mathematicians first set about to define what was meant by an "effective method" or "effective calculation" or "effective calculability" (i.e., a calculation that would succeed). In rapid succession the following appeared: [[Alonzo Church]], [[Stephen Kleene]] and [[J. B. Rosser]]'s [[λ-calculus]]&lt;ref&gt;cf. footnote in Alonzo Church 1936a in Davis 1965:90 and 1936b in Davis 1965:110&lt;/ref&gt; a finely honed definition of "general recursion" from the work of Gödel acting on suggestions of [[Jacques Herbrand]] (cf. Gödel's Princeton lectures of 1934) and subsequent simplifications by Kleene.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1935–6 in Davis 1965:237ff, Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:255ff&lt;/ref&gt; Church's proof&lt;ref&gt;Church 1936 in Davis 1965:88ff&lt;/ref&gt; that the Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable, [[Emil Post]]'s definition of effective calculability as a worker mindlessly following a list of instructions to move left or right through a sequence of rooms and while there either mark or erase a paper or observe the paper and make a yes-no decision about the next instruction.&lt;ref&gt;cf. "Finite Combinatory Processes&amp;mdash;formulation 1", Post 1936 in Davis 1965:289–290&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Turing's proof of that the Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable by use of his "a- [automatic-] machine"&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:116ff&lt;/ref&gt;—in effect almost identical to Post's "formulation", [[J. Barkley Rosser]]'s definition of "effective method" in terms of "a machine".&lt;ref&gt;Rosser 1939 in Davis 1965:226&lt;/ref&gt; [[S. C. Kleene]]'s proposal of a precursor to "[[Church thesis]]" that he called "Thesis I",&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:273–274&lt;/ref&gt; and a few years later Kleene's renaming his Thesis "Church's Thesis"&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:300, 317&lt;/ref&gt; and proposing "Turing's Thesis".&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:376&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emil Post (1936) and Alan Turing (1936–37, 1939) ===
Here is a remarkable coincidence{{According to whom|date=March 2017}} of two men not knowing each other but describing a process of men-as-computers working on computations—and they yield virtually identical definitions.

[[Emil Post]] (1936) described the actions of a "computer" (human being) as follows:
:"...two concepts are involved: that of a ''symbol space'' in which the work leading from problem to answer is to be carried out, and a fixed unalterable ''set of directions''.

His symbol space would be
:"a two-way infinite sequence of spaces or boxes... The problem solver or worker is to move and work in this symbol space, being capable of being in, and operating in but one box at a time.... a box is to admit of but two possible conditions, i.e., being empty or unmarked, and having a single mark in it, say a vertical stroke.

:"One box is to be singled out and called the starting point. ...a specific problem is to be given in symbolic form by a finite number of boxes [i.e., INPUT] being marked with a stroke. Likewise, the answer [i.e., OUTPUT] is to be given in symbolic form by such a configuration of marked boxes...

:"A set of directions applicable to a general problem sets up a deterministic process when applied to each specific problem. This process terminates only when it comes to the direction of type (C ) [i.e., STOP]".&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:289–290&lt;/ref&gt; See more at [[Post–Turing machine]]
[[File:Alan Turing.jpg|thumb|200px|Alan Turing's statue at [[Bletchley Park]]]]
[[Alan Turing]]'s work&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936 in Davis 1965, Turing 1939 in Davis 1965:160&lt;/ref&gt; preceded that of Stibitz (1937); it is unknown whether Stibitz knew of the work of Turing. Turing's biographer believed that Turing's use of a typewriter-like model derived from a youthful interest: "Alan had dreamt of inventing typewriters as a boy; Mrs. Turing had a typewriter, and he could well have begun by asking himself what was meant by calling a typewriter 'mechanical'".&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, p.&amp;nbsp;96&lt;/ref&gt; Given the prevalence of Morse code and telegraphy, ticker tape machines, and teletypewriters we{{Who|date=March 2017}} might conjecture that all were influences.

Turing—his model of computation is now called a [[Turing machine]]—begins, as did Post, with an analysis of a human computer that he whittles down to a simple set of basic motions and "states of mind". But he continues a step further and creates a machine as a model of computation of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7:116&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper. We may suppose this paper is divided into squares like a child's arithmetic book...I assume then that the computation is carried out on one-dimensional paper, i.e., on a tape divided into squares. I shall also suppose that the number of symbols which may be printed is finite...

:"The behavior of the computer at any moment is determined by the symbols which he is observing, and his "state of mind" at that moment. We may suppose that there is a bound B to the number of symbols or squares which the computer can observe at one moment. If he wishes to observe more, he must use successive observations. We will also suppose that the number of states of mind which need be taken into account is finite...

:"Let us imagine that the operations performed by the computer to be split up into 'simple operations' which are so elementary that it is not easy to imagine them further divided."&lt;ref name="Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:136"&gt;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:136&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing's reduction yields the following:
:"The simple operations must therefore include:
::"(a) Changes of the symbol on one of the observed squares
::"(b) Changes of one of the squares observed to another square within L squares of one of the previously observed squares.
"It may be that some of these change necessarily invoke a change of state of mind. The most general single operation must, therefore, be taken to be one of the following:
::"(A) A possible change (a) of symbol together with a possible change of state of mind.
::"(B) A possible change (b) of observed squares, together with a possible change of state of mind"

:"We may now construct a machine to do the work of this computer."&lt;ref name="Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:136"/&gt;

A few years later, Turing expanded his analysis (thesis, definition) with this forceful expression of it:
:"A function is said to be "effectively calculable" if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process. Though it is fairly easy to get an intuitive grasp of this idea, it is nevertheless desirable to have some more definite, mathematical expressible definition . . . [he discusses the history of the definition pretty much as presented above with respect to Gödel, Herbrand, Kleene, Church, Turing, and Post] . . . We may take this statement literally, understanding by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine. It is possible to give a mathematical description, in a certain normal form, of the structures of these machines. The development of these ideas leads to the author's definition of a computable function, and to an identification of computability † with effective calculability . . . .
::"† We shall use the expression "computable function" to mean a function calculable by a machine, and we let "effectively calculable" refer to the intuitive idea without particular identification with any one of these definitions".&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1939 in Davis 1965:160&lt;/ref&gt;

=== J. B. Rosser (1939) and S. C. Kleene (1943) ===
[[J. Barkley Rosser]] defined an 'effective [mathematical] method' in the following manner (italicization added):
:"'Effective method' is used here in the rather special sense of a method each step of which is precisely determined and which is certain to produce the answer in a finite number of steps. With this special meaning, three different precise definitions have been given to date. [his footnote #5; see discussion immediately below]. The simplest of these to state (due to Post and Turing) says essentially that ''an effective method of solving certain sets of problems exists if one can build a machine which will then solve any problem of the set with no human intervention beyond inserting the question and (later) reading the answer''. All three definitions are equivalent, so it doesn't matter which one is used. Moreover, the fact that all three are equivalent is a very strong argument for the correctness of any one." (Rosser 1939:225–6)

Rosser's footnote No. 5 references the work of (1) Church and Kleene and their definition of λ-definability, in particular Church's use of it in his ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory'' (1936); (2) Herbrand and Gödel and their use of recursion in particular Gödel's use in his famous paper ''On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I'' (1931); and (3) Post (1936) and Turing (1936–37) in their mechanism-models of computation.

[[Stephen C. Kleene]] defined as his now-famous "Thesis I" known as the [[Church–Turing thesis]]. But he did this in the following context (boldface in original):
:"12. ''Algorithmic theories''... In setting up a complete algorithmic theory, what we do is to describe a procedure, performable for each set of values of the independent variables, which procedure necessarily terminates and in such manner that from the outcome we can read a definite answer, "yes" or "no," to the question, "is the predicate value true?"" (Kleene 1943:273)

=== History after 1950 ===
A number of efforts have been directed toward further refinement of the definition of "algorithm", and activity is on-going because of issues surrounding, in particular, [[foundations of mathematics]] (especially the [[Church–Turing thesis]]) and [[philosophy of mind]] (especially arguments about [[artificial intelligence]]).

{{italic title}}
'''''Analysis Situs''''' is a book by the [[Princeton University|Princeton]] mathematician [[Oswald Veblen]], published in 1922. It is based on his 1916 lectures at the Cambridge Colloquium of the [[American Mathematical Society]]. The book, which went into a second edition in 1931, was the first English-language [[textbook]] on [[topology]], and served for many years as the standard reference for the domain. Its contents were based on the work of [[Henri Poincaré]] as well as Veblen's own work with his former student and colleague, [[James Waddell Alexander II|James Alexander]].{{sfnp|Hodge|1961|p=508}}

Among the many innovations in the book was the first definition of a [[topological manifold]],{{sfnp|Scholz|1999|p=}} and systematisations of [[Betti number]], [[Whitehead torsion|torsion]], the [[fundamental group]], and the [[topological spaces|topological classification problem]].{{sfnp|Batterson|2007|p=608}}

'''Attentional control''' refers to an individual's capacity to choose what they pay [[attention]] to and what they ignore.&lt;ref name="Astle_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Astle | first1 = D. E. | last2 = Scerif | first2 = G. | year = 2009 | title = Using Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience to Study Behavioral and Attentional Control | url = | journal = Developmental Psychobiology | volume = 51 | issue = 2| pages = 107–118 | doi = 10.1002/dev.20350 | pmid = 18973175 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also known as [[endogeny|endogenous]] attention or [[executive functions|executive]] attention. In lay terms, attentional control can be described as an individual's ability to concentrate. Primarily mediated by the [[frontal lobes|frontal]] areas of the brain including the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], attentional control is thought to be closely related to other [[executive functions]] such as [[working memory]].&lt;ref name="posner_peterson_1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Posner | first1 = M.

==General overview of research==
Sources of attention in our brain create a system of three networks: [[alertness]] (maintaining awareness), orientation (information from sensory input), and executive control (resolving conflict).&lt;ref name="posner_peterson_1990" /&gt; These three networks have been studied using experimental designs involving adults, children, and monkeys, with and without abnormalities of attention.&lt;ref name="Fan 2002 340–347"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fan|first=Jan|author2=Et. al.|title=Testing the Efficiency and Interdependence of Attenional Networks|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|year=2002|volume=14|issue=3|pages=340–347|doi=10.1162/089892902317361886|pmid=11970796}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research designs include the [[Stroop effect|Stroop task]]
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Markman|first=Art|title=Disgust, Morality, and Attention|journal=Ulterior Motives|date=11 September 2012|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ulterior-motives/201209/disgust-morality-and-attention|accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eriksen flanker task|flanker task]], which study executive control with analysis techniques including event-related [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional magnetic resonance image]] (fMRI). While some research designs focus specifically on one aspect of attention (such as executive control), others experiments view several areas, which examine interactions between the alerting, orienting, and executive control networks.&lt;ref name="Fan 2002 340–347"/&gt; More recently, the Attention Network Test (ANT), designed by Fan and Posner, has been used to obtain efficiency measures of the three networks, and allow their relationships to be examined. It was designed as a behavioural task simple enough to obtain data from children, patients, and animals.&lt;ref name="Fan 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fan|first=J.|author2=McCandliss, B. |author3=Sommer, T. |author4=Raz, A. |author5=Posner, M. |title=Testing the efficiency and independence of attentional networks|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=2002|volume=14|issue=3|pages=340–347|doi=10.1162/089892902317361886 |pmid=11970796}}&lt;/ref&gt; The task requires participants to quickly respond to cues given on a computer screen, while having their attention fixated on a center target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adólfsdóttir|first=Steinunn|author2=Et. al.|title=The Attention Network Test: A Characteristic Pattern of Deficits in Children with ADHD|journal=Behavioral and Brain Functions|year=2008|url=http://www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com/content/4/1/9|accessdate=20 October 2012|doi=10.1186/1744-9081-4-9|volume=4|pages=9|pmid=18269768|pmc=2265730|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
{{see also|Neurobiological effects of physical exercise#Cognitive control and memory}}

===Infancy===
Early researchers studying the development of the [[frontal cortex]] thought that it was functionally silent during the first year of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Wolfe | first2 = C. D. | year = 2007 | title = Changes in brain functioning from infancy to early childhood: Evidence from EEG power and coherence during working memory tasks | url = | journal = Developmental Neuropsychology | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 21–38 | doi = 10.1207/s15326942dn3101_2 | pmid = 17305436 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, early research suggested that infants aged one year or younger are completely passive in the allocation of their attention, and have no capacity to choose what they pay attention to and what they ignore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Colombo | first1 = J | year = 2001 | title = The development of visual attention in infancy | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 337–367 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.337 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is shown, for example, in the phenomenon of 'sticky fixation', whereby infants are incapable of disengaging their attention from a particularly [[Salience (neuroscience)|salient]] target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hood | first1 = B. M. | last2 = Atkinson | first2 = J. | year = 1993 | title = DISENGAGING VISUAL-ATTENTION IN THE INFANT AND ADULT | url = | journal = Infant Behavior &amp; Development | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 405–422 | doi=10.1016/0163-6383(93)80001-o}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has suggested, however, that even very young infants do have some capacity to exercise control over their allocation of attention, albeit in a much more limited sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = M. H. | year = 1995 | title = THE INHIBITION OF AUTOMATIC SACCADES IN EARLY INFANCY | url = | journal = Developmental Psychobiology | volume = 28 | issue = 5| pages = 281–291 | doi=10.1002/dev.420280504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Colombo | first1 = J. | last2 = Cheatham | first2 = C. L. | year = 2006 | title = The emergence and basis of endogenous attention in infancy and early childhood | url = | journal = Advances in Child Development and Behavior | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 283–322 | doi=10.1016/s0065-2407(06)80010-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood===
As the [[frontal lobes]] mature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gogtay | first1 = N. | last2 = Giedd | first2 = J. N. | last3 = Lusk | first3 = L. | last4 = Hayashi | first4 = K. M. | last5 = Greenstein | first5 = D. | last6 = Vaituzis | first6 = A. C. | last7 = Nugent Iii | first7 = T. F. | last8 = Herman | first8 = D. H. | last9 = Clasen | first9 = L.

C. | last2 = Amso | first2 = D. | last3 = Cruess Anderson | first3 = L. | last4 = Diamond | first4 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Development of cognitive control and executive functions from 4 to 13 years: Evidence from manipulations of memory, inhibition, and task switching | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 44 | issue = 11| pages = 2037–2078 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.02.006 | pmid = 16580701 | pmc = 1513793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some children show impaired development of attentional control abilities, thought to arise from the relatively slower development of frontal areas of the brain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shaw | first1 = P. Lerch | last2 = Greenstein | first2 = D. | last3 = Sharp | first3 = W. | last4 = Clasen | first4 = L. | last5 = Evans | first5 = A. | last6 = Giedd | first6 = J. | last7 = Xavier Castellanos | first7 = F. | last8 = Rapoport | first8 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Longitudinal Mapping of Cortical Thickness and Clinical Outcome in Children and Adolescents With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder | url = | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 540–549 | doi=10.1001/archpsyc.63.5.540 | pmid=16651511}}&lt;/ref&gt; which sometimes results in a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

===Elderly===
Some studies of aging and cognition focus on working memory processes and declines in attentional control. One study used fMRI measures during a Stroop task comparing neural activity of attentional control in younger (21–27 years) and older participants (60–75 years). Conditions included increased competition and increased conflict. Results showed evidence of decreases in responsiveness in brain areas associated with attentional control for the older group. This result suggests that older people may have decreases in their ability to utilize attentional control in their everyday lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milham|first=M.|author2=Erickson, K. |author3=Banich, M. |author4=Kramer, A. |author5=Webb, A. |author6=Wszalek, T. |author7=Cohen, N. |title=Attentional control in the aging brain: Insights from an fMRI study of the stroop task|journal=Brain Cogn.|date=2002|volume=49|issue=3|pages=277–296 |doi=10.1006/brcg.2001.1501}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Banich 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Banich|first=M.|title=Executive function: The search for an integrated account|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=2009|volume=18|pages=89–94|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01615.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abnormal development==

Disrupted attentional control has been noted not just in the early development of conditions for which the core deficit is related to attention such as ADHD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sonuga-Barke | first1 = E. J. S. | last2 = Koerting | first2 = J. | last3 = Smith | first3 = E. | last4 = McCann | first4 = D.

A. | last2 = Nix | first2 = R. L. | last3 = Blair | first3 = C. | last4 = Bierman | first4 = K. L. | last5 = Nelson | first5 = K.

The patterns of disrupted attentional control relate to findings of disrupted performance on [[executive functions]] tasks such as [[working memory]] across a wide number of different disorder groups.&lt;ref name="Astle_2009" /&gt; The question of why the [[executive functions]] appear to be disrupted across so many different disorder groups remains, however, poorly understood.

===Relevance to mental illness===
Studies have shown that there is a high probability that those who suffer from low attentional control also experience other mental conditions.

Attention problems are also characteristic of anxiety disorders like PTSD. Attentional bias causes a person to processes emotionally negative information preferentially over emotionally positive information. Participants were selected after being measured on scales for PTSD, anxiety proneness, attentional control, and attentional bias. Results indicated attentional control was inversely related to attentional bias. PTSD patients with higher attentional control exhibited less attentional bias. Individual differences in attentional control had an effect on anxiety problems in PTSD.&lt;ref name="Schoorl 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schoorl|first=M. |author2=Putman, P. |author3=Van Der Werff, S. |author4=Van Der Does A. |title=Attentional bias and attentional control in posttraumatic stress disorder|journal=Journal of Anxiety Disorders|date=2014|volume=28|pages=203–210|doi=10.1016/j.janxdis.2013.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Performance===

Attentional control theory focuses on anxiety and cognitive performance. The assumption of this theory is that the effects of anxiety on attentional control are key to understanding the relationship between anxiety and performance. In general, anxiety inhibits attentional control on a specific task by impairing processing efficiency.&lt;ref name="Eysenck 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eysenck|first=M.|author2=Kerakshan, N. |author3=Santos, R. |author4=Galvo, M. |title=Anxiety and cognitive performance: Attentional control theory|journal=Emotion|date=2007|volume=7|issue=2|pages=336–353 |doi=10.1037/1528-3542.7.2.336}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three functions associated with this theory. The inhibition function prevents stimuli unrelated to a task and responses from disrupting performance. The shifting function is used to allocate attention to the stimuli that are most relevant to the task. The updating function is used to update and monitor information in working memory.&lt;ref name="Eysenck 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miyake 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miyake|first=A.|author2=Priedman, N. |author3=Emerson, M. |author4=Witzki, A. |author5=Howerter, A. |title=The unity and diversity of executive functions and their contributions to complex "frontal lobe" tasks: A latent variable analysis|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=2000|volume=41|pages=49–100 |doi=10.1006/cogp.1999.0734 |pmid=10945922 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three main hypotheses associated with attentional control theory. First, the efficiency of the central executive is impaired by anxiety. Second, anxiety impairs the inhibition function, and third, anxiety impairs the shifting function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eysenck|first=M.|author2=Derakshan, N.|title=New perspectives in attentional control theory|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=2011|volume=50|pages=955–960|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2010.08.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	Studies related to attentional control and performance take two differing approaches. Specifically, research on attentional capture has two modes: voluntary and reflexive. The voluntary mode is a top down approach where attention is shifted according to high-level cognitive processes. The reflexive mode is a bottom up approach where attention shifts involuntarily based on a stimulus’s attention attracting properties.&lt;ref name="Pashler 2001" /&gt; These modes are important to understanding how attentional control works.

===Mindfulness===
Even four days of [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] meditation training can significantly improve visuo-spatial processing, working memory and executive functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chiesa|first=A.|author2=Serretti, A.|title=A systematic review of neurobiological and clinical features of mindfulness meditations|journal=Psychological Medicine|date=27 November 2009|volume=40|issue=8|pages=1239–1252|doi=10.1017/S0033291709991747|pmid=19941676}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeidan|first=Fadel|author2=Johnson, Susan K.|author3= Diamond, Bruce J.|author4= David, Zhanna|author5= Goolkasian, Paula|title=Mindfulness meditation improves cognition: Evidence of brief mental training|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|date=1 June 2010|volume=19|issue=2|pages=597–605|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2010.03.014|pmid=20363650}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research has indicated that mindfulness does not affect attentional control directly. Participants did tasks of sustained attention, inhibition, switching, and object detection. These tasks were done before and after an 8-week mindfulness based stress reduction course (MBSR), and were compared to a control group. There were no significant differences between the groups, meaning that the MBSR course did not affect attentional control.&lt;ref name="Anderson 2007" /&gt; Mindfulness influences non-directed attention and other things like emotional well-being.&lt;ref name="Anderson 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=N.|author2=Lau, M. |author3=Segal, Z. |author4=Bishop, S. |title=Mindfulness-based stress reduction and attentional control|journal=Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy|date=2007|volume=14|pages=449–463 |doi=10.1002/cpp.544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning===
[[Modularity of mind|Modular]] approaches view cognitive development as a [[mosaic]]-like process, according to which [[cognitive]] faculties develop separately according to genetically predetermined maturational timetables. Prominent authors who take a modular approach to cognitive development include [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Elizabeth Spelke]] and [[Steven Pinker]]. In contrast, other authors such as [[Annette Karmiloff-Smith]], [[Mark H. Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]] and [http://psych.indiana.edu/faculty/smith4.php Linda Smith] have instead advocated taking a more [[interactive specialization|interactive]] or [[dynamical systems]] approaches to cognitive development. According to these approaches, which are known as [[neuroconstructivism|neuroconstructivist]] approaches, cognitive systems interact over developmental time as certain cognitive faculties are required for the subsequent acquisition of other faculties in other areas.

Amongst authors who take [[neuroconstructivism|neuroconstructivist]] approaches to development, particular importance has been attached to attentional control, since it is thought to be a domain-general process that may influence the subsequent acquisition of other skills in other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scerif | first1 = G. | year = 2010| title = Attention trajectories, mechanisms and outcomes: at the interface between developing cognition and environment | url = | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 805–812 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2010.01013.x | pmid = 20977552 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to regulate and direct attention releases the child from the constraints of only responding to environmental events, and means they are able actively to guide their attention towards the information-rich areas key for [[learning]]. For example, a number of authors have looked at the relationship between an infants' capacity to exercise attentional control and their subsequent performance during [[language acquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kannass | first1 = K. N. | last2 = Oakes | first2 = L. M. | year = 2008 | title = The development of attention and its relations to language in infancy and toddlerhood | url = | journal = Journal of Cognition and Development | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 222–246 | doi=10.1080/15248370802022696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rose | first1 = S.

Working memory capacity has been studied to understand how memory functions. The ability to predict the effectiveness of someone’s working memory capacity comes from attentional control mechanisms. These mechanisms help with the regulation of goals, behavior, and outside distractions, which are all important for effective learning.&lt;ref name="McVay 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McVay|first=J.|author2=Kane, M.|title=Conducting the train of thought: Working memory capacity, goal neglect, and mind wandering in an executive-control task|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=2009|volume=35|issue=1|pages=196–204|doi=10.1037/a0014104|pmid=19210090|pmc=2750806}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson-Riegler|first=Bridget|title=Cognitive psychology: Applying the science of the mind|date=2011|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-0-205-05006-2|pages=130–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Visual Attentional Control}} Visual attentional control==
Our brains have distinct [[attention]] systems that have been shaped throughout time by evolution. Visual [[attention]] operates mainly on three different representations: location&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Siegel M, Donner TH, Oostenveld R, Fries P, Engel AK |title=Neuronal synchronization along the dorsal visual pathway reflects the focus of spatial attention |journal=[[Neuron (journal)|Neuron]] |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=709–719 |date=Mar 2008 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2008.09.010 |pmid=19038226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People can selectively pay attention to one of two objects in the same general location.&lt;ref name="Egeth 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Egeth|first=H.|author2=Yantis, S.|title=Visual attention: Control, representation, and time course|journal=Annu.

When directing attention to a feature like motion, neuronal activity increases in areas specific for the feature. When visually searching for a non-spatial feature or a perceptual feature, selectively enhancing the sensitivity to that specific feature plays a role in directing attention.&lt;ref name="Reynolds 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=J.|author2=Chelazzi, L.|title=Attentional modulation of visual processing|journal=Annu.

According to [[fMRI]] studies of the brain and behavioral observations, visual attention can be moved independently of moving eye position. Studies have had participants fixate their eyes on a central point and measured brain activity as stimuli were presented outside the visual [[Fixation (visual)|fixation]] point. [[fMRI]] findings show changes in brain activity correlated with the shift in spatial attention to the various stimuli. Behavioral studies have also shown that when a person knows where a stimulus is likely to appear, their attention can shift to it more rapidly and process it better.&lt;ref name="Bear"&gt;Bear, Connors, Paradiso, Mark, Barry, Michael (2007). Neuroscience Exploring the Brain. Baltimore, MD: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins. {{ISBN|9780781760034}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have demonstrated that perceptual and [[cognitive load]] affect spatial focusing of [[attention]].  These two mechanisms interact oppositely so that when cognitive load is decreased, perceptual load must be high to increase spatial attention focusing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Linnell|first=Karina J.|author2=Serge Caparos|title=Perceptual and Cognitive Load interact to Control the Spatial Focus of Attention|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|date=18 July 2011|volume=37|series=5|pages=1643–1648|pmid=21767051|issue=5|doi=10.1037/a0024669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auditory alertness==
The [[cocktail party effect]] is the phenomenon that a person hears his or her name even when not attending to the conversation. To study this, a screening measure for attentional control was given that tested a person’s ability to keep track of words while also doing math problems. Participants were separated into two groups---low and high span attentional control ability groups. They listened to two word lists read simultaneously by a male and a female voice and were told to ignore the male voice. Their name was read by the “ignored” male voice. Low span people were more likely to hear their name compared to high span people. This result suggests that people with lower attentional control ability have more trouble inhibiting information from the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name="Conway 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conway|first=A.|author2=Cowan, N. |author3=Bunting, M. |title=The cocktail party phenomenon revisited: The importance of WM capacity|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|date=2001|volume=8|pages=331–335|doi=10.3758/bf03196169|pmid=11495122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Buddhism-simple}}
'''''Āyatana''''' ([[Pāli]]; [[Sanskrit]]: आयतन) is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term that has been translated as "sense base", "sense-media" or "sense sphere."&lt;ref&gt;"Sense base" is used for instance by Bodhi (2000b) and Soma (1999).  "Sense-media" is used by Thanissaro (e.g., cf. [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.149.than.html Thanissaro, 1998c]).  "Sense sphere" is used for instance by VRI (1996) and suggested by [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:2840.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921–5), p. 105], whose third definition for ''Āyatana'' is: 
:sphere of perception or sense in general, object of thought, sense-organ &amp; object; relation, order. – [Aung &amp; Rhys Davids (1910),] p. 183 says rightly: 'āyatana cannot be rendered by a single English word to cover both sense-organs (the mind being regarded as 6th sense) and sense objects'. – These āyatanāni (relations, functions, reciprocalities) are thus divided into two groups, inner (ajjhattikāni) and outer (bāhirāni)....&lt;/ref&gt;  In Buddhism, there are six ''internal'' sense bases (Pali: ''ajjhattikāni āyatanāni''; also known as, "organs", "gates", "doors", "powers" or "roots"&lt;ref name="pine102"&gt;Pine 2004, pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;) and six ''external'' sense bases (''bāhirāni āyatanāni'' or "sense objects"; also known as ''vishaya'' or "domains"&lt;ref name="pine103"&gt;Pine 2004, pg. 103&lt;/ref&gt;). Thus, there are six internal-external (organ-object) pairs of sense bases:&lt;ref&gt;One may ''logically'' deduce from the existence of six internal sense bases and six external sense bases that there are a total of twelve ''individual'' sense bases; the Pali canon, however, never references "twelve" sense bases per se, e.g., see MN 137: ''"[S]a{{IAST|ḷ}}āyatanavibhaṅgaṃ vo, bhikkhave, desessāmi.... Cha  ajjhattikāni āyatanāni veditabbāni, cha bāhirāni āyatanāni veditabbāni...."''  Also see MN 148, 149, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

:* eye and [[rupa (Buddhism)|visible objects]]&lt;ref&gt;The Pāli word translated here as "visible objects" is ''[[rūpa]]''. In terms of the Buddhist notion of the sense bases, rūpa refers to ''visual'' objects (or objects knowable by the eye through light).  This should not be confused with the use of the word rūpa in terms of the Buddhist notion of [[skandha|aggregates]] where rūpa refers to ''all'' material objects, both of the world and the body.  Thus, when comparing these two uses of rūpa, the rūpa aggregate (''rūpakkhandha'') includes the rūpa sense-object (''rūpāyatana'') as well as the four other material sense-objects (sound, odor, taste and touch).&lt;/ref&gt;
:* ear and sound
:* nose and odor
:* tongue and taste
:* body and touch
:* mind&lt;ref name="mano"&gt;The Pāli word translated here as "mind" is ''mano''.  Other common translations include "intellect" [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.023.than.html (e.g., Thanissaro, 2001a)] and "consciousness" [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.010.soma.html (e.g., Soma, 1999).]  In the [[Suttapitaka]], ''mano'' does not necessarily refer to all mental processing.  Other oft-mentioned complementary mental processes include "consciousness" (''[[viññāṇa]]'') and "mental states" (''citta'').  Nonetheless, in the [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]] and later texts, these terms are at times used synonymously.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dharma (Buddhism)|mental objects]]&lt;ref&gt;The Pāli word translated here as "mental objects" is ''[[Dharma (Buddhism)|dhammā]]''.  Other frequently seen translations include "mental phenomena" (e.g., Bodhi, 2000b, pp. 1135''ff''.), "thoughts," "ideas" [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.023.than.html (e.g., Thanissaro, 2001a)] and "contents of the mind"  (VRI, 1996, p. 39) while some translators simply leave this word untranslated due to its complex overtones in the [[Pali literature]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism and other Indian epistemologies&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton (2001), p. 53, writes: "... six senses, including one relating to non-sensory mental activity, are recognized in Buddhism and other Indian schools of thought...."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pine101"&gt;See also Pine 2004, pg. 101.  Red Pine argues that this scheme probably predates Buddhism, because it has ten external members (ear, sound, nose, odor, tongue, taste, body, touch) corresponding to the single external skandha (form), and only two internal members (mind and thought) corresponding to the four internal skandhas.&lt;/ref&gt; identify six "senses" as opposed to the Western identification of five. In Buddhism, "mind" denotes an internal sense organ which interacts with sense objects that include [[phassa|sense impressions]], [[vedana|feelings]], [[sañña|perceptions]] and [[Saṅkhāra|volition]].&lt;ref name="mano" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Bodhi (2000a), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''{{IAST|Saḷāyatana}}''''' (Pāli; Skt. '''''[[Sadayatana|{{IAST|ṣaḍāyatana}}]]''''') refers to all six sense objects and six sense organs and is generally used in the context of the [[Twelve Nidanas|Twelve Causes (''nidāna'')]] of the chain of [[Pratitya-Samutpada|Dependent Origination]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:3909.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921–5), p. 699.]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Pali Canon==
In the [[Four Noble Truths]], [[the Buddha]] identifies that the origin of suffering (Pali, Skt.: ''[[dukkha]]'') is craving (Pali: ''[[Tanha|{{IAST|taṇhā}}]]''; Skt.: ''{{IAST|tṛṣṇā}}'').  In the chain of [[Twelve Nidanas|Dependent Origination]], the Buddha identifies that craving arises from [[Vedana|sensations]] that result from [[Sparśa|contact]] at the six sense bases.  (See Figure 2 below.)  Therefore, to overcome craving and its resultant suffering, one should develop restraint of and insight into the sense bases.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2005b), starting at time 50:00. Bodhi (2005b) references, for instance, [[Majjhima Nikaya]] Sutta No. 149, where the Buddha instructs:
:"...[K]nowing &amp; seeing the eye as it actually is present, knowing &amp; seeing [visible] forms... consciousness at the eye... contact at the eye as they actually are present, knowing &amp; seeing whatever arises conditioned through contact at the eye – experienced as pleasure, pain, or neither-pleasure-nor-pain – as it actually is present, one is not infatuated with the eye... forms... consciousness at the eye... contact at the eye... whatever arises.... The craving that makes for further becoming – accompanied by passion &amp; delight, relishing now this &amp; now that – is abandoned by him. His bodily disturbances &amp; mental disturbances are abandoned. His bodily torments &amp; mental torments are abandoned. His bodily distresses &amp; mental distresses are abandoned. He is sensitive both to ease of body &amp; ease of awareness..." [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.149.than.html (Thanissaro, 1998c).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, reference to the [[Four Noble Truths]] in this context is redundant as the whole endless cycle of the [[Twelve Nidanas|Twelve Causes]] is a form of [[dukkha|suffering]] and the last two causes, [[Jati (Buddhism)|Birth]] and [[Jaramarana|Old Age &amp; Death]], are ''explicitly'' identified as components of suffering by the Buddha in the Four Noble Truths (for instance, see the [[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta|Dhammacakka Sutta]]).  Nonetheless, Bodhi's formulation here provides a conciseness – both conceptually and, in this diagram, visually – that might otherwise not be as compelling and readily comprehended.&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

Throughout the [[Pali Canon]], the sense bases are referenced in hundreds of discourses.&lt;ref&gt;The greatest concentration of discourses related to the sense bases is in the [[Samyutta Nikaya]], chapter 35, entitled "The Book of the Six Sense Bases" (''{{IAST|Saḷāyatana-vagga}}'').  For instance, in Bodhi (2000b) edition of the Samyutta Nikaya, this chapter alone has 248 discourses.  The Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921–25) entry for [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:2840.pali "Āyatana" (p. 105)] also mentions other discourses in each of the Pali nikayas.&lt;/ref&gt;  In these diverse discourses, the sense bases are contextualized in different ways including:

* '''Sextets''' (Pali: ''chakka''):&lt;br&gt;The sense bases include two sets of six: six sense organs (or internal sense bases) and six sense objects (or external sense bases).  Based on these six pairs of sense bases, a number of mental factors arise.  Thus, for instance, when an ear and sound are present, the associated consciousness (Pali: ''[[Vijñāna|{{IAST|viññāṇa}}]]'') arises.  The arising of these three elements (''dhātu'') – ear, sound and ear-related consciousness – lead to what is known as "contact" (''[[phassa]]'') which in turn causes a pleasant or unpleasant or neutral "feeling" or "sensation" (''[[vedanā]]'') to arise.  It is from such a feeling that "craving" (''{{IAST|[[taṇhā]]}}'') arises.  (See Figure 1.)  Such an enumeration can be found, for instance, in the "Six Sextets" discourse (''Chachakka Sutta'', [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 148), where the "six sextets" (six sense organs, six sense objects, six sense-specific types of consciousness, six sense-specific types of contact, six sense-specific types of sensation and six sense-specific types of craving) are examined and found to be [[anatta|empty of self]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Ñāṇamoli}} &amp; Bodhi (2001), pp. 1129–36; and, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.148.than.html Thanissaro (1998a).]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''"The All"''' (Pali: ''sabba''):&lt;br&gt;In a discourse entitled, "The All" ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 35.23), the Buddha states that there is no "all" outside of the six pairs of sense bases.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000b), p. 1140; and, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.023.than.html  Thanissaro (2001b).] According to Bodhi (2000b), p. 1399, ''n''. 7, the Pali commentary regarding the ''Sabba Sutta'' states: "...[I]f one passes over the twelve sense bases, one cannot point out any real phenomenon."  Also see [https://archive.is/20120707171513/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:3261.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921–25), p. 680, "Sabba" entry] where ''{{IAST|sabbaŋ}}'' is defined as "the (whole) world of sense-experience."&lt;/ref&gt;  In the next codified discourse (SN 35.24), the Buddha elaborates that the All includes the first five aforementioned sextets (sense organs, objects, consciousness, contact and sensations).&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000b), p. 1140; and, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.024.than.html Thanissaro (2001a).]&lt;/ref&gt; References to the All can be found in a number of subsequent discourses.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 35.25 through 35.29, including the famed "Fire Sermon" (SN 35.28).&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the [[Abhidhamma]] and post-canonical Pali literature further conceptualize the sense bases as a means for classifying ''all'' factors of existence.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000b), p. 1122.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Twelve Nidanas|The Twelve Causes]]''' (Pali, Skt.: ''nidāna''):&lt;br&gt;As described in the [[#Related Buddhist concepts|"Related Buddhist concepts"]] section below and illustrated in Figure 2, the sense bases are a critical link in the endless round of rebirth known as the Twelve Causes and as depicted in the [[Bhavacakra|Wheel of Becoming]] (Skt.: ''bhavacakra'').&lt;ref&gt;Note that the Twelve Causes and Six Sextets describe the relationship between the sense bases and consciousness in different ways.  Relatedly, there are canonical discouses that put forth hybrid models of these various psychophysical factors, such as described in "The World Discourse" (''Loka Sutta'', [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 12.44) [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.044.than.html (Thanissaro, 1998b;] and, Bodhi, 2005a, pp.&amp;nbsp;358–59) where the aforementioned six "sextets" (from the eye and form to craving) condition the last four "causes" (clinging, becoming, birth, old age &amp; death) and suffering.  In reference to this and similar "variant" discourses, Bodhi (2005a) notes:
:"These variants make it plain that the sequence of factors should not be regarded as a linear causal process in which each preceding factor gives rise to its successor through the simple exercise of efficient causality. Far from being linear, the relationship among the factors is always complex, involving several interwoven strands of conditionality." (Bodhi, 2005a, p. 316.)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Aflame with lust, hate and delusion" ===

In "The Vipers" discourse (''Asivisa Sutta'', [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 35.197), [[the Buddha]] likens the internal sense bases to an "empty village" and the external sense bases to "village-plundering bandits."  Using this metaphor, the Buddha characterizes the "empty"&lt;ref&gt;In the context of SN 35.197, the term "empty" might simply be meant to convey "passive."  It could also be used in the Buddhist sense of self-less, as in ''[[anatta]]'' (''see''). In fact, in [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 35.85, the Buddha applies this latter notion of emptiness (''[[Shunyata|suññata]]'') to all internal ''and'' external sense bases (Bodhi, 2000b, pp. 1163–64; and  [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.085.than.html Thanissaro, 1997c)].&lt;/ref&gt; sense organs as being "attacked by agreeable &amp; disagreeable" sense objects.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000b), pp. 1237–1239 (where this discourse is identified as SN 35.238); Buddhaghosa (1999), p. 490 (where this discourse is identified as S.iv,175); and, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.197.than.html Thanissaro (2004)].

Similarly, in the last sutta of the Samyutta Nikaya's ''Salayatana-samyutta'', entitled "The Sheaf of Barley" (which Bodhi, 2000b, identifies as SN 35.248 and Thanissaro, 1998d, as SN 35.207), the Buddha describes the sense organs as "struck" or "thrashed" by "agreeable and disagreeable" sense objects (Bodhi, 2000b, pp. 1257–59; [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.207.than.html Thanissaro, 1998d]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere in the same collection of discourses ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 35.191), the Buddha's Great [[Sravaka|Disciple]] [[Sariputta]] clarifies that the actual [[dukkha|suffering]] associated with sense organs and sense objects is not ''inherent'' to these sense bases but is due to the [[Fetter (Buddhism)|"fetters"]] (here identified as "desire and lust") that arise when there is contact between a sense organ and sense object.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000b), pp. 1230–1231 (where this discourse is identified as SN 35.232); and, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.191.than.html Thanissaro (1997b)].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "[[Fire Sermon]]" (''Adittapariyaya Sutta'', [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 35.28), delivered several months after the Buddha's [[bodhi|awakening]], the Buddha describes all sense bases and related mental processes in the following manner:
:"Monks, the All is aflame. What All is aflame? The eye is aflame. [[Rupa (Buddhism)|Forms]] are aflame. [[Vinnana|Consciousness]] at the eye is aflame. [[Phassa|Contact]] at the eye is aflame. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye – experienced as [[Vedana|pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain]] – that too is aflame. Aflame with what? Aflame with the fire of [[Kilesa|passion]], the fire of aversion, the fire of delusion. Aflame, I tell you, with [[Dukkha|birth, aging &amp; death, with sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, &amp; despairs]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.028.than.html Thanissaro, 1993.]  For other references to the sense bases as "the All," see [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.023.than.html Thanissaro (2001b)] and [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.024.than.html Thanissaro (2001a).]  The sense bases are "the All" insomuch that all we know of the world is known through the sense bases.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extinguishing suffering's flame ===

The Buddha taught that, in order to escape the dangers of the sense bases, one must be able to apprehend the sense bases without [[kilesa|defilement]].  In "Abandoning the Fetters" ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 35.54), the Buddha states that one abandons the fetters "when one knows and sees ... as [[impermanence|impermanent]]" (Pali: ''anicca'') the six sense organs, objects, sense-[[vinnana|consciousness]], [[Sparśa|contact]] and [[Vedana|sensations]].&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000b), p. 1148.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in "Uprooting the Fetters" (SN 35.55), the Buddha states that one uproots the fetters "when one knows and sees ... as [[Anatta|nonself]]" (''anatta'') the aforementioned five sextets.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000b), p. 1148. For a correspondence between impermanence and nonself, see [[Three marks of existence]].&lt;/ref&gt;

To foster this type of penetrative knowing and seeing and the resultant release from suffering, in the [[Satipatthana Sutta]] ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 10)  the Buddha instructs monks to meditate on the sense bases and the dependently arising fetters as follows:
:"How, O [[bhikkhus]], does a bhikkhu live contemplating mental object in the mental objects of the six internal and the six external sense-bases?
:"Here, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu understands the eye and material forms and the fetter that arises dependent on both (eye and forms); he understands how the arising of the non-arisen fetter comes to be; he understands how the abandoning of the arisen fetter comes to be; and he understands how the non-arising in the future of the abandoned fetter comes to be. [''In a similar manner:''] He understands the ear and sounds ... the organ of smell and odors ... the organ of taste and flavors ... the organ of touch and tactual objects ... the consciousness and mental objects....
:"Thus he lives contemplating mental object in mental objects ... and [[upadana|clings]] to naught in the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.010.soma.html Soma (1999)], section entitled, "The Six Internal and the Six External Sense-bases."&lt;/ref&gt;

==In post-canonical Pali texts==
The ''[[Vimuttimagga]]'', the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'', and associated [[Atthakatha|Pali commentaries]]&lt;ref&gt;In terms of the Pali commentaries, for instance, there is overlap between the Visuddhimagga and the commentary to the [[Dhammasangani]], ''Atthasālinī'' (e.g., cf. Vsm. XIV,49 [Buddhaghosa, 1999, p. 446] and Asl. 310 [Rhys Davids, 1900, p. 178 n. 2]).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Subcommentaries, Theravada|subcommentaries]] all contribute to traditional knowledge about the sense bases.

===Understanding sense organs===

When the Buddha speaks of "understanding" the eye, ear, nose, tongue and body, what is meant?

According to the first-century CE Sinhalese meditation manual, ''Vimuttimagga'', the sense organs can be understood in terms of the object sensed, the consciousness aroused, the underlying "sensory matter," and an associated [[mahabhuta|primary or derived element]] that is present "in excess."&lt;ref&gt;In regards to defining the sense bases in terms of excess primary elements, the Visuddhimagga (Vsm. XIV, 42) is critical:
:"... Others say that the eye is sensitivity of those [primary elements] that have fire in excess, and that the ear, nose, tongue, and body are [sensitivity] of those [primary elements] that have [respectively] aperture, air, water and earth in excess.  They should be asked to quote a sutta.  They will certainly not find one." (Buddhaghosa, 1999, p. 444, para. 42.)&lt;/ref&gt;  These characteristics are summarized in the table below.

|}

The compendious fifth-century CE ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' provides similar descriptors, such as "the size of a mere louse's head" for the location of the eye's "sensitivity" (Pali: ''pasāda''; also known as, "sentient organ, sense agency, sensitive surface"),&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921–25), p. 446, entry for "Pasāda" (retrieved 2008-04-16 from "U. Chicago" at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:2481.pali).&lt;/ref&gt; and "in the place shaped like a goat's hoof" regarding the nose sensitivity ([[Visuddhimagga|Vsm]]. XIV, 47–52).&lt;ref&gt;Buddhaghosa (1999), pp. 445–6.  While this Visuddhimagga chapter (XIV) actually pertains to the [[Skandha|Five Aggregates]], this characterization is referenced in the Visuddhimagga chapter (XV) on the Sense Bases (Buddhaghosa, 1999, p. 489, verse 8).&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the Visuddhimagga describes the sense organs in terms of the following four factors:
:* characteristic or sign (''lakkha{{IAST|ṇ}}a'')
:* function or "taste" (''rasa'')
:* manifestation (''paccupa{{IAST|ṭṭ}}hāna'')
:* proximate cause (''pada{{IAST|ṭṭ}}hāna'')
Thus, for instance, it describes the eye as follows:
:Herein, the eye's characteristic is sensitivity of [[mahabhuta|primary elements]] that is ready for the impact of visible data; or its characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements originated by [[Karma|kamma]] sourcing from desire to see.  Its function is to pick up [an object] among visible data.  It is manifested as the footing of eye-[[vijnana|consciousness]].  Its proximate cause is primary elements born of kamma sourcing from desire to see.&lt;ref&gt;Vsm. XIV, 37 (trans. Buddhaghosa, 1999, p. 443; square-bracketed text in original).  The Pali (from the Burmese CSCD, retrieved 2008-04-16 from "VRI" at http://www.tipitaka.org/romn/cscd/e0102n.mul2.xml) associated with this passage is:
:{{IAST|Tattha rūpābhighātārahatappasādalakkhaṇaṃ daṭṭhukāmatānidānakammasamuṭṭhānabhūtappasādalakkhaṇaṃ vā cakkhu, rūpesu āviñchanarasaṃ, cakkhuviññāṇassa ādhārabhāvapaccupaṭṭhānaṃ, daṭṭhukāmatānidānakammajabhūtapadaṭṭhānaṃ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to the sixth internal sense base of mind (''mano''), Pali [[Subcommentaries, Theravada|subcommentaries]] (attributed to Dhammapāla Thera) distinguish between consciousness arising from the five physical sense bases and that arising from the primarily post-[[Pali Canon|canonical]] notion of a "life-continuum" or "unconscious mind" (''bhava{{IAST|ṅ}}ga-mana''):&lt;ref&gt;Regarding ''bhava{{IAST|ṅ}}ga'' being a primarily post-canonical concept, see Matthews (1995, p. 128) where he states for instance: "''Bhava{{IAST|ṅ}}ga'' does not occur in the [[Sutta Pitaka]], but its appearance in both the ''[[Dhammasangani|Dhammasa{{IAST|ṅ}}ga{{IAST|ṇ}}i]]'' and the ''[[Patthana|Pa{{IAST|ṭṭ}}hāna]]'' assured that it received much post-classical attention in the Theravāda." He further amplifies this in an endnote (p. 140, ''n''. 34): "... [A]lthough ''bhava{{IAST|ṅ}}ga'' does appear in the [[Abhidhamma Pitaka|Abhidhamma Pi{{IAST|ṭ}}aka]], it is not until the post-classical era that it receives much attention." Citing Ñā{{IAST|ṇ}}amoli and others, Matthews (1995, p. 123) defines the "classical age" as "ended about the 4th century A.D.," just prior to the "great age of [[Atthakatha|commentaries]]."&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Of the consciousness or mind aggregate included in a course of cognition of eye-consciousness, just the eye-base [not the mind-base] is the 'door' of origin, and the [external sense] base of the material form is the visible object.  So it is in the case of the others [that is, the ear, nose, tongue and body sense bases].  But of the sixth sense-base the part of the mind base called the life-continuum, the unconscious mind, is the 'door' of origin...."&lt;ref&gt;Soma (2003), p. 133.  This excerpt is from the subcommentary to the [[Majjhima Nikaya|Majjhima Nikāya]], the ''Līnatthapakāsanā Tīkā''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The roots of wisdom===
In the fifth-century CE exegetical ''Visuddhimagga'', [[Buddhaghosa]] identifies knowing about the sense bases as part of the "soil" of liberating [[Wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]].  Other components of this "soil" include the [[skandha|aggregates]], the [[indriya|faculties]], the [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[Dependent Origination]].&lt;ref&gt;Buddhaghosa &amp; Ñā{{IAST|ṇ}}amoli (1999), pp. 442–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related Buddhist concepts==

*'''[[Skandha|Aggregates]]''' (Pali, ''khandha''; Skt., ''skandha''):&lt;br&gt;In a variety of suttas, the aggregates, elements (''see below'') and sense bases are identified as the "soil" in which [[tanha|craving]] and [[upadana|clinging]] grow.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 35.91 where the Buddha proclaims:
:"Whatever, [[bhikkhu]]s, is the extent of the aggregates, the elements, and the sense bases, [a right-practicing monk] does not conceive that, does not conceive in that, does not conceive from that, does not conceive, 'This is mine.' Since he does not conceive anything thus, he does not cling to anything in the world. Not clinging, he is not agitated.  Being unagitated, he personally attains [[Nirvana (concept)|Nibbāna]]..." (Bodhi, 2000b, p. 1171).&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, in the [[Pali Canon]], the aggregate of material form includes the five material sense organs (eye, ear, nose, tongue and body) and associated sense objects (visible forms, sounds, odors, tastes and tactile objects); the aggregate of consciousness is associated with the sense organ of mind; and, the mental aggregates (sensation, perception, mental formations) are mental sense objects.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Bodhi (2000b), pp. 1122–24. Beyond the five aggregates, ''[[Nibbana]]'' is also identified as a "mental object" perceivable by "mind" (''mano'') (see, for instance, Bodhi, 2000a, p. 288).&lt;/ref&gt;    &lt;br&gt;Both the aggregates and the sense bases are identified as objects of [[Sati (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]] in the [[Satipatthana Sutta]]. In terms of pursuing liberation, meditating on the aggregates eradicates self-doctrine and wrong-view [[upadana|clinging]] while meditating on the sense bases eradicates sense-pleasure clinging.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Bodhi (2000b), pp. 1124–26; and, Bodhi (2005b), starting at time 48:47.  Also see the article on ''[[upadana]]'' for the [[Pali Canon|canonical]] explanation of the four types of clinging: sense-pleasure, wrong-view, rites-and-rituals and self-doctrine.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Pratitya-samutpada|Dependent Origination]]''' (Pali: ''{{IAST|paṭicca-samuppāda}}''; Skt.: ''pratitya-samutpada''):&lt;br&gt;As indicated in Figure 2 above, the six sense bases (Pali: ''{{IAST|saḷāyatana}}''; Skt.: ''{{IAST|ṣaḍāyatana}}'') are the fifth link in the [[Twelve Nidanas|Twelve Causes]] (''nidāna'') of the chain of Dependent Origination and thus likewise are the fifth position on the [[Bhavacakra|Wheel of Becoming]] (''bhavacakra''). The arising of the six sense bases is dependent on the arising of [[namarupa|material and mental objects]] (Pali, Skt.: ''nāmarūpa''); and, the arising of the six sense bases leads to the arising of "[[Sparśa|contact]]" (Pali: ''phassa''; Skt.: ''sparśa'') between the sense bases and [[Vijnana|consciousness]] (Pali: ''{{IAST|viññāṇa}}''; Skt.: ''visjñāna'') which results in pleasant, unpleasant and neutral [[vedana|feelings]] (Pali, Skt.: ''vedanā'').
*'''Elements''' (Pali, Skt.: ''dhātu''):&lt;ref&gt;The Pāli word referenced here as "element," ''dhātu'', is used in multiple contexts in the [[Pali canon|Pāli canon]]. For instance, Bodhi (2000b), pp. 527–8, identifies four different ways that ''dhātu'' is used including in terms of the "eighteen elements" and in terms of "the four primary elements" (''[[mahabhuta|catudhātu]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;The eighteen elements include the twelve sense bases. The eighteen elements are six triads of elements where each triad is composed of a sense object (the external sense bases), a sense organ (the internal sense bases) and the associated sense-organ-consciousness (''{{IAST|viññāṇa}}'').&lt;ref&gt;In Buddhist literature, when a sense object and sense organ make contact (Pali, ''phassa''), sense-consciousness arises.  (See for instance [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 148.)&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, the eighteen elements are made up of the twelve sense bases and the six related sense-consciousnesses.
*'''[[Karma in Buddhism|Karma]]''' (Skt.; Pali: ''kamma''):&lt;br&gt;In a [[Samyutta Nikaya]] discourse, the Buddha declares that the six internal senses bases (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind) are "old kamma, to be seen as generated and fashioned by volition, as something to be felt."&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2005b), pp. 1211–12.  See also [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.145.than.html Thanissaro (1997a).]&lt;/ref&gt;  In this discourse, "new kamma" is described as "whatever action one does now by body, speech, or mind."  In this way, the internal sense bases provide a link between our volitional actions and subsequent perceptions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13912">[[File:Franklin-Benjamin-LOC.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[eponym]] of the effect, [[Benjamin Franklin]]]]

The '''Ben Franklin effect''' is a proposed psychological phenomenon: a person who has already performed a favor for another is more likely to do another favor for the other than if they had ''received'' a favor from that person. An explanation for this is [[cognitive dissonance]]. People reason that they help others ''because'' they like them, even if they do not, because their minds struggle to maintain logical consistency between their actions and perceptions.

The Benjamin Franklin effect, in other words, is the result of one's concept of self coming under attack. Every person develops a persona, and that persona persists because inconsistencies in one's personal narrative get rewritten, redacted, and misinterpreted.&lt;ref name="You are not so smart"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/10/05/the-benjamin-franklin-effect/|title=The Benjamin Franklin Effect|last1=McRaney|first1=David|website=You Are Not So Smart|publisher=You Are Not So Smart|accessdate=15 December 2016|date=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Franklin's observation of effect==
[[Benjamin Franklin]], after whom the effect is named, quoted what he described as an "old maxim" in his autobiography: "He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another, than he whom you yourself have obliged."&lt;ref&gt;From ''[[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin]],'' [http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page48.htm page 48] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118172814/http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page48.htm |date=January 18, 2015 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography, Franklin explains how he dealt with the animosity of a rival legislator when he served in the [[Pennsylvania legislature]] in the 18th century:

{{quote|Having heard that he had in his library a certain very scarce and curious book, I wrote a note to him, expressing my desire of perusing that book, and requesting he would do me the favour of lending it to me for a few days. He sent it immediately, and I return'd it in about a week with another note, expressing strongly my sense of the favour. When we next met in the House, he spoke to me (which he had never done before), and with great civility; and he ever after manifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions, so that we became great friends, and our friendship continued to his death.}}

==Research==
The initial study of the effect was done by Jecker and Landy in 1969; in which students were invited to take part in a Q&amp;A competition run by the researcher in which they could win sums of money. After this competition was over, one-third of the students who had "won" were approached by the researcher, who asked them to return the money on the grounds that he had used his own funds to pay the winners and was running short; another third were asked by a secretary to return the money because it was from the psychology department and funds were low; another third were not approached.  All three groups were then asked how much they liked the researcher. The second group liked him the least, the first group the most – suggesting that a refund request by an intermediary had decreased their liking, while a direct request had increased their liking.&lt;ref name="Changing Minds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/ben_franklin_effect.htm|title=Ben Franklin Effect|website=Changing Minds|accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Liking a Person as a Function of Doing Him a Favour| first1=Jon| last1=Jecker| first2=David| last2=Landy| date=August 1, 1969| journal=Human Relations| volume=22 | issue=4| pages=371–378|doi=10.1177/001872676902200407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, [[University of North Carolina]] psychologists John Schopler and John Compere carried out the following experiment:

:They had their subjects administer learning tests to accomplices pretending to be other students. The subjects were told the learners would watch as the teachers used sticks to tap out long patterns on a series of wooden cubes. The learners would then be asked to repeat the patterns. Each teacher was to try out two different methods on two different people, one at a time. In one run, the teachers would offer encouragement when the learner got the patterns correct. In the other run of the experiment, the teacher insulted and criticized the learner when they erred. Afterward, the teachers filled out a debriefing questionnaire that included questions about how attractive (as a human being, not romantically) and likable the learners were. Across the board, the subjects who received the insults were rated as less attractive than the ones who got encouragement.

In short, the subjects' own conduct toward the accomplices shaped their perception of them – "You tend to like the people to whom you are kind and dislike the people to whom you are rude."&lt;ref name="You are not so smart"/&gt;

Results were mimicked in a more recent but smaller study by psychologist Yu Niiya with Japanese and American subjects.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Niiya|first1=Yu|title=Does a Favor Request Increase Liking Toward the Requester?|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|date=21 September 2015|volume=156|issue=2|pages=211–221|doi=10.1080/00224545.2015.1095706|pmid=26392141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect as an example of cognitive dissonance==
This [[perception]] of Franklin has been cited as an example within [[cognitive dissonance]] theory, which says that people change their attitudes or behavior to resolve tensions, or "dissonance", between their thoughts, attitudes, and actions. In the case of the Ben Franklin effect, the dissonance is between the subject's negative attitudes to the other person and the knowledge that they did that person a favor.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Henry Mussen, Mark R. Rosenzweig &amp; Arthur L. Blumenthal (1979). ''Psychology: an introduction'', p.403. University of Michigan. {{ISBN|0-669-01672-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tavris28"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tavris|first=Carol|authorlink=Carol Tavris|title=Mistakes were made (but not by me)|year=2008|publisher=Pinter and Martin|isbn=978-1-905177-21-9|pages=28–29|author2=Elliot Aronson|title-link=Mistakes were made (but not by me)}}&lt;/ref&gt; One science blogger accounts for the phenomenon in the following way: "Current self-perception theory tells us that our brains behave like an outside observer, continually watching what we do and then contriving explanations for those actions, which subsequently influence our beliefs about ourselves....Our observing brain doesn't like it when our actions don't match the beliefs we have about ourselves, a situation commonly referred to as cognitive dissonance. So, whenever your behavior is in conflict with your beliefs (for example if you do a favor for someone you may not like very much or vice versa, when you do something bad to someone you are supposed to care about), this conflict immediately sets off alarm bells in your brain. The brain has a clever response – it goes about changing how you feel in order to reduce the conflict and turn off the alarms."&lt;ref name="The Science Dog"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ben Franklin Effect|url=https://thesciencedog.wordpress.com/2014/01/28/the-ben-franklin-effect/|accessdate=15 December 2016|date=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative explanations==
Psychologist Yu Niiya attributes the phenomenon to the requestee reciprocating a perceived attempt by the requester to ignite friendly relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lebowitz|first1=Shana|title=Harness the power of the 'Ben Franklin Effect' to get someone to like you|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ben-franklin-effect-2016-12|website=Business Insider|publisher=Business Insider Inc.|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory would explain the Ben Franklin effect's absence when an intermediary is used.

==Uses==

Some have observed that the Ben Franklin effect can be useful for improving relationships among coworkers.&lt;ref name="Manage Train Learn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Get Others to Like You: The Benjamin Franklin Effect|url=http://www.managetrainlearn.com/page/franklin-effect|website=Manage Train Learn|accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sales field, the Ben Franklin effect can be used to build rapport with a client. Instead of offering to help the potential client, a salesperson can instead ask the potential client for assistance: "For example, ask them to share with you what product benefits they find most compelling, where they think the market is headed, or what products may be of interest several years from now. This pure favor, left unrepaid, can build likability that will enhance your ability to earn that client's time and investment in the future."&lt;ref name="The Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dalton|first1=Steve|title=Harness the Ben Franklin Effect, Boost Your Career|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-dalton/harness-the-ben-franklin-effect_b_4605447.html|accessdate=15 December 2016|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Benjamin Franklin effect can also be observed in successful mentor-protege relationships. Such relationships, one source points out, "are defined by their fundamental imbalance of knowledge and influence. Attempting to proactively reciprocate favors with a mentor can backfire, as the role reversal and unsolicited assistance may put your mentor in an unexpected, awkward situation".&lt;ref name="The Huffington Post"/&gt;
The Ben Franklin effect was cited in [[Dale Carnegie|Dale Carnegie's]] bestselling book ''[[How to Win Friends and Influence People]]''. Carnegie interprets the request for a favor as "a subtle but effective form of flattery".

:As Carnegie suggests, when we ask a colleague to do us a favour, we are signalling that we consider them to have something we don't, whether more intelligence, more knowledge, more skills, or whatever. This is another way of showing admiration and respect, something the other person may not have noticed from us before. This immediately raises their opinion of us and makes them more willing to help us again both because they enjoy the admiration and have genuinely started to like us.&lt;ref name="Manage Train Learn"/&gt;

Psychologist Yu Niiya suggests that the Ben Franklin effect vindicates the theory of ''amae'' (甘え). It states that dependent, childlike behavior can induce a parent-child bond where one partner sees themselves as the caretaker.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In effect, ''amae'' creates a relationship where one person feels responsible for the other, who is then free to act immaturely and make demands.

One commentator has discussed the Ben Franklin effect in connection with [[dog training]], thinking "more about the human side of the relationship rather than about the dogs themselves." While trainers often distinguish between the impact of positive and negative reinforcement-based training methods on the dogs, it can also be relevant to "consider the effects that these two approaches may have upon the trainer. The Ben Franklin Effect suggests that how we treat our dogs during training influences how we think about them as individuals – specifically, how much we like (or dislike) them.  When we do nice things for our dogs in the form of treats, praise, petting and play to reinforce desired behaviors, such treatment may result in our liking them more. And, if we use harsh words, collar jerks or hitting in an attempt to change our dog's behavior, then...we will start to like our dog less."&lt;ref name="The Science Dog"/&gt;

== Converse ==
The opposite case is also believed to be true, namely that we come to hate a person whom we did wrong to. We de-humanize them to justify the bad things we did to them.&lt;ref name="Changing Minds" /&gt;

It has been suggested that if soldiers who have killed enemy servicemen in combat situations later come to hate them, it is because this psychological maneuver helps to "decrease the dissonance of killing".&lt;ref name="Changing Minds" /&gt; Such a phenomenon might also "explain long-standing grudges like [[Hatfield–McCoy feud|Hatfield vs. McCoy]]" or vendetta situations in various cultures: "Once we start, we may not be able to stop and engage in behavior we would normally never allow."&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2011/11/16/do-me-a-favor-so-youll-like-me-the-reverse-psychology-of-likeability/#e2331857e300|title=Do Me A Favor So You'll Like Me: The Reverse Psychology of Likeability|last1=Becher|first1=Jonathan|date=November 16, 2011|accessdate=15 December 2016|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one commentator has put it, "Jailers come to look down on inmates; camp guards come to dehumanize their captives; soldiers create derogatory terms for their enemies. It's difficult to hurt someone you admire. It's even more difficult to kill a fellow human being. Seeing the casualties you create as something less than you, something deserving of damage, makes it possible to continue seeing yourself as a good and honest person, to continue being sane."&lt;ref name="You are not so smart" /&gt;

[[Brahman]] has ''avyama'' ('unlimited extension in terms of space'); it is ''sarvagata'' ('omnipresent'), ''ananta'' ('infinite'); it is called ''Bhuman'' ('plenitude') and is ''nirvayava'' or ('without parts') and ''arupvad'' ('formless'), and eternal because it is ''aksara'' ('imperishable').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Perspectives on Vedanta|author=Arvind Sharma|publisher=Brill Archive|page=114|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8gwVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=Bhuman+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9onTUr-tNI6ShgeOqYGoBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Bhuman%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brahman]] is Bhuman, the plenitude which transcends the sum of its parts and yet fully inheres in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Philosophy: An Introduction to Hindu and Buddhist Thought|author=Richard King|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|page=222|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uca8R72W8iQC&amp;pg=PA222&amp;dq=Bhuman+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9onTUr-tNI6ShgeOqYGoBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Bhuman%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of being the Bhuman (plenitude) etc.; ascribed by the ''[[Śruti]]s'' agrees well with the highest Self, which is the cause of everything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sacred Books of The East – the Vedanta Sutras|publisher=Atlantic Publishers|page=168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K4FXqaw5BoAC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=Bhuman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yoXTUpa5CtGQhQfcn4GwAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Bhuman&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brahman resides in its entirety within the smallest particle imaginable and yet remains the ''ayatana'', the receptacle, or ''bhuman'', the totality which transcends the sum of these parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism|author=Richard King|publisher=SUNY Press|page=83|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p1bASTAOhjoC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=Bhuman+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lojTUq_MNoKHhQfunIGwBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Bhuman%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Bhuman is the supreme Self, since he is taught as superior to ''samprasada'' (''Prana'')".
[[Pāṇini|Panini]] explains that the word, Bhuman, is derived from the word ''Bahu'' meaning much; many, with the suffix ''imam'' added after it by dropping – ''i'' to impart the sense of the abstract noun. [[Adi Sankara]] in his ''Bhasya'' states that this word is introduced without discarding [[Prana]] to mean Prana is Brahman. But, here the instruction is that Bhuman is superior to Prana therefore Prana cannot be Brahman because from Brahman proceeds Prana ([[Chandogya Upanishad]] VII.xxvi.1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya of Sankaracarya|author=Swami Gambhirananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|page=167|url=https://www.amazon.com/Brahma-Sutra-Bhasya-Sankaracarya/dp/8175051051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Madhvacharya|Madhava]], Bhuman is that which is beyond all and not merely beyond Prana alone; if it is something subsequent to Prana it cannot be Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the Dvaita School of Vedanta and its Literature|author=B.N.Krishnamurti Sharma|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=303|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FVtpFMPMulcC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq=Bhuman+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s4rTUrPQONC0hAe464DoCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Bhuman%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15343">Starting in the early 1990s, [[James F. Moore]] originated the [[strategic planning]] concept of a '''business ecosystem''', now widely adopted in the [[high tech]] community. The basic definition comes from Moore's book, ''[[The Death of Competition: Leadership and Strategy in the Age of Business Ecosystems]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The origins of the concept==
The concept first appeared in Moore's May/June 1993 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article, titled "Predators and Prey: A New Ecology of Competition", and won the [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] Award for article of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:9vCCtUPpvH8J:www.isc.hbs.edu/mckinsey.pdf+james+moore+1993+mckinsey+award&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESi5p3-FjaIXFtwHhFgLk7zc8HukKsFKCUhk17KyhXsWjl2ZBPZOiATTd8LJWia5pJCZRj4xKsTs09f6p0XeZxJZaE3IJFQ5fhcsM9aZEgs6ahQVkQQm_JuL7rsOA_h49yV403Cf&amp;sig=AHIEtbQsPjXx1J8LDyvOVZQBtu41LnVm1w|page=2|title=McKinsey Award Winners for Best ''HBR'' Articles|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore defined "business ecosystem" as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
An economic community supported by a foundation of interacting organizations and individuals—the organisms of the business world. The economic community produces goods and services of value to customers, who are themselves members of the ecosystem. The member organisms also include suppliers, lead producers, competitors, and other stakeholders. Over time, they [[coevolve]] their capabilities and roles, and tend to align themselves with the directions set by one or more central companies. Those companies holding leadership roles may change over time, but the function of ecosystem leader is valued by the community because it enables members to move toward shared visions to align their investments, and to find mutually supportive roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Moore|1996|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moore used several ecological [[metaphor]]s, suggesting that the firm is embedded in a (business) environment, that it needs to coevolve with other companies, and that “the particular [[Ecological niche|niche]] a business occupies is challenged by newly arriving species.”&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Moore|1996|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that companies need to become proactive in developing mutually beneficial ("[[symbiotic]]") relationships with customers, suppliers, and even competitors.

Using ecological metaphors to describe business structure and operations is increasingly common especially within the field of information technology (IT). For example, [[J. Bradford DeLong]], a professor of economics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], has written that "business ecosystems" describe “the pattern of launching new technologies that has emerged from [[Silicon Valley]]”.&lt;ref name=delong1&gt;{{
harvnb|DeLong|2000|loc=para. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Cohen|DeLong|Zysman|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines business ecology as “a more productive set of processes for developing and commercializing new technologies” that is characterized by the “rapid prototyping, short product-development cycles, early test marketing, options-based compensation, venture funding, early corporate independence”.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|DeLong|2000|loc=para. 6 &amp; 4, respectively}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeLong also has expressed that the new way is likely to endure “because it's a better business ecology than the legendarily lugubrious model refined at [[Xerox PARC|Xerox Parc]]—a more productive set of processes for rapidly developing and commercializing new technologies”.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|DeLong|2000|loc=para. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mangrove Software,&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Mangrove|2001|loc=para. 1}}: “(t)he interaction and correlation of economic conditions, technology, customers, employees, corporate partners, shareholders, and competitors forming the environment under which a business operates”.&lt;/ref&gt; The Montague Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Montague|1993|loc=para. 1}}: “interacting systems consisting of companies, their customers and suppliers, and other players in the business environment”&lt;/ref&gt; Kenneth L. Kraemer, director of the [[University of California, Irvine]]’s Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Kraemer|1999|loc=para. 11}}: “It is the applications that firms buy or create themselves that bring value-added to the firm and to its business ecology of customers, suppliers and business partners”.&lt;/ref&gt; and Stephen Abram, Vice President of Micromedia, Ltd.,&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Abram|2000|loc=para. 4}}: has asserted that the Web is “maturing as a business ecology”&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Gruber, co-founder and CTO of Intraspect Software,&lt;ref name=gruber&gt;{{
harvnb|Gruber|loc=para. 4}}: “Imagine that companies are like organisms in an evolutionary landscape”&lt;/ref&gt; Vinod K. Dar, Managing Director of Dar &amp; Company,&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Dar|1999|loc=para. 1}}: “Evolution on the Internet is no different from physical evolution but with vastly compressed life cycles and faster genetic mutation”.&lt;/ref&gt; have all advocated this approach.

==Industries==
Gruber explains that over a century ago, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motors]] did well using methods of mass production, an assembly line, and [[insourcing]]. However, Ford began to outsource its production “[w]hen the ecology evolved.” Gruber (n.d.) has stated that such evolution in the ecology of the business world is “punctuated now and then by radical changes in the environment” and that “globalization and the Internet are the equivalents of large-scale climate change. Globalization is eliminating the traditional advantages of the large corporation: access to capital, access to markets, and economies of scale”.&lt;ref name=gruber/&gt;

The [[application service provider]] (ASP) industry is moving toward relationship networks and focusing on core competencies. “According to the gospel of [[Cisco Systems]], companies inclined to exist together within an “ecosystem” facilitate the imminence of Internet-based application delivery”.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Kaminsky|2000|loc=para. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Books also use natural systems metaphors without discussing the interfaces between human business and biological ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Baskin|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another work defines business ecology as “a new field for sustainable organizational management and design,” one “that is based on the principle that organizations, as living organisms, are most successful when their development and behavior are aligned with their core purpose and values – what we call “social DNA’”.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Abe|Dempsey|Bassett|1998|pp=xii-xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for companies to attend to ecological health is indicated by the following: “Business ecology is based on the elegant structure and principles of natural systems. It recognizes that to develop healthy business ecosystems, leaders and their organizations must see themselves, and their environments, through an “ecological lens”.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Abe|Dempsey|Bassett|1998|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological ecosystems==
Some environmentalists have used "business ecosystems" as a way to talk about environmental issues as they relate to business rather than as a metaphor to describe the increasing complexity of relationships among companies. According to Townsend, business ecology is the study of the reciprocal relationship between business and organisms and their environments. The goal of this "business ecology" is sustainability through the complete ecological synchronization and integration of a business with the sites that it inhabits, uses, and affects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Townsend|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other environmentalists believe that the ecosystem metaphor is just a way for business to appear 'Green'. According to author [[Alan Marshall (New Zealand author)|Alan Marshall]], the metaphor is used to make out that somehow business operates using natural principles which should be left to run without interference by governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Unity of Nature: Wholeness and Disintegration in Ecology and Science|last = Marshall|first = Alan|publisher = Imperial College Press|year = 2002|isbn = 9781860943300|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Pages needed|date=February 2016}}

'''Conflict trap''' is a term to describe the pattern when [[civil war]]s repeat themselves.

== Description ==
Scholars have offered a few reasons for it, after [[Paul Collier]] and Nicholas Sambanis (2002) noticed this pattern and coined the term ‘conflict trap’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=COLLIER|first=PAUL|last2=SAMBANIS|first2=NICHOLAS|title=Understanding Civil War|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022002702046001001|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=3–12|doi=10.1177/0022002702046001001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, a civil war can aggravate the causal political and economic conditions which lead to a repeat civil war. Other reasons can be because the [[combatant]]s are fighting over stakes that is valuable to both the parties, combatants are unable to defeat each other or are engaged in a long duration serious war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walter|first=Barbara F.|date=2015-10-01|title=Why Bad Governance Leads to Repeat Civil War|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022002714528006|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|language=en|volume=59|issue=7|pages=1242–1272|doi=10.1177/0022002714528006|issn=0022-0027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political and Legal Institutions play an important role in inhibiting a repeat civil war, hence preventing a country from entering a conflict trap. Strong institutions can put a check on the incumbent’s power, hence ensuring [[Welfare|public welfare]] and therefore rebels have fewer reasons to restart a civil war. Also, this removes the need for the rebels to maintain an army or a threat of war. A strong political and legal system also gives a non-violent platform to rebels to bring about desired changes, so they may not need to adopt violent ways to protest.

There can be other reasons why a civil war may start and repeat itself. There may be intense grievances held by the groups, which motivate them to fight. Inferior health conditions, lower [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] and poor [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] create conditions for dissatisfaction, and hence civil wars. If a country is poor, it may be easier for rebels to organize an army and start a civil war. Weaker states serve as one of reasons for an easier rebellion, since they lack capacity to effectively keep rebels in check. A country’s geography may also contribute in wars since rebels can easily escape.

The '''Cortex System''' is a generic RPG system based on the ''[[Sovereign Stone (role-playing game)|Sovereign Stone System]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}'', and was developed by [[Margaret Weis Productions, Ltd]] for the [[Serenity Role Playing Game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thed6generation.com/d6g_episode_18_serenity_rpg_reviewed_interview_with_designer |title=D6G Episode 18: Serenity RPG reviewed &amp; interview with designer |work=The D6 Generation |date=October 30, 2008 |accessdate=March 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was subsequently used for their licensed ''[[Battlestar Galactica Role Playing Game|Battlestar Galactica]]'' and [[Supernatural Role Playing Game|Supernatural]] RPGs, and brought out as a stand-alone system in the ''Cortex System Role Playing Game'' book&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/14/14750.phtml RPG.net review of Cortex Classic]&lt;/ref&gt; (also called the ''Cortex Classic System Role Playing Game'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/58488/Cortex-Classic-System-Role-Playing-Game Cortex Classic System RPG listing]&lt;/ref&gt;  Serenity, using the Cortex System, was the 2005 Origins Award Gamer's Choice Role Playing Game of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rpggeek.com/rpg/285/serenity-role-playing-game RPG Geek Serenity RPG page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that despite the similar name, the Cortex System is not the [[Cortex Plus]] system, also produced by Margaret Weis Productions.

==The basic system==

The system uses [[dice]] with 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 sides, described with the standard role-playing game [[Dice notation|notation]] of d2, d4, d6, d8, and so on, and the basic resolution system involves adding up the total on all your relevant dice and comparing it to a static target number.  The three parts of your [[dice pool]] are your relevant Attributes (Agility, Strength, Vitality, Alertness, Intelligence, and Willpower) which range from d4 to d12+d4, your relevant Skill (from a list of 22) which range from 0 to d12, and any relevant Assets (positive character traits) or Complications (negative traits).  Situational advantages can be represented either by changing the target difficulty number or increasing or reducing the number of faces on the dice rolled.

The ''Cortex System'' also uses [[plot point (role-playing games)|Plot Points]], which increase characters' survivability and give players greater control over events in the game. Players can spend Plot Points to gain extra dice when making a die roll, reduce the damage from an attack, or even make changes to the storyline. Some Assets also require the expenditure of Plot Points. At the end of a game session, excess Plot Points are converted to Advancement Points, which a player spends to improve his or her character's abilities.

==Character Creation==

The game uses a point-buy system with a default initial spread between attributes, skills, and traits (the collective name for advantages and complications) based on the intended power level of the game. This is similar to the siloed point buy and special abilities and character flaws used in a variety of other role-playing games, such as Merits and Flaws in [[White Wolf Publishing]]'s original ''[[World of Darkness]]'', Qualities and Drawbacks in Eden Unisystem, and Edges and Hindrances in [[Pinnacle Entertainment Group|Pinnacle Entertainment's]] ''[[Deadlands]]'' and ''[[Savage Worlds]]'' games (to which the Serenity system bears a strong resemblance).

==Published games using the Cortex System==

* [[Serenity (role-playing game)]] 
* [[Battlestar Galactica Role Playing Game]] 
* [[Demon Hunters Role Playing Game]]
* Cortex System Role Playing Game 
* [[Supernatural Role Playing Game]]

==Reception==

The initial reception to the Cortex System was good, with the Serenity Role Playing Game winning the 2005 [[Origins Award]] for Gamer's Choice: Best Roleplaying Game of the Year.&lt;ref name="2005 Origins"&gt;[http://gama.org/OriginsAwards/OriginsAwardsWinnersThe2000s/The2005OriginsAwards/tabid/3250/Default.aspx 2005 Origins Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227142121/http://gama.org/OriginsAwards/OriginsAwardsWinnersThe2000s/The2005OriginsAwards/tabid/3250/Default.aspx |date=2013-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Battlestar Galactica Role Playing Game]] gained praise from [[SF Weekly]] for the Plot Point mechanisms and the way they reproduced the all-or-nothing moments of the [[Battlestar Galactica]] series.&lt;ref name="SF Weekly"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070915061913/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/games/sfw16936.html SF Weekly review of Battlestar Galactica]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Journal of Transformative Works said that the system itself could be considered transformative given that the rules were meant to evolve through play sessions.&lt;ref name="JTW"&gt;[http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/191/162 Book Review: Supernatural role playing game, by Jamie Chambers] - the Journal of Transformative Works&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the [[Smallville Roleplaying Game]], RPGamer commented that "Smallville does something rare in a licensed game: not only does it deliver an experience that captures the feel of the original, but also comes up with a set of mechanics that create an entirely new dynamic for roleplaying." &lt;ref name="RPGamer Smallville"&gt;[http://www.rpgamer.com/savingthrow/reviews/rev-SV.html Review of Smallville by RPGamer]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyphonism''' ([[Greek language|Gr]] {{Lang|el|κυφωνισμός}}, from {{Lang|el|κῡφός}}, "bent, crooked") was a form of punishment by the {{Lang|el|κύφων}} (''kyphon''), a sort of wooden [[pillory]] by which the neck of the malefactor was bent or weighed downward. Formerly, this term was widely believed to refer to a form of punishment in which the criminal's naked body was smeared with honey, and exposed him to flies, wasps, etc.

[[File:Down shifting on the Rogue.jpg|thumb|275x275px|An example of what a down shifting lifestyle may allow more time for.]]
The term down-shifting in the English language refers to the act of reducing the gear of a motor vehicle while driving a [[manual transmission]]. This title or term has now been re purposed and applied to describe a [[social behavior]] or [[Social Trends|trend]] in which individuals live simpler lives to escape from what critics call the [[rat race]].

The long-term effect of downshifting can include an escape from what has been described as [[economic materialism]], as well as reduce the "stress and psychological expense that may accompany [[economic materialism]]". This new social trend emphasizes finding an improved [[Work–life balance|balance between leisure and work]], while also focusing life goals on personal fulfillment, as well as building personal relationships instead of the all-consuming pursuit of economic success.

Down-shifting, as a concept, shares many characteristics with [[simple living]]. However, it is distinguished as an alternative form by its focus on moderate change and concentration on an individual comfort level and a gradual approach to living.&lt;ref name="Tracey Smith, 2008"&gt;Tracey Smith, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, this new form of simple living began appearing in the [[mainstream media]], and has continually grown in popularity among populations living in [[Industrial society|industrial societies]], especially the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Schor 1998, p. 67;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Values and motives==
Down-shifters are people that adopt long-term [[voluntary simplicity]] in their lives. A few of the main practices of down-shifters include accepting less money for fewer hours worked, while placing an emphasis on consuming less in order to reduce their ecological footprint.  One of the main results of these practices is being able to enjoy more [[Leisure|leisure time]] in the company of others, especially loved ones.  

The primary motivations for downshifting are gaining leisure time, escaping from [[consumerism|work-and-spend cycle]], and removing the clutter of unnecessary possessions. The personal goals of downshifting are simple:  To reach a holistic self-understanding and satisfying meaning in life.&lt;ref&gt;Levy 2005, p.176&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its personalized nature and emphasis on many minor changes, rather than complete lifestyle overhaul, it attracts downshifters or participants across the socioeconomic spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Both of Hamilton's case studies in 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  An intrinsic consequence of downshifting is increased time for non-work-related activities, which, combined with the diverse demographics of downshifters, cultivates higher levels of [[civic engagement]] and [[Social relation|social interaction]].&lt;ref name="Nelson 2007, p. 142"&gt;Nelson 2007, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope of participation is limitless, because all members of society &amp;mdash; adults, children, businesses, institutions, organizations, and governments &amp;mdash; are able to downshift.&lt;ref name="Tracey Smith, 2008"/&gt;

In practice, down-shifting involves a variety of [[behavior change (public health)|behavioral and lifestyle changes]]. The majority of these down-shifts are voluntary choices. Natural life course events, such as the loss of a job, or birth of a child can prompt involuntary down-shifting. There is also a [[Time|temporal dimension]], because a down-shift could be either temporary or permanent.&lt;ref name="Schor 1998, p. 68"&gt;Schor 1998, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

===Work and income===
The most common form of down-shifting is work (or income) down-shifting. Down-shifting is fundamentally based on dissatisfaction with the conditions and consequences of the workplace environment.&lt;ref&gt;Schor 1998, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;  The philosophy of work-to-live replaces the social [[ideology]] of live-to-work. Reorienting economic priorities shifts the [[work–life balance]] away from the workplace.

Economically, work downshifts are defined in terms of reductions in either actual or potential [[income]], work hours, and spending levels.&lt;ref name="Schor 1998, p. 68"/&gt;  Following a path of earnings that is lower than the established market path is a downshift in potential earnings in favor of gaining other non-material benefits.

On an individual level, work downshifting is a voluntary reduction in annual income. Downshifters desire meaning in life outside of work and, therefore, will opt to decrease the amount of time spent at work or work hours.  Reducing the number of hours of work, consequently, lowers the amount earned.&lt;ref&gt;Schor 1998, pps. 66-69&lt;/ref&gt;  Simply not working [[overtime]] or taking a half-day a week for leisure time, are work downshifts.

Career downshifts are another way of downshifting economically and entail lowering previous aspirations of [[wealth]], a promotion or higher [[social status]].&lt;ref&gt;Juniu 2000, p. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;  Quitting a job to work locally in the community, from home or to start a business are examples of career downshifts.  Although more radical, these changes do not mean stopping work altogether.

Many reasons are cited by workers for this choice and usually center on a personal [[cost–benefit analysis]] of current working situations and the quality extracurricular activities. High stress, pressure from employers to increase productivity, and long [[Commuting|commutes]] can be factors that contribute to the costs of being employed.&lt;ref name="Schor 1998, p. 68"/&gt;  If the down-shifter wants more [[quality time|non-material benefits]] like leisure time, a healthy family life, or personal freedom, then, switching jobs could be a desirable option.

Work down-shifting may also be a key to considerable [[Health#Maintaining|health benefit]]s as well as a healthy [[retirement]]. People are retiring later in life than previous generations. We can see by looking at The Health and Retirement Study,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu|title=Welcome to the Health and Retirement Study|website=hrsonline.isr.umich.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; done by the Health and Retirement Study Survey Research Center, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gustman|first=Alan|last2=Mitchell|first2=Olivia|last3=Steinmeier|first3=Thomas|date=1994-08|title=Retirement Research Using the Health and Retirement Survey|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3386/w4813|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;women can show the long term [[Health#Maintaining|health benefits]] of down-shifting their work lives by working part time hours over a long period of years. Men however prove to be more unhealthy if they work part time from [[middle age]] till [[Retirement age|retirement]]. Men that down-shift their work life to part time hours at the age of 60 to 65 however benefit from continuing to work a part time job through a semi retirement even over the age of 70. This is an example of how flexible working policies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Suzan|last2=Roper|first2=Ian|date=2009-09-02|title=Flexible Working Arrangements: From Work–Life to Gender Equity Policies|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199234738.003.0018|journal=Oxford Handbooks Online|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199234738.003.0018}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be a key to being healthy while in retirement. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDonough|first=Peggy|last2=Worts|first2=Diana|last3=Corna|first3=Laurie M.|last4=McMunn|first4=Anne|last5=Sacker|first5=Amanda|date=2017-12|title=Later-life employment trajectories and health|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.alcr.2017.09.002|journal=Advances in Life Course Research|volume=34|pages=22–33|doi=10.1016/j.alcr.2017.09.002|issn=1040-2608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spending habits===
Another aspect of down-shifting is being a [[Ethical consumerism|conscious consumer]] or actively practicing alternative forms of consumption. Proponents of down-shifting point to [[consumerism]] as a primary source of stress and dissatisfaction because it creates a society of individualistic consumers who measure both social status and general happiness by an [[affluenza|unattainable quantity of material possessions]]. Instead of buying goods for personal satisfaction, consumption down-shifting, purchasing only the necessities, is a way to focus on quality of life rather than quantity.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2007, p. 142"/&gt;

This realignment of spending priorities promotes the functional utility of goods over their ability to convey status which is evident in downshifters being, in general, less [[brand]]-conscious.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson 2007, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; These consumption habits also facilitate the option of working and earning less because annual spending is proportionally lower. Reducing spending is less demanding than more extreme downshifts in other areas, like employment, as it requires only minor lifestyle changes.

===Policies that enable downshifting===
Unions, business, and governments could implement more [[Flextime|flexible working hours]], [[Part-time contract|part-time]] work, and other non-traditional work arrangements that enable people to work less, while still maintaining employment. Small business legislation, reduced filing requirements and reduced tax rates encourage small-scale individual [[entrepreneurship]] and therefore help individuals quit their jobs altogether and work for themselves on their own terms.&lt;ref name=GreenIllusions&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln and London|url=http://www.greenillusions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment consequences===
The catch-phrase of International Downshifting Week is "Slow Down and Green Up".&lt;ref name="Tracey Smith, 2008"/&gt;  Whether intentional or unintentional, generally, the choices and practices of down-shifters nurture environmental health because they reject the fast-paced lifestyle fueled by [[Fossil fuel|fossil fuels]] and adopt more sustainable lifestyles. The [[Manifest and latent functions and dysfunctions|latent function]] of consumption down-shifting is to reduce, to some degree, the [[carbon footprint]] of the individual down-shifter.  An example is to shift from a corporate suburban rat race lifestyle to a small eco friendly farming lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444327204577615972288993492 ''The Ultimate Growth Business; Many corporate refugees think green acres are the place to be. How do they make the transition?]'' October 12, 2012 ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Down-shifting geographically===
As a response the hectic pace of life and stresses in urban areas, downshifting geographically is a relocation to a smaller, rural, or more slow-paced community.&lt;ref name="Schor 1998, p. 68"/&gt;  This is a more drastic change, but because the access to the internet is widespread and possible, downshifting geographically does not bring total removal from mainstream culture.

==Sociopolitical implications==
Although downshifting is primarily motivated by personal desire and not by a conscious political stance, it does define societal [[overconsumption]] as the source of much personal discontent. By redefining life satisfaction in non-material terms, downshifters assume an alternative lifestyle but continue to coexist in a society and political system preoccupied with the economy. In general, downshifters are politically apathetic because mainstream politicians mobilize voters through the ''hip-pocket nerve'', proposing governmental solutions to periods of financial hardship and [[recession|economic recessions]]. This economic rhetoric is meaningless to downshifters who have forgone worrying about money.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Jan. 2003, pps. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Although consumers do hold the majority in the United States, the UK, and Australia, a significant minority, approximately 20 to 25 percent,&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Both 2003 Studies&lt;/ref&gt; of these countries' citizens identify themselves in some respect as downshifters. Downshifting is not an isolated or unusual choice.  Politics still centers around consumerism and unrestricted growth, but downshifting value, such as family priorities and workplace regulation, are appearing in political debates and campaigns.

Like downshifters, the [[The Cultural Creatives|Cultural Creatives]] is another social movement whose ideology and practices diverge from mainstream [[consumerism]] and according to Paul Ray, are followed by at least a quarter of U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Nov. 2003, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''In Praise of Slowness'', Carl Honoré relates followers of downshifting and [[simple living]] to the global [[Slow movement (culture)|Slow Movement]].

The emergence of a large and diverse class of downshifters challenges the economically bias ideas for improving society.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Nov. 2003, pps. 35-37&lt;/ref&gt;  Downshifting and similar, [[Post-materialism|post-materialist]] ideologies are rising in popularity, but as a result of their [[grassroots]] nature, and relatively inconspicuous, non-confrontational subcultures, they represent unorganized [[List of social movements|social movements]] without political aspirations or motivating grievances.

{{Emotion}}

'''Envy''' (from Latin ''[[invidia]]'') is an [[emotion]] which "occurs when a person lacks another's superior quality, achievement, or possession and either desires it or wishes that the other lacked it".&lt;ref name="Parrot, Smith, 1993 "&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parrott | first1 = W. G. | last2 = Smith | first2 = R. H. | year = 1993 | title = Distinguishing the experiences of envy and jealousy | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 906–920 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.6.906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] defined envy as pain at the sight of another’s good fortune, stirred by “those who have what we ought to have.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.mb.txt Rhetoric By Aristotle]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] said that envy was one of the most potent causes of unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Conquest of Happiness|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|publisher=[[Horace Liveright|H. Liverwright]]|year=1930|location=[[New York City|New York]]|page=&lt;!-- insert page number --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only is the envious person rendered unhappy by his or her envy, Russell explained, but that person may also wish to inflict misfortune on others, in forms of emotional abuse and violent acts of criminality. Although envy is generally seen as something negative, Russell also believed that envy was a driving force behind the movement of economies and must be endured to achieve the "keep up with Jones" system. He believed this is what helps to maintain democracy, a system where no one can achieve more than anyone else.&lt;ref&gt;Russell (1930), pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Types of Envy==
Psychologists have recently suggested that there are two types of envy: malicious envy and benign envy—malicious envy being proposed as a sick force that ruins a person and his/her mind and causes the envious person to blindly want the "hero" to suffer; on the other hand, benign envy being proposed as a type of positive motivational force that causes the person to aspire to be as good as the "hero"—but only if benign envy is used in a right way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Leveling up and down: the experiences of benign and malicious envy.|display-authors=etal|author=van de Ven N|pmid=19485619|doi=10.1037/a0015669|volume=9|journal=Emotion|pages=419–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spring.org.uk/2011/05/why-envy-motivates-us.php|title=Why Envy Motivates Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Sherry Turkle]] considers that  the advent of social media and selfie culture is creating an alienating sense of “self-envy” psyche in users, and posits this further affects problem areas attached to attachments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sherry Turkle|title=Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AjFXDgAAQBAJ|year=2017|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-09366-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Envy and gloating have parallel structures as emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/envy.htm|title=Emotional Competency - Envy|website=www.emotionalcompetency.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sentic.net/hourglass-of-emotions.pdf |title=LNCS 7403 - The Hourglass of Emotions |format=PDF |website=Sentic.net |date= |accessdate=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only type of envy that can have positive effects is benign envy. According to researchers, benign envy can provide emulation, improvement motivation, positive thoughts about the other person, and admiration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lange |first1=Jens |last2=Crusius |first2=Jan |last3=Weidman |first3=Aaron |title=The Painful Duality of Envy: Evidence for an Integrative Theory and a Meta-Analysis on the Relation of Envy and Schadenfreude}}&lt;/ref&gt;.This type of envy, if dealt with correctly, can positively effect a persons future by motivating them to be a better person and to succeed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=van de Ven |first1=Niels |title=Envy and Its Consequences: Why It Is Useful to Distinguish between Benign and Malicious Envy |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/spc3.12253 |website=online library |publisher=John Wiley and Sons LTD.}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Our human instinct is to avoid negative aspects in life such as the negative emotion, envy. However, it is possible to turn this negative emotional state into a motivational tool that can help a person to become successful in the future.

== Socioevolutionary view ==
[[File:Giotto - Scrovegni - -48- - Envy.jpg|thumb|''Invidia'', [[allegory|allegorical]] painting by [[Giotto di Bondone]], ca. 1305-1306]]
One theory that helps explain envy and its effects on human behavior is the Socioevolutionary theory. Based upon (Charles) Darwin's (1859) theory of evolution through [[natural selection]], socioevolutionary theory predicts that humans behave in ways that enhance individual survival and the reproduction of their genes. Thus, this theory provides a framework for understanding social behavior and experiences, such as the experience and expression of envy, as rooted in biological drives for survival and procreation.&lt;ref name="ehis.ebscohost.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yoshimura|first=C.G|year=2010|title= The experience and communication of envy among siblings, siblings-in-law, and spouses|publisher=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=876f3f3d-bc01-4f81-b58c-1a9c4db40db0%40sessionmgr4&amp;vid=6&amp;hid=20}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have demonstrated that inciting envy actually changes cognitive function, boosting mental persistence and memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fields|first=R|year=2011|title= Eat Your Guts Out: Why Envy Hurts and Why It's Good for Your Brain|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-new-brain/201109/eat-your-guts-out-why-envy-hurts-and-why-its-good-your-brain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Schadenfreude ==
{{Main|Schadenfreude}}
''Schadenfreude'' means taking pleasure in the misfortune of others and can be understood as an outgrowth of envy in certain situations.

Envy and Schadenfreude are very similar and are linked emotional states. Both emotions are considered very complex and often times looked down upon, which is understandable considering they are both antisocial behaviors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zizzo |first1=Daniel |title=Money burning and rank egalitarianism with random dictators |date=2003 |volume=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Given the detrimental states of these emotions, it is very important to understand their development in the early stages of childhood.

The two social emotions, envy and schadenfreude act together as sister emotions during the developmental stages in adolescents. Both emotions have a strong presence during these early stages in a child's life. However, as a person ages ,the more they begin to conceal these “bad” emotions and learn to regulate.  

In previous studies, it has been shown that envy becomes less prevalent as a child gets older. Researchers believe that this results from an increase in the regulation of envious type emotions as a person ages and gains more wisdom about life. Depending on age, the correlation of envy and schadenfreude increases. For example a younger child is more likely to make spiteful decisions when they feel envious towards a person. 

== Regarding possessions or status ==
[[File:Jheronimus Bosch Table of the Mortal Sins (Invidia).jpg|thumb|left|[[Hieronymus Bosch]], ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things]]'' (Invidia)]]

Often, envy involves a motive to "outdo or undo the rival's advantages".&lt;ref&gt;D'Arms, J. (2009). Envy. Unpublished manuscript, ''Stanford Encyclopedia of philosophy'', Stanford, Retrieved from Plato.stanford.edu/entries/envy/&lt;/ref&gt; In part, this type of envy may be based on materialistic possessions rather than psychological states. Basically, people find themselves experiencing an overwhelming emotion due to someone else owning or possessing desirable items that they do not. For example, your next door neighbor just bought a brand new [[ocarina]]—a musical instrument you've been infatuated with for months now but can't afford. Feelings of envy in this situation would occur in the forms of emotional pain, a lack of [[self-worth]], and a lowered [[self-esteem]]/[[well-being]].

In Nelson Aldrich's ''Old Money'', he states that "envy is so integral and painful a part of what animates human behavior in market societies that many people have forgotten the full meaning of the word, simplifying it into one of the symptoms of desire. It is that (a symptom of [[Desire (emotion)|desire]]), which is why it flourishes in market societies: democracies of desire, they might be called, with money for ballots, stuffing permitted. But envy is more or less than desire. It begins with the almost frantic sense of [[emptiness]] inside oneself, as if the pump of one's heart were sucking on air. One has to be blind to perceive the emptiness, of course, but that's what envy is, a selective blindness. ''Invidia'', Latin for envy, translates as "nonsight," and Dante had the envious plodding along under cloaks of lead, their eyes sewn shut with leaden wire. What they are blind to is what they have, God-given and humanly nurtured, in themselves".&lt;ref name="Hacker, Diana 1996. p. 23"&gt;Hacker, Diana. ''A Canadian Writer's Reference'', 2nd Ed. Nelson Canada, 1996. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overcoming ==
Envy may negatively affect the closeness and satisfaction of relationships. Overcoming envy might be similar to dealing with other negative emotions ([[anger]], [[resentment]], etc.). Individuals experiencing anger often seek professional treatment ([[anger management]]) to help understand why they feel the way they do and how to cope. Subjects experiencing envy often have a skewed perception on how to achieve true [[happiness]]. By helping people to change these perceptions, they will be more able to understand the real meaning of fortune and satisfaction with what they do have. According to Lazarus "coping is an integral feature of the emotion process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lazarus | first1 = R. S. | year = 2006 | title = Emotions and Interpersonal Relationships: Toward a Person-Centered Conceptualization of Emotions and Coping | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 74 | issue = 1| pages = 9–46 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2005.00368.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are very few theories that emphasize the coping process for emotions as compared to the information available concerning the emotion itself.

There are numerous [[Coping (psychology)|styles of coping]], of which there has been a significant amount of research done, for example, [[avoidant]] versus approach. Coping with envy can be similar to coping with anger. The issue must be addressed cognitively in order to work through the emotion. According to the research done by [[Peter Salovey|Salovey]] and Rodin (1988), "more effective strategies for reducing initial envy appear to be stimulus focused rather than self-focused.".&lt;ref name="Salovey, P. 1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Salovey | first1 = P. | last2 = Rodin | first2 = J. | year = 1988 | title = Coping with envy and jealousy | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 15–33 | doi=10.1521/jscp.1988.7.1.15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salovey and Rodin (1988) also suggest "self-bolstering (e.g., "thinking about my good qualities") may be an effective strategy for moderating these self-deprecating thoughts and muting negative affective reactions".&lt;ref name="Salovey, P. 1988"/&gt; Further research needs to be done in order to better understand envy, as well as to help people cope with this emotion.

==Benefits==

Envy can be a painful emotion that can result from an unflattering social comparison of someone who is perceived to be a superior person. Aristotle defined envy as the pain a person experiences at the sight of another person’s good fortune. While envy is seen to be negative, it is the driving force behind the “keeping up with the Jones” philosophy. This means that there is always something to work toward, and to never become complacent with life.

	Envy can tell a person many things about themselves. It can tell them who they admire, what they want, and where they can grow. Being envious of another person can seem negative at that moment but has the potential to have positive effects in the future. For example, if a person envies someone who is successful it might drive them to work harder and to be more diligent which can in turn can attribute to their success in the long run.


==Envy and Adolescence==

Children show evidence of envy at an early age. Adults can be just as envious, however, they tend to be better at concealing the emotion. Envy plays a significant role in the development of adolescents. Comparing oneself is a universal aspect of human nature. No matter the age or culture, social comparison happens all over the globe. Comparison can range from physical attributes, material possessions and intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=festinger |first1=Leon |date=May 1, 1954 |pages=117-140 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/001872675400700202}}&lt;/ref&gt; However,children are more likely to envy over material objects such as shoes, video games, iPhone ect. Kids believe these material objects are correlated to their status.

 Social status has been found to have a strong connection with self-esteem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harter |first1=Susan |title=The Construction of the Self: Developmental and Sociocultural Foundations |date=2012 |publisher=Guilford Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;.An adolescents self-esteem is very fragile during early years and is heavily impacted by peer opinion.  If a child is comfortable with who they are and self-confident they are less likely to become envious of others material objects because they do not self-identify with materials. Material objects are not the only things that adolescents become envious over, however it is the most prevalent.

As children get older they develop stronger non-materialistic envy such as romantic relationships, physical appearance, achievement, and popularity.  Sometimes envious feelings are internalized in children, having a negative impact on their self-esteem. Envy comes from comparing, these comparisons can serve as a reminder that they have failed social norms and do not fit in with their peers. A feeling of inadequacy can arise and become destructive to a child’s happiness and cause further internal damage.

A child's identity is formed during their early years. Identity development is considered the central task during adolescence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erikson |first1=Erik |title=Identity Youth and Crisis |date=1968 |publisher=W.W. Norton and Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;. When children grow up understanding who they are, they are able to better define what their strengths and weaknesses are while comparing themselves to others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marcia |first1=James |title=Ego Identity}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Comparison can have two outcomes, it can be healthy in aiding in self-improvement or it can be unhealthy and result in envy/jealousy which can develop into depression. This is why self-exploration and identity development are critical in adolescent years.

It is important to identify healthy and unhealthy envy in a child at an early age. If a child is showing signs of unhealthy envy, it is best to teach the child productive ways to handle these emotions. It is much easier to teach a child how to control their emotions while they are young rather than allowing them to develop a habit that is hard to break when they are older.

==Envy and adulthood==
The things that drive people mad with envy changes throughout their lifetime. Studies have shown that the younger the person, the more likely they are to be envious of others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dahl |first1=Melissa |title=How Envy Changes as You Get Older |url=https://www.thecut.com/2015/11/how-envy-changes-as-you-get-older.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Adults under the age of 30 are more likely to experience envy compared to those 30 years and older. However, what people become envious over differs across adulthood. 

Younger adults, under the age of 30, have been found to envy others social status, relationships, and attractiveness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dahl |first1=Melissa |title=How Envy Changes as You Get Older |url=https://www.thecut.com/2015/11/how-envy-changes-as-you-get-older.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This starts to fade when a person hits there 30's, typically, at this point in life the person begins to accept who they are as an individual and compare themselves to others less often. However, they still envy others, just over different aspects in life, such as, career or salary &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dahl |first1=Melissa |title=How Envy Changes As You Get Older |url=https://www.thecut.com/2015/11/how-envy-changes-as-you-get-older.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Studies have shown a decrease in envy as a person ages, however, envious feelings over money was the only thing that consistently increased as a person got older &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dahl |first1=Melissa |title=How Envy Changes as You Get Older |url=https://www.thecut.com/2015/11/how-envy-changes-as-you-get-older.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

As a person ages, they begin to accept their social status. Nonetheless, envious feelings will be present throughout a persons life. It is up to the individual on whether they will let these envious feelings motivate or destroy them.
== Narcissists ==
Individuals with [[narcissistic personality disorder]] are often envious of others or believe others are envious of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/narcissisticpd.htm Narcissistic personality disorder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108003738/http://behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/narcissisticpd.htm |date=2010-01-08 }} - [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [[American Psychiatric Association]] (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In philosophy ==
[[Aristotle]] (in [[Rhetoric]]) defined envy (φθόνος ''phthonos'') "as the pain caused by the good fortune of others",&lt;ref name="Pedrick "&gt;{{cite book|last=Pedrick|first=Victoria|author2=Oberhelman, Steven M.|year=2006|title=The Soul of Tragedy: Essays on Athenian Drama|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-0-226-65306-8|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Page:The ethics of Aristotle.djvu/68|2.7.1108b1-10]]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] defined it as "a reluctance to see our own well-being overshadowed by another's because the standard we use to see how well off we are is not the intrinsic worth of our own well-being but how it compares with that of others" (in [[Metaphysics of Morals]]).

== Religious views ==

=== In Buddhism ===
{{see also|Irshya}}

In Buddhism, the term [[irshya]] is commonly translated as either envy or jealousy. ''Irshya'' is defined as a state of mind in which one is highly agitated to obtain wealth and honor for oneself, but unable to bear the excellence of others.

The term ''[[mudita]]'' (sympathetic joy) is defined as taking joy in the good fortune of others. This virtue is considered the [[Antidote (Buddhism)|antidote]] to envy and the opposite of [[schadenfreude]].

Both in the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]] there are various descriptions of envy and events related to it, mostly with a dramatic outcome.

Envy is one of the [[Seven deadly sins]] in [[Roman Catholicism]]. In the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'' envy is said to be the motivation behind [[Cain and Abel|Cain]] murdering his brother, [[Cain and Abel|Abel]], as Cain envied Abel because God favored Abel's sacrifice over Cain's.

=== In Hinduism ===
"One who does not envy but is a compassionate friend to all ... such a devotee is very dear to Me." - [[Lord Krishna]] in the [[Bhagavad Gita]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20120116154250/http://vedabase.net/bg/12/13-14/en Chapter 12, Verse 15.]

In [[Hinduism]], envy is considered a disastrous emotion. Hinduism maintains that anything which causes the mind to lose balance with itself leads to misery. This concept is put forth in the epic [[Mahabharata]], wherein [[Duryodhana]] launches the [[Kurukshetra war]] out of envy of the perceived prosperity of his cousins. He is known to have remarked:

"Father! The prosperity of the [[Pandavas]] (cousins) is burning me deeply! I cannot eat, sleep or live in the knowledge that they are better off than me!"

Thus, Hinduism teaches that envy can be overcome simply by recognizing that the man or woman who is the object of one's envy is merely enjoying the fruits of their past karmic actions and that one should not allow such devious emotions to take control of their mind, lest they suffer the same fate as the antagonists of the [[Mahabharata]].

=== In Islam ===
In [[Islam]], envy (Hassad حسد in Arabic) is an impurity of the heart and can destroy one's good deeds.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} One must be content with what God has willed and believe in the justice of the creator. A Muslim should not allow his envy to inflict harm upon the envied person. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

[[Muhammad]] said, "Do not envy each other, do not hate each other, do not oppose each other, and do not cut relations, rather be servants of Allah as brothers. It is not permissible for a Muslim to disassociate from his brother for more than three days such that they meet and one ignores the other, and the best of them is the one who initiates the salaam." Sahih al-Bukhari [Eng. Trans. 8/58 no. 91], Sahih Muslim [Eng. Trans. 4/1360 no. 6205, 6210]

A Muslim may wish for himself a blessing like that which someone else has, without wanting it to be taken away from the other person. This is permissible and is not called hasad. Rather, it is called ghibtah.

"There is to be no envy except in two cases: (towards) a person to whom Allah has granted wisdom, and who rules by this and teaches it to the people, and (towards) a person to whom Allah has granted wealth and property along with the power to spend it in the cause of the Truth." [Al-Bukhaari &amp; Muslim]

=== In Judaism ===
In Judaism (in the Hebrew Bible 'jealousy', is a key feature of God's personality – He is furious in jealousy (for His own people's undivided worship).  YeHoVaH is jealous for His own.  {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}
The God of Israel is, "slow to anger and great in compassion" (Exodus 34:6) but when His jealousy and anger had accumulated there was an outburst of punishment. (Exodus 34:6; Numbers 14:18; Psalm 103:8; Ps 86:15; Ps 145:8; Jonah 4:2; Nahum 1:3; Nehemiah 9:17; Joel 2:13  etc.)
While jealousy is branded as a negative and unwanted emotion generally in society today and also in Christianity, which had developed out of Judaism, in the Biblical (so-called Old Testament) context it is a strong aspect of God's character and therefor not a flawed characteristic – unlike envy, which God does denounce. (Exodus 20:14; Deuteronomy 5:9 and verse18)  
We envy people when we want what they have.  We are jealous when we want to keep for ourselves what belongs exclusively to us.  Therefore we see the frightening permission God gave husbands who became jealous of their wives, to make them take a curse upon themselves, in case they had slept with another man while they belonged to their husband. (Numbers 5:11 – 31)
This points to the intimacy and exclusivity He is interested in, from His own people.  Ephraim 'committed harlotry' against YHVH and thereby defiled the nation of Israel.  Therefore He withdrew Himself from them, to their detriment:  "Woe to those when I depart from them!" (Hosea 9:12), He warns.  "They will cry to YHVH, but he will hide His face from them". (Micah 3:4)  A wounded Lover speaking.  "You paid, but were not paid; for your harlotry. Therefore, oh harlot, hear the Word of YHVH:  I shall set My jealousy against you and they will deal furiously with you." (Ezekiel 23:25)
YHVH showed Ezekiel how the people in Jerusalem set up 'an image that provokes jealousy'.  (Ezekiel 8:11, 12,  1 Kings 14:22, 2 Chronicles 14:2)
God also loves like a jealous lover:  He told Moses to make a breastplate for Aaron the priest, to wear when he goes into the Most Holy Place.  On the breastplate he had to display the names of all the tribes of Israel, so He could see it whenever Aaron went in to work where YHVH's Presence was (Exodus 28:29).  Somewhere else He says, I have your name engraved in the palm of My hand.  (Isaiah 49:16)
The God of Israel wants with His people a marriage of faithfulness, fairness, kindness and compassion – and that they should know Him.  (Hosea 2:21,22)
He is even jealous for the land itself, the land of Israel.  (Joel 2:18)
"I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy..  YHVH will yet comfort Zion and will yet choose Jerusalem..  For I will be to her a wall of fire all around; and the glory in her midst." (Zechariah 1:14, 17, Zechariah 2:9)
The Hebrew Bible says Judah provoked YHVH to jealousy with all their sins and their false gods. (1 Kings 14:22)  There is a notable difference in meaning between jealousy (of something that is one's own) and envy (which is covetousness of another one's possessions). (Exodus 20: 14; Proverbs 27:4)

== Cultural references ==
In English-speaking cultures, envy is often associated with the color [[green]], as in "green with envy", and [[yellow]].&lt;ref name="Eva Heller 2000 pg. 33"&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur- effets et symboliques'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Yellow is the color of ambivalence and contradiction; a color associated with optimism and amusement; but also with betrayal, duplicity, and jealousy.&lt;ref name="Eva Heller 2000 pg. 33"/&gt; The phrase "green-eyed monster" refers to an individual whose current actions appear [[Motivation|motivated]] by jealousy not envy. This is based on a line from Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]''. Shakespeare mentions it also in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' when Portia states: "How all the other passions fleet to air, as doubtful thoughts and rash embraced despair and shuddering fear and green-eyed jealousy!"

The character [[List of Fullmetal Alchemist characters#Envy|Envy]] from [[Fullmetal Alchemist]] series is one of the seven homunculi named after the seven deadly sins.

The character of Zelena on ABC's ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', takes on the title "The Wicked Witch of the West" after envy itself dyes her skin in the episode "It's Not Easy Being Green".

In the [[parable]] "Garden of Statues",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shonmehta.com/2014/08/garden-of-statues_10.html |title= Garden of Statues }}&lt;/ref&gt; a character goes mad with envy because of all the attention his sculptor neighbor is getting.

In [[Nelson W. Aldrich Jr.|Nelson W. Aldrich Jr.'s]] ''Old Money'', he states that people who suffer from a case of malicious envy are blind to what good things they already have, thinking they have nothing, causing them to feel emptiness and despair.&lt;ref name="Hacker, Diana 1996. p. 23"/&gt;

}}
'''Evander Holyfield vs. Mike Tyson II''', billed as "'''The Sound and the Fury'''" and afterwards infamously referred to as "'''The Bite Fight'''", was a professional boxing match contested on June 28, 1997 for the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Heavyweight Championship. It achieved notoriety as one of the most bizarre fights in boxing history, after Tyson bit off part of Holyfield's ear. Tyson was disqualified from the match and lost his boxing license, though it was later reinstated.  

The fight took place at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. The [[Referee (boxing)|referee]] officiating the fight was [[Mills Lane]], who was brought in as a late replacement when Tyson's camp protested the original selection of [[Mitch Halpern]] (who officiated the first fight) as the referee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canoe.ca/BoxingTysonHolyfield/jun28_ref.html Lane late replacement, center of action], ''[[Associated Press|AP]] via Slam! Boxing'', 1997-06-29, Retrieved on 2007-03-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Tyson and Holyfield [[Mike Tyson vs. Evander Holyfield|fought]] seven months earlier in Las Vegas. Tyson was making his first defense of the WBA championship he had won from [[Bruce Seldon]] in a first round knockout. Holyfield, despite being a former champion, was a significant underdog entering the match as he had been rather lackluster in several fights since he returned to fighting in 1995 after a brief retirement. However, Holyfield surprised Tyson by controlling the contest and knocked him down in the sixth round. Halpern stopped the fight in the eleventh round, giving Holyfield an upset victory.{{citation needed|date = February 2017}}

{{refimprove|section|date=June 2011}}
The fight began with Holyfield dominating Tyson. Holyfield won the first three rounds. At 2:19 of the first round, an overhand right from Holyfield stunned Tyson, but Tyson fought back immediately pushing Holyfield backwards. At 32 seconds into the second round, Holyfield ducked under a right from Tyson. In doing so, he head-butted Tyson, opening a large cut over the latter's right eye (although trainer Ritchie Giachetti believed the cut happened in the first round). Tyson had repeatedly complained about head-butting in the first bout between the two fighters. Upon reviewing replays, referee Mills Lane stated the headbutts were unintentional and nonpunishable.&lt;ref name="butt1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/464513.stm Tyson: 'I'd bite again'], ''[[BBC]] Sports'',  1999-10-04, Retrieved on 2007-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the third round was about to begin, Tyson came out of his corner without his mouthpiece. Lane ordered Tyson back to his corner to insert it. Tyson inserted his mouthpiece, got back into position and the match resumed. Tyson began the third round with a furious attack. With forty seconds remaining in the round, Holyfield got Tyson in a clinch, and Tyson rolled his head above Holyfield's shoulder and bit Holyfield on his right ear. The bite avulsed a one-inch piece of cartilage from the top of the ear, and Tyson spit out the piece of ear onto the ring floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weinberg|first1=Rick|title=30: Tyson bites Holyfield's ear in rematch|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=moments/30|website=ESPN.com|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Holyfield shrieked in pain and jumped in circles, he managed to push Tyson away, at which point Lane called for a time-out. As Holyfield turned to walk to his corner, Tyson shoved him from behind. Lane sent Tyson to a neutral corner as an enraged Holyfield gestured for Mills Lane to look at his bitten ear, which was rapidly bleeding.

The fight was delayed for several minutes as Lane debated what to do. Lane's original decision was to immediately disqualify Tyson, but after the ringside doctor determined that Holyfield was able to continue despite the massive bite, Lane announced he would be deducting two points from Tyson and the fight would continue. [[Bobby Czyz]], who was calling the fight with [[Steve Albert]] for [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]], said, "I wonder how this would have played in [[Mitch Halpern]]'s eyes," and Albert told Czyz, "That's a thought, Bobby." As Lane explained the decision to Tyson and his cornermen, Tyson asserted that the injury to Holyfield's ear was the result of a punch. "Bullshit," Lane retorted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brookhouse|first1=Brent|title=Great moments in heavyweight rematch history: Tyson vs Holyfield II and 'The Bite'|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2012/12/25/3802010/ufc-155-great-heavyweight-rematch-history-tyson-holyfield-II-ear-bite|accessdate=6 March 2015|agency=SB Nation|publisher=[[Vox Media Inc.]]|date=December 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight was resumed.

During another clinch, Tyson bit Holyfield's left ear. Holyfield threw his hands around to get out of the clinch and jumped back. Tyson's second bite just scarred Holyfield's ear. Lane did not stop the fight this time, so the two men continued fighting until time expired. The men walked back to their respective corners, and when the second bite was discovered, the fight was stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lutz|first1=Tom|title=Mike Tyson 'wanted to kill' Evander Holyfield|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/23/mike-tyson-evander-holyfield-ear-bite|accessdate=6 March 2015|agency=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media|date=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-fight unrest===
After the fight was stopped, Tyson went on a rampage at Holyfield and his trainer Brooks while they were still in their corner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friend|first1=Tom|title=Tyson Disqualified for Biting Holyfield's Ears|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/29/sports/tyson-disqualified-for-biting-holyfield-s-ears.html|accessdate=6 March 2015|agency=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=June 29, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mills Lane told Tyson's corner that he was disqualifying Tyson for biting Holyfield. To protect Holyfield, security surrounded him in his corner and Tyson was taken back to his corner by security. Mills Lane was interviewed, and  said he knew from experience that the bites were intentional. He had told Tyson not to bite anymore, and said Tyson asked to be disqualified by disobeying that order. Holyfield left the ring seconds after the interview, which gave the fans and audience the hint that the fight was over. Holyfield told the press afterward that Tyson bit him because he knew he was going to get knocked out and he chose to lose in a disqualification instead.{{fact|date=November 2015}}

Reporters then interviewed Mike Tyson's instructor, who was upset about Lane's decision. The instructor said, "They will have to explain that. I do not agree with it but it is what it is...all I know is Mike Tyson has a cut in his eye."{{fact|date=November 2015}}

Twenty-five minutes after the brawl ended, announcer [[Jimmy Lennon Jr]]. read the decision: "Ladies and gentlemen, this bout has been stopped at the end of round number three. The referee in charge, Mills Lane, disqualifies Mike Tyson for biting Evander Holyfield in both ears, the winner by way of disqualification and still the WBA Champion of the world, Evander 'The Real Deal' Holyfield!" As a result Holyfield remained the WBA Heavyweight champion.

Tyson said it was retaliation for the headbutts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesweetscience.com/article-archive/2009/7287-mike-tyson-tells-oprah-why-he-bit-evander-holyfield|title=Mike Tyson Tells Oprah Why He Bit Evander Holyfield – The Sweet Science|website=thesweetscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, during post-match interviews, Tyson was walking back to his locker room when a fan from the stadium tossed a bottle of water in his direction. Tyson, his instructor and a pain manager climbed over a temporary railing and up into the stands, made obscene gestures to the crowd, and made their way up the side of a stairway. Tyson had to be restrained as he was led off. When interviewed about his championship and the incident with Tyson, Holyfield said he already forgave Tyson for biting him since he has 100% faith in God and Jesus.

Nonetheless, Tyson was sentenced with a permanent suspension from boxing and his license cancelled indefinitely. Tyson was also fined $3,000,000 and had to serve a period of community service. After a year and an appeal in court, Tyson's license was reinstated. When Tyson and Holyfield retired from boxing they befriended each other and are now close friends today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawes|first1=Mike|title=Come ear and give me a hug!

==Aftermath==
The fight generated a total revenue of $180,000,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|180000000|1997|r=-6}}|}}), from [[live gate]], [[pay-per-view]], closed-circuit telecasts, foreign television rights, and casino profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tragedy Beckons Tyson The Thug, The Quitter |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1997-07-05/sports/9707050120_1_tyson-holyfield-ring |work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |date=July 5, 1997 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of biting Holyfield on both ears and other behavior, Tyson's boxing license was revoked by the [[Nevada State Athletic Commission]] and he was fined [[United States dollar|$]]3 million plus legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canoe.ca/BoxingTysonHolyfield/jul9_banned.html Tyson banned for life], ''[[Associated Press|AP]] via Slam! Boxing'', 1997-07-09, Retrieved on 2007-03-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The revocation was not permanent; a little more than a year later on October 18, 1998, the commission voted 4–1 to restore Tyson's boxing license.&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.espn.go.com/boxing/news/2002/0129/1319772.html Mike Tyson timeline], ''[[ESPN.com]]'', 2002-01-29, Retrieved on 2009-03-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 documentary ''[[Tyson (2008 film)|Tyson]]'', the boxer claimed he did it as retaliation for the headbutting.

On October 16, 2009 on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', Tyson apologized to Holyfield. Holyfield accepted his apology and forgave Tyson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Mike-Tyson-Apologizes-to-Evander-Holyfield-Video|title=Mike Tyson Apologizes Video|website=oprah.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A book entitled ''The Bite Fight'' was made in 2013 by George Willis, illustrating the lives of Tyson and Holyfield before, during, and after the fight.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5158">In any of several studies that treat the use of [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]s—for example, in [[linguistics]], [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[semantics]], and [[semiotics]]—the '''extension''' of a concept, idea, or [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] consists of the things to which it applies, in contrast with its [[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]] or [[intension]], which consists very roughly of the ideas, properties, or corresponding signs that are implied or suggested by the concept in question.

In philosophical [[semantics]] or the [[philosophy of language]], the 'extension' of a concept or expression is the set of things it extends to, or applies to, if it is the sort of concept or expression that a single object by itself can satisfy.  Concepts and expressions of this sort are [[monad (Greek philosophy)|monadic]] or "one-place" concepts and expressions.

So the extension of the word "dog" is the set of all (past, present and future) dogs in the world: the set includes Fido, Rover, [[Lassie]], Rex, and so on.  The extension of the phrase "Wikipedia reader" includes each person who has ever read Wikipedia, including ''you''.

The extension of a whole statement, as opposed to a word or phrase, is defined (since [[Frege]] 1892) as its [[truth value]]. So the extension of "Lassie is famous" is the logical value 'true', since Lassie is famous.

Some concepts and expressions are such that they don't apply to objects individually, but rather serve to relate objects to objects.  For example, the words "before" and "after" do not apply to objects individually—it makes no sense to say "Jim is before" or "Jim is after"—but to one thing in relation to another, as in "The wedding is before the reception" and "The reception is after the wedding".  Such "relational" or "polyadic" ("many-place") concepts and expressions have, for their extension, the set of all sequences of objects that satisfy the concept or expression in question.  So the extension of "before" is the set of all (ordered) pairs of objects such that the first one is before the second one.

== Mathematics ==
In [[mathematics]], the 'extension' of a mathematical concept is the [[set (mathematics)|set]] that is specified by that concept.{{clarify|date=October 2016}}

For example, the extension of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is a set of [[ordered pair]]s that pair up the arguments and values of the function; in other words, the function's graph.  The extension of an object in [[abstract algebra]], such as a [[Group (mathematics)|group]], is the [[underlying set]] of the object. The extension of a set is the set itself. That a set can capture the notion of the extension of anything is the idea behind the [[axiom of extensionality]] in [[axiomatic set theory]].

This kind of extension is used so constantly in contemporary mathematics based on [[set theory]] that it can be called an implicit assumption.

== Computer science ==

In [[computer science]], some [[database]] textbooks use the term 'intension' to refer to the [[logical schema|schema]] of a database, and 'extension' to refer to particular [[Row (database)|instance]]s of a database.

== Metaphysical implications ==

There is an ongoing controversy in [[metaphysics]] about whether or not there are, in addition to actual, existing things, non-actual or nonexistent things.  If there are—if, for instance, there are possible but non-actual dogs (dogs of some non-actual but possible species, perhaps) or nonexistent beings (like Sherlock Holmes, perhaps)—then these things might also figure in the extensions of various concepts and expressions.  If not, only existing, actual things can be in the extension of a concept or expression.  Note that "actual" may not mean the same as "existing".  Perhaps there exist things that are merely possible, but not actual.  (Maybe they exist in other universes, and these universes are other "[[possible worlds]]"—possible alternatives to the actual world.)  Perhaps some actual things are nonexistent.  (Sherlock Holmes seems to be an ''actual'' example of a fictional character; one might think there are many other characters [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] ''might'' have invented, though he actually invented Holmes.)

A similar problem arises for objects that no longer exist.  The extension of the term "Socrates", for example, seems to be a (currently) non-existent object.  [[Free logic]] is one attempt to avoid some of these problems.

== General semantics ==

Some fundamental formulations in the field of [[general semantics]] rely heavily on a valuation of extension over [[intension]]. See for example extension, and the [[#External links|extensional devices]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4471">An '''eye poke''', '''eye jab''', '''eye stab''', '''eye strike''' or '''poke in the eye''' is a strike at the eye or eyes of a human or animal.  It is typically made with the fingers which may either be forked to jab both eyes or held together, like a bird's beak, to strike with force and protect the fingers from damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter=The Eye Jab |page=60 |title=Martial Arts Techniques for Law Enforcement |author=Mike Young |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8048-3794-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=32 |title=Complete Krav Maga |chapter=Eye Strike |author=Darren Levine, John Whitman |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-56975-573-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack became better known among the public due to its use in comedy; the idea of using it to entertain was likely invented by the [[vaudeville]]  duo of [[Joe Weber (vaudevillian)|Joe Weber]] and [[Lew Fields]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Epstein|first=Lawrence J.|title=Mixed nuts: America's love affair with comedy teams : from Burns and Allen to Belushi and Aykroyd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8g6YQTuBYQ8C&amp;pg=PA34|year=2004|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=1-58648-190-8|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
In sporting events, a losing fighter will sometimes break the rules, and poke someone in the eye leading to the fight be ended as "no decision," thus preventing them from taking a loss.&lt;ref name="yahoo1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Holden |first=Eric |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/ufc-address-eye-poke-issue-wake-wagner-prados-145700724--mma.html |title=How Should the UFC Address the "Eye Poke" Issue in the Wake of Wagner Prado's Fight at UFC on Fox 4?

==Self defense==
In a street fight situation, when one's opponent may be trying to inflict serious harm, martial arts expert [[Kelly McCann]] advises that the eyes should be a "persistent primary target".&lt;ref name = "kelly"/&gt; An eye poke needs little power to be effective, and it can stop even highly determined attackers. If the hand is kept at an approximately 45° angle to the opponent's face during the strike, there is less risk of hurting ones fingers, and even if they do not connect with the eye, the palm can impact on the opponent's face.&lt;ref name = "kelly"&gt;''Combatives for street survival '', by [[Kelly McCann]], Black Belt Books, {{ISBN|0-89750-176-4}}, (2010, second edition) p 126&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Perhaps not a well known source to the average academic, this is considered one of the most authoritative books on street fighting, its been enthusiastically endorsed by celebrated warriors including [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General A M Gray]] --&gt;

==Comedy==
The eye poke was a signature move in the [[slapstick]] antics of the comedy and vaudeville act [[The Three Stooges]], who mastered the technique.

'''Food versus fuel''' is the dilemma regarding the risk of diverting farmland or crops for [[biofuel]]s production to the detriment of the [[food supply]]. The biofuel and [[food price]] debate involves wide-ranging views, and is a long-standing, controversial one in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7026105.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Will biofuel leave the poor hungry?|author=Maggie Ayre |date=2007-10-03|language=|accessdate=2008-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farmfutures.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=CD26BEDECA4A4946A1283CC7786AEB5A&amp;nm=News&amp;type=news&amp;mod=News&amp;mid=9A02E3B96F2A415ABC72CB5F516B4C10&amp;tier=3&amp;nid=BA3B97B230724D7C904E54CB50E9E9B5|title=The Biofuel Smear Campaign|publisher=Farm Futures|author=Mike Wilson|date=2008-02-08|accessdate=2008-04-28|language=}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1725975,00.html|title=The Clean Energy Scam|publisher=Time Magazine|author=Michael Grundwald|date=2008-03-27|accessdate=2008-04-28|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="babcock"&gt;[http://ictsd.org/downloads/2011/12/the-impact-of-us-biofuel-policies-on-agricultural-price-levels-and-volatility.pdf The Impact of US Biofuel Policies on Agricultural Price Levels and Volatility], By Bruce A.

June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; There is disagreement about the significance of the issue, what is causing it, and what can or should be done to remedy the situation. This complexity and uncertainty is due to the large number of impacts and feedback loops that can positively or negatively affect the price system. Moreover, the relative strengths of these positive and negative impacts vary in the short and long terms, and involve delayed effects. The academic side of the debate is also blurred by the use of different [[economic model]]s and competing forms of statistical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/hlpe/hlpe_documents/HLPE_Reports/HLPE-Report-5_Biofuels_and_food_security.pdf |title=Biofuels and food security |author=HLPE |date=June 2013 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biofuel production has increased in recent years. Some commodities like [[maize]] (corn), [[sugar cane]] or [[vegetable oil]] can be used either as food, feed, or to make biofuels.  For example, since 2006, a portion of land that was also formerly used to grow other crops in the United States is now used to grow corn for biofuels, and a larger share of corn is destined to [[ethanol]] production, reaching 25% in 2007.&lt;ref name="25perc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1684910,00.html?iid=sphere-inline-sidebar|title=After the Oil Crisis, a Food Crisis? |author= Kathleen Kingsbury|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=2008-04-28|date=2007-11-16|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Second generation biofuels]] could potentially combine farming for food and fuel and moreover, electricity could be generated simultaneously, which could be beneficial for developing countries and rural areas in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1039/b822951c |author1=Oliver R.

With global demand for biofuels on the increase due to the [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil price increases taking place since 2003]] and the desire to reduce oil dependency as well as reduce [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions from transportation, there is also fear of the potential [[destruction of habitats]] by being [[land conversion|converted]] into farmland.&lt;ref name="FT_OECD"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e780d216-5fd5-11dc-b0fe-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1 | title= OECD Warns Against Biofuels Subsidies|date=2007-09-10|author=Andrew Bounds|publisher=Financial Times |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental groups have raised concerns about this trade-off for several years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2004/11/23/feeding-cars-not-people/|title=Feeding Cars, Not People |author=George Monbiot|publisher=Monbiot.com|accessdate=2008-04-28|date=2004-11-23|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climnet.org/EUenergy/2006_EEB_BiofuelsStrategy.pdf |format=PDF |title=Biofuels no panacea |author=European Environmental Bureau |accessdate=2008-04-28 |date=2006-02-08 |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410052938/http://www.climnet.org/EUenergy/2006_EEB_BiofuelsStrategy.pdf |archivedate=2008-04-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/32656/story.htm|title=Food Security Worries Could Limit China Biofuels |author=Planet Ark|accessdate=2008-04-28|date=2005-09-26|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/climate/biofuels-green-dream-or-climate-change-nightmare-20070509|title=Biofuels: green dream or climate change nightmare|author=Greenpeace UK|accessdate=2008-04-28|date=2007-05-09|language=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421113313/http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/climate/biofuels-green-dream-or-climate-change-nightmare-20070509|archivedate=2008-04-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the debate reached a global scale due to the [[2007–2008 world food price crisis]].

Biofuels are not a new phenomenon. Before the [[industrialisation]], horses were the primary (and humans probably the secondary) source of power for transportation and physical work, requiring food. The growing of crops for horses (typically [[oat]]) for carrying out physical work is of course comparable to the growing of crops for biofuels for engines, albeit on a smaller scale, because production since then has increased.

==Food price inflation==
From 1974 to 2005 real food prices (adjusted for inflation) dropped by 75%. Food commodity prices were relatively stable after reaching lows in 2000 and 2001.&lt;ref name="WorldBank_07_08"/&gt; Therefore, recent rapid food price increases are considered extraordinary.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt;  A [[World Bank]] policy research working paper published in July 2008 found that the increase in food commodities prices was led by grains, with sharp price increases in 2005 despite record crops worldwide. From January 2005 until June 2008, [[maize]] prices almost tripled, [[wheat]] increased 127 percent, and [[rice]] rose 170 percent. The increase in [[grain price]]s was followed by increases in fats and oil prices in mid-2006. On the other hand, the study found that [[sugar cane]] production has increased rapidly, and it was large enough to keep sugar price increases small except for 2005 and early 2006. The paper concluded that [[biofuel]]s produced from grains have raised food prices in combination with other related factors between 70 to 75 percent, but ethanol produced from sugar cane has not contributed significantly to the recent increase in food commodities prices.&lt;ref name="WorldBank_07_08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Veja_28_07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt;

== Proposed causes ==

===Ethanol fuel as an oxygenate additive===

The demand for ethanol fuel produced from [[field corn]] was spurred in the U.S. by the discovery that [[Methyl tert-butyl ether|methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE)]] was contaminating groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/petroleum/feature_articles/2006/mtbe2006/mtbe2006.pdf|format=PDF|title=Eliminating MTBE in Gasoline in 2006|date=2006-02-22|publisher=Environmental Information Administration|accessdate=2008-08-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822000011/http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/petroleum/feature_articles/2006/mtbe2006/mtbe2006.pdf|archivedate=2008-08-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ethanol"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Goettemoeller, Jeffrey |author2=Adrian Goettemoeller | title = Sustainable Ethanol: Biofuels, Biorefineries, Cellulosic Biomass, Flex-Fuel Vehicles, and Sustainable Farming for Energy Independence | year = 2007| publisher = Prairie Oak Publishing, Maryville, Missouri |page=42 |language=| isbn = 978-0-9786293-0-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MTBE use as an [[oxygenate]] additive was widespread due to mandates of the [[Clean Air Act (1990)|Clean Air Act]] amendments of 1992 to reduce [[carbon monoxide]] emissions. As a result, by 2006 MTBE use in gasoline was banned in almost 20 states. There was also concern that widespread and costly litigation might be taken against the U.S. gasoline suppliers, and a 2005 decision refusing legal protection for MTBE, opened a new market for ethanol fuel, the primary substitute for MTBE.&lt;ref name="Ethanol"/&gt; At a time when corn prices were around US$2 a [[bushel]], corn growers recognized the potential of this new market and delivered accordingly. This demand shift took place at a time when [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil prices]] were already significantly rising.

===Other factors===

That food prices went up at the same time fuel prices went up is not surprising and should not be entirely blamed on biofuels.

Over long time periods [[population growth]] and [[climate change]] could cause food prices to go up.  However, these factors have been around for many years and food prices have jumped up in the last 3 years, so their contribution to the current problem is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/14/business/worldbusiness/14food.html?_r=3&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;adxnnlx=1210858219-6h6cWsH086zu54tvcDuKXw | work=The New York Times | title=Indians Find U.S. at Fault in Food Cost | first=Heather | last=Timmons | date=2008-05-14 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government regulations of food and fuel markets===

France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States governments have supported biofuels with tax breaks, mandated use, and subsidies.  These policies have the [[unintended consequence]] of diverting resources from food production and leading to surging food prices and the potential destruction of natural habitats.&lt;ref name="FT_OECD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.economist.com/research/articlesBySubject/displaystory.cfm?subjectid=7216688&amp;story_id=10252015 | title= The Economist – The End Of Cheap Food | date=2007-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuel for agricultural use often does not have [[fuel tax]]es (farmers get duty-free petrol or diesel fuel).  Biofuels may have subsidies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20070501faessay86305/c-ford-runge-benjamin-senauer/how-biofuels-could-starve-the-poor.html Foreign Affairs - How Biofuels Could Starve the Poor - C.

The net result is that it is possible for a farmer to use more than a gallon of fuel to make a gallon of biofuel and still make a profit. There have been thousands of scholarly papers analyzing how much energy goes into making ethanol from corn and how that compares to the energy in the ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=corn+ethanol+(%22energy+gain%22+OR+%22energy+balance%22)&amp;btnG=Search|title=corn ethanol ("energy gain" OR "energy balance") - Google Scholar|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[World Bank]] policy research working paper concluded that food prices have risen by 35 to 40 percent between 2002 and 2008, of which 70 to 75 percent is attributable to [[biofuel]]s.&lt;ref name="WorldBank_07_08"/&gt; The "month-by-month" five-year analysis disputes that increases in global grain consumption and droughts were responsible for significant price increases, reporting that this had only a marginal impact. Instead the report argues that the EU and US drive for biofuels has had by far the biggest impact on food supply and prices, as increased production of biofuels in the US and EU were supported by subsidies and tariffs on imports, and considers that without these policies, price increases would have been smaller. This research also concluded that [[Brazil]]'s sugar cane based ethanol has not raised sugar prices significantly, and recommends removing tariffs on ethanol imports by both the US and EU, to allow more efficient producers such as Brazil and other developing countries, including many African countries, to produce ethanol profitably for export to meet the mandates in the EU and the US.&lt;ref name="Veja_28_07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt;

An economic assessment published by the [[OECD]] in July 2008&lt;ref name="OECD_07_08"/&gt; agrees with the World Bank report recommendations regarding the negative effects of subsidies and import tariffs, but found that the estimated impact of biofuels on food prices are much smaller. The OECD study found that trade restrictions, mainly through import tariffs, protect the domestic industry from foreign competitors but impose a cost burden on domestic biofuel users and limits alternative suppliers. The report is also critical of limited reduction of [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions achieved from biofuels based on feedstocks used in Europe and North America, finding that the current biofuel support policies would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transport fuel by no more than 0.8% by 2015, while Brazilian ethanol from sugar cane reduces greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% compared to fossil fuels. The assessment calls for the need for more open markets in biofuels and feedstocks in order to improve efficiency and lower costs.&lt;ref name="OECDweb08"/&gt;

===Oil price increases===

[[Oil price increases since 2003]] resulted in increased demand for biofuels.  Transforming [[vegetable oil]] into [[biodiesel]] is not very hard or costly so there is a profitable [[arbitrage]] situation if vegetable oil is much cheaper than [[Diesel fuel|diesel]].  Diesel is also made from [[crude oil]], so vegetable oil prices are partially linked to crude oil prices.  Farmers can switch to growing vegetable oil crops if those are more profitable than food crops. So all food prices are linked to vegetable oil prices, and in turn to crude oil prices. A [[World Bank]] study concluded that oil prices and a weak dollar explain 25–30% of total price rise between January 2002 until June 2008.&lt;ref name="WorldBank_07_08"/&gt;

Demand for oil is outstripping the supply of oil and [[oil depletion]] is expected to cause crude oil prices to go up over the next 50 years. Record oil prices are inflating food prices worldwide, including those crops that have no relation to biofuels, such as rice and fish.&lt;ref name=sol&gt;[http://www.canada.com/components/print.aspx?id=e08c8e19-4a95-491c-9386-d30afeab5cdf&amp;sponsor= Biofuels are part of the solution]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany and Canada it is now much cheaper to heat a house by burning grain than by using fuel derived from crude oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.de/wirtschaft/immobilien/verbraucher/:Energie-Heizen-Weizen/553103.html|title=Energie: Heizen mit Weizen|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2005/10/14/grain_stove051014.html | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120728144754/http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2005/10/14/grain_stove051014.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-07-28 | work=CBC News | title=Grain gaining steam as home-heating option | date=2005-10-14 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grainburningstoves.ca/cost.php|title=Grain Burning Stoves by Prairie Fire Grain Energy.

When crude oil was at $25/barrel there was no economic incentive to switch to a [[corn stove|grain fed heater]].

From 1971 to 1973, around the time of the [[1973 oil crisis]], corn and wheat prices went up by a factor of 3.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.farmdoc.uiuc.edu/manage/pricehistory/PriceHistory.asp{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was no significant biofuel usage at that time.

The US - an important export country for food stocks - will convert 18% of its grain output to ethanol in 2008.

===Freeze on first generation biofuel production===

The prospects for the use of biofuels could change in a relatively dramatic way in 2014. Petroleum trade groups petitioned the EPA in August 2013 to take into consideration a reduction of renewable [[biofuel]] content in transportation fuels. On November 15, 2013 the United States EPA announced a review of the proportion of [[Ethanol fuel|ethanol]] that should be required by regulation. The standards established by the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]] could be modified significantly. The announcement allows sixty days for the submission of commentary about the proposal.&lt;ref name=EPA_Renewable_Fuel_Regs&gt;{{cite web|last=EPA|first=US EPA|title=2014 Renewable Fuel Standards for Renewable Fuel Standard program (RFS2): Notice of Proposed Rulemaking|url=http://www.epa.gov/otaq/fuels/renewablefuels/regulations.htm|work=Renewable Fuels: Regulations &amp; Standards|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT_Ethanol_Reduce&gt;{{cite news|last=Wald|first=Matthew L.|title=For First Time, E.P.A.

A 2007 UN report on biofuel also raises issues regarding food security and biofuel production. [[Jean Ziegler]], then UN Special Rapporteur on food, concluded that while the argument for biofuels in terms of energy efficiency and climate change are legitimate, the effects for the world's hungry of transforming wheat and maize crops into biofuel are "absolutely catastrophic", and terms such use of arable land a "crime against humanity".  Ziegler also calls for a 5-year moratorium on biofuel production.&lt;ref name="freeze"/&gt; Ziegler's proposal for a five-year ban was rejected by the U.N. Secretary [[Ban Ki-moon]], who called for a comprehensive review of the policies on biofuels, and said that "just criticising biofuel may not be a good solution".&lt;ref name="UNreject"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/apr/05/biofuels.food |title=UN chief calls for review of biofuels policy |author1=Julian Borger |publisher= The Guardian|date=2008-04-05|accessdate=2008-05-01|language= | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food surpluses exist in many developed countries. For example, the UK wheat surplus was around 2 million tonnes in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Defra figures after exports, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927161701/http://www.hgca.com/imprima/miprospects/vol08Issue05/minisite/2.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;  This surplus alone could produce sufficient bioethanol to replace around 2.5% of the UK's petroleum consumption, without requiring any increase in wheat cultivation or reduction in food supply or exports.  However, above a few percent,&lt;ref&gt;(i.e. if the UK wanted to replace more than around 5% of its fuel with biofuel).&lt;/ref&gt;  there would be direct competition between first generation biofuel production and food production.  This is one reason why many view [[second generation biofuels]] as increasingly important.

===Non-food crops for biofuel===

There are different types of biofuels and different feedstocks for them, and it has been proposed that only non-food crops be used for biofuel.  This avoids direct competition for commodities like [[maize|corn]] and [[Eating|edible]] [[vegetable oil]].  However, as long as farmers are able to derive a greater profit by switching to biofuels, they will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article.php?a_id=119281 Food versus fuel debate escalates&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobalist.com/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=5077 How Food and Fuel Compete for Land by Lester Brown - The Globalist &gt; &gt; Global Energy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112174512/http://www.theglobalist.com/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=5077 |date=January 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[law of supply and demand]] predicts that if fewer farmers are producing food the price of food will rise.&lt;ref name="economist" /&gt;

[[Second generation biofuels]] use [[lignocellulose|lignocellulosic]] raw material such as forest residues (sometimes referred to as [[brown waste]] and [[black liquor]] from [[Kraft process]] or [[sulfite process]] [[pulp mill]]s). Third generation biofuels ([[biofuel from algae]]) use non-edible raw materials sources that can be used for biodiesel and bioethanol. 

It has long been recognized that the huge supply of agricultural cellulose, the lignocellulosic material commonly referred to as "Nature's polymer", would be an ideal source of material for biofuels and many other products. Composed of lignin and monomer sugars such as glucose, fructose, arabinose, galactose, and xylose, these constituents are very valuable in their own right. To this point in history, there are some methods commonly used to coax "recalcitrant" cellulose to separate or hydrolyse into its lignin and sugar parts, treatment with; steam explosion, supercritical water, enzymes, acids and alkalines. All these methods involve heat or chemicals, are expensive, have lower conversion rates and produce waste materials. In recent years the rise of "mechanochemistry" has resulted in the use of ball mills and other mill designs to reduce cellulose to a fine powder in the presence of a catalyst, a common bentonite or kaolinite clay, that will hydrolyse the cellulose quickly and with low energy input into pure sugar and lignin. Still currently only in pilot stage, this promising technology offers the possibility that any agricultural economy might be able to get rid of its requirement to refine oil for transportation fuels. This would be a major improvement in carbon neutral energy sources and allow the continued use of internal combustion engines on a large scale.

==== Biodiesel ====
Soybean oil, which only represents half of the domestic raw materials available for biodiesel production in the United States, is one of many raw materials that can be used to produce biodiesel.&lt;ref name="biodiesel.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biodiesel.org/docs/default-source/ffs-basics/biodiesel-fueling-sustainability.pdf?sfvrsn=6|title=Biodiesel Fueling Sustainability|publisher=Biodiesel.org|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Non-food crop]]s like [[Camelina]], [[Jatropha]], [[seashore mallow]] and [[Mustard plant|mustard]],&lt;ref name="biodiesel.org"/&gt; used for biodiesel, can thrive on marginal agricultural land where many trees and crops won't grow, or would produce only slow growth yields. Camelina is virtually 100 percent efficient. It can be harvested and crushed for oil and the remaining parts can be used to produce high quality omega-3 rich animal feed, fiberboard, and glycerin. Camelina does not take away from land currently being utilized for food production. Most camelina acres are grown in areas that were previously not utilized for farming. For example, areas that receive limited rainfall that can not sustain corn or soybeans without the addition of irrigation can grow camelina and add to their profitability.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

[[Jatropha]] cultivation provides benefits for local communities:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Cultivation and fruit picking by hand is labour-intensive and needs around one person per hectare. In parts of rural India and Africa this provides much-needed jobs - about 200,000 people worldwide now find employment through jatropha. Moreover, villagers often find that they can grow other crops in the shade of the trees.

[[National Biodiesel Board|NBB]]’s Feedstock Development program is addressing production of [[arid]] variety crops, algae, waste greases, and other feedstocks on the horizon to expand available material for biodiesel in a sustainable manner.&lt;ref name="biodiesel.org"/&gt;

==== Bioalcohols ====

[[Cellulosic ethanol]] is a type of biofuel produced from [[lignocellulose]], a material that comprises much of the mass of plants. [[Corn stover]], [[switchgrass]], [[miscanthus]] and [[Wood pulp|woodchip]] are some of the more popular non-edible cellulosic materials for ethanol production. [[cellulosic ethanol commercialization|Commercial investment in such second-generation biofuels]] began in 2006/2007, and much of this investment went beyond pilot-scale plants. [[Cellulosic ethanol commercialization]] is moving forward rapidly. The world’s first commercial wood-to-ethanol plant began operation in Japan in 2007, with a capacity of 1.4 million liters/year. The first wood-to-ethanol plant in the United States is planned for 2008 with an initial output of 75 million liters/year.&lt;ref&gt;REN21 (2008). [http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/renewables2007.pdf Renewables 2007 Global Status Report (PDF)] p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other [[second generation biofuels]] may be commercialized in the future and compete less with food. [[Synthetic fuel]] can be made from [[coal]] or [[biomass]] and may be commercialized soon.

==== Bioprotein ====
Protein rich feed for cattle/fish/poultry can be produced from [[biogas]]/[[natural gas]] which is presently used as fuel source. Cultivation of ''[[Methylococcus capsulatus]]'' bacteria culture by consuming natural gas produces high protein rich feed  with tiny land and water foot print.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntva.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/04-huslid.pdf |title=BioProtein Production |access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2112298-food-made-from-natural-gas-will-soon-feed-farm-animals-and-us/ |title=Food made from natural gas will soon feed farm animals – and us |access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cargill.com/2016/new-venture-selects-cargill-tennessee-to-produce-feedkind |title=New venture selects Cargill’s Tennessee site to produce Calysta FeedKind® Protein |access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carbon dioxide gas produced as by product from these plants can also be  put to use in cheaper production of [[algae oil]] or [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]] from [[algaculture]] which can displace the prime position of crude oil in near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2015/01/20150121-algenol.html#more |title=Algenol and Reliance launch algae fuels demonstration project in India |accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/ExxonMobil-Announces-Breakthrough-In-Renewable-Energy.html |title=ExxonMobil Announces Breakthrough In Renewable Energy |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these proven technologies, abundant natural gas/ [[biogas]] availability can impart full global [[food security]] by producing highly nutrient food products with out any water pollution or [[green house gas]] (GHG) emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carbontrust.com/media/672719/calysta-feedkind.pdf |title=Assessment of environmental impact of FeedKind protein |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biofuel from food byproducts and coproducts===

Biofuels can also be produced from the [[waste]] [[byproduct]]s of food-based agriculture (such as [[citrus]] [[peel (fruit)|peel]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biomassmagazine.com/article.jsp?article_id=1278|title=FPL Energy finds partner for citrus-peel-to-ethanol plant|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[used vegetable oil]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ749869&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ749869|title=ERIC - Preparation and Viscosity of Biodiesel from New and Used Vegetable Oil: An Inquiry-Based Environmental Chemistry Laboratory, Journal of Chemical Education, 2006-Feb|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to manufacture an environmentally [[sustainable]] fuel supply, and reduce waste disposal cost.&lt;ref name="ars.usda.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publications.htm?seq_no_115=212331|title=ARS - Publication request: Economic analysis of ethanol production from citrus peel waste|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A growing percentage of U.S. biodiesel production is made from waste vegetable oil (recycled restaurant oils) and greases.&lt;ref name="biodiesel.org"/&gt;

[[Collocation]] of a waste generator with a waste-to-ethanol plant can reduce the waste producer's operating cost, while creating a more-profitable ethanol production business. This innovative collocation concept is sometimes called [[holistic]] [[systems engineering]]. Collocation disposal elimination may be one of the few cost-effective, environmentally sound, biofuel strategies, but its [[scalability]] is limited by availability of appropriate waste generation sources. For example, millions of tons of wet Florida-and-California citrus peels cannot supply billions of gallons of biofuels. Due to the higher cost of transporting ethanol, it is a local partial solution, at best.

===Biofuel subsidies and tariffs===
{{Update section|date=December 2017}}
Some people have claimed that ending subsidies and tariffs would enable [[sustainable development]] of a global biofuels market. Taxing biofuel imports while letting petroleum in duty-free does not fit with the goal of encouraging biofuels. Ending mandates, subsidies, and tariffs would end the distortions that current policy is causing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalwarminghoax.wordpress.com/2008/05/08/the-biofuel-dilemma/ The Biofuel Dilemma « The Global Warming Hoax&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The US ethanol tariff and some US ethanol subsidies are currently set to expire over the next couple years.{{when|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUKN0434878020080204 | work=Reuters | title=Bush budget doesn't alter ethanol import tariff | date=2008-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU is rethinking their [[biofuels directive]] due to environmental and social concerns.&lt;ref&gt;''EU rethinks biofuels guidelines'' By Roger Harrabin bbc.co.uk Monday, 14 January 2008 http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7186380.stm&lt;/ref&gt; On January 18, 2008 the UK House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee raised similar concerns, and called for a moratorium on biofuel targets.&lt;ref&gt;''Committee calls for Moratorium on Biofuels'' {{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/environmental_audit_committee/eac_210108.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413142357/http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/environmental_audit_committee/eac_210108.cfm |archivedate=2008-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany ended their subsidy of biodiesel on Jan 1 2008 and started taxing it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energypublisher.com/article.asp?id=13410 Subsidy loss threatens German bio-fuel industry | EnerPub - Energy Publisher&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417191356/http://www.energypublisher.com/article.asp?id=13410 |date=April 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reduce farmland reserves and set asides===

To avoid overproduction and to prop up farmgate prices for agricultural commodities, the EU has for a long time have had farm subsidy programs to encourage farmers not to produce and leave productive acres [[fallow]]. The 2008 crisis prompted proposals to bring some of the reserve farmland back into use, and the used area increased actually with 0.5% but today these areas are once again out of use. According to Eurostat, 18 million hectares has been abandoned since 1990, 7,4 millions hectares are currently set aside,&lt;ref&gt;[http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=agr_r_landuse&amp;lang=en Landuse in EU]&lt;/ref&gt; and the EU has recently decided to set aside another 5–7% in so called Ecological Focus Areas, corresponding to 10–12 million hectares. In spite of this reduction of used land, the EU is a net exporter of e.g. wheat.

The American Bakers Association has proposed reducing the amount of farmland held in the US [[Conservation Reserve Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/03-12-2008/0004772559&amp;EDATE=|title=ABA Band of Bakers March on Washington, D.C.

In Europe about 8% of the farmland is in [[set aside]] programs.  Farmers have proposed freeing up all of this for farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icis.com/blogs/biofuels/archives/2007/07/let-us-farm-set-aside-land-eur.html|title=home - The Big Biofuels Blog|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farmpolicy.com/?p=384|title=FarmPolicy|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two-thirds of the farmers who were on these programs in the UK are not renewing when their term expires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/may/25/ruralaffairs.food | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Eco-farming ditched as food prices soar | first=Caroline | last=Davies | date=2008-05-25 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable production of biofuels===
{{Main article|Sustainable biofuel}}

Second generation biofuels are now being produced from the cellulose in dedicated energy crops (such as perennial grasses), forestry materials, the co-products from food production, and domestic vegetable waste. Advances in the conversion processes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11364|title=Hydrogen injection could boost biofuel production|work=New Scientist|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; will almost certainly improve the sustainability of biofuels, through  better efficiencies and reduced environmental impact of producing biofuels, from both existing food crops and from cellulosic sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://royalsociety.org/displaypagedoc.asp?id=28914 Sustainable biofuels: prospects and challenges] p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord [[Ron Oxburgh]] suggests that responsible production of biofuels has several advantages:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Produced responsibly they are a sustainable energy source that need not divert any land from growing food nor damage the environment; they can also help solve the problems of the waste generated by Western society; and they can create jobs for the poor where previously were none.  Produced irresponsibly, they at best offer no climate benefit and, at worst, have detrimental social and environmental consequences.  In other words, biofuels are pretty much like any other product.&lt;ref&gt;Oxburgh, Ron. Fuelling hope for the future, ''Courier Mail'', 15 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Far from creating food shortages, responsible production and distribution of biofuels represents the best opportunity for sustainable economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and impoverished Asia. Biofuels offer the prospect of real market competition and oil price moderation. Crude oil would be trading 15 per cent higher and gasoline would be as much as 25 per cent more expensive, if it were not for biofuels. A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes.&lt;ref name=sol/&gt;

===Continuation of the status quo===

An additional policy option is to continue the current trends of government incentive for these types of crops to further evaluate the effects on food prices over a longer period of time due to the relatively recent onset of the biofuel production industry.  Additionally, by virtue of the newness of the industry we can assume that like other startup industries techniques and alternatives will be cultivated quickly if there is sufficient demand for the alternative fuels and biofuels.  What could result from the shock to food prices is a very quick move toward some of the non-food biofuels as are listed above amongst the other policy alternatives.&lt;ref name="ars.usda.gov"/&gt;

==Impact on developing countries==

Demand for fuel in rich countries is now competing against demand for food in poor countries. The increase in world grain consumption in 2006 happened due to the increase in consumption for fuel, not human consumption. The grain required to fill a {{convert|25|USgal|L}} fuel tank with ethanol will feed one person for a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobalist.com/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=5518 Starving for Fuel: How Ethanol Production Contributes to Global Hunger by Lester Brown - The Globalist &gt; &gt; Global Briefing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329144818/http://www.theglobalist.com/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=5518 |date=March 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several factors combine to make recent grain and oilseed price increases impact poor countries more:

*  Poor people buy more grains (e.g. wheat), and are more exposed to grain price changes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080423065501/http://www.rustylime.com/show_article.php?id=1497 Family food expenditures around the world&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1645016_1408103,00.html | work=Time | date=2007-07-19 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Poor people spend a higher portion of their income on food, so increasing food prices influence them more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Aid organizations which buy food and send it to poor countries see more need when prices go up but are able to buy less food on the same budget.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hNaOD0IxN-Pl68nnhQI2fQIgJ-PgD8V82HQ81 The Associated Press: UN Warns About High Fuel, Food Costs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310231746/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hNaOD0IxN-Pl68nnhQI2fQIgJ-PgD8V82HQ81 |date=March 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact is not all negative. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) recognizes the potential opportunities that the growing biofuel market offers to [[small farmer]]s and aquaculturers around the world and has recommended [[small-scale financing]] to help farmers in poor countries produce local biofuel.&lt;ref name="biodiesel.org"/&gt;

On the other hand, poor countries that do substantial farming have increased profits due to biofuels.  If vegetable oil prices double, the profit margin could more than double. In the past rich countries have been [[dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]] subsidized grains at below cost prices into poor countries and hurting the local farming industries.  With biofuels using grains the rich countries no longer have grain surpluses to get rid of.  Farming in poor countries is seeing healthier profit margins and expanding.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt;

Claims made by the NCGA include:

* Corn growers have been and will continue to produce enough corn so that [[supply and demand]] meet and there is no [[shortage]].  Farmers make their planting decisions based on signals from the marketplace.   If demand for corn is high and projected revenue-per-acre is strong relative to other crops, farmers will plant more corn.  In 2007 US farmers planted {{convert|92900000|acre|km2}} with corn, 19% more acres  than they did in 2006.
* The U.S. has doubled corn yields over the last 40 years and expects to double them again in the next 20 years. With twice as much corn from each acre, corn can be put to new uses without taking food from the hungry or causing deforestation.
* US consumers buy things like [[corn flakes]] where the cost of the corn per box is around 5 cents. Most of the cost is packaging, advertising, shipping, etc.  Only about 19% of the US retail food prices can be attributed to the actual cost of food inputs like grains and oilseeds.  So if the price of a bushel of corn goes up, there may be no noticeable impact on US retail food prices.{{dubious|date=October 2013}}  The US retail food price index has gone up only a few percent per year and is expected to continue to have very small increases.
* Most of the corn produced in the US is [[field corn]], not [[sweet corn]], and not digestible by humans in its raw form.  Most corn is used for livestock feed and not human food, even the portion that is exported.
* Only the starch portion of corn kernels is converted to ethanol.  The rest (protein, fat, vitamins and minerals) is passed through to the feed coproducts or human food ingredients.
* One of the most significant and immediate benefits of higher grain prices is a dramatic reduction in federal farm support payments. According to the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]], corn farmers received $8.8 billion in government support in 2006. Because of higher corn prices, payments are expected to drop to $2.1 billion in 2007, a 76 percent reduction.
* While the [[EROEI]] and economics of corn based ethanol are a bit weak, it paves the way for [[cellulosic ethanol]] which should have much better EROEI and economics.
* While basic nourishment is clearly important, fundamental societal needs of [[energy]], mobility, and [[energy security]] are too. If farmers crops can help their country in these areas also, it seems right to do so.

Since reaching record high prices in June 2008, corn prices fell 50% by October 2008, declining sharply together with other [[commodities]], including oil. According to a Reuters article, "Analysts, including some in the ethanol sector, say ethanol demand adds about 75 cents to $1.00 per bushel to the price of corn, as a rule of thumb. Other analysts say it adds around 20 percent, or just under 80 cents per bushel at current prices. Those estimates hint that $4 per bushel corn might be priced at only $3 without demand for ethanol fuel.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKN2338007820081023|title=Ethanol no longer seen as big driver of food price|author=Sam Nelson|publisher=Reuters UK|date=2008-10-23|accessdate=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These industry sources consider that a [[speculative bubble]] in the [[commodity markets]] holding positions in corn [[Futures contract|futures]] was the main driver behind the observed hike in corn prices affecting food supply.

== Controversy within the international system ==

The United States and Brazil lead the industrial world in global ethanol production, with Brazil as the world's largest exporter and [[biofuel]] industry leader.&lt;ref name="WasPos1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/22/AR2007022201361.html |title=Latin America -- the 'Persian Gulf' of Biofuels? |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2007-02-23 |accessdate=2008-04-28|language= | first=Marcela | last=Sanchez}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the U.S. produced 18.4 billion liters (4.86 billion [[gallon]]s), closely followed by Brazil with 16.3 billion liters (4.3 billion gallons),&lt;ref name="Apollo"/&gt; producing together 70% of the world's ethanol market and nearly 90% of ethanol used as fuel.&lt;ref name="WorldBank"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDR2008/Resources/2795087-1192112387976/WDR08_05_Focus_B.pdf |format=PDF|title=Biofuels: The Promise and the Risks, in World Development Report 2008 |publisher=The World Bank|year=2008|pages= 70–71|accessdate=2008-05-04|language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries are followed by China with 7.5%, and India with 3.7% of the global market share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethanolrfa.org/industry/statistics/#E |title=Industry Statistics: Annual World Ethanol Production by Country |publisher=Renewable Fuels Association |date= |accessdate=2008-04-28 |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408091334/http://www.ethanolrfa.org/industry/statistics/#E |archivedate=2008-04-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, the concerns, criticisms and controversy surrounding the food vs biofuels issue has reached the [[international relations|international system]], mainly [[Head of state|heads of states]], and [[international organization|inter-governmental organizations]] (IGOs), such as the United Nations and several of its agencies, particularly the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) and the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP); the [[International Monetary Fund]]; the [[World Bank]]; and agencies within the European Union.

=== The 2007 controversy: Ethanol diplomacy in the Americas ===
[[Image:Bushlulapetrobras09032007.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Presidents [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] and [[George W. Bush]] during Bush's visit to [[Brazil]], March 2007]]
In March 2007, "ethanol diplomacy" was the focus of President [[George W. Bush]]'s Latin American tour, in which he and Brazil's president, [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], were seeking to promote the production and use of sugar cane based ethanol throughout Latin America and the [[Caribbean]]. The two countries also agreed to share technology and set international standards for biofuels.&lt;ref name="WasPos1"/&gt; The Brazilian sugar cane technology transfer will permit various [[Central American]] countries, such as [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Panama]], several [[Caribbean]] countries, and various [[Andean Community of Nations|Andean Countries]] tariff-free trade with the U.S. thanks to existing concessionary trade agreements. Even though the U.S. imposes a USD 0.54 tariff on every gallon of imported ethanol, the Caribbean nations and countries in the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]] are exempt from such duties if they produce ethanol from crops grown in their own countries. The expectation is that using Brazilian technology for refining sugar cane based ethanol, such countries could become exporters to the United States in the short-term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/03/business/worldbusiness/03ethanol.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Bush+Brazil+ethanol&amp;st=nyt |title=U.S. and Brazil Seek to Promote Ethanol in West  |publisher=The New York Times|author1=Edmund L.

This alliance between the U.S. and Brazil generated some negative reactions. While Bush was in [[São Paulo]] as part of the 2007 Latin American tour, [[Venezuela]]'s President [[Hugo Chavez]], from [[Buenos Aires]], dismissed the ethanol plan as "a crazy thing" and accused the U.S. of trying "to substitute the production of foodstuffs for animals and human beings with the production of foodstuffs for vehicles, to sustain the American way of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/10/world/americas/10prexy.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Bush+Brazil+ethanol+Chavez&amp;st=nyt |title=Bush and Chávez Spar at Distance Over Latin Visit |publisher= The Washington Post |author1=Jim Rutenberg |author2=Larry Rohter |date=2007-03-10 |accessdate=2008-04-28|language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chavez' complaints were quickly followed by then [[Cuba]]n President [[Fidel Castro]], who wrote that "you will see how many people among the hungry masses of our planet will no longer consume corn." "Or even worse," he continued, "by offering financing to poor countries to produce ethanol from corn or any other kind of food, no tree will be left to defend humanity from climate change."'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E1DE1130F933A05750C0A9619C8B63 |title=Americas: Cuba: Castro Criticizes U.S. Biofuel Policies |publisher=The New York Times|date=2007-03-30 |accessdate=2008-04-28|language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Ortega]], Nicaragua's President, and one of the preferential recipients of Brazil technical aid, said that "we reject the gibberish of those who applaud Bush's totally absurd proposal, which attacks the food security rights of Latin Americans and Africans, who are major corn consumers", however, he voiced support for sugar cane based ethanol during [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula]]'s visit to Nicaragua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90777/6235427.html |title=Nicaragua president backs sugar-made biofuel as Lula visits |publisher=People's Daily Online |author=Xinhua News |date=2007-08-09 |accessdate=2008-04-28|language= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2007/agosto/09/economia1197405.html |title=Lula ofrece cooperación y energía eléctrica  |publisher=La Nación |author=AFP |date=2007-08-09 |accessdate=2008-04-28|language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 2008 controversy: Global food prices ===

As a result of the [[international community]]'s concerns regarding the [[2007–2008 world food price crisis|steep increase in food prices]], on April 14, 2008, [[Jean Ziegler]], the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on the Right to Food, at the Thirtieth Regional Conference of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) in [[Brasília]], called biofuels a "crime against humanity",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/dinheiro/ult91u391866.shtml|title=ONU diz que biocombustíveis são crime contra a humanidade|publisher=Folha de Sao Pãulo Online|date=2008-04-14|accessdate=2008-04-28|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC_Brasilia"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7351766.stm|title=Brazil president defends biofuels|author=Emilio San Pedro

And it's getting more and more difficult every day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/apr/11/worldbank.fooddrinks1 |title=Poor go hungry while rich fill their tanks |author1=Larry Elliott |author2=Heather Stewart |publisher= The Guardian |date= 2008-04-11|accessdate=2008-04-30|language= | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/04/29/ST2008042903585.html |title=Siphoning Off Corn to Fuel Our Cars |date=2008-04-30|publisher= The Washington Post|author= Steven Mufson |accessdate=2008-04-30|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/bbc/ult272u391745.shtml|title=FMI e Bird pedem ação urgente contra alta alimentar|publisher=Folha de Sao Pãulo Online|date=2008-04-13|accessdate=2008-04-28|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] gave a strong rebuttal, calling both claims "fallacies resulting from commercial interests", and putting the blame instead on U.S. and European [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]], and a problem restricted to U.S. ethanol produced from maize.&lt;ref name="Veja_30_04" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7351766.stm|title=Brazil Lula defends biofuels from growing criticism|author=Raymond Colitt|publisher=Reuters UK|date=2008-04-16|accessdate=2008-04-28|language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that "biofuels aren't the villain that threatens food security".&lt;ref name="BBC_Brasilia"/&gt; In the middle of this new wave of criticism, [[Hugo Chavez]] reaffirmed his opposition and said that he is concerned that "so much U.S.-produced corn could be used to make biofuel, instead of feeding the world's poor", calling the U.S. initiative to boost ethanol production during a world food crisis a "crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/26/AR2008042602475.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104182809/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/26/AR2008042602475.html |archive-date=2012-11-04 |title=Chavez calls ethanol production 'crime' |publisher=The Washington Post |agency=Associated Press |date=2008-04-22 |accessdate=2008-04-28|language= |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|German Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] said the rise in food prices is due to poor agricultural policies and changing eating habits in developing nations, not biofuels as some critics claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/environmentNews/idUSL1721113520080417?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=environmentNews |title= Bad policy, not biofuel, drive food prices: Merkel|author=Gernot Heller |publisher= Reuters|date=2008-04-17|accessdate=2008-05-01|language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] called for international action and said Britain had to be "selective" in supporting biofuels, and depending on the UK's assessment of biofuels' impact on world food prices, "we will also push for change in EU biofuels targets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7359991.stm |title=Brown's biofuels caution welcomed |publisher= BBC News|date=2008-04-22|accessdate=2008-05-01|language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stavros Dimas]], [[European Commission]]er for the [[natural environment|Environment]] said through a spokeswoman that "there is no question for now of suspending the target fixed for biofuels", though he acknowledged that the EU had underestimated problems caused by biofuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3266694,00.html |title=Europe Defends Biofuels as Debate Rages  |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=2008-04-14|accessdate=2008-05-01|language= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 29, 2008, U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] declared during a [[press conference]] that "85 percent of the world's food prices are caused by weather, increased demand and energy prices", and recognized that "15 percent has been caused by ethanol". He added that "the high price of gasoline is going to spur more investment in ethanol as an alternative to gasoline. And the truth of the matter is it's in our national interests that our farmers grow energy, as opposed to us purchasing energy from parts of the world that are unstable or may not like us." Regarding the effect of agricultural subsidies on rising food prices, Bush said that "Congress is considering a massive, bloated farm bill that would do little to solve the problem. The bill Congress is now considering would fail to eliminate subsidy payments to multi-millionaire farmers", he continued, "this is the right time to reform our nation's farm policies by reducing unnecessary subsidies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/04/20080429-1.html |title=Press Conference by the President |publisher= The White House|date=2008-04-29|accessdate=2008-05-01|language= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just a week before this new wave of international controversy began, [[U.N. Secretary General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] had commented that several U.N. agencies were conducting a comprehensive review of the policy on biofuels, as the world food price crisis might trigger global instability. He said "We need to be concerned about the possibility of taking land or replacing arable land because of these biofuels", then he added "While I am very much conscious and aware of these problems, at the same time you need to constantly look at having creative sources of energy, including biofuels. Therefore, at this time, just criticising biofuel may not be a good solution. I would urge we need to address these issues in a comprehensive manner." Regarding [[Jean Ziegler]]'s proposal for a five-year ban, the U.N. Secretary rejected that proposal.&lt;ref name="UNreject"/&gt;

A report released by [[Oxfam]] in June 2008&lt;ref name="Oxfampdf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org/files/bp114-inconvenient-truth-biofuels-0806.pdf |format=PDF |title=Another Inconvenient Truth: Biofuels are not the answer to climate or fuel crisis |publisher=[[Oxfam]] |author=Oxfam |language= |date=2008-06-25 |accessdate=2008-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819214631/http://www.oxfam.org/files/bp114-inconvenient-truth-biofuels-0806.pdf |archivedate=2008-08-19 |df= }} Report available in pdf&lt;/ref&gt; criticized biofuel policies of high-income countries as neither a solution to the climate crisis nor the oil crisis, while contributing to the food price crisis. The report concluded that from all biofuels available in the market, Brazilian sugarcane ethanol is not very effective, but it is the most favorable biofuel in the world in term of cost and [[greenhouse gas]] balance. The report discusses some existing problems and potential risks, and asks the Brazilian government for caution to avoid jeopardizing its environmental and social sustainability. The report also says that: "Rich countries spent up to $15 billion last year supporting biofuels while blocking cheaper Brazilian ethanol, which is far less damaging for global food security."&lt;ref name="Oxfam08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org/pressroom/pressrelease/2008-06-25/another-inconvenient-truth-biofuels-are-not-answer |title=Another Inconvenient Truth: Biofuels are not the answer to climate or fuel crisis |publisher=[[Oxfam]] web site |author=Oxfam |language= |date=2008-06-26 |accessdate=2008-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031143804/http://www.oxfam.org/pressroom/pressrelease/2008-06-25/another-inconvenient-truth-biofuels-are-not-answer |archivedate=2008-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/portuguese/reporterbbc/story/2008/06/080625_biocombustiveisrelatorio.shtml|title=ONG diz que etanol brasileiro é melhor opção entre biocombustíveis |publisher=BBCBrasil|language=Portuguese |date=2008-06-25|accessdate=2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[World Bank]] research report published in July 2008&lt;ref name="WorldBank_07_08"/&gt; found that from June 2002 to June 2008 "biofuels and the related consequences of low grain stocks, large land use shifts, speculative activity and export bans" pushed prices up by 70 percent to 75 percent. The study found that higher oil prices and a weak dollar explain 25–30% of total price rise. The study said that "...large increases in biofuels production in the United States and Europe are the main reason behind the steep rise in global food prices" and also stated that "Brazil's sugar-based ethanol did not push food prices appreciably higher".&lt;ref name="Veja_28_07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt; The  [[Renewable Fuels Association]] (RFA) published a rebuttal based on the version leaked before its formal release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/03/biofuels.renewableenergy|title=Secret report: biofuel caused food crisis|author=Aditya Chakrabortty |publisher=The Guardian|language=|date=2008-07-04|accessdate=2008-07-29 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RFA critique considers that the analysis is highly subjective and that the author "estimates the impact of global food prices from the weak dollar and the direct and indirect effect of high petroleum prices and attributes everything else to biofuels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethanolrfa.org/objects/documents/1812/lecg_work_bank_critique.pdf |format=PDF |title=Critique of World Bank Working Paper "A Note of Rising Food Prices" |author=John M.

An economic assessment by the [[OECD]] also published in July 2008&lt;ref name="OECD_07_08"/&gt; agrees with the World Bank report regarding the negative effects of subsidies and trade restrictions, but found that the impact of biofuels on food prices are much smaller. The OECD study is also critical of the limited reduction of [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions achieved from biofuels produced in Europe and North America, concluding that the current biofuel support policies would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transport fuel by no more than 0.8 percent by 2015, while Brazilian ethanol from sugar cane reduces greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80 percent compared to fossil fuels. The assessment calls on governments for more open markets in biofuels and feedstocks in order to improve efficiency and lower costs. The OECD study concluded that "...current biofuel support measures alone are estimated to increase average wheat prices by about 5 percent, maize by around 7 percent and vegetable oil by about 19 percent over the next 10 years."&lt;ref name="OECDweb08"/&gt;

Another World Bank research report published in July 2010 found their previous study may have overestimated the contribution of biofuel production, as the paper concluded that "the effect of biofuels on food prices has not been as large as originally thought, but that the use of commodities by financial investors (the so-called "financialization of commodities") may have been partly responsible for the 2007/08 spike".&lt;ref name=WorldBank_07_10&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2010/07/21/000158349_20100721110120/Rendered/PDF/WPS5371.pdf|title=Placing the 2006/08 Commodity Price Boom into Perspective|publisher=[[World Bank]]|author1=John Baffes |author2=Tassos Haniotis |date=July 2010|accessdate=2010-08-09}} Policy Research Working Paper 5371&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''funnel plot''' is a graph designed to check for the existence of [[publication bias]]; funnel plots are commonly used in [[systematic review]]s and [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]]. In the absence of publication bias, it assumes that studies with high precision will be plotted near the average, and studies with low precision will be spread evenly on both sides of the average, creating a roughly [[funnel]]-shaped distribution. Deviation from this shape can indicate publication bias.

are useful adjuncts to meta-analyses. A funnel plot is a [[scatterplot]] of treatment effect against a measure of study precision. It is used primarily as a visual aid for detecting bias or [[Study heterogeneity|systematic heterogeneity]]. A [[Symmetry|symmetric]] inverted funnel shape arises from a ‘well-behaved’ data set, in which publication bias is unlikely. An asymmetric funnel indicates a relationship between treatment effect estimate and study precision. This suggests the possibility of either [[publication bias]] or a systematic difference between studies of higher and lower precision (typically ‘small study effects’). Asymmetry can also arise from use of an inappropriate effect measure. Whatever the cause, an asymmetric funnel plot leads to doubts over the appropriateness of a simple meta-analysis and suggests that there needs to be investigation of possible causes.

A variety of choices of measures of ‘study precision’ is available, including total sample size, [[Standard error (statistics)|standard error]] of the treatment effect, and inverse [[variance]] of the treatment effect ([[Weight function|weight]]). Sterne and Egger have compared these with others, and conclude that the standard error is to be recommended.&lt;ref name="SterneJ2001Funnel"/&gt;
When the standard error is used, straight lines may be drawn to define a region within which 95% of points might lie in the absence of both [[Heterogeneous|heterogeneity]] and publication bias.&lt;ref name="SterneJ2001Funnel"/&gt;

In common with [[confidence interval]] plots, funnel plots are conventionally drawn with the treatment effect measure on the [[Cartesian coordinate system|horizontal axis]], so that study precision appears on the vertical axis, breaking with the general rule. Since funnel plots are principally visual aids for detecting asymmetry along the treatment effect axis, this makes them considerably easier to interpret.

The funnel plot is not without problems. 
If high precision studies are different from low precision studies with respect to [[effect size]] (e.g., due to different populations examined) a funnel plot may give a wrong impression of publication bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="742">In mathematics, a '''Γ-object''' of a [[pointed category]] ''C'' is a [[contravariant functor]] from Γ to ''C''.

The basic example is [[Segal#Segal|Segal]]'s{{Disambiguation needed|date=October 2017}} so-called '''Γ-space''', which may be thought of as a generalization of [[simplicial abelian group]] (or simplicial abelian monoid). More precisely, one can define a Gamma space as an O-monoid object in an infinity-category.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lurie|2012|loc=Remark 2.4.2.2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion plays a role in the generalization of [[algebraic K-theory]] that replaces an [[abelian group]] by something [[higher object|higher]].

The '''Geschwind–Galaburda hypothesis''' was proposed by [[Norman Geschwind]] and Albert Galaburda to explain [[Biology of gender|sex differences]] in [[cognition|cognitive]] abilities by relating them to [[lateralization of brain function]].  The basic idea is that differences in maturation rates between the [[cerebral hemispheres]] are mediated by circulating [[Androgen|testosterone]] levels, and that sexual maturation acts to fix the hemispheres at different relative stages of development after [[puberty]].

According to the theory, male brains mature later than females, and the left hemisphere matures later than the right.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4659">The '''H-Prize program''' is a series of [[inducement prize contest|inducement prizes]] intended to encourage research into the use of [[hydrogen]] as an [[energy carrier]] in a [[hydrogen economy]]. The program is sponsored by the [[United States Department of Energy]] and administered by the Hydrogen Education Foundation. In 2014, an H-Prize competition was launched to develop a small-scale hydrogen generation and refueling station for hydrogen [[fuel cell electric vehicle]]s. The prize, named the H2 Refuel H-Prize and worth $1 million, was awarded in January 2017, to the consortium "SimpleFuel". 

==Creation==
Legislation for the prize, introduced by Rep. [[Bob Inglis]], passed the [[United States House of Representatives]] in May 2006 as {{USBill|109|H.R.|5143}},&lt;ref&gt;[[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060602094041/http://www.house.gov/science/press/109/109-257.htm "House Overwhelmingly Passes Inglis H-Prize Bill"]&lt;/ref&gt; but did not receive a vote in the [[United States Senate]]. After being reintroduced by Rep. [[Dan Lipinski]] at the beginning of a new term in January 2007, it was eventually folded into the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]], which passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate and was then signed into law in December 2007.

The bill [[authorization bill|authorized]] $50 million in prize money, for the period from fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2017. However, in order to be spent, these funds must also be included in Congress's annual [[appropriation bill]]s. The law provides for three categories of prizes:

*Four prizes of up to $1 million, awarded every two years for advances in hydrogen production, storage, distribution and utilization;
*One prize of up to $4 million, awarded two years to working prototypes of hydrogen vehicles which meet ambitious performance goals; and
*A $10 million grand prize, awarded only once during the program for a major technological breakthrough.

In October 2008, the [[Hydrogen Education Foundation]] of Washington, D.C. was selected to administer the H-Prize along with [[South Carolina Research Authority|SCRA]], a South Carolina research foundation.

== Prizes ==
In August 2009, the [[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy]] (EERE) of the U.S. Department of Energy announced a $1 million prize for innovative [[hydrogen storage]] materials which would be awarded in February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2009/08/26/E9-20552/initial-h-prize-competition-for-breakthrough-advances-in-materials-for-hydrogen-storage|title=Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 164 / Wednesday, August 26, 2009 / Notices|date=August 26, 2009|accessdate=21 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the prize was never awarded as no competitor met the competition requirements.

In March 2014, EERE announced plans for a $1 million H2 Refuel H-Prize, and the Prize competition was launched in October 2014. The competition focused on developing small hydrogen refueling stations that can generate hydrogen from electricity or natural gas and dispense it to vehicles at least 1 kg at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://energy.gov/eere/articles/interested-hydrogen-and-fuel-cell-technologies-help-shape-h2-refuel-h-prize | title=Interested in Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies?

'''Hangprinter''' is an [[Open-source model|open-source]] [[fused deposition modeling]] delta [[3D printer]] notable for its unique frameless design, it was created by Torbjörn Ludvigsen. The Hangprinter uses relatively low cost parts and can be constructed for around $250 USD.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The printer is part of the [[RepRap project]] where many of the parts of the printer are able to be produced on the printer itself (partially self replicating). The files for the printer are available on [[GitHub|Github]] for download, modification and redistribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/tobbelobb/hangprinter|title=tobbelobb/hangprinter|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12410">The '''Harvard–Yenching Classification System''' is a  library classification system for Chinese language materials in the United States of America. It was devised by [[Alfred Kaiming Chiu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{zh|t=裘開明 | s=裘开明 |p=Qiú Kāimíng|w=Ch'iu&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; K'ai&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-Ming&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (1898–1977). The system was primarily created for the classification of Chinese language materials in the [[Harvard–Yenching Library]] which was founded in 1927 at the [[Harvard–Yenching Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Eugene W. Wu, "The Founding of the Harvard–Yenching Library," ''Journal of East Asian Libraries'' 101.1  (1993):  65-69.     [http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/jeal/vol1993/iss101/16/]&lt;/ref&gt;

During that early period other systems, such as the early edition of the [[Library of Congress Classification]], did not consist of appropriate subject headings to classify the Chinese language materials, particularly the ancient published materials.  As many American libraries started to collect the ancient and contemporary published materials from China, a number of American libraries subsequently followed Harvard University to adopt Harvard–Yenching classification system, such as the East Asian Library of the University of California in Berkeley, Columbia University, The University of Chicago, Washington University in St. Louis etc.

In addition to American libraries, the libraries of other universities in the world including England, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore etc. also followed Harvard University to adopt the system.  During the period from the 1930s to the 1970s, the use of the system became popular for classifying not only Chinese language materials but also other East Asian materials including Korean and Japanese language materials.

During the period from the 1970s to the 1980s, a comprehensive subset of subject headings for Chinese language materials was gradually established in the Library of Congress Classification System so that almost a full spectrum of ancient and contemporary Chinese topics can be widely covered. As a result of this, the Library of Congress Classification System eventually replaced the Harvard–Yenching Classification System for all Chinese language materials acquired after the 1970s in many American Libraries.

Though the system has largely been phased out, the system is still being used in some libraries for Chinese language materials acquired prior to the Library of Congress update. Such previously acquired books are normally stored in separate stacks in libraries. However, some of the university libraries in the Commonwealth countries of the United Kingdom such as England, Australia and New Zealand still continue to use the Harvard–Yenching system; for example, the Institute for Chinese Studies Library of the University of Oxford, University of Sydney, and University of Auckland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="330908">The '''history of [[Lorentz transformation]]s''' comprises the development of [[linear map|linear transformations]] forming the [[Lorentz group]] or [[Poincaré group]] preserving the [[Lorentz interval]] &lt;math&gt;-x_{0}^{2}+\cdots+x_{n}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Minkowski inner product]] &lt;math&gt;-x_{0}y_{0}+\cdots+x_{n}y_{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[mathematics]], transformations equivalent to what was later known as Lorentz transformations in various dimensions were discussed in the 19th century in relation to the theory of [[quadratic form]]s, [[hyperbolic geometry]], [[Möbius geometry]], and [[Spherical wave transformation|sphere geometry]], which is connected to the fact that the group of [[hyperbolic motion|motions in hyperbolic space]], the [[Möbius group]] or [[projective special linear group]], and the [[Spherical wave transformation#Transformation by reciprocal directions|Laguerre group]] are [[Group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[Lorentz group]].

In [[physics]], Lorentz transformations became known at the beginning of the 20th century, when it was discovered that they exhibit the symmetry of [[Maxwell's equations]]. Subsequently, they became fundamental to all of physics, because they formed the basis of [[special relativity]] in which they exhibit the symmetry of [[Minkowski spacetime]], making the [[velocity of light]] invariant between different inertial frames. They relate the spacetime coordinates, which specify the position ''x,y,z'' and time ''t'' of an event, relative to a particular [[inertial frame of reference]] (the "rest system"), and the coordinates ''x′,y′,z′'' and ''t′'' of the same event relative to another coordinate system moving in the positive ''x''-direction at a constant speed ''v'', relative to the rest system.

==Overview==

=== Most general Lorentz transformations===

The general [[quadratic form]] ''q(x)'' with coefficients of a [[symmetric matrix]] '''A''', the associated [[bilinear form]] ''b(x,y)'', and the [[linear transformation]]s of ''q(x)'' and ''b(x,y)'' into ''q(x′)'' and ''b(x′,y′)'' using the [[transformation matrix]] '''g''', can be written as&lt;ref&gt;Bôcher (1907), chapter X&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\begin{align}\begin{align}q=\sum_{0}^{n}A_{ij}x_{i}x_{j}=\mathbf{x}^{\mathrm{T}}\cdot\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{x}\end{align} &amp; =q'=\mathbf{x}^{\mathrm{\prime T}}\cdot\mathbf{A}'\cdot\mathbf{x}'\\ b=\sum_{0}^{n}A_{ij}x_{i}y_{j}=\mathbf{x}^{\mathrm{T}}\cdot\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{y} &amp; =b'=\mathbf{x}^{\mathrm{\prime T}}\cdot\mathbf{A}'\cdot\mathbf{y}' \end{align} \quad\left(A_{ij}=A_{ji}\right)\\ \hline \left.\begin{align}x_{i} &amp; =\sum_{j=0}^{n}g_{ij}x_{j}^{\prime}=\mathbf{g}\cdot\mathbf{x}'\\ x_{i}^{\prime} &amp; =\sum_{j=0}^{n}g_{ij}^{(-1)}x_{j}=\mathbf{g}^{-1}\cdot\mathbf{x} \end{align} \right|\mathbf{g}^{{\rm T}}\cdot\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{g}=\mathbf{A}' \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;|{{equationRef|Q1}}}}

The case ''n=1'' is the [[binary quadratic form]] introduced by [[#Gauss|Lagrange (1773) and Gauss (1798/1801)]], ''n=2'' is the ternary quadratic form introduced by [[#Gauss2|Gauss (1798/1801)]], ''n=3'' is the quaternary quadratic form etc.

The general Lorentz transformation follows from ({{equationNote|Q1}}) by setting '''A'''='''A′'''=diag(-1,1,...,1) and det '''g'''=1. It forms an [[indefinite orthogonal group]] called the [[Lorentz group]] {{nowrap|SO(n, 1)}}, the quadratic form ''q(x)'' becomes the [[Lorentz interval]] in terms of an [[indefinite quadratic form]] in terms of [[pseudo-Euclidean space]], and the associated bilinear form ''b(x)'' becomes the [[Minkowski inner product]]:&lt;ref name=ratcliffe&gt;Ratcliffe (1994), 3.1 and Theorem 3.1.4 and Exercise 3.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Naimark (1964), 2 in four dimensions&lt;/ref&gt;

Such general Lorentz transformations ({{equationNote|1a}}) for various dimensions were used by [[#Gauss4|Gauss (1818)]], [[#Jacobi|Jacobi (1827, 1833)]], [[#Lebesgue|Lebesgue (1837)]], [[#Bour|Bour (1856)]], [[#Somov|Somov (1863)]], [[#Hill|Hill (1882)]] in order to simplify computations of [[elliptic function]]s and integrals.&lt;ref&gt;Musen (1970) pointed out the intimate connection of Hill's scalar development and Minkowski's pseudo-Euclidean 3D space.&lt;/ref&gt; They were also used by [[#Poincare|Poincaré (1881)]], [[#Cox|Cox (1881/82)]], [[#Picard|Picard (1882, 1884)]], [[#Killing|Killing (1885, 1893)]], [[#Gerard|Gérard (1892)]], [[#Hausdorff|Hausdorff (1899)]], [[#Woods|Woods (1901, 1903)]], [[#Liebmann|Liebmann (1904/05)]] to describe [[hyperbolic motion]]s (i.e. rigid motions in the [[hyperbolic plane]] or [[hyperbolic space]]), which were expressed in terms of Weierstrass coordinates of the [[hyperboloid model]] satisfying the relation &lt;math&gt;-x_{0}^{2}+\cdots+x_{n}^{2}=-1&lt;/math&gt; or in terms of the [[Cayley–Klein metric]] of [[projective geometry]] using the "absolute" form &lt;math&gt;-x_{0}^{2}+\cdots+x_{n}^{2}=0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref group=M&gt;Killing (1885), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller (1910), p. 661, in particular footnote 247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sommerville (1911), p. 286, section K6.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[infinitesimal transformation]]s related to the [[Lie algebra]] of the group of hyperbolic motions were given in terms of Weierstrass coordinates &lt;math&gt;-x_{0}^{2}+\cdots+x_{n}^{2}=-1&lt;/math&gt; by [[#Killing3|Killing (1888-1897)]].

If ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, x′&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ({{equationNote|1a}}) are interpreted as [[homogeneous coordinates]], then the corresponding inhomogenous coordinates ''u&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, u′&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' follow by

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\frac{x_{0}}{x_{0}},\ \frac{x_{s}}{x_{0}}\right]=\left[1,\ u_{s}\right],\ \left[\frac{x_{0}^{\prime}}{x_{0}^{\prime}},\ \frac{x_{s}^{\prime}}{x_{0}^{\prime}}\right]=\left[1,\ u_{s}^{\prime}\right],\ (s=1,2\dots n)&lt;/math&gt;

so that the Lorentz transformation becomes a [[homography]] leaving invariant the equation of the [[unit sphere]], which [[John Lighton Synge]] called “the most general formula for the composition of velocities” in terms of special relativity (the transformation matrix '''g''' stays the same as in ({{equationNote|1a}})):&lt;ref&gt;Synge (1955), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Such Lorentz transformations for various dimensions were directly used by [[#Gauss4|Gauss (1818)]], [[#Jacobi|Jacobi (1827–1833)]], [[#Lebesgue|Lebesgue (1837)]], [[#Bour|Bour (1856)]], [[#Somov|Somov (1863)]], [[#Hill|Hill (1882)]], [[#Callandreau|Callandreau (1885)]] in order to simplify computations of elliptic functions and integrals, by [[#Picard|Picard (1882-1884)]] in relation to [[Hermitian form|Hermitian quadratic form]]s, or by [[#Woods|Woods (1901, 1903)]] in terms of the [[Beltrami–Klein model]] of hyperbolic geometry. In addition, infinitesimal transformations related to the [[Lie algebra]] of the group of hyperbolic motions leaving invariant the unit sphere &lt;math&gt;-1+u_{1}^{\prime2}+\cdots+u_{n}^{\prime2}=0&lt;/math&gt; were given by [[#Lie2|Lie (1885-1893) and Werner (1889)]] and [[#Killing3|Killing (1888-1897)]].

The cases ''n=1,2,3,4'' of this quadratic form with real numbers and its transformation was discussed by [[#Euler|Euler (1771)]] and in ''n'' dimensions by [[#Cauchy|Cauchy (1829)]]. Its interpretation as leaving invariant the equation of the sphere with imaginary radius was given by [[#Lie|Lie (1871)]], its interpretation as a Lorentz transformation with ''n=3'' using one imaginary coordinate was given by [[#Minkowski|Minkowski (1907)]] and [[#Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld (1909)]].

A well known example of an orthogonal transformation is spatial rotation:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mathfrak{x}_{0}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}=\mathfrak{x}_{0}^{\prime2}+x_{1}^{\prime2}+x_{2}^{\prime2}\\

x_{2}^{\prime} &amp; =x_{2}
\end{align}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;|{{equationRef|2b}}}}

This quadratic form and its transformation with real numbers and real angle was discussed by [[#Euler|Euler (1771)]], its interpretation as a Lorentz transformation using one imaginary coordinate and imaginary angle was given by [[#Minkowski|Minkowski (1907)]]  and [[#Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld (1909)]].

===Lorentz transformation via hyperbolic functions===

The case of a Lorentz transformation without spatial rotation is called a [[Lorentz boost]]. The simplest case can be given, for instance, by setting ''n=1'' in ({{equationNote|1a}}):

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}-x_0^2+x_1^2=-x_{0}^{\prime2}+x_{1}^{\prime2}\\
\hline \begin{align}x_0 &amp; =x_0^{\prime} g_{00}+x_1^{\prime}g_{01}\\
x_1 &amp; =x_0^{\prime} g_{10}+x_{1}^{\prime}g_{11}\\
\\
x_0^{\prime} &amp; =x_0 g_{00}-x_{1}g_{10}\\
x_1^{\prime} &amp; =-x_0 g_{01}+x_{1}g_{11}
\end{align}
\left|\begin{align}g_{01}^{2}-g_{00}^{2} &amp; =-1\\
g_{11}^2-g_{10}^{2} &amp; =1\\
g_{01}g_{11}-g_{00}g_{10} &amp; =0\\
g_{10}^{2}-g_{00}^{2} &amp; =-1\\
g_{11}^{2}-g_{01}^{2} &amp; =1\\
g_{10}g_{11}-g_{00}g_{01} &amp; =0
\end{align}
\rightarrow\begin{align}g_{00}^2 &amp; =g_{11}^2 \\
g_{01}^2 &amp; =g_{10}^2
\end{align}
\right.
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;|{{equationRef|3a}}}}

which resembles precisely the relations of [[hyperbolic function]]s by setting ''g&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt;=g&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;''=cosh(η) and ''g&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;=g&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;''=sinh(η), with η as the [[hyperbolic angle]]. Thus by adding an unchanged ''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''-axis, a Lorentz boost for ''n=2'' representing a translation in the hyperbolic plane in terms of Weierstrass coordinates of the [[hyperboloid model]] along one axis (being the same as a rotation around an imaginary angle ''iη=φ'' in ({{equationNote|2b}})) is given by

All hyperbolic relations (a,b,c,d,e,f) on the right of ({{equationNote|3b}}) were given by [[#Lambert|Lambert (1768–1770)]]. The Lorentz transformations ({{equationNote|3b}}, see {{section link||Historical formulas for Lorentz boosts}}) were given by [[#Cox|Cox (1882)]], [[#Lindemann|Lindemann (1890/91)]], [[#Gerard|Gérard (1892)]], [[#Killing2|Killing (1893, 1897/98)]], [[#Whitehead|Whitehead (1897/98)]], [[#Woods|Woods (1903/05)]] and [[#Liebmann|Liebmann (1904/05)]]. Lorentz transformations ({{equationNote|3c}}, 1) were given by [[#Lindemann|Lindemann (1890/91)]] and [[#Herglotz1|Herglotz (1909)]], while formulas equivalent to ({{equationNote|3c}}, 2) by [[#Klein|Klein (1871)]].

In line with equation ({{equationNote|1b}}) one can use coordinates &lt;math&gt;[u_{1},\ u_{2},\ 1]=\left[\tfrac{x_{1}}{x_{0}},\ \tfrac{x_{2}}{x_{0}},\ \tfrac{x_{0}}{x_{0}}\right]&lt;/math&gt;, which in terms of hyperbolic geometry can be interpreted as changing the above Weierstrass coordinates into [[Beltrami–Klein model|Beltrami coordinates]]&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld (1988), p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; inside the [[unit circle]] &lt;math&gt;u_{1}^{2}+u_{2}^{2}=1&lt;/math&gt;, thus the corresponding Lorentz transformations ({{equationNote|3b}}) obtain the form:

===Lorentz transformation via velocity===
In the [[theory of relativity]], Lorentz transformations exhibit the symmetry of [[Minkowski spacetime]] by using a constant ''c'' as the [[speed of light]], and a parameter ''v'' as the relative [[velocity]] between two [[inertial reference frames]]. In particular, the hyperbolic angle η in ({{equationNote|3b}}) can be interpreted as the velocity related [[rapidity]] η=atanh(β) with β=''v/c'', so that γ=cosh(η) is the [[Lorentz factor]], βγ=sinh(η) the [[proper velocity]], ''v=c''·tanh(η) the relative velocity of two inertial frames, ''u′=c''·tanh(ζ) the velocity of another object, ''u=c''·tanh(η+ζ) the [[velocity-addition formula]], thus ({{equationNote|3b}}) becomes:

Similar transformations were introduced by [[#Voigt|Voigt (1887)]] and by [[#Lorentz1|Lorentz (1892, 1895)]] who analyzed [[Maxwell's equations]], they were completed by [[#Larmor|Larmor (1897, 1900)]] and [[#Lorentz2|Lorentz (1899, 1904)]], and brought into their modern form by [[#Poincare3|Poincaré (1905)]] who gave the transformation the name of Lorentz.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1981), chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, [[#Einstein|Einstein (1905)]] showed in his development of [[special relativity]] that the transformations follow from the [[principle of relativity]] and constant light speed alone by modifying the traditional concepts of space and time, without requiring a [[Lorentz ether theory|mechanical aether]] in contradistinction to Lorentz and Poincaré.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1981), chapter 4–7&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Minkowski|Minkowski (1907–1908)]] used them to argue that space and time are inseparably connected as [[spacetime]]. [[#Minkowski|Minkowski (1907–1908)]] and [[#Varicak|Varićak (1910)]] showed the relation to imaginary and hyperbolic functions. Important contributions to the mathematical understanding of the Lorentz transformation were also made by other authors such as [[#Herglotz1|Herglotz (1909/10)]], [[#Ignatowski|Ignatowski (1910)]], [[#Noether|Noether (1910) and Klein (1910)]], [[#Borel|Borel (1913–14)]].

===Lorentz transformation via spherical wave transformation===

{{Main|Spherical wave transformation|Lie sphere geometry}}

A general sphere transformation preserving the quadratic form &lt;math&gt;\lambda\left(-x_{0}^{2}+\dots+x_{n}^{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the group Con(p,1) of spacetime [[conformal transformation]]s in terms of inversions or [[special conformal transformation]]s, which has the property of changing spheres into spheres. One can switch between the representations by using an imaginary radius coordinate ''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=iR'' which gives &lt;math&gt;\lambda\left(x_{0}^{2}+\dots+x_{n}^{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt; (conformal transformation), or by using a real radius coordinate ''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=R'' which gives &lt;math&gt;\lambda\left(-x_{0}^{2}+\dots+x_{n}^{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt; (spherical wave transformation). This group was studied by [[#Lie|Lie (1871)]] and others in terms of contact transformations, in which ''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is related to the radius ''R''.

It turns out that Con(3,1) is isomorphic to the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(4,2), and contains the Lorentz group SO(3,1) as a subgroup by setting λ=1. More generally, Con(p,q) is isomorphic to SO(p+1,q+1) and contains SO(p,q) as subgroup.&lt;ref&gt;Schottenloher (2008), section 2.2&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that Con(p,0) is isomorphic to the Lorentz group of arbitrary dimensions SO(p+1,1). Consequently, the conformal group in the plane Con(2,0) – known as the group of [[Möbius transformation]]s – is isomorphic to the Lorentz group SO(3,1).&lt;ref&gt;Kastrup (2008), section 2.4.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schottenloher (2008), section 2.3&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen using tetracyclical coordinates satisfying the form &lt;math&gt;-x_{0}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}=0&lt;/math&gt;, which were discussed by [[#Klein4|Pockels (1891), Klein (1893), Bôcher (1894)]].

A special case of Lie's geometry of oriented spheres is the [[Spherical wave transformation#Transformation by reciprocal directions|Laguerre group]], transforming oriented planes and lines into each other. It's generated by the Laguerre inversion introduced by [[#Laguerre|Laguerre (1882)]] and discussed by [[#Darboux|Darboux (1887)]] leaving invariant ''x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' with ''R'' as radius, thus the Laguerre group is isomorphic to the Lorentz group

[[#Stephanos|Stephanos (1883)]] argued that Lie's geometry of oriented spheres in terms of contact transformations, as well as the special case of the transformations of oriented planes into each other (such as by Laguerre), provides a geometrical interpretation of Hamilton's [[biquaternion]]s.

The relation between Lie's sphere transformations and the Lorentz transformation was noted by [[#Bateman|Bateman &amp; Cunningham (1909–1910)]] and others. Furthermore, the [[group isomorphism]] between the Laguerre group and Lorentz group was pointed out by [[#Bateman|Bateman (1910), Cartan (1912, 1915/55), Poincaré (1912/21)]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Coolidge (1916), p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Cartan &amp; Fano (1915/55), sections 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lorentz transformation via Cayley–Hermite transformation ===

The general transformation ({{equationNote|Q1}}) of any quadratic form into itself can also be given using ''arbitrary'' parameters based on the [[Cayley transform]] ('''I'''-'''T''')&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;·('''I'''+'''T''') as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins (2013), pp. 210–214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1899), p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;

\mathbf{x}=(\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{T}\cdot\mathbf{A})^{-1}\cdot(\mathbf{I}+\mathbf{T}\cdot\mathbf{A})\cdot\mathbf{x}'\\

\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;|{{equationRef|Q2}}}}

where '''A''' is, as above, a symmetric matrix defining the quadratic form (there is no primed '''A' ''' because the coefficients are assumed to be the same on both sides), '''I''' the [[identity matrix]], and '''T''' an arbitrary [[antisymmetric matrix]]. After [[#Cayley|Cayley (1846)]] introduced transformations related to sums of positive squares, [[#Hermite|Hermite (1853/54, 1854)]] derived transformations for arbitrary quadratic forms, whose result was reformulated in terms of matrices ({{equationNote|Q2}}) by [[#Cayley|Cayley (1855a, 1855b)]]. For instance, the choice '''A'''=diag(1,1,1) gives an orthogonal transformation which can be used to describe spatial rotations corresponding to the [[Euler–Rodrigues formula|Euler-Rodrigues parameter]]s ''[a,b,c,d]'' discovered by [[#Euler|Euler (1771) and Rodrigues (1840)]], which can be interpreted as the coefficients of [[quaternion]]s. Setting ''d=1'', the equations have the form:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\left.\begin{matrix}x_{0}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}=x_{0}^{\prime2}+x_{1}^{\prime2}+x_{2}^{\prime2}\\

Also the Lorentz interval and the Lorentz transformation can be produced by the Cayley–Hermite formalism.&lt;ref group=R&gt;Borel (1914), pp. 39–41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=R&gt;Brill (1925)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klein (1928), § 2B&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lorente (2003), section 3.3&lt;/ref&gt; The Lorentz transformation in 2 dimensions follows from ({{equationNote|Q2}}) by setting '''A'''=diag(-1,1):

Equations containing the Lorentz transformations ({{equationNote|5a}}, {{equationNote|5b}}, {{equationNote|5c}}) as special cases were given by [[#Cayley|Cayley (1855)]], while Lorentz transformation ({{equationNote|5b}}) was explicitly given by [[#Bachmann|Bachmann (1869)]]. In relativity, equations similar to ({{equationNote|5b}}, {{equationNote|5c}}) were first employed by [[#Borel|Borel (1913)]] to represent Lorentz transformations.

As described in equation ({{equationNote|3c}}), the Lorentz interval is closely connected to the alternative form &lt;math&gt;X_{2}^{2}-X_{1}X_{3}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=k28 /&gt; which in terms of the Cayley–Hermite parameters is invariant under the transformation:&lt;ref group=M name=c84 /&gt;

This transformation was given by [[#Cayley4|Cayley (1884)]], even though he didn't relate it to the Lorentz interval but rather to &lt;math&gt;x_{0}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;. As shown in the next section in equation ({{equationNote|6c}}), many authors (some before Cayley) expressed the invariance of &lt;math&gt;X_{2}^{2}-X_{1}X_{3}&lt;/math&gt; and its relation to the Lorentz interval by using the alternative Cayley–Klein parameters and Möbius transformations.

===Lorentz transformation via Cayley–Klein parameters, Möbius and spin transformations===

The previously mentioned Euler-Rodrigues parameter ''a,b,c,d'' (i.e. Cayley-Hermite parameter in equation ({{equationNote|Q3}}) with ''d=1'') are closely related to Cayley–Klein parameter α,β,γ,δ introduced by [[#Cayley2|Helmholtz (1866/67), Cayley (1879)]] and [[#Klein|Klein (1884)]] to connect Möbius transformations &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\alpha\zeta+\beta}{\gamma\zeta+\delta}&lt;/math&gt; and rotations:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Klein (1896/97), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\alpha &amp; =1+ib, &amp; \beta &amp; =-a+ic,\\
\gamma &amp; =a+ic, &amp; \delta &amp; =1-ib.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

thus ({{equationNote|Q3}}) becomes:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}x_{0}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}=x_{0}^{\prime2}+x_{1}^{\prime2}+x_{2}^{\prime2}\\
\hline \mathbf{x}'=\frac{1}{\kappa}\left[\begin{matrix}\frac{1}{2}\left(\alpha^{2}-\beta^{2}-\gamma^{2}+\delta^{2}\right) &amp; \beta\delta-\alpha\gamma &amp; \frac{i}{2}\left(-\alpha^{2}+\beta^{2}-\gamma^{2}+\delta^{2}\right)\\

\end{matrix}\right]\cdot\mathbf{x}\\
(\kappa=\alpha\delta-\beta\gamma)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;|{{equationRef|Q4}}}}

Also the Lorentz transformation can be expressed with variants of the Cayley–Klein parameters: One relates these parameters to a spin-matrix '''D''', the [[spin transformation]]s of variables &lt;math&gt;\xi',\eta',\bar{\xi}',\bar{\eta}'&lt;/math&gt; (the overline denotes [[complex conjugate]]), and the [[Möbius transformation]] of &lt;math&gt;\zeta',\bar{\zeta}'&lt;/math&gt;. When defined in terms of isometries of hyperblic space (hyperbolic motions), the [[Hermitian matrix]] '''u''' associated with these Möbius transformations produces an invariant determinant &lt;math&gt;\det\mathbf{u}=x_{0}^{2}-x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}-x_{3}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; identical to the Lorentz interval. Therefore, these transformations were described by [[John Lighton Synge]] as being a "factory for the mass production of Lorentz transformations".&lt;ref name=synge /&gt; It also turns out that the related [[spin group]] Spin(3, 1) or [[special linear group]] SL(2, C) acts as the [[Double cover (topology)|double cover]] of the Lorentz group (one Lorentz transformation corresponds to two spin transformations of different sign), while the [[Möbius group]] Con(2, 0) or [[projective special linear group]] PSL(2, C) is isomorphic to both the Lorentz group and the group of isometries of hyperbolic space.

In four dimensions, these Lorentz transformations can be represented as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Klein (1928), § 3A&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=synge&gt;Synge (1956), ch.

The general transformation '''u′''' and its invariant &lt;math&gt;X_{2}^{2}-X_{1}X_{3}&lt;/math&gt; in ({{equationNote|6c}}) was already used by [[#Gauss|Lagrange (1773) and Gauss (1798/1801)]] in the theory of integer binary quadratic forms. The invariant &lt;math&gt;X_{2}^{2}-X_{1}X_{3}&lt;/math&gt; was also studied by [[#Klein|Klein (1871)]] in connection to hyperbolic plane geometry (see equation ({{equationNote|3c}})), while the connection between '''u′''' and &lt;math&gt;X_{2}^{2}-X_{1}X_{3}&lt;/math&gt; with the Möbius transformation was analyzed by [[#Poincare2|Poincaré (1886)]] in relation to [[Fuchsian group]]s.  The adaptation to the Lorentz interval by which ({{equationNote|6c}}) becomes a Lorentz transformation was given by [[#Bianchi|Bianchi (1888)]] and [[#Fricke|Fricke (1891)]]. The Lorentz Transformation in the form of ({{equationNote|6d}}) was explicitly stated by [[#Gauss3|Gauss around 1800]] (posthumously published 1863), as well as [[#Selling|Selling (1873)]], [[#Bianchi|Bianchi (1888)]], [[#Fricke|Fricke (1891)]] in relation to integer indefinite ternary quadratic forms.

=== Lorentz transformation via quaternions and hyperbolic numbers ===

The Lorentz transformations can also be expressed in terms of [[biquaternion]]s having one real part ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' and one purely imaginary part ''ix&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' (some authors use the opposite convention). Its general form (on the left) and the corresponding boost (on the right) are as follows (where the overline denotes Hamiltonian conjugation and * complex conjugation):&lt;ref&gt;Synge (1972), pp. 13, 19, 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Girard (1984), pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[#Cayley3|Cayley (1854, 1855)]] derived quaternion transformations leaving invariant the sum of squares &lt;math&gt;x_{0}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;. [[#Cox2|Cox (1882/83)]] discussed the Lorentz interval in terms of Weierstrass coordinates &lt;math&gt;x_{0}^{2}-x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}=1&lt;/math&gt; in the course of adapting [[William Kingdon Clifford]]'s biquaternions ''a+ωb'' to hyperbolic geometry (ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-1 for hyperbolic geometry, ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=1 elliptic, ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0 parabolic). [[#Stephanos|Stephanos (1883)]] related the imaginary part of [[William Rowan Hamilton]]'s biquaternions to the radius of spheres, and introduced a homography leaving invariant the equations of oriented spheres or oriented planes in terms of [[Lie sphere geometry]]. [[#Buchheim|Buchheim (1884/85)]] discussed the Cayley absolute &lt;math&gt;x_{0}^{2}-x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}=0&lt;/math&gt; and adapted Clifford's biquaternions to hyperbolic geometry similar to Cox by using all three values of ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Eventually, the modern Lorentz transformation using biquaternions with ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-1 as in hyperbolic geometry was given by [[#Noether|Noether (1910), Klein (1910), Conway (1911), Silberstein (1911)]].

Often connected with quaternionic systems is the [[hyperbolic number]] ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=1, which also allows to formulate the Lorentz transformations:&lt;ref&gt;Sobczyk (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fjelstad (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the trigonometric expression e&lt;sup&gt;ix&lt;/sup&gt;=cos(x)+i·sin(x) ([[Euler's formula]]) was given by [[#Euler's gap|Euler (1748)]] and the hyperbolic analogue e&lt;sup&gt;εη&lt;/sup&gt; by [[#Cox2|Cockle (1848)]] in the framework of [[tessarine]]s, it was shown by [[#Cox2|Cox (1882/83)]] that one can identify ww′&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;=e&lt;sup&gt;εη&lt;/sup&gt; with associative quaternion multiplication. Here, e&lt;sup&gt;εη&lt;/sup&gt; is the hyperbolic [[versor]] with ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=1, the elliptic one follows with ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-1, and parabolic with ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0 (this should not be confused with the expression ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in Clifford's biquaternions also used by Cox, in which ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-1 is hyperbolic). The hyperbolic versor was also discussed by [[#Macfarlane|Macfarlane (1892, 1894, 1900)]] in terms of [[hyperbolic quaternion]]s. The expression ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=1 for hyperbolic motions (and ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-1 for elliptic, ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0 for parabolic motions) also appear in "biquaternions" defined by [[#Vahlen|Vahlen (1901/02, 1905)]].

More extended forms of complex and (bi-)quaternionic systems in terms of [[Clifford algebra]] can also be used to express the Lorentz transformations. For instance, using a system ''a'' of Clifford numbers one can transform the following general quadratic form into itself, in which the individual values of &lt;math&gt;i_{1}^{2},i_{2}^{2},\dots&lt;/math&gt; can be set to +1 or -1 at will:&lt;ref&gt;Cartan &amp; Study (1908), section 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rothe (1916), section 16&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}i_{1}^{2}x_{1}^{\prime2}+\cdots+i_{n}^{2}x_{n}^{\prime2}=i_{1}^{2}x_{1}^{2}+\cdots+i_{n}^{2}x_{n}^{2}\\
\hline (1)\ x'=axa^{-1}\\
(2)\ x'=\frac{ax+b}{\varepsilon^{2} bx+a}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The Lorentz interval follows if the sign of one i&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; differs from all others. The general definite form &lt;math&gt;x_{1}^{2}+\cdots+x_{n}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; as well as the general indefinite form &lt;math&gt;x_{1}^{2}+\cdots+x_{p}^{2}-x_{p+1}^{2}-\cdots-x_{p+q}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; and their invariance under transformation (1) was discussed by [[#Lipschitz|Lipschitz (1885/86)]], while hyperbolic motions were discussed by [[#Vahlen|Vahlen (1901/02, 1905)]] by setting ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=1 in transformation (2), while elliptic motions follow with ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-1 and parabolic motions ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0, all of which he also related to biquaternions.

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In (1770) he rewrote the addition law for the hyperbolic tangens (f) or (g) as:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lambert (1770), p. 335&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}t(y+z) &amp; =(ty+tz):(1+ty\cdot tz) &amp; (f)\\

{{Equation box 1|border colour = black |background colour=white|equation=The hyperbolic relations (a,b,c,d,e) are equivalent to the hyperbolic relations on the right of ({{equationNote|3b}}). In addition, by setting ''tφ=v/c'', (c) becomes the relative velocity between two frames, (d) the [[Lorentz factor]], (e) the [[proper velocity]], (f) or (g) becomes the Lorentz transformation of velocity (or relativistic [[velocity addition formula]]) for collinear velocities in ({{equationNote|4a}}).}}

===={{anchor|Gauss1}} Binary quadratic forms====

After the invariance of the sum of squares under linear substitutions was discussed by [[#Euler|Euler (1771)]], the general expressions of a [[binary quadratic form]] and its transformation was formulated by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] (1773) as follows&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lagrange (1773), section 22&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}py^{2}+2qyz+rz^{2}=Ps^{2}+2Qsx+Rx^{2}\\
\hline \begin{align}y &amp; =Ms+Nx\\
z &amp; =ms+nx
\end{align}
\left|\begin{matrix}\begin{align}P &amp; =pM^{2}+2qMm+rm^{2}\\
Q &amp; =pMN+q(Mn+Nm)+rmn\\
R &amp; =pN^{2}+2qNn+rn^{2}
\end{align}
\\
\downarrow\\
PR-Q^{2}=\left(pr-q^{2}\right)(Mn-Nm)^{2}
\end{matrix}\right.
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to ({{equationNote|Q1}}) ''(n=1)''. The theory of binary quadratic forms was considerably expanded by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1798, published 1801) in his [[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]. He rewrote Lagrange's formalism as follows using integer coefficients α,β,γ,δ:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Gauss (1798/1801), articles 157–158;&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F=ax^{2}+2bxy+cy^{2}=(a,b,c)\\
F'=a'x^{\prime2}+2b'x'y'+c'y^{\prime2}=(a',b',c')\\
\hline \begin{align}x &amp; =\alpha x'+\beta y'\\
y &amp; =\gamma x'+\delta y'\\
\\
x' &amp; =\delta x-\beta y\\
y' &amp; =-\gamma x+\alpha y
\end{align}
\left|\begin{matrix}\begin{align}a' &amp; =a\alpha^{2}+2b\alpha\gamma+c\gamma^{2}\\
b' &amp; =a\alpha\beta+b(\alpha\delta+\beta\gamma)+c\gamma\delta\\
c' &amp; =a\beta^{2}+2b\beta\delta+c\delta^{2}
\end{align}
\\
\downarrow\\
b^{2}-a'c'=\left(b^{2}-ac\right)(\alpha\delta-\beta\gamma)^{2}
\end{matrix}\right.
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to ({{equationNote|Q1}}) ''(n=1)''. As pointed out by Gauss, ''F'' and ''F' '' are called "proper equivalent" if αδ-βγ=1, so that ''F'' is contained in ''F' '' as well as ''F' '' is contained in ''F''. In addition, if another form ''F"'' is contained by the same procedure in ''F' '' it is also contained in ''F'' and so forth.&lt;ref group=M&gt;Gauss (1798/1801), section 159&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1|border colour = black |background colour=white|equation=The Lorentz interval &lt;math&gt;-x_{0}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; and the Lorentz transformation ({{equationNote|1a}}) ''(n=1)'' are a special case of the binary quadratic form of Lagrange and Gauss by setting ''(a,b,c)=(a',b',c')=(1,0,-1)''.

Alternatively, the transformation of coefficients ''(a,b,c)'' corresponds to Lorentz transformation '''u′''' in ({{equationNote|6c}}) by setting

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}(a,b,c) &amp; =\left(x_{0}+x_{2},\ x_{1},\ x_{0}-x_{2}\right)\\

===={{anchor|Gauss2}} Ternary quadratic forms====

Gauss (1798/1801)&lt;ref group=M&gt;Gauss (1798/1801), articles 266–285&lt;/ref&gt; also discussed ternary quadratic forms with the general expression

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}f=ax^{2}+a'x^{\prime2}+a''x^{\prime\prime2}+2bx'x''+2b'xx''+2b''xx'=\left(\begin{matrix}a, &amp; a', &amp; a''\\
b, &amp; b', &amp; b''
\end{matrix}\right)\\
g=my^{2}+m'y^{\prime2}+m''y^{\prime\prime2}+2ny'y''+2n'yy''+2n''yy'=\left(\begin{matrix}m, &amp; m', &amp; m''\\

\end{matrix}\right)\\
\hline \begin{align}x &amp; =\alpha y+\beta y'+\gamma y''\\
x' &amp; =\alpha'y+\beta'y'+\gamma'y''\\
x'' &amp; =\alpha''y+\beta''y'+\gamma''y''
\end{align}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to ({{equationNote|Q1}}) ''(n=2)''. Gauss called these forms definite when they have the same sign such as ''x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', or indefinite in the case of different signs such as ''x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''. While discussing the classification of ternary quadratic forms &lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle \left(\begin{matrix}a, &amp; a', &amp; a''\\
b, &amp; b', &amp; b''
\end{matrix}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;, Gauss (1801) presented twenty special cases, among them these six variants:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Gauss (1798/1801), article 277&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\left(\begin{matrix}1, &amp; -1, &amp; 1\\
0, &amp; 0, &amp; 0
\end{matrix}\right),\ \left(\begin{matrix}-1, &amp; 1, &amp; 1\\

\end{matrix}\right)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

{{Equation box 1|border colour = black |background colour=white|equation=These are all six types of Lorentz interval in 2+1 dimensions that can be produced as special cases of a ternary quadratic form. In general: The Lorentz interval &lt;math&gt;x^{2}+x^{\prime2}-x^{\prime\prime2}&lt;/math&gt; and the Lorentz transformation ({{equationNote|1a}}) ''(n=2)'' is an indefinite ternary quadratic form, which follows from the general ternary form by setting:

===={{anchor|Gauss3}} Cayley–Klein parameter====

The determination of all transformations of the Lorentz interval (as a special case of an integer ternary quadratic form) into itself was explicitly worked out by Gauss around 1800 (posthumously published in 1863), for which he provided a coefficient system α,β,γ,δ:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Gauss (1800/1863), p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauss' result was cited by [[#Bachmann|Bachmann (1869)]], [[#Selling|Selling (1873)]], [[#Bianchi|Bianchi (1888)]], [[Leonard Eugene Dickson]] (1923).&lt;ref&gt;Dickson (1923), p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; The parameters α,β,γ,δ, when applied to spatial rotations, were later called [[#Lorentz transformation via Cayley–Klein parameters, Möbius and spin transformations|Cayley–Klein parameters]].

===={{anchor|Cayley2}} Cayley–Klein parameter====

Already in 1854, Cayley published an alternative method of transforming quadratic forms by using certain parameters α,β,γ,δ in relation to a homographic transformation of a surface of second order into itself:&lt;ref group=M name=cayl1854&gt;Cayley (1854), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}xy-zw=0\\
x_{2}y_{2}-z_{2}w_{2}=x_{1}y_{1}-z_{1}w_{1}\\
\hline \left.\begin{align}MM'x_{2} &amp; =\gamma'\delta x_{1}+\alpha\alpha'y_{1}-\alpha'\delta z_{1}-\alpha\gamma'w_{1}\\
MM'y_{2} &amp; =\beta\beta'x_{1}+\gamma\delta'y_{1}-\beta\delta'z_{1}-\beta'\gamma w_{1}\\
MM'z_{2} &amp; =\beta\gamma'x_{1}+\gamma\alpha'y_{1}-\beta\alpha'z_{1}-\gamma\gamma'w_{1}\\
MM'w_{2} &amp; =\beta'\delta x_{1}+\alpha\delta'y_{1}-\delta\delta'z_{1}-\alpha\beta'w_{1}
\end{align}
\right|\begin{align}M^{2} &amp; =\alpha\beta-\gamma\delta\\
M^{\prime2} &amp; =\alpha'\beta'-\gamma'\delta'
\end{align}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

In the same paper, Cayley also introduced four different parameters ''M&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' in order to demonstrate the invariance of &lt;math&gt;x_1^2+y_1^2+z_1^2+w_1^2&lt;/math&gt;, and subsequently showed the relation to quaternions. Fricke &amp; Klein (1897) credited Cayley by calling the above transformation the most general (real or complex) space collineation of first kind of an absolute surface of second kind into itself.&lt;ref group=M name=fri /&gt; Parameters α,β,γ,δ are similar to what was later called [[#Lorentz transformation via Cayley–Klein parameters, Möbius and spin transformations|Cayley–Klein parameters]] in relation to spatial rotations (which was done by Cayley in 1879&lt;ref group=M&gt;Cayley (1879), p. 238f.&lt;/ref&gt; and before by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1866/67)&lt;ref group=M&gt;Helmholtz (1866/67), p. 513&lt;/ref&gt;).

{{Equation box 1|border colour = black |background colour=white|equation=Cayley's transformation becomes the Lorentz transformation &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}'&lt;/math&gt; in ({{equationNote|6a}}) by setting αδ-βγ=1 and:

==== {{anchor|Cayley3}} Quaternions ====

In 1845, Cayley showed that the Euler-Rodrigues parameters in equation ({{equationNote|Q3}}) representing rotations can be related to [[William Rowan Hamilton]]'s quaternions by using a pre- and a postfactor&lt;ref group=M&gt;Cayley (1845), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854 he showed how to transform the sum of four squares into itself:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Cayley (1854), p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor|Cayley4}} Cayley absolute and hyperbolic geometry====

In 1859, Cayley found out that a quadratic form or projective [[quadric]] can be used as an "absolute", serving as the basis of a projective metric (the [[Cayley–Klein metric]]).&lt;ref group=M&gt;Cayley (1859), sections 209–229&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, using the absolute ''x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0'', he defined the distance of two points as follows

:&lt;math&gt;\cos^{-1}\frac{xx'+yy'+zz'}{\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}\sqrt{x^{\prime2}+y^{\prime2}+z^{\prime2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

and he also alluded to the case of the unit sphere ''x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=1''. In the hands of [[#Klein|Klein (1871)]], all of this became essential for the discussion of non-Euclidean geometry (in particular the [[Beltrami–Klein model|Cayley–Klein or Beltrami–Klein model]] of hyperbolic geometry) and associated quadratic forms and transformations, including the Lorentz interval and Lorentz transformation.

Cayley (1884) himself also discussed some properties of the Beltrami–Klein model and the pseudosphere, and formulated coordinate transformations using the Cayley-Hermite formalism:&lt;ref group=M name=c84&gt;Cayley (1884), section 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}X_{1}^{2}+Y_{1}^{2}+Z_{1}^{2}=X^{2}+Y^{2}+Z^{2}\\

\Omega Q_{1} &amp; =-\mu^{2}P-(\nu-1)^{2}Q+2\mu(\nu-1)Z,\\

==={{anchor|Hermite}} Hermite (1853, 1854) – Cayley–Hermite transformation===

[[Charles Hermite]] (1853) extended the work of [[#Gauss2|Gauss (1801)]] and others (including himself) on ''definite'' ternary quadratic forms that can be transformed into ±''(x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)'', by additionally analyzing ''indefinite'' ternary quadratic forms that can be transformed into the Lorentz interval ±''(x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)''. By using [[#Cayley|Cayley's (1846)]] method of skew–symmetric coefficients, he derived a transformation leaving invariant almost all types of ternary quadratic forms.&lt;ref group=M name=herm&gt;Hermite (1853/54a), p. 307ff.&lt;/ref&gt; This was generalized by him in 1854 to all dimensions, so Hermite arrived at a transformation scheme leaving invariant almost all types of quadratic forms:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Hermite (1854b), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins (2013), p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

This result was subsequently expressed in matrix form by [[#Cayley|Cayley (1855)]]. Later, [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius]] (1877) added some modifications in order to include some special cases of quadratic forms that cannot be dealt with by the Cayley–Hermite transformation.&lt;ref group=M&gt;Frobenius (1877)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins (2013), pp. 219ff&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugenio Beltrami]] (1868a) introduced coordinates of the [[Beltrami–Klein model]] of hyperbolic geometry, and formulated the corresponding transformations in terms of homographies:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Beltrami (1868a), pp. 287-288; Note I; Note II&lt;/ref&gt;

(where a and R are real in spherical geometry, in hyperbolic geometry they are imaginary), and for arbitrary dimensions in (1868b)&lt;ref group=M&gt;Beltrami (1868b), pp. 232, 240–241, 253–254&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Gustav Heinrich Bachmann]] (1869) adapted [[#Hermite|Hermite's (1853/54)]] transformation of ternary quadratic forms to the case of integer transformations. He particularly analyzed the Lorentz interval and its transformation, and also alluded to the analogue result of [[#Gauss3|Gauss (1800)]] in terms of Cayley–Klein parameters, while Bachmann formulated his result in terms of the Cayley–Hermite transformation:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Bachmann (1869), p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor|Klein1}} Cayley absolute and non-Euclidean geometry====

Elaborating on [[#Cayley4|Cayley's (1859)]] definition of an "absolute" ([[Cayley–Klein metric]]), [[Felix Klein]] (1871) defined a "fundamental [[conic section]]" in order to discuss motions such as rotation and translation in the non-Euclidean plane,&lt;ref group=M&gt;Klein (1871), pp. 601–602&lt;/ref&gt; and another fundamental form by using [[homogeneous coordinates]] ''x,y'' related to a circle with radius ''2c'' with measure of curvature &lt;math&gt;-\tfrac{1}{4c^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. When ''c'' is positive, the measure of curvature is negative and the fundamental conic section is real, thus the geometry becomes hyperbolic ([[Beltrami–Klein model]]):&lt;ref group=M&gt;Klein (1871), p. 618&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}x_{1}x_{2}-x_{3}^{2} &amp; =0\\

\\
\left(\alpha_{1}\alpha_{2}-\alpha_{3}^{2}=0\right)

In (1873) he pointed out that hyperbolic geometry in terms of a surface of constant negative curvature can be related to a quadratic equation, which can be transformed into a sum of squares of which one square has a different sign, and can also be related to the interior of a surface of second degree corresponding to an ellipsoid or two-sheet [[hyperboloid]].&lt;ref group=M&gt;Klein (1873), pp. 127-128&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor|Klein2}} Möbius transformation, spin transformation, Cayley–Klein parameter====

In (1872) while devising the [[Erlangen program]], Klein discussed the general relation between projective metrics, [[binary form]]s and conformal geometry transforming a sphere into itself in terms of linear transformations of the [[complex variable]] ''x+iy''.&lt;ref group=M&gt;Klein (1872), 6&lt;/ref&gt; Following Klein, these relations were discussed by [[Ludwig Wedekind]] (1875) using &lt;math&gt;z'=\tfrac{\alpha z+\beta}{\gamma z+\delta}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref group=M&gt;Wedekind (1875), 1&lt;/ref&gt; Klein (1875) then showed that all finite groups of motions follow by determining all finite groups of such linear transformations of ''x+iy'' into itself.&lt;ref group=M&gt;Klein (1875), §1–2&lt;/ref&gt; In (1878),&lt;ref group=M&gt;Klein (1878), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Klein classified the substitutions of &lt;math&gt;\omega'=\tfrac{\alpha\omega+\beta}{\gamma\omega+\delta}&lt;/math&gt; with αδ-βγ=1 into hyperbolic, elliptic, parabolic, and in (1882)&lt;ref group=M&gt;Klein (1882), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; he added the loxodromic substitution as the combination of elliptic and hyperbolic ones. (In 1890, [[Robert Fricke]] in his edition of Klein's lectures of [[elliptic function]]s and [[Modular form]]s, referred to the analogy of this treatment to the theory of quadratic forms as given by Gauss and in particular Dirichlet.)&lt;ref group=M name=fri /&gt;

In (1884) Klein related the linear fractional transformations (interpreted as rotations around the ''x+iy''-sphere) to Cayley–Klein parameters [α,β,γ,δ], to Euler–Rodrigues parameters ''[a,b,c,d]'', and to the [[unit sphere]] by means of [[stereographic projection]], and also discussed transformations preserving surfaces of second degree equivalent to the transformation given by [[#Cayley2|Cayley (1854)]]:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Klein (1884), Part I, Ch.

Klein's work was summarized and extended [[#Fricke|Fricke (1893, 1897)]] (supported by Klein).

===={{anchor|Klein3}} Spiral transformation====

In 1890 Klein discussed a general type of Euclidean or Non-Euclidean motion in relation to a problem posed by Helmholtz (1868), with the following transformation&lt;ref group=M name=klein1890&gt;Klein (1890b), p. 565&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x'+iy'=e^{(\alpha+i\beta)t}(x+iy)+a+ib&lt;/math&gt;

In 1893 he called the special case with ''a=b=0'' a "spiral transformation":&lt;ref group=M&gt;Klein (1893c), p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}x'+iy' &amp; =e^{(\alpha+i\beta)t}(x+iy) &amp; \text{(1)}\\
x'-iy' &amp; =e^{(\alpha-i\beta)t}(x-iy) &amp; \text{(2)}

===={{anchor|Klein4}} Conformal transformation and polyspherical coordinates====

In relation to line geometry, Klein (1871/72)&lt;ref group=M&gt;Klein (1871/72), p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; used coordinates satisfying the condition &lt;math&gt;s_{1}^{2}+s_{2}^{2}+s_{2}^{2}+s_{2}^{2}+s_{5}^{2}=0&lt;/math&gt;. They were introduced in 1868 (belatedly published in 1872/73) by [[Gaston Darboux]]&lt;ref group=M&gt;Darboux (1872/73), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; as a system of five coordinates in ''R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' (later called "pentaspherical" coordinates) in which the last coordinate is imaginary. [[Sophus Lie]] (1871)&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lie (1871), p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; more generally used ''n+2'' coordinates in ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' (later called "polyspherical" coordinates) satisfying &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sum_{i=1}^{i=n+2}x_{i}^{2}=0&lt;/math&gt; in which the last coordinate is imaginary, as a means to discuss conformal transformations generated by inversions. These simultaneous publications can be explained by the fact that Darboux, Lie, and Klein corresponded with each other by letter.

When the last coordinate is defined as real, the corresponding polyspherical coordinates satisfy the form of a sphere.  Initiated by lectures of Klein between 1889–1890, his student [[Friedrich Carl Alwin Pockels|Friedrich Pockels]] (1891) used such real coordinates, emphasizing that all of these coordinate systems remain invariant under conformal transformations generated by inversions:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Pockels (1891), pp. 197–206&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x_1^2+x_2^2+\cdots+x_{n+1}^2-x_{n+2}^2=0 \text{ or } \sum_1^{n+1} x_h^2-x_{n+2}^2=0&lt;/math&gt;

Special cases were described by Klein (1893):&lt;ref group=M&gt;Klein (1893c), pp. 200ff (pentaspherical), pp. 373ff (tetracyclical)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y_1^2+y_2^2+y_3^2+y_4^2-y_5^2=0&lt;/math&gt; (pentaspherical).

:&lt;math&gt;x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2-x_4^2=0&lt;/math&gt; (tetracyclical).

Both systems were also described by [[Maxime Bôcher]] (1894) in an expanded version of a thesis supervised by Klein.&lt;ref group=M&gt;Bôcher (1894), pp. 30–34, 40–43&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1|border colour = black |background colour=white|equation=Polyspherical coordinates indicate that the conformal group {{nowrap|Con(p,0)}} is isomorphic to the Lorentz group SO(p+1,1).&lt;ref&gt;Kastrup (2008), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Con(2,0) – known as Möbius group – is related to tetracyclical coordinates satisfying &lt;math&gt;x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}-x_{4}^{2}=0&lt;/math&gt;, which is nothing other than the Lorentz interval invariant under the Lorentz group SO(3,1).}}

(The conformal nature of the linear fractional transformation &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{a+bz}{c+dz}&lt;/math&gt; of a complex variable &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; was already discussed by Euler (1777)).&lt;ref group=M&gt;Euler (1777), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kastrup&gt;Kastrup (2008), section 2.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Liouville's theorem was extended to all dimensions by [[Sophus Lie]] (1871a).&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lie (1871), pp. 199–209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kastrup (2008), section 2.3&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Lie described a manifold whose elements can be represented by spheres, where the last coordinate ''y&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be related to an imaginary radius by ''iy&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;'':&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lie (1871a), pp. 199–209&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\sum_{i=1}^{i=n} (x_i-y_i)^2+y_{n+1}^2=0 \\
\downarrow\\
\sum_{i=1}^{i=n+1} (y_i^{\prime}-y_i^{\prime\prime})^2=0
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If the second equation is satisfied, two spheres ''y′'' and ''y″'' are in contact. Lie then defined the correspondence between [[Contact geometry|contact transformations]] in ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and conformal point transformations in ''R&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;'': The sphere of space ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' consists of ''n+1'' parameter (coordinates plus imaginary radius), so if this sphere is taken as the element of space ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', it follows that ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' now corresponds to ''R&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;''. Therefore, any transformation (to which he counted [[#Lorentz transformation via orthogonal transformation|orthogonal transformations]] and inversions) leaving invariant the condition of contact between spheres in ''R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'', corresponds to the transformation of points in ''R&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Eventually, Lie (1871/72) pointed out that the conformal point transformations of ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' consist of motions (such as [[rigid transformation]]s and orthogonal transformations), similarity transformations, and inversions.&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lie (1871/72), p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1|border colour = black |background colour=white|equation=As shown by [[#Bateman|Bateman and Cunningham (1909)]], the spacetime conformal group Con(3,1) of "[[spherical wave transformation]]s" corresponds to the transformations of Lie's sphere geometry in which the radius indicates the fourth coordinate, while the Lorentz group SO(3,1) is a subgroup of Con(3,1).}}

===={{anchor|Lie2}} Lie group, hyperbolic motions, and infinitesimal transformations====

In (1885/86), Lie identified the projective group of a general surface of second degree &lt;math&gt;\sum f_{ik}x_{i}'x_{k}'=0&lt;/math&gt; with the group of non-Euclidean motions.&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lie (1885/86), p. 411&lt;/ref&gt; In a thesis guided by Lie, [[Hermann Werner]] (1889) discussed this projective group by using the equation of a unit sphere as the surface of second degree, and also gave the corresponding infinitesimal projective transformations:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Werner (1889), pp. 4, 28&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+\dots+x_{n}^{2}=1\\
\hline x_{i}p_{\varkappa}-x_{\varkappa}p_{i},\quad p_{i}-x_{i}\sum_{1}^{n}{\scriptstyle j}\ x_{j}p_{j}\quad(i,\varkappa=1,\dots, n)\\
\text{where}\\
\left(Q_{i},Q_{\varkappa}\right)=R_{i,\varkappa};\ \left(Q_{i},Q_{j,\varkappa}\right)=\varepsilon_{i,j}Q_{\varkappa}-\varepsilon_{i,\varkappa}Q_{j};\\
\left(R_{i,\varkappa},R_{\mu,\nu}\right)=\varepsilon_{\varkappa,\mu}R_{i,\nu}-\varepsilon_{\varkappa,\nu}R_{i,\mu}-\varepsilon_{,\mu}R_{\varkappa,\nu}+\varepsilon_{i,\nu}R_{\varkappa,\mu}\\
\left[\varepsilon_{i,\varkappa}\equiv0\ \text{for}\ i\ne\varkappa;\ \varepsilon_{i,i}=1\right]
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, Lie (1890)&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lie (1890a), p. 295;&lt;/ref&gt; defined non-Euclidean motions in terms of two forms &lt;math&gt;x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}\pm1=0&lt;/math&gt; in which the imaginary form with &lt;math&gt;+1&lt;/math&gt; denotes the group of elliptic motions (in Klein's terminology), the real form with −1 the group of hyperbolic motions, with the latter having the same form as Werner's transformation:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lie (1890a), p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}x_{1}^{2}+\dots+x_{n}^{2}-1=0\\
\hline p_{k}-x_{k}\sum j_{1}^{0}x_{j}p_{j},\quad x_{i}p_{k}-x_{k}p_{i}\quad(i,k=1\dots n)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Summarizing, Lie (1893) discussed the real continuous groups of the conic sections representing non-Euclidean motions, which in the case of hyperbolic motions have the form:

:&lt;math&gt;x^{2}+y^{2}-1=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lie (1893), p. 474&lt;/ref&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}-1=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lie (1893), p. 479&lt;/ref&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x_{1}^{2}+\dots+x_{n}^{2}-1=0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lie (1893), p. 481&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1|border colour = black |background colour=white|equation=The group of hyperbolic motions is isomorphic to the Lorentz group. The interval &lt;math&gt;x_{1}^{2}+\dots+x_{n}^{2}-1=0&lt;/math&gt; becomes the Lorentz interval &lt;math&gt;x_{1}^{2}+\dots+x_{n}^{2}-x_{0}^{2}=0&lt;/math&gt; by setting

==={{anchor|Selling}} Selling (1873–74) – Quadratic forms===

Continuing the work of [[#Gauss2|Gauss (1801)]] on definite ternary quadratic forms and [[#Hermite|Hermite (1853)]] on indefinite ternary quadratic forms, [[Eduard Selling]] (1873) used the auxiliary coefficients ξ,η,ζ by which a definite form &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{f}&lt;/math&gt; and an indefinite form ''f'' can be rewritten in terms of three squares:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Selling (1873), p. 174 and p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bachmann (1923), chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;

\end{align}
}&lt;/math&gt;

In addition, Selling showed that auxiliary coefficients ξηζ can be geometrically interpreted as point coordinates which are in motion upon one sheet of a two-sheet hyperboloid, which is related to Selling's formalism for the reduction of indefinite forms by using definite forms.&lt;ref group=M&gt;Selling (1873), pp. 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;

Selling also reproduced the Lorentz transformation given by [[#Gauss3|Gauss (1800/63)]], to whom he gave full credit, and called it the only example of a particular indefinite ternary form known to him that has ever been discussed:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Selling (1873/74), p. 227 (see also p. 225 for citation).&lt;/ref&gt;

where ''k'' is the reciprocal measure of curvature, ''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=∞ denotes [[Euclidean geometry]], ''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&gt;0 [[elliptic geometry]], and ''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;0 hyperbolic geometry. In (1877/78) he pointed out the possibility and some characteristics of a transformation (indicating rigid motions) preserving the above form.&lt;ref group=M&gt;Killing (1877/78), eq. 25 on p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; In (1879/80) he wrote the corresponding transformations as a [[Rotation matrix#Rotation matrix from axis and angle|general rotation matrix]]&lt;ref group=M&gt;Killing (1879/80), p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

Killing (1887/88)&lt;ref group=M&gt;Killing (1887/88a), pp. 274–275&lt;/ref&gt; defined the infinitesimal projective transformations in relation to the following quadratic form of second degree by:

and in (1892) he defined the infinitesimal transformation for non-Euclidean motions in terms of Weierstrass coordinates:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Killing (1892), p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1|border colour = black |background colour=white|equation=This is a special case of Lorentz transformation ({{equationNote|6a}}) with ''-1=x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''.}}

Poincaré (1881b) also used the Möbius transformation &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{az+b}{cz+d}&lt;/math&gt; in relation to [[Fuchsian function]]s and the discontinuous [[Fuchsian group]], being a special case of the hyperbolic group leaving invariant the “fundamental circle” ([[Poincaré disk model]] and [[Poincaré half-plane model]] of hyperbolic geometry).&lt;ref group=M&gt;Poincaré (1881b), p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; He then extended [[#Klein2|Klein's (1878-1882)]] study on the relation between Möbius transformations and hyperbolic, elliptic, parabolic, and loxodromic substitutions, and while formulating [[Kleinian group]]s (1883) he used the following transformation leaving invariant the [[generalized circle]]:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Poincaré (1883), pp. 49–50; 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor|Cox2}} Quaternions====

Subsequently, Cox (1882/83) also described hyperbolic geometry in terms of an analogue to [[quaternion]]s and [[Hermann Grassmann]]'s [[exterior algebra]]. To that end, he used [[hyperbolic number]]s, which were first introduced by [[James Cockle]] (1848) in the framework of his [[tessarine]] algebra as follows:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Cockle (1848), p. 438&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^{jy}=1+jy+\frac{y^{2}}{2}+j\frac{y^{3}}{2.3}+\frac{y^{4}}{2.3.4}+\&amp;c.,\ \left(j^{2}=1\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

In the hands of Cox (who doesn't mention Cockle) this expression becomes a means to transfer point P to point Q in the hyperbolic plane, which he wrote in the form:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Cox (1882/83a), pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}QP^{-1}=\cosh\theta+\iota\sinh\theta\\
QP^{-1}=e^{\iota\theta}
\end{matrix}\left(\iota^{2}=1\right)&lt;/math&gt;

In (1882/83a) he showed the equivalence of ''PQ''=-cosh(θ)+ι·sinh(θ) with "quaternion multiplication",&lt;ref group=M&gt;Cox (1882/83a), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; and in (1882/83b) he described ''QP''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;=cosh(θ)+ι·sinh(θ) as being "associative quaternion multiplication".&lt;ref group=M&gt;Cox (1882/83b), p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; He also showed that the position of point P in the hyperbolic plane may be determined by three quantities in terms of Weierstrass coordinates obeying the relation ''z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=1''.&lt;ref group=M&gt;Cox (1882/83a), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1|border colour = black |background colour=white|equation=Cox's associative quaternion multiplication using the hyperbolic versor is equivalent to the Lorentz boost ({{equationNote|7b}}) by setting &lt;math&gt;Q=x_{1}^{\prime}+\iota x_{0}^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P=x_{1}+\iota x_{0}&lt;/math&gt;.}}

Cox went on to develop an algebra for hyperbolic space analogous to Clifford's [[biquaternion]]s. While Clifford (1873) used biquaternions of the form ''a+ωb'' in which ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0 denotes parabolic space and ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=1 elliptic space, Cox discussed hyperbolic space using the imaginary quantity &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and therefore ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-1.&lt;ref group=M&gt;On pp. 104-105 he started using the term v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-1, on p. 106 he noted that one can simply use &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; instead of ''v'', and on p. 112 he adopted Clifford's notation by setting ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-1.&lt;/ref&gt; He also obtained relations of quaternion multiplication in terms of Weierstrass coordinates:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Cox (1882/83a), pp. 108-109&lt;/ref&gt;

In two dimensions the transformation or oriented lines has the form (''R'' being the radius):&lt;ref group=M name=laguerre&gt;Laguerre (1882), pp. 550–551.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cyparissos Stephanos]] (1883)&lt;ref group=M&gt;Stephanos (1883), p. 590ff&lt;/ref&gt; showed that Hamilton's biquaternion ''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;ι&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ι&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ι&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be interpreted as an oriented sphere in terms of [[#Lie|Lie's sphere geometry (1871)]], having the vector ''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;ι&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ι&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ι&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' as its center and the scalar &lt;math&gt;a_{0}\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; as its radius. Its norm &lt;math&gt;a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+a_{3}^{2}+a_{4}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; is thus equal to the power of a point of the corresponding sphere. In particular, the norm of two quaternions ''N(Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)'' (the corresponding spheres are in contact with ''N(Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)=0'') is equal to the tangential distance between two spheres. The general contact transformation between two spheres then can be given by a [[homography]] using 4 arbitrary quaternions ''A,B,C,D'' and two variable quaternions ''X,Y'':&lt;ref group=M&gt;Stephanos (1883), p. 592&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartan &amp; Study (1908), p. 460&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rothe (1916), p. 1399&lt;/ref&gt;

\end{align}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If the right-hand sides of his equations are multiplied by γ they are the modern Lorentz transformation ({{equationNote|4b}}). In Voigt's theory the speed of light is invariant, but his transformations mix up a relativistic boost together with a rescaling of space-time. Optical phenomena in free space are [[Scale invariance|scale]], [[Conformal map|conformal]] (using the factor λ discussed [[#Lorentz transformation via spherical wave transformation|above]]), and [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariant]], so the combination is invariant too.&lt;ref name=pais /&gt; For instance, Lorentz transformations can be extended by using &lt;math&gt;l=\sqrt{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref group=R&gt;Lorentz (1915/16), p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x^{\prime}=\gamma l\left(x-vt\right),\quad y^{\prime}=ly,\quad z^{\prime}=lz,\quad t^{\prime}=\gamma l\left(t-x\frac{v}{c^{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

''l''=1/γ gives the Voigt transformation, ''l''=1 the Lorentz transformation. But scale transformations are not a symmetry of all the laws of nature, only of electromagnetism, so these transformations cannot be used to formulate a [[principle of relativity]] in general. It was demonstrated by Poincaré and Einstein that one has to set ''l''=1 in order to make the above transformation symmetric and to form a group as required by the relativity principle, therefore the Lorentz transformation is the only viable choice.

Voigt sent his 1887 paper to Lorentz in 1908,&lt;ref&gt;Voigt's transformations and the beginning of the relativistic revolution, Ricardo Heras, arXiv:1411.2559 [https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2559]&lt;/ref&gt; and that was acknowledged in 1909: {{Quote|In a paper „Über das Doppler'sche Princip", published in 1887 (Gött. Nachrichten, p. 41) and which to my regret has escaped my notice all these years, Voigt has applied to equations of the form (7) (§ 3 of this book) [namely &lt;math&gt;\Delta\Psi-\tfrac{1}{c^{2}}\tfrac{\partial^{2}\Psi}{\partial t^{2}}=0&lt;/math&gt;] a transformation equivalent to the formulae (287) and (288) [namely &lt;math&gt;x^{\prime}=\gamma l\left(x-vt\right),\ y^{\prime}=ly,\ z^{\prime}=lz,\ t^{\prime}=\gamma l\left(t-\tfrac{v}{c^{2}}x\right)&lt;/math&gt;]. The idea of the transformations used above (and in § 44) might therefore have been borrowed from Voigt and the proof that it does not alter the form of the equations for the ''free'' ether is contained in his paper.&lt;ref group=R&gt;Lorentz (1915/16), p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Also [[Hermann Minkowski]] said in 1908 that the transformations which play the main role in the principle of relativity were first examined by Voigt in 1887. Voigt responded in the same paper by saying that his theory was based on an elastic theory of light, not an electromagnetic one. However, he concluded that some results were actually the same.&lt;ref group=R&gt;Bucherer (1908), p. 762&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}=\left(\frac{q\mathrm{r}}{r^{2}}\right)\left(1-\frac{v^{2}\sin^{2}\theta}{c^{2}}\right)^{-3/2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Consequently, [[Joseph John Thomson]] (1889)&lt;ref group=R&gt;Thomson (1889), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; found a way to substantially simplify calculations concerning moving charges by using the following mathematical transformation (like other authors such as Lorentz or Larmor, also Thomson implicitly used the [[Galilean transformation]] ''z-vt'' in his equation&lt;ref name=mil /&gt;):

In order to explain the [[aberration of light]] and the result of the [[Fizeau experiment]] in accordance with [[Maxwell's equations]], Lorentz in 1892 developed a model ("[[Lorentz ether theory]]") in which the aether is completely motionless, and the speed of light in the aether is constant in all directions. In order to calculate the optics of moving bodies, Lorentz introduced the following quantities to transform from the aether system into a moving system (it's unknown whether he was influenced by Voigt, Heaviside, and Thomson)&lt;ref group=R&gt;Lorentz (1892a), p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=milf&gt;Miller (1982), 1.4 &amp; 1.5&lt;/ref&gt;

\gamma\frac{v}{c} &amp; =\frac{v}{\sqrt{c^{2}-v^{2}}}
\end{align}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the [[Galilean transformation]] ''x-vt''. Except the additional γ in the time transformation, this is the complete Lorentz transformation ({{equationNote|4b}}).&lt;ref name=milf /&gt; While ''t'' is the "true" time for observers resting in the aether, ''t′'' is an auxiliary variable only for calculating processes for moving systems. It is also important that Lorentz and later also Larmor formulated this transformation in two steps. At first an implicit Galilean transformation, and later the expansion into the "fictitious" electromagnetic system with the aid of the Lorentz transformation. In order to explain the negative result of the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]], he (1892b)&lt;ref group=R&gt;Lorentz (1892b), p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the additional hypothesis that also intermolecular forces are affected in a similar way and introduced [[length contraction]] in his theory (without proof as he admitted). The same hypothesis was already made by [[George FitzGerald]] in 1889 based on Heaviside's work. While length contraction was a real physical effect for Lorentz, he considered the time transformation only as a heuristic working hypothesis and a mathematical stipulation.

In 1895, Lorentz further elaborated on his theory and introduced the "theorem of corresponding states". This theorem states that a moving observer (relative to the ether) in his „fictitious" field makes the same observations as a resting observers in his „real" field for velocities to first order in ''v/c''. Lorentz showed that the dimensions of electrostatic systems in the ether and a moving frame are connected by this transformation:&lt;ref group=R&gt;Lorentz (1895), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Larmor noted that if it is assumed that the constitution of molecules is electrical then the FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction is a consequence of this transformation, explaining the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]]. It's notable that Larmor was the first who recognized that some sort of [[time dilation]] is a consequence of this transformation as well, because "individual electrons describe corresponding parts of their orbits in times shorter for the [rest] system in the ratio 1/γ".&lt;ref&gt;Darrigol (2000), Chap. 8.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macrossan (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Larmor wrote his electrodynamical equations and transformations neglecting terms of higher order than ''(v/c)''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; – when his 1897 paper was reprinted in 1929, Larmor added the following comment in which he described how they can be made valid to all orders of ''v/c'':&lt;ref group=R&gt;Larmor (1897/1929), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Nothing need be neglected: the transformation is ''exact'' if ''(v/c)''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is replaced by ''εv/c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the equations and also in the change following from ''t'' to ''t′'', as is worked out in ''Aether and Matter'' (1900), p. 168, and as Lorentz found it to be in 1904, thereby stimulating the modern schemes of intrinsic relational relativity.}}

In line with that comment, in his book Aether and Matter published in 1900, Larmor used a modified local time ''t″=t′-εvx′/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' instead of the 1897 expression ''t′=t-vx/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' by replacing ''v/c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with ''εv/c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so that ''t″'' is now identical to the one given by Lorentz in 1892, which he combined with a Galilean transformation for the ''x′, y′, z′, t′'' coordinates:&lt;ref group=R&gt;Larmor (1900), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\text{original} &amp; \text{modern}\\

\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Larmor knew that the Michelson–Morley experiment was accurate enough to detect an effect of motion depending on the factor ''(v/c)''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and so he sought the transformations which were "accurate to second order" (as he put it). Thus he wrote the final transformations (where ''x′=x-vt'' and ''t″'' as given above) as:&lt;ref group=R&gt;Larmor (1900), p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\text{original} &amp; \text{modern}\\

by which he arrived at the complete Lorentz transformation ({{equationNote|4b}}). Larmor showed that Maxwell's equations were invariant under this two-step transformation, "to second order in ''v/c''" – it was later shown by Lorentz (1904) and Poincaré (1905) that they are indeed invariant under this transformation to all orders in ''v/c''.

Larmor gave credit to Lorentz in two papers published in 1904, in which he used the term "Lorentz transformation" for Lorentz's first order transformations of coordinates and field configurations:

{{Quote|p. 583: [..] Lorentz's transformation for passing from the field of activity of a stationary electrodynamic material system to that of one moving with uniform velocity of translation through the aether.&lt;br /&gt; p. 585: [..] the Lorentz transformation has shown us what is not so immediately obvious [..]&lt;ref group=R&gt;Larmor (1904a), p. 583, 585&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt; p. 622: [..] the transformation first developed by Lorentz: namely, each point in space is to have its own origin from which time is measured, its "local time" in Lorentz's phraseology, and then the values of the electric and magnetic vectors [..] at all points in the aether between the molecules in the system at rest, are the same as those of the vectors [..] at the corresponding points in the convected system at the same local times.&lt;ref group=R&gt;Larmor (1904b), p. 622&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== {{anchor|Lorentz2}} Lorentz (1899, 1904) ===

Also Lorentz extended his theorem of corresponding states in 1899. First he wrote a transformation equivalent to the one from 1892 (again, ''x''* must be replaced by ''x-vt''):&lt;ref group=R&gt;Lorentz (1899), p. 429&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\text{original} &amp; \text{modern}\\
\hline \left.\begin{align}x^{\prime} &amp; =\frac{V}{\sqrt{V^{2}-\mathfrak{p}_{x}^{2}}}x\\
y^{\prime} &amp; =y\\
z^{\prime} &amp; =z\\
t^{\prime} &amp; =t-\frac{\mathfrak{p}_{x}}{V^{2}-\mathfrak{p}_{x}^{2}}x
\end{align}
\right| &amp; \begin{align}x^{\prime} &amp; =\gamma x^{\ast}=\gamma(x-vt)\\
y^{\prime} &amp; =y\\
z^{\prime} &amp; =z\\
t^{\prime} &amp; =t-\frac{\gamma^{2}vx^{\ast}}{c^{2}}=\gamma^{2}\left(t-\frac{vx}{c^{2}}\right)
\end{align}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Then he introduced a factor &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; of which he said he has no means of determining it, and modified his transformation as follows (where the above value of ''t′'' has to be inserted):&lt;ref group=R&gt;Lorentz (1899), p. 439&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\text{original} &amp; \text{modern}\\
\hline \left.\begin{align}x &amp; =\frac{\varepsilon}{k}x^{\prime\prime}\\
y &amp; =\varepsilon y^{\prime\prime}\\
z &amp; =\varepsilon x^{\prime\prime}\\
t^{\prime} &amp; =k\varepsilon t^{\prime\prime}\\
k &amp; =\frac{V}{\sqrt{V^{2}-\mathfrak{p}_{x}^{2}}}
\end{align}
\right| &amp; \begin{align}x^{\ast}=x-vt &amp; =\frac{\varepsilon}{\gamma}x^{\prime\prime}\\
y &amp; =\varepsilon y^{\prime\prime}\\
z &amp; =\varepsilon z^{\prime\prime}\\
t^{\prime}=\gamma^{2}\left(t-\frac{vx}{c^{2}}\right) &amp; =\gamma\varepsilon t^{\prime\prime}\\
\gamma &amp; =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}
\end{align}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to the complete Lorentz transformation ({{equationNote|4b}}) when solved for ''x″'' and ''t″'' and with ε=1. Like Larmor, Lorentz noticed in 1899&lt;ref group=R&gt;Lorentz (1899), p. 442&lt;/ref&gt; also some sort of time dilation effect in relation to the frequency of oscillating electrons "''that in ''S'' the time of vibrations be ''kε'' times as great as in ''S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''''", where ''S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the aether frame.&lt;ref&gt;Jannsen (1995), Kap. 3.3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 he rewrote the equations in the following form by setting ''l''=1/ε (again, ''x''* must be replaced by ''x-vt''):&lt;ref group=R&gt;Lorentz (1904), p. 812&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\text{original} &amp; \text{modern}\\
\hline \left.\begin{align}x^{\prime} &amp; =klx\\
y^{\prime} &amp; =ly\\
z^{\prime} &amp; =lz\\

\end{align}
\right| &amp; \begin{align}x^{\prime} &amp; =\gamma lx^{\ast}=\gamma l(x-vt)\\
y^{\prime} &amp; =ly\\
z^{\prime} &amp; =lz\\
t^{\prime} &amp; =\frac{lt}{\gamma}-\frac{\gamma lvx^{\ast}}{c^{2}}=\gamma l\left(t-\frac{vx}{c^{2}}\right)
\end{align}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Under the assumption that ''l=1'' when ''v''=0, he demonstrated that ''l=1'' must be the case at all velocities, therefore length contraction can only arise in the line of motion. So by setting the factor ''l'' to unity, Lorentz's transformations now assumed the same form as Larmor's and are now completed. Unlike Larmor, who restricted himself to show the covariance of Maxwell's equations to second order, Lorentz tried to widen its covariance to all orders in ''v/c''. He also derived the correct formulas for the velocity dependence of [[electromagnetic mass]], and concluded that the transformation formulas must apply to all forces of nature, not only electrical ones.&lt;ref group=R&gt;Lorentz (1904), p. 826&lt;/ref&gt; However, he didn't achieve full covariance of the transformation equations for charge density and velocity.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1981), Chap. 1.12.2&lt;/ref&gt; When the 1904 paper was reprinted in 1913, Lorentz therefore added the following remark:&lt;ref&gt;Jannsen (1995), Chap. 3.5.6&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Zitat|One will notice that in this work the transformation equations of Einstein’s Relativity Theory have not quite been attained. [..] On this circumstance depends the clumsiness of many of the further considerations in this work.}}

=== {{anchor|Poincare3}} Poincaré (1900, 1905) ===

==== Local time ====

Neither Lorentz or Larmor gave a clear physical interpretation of the origin of local time. However, [[Henri Poincaré]] in 1900 commented on the origin of Lorentz’s "wonderful invention" of local time.&lt;ref&gt;Darrigol (2005), Kap. 4&lt;/ref&gt; He remarked that it arose when clocks in a moving reference frame are synchronised by exchanging signals which are assumed to travel with the same speed &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; in both directions, which lead to what is nowadays called [[relativity of simultaneity]], although Poincaré's calculation does not involve length contraction or time dilation.&lt;ref group=R&gt;Poincaré (1900), pp. 272–273&lt;/ref&gt; In order to synchronise the clocks here on Earth (the ''x*, t''* frame) a light signal from one clock (at the origin) is sent to another (at ''x''*), and is sent back. It's supposed that the Earth is moving with speed ''v'' in the ''x''-direction (= ''x''*-direction) in some rest system (''x, t'') (''i.e.'' the [[luminiferous aether]] system for Lorentz and Larmor). The time of flight outwards is

:&lt;math&gt;\delta t_{o}=\frac{x^{\ast}}{\left(c-v\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

and the time of flight back is

:&lt;math&gt;\delta t_{b}=\frac{x^{\ast}}{\left(c+v\right)}&lt;/math&gt;.

The elapsed time on the clock when the signal is returned is &lt;math&gt;\delta t_{o}+\delta t_{b}&lt;/math&gt; and the time &lt;math&gt;t^{\ast}=\left(\delta t_{o}+\delta t_{b}\right)/2&lt;/math&gt; is ascribed to the moment when the light signal reached the distant clock. In the rest frame the time &lt;math&gt;t=\delta t_{o}&lt;/math&gt; is ascribed to that same instant. Some algebra gives the relation between the different time coordinates ascribed to the moment of reflection. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;t^{\ast}=t-\frac{\gamma^{2}vx^{*}}{c^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

identical to Lorentz (1892). By dropping the factor γ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; under the assumption that &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}\ll1&lt;/math&gt;, Poincaré gave the result &lt;math&gt;t^{\ast}=t-vx^{\ast}/c^{2}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the form used by Lorentz in 1895.

Similar physical interpretations of local time were later given by [[Emil Cohn]] (1904)&lt;ref group=R&gt;Cohn (1904b), p. 1408&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Max Abraham]] (1905).&lt;ref group=R&gt;Abraham (1905), § 42&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lorentz transformation ====

On June 5, 1905 (published June 9) Poincaré simplified the equations which are algebraically equivalent to those of Larmor and Lorentz and gave them the modern form ({{equationNote|4b}}):&lt;ref group=R&gt;Poincaré (1905), p. 1505&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}x^{\prime} &amp; =kl(x+\varepsilon t)\\
y^{\prime} &amp; =ly\\
z^{\prime} &amp; =lz\\
t' &amp; =kl(t+\varepsilon x)\\
k &amp; =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\varepsilon^{2}}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;.

Apparently Poincaré was unaware of Larmor's contributions, because he only mentioned Lorentz and therefore used for the first time the name "Lorentz transformation".&lt;ref&gt;Pais (1982), Chap. 6c&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katzir (2005), 280–288&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré set the speed of light to unity, pointed out the group characteristics of the transformation by setting ''l''=1, and modified/corrected Lorentz's derivation of the equations of electrodynamics in some details in order to fully satisfy the principle of relativity, ''i.e.'' making them fully Lorentz covariant.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1981), Chap. 1.14&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1905 (published in January 1906)&lt;ref group=R&gt;Poincaré (1905/06), pp. 129ff&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré showed in detail how the transformations and electrodynamic equations are a consequence of the [[principle of least action]]; he demonstrated in more detail the group characteristics of the transformation, which he called [[Lorentz group]], and he showed that the combination &lt;math&gt;x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-c^{2}t^{2}&lt;/math&gt; is invariant. He noticed that the Lorentz transformation is merely a rotation in four-dimensional space about the origin by introducing &lt;math&gt;ct\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; as a fourth imaginary coordinate, and he used an early form of [[four-vector]]s.

==={{anchor|Einstein}} Einstein (1905) – Special relativity===

On June 30, 1905 (published September 1905) Einstein published what is now called [[special relativity]] and gave a new derivation of the transformation, which was based only on the principle on relativity and the principle of the constancy of the speed of light. While Lorentz considered "local time" to be a mathematical stipulation device for explaining the Michelson-Morley experiment, Einstein showed that the coordinates given by the Lorentz transformation were in fact the inertial coordinates of relatively moving frames of reference. For quantities of first order in ''v/c'' this was also done by Poincaré in 1900, while Einstein derived the complete transformation by this method. Unlike Lorentz and Poincaré who still distinguished between real time in the aether and apparent time for moving observers, Einstein showed that the transformations concern the nature of space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1981), Chap. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pais (1982), Kap. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darrigol (2005), Chap. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The notation for this transformation is equivalent to Poincaré's of 1905 and ({{equationNote|4b}}), except that Einstein didn't set the speed of light to unity:&lt;ref group=R&gt;Einstein (1905), p. 902&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\tau &amp; =\beta\left(t-\frac{v}{V^{2}}x\right)\\
\xi &amp; =\beta(x-vt)\\
\eta &amp; =y\\
\zeta &amp; =z\\
\beta &amp; =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{v}{V}\right)^{2}}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Einstein also defined the velocity addition formula ({{equationNote|4c}}) (which also has been done by Poincaré in May 1905 in unpublished letters to Lorentz):&lt;ref group=R&gt;Einstein (1905), § 5&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}x=\frac{w_{\xi}+v}{1+\frac{vw_{\xi}}{V^{2}}}t,\ y=\frac{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{v}{V}\right)^{2}}}{1+\frac{vw_{\xi}}{V^{2}}}w_{\eta}t\\
U^{2}=\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^{2},\ w^{2}=w_{\xi}^{2}+w_{\eta}^{2},\ \alpha=\operatorname{arctg}\frac{w_{y}}{w_{x}}\\
U=\frac{\sqrt{\left(v^{2}+w^{2}+2vw\cos\alpha\right)-\left(\frac{vw\sin\alpha}{V}\right)^{2}}}{1+\frac{vw\cos\alpha}{V^{2}}}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

=== {{anchor|Minkowski}} Minkowski (1907–1908) – Spacetime ===

The work on the principle of relativity by Lorentz, Einstein, [[Max Planck|Planck]], together with Poincaré's four-dimensional approach, were further elaborated and combined with the [[hyperboloid model]] by [[Hermann Minkowski]] in 1907 and 1908.&lt;ref group=R&gt;Minkowski (1907/15), pp. 927ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=R&gt;Minkowski (1907/08), pp. 53ff&lt;/ref&gt; Minkowski particularly reformulated electrodynamics in a four-dimensional way ([[Minkowski spacetime]]).&lt;ref&gt;Walter (1999a)&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, he wrote ''x, y, z, it'' in the form ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''. By defining &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; as the angle of rotation around the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis, the Lorentz transformation assumes a form (with ''c''=1) in agreement with ({{equationNote|2b}}):&lt;ref group=R name=mink1&gt;Minkowski (1907/08), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}x'_{1} &amp; =x_{1}\\
x'_{2} &amp; =x_{2}\\
x'_{3} &amp; =x_{3}\cos i\psi+x_{4}\sin i\psi\\
x'_{4} &amp; =-x_{3}\sin i\psi+x_{4}\cos i\psi\\
\cos i\psi &amp; =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-q^{2}}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Even though Minkowski used the imaginary number iψ, he for once&lt;ref group=R name=mink1 /&gt; directly used the [[tangens hyperbolicus]] in the equation for velocity

:&lt;math&gt;-i\tan i\psi=\frac{e^{\psi}-e^{-\psi}}{e^{\psi}+e^{-\psi}}=q&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\psi=\frac{1}{2}\ln\frac{1+q}{1-q}&lt;/math&gt;.

Minkowski's expression can also by written as ψ=atanh(q) and was later called [[rapidity]]. He also wrote the Lorentz transformation in matrix form equivalent to ({{equationNote|2a}}) &lt;math&gt;(n=3)&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref group=R&gt;Minkowski (1907/08), pp. 65–66, 81–82&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only the quadratic form ''λ(δx&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+δy&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+δz&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+δu&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)'', but also [[Maxwells equations]] are covariant with respect to these transformations, irrespective of the choice of λ. These variants of conformal or Lie sphere transformations were called [[spherical wave transformation]]s by Bateman.&lt;ref group=R&gt;Bateman (1909/10), pp. 223ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=R&gt;Cunningham (1909/10), pp. 77ff&lt;/ref&gt; However, this covariance is restricted to certain areas such as electrodynamics, whereas the totality of natural laws in inertial frames is covariant under the [[Lorentz group]].&lt;ref group=R&gt;Klein (1910)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, by setting λ=1 the Lorentz group {{nowrap|SO(3,1)}} can be seen as a 10-parameter subgroup of the 15-parameter spacetime conformal group {{nowrap|Con(3,1)}}.

Bateman (1910/12)&lt;ref&gt;Bateman (1910/12), pp. 358–359&lt;/ref&gt; also alluded to the identity between the [[#Laguerre|Laguerre inversion]] and the Lorentz transformations. In general, the isomorphism between the Laguerre group and the Lorentz group was pointed out by [[Élie Cartan]] (1912, 1915/55),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref group=R&gt;Cartan (1912), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Poincaré]] (1912/21)&lt;ref group=R&gt;Poincaré (1912/21), p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

=== {{anchor|Herglotz1}} Herglotz (1909/10) – Möbius transformation ===

Following [[#Klein2|Klein (1889–1897) and Fricke &amp; Klein (1897)]] concerning the Cayley absolute, hyperbolic motion and its transformation, [[Gustav Herglotz]] (1909/10) classified the one-parameter Lorentz transformations as loxodromic, hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic. The general case (on the left) equivalent to Lorentz transformation ({{equationNote|6a}}) and the hyperbolic case (on the right) equivalent to Lorentz transformation ({{equationNote|3c}}) are as follows:&lt;ref group=R&gt;Herglotz (1909/10), pp. 404-408&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left.\begin{matrix}z_{1}^{2}+z_{2}^{2}+z_{3}^{2}-z_{4}^{2}=0\\
z_{1}=x,\ z_{2}=y,\ z_{3}=z,\ z_{4}=t\\
Z=\frac{z_{1}+iz_{2}}{z_{4}-z_{3}}=\frac{x+iy}{t-z},\ Z'=\frac{x'+iy'}{t'-z'}\\
Z=\frac{\alpha Z'+\beta}{\gamma Z'+\delta}
\end{matrix}\right|\begin{matrix}Z=Z'e^{\vartheta}\\
\begin{align}x &amp; =x', &amp; t-z &amp; =(t'-z')e^{\vartheta}\\
y &amp; =y', &amp; t+z &amp; =(t'+z')e^{-\vartheta}
\end{align}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

==={{anchor|Varicak}} Varićak (1910) – Weierstrass coordinates===

Following [[#Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld (1909)]], hyperbolic functions were used by [[Vladimir Varićak]] in several papers starting from 1910, who represented the equations of special relativity on the basis of [[hyperbolic geometry]] in terms of Weierstrass coordinates. For instance, by setting ''l=ct'' and ''v/c=tanh(u)'' with ''u'' as rapidity he wrote the Lorentz transformation in agreement with ({{equationNote|3b}}):&lt;ref group=R&gt;Varićak (1910), p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}l' &amp; =-x\sinh u+l\cosh u,\\
x' &amp; =x\cosh u-l\sinh u,\\
y' &amp; =y,\quad z'=z,\\
\cosh u &amp; =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^{2}}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Varićak also related the velocity addition to the [[hyperbolic law of cosines]]:&lt;ref group=R&gt;Varićak (1910), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\operatorname{ch}{u}=\operatorname{ch}{u_{1}}\operatorname ch{u_{2}}+\operatorname{sh}{u_{1}}\operatorname{sh}{u_{2}}\cos\alpha\\
\operatorname{ch}{u_{i}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{v_{i}}{c}\right)^{2}}},\ \operatorname{sh}{u_{i}}=\frac{v_{i}}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{v_{i}}{c}\right)^{2}}}\\
v=\sqrt{v_{1}^{2}+v_{2}^{2}-\left(\frac{v_{1}v_{2}}{c}\right)^{2}}\ \left(a=\frac{\pi}{2}\right)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Subsequently, other authors such as [[E. T. Whittaker]] (1910) or [[Alfred Robb]] (1911, who coined the name rapidity) used similar expressions, which are still used in modern textbooks.&lt;ref name=rind /&gt;

=== {{anchor|Ignatowski}} Ignatowski (1910) ===

While earlier derivations and formulations of the Lorentz transformation relied from the outset on optics, electrodynamics, or the invariance of the speed of light, [[Vladimir Ignatowski]] (1910) showed that it is possible to use the principle of relativity (and related [[Group theory|group theoretical]] principles) alone, in order to derive the following transformation between two inertial frames:&lt;ref group=R&gt;Ignatowski (1910), pp. 973–974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=R&gt;Ignatowski (1910/11), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}dx' &amp; =p\ dx-pq\ dt\\
dt' &amp; =-pqn\ dx+p\ dt\\
p &amp; =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-q^{2}n}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The variable ''n'' can be seen as a space-time constant whose value has to be determined by experiment or taken from a known physical law such as electrodynamics. For that purpose, Ignatowski used the above-mentioned Heaviside ellipsoid representing a contraction of electrostatic fields by ''x''/γ in the direction of motion. It can be seen that this is only consistent with Ignatowski's transformation when ''n=1/c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting in ''p''=γ and the Lorentz transformation ({{equationNote|4b}}). With ''n''=0, no length changes arise and the Galilean transformation follows. Ignatowski's method was further developed and improved by [[Philipp Frank]] and [[Hermann Rothe]] (1911, 1912),&lt;ref group=R&gt;Frank &amp; Rothe (1911), pp. 825ff; (1912), p. 750ff.&lt;/ref&gt; with various authors developing similar methods in subsequent years.&lt;ref name=baccetti&gt;Baccetti (2011), see references 1–25 therein.&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Noether}} Noether (1910), Klein (1910), Conway (1911), Silberstein (1911) – Quaternions===

In an appedix to Klein's and Sommerfeld's "Theory of the top" (1910), [[Fritz Noether]] showed how to formulate hyperbolic rotations using biquaternions with &lt;math&gt;\omega=\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, which he also related to the speed of light by setting ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. He concluded that this is the principal ingredient for a rational representation of the group of Lorentz transformations equivalent to ({{equationNote|7a}}):&lt;ref group=R&gt;Noether (1910), pp. 939–943&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}V=\frac{Q_{1}vQ_{2}}{T_{1}T_{2}}\\

\end{align}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Besides citing quaternion related standard works such as [[#Cayley3|Cayley (1854)]], Noether referred to the entries in Klein's encyclopedia by [[Eduard Study]] (1899) and the French version by [[Élie Cartan]] (1908).&lt;ref&gt;Cartan &amp; Study (1908), sections 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; Cartan's version contains a description of Study's [[dual number]]s, Clifford's biquaternions (including the choice &lt;math&gt;\omega=\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; for hyperbolic geometry), and Clifford algebra, with references to [[#Stephanos|Stephanos (1883)]], [[#Buchheim|Buchheim (1884/85)]], [[#Vahlen|Vahlen (1901/02)]] and others.

Already in 1908, while describing "Drehstreckungen" (orthogonal substitutions in terms of rotations leaving invariant a quadratic form up to a factor) by using [[#Cayley3|Cayley's (1854)]] quaternion multiplication formalism, [[Felix Klein]] pointed out that the modern principle of relativity as provided by Minkowski is essentially only the consequent application of such Drehstreckungen, even though he didn't provide details.&lt;ref group=R&gt;Klein (1908), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Citing Noether, in August 1910 Klein published the following quaternion substitutions forming the group of Lorentz transformations:&lt;ref group=R&gt;Klein (1910), p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

Independently, also [[Arthur W. Conway]] in February 1911 succeeded in combining quaternions and relativity (where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the force and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; the charge)&lt;ref group=R&gt;Conway (1911), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Euler's gap==
In pursuing the history in years before Lorentz enunciated his expressions, one looks to the essence of the concept. In mathematical terms, Lorentz transformations are [[squeeze mapping]]s, the linear transformations that turn a square into a rectangles of the same area. Before Euler, the squeezing was studied as [[Gregoire de Saint-Vincent|quadrature of the hyperbola]] and led to the [[hyperbolic sector|hyperbolic logarithm]]. In 1748 Euler issued his [[precalculus]] [[textbook]] where the number [[e (mathematical constant)|e]] is exploited for trigonometry in the [[unit circle]]. The first volume of [[Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite]] had no diagrams, allowing teachers and students to draw their own illustrations.

There is a gap in Euler's text where Lorentz transformations arise. A feature of [[natural logarithm]] is its interpretation as area in [[hyperbolic sector]]s. In relativity the classical concept of [[velocity]] is replaced with [[rapidity]], a [[hyperbolic angle]] concept built on hyperbolic sectors. A Lorentz transformation is a [[hyperbolic rotation]] which preserves differences of rapidity, just as the [[circular sector]] area is preserved with a circular rotation. Euler’s gap is the lack of hyperbolic angle and [[hyperbolic function]]s, later developed by [[Johann H. Lambert]]. Euler described some [[transcendental function]]s: exponetiation and [[circular function]]s. He used the exponential series &lt;math&gt;\sum_0^{\infty} x^n /n! .&lt;/math&gt; With the [[imaginary unit]] i&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = – 1, and splitting the series into even and odd terms, he obtained
:&lt;math&gt;e^{ix} = \sum_0^{\infty} (ix)^{2n}/(2n)! \ + \ \sum_0^{\infty} (ix)^{2n+1}/(2n + 1)! =&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \sum_0^{\infty} (-1)^n x^{2n} / 2n! + i \sum_0^{\infty} (-1)^n x^{2n+1}/(2n+1)! \ = \ \cos x + i \sin x .&lt;/math&gt;
This development misses the alternative:
:&lt;math&gt;e^x = \cosh x + \sinh x&lt;/math&gt; (even and odd terms), and
:&lt;math&gt;e^{jx} = \cosh x + j \sinh x \quad (j^2 = +1) &lt;/math&gt; which parametrizes the [[unit hyperbola]].
Here Euler could have noted [[split-complex number]]s along with [[complex number]]s.

For physics, one space dimension is insufficient. But to extend split-complex arithmetic to four dimensions leads to [[hyperbolic quaternion]]s, and opens the door to [[abstract algebra]]’s 
[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Abstract_Algebra/Hypercomplex_numbers hypercomplex numbers]. Reviewing the expressions of Lorentz and Einstein, one observes that the [[Lorentz factor]] is an [[algebraic function]] of velocity. For readers uncomfortable with transcendental functions cosh and sinh, algebraic functions may be more to their liking.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30759">'''Human rights movement''' refers to a [[nongovernmental]] [[social movement]] engaged in activism related to the issues of [[human rights]]. The foundations of the global human rights movement involve resistance to: colonialism, imperialism, slavery, racism, apartheid, patriarchy, and oppression of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Clapham, ''Human Rights'' (2007), p. 19. "In fact, the modern civil rights movement and the complex normative international framework have grown out of a number of transnational and widespread movements. Human rights were invoked and claimed in the contexts of anti-colonialism, anti-imperialism, anti-slavery, anti-apartheid, anti-racism, and feminist and indigenous struggles everywhere."&lt;/ref&gt;

A key principle of the human rights movement is its appeal to [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]]: the idea that all human beings should struggle in [[solidarity]] for a common set of basic conditions that has to be followed by all.&lt;ref&gt;Clapham, ''Human Rights'' (2007), p. 19–20. "...the sense of solidarity amongst those who believe they are the victims of a human rights violation can transcend class, gender, and other distinctions. This sense of connectedness is critical to understanding the changing world of human rights."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|History of human rights}}
Human rights activism predates the 20th century, and includes, for example, the [[abolitionism|anti-slavery movement]].&lt;ref name="Leonard2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clapham, ''Human Rights'' (2007), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Historical movements were usually concerned with a limited set of issues, and they were more local than global.&lt;ref name="Neier2012-7-9"/&gt; One account identifies the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907#Hague Convention of 1899|1899 Hague Convention]] as a starting point for the idea that humans have rights independent of the states that control them.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), pp. 40–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The activities of the [[International Federation for Human Rights]] (originally the International Labor Organization)—founded in France by the international labor movement in the 1920s—can be seen as a precursor to the modern movements.&lt;ref name="Neier2012-7-9"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; This organization was quickly embraced by the United States and European powers, perhaps as a way to counteract the [[Bolshevik]] call for global solidarity among workers.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-colonialism===
[[File:MutilatedChildrenFromCongo.jpg|thumb|300px|Human rights activists circulated images of mutilated Congolese children among concerned Europeans and Americans, pressuring the Belgium government to make political reforms]]
Another major global human rights movement grew out of [[Anti-colonialism|resistance to colonialism]]. The [[Congo Reform Association]], founded in 1904, has also been described as a foundational modern human rights movement. This group used photographs to document terror wrought by Belgians in the course of demanding rubber production in the Congo. These photographs were passed among sympathetic Europeans and Americans, including [[E. D. Morel|Edmund Morel]], [[Joseph Conrad]], and [[Mark Twain]]—who [[King Leopold's Soliloquy|wrote satirically as King Leopold]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...oh well, the pictures get sneaked around everywhere, in spite of all we can do to ferret them out and suppress them. Ten thousand pulpits and ten thousand presses are saying the good word for me all the time and placidly and convincingly denying the mutilations. Then that trivial little kodak, that a child can carry in its pocket, gets up, uttering never a word, and knocks them dumb!&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Twain]], ''[[King Leopold's Soliloquy]]'', quoted in: Bruce Michelson, ''Printer's Devil: Mark Twain and the American Publishing Revolution'', University of California Press, {{ISBN|9780520247598}}, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The photos and subsequent literature triggered international outrage at Belgian crimes committed against the Congolese.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Sliwinski, "[http://tps.jkdweb.biz/sites/default/files/uploads/Sliwinski_Kodak_Congo.pdf The Childhood of Human Rights: The Kodak on the Congo]", ''Journal of Visual Culture'' 5(3), 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the century went on, African Americans including [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Walter Francis White|Walter White]], and Paul Robeson joined with leaders of the [[African diaspora]] (from Haiti, Liberia, the Philippines, and elsewhere) to make a global demand for basic rights.&lt;ref&gt;Von Eschen, ''Race Against Empire'' (1997), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Skretny&gt;John David Skretny, "The effect of the Cold War on African-American civil rights: America and the world audience, 1945–1968", ''Theory and Society'' 27(2), 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the origins of this movement were multifaceted (owing strength both to the capitalist [[Marcus Garvey]] and to the more left-wing [[African Blood Brotherhood]]), a definitive moment of international solidarity came after [[Second Italo–Ethiopian War|Italy's annexation of Ethiopia]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Von Eschen, ''Race Against Empire'' (1997), pp. 10–11. "The Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1935 marked an especially critical moment in the articulation of diaspora thought and politics. Paul Robeson claimed it was a watershed for black American consciousness, since it exposed 'the parallel between [black American] interests and those of oppressed peoples abroad.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II and the United Nations===
In the [[aftermath of World War II]], the Pan-Africanist contingent played a major role in causing the United Nations to explicitly protect "human rights" in its founding documents. Du Bois compared colonies across the world to ghettos in the United States and called for a world document affirming the human rights of all people.&lt;ref name="Skretny"/&gt;

Representatives of small countries (particularly from Latin America), as well as Du Bois and other activists, were unhappy with the version of human rights envisioned for the UN Charter at [[Dumbarton Oaks]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Du Bois stated at the time that, evidently, "the only way to human equality is through the philanthropy of the masters".&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the US government supported powerful domestic organizations willing to promote its concept of human rights, such as the [[American Bar Association]] and the [[American Jewish Committee]]. These organizations won public approval of the United Nations and the human rights concept.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of human rights was indeed built into [[United Nations]] with institutions such as the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Active diplomacy by Latin American countries was instrumental to the process of promoting these ideas and drafting the relevant agreements. As a result of this pressure, more human rights language was adopted at the 1945 [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|San Francisco Conference]] to create the UN Charter.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 118. "These proposals were reintroduced in San Francisco during the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Latin America's significant intellectual production supporting human rights is a major reason the region has been called 'the forgotten crucible' of universal human rights. Latin American jurisprudence was particularly well suited to bridging cultural divides in human rights by linking civil and political rights with economic and social rights."&lt;/ref&gt; Revelations about the [[Holocaust]], followed by the [[Nuremberg Trials]], also had a major influence on the movement,&lt;ref name="Neier2012-2-3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Langley1999"/&gt; particularly among Jewish and Christian lobbying groups.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Some NGO's represented the UN charter as a victory for the human rights movement, while other activists argued that it paid lipservice to human rights while basically serving the interests of the great powers.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), pp. 136–138. "A few activists, in particular those whose agenda focused on racial equality and decolonization, were dismayed by the results of San Francisco. The NAACP and allied groups, which had invested significant time, resources, and hopes in using the global forum to highlight the evils of entrenched racism inside the United States and internationally, were bitterly disappointed at the outcome. To no avail, they criticized the failure to dent the vastly unequal power relations operating both between states and within their borders. Rayford Logan, civil rights activist and chair of the history department at Howard University, characterized the human rights articles in the Charter as a 'tragic joke'. But these were minority voices. Just as Roosevelt anticipated, the NGO consultants were thrilled with the role they had played in establishing the organization and fanned out across the country to spread the good news."&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the [[Cold War]], the "human rights" concept was used to promote the ideological agendas of the superpowers.&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet Union]] argued that people in colonized lands around the world had been exploited by Western powers. A large percentage of [[Soviet propaganda]] to the [[Third World]] centered on charges of racism and human rights violations. The United States countered with its own propaganda, describing its own society as free and the Soviet Union's as unfree. Human rights language became an international standard, which could be used by great powers or by people's movements to make demands.&lt;ref name=Skretny/&gt;

===Global human rights struggles===
Within the United States, participants in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] called for human rights in addition to civil rights. Du Bois, the [[National Negro Congress]] (NNC), the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), the [[Civil Rights Congress]] (CRC), and other activists, soon began charging the U.S. with human rights violations at the U.N. In 1951, Du Bois, [[William L. Patterson|William Patterson]] and the CRC presented a document called "[[We Charge Genocide]]" which accused the US of complicity with ongoing systematic violence against [[African American]]s.&lt;ref name=Skretny/&gt;

[[An Appeal for Human Rights]], published by Atlanta students in 1960, is cited as a key moment in beginning the wave of [[nonviolent direct action]]s that swept the [[American South]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward A. Hatfield, "[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-3615 Atlanta Sit-ins]", ''The New Georgia Encyclopedia'', 28 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, less than a year before he was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|assassinated]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] began to argue that the concept of "civil rights" was laden with isolating, individualistic [[Capitalism|capitalist]] values. He said: "It is necessary for us to realize that we have moved from the era of civil rights to the era of human rights. When you deal with human rights you are not dealing with something clearly defined in the Constitution. They are rights that are clearly defined by the mandates of a humanitarian concern."&lt;ref&gt;Sam Trumbore, "[http://blog.timesunion.com/trumbore/from-civil-rights-to-human-rights-kings-legacy-for-us/986/ From Civil Rights to Human Rights, King’s Legacy For Us]", ''Times Union'', 15 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; For King, who began to organize the multi-racial [[Poor People's Campaign]] at the end of his life, human rights required [[economic justice]] in addition to [[de jure]] equality.&lt;ref&gt;Tomas F. Jackson, ''From Civil Rights to Human Rights: Martin Luther King, Jr., And the Struggle for Economic Justice'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007. {{ISBN|9780812239690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[decolonization of Africa]] and [[Decolonization of Asia|of Asia]], former colonies gained majority status in the UN's Commission on Human Rights, and focused their attention on global [[white supremacy]] and [[economic inequality]]—in doing so, choosing to admit other types of human rights abuses. Some of these nations argued that focusing on civil rights, as opposed to human rights, was a privilege available only to the wealthy nations that had benefited from colonialism.&lt;ref name=Skretny/&gt; Demands for human rights in the [[Third World]] increased throughout the 1960s, even as the global superpowers turned their attention elsewhere.&lt;ref name=TsutsuiWotipka&gt;Kiyoteru Tsutsui and Christine Min Wotipka, "Global Civil Society and the International Human Rights Movement: Citizen Participation in Human Rights International Nongovernmental Organization", ''Social Forces'' 83(2), 2004; accessed [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3598341 via JStor], DOI: 10.1353/sof.2005.0022.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes in the 1970s===
Since the 1970s the human rights movement has played an increasingly important role on the international scene.&lt;ref name="Neier2012-2-3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H.)Bertucci1996"/&gt; Although government support for human rights decreased, international organizations increased in strength and number.&lt;ref name=TsutsuiWotipka/&gt; Some of the events of the 1970s, which gave global prominence to the human movements issue, included the abuses of Chilean [[Augusto Pinochet]] and American [[Richard Nixon]] administrations; the signing of the [[Helsinki Accords]] (1975) between [[Western world|the West]] and the [[USSR]]; the [[Soweto riots]] in [[South Africa]]; awarding of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] to [[Amnesty International]] (1977); and the emergence of the [[Democracy Wall]] movement in China.&lt;ref name="H.)Bertucci1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neier2012-3-4"/&gt; Nixon was succeeded by the [[Jimmy Carter]] administration, much more supportive of the human rights issues.

Pressure from the international human rights movement brought human rights increasingly to the political agenda of numerous countries and diplomatic negotiations.&lt;ref name="H.)Bertucci1996"/&gt; As the issue of human rights became important for [[dissidents]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]] ([[Human rights movement in the Soviet Union|Soviet human rights movement]], [[Charter 77]], [[Workers' Defence Committee]]), this period also saw a growing [[framing (sociology)|reframing]] of the struggle between the West and USSR from the economic terms ("[[communism]] versus [[free market]]") into a struggle for human rights ("[[totalitarianism]] versus [[liberty]]").&lt;ref name="Neier2012-13"/&gt; Since the end of the [[Cold War]], the issues of human rights have been present in a number of major political and military conflicts, debated by global public opinion, from [[Kosovo]] to [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] and [[Darfur]].&lt;ref name="Neier2012-17"/&gt;

Originally, most international human rights organizations came from France and the UK; since the 1970s American organizations moved beyond rights for Americans to partake in the international scene, and around the turn of the century, as noted by Neier, "the movement became so global in character that it is no longer possible to ascribe leadership to any particular [national or regional] segment".&lt;ref name="Neier2012-10-11"/&gt; However, others, like [[Bonny Ibhawoh|Ibhawoh]], point out that there still is a gap between regions, particularly as most of the international human rights movement organizations are located in the [[global North]], and thus continuous concerns are raised about their understanding of the situations in the [[global South]].&lt;ref name="BellCoicaud2006"/&gt;

===Since the 1990s===
The global human rights movement has become more expansive since the 1990s, including greater representation of women's rights and economic justice as part of the human rights umbrella. [[Economic, social and cultural rights|Economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights]] gained new prominence.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson and Dorsey, ''New Rights Advocacy'' (2008), p. 14. "Since the mid-1990s the human rights movement has begun to take seriously the economic and social rights guaranteed in the international human rights covenants; development and human rights NGOs have joined in human rights–driven social movements for food, health, education, water, and other rights, often challenging development orthodoxy."&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates for women's human rights (sometimes identifying as part of the [[feminist movement]]), criticized the early human rights movement for focusing on male concerns and artificially excluding women's issues from the [[public sphere]]. Women's rights have nevertheless gained prominence in the international human rights movement, particularly insofar as they include protection from [[gender-based violence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charlotte Bunch]], "Transforming Human Rights From a Feminist Perspective", in ''Women's Rights, Human Rights'', (1995) ed. Stone &amp; Wolper.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Latin America]], the issue of women's human rights intersects with the struggle against authoritarian governments. In many cases (see: the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]]) women's groups were some of the most prominent advocates of human rights in general.&lt;ref name=Friedman&gt;Elisabeth Friedman, "Women's Human Rights: The Emergence of a Movement", in ''Women's Rights, Human Rights'', (1995) ed. Stone &amp; Wolper.&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream acceptance of women's human rights within the international human rights movement has increased since 1989.&lt;ref name=Friedman/&gt;

The authority of the United Nations human rights framework diminished in the 1990s, partly due to the emphasis on economic liberalization that followed the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson and Dorsey, ''New Rights Advocacy'' (2008), p. 51. "The 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna was expected by some to be a celebration of the post–cold war era, the new freedom of the United Nations to operate in a less politicized international environment, and NGO human rights successes. Instead it marked a watershed moment for the integrity of the human rights system, as NGOs battled a coalition of governments determined to undermine the principle of the universality of human rights standards and weaken the UN human rights system. [...] The challenge to shore up the fundamental concept of universality of rights was compounded by shifts in the foreign policy priorities of Western governments. A new Democratic administration in the United States made promoting free-market democracies, rather than human rights, its top priority, resulting in human rights regressions, including the delinking of trade and aid from human rights guarantees (Mann 1999)."&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s also saw a call to "defend the defenders" of human rights—to protect human rights activists from violence and repression.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson and Dorsey, ''New Rights Advocacy'' (2008), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, there has been an increase in the number of attacks on the activists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement has come to a standstill as individuals continue to push for liberation but are unable to report their findings out of fear of harm or death. The number of female activists has been growing since the beginning of the Feminist movement however, there have been increased number of attacks on women. Recently, the Taliban targeted the female activists to send a message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[internet]] has expanded the power of the human rights movement by improving communication between activists in different physical locations.&lt;ref&gt;Halpin and Hoskins,  ''Human Rights and the Internet'' (2000), pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as mediated mobilization. Individuals who are using their voices to communicate about the injustices are now able to communicate with like minded people who use their voices through participatory journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The human rights movement has historically focused on abuses by states, and some have argued that it has not attended closely enough to the actions of corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), p. xix. "...business corporations (especially transnational ones) are often more powerful than states, and therefore enjoy the capacity to promote or undermine the rights and well-being of individuals and groups. Yet, the human rights movement, as it initially developed, did not seek to make business corporations accountable for human rights abuses, such as child labor, business-supported political repression, environmental degradation, and sexual harassment..."&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, some first steps were taken towards holding corporations accountable for human rights abuses. For example, the Parliament of Britain approved a resolution to censure [[British Petroleum]] for funding Colombian death squads.&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues and activities==
[[File:United Workers picketers.jpg|thumb|270px|[[United Workers]] demonstrating for human rights and fair development in Baltimore's [[Inner Harbor]].]]
The international human rights movement is concerned with issues such as deprivation of life and liberty, deprivation of the right of [[free speech|free and peaceful expressions]], gatherings and worship,&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; equal treatment regardless of individual background, and opposition to unjust and cruel practices such as [[torture]].&lt;ref name="Neier2012-2-3"/ 
Other issues include opposition to the death penalty&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), p. 41, 256.&lt;/ref&gt; and to child labor.&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the human rights movement is local in nature, concerned with human rights violations in their own countries, but they rely on an international network of support.&lt;ref name="Neier2012-11"/&gt; The international nature of the movement allows local activists to broadcast their concerns, sometimes generating international pressure on their home government.&lt;ref name=TsutsuiWotipka/&gt; The movement generally espouses the principle that sovereignty ends where human rights begin. This principle justifies intervention across borders to rectify perceived violations.&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The human rights movement is also credited with supplying local activists with a vocabulary to use in support of their claims.&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;[[David Kennedy (jurist)|David Kennedy]], "[http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/dkennedy/publications/humanrights.pdf The International Human Rights Movement: Part of the Problem?]" 15 ''Harvard Human Rights Journal'' 101, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations and criticism==
One major schism within the international human rights movement has been between NGOs and activists from the [[First World|First]] and [[Third World|Third]] Worlds. Critics of the mainstream movement have argued that it suffers from systemic biases and is unwilling to confront inequality on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Langley, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights Issues since 1945'' (1999), p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, some critique the role of neoliberal capitalism in creating economic conditions that engender 'human rights violations', arguing that the dominant human rights movement is blind to these dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 325–326.&lt;/ref&gt; (''See also:'' [[structural adjustment]].) [[Makau W. Mutua|Makau Mutua]] has written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As currently constituted and deployed, the human rights movement will ultimately fail because it is perceived as an alien ideology in non-Western societies. The movement does not deeply resonate in the cultural fabrics of non-Western states, except among hypocritical elites steeped in Western ideas. In order ultimately to prevail, the human rights movement must be moored in the cultures of all peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[[Makau W. Mutua|Makau Mutua]], ''Human Rights: A Political and Cultural Critique'' (2002), quoted in Clapham, ''Human Rights'' (2007), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[David Kennedy (jurist)|David Kennedy]] has criticized a tendency of the international human rights movement to "treat human rights as an object of devotion rather than calculation", arguing that human rights language is vague and may impede [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] assessments of a situation. Kennedy also argues that this vocabulary can be "misused, distorted, or co-opted", and that framing issues in terms of human rights may narrow the field of possibility and exclude other narratives.&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt; Others have also critiqued the movement and its language as vague.&lt;ref&gt;Normand and Zaidi, ''Human Rights at the UN'' (2008), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that the human rights movement has a tendency to subtly debase people by portraying them as victims of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Clapham, ''Human Rights'' (2007), pp. 160–161. "Some critics argue that human rights organizations may tend to generate a narrative that reinforces images of helpless victims oppressed by an alien culture; in turn, this could be said to continue imperialism by other means."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
Particularly since the 1970s, the international human rights movement has been mediated by [[nongovernmental organization]]s (NGOs).&lt;ref name=TsutsuiWotipka/&gt;

Major international human rights organizations include [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref name="Neier2012-186"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neier2012-204"/&gt;

Historically, the influence of the [[International Federation for Human Rights]] is seen as highly important on the movement.&lt;ref name="Neier2012-7-9"/&gt;

The creation of the [[International Criminal Court]] at the turn of the 21st century is seen as another achievement of the international human rights activists.&lt;ref name="Neier2012-18"/&gt;

'''Ilse Koch''' ({{IPA-de|kɔx|lang}}; [[née]] '''Margarete Ilse Köhler'''; 22 September 1906 – 1 September 1967, known as the '''Witch of Buchenwald''') was the wife of [[Karl-Otto Koch]], [[commandant]] of the [[Nazi concentration camp]]s [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]] (1937–1941) and [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek]] (1941–1943). In 1947, she became one of the first prominent [[Nazi]]s tried by the [[U.S. military]].

After the trial received worldwide media attention, survivor accounts of her actions resulted in other authors describing her abuse of prisoners as sadistic, and the image of her as "the concentration camp murderess" was current in post-war [[Germany|German]] society.&lt;ref name="Przyrembel" /&gt; 

She was accused of taking souvenirs from the skin of murdered inmates with distinctive [[tattoo]]s, although those claims were rejected at both of her trials. She was known as "The Witch of Buchenwald" (''Die Hexe von Buchenwald'') by the inmates because of her cruelty and [[Wiktionary:lascivious#English|lasciviousness]] toward prisoners.

==Early life==
Koch was born in [[Dresden]], Germany, the daughter of a factory foreman. She was known as a polite and happy child in her elementary school. At the age of 15, she entered an [[accountancy]] school. Later, she went to work as a bookkeeping clerk. At the time the economy of Germany had not yet recovered from Germany's defeat in [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. In 1932, she became a member of the rising [[Nazi Party]]. Through some friends in the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], she met [[Karl-Otto Koch]] in 1934, marrying him two years later.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==War crimes==
[[File:Buchenwald Human Remains 74066.jpg|thumb|Buchenwald 16 April 1945. Collection of prisoners' internal organs including two human heads remains (Upper left) and also examples of tattooed skins [Foreground)]]

In 1936, she began working as a guard and secretary at the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] near [[Berlin]], which her fiancé commanded, and was married the same year. In 1937 she came to Buchenwald when her husband was made Commandant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaustchronicle.org/StaticPages/117.html |title=The Holocaust Chronicle |work=1937: Quiet Before the Storm |page=117 |publisher=Holocaustchronicle.org |accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Buchenwald, Koch allegedly engaged in a gruesome experiment, where it was claimed that she ordered selected tattooed prisoners to be murdered and skinned to retrieve the tattooed parts of their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buchenwald.de/1132|title=Lampenschirme aus Menschenhaut? - Gedenkstätte Buchenwald|first=Stiftung Gedenkstätte Buchenwald und|last=Mittelbau-Dora|publisher=buchenwald.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was allegedly done to help a prison doctor, {{illm|Erich Wagner|de|Erich Wagner (Arzt)}}, in his dissertation on tattooing and criminality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxlfeGrIRPc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=795 "The most evil women in history"]. Discovery Channel, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, she built an indoor sports arena, which cost over 250,000 [[reichsmarks]] (approximately $62,500), most of which had been seized from the inmates. In 1941 Karl Otto Koch was transferred to [[Lublin]], where he helped establish the [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek concentration and extermination camp]]. Ilse Koch remained at Buchenwald until 24 August 1943, when she and her husband were arrested on the orders of [[Josias von Waldeck-Pyrmont]], [[SS and Police Leader]] for [[Weimar]], who had supervisory authority over Buchenwald. The charges against the Kochs comprised private enrichment, [[embezzlement]], and the murder of prisoners to prevent them from giving testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Heinz Höhne |last=Höhne |first=Heinz |title=The Order of the Death's Head: A History of the SS |publisher=Penguin Books |year=2000 |isbn=9780141390123}} The author notes the irony that the SS prosecutor, [[Konrad Morgen]], investigated some cover-up murders of inmates in detail while being ignorant of, or willfully ignoring, the industrialized mass murder later alleged to have been going on in the camps further to the east.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ilse Koch was imprisoned until 1944 when she was acquitted for lack of evidence. Her husband was found guilty and [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] by an [[Hauptamt SS-Gericht|SS court]] in [[Munich]], and was executed by firing squad on 5 April 1945 in the court of the camp he once commanded. She went to live with her surviving family in the town of [[Ludwigsburg]], where she was arrested by U.S. authorities on 30 June 1945.

==First trial==
[[File:DachauerProzess.JPG|thumb|Ilse Koch at the U.S. Military Tribunal in [[Dachau]], 1947]]

Koch and 30 other accused were arraigned before the American military court at Dachau (General Military Government Court for the Trial of War Criminals) in 1947. Prosecuting her was future [[United States Court of Claims]] [[United States federal judge|Judge]] [[Robert Lowe Kunzig|Robert L. Kunzig]]. She was charged with "participating in a criminal plan for aiding, abetting and participating in the murders at Buchenwald".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Third Reich |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |year=1991 |page=43 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koch announced in the courtroom that she was eight months pregnant but on 19 August 1947, she was sentenced to life imprisonment for "violation of the laws and customs of war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Yearbook of the European Convention on Human Rights |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mzxf11yq8o8C&amp;pg=PP1 |volume=5 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |year=1963 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Mzxf11yq8o8C&amp;pg=PA126 126–136] |isbn=978-90-247-0949-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reduction of sentence==
Gen. [[Lucius D. Clay]] was the interim military governor of the [[American Zone]] in Germany, and he reduced the judgment to four years' imprisonment on 8 June 1948, after she had served two years of her sentence, on the grounds that "there was no convincing evidence that she had selected inmates for extermination in order to secure tattooed skins, or that she possessed any articles made of human skin".&lt;ref name="Time_1950-12-25"&gt;{{cite journal |title=GERMANY: Very Special Present |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,859084,00.html#ixzz1JwxlL7xG |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=25 December 1950}} {{subscription required |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; News of the reduced sentence did not become public until 16 September 1948, and Clay stood firm despite the ensuing uproar. [[Jean Edward Smith]] reported in his biography ''Lucius D. Clay: An American Life'' that the general maintained that the leather lamp shades were really made out of [[Goatskin (material)|goat skin]]. The book quotes a statement made by Clay years later:

{{quote|There was absolutely no evidence in the trial transcript, other than she was a rather loathsome creature, that would support the death sentence. I suppose I received more abuse for that than for anything else I did in Germany. Some reporter had called her the "Bitch of Buchenwald", had written that she had lamp shades made of human skin in her house. And that was introduced in court, where it was absolutely proven that the lampshades were made out of goatskin. In addition to that, her crimes were primarily against the German people; they were not war crimes against American or Allied prisoners ... Later she was tried by a German court for her crimes and sentenced to life imprisonment. But they had clear jurisdiction. We did not.}}

==Second trial==
Under the pressure of public opinion Koch was re-arrested in 1949 and tried before a [[West German]] court. The hearing opened on 27 November 1950 before the District Court at Augsburg and lasted seven weeks, during which 250 witnesses were heard, including 50 for the defense. Koch collapsed and had to be carried from the court in late December 1950,&lt;ref name="Time_1950-12-25" /&gt; and again on 11 January 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman decides against suicide Life demanded for Ilse Koch |work=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |date=12 January 1951 |page=2 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3DBWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xuUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5602%2C3401594 |accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least four witnesses for the prosecution testified that they had seen Koch choose tattooed prisoners, who were then killed, or had seen or been involved in the process of making [[Lampshades made from human skin|human-skin lampshades]] from tattooed skin.&lt;ref name="Time_1950-12-25" /&gt; However, this charge was dropped by the prosecution when they could not prove lampshades or any other items were actually made from human skin.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ilse Koch is given life term |work=[[Gettysburg Times]] |date=15 January 1951 |page=2 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0IElAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3fQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4254%2C5369899 |accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January 1951, the Court pronounced its verdict, in a 111-page-long decision, for which Koch was not present in court.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; It was concluded that the previous trials in 1944 and 1947 were not a bar to proceedings under the principle of ''[[ne bis in idem]]'', as at the 1944 trial Koch had only been charged with receiving, while in 1947 she had been accused of crimes against foreigners after 1 September 1939, and not with crimes against humanity of which Germans and Austrians had been defendants both before and after that date. She was convicted of charges of incitement to murder, incitement to attempted murder and incitement to the crime of committing grievous bodily harm, and on 15 January 1951 was sentenced to life imprisonment and permanent forfeiture of civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Arthur Lee |title=Die Hexe von Buchenwald: der Fall Ilse Koch |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Slkfbe9ZEHEC&amp;pg=PP1 |publisher=Böhlau Verlag |year=1994 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Slkfbe9ZEHEC&amp;pg=PA146 146] |language=German |isbn=978-3-412-10693-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koch appealed to have the judgment quashed, but the appeal was dismissed on 22 April 1952 by the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court of Justice]]. She later made several petitions for a pardon, all of which were rejected by the Bavarian Ministry of Justice. Koch protested her life sentence, to no avail, to the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|International Human Rights Commission]].&lt;ref name="trial"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scrapbookpages.com/DachauScrapbook/DachauTrials/IlseKoch.html|title=Ilse Koch on trial at Dachau for making human lamp shades at Buchenwald|website=www.scrapbookpages.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Internarrative identity''' is building upon the notion of [[narrative Identity]], the idea that our [[Identity (social science)|identities]] are shaped by the accounts we give of our lives. The central tenet of internarrative identity is that the ability of individuals to shape their lives is extended by multiple [[Autobiography|autobiographical]] narratives with associative principles beyond [[temporality]]. This concept was developed in 1997 by Ajit K. Maan in the central text Internarrative Identity.

==Overview==
While the foundation of Narrative Identity Theory is the holding together of life experiences in a unified structure, Internarrative Identity Theory celebrates what have previously been considered problematic areas of experience - [[Conflict (narrative)|conflict]], [[marginalization]], disruption, [[subversion]], [[Deviationism|deviation]] - as places of possibility for [[self (psychology)|self]] creation.
Internarrative Identity Theory locates the solution of narrative conflict within the problem itself. Existence in-between authoritarian discourses and [[dominant culture]]s enables an extended form of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] wherein a subject is able to undermine traditional associations, assumptions, concepts, and at the same time, create links between otherwise incommensurable [[world view]]s. Rather than being a passive recipient of dominant discourses the Internarrative subject is uniquely able to subvert regulatory identity practices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1276">In [[mathematics]], particularly [[commutative algebra]], an '''invertible module''' is intuitively a [[module (mathematics)|module]] that has an [[inverse element|inverse]] with respect to the [[tensor product]]. Invertible modules form the foundation for the definition of [[invertible sheaf|invertible sheaves]] in [[algebraic geometry]].

Formally, a [[finitely generated module]] ''M'' over a ring ''R'' is said to be invertible if it is locally a [[free module]] of [[rank of a free module|rank]] 1. In other words, &lt;math&gt; M_P\cong R_P &lt;/math&gt; for all [[prime element|primes]] ''P'' of ''R''. Now, if ''M'' is an invertible ''R''-module, then its [[Duality (mathematics)#Dual objects|dual]] {{nowrap|''M''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} Hom(''M'',''R'')}} is its inverse with respect to the tensor product, i.e. &lt;math&gt;M\otimes _R M^*\cong R&lt;/math&gt;.

The theory of invertible modules is closely related to the theory of [[codimension]] one [[algebraic variety|varieties]] including the theory of [[divisor (algebraic geometry)|divisor]]s.

'''Juan Antonio Marichal Sánchez''' (born October 20, 1937&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/maricju01.shtml Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominican]] former professional [[baseball]] player. He played as a right-handed [[pitcher]] in [[Major League Baseball]], most notably for the [[San Francisco Giants]].&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; Marichal was known for his high leg kick, pinpoint control and intimidation tactics, which included aiming pitches directly at the opposing batters' helmets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/aug/23/20040823-011141-7243r/ |title=Juan Marichal took a bat to Roseboro in 1965 fracas |work=[[The Washington Times]] |date=August 23, 2004 |accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marichal also played for the [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] for the final two seasons of his career.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; Although he won more games than any other pitcher during the 1960s, he appeared in only one [[World Series]] game and he was often overshadowed by his contemporaries [[Sandy Koufax]] and [[Bob Gibson]] in post-season awards.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal: He Was Winningest Pitcher of '60s"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zioDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=juan+marichal+baseball+digest&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=juan%20marichal%20baseball%20digest&amp;f=false ''Juan Marichal: He Was Winningest Pitcher of '60s'', by John Lowe, Baseball Digest, August 1998, Vol. 57, No. 8, ISSN 0005-609X]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dzIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=juan+marichal+baseball+digest&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=juan%20marichal%20baseball%20digest&amp;f=false ''Juan Marichal-A Man In Many Shadows'', by Michael R.

==Early life==
Juan Marichal was born on October 20, 1937, in the small farming village of Laguna Verde, [[Dominican Republic]], the youngest of Francisco and Natividad Marichal's four children.&lt;ref name="Marichal13"&gt;Marichal, Freedman, 2011. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  He has two brothers, Gonzalo and Rafael, and a sister, Maria. His father died of an unknown illness when Marichal was three years old.&lt;ref name="Marichal13"/&gt;  His house did not have electricity, but food was plentiful since his family owned a farm.&lt;ref name="Marichal14"&gt;Marichal, Freedman, 2011. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  As a child, Marichal worked on the farm daily and was responsible for taking care of his family's horses, donkeys, and goats.&lt;ref name="Marichal14"/&gt; He lived near the [[Yaque del Norte River]] and often spent time swimming and fishing.&lt;ref name="Marichal20"&gt;Marichal, Freeman, 2011. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  One day while Marichal was playing by the river, he fell unconscious owing to poor digestion and was in a [[coma]] for nine days.&lt;ref name="Marichal21"&gt;Marichal, Freeman, 2011. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  Doctors did not expect him to survive, but he slowly regained consciousness after his family gave him steam baths by doctor's orders.&lt;ref name="Marichal21"/&gt;

His older brother Gonzalo instilled a love of baseball in young Marichal and taught him the fundamentals of pitching, fielding, and batting.&lt;ref name="Marichal19"&gt;Marichal, Freedman, 2011. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  Every weekend, Marichal played the sport with his brother and friends.  For their games, they found [[golf ball]]s and paid the local shoemaker one [[Dominican peso|peso]] to sew thick cloth around the ball to make it the proper size.&lt;ref name="Marichal16"&gt;Marichal, Freedman, 2011. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  They employed branches from a wassama tree for [[Baseball bat|bats]] and canvas tarps for [[Baseball glove|gloves]].&lt;ref name="Marichal16"/&gt;  Among his childhood playmates were the Alou brothers, [[Felipe Alou|Felipe]], [[Jesús Alou|Jesús]], and [[Matty Alou|Matty]], who all later played with Marichal on the [[San Francisco Giants]].&lt;ref name="Marichal16"/&gt; From the age of six, Marichal aspired to become a professional baseball player, but his mother discouraged this, instead urging him to get an education.&lt;ref name="Marichal17"&gt;Marichal, Freedman, 2011. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, there were no players from the Dominican Republic in [[Major League Baseball]], and his goal was viewed to be unrealistic.&lt;ref name="Marichal17"/&gt; At age 11, he briefly held a job cutting sugar cane for the J.W. Tatem Shipping conglomerate.

In 1954, sixteen-year-old Marichal joined a summer league in [[Monte Cristi (Dominican Republic)|Monte Cristi]], playing for a team called Las Flores.&lt;ref name="Marichal19"/&gt; Although he began at shortstop, Marichal switched to pitcher after taking inspiration from Bombo Ramos of the Dominican national team.&lt;ref name="Marichal19"/&gt;  He left high school after being recruited to play for the [[United Fruit Company]] team in 1956.&lt;ref name="Marichal23"&gt;Marichal, Freedman, 2011. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing career==
Marichal's delivery was renowned for one of the fullest windups in modern baseball, with a high kick of his left leg that went nearly vertical (even more so than [[Warren Spahn]]'s delivery).&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal: He Was Winningest Pitcher of '60s"/&gt; Marichal maintained this delivery his entire career, and photographs taken near his retirement show the vertical kick only diminished. The windup was the key to his delivery in that he was consistently able to conceal the type of pitch until it was on its way.

Marichal was discovered by [[Ramfis Trujillo]], the son of late Dominican dictator [[Rafael Leónidas Trujillo]]. Ramfis was the primary sponsor of the [[Dominican Air Force]] Baseball Team (Aviación Dominicana), against which Marichal pitched a 2–1 victory game in his native Monte Cristi. From the very moment the game ended, Marichal was a member of Aviación Dominicana team, enlisted to the Air Force right on the spot by Ramfis's orders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942040-1,00.html "The Dandy Dominican", ''Time'' magazine, June 10, 1966]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Juan Marichal 1962.png|thumb|180px|left|Marichal in 1962]]

Marichal entered the major leagues on July 19, {{Baseball year|1960}} with the [[San Francisco Giants]] as the second native pitcher to come from the Dominican Republic. He made an immediate impression: in his debut, on July 19, [[1960 San Francisco Giants season|1960]] against the [[1960 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]], he  took a [[no hitter]] into the eighth [[inning]] only to surrender a two-[[Out (baseball)|out]] [[Single (baseball)|single]] to [[Clay Dalrymple]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y7EDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=clay+dalrymple+baseball+digest&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Baseball Digest, June 1990, Vol. 49, No. 6, ISSN 0005-609X]&lt;/ref&gt; He ended up with a one-hit shutout, walking one and striking out 12.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SFN/SFN196007190.shtml July 19, 1960 Phillies-Giants box score at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; He started 10 more games that season, finishing at 6–2 with a 2.66 [[earned run average|ERA]].&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He improved his victory totals to 13 and 18 over the following two seasons, respectively, before finally cracking the 20-victory plateau in [[1963 San Francisco Giants season|1963]], when he went 25–8 with 248 [[strikeout]]s and a 2.41 ERA.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He appeared in every All-Star game of the 1960s beginning in 1962.  In May [[1966 in baseball|1966]], he was named [[Major League Baseball Player of the Month Award|NL Player of the Month]] with a 6-0 record, a 0.97 ERA, and 42 SO. On July 14, 1967, he surrendered the 500th Home Run of [[Eddie Mathews]]' career.

Marichal enjoyed similar success through the [[1969 San Francisco Giants season|1969]] season, posting more than 20 victories in every season except [[1967 San Francisco Giants season|1967]], and never posting an ERA higher than 2.76.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He led the league in victories in [[1963 San Francisco Giants season|1963]] and [[1968 San Francisco Giants season|1968]] when he won 26 games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1963-pitching-leaders.shtml 1963 National League Pitching Leaders at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1968-pitching-leaders.shtml 1968 National League Pitching Leaders at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, he also finished in the highest rank of his career in [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player|MVP]] voting, finishing fifth behind [[Bob Gibson]], [[Pete Rose]], [[Willie McCovey]], and [[Curt Flood]].  He and [[Sandy Koufax]] were the only two Major League pitchers in the post-war era (1946–present) to have more than one season of 25 or more wins; both pitchers had three such seasons in their careers.

Marichal won more games during the decade of the 1960s (191) than any other major league pitcher,&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal: He Was Winningest Pitcher of '60s"/&gt; but did not receive any votes for the [[Cy Young Award]] until 1970, when baseball writers started voting for the top three pitchers in each league rather than one per league (or, until 1967, only the top pitcher in MLB). Marichal finished in the top 10 in ERA seven consecutive years, starting in 1963 and culminating in 1969, in which year he led the league.&lt;ref name="1969 National League Pitching Leaders at Baseball Reference"&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1969-pitching-leaders.shtml 1969 National League Pitching Leaders at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; During his career, he also finished in the top 10 in strikeouts six times, top 10 in innings pitched eight times (leading the league twice), and top 10 in [[complete game]]s 10 times, with a career total of 244.&lt;ref name="haft"/&gt; He led the league twice in shutouts, throwing 10 of them in 1965.&lt;ref name="1969 National League Pitching Leaders at Baseball Reference"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1965-pitching-leaders.shtml 1965 National League Pitching Leaders at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marichal exhibited exceptional control. He had 2,303 strikeouts with only 709 walks,&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; a [[strikeout]]-to-walk ratio of 3.25 to 1. This ranks among the top 20 pitchers of all time, ahead of such notables as [[Bob Gibson]], [[Nolan Ryan]], [[Steve Carlton]], [[Sandy Koufax]], [[Don Drysdale]], [[Walter Johnson]] and [[Roger Clemens]], who each have strikeout-to-walk ratios of less than 3:1. Over his career, he led the league in the fewest walks per nine innings four times, and finished second three times – totaling eleven years in which he finished in the top 10, all while also finishing in the top 10 for strikeouts six years.

===The Greatest Game Ever Pitched===
One regular-season game in Marichal's career deserves mention, involving him and [[1963 Milwaukee Braves season|Milwaukee Braves']] Hall of Famer [[Warren Spahn]] in a night contest played July 2, 1963, before almost 16,000 at [[Candlestick Park]] in San Francisco. The two great pitchers matched scoreless innings until Giants [[outfielder]] [[Willie Mays]] homered off Spahn to win the game 1–0 in the 16th inning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1138463/index.htm ''July 2, 1963'', by Ron Fimrite, Sports Illustrated, July 19, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="July 2, 1963 Braves-Giants box score at Baseball Reference"&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SFN/SFN196307020.shtml July 2, 1963 Braves-Giants box score at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; Both Spahn and Marichal tossed 15-plus inning complete games,&lt;ref name="July 2, 1963 Braves-Giants box score at Baseball Reference"/&gt; something that had not happened before or since in the big leagues. Marichal allowed eight hits (all singles except for a double hit by Spahn) in the 16 innings, striking out 10, and saddling eventual career home run king [[Hank Aaron]] with an 0-for-6 collar.&lt;ref name="July 2, 1963 Braves-Giants box score at Baseball Reference"/&gt; Spahn permitted nine hits in 15{{frac|1|3}} innings, walking just one (Mays intentionally, in the 14th, after [[Harvey Kuenn]]'s leadoff double) and striking out two.&lt;ref name="July 2, 1963 Braves-Giants box score at Baseball Reference"/&gt; The game, almost the innings-duration of two contests, lasted only 4 hours, 10 minutes.&lt;ref name="July 2, 1963 Braves-Giants box score at Baseball Reference"/&gt; By coincidence, future Major League Baseball commissioner [[Bud Selig]] attended the game as a fan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2013/07/01/marichal-spahn-epic-duel-was-50-years-ago/ |title=Marichal-Spahn epic duel was 50 years ago |work=[[The Mercury News]] |last=Brown |first=Daniel |date=August 12, 2016 |accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roseboro incident===
Marichal is also remembered for a notorious incident that occurred with [[John Roseboro]] during a game between the Giants and [[1965 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] at [[Candlestick Park]] on August 22, {{Baseball year|1965}}.&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldstein|first1=Richard|title=John Roseboro, a Dodgers Star, Dies at 69|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/20/sports/john-roseboro-a-dodgers-star-dies-at-69.html|accessdate=26 December 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=August 20, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mann |first=Jack |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1965/08/30/605969/the-battle-of-san-francisco |title=The Battle Of San Francisco |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=August 30, 1965 |accessdate=December 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Giant-Dodger rivalry was, at the time, the fiercest in baseball - a rivalry which began when both teams played in the New York City market.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"&gt;{{cite news |title=Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball |agency=Associated Press |work=The Times-News |page=18 |date=22 August 1990 |accessdate=31 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1665&amp;dat=19900822&amp;id=llYaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tSQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6791,5769085&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 1965 season neared its climax, the Giants were involved in a tight pennant race, entering the game trailing the Dodgers by a game and a half while the [[1965 Milwaukee Braves season|Milwaukee Braves]] were one game behind the Dodgers.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"&gt;{{cite web |last=Rosengren |first=John |url=https://www.si.com/mlb/2014/04/21/juan-marichal-johnny-roseboro-brawl-excerpt |title=Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=2014 |accessdate=December 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maury Wills]] led off the game with a [[Bunt (baseball)|bunt]] single off Marichal and scored when [[Ron Fairly]] hit a [[Double (baseball)|double]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SFN/SFN196508220.shtml |title=August 22, 1965 Dodgers-Giants box score |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=31 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marichal, a fierce competitor, viewed the bunt as a cheap way to get on base and took umbrage with Wills.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt; When Wills came up to bat in the second [[inning]], Marichal threw a pitch directly at Wills sending him sprawling to the ground.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt; [[Willie Mays]] then led off the bottom of the second inning for the Giants and Dodgers' pitcher [[Sandy Koufax]] threw a pitch over Mays' head as a token form of retaliation.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt; In the top of the third inning with two [[Out (baseball)|outs]], Marichal threw a [[fastball]] that came close to hitting Fairly, prompting him to dive to the ground.&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt; Marichal's act angered the Dodgers and home plate umpire [[Shag Crawford]] warned both teams any further retaliations would not be tolerated.&lt;ref name="Marichal, Roseboro and the inside story of baseball's nastiest brawl"/&gt;

Marichal came to bat in the third inning expecting Koufax to throw at him. Instead, Marichal was startled when, after the second pitch, Roseboro's return throw to Koufax either brushed his ear or came close enough for Marichal to feel the breeze off the ball.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; When Marichal confronted Roseboro, Roseboro came out of his crouch with his fists clenched.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; Marichal later said he thought Roseboro was about to attack him. Marichal raised his bat, striking Roseboro at least twice on the head, opening a two-inch gash that sent blood flowing down the catcher's face. Roseboro later required 14 stitches.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Put up your dukes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/basebrawl.html |title=Put up your dukes |publisher=espn.go.com |accessdate=4 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Koufax raced in from the mound to attempt to separate them and was joined by the umpires, players and coaches from both teams.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;

A 14-minute brawl ensued on the field before Koufax, Giants captain Willie Mays and other peacemakers restored order.&lt;ref name="The Battle Of San Francisco"/&gt; Marichal was ejected from the game and afterwards, National League president [[Warren Giles]] suspended him for eight games (two starts), fined him a then-NL record US$1,750&lt;ref name=NYT1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MLBN Remembers ("Incident at Candlestick") |publisher=[[MLB Network|MLBN-tv]] |date=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Inflation|US|1750|1965|r=-1|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}),{{Inflation-fn|US}} and also forbade him from traveling to [[Dodger Stadium]] for the final, crucial two-game series of the season.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; Roseboro filed a $110,000 damage suit against Marichal one week after the incident but, eventually settled out of court for $7,500.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;

Many people protested the apparently light punishment meted out, since it would cost Marichal only two starts.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; The Giants were in a tight pennant race with the Dodgers (as well as the Pirates, Reds, and Braves) and the race was decided with only two games to play. The Giants, who ended up winning the August 22 game and were down only {{frac|1|2}} game afterward, eventually lost the pennant to the Dodgers by 2 games. Ironically, the Giants went on a 14-game win streak that started during Marichal's absence and by then it was a two-team race as the Pirates, Reds, and Braves fell further behind. But then the Dodgers won 15 of their final 16 games (after Marichal had returned) to win the pennant. Marichal won in his first game back, 2–1 vs. the Astros on September 9 (the same day Koufax pitched his perfect game vs. the Cubs), but lost his last three decisions as the Giants slumped in the season's final week.

Marichal didn't face the Dodgers again until [[spring training]] in April 3, {{Baseball year|1966}}. In his first at bat against Marichal since the incident, Roseboro hit a three-run home run.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro Hammers Homer In First Meeting With Juan Marichal"&gt;{{cite news |title=John Roseboro Hammers Homer In First Meeting With Juan Marichal |agency=Associated Press |work=The Day |page=25 |date=4 April 1966 |accessdate=30 December 2015 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&amp;dat=19660404&amp;id=yuwgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wnIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=873,438492&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; San Francisco General Manager [[Chub Feeney]] approached Dodgers General Manager [[Buzzy Bavasi]] to attempt to arrange a handshake between Marichal and Roseboro however, Roseboro declined the offer.&lt;ref name="John Roseboro Hammers Homer In First Meeting With Juan Marichal"/&gt;

Years later, Roseboro stated that he was retaliating for Marichal having thrown at Wills.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; He explained that Koufax would not throw at batters for fear of hurting them due to the velocity of his pitches.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; He further stated that his throwing close to Marichal's ear was, "standard operating procedure", as a form of retribution.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt; After years of bitterness, Roseboro and Marichal became close friends in the 1980s, getting together occasionally at Old-Timers games, golf tournaments and charity events.&lt;ref name="Marichal clubbing of Roseboro an ugly side of baseball"/&gt;

===1970–75===
In [[1970 San Francisco Giants season|1970]], Marichal experienced a severe reaction to penicillin which led to back pain and chronic arthritis. Marichal's career stumbled in {{Baseball year|1970}}, when he only posted 12 wins and his ERA shot up to 4.12, before straightening itself out with a stellar [[1971 San Francisco Giants season|1971]] season in which he won 18 games and his ERA dropped below 3.00.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; It was the only season in which Marichal earned any consideration for the [[Cy Young Award]], finishing in 8th place.  It was his final great season (and his final of nine All-Star appearances), however, as he posted 6–16 and 11–15 records in [[1972 San Francisco Giants season|1972]] and [[1973 San Francisco Giants season|1973]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt;

After the 1973 season, the Giants sold Marichal to the [[Boston Red Sox]].&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal Trades and Transactions at Baseball Almanac"&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/trades.php?p=maricju01 Juan Marichal Trades and Transactions at Baseball Almanac]&lt;/ref&gt; He had a fairly solid [[1974 Boston Red Sox season|1974]], going 5–1 in 11 starts, but was released after the season.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He then signed with the Dodgers as a [[free agent]].&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal Trades and Transactions at Baseball Almanac"/&gt; Dodger fans had never forgiven Marichal for his attack on Roseboro 10 years earlier, and it took a personal appeal from Roseboro to calm them down.  However, Marichal's [[1975 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1975]] didn't last long; he was lit up for nine runs, 11 hits and a 13.50 ERA in only two starts before retiring.&lt;ref name="TBT"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Team-by-Team Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball |last=Purdy |first=Dennis |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=[[Workman Publishing Company|Workman]] |location=New York City |isbn=0-7611-3943-5 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished his career with 243 victories, 142 losses, 244 complete games, 2,303 strikeouts and a 2.89 ERA over 3,507 innings pitched.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt; He played in the [[1962 World Series]] against the [[New York Yankees]] (one start, a [[Win–loss record (pitching)|no decision]]) and the [[1971 National League Championship Series]] against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] (losing his only start).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/maricju01.shtml#pitching_postseason Juan Marichal postseason pitching statistics at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1962 and 1971, the Giants averaged 90 wins a season, and Marichal averaged 20 wins a year.

Marichal pitched a [[no-hitter]] on June 15, {{Baseball year|1963}}, and was named to nine [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] teams.&lt;ref name="Juan Marichal at Baseball Reference"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SFN/SFN196306150.shtml June 15, 1963 Colt 45s-Giants box score at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; He was selected the [[Most Valuable Player]] of the [[1965 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1965 game in Minneapolis]], in which he pitched three shutout innings and faced the minimum nine batters, giving up one hit. His overall All-Star Game record was 2–0 with a 0.50 ERA in eight appearances facing 62 batters in 18 total innings, second-most in innings pitched only to [[Don Drysdale]] (19.1 innings; 2-1, 1.40 ERA and 69 batters faced).&lt;ref name="haft"&gt;Haft, Chris.

Marichal was passed over for election to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] during his first two years of eligibility, by all accounts because the [[Baseball Writers' Association of America]] voters still held his attack on Roseboro against him. However, after a personal appeal by Roseboro, Marichal was elected in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1983|1983]], and thanked Roseboro in his induction speech.&lt;ref name="Put up your dukes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TBT"/&gt; When Roseboro died in 2002, Marichal served as an honorary pallbearer at his funeral and told the gathered, "Johnny's forgiving me was one of the best things that happened in my life. I wish I could have had John Roseboro as my catcher."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/la-sp-roseboro-marichal-plaschke-20150823-column.html|first=Bill|last=Plaschke|title=Fifty years after Giants' Juan Marichal hit Dodgers' John Roseboro with a bat, all is forgiven|date=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marichal's uniform number 27 has been retired by the Giants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/sf/history/retired_numbers.jsp Giants retired numbers at MLB.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In {{Baseball year|1990}}, Marichal, who was working as a broadcaster for Spanish radio, was on hand to see his son-in-law at the time, [[José Rijo]], win the [[1990 World Series|World Series]] Most Valuable Player Award. In {{Baseball year|1999}}, he ranked #71 on ''[[The Sporting News]]''' list of the [[The Sporting News list of Baseball's Greatest Players|100 Greatest Baseball Players]], and was a finalist for the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.sportingnews.com/baseball/100/ Juan Marichal at The Sporting News 100 Greatest Baseball Players] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227144518/http://archive.sportingnews.com/baseball/100/ |date=February 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_history_moreinfo.jsp Juan Marichal at The Major League Baseball All-Century Team]&lt;/ref&gt; He was honored before a game between the Giants and [[Oakland Athletics]] with a statue outside [[AT&amp;T Park]] in [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005]], and was named one of the three starting pitchers on Major League Baseball's [[Latino Legends Team]]. In 1976, sportswriter Harry Stein published an "All Time All-Star Argument Starter", consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Marichal was the right-handed pitcher on Stein's Latin team. The Giants also honored him by wearing jerseys that said "Gigantes." Marichal was inducted into the [[Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum]] Hall of Fame on July 20, 2003 in pregame on field ceremony at Pac Bell Park.&lt;ref name="HHBM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hispanicbaseballmuseum.com/fme_marich.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030606064129/http://hispanicbaseballmuseum.com/fme_marich.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2003-06-06|title=Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum|work=|accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In 2008, Marichal was filmed at a [[cockfighting|cockfight]] in the Dominican Republic along with [[New York Mets]] pitcher [[Pedro Martínez]]. The incident caused controversy in the United States, but Martinez defended their attendance at the cockfight by saying, "I understand that people are upset, but that is part of our Dominican culture and is legal in the Dominican Republic". He added, "I was invited by my idol, Juan Marichal, to attend the event as a spectator, not as a participant."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3234767 "Video showed Pedro, Marichal at cockfight"] ESPN&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karma]] is a concept in Puranic time/era which explains [[causality]] through a system where beneficial effects are derived from past beneficial actions and harmful effects from past harmful actions, creating a system of actions and reactions throughout a soul's ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]]'s) [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] lives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brodd | first = Jefferey | authorlink = | authors = | title = World Religions | publisher = Saint Mary's Press | year = 2003 | location = Winona, MN | pages = | url = | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-88489-725-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; forming a cycle of rebirth. The causality is said to be applicable not only to the material world but also to our thoughts, words, actions and actions that others do under our instructions.&lt;ref name=Mahesh23&gt;[[Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda]] , ''The hidden power in humans'', Ibera Verlag, page 23., {{ISBN|3-85052-197-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{importance-inline}}

==Origins==
The earliest appearance of the word ''karman'' is found in the Rigveda. The term ''karman'' also appears significantly in the Veda. According to Brahmana, "as his wife man is born to the world he has made" and one is placed in a balance in the other world for an estimate of one's good and evil deed. It also declares that as a man is 'constituted' by his desires, he is born in the other world with reference to these.&lt;ref&gt;Radhakrishnan, S. History of Philosophy - Eastern and Western. P. 50&lt;/ref&gt;
Scholars have generally agreed that the earliest formulation of the Karma doctrine occurs in the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad, which is the earliest of the Upanisads. The doctrine occurs here in the context of a discussion of the fate of the individual after death.&lt;ref&gt;Tull, Herman W. The Vedic Origins of Karma: Cosmos as Man in Ancient Indian Myth and Ritual. SUNY Series in Hindu Studies. P. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of transmigration of the soul, with respect to fateful retribution for acts committed, does not appear in the [[Rig Veda]].&lt;ref name="michaels156"&gt;Michaels, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; The belief in rebirth is, suggests Radhakrishnan, evident in the Brahmanas, where words like ''punar-mrtyu''(re-death), ''punar-asu'' (coming to life again) and ''punarajati'' (rebirth) are used to denote it.&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;Radhakrishnan, S. [https://archive.org/stream/HistoryOfWesternAndEasternPhilosophyByRadhaKrishnan/Radhakrishnan-history.of.philosophy-Eastern.and.western-volume#page/n49/mode/2up History of Philosophy - Eastern and Western], P. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Radhakrishnan acknowledges that other scholars interpret certain ''punar-mrtyu'' verses of Rigveda to be discussing "repeated deaths"; however, he suggests that it might also be re-interpreted to imply rebirth, as in "come home once again".&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

The concept of karma first appears strongly in the [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref&gt;''[The Bhagavad Gita, Indian Sacred Text], By Swami Nikhilananda,Chapter 3, Ramakrishna -Vivekananda Centre Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=December 2014}} The topic of karma is mentioned in the [[Purana]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4WZTj3M71y0C Karma and Rebirth in Classical Indian Traditions], By Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty, Wendy Doniger, page 14, University of California Press, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The word ‘karma’ has originated from the Sanskrit root ‘kri’ which means ‘to do’ or ‘to ‘act and react’&lt;ref&gt;Yogananda, Paramhansa , Autobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 26: The Science of Kriya Yoga, Jaico Publishing House, 127, Mahatma Gandhi Road Fort, Mumbai  - 400 023 (ed. 1997) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bangala Bhasar Abhidhaan ( Dictioanary of the Bengali Language) Shishu Sahitya Samsad Pvt Ltd. 32A, APC Road, Kolakata – 700009, Volume 1, p.151. (ed. 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

"Karma" literally means "action" or "reincarnation", and more broadly names the universal principle of cause and effect, action and reaction, which Hindus believe governs all consciousness.&lt;ref name="Subra1"&gt;[[Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]], lexicon section of his book, ''Dancing with Siva''&lt;/ref&gt; Karma is not [[destiny|fate]], for we act with what can be described as a conditioned [[free will]] creating our own destinies. Karma refers to the totality of our actions and their concomitant reactions in this and previous lives, all of which determine our future. The conquest of karma lies in intelligent action and dispassionate reaction. Not all karmas rebound immediately. Some accumulate and return unexpectedly in this or other lifetimes. Human beings are said to produce karma in four ways:&lt;ref name=Mahesh22&gt;[[Paramhans Swami Maheshwarananda]] , ''The hidden power in humans'', Ibera Verlag, page 22., {{ISBN|3-85052-197-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=December 2014}}
* through thoughts
* through right attitude words
* through actions that we perform ourselves
* through actions others perform under our instructions

Everything  that we have ever thought, spoken, done or caused is karma, as is also that which we think, speak or do this very moment.&lt;ref name="Mahesh23"/&gt; Hindu scriptures divide karma into three kinds:&lt;ref name="Mahesh23"/&gt;

* ''[[Sanchita karma|Sanchita]]'' is the accumulated karma. It would be impossible to experience and endure all karmas in one lifetime. From this stock of ''sanchita karma'', a handful is taken out to serve one lifetime and this handful of actions, which have begun to bear fruit and which will be exhausted only on their fruit being enjoyed and not otherwise, is known as ''prarabdha karma''.
* ''[[Prarabdha karma|Prarabdha]]'' Fruit-bearing karma is the portion of accumulated karma that has "ripened" and appears as a particular problem in the present life.
* ''[[kriyamana karma|Kriyamana]]'' is everything that we produce in the current life. All ''kriyamana karmas'' flow in to ''sanchita karma'' and consequently shape our future. Only in human life we can change our future destiny. After death we lose Kriya Shakti (ability to act) and do (kriyamana) karma until we are born again in another human body.

Some believe that only human beings who can distinguish right from wrong can do (kriyamana) karma.&lt;ref name="Mahesh22"/&gt; Therefore, animals and young children are considered incapable of creating new karma (and thus cannot affect their future destinies) as they are incapable of discriminating between right and wrong.&lt;ref name="chandrasekhara1"&gt;Chandrasekhara Bharathi Mahaswamigal, ''Dialogues with the Guru''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tulsidas]], a Hindu saint, said: "Our destiny was shaped long before the body came into being." As long as the stock of ''sanchita karma'' lasts, a part of it continues to be taken out as ''prarabdha karma'' for being enjoyed in one lifetime, leading to the cycle of birth and death. A [[Jiva]] cannot attain [[moksha]] (liberation) from the cycle of birth and death, until the accumulated ''sanchita karmas'' are completely exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;Goyandaka J, ''The Secret of Karmayoga'', Gita Press, Gorakhpur&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=December 2014}}

Unkindness yields spoiled fruits, called ''paap'', and good deeds bring forth sweet fruits, called ''[[Punya (Hinduism)|punya]]''. As one acts, so does one become: one becomes virtuous by virtuous action, and evil by evil action.&lt;ref name="Subra"&gt;Subramuniyaswami, Satguru Sivaya. ''Dancing with Siva''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of divine forces==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
Several different views exist in Hinduism, some extant today and some historical, regarding the role of divine beings in controlling the effects of karma or the lack thereof.

===Vedanta view===
In the theistic side of [[Vedanta]],the creator [[Ishvara]] rules over the world through the law of karma.&lt;ref&gt;Vedantic Meditation, pg. 4, by David Frawley at https://books.google.com/books?id=f8oWsWOKDC4C&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=vedanta+supreme+Being+karma&amp;lr=&amp;cd=50#v=onepage&amp;q=vedanta%20supreme%20Being%20karma&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sankara (Advaita)====
In non-dualistic (Advaita) school of Vedanta, the creator is not the ultimate reality, "I am God" is the supreme truth, the pursuit of self-knowledge is spirituality, and it shares the general concepts of karma-rebirth-samsara ideas found in Buddhism with some important differences.&lt;ref&gt;Vedantic Meditation, pg. 5-6, by David Frawley at https://books.google.com/books?id=f8oWsWOKDC4C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=vedanta+supreme+Being+karma&amp;lr=&amp;cd=50#v=onepage&amp;q=vedanta%20supreme%20Being%20karma&amp;f=false Quote - "&lt;/ref&gt;

In a commentary to [[Brahma Sutras]] (III, 2, 38, and 41), a Vedantic text, [[Adi Sankara]], an Indian philosopher who consolidated the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta, a sub-school of Vedanta, argues that the original karmic actions themselves cannot bring about the proper results at some future time; neither can super sensuous, non-intelligent qualities  like  [[adrsta]]—an unseen force being the metaphysical link between work and its result—by themselves mediate the appropriate, justly deserved pleasure and pain. The fruits, according to him, then, must be administered  through  the action  of a conscious agent, namely, a supreme being ([[Ishvara]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Reichenbach  | first =Bruce R.  | title =Karma, causation, and divine intervention  | journal =Philosophy East and West  | volume =39  | issue =2  | pages = 135–149 [145]  | publisher =University of Hawaii Press  | location =Hawaii  | date = April 1989  | url =http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/reiche2.htm  | accessdate = 2009-12-29 | doi=10.2307/1399374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A human's karmic acts result in merits and demerits. Since unconscious things generally do not move except when caused by an agent (for example, the ax moves only when swung by an agent), and since the law  of karma is an unintelligent and unconscious law, Sankara argues there must be a conscious God who knows the merits and demerits which persons  have earned  by their actions, and who functions as an instrumental cause [a "judge and police-force" working for "the law"] in helping individuals reap their appropriate fruits.&lt;ref&gt;see,Theistic Explanations of Karma, pg. 146 of Causation and Divine Intervention by BR Reichenbach at http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/reiche2.htm citing Sankara's commentary on Brahma Sutras,III, 2, 38, and 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, God affects the person's environment, even to its atoms, and for those souls who reincarnate, produces the appropriate rebirth body, all in order that the person might have the karmically appropriate experiences.&lt;ref&gt;See, Theistic Explanations of Karma, Causation and Divine Intervention by BR Reichenbach at http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/reiche2.htm citing Sankara's commentary on Brahma Sutras,III, 2, 38, and 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Since a data-system (or computer) is needed to discern different "just" consequences for actions, there is suggested to be a sentient theistic administrator or supervisor for karma, i.e., Vishnu (King of Kings).

;Advaita according to Sivananda
{{One source|section|date=January 2015}}
[[Swami Sivananda]], an [[Advaita]] scholar, reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the [[Brahma Sutras]]. In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed. Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one's merit. Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates [[apurva]] or [[Punya (Hinduism)|punya]], which gives fruit. Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as God. It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Sivananda, Swami. ''Phaladhikaranam, Topic 8'', Sutras 38-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a passage from Swami Sivananda's translation of the [[Svetasvatara Upanishad]] (4:6) illustrating this concept:

:''Two birds of beautiful plumage — inseparable friends — live on the same tree. Of these two one eats the sweet fruit while the other looks on without eating.''

In his commentary, the first bird represents the individual soul, while the second represents [[Brahman]] or [[God]]. The soul is essentially a reflection of Brahman. The tree represents the body. The soul identifies itself with the body, reaps the fruits of its actions, and undergoes rebirth. The Lord alone stands as an eternal witness, ever contented, and does not eat, for he is the director of both the eater and the eaten.

Swami Sivananda also notes that God is free from charges of partiality and cruelty which are brought against him because of [[social inequality]], fate, and universal [[suffering]] in the world. According to the [[Brahma Sutras]], individual souls are responsible for their own fate; God is merely the dispenser and witness with reference to the merit and demerit of souls.

In his commentary on Chapter 2 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda further notes that the position of God with respect to karma can be explained through the analogy of rain. Although rain can be said to bring about the growth of rice, barley and other plants, the differences in various species is due to the diverse potentialities lying hidden in the respective seeds. Thus, Sivananda explains that differences between classes of beings are due to different merits belonging to individual souls. He concludes that God metes rewards and punishments only in consideration of the specific actions of beings.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Sivananda, Swami. ''Adhikarana XII'', Sutras 34-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ramanuja (Vishishtadvaita)====
{{One source|section|date=January 2015}}
[[Ramanuja]] of the [[Vishishtadvaita]] school, another sub-school of Vedanta, addresses the problem of evil by attributing all evil things in life to the accumulation of evil karma of [[jiva]]s (souls in bondage to a corporeal form) and maintains that God is "amala," or without any stain of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami.  ''Bhakti Schools of Vedanta''.&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Sri Bhasya]], Ramanuja's interpretation of the Brahma sutras from a [[Vaishnavite]] theistic view, Brahman, whom he conceives as [[Vishnu]], arranges the diversity of creation in accordance with the different karma of individual souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bharatadesam.com/spiritual/brahma_sutra/sribhashya_ramanuja/vedanta_sutra_commentary_ramanuja204.php |title=SriBhashya - Ramanujas Commentary On Brahma Sutra (Vedanta Sutra) - Brahma Sutra Sribhashya Ramanuja Vedanta Sutra Commentary Ramanuja204 |publisher=Bharatadesam.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=December 2014}}

Ramanuja, reiterates that inequality and diversity in the world are due to the fruits of karma of different souls and the omnipresent energy of the soul suffers pain or pleasure due to its karma.&lt;ref name="tapasyananda44"&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami.  ''Bhakti Schools of Vedanta'' p 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Semitic religions, e.g., [[Abrahamic religions]], which believe that God created the soul and the world out of ‘nothing,’ Ramanuja believed that creation is an eternally recurring cyclic process and hence God is free from the responsibility of starting it and causing the evils accruing from it.&lt;ref name="tapasyananda44"/&gt; Instead he believed that karma, the result of the actions of [[Jiva]]s (souls) in previous embodiments, causes the good and evil, enjoyments and sufferings of karma which have to be necessarily to be enjoyed or suffered by the Jivas themselves who are responsible for the fruits.&lt;ref name="tapasyananda44"/&gt;

Although souls alone have the freedom and responsibility for their acts and thus reap the fruits of karma, i.e., good and evil karma, God as Vishnu, is the supreme Enforcer of karma, by acting as the Sanctioner (Anumanta) and the Overseer (Upadrasta).&lt;ref name="tapasyananda57"&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami.  ''Bhakti Schools of Vedanta'' p 57.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ramanuja, all [[jiva]]s are burdened with their load of Karma, which gives them only enjoyments and sufferings, but also desires and tendencies to act in particular ways; although the moral responsibility accrues only  to the Jiva, as he acts according to the tendencies and deserts he has acquired by his karma, Ramanuja believes that God wills only their fructification.&lt;ref name="tapasyananda57"/&gt; According to the foregoing concept, God is "compared to light which may be used for forging or for reading scriptures," but the merits or demerit "devolves entirely on the persons concerned and not on the light."&lt;ref name="tapasyananda57"/&gt;

Furthermore, Ramanuja believes that [[Vishnu]] wishing to do a favour to those who are resolved on acting so as fully to please Him, engenders in their minds a tendency towards highly virtuous actions, such as means to attain to Him; while on the other hand, in order to punish those who are resolved on lines of action altogether displeasing to Him, He engenders in their minds a delight in such actions as have a downward tendency and are obstacles in the way of the attainment of God.&lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta, Surendranath, ''A History of Indian Philosophy'', Volume III, ''Philosophy of the Ramanuja School of Thought'', p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;

====Madhva (Dvaita)====
{{One source|section|date=January 2015}}
[[Madhvacharya|Madhva]], the founder of the [[Dvaita]] school, another sub-school of Vedanta, on the other hand, believes that there must be a root cause for variations in karma even if karma is accepted as having no beginning and being the cause of the problem of evil.&lt;ref name="tapasyananda178"&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami.  ''Bhakti Schools of Vedanta'' pgs. 178-179.&lt;/ref&gt; Since jivas have different kinds of karma, from good to bad, all must not have started with same type of karma from the beginning of time. Thus, Madhva concludes that the [[jiva]]s (souls) are not God's [[Creation myth|creation]] as in the Christian doctrine, but are rather entities co-existent with [[Vishnu]], although under His absolute control. Souls are thus dependent on Him in their pristine nature and in all transformations that they may undergo.&lt;ref name="tapasyananda178"/&gt;

According to Madhva, God, although He has control, does not interfere with Man's free will; although He is omnipotent, that does not mean that He engages in extraordinary feats. Rather, God enforces a rule of law and, in accordance with the just deserts of jivas, gives them freedom to follow their own nature.&lt;ref name="tapasyananda1781"&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami.  ''Bhakti Schools of Vedanta''pgs. 178-179.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, God functions as the sanctioner or as the divine accountant, and accordingly jivas are free to work according to their innate nature and their accumulated karma, good and bad. Since God acts as the sanctioner, the ultimate power for everything comes from God and the jiva only utilizes that power, according to his/her innate nature. However, like [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]]'s interpretation of the [[Brahma Sutras]] as mentioned earlier, Madhva, agrees that the rewards and punishments bestowed by God are regulated by Him in accordance with the good and sinful deeds performed by them, and He does so of out of His own will to keep himself firm in justice and he cannot be controlled in His actions by karma of human beings nor can He be accused of partiality or cruelty to anyone.&lt;ref name="tapasyananda1781"/&gt;

Swami [[Tapasyananda]] further explains the Madhva view by illustrating the doctrine with this analogy: the power in a factory comes from the powerhouse (God), but the various cogs (''jivas'') move in a direction in which they are set. Thus he concludes that no charge of partiality and cruelty can be brought against God. The jiva is the actor and also the enjoyer of the fruits of his/her own actions.&lt;ref name="tapasyananda178"/&gt;

Madhva differed significantly from traditional Hindu beliefs, owing to his concept of [[eternity|eternal]] [[damnation]]. For example, he divides souls into three classes: one class of souls which qualify for liberation ([[Mukti-yogyas]]), another subject to eternal rebirth or eternal transmigration ([[Nitya-samsarins]]), and a third class that is eventually condemned to eternal [[hell]] or [[Andhatamas]] ([[Tamo-yogyas]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami.  ''Bhakti Schools of Vedanta'' pg. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mimamsa view===

Earlier historical traditions of Hinduism such as [[Mimamsa]]kas, reject any such notions of divinity being responsible and see karma as acting independently, considering the natural laws of causation sufficient to explain the effects of karma.&lt;ref&gt;Pratima Bowes, The Hindu Religious Tradition 54-80 (Allied Pub. 1976) {{ISBN|0-7100-8668-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, Vol. II, at 217-225 (18th reprint 1995) {{ISBN|81-85301-75-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Michaels, Hinduism: Past and Present 154-56 (Princeton 1998) {{ISBN|0-691-08953-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Mimamsakas it is useless to set up a God for that purpose, since Karma itself can give the result at a future time.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Brahma Sutras III.2.38. Vireswarananda, {{ISBN|978-8185301952}}, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proof of existence of God from Karma===

In the later writings in the [[Nyaya]], school of philosophy, [[Udayana]]'s ''[[Nyayakusumanjali]]'' used Karma for the last of his nine proofs of the existence of a creative God:&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, pp.209-10&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Nyaya#Nyaya on God and salvation|Nyaya on God and Salvation]].

Swami [[Sivananda Saraswati]] puts it like this:

:: {{quote|"Some people die when they are eighty years old; some die when they are in the womb; some die at twenty; some at forty. What is the cause for the variation? Who has fixed the span of life for all? This clearly proves that there is the theory of Karma, that there is one Omniscient Lord, who is the dispenser of the fruits of the actions of the Jivas, who fixes the span of life of the Jivas in accordance with their nature of Karma or actions, who knows the exact relation between Karmas and their fruits. As Karma is Jada or insentient, it certainly cannot dispense with the fruits of their actions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlshq.org/download/god_exists.htm God Exists] SRI SWAMI SIVANANDA, A DIVINE LIFE SOCIETY PUBLICATION, First Edition: 1958, World Wide Web (WWW) Edition : 1998&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=December 2014}}}}

==Views of the theistic Hindu traditions believing in a supreme God==
{{Tone|section|date=December 2014}}
Sivananda concludes that God metes rewards and punishments only in consideration of the specific actions of beings.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Shaivism===

====Thirugnana Sambandar====
[[File:Karma AS.jpg|160px|thumb|right|Karma as [[Action (philosophy)|action philosophy]] and [[value theory]]: if we sow goodness, we will reap goodness.]]
[[Sambandar]] of the [[Shaiva Siddhanta]] school, in the 7th century C.E., writes about karma in his outline of [[Shaivism]]. He explains the concept of karma in Hinduism by distinguishing it from that of [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], which do not require the existence of an external being like God. In their beliefs, just as a calf among a large number of cows can find its mother at suckling time, so also does karma find the specific individual it needs to attach to and come to fruition.&lt;ref name="Indian Philosophy pg. 34"&gt;Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophy, pg. 34, by Vraj Kumar Pandey, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; However, theistic Hindus posit that karma, unlike the calf, is an unintelligent entity.&lt;ref name="Indian Philosophy pg. 34"/&gt; Hence, karma cannot locate the appropriate person by itself. Sambantha concludes that an intelligent [[Supreme Being]] with perfect wisdom and power ([[Shiva]], for example) is necessary to make karma attach to the appropriate individual.&lt;ref name="Indian Philosophy pg. 34"/&gt; In such sense, God is the Divine Accountant.&lt;ref name="Indian Philosophy pg. 34"/&gt;

====Appayya Dikshita====
{{One source|section|date=January 2015}}
[[Appayya Dikshita]], a Shaiva theologian and proponent of Shiva Advaita, states that Shiva only awards happiness and misery in accordance with the law of karma.&lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta, Surendranath, ''A History of Indian Philosophy'', Volume V, ''The Southern Schools of Saivism'', p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Thus persons themselves perform good or evil actions according to their own inclinations as acquired in past creations, and in accordance with those deeds, a new creation is made for the fulfilment of the law of karma. Shaivas believe that there are cycles of creations in which souls gravitate to specific bodies in accordance with karma, which as an unintelligent object depends on the will of Siva alone.

====Srikantha====
{{One source|section|date=January 2015}}
Srikantha, another Saivite theologian and proponent of Siva Advaita, believes that individual souls themselves do things which may be regarded as the cause of their particular actions, or desisting from particular actions, in accordance with the nature of the fruition of their past deeds.&lt;ref name="dasgupta87"&gt;Dasgupta, Surendranath. ''A History of Indian Philosophy, Volume V: The Southern Schools of Saivism'', pp. 87-89.&lt;/ref&gt; Srikantha further believes that Siva only helps a person when he wishes to act in a particular way or to desist from a particular action. Regarding the view that karma produce their own effects directly, Srikantha holds that karma being without any intelligence cannot be expected to produce manifold effects through various births and various bodies; rather fruits of one's karma can be performed only by the will of God operating in consonance with man's free will, or as determined in later stages by man's own karma so the prints of all karma are distributed in the proper order by the grace of God [[Shiva]].&lt;ref name="dasgupta87"/&gt; In this way, God is ultimately responsible on one hand for our actions, and on the other for enjoyment and suffering in accordance with our karmas, without any prejudice to humans' moral responsibility as expressed through free will or as determined later by our own deeds.&lt;ref name="dasgupta87"/&gt; A good summary of his view is that "man is responsible, free to act as he wills to, for Siva only fulfills needs according to the soul's karma." &lt;ref&gt;Hinduism Today, March 1994 issue at http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=3249&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaishnavism===

====Sacred Texts====

=====Bhagavata Purana=====
In Chapter 1 of 10th book of the [[Bhagavata Purana]], [[Vasudeva]], the father of [[Krishna]], exhorts [[Kamsa]] to refrain from killing his wife, [[Devaki]], the mother of [[Krishna]], by stating that death is certain for those who are born and when the body returns to the five elements, the soul leaves the body and helplessly obtains another form in accordance with the laws of karma, citing passages from [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], IV:4:3.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Krishna, the Beautiful Legend of God, pgs 11-12, and commentary pgs. 423-424, by Edwin Bryant&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he adds and states that the soul materializes into an appropriate body whatever the state of the mind one remembers at the time of death; i.e., at the time of the death, the soul and its subtle body of mind, intelligence and ego, is projected into the womb of a creature, human or non-human that can provide a gross body that is most suitable for the dominant state of the mind of the particular person at the time of death; note that this passage is similar in meaning as [[Bhagavad Gita]], VIII, verse 6 &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  [[Edwin Bryant (author)|Edwin Bryant]], [[Associate Professor]] of [[religion]] at [[Rutgers University]], [[New Jersey]] provided the foregoing commentaries on the discussion of Vasudeva in the Bhagavata Purana.

=====Vishnu Sahasranama=====
{{One source|section|date=January 2015}}
Many names in the [[Vishnu Sahasranama]], the thousand names of [[Vishnu]] allude to the power of God in controlling karma. For example, the 135th name of Vishnu, Dharmadhyaksha, in the Advaita philosopher [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]]'s interpretation means, "One who directly sees the merits ([[Dharma]]) and demerits ([[Adharma]]), of beings by bestowing their due rewards on them." &lt;ref&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami.  ''Sri Vishnu Sahasranama, pg. 62''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other names of Vishnu alluding to this nature of God are Bhavanah, the 32nd name, Vidhata, the 44th name, Apramattah, the 325th name, Sthanadah, the 387th name and Srivibhavanah, the 609th name.&lt;ref&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami.  ''Sri Vishnu Sahasranama, pgs. 48, 49, 87, 96 and 123. ''&lt;/ref&gt;  Bhavanah, according to Sankara's interpretation, means "One who generates the fruits of Karmas of all [[Jiva]]s (souls) for them to enjoy."&lt;ref name="tapasyananda"&gt;Tapasyananda, Swami.  ''Sri Vishnu Sahasranama, pg. 48.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Brahma Sutra]] (3.2.28) "Phalmatah upapatteh" speaks of the Lord's function as the bestower of the fruits of all actions of the [[jiva]]s.&lt;ref name="tapasyananda"/&gt;

====Vaishnavite Vedanta schools of Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita and Madhva's Dvaita====

See above discussion of karma under the Vedanta sections of Ramanuja (Vishishtadvaita) and Madhva (Dvaita) for treatment of karma under the two Vaishnavite teachers.

====Gaudiya Vaishnavism view====
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
"''According to their '''karma''''', all living entities are wandering throughout the entire universe. Some of them are being elevated to the upper planetary systems, and some are going down into the lower planetary systems. ''Out of '''many millions''' of wandering living entities'', one who is very fortunate gets an opportunity to associate with a bona fide spiritual master by the grace of [[Krishna]]. By the mercy of both Krsna and the spiritual master, such a person receives the seed of the creeper of devotional service."&lt;ref&gt;C.C.Madhya 19-151-164&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other Vaishnavite thoughts====
[[Kulashekhara]] Alwar, a Vaishnava devotee, says in his "[[Mukundamala]] Stotra": 'yad yad bhavyam bhavatu bhagavan purva-karma-anurupam'. And purva-karma or bhaagya or daiva is unseen [[adrsta]] by us, and is known only to God as Vidhaataa.&lt;ref&gt;"Mukundamala Stotra". Author: Kulashekhara Alwar. Verse: 5. Publisher: Lakshmi Venkateshwara Press, Kalyan, Mumbai. Year: Samvat 1980&lt;/ref&gt; God created the law of karma, and God will not violate it. God does, however, give courage and strength if asked.

===Nyaya===
The [[Nyaya]] school, one of six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy, states that one of the proofs of the existence of God is karma;&lt;ref name="ccbs.ntu.edu.tw"&gt;See Theistic Explanations of Karma, pg. 146 of Causation and Divine Intervention by BR Reichenbach, citing Uddyotakara, Nyaayavaarttika, IV, 1, 21, at http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/reiche2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It is seen that some people in this world are happy, some are in misery. Some are rich and some poor. The Naiyanikas explain this by the concept of karma and reincarnation. The fruit of an individual's actions does not always lie within the reach of the individual who is the agent; there ought to be, therefore, a dispenser of the fruits of actions, and this supreme dispenser is God.&lt;ref name="ccbs.ntu.edu.tw"/&gt; This belief of Nyaya, accordingly, is the same as that of [[Vedanta]] and [[Vaiśeṣika Sūtra]].&lt;ref name="ccbs.ntu.edu.tw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanyal, Jagadiswar, Guide To Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1996)p.11&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus the Nyaya school provides the moral argument for the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;Sanyal, Jagadiswar, Guide To Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1996)p.165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dharmaśāstras==
{{one source|section|date=January 2015}}
In Hinduism, more particularly the [[Dharmaśāstra]]s, Karma is a principle in which "cause and effect are as inseparably linked in the moral sphere as assumed in the physical sphere by science. A good action has its reward and a bad action leads to retribution. If the bad actions do not yield their consequences in this life, the soul begins another existence and in the new environment undergoes suffering for its past deeds".&lt;ref&gt;Kane, P.V. History of the Dharmaśāstras Vol. 4 p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus it is important to understand that karma does not go away, one must either reap the benefits or suffer the consequences of his past actions.  The [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] states, "According as a man acts and according as he believes so will he be; a man of meritorious acts will be meritorious, a man of evil deeds sinful. He becomes pure by pure deeds and evil by evil deeds. And here they say that person consists of desires. An as is his desire so is his will; and as is his will, so is his deed; and whatever deeds he does that he will reap".&lt;ref&gt;IV. 4. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctrine of karma dates from ancient times and besides the above author is mentioned in the Gautama dharma-sutra, [[Shatapatha Brahmana]], Kathaaka-grhya-sutra, [[Chandogya Upanishad]], [[Markandeya Purana]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, P.V. History of the Dharmaśāstras Vol. 4 p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[shastra]]s written about karma go into some detail about possible consequences of karma. There is often talk about coming back as a variety of different object when it comes to reincarnation and pasts lives. In this case, it holds true, or at least insofar as the texts state. The Kathaaka-grhya-sutra states, "some human beings enter the womb in order to have an embodied existence; others go into inorganic matter (the stump of a tree and the like) according to their deeds and according to their knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;5.7&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2014}}

More extensively discussed is the consequences of karma in relation to sin. "Karmavipaka means the ripening (or fruition) of evil actions or sins. This fruition takes three forms, as stated in the Yogasutra II. 3, i.e., [[jāti (Buddhism)|jati]] (birth as a worm or animal), ayuh (life i.e. living for a short period such as five or ten years) and bhoga (experiencing the torments of Hell".&lt;ref&gt;Kane, P.V. History of the Dharmaśāstras Vol. 4 p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigation of bad karma==

According to a theistic view, the effects of one's bad karma may be mitigated. Examples of how bad karma can be mitigated include following, or living virtuously; performing good deeds, such as helping others;  yoga, or worshiping God in order to receive grace; and  conducting pilgrimages to sacred places, such as  or to get grace of God. Editors of Hinduism Today Magazine, What is Hinduism?   &lt;ref&gt;http://www.himalayanacademy.com/resources/books/wih/&lt;/ref&gt; In another example, [[Ganesha]] can unweave his devotees from their karma, simplifying and purifying their lives, but this only happens after they have established a personal relationship with Him.&lt;ref&gt;Loving Ganesa, Chapter 1, at http://www.himalayanacademy.com/resources/books/lg/lg_ch-01.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of getting God's grace are further illustrated below.

===Upanishads===
{{one source|section|date=January 2015}}
[[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] 7 and 12 aver that the doer of the deeds wanders about and obtains rebirth according to his deeds but postulates an omnipotent creator, i.e., [[Isvara]] and the doctrine of grace.&lt;ref name="Krishnan, Yuvraj 1997, pg. 25"&gt;Krishnan, Yuvraj, "The Doctrine of Karma," 1997, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, pg. 25, at https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Isvara is the great refuge of all and a person attains immortality when blessed by Isvara or at Isvara's pleasure.&lt;ref name="Krishnan, Yuvraj pg. 25"&gt;Krishnan, Yuvraj, "The Doctrine of Karma," 1997, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, pg. 25, at https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

A person can be free from sorrow through the grace of Isvara. Therefore, the Shvetashvatara Upanishad postulates a supreme Being whose grace to devotees provides a way of escape from the law of karma.
As [[Adi Sankara]] stated in his commentary on [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] VI:4, "If we dedicate all our works to [[Ishvara]], we will not be subject to the law of karma." &lt;ref name="Krishnan, Yuvraj 1997, pg. 25"/&gt;

==Relation between birth in a particular body to karma==
{{one source|section|date=January 2015}}
{{See also|Reincarnation}}
Theistic schools believe in cycles of creations where souls gravitate to specific bodies in accordance with karma, which as an unintelligent object depends on the will of God alone. For example, [[Kaushitaki Upanishad]] 1.2 asserts that birth in different forms of existence as a [[worm]], [[insect]], [[fish]], [[bird]], [[lion]], [[boar]], [[snake]] or a [[human]], is determined by a person's deeds and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Krishnan, Yuvraj, "The Doctrine of Karma," 1997, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, pg. 21, at  https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chandogya Upanishad]] 5.10.7 distinguishes between good birth such as birth in a spiritual family, i.e., ([[brahmin]] caste) or an evil birth, such as birth as a [[dog]] or [[Domestic pig|hog]].) Thus, the doctrine of karma comes to explain why different life forms manifest, into widely various levels of biological development such as characterization into different species from [[plant]]s to various types of [[animal]]s, and to even differences between members of the same species, such as humans.&lt;ref&gt;Krishnan, Yuvraj, "The Doctrine of Karma," 1997, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, pg. 22, at https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Swami Nikilananda comments: As the rivers, following their different courses, ultimately merge in the ocean and give up their names and forms, so the devotees, losing their names and forms, become one with the Supreme Reality.&lt;ref&gt;''[The Bhagavad Gita, Indian Sacred Text], By Swami Nikhilananda,Chapter 4,9, 18,Ramakrishna -Vivekananda Centre Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation between astrology and karma==
{{one source|section|date=January 2015}}
Charles Keyes, professor emeritus at the [[University of Washington]] and [[E. Valentine Daniel]], professor of anthropology at [[Columbia University]] state that many Hindus believe that heavenly bodies, including the planets, have an influence throughout the life of a human being, and these planetary influences are the "fruit of karma." &lt;ref name="Karma pg. 134"&gt;Karma, an anthropological inquiry, pg. 134, at https://books.google.com/books?id=49GVZGD8d4oC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=shani+karma&amp;lr=&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=shani%20karma&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Navagraha]], planetary deities, including [[Shani]] (Saturn), are considered subordinate to [[Ishvara]] (i.e., the Supreme Being) and are believed by many to assist in the administration of justice.&lt;ref name="Karma pg. 134"/&gt; Thus, these planets can influence earthly life.&lt;ref name="Karma pg. 134"/&gt;

Such planetary influences are believed by many to be measurable using astrological methods including [[Jyotiṣa]], the Hindu system of astrology.&lt;ref&gt;Karma, an anthropological inquiry, pgs. 133-134, at https://books.google.com/books?id=49GVZGD8d4oC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=shani+karma&amp;lr=&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=shani%20karma&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses in Hinduism==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
Besides narrow meaning of karma as the reaction or suffering being due to karma of their past lives and that one would have to transmigrate to another body in their next life, it is often used in the broader sense as action or reaction.

Thus, karma in Hinduism may mean an activity, an action or a materialistic activity. Often with the specific combination it takes specific meanings, such as ''karma-yoga'' or ''karma-kanda'' means "yoga or actions" and "path of materialistic activity" respectively. Yet another example is [[Nitya karma]], which describes rituals which have to be performed daily by Hindus, such as the [[Sandhyavandanam]] which involves chanting of the [[Gayatri Mantra]].

Other uses include such expressions such as "ugra-karma", meaning bitter, unwholesome labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Satsvarupa | last   =Dasa Goswami | authorlink = Satsvarupa dasa Goswami| title =Prabhupada Lila  |publisher=| year = 1983 | chapter = SPL A Summer in Montreal, 1968 |isbn =   0-911233-36-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that Karma has a role in Hindu society as a whole. When one abides by their caste duty good Karma is earned and vice versa; and the Karma one collects is reflected in the next life as movement within the Caste system. The promise of upward mobility appealed to people, and was made plausible through Karma. This effectively "tamed" the lower castes into passive acceptance of the status quo. Thus, the Karma doctrine discouraged actual social mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Kent, Eliza. "What's Written on the Forehead Will Never Fail": Karma, Fate, and Headwriting in Indian Folktales." Asian Ethnology. 68.1 (2009): 1-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1646">'''Kleśa''' ([[sanskrit]] क्लेश, also ''klesha'' ) is a term from Indian philosophy and [[yoga]], meaning a "poison". The third ''[[śloka]]'' of the second chapter of [[Patanjali|Patañjali]]'s ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yogasūtra]]'' explicitly identifies Five Poisons (Sanskrit: ''pañcakleśā''):

:अविद्यास्मितारागद्वेषाभिनिवेशाः पञ्च क्लेशाः॥३॥
:{{IAST|Avidyāsmitārāgadveṣābhiniveśāḥ pañca kleśāḥ}}&lt;ref name=patanjali&gt;Patañjali ''et al.'' (2007) Source: [http://www.sanskrit-sanscrito.com.ar/english/sanskrit_pronunciation/pronunciation7.html] (accessed: November 23, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Translated into English, these five (pañca) Kleśa-s or Afflictions ({{IAST|kleśāḥ}}) are:&lt;ref name=patanjali /&gt;
* Ignorance (in the form of a misapprehension about reality) (ávidyā),
* egoism (in the form of an erroneous identification of the Self with the intellect) (asmitā),
* attachment (rāga),
* aversion ({{IAST|dveṣa}}), and
* fear of death (which is derived from clinging ignorantly to life) ({{IAST|abhiniveśāḥ}}).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="83271">'''[[Cognitive bias]]es''' are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, and are often studied in [[psychology]] and [[behavioral economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Haselton, M. G. |author2=Nettle, D. |author3=Andrews, P. W. |last-author-amp=yes |title=The evolution of cognitive bias.|year=2005|publisher=Hoboken, NJ, US: John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc|location=In D. M. Buss (Ed.), The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology|pages=724–746| url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/handbookevpsych.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the reality of these biases is confirmed by [[Replication (scientific method)|replicable]] research,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/tag/cognitive-bias|title=Cognitive Bias – Association for Psychological Science|website=www.psychologicalscience.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Oliver|date=2018-01-19|title=Two decades of cognitive bias research in entrepreneurship: What do we know and where do we go from here?|journal=Management Review Quarterly|language=en|volume=68|issue=2|pages=107–143|doi=10.1007/s11301-018-0135-9|issn=2198-1620}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are often controversies about how to classify these biases or how to explain them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dougherty |first1=M. R. P. |last2=Gettys |first2=C. F. |last3=Ogden |first3=E. E. |year=1999 |title=MINERVA-DM: A memory processes model for judgments of likelihood |url=http://www.bsos.umd.edu/psyc/dougherty/PDF%20articles/Dougherty,Gettys&amp;Ogden,1999.pdf|journal=Psychological Review |volume=106 |issue=1|pages=180–209 |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.106.1.180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some are effects of information-processing rules (i.e., mental shortcuts), called ''[[heuristics]]'', that the brain uses to produce [[Decision-making|decisions]] or judgments. Biases have a variety of forms and appear as cognitive ("cold") bias, such as mental noise,&lt;ref name="HilbertPsychBull" /&gt; or motivational ("hot") bias, such as when beliefs are distorted by [[wishful thinking]]. Both effects can be present at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.259 |last=Maccoun |first=Robert J. |year=1998|title=Biases in the interpretation and use of research results |journal=Annual Review of Psychology|pmid=15012470 |volume=49 |pages=259–87 |url=http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~maccoun/MacCoun_AnnualReview98.pdf |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nickerson |first=Raymond S. |authorlink=Raymond S. Nickerson |year=1998|title=Confirmation Bias: A Ubiquitous Phenomenon in Many Guises |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=175–220 [198]|issn=1089-2680 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.2.2.175|url=http://psy2.ucsd.edu/~mckenzie/nickersonConfirmationBias.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also controversies over some of these biases as to whether they count as useless or [[irrationality|irrational]], or whether they result in useful attitudes or behavior. For example, when getting to know others, people tend to ask [[leading question]]s which seem biased towards confirming their assumptions about the person. However, this kind of [[confirmation bias]] has also been argued to be an example of [[social skills|social skill]]: a way to establish a connection with the other person.&lt;ref name="dardenne"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dardenne |first=Benoit |first2=Jacques-Philippe |last2=Leyens|title=Confirmation Bias as a Social Skill |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=1995 |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=1229–1239 |doi=10.1177/01461672952111011|issn=1552-7433|url=http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/handle/2268/28639 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this research overwhelmingly involves human subjects, some findings that demonstrate bias have been found in non-human animals as well. For example, [[hyperbolic discounting]] has been observed in rats, pigeons, and monkeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alexander|first=William H.|author2=Brown, Joshua W. |title=Hyperbolically Discounted Temporal Difference Learning|journal=Neural Computation|date=1 June 2010|volume=22|issue=6|pages=1511–1527|doi=10.1162/neco.2010.08-09-1080|pmc=3005720|pmid=20100071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision-making, belief, and behavioral biases==
Many of these biases affect belief formation, business and economic decisions, and human behavior in general.

==Memory errors and biases==
{{main|List of memory biases}}
In [[psychology]] ''and'' [[cognitive science]], a memory bias is a [[cognitive bias]] that either enhances or impairs the recall of a [[memory]] (either the chances that the memory will be recalled at all, or the amount of time it takes for it to be recalled, or both), or that alters the content of a reported memory. There are many types of memory bias, including:

|-
| [[cue-dependent forgetting|Context effect]]

|-
| [[Cross-race effect]]
| The tendency for people of one race to have difficulty identifying members of a race other than their own.
|-
| [[Cryptomnesia]]
| A form of [[Misattribution of memory|''misattribution'']] where a memory is mistaken for imagination, because there is no subjective experience of it being a memory.&lt;ref name="schacter"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schacter|first= Daniel L. |year=1999|title=The Seven Sins of Memory: Insights From Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience|journal=American Psychologist|volume=54|issue=3 |pages=182–203|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.54.3.182|pmid=10199218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, consider a list of 30 items ("L30") and a list of 100 items ("L100"). An individual may remember 15 items from L30, or 50%, whereas the individual may remember 40 items from L100, or 40%. Although the percent of L30 items remembered (50%) is greater than the percent of L100 (40%), more L100 items (40) are remembered than L30 items (15).&lt;ref name=memcog&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kinnell |first1=Angela |last2=Dennis |first2=S. |date=2011 |title=The list length effect in recognition memory: an analysis of potential confounds |journal=Memory &amp; Cognition |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=348–63 |doi=10.3758/s13421-010-0007-6|pmid=21264573 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Further explanation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Common theoretical causes of some cognitive biases==
* [[Bounded rationality]] – limits on optimization and rationality
** [[Prospect theory]]
** [[Mental accounting]]
** [[Adaptive bias]] – basing decisions on limited information and biasing them based on the costs of being wrong
* [[Attribute substitution]] – making a complex, difficult judgment by unconsciously substituting it by an easier judgment&lt;ref name="revisited"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |author2=Shane Frederick |title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment |editor=Thomas Gilovich |editor2=Dale Griffin |editor3=Daniel Kahneman |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages=49–81 |chapter=Representativeness Revisited: Attribute Substitution in Intuitive Judgment |isbn=978-0-521-79679-8 |oclc=47364085}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Attribution theory]]
** [[Salience (neuroscience)|Salience]]
** [[Naïve realism (psychology)|Naïve realism]]
* [[Cognitive dissonance]], and related:
** [[Impression management]]
** [[Self-perception theory]]
* [[Heuristics in judgment and decision making]], including:
** [[Availability heuristic]] – estimating what is more likely by what is more available in memory, which is biased toward vivid, unusual, or emotionally charged examples&lt;ref name="h_and_b" /&gt;
** [[Representativeness heuristic]] – judging probabilities on the basis of resemblance&lt;ref name="h_and_b"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tversky |first=Amos |author2=Daniel Kahneman |date=September 27, 1974 |title=Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases |journal=Science |volume=185 |issue=4157 |pages=1124–1131 |pmid=17835457 |doi=10.1126/science.185.4157.1124 |bibcode=1974Sci...185.1124T }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Affect heuristic]] – basing a decision on an emotional reaction rather than a calculation of risks and benefits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Slovic |first=Paul |author2=Melissa Finucane |author3=Ellen Peters |author4=Donald G. MacGregor |chapter=The Affect Heuristic |pages=397–420 |editor=Thomas Gilovich |editor2=Dale Griffin |editor3=Daniel Kahneman |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment |isbn=978-0-521-79679-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some theories of [[emotion]] such as:
** [[Two-factor theory of emotion]]
** [[Somatic markers hypothesis]]
* [[Introspection illusion]]
* Misinterpretations or [[misuse of statistics]]; [[innumeracy]].

A 2012 ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]'' article suggested that at least eight seemingly unrelated biases can be produced by the same [[information-theoretic]] generative mechanism that assumes noisy information processing during storage and retrieval of information in human memory.&lt;ref name="HilbertPsychBull"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Martin Hilbert|year=2012|url=http://www.martinhilbert.net/HilbertPsychBull.pdf|layurl=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2011-27261-001|title=Toward a synthesis of cognitive biases: How noisy information processing can bias human decision making|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=138|issue=2|pages= 211–237|doi=10.1037/a0025940|pmid=22122235|citeseerx=10.1.1.432.8763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual differences in decision making biases==
People do appear to have stable individual differences in their susceptibility to decision biases such as [[Overconfidence effect|overconfidence]], [[temporal discounting]], and [[bias blind spot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bias Blind Spot: Structure, Measurement, and Consequences|journal = Management Science|date = 2015-04-24|doi = 10.1287/mnsc.2014.2096|first = Irene|last = Scopelliti|first2 = Carey K.|last2 = Morewedge|first3 = Erin|last3 = McCormick|first4 = H. Lauren|last4 = Min|first5 = Sophie|last5 = Lebrecht|first6 = Karim S.|last6 = Kassam|volume=61|issue = 10|pages=2468–2486}}&lt;/ref&gt; That said, these stable levels of bias within individuals are possible to change. Participants in experiments who watched training videos and played debiasing games showed medium to large reductions both immediately and up to three months later in the extent to which they exhibited susceptibility to six cognitive biases: [[anchoring]], bias blind spot, [[confirmation bias]], [[fundamental attribution error]], [[projection bias]], and [[Representativeness heuristic|representativeness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Debiasing Decisions Improved Decision Making With a Single Training Intervention|url = http://bbs.sagepub.com/content/2/1/129|journal = Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date = 2015-10-01|issn = 2372-7322|pages = 129–140|volume = 2|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/2372732215600886|first = Carey K.|last = Morewedge|first2 = Haewon|last2 = Yoon|first3 = Irene|last3 = Scopelliti|first4 = Carl W.|last4 = Symborski|first5 = James H.|last5 = Korris|first6 = Karim S.|last6 = Kassam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debiasing==
[[Debiasing]] is the reduction of biases in judgment and decision making through incentives, nudges, and training. [[Cognitive bias mitigation]] and [[cognitive bias modification]] are forms of debiasing specifically applicable to cognitive biases and their effects. [[Reference class forecasting]] is a method for systematically debiasing estimates and decisions, based on what [[Daniel Kahneman]] has dubbed the [[outside view]].

The '''Matthew effect''', '''Matthew principle''', or '''Matthew effect of accumulated advantage''' can be observed in many aspects of life and fields of activity. It is sometimes summarized by the adage "[[the rich get richer and the poor get poorer]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The term was coined by sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] in 1968&lt;ref name=Merton1968/&gt; and takes its name from the [[Parable of the talents or minas]] in the biblical [[Gospel of Matthew]].  Merton credited his collaborator and wife, sociologist [[Harriet Zuckerman]], as co-author of the concept of the Matthew effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/merton/matthewii.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The concept is named according to two of the [[Parables of Jesus]] in the [[synoptic Gospels]] (Table 2, of the [[Eusebian Canons]]).

The concept concludes both synoptic versions of the [[Parable of the talents or minas|parable of the talents]]:

{{quote|For to every one who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.|[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 25:29, [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]].|source=}}

{{quote|I tell you, that to every one who has will more be given; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.|[[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 19:26, [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]].|source=}}

The concept concludes two of the three synoptic versions of the parable of the [[lamp under a bushel]] (absent in the version of Matthew):

{{quote|For to him who has will more be given; and from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away|[[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 4:25, [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]].|source=}}

{{quote|Take heed then how you hear; for to him who has will more be given, and from him who has not, even what he thinks that he has will be taken away.|[[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 8:18, [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]].|source=}}

The concept is presented again in Matthew outside of a parable during [[Jesus|Christ]]'s explanation to his disciples of the purpose of parables:

{{quote|And he answered them, "To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. For to him who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away."|[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 13:11–12, [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]].|source=}}

==Sociology of science==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Scientific misconduct]] --&gt;
In the [[sociology of science]], "Matthew effect" was a term coined by [[Robert K. Merton]] to describe how, among other things, eminent scientists will often get more credit than a comparatively unknown researcher, even if their work is similar; it also means that credit will usually be given to researchers who are already famous.&lt;ref name=Merton1968&gt;{{cite journal |author=Merton, Robert K. |year=1968 |url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/merton/matthew1.pdf |title=The Matthew Effect in Science |journal=Science |volume=159 |issue=3810 |pages=56–63 |doi=10.1126/science.159.3810.56 |pmid=17737466|bibcode=1968Sci...159...56M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Merton | first1 = Robert K | year = 1988 | title = The Matthew Effect in Science, II: Cumulative advantage and the symbolism of intellectual property | url = http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/merton/matthewii.pdf| journal = ISIS | volume = 79 | issue = | pages = 606–623 | doi=10.1086/354848}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a prize will almost always be awarded to the most senior researcher involved in a project, even if all the work was done by a [[graduate student]].  This was later formulated by [[Stephen Stigler]] as [[Stigler's law of eponymy]]&amp;nbsp;– "No scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer"&amp;nbsp; – with Stigler explicitly naming Merton as the true discoverer, making his "law" an example of itself.

Merton furthermore argued that in the scientific community the Matthew effect reaches beyond simple reputation to influence the wider communication system, playing a part in social selection processes and resulting in a concentration of resources and talent.  He gave as an example the disproportionate visibility given to articles from acknowledged authors, at the expense of equally valid or superior articles written by unknown authors.  He also noted that the concentration of attention on eminent individuals can lead to an increase in their self-assurance, pushing them to perform research in important but risky problem areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/159/3810/56 Abstract of Merton's 1968 paper] "The Matthew Effect in Science".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
{{Original research|section|date=January 2012}}
As [[Credit (creative arts)|credit]] is valued in science, specific claims of the Matthew effect are contentious.  Many examples below exemplify more famous scientists getting credit for discoveries due to their fame, even as other less notable scientists had preempted their work.

* In [[algorithmic information theory]], the notion of [[Kolmogorov complexity]] is named after the famous mathematician [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] even though it was [[independently discovered]] and published by [[Ray Solomonoff]] a year before Kolmogorov.  Li and Vitanyi, in "An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications" (p.&amp;nbsp;84), write:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

: Ray Solomonoff  [...] introduced [what is now known as] "Kolmogorov complexity"  in a long journal paper in 1964.  [...] This makes Solomonoff the first inventor and raises the question whether we should talk about Solomonoff complexity. [...]

* There are many uncontroversial examples of the Matthew effect in mathematics, where a concept is due to one mathematician (and well-documented as such), but is attributed to a later (possibly much later), more famous mathematician who worked on it. For instance, the [[Poincaré disk model]] and [[Poincaré half-plane model]] of [[hyperbolic space]] are both named for [[Henri Poincaré]], but were introduced by [[Eugenio Beltrami]] in 1868 (when Poincaré was 14 and had not as yet contributed to hyperbolic geometry).
* A  model for career progress quantitatively incorporates the Matthew Effect in order to predict the distribution of individual career length in competitive professions. The model predictions are validated by analyzing the empirical distributions of career length for careers in science and professional sports (e.g. [[Major League Baseball]]).&lt;ref name=Petersen2011&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Petersen |first=Alexander M. |author2=Jung, Woo-Sung |author3=Yang, Jae-Suk |author4=Stanley, H.

* In his 2011 book ''[[The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined]]'', [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologist]] [[Steven Pinker]] refers to the Matthew Effect in societies, whereby everything seems to go right in some, and wrong in others. He speculates in Chapter 9 that this could be the result of a positive feedback loop in which reckless behavior by some individuals creates a chaotic environment that encourages reckless behavior by others. He cites research by [[Martin Daly]] and [[Margo Wilson]] showing that the more unstable the environment, the more steeply people discount the future, and thus the less forward-looking their behavior.
* A large Matthew effect was discovered in a study of science funding in the Netherlands, where winners just above the funding threshold were found to accumulate more than twice as much funding during the subsequent eight years as non-winners with near-identical review scores that fell just below the threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bol | first1 = T. | last2 = de Vaan | first2 = M. | last3 = van de Rijt | first3 = A. | year = 2018 | title = The Matthew Effect in Science Funding | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/19/4887.full.pdf | format = PDF | journal = PNAS | volume = 115 | issue = 19 | pages = 4887–4890 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In science, dramatic differences in the productivity may be explained by three phenomena: sacred spark, cumulative advantage, and search costs minimization by journal editors. The sacred spark paradigm suggests that scientists differ in their initial abilities, talent, skills, persistence, work habits, etc. that provide particular individuals with an early advantage. These factors have a multiplicative effect which helps these scholars succeed later. The cumulative advantage model argues that an initial success helps a researcher gain access to resources (e.g., teaching release, best graduate students, funding, facilities, etc.), which in turn results in further success. Search costs minimization by journal editors takes place when editors try to save time and effort by consciously or subconsciously selecting articles from well-known scholars. Whereas the exact mechanism underlying these phenomena is yet unknown, it is documented that a minority of all academics produce the most research output and attract the most citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Serenko | first1 = A. | last2 = Cox | first2 = R. | last3 = Bontis | first3 = N. | last4 = Booker | first4 = L. | year = 2011 | title = The Superstar Phenomenon in the Knowledge Management and Intellectual Capital Academic Discipline | url = http://www.aserenko.com/papers/JOI_Serenko_Superstar_Phenomenon_Published.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Informetrics | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 333–345 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
In education, the term "Matthew effect" has been adopted by psychologist [[Keith Stanovich]] to describe a phenomenon observed in research on how new readers acquire the skills to read: early success in acquiring reading skills usually leads to later successes in reading as the learner grows, while failing to learn to read before the third or fourth year of schooling may be indicative of lifelong problems in learning new skills.

This is because children who fall behind in reading would read less, increasing the gap between them and their peers. Later, when students need to "read to learn" (where before they were learning to read), their reading difficulty creates difficulty in most other subjects. In this way they fall further and further behind in school, dropping out at a much higher rate than their peers.

In the words of Stanovich:
{{quote|Slow reading acquisition has cognitive, behavioral, and motivational consequences that slow the development of other cognitive skills and inhibit performance on many academic tasks. In short, as reading develops, other cognitive processes linked to it track the level of reading skill. Knowledge bases that are in reciprocal relationships with reading are also inhibited from further development. The longer this developmental sequence is allowed to continue, the more generalized the deficits will become, seeping into more and more areas of cognition and behavior. Or to put it more simply&amp;nbsp;– and sadly&amp;nbsp;– in the words of a tearful nine-year-old, already falling frustratingly behind his peers in reading progress, "Reading affects everything you do."&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Marilyn J. (1990).'' Beginning to Read: Thinking and Learning about Print''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Network science ==
In network science, the Matthew effect is used to describe the [[preferential attachment]] of earlier nodes in a network, which explains that these nodes tend to attract more links early on.&lt;ref name="Barabasi1999"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barabási|first=A-L|year=1999|title=Emergence of scaling in random networks|journal=Science|volume=286|pages=509–512|doi=10.1126/science.286.5439.509|pmc=|pmid=10521342|quote=|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|authorlink=|author2=Albert, R|accessdate=|arxiv=cond-mat/9910332|bibcode=1999Sci...286..509B}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Because of preferential attachment, a node that acquires more connections than another one will increase its connectivity at a higher rate, and thus an initial difference in the connectivity between two nodes will increase further as the network grows, while the degree of individual nodes will grow proportional with the square root of time."&lt;ref name="Perc2014"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perc|first=Matjaž|year=2014|title=The Matthew effect in empirical data|url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/11/98/20140378|journal=Interface|volume=12|issue=104|pages=20140378|doi=10.1098/rsif.2014.0378|pmc=|pmid=|quote=|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|authorlink=|accessdate=|arxiv=1408.5124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Matthew Effect therefore explains the growth of some nodes in vast networks such as the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Networks, Complexity And Internet Regulation – Scale-Free Law|last=Guadamuz|first=Andres|date=2011|publisher=Edward Elgar|isbn=9781848443105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Markets with social influence ==
Product recommendations and information about past purchases have been shown{{by whom?|date=September 2018}} to influence consumers' choices significantly - whether for music, movie, book, technological, and other types of products. Social influence often induces a rich-get-richer phenomenon where popular products tend to become even more popular.&lt;ref name="altszyler2017"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4019">'''Mortido''' is a term used in [[Freudian theory|Freudian]] [[psychoanalysis]] to refer to the energy of the [[death drive|death instinct]], formed on analogy to the term [[libido]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Rycroft, ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (London 1995) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the early 21st century, the term has been used more rarely, but still designates the destructive side of psychic energy.&lt;ref&gt;Jadran Mimica, ''Explorations in Psychoanalytic Ethnography'' (2007) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins: Federn==

Mortido was introduced by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s pupil [[Paul Federn]] to cover the psychic energy of the death instinct, something left open by Freud himself:&lt;ref&gt;[[Salman Akhtar]], ''Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (2009) p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edoardo Weiss]] preferred  to use [[destrudo]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (Middlesex 1976), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Providing what he saw as clinical proof of the reality of the death instinct in 1930, Federn reported on the self-destructive tendencies of severely melancholic patients as evidence of what he would later call inwardly-directed mortido.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Alexander et al, ''Psychoanalytic Pioneers'' (1995) p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Freud himself favoured neither term – mortido or destrudo. This worked against either of them gaining widespread popularity in the psychoanalytic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Akhtar, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eric Berne==
{{Main|Eric Berne}}
Eric Berne, who was a pupil of Federn's, made extensive use of the term mortido in his pre-[[transactional analysis]] study, ''The Mind in Action'' (1947). As he wrote in the Foreword to the third edition of 1967, "the historical events of the last thirty years...become much clearer by introducing Paul Federn's concept of mortido".&lt;ref&gt;Berne, ''A Layman's Guide'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; 

Berne saw mortido as activating such forces as hate and cruelty, blinding anger and social hostilities;&lt;ref&gt;Berne, ''A Layman's Guide'', p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; and considered that inwardly directed mortido underlay the phenomena of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and self-punishment, as well as their clinical exacerbations in the form of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or melancholia.&lt;ref&gt;Berne, ''A Layman's Guide'' p. 95 and p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

Berne saw sexual acts as gratifying mortido at the same time as libido; and recognised that on occasion the former becomes more important sexually than the latter, as in [[sadomasochism]] and destructive emotional relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Berne, ''A Layman's Guide'' p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Berne's concern with the role of mortido in individuals and groups, social formations and nations, arguably continued throughout all his later writings.&lt;ref&gt;Petrushka Clarkson, ''Transactional Analysis Psychotherapy'' (1993) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laplanche and the death drive==

[[Jean Laplanche]] has explored repeatedly the question of mortido,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/destrudo Bernard Golse "Destrudo"]&lt;/ref&gt; and of how far a distinctive instinct of destruction can be identified in parallel to the forces of libido.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Laplanche/John Fletcher, ''Essays on Otherness'' (1999) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wider applications==

The importance for the individual of integrating mortido in their life, as opposed to [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]] it off and disowning it, has been taken up by figures like [[Robert Bly]] in the men's movement.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Tudor, in B. J. Brother, ''Power and Partnership'' (1995) p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been applied in contemporary expositions of the [[Cabbala]].&lt;ref&gt;Z. B. S. Halevi, ''Introduction to the Cabbala'' (1991) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[American comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]], a '''mutant''' is a human being that possesses a [[genetics|genetic trait]] called the X-gene. It causes the mutant to  develop [[Superpower (ability)|superhuman powers]] that manifest at [[puberty]]. Human mutants are sometimes referred to as a human subspecies '''''Homo sapiens superior,''''' or simply '''''Homo superior.''''' Mutants are the [[evolution]]ary progeny of ''Homo sapiens'', and are generally assumed to be the next stage in [[human evolution]].  The accuracy of this is the subject of much debate in the [[Marvel Universe]].

Unlike Marvel's [[Mutate (comics)|mutates]], which are characters who develop their powers only after exposure to outside stimuli or energies (such as the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Spider-Man]], [[The Fantastic Four]], and [[Absorbing Man]]), mutants have actual [[Mutation|genetic mutations]].

==Background==
A March 1952 story in ''Amazing Detective Cases'' #11 called "The Weird Woman" tells of a woman describing herself as a mutant who seeks a similarly superhuman mate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/weirdwomanadc.htm |title="Weird Woman" (1950s, Amazing Detective Case) |publisher=Marvunapp.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Carstairs, a mutant who can create illusions, is shown in ''Man Comics'' #28, dated September 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix5/carstairsrogermm.htm |title=Roger Carstairs (Bob Brant &amp; the Trouble-Shooters foe) |publisher=Marvunapp.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A character with superhuman powers, born from a radiation-exposed parent, was seen in "The Man with the Atomic Brain!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/lestrontedjim.htm |title=Ted Lestron (pre-FF mutant) |publisher=Marvunapp.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #52 in May 1959; although not specifically called a "mutant", his origin is consistent with one.

A little-known story in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #6 (November 1959) titled "The Mutants and Me!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/farnsworthvincenttos.htm |title=Vincent Farnsworth (Pre-FF mutant, Tales of Suspense) |publisher=Marvunapp.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first Marvel (then known as [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas]]) stories to feature a named "mutant".

Tad Carter,  a mutant with [[telekinetic]] powers, is shown in Amazing Adult Fantasy #14, dated July 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix6/carter-tad.htm|title=Tad Carter (Promise member)|publisher=Marvunapp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern concept of mutants as an independent subspecies was created and utilized by Marvel editor/writer [[Stan Lee]] in the early 1960s, as a means to create a large number of [[superhero]]es and [[supervillain]]s without having to think of a separate origin for each one. As part of the concept, Lee decided that these mutant teenagers should, like ordinary ones, attend school in order to better cope with the world, in this case [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]]. These mutants first appeared in the superhero series ''X-Men'', which debuted in 1963. Marvel later introduced several additional mutant superhero teams, including [[New Mutants|The New Mutants]], [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], [[X-Force]], and [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]].

Officially, [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] is considered the first mutant superhero whom Marvel Comics ever published,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvine.com/namor/29-1476/ |title=Namor |publisher=comicvine.com |date=1922-02-22 |accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; debuting in [[1939 in comics|1939]]. However, Namor was not actually described as a mutant until decades after his first appearance. The same is true of [[Toro (comics)|Toro]], partner of the [[Human Torch (android)|android Human Torch]] introduced in 1940.

===Omega-level mutants===
&lt;!-- The list that is currently present is sufficient for the purposes of this article. Please do NOT add characters, even if a reference is supplied. --&gt;
An '''Omega-level mutant''' is one with the most powerful genetic potential of their mutant abilities. The term was first seen in the 1986 issue ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #208, but was completely unexplained beyond the obvious implication of it referring to an exceptional level of power. The term was not seen again until the 2001 limited series ''[[X-Men Forever]]''. Some abilities depicted by mutants described as Omega-level include [[immortality]], reality warping, highly destructive energy projection, extreme manipulation of [[matter]], [[energy]], [[time]] and [[space]], high [[psionic]] ability with strong [[telepathy]] and [[telekinesis]], and the potential to exist beyond the boundaries of the known physical universe. No firm definition has been offered in comics. Examples of mutants that have been confirmed as Omega-level include [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[X-Men: The 198]]'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Grey]],&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Forever'' by [[Professor X]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hyperstorm]], [[Nate Grey]], [[Stryfe]], [[Mister M (comics)|Mister M]], [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], [[Quentin Quire]],&lt;ref name="New X-Men #137"&gt;''New X-Men'' #137 (April 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]],&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men: Deadly Genesis'' by [[Emma Frost]], ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #477&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rachel Summers]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #207 by [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iceman (character)|Iceman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=17883 |title=Carey on "Manifest Destiny" and "X-Men Origins: Beast" |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=2008-08-28 |accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]], [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]],&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' vol. 3 #4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Mutants]]'' v2. by Christina Weir&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Psylocke]].&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=35905 |title=COMMENTARY TRACK: "Uncanny X-Force" #18 with Rick Remender |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date= |accessdate=2013-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''"Homo superior superior"''===
Introduced in [[Chris Claremont]]'s ''X-Treme X-Men'', a character known as [[Vargas (comics)|Vargas]] claims to be humanity's natural response to mutants.  Vargas was born at the epitome of peak physical skill, having superhuman levels of strength, speed, reflexes, agility, stamina, and durability.  Vargas also seems to be immune to various mutant abilities (such as Rogue's absorption and Psylocke's telekinetic blast).&lt;ref&gt;X-Treme X-Men #2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Externals===
Created by [[Rob Liefeld]], [[Externals]] are immortal mutants whose powers have allowed them to exist for centuries. Eventually, most of the Externals are killed by [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]. [[Gideon (comics)|Gideon]], Selene, and [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] are examples of Externals.

===Cheyarafim and Neyaphem===
Cheyarafim and Neyaphem first appear in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #429. According to the character [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]], the Cheyarafim are a group of [[angel]]-like mutants who were the traditional enemies of the Neyaphem, a demonic-looking group of mutants who lived in [[Biblical]] times. The Cheyarafim were [[Fanaticism|fanatic]]s who had a strict, absolutist view of morality which led them into conflict with the Neyaphem. This escalated into a [[religious war|holy war]], causing the Neyaphem to be exiled into an alternate dimension. What happened to the Cheyarafim after this has not been revealed.

The X-Man [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] is said to be descended from Cheyarafim,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} while [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] is supposedly the son of a Neyaphem, Azazel. It is unknown if Joshua Guthrie, known as [[Icarus (comics)|Icarus]], is a descendant of the Cheyarafim.

===Dominant Species/lupine===
[[Maximus Lobo]] claims to be a part of a mutant sub-species of feral, wolf-like mutants, whom he calls the Dominant Species. He later tries to recruit [[Wolf Cub (comics)|Wolf Cub]] into his ranks, to no avail.  A few years later, another mutant, [[Romulus (comics)|Romulus]], claims that some human mutants evolved from canines instead of primates. Mutants who are a part of this group include Romulus, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Daken]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]], [[Thornn (comics)|Thornn]], [[Feral (comics)|Feral]], and [[Wolf Cub (comics)|Wolf Cub]], with [[X-23]] and the [[Native (comics)|Native]] as other likely candidates. These groups appear to be one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=1125 |title=Uncanny X-Men Vol. 2: Dominant Species | work = Marvel Comics Catalog |publisher=Marvel.com |date= 21 May 2003 |accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changelings===
Introduced in the second series of ''X-Factor'', a '''changeling''' is a mutant whose powers manifest at birth.  Jamie Madrox ([[Multiple Man]]) and [[Damian Tryp]] are examples of this sub-class.

===Extraterrestrial mutants===
Humans are not the only species to have mutant subspecies.  [[Ariel (comics)|Ariel]], [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Longshot]], [[Cerise (comics)|Cerise]], [[Ultra Girl]], and [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]] are examples of mutant aliens.

==Mutants as metaphor==
{{Main|X-Men#Reflecting social issues}}
As a fictional [[oppression|oppressed]] [[minority group|minority]], mutants are often used as extended [[metaphor]]s for real-world people and situations. In 1982, ''X-Men'' writer [[Chris Claremont]] said, "[mutants] are hated, feared and despised collectively by humanity for no other reason than that they are mutants. So what we have here, intended or not, is a book that is about racism, bigotry and prejudice."{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

[[Danny Fingeroth]] writes extensively in his book ''Superman on the Couch'' about the appeal of mutants and their meaning to society:

{{quote|The most popular pop culture franchises are those that make the viewer/reader feel special and unique, while simultaneously making him or her feel he or she is part of a mass of people experiencing and enjoying the same phenomenon. The plight of the mutants is universally compelling. Many people feel a need for a surrogate family, one composed of those the world has abused and persecuted in the same way they have been their whole life. This is especially true in adolescents, which may in part explain some of the draw of mutants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Danny Fingeroth|Fingeroth, Danny]].

An obvious parallel between homosexuality and mutation is drawn in the feature film ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', where [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]]'s mother asks, "Have you tried ''not'' being a mutant?"  This question (or various forms thereof) is common among parents who find out their children are [[gay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=M/C Journal: Have You Tried Not Being a Mutant?  |url=http://journal.media-culture.org.au/0710/10-mantle.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The X-Men "Come out:" Being a "Mutant" in films can be seen as a metaphor for homosexuality  |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12956661/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 film ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'', Hank McCoy (later known as [[Beast (X-Men)|Beast]]), upon being outed to a colleague as a mutant, responds, "[[Don't Ask Don't Tell|You didn't ask, so I didn't tell.]]"


In his article ''Super Heroes, a Modern Mythology'', Richard Reynolds writes:

{{quote|Much of the appeal and draw of the mutants that comprise the [[X-Men]] has to do with feeling like an outcast while simultaneously feeling like part of a family. Mutants are ostracized because they are different but they bound together because of their differences. They may be forced together to a certain extent like 'real' families but they are also a team. They differ from other teams such as the [[Justice League]], which is like a meritocracy; only the best of the best join that team. In contrast, the X-Men is composed of outcasts. They train and nurture one another and are united by common goals and beliefs. ...the whole theme of the X-Men — the isolation of mutants and their alienation from 'normal' society — may be read as a parable of the alienation of any minority... of a minority grouping determined to force its own place within society.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}}}

===Earth X===
Within the ''[[Earth X]]'' universe, the powers of the vast majority of Marvel's human superheroes were revealed to have been the result of genetic manipulation by the [[Celestials]] millions of years in the past.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe within the pages of the ''[[Ultimate Origins]]'' #1, it is revealed that super-powered "mutants" were artificially created via [[genetic modification]] by the [[Weapon X]] program in a laboratory in [[Alberta]], [[Canada]] in October 1943. The project was an attempt to produce a [[supersoldier]], inspired by the existence of [[Captain America]]. [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Ultimate Marvel|James Howlett]] was the first individual to be so modified. At some later point, possibly during a confrontation between Magneto and his parents, the mutant trigger was released into the environment worldwide, leading to the appearance of mutants in the general population. Following the events of the ''[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]'' storyline, information concerning the origins of mutancy was made public and steps were taken in the US to make being a mutant illegal. While the move apparently has majority support among the non-mutant population, a vocal minority has voiced concern that it will lead to witch-hunts and genocide.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Origins'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Déniz Acosta''' (born 1964, Santa Brígida, [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]], [[Canary Islands]], Spain) is a Spanish interdisciplinary artist who has developed art projects and experiences ranging from the objectual art to [[installation art]], from [[art photography]] to [[video art]], cultivating [[art intervention]], [[performance art]], [[visual poetry]] and [[graphic design]].

==Biography==
In 1998 inaugurated the project ''La Puente'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SirocoFactory#p/u/0/edEfA9x4vgY&amp;feature=related |title=Ayoze .O´Shanahan |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; which represents a turning point in his work, opening channels of communication and artistic action by launching bottles at the height of the [[zero meridian]] message wrapper made by different artists. 
In 2002 his first exhibition in the Hall of San Antonio Abad from Centro Atlántico de Arte Moderno, CAAM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caam.net/en/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330033229/http://www.caam.net/en/index.htm |archivedate=2010-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, presented along the Moroccan artist [[Mounir Fatmi]] the performance ''Power line - Imagen y poder''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/pjdeniz#p/u/11/pnjiAyonpMw&amp;feature=related |title=Pedro Déniz |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Espacio C Contemporary Art, Camargo, Santander.

As part of Performando, meeting of performances held in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria running performance ''Paper Memories''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64h8CR8qdCU&amp;feature=related |title=el papel de la memoria |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; by building a wall through fragments of the press in order to question the information that we relegate the media.
In October 2003, includes a photographic installation called ''Welcome'' in Contemporary African Photography Biennale, 5èmes [[African Photography Encounters|Rencontres Africaines de la Photographie]], Bamako, Mali. The same year, ''Dulce-sal'' exhibits a photographic installation based on migration issues included in the collective project of the Aula del Mestizaje, [[University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]]. The artist Ricardo Basbaum (Brazil), Robin Rhode (South Africa) and Pedro Déniz showed the group exhibition called ''3 Scenarios'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caam.net/es/exposiciones/saa/2005/tresescenarios.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723034154/http://caam.net/es/exposiciones/saa/2005/tresescenarios.htm |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the installation was from March to April in the Hall of San Antonio Abad del Centro Atlántico de Arte Moderno CAAM in 2005.

'''Physical abuse''' is any intentional act causing [[injury]] or [[Physical trauma|trauma]] to another person or [[animal abuse|animal]] by way of bodily contact. In most cases, children are the victims of physical abuse, but adults can also be victims, as in cases of [[domestic violence]] or [[workplace aggression]]. Alternative terms sometimes used include [[assault|physical assault]] or [[physical violence]], and may also include [[sexual abuse]]. Physical abuse may involve more than one abuser, and more than one victim.

==Forms==

Physical abuse means any non-accidental act or behavior causing [[injury]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]], or other physical [[suffering]] or [[bodily harm]]. Abusive acts toward children can often result from parents' attempts at [[child discipline]] through excessive [[corporal punishment]].&lt;ref name=Humane&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110316155856/http://www.americanhumane.org/children/stop-child-abuse/fact-sheets/child-physical-abuse.html "Child physical abuse".] American Humane Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WebMD&gt;Giardino, A.P.; Giardino, E.R. (12 December 2008). [http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/915664-overview "Child Abuse &amp; Neglect: Physical Abuse".] ''WebMD''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

A number of causes of [[Child abuse#Physical abuse|physical abuse against children]] have been identified, the most common of which, according to Mash and Wolfe, being:
*many abusive and neglectful parents have had little exposure to positive parental models and supports.
*there is often a greater degree of stress in the family environment.
*information-processing disturbances may cause maltreating parents to misperceive or mislabel their child's behavior, which leads to inappropriate responses.
*there is often a lack of awareness or understanding of developmentally appropriate expectations.&lt;ref name=Mash /&gt;

==Effects==

Physically abused children are at risk for later interpersonal problems involving aggressive behavior, and adolescents are at a much greater risk for [[substance abuse]]. In addition, symptoms of depression, emotional distress, and [[suicidal ideation]] are also common features of people who have been physically abused. Studies have also shown that children with a history of physical abuse may meet [[DSM-IV-TR]] criteria for [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).&lt;ref name=Mash&gt;{{cite book|last=Mash|first=Eric|title=Abnormal Child Psychology|year=2010|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Belmont,California|isbn=9780495506270|pages=427–463}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many as one-third of children who experience physical abuse are also at risk to become abusive as adults&lt;ref&gt;Oliver JE (1993). Intergenerational transmission of child abuse: rates, research, and clinical implications. Am J Psychiatry, 150(99): 1314-24.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Researchers have pointed to other potential psycho-biological effects of child physical abuse on parenting, when abused children become adults. These recent findings may, at least in part, be carried forward by epigenetic changes that impact the regulation of stress physiology.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Moser DA, Paoloni-Giacobino A, Stenz A, Gex-Fabry M, Aue T, Adouan W, Cordero MI, Suardi F, Manini A, Sancho Rossignol A, Merminod G, Ansermet F, Dayer AG, Rusconi Serpa S (epub May 29, 2015). Methylation of NR3C1 is related to maternal PTSD, parenting stress and maternal medial prefrontal cortical activity in response to child separation among mothers with histories of violence exposure.

Child abuse, depression, and methylation in genes involved with stress, neural plasticity, and brain circuitry. J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry,53(4):417-24.e5. doi: 10.1016/j.jaac.2013.12.025.&lt;/ref&gt; Many other potentially important consequences of childhood physical abuse on adolescent and adult physical and mental health and development have been documented via the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) studies.&lt;ref&gt;Hillis SD, Anda RF, Dube SR, Felitti VJ, Marchbanks PA, Marks JS (2004). The association between adverse childhood experiences and adolescent pregnancy, long-term psychosocial consequences, and fetal death. Pediatrics. 2004 Feb;113(2):320-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==

Seeking treatment is unlikely for a majority of people that are physically abused, and the ones who are seeking treatment are usually under some form of legal constraint. The prevention and treatment options for physically abused children include: enhancing positive experiences early in the development of the parent-child relationship, as well as changing how parents teach, discipline, and attend to their children. 

Evidence-based interventions include [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) as well as video-feedback interventions and child-parent [[psychodynamic psychotherapy]]; all of which specifically target anger patterns and distorted beliefs, and offer training and/or reflection, support, and modelling that focuses on parenting skills and expectations, as well as increasing empathy for the child by supporting the parent's taking the child's perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Kolko, D. J. (1996). Individual cognitive-behavioral treatment and family therapy for physically abused children and their offending parents: A comparison of clinical outcomes. Child Maltreatment, 1, 322-342.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Myers MM, Brunelli SA, Coates SW, Zeanah CH, Davies M, Grienenberger JF, Marshall RD, McCaw JE, Trabka KA, Liebowitz MR (2006). Traumatized mothers can change their minds about their toddlers: Understanding how a novel use of videofeedback supports positive change of maternal attributions. Infant Mental Health Journal, 27(5), 429-448.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lieberman|first=A.F.|year=2007|title=Ghosts and angels: Intergenerational patterns in the transmission and treatment of the traumatic sequelae of domestic violence|journal=Infant Mental Health Journal|volume=28|issue=4|pages=422–439|doi=10.1002/imhj.20145|pmid=28640404}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

These forms of treatment may include training in social competence and management of daily demands in an effort to decrease parental stress, which is a known risk factor for physical abuse. Although these treatment and prevention strategies are to help children and parents of children who have been abused, some of these methods can also be applied to adults who have physically abused.&lt;ref name=Mash/&gt;

==In other animals==

Physical abuse has been described among [[Adélie Penguin|Adélie penguins]] in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/09/sex-depravity-penguins-scott-antarctic|title='Sexual depravity' of penguins that Antarctic scientist dared not reveal|newspaper=Guardian.co.uk|date=9 June 2012|first=Robin|last=McKie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3379">A '''physical disability''' is a limitation on a person's physical functioning, mobility, dexterity or stamina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubsites.uws.edu.au/ndco/employment/what/physical.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 8, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724013228/http://pubsites.uws.edu.au/ndco/employment/what/physical.htm |archivedate=July 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other physical [[disability|disabilities]] include impairments which limit other facets of [[daily living skills|daily living]], such as [[respiratory disease|respiratory disorders]], [[blindness]], [[epilepsy]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19990909103353/http://www.csun.edu/%7Esp20558/dis/physical.html Physical Disabilities, California State University, Northridge]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sleep disorder]]s.

== Causes ==
Prenatal disabilities are acquired before birth. These may be due to diseases or substances that the mother has been exposed to during [[pregnancy]], embryonic or fetal developmental accidents or [[genetic disorder]]s.

Perinatal disabilities are acquired between some weeks before to up to four weeks after birth in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The free dictionary by Farlex|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/perinatal|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These can be due to prolonged [[Perinatal asphyxia|lack of oxygen]] or obstruction of the respiratory tract, damage to the brain during birth (due to the accidental misuse of [[Forceps in childbirth|forceps]], for example) or the baby being born [[Preterm birth|prematurely]]. These may also be caused due to genetic disorders or accidents.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

Post-natal disabilities are gained after birth. They can be due to accidents, [[injuries]], [[obesity]], [[infection]] or other [[illness]]es. These may also be caused due to genetic disorders.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

== Types ==
Mobility impairment includes physical defects, including upper or lower limb loss or impairment, poor [[manual dexterity]], and damage to one or multiple organs of the body. Disability in mobility can be a congenital or acquired problem or a consequence of disease. People who have a broken skeletal structure also fall into this category.

[[Visual impairment]] is another type of physical impairment. There are hundreds of thousands of people who suffer greatly from minor to various serious vision injuries or impairments. These types of injuries can also result in severe problems or diseases such as blindness and ocular trauma. Some other types of vision impairment include scratched [[cornea]], scratches on the [[sclera]], diabetes-related eye conditions, dry eyes and corneal graft, [[macular degeneration]] in old age and retinal detachment.  

[[Hearing loss]] is a partial or total inability to hear. Deaf and hard of hearing people have a rich culture and benefit from learning sign language for communication purposes.{{cn|date=June 2016}} People who are only partially deaf can sometimes make use of [[hearing aid]]s to improve their hearing ability.

Physical impairment can also be attributed to disorders causing, among others, sleep deficiency, chronic fatigue, chronic pain, and seizures.

[http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/05/10/lady_justices_blindfold/ "Lady Justice's blindfold."] ''Boston.com''.  10 May 2009.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A '''principle''' is a concept or value that is a guide for behavior or evaluation. In [[law]], it is a [[Legal rule|rule]] that has to be or usually is to be followed, or can be desirably followed, or is an inevitable consequence of something, such as the laws observed in  nature or the way that a system is constructed. The principles of such a system are understood by its users as the essential characteristics of the system, or reflecting system's designed purpose, and the effective operation or use of which would be impossible if any one of the principles was to be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Alpa, Guido (1994) [http://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/annlsurvey/vol1/iss1/2/ General Principles of Law], ''Annual Survey of International &amp; Comparative Law'', Vol. 1: Is. 1, Article 2. from [[Golden Gate University School of Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; A system may be explicitly based on and implemented from a document of principles as was done in IBM's [[IBM System/360 architecture|360/370]] ''Principles of Operation''.

Examples of principles are, [[entropy (disambiguation)|entropy]] in a number of fields, [[least action]] in physics, those in descriptive comprehensive and fundamental law: [[doctrine]]s or assumptions forming  normative rules of conduct, [[separation of church and state]] in statecraft, the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], [[wikt:fairness|fairness]] in ethics, etc.

In common English, it is a substantive and collective term referring to rule governance, the absence of which, being "unprincipled", is considered a character defect. It may also be used to declare that a reality has diverged from some ideal or norm as when something is said to be true only "in principle" but not in fact.

==As law==
===As moral law===
[[File:Socrates BM GR1973.03-27.16.jpg|thumb|[[Socrates]] preferred to face execution rather than betray his moral principles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/socrates.html "The Ethics of Socrates."] ''Philosophy''.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;|upright=0.9]]
{{main|Ethics}}
A principle represents values that orient and rule the conduct of persons in a particular society.  To "act on principle" is to act in accordance with one's moral ideals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/us/politics/jeff-flake-transcript-senate-speech.html "Full Transcript: Jeff Flake’s Speech on the Senate Floor."] ''New York Times''.  24 October 2017.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Principles are absorbed in childhood through a process of [[socialization]]. There is a presumption of liberty of individuals that is restrained.  Exemplary principles include [[First, do no harm]], the [[golden rule]] and the [[doctrine of the mean]].

===As a juridic law===
{{Main|Principle of legality}}
It represents a set of values that inspire the written norms that organize the life of a society submitting to the powers of an authority, generally the State. The law establishes a legal obligation, in a coercive way; it therefore acts as principle [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]] of the action that limits the liberty of the individuals. See, for examples, the [[territorial principle]], [[homestead principle]], and [[precautionary principle]].

===As scientific law===
[[Archimedes principle]], relating buoyancy to the weight of displaced water, is an early example of a  [[law (principle)|law]] in science. Another early one developed by [[Malthus]] is the ''population principle'', now called the [[Malthusian principle]].&lt;ref&gt;Elwell, Frank W.  [http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/users/f/felwell/www/Theorists/Essays/Malthus1.htm "T. Robert Mathus's Principle ...."] ''Rogers State University''.  2013.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud also wrote on principles, especially the [[reality principle]] necessary to keep the id and [[pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] in check. Biologists use the [[principle of priority]] and [[principle of Binominal nomenclature]] for precision in naming [[species]]. There are many principles observed in physics, notably in [[cosmology]] which observes the [[mediocrity principle]], the [[anthropic principle]], the [[principle of relativity]] and the [[cosmological principle]]. Other well-known principles include the [[uncertainty principle]] in [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[pigeonhole principle]] and [[superposition principle]] in mathematics.

==As axiom or logical fundament==
===Principle of sufficient reason===
{{Main|Principle of sufficient reason}}
The principle states that every event has a rational explanation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sufficient-reason/ "Principle of Sufficient Reason."] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.  7 September 2016.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has a variety of expressions, all of which are perhaps best summarized by the following:

:For every entity ''x'', if ''x'' exists, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''x'' exists.
:For every event ''e'', if ''e'' occurs, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''e'' occurs.
:For every proposition ''p'', if ''p'' is true, then there is a sufficient explanation for why ''p'' is true.

However, one realizes that in every sentence there is a direct relation between the predicate and the subject. To say that "the Earth is round", corresponds to a direct relation between the subject and the predicate.

===Principle of non-contradiction===
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bust (sculpture)|Portrait bust]] of Aristotle; an [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]] copy of a lost [[bronze sculpture]] made by [[Lysippos]]]]
{{Main|Law of noncontradiction}}
According to [[Aristotle]], “It is impossible for the same thing to belong and not to belong at the same time to the same thing and in the same respect.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-noncontradiction/ "Aristotle on Non-contradiction."] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.  12 June 2015.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is not possible that in exactly the same moment and place, it rains and doesn't rain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl201/modules/Philosophers/Aristotle/aristotle_laws_of_thought.html "Great Philosophers."] ''Oregon State University''.  2002.  25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principle of excluded middle===
{{Main|Law of excluded middle}}
The principle of the excluding third or "principium tertium exclusum" is a principle of the traditional logic formulated canonically by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] as: either ''A'' is ''B'' or ''A'' isn't ''B''. It is read the following way: either ''P'' is true, or its denial ¬''P'' is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/AAT3201.0001.001|title=Principia mathematica, by Alfred North Whitehead ... and Bertrand Russell.|last=Whitehead|first=Alfred North|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also known as "''tertium non datur''" ('A third (thing) is not). Classically it is considered to be one of the most important fundamental principles or laws of thought (along with the principles of identity, no contradiction and sufficient reason).

A '''prisoner''', (also known as an '''inmate''' or '''detainee''') is a person who is deprived of liberty against his or her will. This can be by confinement, captivity, or by forcible restraint. The term applies particularly to serving a [[prison sentence]] in a [[prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prisoner |title=Prisoner - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term does not apply to [[Defendant#Criminal defendants|defendants]] who are [[pre-trial]].

==English law==
"Prisoner" is a legal term for a person who is [[Imprisonment|imprisoned]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Rastell]]. [[Termes de la Ley]]. 1636. Page 202. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nm5MAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA4-PA202-IA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Digital copy] from [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In section 1 of the [[Prison Security Act 1992]], the word "prisoner" means any person for the time being in a [[Prison#United Kingdom|prison]] as a result of any requirement imposed by a court or otherwise that he be detained in [[legal custody]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Prison Security Act 1992]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/25/section/1 section 1(6)]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Prisoner" was a legal term for a person prosecuted for [[felony]]. It was not applicable to a person prosecuted for [[misdemeanour]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Owen Hood Phillips|O. Hood Phillips]]. A First Book of English Law. [[Sweet and Maxwell]]. Fourth Edition. 1960. Page 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The abolition of the distinction between felony and misdemeanour by section 1 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]] has rendered this distinction obsolete.

Glanville Williams described as "invidious" the practice of using the term "prisoner" in reference to a person who had not been convicted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Glanville Williams]]. [[Learning the Law]]. Eleventh Edition. Stevens. 1982. Page 3, note 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Cornelis De Wael - To Visit the Imprisoned - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|230px|''To Visit the Imprisoned'' by Flemish artist [[Cornelis de Wael]] c. 1640]]
The earliest evidence of the existence of the prisoner dates back to 8,000 BC from prehistoric graves in [[Lower Egypt]]. This evidence suggests that people from [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] enslaved a [[Bushmen|San]]-like tribe.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24156 Historical survey &gt; Slave-owning societies]". ''Encyclopædia Britannica.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh: ''The Slave Trade'' Simon and Schuster; Rockefeller Centre; New York, New York; 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological effects==
===In solitary confinement===
Among the most extreme adverse effects suffered by prisoners, appear to be caused by [[solitary confinement]] for long durations. When held in "Special Housing Units" (SHU), prisoners are subject to [[sensory deprivation]] and lack of social contact that can have a severe negative impact on their mental health.

Long durations may lead to depression and changes to brain physiology. In the absence of a social context that is needed to validate perceptions of their environment, prisoners become highly malleable, abnormally sensitive, and exhibit increased vulnerability to the influence of those controlling their environment. Social connection and the support provided from social interaction are prerequisite to long-term social adjustment as a prisoner.

Prisoners exhibit the paradoxical effect of social withdrawal after long periods of solitary confinement. A shift takes place from a craving for greater social contact, to a fear of it. They may grow lethargic and apathetic, and no longer be able to control their own conduct when released from solitary confinement. They can come to depend upon the prison structure to control and limit their conduct.

Long-term stays in solitary confinement can cause prisoners to develop clinical depression, and long-term impulse control disorder. Those with pre-existing mental illnesses are at a higher risk for developing psychiatric symptoms. Some common behaviours are self-mutilation, suicidal tendencies, and psychosis.

A psychopathological condition identified as "SHU syndrome" has been observed among such prisoners. Symptoms are characterized as problems with concentration and memory, distortions of perception, and hallucinations. Most convicts suffering from SHU syndrome exhibit extreme generalized anxiety and panic disorder, with some suffering amnesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ijo.sagepub.com/content/52/6/622 |author=Bruce A. Arrigo, Jennifer Leslie Bullock |date= November 2007 |title=The Psychological Effects of Solitary Confinement on Prisoners in Supermax Units| journal= International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology|doi=10.1177/0306624X07309720|volume=52|issue=6|page=622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stockholm syndrome===
The psychological syndrome known as [[Stockholm syndrome]], describes a paradoxical phenomenon where, over time, hostages develop positive feelings towards their captors.

==Inmate culture==
The founding of ethnographic prison sociology as a discipline, from which most of the meaningful knowledge of prison life and culture stems, is commonly credited to the publication of two key texts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simon|first=Jonathan|title=The `Society of Captives' in the Era of Hyper-Incarceration|journal=Theoretical Criminology|date=1 August 2000|volume=4|issue=3|doi=10.1177/1362480600004003003|page=287}} {{cite journal |last=Crewe|first=Ben|title=Male prisoners’ orientations towards female officers in an English prison|journal=[[Punishment &amp; Society]]|year=2006|volume=8|issue=4|pages=395–421|doi=10.1177/1462474506067565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Clemmer's ''The Prison Community'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clemmer|first=Donald|title=The Prison Community|year=1940|publisher=Holt, Rhineheart and Winston|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was first published in 1940 and republished in 1958; and Gresham Sykes classic study ''The Society of Captives'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sykes|first=Gresham M.|title=The Society of Captives: A Study of a Maximum Security Prison|year=1958|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_YjooNYRMQQC|isbn=0691130647}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was also published in 1958. Clemmer's text, based on his study of 2,400 convicts over three years at the Menard Branch of the Illinois State Penitentiary where he worked as a clinical sociologist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clemmer|first=Donald|title=Leadership Phenomena in a Prison Community|journal=[[Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology]]|date=Mar–Apr 1938|volume=28|issue=6|page=861 n. 1|doi=10.2307/1136755|jstor=1136755}}&lt;/ref&gt; propagated the notion of the existence of a distinct inmate culture and society with values and norms antithetical to both the prison authority and the wider society.
[[File:The Bashful Model.jpg|thumb|right|230px|A scene in [[Newgate Prison]], London]]

In this world, for Clemmer, these values, formalized as the "inmate code", provided behavioural precepts that unified prisoners and fostered antagonism to prison officers and the prison institution as a whole. The process whereby inmates acquired this set of values and behavioural guidelines as they adapted to prison life he termed "prisonization", which he defined as the "taking on, in greater or lesser degree, the folkways, mores, customs and general culture of the penitentiary'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=DeRosia|first=Victoria R.|title=Living Inside Prison Walls: Adjustment Behavior|year=1998|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0-275-95895-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5-m-b-IgbM4C&amp;pg=PA23|edition=1. publ.|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Clemmer argued that all prisoners experienced some degree of prisonization this was not a uniform process and factors such as the extent to which a prisoner involved himself in primary group relations in the prison and the degree to which he identified with the external society all had a considerable impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Faine|first=John R.|title=A self-consistency approach to prisonization|journal=Sociological Quarterly|date=Autumn 1973|volume=14|issue=4|page=576|doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.1973.tb01392.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prisonization as the inculcation of a convict culture was defined by identification with primary groups in prison, the use of prison slang and argot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pollack|first=Joycelyn M.|title=Prisons: Today and Tomorrow|year=2006|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers Inc.|location=Ontario|isbn=0-7637-2904-3|pages=95–96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LsQtASGLeZUC&amp;pg=PA95}}&lt;/ref&gt; the adoption of specified rituals and a hostility to prison authority in contrast to inmate solidarity and was asserted by Clemmer to create individuals who were acculturated into a criminal and deviant way of life that stymied all attempts to reform their behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bright|first=Charles|title=The Powers that Punish : Prison and Politics in the Era of the "Big House," 1920-2009|year=1996|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=Ann Arbor|isbn=0-472-10732-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9c2qHtsxUYC&amp;pg=PA6|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposed to these theories, several European sociologists&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Mathiesen]], T. (1965) The Defences of the Weak: a Study of Norwegian Correctional Institution, London: Tavistock&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that inmates were often fragmented and the links they have with society are often stronger than those forged in prison, particularly through the action of work on time perception&lt;ref&gt;Guilbaud, Fabrice (2010) "Working in Prison: Time as Experienced by Inmate-Workers", ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/i40033161]'' '''51'''-Annual English Selection-Supplement, p. 41-68&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convict code===
[[File:Inmates Orleans Parish Prison.jpg|thumb|Inmates in a prison yard]]
The convict code was theorized as a set of tacit behavioural norms which exercised a pervasive impact on the conduct of prisoners. Competency in following the routines demanded by the code partly determined the inmate’s identity as a convict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Watson|first1=Rod|last2=Sharrock|first2=Wes|title=Conversational actions and organizational actions|volume=8|issue=2|year=1990|page=26|url=http://www.persee.fr/articleAsPDF/reso_0984-5372_1990_hos_8_2_3547/article_reso_0984-5372_1990_hos_8_2_3547.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a set of values and behavioural guidelines, the convict code referred to the behaviour of inmates in antagonising staff members and to the mutual solidarity between inmates as well as the tendency to the non-disclosure to prison authorities of prisoner activities and to resistance to rehabilitation programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brannigan|first=Augustine|title=Review: D. Lawrence Wieder, ''Language and Social Reality: The Case of Telling the Convict Code''|journal=Contemporary Sociology|volume=5|issue=3|date=May 1976|page=349|doi=10.2307/2064132|jstor=2064132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it was seen as providing an expression and form of communal resistance and allowed for the psychological survival of the individual under extremely repressive and regimented systems of carceral control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Colvin|first=Mark|title=Review: David Ward. ''Alcatraz: The Gangster Years''|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=115|issue=1|date=February 2010|page=247|doi=10.1086/ahr.115.1.246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both federal and state laws govern the rights of prisoners. Prisoners in the United States do not have full rights under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], however, they are protected by [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Amendment VIII]] which prohibits [[cruel and unusual punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/prisoners_rights |title=Prisoners' rights &amp;#124; LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=Topics.law.cornell.edu |date=2012-03-02 |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growing research associates education with a number of positive outcomes for prisoners, the institution, and society. Although at the time of the ban’s enactment there was limited knowledge about the relationship between education and recidivism, there is growing merit to idea that education in prison is a preventative to re-incarceration. Several studies help illustrate the point. For example, one study in 1997 that focused on 3,200 prisoners in Maryland, Minnesota, and Ohio, showed that simply attending school behind bars reduced the likelihood of re-incarceration by 29 percent. In 2000, the Texas Department of Education conducted a longitudinal study of 883 men and women who earned college degrees while incarcerated, finding recidivism rates between 27.2 percent (completion of an AA degree) and 7.8 percent (completion of a BA degree), compared to a system-wide recidivism rate between 40 and 43 percent.10 One report, sponsored by the Correctional Education Association, focused on recidivism in three states, concluding that education prevented crime. More recently, a 2013 Department of Justice funded study from the RAND Corporation found that incarcerated individuals who participated in correctional education were 43% less likely to return to prison within 3 years than prisoners who did not participate in such programs.

*[[Civilian internee]]s are [[civilians]] who are detained by a party to a [[war]] for security reasons. They can either be friendly, neutral, or enemy nationals.
*[[Convicts]] are prisoners that are incarcerated under the legal system. In the [[United States]], a [[federal inmate]] is a person convicted of violating [[Law of the United States#Federal law|federal law]], who is then incarcerated at a federal prison that exclusively houses similar criminals. The term most often applies to those convicted of a [[felony]].
*[[Detainees]] is a frequent term used by certain governments to refer to individuals who are held in custody and are not liable to be classified and treated under the law as either [[prisoners of war]] or [[suspect]]s in [[criminal]] cases. It is generally defined with the broad definition: "someone held in custody".
*[[Hostage]]s are historically defined as prisoners held as security for the fulfillment of an agreement, or as a deterrent against an act of war. In modern times, it refers to someone who is seized by a criminal abductor.
*[[Prisoners of war]], also known as a POWs, are individuals incarcerated in relation to [[wars]]. They can be either [[civilian]]s affiliated with [[combatants]], or combatants acting within the bounds of the [[laws and customs of war]].
*[[Political prisoner]]s describe those imprisoned for participation or connection to political activity. Such inmates challenge the legitimacy of the detention.
*[[Slaves]] are prisoners that are held captive for their use as labourers. Various methods have been used throughout history to deprive slaves of their liberty, including forcible restraint.
*[[Prisoner of conscience]] are anyone imprisoned because of their [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[sexual orientation]], religion, or political views.

Other types of prisoners can include those under police [[arrest]], [[house arrest]], those in [[psychiatric institution]]s, [[internment camp]]s, and peoples restricted to a specific area such as Jews in the [[Warsaw ghetto]].

''Proportional reasoning ''is ...

==In mathematics and physics==
In mathematics and in physics, proportionality is a mathematical relation between two quantities; it can be expressed as an equality of two ratios:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

Functionally, proportionality can be a relationship between variables in a mathematical equation. For example, given the following equation for the force of [[gravity]] (according to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]):

:&lt;math&gt;F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

the force of [[gravity]] between two masses is directly proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two masses.

==Intellectual development==
In Piaget’s model of intellectual development, the fourth and final stage is the [[formal operational stage]].  In the classic book “The Growth of Logical Thinking from Childhood to Adolescence” by [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Barbel Inhelder]] formal operational reasoning takes many forms, including propositional reasoning, deductive logic, separation and control of variables, combinatorial reasoning, and proportional reasoning.  [[Robert Karplus]], a science educator in the 1960s and 1970s, investigated all these forms of reasoning in adolescents &amp; adults.  Mr. Tall-Mr.Short was one of his studies.

==Examples==
===Inverse Proportion===
Comparable reasoning patterns exist for inverse proportion.

====Water Triangle====

 Consider a container of colored liquid inside a right triangle where the triangle can be tilted and the water levels on the left and right side can be measured on a built-in scale.  This is called a “water triangle”:
 [[Image:Water-triangle.JPG|400px|The Water Triangle]]
 The water triangle is rotated until it shows a measurement of 4 units on the left side and 6 units on the right side.
 Suppose the triangle is tilted even more until the water level on the right side is at 8 units.  Predict what the water level in units will be on the left side.

;Typical Solutions
Someone with knowledge about the area of triangles might reason: “Initially the area of the water forming the triangle is 12 since ½ * 4 * 6 = 12.  The amount of water doesn’t change so the area won’t change.  So the answer is 3 because ½ * 3 * 8 = 12.”

A correct multiplicative answer is relatively rare.  By far the most common answer is something like: “2 units because the water level on the right side increased by two units so the water level on the left side must decrease by two units and 4 – 2 = 2.”  Less frequently the reason for two units is: “Before there is a total of 10 units because 4 + 6 = 10.  The total number of units must stay the same so the answer is 2 because 2 + 8 = 10.”

So again there are individuals who are not at the formal operational level apply an additive strategy rather than a multiplicative strategy to solve an inverse proportion.  And, like the direct proportion, this incorrect strategy appears to be logical to the individual and appears to give a reasonable answer.  Students are very surprised when they actually carry out the experiment and tilt the triangle to find the answer is 3 and not 2 as they so confidently predicted.

===Viewing These Strategies as Functional Relations===
Let T be the height of Mr. Tall and S be the height of Mr. Short, then the correct multiplicative strategy can be expressed as  T/S = 3/2; this is a constant ratio relation.  The incorrect additive strategy can be expressed as  T – S = 2; this is a constant difference relation.  Here is the graph for these two equations. For the numeric values involved in the problem statement, these graphs are “similar” and it is easy to see why individuals consider their incorrect answers perfectly reasonable.

[[Image:Tall-short-graph.JPG|400px|The Constant Ratio and Constant Difference Relations.]]

Now consider our inverse proportion using the “water triangle.”  Let L be the height of the water on the left side and R be the height of the water on the right side, then the correct multiplicative strategy can be expressed as  L * R = 24; this is a constant product relation.  The incorrect additive strategy can be expressed as  L + R = 10; this is a constant sum relation.  Here is the graph for these two equations. For the numeric values involved in the problem statement, these graphs are “similar” and it is easy to see why individuals consider their incorrect answers perfectly reasonable.

[[Image:Left-right-graph.JPG|400px|The Constant Product and Constant Sum Relations.]]

==Teaching for Proportional Reasoning==
{{Howto|date=September 2009}}
As any experienced teacher will attest{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}, it is not sufficient to simply tell a student his/her answer is incorrect and then instruct the student to use the correct solution.  The incorrect strategy has not been “unwired in the brain” and would re-emerge after the current lesson has been completed.

Also the additive strategies noted above cannot simply be labeled as “incorrect” since they do correctly match other real world situations.  For example, consider the following problem:

''On Independence Day this year Mr. Tall was 6 years old and Mr. Short was 4 years old.  On a future Independence Day Mr. Short is 6 years old.  How old will Mr. Tall be on that Independence Day?''

Similarly the constant sum relation can be correct for some situations.  Consider the following problem.

''There are four beavers on the left side of a river and six beavers on the right side of the river.  At a later time with the same group of beavers there are eight beavers on the right side of the river.  How many beavers will there be on the left side?''

So there are situations where the additive relations (constant difference and constant sum) are correct and other situations where the multiplicative relations (constant ratio and constant product) are correct.

===Use of Hands-On Activities and Karplus’ Learning Cycle===
It is critically important that students on their own recognize that their current mode of reasoning, say that it is additive, is inappropriate for a multiplicative problem they are trying to solve.  Robert Karplus developed a model of learning he called the learning cycle that facilitates the acquisition of new reasoning skills.

# The first phase is one of exploration in which students learn through their own actions and reactions with minimal guidance.  The learning environment has to be carefully designed to focus student’s attention on the relevant issues.  Learners may experience some [[cognitive dissonance]] if they discover their pre-existing strategy does not match observed results.  This may lead to questions that they cannot answer with their present ideas or reasoning patterns.
# In the second phase the concept is introduced and explained. Here the teacher is more active, and learning is achieved by explanation.
# Finally, in the third phase, the concept is applied to new situations and its range of applicability is extended.  Learning is achieved by repetition and practice so that new ideas and ways of thinking have time to stabilize.

Hands-on activities are extremely useful in the learning cycle.  After making predictions about the height of Mr. Tall in paper clips, the measuring tools can be introduced and the students can test their strategies.  For the student using a constant difference relation, actual measurement will show that Mr. Tall is actually nine paper clips high and this will set up some cognitive dissonance.

The same is true for the inverse relations.  Here is a picture of two students working with the “water triangle.”  Given the problem noted above, most students predict the water level on the left side will drop to two units when the water triangle is tilted.  When they carry out the experiment and see that the answer is 3 units, this establishes some cognitive dissonance.  This is a prime time for the teacher to move the lesson into the second stage of the learning cycle.

[[Image:Constant-product.png|400px|Students using the Water Triangle.]]

It is important that the students not over apply the multiplicative strategies they learn.  Therefore, some of the hands-on activities might not be based on a multiplicative relation.  Here is a picture of two students working with an apparatus where the constant sum relation is correct.

[[Image:Constant-sum.png|400px|The constant sum relation works here.]]

It is not always possible or feasible to put carefully designed hands-on activities into the hands of students.  Also, older audiences do not always react well to using hands-on experimentation.  However, it is often possible to introduce cognitive dissonance through [[thought experiments]].

===Determining a Correct Relation Based on Thought Experiments===
In all the experiments noted above there are two variables whose values change based on a fixed relation.  Consider the following problem that is similar to the Mr. Tall and Mr. Short problem.

''Here is a photograph of a father and a daughter.  In this picture the daughter is 4&amp;nbsp;cm high and the father is 6&amp;nbsp;cm high.  They decided to enlarge the picture and in the bigger picture the daughter is 6&amp;nbsp;cm high.  How high is the father in the larger picture?''

A very common answer for an individual using an additive relation is 8&amp;nbsp;cm because the father is always 2&amp;nbsp;cm higher than his daughter.  So now ask this student the following question:
''
Suppose they made a very small version of the original picture and in this small picture the father is 2&amp;nbsp;cm high.  How high will the daughter be in this small picture?''

The student quickly realizes that the strategy “the father is always 2 cm higher than his daughter” is not correct.  This can also be achieved by exploring the other extreme where the original picture is blown up to poster size and the daughter is 100&amp;nbsp;cm high. How high will the father be in this poster?  A student answering 102&amp;nbsp;cm realizes that the father and daughter are almost the same height which cannot be right.  Once cognitive dissonance is present, the teacher can introduce the correct relation, constant ratio.

The student can also be encouraged to conduct their own thought experiments, such as “what if the height of the daughter doubles in an enlargement, what will happen to the height of the father?”  Most students, including those still at the concrete operational stage, will quickly answer that the father’s height must also double.  The abstract thought experiment is: “Suppose that one of the variables is doubled in value, how will the other variable change?” If the answer is “double”, then this may be a constant ratio problem.  But if the answer is not double, such as for the age problem with Mr. Tall and Mr. Short given above, then it is not a constant ratio problem.

For inverse relations, such as the “water triangle”, limiting cases can also introduce cognitive dissonance.  For example:

''Given the initial conditions with the water level on the left at 4 units and the water level on the right at 6 units, predict what is the water level on the left if the triangle is tilted until the water level on the right is 10 units.''

Students will abandon the additive strategy at this point realizing that 0 cannot be the correct answer.  A thought experiment can be performed for inverse relations.  If one variable doubles in value, what happens to the other variable?  If the answer is ½ then this might be a constant product relation (that is, an inverse proportion).

Plotting the values of variables can also be a valuable tool for identifying whether two variables are directly proportional or not.  If they are directly proportional, then the values should be on a straight line and that line should intersect the origin.

==Expanding Functional Reasoning==
The four functional relations noted above, constant sum, constant difference, constant product, and constant ratio, are based on the four arithmetic operations students are most familiar with, namely, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  Most relations in the real world do not fall into one of these categories.  However, if students learn simple techniques such as thought experiments and plotting graphs, they will be able to apply these techniques to more complex situations.

Again, consider Newton’s equation for the force of gravity:
:&lt;math&gt;F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
If a student understands the functional relation between the variables, then he/she should be able to answer the following thought experiments.

What would happen to the force of gravitational attraction if:
*one of the masses is doubled?
*one mass doubled and the other mass halved?
*both masses doubled?
*both masses halved?
*the distance between the masses doubled?
*the distance between the masses halved?

Generally, thought experiments must be confirmed by experimental results. Many children and adults when asked to perform a thought experiment on the mass of an object and the velocity with which it falls to the earth might say that when the mass is doubled then the object will fall twice as fast. However, experimental results do not back up this “logical” thought experiment so it is always essential that theoretical results agree with experimental data.

The '''Quino checkerspot''' (''Euphydryas editha quino'') is a [[butterfly]] native to southern [[California]] and northwestern [[Mexico]]. It is a [[subspecies]] of the common [[Edith's checkerspot]] (''Euphydryas editha'') and the second such subspecies to be listed under the federal [[Endangered Species Act]]. This species, like many others, has undergone several changes in nomenclature and classification. It was originally described as ''Melitaea quino'' in 1863 and then in 1929 it was reduced to a subspecies of ''Euphydryas chalcedona''. In 1998 it was concluded through [[Hans Hermann Behr]]'s 1863 description that it should be classified as ''E. editha'', not ''E. chalcedona''. The species was synonymous with ''E. editha wrighti'', a junior [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] for ''E. e. quino'', thus becoming scientifically accepted as ''E. editha quino''.&lt;ref name="FWS"&gt;[http://ecos.fws.gov/docs/recovery_plans/2003/030917.pdf Quino checkerspot Recovery Plan], ([[PDF]]), 191 pages, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

===Appearance===
A member of the brush-footed butterfly family, [[Nymphalidae]], the Quino checkerspot is a medium-sized butterfly with a wingspan of approximately 3&amp;nbsp;cm. The dorsal wing surfaces are a colorful checkerboard of brown, red and yellow spots. The Quino differs from other ''E. editha'' subspecies in that its spots tend to be a darker red.&lt;ref name="BCI"&gt;[http://www.butterflyrecovery.org/species_profiles/quino_checkerspot/ Quino Checkerspot butterfly], Butterfly Conservation Initiative.&lt;/ref&gt;

It also differentiates itself through its size and [[larva]]l and [[pupa]]l [[phenotype]]s. The [[ventral]] side of the butterfly are dominated by a checkered red and cream pattern. Its [[abdomen]] has red stripes across the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] side. After a second [[ecdysis|molt]], the Quino checkerspot is recognized by the dark black coloration and row of 8 to 9 orange tubercles on their back. Before the larvae first molt they are mostly yellowish. After first molt and before their second molt they are gray with black markings. The pupae are mottled black on a blue-gray background.

The Quino checkerspot is easily confused in the field by inexperienced butterfly searchers. It is generally confused with three other co-occurring butterfly species, the Chalcedon or variable checkerspot, (''[[Euphydryas chalcedona]]''), Gabb's checkerspot (''[[Chlosyne gabbii]]'') and Wright's checkerspot (''[[Thessalia leonira wrighti]]'').&lt;ref name="FWS"/&gt;

===Life cycle===
The life cycle of the Quino checkerspot closely mirrors that of the close [[Bay checkerspot]]. They share the same host plant and similar chronology of developmental stages.

==Habitat==
The obvious factor in the decline of the Quino checkerspot is [[urban development]]. Much of the historic [[Shrubland|scrub land]] that it occupied, much like the [[Mission blue butterfly]], also endangered, has been built over. The persisting [[habitat]] faces other threats. [[Invasive species]], in the form of non-native plant life and overgrazing are just two of the hurdles facing the recovery of the Quino checkerspot. Today, there are eight populations of the Quino known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://essig.berkeley.edu/endins/quino.htm Quino Checkerspot Butterfly], Essig Museum of Entomology, UC Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Range===
Habitat declined and, thus, distribution and population of the Quino checkerspot has been greatly reduced during the last 100 years. Nearly all of the blame lies in [[agricultural]] and urban development in southern California. The other impactors to the decline include non-native grasses and fire suppression practices as well as [[grazing]]. The Quino checkerspot became the second subspecies of ''Euphydryas editha'' to be listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The first was the [[Bay checkerspot]].&lt;ref name="BCI"/&gt;

Currently, the Quino checkerspot is only found in a very few locales. Western [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]], southern [[San Diego County]] and northern [[Baja California]], Mexico. The animal's historic range once included much of coastal California south of [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]] as well as the inland valleys south of the [[Tehachapi Mountains]]. Regardless, more than 75% of the butterfly's original range has been lost. The range loss translates directly into population decline. Quino checkerspot butterfly populations appear to have decreased by more than 95% range wide.&lt;ref name="FWS"/&gt;

Importantly, the individual does not need to subscribe to the stereotype for it to be activated. It is hypothesized that the mechanism through which anxiety (induced by the activation of the stereotype) decreases performance is by depleting [[working memory]] (especially the phonological aspects of the working memory system).&lt;ref name="BeilockEtAl2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beilock|first1=Sian L.|last2=Rydell|first2=Robert J.|last3=McConnell|first3=Allen R.|title=Stereotype threat and working memory: Mechanisms, alleviation, and spillover|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=136|issue=2|year=2007|pages=256–276|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.136.2.256|pmid=17500650|citeseerx=10.1.1.669.9881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, studies have cautioned that stereotype threat should not be interpreted as a factor in real-world performance gaps.&lt;ref name="Sackett2004a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sackett2004b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoet2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ganley2013"/&gt; One review has voiced concerns that the effect has been over-estimated for schoolgirls and that the field likely suffers from [[publication bias]].&lt;ref name="Flore2014" /&gt;

Stereotype threat is purportedly a contributing factor to long-standing [[Race and intelligence|racial]] and [[Gender gaps in mathematics and reading|gender gaps]] in academic performance. It may occur whenever an individual's performance might confirm a negative stereotype because stereotype threat is thought to arise from a particular situation, rather than from an individual's [[personality trait]]s or characteristics. Since most people have at least one [[social identity]] which is negatively stereotyped, most people are vulnerable to stereotype threat if they encounter a situation in which the stereotype is relevant. Situational factors that increase stereotype threat can include the difficulty of the task, the belief that the task measures their abilities, and the relevance of the stereotype to the task. Individuals show higher degrees of stereotype threat on tasks they wish to perform well on and when they identify strongly with the stereotyped group. These effects are also increased when they expect [[discrimination]] due to their identification with a negatively stereotyped group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Steele | first1 = Claude M. | last2 = Spencer | first2 = Steven J. | last3 = Aronson | first3 = Joshua | doi = 10.1016/S0065-2601(02)80009-0 | title = Contending with group image: the psychology of stereotype and social identity threat | series = Advances in Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 34 | pages = 379–440 | date = 2002 | isbn = 9780120152346 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated experiences of stereotype threat can lead to a [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] of diminished confidence, poor performance, and loss of interest in the relevant area of achievement.&lt;ref name="GilovichKeltner2006"&gt;{{citation|author-last1=Gilovich|author-first1=Thomas|author-last2=Keltner|author-first2=Dacher |author-last3=Nisbett|author-first3= Richard E. | contribution = Being a member of a stigmatized group: stereotype threat |editor-last1=Gilovich|editor-first1=Thomas|editor-last2=Keltner|editor-first2=Dacher |editor-last3=Nisbett|editor-first3= Richard E. | title = Social psychology | pages = 467–468 | publisher = W.W.

The opposite of stereotype threat is '''stereotype boost''', which is when people perform better than they otherwise would have, because of exposure to [[positive stereotype]]s about their social group. A variant of stereotype boost is '''stereotype lift''', which is people achieving better performance because of exposure to negative stereotypes about other social groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Original study==
[[File:Stereotype threat bw.jpg|thumb|right|300px|"The Effects of Stereotype Threat on the Standardized Test Performance of College Students (adjusted for group differences on SAT)". From J. Aronson, C.M. Steele, M.F. Salinas, M.J. Lustina, ''Readings About the Social Animal'', 8th edition, ed. E. Aronson]]
In 1995, [[Claude Steele]] and Joshua Aronson performed the first experiments demonstrating that stereotype threat can undermine intellectual performance.&lt;ref name=SteeleAronson /&gt; They had African-American and [[European American|European-American]] college students take a difficult verbal portion of the [[Graduate Record Examination]] test. As would be expected based on national averages, the African-American students did not perform as well on the test. Steele and Aronson split students into three groups: stereotype-threat (in which the test was described as being "diagnostic of intellectual ability"), non-stereotype threat (in which the test was described as "a laboratory problem-solving task that was nondiagnostic of ability"), and a third condition (in which the test was again described as nondiagnostic of ability, but participants were asked to view the difficult test as a challenge). All three groups received the same test.

Adjusted for previous SAT scores, subjects in the non-diagnostic-challenge condition performed significantly better than those in the non-diagnostic-only condition and those in the diagnostic condition. In the first experiment, the race-by-condition interaction was marginally significant. However, the second study reported in the same paper found a significant interaction effect of race and condition. This suggested that placement in the diagnostic condition significantly impacted African Americans compared with European Americans.&lt;ref name="SteeleAronson" /&gt;

Steele and Aronson concluded that changing the instructions on the test could reduce African-American students' concern about confirming a negative stereotype about their group. Supporting this conclusion, they found that African-American students who regarded the test as a measure of intelligence had more thoughts related to negative stereotypes of their group. Steele and Aronson measured this through a word completion task. They found that African Americans who thought the test measured intelligence were more likely to complete word fragments using words associated with relevant negative stereotypes (e.g., completing "__mb" as "dumb" rather than as "numb").&lt;ref name="SteeleAronson" /&gt;

==Further empirical studies==
More than 300 published papers show the effects of stereotype threat on performance in a variety of domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diversity.arizona.edu/sites/diversity/files/stereotype_threat_overview.pdf |title=Stereotype Threat: An Overview |last1=Stroessner |first1=Steve |last2=Good |first2=Catherine |website=diversity.arizona.edu |publisher=Reducing Stereotype Threat.org |accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of the stereotype threat that occurs depends on how the task is framed. If a task is framed to be neutral, stereotype threat is not likely to occur; however, if tasks are framed in terms of active stereotypes, participants are likely to perform worse on the task. For example, a study on chess players revealed that female players performed more poorly than expected when they were told they would be playing against a male opponent. In contrast, women who were told that their opponent was female performed as would be predicted by past ratings of performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maass|first1=Anne|last2=D'Ettole|first2=Claudio|last3=Cadinu|first3=Mara|title=Checkmate?

Researchers Vishal Gupta, Daniel Turban, and Nachiket Bhawe extended stereotype threat research to [[entrepreneurship]], a traditionally male-stereotyped profession. Their study revealed that stereotype threat can depress women's entrepreneurial intentions while boosting men's intentions. However, when entrepreneurship is presented as a gender-neutral profession, men and women express a similar level of interest in becoming entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name = "Stereotype Threat and Entrepreneurial Intentions"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gupta|first1=V.

Individuals who highly identify with a particular group appear to be more vulnerable to experiencing stereotype threat than individuals who do not identify strongly with the stereotyped group.

The mere presence of other people can evoke stereotype threat. In one experiment, women who took a mathematics exam along with two other women got 70% of the answers right, whereas women who took the same exam in the presence of two men got an average score of 55%.&lt;ref name="InzlichtBen-Zeev2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Inzlicht|first1=M.|last2=Ben-Zeev|first2=T.|title=A Threatening Intellectual Environment: Why Females Are Susceptible to Experiencing Problem-Solving Deficits in the Presence of Males|journal=Psychological Science|volume=11|issue=5|year=2000|pages=365–371|issn=0956-7976|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00272|pmid=11228906|citeseerx=10.1.1.24.1847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of a study conducted by Desert, Preaux, and Jund in 2009 was to see if children from lower [[Socioeconomic status|socioeconomic groups]] are affected by stereotype threat. The study compared children that were 6–7 years old with children that were 8–9 years old from multiple elementary schools. These children were presented with the [[Raven's Progressive Matrices|Raven's Matrices]] test, which is an intellectual ability test. Separate groups of children were given directions in an evaluative way and other groups were given directions in a non-evaluative way. The "evaluative" group received instructions that are usually given with the Raven Matrices test, while the "non-evaluative" group was given directions which made it seem as if the children were simply playing a game. The results showed that third graders performed better on the test than the first graders did, which was expected. However, the lower socioeconomic status children did worse on the test when they received directions in an evaluative way than the higher socioeconomic status children did when they received directions in an evaluative way. These results suggested that the framing of the directions given to the children may have a greater effect on performance than socioeconomic status. This was shown by the differences in performance based on which type of instructions they received. This information can be useful in classroom settings to help improve the performance of students of lower socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Desert|first=Michael|author2=Marie Preaux |author3=Robin Jund |title=So young and already victims of stereotype threat: Socio-economic status and performance of 6 to 9 years old children on Raven's progressive matrices|journal=European Journal of Psychology of Education|year=2009|volume=24|issue=2|pages=207–218|doi=10.1007/BF03173012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been studies on the effects of stereotype threat based on age. A study was done on 99 senior citizens ranging in age from 60–75 years. These seniors were given multiple tests on certain factors and categories such as memory and physical abilities, and were also asked to evaluate how physically fit they believe themselves to be. Additionally, they were asked to read articles that contained both positive and negative outlooks about seniors, and they watched someone reading the same articles. The goal of this study was to see if priming the participants before the tests would affect performance. The results showed that the control group performed better than those that were primed with either negative or positive words prior to the tests. The control group seemed to feel more confident in their abilities than the other two groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horton|first=Sean|author2=Joseph Baker |author3=William Pearce |author4=Janice Deakin |title=Immunity to Popular Stereotypes of Aging?

Many psychological experiments carried out on Stereotype Threat focus on the physiological effects of negative stereotype threat on performance, looking at both high and low status groups. Scheepers and Ellemers tested the following hypothesis: when assessing a performance situation on the basis of current beliefs the low status group members would show a physiological threat response, and high-status members would also show a physiological threat response when examining a possible alteration of the status quo(Scheepers &amp; Ellemers, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheepers|first=Daan|last2=Ellemers|first2=Naomi|date=March 2005|title=When the pressure is up: The assessment of social identity threat in low and high status groups|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=41 |issue=2|pages=192–200|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2004.06.002|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this experiment were in line with expectations. As predicted, participants in the low status condition showed higher blood pressure immediately after the status feedback, while participants in the high-status condition showed a spike in blood pressure while anticipating the second round of the task.

In 2012, Scheepers et al. hypothesized that when high social power is stimulated 'an efficient cardiovascular pattern (challenge)' is produced, whereas, 'an inefficient cardiovascular pattern' or threat is caused by the activation of low social power (Scheepers, de Wit, Ellemers &amp; Sassenberg, 2012). Two experiments were carried out in order to test this hypothesis. The first experiment looked at power priming and the second experiment related to role play. Both results from these two experiments provided evidence in support for the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheepers|first=Daan|last2=de Wit|first2=Frank|last3=Ellemers|first3=Naomi|last4=Sassenberg|first4=Kai|date=January 2012|title=Social power makes the heart work more efficiently: Evidence from cardiovascular markers of challenge and threat|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=48 |issue=1|pages=371–374|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2011.06.014|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereotype lift and stereotype boost==
Stereotype threat concerns how stereotype cues can harm performance. However, in certain situations, stereotype activation can also lead to performance enhancement through stereotype lift or stereotype boost. Stereotype lift increases performance when people are exposed to negative stereotypes about another group.&lt;ref name="Walton 2003 456–467"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walton|first=G.

C. |editor=Inzlicht, M. |editor2=Schmader, T.|chapter=Stereotype boost: Positive outcomes from the activation of positive stereotypes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotype boost occurs when a positive aspect of an individual's social identity is made salient in an identity-relevant domain. Although stereotype boost is similar to stereotype lift in enhancing performance, stereotype lift is the result of a negative outgroup stereotype, whereas stereotype boost occurs due to activation of a positive [[Ingroups and outgroups|ingroup]] stereotype.&lt;ref name="Shih, M. J. 2012 141–156"/&gt;

Consistent with the positive racial stereotype concerning their superior quantitative skills, [[Asian American]] women performed better on a math test when their Asian identity was [[Priming (psychology)|primed]] compared to a [[Treatment and control groups|control condition]] where no social identity was primed.

==Mechanisms==
Although numerous studies demonstrate the effects of stereotype threat on performance, questions remain as to the specific cognitive factors that underlie these effects. Steele and Aronson originally speculated that attempts to suppress stereotype-related thoughts lead to anxiety and the narrowing of [[attention]]. This could contribute to the observed deficits in performance. In 2008, [[Toni Schmader]], Michael Johns, and Chad Forbes published an integrated model of stereotype threat that focused on three interrelated factors:
# [[Stress (psychological)|stress]] arousal; 
# performance monitoring, which narrows attention; and, 
# efforts to suppress negative thoughts and emotions.&lt;ref name="Schmader2008"/&gt;
Schmader et al. suggest that these three factors summarize the pattern of evidence that has been accumulated by past experiments on stereotype threat. For example, stereotype threat has been shown to disrupt working memory and [[executive function]],&lt;ref name="Working Memory"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmader|first1=Toni|last2=Johns|first2=Michael|title=Converging Evidence That Stereotype Threat Reduces Working Memory Capacity|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=85|issue=3|year=2003|pages=440–452|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.3.440|pmid=14498781}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ego depletion" /&gt; increase arousal,&lt;ref name=arousal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ben-Zeev|first=Talia|author2=Fein, Steven|author3=Inzlicht, Michael|title=Stereotype Threat and Arousal|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=41|issue=2|pages=174–181|url=http://michaelinzlicht.com/research/research_articles/Ben-Zeev,%20Fein,%20Inzlicht.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2003.11.007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306003643/http://www.michaelinzlicht.com/research/research_articles/Ben-Zeev,%20Fein,%20Inzlicht.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; increase [[self-consciousness]] about one's performance,&lt;ref name="Causal Mechanisms of Stereotype Threat"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beilock|first1=S.

When a large portion of these resources are spent focusing on anxiety and performance pressure, the individual is likely to perform worse on the task at hand.

With regard to performance monitoring and vigilance, studies of brain activity have supported the idea that stereotype threat increases both of these processes. Forbes and colleagues recorded [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG) signals that measure electrical activity along the scalp, and found that individuals experiencing stereotype threat were more vigilant for performance-related stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The role of devaluing and discounting in performance monitoring: a neurophysiological study of minorities under threat | year = 2008 | journal = Social Cognitive Affective Neuroscience | pages = 253–261 | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | last1 = Forbes | first1 = C. | last2 = Schmader | first2 = T.| last3 = Allen | first3 = J.J.B.|doi=10.1093/scan/nsn012| pmid = 19015117 | pmc = 2566773 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gray727 anterior cingulate cortex.png|thumb|right|300px|Researchers found that women experiencing stereotype threat while taking a math test showed heightened activation in the ventral stream of the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC).]]

Another study used [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) to investigate brain activity associated with stereotype threat. The researchers found that women experiencing stereotype threat while taking a math test showed heightened activation in the ventral stream of the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC), a neural region thought to be associated with social and emotional processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The negative consequences of threat: A functional magnetic resonance imaging investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying women's underperformance in math | year = 1995 | journal = Psychological Science | pages = 168–175 | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | last1 = Krendle | first1 = Anne C. | last2 = Richeson | first2 = Jennifer A. | last3 = Kelley | first3 = William M. | last4 = Heatherton | first4 = Todd F. |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02063.x | pmid=18271865}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wraga and colleagues found that women under stereotype threat showed increased activation in the ventral ACC and that the amount of this activation predicted performance decrements on the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wraga|first1=M.|last2=Helt|first2=M.|last3=Jacobs|first3=E.|last4=Sullivan|first4=K.|title=Neural basis of stereotype-induced shifts in women's mental rotation performance|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|volume=2|issue=1|year=2006|pages=12–19|issn=1749-5016|doi=10.1093/scan/nsl041|pmid=18985116|pmc=2555429}}&lt;/ref&gt; When individuals were made aware of performance-related stimuli, they were more likely to experience stereotype threat.

A study conducted by Boucher, Rydell, Loo, and Rydell has shown that stereotype threat not only affects performance, but can also affect the ability to learn new information. In the study, undergraduate men and women had a session of learning followed by an assessment of what they learned. Some participants were given information intended to induce stereotype threat, and some of these participants were later given "gender fair" information, which it was predicted would reduce or remove stereotype threat. As a result, participants were split into four separate conditions: control group, stereotype threat only, stereotype threat removed before learning, and stereotype threat removed after learning. The results of the study showed that the women who were presented with the "gender fair" information performed better on the math related test than the women who were not presented with this information. This study also showed that it was more beneficial to women for the "gender fair" information to be presented prior to learning rather than after learning. These results suggest that eliminating stereotype threat prior to taking mathematical tests can help women perform better, and that eliminating stereotype threat prior to mathematical learning can help women learn better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boucher|first=Kathryn L.|author2=Robert Rydell |author3=Katie Van Loo |author4=Michael Rydell |title=Reducing Stereotype threat in order to facilitate learning|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2012|volume=42|issue=2|pages=174–179|doi=10.1002/ejsp.871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Long-term and other consequences==

Decreased performance is the most recognized consequence of stereotype threat. However, research has also shown that stereotype threat can cause individuals to blame themselves for perceived failures,&lt;ref name="Women and computers"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koch|first1=S|last2=Muller|first2=S|last3=Sieverding|first3=M|title=Women and computers.

In the long run, the chronic experience of stereotype threat may lead individuals to disidentify with the stereotyped group. For example, a woman may stop seeing herself as "a math person" after experiencing a series of situations in which she experienced stereotype threat. This disidentification is thought to be a psychological coping strategy to maintain [[self-esteem]] in the face of failure.&lt;ref name="Learning in a Man's World"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steele|first1=Jennifer|last2=James|first2=Jacquelyn B.|last3=Barnett|first3=Rosalind Chait|title=Learning in a Man's World: Examining the Perceptions of Undergraduate Women in Male-Dominated Academic Areas|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=26|issue=1|year=2002|pages=46–50|issn=0361-6843|doi=10.1111/1471-6402.00042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated exposure to anxiety and nervousness can lead individuals to choose to distance themselves from the stereotyped group.

Although much of the research on stereotype threat has examined the effects of coping with negative stereotype on academic performance, recently there has been an emphasis on how coping with stereotype threat could "spillover" to dampen self-control and thereby affect a much broader category of behaviors, even in non-stereotyped domains.&lt;ref name="stereotype threat spillover"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inzlicht|first=Michael|author2=Kang, Sonia|title=Stereotype threat spillover: How coping with threats to social identity affects, aggression, eating, decision-making, and attention|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2010|volume=99|issue=3|pages=467–481|url=http://michaelinzlicht.com/research/publications/Inzlicht%20&amp;%20Kang,%202010.pdf|doi=10.1037/a0018951|pmid=20649368|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306003450/http://www.michaelinzlicht.com/research/publications/Inzlicht%20%26%20Kang%2C%202010.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=|citeseerx=10.1.1.600.1063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by [[Michael Inzlicht]] and colleagues suggest that, when women cope with negative stereotypes about their math ability, they perform worse on math tests, and that, after completing the math test, women may continue to show deficits even in unrelated domains. For example, women might overeat, be more aggressive, make more risky decisions,&lt;ref name="stereotype threat spillover" /&gt; and show less endurance during physical exercise.&lt;ref name="ego depletion"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inzlicht|first=Michael|author2=McKay, Linda|author3=Aronson, Joshua|title=Stigma as ego-depletion: How being the target of prejudice affects self-control|journal=Psychological Science|year=2006|volume=17|issue=3|pages=262–269|url=http://michaelinzlicht.com/research/research_articles/Inzlicht,%20McKay,%20&amp;%20Aronson.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01695.x|pmid=16507068|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306003531/http://www.michaelinzlicht.com/research/research_articles/Inzlicht%2C%20McKay%2C%20%26%20Aronson.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perceived discrimination associated with stereotype threat can also have negative long-term consequences on individuals' [[mental health]].

==Mitigation==
Additional research seeks ways to boost the test scores and academic achievement of students in negatively stereotyped groups. There are many ways to combat the effects of stereotype threat.

However, other research has found the opposite effect. In one study, women were given a text "summarizing an experiment in which stereotypes, and not biological differences, were shown to be the cause of women's underperformance in math", and then they performed a math exercise. It was found that "women who properly understood the meaning of the information provided, and thus became knowledgeable about stereotype threat, performed significantly worse at a calculus task".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tomasetto C, Appoloni A |title=A lesson not to be learned?

# Have participants engage in [[self-affirmation]], which is a process in which participants write about a value that is important to them. In 2006, researchers Geoffrey L. Cohen, Julio Garcia, Nancy Apfel, and Allison Master found that a self-affirmation exercise (in the form of a brief in-class writing assignment) significantly improved the grades of African-American middle-school students, and reduced the racial achievement gap by 40%.

# Increase participants' feelings of social belonging within the academic world.

Researchers argued that individuals make decisions about group membership based on the group’s environment and proved that altering the physical objects in a room boosted minority participation.

==Criticism==
The stereotype threat explanation of [[achievement gap]]s has attracted criticism. According to Paul R. Sackett, Chaitra M. Hardison, and Michael J. Cullen, both the media and scholarly literature have wrongly concluded that eliminating stereotype threat could completely eliminate differences in test performance between European Americans and African Americans.&lt;ref name="Sackett2004a"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sackett|first1=Paul R.|last2=Hardison|first2=Chaitra M.|last3=Cullen|first3=Michael J.|title=On interpreting stereotype threat as accounting for African American-White differences on cognitive tests|journal=American Psychologist|volume=59|issue=1|pages=7–13|date=January 2004|pmid=14736315|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.7|url=http://www2.uni-jena.de/svw/igc/studies/ss03/sackitt_hardison_cullen_2004.pdf|format=PDF|issn=1935-990X|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404150510/http://www2.uni-jena.de/svw/igc/studies/ss03/sackitt_hardison_cullen_2004.pdf|archivedate=2013-04-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sackett et al. have pointed out that, in Steele and Aronson's (1995) experiments where stereotype threat was removed, an achievement gap of approximately one [[standard deviation]] remained between the groups, which is very close in size to that routinely reported between African American and European Americans' average scores on large-scale standardized tests such as the SAT. In subsequent correspondence between Sackett et al. and Steele and Aronson, Sackett et al. wrote that "They [Steele and Aronson] agree that it is a misinterpretation of the Steele and Aronson (1995) results to conclude that eliminating stereotype threat eliminates the African American-White test-score gap."&lt;ref name="Sackett2004b"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sackett|first1=Paul R.|last2=Hardison|first2=Chaitra M.|last3=Cullen|first3=Michael J.|title=On the Value of Correcting Mischaracterizations of Stereotype Threat Research|journal=American Psychologist|volume=59|issue=1|year=2004|pages=48–49|issn=1935-990X|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.48|url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/85192141/2004-sackett.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050208/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/85192141/2004-sackett.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur R. Jensen]] criticised stereotype threat theory on the basis that it invokes an additional mechanism to explain effects which could be, according to him, explained by other, well-known, and well-established theories, such as test anxiety and especially the [[Yerkes–Dodson law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yerkes | first1 = Robert M. | author-link1 = Robert M. Yerkes | last2 = Dodson | first2 = John D. | author-link2 = John Dillingham Dodson | title = The relation of strength of stimulus to rapidity of habit-formation | journal = [[The Journal of Comparative Neurology|Journal of Comparative Neurology and Psychology]] | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 459–482 | doi = 10.1002/cne.920180503 | date = November 1908 | url = http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Yerkes/Law/ | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jensen's view, the effects which are attributed to stereotype threat may simply reflect "the interaction of ability level with test anxiety as a function of test complexity".&lt;ref name=jensen&gt;{{citation | last = Jensen | first = Arthur Robert | author-link = Arthur Robert Jensen | contribution = Population differences in ''g'': causal hypotheses | editor-last = Jensen | editor-first = Arthur Robert | editor-link = Arthur Robert Jensen | title = The g factor: the science of mental ability | pages = 513–515 | publisher = Praeger | location = Westport, Connecticut | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780275961039| quote = ''the phenomenon of stereotype threat can be explained in terms of a more general construct, test anxiety, which has been studied since the early days of psychometrics. Test anxiety tends to lower performance levels on tests in proportion to the degree of complexity and the amount of mental effort they require of the subject.

They further articulate that, "Yerkes and Dodson may have the dubious distinction to be the most highly cited, but largely unread, paper in the history of science."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Diamond | first1 = David M. | last2 = Campbell | first2 = Adam M. | last3 = Park | first3 = Collin R. | last4 = Halonen | first4 = Joshua | last5 = Zoladz | first5 = Phillip R. | title = The temporal dynamics model of emotional memory processing: a synthesis on the neurobiological basis of stress-induced amnesia, flashbulb and traumatic memories, and the Yerkes-Dodson Law | journal = [[Neural Plasticity (journal)|Neural Plasticity]] | volume = 2007 | id = 60803 | page = 60803 | doi = 10.1155/2007/60803 | pmid = 17641736 | pmc = 1906714  | date = 2007 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wei | first = Thomas E. | title = Stereotype threat, gender, and math performance: evidence from the national assessment of educational progress | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228776168 | format = web | publisher = [[Harvard University]] | date = October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wei examined [[National Assessment of Educational Progress|real-world testing]] over a broad population (rather than lab assessments with questionable [[external validity]]), and found a reverse stereotype threat: a randomly assigned question actually raised female students' scores by 0.05 standard deviations. An earlier experiment with Advanced Placement exams found no effects that were 'practically significant,' but does show 'statistically significant' effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stricker | first1 = Lawrence J. | last2 = Ward | first2 = William C. | title = Stereotype threat, inquiring about test takers' ethnicity and gender, and standardized test performance | journal = [[Journal of Applied Social Psychology]] | volume = 34 | issue = 4 | pages = 665–693 | doi = 10.1111/j.1559-1816.2004.tb02564.x | date = April 2004 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gijsbert Stoet and [[David C. Geary]] reviewed the evidence for the stereotype threat explanation of the achievement gap in mathematics between men and women. They concluded that the relevant stereotype threat research has many methodological problems, such as not having a control group, and that the stereotype threat literature on this topic misrepresents itself as "well established". They concluded that the evidence is in fact very weak.&lt;ref name="Stoet2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stoet | first1 = G. | last2 = Geary | first2 = D.

=== Publication bias ===

[[File:FloreAndWicherts2015 meta analysis sex stereotype threat.png|thumb|Meta-analysis of stereotype threat on girls showing asymmetry typical of publication bias. From Flore, P. C., &amp; Wicherts, J. M. (2014)&lt;ref name="Flore2014"/&gt;]]

The strength and type of the effect has also been questioned. Flore and Wicherts concluded the reported effect is small, but also that the field is inflated by [[publication bias]]. They argue that, correcting for this, the most likely true effect size is near zero (see meta-analytic plot, highlighting both the restriction of large effect to [[Statistical power|low-powered]] studies, and the plot asymmetry which occurs when publication bias is active).&lt;ref name="Flore2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flore|first1=Paulette C.|last2=Wicherts|first2=Jelte M.|title=Does stereotype threat influence performance of girls in stereotyped domains? A meta-analysis|journal=Journal of School Psychology|volume=53|issue=1|year=2014|pages=25–44|issn=0022-4405|doi=10.1016/j.jsp.2014.10.002|pmid=25636259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier meta-analyses reached similar conclusions. For instance, Ganley et al. (2013)&lt;ref name="Ganley2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ganley|first=Colleen M.|author2=Mingle, Leigh A.|author3=Ryan, Allison M.|author4=Ryan, Katherine|author5=Vasilyeva, Marina|author6=Perry, Michelle|title=An Examination of Stereotype Threat Effects on Girls' Mathematics Performance|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1 January 2013|doi=10.1037/a0031412|url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/85192141/2013-ganley.pdf|volume=49|issue=10|pages=1886–1897|pmid=23356523|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719005546/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/85192141/2013-ganley.pdf|archivedate=19 July 2014|df=|citeseerx=10.1.1.353.4436}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined math stereotype threat in a well-powered (total N ~ 1000) multi-experiment study. This allowed examination of potential moderators such as age and implicit vs explicit methods. Significant gender differences in math were found, but "no evidence that the mathematics performance of school-age girls was impacted by stereotype threat" was found. Further, they found that evidence for stereotype threat in children reflects [[publication bias]]: large, well-controlled studies find smaller or non-significant effects, while among the many [[Statistical power|underpowered]] studies run, researchers selectively published those in which [[false-positive]] effects reached significance:&lt;ref name=Ganley2013/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;nonsignificant findings were almost always reported in an article along with some significant stereotype threat effects found either at another age (Ambady et al., 2001; Muzzatti &amp; Agnoli, 2007), only with certain students (Keller, 2007), on certain items (Keller, 2007; Neuville &amp; Croizet, 2007), or in certain contexts (Huguet &amp; Regner, 2007, Study 2; Picho &amp; Stephens, 2012; Tomasetto et al., 2011). Importantly, none of the three unpublished dissertations showed a stereotype threat effect. This observation suggests the possibility that publication bias is occurring. Publication bias refers to the fact that studies with null results are often not written up for publication or accepted for publication (Begg, 1994). This bias is a serious concern, especially if these results are being used to make recommendations for interventions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Student Peace Alliance''' is a nonpartisan student action organization advocating peace across the United States of America. Founded at [[Brandeis University]] in the Spring of 2006 by Aaron Voldman and Julia Simon-Mishel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://my.brandeis.edu/clubs/spa The Brandies Chapter website.]&lt;/ref&gt; Student Peace Alliance is a [[501(c)4]] organization, and has 100 chapters in the United States at high schools, colleges, and community youth organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeacealliance.org/content/section/17/187/. The Peace Alliance Website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activity==
The Student Peace Alliance calls for a U.S. Department of Peace to effectively and efficiently implement policies that would centralize and unify peace building efforts domestically and abroad. With a legislative bill in the U.S. House of representatives (H.R. 808) that currently has 70 co-sponsors, Student Peace Alliance coordinates supportive efforts on a local and national level through various actions including, policy suggestions, research, citizen lobbying efforts, and peaceful non-violent  demonstrations.

Peace of the Pie Action : The annual Mother's Day "Peace of the Pie" National Action Day! On May 11 (the Friday before Mother's Day), members of SPA and [[Peace Alliance]] take pies to their local Congressional offices, letting members of Congress know that "Peace wants a Piece of the Pie, which is 2% of the Federal Defence Budget.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080602/LIVING/80601012/1004 Burlington Free Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Greater Alliance==
The Greater Alliance, all of which have the goal of promoting peace and policies for peace, consists of the Peace Alliance, Student Peace Alliance, and Global Alliance for Ministries and Departments of Peace. Founded in 2004 by Maryanne Williamson, the Peace Alliance is an organization dedicated to, in coordination with national efforts, raising grassroots awareness in local communities about violence prevention and peace programs in order to influence congressional decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.txdop.com/ The Peace Alliance goals]&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 2005, and operating in over 30 countries around the world, [[The Global Alliance for Ministries and Departments of Peace]] works on an international level promoting peaceful dialogue between nations through peace summits and global initiatives to establish Departments and Ministries of Peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peoplesinitiativefordepartmentsofpeace.org/ People for the departments of peace.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sudarsky's classification of gas giants''' for the purpose of predicting their appearance based on their temperature was outlined by [[David Sudarsky]] and colleagues in the paper ''Albedo and Reflection Spectra of Extrasolar Giant Planets''&lt;ref name="sudarsky"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0004-637X/538/2/885/|author=Sudarsky, D.|author2=Burrows, A.|author3=Pinto, P.|title=Albedo and Reflection Spectra of Extrasolar Giant Planets|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] | volume=538 | date=2000 | pages=885–903 | doi=10.1086/309160 | bibcode=2000ApJ...538..885S|arxiv = astro-ph/9910504 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded on in ''Theoretical Spectra and Atmospheres of Extrasolar Giant Planets'',&lt;ref name="sudarsky2"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Sudarsky, D. | author2=Burrows, A. | author3=Hubeny, I. | title=Theoretical Spectra and Atmospheres of Extrasolar Giant Planets | journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] | date=2003 | volume=588 | issue=2 | pages=1121–1148 | doi=10.1086/374331 | bibcode=2003ApJ...588.1121S|arxiv = astro-ph/0210216 }}&lt;/ref&gt; published before any successful direct or indirect observation of an extrasolar planet atmosphere was made. It is a broad classification system with the goal of bringing some order to the likely rich variety of extrasolar gas-giant atmospheres.

[[Gas giant]]s are split into five classes (numbered using [[Roman numerals]]) according to their modeled physical atmospheric properties. In the Solar System, only [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] are within the Sudarsky classification, and both are Class I.
The appearance of planets that are not gas giants cannot be predicted by the Sudarsky system, for example [[terrestrial planet]]s such as [[Earth]] and [[Venus]], [[HD 85512 b]] (3.6 [[Earth mass]]es) and [[OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb]] (5.5 Earth masses), or [[ice giant]]s such as [[Uranus]] (14 Earth masses) and [[Neptune]] (17 Earth masses).

== Background ==
The appearance of extrasolar planets is largely unknown because of the difficulty in making direct observations of [[extrasolar planets]]. In addition, analogies with planets in the [[Solar System]] can apply for few of the extrasolar planets known; because most are wholly unlike any of our planets, for example the [[hot Jupiter]]s.

Bodies that transit their star can be spectrographically mapped, for instance [[HD 189733 b]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2007-09/ssc2007-09a.shtml |title=First Map of Alien World |accessdate=November 23, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016161601/http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2007-09/ssc2007-09a.shtml |archivedate=October 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
That planet has further been shown to be blue with an [[albedo]] greater (brighter) than 0.14.&lt;ref name="Berdyugina"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.astro.phys.ethz.ch/papers/berdyugina/exoplanet_hd189733b.pdf | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=673 | issue=1 | date=20 January 2008 | title=First detection of polarized scattered light from an exoplanetary atmosphere | first=Svetlana V. | last=Berdyugina | author2=Andrei V.

Fluri | author4=Vilppu Piirola | doi=10.1086/527320 | pages=L83 | bibcode=2008ApJ...673L..83B | arxiv=0712.0193 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217111141/http://www.astro.phys.ethz.ch/papers/berdyugina/exoplanet_hd189733b.pdf | archivedate=17 December 2008 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most transiting planets are hot Jupiters.

Speculation on the appearances of ''unseen'' extrasolar planets currently relies upon computational models of the likely [[atmosphere]] of such a planet, for instance how the atmospheric temperature–pressure profile and composition would respond to varying degrees of [[insolation]].

== Planetary classes ==

=== Class I: Ammonia clouds ===
{{multiple image

| footer = [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]], two Sudarsky class I gas giants.
}}
Planets in this class have appearances dominated by [[ammonia]] clouds. These planets are found in the outer regions of a [[planetary system]]. They exist at temperatures less than about {{convert|150|K|C F|sigfig=2}}. The predicted Bond [[albedo]] of a class I planet around a [[star]] like the [[Sun]] is 0.57, compared with a value of 0.343 for [[Jupiter]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/jupiterfact.html Jupiter Fact Sheet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and 0.342 for [[Saturn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/saturnfact.html Saturn Fact Sheet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The discrepancy can be partially accounted for by taking into account non-equilibrium condensates such as [[tholin]]s or [[phosphorus]], which are responsible for the coloured clouds in the Jovian atmosphere, and are not modelled in the calculations.

The temperatures for a class I planet require a cool star or a distant orbit. The former stars might be too dim for us even to know about them, and the latter orbits might be too unpronounced for notice until several observations of those ''orbits''' "years" (cf. [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Third law|Kepler's third law]]). [[Superjovian]]s would have enough mass to improve these observations; but a superjovian of comparable age to Jupiter will have more [[internal heat]]ing than said planet, which could push it to a higher class.

As of 2015, [[47 Ursae Majoris c]] and [[47 Ursae Majoris d|d]] could be Class I planets. [[Upsilon Andromedae e]] and [[55 Cancri d]] may also be Class I planets.

=== Class II: Water clouds ===
Planets in class II are too warm to form ammonia clouds; instead their clouds are made up of [[water vapor]]. These characteristics are expected for planets with temperatures below around 250 K (-23°C; -10°F).&lt;ref name="sudarsky2" /&gt; Water clouds are more reflective than ammonia clouds, and the predicted Bond albedo of a class II planet around a Sun-like star is 0.81. Even though the clouds on such a planet would be similar to those of [[Earth]], the atmosphere would still consist mainly of [[hydrogen]] and hydrogen-rich molecules such as [[methane]].

Examples of possible class II planets: [[HD 45364 b]] and [[HD 45364 c]], [[HD 28185 b]], [[Gliese 876 b]] and [[Gliese 876 c|c]], [[Upsilon Andromedae d]], [[55 Cancri f]], [[47 Ursae Majoris b]], [[PH2b]], [[Kepler-90 h]], [[HD 10180 g]].

=== Class III: Cloudless ===
Planets with equilibrium temperatures between about 350 K (170&amp;nbsp;°F, 80&amp;nbsp;°C) and 800 K (980&amp;nbsp;°F, 530&amp;nbsp;°C) do not form global cloud cover, because they lack suitable chemicals in the atmosphere to form clouds.&lt;ref name="sudarsky2" /&gt; These planets would appear as featureless azure-blue globes because of [[Rayleigh scattering]] and absorption by [[methane]] in their atmospheres, appearing like Jovian-mass versions of [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]. Because of the lack of a reflective cloud layer, the Bond albedo is low, around 0.12 for a class-III planet around a Sun-like star. They exist in the inner regions of a planetary system, roughly corresponding to the location of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].

Possible class-III planets are [[HD 37124 b]], [[HD 18742 b]], [[HD 178911 Bb]], [[55 Cancri c]], [[Upsilon Andromedae c]], [[Kepler-89e]], [[COROT-9b]] and [[HD 205739 b]]. Above 700 K (800&amp;nbsp;°F, 430&amp;nbsp;°C), sulfides and chlorides might provide [[cirrus cloud|cirrus]]-like clouds.&lt;ref name="sudarsky2" /&gt;

=== Class IV: Alkali metals ===
Above 900 K (630&amp;nbsp;°C/1160&amp;nbsp;°F), [[carbon monoxide]] becomes the dominant carbon-carrying molecule in a gas giant's atmosphere (rather than [[methane]]). Furthermore, the abundance of [[alkali metal]]s, such as [[sodium]] substantially increase, and [[spectral line]]s of [[sodium]] and [[potassium]] are predicted to be prominent in a gas giant's [[spectrum]]. These planets form cloud decks of [[silicate]]s and [[iron]] deep in their atmospheres, but this is not predicted to affect their spectrum. The Bond albedo of a class IV planet around a Sun-like star is predicted to be very low, at 0.03 because of the strong absorption by alkali metals. Gas giants of classes IV and V are referred to as [[hot Jupiter]]s.

[[55 Cancri b]] was listed as a class IV planet.&lt;ref name="sudarsky2"/&gt;

[[HD 209458 b]] at 1300 K (1000&amp;nbsp;°C) would be another such planet, with a geometric albedo of, within error limits, zero; and in 2001, NASA witnessed atmospheric sodium in its transit, though less than predicted. This planet hosts an upper cloud deck absorbing so much heat that below it is a relatively cool [[stratosphere]]. The composition of this dark cloud, in the models, is assumed to be titanium/vanadium oxide (sometimes abbreviated "TiVO"), by analogy with red dwarfs, but its true composition is yet unknown; it could well be as per Sudarsky.&lt;ref name=hubeny&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Spectrum and atmosphere models of irradiated transiting extrasolar giant planets |arxiv=0807.3588|date=2008 |author1=Ivan Hubeny |author2=Adam Burrows |doi=10.1017/S1743921308026458 |volume=4 |journal=Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union |page=239|bibcode=2009IAUS..253..239H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Radiative Hydrodynamical Studies of Irradiated Atmospheres |arxiv=0807.4541 |date=2008 |author1=Ian Dobbs-Dixon |doi=10.1017/S1743921308026495 |volume=4 |journal=Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union |page=273|bibcode=2009IAUS..253..273D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[HD 189733 b]], with measured temperatures 920–1200 K (650–930&amp;nbsp;°C), also qualifies as class IV. However, in late 2007 it was measured as deep blue, with an albedo over 0.14 (possibly due to the brighter glow of its "hot spot"). No stratosphere has been conclusively proven for it as yet.

[[TrES-2b]] was measured with the lowest albedo, and therefore listed as class IV.

=== Class V: Silicate clouds ===
For the very hottest gas giants, with temperatures above 1400 K (2100&amp;nbsp;°F, 1100&amp;nbsp;°C) or cooler planets with lower gravity than Jupiter, the [[silicate]] and [[iron]] cloud decks are predicted to lie high up in the atmosphere. The predicted Bond albedo of a class V planet around a Sun-like star is 0.55, due to reflection by the cloud decks. At such temperatures, a gas giant may glow red from thermal radiation but the reflected light generally overwhelms thermal radiation. For stars of visual apparent magnitude under 4.50, such planets are theoretically visible to our instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Leigh C. | author2 = Collier C.

'''Taylor's law''' (also known as '''Taylor's power law''') is an empirical law in [[ecology]] that relates the [[variance]] of the [[population density|number of individuals of a species per unit area]] of habitat to the corresponding [[mean]] by a [[power law]] relationship.&lt;ref name=Taylor1961&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=L. R. |year=1961 |title=Aggregation, variance and the mean |journal=Nature |volume=189 |issue=4766 |pages=732–735 |doi=10.1038/189732a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after the ecologist who first proposed it in 1961, [[Roy Taylor (ecologist)|Lionel Roy Taylor]] (1924–2007).&lt;ref name=Southwood1966&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas R. E. Southwood |title=Ecological methods, with particular reference to the study of insect populations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=StwPAQAAMAAJ |year=1966 |publisher=Methuen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor's original name for this relationship was the law of the mean.&lt;ref name=Taylor1961/&gt;

==Definition==
This law was originally defined for ecological systems, specifically to assess the spatial clustering of organisms. For a population count ''Y'' with mean ''µ'' and variance var(''Y''), Taylor's law is written,

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{var} (Y) = a\mu^b,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''b'' are both positive constants. Taylor proposed this relationship in 1961, suggesting that the exponent ''b'' be considered a species specific index of aggregation.&lt;ref name="Taylor1961"/&gt; This power law has subsequently been confirmed for many hundreds of species.&lt;ref name=Taylor1980&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=L. R.|last2=Woiwod|first2=I.

==History==

The first use of a double log-log plot was by [[Osborne Reynolds|Reynolds]] in 1879 on thermal aerodynamics.&lt;ref name=Reynolds1879&gt;Reynolds O (1879) On certain dimensional properties of matter in the gaseous state. Part I. Experimental researches on thermal transpiration of gases through porous plates and on the laws of  transpiration and impulsion, including an experimental proof that gas is not a continuous plenum. Part II. On an extension of the dynamical theory of gas, which includes the stresses, tangential and normal, caused by a varying condition of gas, and affords an explanation of the phenomena of transpiration and impulsion. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London 170:727-845&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] used a similar plot to study the proportion of a population and their income.&lt;ref name=Pareto1897&gt;Pareto V (1897) Cours D'économie Politique. Volume 2. Lausanne: F. Rouge&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The term ''[[variance]]'' was coined by [[Ronald Fisher|Fisher]] in 1918.&lt;ref name=Fisher1918&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fisher | first=RA | title=The correlation between relatives on the supposition of Mendelian inheritance | journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh | year=1918 | volume=52 | pages=399–433 | doi=10.1017/S0080456800012163 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; s^2 = a m + b m^2 &lt;/math&gt;

[[Jerzy Neyman|Neyman]] studied the relationship between the sample mean and variance in 1926.&lt;ref name=Neyman1926&gt;Neyman J (1926) On the correlation of the mean and the variance in samples drawn from an "infinite" population. Biometrika 18:401–413&lt;/ref&gt; [[M. S. Bartlett|Barlett]] proposed a relationship between the sample mean and variance in 1936&lt;ref name=Bartlett1936&gt;Bartlett M (1936) Some notes on insecticide tests in the laboratory and in the field. J Roy Stat Soc Supplement 3: 185–194&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; s^2 = a m + b m^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Smith in 1938 while studying crop yields proposed a relationship similar to Taylor's.&lt;ref name=Smith1938&gt;Smith HF (1938) An empirical law describing heterogeneity in the yield of agricultural crops. J Agric Sci 28: 1-23&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship was

: &lt;math&gt; \log V_x = \log V_1 + b\log x \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is the variance of yield for plots of ''x'' units, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the variance of yield per unit area and ''x'' is the size of plots. The slope (''b'') is the index of heterogeneity. The value of ''b'' in this relationship lies between 0 and 1. Where the yield are highly correlated ''b'' tends to 0; when they are uncorrelated ''b'' tends to 1.

Bliss&lt;ref name=Bliss1941&gt;Bliss CI (1941) Statistical problems in estimating populations of Japanese beetle larve. ''J Econ Entomol'' 34, 221-232&lt;/ref&gt; in 1941, Fracker and Brischle&lt;ref name=Fracker1944&gt;Fracker SB &amp; Brischle HA (1944) Measuring the local distribution of ''Ribes''. Ecology 25: 283–303&lt;/ref&gt; in 1941 and Hayman &amp; Lowe &lt;ref name=Hayman1961&gt;Hayman BI &amp; Lowe AD (1961) The transformation of counts of the cabbage aphid (''Brevicovyne brassicae'' (L.)) NZ J Sci 4:271–278&lt;/ref&gt; in 1961 also described what is now known as Taylor's law, but in the context of data from single species.

L. R. Taylor (1924–2007) was an English entomologist who worked on the Rothamsted Insect Survey for pest control. His 1961 paper used data from 24 papers published between 1936 and 1960. These papers considered a variety of biological settings: [[virus]] lesions, [[zooplankton|macro-zooplankton]], [[worm]]s and [[symphylid]]s in [[soil]], [[insect]]s in soil, on [[plant]]s and in the air, [[mite]]s on [[leaf|leaves]], [[tick]]s on [[sheep]] and [[fish]] in the [[sea]].&lt;ref name="Taylor1961"/&gt; In these papers the ''b'' value lay between 1 and 3. Taylor proposed the power law as a general feature of the spatial distribution of these species. He also proposed a mechanistic hypothesis to explain this law. Among the papers cited were those of Bliss and Yates and Finney.

Initial attempts to explain the spatial distribution of animals had been based on approaches like [[M. S. Bartlet|Bartlett's]] stochastic population models and the [[negative binomial distribution]] that could result from [[birth-death process]]es.&lt;ref name=Taylor1984&gt;Taylor LR (1984) Anscombe’s hypothesis and the changing distributions of insect populations. ''Antenna'' 8, 62–67&lt;/ref&gt;  Taylor's novel explanation was based the assumption of a balanced migratory and congregatory behavior of animals.&lt;ref name="Taylor1961"/&gt;  His hypothesis was initially qualitative, but as it evolved it became semi-quantitative and was supported by simulations.&lt;ref name=Taylor1977&gt;Taylor LR &amp; Taylor RAJ (1977) Aggregation, migration and population mechanics. ''Nature'' 265, 415–421&lt;/ref&gt;  In proposing that animal behavior was the principal mechanism behind the clustering of organisms, Taylor though appeared to have ignored his own report of clustering seen with tobacco necrosis virus plaques.&lt;ref name="Taylor1961"/&gt;

Following Taylor's initial publications several alternative hypotheses for the power law were advanced. Hanski proposed a random walk model, modulated by the presumed multiplicative effect of reproduction.&lt;ref name=Hanski1980&gt;Hanski I (1980) Spatial patterns and movements in coprophagous beetles. ''Oikos'' 34, 293–310&lt;/ref&gt; Hanski's model predicted that the power law exponent would be constrained to range closely about the value of 2, which seemed inconsistent with many reported values.&lt;ref name=Taylor1980 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor1982"/&gt;

Anderson ''et al'' formulated a simple stochastic birth, death, immigration and emigration model that yielded a quadratic variance function.&lt;ref name=Anderson1961&gt;Anderson RD, Crawley GM &amp; Hassell M (1982) Variability in the abundance of animal and plant species. ''Nature'' 296, 245–248&lt;/ref&gt; As a response to this model Taylor argued that such a [[Markov process]] would predict that the power law exponent would vary considerably between replicate observations, and that such variability had not been observed.&lt;ref name=Taylor1983&gt;Taylor LR, Taylor RAJ, Woiwod IP &amp; Perry JN (1983) Behavioural dynamics. ''Nature'' 303, 801–804&lt;/ref&gt;

About this time concerns were, however, raised regarding the statistical variability with measurements of the power law exponent, and the possibility that observations of a power law might reflect more mathematical artifact than a mechanistic process.&lt;ref name=Downing1986&gt;Downing JA (1986) Spatial heterogeneity: evolved behaviour or mathematical artefact? ''Nature'' 323, 255–257&lt;/ref&gt;  Taylor ''et al'' responded with an additional publication of extensive observations which he claimed refuted Downing's concerns.&lt;ref name=Taylor1988&gt;Taylor LR (1988) Specificity of the spatial power-law exponent in ecology and agriculture. ''Nature'' 332, 721–722&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Thórarinsson published a detailed critique of the animal behavioral model, noting that Taylor had modified his model several times in response to concerns raised, and that some of these modifications were inconsistent with earlier versions.&lt;ref name="Thórarinsson1986"&gt; Thórarinsson K (1986) Population density and movement: a critique of Δ-models. ''Oikos'' 189, 70–81&lt;/ref&gt; Thórarinsson also claimed that Taylor confounded animal numbers with density and that Taylor had incorrectly interpreted simulations that had been constructed to demonstrate his models as validation.

Kemp reviewed a number of discrete stochastic models based on the negative binomial, Neyman type A, and Polya–Aeppli distributions that with suitable adjustment of parameters could produce a variance to mean power law.&lt;ref name=Kemp1987&gt;Kemp AW (1987) Families of discrete distributions satisfying Taylor’s power law. ''Biometrics'' 43, 693–699&lt;/ref&gt;  Kemp, however, did not explain the parameterizations of his models in mechanistic terms.  Other relatively abstract models for Taylor's law followed.&lt;ref name="Kendal1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yamamura1990&gt;Yamamura K (1990) Sampling scale dependence of Taylor’s power law. ''Oikos'' 59, 121–125&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of additional statistical concerns were raised regarding Taylor's law, based on the difficulty with real data in distinguishing between Taylor's law and other variance to mean functions, as well the inaccuracy of standard regression methods.&lt;ref name=Routledge1991&gt;Routledge RD &amp; Swartz TB (1991) Taylor’s power law re-examined. ''Oikos'' 60, 107–112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tokeshi1995&gt;Tokeshi M (1995) On the mathematical basis of the variance–mean power relationship. ''Res Pop Ecol'' 37, 43–48&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports also began to accumulate where Taylor's law had been applied to time series data. Perry showed how simulations based on [[chaos theory]] could yield Taylor's law, and Kilpatrick &amp; Ives provided simulations which showed how interactions between different species might lead to Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Perry1994&gt;Perry JN (1994) Chaotic dynamics can generate Taylor’s power law. ''Proc Roy Soc Lond Ser B Biol Sci'' 257, 221–226&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kilpatrick2003&gt;Kilpatrick AM &amp; Ives AR (2003) Species interactions can explain Taylor’s power law for ecological time series. ''Nature'' 422, 65–68&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reports appeared where Taylor's law had been applied to the spatial distribution of plants&lt;ref name=Clark1996&gt;Clark S, Perry JJN &amp; Marshall JP (1996) Estimating Taylor’s power law parameters for weeds and the effect of spatial scale. ''Weed Res'' 36, 405–417&lt;/ref&gt; and bacterial populations&lt;ref name=Ramsayer2011&gt;Ramsayer J, Fellous S, Cohen JE &amp; Hochberg ME (2011) Taylor's Law holds in experimental bacterial populations but competition does not influence the slope. ''Biology Letters''&lt;/ref&gt;  As with the observations of Tobacco necrosis virus mentioned earlier, these observations were not consistent with Taylor's animal behavioral model.

Earlier it was mentioned that variance to mean power function had been applied to non-ecological systems, under the rubric of Taylor's law.  To provide a more general explanation for the range of manifestations of the power law a hypothesis was proposed based on the [[Tweedie distributions]],&lt;ref name="Jørgensen-1997"&gt;{{cite book       | author = Jørgensen, Bent | year = 1997| title = The theory of dispersion models | publisher = [Chapman &amp; Hall] | isbn = 978-0412997112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a family of probabilistic models that express an inherent power function relationship between the variance and the mean.&lt;ref name=Kendal2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kendal2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kendal2002&gt;Kendal WS (2002) Spatial aggregation of the Colorado potato beetle described by an exponential dispersion model. ''Ecol Model'' 151, 261–269&lt;/ref&gt;  Details regarding this hypothesis will be provided in the next section.

A further alternative explanation for Taylor's law was proposed by [[Joel E. Cohen|Cohen]] ''et al'', derived from the [[Richard Lewontin|Lewontin]] Cohen [[Population dynamics|growth model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=J E |author2=Xu, m |author3=Schuster, W S|title=Stochastic multiplicative population growth predicts and interprets Taylor's power law of fluctuation scaling|journal=Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci|year=2013|volume=280|page=20122955}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model was successfully used to describe the spatial and temporal variability of forest populations.

Another paper by Cohen and Xu that random sampling in blocks where the underling distribution is skewed with the first four moments finite gives rise to Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Cohen2015&gt;Cohen JE, Xu M (2015) Random sampling of skewed distributions implies Taylor's power law of fluctuation scaling. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 112(25):7749–7754. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1503824112&lt;/ref&gt; Approximate formulae for the parameters and their variances were also derived. These estimates were tested again data from the Black Rock Forest and found to be in reasonable agreement.

Following Taylor's initial publications several alternative hypotheses for the power law were advanced. Hanski proposed a random walk model, modulated by the presumed multiplicative effect of reproduction.&lt;ref name=Hanski1980&gt;Hanski I (1980) Spatial patterns and movements in coprophagous beetles. ''Oikos'' 34, 293–310&lt;/ref&gt; Hanski's model predicted that the power law exponent would be constrained to range closely about the value of 2, which seemed inconsistent with many reported values.&lt;ref name=Taylor1980 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor1982"/&gt; Anderson ''et al'' formulated a simple stochastic birth, death, immigration and emigration model that yielded a quadratic variance function.&lt;ref name=Anderson1961&gt;Anderson RD, Crawley GM &amp; Hassell M (1982) Variability in the abundance of animal and plant species. ''Nature'' 296, 245–248&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Richard Lewontin|Lewontin]] Cohen [[Population dynamics|growth model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=J E |author2=Xu, m |author3=Schuster, W S|title=Stochastic multiplicative population growth predicts and interprets Taylor's power law of fluctuation scaling|journal=Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci|year=2013|volume=280|page=20122955}}&lt;/ref&gt; is another proposed explanation. The possibility that observations of a power law might reflect more mathematical artifact than a mechanistic process was raised.&lt;ref name=Downing1986&gt;Downing JA (1986) Spatial heterogeneity: evolved behaviour or mathematical artefact? ''Nature'' 323, 255–257&lt;/ref&gt;



===Physics===

In the physics literature Taylor's law has been referred to as ''fluctuation scaling''. Eisler ''et al'', in a further attempt to find a general explanation for fluctuation scaling, proposed a process they called ''impact inhomogeneity'' in which frequent events are associated with larger impacts.&lt;ref name=Eisler2008&gt;Eisler Z, Bartos I &amp; Kertesz (2008) Fluctuation scaling in complex systems: Taylor’s law and beyond. ''Adv Phys'' 57, 89–142&lt;/ref&gt; In appendix B of the Eisler article, however, the authors noted that the equations for impact inhomogeneity yielded the same mathematical relationships as found with the Tweedie distributions.

Another group of physicists, Fronczak and Fronczak, derived Taylor's power law for fluctuation scaling from principles of equilibrium and non-equilibrium [[statistical physics]].&lt;ref name=Fronczak2010&gt;Fronczak A &amp; Fronczak P (2010) Origins of Taylor’s power law for fluctuation scaling in complex systems. ''Phys Rev E'' 81, 066112&lt;/ref&gt; Their derivation was based on assumptions of physical quantities like [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] and an external [[field (physics)|field]] that caused the clustering of biological organisms. Direct experimental demonstration of these postulated physical quantities in relationship to animal or plant aggregation has yet to be achieved, though. Shortly thereafter, an analysis of Fronczak and Fronczak's model was presented that showed their equations directly lead to the Tweedie distributions, a finding that suggested that Fronczak and Fronczak had possibly provided a [[maximum entropy probability distribution|maximum entropy]] derivation of these distributions.&lt;ref name="Kendal2011a"/&gt;

===Mathematics===

Taylor's law has been shown to hold for [[prime number]]s not exceeding a given real number.&lt;ref name=Cohen2016&gt;Cohen JE (2016) Statistics of primes (and probably twin primes) satisfy Taylor's Law from ecology. The American Statistician 70 (4) 399–404&lt;/ref&gt; This result has been shown to hold for the first 11 million primes. If the [[Twin prime|Hardy–Littlewood twin primes conjecture]] is true then this law also holds for twin primes.

===Naming of law===

The law itself is named after the ecologist [[Roy Taylor (ecologist)|Lionel Roy Taylor]] (1924–2007). The name 'Taylor's law' was coined by Southwood in 1966.&lt;ref name=Southwood1966/&gt; Taylor's original name for this relationship was the law of the mean

==The Tweedie Hypothesis==

About the time that Taylor was substantiating his ecological observations, [[Maurice Tweedie|MCK Tweedie]], a British statistician and medical physicist, was investigating a family of probabilistic models that are now known as the [[Tweedie distributions]].&lt;ref name=Tweedie1984&gt;Tweedie MCK (1984) An index which distinguishes between some important exponential families. In: ''Statistics: Applications and New Directions Proceedings of the Indian Statistical Institute Golden Jubilee International Conference'' pp 579-604 Eds: JK Ghosh &amp; J Roy, Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1987"&gt;Jørgensen B (1987)Exponential dispersion models. ''J Roy Stat Soc Ser B'' 49, 127–162}&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned above, these distributions are all characterized by a variance to mean power law mathematically identical to Taylor's law.

The Tweedie distribution most applicable to ecological observations is the [[compound Poisson distribution|compound Poisson-gamma distribution]], which represents the sum of ''N'' independent and identically distributed random variables with a gamma distribution where ''N'' is a random variable distributed in accordance with a Poisson distribution. In the additive form its [[cumulant|cumulant generating function]] (CGF) is:

: &lt;math&gt;K^*_b(s;\theta,\lambda)=\lambda\kappa_b(\theta)\left [\left(1+{s \over \theta}\right)^\alpha-1\right]&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''κ''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;(''θ'') is the cumulant function,

: &lt;math&gt;\kappa_b(\theta)={(\alpha-1)\over \alpha}\left({\theta \over (\alpha-1)}\right)^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;,

the Tweedie exponent

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha=(b-2)/(b-1)&lt;/math&gt;,

''s'' is the generating function variable, and ''θ'' and ''λ'' are the canonical and index parameters, respectively.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen-1997"/&gt;

These last two parameters are analogous to the [[scale parameter|scale]] and [[shape parameter]]s used in probability theory. The [[cumulant]]s of this distribution can be determined by successive differentiations of the CGF and then substituting ''s=0'' into the resultant equations. The first and second cumulants are the mean and variance, respectively, and thus the compound Poisson-gamma CGF yields Taylor's law with the proportionality constant

: &lt;math&gt;a=\lambda^{1/(\alpha-1)}&lt;/math&gt;.

The compound Poisson-gamma cumulative distribution function has been verified for limited ecological data through the comparison of the theoretical distribution function with the empirical distribution function.&lt;ref name=Kendal2002 /&gt; A number of other systems, demonstrating variance to mean power laws related to Taylor's law, have been similarly tested for the compound Poisson-gamma distribution.&lt;ref name=Kendal2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kendal2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kendal2011a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kendal2011b"/&gt;

The main justification for the Tweedie hypothesis rests with the mathematical [[convergence (mathematics)|convergence]] properties of the Tweedie distributions.&lt;ref name=Kendal2004 /&gt; The [[Tweedie distributions|'''Tweedie convergence theorem''']] requires the Tweedie distributions to act as foci of convergence for a wide range of statistical processes.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1994"&gt;Jørgensen B, Marinez JR &amp; Tsao M (1994) Asymptotic behaviour of the variance function. ''Scandinavian Journal of Statistics'' 21, 223–243&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of this convergence theorem, processes based on the sum of multiple independent small jumps will tend to express Taylor's law and obey a Tweedie distribution. A limit theorem for independent and identically distributed variables, as with the Tweedie convergence theorem, might then be considered as being fundamental relative to the ''ad hoc'' population models, or models proposed on the basis of simulation or approximation.&lt;ref name="Kendal2011a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kendal2011b"/&gt;

This hypothesis remains controversial; more conventional [[Population dynamics|population dynamic]] approaches seem preferred amongst ecologists, despite the fact that the Tweedie compound Poisson distribution can be directly applied to population dynamic mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Kendal1995/&gt;

One difficulty with the Tweedie hypothesis is that the value of ''b'' does not range between 0 and 1. Values of ''b'' &lt; 1 are rare but have been reported.&lt;ref name=Wilson1982&gt;Wilson LT &amp; Room PM (1982) The relative efficiency and reliability of three methods for sampling arthropods in Australian cotton fields. J Aust Entomol Soc 21: 175-181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical formulation==

In symbols

: &lt;math&gt; s_i^2 = am_i^b &lt;/math&gt;,

where ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[variance]] of the density of the ''i''th sample, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[mean]] density of the ''i''th sample and ''a'' and ''b'' are constants.

In logarithmic form

: &lt;math&gt; \log s_i^2 = \log a + b\log m_i &lt;/math&gt;

===Scale invariance===

Taylor's law is scale invariant. If the unit of measurement is changed by a constant factor ''c'', the exponent (''b'') remains unchanged.

To see this let ''y'' = ''cx''. Then

&lt;math&gt; \mu_1 = \mathbb{E}( x ) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \mu_2 = \mathbb{E}( y ) =\mathbb{E}( c\,x ) = c \, \mathbb{E}( x ) = c\, \mu_1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \sigma^2_1 = \mathbb{E} ( x - \mu_1 )^2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \sigma^2_2 = \mathbb{E}( y - \mu_2 )^2 = \mathbb{E}( c\,x - c\, \mu_1 )^2 = c^2 \mathbb{E} ( x - \mu_1 )^2 = c^2\, \sigma^2_1 &lt;/math&gt;

Taylor's law expressed in the original variable (''x'') is

&lt;math&gt; \sigma_1^2 = a \mu_1^b &lt;/math&gt;

and in the rescaled variable (''y'') it is

&lt;math&gt; \sigma_2^2 = a \mu_2^b = c^2 \sigma_1^2 = c^2 a \mu_1^b &lt;/math&gt;

It has been shown that Taylor's law is the only relationship between the mean and variance that is scale invariant.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen1997"&gt;Jørgensen B (1997) The theory of exponential dispersion models. Chapman &amp; Hall. London&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extensions and refinements===

A refinement in the estimation of the slope ''b'' has been proposed by Rayner.&lt;ref name=Rayner1985&gt;Rayner JMV (1985) Linear relations in biomechanics: the statistics of scaling functions. J Zoo 206 (3) 415–439&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; b = \frac { f - \varphi + \sqrt{ ( f - \varphi )^2 - 4 r^2 f \varphi } }{ 2 r \sqrt{ f } } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' is the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson moment correlation coefficient]] between log(''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and log&amp;nbsp;''m'', ''f'' is the ratio of sample variances in log(''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and log&amp;nbsp;''m'' and ''φ'' is the ratio of the errors in log(''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''m''.

Ordinary least squares regression assumes that&amp;nbsp;''φ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∞. This tends to underestimate the value of ''b'' because the estimates of both log(''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and log&amp;nbsp;''m'' are subject to error.

An extension of Taylor's law has been proposed by Ferris ''et al'' when multiple samples are taken&lt;ref name=Ferris1990&gt;Ferris H, Mullens TA, Foord KE (1990) Stability and characteristics of spatial description parameters for nematode populations. J Nematol 22(4):427-439&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; s^2 = ( c n^d ) ( m^b ) &lt;/math&gt;,

where ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''m'' are the variance and mean respectively, ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' are constants and ''n'' is the number of samples taken. To date, this proposed extension has not been verified to be as applicable as the original version of Taylor's law.

===Small samples===

An extension to this law for small samples has been proposed by Hanski.&lt;ref name=Hanski1982&gt;Hanski I(1982) On patterns of temporal and spatial variation in animal populations. Ann. zool. Fermici 19: 21—37&lt;/ref&gt; For small samples the Poisson variation (''P'') - the variation that can be ascribed to sampling variation - may be significant. Let ''S'' be the total variance and let ''V'' be the biological (real) variance. Then

: &lt;math&gt; S = V + P &lt;/math&gt;

Assuming the validity of Taylor's law, we have

: &lt;math&gt; V = a m^b &lt;/math&gt;

Because in the Poisson distribution the mean equals the variance, we have

: &lt;math&gt; P = m &lt;/math&gt;

This gives us

: &lt;math&gt; S = V + P = a m^b + m &lt;/math&gt;

This closely resembles Barlett's original suggestion.

===Interpretation===

Slope values (''b'') significantly &gt;&amp;nbsp;1 indicate clumping of the organisms.

In [[Poisson distribution|Poisson-distributed]] data, ''b'' = 1.&lt;ref name=Taylor1983/&gt; If the population follows a [[lognormal distribution|lognormal]] or [[gamma distribution]], then&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.

For populations that are experiencing constant per capita environmental variability, the regression of log( variance ) versus log( mean abundance ) should have a line with ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.

Most populations that have been studied have ''b''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;2 (usually 1.5–1.6) but values of 2 have been reported.&lt;ref name=Boag1992&gt;Boag B, Hackett CA, Topham PB (1992) The use of Taylor's power law to describe the aggregated distribution of gastro-intestinal nematodes of sheep. Int J Parasitol 22(3):267–270&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally cases with ''b'' &gt; 2 have been reported.&lt;ref name=Taylor1980 /&gt; ''b'' values below 1 are uncommon but have also been reported ( ''b'' = 0.93 ).&lt;ref name="Wilson1982"/&gt;

It has been suggested that the exponent of the law (''b'') is proportional to the skewness of the underlying distribution.&lt;ref name=v2015&gt;Cohen J E, Xua M (2015) Random sampling of skewed distributions implies Taylor’s power law of fluctuation scaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2015 112 (25) 7749–7754&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal has criticised: additional work seems to be indicated.&lt;ref name=Anon2015a&gt;Reply to Chen: Under specified assumptions, adequate random samples of skewed distributions obey Taylor's law (2015) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 112 (25) E3157-E3158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anon2015b&gt;Random sampling of skewed distributions does not necessarily imply Taylor's law (2015) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 112 (25) E3156&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notes===

The origin of the slope (''b'') in this regression remains unclear. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain it. One suggests that ''b'' arises from the species behavior and is a constant for that species. The alternative suggests that it is dependent on the sampled population. Despite the considerable number of studies carried out on this law (over 1000), this question remains open.

It is known that both ''a'' and ''b'' are subject to change due to age-specific dispersal, mortality and sample unit size.&lt;ref name=Banerjee1976&gt;Banerjee B (1976) Variance to mean ratio and the spatial distribution of animals. Experientia 32: 993-994&lt;/ref&gt;

This law may be a poor fit if the values are small. For this reason an extension to Taylor's law has been proposed by [[Ilkka Hanski|Hanski]] which improves the fit of Taylor's law at low densities.&lt;ref name=Hanski1982 /&gt;

===Extension to cluster sampling of binary data===

A form of Taylor's law applicable to binary data in clusters (e.q., quadrats) has been proposed.&lt;ref name=Hughes&amp;Madden1992&gt;Hughes G, and Madden LV (1992) Aggregation and incidence of disease. Plant Pathology 41(6):657–660&lt;/ref&gt; In a binomial distribution, the theoretical variance is

: &lt;math&gt; var_{ bin } = n p ( 1 - p ) &lt;/math&gt;,

where ''(var&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt;)'' is the binomial variance, ''n'' is the sample size per cluster, and ''p'' is the proportion of individuals with a trait (such as disease), an estimate of the probability of an individual having that trait.

One difficulty with binary data is that the mean and variance, in general, have a particular relationship: as the mean proportion of individuals infected increases above 0.5, the variance deceases.

It is now known that the observed variance ''(var&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt;)'' changes as a power function of ''(var&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt;)''.&lt;ref name="Hughes&amp;Madden1992"/&gt;

Hughes and Madden noted that if the distribution is Poisson, the mean and variance are equal.&lt;ref name="Hughes&amp;Madden1992"/&gt; As this is clearly not the case in many observed proportion samples, they instead assumed a binomial distribution. They replaced the mean in Taylor's law with the binomial variance and then compared this theoretical variance with the observed variance. For binomial data, they showed that ''var&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt; = var&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt;'' with overdispersion, ''var&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; ''var&lt;sub&gt;bin&lt;/sub&gt;''.

In symbols, Hughes and Madden's modification to Tyalor's law was

: &lt;math&gt; var_{ obs } = a( var_{ bin } )^b &lt;/math&gt;.

In logarithmic form this relationship is

: &lt;math&gt; \log( var_{ obs } ) = \log( a ) + b \log( var_{ bin } ) &lt;/math&gt;.

This latter version is known as the binary power law.

A key step in the derivation of the binary power law by Hughes and Madden was the observation made by Patil and Stiteler&lt;ref name=Patil&amp;Stiteler1974&gt;Patil GP, and Stiteler WM (1974) Concepts of aggregation and their quantification: a critical review with some new results and applications. Researches on Population Ecology 15:238-254&lt;/ref&gt; that the variance-to-mean ratio used for assessing over-dispersion of unbounded counts in a single sample is actually the ratio of two variances: the observed variance and the theoretical variance for a random distribution. For unbounded counts, the random distribution is the Poisson. Thus, the Taylor power law for a collection of samples can be considered as a relationship between the observed variance and the Poisson variance.

More broadly, Madden and Hughes&lt;ref name="Hughes&amp;Madden1992"/&gt; considered the power law as the relationship between two variances, the observed variance and the theoretical variance for a random distribution. With binary data, the random distribution is the binomial (not the Poisson). Thus the Taylor power law and the binary power law are two special cases of a general power-law relationships for heterogeneity.

When both ''a'' and ''b'' are equal to 1, then a small-scale random spatial pattern is suggested and is best described by the binomial distribution. When ''b'' = 1 and ''a'' &gt; 1, there is over-dispersion (small scale aggregation). When ''b'' is &gt; 1, the degree of aggregation varies with ''p''. Turechek ''et al''&lt;ref name="Turechek et al.2011"&gt;Turechek WW, Madden LV, Gent DH, Xu XM (2011) Comments regarding the binary power law for heterogeneity of disease incidence. Phytopathology 101(12):1396-1407&lt;/ref&gt; have showed that the binary power law describes numerous data sets in plant pathology. In general, ''b'' is greater than 1 and less than 2.

The fit of this law has been tested by simulations.&lt;ref name=Gosme2009&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Marie|last1=Gosme|first2=Philippe|last2=Lucas|title=Disease Spread Across Multiple Scales in a Spatial Hierarchy: Effect of Host Spatial Structure and of Inoculum Quantity and Distribution|url=http://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/PHYTO-99-7-0833|journal=Phytopathology|date=2009-06-12|issn=0031-949X|pages=833–839|volume=99|issue=7|doi=10.1094/phyto-99-7-0833|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results suggest that rather than a single regression line for the data set, a segmental regression may be a better model for genuinely random distributions. However, this segmentation only occurs for very short-range dispersal distances and large quadrat sizes.&lt;ref name="Turechek et al.2011"/&gt; The break in the line occurs only at ''p'' very close to 0.

An extension to this law has been proposed.&lt;ref name=Xu2014&gt;Xu X-M, Madden LV (2013) The limits of the binary power law describing spatial variability for incidence data. Plant Pathology 63 (5) 973–982&lt;/ref&gt; The original form of this law is symmetrical but it can be extended to an asymmetrical form.&lt;ref name="Xu2014"/&gt; Using simulations the symmetrical form fits the data when there is positive correlation of disease status of neighbors. Where there is a negative correlation between the likelihood of neighbours being infected, the asymmetrical version is a better fit to the data.

==Applications==

Because of the ubiquitous occurrence of Taylor's law in biology it has found a variety of uses some of which are listed here.

===Recommendations as to use===

It has been recommended based on simulation studies&lt;ref name=Clark1994&gt;Clark SJ &amp; Perry JN (1994) Small sample estimation for Taylor's power law. Environment Ecol Stats 1 (4) 287–302, {{doi|10.1007/BF00469426}}&lt;/ref&gt; in applications testing the validity of Taylor's law to a data sample that:

(1) the total number of organisms studied be &gt; 15&lt;br/&gt;
(2) the minimum number of groups of organisms studied be &gt; 5&lt;br/&gt; 
(3) the density of the organisms should vary by at least 2 orders of magnitude within the sample

===Randomly distributed populations===

It is common assumed (at least initially) that a population is randomly distributed in the environment. If a population is randomly distributed then the mean ( ''m'' ) and variance ( ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ) of the population are equal and the proportion of samples that contain at least one individual ( ''p'' ) is

: &lt;math&gt; p = 1 - e^{ -m } &lt;/math&gt;

When a species with a clumped pattern is compared with one that is randomly distributed with equal overall densities, p will be less for the species having the clumped distribution pattern. Conversely when comparing a uniformly and a randomly distributed species but at equal overall densities, ''p'' will be greater for the randomly distributed population. This can be graphically tested by plotting ''p'' against ''m''.

Wilson and Room developed a binomial model that incorporates Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Wison1983&gt;Wilson LT &amp; Room PM (1983) Clumping patterns of fruit and arthropods in cotton with implications for binomial sampling. Environ Entomol 12:50-54&lt;/ref&gt; The basic relationship is

: &lt;math&gt; p = 1 - e^{ - m \log( s^2 / m )( s^2 / m - 1 )^{ -1 } } &lt;/math&gt;

where the log is taken to the base ''e''.

Incorporating Taylor's law this relationship becomes

: &lt;math&gt; p = 1 - e^{ - m \log( a m^{ b - 1 } )( a m^{ b - 1 } - 1 )^{ -1 } } &lt;/math&gt;

===Dispersion parameter estimator===

The common dispersion parameter (''k'') of the negative binomial distribution is

: &lt;math&gt; k = m^2 / ( s^2 - m ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the sample mean and ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance.&lt;ref name=Bliss1953&gt;Bliss CI and Fisher RA (1953) Fitting the negative binomial distribution to biological data (also includes note on the efficient fitting of the negative binomial). Biometrics 9: 177-200&lt;/ref&gt; If 1 / ''k'' is &gt; 0 the population is considered to be aggregated; 1 / ''k'' = 0 ( ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''m'' ) the population is considered to be randomly (Poisson) distributed and if 1 / ''k'' is &lt; 0 the population is considered to be uniformly distributed. No comment on the distribution can be made if ''k'' = 0.

Wilson and Room assuming that Taylor's law applied to the population gave an alternative estimator for ''k'':&lt;ref name="Wison1983"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; k = \frac { m } { a m^{ b - 1 } - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''b'' are the constants from Taylor's law.

Jones&lt;ref name=Jones1991&gt;Jones VP (1991) Binomial sampling plans for tentiform leafminer (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) on apple in Utah. J Econ Entomol 84: 484-488&lt;/ref&gt; using the estimate for ''k'' above along with the relationship Wilson and Room developed for the probability of finding a sample having at least one individual&lt;ref name="Wison1983"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; p = 1 - e^{ - m \log( a m^{ b - 1 } )( a m^{ b - 1 } - 1 )^{ -1 } } &lt;/math&gt;

derived an estimator for the probability of a sample containing ''x'' individuals per sampling unit. Jones's formula is

: &lt;math&gt; P( x ) = P( x - 1 ) \frac { k + x - 1 } { x } \frac { m k^{ -1 } } { m k^{ -1 } - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''P''( ''x'' ) is the probability of finding ''x'' individuals per sampling unit, ''k'' is estimated from the Wilon and Room equation and ''m'' is the sample mean. The probability of finding zero individuals ''P''( 0 ) is estimated with the [[negative binomial distribution]]

: &lt;math&gt; P( 0 ) = ( 1 + m / k )^{ -k } &lt;/math&gt;

Jones also gives confidence intervals for these probabilities.

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ CI } = t \left( \frac { P( x ) ( 1 - P( x ) ) } { N } \right)^{ 1 / 2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''CI'' is the confidence interval, ''t'' is the critical value taken from the t distribution and ''N'' is the total sample size.

===Katz family of distributions===

Katz proposed a family of distributions (the [[Katz family]]) with 2 parameters ( ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ).&lt;ref name=Katz1965&gt;Katz L (1965) United treatment of a broad class of discrete probability distributions. ''in'' Proceedings of the International Symposium on Discrete Distributions. Montreal&lt;/ref&gt; This family of distributions includes the [[Bernoulli distribution|Bernoulli]], [[Geometric distribution|Geometric]], [[Pascal distribution|Pascal]] and Poisson distributions as special cases. The mean and variance of a Katz distribution are

: &lt;math&gt; m = \frac { w_1 } { 1 - w_2 } &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; s^2 = \frac{ w_1 } { ( 1 - w_2 )^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the mean and ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance of the sample. The parameters can be estimated by the method of moments from which we have

: &lt;math&gt; \frac { w_1 } { ( 1 - w_2 ) } = m &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \frac { w_2 } { ( 1 - w_2 ) } = \frac { s^2 - m } { m } &lt;/math&gt;

For a Poisson distribution ''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''λ'' the parameter of the Possion distribution. This family of distributions is also sometimes known as the Panjer family of distributions.

The Katz family is related to the Sundt-Jewel family of distributions:&lt;ref name=Jewel1981&gt;Jewel W, Sundt B (1981) Improved approximations for the distribution of a heterogeneous risk portfolio. Bull Assoc Swiss Act 81: 221-240&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; p_n = \left( a + \frac{ b }{ n } \right) p_{ n - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

The only members of the Sundt-Jewel family are the Poisson, binomial, negative binomial (Pascal), [[extended truncated negative binomial]] and [[logarithmic series distribution]]s.

If the population obeys a Katz distribution then the coefficients of Taylor's law are

: &lt;math&gt; a = -\log ( 1 - w_2 ) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; b = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Katz also introduced a statistical test&lt;ref name="Katz1965"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; J_n = \sqrt { \frac { n } { 2 } } \frac { s^2 - m } { m } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''J''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the test statistic, ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance of the sample, ''m'' is the mean of the sample and ''n'' is the sample size. ''J''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is asymptotically normally distributed with a zero mean and unit variance. If the sample is Poisson distributed ''J''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 0; values of ''J''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0 and &gt; 0 indicate under and over dispersion respectively. Overdispersion is often caused by latent heterogeneity - the presence of multiple sub populations within the population the sample is drawn from.

This statistic is related to the Neyman-Scott statistic

: &lt;math&gt; NS = \sqrt { \frac { n - 1 } { 2 } } \left( \frac { s^2} { m } - 1 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

which is known to be asymptotically normal and the conditional chi-squared statistic (Poisson dispersion test)

: &lt;math&gt; T = \frac { ( n - 1 ) s^2 } { m } &lt;/math&gt;
 
which is known to have an asymptotic chi squared distribution with ''n'' − 1 degrees of freedom when the population is Poisson distributed.

If the population obeys Taylor's law then

: &lt;math&gt; J_n = \sqrt { \frac { n } { 2 } } ( a m^{ b - 1 } - 1 ) &lt;/math&gt;

===Time to extinction===

If Taylor's law is assumed to apply it is possible to determine the mean time to local extinction. This model assumes a simple random walk in time and the absence of density dependent population regulation.&lt;ref name=Foley1994&gt;Foley P (1994) Predicting extinction times from environmental stochasticity and carrying capacity. Conserv Biol 8: 124-137&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt; N_{ t + 1 } = r N_{ t } &lt;/math&gt; where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;t+1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; are the population sizes at time ''t'' + 1 and ''t'' respectively and ''r'' is parameter equal to the annual increase (decrease in population). Then

: &lt;math&gt; var(r) = s^2 ( \log( r ) ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''var''( ''r'' ) is the variance of ''r''.

Let ''K'' be a measure of the species abundance (organisms per unit area). Then

: &lt;math&gt; T_E = \frac{ 2\log( N ) } { Var( r ) } ( \log( K ) - \frac{ \log( N ) } { 2 }) &lt;/math&gt;

where T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; is the mean time to local extinction.

The probability of extinction by time ''t'' is

: &lt;math&gt; P( t ) = 1 - e^{ \frac{ t } { T_E } } &lt;/math&gt;

===Minimum population size required to avoid extinction===

If a population is [[lognormal distribution|lognormally distributed]] then the [[harmonic mean]] of the population size (''H'') is related to the [[arithmetic mean]] (''m'')&lt;ref name=Pertoldi2008&gt;Pertoldi C, Bach LA, Loeschcke V (2008) On the brink between extinction and persistence. Biol Direct 3: 47 doi: 10.1186/1745-6150-3-47&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; H = m - am^{ ( b - 1 ) } &lt;/math&gt;

Given that ''H'' must be &gt; 0 for the population to persist then rearranging we have

: &lt;math&gt; m &gt; a^{ \frac{ 1 }{ 2 - b } } &lt;/math&gt;

is the minimum size of population for the species to persist.

The assumption of a lognormal distribution appears to apply to about half of a sample of 544 species.&lt;ref name=Halley2002&gt;Halley J, Inchausti P (2002) Lognormality in ecological time series. Oikos 99:518–530. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.11962.x&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that it is at least a plausible assumption.

===Sampling size estimators===

The degree of precision (''D'') is defined to be ''s'' / ''m'' where ''s'' is the [[standard deviation]] and ''m'' is the mean. The degree of precision is known as the [[coefficient of variation]] in other contexts. In ecology research it is recommended that ''D'' be in the range 10-25%.&lt;ref name=Southwood2000&gt;Southwood TRE &amp; Henderson PA (2000) Ecological methods. 3rd ed. Blackwood, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; The desired degree of precision is important in estimating the required sample size where an investigator wishes to test if Taylor's law applies to the data. The required sample size has been estimated for a number of simple distributions but where the population distribution is not known or cannot be assumed more complex formulae may needed to determine the required sample size.

Where the population is Poisson distributed the sample size (''n'') needed is

: &lt;math&gt; n = ( t / D )^2 / m &lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is critical level of the [[Student's t-distribution|t distribution]] for the type 1 error with the [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] that the mean (''m'') was calculated with.

If the population is distributed as a [[negative binomial distribution]] then the required sample size is

: &lt;math&gt; n = ( t / D )^2 ( m + k ) / ( mk ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' is the parameter of the negative binomial distribution.

A more general sample size estimator has also been proposed&lt;ref name=Service1971&gt;Service MW (1971) Studies on sampling larval populations of the ''Anopheles gambiae'' complex. Bull World Health Organ 45: 169-180&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; n = ( t / D )^2 a m^{( b - 2 )} &lt;/math&gt;

where a and b are derived from Taylor's law.

An alternative has been proposed by Southwood&lt;ref name=Southwood1978&gt;Southwood TRE (1978) Ecological methods. Chapman &amp; Hall, London, England&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; n = a m^b / D^2 \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the required sample size, ''a'' and ''b'' are the Taylor's law coefficients and ''D'' is the desired degree of precision.

Karandinos proposed two similar estimators for ''n''.&lt;ref name=Karandinos1976&gt;Karandinos MG (1976) Optimum sample size and comments on some published formulae. Bull Entomol Soc Am 22:417-421&lt;/ref&gt; The first was modified by Ruesink to incorporate Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Ruesink1980&gt;Ruesink WG (1980) Introduction to sampling theory, in Kogan M &amp; Herzog DC (eds.) Sampling Methods in Soybean Entomology. Springer-Verlag New York, Inc, New York. pp 61-78&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; n = ( t / d_m )^2 a m^{( b - 2 )} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'' is the ratio of half the desired confidence interval (''CI'') to the mean. In symbols

: &lt;math&gt; d_m = \frac { CI } { 2m } &lt;/math&gt;

The second estimator is used in binomial (presence-absence) sampling. The desired sample size (''n'') is

&lt;math&gt; n = ( t / d_p )^2 p^{ -1 } q &lt;/math&gt;

where the ''d''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is ratio of half the desired confidence interval to the proportion of sample units with individuals, ''p'' is proportion of samples containing individuals and ''q'' = 1 - ''p''. In symbols

: &lt;math&gt; d_p = \frac { CI } { 2p } &lt;/math&gt;

For binary (presence/absence) sampling, Schulthess ''et al'' modified Karandinos' equation

&lt;math&gt; N = \left( \frac{ t } { D_{ pi } } \right)^2 \frac{ 1 - p }{ p } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the required sample size, ''p'' is the proportion of units containing the organisms of interest, ''t'' is the chosen level of significance and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;ip&lt;/sub&gt; is a parameter derived from Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Schulthess1991&gt;Schulthess F, Bosque-Péreza NA, Gounoua S (1991) Sampling lepidopterous pests on maize in West Africa. Bull Entomol Res 81 (3) 297-301&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sequential sampling===

[[Sequential analysis]] is a method of [[statistical analysis]] where the sample size is not fixed in advance. Instead samples are taken in accordance with a predefined [[stopping rule]]. Taylor's law has been used to derive a number of stopping rules.

A formula for fixed precision in serial sampling to test Taylor's law was derived by Green in 1970.&lt;ref name=Bisseleua2011&gt;Bisseleua DHB, Yede, &amp; Vida S (2011) Dispersion models and sampling of cacao mirid bug ''Sahlbergella singularis'' (Hemiptera: Miridae) on theobroma cacao in southern Cameroon. Environ Entomol 40(1): 111-119&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \log T = \frac{\log ( D^2 ) - a }{ b - 2 } + (\log n) \frac{ b - 1 }{ b - 2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is the cumulative sample total, ''D'' is the level of precision, ''n'' is the sample size and ''a'' and ''b'' are obtained from Taylor's law.

As an aid to pest control Wilson ''et al'' developed a test that incorporated a threshold level where action should be taken.&lt;ref name=Wilson1985&gt;Wilson LT, Gonzalez D &amp; Plant RE(1985) Predicting sampling frequency and economic status of spider mites on cotton. Proc. Beltwide Cotton Prod Res Conf, National Cotton Council of America, Memphis, TN pp 168-170&lt;/ref&gt; The required sample size is

: &lt;math&gt; n = t | m - T |^{ - 2} a m^b &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''b'' are the Taylor coefficients, || is the [[absolute value]], ''m'' is the sample mean, ''T'' is the threshold level and ''t'' is the critical level of the t distribution. The authors also provided a similar test for binomial (presence-absence) sampling

: &lt;math&gt; n = t | m - T |^{ -2 } p q &lt;/math&gt;

where ''p'' is the probability of finding a sample with pests present and ''q'' = 1 - ''p''.

Green derived another sampling formula for sequential sampling based on Taylor's law&lt;ref name=Green1970&gt;Green RH (1970) On fixed precision level sequential sampling. Res Pop Ecol 12 (2) 249-251 {{doi|10.1007/BF02511568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; D = ( a n^{ 1 - b } T^{ b - 2 } )^ { 1 / 2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''D'' is the degree of precision, ''a'' and ''b'' are the Taylor's law coefficients, ''n'' is the sample size and ''T'' is the total number of individuals sampled.

Serra ''et al'' have proposed a stopping rule based on Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Serraa2012&gt;Serraa GV, La Porta NC, Avalos S, Mazzuferi V (2012) Fixed-precision sequential sampling plans for estimating alfalfa caterpillar, ''Colias lesbia'', egg density in alfalfa, ''Medicago sativa'', fields in Córdoba, Argentina. J Insect Sci 13: 41&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; T_n \ge \left( \frac{ a n^{ 1 - b } }{ D^2 } \right)^{ \frac{ 1 } { 2 - b } } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''b'' are the parameters from Taylor's law, ''D'' is the desired level of precision and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the total sample size.

Serra ''et al'' also proposed a second stopping rule based on Iwoa's regression

&lt;math&gt; T_n \ge \frac{ \alpha - 1 }{ D^2 - \frac{ \beta - 1 }{ n } }&lt;/math&gt;

where ''α'' and ''β'' are the parameters of the regression line, ''D'' is the desired level of precision and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the total sample size.

The authors recommended that ''D'' be set at 0.1 for studies of population dynamics and ''D'' = 0.25 for pest control.

==Related analyses==

It is considered to be good practice to estimate at least one additional analysis of aggregation (other than Taylor's law) because the use of only a single index may be misleading.&lt;ref name=Myers1978&gt;Myers JH (1978). Selecting a measure of dispersion. Environ Entomol 7: 619–621&lt;/ref&gt; Although a number of other methods for detecting relationships between the variance and mean in biological samples have been proposed, to date none have achieved the popularity of Taylor's law. The most popular analysis used in conjunction with Taylor's law is probably Iowa's Patchiness regression test but all the methods listed here have been used in the literature.

===Barlett–Iawo model===

Barlett in 1936&lt;ref name=Bartlett1936 /&gt; and later Iawo independently in 1968&lt;ref name=Iwao1968a&gt;Iwao S (1968) A new regression method for analyzing the aggregation pattern of animal populations. Res Popul Ecol 10: 1–20&lt;/ref&gt; both proposed an alternative relationship between the variance and the mean. In symbols

: &lt;math&gt; s_i^2 = am_i + bm_i^2 \, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'' is the variance in the ''i''th sample and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the mean of the ''i''th sample

When the population follows a [[negative binomial distribution]], ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k'' (the exponent of the negative binomial distribution).

This alternative formulation has not been found to be as good a fit as Taylor's law in most studies.

===Nachman model===

Nachman proposed a relationship between the mean density and the proportion of samples with zero counts:&lt;ref name=Nachman1981&gt;Nachman G (1981) A mathematical model of the functional relationship between density and spatial distribution of a population. J Anim Ecol 50: 453–460&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; p_0 = \exp( -a m^b ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the proportion of the sample with zero counts, ''m'' is the mean density, ''a'' is a scale parameter and ''b'' is a dispersion parameter. If ''a'' = ''b'' = 0 the distribution is random. This relationship is usually tested in its logarithmic form

: &lt;math&gt; \log m = c + d \log p_0 &lt;/math&gt;

Allsop used this relationship along with Taylor's law to derive an expression for the proportion of infested units in a sample&lt;ref name=Allsopp1991&gt;Allsopp PG (1991) Binomial sequential sampling of adult ''Saccharicoccus sacchari'' on sugarcane. Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata 60 (3) 213–218&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; P_1 = 1 - \exp\left( -\exp\left( \frac{ \frac{ \log_e \left( \frac{ A^2 } a \right) }{ b - 2 } + \log_e( n )\left( \frac{ b - 1 }{ b - 2 } - 1 \right) - c } d \right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; N = n P_1 &lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt; A^2 = \frac{D^2}{z^2_{\alpha/2}} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the degree of precision desired, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;α/2&lt;/sub&gt; is the upper α/2 of the normal distribution, ''a'' and ''b'' are the Taylor's law coefficients, ''c'' and ''d'' are the Nachman coefficients, ''n'' is the sample size and ''N'' is the number of infested units.

===Kono–Sugino equation===

Binary sampling is not uncommonly used in ecology. In 1958 Kono and Sugino derived an equation that relates the proportion of samples without individuals to the mean density of the samples.&lt;ref name=Kono1958&gt;Kono T &amp; Sugino T (1958) On the estimation of density of rice stem infested by the rice stem borer. Japanese J Appl Entomol and Zool 2: 184&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \log( m ) = \log( a ) + b \log( - \log( p_0 ) ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the proportion of the sample with no individuals, ''m'' is the mean sample density, ''a'' and ''b'' are constants. Like Taylor's law this equation has been found to fit a variety of populations including ones that obey Taylor's law. Unlike the negative binomial distribution this model is independent of the mean density.

The derivation of this equation is straightforward. Let the proportion of empty units be ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and assume that these are distributed exponentially. Then

&lt;math&gt; p_0 = \exp( -A m^B ) &lt;/math&gt;

Taking logs twice and re arranging, we obtain the equation above. This model is the same as that proposed by Nachman.

The advantage of this model is that it does not require counting the individuals but rather their presence or absence. Counting individuals may not be possible in many cases particularly where insects are the matter of study.

;Note

The equation was derived while examining the relationship between the proportion ''P'' of a series of rice hills infested and the mean severity of infestation&amp;nbsp;''m''. The model studied was

: &lt;math&gt; P = 1 - a e^{ b m } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''b'' are empirical constants. Based on this model the constants ''a'' and ''b'' were derived and a table prepared relating the values of ''P'' and&amp;nbsp;''m''

;Uses

The predicted estimates of ''m'' from this equation are subject to bias&lt;ref name=Binns1990&gt;Binns MR &amp; Bostonian NJ (1990) Robustness in empirically based binomial decision rules for integrated pest management. J Econ Entomol 83: 420–442&lt;/ref&gt; and it is recommended that the adjusted mean ( ''m''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; ) be used instead&lt;ref name=Nachman1984&gt;Nachman G (1984) Estimates of mean population density and spatial distribution of ''Tetranychus urticae'' (Acarina: Tetranychidae) and ''Phytoseiulus persimilis'' (Acarina: Phytoseiidae) based upon the proportion of empty sampling units. ''J Appl Ecolog'' 21: 903-991&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; m_a = m \left( 1 - \frac { \operatorname{var}( \log( m_i ) ) } 2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where var is the variance of the sample unit means ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m'' is the overall mean.

An alternative adjustment to the mean estimates is&lt;ref name=Nachman1984/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; m_a = m e^{ ( \text{MSE} / 2 ) } &lt;/math&gt;

where MSE is the mean square error of the regression.

This model may also be used to estimate stop lines for enumerative (sequential) sampling. The variance of the estimated means is&lt;ref name=Schaalje1991&gt;Schaalje GB, Butts RA, Lysyk TL (1991) Simulation studies of binomial sampling: a new variance estimator and density pre&amp;ctor, with special reference to the Russian wheat aphid (Homoptera: Aphididae). J Econ Entomol 84: 140–147&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{var}( m ) = m^2 ( c_1 + c_2 - c_3 + MSE ) &lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt; c_1 = \frac{ \beta^2 ( 1 - p_0 ) }{ n p_0 \log_e( p_0 )^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; c_2 = \frac{ \text{MSE} } { N } + s_{\beta}^2 ( \log_e( \log_e( p_0 ) ) - p^2 ) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; c_3 = \frac{ \exp( a + ( b - 2 )[\alpha - \beta \log_e( p_0 ) ] ) } n &lt;/math&gt;

where MSE is the [[mean square error]] of the regression, ''α'' and ''β'' are the constant and slope of the regression respectively, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance of the slope of the regression, ''N'' is the number of points in the regression, ''n'' is the number of sample units and ''p'' is the mean value of ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in the regression. The parameters ''a'' and ''b'' are estimated from Taylor's law:

: &lt;math&gt; s^2 = a + b \log_e( m ) &lt;/math&gt;

===Hughes–Madden equation===

Hughes and Madden have proposed testing a similar relationship applicable to binary observations in cluster, where each cluster contains from 0 to n individuals.&lt;ref name="Hughes&amp;Madden1992"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; var_\text{obs} = a p^b ( 1 - p )^c &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are constants, ''var&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the observed variance, and p is the proportion of individuals with a trait (such as disease), an estimate of the probability of an individual with a trait. In logarithmic form, this relationship is

: &lt;math&gt; \log( \operatorname{var}_\text{obs} ) = \log( a ) + b \log( p ) + c \log( 1 - p ) .&lt;/math&gt;

In most cases, it is assumed that ''b = c'', leading to a simple model

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{var}_\text{obs} = a ( p( 1 - p ) )^b &lt;/math&gt;

This relationship has been subjected to less extensive testing than Taylor's law. However, it has accurately described over 100 data sets, and there are no published examples reporting that it does not works.&lt;ref name="Turechek et al.2011"/&gt;

A variant of this equation was proposed by Shiyomi et al. (&lt;ref name=Shiyomi1998&gt;Shiyomi M, Egawa T, Yamamoto Y (1998) Negative hypergeometric series and Taylor's power law in occurrence of plant populations in semi-natural grassland in Japan. Proceedings of the 18th International Grassland Congress on grassland management. The Inner Mongolia Univ Press pp 35–43 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;) who suggested testing the regression

: &lt;math&gt; \log( \operatorname{var}_\text{obs} / n^2 ) = a + b \log( p ( 1 - p ) / n ) &lt;/math&gt;

where var&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt; is the variance, ''a'' and ''b'' are the constants of the regression, ''n'' here is the sample size (not sample per cluster) and ''p'' is the probability of a sample containing at least one individual.

===Negative binomial distribution model===

A negative binomial model has also been proposed.&lt;ref name=Wilson1983&gt;Wilson L T &amp; Room PM (1983) Clumping patterns of fruit and arthropods in cotton, with implications for binomial sampling. Environ Entomol 12: 50–54&lt;/ref&gt; The dispersion parameter (''k'') using the method of moments is ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / ( ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; – ''m'' ) and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the proportion of samples with counts &gt; 0. The ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; used in the calculation of ''k'' are the values predicted by Taylor's law. ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is plotted against 1 - ( ''k'' ( ''k'' + ''m'' ) &lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; )&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; and the fit of the data is visually inspected.

Perry and Taylor have proposed an alternative estimator of ''k'' based on Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Perry1986&gt;Perry JN &amp; Taylor LR(1986). Stability of real interacting populations in space and time: implications, alternatives and negative binomial. J Animal Ecol 55: 1053–1068&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; 1/k = am^{ b - 2 } - 1 / m&lt;/math&gt;

A better estimate of the dispersion parameter can be made with the method of [[maximum likelihood]]. For the negative binomial it can be estimated from the equation&lt;ref name="Bliss1953"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \sum \frac { A_x } { k + x } = N \log( 1 + m / k ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is the total number of samples with more than ''x'' individuals, ''N'' is the total number of individuals, ''x'' is the number of individuals in a sample, ''m'' is the mean number of individuals per sample and ''k'' is the exponent. The value of ''k'' has to be estimated numerically.

Goodness of fit of this model can be tested in a number of ways including using the chi square test. As these may be biased by small samples an alternative is the ''U'' statistic – the difference between the variance expected under the negative binomial distribution and that of the sample. The expected variance of this distribution is ''m'' + ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / ''k'' and

: &lt;math&gt; U = s^2 - m + m^2 / k &lt;/math&gt;

where ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the sample variance, ''m'' is the sample mean and ''k'' is the negative binomial parameter.

The variance of U is&lt;ref name="Bliss1953"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{var}( U ) = 2m p^2 q \left( \frac { 1 - R^2 } {-\log( 1 - R ) - R } \right) + p^4 \frac { (1 - R)^{-k} - 1 - kR } { N ( -\log( 1 - R ) - R)^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''p'' = ''m'' / ''k'', ''q'' = 1 + ''p'', ''R'' = ''p'' / ''q'' and ''N'' is the total number of individuals in the sample. The expected value of ''U'' is 0. For large sample sizes ''U'' is distributed normally.

Note: The negative binomial is actually a family of distributions defined by the relation of the mean to the variance

&lt;math&gt; \sigma^2 = \mu + a \mu^p &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''p'' are constants. When ''a'' = 0 this defines the Poisson distribution. With ''p'' = 1 and ''p'' = 2, the distribution is known as the NB1 and NB2 distribution respectively.

This model is a version of that proposed earlier by Barlett.

===Tests for a common dispersion parameter===

The dispersion parameter (''k'')&lt;ref name="Bliss1953"/&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt; k = m^2 / ( s^2 - m ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the sample mean and ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance. If ''k''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is &gt; 0 the population is considered to be aggregated; ''k''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 the population is considered to be random; and if ''k''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is &lt; 0 the population is considered to be uniformly distributed.
 
Southwood has recommended regressing ''k'' against the mean and a constant&lt;ref name=Southwood1978 /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; k_i = a + b m_i &lt;/math&gt;

where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the dispersion parameter and the mean of the ith sample respectively to test for the existence of a common dispersion parameter (''k''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;). A slope (''b'') value significantly &gt; 0 indicates the dependence of ''k'' on the mean density.

An alternative method was proposed by Elliot who suggested plotting ( ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''m'' ) against ( ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / ''n'' ).&lt;ref name=Elliot1977a&gt;Elliot JM (1977) Some methods for the statistical analysis of samples of benthic invertebrates. 2nd ed. Freshwater Biological Association, Cambridge, United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt; ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to 1/slope of this regression.

===Charlier coefficient===

This coefficient (''C'') is defined as

&lt;math&gt; C = \frac{ 100 ( s^2 - m )^{0.5} } { m } &lt;/math&gt;

If the population can be assumed to be distributed in a negative binomial fashion, then ''C'' = 100 (1/''k'')&lt;sup&gt;0.5&lt;/sup&gt; where ''k'' is the dispersion parameter of the distribution.

===Cole's index of dispersion===

This index (''I''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) is defined as&lt;ref name=Cole1946&gt;Cole LC (1946) A theory for analyzing contagiously distributed populations. Ecol 27: 329–341&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; I_c = \frac{ \Sigma x^2 }{ ( \Sigma x )^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

The usual interpretation of this index is as follows: values of ''I''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1, 1, &gt; 1 are taken to mean a uniform distribution, a random distribution or an aggregated distribution.

Because ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = Σ x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − (Σx)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the index can also be written

: &lt;math&gt; I_c = \frac{ s^2 + ( nm )^2 }{ ( nm )^2 } = \frac{ 1 }{ n^2} \frac{ s^2 }{ m^2 } + 1 &lt;/math&gt;

If Taylor's law can be assumed to hold, then

: &lt;math&gt; I_c = \frac{ a m^{ b - 2 } }{ n^2 } + 1 &lt;/math&gt;

===Lloyd's indexes===

Lloyd's index of mean crowding (''IMC'') is the average number of other points contained in the sample unit that contains a randomly chosen point.&lt;ref name=Lloyd1967&gt;Lloyd M (1967) Mean crowding. J Anim Ecol 36: 1–30&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ IMC } = m + s^2 / m - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the sample mean and ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance.

Lloyd's index of patchiness (''IP'')&lt;ref name="Lloyd1967"/&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ IP } = \text{IMC} / m &lt;/math&gt;

It is a measure of pattern intensity that is unaffected by thinning (random removal of points). This index was also proposed by Pielou in 1988 and is sometimes known by this name also.

Because an estimate of the variance of ''IP'' is extremely difficult to estimate from the formula itself, LLyod suggested fitting a negative binomial distribution to the data. This method gives a parameter ''k''

: &lt;math&gt; s^2 = m + \frac{ m^2 }{ k } &lt;/math&gt;

Then

: &lt;math&gt; SE( IP ) = \frac{ 1 }{ k^2 } [ \operatorname{var}( k ) + \frac{ k ( k + 1 ) ( k + m ) }{ mq } ] &lt;/math&gt;

where ''SE''(''IP'') is the standard error of the index of patchiness,''var''(''k'') is the variance of the parameter ''k'' and ''q'' is the number of [[quadrat]]s sampled..

If the population obeys Taylor's law then

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ IMC } = m + a^{ -1 } m^{ 1 - b } - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ IP } = 1 + a^{ -1 } m^{ - b } - \frac { 1 } { m } &lt;/math&gt;

===Patchiness regression test===

Iwao proposed a patchiness regression to test for clumping&lt;ref name=Iwao1968b&gt;Iwao S &amp; Kuno E (1968) Use of the regression of mean crowding on mean density for estimating sample size and the transformation of data for the analysis of variance. Res Pop Ecology, 10, 210–214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ifoulis2006&gt;Ifoulis AA, Savopoulou-Soultani M (2006) Developing optimum sample size and multistage sampling plans for ''Lobesia botrana'' (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) larval infestation and injury in northern Greece. J Econ Entomol 99(5):1890–1898&lt;/ref&gt;

Let

: &lt;math&gt; y_i = m_i + s^2 / m_i - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; here is Lloyd's index of mean crowding.&lt;ref name="Lloyd1967"/&gt; Perform an ordinary least squares regression of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; against&amp;nbsp;''y''.

In this regression the value of the slope (''b'') is an indicator of clumping: the slope&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 if the data is Poisson-distributed. The constant (''a'') is the number of individuals that share a unit of habitat at infinitesimal density and may be &lt; 0, 0 or &gt; 0. These values represent regularity, randomness and aggregation of populations in spatial patterns respectively. A value of ''a'' &lt; 1 is taken to mean that the basic unit of the distribution is a single individual.

Where the statistic ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / ''m'' is not constant it has been recommended to use instead to regress Lloyd's index against ''am'' + ''bm''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; where ''a'' and ''b'' are constants.&lt;ref name=Ho1993&gt;Ho CC (1993) Dispersion statistics and sample size estimates for ''Tetranychus kanzawai'' (Acari: Tetranychidae) on mulberry. Environ Entomol 22: 21–25&lt;/ref&gt;

The sample size (''n'') for a given degree of precision (''D'') for this regression is given by&lt;ref name="Ho1993"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; n = \left( \frac{ t }{ D } \right)^2 ( \frac{ a + 1 } { m } + b - 1 )&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is the constant in this regression, ''b'' is the slope, ''m'' is the mean and ''t'' is the critical value of the t distribution.

Iawo has proposed a sequential sampling test based on this regression.&lt;ref name=Iwao1975&gt;Iwao S (1975) A new method of sequential sampling to classify populations relative to a critical density. Res Popul Ecol 16: 281–28&lt;/ref&gt; The upper and lower limits of this test are based on critical densities m&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; where control of a pest requires action to be taken.

: &lt;math&gt; N_u = im_c + t( i ( a + 1 ) m_c + ( b - 1 ) m_c^2 )^{ 1 / 2 } &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; N_l = im_c - t( i ( a + 1 ) m_c + ( b - 1 ) m_c^2 )^{ 1 / 2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''l''&lt;/sub&gt; are the upper and lower bounds respectively, ''a'' is the constant from the regression, ''b'' is the slope and ''i'' is the number of samples.

Kuno has proposed an alternative sequential stopping test also based on this regression.&lt;ref name=Kuno1969&gt;Kuno E (1969) A new method of sequential sampling to obtain the population estimates with a fixed level of precision. Res. Pooul. Ecol 11: 127–136&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; T_n = \frac { a + 1 } { D^2 - \frac { b - 1 } n } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the total sample size, ''D'' is the degree of precision, ''n'' is the number of samples units, a is the constant and b is the slope from the regression respectively.

Kuno's test is subject to the condition that ''n'' ≥ (''b'' − 1) / ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Parrella and Jones have proposed an alternative but related stop line&lt;ref&gt;Parrella MP, Jones VP (1985) Yellow traps as monitoring tools for ''Liriomyza trifolii'' (Diptera: Agromyzidae) in chrysanthemum greenhouses. J Econ Entomol 78, 53-56&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; T_n = \left( 1 - \frac { n } { N } \right) \frac { a + 1 } { D^2 - \left( 1 - \frac { n } { N } \right) \frac { b - 1 } { n } } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''b'' are the parameters from the regression, ''N'' is the maximum number of sampled units and ''n'' is the individual sample size.

===Morisita’s index of dispersion===

Morisita's index of dispersion ( ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; ) is the scaled probability that two points chosen at random from the whole population are in the same sample.&lt;ref name=Morisita1959&gt;Morisita M (1959) Measuring the dispersion and the analysis of distribution patterns. Memoires of the Faculty of Science, Kyushu University Series E. Biol 2:215–235&lt;/ref&gt; Higher values indicate a more clumped distribution.

: &lt;math&gt; I_m = \frac { \sum x ( x - 1 ) } { n m ( m - 1 ) } &lt;/math&gt;

An alternative formulation is

: &lt;math&gt; I_m = n \frac{ \sum x^2 - \sum x } { ( \sum x )^2 - \sum x } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the total sample size, ''m'' is the sample mean and ''x'' are the individual values with the sum taken over the whole sample.
It is also equal to

: &lt;math&gt; I_m = \frac { n IMC } { ( nm - 1 ) } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''IMC'' is Lloyd's index of crowding.&lt;ref name="Lloyd1967"/&gt;

This index is relatively independent of the population density but is affected by the sample size. Values &gt; 1 indicate clumping; values &lt; 1 indicate a uniformity of distribution and a value of 1 indicates a random sample.

Morisita showed that the statistic&lt;ref name="Morisita1959"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; I_m ( \sum x - 1 ) + n - \sum x &lt;/math&gt;

is distributed as a chi squared variable with ''n'' − 1 degrees of freedom.

An alternative significance test for this index has been developed for large samples.&lt;ref name=Pedigo1994&gt;Pedigo LP &amp; Buntin GD (1994) Handbook of sampling methods for arthropods in agriculture. CRC Boca Raton FL&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; z = \frac { I_m - 1 } { ( 2 / n m^2 ) } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the overall sample mean, ''n'' is the number of sample units and ''z'' is the normal distribution [[abscissa]]. Significance is tested by comparing the value of ''z'' against the values of the [[normal distribution]].

A function for its calculation is available in the statistical [[R language]]. [http://cc.oulu.fi/~jarioksa/softhelp/vegan/html/dispindmorisita.html R function]

===Standardised Morisita’s index===

Smith-Gill developed a statistic based on Morisita's index which is independent of both sample size and population density and bounded by −1 and +1. This statistic is calculated as follows&lt;ref name=Smith-Gill1975&gt;Smith-Gill SJ (1975) Cytophysiological basis of disruptive pigmentary patterns in the leopard frog ''Rana pipiens''. II. Wild type and mutant cell specific patterns. J Morphol 146, 35–54&lt;/ref&gt;

First determine Morisita's index ( ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; ) in the usual fashion. Then let ''k'' be the number of units the population was sampled from. Calculate the two critical values

: &lt;math&gt; M_u = \frac { \chi^2_{ 0.975 } - k + \sum x } { \sum x - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; M_c = \frac { \chi^2_{ 0.025 } - k + \sum x } { \sum x - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

where χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the chi square value for ''n'' − 1 degrees of freedom at the 97.5% and 2.5% levels of confidence.

The standardised index ( ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; ) is then calculated from one of the formulae below

When ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1

: &lt;math&gt; I_p = 0.5 + 0.5 ( \frac { I_d - M_c } { k - M_c } ) &lt;/math&gt;

When ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 1

: &lt;math&gt; I_p = 0.5 ( \frac { I_d - 1 } { M_u - 1 } ) &lt;/math&gt;

When 1 &gt; ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; I_p = -0.5 ( \frac { I_d - 1 } { M_u - 1 } ) &lt;/math&gt;

When 1 &gt; ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; I_p = -0.5 + 0.5 ( \frac { I_d - M_u } { M_u } ) &lt;/math&gt;

''I''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; ranges between +1 and −1 with 95% confidence intervals of ±0.5. ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; has the value of 0 if the pattern is random; if the pattern is uniform, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0 and if the pattern shows aggregation, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0.

===Southwood's index of spatial aggregation===

Southwood's index of spatial aggregation (''k'') is defined as

: &lt;math&gt; \frac {1}{k} = \frac{m^*}{m} - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the mean of the sample and ''m''* is Lloyd's index of crowding.&lt;ref name=Southwood1978 /&gt;

===Fisher's index of dispersion===

Fisher's [[index of dispersion]]&lt;ref name=Elliot1977b&gt;Elliot JM (1977) Statistical analysis of samples of benthic invertebrates. Freshwater Biological Association. Ambleside&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fisher1925&gt;Fisher RA (1925) Statistical methods for research workers. Hafner, New York&lt;/ref&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ID} = \frac{( n - 1 ) s^2 }{ m } &lt;/math&gt;

This index may be used to test for over dispersion of the population. It is recommended that in applications n &gt; 5&lt;ref name=Hoel1943&gt;Hoel P (1943) On the indices of dispersion. Ann Math Statist 14: 155&lt;/ref&gt; and that the sample total divided by the number of samples is &gt; 3. In symbols

: &lt;math&gt; \frac { \sum x } { n } &gt; 3 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''x'' is an individual sample value. The expectation of the index is equal to ''n'' and it is distributed as the [[chi-square distribution]] with ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 degrees of freedom when the population is Poisson distributed.&lt;ref name=Hoel1943 /&gt; It is equal to the scale parameter when the population obeys the [[gamma distribution]].

It can be applied both to the overall population and to the individual areas sampled individually. The use of this test on the individual sample areas should also include the use of a Bonferroni correction factor.

If the population obeys Taylor's law then

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ ID } = ( n - 1 ) a m^{ b - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

===Index of cluster size===

The index of cluster size (''ICS'') was created by David and Moore.&lt;ref name=David1954&gt;David FN &amp; Moore PG (1954) Notes on contagious distributions in plant populations. Ann Bot of London 18:47-53&lt;/ref&gt; Under a random (Poisson) distribution ''ICS'' is expected to equal 0. Positive values indicate a clumped distribution; negative values indicate a uniform distribution.

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ ICS } = s^2 / m - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance and ''m'' is the mean.

If the population obeys Taylor's law

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ ICS } = a m^{ b - 1 } - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

The ''ICS'' is also equal to Katz's test statistic divided by ( ''n'' / 2 )&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; where ''n'' is the sample size. It is also related to Clapham's test statistic. It is also sometimes referred to as the clumping index.

===Green’s index===

Green's index (''GI'') is a modification of the index of cluster size that is independent of ''n'' the number of sample units.&lt;ref name=Green1966&gt;Green RH (1966) Measurement of non-randomness in spatial distributions. Res Pop Ecol 8:1-7&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; C_x = \frac { s^2 / m - 1 } { nm - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

This index equals 0 if the distribution is random, 1 if it is maximally aggregated and −1 / ( ''nm'' − 1 ) if it is uniform.

The distribution of Green's index is not currently known so statistical tests have been difficult to devise for it.

If the population obeys Taylor's law

: &lt;math&gt; C_x = \frac { a m^{ b - 1 } - 1 } { ( nm - 1 ) }&lt;/math&gt;

===Binary dispersal index===

Binary sampling (presence/absence) is frequently used where it is difficult to obtain accurate counts. The dispersal index (''D'') is used when the study population is divided into a series of equal samples ( number of units = ''N'': number of units per sample = ''n'': total population size = ''n'' x ''N'' ).&lt;ref name=Gottwald2007&gt;Gottwald TR, Bassanezi RB, Amorim L, Bergamin-Filho A (2007) Spatial pattern analysis of citrus canker-infected plantings in São Paulo, Brazil, and augmentation of infection elicited by the Asian leafminer. Phytopathology 97(6):674–683&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical variance of a sample from a population with a binomial distribution is

: &lt;math&gt; s^2 = n p ( 1 - p ) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance, ''n'' is the number of units sampled and ''p'' is the mean proportion of sampling units with at least one individual present. The dispersal index (''D'') is defined as the ratio of observed variance to the expected variance. In symbols

: &lt;math&gt; D = \frac {var_{ obs } } { var_{ bin } } = \frac{ s^2 } { n p ( 1 - p ) }&lt;/math&gt;

where ''var''&lt;sub&gt;''obs''&lt;/sub&gt; is the observed variance and ''var''&lt;sub&gt;''bin''&lt;/sub&gt; is the expected variance. The expected variance is calculated with the overall mean of the population. Values of ''D'' &gt; 1 are considered to suggest aggregation. ''D''( ''n'' − 1 ) is distributed as the chi squared variable with ''n'' - 1 degrees of freedom where ''n'' is the number of units sampled.

An alternative test is the ''C'' test.&lt;ref name=Hughes1993&gt;Hughes G &amp; Madden LV (1993) Using the beta-binomial distribution to describe aggregated patterns of disease incidence. Phytopathology 83:759−763&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; C = \frac { D( n N - 1 ) - n N } { ( 2 N ( n^2 - n ) ) ^{ 1 / 2 } } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''D'' is the dispersal index, ''n'' is the number of units per sample and ''N'' is the number of samples. C is distributed normally. A statistically significant value of C indicates [[overdispersion]] of the population.

''D'' is also related to [[intraclass correlation]] ( ρ ) which is defined as&lt;ref name=Fleiss1981&gt;Fleiss JL (1981) Statistical methods for rates and proportions. 2nd ed. Wiley, Newy York, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \rho = 1 - \frac{ \sum x_i ( T - x_i ) } { p ( 1 - p ) N T ( T - 1 ) } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is the number of organisms per sample, ''p'' is the likelihood of the organism having the sought after property (diseased, pest free, ''etc''), and x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of organism in the ''i''th unit with this property. ''T'' must be the same for all sampled units. In this case with ''n'' constant

: &lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac{ D - 1 } { n - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

If the data can be fitted with a [[beta-binomial distribution]] then&lt;ref name="Fleiss1981"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; D = 1 + \frac{ ( n - 1 ) \theta }{ 1 + \theta } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''θ'' is the parameter of the distribution.&lt;ref name=Hughes1993 /&gt;

===Ma's population aggregation critical density===

Ma has proposed a parameter (''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) − the population aggregation critical density - to relate population density to Taylor's law.&lt;ref name=Ma1991&gt;Ma ZS (1991) Further interpreted Taylor’s Power Law and population aggregation critical density. Trans Ecol Soc China (1991) 284–288&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; m_0 = \exp( \frac{ \log ( a ) }{ 1 - b } ) &lt;/math&gt;

==Related statistics==

A number of statistical tests are known that may be of use in applications.

===de Oliveria's statistic===

A related statistic suggested by de Oliveria&lt;ref name=deOliveria1965&gt;de Oliveria T (1965) Some elementary tests for mixtures of discrete distributions, ''in'' Patil, GP ''ed.'', Classical and contagious discrete distributions. Calcutá, Calcutta Publishing Society pp379-384&lt;/ref&gt; is the difference of the variance and the mean.&lt;ref name=Bohning1994&gt;Bohning D (1994) A note on a test for Poisson overdispersion. Biometrica 81(2) 418-419&lt;/ref&gt; If the population is Poisson distributed then

: &lt;math&gt; var( s^2 - m ) = \frac{ 2t^2 } { n - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is the Poisson parameter, ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance, ''m'' is the mean and ''n'' is the sample size. The expected value of ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - ''m'' is zero. This statistic is distributed normally.&lt;ref name=Ping1995&gt;Ping S (1995) Further study on the statistical test to detect spatial pattern. Biometrical J 37(2) 199–203&lt;/ref&gt;

If the Poisson parameter in this equation is estimated by putting ''t'' = ''m'', after a little manipulation this statistic can be written

: &lt;math&gt; O_T = \sqrt { \frac { n - 1 } { 2 } } \frac { s^2 - m } { m } &lt;/math&gt;

This is almost identical to Katz's statistic with ( ''n'' - 1 ) replacing ''n''. Again ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; is normally distributed with mean 0 and unit variance for large ''n''. This statistic is the same as the Neyman-Scott statistic.

;Note

de Oliveria actually suggested that the variance of ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - ''m'' was ( 1 - 2''t''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; + 3''t'' ) / ''n'' where ''t'' is the Poisson parameter. He suggested that ''t'' could be estimated by putting it equal to the mean (''m'') of the sample. Further investigation by Bohning&lt;ref name="Bohning1994"/&gt; showed that this estimate of the variance was incorrect. Bohning's correction is given in the equations above.

===Clapham's test===

In 1936 Clapham proposed using the ratio of the variance to the mean as a test statistic (the relative variance).&lt;ref name=Clapham1936&gt;Clapham AR (1936) Overdispersion in grassland communities and the use of statistical methods in plant ecology. J Ecol 14: 232&lt;/ref&gt; In symbols

: &lt;math&gt; \theta = \frac{ s^2 }{ m } &lt;/math&gt;

For a Possion distribution this ratio equals 1. To test for deviations from this value he proposed testing its value against the chi square distribution with ''n'' degrees of freedom where ''n'' is the number of sample units. The distribution of this statistic was studied further by Blackman&lt;ref name=Blackman1942&gt;Blackman GE (1942) Statistical and ecological studies on the distribution of species in plant communities. I. Dispersion as a factor in the study of changes in plant populations. Ann Bot N.s. vi: 351&lt;/ref&gt; who noted that it was approximately normally distributed with a mean of 1 and a variance ( ''V''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; ) of

: &lt;math&gt; V_{ \theta } = \frac{ 2n } { ( n - 1 )^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

The derivation of the variance was re analysed by Bartlett&lt;ref name=Greig-Smith1952&gt;Greig-Smith P (1952) The use of random and contiguous quadrats in the study of the structure of plant communities. Ann. Bot. 16:293-316&lt;/ref&gt; who considered it to be

: &lt;math&gt; V_{ \theta } = \frac{ 2 } { n - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

For large samples these two formulae are in approximate agreement. This test is related to the later Katz's ''J''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; statistic.

If the population obeys Taylor's law then

: &lt;math&gt; \theta = am^{ b - 1 } &lt;/math&gt;

;Note

A refinement on this test has also been published&lt;ref name=Gosset1986&gt;Gosset E, Louis B (1986) The binning analysis - Towards a better significance test. Astrophysics Space Sci 120 (2) 263-306&lt;/ref&gt; These authors noted that this test tends to detect overdispersion at higher scales even when this was not present in the data. They noted that the use of the multinomial distribution may be more appropriate than the use of a Poisson distribution for such data. The statistic ''θ'' is distributed

: &lt;math&gt; \theta = \frac{ s^2 }{ m } = \frac{ 1 } { n } \sum{ ( x_i - \frac{ n }{ N } )^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the number of sample units, ''n'' is the total number of samples examined and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are the individual data values.

The expectation and variance of ''θ'' are

: &lt;math&gt; E( \theta ) = \frac{ N } { N - 1} &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; Var( \theta ) = \frac{ ( N - 1 )^2 } { N^3 } - \frac { 2N - 3 } { nN^2 }&lt;/math&gt;

For large ''N'' ''E''(θ) is approximately 1 and

: &lt;math&gt; Var( \theta ) \sim\ \frac{ 2 } { N } ( 1 - \frac{ 1 } { n } ) &lt;/math&gt;

If the number of individuals sampled ( ''n'' ) is large this estimate of the variance is in agreement with those derived earlier. However, for smaller samples these latter estimates are more precise and should be used.

A '''timestamp''' is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred, usually giving date and time of day, sometimes accurate to a small fraction of a second. The term derives from [[rubber stamp]]s used in offices to stamp the current date, and sometimes time, in ink on paper documents, to record when the document was received.  Common examples of this type of timestamp are a [[postmark]] on a letter or the "in" and "out" times on a [[time clock|time card]].
 
In modern times usage of the term has expanded to refer to digital date and time information attached to digital data.  For example, [[computer file]]s contain timestamps that tell when the file was last modified, and [[digital camera]]s add timestamps to the pictures they take, recording the date and time the picture was taken.

==Digital timestamps==
A timestamp is the time at which an event is recorded by a computer, not the time of the event itself.&lt;ref name="BernsteinNewcomer2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Philip A. Bernstein|author2=Eric Newcomer|title=Principles of Transaction Processing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmHgK5KKrQQC&amp;pg=PA263|date=24 July 2009|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-0-08-094841-6|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2018}} In many cases, the difference may be inconsequential: the time at which an event is recorded by a timestamp (e.g., entered into a log file) should be close to the time of the event.

This data is usually presented in a consistent format, allowing for easy comparison of two different records and tracking progress over time; the practice of recording timestamps in a consistent manner along with the actual data is called [[timestamping (computing) | '''timestamping''']]. The sequential numbering of events is sometimes called timestamping.&lt;ref name="Medeiros2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claudia Maria Bauzer Medeiros|title=ADVANCED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS -Volume I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBnFDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59|date=19 September 2009|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=978-1-905839-91-9|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timestamps are typically used for [[Data logging|logging events]] or in a [[sequence of events]] (SOE), in which case each event in the log or SOE is marked with a timestamp.

Practically all computer file systems store one or more timestamps in the [[file system#Metadata | per-file metadata]].
In particular, most modern operating systems support the POSIX [[stat (system call)]], so each file has 3 timestamps associated with it:
time of last access (atime: ls -lu),
time of last modification (mtime: ls -l), and
time of last status change (ctime: ls -lc).

Some [[file archiver]]s and some [[comparison of version control software | version control software]], when they copy a file from some remote computer to the local computer, adjust the timestamps of the local file to show the date/time in the past when that file was created or modified on that remote computer, rather than the date/time when that file was copied to the local computer.

== Examples ==
Examples of timestamps:
* Tue 01-01-2009 6:00
* 2005-10-30 T 10:45 [[UTC]]
* 2007-11-09 T 11:20 [[UTC]]
* Sat Jul 23 02:16:57 2005
* 1256953732 ([[Unix time]])
* (1969-07-21 T 02:56 UTC){{snd}} 
* 07:38, 11 December 2012 (UTC)
* 1985-102 T 10:15 UTC ''(day 102 of year 1985 = 12 April 1985)''
* 1985-W15-5 T 10:15 UTC ''(day 5 of week 15 of year 1985 = 12 April 1985)''
* 20180203073000 (02/03/2018 7:30:00)

==Standardization==
[[ISO 8601]] standardizes the representation of dates and times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dotat.at/tmp/ISO_8601-2004_E.pdf
|title=ISO 8601:2004(E)
|accessdate=2010-03-07
|date=2004-12-01
|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]
|quote=3.5 Expansion … By mutual agreement of the partners in information interchange, it is permitted to expand the component identifying the calendar year, which is otherwise limited to four digits. This enables reference to dates and times in calendar years outside the range supported by complete representations, i.e. before the start of the year [0000] or after the end of the year [9999].}}&lt;/ref&gt; These standard representations are often used to construct timestamp values.

==Other meanings==
'''Timestamp''' can also refer to:

* A [[time code]] (in networking or video technology)
* [[Unix time]], the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970
* [[ICMP Timestamp]]
* A [[Trusted timestamping|digitally signed timestamp]] whose signer [[wikt:vouch|vouches]] for the existence of the signed document or content at the time given as part of the [[digital signature]]
* The modification or access [[system time|time]] of a [[computer file|file]] or [[directory (file systems)|directory]] in a computer [[file system]] or [[database]]
* A proof of authenticity of a person (if a picture is timestamped it asserts the image is original) on sites such as [[4chan]]

'''Yishai Schlissel''' (also spelled '''Shlisel'''; {{lang-he-n|ישי שליסל}}; born 10 December 1975) is an [[Israel]]i convicted criminal. He stabbed marchers during the [[Jerusalem gay pride parade]] in 2005, for which he served ten years in prison. On 30 July 2015, during the 2015 Jerusalem gay pride, he stabbed 16-year-old Shira Banki to death, and wounded six other people. The incident occurred just three weeks after his release from prison. On 24 August, Schlissel was indicted for murder, six counts of attempted murder, and wounding under aggravating circumstances,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.co.il/1.2714458’], ''An indictment for murder against Yishai Schlissel'', Haaretz, August 24, 2015 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; and detained until the end of proceedings. On June 26 2016, he was sentenced to life plus 31 years in prison, as well as pay NIS 2,064,000 (around $650,000) in damages. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Life-sentence-for-Jerusalem-pride-parade-stabber-who-killed-teen-girl-457749], ''Life sentence for Jerusalem pride parade stabber who killed teen girl'', The Jerusalem Post, June 26, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Schlissel was born on 10 December 1975 in [[Yad Binyamin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/pm-visits-pride-attack-victim-defends-right-to-live-in-peace/ PM visits pride attack victim, defends ‘right to live in peace’], ''The Times of Israel'', July 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bhol"&gt;[http://www.bhol.co.il/Article.aspx?id=87722מוזר ומופנם, או איש עקרונות  קנאי - מי אתה ישי שליסל?], July 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest of ten children. His parents are the children of [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivors. He studied [[Talmud]], and is very religious. He later studied in a [[kolel]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="bhol"/&gt;

==Criminal acts and convictions==
In 2005, Schlissel stabbed three marchers during the gay pride parade in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="timesofisraelsixstabbed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcnewsultra"/&gt; As a result, he was convicted of [[attempted murder]] and [[aggravated assault]],&lt;ref name="haaretzchaim"/&gt; and sentenced to twelve years in prison.&lt;ref name="bbcnewsultra"/&gt; In 2007, his sentence was reduced to ten years on appeal. Schlissel served his sentence at [[Maasiyahu Prison]]. In 2008, he was hospitalized for a month and a half over mental health issues and diagnosed with a paranoid psychiatric condition.&lt;ref&gt;http://10tv.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=1141498&lt;/ref&gt; Schlissel was released in June 2015.&lt;ref name="sixstabbedatjerusalem"&gt;{{cite news|title=6 stabbed at Jerusalem Gay Pride Parade by ultra-Orthodox Jewish assailant|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/1.668796|publisher=Haaretz|date=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.668832&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his release, he distributed a homophobic letter in his hometown which read, "It is the obligation of every Jew to keep his soul from punishment and stop this giant desecration of God's name next Thursday."&lt;ref name="pinknewsjoe"&gt;Joe Williams, [http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/08/02/victim-of-jerusalem-pride-attack-dies-of-injuries/ Victim of Jerusalem Pride attack dies of injuries], ''[[PinkNews]]'', August 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He was not tracked by the Judea and Samaria Police District because his previous crime had occurred in Jerusalem, outside of their jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="sixstabbedatjerusalem"/&gt; Moreover, [[Moshe Edry]], the chief of the Jerusalem District Police, was not warned that Schlissel would be coming to Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="sixstabbedatjerusalem"/&gt;

On 30 July 2015, only three weeks after being released, he stabbed six marchers during the [[Jerusalem gay pride parade]].&lt;ref name="timesofisraelsixstabbed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcnewsultra"/&gt; The act was widely condemned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yishai Schlissel: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know|url=http://heavy.com/news/2015/07/yishai-schlissel-jerusalem-gay-pride-stabbing-2005-attack-release/|publisher=Heavy.com|date=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; including by Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]].&lt;ref name="timesofisraelstuart"&gt;Stuart Winer, [http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-slams-gay-pride-attack-we-will-bring-those-responsible-to-justice/ After attack on pride parade, PM condemns ‘despicable hate crime’], ''The Times of Israel'', July 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; One of the victims, 16-year-old Shira Banki, died of her wounds at the [[Hadassah Medical Center]] three days later, on 2 August 2015.&lt;ref name="pinknewsjoe"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/1.669161|date=August 2, 2015|accessdate=August 2, 2015|first=Yaniv|last=Kubovich|newspaper=Haaretz|title=16-year-old stabbed in Jerusalem pride parade succumbs to wounds}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Prime Minister Netanyahu offered his condolences, adding "We will deal with the murderer to the fullest extent of the law."&lt;ref name="pinknewsjoe"/&gt;

A psychiatric evaluation by the [[Israel Prison Service]], with which Schlissel refused to cooperate, found him fit to stand trial. However, after state psychiatrists argued that his refusal to cooperate rendered the evaluation inconclusive, the court ordered that he be hospitalized for a 48-hour observation period for reevaluation. He was again found fit to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timesofisrael.com/gay-parade-stabber-deemed-fit-to-stand-trial/&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 August 2015, Shlissel was charged with one count of murder and six counts of attempted murder and aggravated assault at the Jerusalem District Court.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4693866,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; He refused to recognize the authority of the court to try him due to it not abiding by Jewish religious law.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timesofisrael.com/pride-parade-stabber-to-undergo-further-psychiatric-evaluation/&lt;/ref&gt; He announced that he would refuse to be represented by an attorney, and did not cooperate with the public defender assigned to represent him. On April 19, 2016, he was convicted.&lt;ref name="jtajerusalemgayprideparade"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jerusalem gay pride parade stabber convicted of murder|url=http://www.jta.org/2016/04/19/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/jerusalem-gay-pride-parade-stabber-convicted-of-murder|accessdate=April 20, 2016|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 26, 2016, he was sentenced to life plus 31 years in prison, and was ordered to pay [[New Israeli shekel|NIS]] 2,064,000 in compensation to the families of his victims. 

Schlissel is serving his sentence in [[Ayalon Prison]]. In August 2016, Schlissel tore up pictures of another inmate's daughters due to them being "immodestly dressed", and was subsequently beaten by the inmate until guards separated them. Schlissel was hospitalized as a result of the beating he sustained, and was temporarily placed in solitary confinement as a disciplinary measure. After prison authorities carried out an evaluation, it was decided to separate him from other inmates due to his volatile behavior, and he was given his own cell in a protected area of the prison. One month later,  Schlissel was again attacked and had to be hospitalized after an argument between him and two convicted mobsters in the prison yard escalated to the mobsters beating him until guards intervened.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timesofisrael.com/gay-pride-killer-beaten-up-in-prison-in-argument-over-his-crime/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4842863,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Before his prison sentence, Schlissel resided in [[Modi'in Illit]], a [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] [[Israeli settlement]] and city in the [[West Bank]].&lt;ref name="haaretzchaim"&gt;Chaim Levinson, Yaniv Kubovich, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/.premium-1.668832 Israel Police to probe failure to monitor Jerusalem gay pride parade assailant], ''Haaretz'', July 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He is an Israeli [[ultra-Orthodox Judaism|ultra-Orthodox Jew]].&lt;ref name="timesofisraelsixstabbed"&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/six-stabbed-at-jerusalem-pride-parade-by-same-assailant-who-attacked-parade-in-2005/ Six stabbed at Jerusalem pride parade by same assailant who attacked parade in 2005], ''The Times of Israel'', July 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcnewsultra"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-33726634 Jerusalem Gay Pride: Six stabbed 'by ultra-Orthodox Jew'], ''BBC News'', July 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his crime, he was married, with four children.&lt;ref name="bhol"/&gt; He divorced his wife at the beginning of his imprisonment in 2005.&lt;ref name="bhol"/&gt;
