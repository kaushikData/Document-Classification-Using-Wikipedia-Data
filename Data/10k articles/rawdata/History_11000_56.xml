On 20 March 2013, three [[South Korea]]n television stations and a bank suffered from frozen computer terminals in a suspected act of [[cyberwarfare]].&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;Tania Branigan, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/20/south-korea-under-cyber-attack "South Korea on alert for cyber-attacks after major network goes down: Computer systems of banks and broadcasters are interrupted, with fingers immediately pointed at North Korea"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 20 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  ATMs and mobile payments were also affected. The South Korean communications watchdog raised their alert level on cyber-attacks to three on a scale of five. [[North Korea]] has been blamed for similar attacks in 2009 and 2011 and was suspected of launching this attack as well. South Korean officials linked the incident to a [[China|Chinese]] [[IP address]], which increased suspicion of [[North Korea]] as "[i]ntelligence experts believe that North Korea routinely uses Chinese computer addresses to hide its cyber-attacks." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=China IP address link to South Korea cyber-attack |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21873017 |newspaper=[[BBC]] |location= |date=21 March 2013 |access-date=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malware]] related to the attack is called "DarkSeoul" in the computer world and was first identified in 2012. The [[Financial Services Commission (South Korea)|Financial Services Commission of South Korea]] said that [[Shinhan Bank]] reported that its Internet banking servers had been temporarily blocked and that {{Interlanguage link multi|Jeju Bank|ko|3=제주은행}} and [[National Agricultural Cooperative Federation|NongHyup]] reported that operations at some of their branches had been paralyzed after computers were infected with viruses and their files erased. [[Woori Bank]] reported a hacking attack, but said it had suffered no damage. Computer shutdowns also hit companies including the [[Korean Broadcasting System]], [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation]], and [[YTN]].&lt;ref&gt;Choe Sang-Hun, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/world/asia/south-korea-computer-network-crashes.html "Computer Networks in South Korea Are Paralyzed in Cyberattacks"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 20 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Korean government asserted a Pyongyang link in the March [[cyberattacks]], which has been denied by Pyongyang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lee Minji |date=April 10, 2013 |title=(2nd LD) Gov't confirms Pyongyang link in March cyber attacks |url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2013/04/10/49/0401000000AEN20130410007352320F.HTML |newspaper=[[Yonhap News]] |location= |access-date=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 50-year-old South Korean man identified as Mr. Kim is suspected to be involved in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324136204578639540757695644|title=Seoul Suspects South Korean Tech Executive of Helping North in Cyberattacks|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|author=Jeyup S.

The painting '''''Ahasveros and Haman at the Feast of Esther''''' is one of the few works of [[Rembrandt van Rijn]] whose complete [[provenance]] is known.  The origin of the painting can be traced back to 1662, two years after its completion. {{cquote|''There are only three figures in the picture and the banquet is suggested sketchily. Esther lowers her arms apprehensively as she finishes her speech, the king's lips are pursed in anger, and Haman's pose reveals a sense of doom. The distance between the king and his vizier seems enormous, while the king and queen form a united pair.&lt;ref&gt;Tyazehlov, V. N. (2008) The Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, Room 10, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Subject==
The subject is an episode from chapters 5-7 of the [[book of Esther]] in the [[Old Testament]].  [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]], counciller to the king [[Ahasuerus]], proposed to hang [[Mordechai]] for not paying him respect by standing as he entered the room or by greeting him, and the entire Jewish nation as revenge for their pride. The Jews were saved by the intercession of Mordechai's cousin [[Esther]], who was also Ahasuerus' wife.  It is this rescue that is still celebrated in the Jewish festival of [[Purim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Webberley |first=Helen |work=Rembrandt and The Purim Story |publisher=Jewishmag.com |date= February 2008 |url=http://www.jewishmag.com/121mag/rembrandt-purim-art/rembrandt-purim-art.htm |title=The Purim Story and the Dutch Artists}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In that festival, Haman is portrayed as the villain, and this is reflected in Rembrandt's depiction of him.

According to the [[Pushkin Museum]] this is one of the best creations of Rembrandt's late period.

{{cquote|''The dramatic conflict between the three persons is expressed through their restrained but eloquent gestures. The scene has a tense atmosphere of suspense. The figure of Esther is radiant, her robe with a long train is gleaming as if with precious stones. Haman is immersed in the shadows. Rembrandt achieves great depth in rendering the inner life, the spiritual energy of his characters.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.ru/gmii/defengl.htm The Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024125053/http://www.museum.ru/gmii/defengl.htm |date=October 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Rembrandt==
Rembrandt was inspired by the play ''Hester'', by Johannes Serwouters (1623-1677), when painting "Ahasuerus and Haman at the feast of Esther".  The [[playwright]] was first performed in 1659 in the [[Schouwburg of Van Campen]] and dedicated to Leonore Huydecoper, the daughter of [[Joan Huydecoper I|Joan Huydecoper van Maarsseveen]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, G. (2006) Rembrandts Universe, His Art His Life His World, {{ISBN|0-500-09331-8}}, p. 112; Schwartz, G. (1987) Rembrandt, zijn leven, zijn schilderijen. Een nieuwe biografie met alle beschikbare schilderijen in kleur afgebeeld, p. 272-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Serwouters wrote his play as a reaction to the [[pogrom]]s in Eastern Europe. Her husband may have ordered the painting, in this way helping Rembrandt being in financial difficulties.

After its completion in 1660, [[Rembrandt]] sold the painting ''Ahasuerus and Haman at the feast of Esther'' to [[Jan J. Hinlopen]].&lt;ref&gt;Dudok van Heel, S.A.C. (1969) De Rembrandt's in de verzamelingen Hinlopen. In: Maandblad Amstelodamum, pp. 233-237. (In Dutch.)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the year 1662 a poetry book by [[Jan Vos (poet)|Jan Vos]] was published, in which there were a number of poems based on the paintings belonging to Jan J. Hinlopen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Vos |first=Jan |authorlink=Jan Vos (poet) |title=Alle de gedichten van Jan Vos |publisher= |year=1726 |location= |pages=360–63, 388, 516, 536|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uVM_AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |id= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jan Vos describes the painting as following:

[[Image:Schouwbrug_van_campen1.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Engravure of the Playhouse Van Campen in 1658 by [[Salomon Savery]]]]

::''Here one sees Haman eating with Ahasuerus and Esther.
::''But it is in vain; his breast is full of regret and pain.
::''He eats Esther's food; but deeper into her heart.
::''The king is mad with revenge and rage.
::''The wrath of a monarch...&lt;ref&gt;From: Slive, S. (1953) Rembrandt and his critics, 1630-1730, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
Part of Jan Hinlopen's collection passed to his two daughters, this painting was one of them.
[[Sara Hinlopen]], the longest living of her family, died 89 years old, but without children.&lt;ref&gt;One of her in-laws mentioned in his diary she left a considerable amount of money ''being stingy''.  In: Het dagboek van J. Bicker Raye, bewerkt door F.M. Bijerinck &amp; M.G. de Boer, (1935), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of her belongings passed to Nicolaes [[Geelvinck]] and his three sisters. Unfortunately, her will does not mention any painting, most probably to avoid inheritance taxes.

In 1760 ''Ahasuerus and Haman at the Feast of Esther'' was sold as number 45 at an auction, listed as coming from [[Nicolaes Geelvinck]], and organized after the death of [[Gerard Hoet]], a minor painter but important collector in [[The Hague]].&lt;ref&gt;Catalogus of naamlyst van schilderyen, met derzelver prysen, zedert ... 1752. tot ... 1768. ... openbaar verkogt. Dienende tot een vervolg ... op de ... cataloguen door Gerard Hoet ... / Uitgegeeven door Pieter Terwesten, 1770. pp. 220-234.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1764 the painting came to [[Catherine the Great]], most probably through the German entrepreneur [[Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky]], in financial trouble after the [[Seven Years' War]]. After receiving 320 paintings at one time from  Gotzkowsky, the Russian [[Tsarina]] started the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]].

Probably advised by [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen]] the painting went in 1862 to the [[Museum Rumyantsev]] in Moscow. Since 1924  'Ahasuerus and Haman at the Feast of Esther' can be seen in the [[Pushkin Museum]], also in Moscow.

* ''[[Adam (TV movie)|Adam]]''—Recounted the story of [[Murder of Adam Walsh|Adam Walsh]], who was abducted from a Florida shopping center.  The film brought attention to how kidnapped children were poorly tracked by federal government agencies. It prompted the formation of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and led to the passage of the [[Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act]] in July 2006.  Because of his outspoken advocacy on behalf of missing and exploited children, Adam's father, [[John Walsh (television host)|John Walsh]], has become a public figure, and is now perhaps best known as host of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] television show ''[[America's Most Wanted]]''.
* ''The [[Ryan White]] Story''&lt;ref name="bhcourier"/&gt;—Highlighted the discrimination faced by a young hemophiliac who contracted AIDS from a blood transfusion and promoted tolerance for children afflicted by AIDS.

'''Augusto Marinoni''' (15 June 1911, [[Legnano]] - 31 December 1997)&lt;ref&gt;http://data.bnf.fr/12314465/augusto_marinoni/&lt;/ref&gt; was professor of Filologia Romanza at the [[Catholic University of Milan]], a member of the [[Commissione Vinciana]] and the [[Academy of Lincei]]. He was an authority on the work of [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

==Early life==
After completing his classical studies, he enrolled at ' Catholic University of the Sacred Heart , where he obtained in 1933 a degree in Literature and Philosophy [3] . Thanks to the lexicographic study, which began during the preparation of the thesis and continued later, Marinoni was able to identify the genesis, which is rooted in the Middle Ages , of the dictionary .

==Career==
In 1936 he obtained a degree in Italian and Latin at Liceo Vittorio Veneto in Milan. In these years he began his studies on Leonardo da Vinci thanks to his knowledge in the lexiconic field. His work was initially focused on the eight thousand words contained in the Trivulzian Code , and the result of his studies was published by Giovanni Treccani while Marinoni was a prisoner of war ( 1943 - 1946 ) following his participation in the Second World War on the Front of the ' North Africa . He resumed his studies on Leonardo in 1952, on the occasion of the cinquecentennial of the birth of the genius vinciano. Thanks to the quality of her work, she received the applause of the members of a congress of Leonardo scholars that took place in Paris in the same year.

In 1958 he was appointed head of the Legnano high school . Two years later, thanks to the initiative of Marinoni, a high school in gymnasium was opened in Legnano in the high school. Also in 1958 he began collaborating with the Catholic University of Milan, where he taught romance philology until 1981 .

In 1968 he was appointed by President of the Republic Giuseppe Saragat , a member of the Ministerial Commission for the Manuscripts of Leonardo da Vinci . In this commission, Marinoni worked on the study, translation and description of winery codes preserved in Italy , namely the Trivulzian Code , the Atlantic Code and the Code on Bird Flight . Thanks to this immense work, Marinoni has published since the seventies all 14 volumes of the codes in question .
In 1972, he began cooperation with Ladislao Reti on the transcription of the Madrid Codes , discovered in the Spanish capital. In 1974 he dealt with the dissemination of these codes, which were published in seven languages from MacGraw Hill.

Thanks to the quality of his work, Marinoni is considered the greatest expert on the philology of Leonardo da Vinci and the greatest expert of philosophical and scientific thought vinciano. Marinoni continued his studies on Leonardo da Vinci and continued his divulging activity, holding seminars in various European and world cities. Many companies, such as Philips and IBM , contributed to publishing their works and many cultural world institutions invited him to hold seminars and meetings. It is up to Marinoni to make the first CD-ROM with multimedia content on Leonardo da Vinci. He studied and published the contents of Code Forster in 1977, kept at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London , and the Ashburnham Code , guarded at the Institut de France in Paris. In 1982 he was appointed president of the Vinciana Collector 's Office in Milan, which still raises the greatest Italian and foreign scholars of Leonardo da Vinci . Among the awards he received, the Hammer "for excellence" , obtained from the University of Los Angeles in 1987 , should be remembered.

Augusto Marinoni also studied in depth the history of his city , Legnano, and his dialect . Augusto Marinoni is headquartered in the municipal library of Legnano, which is housed inside Villa Bernocchi .

==Gregorian Code discovery==
In 2010 the Volterra database was used by [[Simon Corcoran|Corcoran]] and Salway to identify previously unknown fragments of the [[Gregorian Code]]. The "Fragmenta Londiniensia" are seventeen pieces of parchment estimated to date from AD400, the document having been cut up and re-used as book-binding material. This is the first original evidence yet discovered of the Gregorian Codex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/?p=3466 |title=Lost Roman legal text found |first=Roger |last=Pearse |date=27 January 2010 |accessdate=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/News/Podcasts/Pages/lostromanlaw.aspx |title=Lost Roman law code discovered in London |publisher=[[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] |date=28 January 2010 |accessdate=28 January 2010 |format=Podcast |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314192605/http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/News/Podcasts/Pages/lostromanlaw.aspx |archivedate=14 March 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jack2010&gt;{{cite news |title=Cracking the codex: Long lost Roman legal document discovered |last=Jack |first=Malcolm |date=28 January 2010 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/news/cracking-the-codex-long-lost-roman-legal-document-discovered-1881769.html|quote=These fragments are the first direct evidence of the original version of the Gregorian Code.

'''Christopher Knight''' is an author who has written several books dealing with theories such as [[Pseudoscientific_metrology#366_geometry|366-degree geometry]] and the origins of [[Freemasonry]]. Knight appears in the two-part [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] documentary ''[[Decoding the Past]]'' &amp;ndash; "Mysteries of the Freemasons".

In an interview about the book ''Who Built the Moon?: 2005'' Knight stated that the moon is an artificial construction probably built by humans with a message in "[[base ten]] arithmetic so it looks as though it is directed to a ten digit species that is living on Earth right now - which seems to mean humans." He believes that it was created to make life on Earth possible, including humans, and that the most likely builders were humans of the future using time travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Who Built the Moon? - An Interview With Christopher Knight|journal=New Dawn|date=May–June 2006|issue=96|url=http://www.newdawnmagazine.com/articles/who-built-the-moon-an-interview-with-christopher-knight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CLI seeks to address some of the "threats to validity and reliability"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Seidman, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; that can occur ''during'' an interview and to increase the "trustworthiness" of the data collected.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; It does this by employing a technique that minimises the ''unintended''  introduction of ''interviewer'' content, assumption, leading question structure, presupposition, framing, priming, tacit metaphor and nonverbal aspects such as paralanguage and gesture that may compromise the authenticity of the data collected.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Tosey, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time Clean Language Interviewing seeks to minimise common ''interviewee'' biases, such as the ''consistency effect'', ''acquiescence bias'' and the ''friendliness effect'' which may mean an interviewee (unconsciously) looks for cues from the interviewer about how to answer.&lt;ref&gt;Podsakoff et al., 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, a systematic application of a ‘cleanness rating’ protocol provides a quantitive measure of adherence to interview guidelines and by extension the trustworthiness of the data collected.

CLI can be considered a [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenologically]]-based interview method, similar in intent to neuro- and micro-phenomenology,&lt;ref&gt;Petitmengin, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; psycho-phenomenology,&lt;ref&gt;Mathison &amp; Tosey, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; phenomenography,&lt;ref&gt;Reid &amp; Solomonides, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and Interpersonal Process Recall.&lt;ref&gt;Larson et al., 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Clean Interviewing can be seen as a method of operationalising the phenomenological aim of [[Bracketing (phenomenology)|bracketing (epoché)]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; CLI is also an integral part of a new qualitative research methodology, Modelling Shared Reality which suggests that by paying careful attention to the language they use, qualitative researchers can reduce undesired influence and unintended bias during all stages of research—design, data gathering, analysis and reporting.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;van Helsdingen &amp; Lawley, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== History == 
Clean Interviewing derived from [[Clean Language]], the language model of therapeutic processes devised by David Grove&lt;ref&gt;Grove &amp; Panzer, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; which has since found application in education, business, organisational change, health and academic research.&lt;ref&gt;Lawley &amp; Tompkins, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Grove devised the principles of Clean Language in the 1980s and continued to develop a specific question set until his death in 2008. Although Owen first suggested applying Clean Language to phenomenological research in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;Owen, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; it was not until 2010 that the first systematic research into the veracity of the method was conducted and published in the ''British Journal of Management''.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Tosey, Lawley &amp; Meese, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features == 
The features of Clean Interviewing include: the specificity of the technique; minimising ''unintended'' influence; data collection from the perspective of the interviewee; its applicability to in-depth interviews; elicitation of naturally occurring autogenic metaphor; investigating tacit knowledge; evaluation research; modelling mental models; and the verifiability of the adherence to the method.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Lawley, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Lawley &amp; Linder-Pelz, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Linder-Pelz &amp; Lawley, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Nehyba &amp; Svojanovsky, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

CLI seeks to address the issues raised by research that demonstrates responses can materially be affected by: question construction;&lt;ref&gt;Loftus &amp; Palmer, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; framing;&lt;ref&gt;Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; changing a single word;&lt;ref&gt;Loftus &amp; Zanni, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heritage et al., 2007&lt;/ref&gt; introduced metaphors;&lt;ref&gt;Thibodeau &amp; Boroditsky, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thibideau &amp; Boroditsky, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; presupposition;&lt;ref&gt;Loftus, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; and the nonverbal behaviour of the interviewer such as paralanguage&lt;ref&gt;Duncan et al.,1969&lt;/ref&gt; and gesture.&lt;ref&gt;Gurney et al., 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in these studies, not only did the subjects show little or no awareness of being subtly and systematically influenced, many reported their answers with a high degree of confidence.&lt;ref&gt;Loftus &amp; Hoffman, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of training required to become a proficient interviewer is commonly underestimated&lt;ref&gt;Cho, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kvale &amp; Brinkmann, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and because of the rigour of the CLI technique, training and practice are required to become a competent clean interviewer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tosey et al., 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cleanness rating ==
Roulston maintains “researchers must demonstrate the quality of their work in ways that are commensurate with their assumptions about their use of interviews”&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Roulston, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; yet systematic methods for assessing the reliability and validity of the data collected during an interview are noticeably absent from published research.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A “Cleanness Rating” can be used to measure the proportion of ‘clean’ to ‘leading’ interviewer interventions and hence the authenticity or trustworthiness of the data collected (i.e. how much is sourced in the interviewee's lexicon). An independent examination of interview transcripts allocates one of four categories (Classically clean; Contextually clean; Mildly leading; Strongly leading) to every question or statement made by the interviewer. The tabulated results are used to arrive at a summary assessment for each interview. Interviewers experienced in CLI can consistently achieve over 85% of ‘clean’ interventions whereas as many as two-thirds of the questions asked by an untrained interviewer may be ‘leading’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Critique == 
The assumption that interviewers can minimise their influence on the collection of data has been questioned for several decades&lt;ref&gt;Mishler, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; and the social constructivist school claims all knowledge is co-constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners of CLI do not claim it does not influence nor that it is “non-directive”.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, 1943&lt;/ref&gt; They acknowledge that the interviewer's role is to set the overall frames and direct the general flow of the interview&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and they emphasise that all questions, including clean questions, set frames, contain presuppositions and invite the interviewee to attend to certain aspects of his or her experience. Clean questions aim to stay within the lexicon and inherent logic expressed by the interviewee and leave them maximally free to answer from within his or her frames of reference. Tosey maintains that, "accounts are co-constructed through the ''process'' of selecting and asking questions. At the same time, Clean Language [Interviewing] aims to minimise the co-construction of the ''content''."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

As yet there has been no comprehensive test of the premise that interviews with a high cleanness rating result in higher quality data. Rather, an interview with a low cleaness rating may raise questions about compliance with research protocols and doubts about the authorship of the data collected.

Other forms of interviewing would be more appropriate where the researcher intentionally aims for the ‘co-construction of meaning’ or to challenge and change the understandings of participants, as in ‘transformative interviews’.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Some critics have maintained that the metaphor ‘clean’ is pejorative to other methods. Grove settled on the metaphor after discovering how others (unwittingly) ‘contaminate’ another person's perceptions with introduced content and presupposition – including [[Carl Rogers]] the originator of "non-directive therapy".&lt;ref&gt;Tompkins &amp; Lawley, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
There has been growing use of Clean Interviewing. While it is ideally suited to research (especially eliciting naturally occurring metaphors), it has also be used by police interviewers, Critical Incident investigators and in commercial projects such as requirements gathering, market research and organisational change. Examples of published research include:

* Tacit and explicit knowledge acquisition among student teachers in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Cáscová, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* Comparison of the evidence of coach competency from three perspectives.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 
* Elicitation of 30 European business leaders’ metaphors and mental models of leadership and its development.&lt;ref&gt;Cairns-Lee, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subjectivity of coachees' experience and outcomes.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; 
* Managers' metaphors of work-life balance.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 
* A Dutch case study into the role of knowledge in greening flood protection.&lt;ref&gt;Janssen et al., 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
* Iranian students’ metaphors for their teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Akbari, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* A mid-term review of the Dutch ''Living with Water'' project.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  
* Professional Development Planning at a UK university.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon &amp; Walker, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* Legacy of war experiences of members of the Ulster Defence Regiment.&lt;ref&gt;Snoddon, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition Clean Interviewing has been used in a range of PhD research topics:

* Ways in which pervasive media can contribute to a multimodal holistic user experience of the ambulant landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Calderwood, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
* Factors that influence employment choices amongst older employees in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;Hanley, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
* An exploration of leadership and its development through the inner worlds of leaders using metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Cairns-Lee, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
* A model of spiritual leadership and self-development in a Spiritual Order in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;Munsoor, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
* How older workers in the fire and rescue service deal with work-life balance issues as they approach and transition through retirement.&lt;ref&gt;Pickerden, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* Whether senior partners in legal services firms possess the core characteristics of identity to work in alignment within the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Vanson, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9349">The '''Ebla tablets''' are a collection of as many as 1,800 complete [[clay tablet|clay tablets]], 4,700 fragments, and many thousands of minor chips found in the palace archives&lt;ref&gt;Numbers as in R. Biggs, "The Ebla tablets: an interim perspective", ''The Biblical Archaeologist'' '''43''' (1980:76-87); Palace G in the excavation reports.&lt;/ref&gt; of the ancient city of [[Ebla]], [[Syria]]. The tablets were discovered by [[Italy|Italian]] archaeologist [[Paolo Matthiae]] and his team in 1974–75&lt;ref name="Moorey"/&gt; during their excavations at the ancient city at [[Tell Mardikh]].&lt;ref&gt;Hans H. Wellisch, "Ebla: The World's Oldest Library", ''The Journal of Library History'' '''16'''.3 (Summer 1981:488-500) p. 488f.&lt;/ref&gt; The tablets, which were found ''[[In situ#Archaeology|in situ]]'' on collapsed shelves, retained many of their contemporary clay tags to help reference them. They all date to the period between ca. 2500 BC and the destruction of the city ca. 2250 BC.&lt;ref name="Dumper1"&gt;Dumper; Stanley, 2007, p.141.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the tablets are held in museums in the Syrian cities of [[Aleppo]], [[Damascus]], and [[Idlib]].

==Discovery and archaeological context==
The tablets were discovered just where they had fallen when their wooden shelves burned in the final conflagration of "Palace G". The archive was kept in orderly fashion in two small rooms off a large audience hall (with a [[Dais|raised dais]] at one end); one repository contained only bureaucratic economic records on characteristic round tablets, the other, larger room held ritual and literary texts, including pedagogical texts for teaching young scribes. Many of the tablets had not previously been baked, but when all were preserved by the fire that destroyed the palace, their storage method served to fire them almost as thoroughly as if in a [[kiln]]: they had been stored upright in partly recessed wooden shelves, rectos facing outward, leaning backwards at an angle so that the ''[[incipit]]'' of each tablet could be seen at a glance, and separated from one another by fragments of baked clay. The burning shelving pancaked &amp;ndash; collapsing in place and preserving the order of the tablets.&lt;ref&gt;Succinctly described in Wellisch 1981:492.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
Two languages appeared in the writing on the tablets: [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], and a previously unknown language that used the [[Sumer]]ian [[cuneiform script]] (Sumerian logograms or "[[Sumerogram]]s") as a phonetic representation of the locally spoken [[Eblaite|Ebla language]].&lt;ref name=Hetzron&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hetzron|first1=Robert|title=The Semitic Languages|date=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-05767-1|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWhHAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter script was initially identified as [[Canaanite languages|proto-Canaanite]] by professor [[Giovanni Pettinato]], who first deciphered the tablets, because it predated the [[Semitic languages]] of [[Canaan]], like [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Pettinato later retracted the designation and decided to call it simply "[[Eblaite]]", the name by which it is known today.&lt;ref name="Dumper1"/&gt;

The purely phonetic use of Sumerian logograms marks a momentous advance in the [[history of writing]].&lt;ref&gt;The point is briefly made by Stephen D. Cole, in a letter "Eblaite in Sumerian Script" in ''The Biblical Archaeologist'' '''40'''.2 (May 1977:49).&lt;/ref&gt; From the earlier system developed by Sumerian scribes, employing a mixed use of logograms and phonetic signs, the scribes at Ebla employed a reduced number of signs from the existing systems entirely phonetically, both the earliest example of [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] (rendering sounds in a system invented for another language) and a major simplifying step towards "[[Usability|reader friendliness]]" that would enable a wider spread of [[literacy]] in palace, temple and merchant contexts.

==Content and significance==
The tablets provide a wealth of information on Syria and Canaan in the Early [[Bronze Age]],&lt;ref&gt;Four volumes of essays on the Ebla language and the archives were published by the Center for Ebla Research, New York University, as the series ''Eblaitica'', begun in 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; and include the first known references to the "[[Canaanites]]", "[[Ugarit]]", and "[[Lebanon]]".&lt;ref name="Dumper"/&gt; The contents of the tablets reveal that Ebla was a major trade center. A main focus was economic records, inventories recording Ebla's commercial and political relations with other [[Levant]]ine cities and logs of the city's import and export activities. For example, they reveal that Ebla produced a range of [[beer]]s, including one that appears to be named "Ebla", for the city.&lt;ref name="Dumper1"/&gt; Ebla was also responsible for the development of a sophisticated trade network system between city-states in northern Syria. This system grouped the region into a commercial community, which is clearly evidenced in the texts.&lt;ref name="Dumper"/&gt;

There are [[Regnal year|king lists]] for the city of Ebla, royal ordinances, edicts, treaties. There are [[gazetteer]]s listing [[place name]]s, including a version of a standardized place-name list that has also been found at [[Abu Salabikh]] (possibly ancient [[Eresh (disambiguation)|Eresh]]) where it was dated to ca. 2600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Pettinato, "L'atlante geografico del vicino oriente attestato ad Ebla e ad Abū Salābikh", ''Orientalia'' '''47''' (1978:50-73).&lt;/ref&gt; The literary texts include hymns and rituals, epics, proverbs.

Many tablets include both [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and Eblaite inscriptions with versions of three basic [[bilingual]] word-lists contrasting words in the two languages. This structure has allowed modern scholars to clarify their understanding of the Sumerian language, at that time still a living language, because until the discovery of the tablet corpus there were no bilingual dictionaries with Sumerian and other languages, leaving pronunciation and other phonetic aspects of the language unclear. The only tablets at Ebla that were written exclusively in Sumerian are [[lexical lists]], probably for use in training [[scribe]]s.&lt;ref name="Dumper1"/&gt; The archives contain thousands of copybooks, lists for learning relevant [[jargon]], and scratch pads for students, demonstrating that Ebla was a major educational center specializing in the training of scribes.&lt;ref name="Dumper"&gt;Dumper; Stanley, 2007, p.142.&lt;/ref&gt; Shelved separately with the dictionaries, there were also [[Syllabary|syllabaries]] of Sumerian words with their pronunciation in Eblaite.

=== Biblical archaeology ===
{{Further|Ebla-Biblical controversy|Biblical archaeology}}
The application of the Ebla texts to specific places or people in the [[Bible]] occasioned controversy, focused on whether the tablets made references to, and thus confirmed, the existence of [[Abraham]], [[David]] and [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] among other Biblical references.&lt;ref name="Dumper"/&gt; The sensationalist claims were made by [[Giovanni Pettinato]] and were coupled with delays in the publication of the complete texts, and it soon became an unprecedented academic crisis.&lt;ref name="Moorey"&gt;Moorey, 1991, p.150–152.&lt;/ref&gt; The political context of the modern [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] also added fire to the debate, turning it into a debate about the "proof" for [[Zionism|Zionist]] claims to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="Dumper"/&gt;

However, much of the initial media excitement about supposed Eblaite connections with the Bible, based on preliminary guesses and speculations by Pettinato and others, is now widely deplored as generated by "exceptional and unsubstantiated claims" and "great amounts of disinformation that leaked to the public".&lt;ref&gt;Chavalas, 2003, P.40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; The present consensus is that Ebla's role in [[biblical archaeology]], strictly speaking, is minimal.&lt;ref name="Moorey"/&gt;

'''Election cybersecurity''' or '''election security''' refers to the protection of [[election]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openelectiondata.net/en/guide/key-categories/security/|title=Election Security - Section 3: Key Election Process Categories - Unleashing the Potential of Election Data - Open Election Data Initiative|website=openelectiondata.net|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and voting infrastructure from [[cyberattack]] or cyber threat&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cfrd8-files.cfr.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/CyberBrief_Fidler_Elections_OR_2.pdf|title=Transforming Election Cybersecurity, Council on Foreign Relations|last=Fidler|first=David|date=May 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; – including the tampering with or infiltration of voting machines and equipment, election office networks and practices, and voter registration databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/election-security-preparedness/|title=Election Security Preparedness - BeReady16 {{!}} US Election Assistance Commission|website=www.eac.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyber threats or attacks to elections or voting infrastructure could be carried out by insiders within a voting [[jurisdiction]], or by a variety of other actors ranging from nefarious [[Nation state|nation-states]], to organized cyber criminals to [[Lone wolf (terrorism)|lone-wolf]] hackers. Motives may range from a desire to influence the election outcome, to discrediting democratic processes, to creating public distrust or even political upheaval.

== United States ==

The U.S. is characterized by a highly decentralized election administration system. Elections are a constitutional responsibly of state and local election entities such as secretaries of state, election directors, county clerks or other local level officials encompassing more than 6,000+ local subdivisions nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/election-administration-at-state-and-local-levels.aspx|title=Election Administration at State and Local Levels|last=Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|website=www.ncsl.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, election security has been characterized as a national security concern increasingly drawing the involvement of federal government entities such as the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  In early 2016, Jeh Johnson, Secretary of Homeland Security designated elections as “critical infrastructure” making the subsector eligible to receive prioritized cybersecurity assistance and other federal protections from the Department of Homeland Security.  The designation applies to storage facilities, polling places, and centralized vote tabulations locations used to support the election process, and information and communications technology to include voter registration databases, voting machines, and other systems to manage the election process and report and display results on behalf of state and local governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/01/06/statement-secretary-johnson-designation-election-infrastructure-critical|title=Statement by Secretary Johnson on the Designation of Election Infrastructure as a Critical Infrastructure Subsector|date=2017-01-06|work=Department of Homeland Security|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Election security has become a major focus and area of debate in recent years, especially since the [[2016 U.S. Presidential Election]].  In 2017, DHS confirmed that a U.S. foreign adversary, Russia, attempted to interfere in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election via “a multi-faceted approach intended to undermine confidence in [the American] democratic process."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/os-jmanfra-062117.PDF|title=Congressional Testimony of Jeanette Manfra, then-Acting Deputy Under Secretary For Cybersecurity and Communications, National Protection And Programs Directorate, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, before the Select Committee on Intelligence, United States Senate, June 21, 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included conducting cyber espionage against political targets, launching propaganda or “information operations” (IO) campaigns on social media, and accessing elements of multiple U.S. state or local electoral boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf|title=ICA: Intelligence Community Assessment. “Background to “Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections: The Analytic Process and Cyber Incident Attribution.” January 9, 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 22, 2017, it was reported that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) notified 21 states that were targeted by Kremlin-backed hackers during the 2016 election. Those states included Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Arizona, California, Iowa, Texas, and Wisconsin.  Currently, hackers only reportedly succeeded in breaching the voter registration system of one state: Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2018/02/12/446336/election-security-50-states/#fn-446336-2|title=Election Security in All 50 States - Center for American Progress|work=Center for American Progress|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the 2016 hacking, a growing bench of national security and cyber experts have emerged noting that Russia is just one potential threat. Other actors including North Korea, Iran, organized criminals possess, and individual hackers have motives and technical capability to infiltrate or interfere with elections and democratic operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2018/02/12/446336/election-security-50-states/#fn-446336-6|title=Election Security in All 50 States - Center for American Progress|work=Center for American Progress|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leaders and experts have warned that a future attack on elections or voting infrastructure by Russian-backed hackers or others with nefarious intent, such as seen in 2016, is likely in 2018 and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/30/russia-2018-election-meddling-376826|title=Pompeo: 'I have every expectation' Russia will meddle in 2018 midterms|work=POLITICO|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/06/top-us-intel-official-russia-will-likely-try-influencing-2018-us-vote.html|title=Top intel official: 'Highly likely' Russia will seek to influence 2018 US vote|last=CNBC|date=2018-03-06|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/27/politics/cybercom-rogers-trump-russian-cyber-threat/index.html|title=US cyber chief says Trump hasn't told him to confront Russian cyber threat|last=CNN|first=Zachary Cohen,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Europe ==

Russia's 2016 attempts to interfere in U.S. elections fits a pattern of similar incidents across Europe for at least a decade. Cyberattacks in Ukraine, Bulgaria, Estonia, Germany, France and Austria that investigators attributed to suspected Kremlin-backed hackers appeared aimed at influencing election results, sowing discord and undermining trust in public institutions that include government agencies, the media and elected officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/01/10/russias-pattern-meddling-money-laundering-and-murder-influence-abroad-poses-threat-2018-u-s-election/1019012001/|title=Russia's pattern of meddling abroad exposes threat to 2018 U.S. elections: report|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In late 2017, the United Kingdom through its intelligence agencies made claims that a Russian IO campaign played a damaging role in its Brexit referendum vote in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/world/europe/russia-brexit-twitter-facebook.html|title=Signs of Russian Meddling in Brexit Referendum|last=Kirkpatrick|first=David D.|date=2017-11-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of white hat hackers ==

The [[White hat (computer security)|"white hat" hacker community]] has also been involved in the public debate. From July 27–30, 2017, [[DEF CON|DEFCON]] – the world’s largest, longest running and best-known hacker conference – hosted a “Voting Machine Hacking Village” at its annual conference in Las Vegas, Nevada to highlight election security vulnerabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2017/07/30/hackers-defcon-conference-exploit-vulnerabilities-voting-machines/523639001/|title=Hackers at DefCon conference exploit vulnerabilities in voting machines|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event featured 25 different pieces of voting equipment used in federal, state and local U.S. elections and made them available to white-hat hackers and IT researchers for the purpose of education, experimentation, and to demonstrate the cyber vulnerabilities of such equipment.  During the 3-day event, thousands of hackers, media and elected officials witnessed the hacking of every piece of equipment, with the first machine to be compromised in under 90 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/hackers-breach-usvoting-machines-90-minutes-def-con-competition-643858|title=Hackers competed to breach U.S. voting machines. It took them 90 minutes.|date=2017-07-30|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One voting machine was hacked remotely and was configured to play [[Rick Astley|Rick Astley']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s song "[[Never Gonna Give You Up]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/16/entertainment/rick-astley/index.html|title=Rick Astley is on a (Rick) roll|last=CNN|first=Lisa Respers France,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional findings of the Voting Village were published in a report issued by DEFCON in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/DEF%20CON%2025%20voting%20village%20report.pdf|title=DEFCON 25 Voting Machine Hacking Village: Report on Cyber Vulnerabilities in U.S. Election Equipment, Databases, and Infrastructure. October 2017.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Voting Village" was brought back for a second year at DEF CON, which was held in Las Vegas, August 9-12, 2018. The 2018 event dramatically expanded its inquiries to include more of the election environment, from voter registration records to election night reporting and many more of the humans and machines in the middle. DEF CON 2018 also featured a greater variety of voting machines, election officials, equipment, election system processes, and election night reporting. Voting Village participants consisted of hackers, IT and security professionals, journalists, lawyers, academics, and local, state and federal government leaders.  A full report was issued on the 2018 Village Findings at a press conference in Washington, DC, held on September 27, 2018.[https://defcon.org/images/defcon-26/DEF%20CON%2026%20voting%20village%20report.pdf]


== Legislation and policy ==

A variety of experts and interest groups have emerged to address U.S. voting infrastructure vulnerabilities and to support state and local elections officials in their security efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/10/technology/defcon-hackers-voting-machine-coalition/index.html|title=Hackers will work with government, academia to make future elections secure|last=Larson|first=Selena|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these efforts have come a general set of policy ideas for election security, including:
* Implement universal use of paper ballots, marked by hand and read by optical scanner, ensuring a voter-verified paper audit trail ([[Voter-verified paper audit trail|VVPAT]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/state-and-local-election-cybersecurity-playbook|title=Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School, Defending Digital Democracy, The State &amp; Local Election Cybersecurity Playbook, February 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/election-security-state-policies.aspx|title=Election Security: State Policies|last=Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|website=www.ncsl.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Verified Voting"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.verifiedvoting.org/voting-system-principles/|title=Verified Voting Foundation: Principles for New Voting Systems|date=2015-02-04|work=Verified Voting|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Phase out touch-screen voting machines – especially the most vulnerable [[DRE voting machine|direct-recording electronic (DRE) devices]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/os-ahalderman-062117.pdf|title=Expert Testimony by J.

* Update pollbooks and other electronic equipment used to check-in voters.&lt;ref name="Center for American Progress"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/democracy/reports/2017/08/16/437390/9-solutions-secure-americas-elections/|title=9 Solutions to Secure America’s Elections - Center for American Progress|work=Center for American Progress|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Verify voting results by requiring election officials to conduct [[risk-limiting audits]], a statistical post-election audit before certification of final results.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Verified Voting"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Center for American Progress"/&gt;
* Secure voting infrastructure, especially voter registration databases, using cyber hygiene tools such as the CIS “20 Critical Security Controls” or [[NIST Cybersecurity Framework|NIST’s Cybersecurity Framework]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cisecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CIS-Elections-eBook-15-Feb.pdf|title=Center for Internet Security (CIS), A Handbook for Elections Infrastructure Security, Version 1.0, February 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Call upon outside experts to conduct cyber assessments – DHS, white-hat hackers, cybersecurity vendors and security researchers – where needed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-25/Election%20Security%20White%20Paper_Praetz_12062017.pdf|title=Praetz, Noah, Office of Cook County, IL Clerk David Orr, 2020 Vision: Election Security in the Age of Committed Foreign Threats, December 7, 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Provide resources and training to state and local election leaders for cyber maintenance and on-going monitoring.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Promote information-sharing on cyber threats and incidents in and across the entire voting industry.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://democrats-homeland.house.gov/sites/democrats.homeland.house.gov/files/documents/TFESReport.pdf|title=CONGRESSIONAL TASK FORCE ON ELECTION SECURITY, Final Report, January 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Appropriate federal funding to states to implement infrastructure upgrades, audits, and cyber hygiene measures.
* Establish clear channels for coordination between local, state, and federal agencies, including real-time sharing of threat and intelligence information.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Maintain DHS's designation of elections as a Critical Infrastructure Subsector.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Require DHS to institute a pre-election threat assessment plan to bolster its technical support capacity to state and locals requesting assistance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
Federal legislation has also been introduced to address these concerns. The first bipartisan Congressional legislation to protect the administration of Federal elections against cybersecurity threats – the Secure Elections Act (SB 2261) – was introduced on December 21, 2017 by Senator [[James Lankford]] (R-OK).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/365986-bipartisan-group-of-lawmakers-introduces-new-election-security-bill|title=Bipartisan group of lawmakers backs new election security bill|last=Chalfant|first=Morgan|date=2017-12-21|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernst Joseph Maria Lert''', originally '''Ernst Joseph Maria Levy''' (1883, [[Vienna]] – 1955, New York City) was an Austrian stage director, writer, composer, [[librettist]], and [[music historian]]. He was the brother of conductor [[Richard Lert]] who was married to writer [[Vicki Baum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,882056,00.html Music: Buckeye Opera], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', August 10, 1931&lt;/ref&gt;

Lert studied music history, piano, and singing at the [[University of Vienna]]. In 1909 he was appointed the "[[Theatre director|regisseur]]" of the [[opera house]] in [[Breslau]] where he remained for three years. In 1912 he became the director of the [[Oper Leipzig]] where he remained for seven years. In 1919 he took the position of theatre director at the [[Theater Basel]], but left there a year later to become theatre director at the [[Opern- und Schauspielhaus Frankfurt]]. In 1924 he joined the directing staff at [[La Scala]], leaving there in 1929 to become a theatre director at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City. He remained at the Met for two seasons.&lt;ref name="dic"&gt;Dictionary of Music", by A. Della Corte and GMGatti, Loescher, 1956, pag.343&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his remaining career working as a freelance director with major theatres and opera houses internationally. He notably directed the world premiere of [[Gian Carlo Menotti]]'s ''[[Amelia Goes to the Ball]]'' which was presented on April 1, 1937 at the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia Academy of Music]].

As a music scholar, Lert published several biographies on notable musical figures and wrote the book ''Mozart auf dem Theater'' (''Mozart and the Theatre'', published 1918). He also contributed articles to numerous magazines, music journals, and newspapers.&lt;ref name="dic"/&gt; He wrote the libretto for [[Hugo Weisgall]]'s ''[[The Tenor]]'' (1952) and wrote the German libretto for [[Riccardo Zandonai]]'s ''Die Kavaliere von Ekeby'' (''[[I cavalieri di Ekebù]]'').

'''Euskal Herritarrok''' ({{lang-en|Basque Citizens}}, EH) was a [[Basque nationalism|Basque independentist]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] [[political party]] in the [[Euskal Herria|Basque Country]]. EH was banned in 2003 on the grounds that it sympathized with [[Euskadi Ta Askatasuna|ETA]].

==History==
In February 2000, [[Batzarre]] and Zutik left EH after the rupture of the [[Euskadi Ta Askatasuna|ETA]] 1998-2000 truce, due to the absence of any condemnation of that fact by EH. In June 2000 a sector of Herri Batasuna also decided to split and form the [[Aralar Party]], that openly and fully rejected [[Euskadi Ta Askatasuna|ETA]] and its rupture of the truce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elpais.com/diario/2001/10/07/paisvasco/1002483611_850215.html Las 'tres caras' de la izquierda 'abertzale' en Navarra.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Federico Martínez Roda''' is a professor of history at the [[Valencia Catholic University Saint Vincent Martyr|Valencia Catholic University]].

Federico Martínez ([[Requena, Valencia|Requena]] 1950) studied philosophy and literature and law at the [[University of Valencia]], where he received his PhD in history in 1979 for extensive and innovative research on the [[Port of Valencia]]. He furthered his studies in Brussels and Geneva.

His research began in 1973 with his thesis about Valencian illustration. Since then, he has focused in five lines of research: Valencia, historical methodology, globalization, international relations, and military issues.

Martínez began his teaching career as secondary school teacher, becoming a high school headmaster in Mislata and Utiel (1975–1983). He later served as C.A.P. coordinator in geography and history for the University of Valencia, secretary general of the [[Universidad CEU Cardenal Herrera]] from 2001 to 2008, and vice chancellor of the [[CEU San Pablo University]] from 2011 to 2013.

He joined Valencia Catholic University in September 2014 and is currently a professor at the university.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.levante-emv.com/comunitat-valenciana/2014/09/23/catolica-ficha-martinez-roda-puntal/1165013.html&lt;/ref&gt; As a university professor, he has been invited to the universities of Kraków, Wroclaw, Lima, King's Point (New York), Managua, St. Pölten, Wisconsin, and Nova de Lisboa.

Martínez has been the editor of ''Annals'', the scientific magazine published by the [[Real Academia de Cultura Valenciana]], since 2008.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In 2015, he was awarded the XVII Ángel Herrera Prize in recognition for his work.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The '''General Atomics MQ-1 Predator''' is an American [[remotely piloted aircraft]] (RPA) built by [[General Atomics]] that was used primarily by the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) and [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). Initially conceived in the early 1990s for [[aerial reconnaissance]] and forward observation roles, the Predator carries cameras and other sensors. It was modified and upgraded to carry and fire two [[AGM-114 Hellfire]] [[missile]]s or other munitions. The aircraft entered service in 1995, and saw combat in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2014)|war in Afghanistan]], [[War in North-West Pakistan|Pakistan]], the [[NATO intervention in Bosnia]], [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|Serbia]], the [[Iraq War]], [[Yemen]], the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], the [[2014 US-Coalition intervention in Syria|2014 intervention in Syria]], and [[Somalia]].

The USAF describes the Predator as a "Tier II" MALE UAS (medium-altitude, long-endurance unmanned aircraft system). The UAS consists of four aircraft or "air vehicles" with sensors, a [[ground control station]] (GCS), and a primary satellite link communication suite.&lt;ref name="USAF Tier system scheme"/&gt; Powered by a [[Rotax]] engine and driven by a propeller, the air vehicle can fly up to {{convert|400|nmi|mi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} to a target, loiter overhead for 14&amp;nbsp;hours, then return to its base.

Since after 2001, the RQ-1 Predator became the primary remotely piloted aircraft used for offensive operations by the USAF and the CIA in Afghanistan and the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas|Pakistani tribal areas]]; it has also been deployed elsewhere. Because offensive uses of the Predator are [[Classified information in the United States|classified by the U.S.]], U.S. military officials have reported an appreciation for the intelligence and reconnaissance-gathering abilities of RPAs but declined to publicly discuss their offensive use.&lt;ref name="Drone aircraft in a stepped-up war in Afghanistan and Pakistan"/&gt; The United States Air Force retired the Predator in 2018.&lt;ref name="ain13march18"/&gt;

Civilian applications for drones have included border enforcement and scientific studies, and to monitor wind direction and other characteristics of large forest fires (such as the drone that was used by the [[California Air National Guard]] in the August 2013 [[Rim Fire]]).&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt;

==Development==
[[File:MQ-1 Predator P1230014.jpg|thumb|At [[Paris Air Show]] 2007]]
[[File:RQ-1 Predator.jpg|thumb|A Predator flies on a simulated Navy aerial reconnaissance flight off the coast of southern California on 5 December 1995.]]

The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) and [[the Pentagon]] began experimenting with unmanned [[reconnaissance aircraft]] (drones) in the early 1980s. The CIA preferred small, lightweight, unobtrusive drones, in contrast to the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF). In the early 1990s, the CIA became interested in the "[[History of unmanned aerial vehicles#Amber|Amber]]", a drone developed by Leading Systems, Inc.&lt;ref name="spyflight.co.uk"/&gt; The company's owner, [[Abraham Karem]], was the former chief designer for the [[Israeli Air Force]], and had immigrated to the U.S. in the late 1970s. Karem's company had since gone bankrupt and been bought up by a U.S. defense contractor, from whom the CIA secretly bought five drones (now called the "[[General Atomics GNAT|GNAT]]"). Karem agreed to produce a quiet engine for the vehicle, which had until then sounded like "a lawnmower in the sky". The new development became known as the "Predator".&lt;ref name="penguin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indispensable"/&gt;

[[General Atomics Aeronautical Systems]] (GA) was awarded a contract to develop the Predator in January 1994, and the initial Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) phase lasted from January 1994 to June 1996. First flight took place on 3 July 1994 at the [[El Mirage Field|El Mirage airfield]] in the [[Mojave Desert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whittle|first1=Richard|title=Predator : The Secret Origins of the Drone Revolution|date=2014|publisher=Henry Holt and Co|location=New York|isbn=978-0805099645|pages=85, 86|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft itself was a derivative of the [[General Atomics GNAT|GA Gnat 750]]. During the ACTD phase, three systems were purchased from GA, comprising twelve aircraft and three ground control stations.&lt;ref name="FOS" /&gt;

From April through May 1995, the Predator ACTD aircraft were flown as a part of the Roving Sands 1995 exercises in the U.S. The exercise operations were successful, and this led to the decision to deploy the system to the Balkans later in the summer of 1995.&lt;ref name="FOS" /&gt;

During the ACTD, Predators were operated by a combined Army/Navy team managed by the Navy's Joint Program Office for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (JPO-UAV) and first deployed to Gjader, Albania, for operations in the Former Yugoslavia in spring 1995.&lt;ref name="FOS" /&gt;

By the start of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|United States Afghan campaign in 2001]], the USAF had acquired 60 Predators, and said it had lost 20 of them in action.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Few if any of the losses were from enemy action, the worst problem apparently being foul weather, particularly icy conditions. Some critics within the Pentagon saw the high loss rate as a sign of poor operational procedures. In response to the losses caused by cold weather conditions, a few of the later USAF Predators were fitted with [[Deicing|de-icing]] systems, along with an uprated turbocharged engine and improved avionics. This improved "Block 1" version was referred to as the "RQ-1B", or the "MQ-1B" if it carried munitions; the corresponding [[1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system|air vehicle designation]] was "RQ-1L" or "MQ-1L".

The Predator system was initially designated the '''RQ-1 Predator'''. The "R" is the [[United States Department of Defense]] designation for reconnaissance and the "Q" refers to an unmanned aircraft system.&lt;ref name="A Short Primer on Military Aircraft Designations"/&gt; The "1" describes it as being the first of a series of aircraft systems built for unmanned reconnaissance. Pre-production systems were designated as RQ-1A, while the RQ-1B (not to be confused with the Predator B, which became the [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper|MQ-9 Reaper]]) denotes the baseline production configuration. These are designations of the ''system'' as a unit. The actual aircraft themselves were designated RQ-1K for pre-production models, and RQ-1L for production models.&lt;ref name="vector"/&gt; In 2002, the USAF officially changed the designation to MQ-1 ("M" for multi-role) to reflect its growing use as an armed aircraft.&lt;ref name="FS1"/&gt;

===Command and sensor systems===
During campaign in the former Yugoslavia, a Predator's pilot would sit with several payload specialists in a van near the runway of the drone's operating base. Direct radio signals controlled the drone's takeoff and initial ascent. Then communications shifted to military satellite networks linked to the pilot's van. Pilots experienced a delay of several seconds between moving their [[Joystick|stick]]s and the drone's response. But by 2000, improvements in communications systems made it possible, at least in theory, to fly the drone remotely from great distances. It was no longer necessary to use close-up radio signals during the Predator's takeoff and ascent. The entire flight could be controlled by satellite from any [[command and control]] center with the right equipment. The CIA proposed to attempt over Afghanistan the first fully remote Predator flight operations, piloted from the agency's headquarters at [[Langley, Virginia|Langley]].&lt;ref name="penguin1"/&gt;

The Predator air vehicle and sensors are controlled from the ground station via a [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] data link or a [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;-band]] satellite data link for beyond-line-of-sight operations. During flight operations the crew in the ground control station is a pilot and two sensor operators. The aircraft is equipped with the AN/AAS-52 [[Multi-spectral]] Targeting System, a color nose camera (generally used by the pilot for flight control), a variable aperture day-TV camera, and a variable aperture [[thermographic camera]] (for low light/night). Previously, Predators were equipped with a [[synthetic aperture radar]] for looking through smoke, clouds or haze, but lack of use validated its removal to reduce weight and conserve fuel. The cameras produce full motion video and the synthetic aperture radar produced still frame [[radar imaging|radar images]]. There is sufficient bandwidth on the datalink for two video sources to be used at one time, but only one video source from the sensor ball can be used at any time due to design limitations. Either the daylight variable aperture or the infrared electro-optical sensor may be operated simultaneously with the synthetic aperture radar, if equipped.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

All later Predators are equipped with a [[laser designator]] that allows the pilot to identify targets for other aircraft and even provide the [[laser guidance]] for manned aircraft. This laser is also the designator for the [[AGM-114 Hellfire]] that are carried on the MQ-1.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Deployment methodology===
[[File:MQ-1 Predator controls 2007-08-07.jpg|thumb|Predator operators at Balad Camp Anaconda, Iraq, August 2007]]

Each Predator air vehicle can be disassembled into six main components and loaded into a container nicknamed "the coffin." This enables all system components and support equipment to be rapidly deployed worldwide. The largest component is the ground control station and it is designed to roll into a [[C-130 Hercules]]. The Predator primary satellite link consists of a 6.1-meter (20-ft) satellite dish and associated support equipment. The satellite link provides communications between the ground station and the aircraft when it is beyond line-of-sight and is a link to networks that disseminate secondary intelligence. The RQ-1A system needs 1,500 by 40&amp;nbsp;meters (5,000 by 125&amp;nbsp;ft) of hard surface runway with clear line-of-sight to each end from the ground control station to the air vehicles. Initially, all components needed to be located on the same airfield.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Currently, the U.S. Air Force uses a concept called "Remote-Split Operations" where the satellite datalink is located in a different location and is connected to the GCS through fiber optic cabling. This allows Predators to be launched and recovered by a small "Launch and Recovery Element" and then handed off to a "Mission Control Element" for the rest of the flight. This allows a smaller number of troops to be deployed to a forward location, and consolidates control of the different flights in one location.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The improvements in the MQ-1B production version include an ARC-210 radio, an APX-100 IFF/SIF with mode 4, a glycol-weeping "wet wings" ice mitigation system, upgraded turbo-charged engine, fuel injection, longer wings, dual alternators as well as other improvements.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

On 18 May 2006, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) issued a certificate of authorization which will allow the M/RQ-1 and [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper|M/RQ-9]] aircraft to be used within U.S. civilian airspace to search for survivors of disasters. Requests had been made in 2005 for the aircraft to be used in [[search and rescue]] operations following [[Hurricane Katrina]], but because there was no FAA authorization in place at the time, the assets were not used. The Predator's [[Thermographic camera|infrared camera]] with digitally enhanced zoom has the capability of identifying the [[infrared signature]] of a human body from an altitude of 3&amp;nbsp;km (10,000&amp;nbsp;ft), making the aircraft an ideal search and rescue tool.&lt;ref name="www2006"/&gt;

The longest declassified Predator flight to date lasted for 40&amp;nbsp;hours, 5&amp;nbsp;minutes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The total flight time reached 1 million hours in April 2010, according to General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc.&lt;ref name="Predator-series UAVs surpass one million flight hours"/&gt;

===Armed versions===
[[File:AGM-114 Hellfire hung on a Predator drone.JPEG|thumb|Close-up of the [[AGM-114 Hellfire|Hellfire]] missile pylon, 2004.]]

The USAF [[Big Safari|BIG SAFARI program office]] managed the Predator program and was given direction on 21 June 2000 to explore options to arm the aircraft. This led to it being fitted with reinforced wings and stores pylons to carry munitions, as well as a [[laser designator]]. The RQ-1 conducted its first firing of a [[AGM-114 Hellfire|Hellfire]] [[anti-tank missile]] on 16 February 2001; over a bombing range near [[Creech Air Force Base|Indian Springs Air Force Station]] north of [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], an inert AGM-114C successfully hit a tank target. This led to a series of tests on 21 February 2001 in which the Predator fired three Hellfire missiles, scoring hits on a stationary tank with all three missiles. Following the February tests, the decision was made to move immediately to increment two of the testing phase, which involved more complex tests to hunt for simulated moving targets from greater altitudes with the more advanced AGM-114K version. The scheme was put into service, with the armed Predators given the new designation of MQ-1A. The Predator gives little warning of attack; it is relatively quiet and the Hellfire is supersonic, so it strikes before it is heard by the target.&lt;ref name="vector"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Predator missile launch test totally successful"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/the-q-1-predator-became-a-history-changing-deadly-missi-1760408544 The Q-1 Predator Became A History-Changing Deadly Missile Slinger 15 Years Ago Today] - Foxtrotalpha.Japolnik.com, 21 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In the winter of 2000–2001, after seeing the results of Predator reconnaissance in Afghanistan (see below), [[Cofer Black]], head of the CIA's [[Counterterrorist Center]] (CTC), became a "vocal advocate" of arming the Predator with missiles to target [[Osama bin Laden]] in the country. He also believed that CIA pressure and practical interest was causing the USAF's armed Predator program to be significantly accelerated. Black, and "Richard", who was in charge of the CTC's [[Bin Laden Issue Station]], continued to press during 2001 for a Predator armed with Hellfire missiles.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Further weapons tests occurred between 22 May and 7 June 2001, with mixed results. While missile accuracy was excellent, there were some problems with missile fuzing..." In the first week of June, in the Nevada Desert, a Hellfire missile was successfully launched on a replica of bin Laden's Afghanistan [[Tarnak Farms|Tarnak]] residence. A missile launched from a Predator exploded inside one of the replica's rooms; it was concluded that any people in the room would have been killed. However, the armed Predator did not go into action before the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name="penguin2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The CIA and the Predator Drone (2000–1)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="9-11commission15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost2002"/&gt;

The USAF has also investigated using the Predator to drop battlefield ground sensors and to carry and deploy the [[Miniature UAVs#NRL "Dragon Eye", "Swallow" and "Finder"|"Finder"]] [[Miniature UAV|mini-UAV]].&lt;ref name="vector"/&gt;

===Later development and future===
Two unarmed versions, known as the [[General Atomics ALTUS]] were built, ALTUS I for the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] and ALTUS II for the [[NASA]] [[ERAST Project]] in 1997 and 1996, respectively.&lt;ref name="NASA Dryden Fact Sheet – ALTUS II"/&gt;

Based on the MQ-1 Predator, the [[General Atomics MQ-1C Gray Eagle]] was developed for the U.S. Army.

The USAF ordered a total of 259 Predators, and due to retirements and crashes the number in Air Force operation was reduced to 154 as of May 2014.  Budget proposals planned to retire the Predator fleet between FY 2015 and 2017 in favor of the larger [[MQ-9 Reaper]], which has greater payload and range.  The Predators would likely be stored at [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]] or be given to other organizations willing to take them.  The [[Customs and Border Patrol]] has shown interest, but already operate higher-performance Reapers and are having difficulty with operating costs.  The [[U.S. Coast Guard]] has also shown interest in land-based UAV surveillance.  Foreign sales are also an option, but the MQ-1 may be subject to limitations of the [[Missile Technology Control Regime]] because it can be armed; export markets are also limited by the Reaper as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140513/DEFREG/305120020/Ready-for-Retirement-Can-Predator-Find-New-Home Ready for Retirement, Can Predator Find New Home?] - Defensenews.com, 13 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Given the Predator's phasing out and low size, weight, and power availability, the Air Force decided not to look into upgrades to make it more effective in contested environments and found its only use in defended airspace would be to be shot down while drawing fire away from other aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militarytimes.com/story/defense/air-space/isr/2015/08/04/smarter-deadlier-drone-upgrades-uav-predator-reaper-global-hawk/31125619/ Smarter, Deadlier UAV: USAF Looks at Upgrades] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904034214/http://www.militarytimes.com/story/defense/air-space/isr/2015/08/04/smarter-deadlier-drone-upgrades-uav-predator-reaper-global-hawk/31125619/ |date=4 September 2015 }} - Militarytimes.com, 5 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Due to needed airborne surveillance after the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) [[Northern Iraq offensive (June 2014)|invaded Iraq]], the Predator's retirement was pushed to 2018.  MQ-1s will probably be placed in non-recoverable storage at the Boneyard and not sold to allies, although antenna, ground control stations, and other components may be salvaged for continued use on other airframes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/usaf-plans-to-end-mq-1-predator-operations-in-2018-415742/ USAF plans to end MQ-1 Predator operations in 2018] - Flightglobal.com, 14 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The Predator was retired from USAF service in March 2018.&lt;ref name="ain13march18"/&gt;

General Atomics completed manufacturing on the final RQ-1 ordered by Italy by October 2015, marking the end of Predator A production after two decades.  The last Predator for the USAF was completed in 2011; later Predator aircraft were built on the Predator XP assembly line.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/italian-delivery-marks-end-of-general-atomics-rq-1-p-420338/ Italian delivery marks end of General Atomics RQ-1 production] - Flightglobal.com, 23 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Air Force]] officially announced plans to retire the MQ-1 on 9 March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2018/02/16/air-force-announces-official-retirement-date-for-iconic-mq-1-predator/|title=Air Force announces official retirement date for iconic MQ-1 Predator drone|last=Losey|first=Stephen|date=2018-02-20|work=Air Force Times|access-date=2018-03-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==
[[File:General Atomics RQ-1A Predator USAF.jpg|thumb|RQ-1A Predator]]

As of March 2009, the U.S. Air Force had 195 MQ-1 Predators and 28 MQ-9 Reapers in operation.&lt;ref name="choice"/&gt; Predators and Reapers fired missiles 244 times in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] in 2007 and 2008. A report in March 2009 indicated that U.S. Air Force had lost 70 Predators in air crashes during its operational history. Fifty-five were lost to equipment failure, operator error, or weather. Five were shot down in [[NATO intervention in Bosnia|Bosnia]], [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|Kosovo]], Syria and Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.airforcetimes.com/story/military/pentagon/2015/06/29/air-force-lost-predator-was-shot-down-in-syria/29474659/|title=Air Force: Lost Predator was shot down in Syria|first=Brian|last=Everstine|date=7 August 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven more were lost to operational accidents on combat missions.&lt;ref name="NYTimes2009-03-17"/&gt; In 2012, the Predator, Reaper and [[Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk|Global Hawk]] were described as "... the most accident-prone aircraft in the Air Force fleet."&lt;ref name="bloomberg"/&gt;

On 3 March 2011, the U.S. Air Force took delivery of its last MQ-1 Predator in a ceremony at General Atomics' flight operations facility. Since its first flight in July 1994, the MQ-1 series accumulated over 1,000,000 flight hours&lt;ref name=FS1/&gt; and maintained a fleet fully mission capable rate over 90 percent.&lt;ref name="General Atomics Press Release"/&gt;

On 22 October 2013, the U.S. Air Force's fleets of MQ-1 Predators and [[MQ-9 Reaper]] remotely piloted aircraft reached 2,000,000 flight hours. The RPA program began in the mid-1990s, taking 16 years for them to reach 1 million flight hours. The 2 million hour mark was reached just two and a half years after that.&lt;ref name="suasnews"/&gt;

On 9 March 2018, the U.S. Air Force officially retired the MQ-1 Predator from operational service. The aircraft was first operationally deployed in 1995 and in 2011 the last of 268 Predators were delivered to the service, of which just over 100 were still in service by the start of 2018. While the Predator was phased out by the Air Force in favor of the heavier and more capable MQ-9 Reaper, the Predator continues to serve in the [[MQ-1C Gray Eagle]] derivative for the U.S. Army as well as with several foreign nations.&lt;ref name="ain13march18"/&gt;

===Squadrons and operational units===
During the initial ACTD phase, the [[United States Army]] led the evaluation program, but in April 1996, the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] selected the U.S. Air Force as the operating service for the RQ-1A Predator system. The [[3d Special Operations Squadron]] at [[Cannon Air Force Base]], [[11th Reconnaissance Squadron|11th]], [[15th Reconnaissance Squadron|15th]], [[17th Reconnaissance Squadron|17th]], and [[18th Reconnaissance Squadron]]s, [[Creech Air Force Base#Indian Springs history|Creech Air Force Base]], Nevada, and the [[Air National Guard]]'s [[163d Reconnaissance Wing]]&lt;ref name=rf163/&gt; at [[March Air Reserve Base]], California, currently operate the MQ-1.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In 2005, the U.S. Department of Defense recommended retiring [[Ellington Airport (Texas)|Ellington Field]]'s [[147th Reconnaissance Wing|147th Fighter Wing]]'s [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]] fighter jets (a total of 15 aircraft), which was approved by the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] committee. They will be replaced with 12 MQ-1 Predator UAVs, and the new unit should be fully equipped and outfitted by 2009.&lt;ref name="Guard unit welcomes Predator, reconnaissance mission"/&gt; The wing's combat support arm will remain intact. The 272d Engineering Installation Squadron, an Air National Guard unit currently located off-base, will move into Ellington Field in its place.

The 3d Special Operations Squadron is currently the largest Predator squadron in the [[United States Air Force]].&lt;ref name="Factsheets : 3rd Special Operations Squadron"/&gt;

[[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] was reported in 2013 to be operating 10 Predators and to have requested 14 more.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Now – Southern California"/&gt;

On 21 June 2009, the United States Air Force announced that it was creating a new MQ-1 squadron at Whiteman Air Force Base that would become operational by February 2011.&lt;ref name="Officials choose bases for MQ-1, MQ-9 ground control stations"/&gt; In September 2011, the U.S. [[Air National Guard]] announced that despite current plans for budget cuts, they will continue to operate the Air Force's combat UAVs, including MQ-1B.&lt;ref name="AirForceWorld_MQ-1B_Air_Guard"/&gt;

On 28 August 2013, a Predator belonging to the [[163d Reconnaissance Wing]] was flying at 18,000 to 20,000&amp;nbsp;feet over the [[Rim Fire]] in California providing infrared video of lurking fires, after receiving emergency approvals. Rules limit the Predator behavior; it must be accompanied by a manned aircraft, and its camera must only be active above the fire.&lt;ref name="rf163"/&gt;&lt;ref name="verticalmag"/&gt;

In September 2013, the [[Air Force Special Operations Command]] tested the ability to rapidly deploy Predator aircraft. Two MQ-1s were loaded into a [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III]] in a cradle system that also carried a control terminal, maintenance tent, and the crew. The test was to prove the UAVs could be deployed and set up at an expeditionary base within four hours of landing. In a recent undisclosed deployment, airmen set up a portable hangar in a tent and a wooden taxiway to operate MQ-1s for a six-week period.&lt;ref name="militarytimes"/&gt;

===In the Balkans===
[[File:Predator MQ-1 (war trophy in Museum of Aviation, Belgrade, Serbia).jpg|thumb|A shot down RQ-1 Predator in the [[Museum of Aviation (Belgrade)|Museum of Aviation]] in Belgrade, [[Serbia]]]]

The first overseas deployment took place in the [[Balkans]], from July to November 1995, under the name ''Nomad Vigil''. Operations were based in [[Gjader Air Base|Gjader]], Albania. Four disassembled Predators were flown into Gjadër airbase in a [[C-130 Hercules]]. The UAVs were assembled and flown first by civilian contract personnel. More than 70 U.S. military personnel of the military intelligence were deployed. Intelligence collection missions began in July 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/nomad|title=vigil.htm Operation Nomad Vigil – Nomad Endeavor, GlobalSecurity.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the Predators was lost over Bosnia on 11 August 1995; a second was deliberately destroyed on 14 August after suffering an engine failure over Bosnia, which may have been caused by hostile ground fire.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Polmar, ''The Naval Institute guide to the ships and aircraft of the U.S. fleet'' (2005) p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt; Its original 60-day stay was extended to 120 days. The following spring, in March 1996, the system was redeployed to the Balkan area and operated out of [[Taszar]], Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Houston R. Cantwell, ''RADM Thomas J. Cassidy’s MQ-1 Predator: the USAF’s first UAV success story'', Air Command and Staff College Air University (Apr 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Several others were destroyed in the course of [[Operation Noble Anvil]], the 1999 NATO bombing of [[Yugoslavia]]:
* One aircraft (serial 95-3017) was lost on 18 April 1999, following fuel system problems and icing.&lt;ref name="AFPN report"/&gt;
* A second aircraft (serial 95-3019) was lost on 13 May, when it was shot down by a Serbian [[SA-9 Gaskin|Strela-1M]] [[surface-to-air missile]] over the village of Biba. A Serbian TV crew videotaped this incident.&lt;ref name="loss"/&gt;
* A third aircraft (serial number 95-3021) crashed on 20 May near the town of Talinovci, and Serbian news reported that this, too, was the result of anti-aircraft fire.&lt;ref name="loss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aeronautics"/&gt;

===Afghanistan===
In 2000, a joint CIA-DoD effort was agreed to locate [[Osama bin Laden]] in Afghanistan. Dubbed "Afghan Eyes", it involved a projected 60-day trial run of Predators over the country. The first experimental flight was held on 7 September 2000. White House security chief [[Richard A. Clarke]] was impressed by the resulting video footage; he hoped that the drones might eventually be used to target Bin Laden with cruise missiles or armed aircraft. Clarke's enthusiasm was matched by that of [[Cofer Black]], head of the CIA's Counterterrorist Center (CTC), and [[Charles E. Allen|Charles Allen]], in charge of the CIA's intelligence-collection operations. The three men backed an immediate trial run of reconnaissance flights. Ten out of the ensuing 15 Predator missions over Afghanistan were rated successful. On at least two flights, a Predator spotted a tall man in white robes at bin Laden's [[Tarnak Farm]] compound outside [[Kandahar]]; the figure was subsequently deemed to be "probably bin Laden".&lt;ref name="9-11commission189"/&gt; By October 2000, deteriorating weather conditions made it difficult for the Predator to fly from its base in [[Uzbekistan]], and the flights were suspended.&lt;ref name="penguin3"/&gt;

[[File:Predator and Hellfire.jpg|thumb|Predator launching a Hellfire missile]]

On 16 February 2001 at [[Nellis Air Force Base]], a Predator successfully fired three Hellfire [[AGM-114 Hellfire|AGM-114C]] missiles into a target. The newly armed Predators were given the designation of MQ-1A. In the first week of June 2001, a Hellfire missile was successfully launched on a replica of bin Laden's Afghanistan [[Tarnak Farms|Tarnak]] residence built at a Nevada testing site. A missile launched from a Predator exploded inside one of the replica's rooms; it was concluded that any people in the room would have been killed. On 4 September 2001 (after the Bush cabinet approved a Qaeda/Taliban plan), CIA chief Tenet ordered the agency to resume reconnaissance flights. The Predators were now weapons-capable, but didn't carry missiles because the host country (presumably Uzbekistan) hadn't granted permission.

Subsequent to 9/11, approval was quickly granted to ship the missiles, and the Predator aircraft and missiles reached their overseas location on 16 September 2001. The first mission was flown over [[Kabul]] and [[Kandahar]] on 18 September without carrying weapons. Subsequent host nation approval was granted on 7 October and the first armed mission was flown on the same day.&lt;ref name="9-11commission213"/&gt;
* In February 2002, armed Predators are thought to have been used to destroy a [[sport utility vehicle]] belonging to suspected Taliban leader Mullah [[Mohammed Omar]] and mistakenly killed Afghan scrap metal collectors near [[Zhawar Kili]] because one of them resembled [[Osama bin Laden]].&lt;ref name="entrepreneurship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="technology"/&gt;
* On 4 March 2002, a CIA-operated Predator fired a Hellfire missile into a reinforced Taliban machine gun bunker that had pinned down an [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|Army Ranger]] team whose [[CH-47 Chinook]] had crashed on the top of [[Takur Ghar]] Mountain in Afghanistan. Previous attempts by flights of [[F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15]] and [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]] aircraft were unable to destroy the bunker. This action took place during what has become known as the "[[Battle of Takur Ghar|Battle of Roberts Ridge]]", a part of [[Operation Anaconda]]. This appears to be the first use of such a weapon in a [[close air support]] role.&lt;ref name="discovery2007"/&gt;
* On 6 April 2011, the Predator had its first friendly fire incident when observers at a remote location did not relay their doubts about the target to the operators at [[Creech Air Force Base]].&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

On 5 May 2013, an MQ-1 Predator surpassed 20,000 flight hours over Afghanistan by a single Predator. Predator P107 achieved the milestone while flying a 21-hour combat mission; P107 was first delivered in October 2004.&lt;ref name="wwwmil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="janes"/&gt;

===Pakistan===
{{Main article|Drone attacks in Pakistan by the United States}}

Since at least 2004, the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] has allegedly been operating the drones out of [[Shamsi airfield]] in Pakistan to attack militants in Pakistan's [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]].&lt;ref name="Google Earth Reveals Secret History of US Base in Pakistan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="About those missing Predator drones: It wasn't censorship after all"/&gt;

Since May 2003, the MQ-1 Predator fitted with [[Hellfire missile]]s has been successfully used to kill a number of prominent [[Al-Qaeda|al Qaeda]] operatives.&lt;ref name="abc1"/&gt; The use of the Predator has also resulted in a number of civilian deaths, particularly on 13 January 2006 when 18 civilians were killed. According to Pakistani authorities, the U.S. strike was based on faulty intelligence, and the Pakistan government did not allow U.S. Agency to strike within Pakistan territory.&lt;ref name="USAToday article"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The New Al-Qaeda Central: Far From Declining, the Network Has Rebuilt, With Fresh Faces and a Vigorous Media Arm"/&gt;

===Iraq===
[[File:MQ-1B Predator unmanned aircraft.jpg|thumb|An MQ-1B Predator from the 361st Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron takes off 9 July 2008 from [[Ali Air Base|Ali Base]], Iraq.]]

An Iraqi [[MiG-25]] shot down a Predator performing reconnaissance over the [[no fly zone]] in Iraq on 23 December 2002. This was the first time in history a conventional aircraft and a drone had engaged each other in combat. Predators had been armed with [[AIM-92 Stinger]] air-to-air missiles, and were being used to "bait" Iraqi fighters, then run. In this incident, the Predator did not run, but instead fired one of its Stingers. The Stinger's heat-seeker became "distracted" by the MiG's missile and missed the MiG. The Predator was hit by the MiG's missile and destroyed.&lt;ref name="cbs2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="atwar1999"/&gt; Another two Predators had been shot down earlier by Iraqi [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]]s.&lt;ref name="institute"/&gt;

During the initial phases of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq]], a number of older Predators were stripped down and used as decoys to entice Iraqi air defenses to expose themselves by firing.&lt;ref name="vector"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs2"/&gt; From July 2005 to June 2006, the [[15th Reconnaissance Squadron]] participated in more than 242 separate raids, engaged 132 troops in contact-force protection actions, fired 59 Hellfire missiles; surveyed 18,490 targets, escorted four convoys, and flew 2,073 sorties for more than 33,833 flying hours.&lt;ref name="www20064"/&gt;

[[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgents]] intercepted video feeds, which were not encrypted, using a $26 piece of Russian software named [[SkyGrabber]].&lt;ref name="Insurgents Hack U.S. Drones - WSJ.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iraq rebels 'hack into US drones'"/&gt; The encryption for the [[ROVER]] feeds was removed for performance reasons.&lt;ref name="Iraqi insurgents hacked Predator drone feeds, U.S. official indicates"/&gt; Work to secure the data feeds is to be completed by 2014.&lt;ref name="Fixes on the way for nonsecure UAV links – Air Force News, news from Iraq"/&gt;

On 27 June 2014, the Pentagon confirmed that a number of armed Predators had been sent to Iraq along with U.S. Special Forces following advances by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]. The Predators were flying 30 to 40 missions a day in and around Baghdad with government permission, and intelligence was shared with Iraqi forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armyrecognition.com/june_2014_global_defense_security_news_uk/unmanned_aircraft_predator_armed_with_hellfire_missiles_used_in_iraq_to_protected_u.s._advisers_2806.html Unmanned aircraft Predator armed with Hellfire missiles used in Iraq to protected U.S. advisers] - Armyrecognition.com, 28 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 August 2014, an MQ-1 Predator fired a missile at a militant mortar position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/8/us-launches-second-round-airstrikes-against-isil-o/ U.S. launches second round of airstrikes against ISIL, officials say] - Washingtontimes.com, 8 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning of [[Operation Inherent Resolve]] to January 2016, five UASF Predators were lost; four crashed from technical failures in Iraq, one in June 2015, two in October 2015, and one in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://airforcemag.com/DRArchive/Pages/2016/January%202016/January%2012%202016/Another-Predator-Bites-the-Dust.aspx Another Predator Bites the Dust] - Airforcemag.com, 12 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yemen===
{{Main article|CIA activities in Yemen}}

On 3 November 2002, a [[AGM-114 Hellfire|Hellfire missile]] was fired at a car in [[Yemen]], killing [[Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi]], an al-Qaeda leader thought to be responsible for the [[USS Cole bombing|USS ''Cole'' bombing]]. It was the first direct U.S. strike in the [[War on Terrorism]] outside [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="abc1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mit2002"/&gt;

In 2004, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC-TV) international affairs program ''Foreign Correspondent'' investigated this [[targeted killing]] and the involvement of then U.S. Ambassador as part of a special report titled "The Yemen Option". The report also examined the evolving tactics and countermeasures in dealing with Al Qaeda inspired attacks.&lt;ref name="The Yemen Option"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview with James Bamford on the National Security Agency"/&gt;

On 30 September 2011, a Hellfire fired from an American [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]] killed [[Anwar al-Awlaki]], an American-citizen cleric and Al Qaeda leader, in Yemen.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; Also killed was [[Samir Khan]], an American born in [[Saudi Arabia]], who was editor of al-Qaeda's English-language webzine, [[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]].

===Libya===
U.S. Air Force MQ-1B Predators have been involved in reconnaissance and strike sorties in [[Operation Unified Protector]]. An MQ-1B fired its first Hellfire missile in the conflict on 23 April 2011, striking a [[BM-21 Grad]].&lt;ref name="Qaddafi Forces Struck by First U.S. Drone as Rebels Say They Hold Misrata"/&gt;&lt;ref name="U.S. Carries Out First Drone Strike in Libya: Pentagon"/&gt; There are also some suggestions that a Predator was involved in the final attack against [[Gaddafi]].&lt;ref name="U.S. Drone Involved in Final Qaddafi Strike, as Obama Heralds Regime's 'End'"/&gt;

Predators returned to Libya in 2012, after [[U.S. Consulate attack in Benghazi|the attack]] that killed the US Ambassador in [[Benghazi]]. MQ-9 Reapers were also deployed.&lt;ref name="Libyan officials: U.S. drones behind airport closure"/&gt;

===Somalia===
On 25 June 2011, US Predator drones attacked an [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)]] training camp south of [[Kismayo]]. [[Ibrahim al-Afghani]], a senior al Shabaab leader was rumored to be killed in the strike.&lt;ref name="Senior Shabaab commander rumored to have been killed in recent Predator strike"/&gt;

Four Al-Shabaab fighters, including a Kenyan, were killed in a drone strike late February 2012.&lt;ref name="US Drone Strike Kills 4 in Somalia"/&gt;

===Iran===
On 1 November 2012, two Iranian [[Sukhoi Su-25]] attack aircraft engaged an unarmed Predator conducting routine surveillance over the [[Persian Gulf]] just before 05:00 EST. The Su-25s made two passes at the drone firing their 30&amp;nbsp;mm cannon; the Predator was not hit and returned to base.&lt;ref name=wired_Nov_8/&gt; The incident was not revealed publicly until 8 November. The U.S. stated that the Predator was over international waters, 16&amp;nbsp;miles away from Iran and never entered its airspace.&lt;ref name="wired_Nov_8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="militarytimes_Nov_9"/&gt; Iran states that the drone entered Iran's airspace and that its aircraft fired warning shots to drive it away.&lt;ref name=militarytimes_Nov_9/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brigadier General Amirali Hajizadeh, the commander of the IRGC's Aerospace Division, stated that the Iranian fighter jets fired warning shots to drive out the US drone"/&gt;

On 12 March 2013, an Iranian [[F-4 Phantom]] pursued an MQ-1 flying over the Persian Gulf. The unarmed reconnoitering Predator was approached by the F-4, coming within 16&amp;nbsp;miles of the UAV. Two U.S. fighters were escorting the Predator and verbally warned the jet, which made the Iranian F-4 break off. All American aircraft remained over international waters. An earlier statement by the Pentagon that the escorting planes fired a flare to warn the Iranian jet was later amended.&lt;ref name="militarytimes5"/&gt; The Air Force later revealed that the American jet that forced the Iranian F-4 to break off was an [[F-22 Raptor]].&lt;ref name="military"/&gt;

===Syria===

Armed MQ-1 are used in [[Operation Inherent Resolve]] against IS over Syria and Iraq. On 17 March 2015, a US MQ-1 was shot down by a Syrian government [[S-125]] SAM battery when it overflew the Port of Latakia, a region not involved in the international military operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theaviationist.com/2015/03/17/mq-1-shot-down-syria/|title=U.S. drone crashed in Syria.

===Philippines===
A 2012 ''[[New York Times]]'' article claimed that U.S. forces used a Predator drone to try and kill Indonesian terrorist [[Umar Patek]] in [[The Philippines]] in 2006. [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|The Philippines' military]] denied this action took place, however.&lt;ref name="abs-cbnnews"/&gt; It was reported that a drone was responsible for killing al-Qaeda operative [[Zulkifli bin Hir]] on [[Jolo island]] on 2 February 2012. The strike reportedly killed 15 Abu Sayyaf operatives.&lt;ref name="atimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brookings"/&gt; The Philippines stated the strike was done by manned [[OV-10]] aircraft with assistance from the U.S.&lt;ref name="wenatcheeworld"/&gt;

[[Image:Aphrodisias-res.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Electrical resistance map of ancient Aphrodisias]]
In [[archaeology]], '''geophysical survey''' is ground-based physical sensing techniques used for archaeological imaging or mapping. [[Remote sensing]] and marine surveys are also used in archaeology, but are generally considered separate disciplines. Other terms, such as "geophysical prospection" and "archaeological geophysics" are generally synonymous.

== Overview ==

Geophysical survey is used to create maps of subsurface [[Feature (archaeology)|archaeological features]]. Features are the non-portable part of the [[archaeological record]], whether standing structures or traces of human activities left in the [[soil]]. Geophysical instruments can detect buried features when their physical properties contrast measurably with their surroundings. In some cases individual [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], especially metal, may be detected as well. Readings taken in a systematic pattern become a [[data set]] that can be rendered as image maps. Survey results can be used to guide [[Archaeological excavation|excavation]] and to give archaeologists insight into the patterning of non-excavated parts of the site. Unlike other [[Archaeology#Field methods|archaeological methods]], geophysical survey is neither invasive nor destructive. For this reason, it is often used where preservation (rather than excavation) is the goal, and to avoid disturbance of culturally sensitive sites such as cemeteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Society for Historical Archaeology technical briefs: Geophysical Mapping of Historic Cemeteries | url=http://sha.org/assets/documents/Technical_briefs_articles/vol3article_04.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although geophysical survey has been used in the past with intermittent success, good results are very likely when it is applied appropriately. It is most useful when it is used in a well-integrated research design where interpretations can be tested and refined. Interpretation requires a knowledge both of the archaeological record, and of the way it is expressed geophysically. Appropriate instrumentation, survey design, and data processing are essential for success, and must be adapted to the unique [[geology]] and archaeological record of each site. In the field, control of data quality and spatial accuracy are critical.

== Methods ==
[[Image:EMsurvey.jpg|thumb|right|250px|EM conductivity survey]]
Geophysical methods used in archaeology are largely adapted from those used in mineral exploration, [[engineering]], and [[geology]]. Archaeological mapping presents unique challenges, however, which have spurred a separate development of methods and equipment. In general, geological applications are concerned with detecting relatively large structures, often as deeply as possible. In contrast, most archaeological sites are relatively near the surface, often within the top meter of earth. Instruments are often configured to limit the depth of response to better resolve the near-surface phenomena that are likely to be of interest. Another challenge is to detect subtle and often very small features – which may be as ephemeral as organic staining from decayed wooden posts - and distinguish them from rocks, roots, and other natural “clutter.” To accomplish this requires not only sensitivity, but also high density of data points, usually at least one and sometimes dozens of readings per square meter.

Most commonly applied to archaeology are [[magnetometer]]s, [[electrical resistance]] meters, [[ground-penetrating radar]] (GPR) and electromagnetic (EM) [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]] meters. These methods can resolve many types of archaeological features, are capable of high sample density surveys of very large areas, and of operating under a wide range of conditions. While common [[metal detector]]s are geophysical sensors, they are not capable of generating high-resolution imagery. Other established and emerging technologies are also finding use in archaeological applications.

'''Electrical resistance meters''' can be thought of as similar to the [[Ohmmeter]]s used to test electrical circuits. In most systems, metal probes are inserted into the ground to obtain a reading of the local electrical resistance.  A variety of probe configurations are used, most having four probes, often mounted on a rigid frame. Capacitively coupled systems that do not require direct physical contact with the soil have also been developed. Archaeological features can be mapped when they are of higher or lower resistivity than their surroundings. A stone foundation might impede the flow of electricity, while the organic deposits within a midden might conduct electricity more easily than surrounding soils. Although generally used in archaeology for planview mapping, resistance methods also have a limited ability to discriminate depth and create vertical profiles (see [[Electrical resistivity tomography]]).

'''Electromagnetic (EM) conductivity''' instruments have a response that is comparable to that of resistance meters (conductivity is the inverse of resistance). Underground archaeological features are detected by creating a [[magnetic field]] underground by applying an electric current that has a known frequency and magnitude through a sending coil. The currents spur a secondary current in underground conductors that is picked up by a receiving coil. Changes in the underground conductivity can indicate buried features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dalan |first=Rinita |title=Defining archaeological features with electromagnetic surveys at the Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site |url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/defining-archaeological-features-electromagnetic-surveys-cahokia-mounds-state-historic-site-12 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128185423/http://www.mendeley.com/research/defining-archaeological-features-electromagnetic-surveys-cahokia-mounds-state-historic-site-12 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 January 2013 |accessdate=13 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electromagnetic Surveys|url=http://www.subsurfacesurveys.com/em.htm|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although EM conductivity instruments are generally less sensitive than resistance meters to the same phenomena, they do have a number of unique properties. One advantage is that they do not require direct contact with the ground, and can be used in conditions unfavorable to resistance meters. Another advantage is relatively greater speed than resistance instruments. Unlike resistance instruments, conductivity meters respond strongly to metal. This can be a disadvantage when the metal is extraneous to the archaeological record, but can be useful when the metal is of archaeological interest. Some EM conductivity instruments are also capable of measuring [[magnetic susceptibility]], a property that is becoming increasingly important in archaeological studies.

[[Image:3030-mag.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Magnetic gradiometer map of Prehistoric fire-hearths]]
'''Magnetometers''' used in geophysical survey may use a single sensor to measure the total magnetic field strength, or may use two (sometimes more) spatially separated sensors to measure the gradient of the magnetic field (the difference between the sensors). In most archaeological applications the latter ([[gradiometer]]) configuration is preferred because it provides better resolution of small, near-surface phenomena. Magnetometers may also use a variety of different sensor types. Proton precession magnetometers have largely been superseded by faster and more sensitive fluxgate and caesium instruments.

Every kind of material has unique magnetic properties, even those that we do not think of as being “magnetic.” Different materials below the ground can cause local disturbances in the Earth’s magnetic field that are detectable with sensitive magnetometers. Magnetometers react very strongly to iron and steel, brick, burned soil, and many types of rock, and archaeological features composed of these materials are very detectable. Where these highly magnetic materials do not occur, it is often possible to detect very subtle anomalies caused by disturbed soils or decayed organic materials. The chief limitation of magnetometer survey is that subtle features of interest may be obscured by highly magnetic geologic or modern materials.

[[Image:radarsurvey.jpg|thumb|right|250px|GPR survey]]
'''[[Ground-penetrating radar]] (GPR)''' is perhaps the best known of these methods (although it is not the most widely applied in archaeology). The concept of radar is familiar to most people. In this instance, the radar signal – an electromagnetic pulse – is directed into the ground. Subsurface objects and stratigraphy (layering) will cause reflections that are picked up by a receiver. The travel time of the reflected signal indicates the depth. Data may be plotted as profiles, or as planview maps isolating specific depths.

GPR can be a powerful tool in favorable conditions (uniform sandy soils are ideal). It is unique both in its ability to detect some spatially small objects at relatively great depths and in its ability to distinguish the depth of anomaly sources. The principal disadvantage of GPR is that it is severely limited by less-than-ideal conditions. The high electrical conductivity of fine-grained sediments (clays and silts) causes conductive losses of signal strength; rocky or heterogeneous sediments scatter the GPR signal. Another disadvantage is that data collection is relatively slow.

'''Metal detectors''' use electromagnetic induction to detect metal. Although other types of instruments (notably magnetometers and electromagnetic conductivity meters) have some sensitivity to metal, specialized metal detectors are much more effective. Metal detectors are available in different configurations, varying in sophistication and sensitivity. Most have some capacity to discriminate between different types of metallic targets.

Common hand-held metal detectors are widely used by archaeologists. Most of these instruments do not create a logged data set and thus cannot be used for directly creating maps, but used in a systematic manner they can be a useful tool in archaeological research.  Sometimes external data loggers are attached to such detectors which collect information about detected materials and corresponding gps coordinates for further processing.  Misuse of these instruments on archaeological sites by treasure hunters and artifact collectors has been a serious problem in archaeological preservation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/feb/16/looting-antiquities-uk-heritage | work=The Guardian | first1=Maev | last1=Kennedy | first2=Sam | last2=Jones | title=Treasure raiders scooping up UK heritage | date=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicora.org/pdfs/RC31%20-%20looting.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/feb/16/looting-antiquities-uk-heritage | work=The Guardian | first1=Maev | last1=Kennedy | first2=Sam | last2=Jones | title=Treasure raiders scooping up UK heritage | date=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; however cooperative efforts between skilled amateur operators and academic teams are emerging in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sha.org/blog/index.php/2013/04/open-minds-clearer-signals-metal-detectorist-and-archaeologist-cooperation-takes-another-step | work=Society for Historical Archaeology | first1=Matthew | last1=Reeves | first2=Scott | last2=Clark | title=Open Minds, Clearer Signals – Metal Detectorist and Archaeologist Cooperation Takes Another Step | date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not as commonly used in archaeology, sophisticated metal detectors are available having much greater sensitivity than hand-held models. These instruments are capable of data logging and sophisticated target discrimination. They can be mounted on wheeled carts for survey data collection.

'''[[Lidar]]''' ('''LIght raDAR''') is an optical remote sensing technology that can measure the distance to a target by illuminating the target with [[light]], often using pulses from a [[laser]]. Lidar has many applications in the field of archaeology including aiding in the planning of field campaigns, mapping features beneath forest canopy,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unb.ca/passc/ImpactDatabase/images/whitecourt.htm EID; crater beneath canopy]&lt;/ref&gt; and providing an overview of broad, continuous features that may be indistinguishable on the ground.  Lidar can also provide archaeologists with the ability to create high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) of archaeological sites that can reveal micro-topography that are otherwise hidden by vegetation. Lidar-derived products can be easily integrated into a Geographic Information System (GIS) for analysis and interpretation.

'''Data collection''' is broadly similar regardless of the particular sensing instrument. Survey usually involves walking with the instrument along closely spaced parallel traverses, taking readings at regular intervals. In most cases, the area to be surveyed is staked into a series of square or rectangular survey "grids" (terminology can vary). With the corners of the grids as known reference points, the instrument operator uses tapes or marked ropes as a guide when collecting data. In this way, positioning error can be kept to within a few centimeters for high-resolution mapping. Survey systems with integrated global positioning systems (GPS) have been developed, but under field conditions, currently available systems lack sufficient precision for high-resolution archaeological mapping. Geophysical instruments (notably metal detectors) may also used for less formally "scanning" areas of interest.

'''Data processing and imaging''' convert raw numeric data into interpretable maps. Data processing usually involves the removal of statistical outliers and noise, and interpolation of data points. Statistical filters may be designed to enhance features of interest (based on size, strength, orientation, or other criteria), or suppress obscuring modern or natural phenomena. [[inverse problem|Inverse modeling]] of archaeological features from observed data is becoming increasingly important. Processed data are typically rendered as images, as contour maps, or in false relief. When geophysical data are rendered graphically, the interpreter can more intuitively recognize cultural and natural patterns and visualize the physical phenomena causing the detected anomalies.

== Development ==
[[File:Geophys at Pembroke Castle.webm|thumb|250px|A magnetic survey at [[Pembroke Castle]] carried out by [[Dyfed Archaeological Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://castlestudiestrust.org/blog/2017/01/19/geophysical-survey-at-pembroke-castle/ |first=Neil |last=Ludlow |title=Geophysical survey at Pembroke Castle |publisher=Castle Studies Trust |date=19 January 2017 |accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The use of geophysical survey is well established in European archaeology, especially in Great Britain, where it was pioneered in the 1940s and 1950s. It is increasingly employed in other parts of the world, and with increasing success as techniques are adapted to unique regional conditions.

In early surveys, measurements were recorded individually and plotted by hand. Although useful results were sometimes obtained, practical applications were limited by the enormous amount of labor required. Data processing was minimal and sample densities were necessarily low.

Although the sensitivity of sensors has improved, and new methods have been developed, the most important developments have been automated data logging and computers to handle and process large amounts of data. Continuing improvements in survey equipment performance and automation have made it possible to rapidly survey large areas. Rapid data collection has also made it practical to achieve the high sample densities necessary to resolve small or subtle features. Advances in processing and imaging software have made it possible to detect, display, and interpret subtle archaeological patterning within the geophysical data.

After Nigeria's independence in 1960, the cinema business rapidly expanded, with new cinema houses being established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olubomehin|first1=Oladipo O.|title=CINEMA BUSINESS IN LAGOS, NIGERIA SINCE 1903|journal=Historical Research Letter|date=2012|volume=3|issn= 2225-0964}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Nigerian content in theatres increased in the late 1960s into the 1970s, especially productions from Western Nigeria, owing to former [[theatre]] practitioners such as [[Hubert Ogunde]] and [[Moses Olaiya]] transitioning into the big screen.&lt;ref name="History of Nollywood"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nificon.org/about/history-of-nollywood/ |title=History of Nollywood |publisher=Nificon |accessdate=15 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906161318/http://www.nificon.org/about/history-of-nollywood/ |archivedate=6 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adegbola, Tunde 2011"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.africanfilmny.org/2011/coming-of-age-in-nigerian-moviemaking/ | title=Coming of Age in Nigerian Moviemaking | publisher=African Film Festival Inc.

The oil boom of 1973 through 1978 also contributed immensely to the spontaneous boost of the cinema culture in Nigeria, as the increased purchasing power in Nigeria made a wide range of citizens to have disposable income to spend on cinema going and on home television sets.&lt;ref name="History of Nollywood"/&gt; After several moderately successful films, ''Papa Ajasco'' (1984) by [[Wale Adenuga]] became one of the first Nigerian Blockbusters, reportedly grossing about ₦61,000 (approx. 2015 ₦21.5&amp;nbsp;million) in three days. A year later, ''Mosebolatan'' (1985) by [[Moses Olaiya]] also grossed ₦107,000 (approx. 2015 ₦44.2&amp;nbsp;million) in five days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olubomehin|first1=Oladipo O.|title=CINEMA BUSINESS IN LAGOS, NIGERIA SINCE 1903|journal=Historical Research Letter|date=2012|volume=3|issn=2224-3178}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s was also the period of major boom in the television industry, with several books from notable authors being adapted into television series.&lt;ref name="The Nation"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thenationonlineng.net/archive2/tblnews_Detail.php?id=39783 | title=The Nation Archive - D.

The Golden Age began to face a major gradual decline in the late 1980s; This decline has been attributed to several factors, including the reduction in the value of [[Naira]], lack of finance and marketing support, lack of standard film studios and production equipment, frequent Government [[structural adjustment]] programmes due to military dictatorships,&lt;ref name="History of Nollywood"/&gt; as well as inexperience on the part of practitioners.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.modernghana.com/movie/4024/3/gradually-the-cinemas-return-in-nigeria.html | title= Gradually, the cinemas return in Nigeria | publisher= Modern Ghana | date=19 February 2009 | accessdate=17 February 2015 | author=Adelakun, Abimbola}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also generally believed by stakeholders that the decline in this era was due to negligence as a result of the oil boom, which affected other sectors of the Nigerian economy as well.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; It has also been noted to be as a result of increase in the ownership of television sets across the country; the films produced during this era usually screened over a single weekend and are released on video the following week, it no longer made sense anymore to visit the theatres and most families preferred to wait a few days to get their hands on the [[VHS]] copies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vourlias, Christopher"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://america.aljazeera.com/multimedia/2014/12/nollywood-nigeriaregroups.html | title=Hooray for Nollywood: Nigerian film industry raises the artistic bar | publisher=[[Aljazeera America]]| work=[[Aljazeera]] | date=14 December 2014 | accessdate=17 February 2015 | author=Vourlias, Christopher }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, only a few of the once vibrant cinema houses were still in operation, and all had collapsed before 1999.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; However, as at 2009, there's an [[New Nigerian cinema|emerging movement]] in the film industry, which is rapidly reviving the cinema culture of Nigerians once again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-1336828821/from-celluloid-to-video-the-tragedy-of-the-nigerian|author =Olayiwola Abiodun|title=From Celluloid to Video: The Tragedy of the Nigerian Film Industry|website =Questia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/04/tour-golden-era-nigerian-movies-160426072909436.html|title=A tour through the golden era of Nigerian movies|website=[[Aljazeera]]|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vivarivamovie.com/2014/06/new-nollywood-cinema-home-video-productions-back-screen/ |title=New Nollywood Cinema: from home-video productions back to the screen | accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Pre-Independence===
In 1954, before Nigeria's independence, the Nigerian film industry became formally recognized as a sector and was grouped as a unit in the information department of the then [[Nigerian Federal Ministry of Information and Communications|Ministry of Information]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book | title=Introduction to Mass Communication in Nigeria | publisher=Spectrum Books Limited | author=Sambe, J. A. | year=2008 | location=[[Ibadan]], Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unit was a re-organized local unit, which united the broader term 'Nigerian Film Unit' which had been established in 1949;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.colonialfilm.org.uk/production-company/nigerian-film-unit |title= Nigerian Film Unit | publisher= ColonialFilm.org.uk | accessdate= 29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the function of this film unit was to produce documentary films and newsreels on local events of great importance, leading to the dominance of educative films in Nigerian theatres in the late 1950s&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; As at 1954, mobile cinema vans played to at least 3.5 million people in Nigeria, and films being produced by the Nigerian Film Unit were screened for free at the 44 available cinemas.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; The first film entirely copyrighted to this unit is ''Fincho'' (1957) by Sam Zebba; ''Fincho'' is also known as the first Nigerian film to be [[Color motion picture film|shot in colour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.goethe.de/ins/ng/de/lag/ver.cfm?fuseaction=events.detail&amp;event_id=11586033 | title=Lights, Camera, Africa!!! | publisher=Goethe Institute | accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Independence===
After Nigeria gained independence in 1960, the cinema business rapidly expanded, with new cinema houses being established.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Olubomehin |first1=Oladipo O. |title= Cinema Business in LAGOS, NIGERIA since 1903 |journal= Historical Research Letter |date=2012 |volume=3 |issn= 2225-0964}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there came a significant influx of American, Indian, Chinese and Japanese films; posters of films from these countries were all over theatre halls and actors from these industries became very popular in Nigeria. It was reported that Nigerian kids began to know more on "travails of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] than they did about the [[Wole Soyinka]]-led ''Mbari Mbayo'' cultural group, or the socio-cultural history of Nigeria".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web | url= http://web.ccsu.edu/afstudy/upd11-2.html | title=Editorial: Nigerian Film Industry | publisher=Africa Update Vol. XI, Issue 2 | work=Central Connecticut State University | date=Spring 2004| accessdate=16 July 2014 | author=Emeagwali, Gloria }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  However, in the late 1960s and into the 1970s Nigerian productions in theatres increased gradually, especially productions from Western Nigeria; this was basically due to former theatre practitioners such as [[Hubert Ogunde]], [[Moses Olaiya]], Jab Adu, Isola Ogunsola, Ladi Ladebo, Sanya Dosumu and Sadiq Balewa amongst others, who transitioned into the big screen.&lt;ref name="History of Nollywood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adegbola, Tunde 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; ''Latola Films'', which started the production of motion pictures since 1962, has often been noted as the earliest Nigerian indigenous film production company.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.total-facts-about-nigeria.com/nigerian-movies.html | title= Facts About Nigerian Movies and History | publisher=Total Facts about Nigeria | accessdate=22 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Television broadcasting in Nigeria also began in the 1960s and received much government support in its early years.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.transcampus.org/JORINDV10Jun2012/Jorind%20Vol10%20No2%20Jun%20Chapter32.pdf |last1=Nnabuko|first1=J.O. |last2=Anatsui |first2=Tina C.|title= NOLLYWOOD MOVIES AND NIGERIAN YOUTHS-AN EVALUATION |journal= JORIND 10|date=June 2012|volume=10 |issue=2|accessdate=18 February 2015|issn=1596-8308 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indigenization Decree and the 1970s boom==
In 1972, concerned about the influx of foreign culture into Nigeria, the ''[[Yakubu Gowon#Indigenization Decree|Indigenization Decree]]'' was issued by the then head of state [[Yakubu Gowon]]; which demands the transfer of ownership of about a total of 300 film theatres in the country from their foreign owners to Nigerians.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/4731908/The_Blossoming_of_the_Nigerian_Video_Film_Industry | title=The Blossoming of the Nigerian Video Film Industry | publisher=Academia | accessdate=7 April 2015 | author=Obiaya, Ikechukwu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Also, more Nigerians started playing active roles in cinema establishment; notable examples of this include: ''Metro cinema'' and ''Rivoli Cinema'', which was owned by Chief Lisabi, and ''Danjuma Cinema'' by Alhaji Danjuma.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; This transfer also resulted in the emergence of Nigerian playwrights, screenwriters and film producers; popular literature and theatre works were adapted into motion picture. One of the most popular film people in this new wave was [[Hubert Ogunde]], mainly because he promoted indigenous Nigerian language, arts and culture through his works.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The oil boom of 1973 through 1978 contributed immensely to the spontaneous boost of the cinema culture in Nigeria. The presence of foreign investments led to the erection of several cinema complexes. In 1976, The 5000-capacity [[National Arts Theatre]], Iganmu was constructed in Lagos. The theatre was incorporated with two cinemas, each having a capacity of over 700 people.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; At this time cinema business had become a notable employer of many people and also served as an important social function, as Nigerians visited cinemas for relaxation and entertainment purposes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thenationalpilot.com/27%2002%202014/Extinction%20of%20Cinemas.html#sthash.qSXS0jq9.dpbs | title=Extinction of Cinemas | publisher=National Pilot | work=National Pilot Newspaper  | date=27 February 2014 | accessdate=20 February 2015 | author=Abdulkadir, Shuaib}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased purchasing power in Nigeria also made a wide range of citizens to have extra money to spend on cinema going and on home television sets.&lt;ref name="History of Nollywood"/&gt;

Some foreign producers and directors also worked in Nigeria to make films in Nigeria, as a result of this boom, including people like: Ossie Davies who directed ''[[Kongi's Harvest (film)|Kongi's Harvest]]'', a film based on the novel of [[Kongi's Harvest|the same name]] by [[Wole Soyinka]], and was released in 1970. The film was adapted to screen by Soyinka, produced by Francis Oladele under the Calpenny Nigeria ltd production company.&lt;ref name="History of Nollywood"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; However, [[Ola Balogun]]'s post-Civil War film, ''Amadi'' (1975) was one of the first notable Nigerian [[historical film]]s on celluloid, which reflected on the Nigerian pre-Civil War days when Nigerians were very united.&lt;ref name="History of Nollywood"/&gt; Balogun subsequently directed ''Ajani Ogun'' in 1976, a film which grew to become very popular,&lt;ref name="History of Nollywood"/&gt; and is widely regarded as the first "commercial" Nigerian film, due to its success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.360nobs.com/2013/09/nollywood-at-20-half-baked-idea-words-by-seun-apara/ | title=Nollywood at 20: Half Baked Idea | publisher=360Nobs.com | date=22 September 2013 | accessdate=20 February 2015 | author=Apara, Seun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another film released after ''Ajani Ogun'' was ''Bisi – Daughter of the River'' (1977), which reflected Nigerian culture on film. Other popular films released in this era include: ''Bull Frog in the Sun'' (1974), ''Dinner with the Devil'' (1975); directed by the duo Sanya Dosunmu and Wole Amele,  [[Hubert Ogunde|Ogunde]]'s ''Aiye'' (1979), Jaiyesimi (1980), Cry Freedom (1981), and Eddie Ugbomah's ''The Great Attempt'' (1989); which was censored upon release, amongst others.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

''Mosebolatan'' (1985) by [[Moses Olaiya]] has been reported as the first Nigerian blockbuster, grossing approximately ₦107,000 (approx. 2015 ₦44.2&amp;nbsp;million) in five days. Before then, ''Papa Ajasco'' (1984) by [[Wale Adenuga]] was reported to have made about ₦61,000 (approx. 2015 ₦21.5&amp;nbsp;million) in three days.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; The success of films has been attributed to the fact that the faces of actors were already known from the once popular travelling theatre groups and the audiences were already familiar with the stories; Adesanya states that the "involvement of the Yoruba travelling theatre practitioners in motion picture production was perhaps the most auspicious single factor in the evolution of an indigenous cinema in Nigeria"&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Much later, [[Hubert Ogunde]] featured in [[Bruce Beresford]]'s ''[[Mister Johnson]]'' (1990), a film which was criticized for its ridiculous perception of Africans and dark skinned people as a whole; a perception prevalent with several other [[Western world|western]] films at the time.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

This boost was however not limited to only films, as this era was generally a period when Nigerian entertainment experienced major boost all round; Nigerian music also became popular and prolific during this period.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; The Nigerian nightlife scene came alive and [[highlife music]] was predominant. Musicians who reigned in this era include: [[Fela Kuti|Koola Lobitos]], [[Dr Sir Warrior|The Oriental Brothers]], [[I. K. Dairo]], [[Rex Lawson|Rex Jim Lawson]], [[E. T. Mensah]], and [[Victor Olaiya]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; In 1979, the Nigerian Government recognized the importance of film and its relationship to the Nigerian cultural identity; as a result, the Nigerian Film Corporation (NFC) was established; the corporation was created under [[Shehu Shagari]]'s military regime, as a standalone government agency to help develop the film industry.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The agency had the primary responsibility of regulating exhibitions of films, and censoring films shown at the cinemas - a responsibility later transferred to the National Films and Video Censor Board (NFVCB).&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;

===Emergence of Television industry in the 1980s===
The emergence of [[Television network|television]] in Nigeria was a significant development in the Nigerian film industry. The Western Nigeria Television Service (WNTV), Nigeria's first television station, began operation in the then Western Region in October 1959. The other two regions of the country soon followed suit; with the establishment of the Eastern Nigeria Television Service (ENTV) in Enugu, in 1960, and the Radio Television Kaduna (RKTV) in Kaduna, in March 1962. Also in 1962, The Federal Government established a fourth station, the Nigerian Television Service, in the then capital, [[Lagos]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; The numbers grew rapidly and in the mid-1980s, every State in Nigeria had its own broadcasting station.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

Laws were made by regulating bodies to limit foreign contents on television, with the [[Nigerian Broadcasting Commission|National Commission]] recommending a minimum of 60 percent local programming content for all broadcasting stations. This led to television producers to begin the broadcast of local popular theatre productions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt; [[Chinua Achebe]]'s novel, ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'' was adapted as a television series on [[Nigerian Television Authority|National Television]] in 1987 and became very successful.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; At this time, Another very successful television adaptation was the adaptation of [[Daniel O. Fagunwa|D.O. Fagunwa]]'s 1949's novel, ''Igbo Olodumare''. The television series, which is of the same title witnessed a tremendous success, especially in South western states, where it was reported that the show constantly left streets deserted during its broadcast on Sunday evenings.&lt;ref name="The Nation"/&gt; Other television successes witnessed in the 1980s include series such as: ''Adio Family'', ''[[The Village Headmaster]]'', ''Cock's Crow at Dawn'', ''The Masquerade'', ''Mirror in the Sun'', ''Checkmate'', ''Sura The Tailor'', ''[[Second Chance (1987 TV series)|Second Chance]]'' and ''Awada Kerikeri''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; [[Hausa language|Hausa]] comedy soap operas such as ''Karkuzu'' and ''Karambana'' were also quite popular in this period.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Many of these television productions were later released on video and as a result, a small scale informal video trade developed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

==Decline==
As of late 1980s, the cinema culture was beginning to face a major decline, and most Nigerian film producers had transitioned to television productions.&lt;ref name="History of Nollywood"/&gt; The gradual decline of the Golden era of Nigerian cinema has been attributed to several factors, including the reduction in the value of [[Naira]], lack of finance and marketing support, lack of standard film studios and production equipment, frequent Government [[structural adjustment]] programmes due to military dictatorships,&lt;ref name="History of Nollywood"/&gt; as well as inexperience on the part of practitioners.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt;  It is also generally believed by stakeholders that the decline in this era was due to negligence as a result of the oil boom, which affected other sectors of the Nigerian economy as well.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

Some researchers have also noted the decline to be as a result of increase in the ownership of television sets across the country. A survey conducted in 1974 reported that over 87 percent of Nigerians viewed about two hours of television programmes daily, across the country. However, by 1984, the television programming in the western region, which is the major area these cinemas serve, had improved tremendously and more television stations were established in the region as well, leading to a significant decline in the Nigerian cinema culture and embrace of television viewing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; As at 1987, there were reportedly over 5 million registered television sets in the country, which is estimated to be much higher when unregistered sets are considered. "The oil boom [in this era] made every other household in the city centres affluent enough to own not only a television set but also a home video player."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; [[Jide Kosoko]], one of the veteran actors of this era noted that when television sets and VHS players became a feature in most Nigerian homes, films produced during this era normally screen over a single weekend and are released on video the following week. He stated that it no longer made sense to view at the theatres anymore and most families would therefore rather wait a few days and get their hands on the [[VHS]] copies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vourlias, Christopher"/&gt;

The re-emergence of the cinema culture in [[New Nigerian cinema|New Wave era]] has also led to another deduction that the demise of the Nigerian cinema culture was probably also due to the unfashionable appearance of most cinemas of the Golden era, as the cinema chains launched in the New Wave era were all modern with additional entertainment features apart from movie viewing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The drastic decline in cinema culture resulted in some of the existing cinema houses being acquired by religious bodies and turned to churches; others were simply just closed down.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; In the early 1990s, only a few of the once vibrant cinema houses were still in operation, and all had collapsed before 1999.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; This development accelerated the glory days of the [[Video film era|home video entertainment era]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==2000s resurgence of cinemas==
{{main|New Nigerian cinema}}
Since the early 2000s, several discussions and conferences have been held, based on how to revamp the Nigerian film industry and bring about more professionalism like it used to be in the golden era. During this time, some other filmmakers, such as [[Tunde Kelani]] and [[Tade Ogidan]] tried to make "break away" films, which were quite different from the norm. The now defunct ''Amstel Malta Box Office'' production company also made several films with the aim of making a difference. However, all of these films were also produced in the same video format that the other filmmakers used, albeit with quality stories and better directions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8b&gt;{{cite web | url= http://africamusiclaw.com/nigerias-nollywood-generated-1-72-trillion-naira-revenue-in-2013/ |title= Nigeria's Nollywood Generated 1.72 Trillion Naira Revenue in 2013 |publisher= Africa Music Law |date=30 Dec 2013 |accessdate= 2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated7b&gt;{{cite web |url= http://businessdayonline.com/2013/12/nollywood-improves-quality-leaps-to-n1-72trn-revenue-in-2013/ | title= Nollywood improves quality, leaps to N1.72trn revenue in 2013 |publisher= Business Day |date= 24 December 2013 | accessdate= 21 March 2013 |author= Osae-Brown, Funke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Few years into the 2000s, Nigeria began to experience the growth of cinemas, which were initially structured for the middle and upper class. [[The Silverbird Group]] is the first company to launch a series of modern cinema houses across major cities in Nigeria, mostly situated in affluent areas and districts.&lt;ref name="History of Nollywood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; It launched its cinema chains in 2004, starting with the [[Silverbird Galleria]] in [[Victoria Island, Lagos]]. Not long after the establishment of Silverbird cinemas, Genesis Deluxe Cinemas and Ozone Cinemas were also launched creating a competition in the cinema business.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; Much later, in the 2010s, FilmHouse cinemas also came into the picture, leading to a wider availability of cinemas in the country, and most importantly, availability outside the affluent neighbourhoods.

Since 2006, there have been several "Project Nollywood" funds by the Nigerian Government, provided to Nigerian filmmakers for aiding the production of high quality films, as well as to aid proper distribution infrastructure across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/ecobank-brand-positioning-through-funding-of-nollywood/162681/ | title=Ecobank: Brand Positioning Through Funding of Nollywood | publisher=This Day Live | date=27 October 2013 | accessdate=14 February 2015 | author=Okonkwo, Kasie | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031202719/http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/ecobank-brand-positioning-through-funding-of-nollywood/162681 | archivedate=31 October 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The grants have also been used to help more Nigerian filmmakers in training, funding, and also help in creating necessary infrastructure for the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/concerning-project-nollywood/141676/ | title=Concerning Project Nollywood | publisher=This Day Live | date=10 March 2013 | accessdate=14 February 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312051331/http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/concerning-project-nollywood/141676 | archivedate=12 March 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://huhuonline.com/index.php/opinions/2210-editorial-concerning-project-nollywood | title=Editorial: Concerning Project Nollywood | publisher=Huhu Online | date=12 September 2013 | accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodor Anton Ippen]], who would become a [[Consul (representative)|consul]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] in [[Shkodër|Scutari]] between 1897 and 1903, belonged to the group of Albanologists whose works were published through the state-financed institutes of [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Blumi |first=Isa |title=Seeing Beyond the River Drin, Sarajevo, Ottoman Albanians and Imperial Rivalry in the Balkans after 1878 |url= http://www.kakanien.ac.at/beitr/fallstudie/IBlumi1.pdf |year=2007 |publisher= Kakanien revisited |location= Austria |page=3|quote= At the center of this Sarajevo-based policy were highly regarded Albanologists such as Theodor Ippen (b.1861), Norbert Jokl (1877-1942) and Franz Nopcsa (1877-1933) who all published influential studies on Albanian language, geography, archeology and history through state-funded institutes in Budapest, Sarajevo and Vienna. |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He participated in writing and disseminating the first history of Albania published on the [[Albanian language]] because he insisted that creating an Albanian national consciousness would be beneficial for the Dual Monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Clayer |first=Nathalie |author= |authorlink= |author-separator= |editor= |editor2= |editor2-last= |editor2-first= |editor-link= |editor2-link= |others= |title=Aux origines du nationalisme albanais: la naissance d'une nation majoritairement musulmane on Europe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cb6AsVBn7rQC&amp;pg=PA416&amp;dq=%22Albanie,+l%27%C3%A9criture+et+la+diffusion+d%27une+histoire+de+l%27Albanie.%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Albanie%2C%20l'%C3%A9criture%20et%20la%20diffusion%20d'une%20histoire%20de%20l'Albanie.%22&amp;f=false |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate= January 19, 2011 |edition= |series= |volume= |origyear= |year= 2007 |publisher= Karthala |location= |language= |isbn= 9782845868168 |oclc= |doi= |doi-inactive-date=|bibcode= |id= |page= 416 |pages= |nopp= |at= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=Ce sont aussi les fonctionnaires austro-hongrois qui furent à l'origine du premier livre sur l'histoire de l'Albanie en albanais“.

== Modern Albanian historiography ==

There are two main sources of modern Albanian [[historiography]]: intellectuals from the [[Albanian National Awakening]] (''Rilindja'') period and historians from the regime of the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kressing |2002|p=40}}{{quote|Modern Albanian historiography has two important sources: the thinkers of the 'renaissance' (rilindja) period (1844-1912), and the historians of the Communist regime.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1878 onward, the national Awakening period galvanised Albanian intellectuals among some who emerged as the first modern Albanian scholars and  they were preoccupied with overcoming linguistic and cultural differences between Albanian subgroups (Gegs and Tosks) and religious divisions (Muslim and Christians).&lt;ref name="Kostov40"/&gt; At that time, these scholars lacked access to many primary sources to construct the idea that Albanians were descendants of Illyrians, while Greater Albania was not considered a priority.&lt;ref name="Kostov40"/&gt; Compared with their Balkan counterparts, these Albanian historians were very moderate and alongside politicians mainly had the goal to get socio-political recognition and autonomy for Albanians under Ottoman rule.&lt;ref name="Kostov40"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kostov|first=Chris|title=Contested Ethnic Identity: The Case of Macedonian Immigrants in Toronto 1900-1996|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9783034301961|url=https://books.google.com/?id=P-1m1FLtrvsC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Serb+historians+illyrians#v=onepage&amp;q=Rilindja&amp;f=false|pages=40|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two major historical works written by Albanians during this early phase of modern historiography within Albania are Athanase Gegaj's ''L'Albanie et l'Invasion turque au XVe siècle'' (1937) and [[Fan Noli|Fan Noli's]] ''George Castrioti Scanderbeg (1405-1468)'' (1947), both written outside Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gran|first=Peter|title=Beyond Eurocentrism: A New View of Modern World History|year=1996|publisher=Syracuse University Press|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Albanian socialist historiography (1945-1992) ===
Albanian socialist historiography was associated with the Albanian state building project of national legitimation.&lt;ref name="DiLellio11"/&gt; Albanian historiography was based upon the works of a group of Albanian speaking intelligentsia that during the early to mid 19th century developed a national narrative when professional Albanian historians did not exist.&lt;ref name="DiLellio11"/&gt; Balanced approaches to history were not encouraged during the period between the end of [[World War II]] and the death of [[Enver Hohxa]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="Fischer281"/&gt; After the Second World War the communist government trained scholars to become historians and write Albanian history, while due to the political context they were preoccupied with matters relating to national identity.&lt;ref name="DiLellio11"/&gt;  In 1959, the first volume on the history of Albania was published that dealt with topics ranging from antiquity until the 19th century and was a major undertaking that was a serious analysis of Greek, Latin, Byzantine and Ottoman sources.&lt;ref name="DiLellio11"/&gt; Elements of national construction dominated parts of the work such as stressing the Illyrians as the ancestors of the Albanians, the existence of an Albanian medieval state and that Albanians during the Ottoman period were an autonomous entity.&lt;ref name="DiLellio11"/&gt; These themes though linked to matters of national identification were not completely unfounded.&lt;ref name="DiLellio11"/&gt; During the communist period, the regime attempted to instill a national consciousness through the scope of a teleological past based upon Illyrian descent, Skanderbeg's resistance to the Ottomans and the nationalist reawakening (''Rilindja'') of the 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="SchmidtNeke14"/&gt; Those themes and concepts of history have still continued within a post-communist environment modified and adapted to fit contemporary Albania's aspirations regarding Europe.&lt;ref name="SchmidtNeke14"/&gt; Albanian historiographical scholarship though compromised by political influences did manage to produce reliable information at times.
&lt;ref name="DiLellio11"&gt;{{harvnb|Di Lellio|2009|p=11}}. "The development of an Albanian scholarly tradition of historians is relatively recent and tightly linked to a project of national legitimation. While a loose international network of Albanian-speaking intellectuals began to develop a national narrative in the first half of the 19th century, professional historians were absent. Only after WWII did the Enver Hoxha regime start to train the scholars who would take up the task of writing Albanian history and, from the outset, the profession was strongly influenced by an authoritarian project of state building; political circumstances kept Albanian historians absorbed by issues of national identity. This does not mean that their work does not yield reliable information. The first volume of the history of Albania that first appeared in 1959 concerns the period from antiquity through the mid-19th century and is a major enterprise based on a serious examination of Greek, Latin, Byzantine and Turkish sources. Its emphasis on the autochthonous character of the Albanians as the sole descendants of the Illyrians and on the existence of an Albanian state in the XII century; and the insistence on the Albanian nation as an autonomous entity during the Ottoman epoch, are all elements of a national construction and in the end inseparable from the process of national identification, but not entirely without foundation."&lt;/ref&gt; Of Stalinist Albania, [[Bernd Jürgen Fischer]] stated that it produced good historians though not always good history.&lt;ref name="Fischer281"&gt;{{harvnb|Jürgen Fischer|1999|p=281}}{{quote|The political climate in Albania under Enver Hoxha, who ruled Albania from World War II until his death in 1985, did little to encourage a balanced approach to history.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing upon themes of national struggles established during the Rilindja period, Albanian socialist historiography centred itself upon the main narrative of nationhood that within history writing included Marxist historical materialism and nationalism.&lt;ref name="Brisku16"/&gt; There were two main notable groups of Albanian historians in that period:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jürgen Fischer|1999|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Military historians: Ndreci Plasari and Shyqri Ballvora
# Political historians: [[Alex Buda]], Stefanaq Pollo, Arben Puto and Luan Omari.

Alex Buda, who also became a president of the [[Academy of Sciences of Albania]], is sometimes considered as a founder of the Albanian post WWII historiography.&lt;ref name="Keber2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hysa|first1=Armanda|last2=Keber|first2=Katarina|title=Historièni seminar 8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QFKZ_D8_Y6AC&amp;pg=PA120|year=2010|publisher=Založba ZRC|isbn=978-961-254-216-0|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buda belonged to a small group of intellectuals allowed by the Albanian communist regime to have access to foreign literature in order to use them to prepare new ideological and theoretical directives for the rest of their colleagues.&lt;ref name="Keber2010-2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hysa|first1=Armanda|last2=Keber|first2=Katarina|title=Historièni seminar 8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QFKZ_D8_Y6AC&amp;pg=PA120|year=2010|publisher=Založba ZRC|isbn=978-961-254-216-0|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post communist Albanian Historiography ===

When Albanian socialist historiography dealt with people, it tended to see things black and white.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jürgen Fischer|1999|p=281}}{{quote|...socialist Albanian historiography tends, when dealing with people, to see things in black and white terms.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy of understanding history through such dichotomies has remained for a majority of Albanians which for example they view Skanderbeg and the anti-Ottoman forces as "good" while the Ottomans are "bad".&lt;ref name="SchmidtNeke15"/&gt; The influence of ideology upon Albanian historians during the socialist era of Albanian Historiography can be seen not only in publications published by [[Academy of Sciences of Albania]] (i.e. ''Historia e Shqipërisë'') but also in specialized works published by individual authors like Viron Koka, Mentar Belegu and Ilijaz Fishta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ilirjani |first= Altin |author2= Arolda Elbasani, Ridvan Peshkopia  |author-separator= |editor= |editor2= |editor2-last= |editor2-first= |editor-link= |editor2-link= |others= |title=Albanian Journal of Politics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e_TKBd1prK0C&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=historiography+albania#v=onepage&amp;q=historiography%20albania&amp;f=false |volume=1  |year=2010 |publisher= Shoqata Shqiptare e Shkencave Politike |location=Chapel Hill, NC |language= |isbn= 9780977666225|oclc=70817932 |page=178 |quote=... the ideologically tingled historiography of socialist-era Albanian historians, as evidenced not only in official publications issued by the Academy of Sciences of Albania, like in....Historia e Shqipërisë, but also in more specialized works by authors such as...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to that legacy, [[Robert Elsie]] emphasized that there was no reliable and objective historiography in Albania which could serve as a basis for his historical dictionary of Albania he compiled and published in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2010|p=xi}}{{quote|...Compiling a historical dictionary for a country... as Albania... because there is still no objective and reliable historiography in Albania.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oliver Jens Schmitt]] stated that the post-World War II Albanian regime propagated the official version of the past using all available means. People in Albania were subjected to state organized indoctrination and propaganda. Schmitt explained that because of political influence it was impossible to organize open discussion about socialist historiography, while those who attempted to criticize it would be denounced often as non-professionals or foreigners with evil objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jens|first=Oliver|author2=Ben Andoni|title=Historia shqiptare-një histori e hapur|journal=ResPublica|url=http://respublica.al/opinion/2013/02/11/historia-shqiptare-nje-histori-e-hapur|accessdate=6 February 2014|language=Albanian|year=2013|quote=Mbas 1945, për herë të parë në historinë e Shqipërisë, Shteti përdorte të gjitha mjetet e tij për të prodhuar dhe propaganduar versionin e tij zyrtar të së shkuarës. Fatkeqësisht, kjo ndodhte në një shtet Orvellian, ku historianët ishin thjesht mjete në duart e diktatorit, i cili personalisht diktonte linjat kryesore të interpretimit. Kjo ishte periudha ku shumë nga Shqiptarët u konfrontuan për herë të parë me historinë – e sistemi shkollor i shtetit të ri integroi për herë të parë gjithashtu fëmijë nga zonat rurale dhe familjet e varfra. ... Kritikët ose u denoncuan si jo-profesionistë (sepse ata nuk u rekrutuan në institucionet kërkimore për shkak të mendimeve të tyre ndryshe) apo si të huaj me qëllime të errëta.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The influence of such historical myths still remain which for example in 2009 Schmitt was severely criticised in Albania after producing an academic biography that challenged the traditional Albanian concept of Skanderbeg.&lt;ref name="SchmidtNeke14"&gt;{{harvnb|Schmidt-Neke|2014|p=14.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-communist Albanian historiography has attempted to move away from previous political influences of the Hoxha era and shift the discipline toward a more scientific methodological direction, however, themes of national struggles continue.&lt;ref name="Brisku16"&gt;{{harvnb|Brisku|2013|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Political pressures have been placed upon contemporary Albanian historiography.&lt;ref name="Brisku17"/&gt; For example the Albanian government in 2013 reformed the Academy of Sciences by allowing it to influence the scholarship of historians by urging them to rewrite history (mostly in relation to the modern period).&lt;ref name="Brisku17"/&gt; Those moves caused heated debate among historians of which one group viewing the initial intent as being a move to place aside distortions of the past that assisted in empowering the communists and another group seeing it as a repeat of the communist regime's politicisation of history.&lt;ref name="Brisku17"&gt;{{harvnb|Brisku|2013|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==

=== Early Albanian history ===
{{Main article|Origin of the Albanians}}

The picture created by [[Science and technology in Albania|Albanian science]] about the early history of [[Albanians]] is simplified, uncritical and has appearances of fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bartl|2001|p=17}}{{quote|Слика коју албанска наука ствара о раној историјисопственог народа је поједностављена, некритичка и делује исконструисано.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albanian scholars have continuously asserted and claimed antecedence of [[Albanian culture]] over [[Slavic culture|Slav culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elsie|2004|p=xvii}}{{quote|Albanian scholars ever ready to assert antecedence of their culture over that of the Slavs }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official Albanian historiography, which influenced many Albanians, emphasizes that Albanians have always lived in Albania and supports the hypothesis that Albanians are descendants of [[Illyrians]], while some non-Albanian scholars consider the question of the origin of Albanians to be unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kressing |2002|p=41}}{{quote|The official historiography claims that Albanians have always lived in Albania and therefore gives credit to the thesis that they are the descendants of the Illyrians...However, non-Albanian researchers consider the question of Illyrian or Thracian origin of the Albanians to be unsolved...Nevertheless, this version of history has influenced many Albanians}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ottoman period and Islam in Albania ===
{{Main article|Islamization of Albania|Islam in Albania#Debates about Islam and contemporary Albanian identity}}

The image of [[Islam]] produced by both main sources of modern Albanian historiography was neither objective nor positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kressing |2002|p=40}}{{quote|Neither of them produced an objective and positive image of Islam.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Albanian Communists|communist]] [[Fall of communism in Albania|regime fell]] (1992) in Albania, contemporary Albanian historians have still held onto inherited [[stereotypes]] and [[myths]] regarding Islam from Albanian socialist historiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kressing |2002|p=41}}{{quote|Since the fall of Communism, Albanian historians have not started to free themselves from their inherited stereotypes. This explains why contemporary history, when it comes to Islam, is still the prisoner of myths.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albanian historiographical myths regarding Islam include:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kressing |2002|p=41}}{{quote|One of these myths is that Islam is an alien element of Albanian culture imported by the Ottomans. The reason is that Albanians were originally Christian (Saint Paul visited Illyria). Other myths say that they had converted for a number of reasons which had nothing to do with religion. They were opportunists. They wanted to escape the taxes imposed on Christians and to benefit from the many advantages attached to being Muslim in a Muslim society. It is said also that they were forced by the Ottomans to embrace Islam. Those who converted are often presented as traitors to the true spirit of the nation. Another important myth is the weakness of Albanians’ religious feeling. Communists worked hard to show that in their history national feeling was always more important for Albanians than religious feeling. In their propaganda, they did not hesitate to distort the ideas of the rilindja writers. As an example, they used - out of context - the famous declaration of Pashko Vasa Shkodrani: ‘The religion of the Albanians is Albanianism’. Actually, he wanted to encourage national unity while still respecting each person’s religious belief.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Islam was imported by the [[Ottomans]] and is an alien element of Albanian culture.
# Albanians converted from [[Christianity]] to Islam not because of their religious feelings though instead for other opportunistic reasons or because they were sometimes forced to do so.
# Albanian religious sentiments are weak because Albanian national feeling was always more important for Albanians than their religious adherence and affiliations.

Numerous historians from Albania with nationalist perspectives (Ramadan Marmallaku, Kristo Frasheri, Skender Anamali, Stefanaq Pollo, Skender Rizaj and Arben Puto) intentionally emphasized "the Turkish savagery" and "heroic Christian resistance against the Osmanli state in Albania".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kopanski|1997|p=192}}{{quote|Albanian nationalist historians like Ramadan Marmallaku, Kristo Frasheri, Skender Anamali, Stefanaq Pollo, Skender Rizaj and Arben Puto in their books deliberately emphasized "the Turkish savagery" and "heroic Christian resistance against the 
Osmanli state in Albania".}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albanian historiography tends to ignore religiously inspired enmity between Albanians of different faiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwandner-Sievers|2002|p=62}}{{quote|...there are many instances of religiously inspired animosities, which present day Albanian historiography tends to ignore.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trends from Albanian nationalist historiography composed by scholars during and of the communist era onward linger on that interpret Ottoman rule as being the "yoke" period, akin to other Balkan historiographies.&lt;ref name="SchmidtNeke15"&gt;{{harvnb|Schmidt-Neke|2014|p=15.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skanderbeg ===

Although the [[Myth of Skanderbeg]] had little to do with the reality of historical Skanderbeg, it was incorporated in works about [[history of Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Bartl |first= Peter |author= |authorlink= |author-separator= |editor= |editor2= |editor2-last= |editor2-first= |editor-link= |editor2-link= |others= |title=Bartl, Peter: review of: Schmitt, Oliver Jens, Skanderbeg.

=== Treaty of London ===
{{Main article|Treaty of London (1913)}}

The Treaty of London interpreted by nationalist Albanian historiography symbolizes the partition of the Albanian nation into three parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Ersoy |first= Ahmet |author2= Maciej Górny; Vangelis Kechriotis |title=Modernism : the creation of nation-states |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8j-Uemo6SfoC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=historiography+albania#v=onepage&amp;q=historiography%20albania&amp;f=false |year=2010 |publisher=Central European University Press |location= Budapest ; New York  |isbn=9781441684110  |oclc=699519530 |pages=236, 237 |quote=Decisions of the London ...In nationalist Albanian historiography, this symbolizes the partition of the nation into three parts; Kosovo was annexed by Serbia, Çamëria (Gr. Tsamouria) was annexed by Greece, and the remaining part became the state of Albania  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other ===

The Serbian argument that Kosovo was first settled by the Albanians in the 17th century is rejected by modern Albanian historiography.&lt;ref name="Singh2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Jasvir|authorlink=|title=Problem of Ethicity: Role of United Nations in Kosovo Crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pm-9_uxFw5UC&amp;pg=PA84|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Dr. Jasvir Singh|isbn=978-81-7142-701-7|page=84|quote=Modern Albanian historiography rejects the Serbian argument that the Albanians first settled in Kosovo in seventeenth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of religion}}

The '''history of religion''' refers to the written record of human [[religious]] experiences and ideas. This period of religious history begins with the [[invention of writing]] about 5,200 years ago (3200 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/wrtg/hd_wrtg.htm |title=The Origins of Writing &amp;#124; Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prehistory of [[religion]] involves the study of religious beliefs that existed prior to the advent of written records. One can also study comparative religious chronology through a [[timeline of religion]].  Writing played a major role in standardizing religious texts regardless of time or location, and making easier the memorization of prayers and divine rules. The case of the Bible involves the collation of multiple oral texts handed down over the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Humayun Ansari|title=The Infidel Within: Muslims in Britain Since 1800|year=2004|publisher=C.

The word "religion" as used in the 21st century does not have an obvious pre-colonial translation into non-European languages. The anthropologist Daniel Dubuisson writes that "what the West and the history of religions in its wake have objectified under the name 'religion' is ... something quite unique, which could be appropriate only to itself and its own history".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Dubuisson.

Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003. p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The history of other [[culture]]s' interaction with the "religious" category is therefore their interaction with an idea that first developed in [[Europe]] under the influence of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Fitzgerald.

==History of study==
The school of religious history called the [[History of religions school|''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule'']], a late 19th-century [[Germany|German]] school of thought, originated the systematic study of [[religion]] as a [[society|socio]]-[[culture|cultural]] phenomenon. It depicted religion as evolving with human culture, from primitive [[polytheism]] to [[ethical monotheism]].

The ''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule'' emerged at a time when scholarly study of the [[Bible]] and of [[church history]] flourished in Germany and elsewhere (see [[higher criticism]], also called the ''historical-critical method''). The study of religion is important: religion and similar concepts have often shaped civilizations' law and moral codes, social structure, art and music.

==Overview==
The 19th century saw a dramatic increase in knowledge about a wide variety of [[cultures]] and religions, and also the establishment of economic and social histories of [[social progress|progress]]. The "history of religions" school sought to account for this religious diversity by connecting it with the social and economic situation of a particular group.

Typically, religions were divided into stages of progression from simple to complex societies, especially from [[polytheistic]] to [[monotheistic]] and from extempore to organized. One can also classify religions as circumcising and non-circumcising, proselytizing (attempting to convert people of other religion) and non-proselytizing. Many religions share common beliefs.

==Origin==
{{See also|Evolutionary origin of religions|Timeline of religion}}
The earliest evidence of religious ideas dates back several hundred thousand years to the [[Middle Paleolithic|Middle]] and [[Lower Paleolithic]] periods. Archaeologists refer to apparent intentional burials of [[Archaic humans|early ''Homo sapiens'']] from as early as 300,000 years ago as evidence of religious ideas. Other evidence of religious ideas include symbolic artifacts from [[Middle Stone Age]] sites in Africa. However, the interpretation of early paleolithic artifacts, with regard to how they relate to religious ideas, remains controversial. Archeological evidence from more recent periods is less controversial. Scientists({{which|date=July 2017}} generally interpret a number of artifacts from the [[Upper Paleolithic]] (50,000-13,000 BCE) as representing religious ideas. Examples of Upper Paleolithic remains associated with religious beliefs include the [[löwenmensch figurine|lion man]], the [[Venus figurines]], cave paintings from [[Chauvet Cave]] and the elaborate ritual burial from [[Sungir]].

In the 19th century researchers proposed various theories regarding the origin of religion, challenging earlier claims of a Christianity-like [[urreligion]]. Early theorists [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] (1832-1917) and [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820-1903) proposed the concept of [[animism]], while archaeologist  [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] (1834-1913) used the term "[[fetishism]]". Meanwhile, religious scholar [[Max Müller]] (1823-1900) theorized that religion began in [[hedonism]] and folklorist [[Wilhelm Mannhardt]] (1831-1880) suggested that religion began in "naturalism", by which he meant mythological explanation of natural events.&lt;ref&gt;"Religion". ''Encyclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europeo-Americana'', 70 vols. Madrid. 1907-1930.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}} All of these theories have since been widely criticized; there is no broad consensus regarding the origin of religion.

[[Pre-pottery Neolithic A]] (PPNA) [[Göbekli Tepe]], the oldest religious site yet discovered anywhere&lt;ref name="ArchMag"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.archaeology.org/0811/abstracts/turkey.html| title=The World's First Temple| work= Archaeology magazine |date=Nov–Dec 2008 | page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes circles of erected massive T-shaped stone pillars, the world's oldest known [[megalith]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qR5TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47|title=The Archaeology of Malta|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107006690|page=47|language=en|last1=Sagona|first1=Claudia|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; decorated with [[Abstract art|abstract]], enigmatic [[pictogram]]s and [[sculpture|carved]] animal reliefs. The site, near the home place of original wild wheat, was built before the so-called [[Neolithic Revolution]], i.e., the beginning of [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]] around 9000 BCE. But the construction of Göbekli Tepe implies organization of an advanced order not hitherto associated with [[Paleolithic]], [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPNA]], or [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B|PPNB]] societies. The site, abandoned around the time the first agricultural societies started, is still being excavated and analyzed, and thus might shed light to the significance it had had for the region's older, foraging communities, as well as for the general history of religions.  

The [[Pyramid Texts]] from ancient Egypt are the oldest known [[religious texts]] in the world, dating to between 2400-2300 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SieAmOiyGQMC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=the+pyramid+texts+oldest+religious|title=An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Literature|last=Budge|first=Wallis|isbn=0-486-29502-8|page=9|authorlink=E.

Surviving early copies of complete religious texts include: 

The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], representing complete texts of the Hebrew [[Tanakh]]; these scrolls were copied approximately 2000 years ago. 

Complete Hebrew texts, also of the [[Tanakh]], but translated into the Greek language ([[Septuagint]] 300-200 BC), were in wide use by the early [[1st century]] CE. 

===Advantages of religion===
Organized religion emerged as a means of providing social and economic stability to large populations through the following ways:
* Organized religion served to justify a central authority, which in turn possessed the right to collect taxes in return for providing social and security services to the state. The empires of [[India]] and [[Mesopotamia]] were [[theocracies]], with chiefs, kings and emperors playing dual roles of political and [[spiritual leader]]s.&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{cite book
|title= [[The Science of Good and Evil]]
|isbn= 0-8050-7520-8
|last= Shermer
|first= Michael
|authorlink= Michael Shermer
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Virtually all state societies and chiefdoms around the world have similar political structures where political authority is justified by divine sanction.
* Organized religion emerged as means of maintaining peace between unrelated individuals. Bands and tribes consist of small number of related individuals. However states and nations include thousands or millions of unrelated individuals. [[Jared Diamond]] argues that organized religion served to provide a bond between unrelated individuals who would otherwise be more prone to enmity. He argues that a leading cause of death among band and tribal societies is murder.&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;Compare: {{cite book|

==Axial age==
{{See also|Axial Age}}
Historians have labelled the period from 900 to 200 BCE as the "axial age", a term coined by [[Germany|German]]-Swiss [[philosopher]] [[Karl Jaspers]] (1883-1969). According to Jaspers, in this era of history "the [[spirituality|spiritual]] foundations of humanity were laid simultaneously and independently... And these are the foundations upon which humanity still subsists today." Intellectual historian [[Peter Watson (intellectual historian)|Peter Watson]] has summarized this period as the foundation time of many of humanity's most influential philosophical traditions, including [[monotheism]] in [[Persia]] and [[Canaan]], [[Platonism]] in Greece, [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] in India, and [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] in China. These ideas would become institutionalized in time - note for example [[Ashoka]]'s role in the spread of Buddhism, or the role of [[Neoplatonism and Christianity|platonic philosophy in Christianity]] at its foundation.

The historical roots of Jainism in India date back to the 9th-century BCE with the rise of [[Parshvanatha]] and his non-violent philosophy.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=30}}{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p= 182-183}}{{qn|date=July 2017}}

==Middle Ages==
[[File:Medieval-World-Religions.png|thumb|Medieval world religions]]
[[World religion]]s of the present day established themselves throughout [[Eurasia]] during the [[Middle Ages]] by:

* [[Christianization]] of the [[Western world]]
* [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|Buddhist missions to East Asia]]
* the [[decline of Buddhism in India|decline of Buddhism]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]]
* the [[spread of Islam]] throughout the [[Middle East]], [[Central Asia]], [[North Africa]] and parts of [[Europe]] and India

During the Middle Ages, [[Muslim]]s came into conflict with [[Zoroastrian]]s during the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] (633-654); [[Christian]]s fought against Muslims during the [[Byzantine-Arab Wars]] (7th to 11th centuries), the [[Crusades]] (1095 onward), the [[Reconquista]] (718-1492), the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]] (13th century onwards) and the [[Inquisition]]; [[Shamanism]] was in conflict with [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Taoism|Taoists]], Muslims and Christians during the [[Mongol invasions]] (1206-1337); and Muslims clashed with [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s during the [[Muslim conquests of the Indian subcontinent|Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent]] (8th to 16th centuries).

Many medieval religious movements emphasized [[mysticism]], such as the [[Cathars]] and related movements in the West, the Jews in Spain (see [[Zohar]]), the [[Bhakti movement]] in India and [[Sufism]] in Islam. [[Monotheism]] reached definite forms in Christian [[Christology]] and in Islamic [[Tawhid]]. [[Hindu views on monotheism|Hindu monotheist]] notions of [[Brahman]] likewise reached their classical form with the teaching of [[Adi Shankara]] (788-820).

==Modern period==
European [[colonisation]] during the 15th to 19th centuries resulted in the spread of Christianity in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and to the [[Americas]], [[Australia]] and the [[Philippines]]. The invention of the [[printing press]] in the 15th century played a major role in the rapid spread of the [[Protestant Reformation]] under leaders such as [[Martin Luther]] (1483-1546) and [[John Calvin]] (1509-1564).  Wars of religion broke out, culminating in the [[Thirty Years War]] which ravaged central Europe between 1618 and 1648. The 18th century saw the beginning of [[secularisation]] in Europe, gaining momentum after the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 and following. By the late 20th century religion had declined in most of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics Worldwide|last=Norris|first=Pippa|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, the regimes of [[Communist Eastern Europe]] and of [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]] were anti-religious. A great variety of [[new religious movements]] originated in the 20th century, many proposing [[syncretism]] of elements of established religions. Adherence to such new movements is limited, however, remaining below 2% worldwide in the period 2000-2009. Adherents of the classical world religions account for more than 75% of the world's population, while adherence to indigenous [[tribal religion]]s has fallen to 4%. {{As of|2005}}, an estimated 14% of the world's population identifies as [[nonreligious]].{{Fact|date=November 2018}}

By 2001 people began to use the internet to discover or adhere to their religious beliefs. In January 2000 the website [[beliefnet]] was established, and the following year, every month it had over 1.7 million visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zabriskie, Phil|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010608152025/http://www.time.com:80/time/interactive/religion/god_np.html|title=I Once Was Lost, but Now I'm Wired |publisher=''[[Time Asia]]''|date=2001-06-04|volume=157|issue=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Iain M Hambling}}

'''Iain M Hambling''' is the historian and archivist of English pottery company T G Green &amp; Co Ltd (1864 – 2007) which was based at [[Church Gresley]], Derbyshire.

Starting as a collector of [[Cornishware]] in 1991, his collection grew and was largely featured in [[Paul Atterbury]]'s first Cornish Ware &amp; Domestic Pottery book.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;Cornish Ware: Kitchen &amp; Domestic Pottery {{ISBN|0 903685 48 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First discussing [[Cornishware]] on the BBC's ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'' (series 19, 1996–7), he went on to make another two appearances with other T G Green patterns and later a half-hour programme on Channel 4, ''[[Collectors' Lot]]''.

There was an active Collectors Club between 1996 and 2001, for which Hambling wrote and advised in 'Iain's Corner'. The club folded upon the acquisition of T G Green by neighbouring company [[Mason Cash]].

Increasingly aware of the many other unrecorded patterns dating from 1864, Hambling started to build collections of the patterns and created a virtual online museum. A second book, concentrating on the many other domestic wares produced, followed in 2001.&lt;ref name="book2"&gt;Cornish Ware | Atterbury | Paul | 2001 | Cornish Ware &amp; domestic pottery by T.G. Green of Church Gresley, Derbyshire | Richard Denis | {{ISBN|0 903685 83 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hambling continued to piece together collections of patterns, concentrating initially on the Art Deco sets of the 1930s and later the Victorian sets from the company's inception as well as purchasing a lot of the original paperwork, tools and moulds which had been slowly lifted from the now-derelict factory site at [[Church Gresley]] by treasure hunters and opportunists.

Through the means of Facebook, Hambling set up a dedicated page to the pottery's history and founded a Collectors Group with over 1000 members.

Since 2016 there has been a privately run museum within the [[Swadlincote]] area displaying a majority of the patterns produced from the family owned period of 1864 to 1974 and the items from the original 'Cornish Ware Museum' run by the late Derek Green from his business in Hartley Wintney, returning the permanent display back to its original area of manufacture which will extend publicly in 2018.

The '''Iran–PJAK conflict''', or '''Iran–Kurdistan Free Life Party conflict''' is an armed conflict between the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] and the Kurdish guerrilla group [[Kurdistan Free Life Party]] (PJAK), which began in 2004 and largely ended in 2011. The group was carrying out attacks in the [[Kurdistan Province (Iran)|Kurdistan Province]] of [[Iran]] and other Kurdish-inhabited areas. PJAK is suspected to be closely affiliated with the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict|operating against Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/story/2007/05/070530_mf_clash.shtml |title=BBCPersian.com |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following massive clashes in summer 2011, a cease-fire was declared between the parties, with Iran claiming victory and PJAK allegedly ending all armed operations as of 29 September 2011. Since then, several violent incidents have occurred, including the [[December 2011 Baneh clash|Baneh clash]] in December 2011 and another clash in April 2012. In 2013, confrontations renewed, including clashes in May 2013, [[August 2013 Sardasht clash|August battle]] in [[Sardasht, West Azerbaijan|Sardasht]] border area and more events in October. Heavy [[2016 West Iran clashes|clashes]] took place on 19 April 2016, possibly indicating a new phase in the conflict.

In line with the Turkish PKK's goals, PJAK leaders say their long-term goals are to establish an autonomous Kurdish region within the Iranian state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/12/AR2007091202720_pf.html |title=Shelling Near Iranian Border Is Forcing Iraqi Kurds to Flee - washingtonpost.com |work=The Washington Post |date=12 September 2007 |accessdate=2008-11-10 |first=Joshua |last=Partlow}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mainly focused on replacing Iran's [[theocracy]] with a democratic and federal government, where self-rule is granted to all ethnic minorities of Iran, including [[Sunni]] [[Arabs]], [[Azeris]], and [[Kurds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2370030 |title=Iran's Kurdish Threat: PJAK |publisher=Jamestown Foundation |date=15 June 2006 |work=Terrorism Monitor |volume=4 |issue=12 |accessdate=2008-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011060500/http://jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2370030 |archivedate=October 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|1979 Kurdish rebellion in Iran|KDPI insurgency (1990s)}}
Since the Iranian Revolution, there has been an ongoing conflict between Iran's central government and Kurdish political movements rooted in the predominantly Kurdish region of western Iran.&lt;ref name=hicks2000&gt;Hicks, Neil. ''The human rights of Kurds in the Islamic Republic of Iran'', April 2000. {{cite web |url=http://www1.american.edu/cgp/pdf/hicks.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807060312/http://www1.american.edu/cgp/pdf/hicks.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of violence has ebbed and flowed with peaks of [[1979 Kurdish rebellion in Iran|serious conflict in 1979]], the early eighties and the [[KDPI insurgency (1990s)|early nineties]].&lt;ref name=hicks2000/&gt;

Kurdish casualties are estimated by the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran (KDPI) at more than 30,000 civilian dead in addition to 4,000 Kurdish fighters.&lt;ref name=hicks2000 /&gt; Along with the dead, there have been tens of thousands of people imprisoned; hundreds of villages destroyed and hundreds of thousands of people displaced.&lt;ref name=hicks2000 /&gt; The local economy of an already under-developed region has been severely damaged by the conflict, as of course has the Iranian economy as a whole.&lt;ref name=hicks2000 /&gt;

===Founding of PJAK===
[[File:PJAK fighters.jpg|260px|thumb|PJAK fighters in 2012 (VoA image)|left]]
The exact history of PJAK is widely disputed.&lt;ref name=jamestown/&gt; Turkey and Iran claim that PJAK is no more than an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).&lt;ref name=jamestown/&gt; According to some sources, members of the PKK founded the PJAK in 2004 as an Iranian equivalent to their leftist-nationalist insurgency against the Turkish government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/security/international_security/news/jir/jir060628_1_n.shtml |title=The militant Kurds of Iran - Jane's Security News |publisher=Janes.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010194856/http://www.janes.com/security/international_security/news/jir/jir060628_1_n.shtml |archivedate=October 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to founding members of PJAK, however, the group began in Iran around 1997 as an entirely peaceful student-based human rights movement.&lt;ref name=jamestown /&gt; The group was inspired by the success of Iraq's Kurdish autonomous region and by the PKK's struggle in Turkey.&lt;ref name=jamestown /&gt; Discouraged by the failure of previous Kurdish revolts, however, PJAK's leaders initially worked only to maintain and build a Kurdish national identity and to thwart the Iranian government's attempts to re-brand Iranian Kurds as ethnic Persians or Aryans.&lt;ref name=jamestown /&gt; After a series of government crackdowns against Kurdish activists and intellectuals, the group's leadership moved to the safety of Iraqi Kurdistan in 1999.&lt;ref name=jamestown /&gt; There they settled in the area controlled by the PKK on the slopes of Mount Qandil—less than {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip}} from the Iranian border.&lt;ref name=jamestown /&gt; Once established at Qandil and operating under the PKK's security umbrella, PJAK adopted many of the political ideas and military strategies of jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, whose theories had initially inspired PJAK's founders while still in Iran.&lt;ref name=jamestown /&gt; The PKK's ideological influence also transformed PJAK from a civil rights movement to a more ambitious and multi-directional independence movement, aided by the transfer of many seasoned PKK fighters of Iranian origin into PJAK.&lt;ref name=jamestown /&gt;

===Abductions of Iranian security forces===
PJAK's leaders have twice kidnapped groups of Iranian soldiers in 2003 and 2004.&lt;ref name=jamestown /&gt; In both instances Iranian soldiers were released unharmed after being tried and acquitted for crimes against the Kurdish people by ad hoc PJAK courts in Iranian Kurdistan.&lt;ref name=jamestown /&gt;

==Timeline==

===2004===
The PJAK group's first armed attack took place in 2004 in the Meriwan region of Iranian Kurdistan, after Iranian security forces fired on a Kurdish demonstration killing 10 people.&lt;ref name=jamestown /&gt;

===2005===
In July 2005, massive three-week long Kurdish riots in North-West Iran, met by massive security response, left some 20 Kurds dead and 300 wounded.&lt;ref name=theguardian2005&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/aug/05/iran.michaelhoward]&lt;/ref&gt; The protests erupted following the killing of a Kurdish activist by Iranian security forces in the city of Mahabad on July 9.&lt;ref name=theguardian2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gunter&gt;Gunter, M.M. ''The Kurds Ascending: The Evolving Solution to the Kurdish Problem in Iraq'', p. 134. Springer. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; More riots followed in October 2005.&lt;ref name=gunter /&gt;

According to Kurdish sources, as many as 100,000 state security forces backed by helicopter gunships, moved into the region to crack down on demonstrations.&lt;ref name=theguardian2005/&gt; The [[Kurdistan Democratic party of Iran]] urged "international organisations, human-rights supporters and the international community to make efforts to stop the bloodshed of the Iranian Kurdish people by the Islamic republic regime of Iran".&lt;ref name=theguardian2005 /&gt; Hussein Yazdanpanah, the general secretary of the [[Kurdistan Freedom Party|Revolutionary Union of Kurdistan]], who was at the time in exile in the city of Irbil, also criticized the crackdown.&lt;ref name=theguardian2005 /&gt; That year, the PJAK began widescale engagements with Iranian security forces in the Meriwan region.&lt;ref name=gunter /&gt;

[[Istanbul]]'s [[Cihan News Agency]] claimed that over 100 members of the Iranian security forces were killed by PJAK during 2005.&lt;ref name="zaman"&gt;[http://www.zaman.com/?bl=hotnews&amp;alt=&amp;trh=20060410&amp;hn=31854 Iran Arrests 7 PKK Terrorists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605055133/http://www.zaman.com/?bl=hotnews&amp;alt=&amp;trh=20060410&amp;hn=31854 |date=2011-06-05}}, April 10, 2006, Cihan News Agency/zaman.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006===
In February 2006, 10 Kurdish demonstrators were killed by police in the city of Maku.&lt;ref name=jamestown /&gt; PJAK responded with three attacks against two Iranian bases.&lt;ref name=jamestown/&gt; PJAK killed 24 members of Iranian security forces on April 3, 2006 in a [[April 2006 Iran–Iraq cross-border raids|raid]], performed in retaliation for the killing of 10 Kurds demonstrating in [[Maku, Iran|Maku]] by Iranian security forces.&lt;ref name="washingtontimesgrowing"&gt;[http://washingtontimes.com/world/20060403-125601-8453r.htm Tehran faces growing Kurdish opposition], James Brandon, ''The [[Washington Times]]'', April 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On April 10, 2006, seven PJAK members were arrested in Iran, on suspicion that they killed three Iranian security force personnel. Shortly afterward, on April 21, and again a week later, Iranian troops fired nearly 100 artillery shells at PJAK positions near Mount Qandil and briefly crossed the Iraqi border, according to the Iraqi Ministry of Defense.&lt;ref name=jamestown /&gt; The Iranian attack is believed to have killed no more than 10 PJAK fighters.&lt;ref name=jamestown /&gt;

PJAK set off a bomb on 8 May 2006 in [[Kermanshah]], wounding five people at a government building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janes.com/security/international_security/news/jir/jir060628_1_n.shtml The militant Kurds of Iran - Jane's Security News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211001040/http://www.janes.com/security/international_security/news/jir/jir060628_1_n.shtml |date=December 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since those events, the [[US]] [[news channel]] [[MSNBC]] claimed that the [[Iranian military]] begun bombardments of Kurdish villages in US-occupied Iraq along the Iranian border while claiming that their primary targets were PJAK militants. A number of civilians died.&lt;ref name="msn1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20759540/site/newsweek/page/2/ |title=Trouble on the Iran-Iraq Border - Newsweek: World News - MSNBC.com |publisher=Msnbc.msn.com |date=September 13, 2007 |accessdate=2008-11-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; PJAK troops killed four Iranian soldiers on May 27, in a clash near the town of Mako in Iranian Kurdistan, the PKK's Roj TV reported.&lt;ref name=jamestown/&gt;

On September 5, 2006 it was reported that Iranian forces [[September 2006 Sardasht incident|engaged]] PJAK near Sardasht, killing more than 30 and injuring 40 Kurdish militants.&lt;ref name=bbc0509/&gt;

On September 28, 2006, Iran said that two members of the PKK (which Iran regularly confuses with the closely affiliated PJAK) blew up a gas pipeline to Turkey near the town of [[Bazargan, Piranshahr|Bazargan]] in West Azerbaijan province.&lt;ref name="jamestown1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2370269 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070625152714/http://www.jamestown.org/terrorism/news/article.php?articleid=2370269 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-06-25 |title=PJAK Claims Fresh Attacks in Iran |publisher=Jamestown.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007===
On February 24, 2007 an Iranian helicopter crashed near the town of [[Khoy]], killing 13 soldiers, including several members of the elite Revolutionary Guards and Said Qahari, the head of the Iranian army's 3rd Corps. PJAK quickly claimed to have shot down the helicopter using a shoulder-launched missile, killing 20 soldiers, including several senior officers, during an hour-long battle. Iran, however, blamed the crash on bad weather. After that, Iran launched a [[2007 West Azerbaijan clashes|counter-offensive]] against the group in the northeast of Iran's [[West Azerbaijan province]], near the Turkish border.

We do not wish to fight against the Islamic Republic of Iran either. Why? Because one of the aims of the international forces who seek to re-design the region is to besiege Iran. Currently, they are more preoccupied with Syria. If they just manage to work things out there as they wish, it will be Iran's turn next. As Kurds, we do not think it quite right to be involved in a war with Iran at such a stage. You have no interest in targeting the PKK. ... You must end this conflict. It is America that wants this conflict to go on. Because these attacks of yours serve America's interests.

On Saturday, January 4, Iranian security forces shot and killed a 26-year-old Kurdish man by the name of Saman Khzri in the town of Sardasht in unclear circumstances.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;[http://www.ekurd.net/mismas/articles/misc2014/1/irankurd1034.htm Iranian Kurdistan News in brief] "On Saturday, January 4, Iranian security forces shot and killed a 26-year-old Kurdish man by the name of Saman Khzri in the town of Sardasht." Ekurd.net.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Iranian forces claimed to clash PJAK militants and killing at least 2 of them.&lt;ref name="presstv.ir"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/06/23/368236/iran-forces-kill-pjak-terrorists-cmdr/|title=Iran forces kill PJAK terrorists: Cmdr.|publisher=Press TV|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015===
In February 2015, Iran executed a Kurdish citizen accused of being a member of the armed wing of PJAK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20150220-iran-kurd-saman-naseem-minor-execution-fidh-children-rights/|title=Iran executes young Iranian Kurd despite global outcry|publisher=France 24|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The execution was performed despite a global effort to prevent it, as the executed Saman Naseem, was arrested at the age of 17.

On 20 May 2015, PJAK guerrillas killed a single IRGC soldier in the village of Hencîran, Merîwan area, after the Iranian army launched a counter insurgency operation.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kurdischenachrichten.com/2015/05/pjak-einheiten-toeten-einen-iranischen-soldaten/|title=PJAK-Einheiten töten einen iranischen Soldaten|work=Kurdische Nachrichten|author=|date=23 May 2015|accessdate=29 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151216161638/http://kurdischenachrichten.com/2015/05/pjak-einheiten-toeten-einen-iranischen-soldaten/|archive-date=2015-12-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, PJAK claimed killing 33 Iranian soldiers in two separate incidents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/mideast/2015/08/07/pjak-strikes-iranian-military-guard-post-kills-20|title=PJAK strikes Iranian military guard post, kills 20|date=7 August 2015|work=DailySabah}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Iran confirming only five casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Iran/Iranian-Kurdish-Party-says-killed-12-Revolutionary-Guards-in-attack-412067|title=Iranian Kurdish Party says killed 12 Revolutionary Guards in attack|work=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also Iran killed 4 YRK member and arrested one of them.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Warfare tactics==
PJAK has adopted [[hit-and-run tactics|hit-and-run assault tactics]] against Iranian forces, carrying them out with small arms and grenades.&lt;ref name=jamestown/&gt; Afterward, PJAK fighters may either melt back into Iranian society or re-cross the border into Iraqi Kurdistan.&lt;ref name=jamestown/&gt; PJAK is believed to have some heavier weaponry in its Mount Qandil camp such as RPGs and heavy machine-guns.&lt;ref name=jamestown/&gt;

==Foreign involvement==
=== Iranian and Turkish authorities allegations ===
Iran has accused the PJAK group of operating as a [[Proxy war|proxy]] of hostile foreign intelligence services, namely the intelligence services of the United States, as well as those operated by Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="CTCS"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Chris|last=Zambelis|title=The Factors Behind Rebellion in Iranian Kurdistan|url=https://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/the-factors-behind-rebellion-in-iranian-kurdistan|journal=CTC Sentinel|publisher=[[Combating Terrorism Center]]|date=1 March 2011|volume=4|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Turkish authorities have made allegations on links between PJAK and the United States.&lt;ref name="USAK"&gt;İhsan Bal, M. Turgut Demirtepe. "USAK Yearbook of Politics and International Relations". Vol. 5. [[International Strategic Research Organization]] (USAK). 2012. p. 43. {{ISBN|6054030698}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Umit Yardim, Turkish Ambassador to Iran stated in 2012 that Israel channels its aid and logistical support for PJAK through [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://english2.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=9102110142|title=Envoy: Israel Supporting PJAK, PKK through Southern Cyprus|publisher=[[Fars News Agency]]|id=9102110142|date=1 May 2012|access-date=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turkey]] has had cooperations with Iran to fight PKK and PJAK through ''Iran–Turkey High Security Commission''.&lt;ref name="Turkey"/&gt;

According to the [[Jamestown Foundation]]'s July 2006 Terrorism Monitor, PJAK's military operations are believed to be funded by Kurdish immigrant communities in Europe and Kurdish businessmen in Iran.&lt;ref name=jamestown/&gt;

===Israeli involvement===
Israel's relations with [[Kurdish people|Kurds]] is traced back to the implementation of its "[[alliance of the periphery]]".&lt;ref name="CTCS"/&gt; It is commented that Israel and the Iranian Kurdish insurgent organizations have a common interest in weakening the [[Government of Islamic Republic of Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-politics-kurds-idUSKCN11A0BD|title=To Iranian eyes, Kurdish unrest spells Saudi incitement|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=4 September 2016|access-date=29 September 2016|author=Babak Dehghanpisheh|editor=William Maclean and Toby Chopra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel and the Kurds: Love by Proxy|work=[[The National Interest]]|author=Ofra Bengio|date=18 March 2016|access-date=24 September 2016|url=http://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/03/18/israel-and-the-kurds-love-by-proxy/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', supported foreign involvement, stating that the [[US military]] and the [[Israel]]is are giving the group equipment, training, and targeting information in order to cause destruction in Iran.&lt;ref name="hersh_next_act"&gt;{{cite news|first=Seymour M.|last=Hersh|pages=|title=The Next Act|date=November 20, 2006|work=[[The New Yorker]]|url=http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/061127fa_fact|accessdate=2006-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "security source in [[Baghdad]]" has told Georges Malbrunot of ''[[Le Figaro]]'' in 2012 that [[Mossad]] agents are actively recruiting Iranian Kurds in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] and training them in spy-craft and sabotage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L'Iran défie l'Amérique|url=http://lefigaro.fr/international/2012/01/09/01003-20120109ARTFIG00640-l-iran-defie-l-amerique.php|newspaper=[[Le Figaro]]|language=French|date=9 January 2012|access-date=24 September 2016|author=Georges Malbrunot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, "a government consultant with ties to [[United States Department of Defense|the Pentagon]]" has confirmed that Israel has provided PJAK with "equipment and training" to carry out attacks against targets within Iran, according to [[Institute for Policy Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dreams and Dilemmas of Iraqi Kurdistan|url=http://fpif.org/the_dreams_and_dilemmas_of_iraqi_kurdistan/|work=[[Foreign Policy In Focus]]|date=24 January 2013|access-date=24 September 2016|author=Giorgio Cafiero}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. and Israeli involvement is also acknowledged by several scholars, including Nader Entessar of [[University of South Alabama]],&lt;ref name="Kurdish Politics in Regional Context"&gt;Entessar, Nader. "Kurdish Politics in Regional Context". In ''Kurdish Politics in the Middle East''.

According to a piece published by [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences]], "thanks to [[WikiLeaks]], it also now documented fact that Israel has long since attempted to use Kurdish groups such as PJAK... against Iran."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Eric|last=Draitser|title=Breaking the Resistance with Terrorism and Proxy Wars|url=http://journal-neo.org/2015/03/17/breaking-the-resistance-with-terrorism-and-proxy-wars/|journal=New Eastern Outlook|publisher=[[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences]] |date=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a book published by [[Routledge]] in 2016, co-authors [[Robert Scheer]] and [[Reese Erlich]] write "[T]he Israelis are also helping train PJAK for its armed forays into Iran. But given the sentiment among Arabs and Muslims, the [[Israeli government]] tries to keep its activities quite".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Iran Agenda: The Real Story of U.S. Policy and the Middle East Crisis|author=Reese Erlich, Robert Scheer|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317257375|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phyllis Bennis]] also cites Israeli support.&lt;ref name="OBP"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ending the Iraq War: A Primer|author=Phyllis Bennis|year=2009|publisher=Olive Branch Press|isbn=1566567173|page=168|quote=PJAK is made up of Iranian Kurds whose members attack Iran rather than Turkey, but who are also based in the Kurdish region of Iraq. Israel supports PJAK's anti-Iran mobilization. The complication is that the US supports PJAK attacks in Iran, even while it condemns identical PKK attacks on Turkey.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States relations with PJAK===
{{see also|Iran Freedom and Support Act}}
{{wikinews|Kucinich asks Bush about alleged US support for armed insurgency in Iran}}
Despite condemning PKK attack against Turkey,&lt;ref name="OBP" /&gt; the US government is said to be supporting PJAK.&lt;ref name="hersh_next_act" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OBP" /&gt;

In early 2006, US Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] sought US$75 million in extra to fund "anti-government propaganda and opposition groups inside Iran".&lt;ref name="Turkey" /&gt;

On April 18, 2006, [[US Congress]]man [[Dennis Kucinich]] sent a letter to [[US president]] [[George W. Bush]] in which he expressed his judgment that the US is likely to be supporting and coordinating PJAK, since PJAK operates and is based in Iraqi territory, which is under the control of the U.S. supported [[Kurdistan Regional Government]].&lt;ref name="kucinich"&gt;[http://kucinich.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=42505 Kucinich Questions The President On US Trained Insurgents In Iran: Sends Letter To President Bush] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525160327/http://www.kucinich.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=42505 |date=2006-05-25}}, [[Dennis Kucinich]], April 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In an April 2009 interview with Turkish daily ''[[Akşam]]'', former Chair of the [[President's Intelligence Advisory Board]] (2001–2005) [[Brent Scowcroft]] admitted that the United States "supported and encouraged" PJAK against Iran during [[Presidency of George W. Bush]] but [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] has ended this policy.&lt;ref name="USAK"/&gt;

On 4 February 2009, [[United States Department of the Treasury]] designated PJAK as a [[terrorist organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN04297671 |title=U.S. brands anti-Iran Kurdish group terrorist|date=4 February 2009|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PJAK statements ===
In an interview with [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'' magazine]] in June 2006, PJAK spokesman Ihsan Warya was paraphrased as stating that he "nevertheless points out that PJAK really does wish it were an agent of the United States, and that [PJAK is] disappointed that [[Government of the US|Washington]] hasn't made contact." The Slate article continues stating that the PJAK wishes to be supported by and work with the United States in overthrowing the [[government of Iran]] in a similar way to the US eventually cooperated with Kurdish organisations in Iraq in overthrowing the [[government of Iraq]] during the most recent [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref name="slate_pjak"&gt;{{cite news|first=Graeme|last=Wood|pages=|title=Iran Bombs Iraq: Meet the Kurdish guerrillas who want to topple the Tehran regime|date=June 12, 2006|publisher=Microsoft|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2143492/?nav=fo|accessdate=2006-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the top officials in the PKK made a statement in late 2006, that "If the US is interested in PJAK, then it has to be interested in the PKK as well" referring to the alliance between the two groups and their memberships in the Kurdistan Democratic Confederation (KCK).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=77119 |title=PKK commander says Washington 'has contact' with Kurdish rebels fighting Iran |work=Daily Star |date= |accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, [[Haji Ahmadi]], the leader of PJAK visited [[Washington, DC]] in order to seek more open support from the US both politically and militarily,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/article/20070804/FOREIGN/108040031/1003 |title=Kurdish leader seeks U.S. help to topple regime |work=The Washington Times |date=4 August 2007 |accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was later said that he only made limited contacts with officials in Washington.&lt;ref name="msn1" /&gt; Biryar Gabar, a PJAK commander from [[Sanandaj]] told ''[[Newsweek]]'' that Haji Ahmadi's meeting was with the "high-level officials" and they have discussed "future of Iran". Washington has downplayed the event.&lt;ref name="Kurdish Politics in Regional Context" /&gt;

==Casualties==

'''Janko Prunk''' ({{Audio|Sl-Janko Prunk.oga|pronunciation}}) (born 30 December 1942) is a [[Slovenia]]n historian of [[modern history]]. He has published articles and monographs on analytical politology, modern history, the genesis of modern political formations, and the history of social and [[political philosophy]] in Slovenia. He has also written on the history of [[political movement]]s in Europe from the end of the 18th century until today, especially about Slovene [[Christian socialism]] and the history of Slovenian national questions.

== Biography ==
Prunk was born in the small settlement of [[Loka pri Zidanem Mostu]] (part of the municipality of [[Sevnica]]), in central Slovenia, which was then the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-occupied [[Styria (Slovenia)|Slovenian Styria]].

Prunk started going to primary school in his birthplace. After fourth grade, he shifted to the school in nearby [[Radeče]]. He continued his secondary education at [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in [[Celje]]. Graduating from history and sociology at the [[University of Ljubljana]] in 1966. He was recruited into [[Yugoslav People's Army]] in [[Sisak]], [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]] in the years 1966/67. He obtained his master's degree from University of Ljubljana in 1972. In 1976, he obtained his PhD with a thesis on Slovenian [[Christian Socialist]] movement 1918-1941, which was still a controversial topic at that time. Prunk was awarded scholarships by the [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation]]. He worked as a researcher and visiting professor at the [[University of Freiburg]] in 1984/1985 and 1994/1995, and in 1988/1989 at the [[University of Cologne]].

From 1966 to 1995, he worked at the Institute for modern history in Ljubljana. Until his retirement in 2013 he worked as professor at the Faculty of [[Social Sciences]] of the University of Ljubljana.

Prunk is a member of [[Leibniz Institute of European History]] in [[Mainz]], and a senior member of the [[Center for European Integration Studies]] in [[Bonn]].

== Politics ==
Prunk has been actively involved in politics. As an early admirer of [[Jože Pučnik]], Prunk joined the [[Democratic Opposition of Slovenia]] after the democratization of Slovenia. He was an active member of the [[Slovenian Democratic Party]] (known as Slovenian Social Democratic Party between 1989 and 2003). Between 1992 and 1993, Prunk served as Minister for ''Slovenes outside Slovenia and National Minorities in Slovenia'' in the first coalition cabinet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vlada.si/en/about_the_government/governments_of_the_republic_of_slovenia/government_of_the_republic_of_slovenia_1992_1993/|title=Government of the Republic of Slovenia from 1992-1993|publisher=[[Government of Slovenia]]|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Janez Drnovšek]].

After 1994, Prunk withdrew from politics for over a decade. Before the [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 2004|parliamentary elections of 2004]], he campaigned for the Slovenian Democratic Party. In 2005, he was appointed by the Foreign Minister [[Dimitrij Rupel]], as president of the Slovene-Croatian Historical Commission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mzz.gov.si/en/newsroom/news/archive/2005/12/browse/1/select/sporocilo_za_javnost/article/141/8487/|title=The session of Slovenian-Croatian historical commission|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Slovenia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]|date=1 December 2005|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed by the Government of the two countries, to shed light on the history of the relations between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnevnik.si/novice/slovenija/154377|title=Slovensko-hrvaška zgodovinska komisija: Odnosi predvsem dobri|publisher=[[Dnevnik (Ljubljana)|Dnevnik Newspaper]]|date=2 December 2005|language=Slovenian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2004 and 2008, he served as chairman of the Slovenian Democratic Party's internal Committee for Education Policies. He resigned in 2008 because of disagreements over the Government's policy favoring [[Private university|private universities]]. After the split with the party, he became very critical of the then Prime Minister [[Janez Janša]], whom he accused of being a "liberal with an authoritative touch, who aspires at becoming a Slovenian [[Józef Piłsudski|Piłsudski]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Janko Prunk|title=Janez Janša in njegova stranka po štirih letih na oblasti: L'État, c'est moi!|publisher=[[Delo|Delo Newspaper]]|date=16 September 2008|language=Slovenian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Slovenian parliamentary elections, 2008|parliamentary elections of 2008]], Prunk explained his disappointment with the Slovenian Democratic Party as a consequence of its [[neo-liberal]] turn. In Prunk's opinion, the party turned its back to the ideals of [[welfare state]] held by its founding father [[Jože Pučnik]].&lt;ref name=Dnevnik_1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnevnik.si/novice/slovenija/1042232576|title=Janševa garnitura je lahko zadovoljna, da je izgubila|publisher=[[Dnevnik (Ljubljana)|Dnevnik Newspaper]]|date=27 December 2008|language=Slovenian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prunk also criticised the [[charisma]]tic type of leadership of the party's president Janez Janša, stating that the party would most probably collapse if Janša resigned.&lt;ref name=Dnevnik_1/&gt;

'''John Rice Irwin''' (born December 11, 1930) is an American cultural historian, and founder of the [[Museum of Appalachia]] in [[Norris, Tennessee]].

Rice was born in [[Union County, Tennessee]], but while still an infant his family moved twice, and would eventually permanently reside on a farm near [[Norris, Tennessee]]. He served in the [[US Army]] infantry in the early 1940s, and later would complete his [[bachelor's degree]] at [[Lincoln Memorial University]]. He also earned his master's degree at the [[University of Tennessee]]. He married Elizabeth McDaniel in 1954, and the couple subsequently had two children. His wife died in 2008. He currently lives at Meadowview Senior Living Center. He became the youngest superintendent of schools in Tennessee in the early 1960s.

His interest in history began at an early age, and was inspired by his grandparents to start a museum. He founded the Museum of Appalachia in 1968, and has since grown significantly in both its size and number of visitors. He has been awarded several accolades and awards, and has eight different published books (seven of which are nationally and internationally distributed).

==Biography==
[[File:General-bunch-house-tn1.jpg|thumb|The General Bunch house, which was originally located in the New River area of Anderson County, was the first log cabin to be acquired by Irwin, reconstructed, and put on display at the site that was to become the Museum of Appalachia.&lt;ref name=Elizabethobit/&gt;]]
John Rice Irwin was born on December 11, 1930 in [[Union County, Tennessee]]. While he was an infant, Irwin and his family were forced to move because their land would be appropriated and flooded for the [[Norris Dam]]. After settling on another farm near [[Clinton, Tennessee]], they were again forced to move for the development of [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], in the early 1940s. They finally moved to a farm near [[Norris, Tennessee]], where he would stay until he was 18. There, Irwin and his brother were taught how to [[Agriculture|farm]], [[hunting|hunt]], [[fishing|fish]], and [[Animal trapping|trap animals]].&lt;ref name="The Norris Bulletin"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Happy 80th Birthday, John Rice Irwin!|journal=The Norris Bulletin|date=December 8, 2010|volume=64|issue=49|pages=1, 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1940s, Irwin served in the US Army infantry.&lt;ref name="The Norris Bulletin"/&gt; He completed his [[bachelor's degree]] at [[Lincoln Memorial University]] with majors in history and economics.&lt;ref name="The Norris Bulletin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.lmunet.edu/archivesspecial-collections/lmu-literary-hall-of-fame |title=LMU Literary Hall of Fame |publisher=Carnegie-Vincent Library, Lincoln Memorial University |date= |accessdate=December 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610112205/http://library.lmunet.edu/archivesspecial-collections/lmu-literary-hall-of-fame |archivedate=June 10, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his master's degree in international law at the [[University of Tennessee]].

In an interview on August 28, 2009, Irwin stated: 

{{quote|I'll still be around. After all, I live at the museum. My daily habits and my total life of the last 40 to 50 years have been devoted to preserving the history of our people's struggle in Appalachia. So, if you say to me that I'm retiring, well, that's what I do every night. ... I just go to sleep at my home at the museum. As in the past, I will be playing music and entertaining guests from all over the country, indeed, the world, who visit the museum. Please don't think I am going to disappear.

==Museum of Appalachia==
[[Image:Museumofappalachia-sign2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sign at entrance of Museum of Appalachia]]
Irwin's interest in human history was provoked by his grandparents' stories. His grandfather once advised him, "You ought to keep these old-timey things that belonged to our people and start you a little museum sometime." Eventually in the 1960s he took that advice to heart. At a public [[auction]] in the early 1960s, he realized that the sales transactions were separating the artifacts of the past from the stories that his grandparents told.&lt;ref name="The Norris Bulletin"/&gt;&lt;ref name=newroleRidger/&gt; A person attending the sale told him that he was going to make a [[coffee table]] from the old [[spinning wheel]] he had just purchased. Irwin said of this conversation, "I just plain hated the idea of that object being hauled to Terre Haute or Dayton and made into a table completely removed from the context of the region, and from the people who made it and used it."&lt;ref&gt;Bob Frost, [http://www.thehistorychannelclub.com/articles/articletype/articleview/articleid/361/the-genius-of-appalachia The ‘Genius’ of Appalachia], The History Channel Club, accessed December 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, he spent $4 at the auction to buy an old [[farrier|horse shoeing]] box that had been found in the [[Clinch River]] in the aftermath of the deadly Big Barren Creek Flood of 1916. In later years, he said that he bought it not for its value as an [[antique]], but for the history it embodied. His collection grew from that beginning, as he began to travel around the countryside to find and "save the past" in the form of artifacts.&lt;ref name="The Norris Bulletin"/&gt;&lt;ref name=newroleRidger/&gt;

In 1968, Irwin founded the [[Museum of Appalachia]] to house and display his growing collection.&lt;ref name=newroleRidger/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumofappalachia.org/Museum_of_Appalachia_History.htm |title=Museum of Appalachian History |publisher=Museumofappalachia.org |date= |accessdate=December 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218172546/http://www.museumofappalachia.org/Museum_of_Appalachia_History.htm |archivedate=December 18, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2009/aug/29/irwin-retiring-after-40-years/ |title=Irwin, founder of Museum of Appalachia, retiring after 40 years " Knoxville News Sentinel |publisher=Knoxnews.com |date= |accessdate=December 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bcbrown.net/bluegrass/chronicles/articles/mofa/ |title=Page 1 |publisher=Bcbrown.net |date= |accessdate=December 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1980, the museum had grown so large that Irwin left his position as director of the Tennessee Appalachia Education Cooperative to devote all of his time to the museum.&lt;ref name="The Norris Bulletin"/&gt;

Although the museum started as only a small log building, as of 2010, it has grown to a village-farm complex, comprehending more than 35 original mountain structures, two large display buildings containing thousands of Appalachian artifacts, farm animals, and several gardens. The museum was converted to a non-profit organization in 2003 and in May 2007, the museum announced its formal association with the Smithsonian Institution's Affiliations Program.&lt;ref name="The Norris Bulletin"/&gt;

==Legacy and accolades==
John Rice Irwin is generally known as the founder of the Museum of Appalachia. He is also the author of seven nationally and internationally distributed books. He has lectured on the subject on Appalachian history throughout the eastern United States. In 1989, Irwin was one of 29 [[MacArthur Fellows Program]], which provides "extraordinary talented individuals." He was honored by the [[East Tennessee Historical Society]] in 1992 as one of nine East Tennesseans "whose accomplishments have distinguished them far beyond East Tennessee," and in 1993, he was awarded a Doctorate of Humane Letters from Cumberland College. In 1994, he was inducted into the Junior Achievement of East Tennessee's Business Hall of Fame. Six years later in 2000, he was the recipient of the annual Outstanding Educational Service to Appalachia Award. He is the 2008 recipient of the Trailblazer Award, and in 2009 was named the Anderson Country Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="The Norris Bulletin"/&gt;

Although Vázquez says she originally wanted to be a scientist, her father influenced her love of history.  She was also inspired by historian [[Edmundo O'Gorman]] and his teachings on the roles of history and historians.&lt;ref name=paul /&gt;

In 1958, Vázquez was awarded a [[Ph.D.]] in American history form the [[Central University of Madrid]].  She received a degree in history from [[Harvard University]] in 1962, and a Ph.D. in history from UNAM in 1968.&lt;ref name=paul /&gt;

She has also written several official history textbooks used in schools throughout the country.&lt;ref name=beezley253 /&gt;

Vázquez has served as a historical adviser to numerous documentaries, including one produced by [[KERA-TV]].&lt;ref name=beezley253 /&gt;&lt;ref name=vanwagenen223&gt;Van Wagenen, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Josecadalso.jpg|thumb|right|José Cadalso]]
'''José de Cadalso y Vázquez''' ([[Cádiz]], 1741 – [[Gibraltar]], 1782), [[Spain|Spanish]], Colonel of the Royal Spanish Army, author, poet, playwright and essayist, one of the canonical producers of [[Spanish Enlightenment literature]]. 

Before completing his twentieth year, Cadalso had traveled through [[Italy]], Germany, England, France and [[Portugal]], and he had studied the history and literature of these countries. On his return to [[Spain]] he entered the army and rose to the rank of colonel.

Cadalso was the embodiment of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideal of the "hombre de bien", a learned and well-rounded citizen whose multitude of interests could be utilized to improve society.  He was a central figure in the literary landscape of eighteenth-century Spain, especially in the [[tertulia]] held at the Fonda de San Sebastián.  He influenced a number of Spanish authors, not least among them a young and talented [[Juan Meléndez Valdés]].

His first published work was a verse tragedy, ''Don Sancho García, Conde de Castilla'' (1771). In  1772, he published his ''Los Eruditos a la Violeta'', a commercially successful prose satire on the obsession with superficial knowledge and the appearance of erudition. In 1773 appeared a volume of miscellaneous poems, ''Ocios de mi juventud''.

Cadalso is best known for his ''Cartas marruecas'', an epistolary novel published posthumously by the "Correo de Madrid" in 1789 and as a book in 1793.  The ''Cartas marruecas'' have often been compared to [[Montesquieu]]'s, (1689–1755), own ''Lettres Persanes'', ([[Persian Letters]], 1721),  although in reality both works represented the period's fascination with epistolary narrative.  ''Cartas Marruecas'' and ''Noches lúgubres'' are often considered his best works, although they are stylistically and thematically different.

Whereas ''Cartas marruecas'' is a rational, multi-perspectivistic examination of Spanish society through the eyes of a young Moroccan, ''Noches lúgubres'' (“Lugubrious Nights”),  is a short prose work centered on a mourning protagonist's desire to disinter his dead lover, and was published from 1789 to 1790 in the journal ''El correo de Madrid''. The later work was inspired by the death of his close friend, holding amorously her dying body, actress [[María Ignacia Ibáñez]], (1745 – April 1771, aged 26).

This work, along with a number of Cadalso's anguished lyrical compositions, are considered an antecedent of [[Romanticism]] in Spain, if not fully Romantic in their own right. A good edition of his works appeared at [[Madrid]], in 3 vols., 1823. This is supplemented by the ''Obras inéditas'' (Paris, 1894) published by R. Foulch-Delbosc.

Cadalso was killed at the [[History of Gibraltar#Until the Peninsular Wars|Great Siege of Gibraltar]], on 27 February 1782, just 15 days after being promoted to Colonel. He has a tomb in [[Santa María La Coronada Church|Saint Mary the Crowned Church]] in [[San Roque, Cádiz|San Roque]].&lt;ref name=mary&gt;{{cite web|title=Saint Mary the Crowned Parish Church Saint Mary the Crowned Parish Church|url=http://www.sanroque.es/tourism/monuments/iglesia-santa-maria-la-coronada/view?set_language=en|publisher=sanroque.es|accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kippur''''' (כיפור) is a 2000 [[Israel]]i drama [[war film]] directed by [[Amos Gitai]]. The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by Gitai and Marie-Jose Sanselme; based on Gitai's own experiences as a member of a helicopter rescue crew during the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]]. The film stars actors Liron Levo, Tomer Russo and Uri Klauzner in principal roles.

A joint collective effort to commit to the film's production was made by [[Canal+]] and Agav Hafakot studios. It was commercially distributed by [[Kino International (company)|Kino International]] theatrically, and by Kino Video for home media. Following its cinematic release, the film was entered into the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]] among other awards selections.&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/5157/year/2000.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Kippur |accessdate=2009-10-10|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kippur'' explores war, politics, and human rescue.

''Kippur'' premiered in theaters nationwide in Israel on October 5, 2000. The film was screened through limited release in the United States on November 3, 2000 grossing $114,283 in domestic ticket receipts. In the U.S., ''Kippur'' was at its widest release showing in 5 theaters nationwide. It was generally met with positive critical reviews before its initial screening in cinemas.

==Plot==
It is October 6, 1973, and [[Egypt]] along with [[Syria]] have continued their undeclared war on Israel by launching attacks in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and [[Golan Heights]]. Weinraub (Liron Levo) and his friend Ruso (Tomer Ruso) are Israeli citizens who are called up through a [[Conscription in Israel|military draft]] to fight in the surprise conflict. The two make their way to the Golan Heights to locate their reserve unit which they served under during their military training. However, during the chaotic circumstances, they never find it, and end up sleeping by the side of the road.

The next morning, they are awakened by Dr. Klauzner (Uri Klauzner), who asks for a ride to [[Ramat David]] where he serves on the [[Ramat David Airbase|air force base]] there. After transporting Dr. Klauzner to the base, Weinraub and Ruso agree to volunteer with a first-aid rescue team. Their ongoing mission involves evacuating dead and wounded soldiers from the battlefield. Later on October 10, their helicopter crew is deployed to Syria for a [[covert operation]]. During their mission, the helicopter is struck by a missile, killing one of the co-pilots and injuring everyone on board. Weinraub and Ruso are among those who survive, and are picked by another rescue helicopter. They become patients at a field hospital, thus ending their role in the war.

===Development===

The premise of ''Kippur'' is based on the true story of the [[Yom Kippur War]], as told by the personal account of Israeli army reservists. On October 6, 1973, the Egyptian army launched a large scale offensive against Israeli positions in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] which was followed by a second attack by Syria from the [[Golan Heights]] in the north.&lt;ref name=GlobalS&gt;{{cite web | title=The 1973 Arab-Israeli War: Arab Policies, Strategies, and Campaigns | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1997/Jordan.htm | author=[[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] Major Michael C. Jordan | publisher=GlobalSecurity.org | year=1997 | accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the sudden defeats and considerable loss of life that occurred at the beginning of the conflict handed down a terrible psychological blow to Israelis. Previously, the Israeli military believed it was invulnerable in the region.&lt;ref name=rab497-498&gt;Rabinovich, 497–498&lt;/ref&gt; On April 11, 1974, prime minister [[Golda Meir]] resigned with her cabinet followed suit, including chief of staff [[Moshe Dayan]]. [[Yitzhak Rabin]], who had spent most of the war as an advisor to Elazar in an unofficial capacity,&lt;ref&gt;Rabinovich, 237&lt;/ref&gt; became head of the new government, which was seated in June. The [[Israeli National Security Council]] was created to improve coordination between the different [[Israeli Security Forces|security]] and [[Israeli Intelligence Community|intelligence]] bodies, and the political branch of government.

The emotional impact on the individual Israeli soldiers is expanded upon in the film.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;[[Amos Gitai|Gitai, Amos]] (Director). (2000). ''Kippur'' [Motion picture]. Israel: [[Kino International (company)|Kino International]].&lt;/ref&gt; The complete transformation from a quiet civilian life to a chaotic war scene is depicted in the storyline. The Israeli soldiers cope with assisting dead and seriously wounded troops, while taking enemy fire.&lt;ref name=film /&gt;

===Filming===
[[File:Ein Fiq, Golan Heights - 20040223-03.jpg|thumb|right|Golan Heights where the story took place]]
The film is largely autobiographical, based on Gitai's own experiences as a member of a helicopter rescue crew during the war.&lt;ref name=Annex&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmannex.com/movie/film/10638/kippur |title=Independent Films, Film Profiles Kippur |publisher=Film Annex |accessdate=2010-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130122231343/http://www.filmannex.com/movie/film/10638/kippur |archivedate=2013-01-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schwarz" /&gt; Scenes were shot with the assistance of the Israeli Defense Forces which provided much of the military equipment used in the film. Most of the characters are named after the actors who play them, with the exception of the title character, who is given only the last name Weinraub, which was Amos Gitai's family name until his father changed it to the Hebrew name Gitai.&lt;ref name=Annex /&gt;

The helicopter crash that ends the film actually happened.  Gitai's helicopter was shot down by a Syrian missile on his 23rd birthday. The co-pilot was killed and several others wounded.  Gitai reportedly considered it the pivotal moment of his life.&lt;ref name=Annex /&gt;

===Music===
The [[Film score|score]] for the film was originally composed by musician [[Jan Garbarek]].&lt;ref name="Yah"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1804019061/cast |title=Kippur (2000) |accessdate=2010-10-17 |publisher=Yahoo!

Kevin Thomas, writing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said, ''Kippur'' was a "classic war film, at once elegiac and immediate, that takes you smack into the chaos of combat yet is marked by a detached perspective."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Kevin (November 2000). Kippur. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Retrieved 2010-10-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa Schwarzbaum in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' offered a mostly positive review commenting, "Amos Gitai's intense, autobiographically based drama is set during Israel's 1973 Yom Kippur War, but current Middle East tensions add urgency to this stark study in the unglorious matter of factness of battle." She expressed satisfaction by saying, "this sobering antiwar war movie is his rueful acknowledgment of those who fight with no Godot in sight."&lt;ref name="schwarz"&gt;Schwarzbaum, Lisa (November 10, 2000).

In ''[[The Village Voice]]'', critic J. Hoberman reserved compliment for the lead acting and directing saying, "Gitai's strategy encourages the viewer to ponder the logistics of war—as well as those of filming war." He noted though, that the "ensemble acting sometimes falters, and due to Gitai's camera placement, it can be difficult to distinguish between the various characters—although Klauzner establishes an indelible identity in a brief moment of downtime when he discusses his childhood in Europe during World War II."&lt;ref name="hoberman" /&gt;

[[A.O. Scott]] writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' came to believe, "The relentless attention to the sheer awfulness of war, which is the film's great strength, is also something of a shortcoming. Mr. Gitai reproduces the numb horror of wading through fields of gore almost too well: the self-protective response is to shut down your emotions, as the characters do. ''Kippur'' immerses you in violence and agony, but it may leave you with a curious feeling of detachment."&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;Scott, A.O. (October 5, 2000).

Long, numbing scenes of soldiers rushing through the war zone with the wounded and returning for more are accompanied by an overwhelming soundtrack of tanks, helicopters and explosions." He also reserved praise for director Gitai, saying he "captures a chaotic portrait of the war with no glory, only the confusion, fear, and fatigue of a tour under fire."&lt;ref&gt;Axmaker, Sean (January 26, 2001).

David Sterritt of ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' bluntly referred to the film as "Both a blood-churning war movie and a mind-stirring antiwar movie, focusing not on guts and glory but on the stark realities of real battlefield experience."&lt;ref&gt;Sterrit, David (November 2000).

From 1996 he was a Research Associate at the House of Bavarian History and completed his [[Habilitation]]  in 1997 at the [[University of Hamburg]]: ''Arbeiter und Arbeiterbewegung in der Hansestadt Hamburg in den Jahren 1929&amp;ndash;1939: Werftarbeiter, Hafenarbeiter und Seeleute; Konformität, Opposition, Widerstand.''  From 1998 to 2003 he was project leader in the revision of the exhibition at the [[Dachau Concentration Camp]].  In addition, he served as Associate Professor of Modern and Contemporary History at the Faculty of Philology and History from 2000 at [[University of Augsburg]].  In 2004 he took over the management of the House of Bavarian History project.

From 2005, he prepared the national exhibition  in [[Zwiesel]] for 2007.

The '''Lupemban''' is the name given by [[archaeologist]]s to a central [[Africa]]n [[archaeological culture|culture]] which, though once thought to date between c. 30,000 and 12,000 BC, is now generally recognised to be far older (dates of c. 300,000 have been obtained from Twin Rivers, [[Zambia]] and Muguruk, [[Kenya]], respectively). The industry is characterised by the occurrence of bi-facially flaked [[lanceolate]] points. It has been postulated that Lupemban tools, being generally distributed within the modern day [[Congo Basin|Congo]] forest belt, may have been adapted to woodworking. The lanceolate points are commonly interpreted as being the surviving elements of composite spears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com.kh/books?id=QYGwagdt9MQC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq=Lupemban+culture&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cREr2Ux_Jf&amp;sig=7_mWCfmO4V-EOPaIQoNrqom0cvA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE_LXMyczRAhVTNpQKHX35Bdc4ChDoAQg6MAY#v=onepage&amp;q=Lupemban%20culture&amp;f=false |title=Kalambo Falls Prehistoric Site: Volume 3, The Earlier Cultures: Middle and ... - J.

'''Marin Barleti''' ({{lang-la|Marinus Barletius}}, {{lang-it|Marino Barlezio}}; c. 1450–60 – c. 1512–13) was a [[historian]] and [[Catholic]] priest from [[Shkodra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Setton|first=Kenneth M.|title=The papacy and the Levant (1204-1571).|year=1978|publisher=Amer.philos.soc.|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-87169-127-9|page=73|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Sz2VYI0l1IC&amp;pg=PA73|edition=null|quote= ...perhaps of Italian origin.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered the first Albanian historian because of his 1504 [[The Siege of Shkodra (book)|eyewitness account]] of the 1478 [[siege of Shkodra]]. Barleti is better known for his second work, a biography on [[Skanderbeg]], translated into many languages in the 16th to the 20th centuries. Scholars variously assert that he was Italian ([[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|DuCange]], [[Nicolae Iorga|Iorga]]), Dalmatian ([[Paolo Giovio|Giovio]], [[David Czwittinger|Czwittinger]], [[Johann Albert Fabricius|Fabricius]]), or Albanian ([[Apostolo Zeno|Zeno]], [[Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer|Fallmerayer]], [[Konstantin Jireček|Jireček]]).&lt;ref name="pall"&gt;{{citation | author=Francesco Pall | title=Marino Barlezio: uno storico umanista | year=1938 | url=http://asa.archiviostudiadriatici.it/islandora/object/libria:193039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Barleti was born and raised in Scutari (modern [[Shkodra|Shkodra, Albania]]), then part of the [[Republic of Venice]]. Scholars variously assert that he was Italian ([[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|DuCange]], [[Nicolae Iorga|Iorga]]), Dalmatian ([[Paolo Giovio|Giovio]], [[David Czwittinger|Czwittinger]], [[Johann Albert Fabricius|Fabricius]]), or Albanian ([[Apostolo Zeno|Zeno]], [[Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer|Fallmerayer]], [[Konstantin Jireček|Jireček]]).&lt;ref name="pall" /&gt; His name may be related to the Apulian city of [[Barletta]]. In 1474, the [[Ottoman Empire]] besieged Shkodra and Barleti participated in the successful defense of the town, both in the first siege in 1474 and [[Siege of Shkodra (1478)|the second in 1478]]. When Venice ceded Shkodra to the Ottomans in 1479, Barleti escaped to [[Italy]] where he would become a scholar of history, classical literature and the Latin language.

Soon after Barleti arrived in Venice, he was given a stall at the [[Rialto]] meat market as a temporary means of financial aid. In 1494 became a priest after his theological studies in Venice and Padova, and soon was appointed to serve at St. Stephen's Church in [[Piovene Rocchette|Piovene]].

==Works==

[[File:Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum (color).jpg|thumb|right|A page from ''Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum principis'']]

=== The Siege of Shkodra ===
Barleti's first work was ''[[The Siege of Shkodra (book)|The Siege of Shkodra]]'' ({{lang-la|De obsidione Scodrensi}}, Venice, 1504). It was published several times in Latin and translated into Italian, Polish, French, Albanian, and English. Barleti wrote this work as an eyewitness. Of this work, acclaimed Albanian author [[Ismail Kadare]] wrote that "if one were to search for a literary creation wholly worthy of the expression 'monumental work,' it would be hard to find a better example than ''The Siege of Shkodra''."&lt;ref&gt;Kadare, Ismail in Marin Barleti (ed. David Hosaflook), ''The Siege of Shkodra: Albania's Courageous Stand Against Ottoman Conquest, 1478''. Tirana: Onufri, 2012. p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The History of Scanderbeg ===
Barleti's second and largest work was ''The History of Scanderbeg'', fully entitled ''About the excellent Prince of the Epirots, George Castrioti's, life, character and deeds, especially against the Turks. Because of his famous exploits he was surnamed Scanderbeg, that is, Alexander the Great. Thirteen books by Marin Barleti of Shkodra'' ({{lang-la|De Vita Moribus Ac Rebus Praecipue Aduersus Turcas, Gestis, Georgii Castrioti, Clarissimi Epirotarum Principis, qui propter celeberrima facinora, Scanderbegus, hoc est, Alexander Magnus, cognominatus fuit, libri Tredecim, per Marinum Barletium Scodrensem conscripti}}). It was first published in Rome between 1508 and 1510 (2nd ed.: Strasbourg, 1537; 3rd ed.: Frankfurt am Main, 1578; 4th ed.: Zagreb, 1743) and translated into German (1533), Italian (1554), Portuguese (1567), Polish (1569), French (1576), Spanish (1588), and English (1596). Unlike ''The Siege of Shkodra'', Barleti relied on the testimonies of others to produce this work.

''The History of Scanderbeg'' is considered an Albanian cultural treasure, vital to the formation of Albanian national self-consciousness. The [[Serbian language]] version is the major part and the first manuscript of the [[Cetinje chronicle]]. A note at the end of this manuscript says that the author of the text is "Marin from [[Shkodër]] of Slavic origin".

[[Paolo Giovio]] was the first historian to confound Barletius with another contemporary ''Marinus Scodrensis'', [[Marino Becichemi]] (1468-1526), professor of rhetorics and author of commentaries on classic literature. The confusion has been elucidated by [[Thomas Reinesius]] and [[Apostolo Zeno]]. While Barletius in his works calls himself "sacerdotis Scodrensis" (priest of Scodra), Becichemi professes himself married and a "father of boys", professor of Ragusa, Brescia, and Padua, neither of which applies to Barletius.

=== A Brief History of Lives of Popes and Emperors (disputed) ===
Barleti's third work is titled, ''A Brief History of Lives of Popes and Emperors'' ({{lang-la|Compendium vitarum pontificum et imperatorum}}, Venice, 1555).

==Criticism==
[[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall]], [[Johann Wilhelm Zinkeisen]], [[Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer]], [[Georg Voigt]], [[Nicolae Iorga]], [[Karl Hopf]], [[Vikentij Makušev]], [[Jovan Radonić]], [[Konstantin Jireček]] and others considered Barletius a fantastic writer, not a true historian. Although his biography abounds with exaggerations, chronological errors, imaginary descriptions, forged letters and invented speeches, it has considerable historical value.

Barletius' work has inspired chroniclers like [[Giammaria Biemmi]] and [[Theodore Spandounes]]. It is still popular among romanticist and nationalist historians. Modern historical research on Skenderbeg relies more on archival records than on Barletius.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Jeton Omari | title=Scanderbeg tra storia e storiografia | year=2014 | url=http://tesi.cab.unipd.it/47254/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials==
The main public library of Shkodra and a publishing house have been named after Marin Barleti. Also, a [[Marin Barleti University|university in Tirana, Albania]] has been established under his name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4427">'''Mark Stephen Monmonier''' (born 2 February 1943) is a Distinguished Professor of Geography at the [[Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs|Maxwell School]] of [[Syracuse University]]. He specializes in [[toponymy]], [[geography]], and [[geographic information systems]]. His popular written works show a combination of serious study and a sense of humor. Most of his work is published by University of Chicago Press. He has appeared on [[National Public Radio]] interview programs.

For example, in his work, ''From [[Squaw's Tit|Squaw Tit]] to Whorehouse Meadow: how maps name, claim, and inflame'', Monmonier discusses topics such as:
* the propensity of conquerors to rename places after those friendly to the new [[regime]].
* the tension between place names assigned by the federal [[Board on Geographic Names]] and state and local government agencies.
* the effects of [[political correctness]] and [[racism]] on place names.

In ''How to Lie with Maps,'' Monmonier gives us a different view of maps: different [[Map projection|projections]] give vastly different impressions of the same "facts" or terrain.

[[Image:Carrolup River Native Settlement.jpg|thumb|350px|Men at Carrolup River Native Settlement in 1951]]
'''Marribank''', also known as '''Carrolup''', was the site of one of two large camps for [[Indigenous Australians]] established by the office of the [[Protector of Aborigines]] of the [[Western Australia]]n State Government.&lt;ref name=SP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://signposts.cpfs.wa.gov.au/facilities/view.aspx?id=231|title=Marribank, Katanning|accessdate=4 October 2015|publisher=[[Government of Western Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area reclassified from a mission to native settlement in 1915 and was initially known as Carrolup&lt;ref name=SP/&gt; not far from the [[Western Australia]]n town of [[Katanning, Western Australia|Katanning]], after complaints by white farmers and settlers about the Aboriginal fringe dwellers living north of the town, who were attending school to the south. Together with settlements at [[Moore River Native Settlement|Moore River]], [[Roelands]] and [[Gnowangerup]], at one stage it formed part of a number of institutions that housed most of the [[Noongar]] people of the South West of Western Australia. The Carrolup facility was closed in 1922 with all residents transferred to the Moore River Settlement.&lt;ref name=SP/&gt;

The "Aboriginal Act" of 1909 denied the rights of parents and made all part-Aboriginal children wards of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Rutter, Florence | author2=Carrolup Native Settlement (W.A.) | title=Little black fingers : the story of Carrolup Native Settlement children, Western Australia | publication-date=1951 | publisher=s.n | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/12365215 | accessdate=3 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aboriginal children were taken from their parents, especially if they had a European or part-European ancestry, in order to break the possibility of being socialised within traditional Aboriginal language and culture, as a part of a government policy which has become known as the [[Stolen Generations]]. It was hoped by the Protector of Aborigines that boys would be trained as agricultural labourers, and girls would obtain work as domestic servants.  Children living at Carrolup of marriageable age had to obtain official government permission to marry. As the official policy was acknowledged as "smoothing the pillow of a dying race", the "breeding out" of Aboriginal racial characteristics was encouraged. The officials took little or no action in cases of sexual abuse of girls by those officially in charge of them.

The settlement was opened again in 1940 as a farm training school for Indigenous boys and in 1952 was handed over to the Baptist Church and was renamed as Marribank.&lt;ref name=SP/&gt;

In the 1950s, Marribank was the site of an Aboriginal Noongar Art movement amongst the children resident there,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Laurie, Victoria | title=The lost prodigies: [More than 50 years ago, Aboriginal children in WA produced art that stunned the world.

A number of prominent Western Australian Aboriginal Artists started their work at Marribank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Stanton, J. E. (John Edward) | author2=Stanton, J. E.

Today, Marribank houses a small museum and is administered under Aboriginal control.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7214">[[Language]] has a long evolutionary history and is closely related to the [[brain]], but what makes the [[human]] brain uniquely adapted to language is unclear. The regions of the brain that are involved in language in humans have similar analogues in apes and monkeys, and yet they do not use language. There may also be a [[gene]]tic component: mutations in the [[FOXP2]] gene prevent humans from constructing complete sentences.&lt;ref name=disorders&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marcus|first=G.|author2=Rabagliati, H.|title=What developmental disorders can tell us about the nature and origins of language|journal=Nature Neuroscience|year=2006|volume=9|pages=1226–1229|doi=10.1038/nn1766|url=http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v9/n10/full/nn1766.html|issue=10|pmid=17001342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neurobiological adaptations for language ==

=== Broca's and Wernicke's areas ===
{{Main|Broca's area|Wernicke's area}}
These regions are where language is located in the brain&amp;nbsp;– everything from [[speech]] to [[Reading (process)|reading]] and [[writing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoff|first=E|title=Language Development|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-0-495-50171-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language itself is based on symbols used to represent concepts in the world, and this system appears to be housed in these areas. The language regions in human brains highly resemble similar regions in other primates, even though humans are the only species that use language.&lt;ref name=coevolution&gt;{{cite web|last=Boulton|first=David|title=Terrence Deacon, Ph.D. - The Co-evolution of Language and the Brain|url=http://www.childrenofthecode.org/interviews/deacon.htm|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brain structures of chimps are very similar to those of humans. Both contain Broca's and Wernicke's [[Homology (biology)|homologues]] that are involved in communication. Broca's area is largely used for planning and producing vocalizations in both chimps and humans. Wernicke's area appears to be where linguistic representations and symbols are mapped to specific concepts. This functionality is present in both chimps and humans; the chimp Wernicke's area is much more similar to its human counterpart than is the Broca's area, suggesting that Wernicke's is more evolutionary ancient than Broca's.&lt;ref name=brocas /&gt;

=== Motor neurons ===
[[File:Sagittalmouth.png|thumb|300px|[[Sagittal plane|Sagittal section]] of human vocal tract]]
In order to speak, the breathing system must be voluntarily repurposed to produce vocal sounds,&lt;ref name=coevolution /&gt; which allows the breathing mechanisms to be temporarily deactivated in favor of [[song]] or speech production. The human [[vocal tract]] has evolved to be more suited to speaking, with a lower [[larynx]], 90° turn in the windpipe, and large, round tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Stephen|title=Doctor Dolittle's Delusion|year=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=London|isbn=0-300-10339-5|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Motor neurons]] in birds and humans bypass the unconscious systems in the brainstem to give direct control of the larynx to the brain.&lt;ref name=semanticurge /&gt;

== Theories of language origin ==

=== Gestural origin ===
The earliest language was strictly vocal; reading and writing came later.&lt;ref name=coevolution /&gt; New research suggests that the combination of [[gestures]] and vocalizations may have led to the development of more complicated language in protohumans. Chimps that produce attention-getting sounds show activation in areas of the brain that are highly similar to Broca's area in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arbib|first=M.|author2=Bota, M.|title=Language evolution: neural homologies and neuroimformatics|journal=Neural Networks|year=2003|volume=16|doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2003.08.002|pages=1237–1260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taglialatela|first=J. P.|author2=Russell, J. L. |author3=Schaeffer, J. A. |author4=Hopkins, W. D. |title=Chimpanzee Vocal Signaling Points to a Multimodal Origin of Human Language|journal=PLoS ONE|date=20 April 2011|volume=6|series=4|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0018852 |pages=e18852 |pmid=21533079 |pmc=3080370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even hand and mouth movements with no vocalizations cause very similar activation patterns in the Broca's area of both humans and monkeys.&lt;ref name=brocas&gt;{{cite web|last=Falk|first=D|title=The Evolution of Broca's Area|url=http://www.ibro.info/Pub/Pub_Main_Display.asp?LC_Docs_ID=3145}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; When monkeys view other monkeys gesturing, [[mirror neurons]] in the Broca's homologue activate. Groups of mirror neurons are specialized to respond only to one kind of viewed action, and it is currently believed that these may be an evolutionary origin to the neurons that are adapted for speech processing and production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fadiga|first=L|author2=Craighero, L. |author3=D'Ausilio, A |title=Broca's Area in Language, Action, and Music|journal=The Neurosciences and Music III—Disorders and Plasticity|year=2009|volume=1169|pages=448–458|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04582.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Universal grammar ===
The [[language bioprogram hypothesis]] proposes that humans have an innate, [[cognitive]] [[grammar|grammatical]] structure allowing them to develop and understand language. According to this theory, this system is embedded in human genetics and underpins the basic grammar of all languages.&lt;ref name=brocas /&gt; Some evidence suggests that at least some of our linguistic capacities may be genetically controlled. Mutations in the [[FOXP2]] gene prevent people from combining words and phrases into sentences.&lt;ref name=disorders /&gt; However, these genes are present in the heart, lungs, and brain, and their role is not entirely clear.&lt;ref name=disorders /&gt;

It is possible that the human capacity for grammar evolved from non-semantic behavior like singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deacon|first1=TW|title=Colloquium paper: a role for relaxed selection in the evolution of the language capacity|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=11 May 2010|volume=107 Suppl 2|pages=9000-6|doi=10.1073/pnas.0914624107|pmid=20445088|pmc=3024028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds have the ability to produce, process, and learn complex vocalizations, but the units of a birdsong, when removed from the larger meaning and context of the birdsong as a whole, have no inherent meaning. Early hominids may have evolved capacities for similar, non-semantic purposes, that were later modified for symbolic language.&lt;ref name=semanticurge&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sereno|first=M. I.|title=Language origins without the semantic urge|journal=Cognitive Science Online|year=2005|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–12|url=http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~sereno/papers/LangOrigins05.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[architecture]], the [[latin]] term '''''opus''''' ("work) is a word that generically indicates various techniques of constructing [[buildings]] that were in use in [[ancient Rome]]. Usually the word ''opus'' is not used alone in building descriptions, but is paired with specific attributes (''incertum'', ''latericium'', etc.), whose purpose is to show precisely the building technique that was used (i.e. ''[[opus incertum]]'', ''[[opus latericium]]'', ''[[opus reticulatum]]'', ''[[opus mixtum]]'', etcetera).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4681">An '''oral law''' is a [[code of conduct]] in use in a given [[culture]], [[religion]] or community application, by which a body of rules of human behaviour is transmitted by [[oral tradition]] and effectively respected, or the single rule that is orally transmitted.

Many cultures have an oral law, while most contemporary legal systems have a formal written organisation. The oral tradition (from the [[Latin]] ''tradere'' = to transmit) is the typical instrument of transmission of the oral codes or, in a more general sense, is the complex of what a culture transmits of itself among the generations, "from father to son". This kind of transmission can be due to lack of other means, such as in illiterate or criminal societies, or can be expressly required by the same law.

There has been a continuous debate over oral versus written transmission, with the focus on the perceived higher reliability of written evidence,&lt;ref&gt;Finnegan, 195-201&lt;/ref&gt; primarily based on the "linear world of academia" where only written down records are accepted. However, "standard" theories of orality and literacy have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Goody, pp.27-68&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oral law in jurisprudence ==
From a legal point of view, an oral law can be:
*a [[Habituation|habit]], or [[convention (norm)|custom]] with legal relevance or when the formal law expressly refers to it (but in this latter case, it is properly an indirect source of legal [[rights]] and [[Law of obligations|obligation]]s);
*a spoken command  or order that has to be respected as a [[law]] (in most modern western legal systems, some dispositions can be issued by word in given cases of emergency).
An oral law, intended as a body of rules, can be admitted in [[jurisprudence]] as long as it shows some efficacy, therefore it needs that the law is public, the human action is evaluated by a [[judge]] (ordinarily producing a [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] according to the general interpretation of the law) and then a [[punishment]] has eventually to be put into effect. Some oral laws provide all these elements (for instance, some codes of conduct in use among criminal associations like [[the Mafia]] do have a well known law, a judge, a condemnation), while others usually miss some of them.

== Oral law in Judaism ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Halakha]] --&gt;
{{main|Oral Torah}}

Although the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term "[[Torah]]" is often translated as "Law", it can just as accurately be translated as "Instruction" or "teaching".  [[Rabbinic Judaism]] maintains that the books of the [[Tanakh]] were transmitted in parallel with an oral tradition, as relayed by God to Moses and from him handed on to the scholarly and other religious leaders of each generation.  Thus, in Judaism, the "Written Instruction" (''Torah she-bi-khtav'' תורה שבכתב) comprises the Torah and the rest of the [[Tanakh]]; the "Oral Instruction" (''Torah she-be'al peh'' תורה שבעל פה) was ultimately recorded in the [[Talmud]] (lit. "Learning") and [[Midrash]]im (lit. "Interpretations").  The interpretation of the [[Oral Torah]] is thus considered as the authoritative reading of the [[Tanakh|Written Torah]]. Further, [[Halakha]] (lit. "The Path", frequently translated as "Jewish Law") is based on a "Written Instruction" together with an "Oral Instruction". Jewish law and tradition is thus not based on a literal reading of the Tanakh, but on the combined oral and written tradition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7653">'''Sango Ota''' (alternatively spelled '''Otta'''') is a town in [[Ogun State]], [[Nigeria]], and has an estimated 163,783 residents living in or around it Ota is the capital of the [[Ado-Odo/Ota]] [[Local Government Area]].  The traditional leader of Ota is the [[Olota of Ota]], Oba [[Alani Oyede]]. Historically, Ota is the capital of the [[Awori]] [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] ethnic group.&lt;ref name="P.C. Lloyd 1962 225"&gt;{{cite book |title=Yoruba Land Law |publisher= Oxford University Press | author= P.C. Lloyd |year= 1962|page= 225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1999, Ota has the third largest concentration of industries in Nigeria.&lt;ref name="Ruhollah Ajibola Salako 1999 15"&gt;{{cite book |title= Ota: The Biography of the Foremost Awori Town |publisher= Penink &amp; Co | author= Ruhollah Ajibola Salako|year= 1999|page= 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also possesses a large market and an important road junction, found just north  of the tollgate on the [[Lagos–Abeokuta Expressway]]. Ota is also well known as the home of former Nigerian president [[Olusegun Obasanjo]]'s farm, the [[Canaanland]] compound of the [[megachurch]] [[Winners' Chapel]], and the [[Africa Leadership Forum]].

==History==
Traditional [[Awori]] [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] folklore tells that [[Olofin]]'s children, Osolo and Eleidi Atalabi founded Ota after migrating south from [[Isheri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ota: The Biography of the Foremost Awori Town |publisher= Penink &amp; Co | author= Ruhollah Ajibola Salako|year= 1999|page= 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the town developed, it eventually came to be locally ruled by a crowned [[Oba (king)|oba]], called the [[Olota of Ota|Olota]], whose ruling privilege came from the Yoruba traditional home of [[Ile-Ife]]. Ota soon became important in the production and sale of [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kingdoms of the Yoruba |publisher= Methuen &amp; Co | author= Robert Smith|year= 1969|pages= 88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1842, the expansion of the [[Egba people|Egba]] nation brought Ota under the control of [[Abeokuta]], however Ota held a semi-independent status within the Egba kingdom, and remained the capital of the [[Awori]] people.&lt;ref name="P.C. Lloyd 1962 225"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kingdoms of the Yoruba |publisher= Methuen &amp; Co | author= Robert Smith |year= 1969|page= 166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early part of the 1900s, governance and administration of justice were kept by members of the [[Ogboni]] secret society, a traditional group that made and enforced the laws. In 1903, modern police crews were introduced, and had  almost completely supplanted the traditional enforcement roles of the Ogboni by the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Ruhollah Ajibola Salako 1999 23"&gt;{{cite book |title= Ota: The Biography of the Foremost Awori Town |publisher= Penink &amp; Co | author= Ruhollah Ajibola Salako|year= 1999|page= 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the introduction of a new Federal Government taxation system led to riots in Ota. On February 4, the new [[tax code]] was announced. The Aiyepeju Society and the Ota Tax Payers Association began protesting almost immediately. The protests turned violent as aggressive crowds began destroying property. The riots, which came to be known as the "Ponpo Aiyepeju", were eventually put down by the Nigerian police. In the aftermath of the disturbances, Oba Timothy Fadina was sent into exile on May 11, 1954.&lt;ref name="Ruhollah Ajibola Salako 1999 23"/&gt;

Ota began to grow into the industrial city it is today due to the [[economic development]] planning and [[lobbying]] by the [[Manufacturers Association of Nigeria]] and Chief [[Bisi Onabanjo]], former governor of Ogun State. This led to the official designation of Ota as an industrial town, and the state government began to encourage industries to locate in and around the city.&lt;ref name="Ruhollah Ajibola Salako 1999 15"/&gt;

==Education==
Traditionally, Ota only had a few [[Private school|schools]], and all were sponsored by various [[Christian]] religious organizations. The [[Muslim]] community responded by forming a school operated by the [[Ansar-Ud-Deen Society]]. [[State school]]s began to be formed in the late 1970s, and there are now several private schools in the area. [[Iganmode Grammar School]] is the oldest, founded in 1960. Other notable schools include Ansar-Ud-deen Comprehensive College, [[Bells Comprehensive Secondary School]] and [[Faith Academy Secondary School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ota: The Biography of the Foremost Awori Town |publisher= Penink &amp; Co | author= Ruhollah Ajibola Salako|year= 1999|pages= 16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also two universities in Ota: [[Covenant University]] and [[Bells University of Technology]].And a private polytechnic:Allover central polytechnic.

The [[Nigerian Navy]]'s School of Music is also located in Ota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ota: The Biography of the Foremost Awori Town |publisher= Penink &amp; Co | author= Ruhollah Ajibola Salako|year= 1999|page= 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Sections of the town are dominated by industries including Lagos - Abeokuta rd and Idi-Oroko rd. Beginning in the early 1970s, many businesses began building factories in Ota partly because it was less congested than the industrial estates in Lagos. Businesses with facilities in Ota include:
* Farmex Meyer Limited &lt;ref&gt;[http://farmexmeyer.com/contact.html Farmex Meyer Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nigerian Breweries]] 
* De United Foods Industries Limited&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dufil.com/contact.html De United Foods Industries Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unique Pharmaceuticals &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniquepharm.com/contact_us.html Unique Pharmaceuticals Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Intercontinental Distillers Limited.
* Honda Manufacturing (Nigeria),Ltd&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.honda-nig.com/contact-us/ Honda Manufacturing Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Demographics ==
The indigines are predominantly [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] of the [[Awori]] [[dialect]] group. They trace their ancestry down from [[Ile-Ife]] and consider [[Iganmode]] as their patriarch. Other Aworis are located in the neighbouring [[Lagos State]].

The main occupation of Ota residents is trading and farming. The town's proximity to Lagos and proximity to the border town of [[Idiroko]] have led to the creation of two large markets: [[Kayero Market]] in Sango and [[Oba T.T. Dada Market]] along [[Idiroko Road]]. These markets are each so large that they blend together and are more commonly just referred to as Sango-Ota Market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ota: The Biography of the Foremost Awori Town |publisher= Penink &amp; Co | author= Ruhollah Ajibola Salako|year= 1999|page= 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict between Awori and Owu residents==
There have been several confrontations between [[Owu]] and Awori residents of the area. In April, 2008, violent clashes left at least six people dead when Awori and Owu fought over the Olowu of Owu's installation of an [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]] in Awori land. The governor of Ogun State, [[Gbenga Daniel]], declared a dusk-to-dawn [[curfew]] in the [[Ado-Odo/Ota]] Ota [[local government area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200804090294.html|title=Bloody Clash in Ota|publisher=Leadership Newspaper / AllAfrica.com|accessdate=2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200804100277.html|title=Ota Crisis - Govt Imposes Curfew|publisher=This Day / AllAfrica.com|accessdate=2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally it is made of straw or similar material and it often has a trimming of flowers and ribbons. Some models may also feature a veil or draped fabric covering.&lt;ref name="Dictionary Brooks Picken"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooks Picken|first1=Mary|title=A Dictionary of Costume and Fashion: Historic and Modern|date=2010|publisher=Dover Publications|location=United States|isbn=0486402940|pages=165|edition=1999|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CbOI4TCcnbQC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;dq=mary+brooks+picken+%2B+mushroom+hat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=adtoisLpHA&amp;sig=jClnmxD0kdUnA2o22BwdvMRZAYU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fuLHVKrJAo3jaObbgPgF&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=mary%20brooks%20picken%20%2B%20mushroom%20hat&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced in around 1908 and caused some controversy over the succeeding year due to its extreme dimensions and decorations. It had revivals – designs were at this stage more modest – in the 1930s and 1950s.

==History of the design==
[[File:BlossomSeeleySmileWhiteHat.JPG|thumb|left|American singer [[Blossom Seeley]] in a peach basket style, 1912]]
The name peach basket hat became popularly used around 1908 in the United States. An advertisement in the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|Pittsburgh Gazette]]'' describes "the new Peach Basket Hats", also showing an illustration of a flower-decorated straw hat in the shape of a basket.&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Gazette 160409"&gt;{{cite news|title=All the new millinery! All the cleverest conceits! (advert)|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19090416&amp;id=oP0aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0EgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5339,3542307|accessdate=21 January 2015|publisher=Pittsburgh Gazette|date=16 April 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the term peach basket does not appear to have been used in the British fashion press, descriptions involving fruit baskets were. A 1908 comment piece in ''[[The Guardian]]'' by [[Evelyn Sharp (suffragist)|Evelyn Sharp]] described a variety of oversized designs, including one similar to [[Capotain|Roundhead headgear]], noting that they were: "hideously popular" and came trimmed with a variety of flower, fruit and bird motifs. Sharp added: "A basket of market produce pinned on the head would have much the same effect. For next to the difficulty of finding the head of the wearer underneath the hat of to-day comes the difficulty of finding hat shape under the trimming of to-day".&lt;ref name="The Guardian Sharp"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharp|first1=Evelyn|title=The Milliner's Market Garden|publisher=The Guardian|date=4 June 1908|ref=pg.14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1907 article in the American edition of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' had predicted that the future of hats was: "in size colossal" and, two years on, the magazine suggested that the growing popularity of photography had inspired many of these new millinery designs, as couturiers were exposed to images from other cultures and countries. The inspiration for the peach basket millinery design was said to be the oversized styles worn by women of the [[Belgian Congo|Congo]].&lt;ref name="As Seen in Vogue Delis Hill"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Delis Hill|first1=Daniel|title=As Seen in Vogue: A Century of American Fashion in Advertising|date=2004|publisher=Texas Tech University Press|location=Lubbock, Texas|isbn=0896726169|page=168|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MvilOZhaRkAC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;dq=peach+basket+%2B+millinery&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qzwa7UNo0U&amp;sig=bI2C3YSctQgHYwgsuThO7_li2l4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=H7m_VLmbL9Hmaq2xgbAB&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=peach%20basket%20%2B%20millinery&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy and ridicule===
[[File:KayLaurellHeadAndSholdersProfile.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Kay Laurell]] in an unusual high-crowned and fabric draped variation on the peach basket, c. 1910]]
Although the peach basket was launched as one of the 1908 season's new looks, it was not greeted with universal acclaim. The ''[[Los Angeles Herald]]'', reported in 1909 that the US National Association of Retail Milliners had: "launched the aeroplane as the new style of headgear, put a ban on the peach basket hat and decreed the three-cornered hat of the Louis XVI period as the stunning bonnet for the coming winter months".&lt;ref name="LA Herald 201209"&gt;{{cite news|title=Discard Peach Basket Hat for Aeroplane One|url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=LAH19091220.2.104|accessdate=21 January 2015|agency=California Digital Newspaper Collection|publisher=Los Angeles Herald|date=20 December 1909|ref=vol. 37, number 80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The milliners, who declared the peach basket (or fruit basket) dead, had suffered a poor season of sales. The association's president admitted: "The last season proved disastrous, short and unprofitable owing to the launching of extreme styles such as the fruit basket hat...a concerted effort has been made to tone down all attempts to introduce freak creations".&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune 020909"/&gt;

A further editorial in a New York newspaper said that husbands were partly responsible for the collapse in sales of the peach basket hat, with the manager of one [[Sea Cliff, New York|Sea Cliff]] store reporting: "I have had no end of husbands come to the shop this spring in company with their wives to pick out their hats to prevent them from investing in a peach basket, washbasin or inverted bowl shape. Never before has so much fun been poked at millinery as this season".&lt;ref name="NY Sun"&gt;{{cite news|title=New censors of Millinery|url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspapers%2021/Sea%20Cliff%20NY%20News/Sea%20Cliff%20NY%20News%20%201909-1911/Sea%20Cliff%20NY%20News%20%201909-1911%20-%200082.pdf|accessdate=21 January 2015|agency=Fulton History|publisher=Sea Cliff NY News (from NY Sun)|date=1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its favour, the peach basket was said to have saved a New York showgirl from disfigurement. Beginning: "Here's a kind word at last for the peach basket hat", an article in the ''Los Angeles Herald'' went on to describe how a car passenger thrown head first through a car windshield was saved because her substantial peach basket hat exited before her, thereby saving her from skinning her nose.&lt;ref name="LA Herald 180509"&gt;{{cite news|title=Peach basket hat saves pretty show girl's nose|url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=LAH19090518.2.122.8|accessdate=21 January 2015|agency=California Digital Newspaper Collection|publisher=Los Angeles Herald|date=18 May 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
In 1909, the short comedy film ''Flossie's New Peach Basket Hat'', produced by [[Sigmund Lubin]], was released.&lt;ref name=J-817&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to Motion Picture Catalogues: Series Two: Producers active after 1900|url=http://edison.rutgers.edu/mopix/rndetal2.htm|website=edison.rutgers.edu|publisher=Rutgers The Thomas Edison Papers|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="St John Sun, 1909"&gt;{{cite news|title=Amusements: Nickel's big weekend bill|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=38&amp;dat=19090723&amp;id=V5YjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=giYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2510,374037|accessdate=31 January 2015|publisher=The St John Sun|date=23 July 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMDB synopsis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Flossi's New Peach Basket Hat|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1778253/|website=imdb.com|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the song ''In a Peach Basket Hat Made for Two'' was composed by James M. Reilly and [[Henry W. Petrie]].&lt;ref name="US Copyright Office"&gt;{{cite book|title=Catalog of Copyright Entries: Musical compositions, Part 3|date=1937|publisher=Library of Congress US Copyright Office|location=United States|page=151|edition=Vol 32, no.1|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9UVjAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=In+a+Peach+Basket+hat+made+for+two&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hUUd2dVEIf&amp;sig=sgAEEwXPdyJloLcuK9NdrrEjq3U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l9fMVM2mA8K9UfP5gbgH&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20a%20Peach%20Basket%20hat%20made%20for%20two&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later revivals==
[[File:Mariondavies.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Marion Davies]] in a peach-basket style design, unknown date]]
The design had a brief revival in the 1930s, with a fashion commentator noting that: "as fetching a line as ever it was in pre-war days, the peach-basket hat returned this week to offer lively competition to the flat-crowned hats as spring's favorite millinery".&lt;ref name="Reading Eagle 310335"&gt;{{cite news|title=A fancy springtime chapeau lends to springtime smartness|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19350331&amp;id=XHAhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GYgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6163,6721501|accessdate=21 January 2015|publisher=Reading Eagle|date=31 March 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article went on to describe a modified design of rough purple straw with a band of [[grosgrain]] ribbon and a bouquet of violets, as well as a classic peach basket with a navy straw brim and a tall tapering crown of leghorn straw dressed with flowers and a short veil.&lt;ref name="Reading Eagle 310335"/&gt; It was also a design that featured in the mid 1950s, usually in a simplified form but sometimes the straw frame was draped with soft fabric.&lt;ref name="Dictionary Brooks Picken"/&gt;

Although the term – and the classic peach-basket design – have not been widely seen since the 1950s, [[Princess Maria Laura of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este|Princess Maria Laura of Belgium]] wore an organza hat described as a peach basket at the 2003 wedding of [[Prince Laurent of Belgium|Prince Laurent of Belgium and Claire Coombs]].&lt;ref name="Royal Hats 120403"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wedding Guest Hats, Ten Years Later|url=https://royalhats.wordpress.com/2013/04/12/wedding-guest-hats-ten-years-later/|website=royalhats.wordpress.com|publisher=Royal Hats|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Principled Distance''' is a new model of [[secularism]] given by [[Rajeev Bhargava]]. the separation of government institutions and persons [[Mandate (politics)|mandated]] to represent [[State (polity)|the state]] from [[Religious organization|religious institution]]s and [[Clergy|religious dignitaries]]. [[Rajeev Bhargava|He]] says that [[India]]n secularism did not erect a strict wall of separation, but proposed a 'principled distance' between religion and state.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opendemocracy.net/rajeev-bhargava/states-religious-diversity-and-crisis-of-secularism-0&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, by balancing the claims of individuals and religious communities, it never intended a bludgeoning privatization of religion. In India, secularism means equal treatment of all religions. Religion in India continues to assert its political authority in matters of personal law.&lt;ref&gt;http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/events/rethinking-secularism-refining-the-concepts-of-public-religions-principled-distance-and-the-twin-tolerations?q=Jos%C3%A9%20Casanova&lt;/ref&gt; The western model of secularism is criticized in India for being an outdated concept as Rajeev argued that since Western model was developed when society was more homogeneous but since in the era of globalization, society is becoming more heterogeneous therefore a new concept, suitable for the present situation, is needed. He even argued that since Europe itself is no more homogeneous hence West should also follow the principled distance model which on one hand respects the diversity and at the same time empowers the state to interfere in case of any discrimination in the name of religion.&lt;ref name="Rajeev"&gt;

The [[Haj subsidy]] is a subsidy given to [[Islam in India|Indian Muslim]] [[Hajj]] pilgrims by the Government of India.  The program has its origins in British colonial era. In post-colonial era, the [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] government expanded the program in 1959 with the Hajj Act.&lt;ref name=ha1959&gt;[http://indiankanoon.org/doc/102428/ The Haj Committee Act, 1959] Government of India&lt;/ref&gt; The subsidy and taxpayer funded arrangements initially applied to Muslim Indian pilgrims traveling for religious reasons to Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Jordan. Since 1973, pilgrims applying through the [[Haj Committee of India]] are offered a concessionary fare on [[Air India]].&lt;ref name=facts&gt;Press Information Bureau, [http://www.indianmuslims.info/book/export/html/14454 "Hajj operation in India 2006"], December 2006.

[[Central Wakf Council, India]]  is an [[India]]n [[statutory body]] established in 1964 by the [[Government of India]] under Wakf Act, 1954 (now a sub section the Wakf Act, 1995) for the purpose of advising it on matters pertaining to working of the State Wakf Boards and proper administration of the [[Wakf]]s in the country. Wakf is a permanent dedication of movable or immovable properties for  religious, pious or charitable purposes as recognized by [[Muslim Law]], given by [[philanthropist]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7611">The '''Seleucid era''' or '''''Anno Graecorum''''' (literally "year of the Greeks" or "Greek year"), sometimes denoted "AG", was a [[Calendar era|system of numbering years]] in use by the [[Seleucid Empire]] and other countries among the ancient [[Hellenistic civilization]]s. It is sometimes referred to as "the dominion of the Seleucidæ," or the Year of Alexander. The era dates from [[Seleucus I Nicator]]'s re-conquest of [[Babylon]] in 312/11 BC after his exile in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;Denis C. Feeney, ''Caesar's Calendar'', University of California Press, Berkeley 2007, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; considered by Seleucus and his court to mark the founding of the Seleucid Empire. According to Jewish tradition, it was during the sixth year of [[Alexander the Great]]'s reign (lege: possibly Alexander the Great's infant son, Alexander IV of Macedon) that they began to make use of this counting.&lt;!--NB: There is a proclivity among many untrained scholars to bypass Jewish sources. Even the renowned "Encyclopaedia Judaica", s.v. Alexander the Great, puts his lifespan from 356–323 BCE (i.e. 33 years), which if he reigned only 12 years and 7 months (based on Heckel and Yardley, "Alexander the Great," pp. 279-80, who quote from Diodorus Siculus) brings us to 336 BCE when he began to reign, and 323 BCE when he died (11 years before the start of the Seleucid era!), whereas in Jewish tradition his reign began in 318 BCE, and the Seleucid era commencing six years after his reign (312 BCE). You see, the modern dating system does not reflect the Jewish tradition. This enigma can be explained in Jewish tradition as simply being that many of the old dates used by western scholarship are purely anachronistic. According to Denis Feeney, author of "Caesar's Calendar" (pp. 12, 171) it took many hundreds of years for scholars to arrive at the dates that we now hold to be accurate. For example, in Grafton's book on "Scaliger," he shows how long it took for Roman consular dates (and archon dates, etc.) to be converted into BC/AD. Even so, all the ancient dating systems had to be aligned and converted into the modern system, but were not always easily translatable. In this regard, when we compare these old calendar systems with Jewish tradition, it is evident that the work is not yet completed, as there are still disparities between the two systems, the modern and the old. Even if we were to say that the reference in rabbinic literature refers merely to Alexander the Great's infant son, Alexander IV, there is still no rabbinic source to support such a claim.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud (Avodah Zarah 10a), Rabbeinu Hananel's Commentary; RASHI's commentary on Babylonian Talmud (Avodah Zarah 9a); Sefer Hakabbalah of Rabbi Avraham ben David (Ravad); Midrash David on Mishnah Tractate Avot (Ethics of the Fathers, 1:6)&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the new era is mentioned in one of the [[Babylonian Chronicles]], ''the Chronicle of the Diadochi''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/bchp-diadochi/diadochi_03.html Babylonian Diadochi Chronicle (''BCHP'') 3]; obverse, line 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two different uses were made of the Seleucid years:
# The natives of the empire used the [[Babylonian calendar]], in which the new year falls on 1 Nisanu (3 April in 311 BC), so in this system year 1 of the Seleucid era corresponds roughly to April 311 BC to March 310 BC. This included the Jews, who call it the ''Era of Contracts''. It is used in the Jewish historical book, now "[[Deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]]", [[1 Maccabees]], in 6:20, 7:1, 9:3, 10:1, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of the Jewish People in the Time of Jesus Christ | author=Emil Schürer | year=1890| publisher=T&amp;T Clark | pages=36–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The [[Macedon]]ian court adopted the Babylonian calendar (substituting the [[Ancient Macedonian calendar|Macedonian month names]]) but reckoned the new year to be in the autumn (the exact date is unknown). In this system year 1 of the Seleucid era corresponds to the period from autumn 312 BC to summer 311 BC. By the 7th century AD / 10th AG, the west Syrian Christians settled on 1 October-to-30 September.&lt;ref name="palmer"&gt; {{cite book | title=The Seventh Century | author=Andrew Palmer | year=1993 | publisher=Liverpool University Press | pages=xxxiv, xxxvii, lii-lviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jews, however, reckon the start of each new Seleucid year with the lunar month Tishri.&lt;ref&gt;Emil Schürer, ''Geschichte des jüdischen Volkes im Zeitalter Jesu Christi'', vol. 1, Leipzig 1886–1890; 4th edition 1901–1909, pp. 36–46; [[Mishnah]], ''Rosh HaShanah'' 1:1&lt;/ref&gt;
These differences in the beginning of the year mean that dates may differ by one. Bickerman gives this example:

:For instance, the restoration of the temple of Jerusalem by [[Judas Maccabaeus]], approximately 15 December 164 BC, fell in the year 148 of the Seleucid Era according to Jewish (and Babylonian) calculation, but in the year 149 for the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Elias J. Bickerman|title = Notes on Seleucid and Parthian Chronology|journal = Berytus|volume = 8|pages = 73–84|year = 1943|url=http://almashriq.hiof.no/ddc/projects/archaeology/berytus-back/berytus08/73.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seleucid era was used as late as the 6th century [[Christian Era|AD]], for instance in the [[Zebed inscription]] in [[Syria]], dated the 24th of [[Gorpiaios]], 823 (24 September, 512 AD),&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Kugener, "Nouvelle Note Sur L'Inscription Trilingue De Zébed", ''[[Rivista degli Studi Orientali]]'' (1907), pp. 577-586.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the writings of [[John of Ephesus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Charanis]], "On the Question of the Hellenization of Sicily and Southern Italy During the Middle Ages", ''[[American Historical Review]]'', 52:1 (1946), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Syriac chroniclers continued to use it up to [[Michael the Syrian]] in the 12th century AD / 15th century AG.&lt;ref name="palmer" /&gt; It has been found on [[Nestorian Christian]] tombstones from [[Central Asia]] well into the 14th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxuscom.com/graves.htm Syriac Gravestones from Central Asia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seleucid era counting, or "era of contracts" (''minyan sheṭarot''), was used by [[Yemenite Jews]] in their legal deeds and contracts until modern times, a practice derived from an ancient Jewish teaching in the [[Babylonian Talmud|Talmud]], requiring all [[Diaspora Jews]] to uphold its practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Avodah Zarah'' 10a, which reads: “Said Rav Nahman: 'In the Diaspora, it is not permissible to count [the date in years] except only by the kings of the Grecians'.”&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the Seleucid era counting is mentioned in the [[Book of Maccabees]] (I Macc. i. 11) and in the writings of the historian, [[Josephus]]. The Seleucid era counting fell into disuse among most Jewish communities, following Rabbi [[David ben Zimra]]'s cancellation of the practice when he served as Chief Rabbi of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chaim Yosef David Azulai]], ''Shem ha-Gedolim'' [''Ma'arekhet Gedolim''], ed.

'''Stanisław Szukalski''' (13 December 1893 – 19 May 1987) was a Polish painter and sculptor, who intended to create a new Polish art based on its mythology and history. He also developed the [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]-[[Pseudohistory|historical]] theory of '''Zermatism&lt;!--redirected--&gt;''', positing that all human culture was derived from post-deluge [[Easter Island]] and that mankind was locked in an eternal struggle with the Sons of Yeti ("Yetinsyny"), the offspring of [[Yeti]] and humans. He illustrated this theory in his works.

==Overview==

==="Chicago Renaissance"===
Szukalski immigrated to the United States in his teens, where he joined the [[Visual arts of Chicago|arts scene]] in Chicago and became a vital part of the ''"Chicago Renaissance"''.  [[Ben Hecht]], who knew Szukalski in the 1920s, described him in his 1954 autobiography ''A Child of the Century'' as starving, muscular, aristocratic and disdainful of lesser beings than himself—traits Szukalski retained for the rest of his life. In 1929 he was a founder of an artistic movement called [[Szczep Rogate Serce|Tribe of the Horned Heart (Szczep Rogate Serce)]] – centered on Polish artists who sought inspiration in the pagan or pre-Christian history of Poland.

===Mickiewicz Monument in Vilnius===
{{main article|Mickiewicz Monument in Vilnius}}
The first design proposed for a monument of [[Adam Mickiewicz]] for Vilnius was promoted by [[Zbigniew Pronaszko]] of [[Vilnius University]] (then, Stefan Batory University in the [[Second Polish Republic]]). However, in May 1925, a contest was declared for the proposed monument.&lt;ref name="Szukalski53"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lameński|first=Lechosław|authorlink=Lechosław Lameński|title=Stach z Warty Szukalski i Szczep Rogate Serce |publisher=Wydawnictwo [[Katolicki Uniwersytet Lubelski Jana Pawła II|KUL]] |location=Lublin |year=2007|page=53|isbn=978-83-7363-554-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The period for submitting designs was extended a number of times thanks to the deep interest in the project by the artistic scene, with 67 designs ultimately submitted.&lt;ref name="Szukalski53"/&gt; The jury consisted of Vilnius's Municipal authorities and representatives of the arts scene, with General [[Lucjan Żeligowski]] at the helm.&lt;ref name="Szukalski54"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lameński|first=Lechosław|authorlink=Lechosław Lameński|title=Stach z Warty Szukalski i Szczep Rogate Serce |publisher=Wydawnictwo [[Katolicki Uniwersytet Lubelski Jana Pawła II|KUL]] |location=Lublin |year=2007|page=54|isbn=978-83-7363-554-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First prize went to [[Avant-Garde]] artist Stanisław Szukalski, Second Prize to [[Rafał Jachimowicz]], with the third prize awarded to [[Mieczysław Lubelski]].&lt;ref name="Szukalski54"/&gt; According to Szukalski's design Mickiewicz was naked, lying upon a sacrificial [[altar]].  The artist had the sculpture situated on a large pedestal in the shape of an [[Aztec]] [[pyramid]].&lt;ref name="Szukalski55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lameński|first=Lechosław|authorlink=Lechosław Lameński|title=Stach z Warty Szukalski i Szczep Rogate Serce |publisher=Wydawnictwo [[Katolicki Uniwersytet Lubelski Jana Pawła II|KUL]] |location=Lublin |year=2007|page=55|isbn=978-83-7363-554-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Coat of arms of Poland|White Eagle]]- Poland's national symbol was perched at the figure's side where it symbolically drank blood from the poet's wound.&lt;ref name="Szukalski55"/&gt;

Szukalski's design was highly divisive, with strong emotions coming to the surface that were for and against the design, among Poland's intelligentsia, leadership, art ciritics as well as ordinary individuals.&lt;ref name="Szukalski56-66"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lameński|first=Lechosław|authorlink=Lechosław Lameński|title=Stach z Warty Szukalski i Szczep Rogate Serce |publisher=Wydawnictwo [[Katolicki Uniwersytet Lubelski Jana Pawła II|KUL]] |location=Lublin |year=2007|pages=56–66|isbn=978-83-7363-554-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The polarized atmosphere led the monument committee to arrange for a new contest, this time consisting of only concepts by artists that were invited.&lt;ref name="Szukalski56-66"/&gt; The winner was [[Henryk Kuna]], whose proposal was chosen. However, due to a number of problems involving financing as well as a suitable location, the monument's construction dragged on.&lt;ref name="Szukalski56-66"/&gt; With the outbreak of [[World War II]] and the incorporation of Vilnius into Lithuania, the project was abandoned.&lt;ref name="Szukalski56-66"/&gt;

===Return to Poland and Move to California===
Szukalski returned to Poland in 1934. After the capitulation of Warsaw in September 1939, he took refuge in the US embassy, as he was an American citizen. Together with it employees, he managed to flee Poland and settle in California.

In the United States for many years he lived in poverty, unable to show his work, which was left in Poland were mostly destroyed by the Germans or seized by the communist government {{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} during the war and immediately after its completion. Szukalski odd jobs in film studios, designing the scenery, occasionally sculpted, more drawing.

In 1940, he settled in Los Angeles, where he became friends with the family of George DiCaprio, Leonardo DiCaprio's father [3]. Since 1940, he devoted most of their time solving puzzles and mysteries of prehistoric ancient history of mankind, the formation and shaping of languages, faiths, customs, arts, migration of peoples. He tried to unravel the origin of geographical names, gods, symbols that have survived in various forms – unexplained – to our times. This work, called "Protong", and Poland "Macimową," continued uninterruptedly for over 40 years. The volume of this work increases to 43 volumes of the manuscript, covering a variety of issues and several thousand precision, pen drawings of artifacts, which are "witnesses", confirming the author's theories, including the theory of pseudo zermatyzm.

In 1971, [[Glenn Bray]], a publisher who had previously specialized in the work of ''[[Mad Magazine]]'' artist [[Basil Wolverton]], befriended him and later published one book of Szukalski's art, ''Inner Portraits'' (1980), and another of his art and philosophy, ''A Trough Full of Pearls / Behold! The Protong'' (1982).  Bray and his wife Lena Zwalve maintain Szukalski's estate and the great bulk of his existing art under the name "Archives Szukalski."

==Zermatism==
Zermatism, Szukalski's concept of world history, postulated that all human culture derived from post-deluge [[Easter Island]] and that in all human languages one can find traces of the original, ancient mother-tongue of mankind. In his view, humanity was locked in an eternal struggle with the Sons of Yeti ("Yetinsyny"), the offspring of [[Yeti]] and humans, who had enslaved humanity from time immemorial. He claimed that the figures of the god Pan on Greek vases depict creatures that actually existed, the product of Yeti apes raping human women. Szukalski used his considerable artistic talents to illustrate his theories, which, despite their lack of scientific merit, have gained a cult following largely on their aesthetic value. The irony of this would have likely infuriated the hyper-curmudgeonly Szukalski.

==Artistic Legacy==
Among Szukalski's admirers are [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], who sponsored a retrospective exhibition entitled "Struggle" at the [[Laguna Art Museum]] in 2000, the [[Church of the SubGenius]], which incorporates the Yetinsyny elements of Zermatism,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://boingboing.net/stang_szukalski.html Szukalski: God King of the Kook Nation]'' – excerpt written by [[Ivan Stang|Rev. Ivan Stang]] from ''[https://www.amazon.com/Happy-Mutant-Handbook-Carla-Sinclair/dp/1573225029 The Happy Mutant Handbook]''&lt;/ref&gt; and the band [[Tool (band)|Tool]], who recommended&lt;ref&gt;http://toolshed.down.net/community/newsletter/letter.fall.94.html&lt;/ref&gt; "any collection of works you can find by this man is well worth the effort".

Szukalski's works are on permanent display at the [[Polish Museum of America]] in Chicago.  None of his work in Warsaw survived the destruction during WWII.  In addition to the Laguna retrospective, notable exhibitions of his work include "The Self-Born" at Varnish Fine Art, San Francisco, in 2005 and "Mantong and Protong," where Szukalski is paired with another unorthodox theorist of earth history, [[Richard Sharpe Shaver]], at [[Pasadena City College]] in 2009.

Following Szukalski's death in 1987, a group of his admirers spread his ashes on [[Easter Island]], in the rock quarry of [[Rano Raraku]].

[[File:Stolperstein in Genova.JPG|thumb|upright=0.85|&lt;small&gt;Stolperstein at the Galleria Mazzini&lt;/small&gt;]]
[[Stolpersteine]] is the German name for small, cobble stone-sized memorials collocated all over Europe by German artist [[Gunter Demnig]]. They remember the fate of the victims of [[Nazi Germany]] being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide. The first Stolperstein in [[Genoa]], the capital of the [[Regions of Italy|Italian region]] of [[Liguria]], was collocated in January 2012.

Generally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self chosen residence. The Stolperstein for [[Riccardo Pacifici|Riccardo Reuven Pacifici]] was collocated at the site of his arrest. The name of the Stolpersteine in Italian is ''pietre d'inciampo''.

&lt;small&gt;The list is sortable; the basic order follows the alphabet according to the last name of the victim.&lt;/small&gt;

==Background==
The short period of Nazi Germany ruling Italy from September 1943 to April 1945 left major traces of blood and sorrow. The major victims groups in Liguria were [[Italian resistance movement|resistance fighters]], people of [[Jewish]] origin and military personal that did not adhere to the German controlled [[Italian Social Republic]].

The Jews of Genoa lived, like all Jews of Italy, with limitations of their freedom and suffered periodic expulsions. The "ghetto" was moved to piazza dei Tessitori in 1674. In the 17th century it was planned to move it again, but an expulsion decree prevented the project. However, in recent history Italian Jews did not have to fear for their lives — except during the short and deadly period in which Nazi German occupied large parts of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Genova Quotidiana: ''[https://genovaquotidiana.com/2015/11/27/breve-storia-del-ghetto-ebraico-a-genova/ Breve storia del ghetto ebraico a Genova]'',  27 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The synagogue of Genoa was built in 1935 by architect Francesco Morandi. It is located in via Bertora, a few steps from via Assarotti. It was there that the Germans convened a meeting in November 1943. The intention of the Nazis was to arrest all Jews of Genoa in a single stroke. Fifty Jews appeared, among them were also chief rabbi Riccardo Pacifici, his wife and their children of 2 and 4 years. All detainees were deported to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] on 3 November 1943 where they were all murdered.

He was the only son of Enrica Morpurgo and Mario Labó (1884-1961). His father was a well known architect and historian of architecture. After 9 September 1943, he joined the [[Gruppi di Azione Partigiana]] (G.A.P.) in Rome and carried the nom de guerre "Lamberto". He was arrested by the German SS on 1 February 1944, and bestialized in the [[Museum of the Liberation of Rome|Via Tasso prison]]. Neveretheless, he refused to reveal the names of his fellow fighters. On 7 March 1944, Giorgio Labò was executed in [[Forte Bravetta]], without trial, without verdict.

The Stolperstein is located in front of Via Roma 1, where his family lived during the time of his assassination — in the immediate vicinity of Riccardo Pacifici's Stolperstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genua|trans-title=|periodical=www.gedenkorte-europa.eu|publisher=|url=http://www.gedenkorte-europa.eu/content/list/480/|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2016-02-04|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Posthumously he received the [[Medal of Military Valor|Gold Medal of Military Valor]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4636">'''Systems theory in archaeology''' is the application of [[systems theory]] and [[systems thinking]] in [[archaeology]]. It originated with the work of [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] in the 1950s, and is introduced in archaeology in the 1960s with the work of [[Sally Binford|Sally R. Binford]] &amp; [[Lewis Binford]]'s "New Perspectives in Archaeology" and [[Kent V. Flannery]]'s "Archaeological Systems Theory and Early Mesoamerica".  

== Overview ==
Bertalanffy attempted to construct a [[general systems theory]] that would explain the interactions of different variables in a variety of [[systems]], no matter what those variables actually represented. A system was defined as a group of interacting parts and the relative influence of these parts followed rules which, once formulated could be used to describe the system no matter what the actual components were.&lt;ref&gt;(Trigger, 1989:303).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Binford stated the problem in ''New Perspectives in Archaeology'', identifying the [[Low Range Theory]], the [[Middle range theory (archeology)|Middle range theory]], and the [[Upper Range Theory]]. 
* The Low Range Theory could be used to explain a specific aspect of a specific [[culture]], such as the archaeology of [[Mesoamerica]]n [[agriculture]].  
* A Middle Range Theory could describe any cultural system outside of its specific cultural context, for example, the archaeology of agriculture.  
* An Upper Range Theory can explain any cultural system, independent of any specifics and regardless of the nature of the variables{{Clarify|date=November 2013}}.  
At the time Binford thought the Middle Range Theory may be as far as archaeologists could ever go, but in the mid-1970s some believed that Systems Theory offered the definitive Upper Range Theory.

Archaeologist [[Kent Flannery]] did some very important and pioneering work in this field in his paper ''Archaeological Systems Theory and Early Mesoamerica''.&lt;ref&gt; (Flannery, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;  Systems theory allowed archaeologists to treat the [[archaeological record]] in a completely new way. No longer did it matter what you were looking at, because you were breaking it down to its elemental system components. Culture may be [[subjectivity|subjective]], but as long as you treat it mathematically the same way as you treat a retreating glacier then unless you attack the model of Systems Theory in general then your results were undeniably objective.  In other words, the problem of cultural bias no longer had any meaning, unless it was a problem with Systems Theory itself.  Culture was now just another natural system that could be explained in mathematical terms.

== Criticism ==
Unfortunately archaeologists found it was rarely possible to use Systems Theory in a rigorously mathematical way.  While it provided a wonderful framework for describing interactions in terms of types of feedback within the system, it was rarely possible to put the [[Numerical data|quantitative]] values that Systems Theory requires for full use, as Flannery himself admits.&lt;ref&gt; (Flannery, 1968:85)&lt;/ref&gt; The result was that in the long run Systems Theory was less useful in explaining change as it was in describing it. &lt;ref&gt;(Trigger, 1989:308).&lt;/ref&gt;  

Systems Theory also eventually went on to show that predictions that a high amount of cultural regularities would be found were certainly overly optimistic during the early stages of [[Processual archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt; (Trigger, 1989:312).&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically enough this is exactly the opposite of what Processual archaeologists were hoping it would be able to do with Systems Theory.  However it was not completely a disappointment and Systems Theory is still used to describe how variables inside a cultural system can interact.

Systems Theory, at least, was important in the rise of [[Processual archaeology]] and was a call against Culture-Historical methods of past generations. It held argument that one could contemplate the past impartially and sidestep pitfalls through rigour.

'''Theophilus Jones''' (18 October 1758 &amp;ndash; 15 January 1812) was a Welsh lawyer, known as a historian of [[Brecknockshire]].

==Life==
Theophilus Jones was the son of Hugh Jones (d. 1799), vicar of [[Llangammarch]] and then [[Llywel]], Brecknockshire, and a prebendary of the [[Christ College, Brecon|collegiate church of Brecon]]; and his wife, Elinor (d. 1786), daughter of the historian [[Theophilus Evans]].&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Roberts 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; For many years he practised as a solicitor in [[Brecon]]. The death of his father gave him an additional degree of financial security, and following his appointment as deputy-registrar of the [[archdeaconry of Brecon]], he sold his business in 1808 to have time to write.{{sfn|Goodwin|1892|p=161}}

Jones married Mary Price in 1783.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; He died on 15 January 1812, and was buried in the church of Llangammarch; his widow died on 22 July 1828.{{sfn|Goodwin|1892|p=161}}

==Works==
Jones's ''History of the County of Brecknock'' was published in two volumes in Brecon in 1805 and 1809. It was reprinted in one volume in 1898; and in a considerably enlarged form in four volumes, edited by [[Joseph Russell Bailey, 1st Baron Glanusk]], in 1909 to 1930.

Jones also published antiquarian communications in magazines, two papers in the ''Cambrian Register'' in 1795 and 1796, and another in ''[[Society of Antiquaries of London#Publications|Archaeologia]]'', journal of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]], in 1814. He planned to write a history of [[Radnorshire]] which, however, never materialised; and he began a translation of [[Ellis Wynne]]'s romance ''Gweledigaethau y Bardd Cwsg'' (Visions of the Sleeping Bard).{{sfn|Goodwin|1892|p=161}}

'''Tuvia Friling''' (born 7 May 1953) is a professor at the Ben-Gurion Research Institute for the Study of Israel and Zionism and teaches at the Israel Studies Program both at [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]], Israel.

==Biography and early academic career==
Tuvia Friling's parents with his elder brother and two sisters immigrated to [[Israel]] in 1951 from [[Bârlad]], [[Romania]]. Arriving in Israel, the family, which had been prosperous in Romania, was first housed in a [[maabara]] (transit camp for new immigrants) in [[Beer Sheba]]. A year later they moved to a small apartment in a new neighborhood of the developing town. Tuvia Friling was born in Beer Sheba in 1953, two years after his family's arrival in Israel. In 1967, after completing [[elementary school]] in his hometown, he enrolled in the Jerusalem May Boyer [[boarding school]] for gifted students.

In 1971 he was drafted into the [[Israel Defense Forces|army]] and served as a [[squad]] commander in the 890 [[Paratrooper]]s [[Battalion]]. In August 1973 he completed [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] training and was deployed as [[platoon]] commander in the [[Golani Brigade]]'s training base. During the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]] he participated in two attempts to re-capture [[Mount Hermon]], and fought in other battles on the [[Golan Heights]]. During the attrition war that followed and until the end of his regular military service he was deputy company commander in Golani. He continued to do reserve duty, eventually rising to the rank of [[major]].

Friling received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] with honors at the [[Ben-Gurion University]] in 1979 in [[Jewish history|Jewish]] and General [[History]]. For the four following years, 1979–1983, he taught history at a Beer-Sheba [[High School]] and worked as instructor for the teaching of history at Ben-Gurion University's teacher training program. He did his graduate studies at the Institute of Contemporary Jewry at the [[Hebrew University]], [[Jerusalem]], where he completed his [[Masters degree]] with honors in 1984 (the topic of his [[thesis]] was "[[David Ben-Gurion|Ben-Gurion]]'s Role in the Rescue Attempts of Children and in the Absorption Controversy") and received his [[Ph.D.]] in 1991 (the topic of his [[dissertation]] was "Ben-Gurion and the Destruction of European Jewry 1939–1945"). Both dissertations were supervised by [[Yehuda Bauer]].&lt;ref&gt;full name and details of the dissertation in Hebrew: דוד בן גוריון ושואת יהודי אירופה, 1945-1939 / חיבור לשם קבלת   תואר "דוקטור לפילוסופיה", מאת טוביה פרילינג, בהדרכתו של פרופ' יהודה באואר ; הוגש לסינט האוניברסיטה העברית בירושלים, שבט תש"ן, פברואר 1990 ;  ירושלים : האוניברסיטה העברית בירושלים, תש"ן&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prizes==
Tuvia Friling was awarded the 1999 [[Mordechai Ish Shalom]] Prize for his book ''Arrows in the Dark: David Ben-Gurion, the Yishuv leadership, and rescue attempts during the Holocaust''; in  2001 he received the [[Prime Minister]]'s Prize – the most prominent Prize awarded by the State Council for the Commemoration of Presidents and Prime Ministers.&lt;ref name="bgu.ac.il"&gt;[http://www.bgu.ac.il/html/dover/news/1621609.shtml Dr. Tuvia Friling Wins Ben-Gurion Prize 5761 March 22, 2001], [[Ben-Gurion University]] Site&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic positions and professional career==
Friling began his academic career at [[Ben-Gurion University]] in 1977 as an instructor and research assistant, and has been teaching at the university ever since. During 1983–1991 he was a researcher at the Ben-Gurion Research Center as well as the director of the Ben-Gurion Archives. During 1993–2001 he served as director of the Ben-Gurion Heritage Institute and the Ben-Gurion Research Center in the University's [[Sde Boqer]] Campus. He initiated and in cooperation with the University's Computation center, established the digitalized Ben-Gurion Archive – a world class computerized archive and database that provides online access using full text retrieval software. For his accomplishments as the head of the Ben-Gurion institutes he was awarded the Prime Minister's Prize.&lt;ref name="bgu.ac.il"/&gt;

In the years 2001–2004 Friling served as Israel's State Archivist. In this position he initiated a master plan for upgrading Israel's archives system. The program's mainstays were: the construction of permanent quarters in Jerusalem housing the State Archives; the creation of a central modern storage center in the Negev for the archival holdings; the computerization of the State Archives and the creation of a computerized network of all Israel's public archives; the creation of the infrastructure and organization for the preservation of the State of Israel's computerized documentation and its conversion with the advent of new technological generations; the updating of the Israeli Archives' Law, shortening of the classification period, changes in the practice of  destruction of the documentation in order to expand and enrich the quantity and variety of documentation that is preserved for perpetuity; and the establishment of a national Authority for Archives and Public Records.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgu.ac.il/html/dover/news/1003661842.shtml Dr. Tuvia Friling Named State Archivist]

In the years 2003–2004 Friling was one of the three co-vice chairs of the International Commission on the [[Holocaust in Romania]], chaired by [[Nobel Prize Laureate]] [[Elie Wiesel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/oct/23/world/fg-briefs23.1 Wiesel to Head Panel on Nation's World War II Role]

Friling was a visiting scholar in various academic institutes in Israel and abroad: 1992–1993 at the Meyerhoff Center for Hebrew and Jewish Studies at [[University of Maryland, College Park]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishstudies.umd.edu/faculty/all_visiting.htm Research Fellow Faculty, Joseph and Rebecca Meyerhoff, Center for Jewish Studies], [[University of Maryland, College Park]] Site&lt;/ref&gt; 1996 at the [[Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies|Center for Hebrew and Jewish Studies]], [[Yarnton]], [[Oxford]]; 1999–2000 at the [[International Institute for Holocaust Research]], [[Yad Vashem]], [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Yitzhak Rabin Center]], [[Tel Aviv]]; 2002–2004 at the [[Shalem Center]], Jerusalem; 2006–2007 at the Center of Advanced Holocaust Studies, [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], [[Washington DC]]; 2007–2008 at the Gildenhorn Institute for Israel Studies, University of Maryland; 2013-2014 at the Schusterman center for Israel studies, Brandeis university, Waltham, USA.

Friling served on the editorial boards of several academic journals: ''Iyunim Bitkumat Israel - Studies in Zionism'', ''the [[Yishuv]] and the State of [[Israel]]'', published by the Ben-Gurion Research Institute; ''Israel Studies'', published by the Ben-Gurion Research Institute and [[Brandeis University]]; and ''Shvut'', published by the Diaspora Research Center of [[Tel Aviv University]] and the Ben-Gurion Research Institute. Currently he serves at Israel Studies, published by the Ben-Gurion Research Institute and Brandeis University

==Research interests==
Friling's research interest focuses on the [[Zionist]] leadership's role in the nation building processes in the pre-state [[Yishuv]] and the State of [[Israel]], as well as on [[David Ben-Gurion]]'s leadership during that period and the ensemble of his decision making and strategic moves before and after the establishment of the State of Israel. In addition, Friling explored the Yishuv leadership's role in rescue attempts during the [[Holocaust]] and the impact of these issues on questions pertaining to Israeli identity. His book "[[Arrows in the Dark]]—David Ben-Gurion, the Yishuv leadership, and rescue attempts during the Holocaust" ([[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], 2005) analyzes the Yishuv's rescue efforts during the Holocaust and provides a detailed account of the scope and complexities of the activities carried out by David Ben-Gurion and the Yishuv leadership during that period.&lt;ref&gt;Tuvia Friling, 2005, ''Arrows in the Dark: David Ben-Gurion, the Yishuv Leadership and Rescue Attempts during the Holocaust'', the University of Wisconsin Press, USA, 2 Volumes

Friling also dealt with [[post-Zionism]] and the roots of the controversy between so-called [[New Historians|new historians]] and critical sociologists and "establishment" historians and sociologists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-6909578/Some-basic-issues-of-the.html Some basic issues of the Zionist/post-Zionist controversy.(Essay)]

His article: The Seventh Million as the Zionist Movement's March of Folly, was published in 1992 and was among the first attempts to grapple with this controversy. Further contributions to this debate were an article he co-authored with [[Yehuda Bauer]], that was published in Iton 77,&lt;ref&gt;"Lo Tom Ve-Lo Segev, The Seventh Million and Joel Brand's Plan", Iton 77, vol. 160–161, pp. 24–28.&lt;/ref&gt; and a comprehensive book he edited, entitled An Answer to a Post-Zionist Colleague  – a compilation of articles by various researchers shedding light on different perspectives of this issue.&lt;ref&gt;2003, An Answer to a Post-Zionist Colleague, Yediot Acharonot Publication - Hemed Books
* [http://www.bibliomonde.com/livre/critique-post-sionisme-2999.html Critique du post-sionisme par Tuvia Friling (direction de l'ouvrage)], from Biblio Monde&lt;/ref&gt;

Friling also dealt with the historical and ideological roots of the debate about Israel's social and economic policy in recent years, and together with  Daniel Gutwein and Avi Bareli edited a two volume publication Society and Economy in Israel: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Avi Bareli, Danny Gutwein, Tuvia Friling, (eds.), 2005—Economy and Society in Israel: Present and Historical Perspective, Iyunim Bitkumat Israel, the Series Subject, the Ben-Gurion Research Institute, the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and Yad Ben Zvi Institute, Jerusalem&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuvia Friling was among Israel's pioneers in the development of computerized full-text databases of historical documentation based on modern retrieval systems. The digitalized online archive he created with his partners at the Ben-Gurion Research Institute in Sde Boqer provides scholars with unprecedented research opportunities. Friling also developed teaching methods for teaching history in a research environment and by means of computerized online settings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=962664 Neli Oren, The Cyber-Alternative for Researching the Rebirth of Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;
This program served as the foundation for scores of teacher training courses entitled "The Expedition to the Isle of Story".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=962848 : Edna Batan, Tuvia Friling, Expedition to the Isle of "Storia": a Workshop for the Young Historian. Research Methodology and the Computerized Environment in Teaching History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Friling is at present engaged in researching the activities of the [[Yishuv]]'s [[right-wing]] circles during the [[Holocaust]] in [[illegal immigration]], aid and rescue, as well as their clandestine cooperation with [[United States|American]], [[British people|British]] and other [[intelligence services]], and their post [[World War II]] involvement in illegal immigration and the building of an [[armed force]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3855">'''Ulrich Wilcken''' (December 18, 1862 – December 10, 1944) was a German historian and [[papyrologist]] who was a native of [[Stettin]].

== Biography ==
Wilcken studied ancient history and [[Oriental studies]] in [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]], [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]] and [[University of Berlin|Berlin]]. He was a disciple of historian [[Theodor Mommsen]] (1817–1903), who encouraged Wilcken to take a position as cataloguer of [[papyrus|papyri]] following graduation. Mommsen was also instrumental in Wilcken succeeding [[Eduard Meyer]] (1855–1930) as associate professor of ancient history at the [[University of Breslau]] in 1889. Afterwards, he was a professor at the universities of [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]] (from 1900), [[University of Halle|Halle]] (from 1903, where he was again a successor to Eduard Meyer), Leipzig (from 1906) and [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] (from 1912), where he succeeded [[Heinrich Nissen]] (1839–1912). Later on, he served as a professor at [[University of Munich|Munich]] (from 1915) and Berlin (from 1917), where he was successor to [[Otto Hirschfeld]] (1843–1922).

Wilcken was a German pioneer of Greco-Roman [[papyrology]], and is credited for amassing an extensive archive of [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] papyri documents and [[ostraca]].

In 1906 he became a member of the [[Saxon Academy of Sciences|Saxon Society of Sciences]], and in 1921, he became a member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]].

==Works==

Among his written works was a 1931 book on [[Alexander the Great]] (''Alexander der Grosse''), being translated into English in 1932 with the title "Alexander the Great" (translated by G.C. Richards).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/alexander-the-great/oclc/651914408 WorldCat Titles] (publication)&lt;/ref&gt; Other publications by Wilcken include:
* ''Observationes ad historiam Aegypti provinciae Romanae depromptae e papyris Graecis Berolinensibus ineditis''. Haack, Berlin 1885. 
* ''Griechische Ostraka aus Aegypten und Nubien, Ein Beitrag zur antiken Wirtschaftsgeschichte''. (Greek ostracon of [[Egypt]] and [[Nubia]], Contribution of historical antiques) . two volumes. [[Giesecke &amp; Devrient]], Leipzig 1899. reprinted Hakkert, [[Amsterdam]] 1970. 
* ''Grundzüge und Chrestomathie der Papyruskunde''. volume 1: Historical part (in two halves). Leipzig 1912. (volume 2: Legal part by Ludwig Mitteis 1859–1921).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4679">In [[linguistics]], the '''unidirectionality hypothesis''' proposes that [[grammaticalisation]] works in a single direction. That is, [[pronoun]]s may fuse with verbs, or [[preposition]]s may fuse with nouns, to create new [[inflection]]al systems, but inflectional endings do not break off to create new pronouns or prepositions.  

The unidirectionality hypothesis does not claim that linguistic change ''will'' occur in any particular instance, only that if it ''does'' occur, it will be in the direction of [[lexical word]] to [[grammatical word]] and not the other way around. 

Certain schools of linguistics object to the unidirectionality hypothesis on theoretical grounds, believing that there should be no favoured direction in the evolution of grammatical forms, and have proposed numerous counter-examples. However, most of these proposals show a lack of understanding of the hypothesis or of the history of the languages in question, and are instead examples of [[lexicalisation]]. True counter-examples to unidirectionality appear to be rare and require unusual conditions.

==A counter-example==

One counter-example is the evolution of a new pronoun for "we" out of verbal conjugations in northern dialects of [[Irish language|Irish Gaelic]]. It's as if [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''hablamos'' (we speak) were reanalyzed as ''habla mos,'' with ''mos'' becoming a new pronoun "we" that replaced the existing pronoun ''nosotros''. In Irish this required a rather special set of circumstances. 

Unusually for a European language, Irish is verb-initial, as can be seen in phrases such as 
:''Chonaic mé thú'' "I saw you" (literally ''saw I thee'').

In [[Old Irish]] the verb was inflected for person, as it still is in the south of Ireland. The verb 'to be' was inflected as follows: 

{| class=wikitable
!''to be''&lt;br&gt;(Old Irish)!!singular!!plural
|-
|'''1'''||at-to||at-táam
|-
|'''2'''||at-tai||at-táaid
|-
|'''3'''||at-tá||at-táat
|}

With such a system, there was no need for pronouns except for emphasis, as is the case with [[Spanish language|Spanish]] today. However, in the north of Ireland, the system eroded, and most of the inflectional endings disappeared. The use of the subject pronouns then became obligatory to disambiguate the person of the verb. A similar change has taken place in [[French language|French]], where the loss of most of the verbal endings (in the spoken language at least) has meant that subject pronouns are now required. 

The subject pronouns of modern Irish are the following:

{| class=wikitable
!pronouns&lt;br&gt;(modern)!!singular!!plural
|-
|'''1'''||mé||sinn
|-
|'''2'''||tú||sibh
|-
|'''3m&lt;br&gt;3f'''||sé,&lt;br&gt;sí||siad
|}

These were added to the verb wherever the inflections had disappeared. Since the subject comes after the verb in Irish, the pronouns effectively replaced the old verbal endings: 

{| class=wikitable
!''to be''&lt;br&gt;(modern)!!singular!!plural
|-
|'''1'''||táim ''or''&lt;br&gt;tá mé||táimid
|-
|'''2'''||tá tú||tá sibh
|-
|'''3'''||tá sé,&lt;br&gt;tá sí||tá siad
|}

The first-person singular ("I") form is still retained in some areas but appears to be in the process of dropping out and being replaced by the pronoun ''mé''. However, the first-person plural ("we") form&amp;mdash;the only ending that was a complete syllable&amp;mdash;is robust everywhere, and the pronoun ''sinn'' is not used in this situation. This happened not just with the verb 'to be' but with all Irish verbs. 

The unidirectionality hypothesis would predict that this paradigm would either remain as it is, with the pronouns retaining their status as independent words, or else that they might fuse with the verb into a new verbal conjugational system, as existed in Old Irish. However, something more unusual occurred: the pronouns did retain their separate status, but the first-person plural verbal ending ''-mid'' was reanalyzed as a pronoun, by analogy with the other persons. Thus Irish has acquired a new pronoun for "we", ''muid'', which can be used as an independent word, for example as an emphatic ''muide'' "us": If someone asks "Who is there?", an Irish speaker might reply, ''Is muide'' ("It is us"). This new pronoun appears to be replacing the original pronoun ''sinn''.

'''Volodymyr Viatrovych''' ({{lang-uk|Володи́мир В'ятро́вич}}; born 7 July 1977) is a Ukrainian historian and most influential Ukrainian national-memory activist.&lt;ref name="mcbridge"/&gt; He has been Director of the [[Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance]] since 25 March 2014. He is a [[Candidate of Sciences]] (Ph.D) in historical sciences, director of the Center for Research of Liberation Movement in [[Lviv]], and a member of the  board of trustees of the "[[Prison on Łąckiego]]" Museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://upa.in.ua/book/?page_id=5 Biographical note in ''The Ukrainian Insurgent Army'' 2008 (in Ukrainian).]&lt;/ref&gt; From 2008 to 2010 he was director of the Archives of the [[Security Service of Ukraine]].

== Biography and academic career, 1994 to present==

From 1994 to 1999 Viatrovych was a student at the history faculty of [[Lviv University]] (West Ukraine) where he specialised in Ukrainian history. In 2004 he defended his doctoral thesis: “UPA raids beyond Ukrainian borders as part of the creation of an anti-totalitarian national-democratic revolution among the nations of East-Central Europe”. (He had already issued a book on the subject in 2001.)

From November 2002 to March 2008 Viatrovych was director of the Centre for the Study of the Liberation Movement, based in [[Lviv]]. In 2005 and 2006 he lectured at the [[Ukrainian Catholic University]]. During that time he drew up the first course in Ukrainian higher education on “The Ukrainian Liberation Movement from the 1920s to 1950s” for students of the historical faculties of the Catholic University and the [[Ivan Franko]] Lviv University.

From August 2005 to December 2007 Viatrovych was a research associate at the I. Kripyakevich Institute for Ukrainian Studies at the National Academy of Sciences in Kiev.

In 2010-2011 he worked in the US at the Ukraine Research Institute at [[Harvard University]].

Viatrovych subsequently became director of the Center for the History of State-Building in Ukraine at the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]].&lt;ref name="cdvr.org.ua"&gt;[http://www.cdvr.org.ua/content/new-director-ukrainian-national-memory-institute-historical-memory-policy-safeguard-against-repeating-crimes-past "The New Director of the Ukrainian National Memory Institute says that Historical Memory Policy is a Safeguard Against Repeating the Crimes of the Past", Center for the Study of the Liberation Movement (website), 23 March 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Remembrance, 2007 to present ==

Between May 2007 and January 2008 Viatrovych was a representative of the [[Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance]] for [[Lviv Oblast]].

In 2008 he served as research consultant to the international project, [[“Ukraine Remembers, the World Acknowledges”]] which aimed to popularise the subject of the [[Holodomor]], the 1932-3 famine in Ukraine, and, through international lobbying, to gain world recognition that this was an act of genocide. From January to October 2008 Viatrovych was head of the archives department at Ukraine’s [[Institute of National Remembrance]].

From October 2008 to March 2010 Viatrovych was adviser on research to [[Valentyn Nalyvaichenko]], the head of the SBU or [[Security Service of Ukraine]] (2006-2010). Viatrovych was a moving force behind the idea of putting Stalin and other Soviet leaders of the time on trial for genocide for their part in the [[Holodomor]]. They were found guilty in January 2010 by the Court of Appeal in Kiev (prompting an indignant reaction from certain Russian officials).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rt.com/politics/holodomor-famine-stalin-ukraine/ "Yushchenko brings Stalin to court over genocide", RT.com, 14 January 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Viatrovych has been a trustee of the Lontsky Prison National Museum-Memorial to the Victims of Occupation Regimes (Nazi and Soviet) in Lviv, since it was set up and opened to the public in 2009. From March 2008 onwards he has chaired the research council of the Centre for the Study of the Liberation Movement (Lviv).

On 25 March 2014 Viatrovych was appointed Director of the [[Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance]].&lt;ref name="cdvr.org.ua"/&gt;

== Political activism, 2004 &amp; 2013-2015 ==

When the [[Orange Revolution]] took place in 2004 Viatrovych took an active part, supposedly as a leader of the [[Pora]] ("It's Time!") youth movement.

During the [[Euromaidan]] protests in 2013 Viatrovych called for active measures against the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2013/12/23/7008042/ Mariana Petsukh, "Volodymyr Vyatrovich: 'We are obliged to leave the Maidan as an organised force'," ''Evropeiska Pravda'' website, 23 December 2013 (in Ukrainian).]&lt;/ref&gt; He coordinated mass demonstrations and led a column of activists to block the government buildings and the parliament ([[Verkhovna Rada]]).

Speaking of the rotation of Euromaidan activists he recalled the activities of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] or UPA: “In the 1940s and 1950s conditions in the underground were worse: people did not leave temporarily to go back to work, but because a comrade had gone forever. That is why we shall succeed!” He also commented: “We do not intend to halt after the regime has changed in Ukraine, when we have got rid of the rule of Yanukovych.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2013/12/23/7008042/ Mariana Petsukh, "Volodymyr Viatrovych: 'We are obliged to leave the Maidan as an organised force'," ''Evropeiska Pravda'' website, 23 December 2013 (in Ukrainian).]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 President [[Petro Poroshenko]] approved [[Ukrainian decommunization laws|four laws]] concerning [[Decommunization in Ukraine]]. Volodymyr Viatrovych was involved in the drafting of two of these laws. The criminal sentences imposed by these acts and their phrasing came in for criticism within the country and abroad. The law "On access to the archives of repressive bodies of the communist totalitarian regime from 1917-1991" placed the state archives concerning repression during the Soviet period under the jurisdiction of the [[Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance]], now headed by Volodymyr Viatrovych.&lt;ref&gt;[http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1462928536 Halya Coynash, "'Decommunization' in Ukraine Carried Out Using Communist Methods", Human Rights in Ukraine website, 9 June 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viatrovych as historian (2002-2012) ==
The first Volodymyr Viatrovych's book about the rallies of [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] (UPA) in [[Czechoslovakia]] was written based on his PhD thesis.&lt;ref name="Motyka 2012"/&gt; It was devoted to a little explored area, and that this work has been appreciated and probably resulted in Viatrovich's appointment a director of TsDVR (Centre for the Study of the Liberation Movement).&lt;ref name="Motyka 2012"/&gt;

=== ''Army of the Immortals'', 2002 ===
His third book ''Army of the Immortals'' (2002) was discussed some years later on the Polit.ru website by Professor [[Alexei I. Miller]] of the [[Central European University]] in Budapest and Ukrainian historian Georgy Kasyanov from the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]]. In Miller's view the book was essentially glorification of the [[Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists]] (OUN) and the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] (UPA). Many historical sources were disregarded in the book's writing, says Miller, and falsified stories were cited. Viatrovych preferred to ignore all criticism of the ''Army of the Immortals'' that originated within the academic community, says Miller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polit.ru/article/2009/04/02/historia/|title=Россия-Украина: как пишется история /  Ukraine-Russia: How history is being written|last=Miller|first=Alexey|first2=Georgy |last2=Kasianov|publisher=polit.ru website|date=2 April 2009|language=Russian|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 similar concerns about discussion of the past, the role and influence of Volodymyr Viatrovych, and the impact of divergent views on the present were raised in a discussion following a [[Columbia University]] workshop on “Russian and Ukrainian Nationalism: Entangled Histories”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taraskuzio.net/Files/Kuzio_Columbia.pdf Taras Kuzio, "This is not how Ukrainian history should be debated", ''The Ukrainian Weekly'', 19 May 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ukraineanalysis.wordpress.com/2013/06/03/limits-of-tolerance/ Discussion of David Marples, "The Limits of Tolerance", Current Politics in Ukraine website; contribution by Halya Coynash, 3 June 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''OUN attitudes towards the Jews'', 2006 ===
This book provides a one-sided view on the OUN's attitude towards Jews.&lt;ref name = "Kurylo"&gt;Taras Kuryło, John-Paul Himka, “Iak OUN stavylasia do ievreiv? Rozdumy nad knyzhkoiu Volodymyra Viatrovycha”, Ukraina Moderna 13 (2008), pp.252-265 [https://ualberta.academia.edu/JohnPaulHimka/Papers/492247/Iak_OUN_stavylasia_do_ievreiv_Rozdumy_nad_knyzhkoiu_Volodymyra_V_iatrovycha]&lt;/ref&gt; The book portrays the Ukrainian nationalists and UPA as a ''"national liberation"'' movement and deny any accusations in their collaboration with Nazi Germany and involvement in the Holocaust.&lt;ref name=rossolinski/&gt; In his book Viatrovich presents only one critical article on OUN's anti-semitism, with the only purpose to immediately dismiss it.&lt;ref name=rossolinski/&gt; 
[[John-Paul Himka]] and Taras Kurylo describe Viatrovich's methodology as follows:

{{quote
|V'iatrovych manages to exonerate the OUN of charges of antisemitism and complicity in the Holocaust only by employing a series of highly dubious procedures: rejecting sources that compromise the OUN, accepting uncritically censored sources from émigré OUN circles, failing to recognize antisemitism in OUN texts, limiting the source base to official OUN proclamations and decisions, excluding Jewish memoirs, refusing to consider contextual and comparative factors, failing to consult German document collections, and ignoring the mass of historical monographs on his subject written in the English and German languages.&lt;ref name = "Kurylo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brama.com"&gt;[http://brama.com/news/press/2008/03/080319himka_nachtigall.html John-Paul Himka, "True and False Lessons from the Nachtigall Episode", Brama News and Community Press website, 19 March 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Other authors agree that this book is an attempt to deny the crimes of [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] (OUN) on [[Jews]] and to dismiss the allegations of its [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref name=rudling&gt;[[Per Anders Rudling|Per A. Rudling]], "The OUN, the UPA and the Holocaust: A Study in the Manufacturing of Historical Myths", ''The Carl Beck Papers in Russian &amp; East European Studies'', No. 2107, November 2011, {{ISSN|0889-275X}}, pp.28-31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rossolinski&gt;Grzegorz Rossoliński-Liebe, "Debating, obfuscating and disciplining the Holocaust: post-Soviet historical discourses on the OUN–UPA and other nationalist movements", ''East European Jewish Affairs'', 42:3, pp. 207-208&lt;/ref&gt; In the opinion of Kurylo and Himka, this work does less to understanding history, but does much to distort it, however it contains an interesting material and forms the basis for further discussions on the relationship of the OUN and UPA to Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Taras Kuryło, John-Paul Himka, “Iak OUN stavylasia do ievreiv?..., p.264&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of alleged collaboration of Jews with UPA and as an evidence of the Ukrainian nationalist forces' lack of anti-semitism, Viatrovych mentions [[Leiba Dubrovskii]], an alleged Jewish member of UPA and genuine Ukrainian nationalist. However, in reality Dubrovskii was a Soviet POW who ''concealed'' his ethnicity when was captured by Germans.&lt;ref name="haarez"/&gt; He never disclosed his real ethnicity to UPA members and was no enthusiastic supporter of Ukrainian nationalism.&lt;ref name="haarez"&gt;[https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/ukraine-nationalists-are-using-a-jew-to-whitewash-their-nazi-era-past-1.5464194]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Second Polish-Ukrainian War'', 2011 ===

In this book, Viatrovych is trying to address arguably the most difficult issue in the history of [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]] and [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army|UPA]]: [[massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia|Volynian massacre]].&lt;ref name=warfare379 /&gt; In attempts to exonerate Ukrainian nationalists, Viatrovich presents the UPA's massacre of Polish civilians as a part of a military conflict, i.e. as a war between Poles and Ukrainians, which he calls ''The Second Polish-Ukrainian War'',&lt;ref name=warfare379 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Motyka 2012"/&gt; thereby implying that the events he describes were a continuation of the [[Polish-Ukrainian war]] (1918–19).&lt;ref name=warfare379 /&gt; Viatrovych tries to prove that there was no order of OUN’s leadership for the extermination of the Polish minority, and the Volynia massacre was just a spontaneous rebellion of Ukrainian peasants provoked by the Poles.&lt;ref name = "Portnov"/&gt;
"''The Second Polish-Ukrainian war''" was met in West Ukraine with uncritical enthusiasm.&lt;ref&gt;Portnov (2012), p. 326.[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/491788 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Андрей Портнов, "Истории для домашнего употребления", p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; However, Viatryovych's attempts to downplay or conceal OUN-UPA's military crimes have been condemned by several scholars. Ivan Katchanovski (University of Ottawa) states that the aim of Viatrovych in disseminating his narrative was to "restore Bandera's good name" mostly in the mass media and in non-academic or unscholarly publications.&lt;ref name=Katch&gt;I.

According to Motyka, although the book's sections devoted to the [[14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Ukrainian)|SS-Galizien Division]] and the fate of the Ukrainian population in Poland in the years 1945-1947 are of some value,&lt;ref name="Motyka 2012"&gt;Гжегож Мотыка.

In his review, Jared McBride noted the sharp contrast between good quality publications about Ukrainian nationalism published by Western scholars and Viatrovich's ''The Second Polish-Ukrainian War'', which he characterised as "a myopic, poorly researched apology for Ukrainian nationalist violence."&lt;ref name = "mcbridge"&gt;Jared McBride. Who’s Afraid of Ukrainian Nationalism?

Per Rudling denies the monograph any scholarly value as said he would recommend ''The Second Polish-Ukrainian war'' to readers only as an object of comparative studies in far-right revisionism and obfuscation.&lt;ref name=warfare379 /&gt; He also noted that the administration of the [[Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute]], which supported Viatrovich's work with Lebed's archives,  "have good reason to ponder the implication of associating Harvard University with this sort of activism".&lt;ref name=warfare379 /&gt;

== Viatrovych as a public figure ==
In May 2016 in ''Foreign Policy'' Josh Cohen claimed that Viatrovych was "whitewashing Ukraine's past".&lt;ref&gt;Josh Cohen, "The historian whitewashing Ukraine's past", ''Foreign Policy'', 2 May 2016 [https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/05/02/the-historian-whitewashing-ukraines-past-volodymyr-viatrovych/]&lt;/ref&gt; In a reply published some weeks later Viatrovych assured Cohen and readers of ''Foreign Policy'' that Ukraine's history "was in good hands".&lt;ref&gt;Volodymyr Viatrovych, "Ukraine's history is in good hands", ''Foreign Policy'', 17 June 2016 [https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/06/17/ukraines-history-is-in-good-hands-viatrovych/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Viatrovych is responsible for an exhumation ban.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/461358.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rp.pl/Polityka/310269815-Polskie-ekshumacje-wciaz-zakazane.html&amp;cid=44&amp;template=restricted]&lt;/ref&gt; Ukraine doesn't study crime evudences and bans any such research even after 75 years.

In [[United Kingdom|British]] [[archaeology]] a '''Watching Brief''' is a method of preserving archaeological remains by record in the face of development threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|pages=38–}}&lt;/ref&gt; An archaeologist is employed by the developer to monitor the excavation of foundation and service trenches, [[landscaping]] and any other intrusive work. The developer undertakes to give the archaeologist sufficient time to identify and record any archaeological finds and features; however, the arrangement is rarely satisfactory for either party.

It is often difficult, both intellectually and physically, to identify archaeological features in narrow foundation trenches and the potential delay to a project can also be difficult for a developer to incorporate into a development programme. Prior evaluation through [[trial trenching]] can overcome these problems by having the archaeology examined and removed or preserved before groundworks commence.

Defined by the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists (CIfA) as: “…a formal programme of observation and investigation conducted during any operation carried out for non-archaeological reasons. This will be within a specified area or site on land, inter-tidal zone or underwater, where there is a possibility that archaeological deposits may be disturbed or destroyed. The programme will result in the preparation of a report and ordered archive.” (IFA rev.1999)
The purpose of an Archaeological Watching Brief is similarly defined by the CIfA and is: “to allow, within the resources available, the preservation by record of archaeological deposits, their presence and nature of which could not be established (or established with sufficient accuracy) in advance of development or other potentially disruptive works.”

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1548">'''Zahir al-Din Mar'ashi''' ({{lang-fa|ظهیرالدین مرعشی}}) was a [[Persian people|Persian]] commander, diplomat and historian. He is the author of several books on the history of [[Tabarestan]]. He was born in 812 AH (1412 AD) and died after 894 AH (1489 AD). He was from [[Marashis|Mar'ashi family]], an originally [[seyyed]] family in [[Tabarestan]] who dominated the region from the later 8th/14th century until the province's incorporation into [[Safavid Empire]] by [[Abbas I of Persia]] in 1005/1596. He stemmed from the main branch of Mar'ashis, that of Kamal al-Din ibn Kiwan al-Din. He owned states at Bazargah at Gilan and was employed by Sultan Muhammad II of Kar Kia line in Gilan and then by his son an successor Mirza Ali. He was sent to resolve militarily a succession dispute in adjacent Rustamdar and he led other expeditions, including an unsuccessful siege of Nur in 868/1463.&lt;ref name="eoi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pellat|first1=prepared by a number of leading orientalists ; edited by ...
