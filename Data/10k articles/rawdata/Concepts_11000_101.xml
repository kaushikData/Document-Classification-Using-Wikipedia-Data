The 14th Dalai Lama was born in [[Taktser]], [[Amdo]], [[Tibet]],  and was selected as the [[tulku]] of the [[13th Dalai Lama]] in 1937 and formally recognized as the 14th Dalai Lama at a public declaration near the town of Bumchen in 1939.&lt;ref name="dlce"&gt;{{cite web |title = Chronology of Events |url = http://www.dalailama.com/biography/chronology-of-events|website=The 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet |publisher = Office of the Dalai Lama |accessdate = 29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His enthronement ceremony as the Dalai Lama was held in Lhasa on 22 February 1940, and he eventually assumed full temporal (political) duties on 17 November 1950, at the age of 15, after [[Battle of Chamdo|the People's Republic of China's incorporation of Tibet]].&lt;ref name="dlce" /&gt; The Gelug school's government administered an area roughly corresponding to the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] just as the nascent PRC wished to assert control over it.

The eldest was his sister Tsering Dolma, eighteen years his senior. His eldest brother, [[Thupten Jigme Norbu]], had been recognised at the age of eight as the reincarnation of the high [[Lama]] [[Taktser Rinpoche]]. His sister, [[Jetsun Pema (activist)|Jetsun Pema]], spent most of her adult life on the [[Tibetan Children's Villages]] project. The Dalai Lama has said that his first language was "a broken [[Xining]] language which was (a [[varieties of Chinese|dialect of]]) the [[Chinese language]]", a form of [[Central Plains Mandarin]], and his family did not speak the [[Amdo Tibetan language|Tibetan language]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Laird, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NH5vuMA7LYcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=%22broken%20Chinese%20regional%20dialect%22&amp;f=false ''The Story of Tibet: Conversations With the Dalai Lama''], p. 262 (2007) "At that time in my village", he said, "we spoke a broken Chinese.

The Dalai Lama and his family didn't learn Tibetan until they moved to Lhasa in 1939."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dalai Lama boy.jpg|thumb|left|The Dalai Lama as a boy]]

Following reported signs and visions, three search teams were sent out to the north-east, the east, and the south-east to locate the new [[incarnation]] when the boy who was to become the 14th Dalai Lama was about two years old.&lt;ref name=bell397&gt;Bell 1946, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir Basil Gould]], British delegate to Lhasa in 1936, related his account of the north-eastern team to Sir [[Charles Alfred Bell]], former British resident in Lhasa and friend of the 13th Dalai Lama. Amongst other omens, the head of the embalmed body of the [[thirteenth Dalai Lama]], at first facing south-east, had turned to face the north-east, indicating, it was interpreted, the direction in which his successor would be found. The [[Regent]], [[Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen|Reting Rinpoche]], shortly afterwards had a [[vision (religion)|vision]] at the sacred lake of [[Lhamo La-tso]] which he interpreted as Amdo being the region to search. This vision was also interpreted to refer to a large monastery with a gilded roof and turquoise tiles, and a twisting path from it to a hill to the east, opposite which stood a small house with distinctive eaves. The team, led by Kewtsang [[Rinpoche]], went first to meet the [[Thubten Choekyi Nyima, 9th Panchen Lama|Panchen Lama]], who had been stuck in [[Jyekundo]], in northern Kham.&lt;ref name=bell397 /&gt; The Panchen Lama had been investigating births of unusual children in the area ever since the death of the 13th Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name="Laird 2006, p. 265"&gt;Laird 2006, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; He gave Kewtsang the names of three boys whom he had discovered and identified as candidates. Within a year the Panchen Lama had died. Two of his three candidates were crossed off the list but the third, a "fearless" child, the most promising, was from Taktser village, which, as in the vision, was on a hill, at the end of a trail leading to Taktser from the great [[Kumbum Monastery]] with its gilded, turquoise roof. There they found a house, as interpreted from the vision—the house where Lhamo Dhondup lived.&lt;ref name=bell397 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laird 2006, p. 265" /&gt;

According to the 14th Dalai Lama, at the time the village of [[Taktser]] stood right on the "real border" between the region of [[Amdo]] and China.&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2006, pp. 262–263.&lt;/ref&gt; When the team visited, posing as pilgrims, its leader, a Sera Lama, pretended to be the servant and sat separately in the kitchen. He held an old [[Buddhist prayer beads|rosary]] that had belonged to the 13th Dalai Lama, and the boy Lhamo Dhondup, aged two, approached and asked for it. The monk said "if you know who I am, you can have it." The child said "Sera Lama, Sera Lama" and spoke with him in a Lhasa accent, in a dialect the boy's mother could not understand. The next time the party returned to the house, they revealed their real purpose and asked permission to subject the boy to certain tests. One test consisted of showing him various pairs of objects, one of which had belonged to the [[13th Dalai Lama]] and one which had not. In every case, he chose the Dalai Lama's own objects and rejected the others.&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2006, pp. 265–266.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it was the Panchen Lama who first discovered and identified the 14th Dalai Lama.

From 1936 the Hui '[[Ma Clique]]' Muslim warlord [[Ma Bufang]] ruled [[Qinghai]] as its governor under the nominal authority of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] central government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drGGEsi1fFEC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=ma+bufang+paintings&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3I_lTbDEK8LOgAfQ67nGBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=ma%20bufang%20paintings&amp;f=false|title=Beyond the Great Wall: urban form and transformation on the Chinese frontiers|author=Piper Rae Gaubatz|year=1996|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|location=|page=36|isbn=0-8047-2399-0|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an interview with the 14th Dalai Lama, in the 1930s, Ma Bufang had seized this north-east corner of Amdo in the name of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s weak government and incorporated it into the Chinese province of [[Qinghai]].&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2006, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Before going to Taktser, Kewtsang had gone to Ma Bufang to pay his respects.&lt;ref name="Laird 2006, p. 265" /&gt; When Ma Bufang heard a candidate had been found in Taktser, he had the family brought to him in Xining.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt; He first demanded proof that the boy was the Dalai Lama, but the Lhasa government, though informed by Kewtsang that this was the one, told Kewtsang to say he had to go to Lhasa for further tests with other candidates. They knew that if he was declared to be the Dalai Lama, the Chinese government would insist on sending a large army escort with him, which would then stay in Lhasa and refuse to budge.&lt;ref name=bell398&gt;Bell 1946, p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; Ma Bufang, together with Kumbum Monastery, then refused to allow him to depart unless he was declared to be the Dalai Lama, but withdrew this demand in return for 100,000 Chinese dollars ransom in silver to be shared amongst them, to let them go to Lhasa.&lt;ref name=bell398 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1984, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Kewtsang managed to raise this, but the family was only allowed to move from Xining to Kumbum when a further demand was made for another 330,000 dollars ransom: one hundred thousand each for government officials, the commander-in-chief, and the Kumbum Monastery; twenty thousand for the escort; and only ten thousand for Ma Bufang himself, he said.&lt;ref&gt;Bell 1946, pp. 398–399.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years of diplomatic wrangling followed before it was accepted by Lhasa that the ransom had to be paid to avoid the Chinese getting involved and escorting him to Lhasa with a large army.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1984, pp. 152–153.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the boy was kept at Kumbum where two of his brothers were already studying as monks and recognised incarnate lamas.&lt;ref name=laird267&gt;Laird 2006, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; The payment of 300,000 silver dollars was then advanced by Muslim traders en route to Mecca in a large caravan via Lhasa. They paid Ma Bufang on behalf of the Tibetan government against promissory notes to be redeemed, with interest, in Lhasa.&lt;ref name=laird267 /&gt;&lt;ref name=rich153&gt;Richardson 1984, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The 20,000-dollar fee for an escort was dropped, since the Muslim merchants invited them to join their caravan for protection; Ma Bufang sent 20 of his soldiers with them and was paid from both sides since the Chinese government granted him another 50,000 dollars for the expenses of the journey. Furthermore, the Indian government helped the Tibetans raise the ransom funds by affording them import concessions.&lt;ref name=rich153 /&gt;

Released from Kumbum, on 21 July 1939 the party travelled across Tibet in an epic journey to Lhasa in the large Muslim caravan with Lhamo Thondup, now 4 years old, riding with his brother Lobsang in a special palanquin carried by two mules, two years after being discovered. As soon as they were out of Ma Bufang's area, he was officially declared to be the 14th Dalai Lama by the Central Government of Tibet, and after ten weeks of travel he arrived in Lhasa on 8 October 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2006, pp. 268–269.&lt;/ref&gt; The ordination ([[pabbajja]]) and giving of the monastic name of Tenzin Gyatso were handled by [[Reting Rinpoche]]. There was very limited Chinese involvement at this time.&lt;ref name="Banyan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21646795-even-china-accepts-only-dalai-lama-can-legitimise-its-rule-tibet-golden-urn|title=The Golden Urn: Even China Accepts That Only the Dalai Lama Can Legitimise Its Rule in Tibet|last=Banyan|website=The Economist|date=19 March 2015|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] normally refer to him as Yishin Norbu (''Wish-Fulfilling Gem''), Kyabgon (''Saviour''), or just Kundun (''Presence''). His devotees, as well as much of the Western world, often call him ''His Holiness the Dalai Lama'', the [[style (manner of address)|style]] employed on the Dalai Lama's website. According to the Dalai Lama, he had a succession of tutors in Tibet including [[Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen|Reting Rinpoche]], Tathag Rinpoche, [[Ling Rinpoche]] and lastly [[Trijang Rinpoche]], who became junior tutor when he was nineteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lama|first1=Dalai |title = Freedom in Exile: The Autobiography of the Dalai Lama. |date = 1990 |publisher = HarperCollins|location=New York, NY |ISBN = 0-06-039116-2 |page = 18|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 11 he met the [[Austrians|Austrian]] mountaineer [[Heinrich Harrer]], who became his [[videographer]] and tutor about the world outside [[Lhasa]].

In 1959, at the age of 23, he took his final examination at [[Lhasa]]'s [[Jokhang]] Temple during the annual [[Monlam]] or Prayer Festival.

Historically the Dalai Lamas or their [[regent]]s held political and religious leadership over [[Tibet]] from [[Lhasa]] with varying degrees of influence depending on the regions of Tibet and periods of history. This began with the [[5th Dalai Lama]]'s rule in 1642 and lasted until the 1950s (except for 1705–1750), during which period the Dalai Lamas headed the Tibetan government or [[Ganden Phodrang]]. Until 1912 however, when the [[13th Dalai Lama]] declared the complete independence of [[Tibet (1912–1951)|Tibet]], their rule was generally subject to [[priest and patron|patronage and protection]] of firstly Mongol kings (1642–1720) and then the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-led [[Qing dynasty]] (1720–1912).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Smith, Warren W. Jr.|title=Tibetan Nation: A History of Tibetan Nationalism and Sino-Tibetan Relations|date=1997|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New Delhi|isbn=0-8133-3155-2|pages=107–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, at the age of four, the present Dalai Lama was taken in a procession of lamas to Lhasa. The Dalai Lama's childhood was then spent between the [[Potala Palace]] and [[Norbulingka]], his summer residence, both of which are now [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage sites]].

China claims that the [[Kuomintang]] government ratified the 14th Dalai Lama and that a Kuomintang representative, General [[Wu Zhongxin]], presided over the ceremony. The British Representative [[Basil Gould|Sir Basil Gould]] was also at the ceremony and bore witness to the falsity of the Chinese claim to have presided over it. He criticised the Chinese account as follows: 
{{quote|The report was issued in the Chinese Press that Mr Wu had escorted the Dalai Lama to his throne and announced his installation, that the Dalai Lama had returned thanks, and prostrated himself in token of his gratitude. Every one of these Chinese claims was false. Mr Wu was merely a passive spectator. He did no more than present a ceremonial scarf, as was done by the others, including the British Representative. But the Chinese have the ear of the world, and can later refer to their press records and present an account of historical events that is wholly untrue. Tibet has no newspapers, either in English or Tibetan, and has therefore no means of exposing these falsehoods.&lt;ref&gt;Bell 1946, p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tibetan scholar Nyima Gyaincain wrote that based on Tibetan tradition, there was no such thing as presiding over an event, but two things are clear, first, the word "主持 (preside or organize)" was used in many places in communication documents. The meaning of the word was different than what we understand today. Second, [[Wu Zhongxin]] spent a lot of time and energy on the event, his effect of presiding over or organizing the event was very obvious.&lt;ref name="王家伟尼玛坚赞1997_preside"&gt;{{cite book|author1=王家伟|author2=尼玛坚赞|title=中国西藏的历史地位|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eWCa0NSILSsC&amp;pg=PA133|year=1997|publisher=五洲传播出版社|isbn=978-7-80113-303-8|pages=133–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Goldstein:

In October 1950 the army of the [[People's Republic of China]] marched to the edge of the Dalai Lama's territory and sent a delegation after defeating a legion of the Tibetan army in [[warlord]]-controlled [[Kham]]. On 17 November 1950, at the age of 15, the 14th Dalai Lama was enthroned formally as the temporal ruler of Tibet.

=== Cooperation and conflicts with the People's Republic of China ===

Panchen Lama and Dalai Lama had many conflicts in Tibetan history. Dalai Lama's formal rule was brief. He sent a delegation to Beijing, which, without his authorization,&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; ratified the [[Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso, Tenzin, Dalai Lama XIV, interview, 25 July 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Melvyn C., ''A History of Modern Tibet, 1913–1951'', University of California Press, 1989, pp. 812–813.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked with the Chinese government: in September 1954, together with the [[10th Panchen Lama]] he went to the Chinese capital to meet [[Mao Zedong]] and attend the first session of the [[National People's Congress]] as a delegate, primarily discussing [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|China's constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, M.C., ''A History of Modern Tibet, Volume 2 – The Calm before the Storm: 1951–1955'', p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-08/30/content_3422747.htm Ngapoi recalls the founding of the TAR]'', [[Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme]], ''[[China View]]'', 30 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 September 1954, the Dalai Lama was selected as a [[Vice Chairperson of the National People's Congress|Vice chairman]] of the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Standing Committee]] of the [[National People's Congress]],&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, M.C., ''A History of Modern Tibet, Volume 2 – The Calm before the Storm: 1951–1955'', p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voyage.typepad.com/china/2007/01/chairman_mao_lo.html |title=Chairman Mao: Long Live Dalai Lama! |publisher=Voyage.typepad.com |date=21 January 2007 |accessdate=2 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505143746/http://voyage.typepad.com/china/2007/01/chairman_mao_lo.html |archivedate=5 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a post he officially held until 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90883/6284184.html |title = Official: Dalai Lama's U.S. award not to affect Tibet's stability |date = 2007-10-16 |accessdate = 28 August 2010 |publisher = [[People's Daily]]|work=[[17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, on a trip to India to celebrate the [[Buddha's Birthday]], the Dalai Lama asked the [[Prime Minister of India]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], if he would allow him [[political asylum]] should he choose to stay. Nehru discouraged this as a provocation against peace, and reminded him of the Indian Government's [[Non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] stance agreed upon with its [[Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence|1954 treaty with China]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

=== Exile to India ===

[[File:IMG 1206 Lhasa Potala.jpg|thumb|left|Abandoned former quarters of the Dalai Lama at the Potala. The empty vestment placed on the throne symbolises his absence]]

At the outset of the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]], fearing for his life, the Dalai Lama and his retinue fled Tibet with the help of the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]],&lt;ref&gt;The CIA's Secret War in Tibet, Kenneth Conboy, James Morrison, The University Press of Kansas, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; crossing into India on 30 March 1959, reaching [[Tezpur]] in [[Assam]] on 18 April.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson (1984), p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Some time later he set up the [[Government of Tibet in Exile]] in [[Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamshala]], India,&lt;ref&gt;"Witness: Reporting on the Dalai Lama's escape to India."

After the founding of the government in exile he re-established the approximately 80,000 Tibetan refugees who followed him into exile in agricultural settlements.&lt;ref name="bbcprofile" /&gt; He created a Tibetan educational system in order to teach the Tibetan children the [[Tibetic languages|language]], [[History of Tibet|history]], [[Tibetan Buddhism|religion]], and [[Tibet#Culture|culture]]. The [[Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts]] was established&lt;ref name="bbcprofile" /&gt; in 1959 and the [[Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies]]&lt;ref name="bbcprofile" /&gt; became the primary university for Tibetans in India in 1967. He supported the refounding of 200 monasteries and nunneries in an attempt to preserve Tibetan Buddhist teachings and the Tibetan way of life.

The Dalai Lama appealed to the [[United Nations]] on the rights of Tibetans. This appeal resulted in three resolutions adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] in 1959, 1961, and 1965,&lt;ref name="bbcprofile" /&gt; all before the People's Republic [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|was allowed representation at the United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/12295509436546-1/ |title=Events of 1971 |work=Year in Review |year=1971 |publisher=United Press International |accessdate=28 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gYCuqxqS?url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/12295509436546-1/ |archivedate=5 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolutions called on China to respect the human rights of [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]].&lt;ref name="bbcprofile" /&gt; In 1963, he promulgated a democratic constitution which is based upon the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], creating an elected [[Parliament of the Central Tibetan Administration|parliament]] and an [[Central Tibetan Administration|administration]] to champion his cause. In 1970, he opened the [[Library of Tibetan Works and Archives]] in Dharamshala which houses over 80,000 manuscripts and important knowledge resources related to Tibetan history, politics and culture. It is considered one of the most important institutions for [[Tibetology]] in the world.&lt;ref name="LTWA"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.tibet.com/ltwa.html |title = Library of Tibetan Works and Archives|year=1997 |publisher = [[Government of Tibet in Exile]] |accessdate = 23 September 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080421150024/http://www.tibet.com/ltwa.html |archivedate=21 April 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, there were demands from Indian politicians of different political parties and citizens to confer His Holiness The Dalai Lama the prestigious [[Bharat Ratna]], the highest civilian honour of India which has only been awarded to a Non-Indian citizen twice in its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Bharat-Ratna-demanded-for-Dalai-Lama/articleshow/55877372.cms|title=Bharat Ratna demanded for Dalai Lama – Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International advocacy ===

At the [[Congressional Human Rights Caucus]] in 1987 in [[Washington, D.C.]], the Dalai Lama gave a speech outlining his ideas for the future status of Tibet. The plan called for Tibet to become a democratic "zone of peace" without [[nuclear weapons]], and with support for [[human rights]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The plan would come to be known as the "Strasbourg proposal", because the Dalai Lama expanded on the plan at [[Strasbourg]] on 15 June 1988. There, he proposed the creation of a self-governing Tibet "in association with the People's Republic of China." This would have been pursued by negotiations with the PRC government, but the plan was rejected by the Tibetan Government-in-Exile in 1991. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The Dalai Lama has indicated that he wishes to return to Tibet only if the People's Republic of China agrees not to make any precondition for his return.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/05/china.lukeharding Interview] with ''[[The Guardian]]'', 5 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, the then-[[Paramount leader]] [[Deng Xiaoping]] set China's sole return requirement to the Dalai Lama as that he "must [come back] as a Chinese citizen  ... that is, patriotism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/01/content_10921943_3.htm |title = Origin of the title of "Dalai Lama" and its related background |date = 2009-03-01 |accessdate = 28 August 2010 |first=Jiang|last=Yuxia |publisher = [[Xinhua]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dalai Lama celebrated his seventieth birthday on 6 July 2005. About 10,000 Tibetan refugees, monks and foreign tourists gathered outside his home. [[Patriarch Alexius II]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] alleged positive relations with Buddhists. However, later that year, the Russian state prevented the Dalai Lama from fulfilling an invitation to the traditionally Buddhist republic of [[Kalmykia]].&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, Geraldine.

The Dalai Lama is an advocate for a world free of nuclear weapons, and currently serves on the Advisory Council of the [[Nuclear Age Peace Foundation]].

The Dalai Lama has voiced his support for the [[Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.unpacampaign.org/supporters/overview/?mapcountry=allnob&amp;mapgroup=nob|title=Overview|date=|work=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

Giving [[public talks]] for non-Buddhist audiences and interviews and teaching Buddhism to large public audiences all over the world, as well as to private groups at his residence in India, appears to be the Dalai Lama's main activity.&lt;ref name="Schedule"&gt;{{cite web |title = Schedule |url = http://www.dalailama.com/teachings/schedule |publisher = Office of the Dalai Lama |accessdate = 19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite becoming 80 years old in 2015 he maintains a busy international lectures and teaching schedule.&lt;ref name="Schedule" /&gt; His [[public talks]] and [[teachings]] are usually [[webcast]] live in multiple languages, via an inviting organisation's [[website]], or on the Dalai Lama's own website.

In Dalai Lama's essay, "The Ethic of Compassion" (1999), he expresses his belief that if we only reserve compassion for those that we love, we are ignoring the responsibility of sharing these characteristics of respect and empathy with those we do not have relationships with, which cannot allow us to "cultivate love." He elaborates upon this idea by writing that although it takes time to develop a higher level of compassion, eventually we will recognize that the quality of empathy will become a part of life and promote our quality as humans and inner strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dalai Lama XIV|title="The Ethic of Compassion."|date=1999|publisher=Riverhead Books|pages=123–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As examples of other teachings, in London in 1984 he was invited to give teachings on the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising, and on [[Dzogchen]], which he gave at Camden Town Hall; in 1988 he was in London once more to give a series of lectures on Tibetan Buddhism in general, called 'A Survey of the Paths of Tibetan Buddhism'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = A Survey of the Paths of Tibetan Buddhism |url = http://www.lamayeshe.com/index.php?sect=article&amp;id=421 |publisher = Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive |accessdate = 18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again in London in 1996 he taught the [[Four Noble Truths]], the basis and foundation of Buddhism accepted by all Buddhists, at the combined invitation of 27 different Buddhist organisations of all schools and traditions belonging to the Network of Buddhist Organisations UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Tseten Samdup |title = His Holiness the Dalai Lama will visit the UK from July 15–22 1996 |url = http://www.tibet.ca/en/library/wtn/archive/old?y=1996&amp;m=7&amp;p=7_2 |publisher = World Tibet Network News |date = 7 July 1996 |quote = For the first time in the West, His Holiness the Dalai Lama will give two exclusive days of teaching on 17 and 18 July 1996 on the Four Noble Truths – the heart of the Buddha's teachings.

=== Interfaith dialogue ===

The Dalai Lama met [[Pope Paul VI]] at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] in 1973. He met [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1980, 1982, 1986, 1988, 1990, and 2003. In 1990, he met a delegation of Jewish teachers in Dharamshala for an extensive interfaith dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Kamenetz, Rodger (1994)[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060645741 The Jew in the Lotus] Harper Collins: 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; He has since visited Israel three times, and in 2006 met the Chief Rabbi of Israel. In 2006, he met [[Pope Benedict XVI]] privately. He has met the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], Dr. [[Robert Runcie]], and other leaders of the Anglican Church in London, [[Gordon B. Hinckley]], who at the time was the president of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons), as well as senior [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Muslim]], [[Hindu]], [[Jewish]], and [[Sikh]] officials.
The Dalai Lama is also currently a member of the Board of World Religious Leaders as part of [[The Elijah Interfaith Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.elijah-interfaith.org/?id=729 |title = The Elijah Interfaith Institute – Buddhist Members of the Board of World Religious Leaders |publisher = Elijah-interfaith.org |date = 2006-12-24 |accessdate = 17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and participated in the Third Meeting of the Board of World Religious Leaders in [[Amritsar]], India, on 26 November 2007 to discuss the topic of Love and Forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elijah-interfaith.org/programs/board-of-world-religious-leaders/third-meeting-of-the-bwrl.html |title=Third Meeting of the Board of World Religious Leaders |publisher=Elijah-interfaith.org |date=2013-04-07 |accessdate=17 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227160915/https://www.elijah-interfaith.org/programs/board-of-world-religious-leaders/third-meeting-of-the-bwrl.html |archivedate=27 December 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 2009, the Dalai Lama inaugurated an [[interfaith]] "World Religions-Dialogue and Symphony" conference at [[Gujarat]]'s [[Mahuva (Bhavnagar district)|Mahuva]] religions", according to [[Morari Bapu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.indianexpress.com/news/dalai-Lama-inaugurates-6day-world-religions-.../407503 |title = Dalai Lama inaugurates 6-day world religions meet at Mahua |publisher = Indianexpress.com |date = 7 January 2009 |accessdate = 2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Canada Tibet Committee |url = http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/5137 |title = Dalai Lama to inaugurate inter-faith conference |publisher = Tibet.ca |accessdate = 2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 May 2010 the Dalai Lama, joined by a panel of select scholars, officially launched the [[Common Ground Project]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://islambuddhism.com/ |title = Islam and Buddhism |publisher = Islambuddhism.com |date = 2010-05-12 |accessdate = 17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Bloomington, Indiana]] (USA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://islambuddhism.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=22:dalai-lama-muslim-leaders-seek-peace-in-bloomington&amp;catid=6:in-the-news&amp;Itemid=4 |title = Dalai Lama, Muslim Leaders Seek Peace in Bloomington |publisher = Islambuddhism.com |date = 2010-05-31 |accessdate = 17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was planned by himself and [[Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad]] of [[Jordan]] during several years of personal conversations.

His growing wish to develop meaningful scientific dialogue to explore the [[Buddhism and science]] interface led to invitations for him to attend relevant conferences on his visits to the west, including the [[Alpbach]] Symposia on Consciousness in 1983 where he met and had discussions with the late Chilean neuroscientist [[Francisco J.

Apart from time spent teaching Buddhism and fulfilling responsibilities to his Tibetan followers, the Dalai Lama has probably spent, and continues to spend, more of his time and resources investigating the interface between [[Buddhism and science]] through the ongoing series of [[Mind and Life Institute|Mind and Life]] dialogues and its spin-offs than on any other single activity.&lt;ref name=Grnd /&gt; As the Institute's Cofounder and the Honorary chairman he has personally presided over and participated in all its dialogues, which continue to expand worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Dialogues with the Dalai Lama |url = https://www.mindandlife.org/dialogues-dalai-lama/ |publisher = Mind and Life Institute |accessdate = 6 May 2015 |quote = These Dialogues will expand as Mind and Life grows to include Europe, Asia, and beyond}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These activities have given rise to dozens of DVD sets of the dialogues and books he has authored on them such as '''Ethics for the New Millennium''' and '''The Universe in a Single Atom''', as well as scientific papers and university research programmes.&lt;ref name=pdf&gt;{{cite web |title = A 25 Years History of Accomplishment |url = https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gns1ff0ziu9ikx3/AAAH3rqan1jP_RyksNVOYl0Da/MLI%2025%20years%20of%20Accomplishment.pdf?dl=0 |publisher = Mind and Life Institute |accessdate = 6 May 2015|format=PDF |date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the Tibetan and Buddhist side, science subjects have been added to the curriculum for Tibetan monastic educational institutions and scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dalai Lama and Western Science |url=http://www.investigatingthemind.org/hhdl.science.html |publisher=Mind and Life Institute |accessdate=6 May 2015 |quote=he has led a campaign to introduce basic science education in Tibetan Buddhist monastic colleges and academic centers, and has encouraged Tibetan scholars to engage with science as a way of revitalizing the Tibetan philosophical tradition |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219190156/http://investigatingthemind.org/hhdl.science.html |archivedate=19 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the Western side, university and research programmes initiated by these dialogues and funded with millions of dollars in grants from the Dalai Lama Trust include the Emory-Tibet Partnership,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emory-Tibet Science Initiative receives $1&amp;nbsp;million grant from Dalai Lama Trust |url=https://tibet.emory.edu/news-and-media/news/2014/emory-tibet-science-initiative-receives-1-million-grant-from-dalai-lama-trust/index.html |publisher=Emory University |location=Georgia, USA |date=2014 |quote=For more than 30 years I have been engaged in an ongoing exchange with scientists, exploring what modern scientific knowledge and time-honored science of mind embodied by the Tibetan tradition can bring to each other's understanding of reality |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518083919/https://tibet.emory.edu/news-and-media/news/2014/emory-tibet-science-initiative-receives-1-million-grant-from-dalai-lama-trust/index.html |archivedate=18 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanford School of Medicine]]'s Centre for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education (CCARES)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = His Holiness the XIVth Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso Founding Patron, CCARE |url = http://ccare.stanford.edu/about/people/patron-committee/#150 |publisher = Stanford University School of Medicine |accessdate = 7 May 2015|location=Palo Alto, California |quote = He has been a strong supporter of the neurosciences for over two decades.

In particular, the Mind and Life Education Humanities &amp; Social Sciences initiatives have been instrumental in developing the emerging field of Contemplative Science, by researching, for example, the effects of contemplative practice on the human brain, behaviour and biology.&lt;ref name="pdf" /&gt;

In his 2005 book ''The Universe in a Single Atom'' and elsewhere, and to mark his commitment to scientific truth and its ultimate ascendancy over religious belief, unusually for a major religious leader the Dalai Lama advises his Buddhist followers: "If scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in Buddhism to be false, then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lama|first1=Dalai |title = The Universe in a Single Atom |date = 2005 |publisher = Random House|location=New York |ISBN =978-0-375-72845-7 |page = 3|edition=First Large Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also cited examples of archaic Buddhist ideas he has abandoned himself on this basis.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=James Kingsland |title = Dalai Lama enlightens and enraptures contemplative scientists in Boston |url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2014/nov/03/dalai-lama-scientists-boston-international-symposium-contemplative-studies |publisher = The Guardian|location=Boston, USA |date = 3 November 2014 |quote = He   ... had long since abandoned Buddhist ideas about cosmology after reading about the findings of modern astronomers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These activities have even had an impact in the Chinese capital. In 2013 an 'academic dialogue' with a Chinese scientist, a Tibetan 'living Buddha' and a Professor of Religion took place in Beijing. Entitled "High-end dialogue: ancient Buddhism and modern science" it addressed the same considerations that interest the Dalai Lama, described as 'discussing about the similarities between Buddhism and modern science'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lethe Guo |title=High-end dialogue: ancient Buddhism and modern science |url=http://eng.tibet.cn/2010zj/zjhd/201312/t20131219_1960457.html |publisher=China Tibet Online |date=18 December 2013 |quote=crossover between Buddhism and science has become a hot topic in the academic and cultural circles over the recent decades |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005160313/http://eng.tibet.cn/2010zj/zjhd/201312/t20131219_1960457.html |archivedate=5 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abortion ===

The Dalai Lama has shown a nuanced position on [[abortion]]. He explained that, from the perspective of the Buddhist precepts, abortion is an act of killing.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Stivers [https://web.archive.org/web/20081025010504/http://www.sunvalleyonline.com/news/article.asp?ID_Article=1146 Dalai Lama meets Idaho’s religious leaders], sunvalleyonline.com, 15 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He has also clarified that in certain cases abortion could be considered ethically acceptable "if the unborn child will be retarded or if the birth will create serious problems for the parent", which could only be determined on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Claudia Dreifus]] |work=New York Times |date=28 November 1993 |url=http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/archive/old?y=1993&amp;m=12&amp;p=5_1 |title=New York Times Interview with the Dalai Lama |accessdate=31 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gQKhCcto?url=http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/archive/old?y=1993&amp;m=12&amp;p=5_1 |archivedate=30 April 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Democracy, nonviolence, religious harmony, and Tibet's relationship with India ===

[[File:Vienna 2012-05-26 - Europe for Tibet Solidarity Rally 194 HH sequence s.jpg|thumb|Tenzin Gyatso in Vienna, Austria, in&amp;nbsp;2012]]

The Dalai Lama says that he is active in spreading India's message of [[nonviolence]] and religious harmony throughout the world. "I am the messenger of India's ancient thoughts the world over." He has said that democracy has deep roots in India. He says he considers India the master and Tibet its disciple, as great scholars went from India to Tibet to teach Buddhism. He has noted that millions of people lost their lives in violence and the economies of many countries were ruined due to conflicts in the 20th century. "Let the 21st century be a century of tolerance and dialogue."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/im-messenger-of-indias-ancient-thoughts-dalai-lama/541448 I'm messenger of India's ancient thoughts: Dalai Lama], [https://archive.is/20120903155544/http://www.hindustantimes.com/rssfeed/arunachalpradesh/I-m-messenger-of-India-s-ancient-thoughts-the-Dalai-Lama/Article1-476436.aspx I'm messenger of India's ancient thoughts: The Dalai Lama – Hindustan Times], [http://content.usatoday.com/topics/quote/Religion+and+beliefs/Leaders,+Experts/Dalai+Lama/07vj4sKh2wbTR/06zWaNQ1qJ3u0/1 Dalai Lama Story Page – USATODAY.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003140427/http://content.usatoday.com/topics/quote/Religion+and+beliefs/Leaders,+Experts/Dalai+Lama/07vj4sKh2wbTR/06zWaNQ1qJ3u0/1 |date=3 October 2012 }}, [http://tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/7998 Canada Tibet Committee|Newsroom|WTN] "I'm messenger of India's ancient thoughts": Dalai Lama; 14 November 2009; Itanagar.

In 2001, he answered the question of a girl in a [[Seattle]] school by saying that it is permissible to shoot someone with a gun in self-defense if that person was "trying to kill you," and he emphasized that the shot should not be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernton|first=Hal |url = http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=dalai15m0&amp;date=20010515 |title = Dalai Lama urges students to shape the world |publisher = Archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com |date = 15 May 2001 |accessdate = 2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, the Dalai Lama openly criticised Buddhist monks' [[2013 Burma anti-Muslim riots|attacks on Muslims]] in [[Myanmar]] "Buddha always teaches us about forgiveness, tolerance, compassion. If from one corner of your mind, some emotion makes you want to hit, or want to kill, then please remember Buddha's faith. We are followers of Buddha." He said that "All problems must be solved through dialogue, through talk.

In response to the death of [[China|Chinese]] [[2010 Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Liu Xiaobo]], who died of organ failure while in government custody, the Dalai Lama issued the following statement on 14 July 2017, "I am deeply saddened to learn that fellow Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo has passed away while undergoing a lengthy prison sentence  ... It is my belief that Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo's unceasing efforts in the cause of freedom will bear fruit before long."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.dalailama.com/news/2017/message-from-his-holiness-the-dalai-lama His Holiness the Dalai Lama Deeply Saddened by Liu Xiaobo's Passing…"].

=== Diet and animal welfare ===
{{quote|People think of animals as if they were vegetables, and that is not right. We have to change the way people think about animals.

The Dalai Lama advocates compassion for animals and frequently urges people to try [[vegetarianism]] or at least reduce their consumption of meat. In Tibet, where historically meat was the most common food, most monks historically have been [[omnivore]]s, including the Dalai Lamas. The Fourteenth Dalai Lama was raised in a meat-eating family but converted to vegetarianism after arriving in India, where vegetables are much more easily available. He spent many years as a [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]], but after contracting [[hepatitis]] in India and suffering from weakness, his doctors ordered him to eat meat on alternating days, which he did for several years. He tried switching back to a vegetarian diet, but once again returned to limited consumption of meat. This attracted public attention when, during a visit to the White House, he was offered a vegetarian menu but declined by replying, as he is known to do on occasion when dining in the company of non-vegetarians, "I'm a Tibetan monk, not a vegetarian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Iyer |first=Pico |title=The Open Road: The Global Journey of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama |publisher=Knopf Publishing Group |date=2008 |page=203 |url=https://books.google.co.za/books?id=ExP5VoHTyzgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His own home kitchen, however, is completely vegetarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.shabkar.org/teachers/tibetanbuddhism/dalai_lama.htm |title = H.H.

=== Economics ===
The Dalai Lama has referred to himself as a [[Marxism|Marxist]] and has articulated [[Criticism of capitalism|criticisms of capitalism]].&lt;ref name="angrymarxist"&gt;{{cite web |title = The (Justifiably) Angry Marxist: An interview with the Dalai Lama |url = http://www.tricycle.com/blog/justifiably-angry-marxist-interview-dalai-lama |publisher = [[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review]] |accessdate = 6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardMarx" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Phillips (15 January 2015).

He reports hearing of [[communism]] when he was very young, but only in the context of the destruction of [[Mongolian People's Republic|Communist Mongolia]].

{{quote|Of all the modern economic theories, the economic system of [[Marxism]] is founded on moral principles, while [[capitalism]] is concerned only with gain and profitability. Marxism is concerned with the distribution of wealth on an equal basis and the equitable utilisation of the [[means of production]].

The Dalai Lama is outspoken in his concerns about [[environmental problem]]s, frequently giving public talks on themes related to the environment.

A monk since childhood, the Dalai Lama has said that sex offers fleeting satisfaction and leads to trouble later, while chastity offers a better life and "more independence, more freedom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/World/News/Dalai-Lama-Sex-spells-trouble-20081128 |title=Dalai Lama: Sex spells trouble |date=2008-11-28 |agency=[[News24.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has observed that problems arising from conjugal life sometimes even lead to suicide or murder.&lt;ref name=Teleg&gt;{{cite news |author = Published: 5:18&amp;nbsp;pm GMT 29 November 2008 |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/3534994/Sexual-intercourse-spells-trouble-says-Dalai-Lama.html |title = Sexual intercourse spells trouble, says Dalai Lama |publisher = Telegraph.co.uk |date = 29 November 2008 |accessdate = 2 May 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has asserted that all religions have the same view about adultery.&lt;ref name="foxsports1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://msn.foxsports.com/golf/story/The-Dalai-Lama-comments-on-Tiger-Woods%2527-scandal?GT1=39002 |title = The Dalai Lama comments on Tiger Woods' scandal |publisher = FOX Sports |date = 2010-02-20 |accessdate = 9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation not found}}

In his discussions of the traditional Buddhist view on appropriate sexual behavior, he explains the concept of "right organ in the right object at the right time," which historically has been interpreted as indicating that oral, manual and anal sex (both homosexual and heterosexual) are not appropriate in Buddhism or for Buddhists. However, he also says that in modern times all common, consensual sexual practices that do not cause harm to others are ethically acceptable and that society should accept and respect people who are [[gay]] or [[transgender]] from a secular point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_budd2.htm|title=Buddhism and homosexuality|website=www.religioustolerance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1994 interview with ''[[OUT Magazine]]'', the Dalai Lama clarified his personal opinion on the matter by saying, "If someone comes to me and asks whether [[homosexuality]] is okay or not, I will ask 'What is your companion's opinion?' If you both agree, then I think I would say, 'If two males or two females voluntarily agree to have mutual satisfaction without further implication of harming others, then it is okay.'"&lt;ref&gt;OUT Magazine February/March 1994&lt;/ref&gt; However, when interviewed by Canadian TV news anchor [[Evan Solomon]] on ''[[CBC News: Sunday]]'' about whether homosexuality is acceptable in Buddhism, the Dalai Lama responded that "it is sexual misconduct".&lt;ref&gt;The Huffington Post, 07/13/09, Gay Marriage: What Would Buddha Do?, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-shaheen/gay-marriage-what-would-b_b_230855.html&lt;/ref&gt; This was an echo of an earlier response in a 2004 ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'' interview when asked about homosexuality in Buddhism, where the Dalai Lama replied "for a Buddhist, the same sex, that is sexual misconduct".&lt;ref&gt;LifeSiteNews, 11/02/07/, The Dalai Lama, Like the Pope, Says Gay Sex is "Sexual Misconduct", http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/archive/ldn/2007/nov/07110208&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1996 book ''Beyond Dogma'', he described a traditional Buddhist definition of an appropriate sexual act as follows: "A sexual act is deemed proper when the couples use the organs intended for sexual intercourse and nothing else [  ... ] Homosexuality, whether it is between men or between women, is not improper in itself. What is improper is the use of organs already defined as inappropriate for sexual contact."&lt;ref&gt;Beyond Dogma by the Dalai Lama&lt;/ref&gt; He elaborated in 1997, explaining that the basis of that teaching was unknown to him. He also conveyed his own "willingness to consider the possibility that some of the teachings may be specific to a particular cultural and historic context".&lt;ref&gt;"Dalai Lama Urges 'Respect, Compassion, and Full Human Rights for All', including Gays". Conkin, Dennis. ''Bay Area Reporter'', 19 June 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dalai Lama has expressed concern at "reports of violence and discrimination against gay, [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] people" and "urges respect, tolerance and the full recognition of human rights for all".&lt;ref&gt;Press Release in WORLD, 24/04/2006, HIS HOLINESS THE DALAI LAMA ISSUES STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF HUMAN RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL AND TRANSGENDER PEOPLE, {{cite web|url=http://ilga.org/ilga/en/article/782 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623030316/http://ilga.org/ilga/en/article/782 |archivedate=23 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, he said that the next Dalai Lama could possibly be a woman, remarking "If a woman reveals herself as more useful the lama could very well be reincarnated in this form".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spencer |first=Richard |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1571850/Dalai-Lama-says-successor-could-be-a-woman.html |title = Dalai Lama says successor could be a woman |publisher = Telegraph.co.uk |date = 2007-12-07 |accessdate = 2010-11-19 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, on [[gender equality]] and sexism, the Dalai Lama proclaimed at the [[National Civil Rights Museum]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]: "I call myself a [[feminist]]. Isn't that what you call someone who fights for [[women's rights]]?" He also said that by nature, women are more compassionate "based on their biology and ability to nurture and birth children". He called on women to "lead and create a more compassionate world", citing the good works of nurses and mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tamara-conniff/the-dalai-lama-proclaims_b_297285.html |title = Tamara Conniff: The Dalai Lama Proclaims Himself a Feminist: Day Two of Peace and Music in Memphis |publisher = Huffington Post |date = 23 September 2009 |accessdate = 17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Dalai Lama attended the inauguration of the Secular Ethics for Higher Education Course at the [[Tata Institute of Social Sciences]] (TISS) in Mumbai, where he was reported to have stated that, "Since women have been shown to be more sensitive to others' suffering, their leadership may be more effective. His Holiness suggested it's time for men to withdraw and for women to step forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Secular Ethics for Higher Education |url=https://www.dalailama.com/news/2017/launch-of-tata-institute-of-social-sciences-course-in-secular-ethics-for-higher-education/amp |website=HIS HOLINESS The 14th DALAI LAMA of TIBET |publisher=THE OFFICE OF HIS HOLINESS THE DALAI LAMA |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, he said in a BBC interview that if a female succeeded him, "that female must be attractive, otherwise it is not much use," and when asked if he was joking, replied, "No. True!" He followed with a joke about his current success being due to his own appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Dalai Lama Says If Successor Is Female, She Must Be Very Attractive |url = http://www.tricycle.com/blog/dalai-lama-says-if-successor-female-she-must-be-very-attractive |publisher = [[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review]] |date = 22 September 2015 |accessdate = 24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health ===

In April 2013, at the Culture of Compassion event in Ebrington Square in [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]], the Dalai Lama asserted, stressing the importance of peace of mind: "Warm-heartedness is a key factor for healthy individuals, healthy families and healthy communities [  ... ] Scientists say that a healthy mind is a major factor for a healthy body. If you're serious about your health, think and take most concern for your peace of mind. That's very, very important."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/18/dalai-lama-culture-of-com_n_3111216.html |title = Dalai Lama 'Culture of Compassion' Talk: Key To Good Health Is 'Peace Of Mind' (VIDEO) |work = Huffington Post |date = 2013-04-18 |accessdate = 17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration ===

In September 2018, speaking at a conference in Sweden's third-largest city, Malmo, home to a large immigrant population, the Dalai Lama said "I think Europe belongs to the Europeans," he said, adding they should make clear to refugees that "they ultimately should rebuild their own country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20180912-dalai-lama-says-europe-belongs-europeans|title=Dalai Lama says 'Europe belongs to Europeans'|date=12 September 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/dalai-lama-says-europe-belongs-to-europeans|title=Dalai Lama says 'Europe belongs to Europeans'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Speaking to German reporters the Dalai Lama said "too many" refugees are seeking asylum in Europe," adding that "Europe, for example Germany, cannot become an Arab country". He also said that Germany is Germany. "There are so many that in practice it becomes difficult."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/05/31/the-dalai-lama-says-too-many-refugees-are-going-to-germany/|title=The Dalai Lama says 'too many' refugees are going to Germany|first=|last=https://www.facebook.com/max.bearak|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/migrant-crisis-dalai-lama-says-germany-cannot-become-an-arab-country-20160601-gp8mhr.html|title=Migrant crisis: Dalai Lama says Germany 'cannot become an Arab country'|first=Max|last=Bearak|date=31 May 2016|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Retirement and succession plans ==

On 29 May 2011, the Dalai Lama retired from the [[Central Tibetan Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = His Holiness the Dalai Lama's Remarks on Retirement – March 19th, 2011 |url = http://dalailama.com/messages/retirement/retirement-remarks |accessdate = 14 September 2014 |date = 19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 September 2011, the Dalai Lama issued the following statement concerning his reincarnation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When I am about ninety I will consult the high Lamas of the Tibetan Buddhist traditions, the Tibetan public, and other concerned people who follow Tibetan Buddhism, and re-evaluate whether the institution of the Dalai Lama should continue or not. On that basis we will take a decision. If it is decided that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama should continue and there is a need for the Fifteenth Dalai Lama to be recognized, responsibility for doing so will primarily rest on the concerned officers of the Dalai Lama's Gaden Phodrang Trust. They should consult the various heads of the Tibetan Buddhist traditions and the reliable oath-bound Dharma Protectors who are linked inseparably to the lineage of the Dalai Lamas. They should seek advice and direction from these concerned beings and carry out the procedures of search and recognition in accordance with past tradition. I shall leave clear written instructions about this. Bear in mind that, apart from the reincarnation recognized through such legitimate methods, no recognition or acceptance should be given to a candidate chosen for political ends by anyone, including those in the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dalailama.com/news/post/753-statement-of-his-holiness-the-fourteenth-dalai-lama-tenzin-gyatso-on-the-issue-of-his-reincarnation Statement of His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, on the Issue of His Reincarnation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204002812/http://www.dalailama.com/news/post/753-statement-of-his-holiness-the-fourteenth-dalai-lama-tenzin-gyatso-on-the-issue-of-his-reincarnation |date=4 February 2013 }} [http://www.dalailama.com/ Website of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet] 24 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 3 October 2011, the Dalai Lama repeated his statement in an interview with Canadian [[CTV News]]. He added that Chinese laws banning the selection of successors based on reincarnation will not impact his decisions. "Naturally my next life is entirely up to me. No one else. And also this is not a political matter," he said in the interview. The Dalai Lama also added that he was not decided on whether he would reincarnate or be the last Dalai Lama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = CTV |title = CTV Exclusive: Dalai Lama will choose successor |date = 3 October 2011 |url = http://www.ctvnews.ca/old-ctv-national-news/ctv-exclusive-dalai-lama-will-choose-successor-1.706189 |accessdate = 27 June 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101945/http://www.ctvnews.ca/old-ctv-national-news/ctv-exclusive-dalai-lama-will-choose-successor-1.706189 |archive-date = 6 October 2014 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the German newspaper ''Welt am Sonntag'' published on 7 September 2014 the Dalai Lama stated "the institution of the Dalai Lama has served its purpose", and that "We had a Dalai Lama for almost five centuries. The 14th Dalai Lama now is very popular.

Gyatso has also expressed fear that the Chinese government would manipulate any reincarnation selection in order to choose a successor that would go along with their political goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/916409066|title=Religions in the modern world : traditions and transformations|others=Woodhead, Linda,, Partridge, Christopher H.

== Controversies ==

=== CIA Tibetan program ===
{{Main|CIA Tibetan program}}

In October 1998, the Dalai Lama's administration acknowledged that it received $1.7&amp;nbsp;million a year in the 1960s from the U.S. government through the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA).&lt;ref name="tnyt 10-2-1998"&gt;{{cite news |title = World News Briefs; Dalai Lama Group Says It Got Money From C.I.A. |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F3061EF73E5C0C718CDDA90994D0494D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fD%2fDalai%20Lama |date = 2 October 1998|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked by CIA officer John Kenneth Knaus in 1995 to comment on the [[CIA Tibetan program]], the Dalai Lama replied that though it helped the morale of those resisting the Chinese, "thousands of lives were lost in the resistance" and further, that "the U.S. Government had involved itself in his country's affairs not to help Tibet but only as a Cold War tactic to challenge the Chinese."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = William Blum |url = http://members.aol.com/superogue/intro.htm |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080321053809/http://members.aol.com/superogue/intro.htm |archivedate=21 March 2008 |title = Rogue State: A Guide to the World's Only Superpower |publisher = Zed Books|year=2006 |accessdate = 2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography ''[[Freedom in Exile]]'', the Dalai Lama criticized the CIA again for supporting the [[Tibetan independence movement]] "not because they (the CIA) cared about Tibetan independence, but as part of their worldwide efforts to destabilize all [[communist]] [[Executive (government)|governments]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = CIA Gave Aid to Tibetan Exiles in '60s, Files Show |url = http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/15/news/mn-22993|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate = 8 September 2013 |quote = In his 1990 autobiography, 'Freedom in Exile', the Dalai Lama explained that his two brothers made contact with the CIA during a trip to India in 1956.

In 1999, the Dalai Lama said that the [[CIA Tibetan program]] had been harmful for Tibet because it was primarily aimed at serving American interests, and "once the [[Foreign policy of the United States|American policy]] toward China changed, they stopped their help."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jonathan Mirsky |title = Tibet: The CIA's Cancelled War |url = http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/apr/09/cias-cancelled-war-tibet/ |work=[[The New York Review of Books]] |accessdate = 3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ties to India ===
[[File:Plaque at AP Museum, Amaravathi.jpg|250px|thumb|Stone Plaque at a plantation by Tenzin in Amaravathi]]
The [[Media of the People's Republic of China|Chinese press]] has criticized the Dalai Lama for his close ties with India. His 2010 remarks at the [[International Buddhist Conference]] in [[Gujarat]] saying that he was "Tibetan in appearance, but an Indian in spirituality" and referral to himself as a "son of India" in particular led the ''[[People's Daily]]'' to opine, "Since the Dalai Lama deems himself an Indian rather than Chinese, then why is he entitled to represent the voice of the Tibetan people?"&lt;ref name="heart"&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://chinatibet.people.com.cn/6876597.html |title = A look at the Dalai Lama's ridiculous Indian heart |date = 2010-01-22 |accessdate = 17 August 2010 |publisher = China Tibet Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dhundup Gyalpo of the ''[[Tibet Sun]]'' shot back that Tibetan religion could be traced back to [[Nalanda]] in India, and that Tibetans have no connection to Chinese "apart  ... from a handful of culinary dishes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.tibetsun.com/opinions/2010/02/09/why-is-the-dalai-lama-son-of-india |title = Why is the Dalai Lama "son of India"? |first = Dhundup |last = Gyalpo |location = Dharamshala |date = 2010-02-09 |accessdate = 18 August 2010 |publisher = [[Tibet Sun]] |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110717053610/http://www.tibetsun.com/opinions/2010/02/09/why-is-the-dalai-lama-son-of-india |archive-date = 17 July 2011 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''People's Daily'' stressed the links between [[Chinese Buddhism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and accused the Dalai Lama of "betraying [[South Tibet|southern Tibet]] to India".&lt;ref name="heart" /&gt; In 2008, the Dalai Lama said for the first time that the territory India claims as part of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] is part of India, citing the disputed [[Simla Accord (1914)|1914 Simla Accord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Tawang is part of India: Dalai Lama |publisher = TNN |date = 4 June 2008 |url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Tawang_is_part_of_India_Dalai_Lama_/articleshow/3097568.cms |accessdate = 4 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shugden controversy ===
{{Main|Dorje Shugden controversy}}
The Dorje Shugden Controversy reappeared in the Gelug school by the publication of the ''Yellow Book'' in 1976, containing stories about wrathful acts of ''Dorje Shugden'' against Gelugpas who also practiced [[Nyingma]] teachings. In response, the 14th Dalai Lama, a Gelugpa himself and advocate of an "inclusive" approach to the teachings of Tibetan Buddhism,{{sfn|Mills|2003}}{{sfn|Kay|2004}} started to speak out against the practice of Dorje Shugden in 1978.{{sfn|Kay|2004|p=47}}

The controversy has attracted attention in the West because of demonstrations held in 2008 and 2014 by Dorje Shugden practitioners. A 2015 [[Reuters]] investigation determined "that the religious sect behind the protests has the backing of the Communist Party" and that the "group has emerged as an instrument in Beijing's long campaign to undermine support for the Dalai Lama".&lt;ref&gt;Lague, David.

=== Gedhun Choekyi Nyima ===
In April 2018, the [[Dalai Lama]] confirmed the official Chinese claims about [[Gedhun Choekyi Nyima]] by saying that he knew from "reliable sources" that the Panchen Lama he had recognized was alive and receiving normal education. He said he hoped that the official Panchen Lama ([[Gyaincain Norbu]]) studied well under the guidance of a good teacher, adding that there were instances in Tibetan Buddhist tradition, of a reincarnated lama taking more than one manifestation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestatesman.com/india/11th-panchen-lama-alive-receiving-education-dalai-lama-1502627372.html 11th Panchen Lama alive, receiving education: Dalai Lama], ''The Statesman'', April 25, 2018: "Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama on Wednesday said 11th Panchen Lama Gedhun Choekyi Nyima "according to reliable source is alive and receiving normal education".

"Then the Panchen Lama, which I recognised sometime back, there was no news, but then according to reliable information, he is still alive and receiving normal education. So we will see," he said.

The Dalai Lama's appeal is variously ascribed to his charismatic personality, international fascination with Buddhism, his [[universalist]] values, international sympathy for the Tibetans, and western [[sinophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/dec/15/china-dalai-lama-exile-tibetans |title = The Next Dalai Lama: China has a choice|first=Dibyesh|last=Anand |publisher = The Guardian |date = 2010-12-15 |accessdate = 19 December 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, many films were released by the [[Cinema of the United States|American film industry]] about Tibet, including [[biopics]] of the Dalai Lama. This is attributed to both the Dalai Lama's 1989 Nobel Peace Prize as well as to the euphoria following the [[Fall of Communism]]. The most notable films, ''[[Kundun]]'' and ''[[Seven Years in Tibet (1997 film)|Seven Years in Tibet]]'' (both released in 1997), portrayed "an idyllic pre-1950 Tibet, with a smiling, soft-spoken Dalai Lama at the helm – a Dalai Lama sworn to [[non-violence]]": portrayals the Chinese government decried as [[ahistorical]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = Tibet |first=Michael |last=Buckley |publisher = [[Bradt Travel Guides]] |year=2006 |edition=2 |ISBN = 978-1-84162-164-7 |page = 35 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VrMcNDdB5-MC&amp;pg=PA35 |accessdate = 5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BersihRallyHafiz.jpg|thumb|300px|Rallying crowd in front of the [[Istana Negara, Jalan Istana|Istana Negara]]]]

The '''2007 Bersih rally''' was a rally held in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]], on 10 November 2007. The aim of this walk was to campaign for electoral reform. It was precipitated by allegations of corruption and discrepancies in the Malaysian election system that heavily favour the ruling political party, [[Barisan Nasional]], which has been in power since Malaysia achieved its independence in 1957.

Much of the publicity for the rally was distributed through online media and [[blogs]]. Initially, the organisers planned to have a gathering point at [[Dataran Merdeka]] square. However, it was later revealed that this was a red herring to distract the police. The locations of the four gathering points were only released the day before the protests by word of mouth, mobile phones and emails.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Consequently, the rally began with gatherings of people at four locations: Sogo department store, Masjid India, Masjid Negara and Pasar Seni. These four groups of people combined into a single group on their march towards the [[Istana Negara, Jalan Istana|palace]] gates to hand over a memorandum to the King demanding electoral reform.&lt;ref name="Purpose"&gt;[http://asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=863&amp;Itemid=31 Malaysian Petitioners Defy Police]&lt;/ref&gt; Early estimates put the number of attendees between 10,000 and 40,000.&lt;ref name="Illegal"&gt;[http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=294788 Bersih Not Given Permission To Hold Rally]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans called for 100,000 people to join in the rally, and there are claims that this number was indeed achieved, as the many early estimates failed to include those who simultaneously gathered at different locations and those that were barred by police from continuing the walk.The title of the rally is derived from the name of the organizers, [[Bersih|BERSIH]] (Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections).&lt;ref name="nameOrigin"&gt;[http://bersih.org/ BERSIH Official Site]&lt;/ref&gt; The word "{{lang|ms|bersih}}" means clean in [[Malay language|Malay]].

Before the Bersih rally there is a '''Reformasi Movement''' in September 1998 caused by the sacking of previous Deputy Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim has massively formed a noteworthy change in the political scene in Malaysia. Supporters from all over went down to the lanes to show and bolster the call for Reformasi, which was driven by Anwar Ibrahim. Gigantic and exceptional demonstrations occurred in Kuala Lumpur and other major cities. A fascinating angle to note, in the meantime, the administration of Malaysia is endlessly grasping the universe of Information Technology. The Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) denoted a fresh start for Malaysia, as it looks to be a world leader in Information Technology.&lt;ref name="Reformasi"&gt;[file:///C:/Users/user/Downloads/Documents/001-ICHHS2013-W00002.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Next is '''The Political Tsunami''' Changes Malaysian Politics. This is a political wave. Much the same as the normal tidal wave that never gives any sign it happens. In any case, when the topographical plate unexpectedly shiftdeform and vertically uproot the overlying water, it can create an awesome tsunami. During this time, the political torrent cleared away 50% of the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition's energy. Nobody expected such outcomes, included BN and the resistance as there was no obvious sign before the decisions. Without a doubt, BN has been mentally arranged. It anticipated that would lose dominant part of Indian votes and part of Chinese votes. In any case, it was sure to win the national surveys by acquiring the majority of Malay votes and backings from Sabah and Sarawak. In view of this certainty, it held an early races.Therefore, the individuals who have been required to lose lost severely while the individuals who were not anticipated that would lose, lost a great deal. BN did not only lose Indian and Chinese vote but rather Malay votes in urban regions, and additionally in Northern Malaysia and the East Coast. This is not quite the same as the influential current in 1990 and 1999. Resistance parties framed a coalition to battle with BN coalition in 1990. In the long run, Malay voters stressed that progressions may cause them lose the decision control. In this way, they surrendered Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah and upheld United Malays National Organization. In spite of most Chinese voted in favor of the resistance, yet the restriction fizzled without the help from others. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.mysinchew.com/node/8364&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Bersih demands==
The demands made by [[Bersih]] were:&lt;ref name="bersih01"&gt;[http://bersih.org/?page_id=115 Long-Term Reform Agenda] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621011418/http://bersih.org/?page_id=115 |date=21 June 2011 }} - from BERSIH official website&lt;/ref&gt;
* Usage of indelible ink (which has already been agreed to by the [[Election Commission of Malaysia|Electoral Commission]], but later scrapped)
* Clean-up of registered voters roll
* Abolition of postal votes
* Access to the government-controlled print and broadcast media for [[Opposition (Malaysia)|opposition parties]]

==Reformasi demands==
These demands were incorporated into the Memorandum for submission to the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]].Reformasi shakes Mahathir's authoritarian regime was political onlookers' fundamental concern. From a historical point of view voters' decision could realize a two-party system and end BN's overwhelming one-party dominion. This was the expectation of majority rule government followers. This awesome coalition planned to take over one third of the seats in parliament, end the matchless quality of the BN and constrain Mahathir to venture down.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lin20021219.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparations==

===Organisers' preparations===
Initially, organisers decided on two locations for rally participants to gather before marching on to the Istana Negara: Masjid Negara and Dataran Merdeka, two of the most significant landmarks in Kuala Lumpur. However, the day before the rallies were due, the organisers decided to change the locations to Sogo department store, Masjid India, Masjid Negara and Pasar Seni, in an attempt to divert riot police's attention. Furthermore, a decoy of 500 people were sent to Dataran Merdeka to 'attempt' to get into the square.

===Government preparations===
[[Image:20071110Bersih2Hafiz.jpg|thumb|The police form a human line near the National Palace.]]
In the days leading up to the rally, the government warned Malaysians not to take part in the rally as an official permit had not been granted. Citizens were warned that anyone who turned up and participate in the rally would be immediately arrested, because the rally is deemed as illegal since the current Malaysian law bans public gatherings of more than five persons without a permit. However, it should be noted that in July last year, a police permit has released for Umno Youth to hold a protest to demand that the US and Israel end the violence in the Middle East, while US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was in Kuala Lumpur for a meeting with Asean leaders.

Local television channels, controlled by the ruling party, continually showed video footage of violent protests from other countries, complemented by the tagline "Demonstration always ends in violence." The Prime Minister of Malaysia, [[Abdullah Badawi]], was quoted saying "Saya pantang dicabar" (translation: I will not be challenged). He urged Malaysians to use elections to give their feedback.&lt;ref name="Preparations"&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/11/10/nation/19438454&amp;sec=nation Reject demos and use polls, PM urges public] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521085317/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F11%2F10%2Fnation%2F19438454&amp;sec=nation |date=21 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had vowed to crack down on the rally and gave his permission to the police to break up the rally and possibly arrest its participants.&lt;ref name="Arrest"&gt;[http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/74591 PM vows to crack down on Bersih rally]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses==

===Police's response===
[[Image:2007-11-10 FRU attentions.jpg|thumb|The riot police units were placed at various places around Kuala Lumpur. A unit was on active duty at the [[Masjid Negara]].]]

Hours before the rally was due to occur, thousands of police were stationed around Merdeka Square, and traffic coming into Kuala Lumpur had to pass through numerous security checkpoints, some saying checkpoints began at Pagoh, Johor and Kemaman, Terrengganu.&lt;ref name="checkpoints"&gt;[http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=295356 Over 1,000 Cops Placed On Alert For Illegal Assembly]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This created widespread traffic congestion throughout the entire [[Klang Valley]] area. Although it was claimed by the government that the actual rally was the cause of the jam, other sources contradicted this, stating that the numerous barricades and roadblocks set up by police officers were the direct source of the congestion.&lt;ref name="roadblock"&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/11/11/nation/19443935&amp;sec=nation Road closures, checks cause massive jams in Klang Valley] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002235049/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F11%2F11%2Fnation%2F19443935&amp;sec=nation |date=2 October 2012 }} - The Star, 11 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Authorities also made changes to the train schedule in an attempt to make it more difficult for people to reach the rally area. Trains on the [[Kelana Jaya Line|Kelana Jaya LRT]] line coming into the city from [[Kelana Jaya]], which normally stop at [[Pasar Seni LRT station|Pasar Seni]] and [[Masjid Jamek LRT station|Masjid Jamek]], instead bypassed those stations, going from [[Kuala Lumpur Sentral|KL Sentral]] directly to [[Dang Wangi LRT station|Dang Wangi Station]]. Passengers were not given any warning of this and many did not realise they would not be able to stop at these stations until the train was already on its way to Dang Wangi or Sentral.

During the rally, the police responded by firing chemical laced water cannons and tear gas at rally participants at the Masjid Jamek and Bandaraya LRT meeting points.&lt;ref name="Water"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSSP165982 Malaysia police use water cannon at Anwar rally]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TearGas"&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/11/10/malaysia.protests/index.html Teargas used on rare Malaysia demo]&lt;/ref&gt; 245 people were arrested according to the local daily newspapers The Star, owned by MCA, one of the coalition parties of the current ruling government.&lt;ref name="arrests"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F11%2F11%2Fnation%2F19443759&amp;sec=nation |title=Teargas and water cannons used on illegal assembly, 245 held |access-date=8 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508003436/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F11%2F11%2Fnation%2F19443759&amp;sec=nation |archive-date=8 May 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent sources, however, quoted only 34 people were arrested and released the night later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suaram.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=778&amp;Itemid=1 Updates: Total number of arrests 34 – all released by 11pm; several more injured]. [[Suaram]]. Retrieved 11 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Purportedly, the organisers of BERSIH had ordered participants to be cooperative and the assembly was to remain peaceful at all times.

===Media's response===
Foreign media such as [[Al-Jazeera]] covered the event with detailed videos and ground and satellite images. [[BBC]] and [[CNN]] featured the news in their online papers as well. ''[[Bangkok Post]]'' published this event on its internet edition and fine print.

The event received almost no coverage in the local media. The most widely circulated English daily, [[The Star (Malaysia)|''The Star'']] only reported a traffic congestion. Other print dailies did not report the incident.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Government responses===

====Prime Minister====
[[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] remarked that the Malaysian Royalty should not be dragged into Malaysian politics. He further alleged that the rally constituted an attempt by the Opposition to drag the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] into the issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/11/11/nation/20071111141403&amp;sec=nation PM: Don’t drag royalty into politics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615225700/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F11%2F11%2Fnation%2F20071111141403&amp;sec=nation |date=15 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/11/12/nation/19445828&amp;sec=nation&amp;focus=1 Opposition trying to drag King into says Pak Lah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608145851/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F11%2F12%2Fnation%2F19445828&amp;sec=nation&amp;focus=1 |date=8 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Constitutionally, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] is the Head of the State while the Prime Minister is the Head of Government. Earlier, BERSIH had informed the public that the rally is a non-partisan activity, agreed by all organisers with NGOs (non-governmental organisations) forming the principal backbone of the movement, followed by some opposition parties.

BERSIH had earlier insisted the rally was non-partisan; however, no parties from the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition participated. In fact, there was a cry for a clampdown on the rally by delegates and hard-liners in the 2007 UMNO Annual General Meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bersih.org/?p=420 Khairy’s “Stop the BERSIH rally” video clip]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Information Minister====
Later, Information Minister Datuk Seri [[Zainuddin Maidin]] criticised [[Al-Jazeera]], denying reports that the police used excessive force in the demonstration. Zainuddin said that the police had to disperse the gathering with water cannons and tear gas since the rally was illegal. There are online allegations that certain journalists and civilians were beaten by authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtQxwS0CfGs]&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream media confirmed arrests of people who had joined the rally. Most Malaysian media outlets generally gave the number of protesters present as approximately 4,000, although independent and international media reported a turnout ten times higher. Zainuddin Maidin was severely criticised in various socio-political blogs for his poor command of English shown during an interview with the Qatar-based news group [[Al-Jazeera]] regarding the rally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecicak.com/zainuddin-maidin-makes-a-fool-of-himself-in-an-interview-about-the-bersih-protest/ Zainuddin Maidin disgraced Malaysians with poor English]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later the people marched towards [[Istana Negara, Jalan Istana|Istana Negara]] to hand over the memorandum after many attempts (from the police) to disperse the mob failed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/11/11/nation/19444042&amp;sec=nation Najib on why police did not permit gathering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129162435/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F11%2F11%2Fnation%2F19444042&amp;sec=nation |date=29 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some had travelled from other states to claim their rights.

====Minister in the Prime Minister's Department====
Nazri Aziz, from the ruling party [[UMNO]] gave a negative response. He claimed there is democracy in Malaysia, therefore there is no necessity for a rally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=19941 Nazri: Bersih organisers suffering from 'short circuit']{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazri further predicted that the opposition parties "are going to lose, and they are going to lose badly in the next elections". He also insisted that Malaysia was a democracy, thus invalidating comparisons with [[Myanmar]] because the Buddhist monks in Myanmar were protesting for the restoration of democracy in a country where the people were oppressed.

However, Nazri did not admit that protest is allowed in democracies. BERSIH demands, with support from citizens for the restoration of genuine democracy. Unclean elections due to unfair electoral processes is equivalent to false or absent democracy.

Moreover, both Myanmar and Malaysia crack down on rallies and protests not permitted by the government. Human Rights associations across the world regard freedom to assemble and rally as fundamental rights of a citizen in democratic nations.

===Royals' response===
According to [[Malaysiakini]], [[Mizan Zainal Abidin|Yang di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abdidin]] in a rare press statement said neither he nor [[Istana Negara, Jalan Istana|Istana Negara]] had directly or indirectly supported the massive rally held over the weekend in [[Kuala Lumpur]].&lt;ref name="Royal"&gt;[http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/74869 King expressed disappointment over rally]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Bernama]], the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong|King]], in a statement issued via a palace official, expressed regret over the claim that he and the palace had supported Saturday’s illegal gathering.&lt;ref name="Royal01"&gt;[http://web7.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news.php?id=296616 Tuanku Mizan Regrets Claims He Supports Illegal Rally]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} - Bernama 16 November 2007 14:12 PM&lt;/ref&gt;

===International response===
On 29 November 2007, the [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] carried a comment by an anonymous official from the [[United States]] [[United States Department of State|State Department]] stating that "We believe citizens of any country should be allowed to peacefully assemble and express their views."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=| last=| coauthors=| title=US defends peaceful protests in Malaysia| date=29 November 2007| publisher=| url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5infGs_bxYSVJWCbAUO9G-KimgJBQ| work=AFP| pages=| accessdate=29 November 2007| language=| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201181836/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5infGs_bxYSVJWCbAUO9G-KimgJBQ| archive-date=1 December 2007| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;



==Rally proceedings==

It was reported that the rally participants played a 'cat and mouse' game with the riot police, as many of the groups were repeatedly stopped by the police and disallowed from continuing.

The group from Masjid Jamek were sprayed with water cannons and tear gas canisters, but still managed to continue their march by joining the group congregating in front of the Sogo departmental store.

The group from Pasar Seni, led by Tian Chua attempted to pass through police barricades that blocked them from approaching the palace. This group also tried to negotiate with the police. As the negotiations were going on, this group found an alley that was not guarded by riot police, hence being able to bypass the police to get to the palace.

500 people from the Pasar Seni group joined part of the Sogo group to continue their march. Meanwhile, 10,000 people from Masjid Negara had begun marching to Istana Negara. They split into two groups to increase the chance of reaching Istana Negara.

A combined group of 40,000 people, stretching half a kilometre long along the highway were stopped by police 300 meters from the palace grounds. They were eventually joined by the group from Masjid Jamek and Sogo.

Police allowed a delegation of 7 people, including PAS's President [[Abdul Hadi Awang]] and [[Nasharuddin Mat Isa]], [[Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)|DAP]]’s [[Lim Kit Siang]] and [[Lim Guan Eng]] and [[Keadilan]]'s Datuk Seri [[Anwar Ibrahim]] to enter the palace.

After the memorandum was handed over to a palace secretary, most of the rally participants were seen walking back to Masjid Negara. About 20 people had been arrested earlier in the day and were held at Pudu police station. When they finally arrived at Masjid Negara, they were told to go home. Some of the rally participants went to the Pudu police station to support those who were detained.

==The political tsunami changes in Malaysian politics==
For 2008, voters never again settled on choice based on race and shading. Resistance votes in urban zones, blended bodies electorate that cast by Chinese, Indians and Malays helped the opposition to pick up triumph.
The reasons are, first is '''changes in the social environment'''. Regarding social condition BN has been confronting the antagonistic social atmosphere before the elections. Financially, the surge of costs has shaped an awesome weight to the citizens, particularly the individuals who live in urban communities.

Seconds is '''changes in civic thought'''. The political structure of BN coalition was as yet in view of race in which each gathering worried without anyone else racial belief system to gain support from their racial gatherings. At that point, pioneers of each gatherings collaborated and circulated control in the best administration. This structure has been kept up for half of a century and assumed its chronicled part, and also effectively settled some racial issues. In any case, there were a few shortcomings for the structure. As each gathering was battling for the interests of their races, it was absence of regular standards and objectives and prompted logical inconsistencies in strategies and goals. Segment parties at first made due on such conveyance of energy yet as time advances, bigotry has been bit by bit obsolete and the general national intrigue has gone past racial interests. 

There are confinements for racial gatherings and it is difficult to keep up the need of national solidarity. Under these twofold weights, the topic of the BN's statement that still worried on peace, dependability and flourishing has been conflicting with the prerequisites of the general population. Like the riptide underneath the ocean, BN coalition, who has ruled the nation for half of a century couldn't control the change of the general population's idea. Generally, the restriction was bolstered by the general population as it accentuated on issues like bringing down oil costs, enhancing lawfulness, lessening the hole between the rich and poor people and battling against debasement which were in accordance with the social environment and steady with the general population's desires. The belief system of the restriction has deserted racial and religious issues however yelled for change and underlined on social equity, vote based system and equity. 

Democratic Action Party's (DAP) wish to convey changes to the nation, Parti Keadilan Rakyat's (PKR) support of Divide and Rule and Parti Islam Se-Malaysia's (PAS) thought of having a welfare nation picked up them reverberation from the general population. The restriction cooperated and angled votes in favor of each other to reinforce their energy. Furthermore, PKR has exited from the shadow of Anwar while Anwar demonstrated his charm that effectively transformed the gathering into an ordinary political gathering and another constrain. Malaysia would have another face after the political tidal wave. The energy of BN coalition has declined and it needs to depend on Sabah, Sarawak and Southern Malaysia to keep up its decision control. There will be real authority changes in UMNO, MCA, MIC and Gerakan. What's more, the belief systems of BN coalition's segment parties must be balanced. Relinquishing racial segment would be an exit plan. With respect to the resistance, they won't not have the capacity to deal with to sudden triumph in the decisions, particularly for DAP and Keadilan who won control of states and extended their impacts in the Parliament ought to.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mysinchew.com/node/8364&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of Reformasi==
The ascent of the Reformasi development in the late 1990s was a noteworthy point of reference in the democratization procedure in Malaysia. Amid the period before the Reformasi development, exceptional monetary development rendered a feeling of authenticity to the tyrant run; in any case, the budgetary emergency in 1997 opened the way to the introduction of the Reformasi development.
Nair (2007) portrayed the Reformasi development  as a reaction from the general population to the tyrant govern of the decision administration. They requested government straightforwardness, responsibility and trustworthiness. In spite of the fact that the development secured an extensive variety of issues and causes, it was fixated on the manhandle of energy by the administration.
The Reformasi development prompted political changes in Malaysia, especially with respect to the dispositions of government officials. This study concentrates on political changes regarding casual political changes, for example, changes in political talks, and changes in the political procedures of the decision administration. Formal political changes, for example, the democratization of organized political framework, are yet to have critical effect on social developments, in spite of the fact that measures are presently being taken, for example, the abolishment of the Internal Security Act (ISA), beginning on 16 September 2011, and the foundation of an extraordinary board of trustees on appointive change.

The Reformasi development began after an uncommon droop in monetary development. All of the country's organizations crumpled, including those claimed by the child of the fourth Prime Minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohamad. Amid the emergency, Mahathir trained Anwar Ibrahim, the Deputy Prime Minister who held the post as the Finance Minister, to salvage the organizations possessed by Mahathir's friends. Anwar declined to take after Mahathir's directions with respect to the utilization of open assets and firmly proposed that it was essential for the administration to get subsidizing from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to manage its economy. Mahathir was against this arrangement and guaranteed that accepting assets from the IMF would additionally reinforce the intercession of worldwide associations and undermine Malaysia's power.

The Reformasi development was an essential driving force for the democratization procedure in Malaysia. Before the development, the restriction parties were feeble, divided and withered due to wide contrasts in the philosophies of the two greatest resistance parties, Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS or Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party) and Parti Tindakan Demokratik (DAP or Democratic Action Party). While PAS required an Islamic state, DAP was a liberal-mainstream party battling for a Malaysian Malaysia; this made it troublesome for the two parties   to coordinate.

The development inevitably changed into its own political gathering and partnership, prompting the foundation of both the Parti Keadilan Nasional (PKN or National Justice Party) and the Barisan Alternatif (BA or Alternative Front). Together with PAS and DAP, they concurred on a liberal motivation to restrict the Barisan Nasional (BN or National Front) in the 1999 general decision. Their pronouncement focused on multi-racial and human rights issues, the destruction of destitution and the battle against government defilement and mishandle of energy. In the decisions, they effectively diminished the quantity of seats held by the decision party, yet at the same time couldn't overwhelm its two-third larger part. The coalition effectively won 45 situates in the parliamentary race, which was somewhat higher than the past decision, while the administration won 148 seats, exhibiting a lessening from the past race. BA likewise won 40.21% of the aggregate vote (Ufen, 2009).

The Reformasi development is itself a piece of the democratization procedure, going about as an impetus for its dynamic advancement. The development turned into an essential factor in deciding the voting result of the following two general races. To comprehend the democratization procedure in Malaysia, accordingly, it is pivotal to comprehend the route in which the ensuing two general decisions influenced the political structure and in this manner gave the political chance to social developments to create.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293820669_The_Reformasi_Movement_and_Environmental_Non-Governmental_Organisations_in_Malaysia&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese tsunami impacts==
"A Chinese tsunami" was the means by which the result of the distinctly challenged Thirteenth General Elections (GE13) came to be portrayed by Najib Razak and other Barisan Nasional (BN) pioneers on the night of 5 May 2013 (Tan, 2013). The symbolism was a solid articulation of frustration by BN pioneers of how the  absence of Chinese help had prompted lost seats by the decision coalition. In the quick consequence of GE13, a few spectators fight that the outcomes have exacerbated the ethnic partition in the nation. In displaying the GE13 comes about as a Chinese tidal wave there has been a reaction from specific groups inside UMNO against the non-Malays (Muzaffar, 2013). Explanations and editorials  leaving the genius UMNO media depicted the Chinese votes in favor of the  resistance as a selling out. 

Some guaranteed that the Chinese, not being content with  control of the economy are resolved to seizing political power. They cautioned of  Malay striking back and proposed that those not content with BN move somewhere else. Such calls were first made by Ahmad Zahid Hamidi because of mass revives  sorted out by PR to challenge the decision comes about under the flag of "Dark  505". Still others required a blacklist of Chinese organizations that had upheld  the resistance. Inside UMNO there is a commotion for harder and that's only the tip of the iceberg  tyrant reaction to commentators of the legislature and the restriction. To be sure,  captures were made not long after GE13 against those arranging energizes and challenge social occasions. Rafizi Ramli, the PKR procedure executive who had conveyed to open  consideration the National Feedlot Center (NFC) outrage was charged under the Keeping Money and Financial Institutions Act for uncovering data identified with the NFC. Government commentators considered this to be an endeavor to threaten those trying to uncover wrongdoings in government. In the interim, duplicates of three resistance  daily papers were seized for abusing the Printing Presses and Publications Act. 

A  few months after the fact, another week by week The Heat was suspended, evidently for its  front-page story on the lavish way of life of the Prime Minister and his significant other  (The Malaysian Insider, 2013a).
The UMNO initiative, understanding that it was Malay help particularly  those in the rustic zones that hosted encouraged the get-together to survive GE13 quickly  moved to give more consideration and monetary prizes to this voting demographic. On 14  September 2013, Najib Razak reported the development of the Bumiputera  Monetary Empowerment Council. The committee would present new measures  . furthermore, procedures to monetarily engage the Bumiputera (New Straits Times, 2013a). Focuses towards the board's destinations would be set for all boss official officers of government-connected organizations (GLCs). To upgrade  Bumiputera value possession in the corporate segment, the Skim Amanah Saham  Bumiputera 2 would be propelled by Permodalan Nasional Bhd with 10 billion  units. Shahrir Abdul Samad, an UMNO veteran pioneer and MP for Johor Bahru, took a more extensive view in his evaluation of why non-Malays voted in favor of the  resistance. 
He recognized that the rule of balance upheld by the DAP was a factor that drew numerous non-Malay votes in favor of PR. Not exclusively are non-Malays looking for break even with circumstances and get to, Shahrir trusted that non-Malays are  focused on protecting Malaysia as a mainstream state. On the off chance that BN would like to recover  bolster in GE14, Shahrir held that there must be better administration under  UMNO and BN (The Malaysian Insider, 2013b; Free Malaysia Today, 2013a).

At long last, the youthful Chinese are today more worried about more extensive issues that go past mutual interests. Break even with circumstances in instruction,work and business are issues that are as yet essential to them. Be that as it may, the youthful Chinese set these inside the bigger national structure of between ethnic collaboration, equity and human rights, and defending of nature (Lee,2011). Thus numerous youthful Chinese experts are attracted to NGOs and common society developments. Also, in the event that they take part in legislative issues they join multi-ethnic parties. Moreover, a few supporters of PR battle that the three gatherings of DAP, PKR and PAS offer a superior similarity of political equality and that each heads a Pakatan-drove government in Pulau Pinang, Selangor and Kelantan.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.usm.my/km/32(Supp.2)2014/KM%2032%20Supp.%202_2014-Art.%202%20(25-53).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59819">[[File:Singapore National Pledge at the National Museum, Singapore - 20100720.jpg|thumb|An [[animation|animated]] display at the [[National Museum of Singapore]] featuring a portion of the [[Singapore National Pledge]]. When reciting it, [[Singaporean nationality law|Singapore citizens]] pledge to "build a democratic society based on justice and equality".&lt;ref&gt;The remainder of the [[Singapore National Pledge]], which does not appear in the photograph, is "[... so as to achieve ha]ppiness, prosperity and progress for our nation".&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore''' guarantees to all persons [[equality before the law]] and equal protection of the law. The Article also identifies four forbidden classifications – religion, race, descent and place of birth – upon which [[Singaporean nationality law|Singapore citizens]] may not be discriminated for specific reasons. For example, discrimination on those classifications is prohibited in the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority or in the administration of any law relating to the establishing or carrying on of any trade, business, profession, vocation or employment.

Persons unable to show that one of the forbidden classifications applies to them may try to argue that they are members of a group defined by a law in a way that violates the general guarantee of equality and equal protection. To succeed, they must establish that the classification used in the law fails the rational nexus test, which is a three-stage test formulated by the courts. The first stage of the test involves an examination as to whether the law differentiates amongst classes of individuals. At the second stage, the court considers if the differentiation is founded on an intelligible [[wikt:differentia#Noun|differentia]] or distinguishing feature. Finally, the basis of the differentiation must bear a reasonable relation to the object of the statute. However, the test is not foolproof as a classification may satisfy the test even if the object of the law is itself illegitimate. The rational nexus test, as it is currently applied in [[Singapore]], also tolerates over- and under-inclusive classifications. It remains to be seen if local courts will consider other approaches to the issue, such as the three-tier system of scrutiny applied in the United States, the proportionality analysis applied in the United Kingdom to other areas of [[human rights]] law, or the reasonableness approach taken by some judges in India and Malaysia.

The rational nexus test does not apply where a statute treats all persons equally, but it is alleged that the authorities have applied the statute in a discriminatory manner. Instead, a modified rational nexus test is used, which requires a court to consider whether there is a reasonable nexus between the state action taken and the object of the law. Such a nexus will be absent if the action amounts to intentional and arbitrary discrimination or intentional systematic discrimination. It is insufficient if any inequality is due to inadvertence or inefficiency, unless this occurs on a very substantial scale. In addition, inequalities arising from a reasonable administrative policy or which are mere errors of judgment are insufficient to constitute a violation of Article 12(1).

Article 12(3) of the Constitution provides that Article 12 does not invalidate or prohibit any provision regulating personal law; or any provision or practice restricting office or employment connected with the affairs of any religion, or of an institution managed by a group professing any religion, to persons professing that religion.

==Text of Article 12==
[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|thumb|A copy of the [[Magna Carta]] of 1215 in the collection of the [[British Library]]. In a 1998 decision, the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore]] traced the concept of equality embodied in Article 12(1) of the [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]] to the 40th article of this document.]]

Article 12 of the [[Constitution of Singapore|Constitution]] of the [[Singapore|Republic of Singapore]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution|rep=1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is entitled "Equal protection" and reads as follows:

{{quote|12.— (1) All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law.

(2) Except as expressly authorised by this Constitution, there shall be no discrimination against citizens of Singapore on the ground only of religion, race, descent or place of birth in any law or in the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority or in the administration of any law relating to the acquisition, holding or disposition of property or the establishing or carrying on of any trade, business, profession, vocation or employment.

(3) This Article does not invalidate or prohibit —
:(a) any provision regulating personal law; or
:(b) any provision or practice restricting office or employment connected with the affairs of any religion, or of an institution managed by a group professing any religion, to persons professing that religion.}}

In the 1998 decision ''[[Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong]]'',&lt;ref name="Taw Cheng Kong (CA)"&gt;''[[Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong]]'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20090413014255/http://www.singaporelaw.sg/rss/judg/8595.html &amp;#91;1998&amp;#93; SGCA 37], [1998] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 489, [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] (Singapore), archived from [http://www.singaporelaw.sg/rss/judg/8595.html the original] on 13 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] regarded the concept of equality as a component of the wider doctrine of the [[rule of law]], and traced its origin to the 40th article of the [[Magna Carta]] of 1215 which states: "To none will we sell, to none will we deny, to none will we delay right or justice."&lt;ref name="Lim Meng Suang"&gt;''Taw Cheng Kong'' (C.A.), p. 505, para. 52; and see also {{cite CommonLII|litigants=Lim Meng Suang v. Attorney-General|link=Lim Meng Suang v. Attorney-General|court=SGHC|year=2013|num=73|parallelcite=[2013] 3 S.L.R. 118 at 130, para. 34|courtname=auto}}. The version in force in the UK is Article 29 of the Magna Carta reissued by [[Edward I of England]] in 1297 which reads: "We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right": Magna Carta 1297 ([http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1517519 1297 c. 9]).&lt;/ref&gt; Article 12(1) of the Constitution bears a strong resemblance to the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] which prohibits any state from denying "to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws", and to Article 14 of the [[Constitution of India]] which bars the state from denying "to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India". Article 12(1) is identical to Article 8(1) of the [[Constitution of Malaysia]], from which it was adopted following [[history of the Republic of Singapore#Independence of Singapore|Singapore's independence from Malaysia]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Republic of Singapore Independence Act}}, s. 6(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Lim Meng Suang v. Attorney-General]]'' (2013),&lt;ref name="Lim Meng Suang"/&gt; the High Court noted that the concept of [[equality before the law]] is derived from [[English law#Common law|English common law]] which requires all classes of persons to be equally subject to the law, while the concept of equal protection of the law stems from the US Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment and guarantees both procedural and substantive equality.&lt;ref&gt;''Lim Meng Suang'', pp. 130–132, paras. 35–37.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court said:&lt;ref&gt;''Lim Meng Suang'', p. 132, para. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It will be seen that equality before the law and equal protection of the law are but different aspects of the same doctrine&amp;nbsp;– equal justice. The first expresses the immutable principle of equal subjection of all classes of persons to the law, and the second is the positive aspect of that principle which reaches out, when invoked, to strike down unequal laws and discriminatory administrative or executive action as unconstitutional and void.}}

==Discriminatory classification==

===Forbidden classifications===
Article 12(2) of the Constitution prohibits [[discrimination]] against [[Singaporean nationality law|Singapore citizens]] (unlike Article 12(1) which applies to "all persons") "on the ground only of religion, race, descent or place of birth" in the following situations:

*In any law.
*In the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority.
*In the administration of any law relating to (1) the acquisition, holding or disposition of property; or (2) the establishing or carrying on of any trade, business, profession, vocation or employment.

The word ''only'' raises the possibility that discrimination may be permissible on the basis of one of the proscribed grounds in combination with some other factor, such as age or state of health.

Article 12(2) is subject to an express contrary authorization by the Constitution. Article 39A empowers the Legislature to ensure that members of the Malay, Indian and other minority communities are represented in [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]] by enacting a law to create [[Group Representation Constituency|Group Representation Constituencies]] (GRCs). Each voter in a GRC casts his or her ballot for a team of candidates, at least one of whom must be from a minority community.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Arts. 39A(1) and (2).&lt;/ref&gt; Article 39A(3) exempts any provision enacted by Parliament pursuant to Article 39A from being void due to inconsistency with Article 12.

Another provision that is rescued from potential invalidity by Article 12(2) is the [[Government of Singapore|Government]]'s constitutional mandate to exercise its functions in such a way as to recognize the special position of the [[Malays in Singapore|Malays]], who are the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous people]] of Singapore. The Government has a responsibility to "protect, safeguard, support, foster and promote their political, educational, religious, economic, social and cultural interests and the [[Malay language]]".&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 152(2).&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution also requires the Legislature to enact legislation to regulate [[Islam|Muslim]] religious affairs and to establish a council to advise the [[President of Singapore|President]] concerning matters relating to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation in question is the [[Administration of Muslim Law Act (Singapore)|Administration of Muslim Law Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Administration of Muslim Law Act|titlelink=Administration of Muslim Law Act (Singapore)|cap=3|ed=2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other discriminatory classifications: the rational nexus test===
Aggrieved persons who cannot avail themselves of the protection afforded by Article 12(2) may try to argue that they are a member of a group defined by a law in a way that violates Article 12(1). The rational nexus test, also known as the doctrine of reasonable classification, is a three-stage test formulated by the courts to determine if the manner in which a law classifies a group of persons is discriminatory. The equality guaranteed by the provision is a relative and not an absolute concept; it does not require that all persons are treated alike, but rather that all persons in like situations should be treated alike.&lt;ref name="Taw Cheng Kong (HC)"&gt;''Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor'' [1998] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 78 at 92, para. 27, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Taw Cheng Kong'' (C.A.), p. 506, para. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, a law that differentiates between classes of persons is valid and [[constitutionality|constitutional]] provided that there is some difference in circumstances, and the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears a reasonable relation to the legislative object of the law.&lt;ref name="Ong Ah Chuan 37"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor|link=Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor|court=UKPC|year=1980|num=32|format=1|parallelcite=[1981] A.C. 648 at 673–674, [1979–1980] S.L.R.(R.) 710 at 725, para. 37|courtname=auto|juris=Singapore}}, cited in ''Taw Cheng Kong'' (C.A.), p. 506, para. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; If there is no such relationship, the difference is discriminatory and the impugned legislation is unconstitutional and invalid.

====History====
In 1909, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] propounded a test to determine the reasonableness of a classification, stating that the classification "must always rest upon some real and substantial distinction bearing a reasonable and just relation to the things in respect to which the classification is made".&lt;ref&gt;''Southern Railway v. Greene'' {{ussc|216|400|1909|pin=417}}, [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] (United States).&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this principle, the [[Supreme Court of India]] subsequently formulated a two-stage test to determine if a classification made by a law was constitutional. The relevant stages were (1) whether the classification was founded on an intelligible differentia; and (2) whether the differentia had a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the law in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LIIofIndia|litigants=Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Shri Justice S. R. Tendolkar|court=INSC|year=1958|num=30|parallelcite=A.I.R. 1958 S.C. 538, [1959] S.C.R. [''Supreme Court Reports''] 279 at 296–297|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Court of Malaysia]] later adapted the rational nexus test by including an additional preceding stage, namely, whether the law was discriminatory.&lt;ref&gt;''Datuk Haji bin Harun Idris v. Public Prosecutor'' [1977] 2 M.L.J. [''Malayan Law Journal''] 155, [[Federal Court of Malaysia|Federal Court]] (Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt; This three-stage inquiry was accepted in Singapore in the case ''Kok Hoong Tan Dennis v. Public Prosecutor'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;''Kok Hoong Tan Dennis v. Public Prosecutor'' [1996] 3 S.L.R. (R.) 570 at 580, para. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stages of the test====
[[File:Capital Tower, DBS Tower 1, CPF Building.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Capital Tower, Singapore|Capital Tower]], where the [[Government of Singapore Investment Corporation]] (GIC) is headquartered. In 1998, the [[Court of Appeal of Singapore|Court of Appeal]] restated the rational nexus test applicable to Article 12(1) in a case involving a regional manager of GIC convicted of corruption.]]

The test that is currently followed in Singapore was re-expressed by the Court of Appeal in ''Taw Cheng Kong'' (1998) as comprising three stages:&lt;ref&gt;''Taw Cheng Kong'' (C.A.) at pp. 507–508, para. 58, citing ''Malaysian Bar v. Government of Malaysia'' [1987] 2 M.L.J. 165 at 170, [[Federal Court of Malaysia|Supreme Court]] (Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt;

#Whether the law differentiates – that is, prescribes different treatment – amongst classes of individuals.
#Whether the differentiation is founded on an intelligible [[wikt:differentia#Noun|differentia]] (distinguishing feature).
#Whether the basis of differentiation bears a reasonable relation to the object of the statute.

The purpose of the test is to ensure that the right to equal protection is upheld by guarding against three forms of arbitrariness. First, individuals in the same class must share common features and should not be classified arbitrarily. Secondly, the treatment of persons falling within the same class must not be arbitrary. Lastly, the basis of classification must not be arbitrary but should bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the executive action.&lt;ref&gt;''Taw Cheng Kong'' (H.C.), p. 93, para. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The stages of the rational nexus test directly address these forms of arbitrariness. As such, a law that satisfies all the stages of the test will be found to be valid and constitutional.

=====Stage 1: Whether the law differentiates=====
The first stage of the test considers whether the law prescribes different treatment for one group of individuals as against other groups. For example, in the 1998 [[High Court of Singapore|High Court]] decision ''Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor'', Judge of Appeal M. Karthigesu found that the [[Prevention of Corruption Act (Singapore)|Prevention of Corruption Act]]&lt;ref name=PCA&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Prevention of Corruption Act|titlelink=Prevention of Corruption Act (Singapore)|cap=241|ed=1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; differentiated between classes of people as it renders some, but not all, persons open to criminal prosecution in Singapore for offences committed outside Singapore.&lt;ref name="Taw HC 37"&gt;''Taw Cheng Kong'' (H.C.), p. 96, para. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

While earlier cases expressed this stage of the test as a determination of whether a law is discriminatory, the Court of Appeal has warned against the confusing of the concepts of differentiation and discrimination. A differentiating law is one that draws distinctions between groups of people. A discriminatory law or executive act, on the other hand, is one that contravenes Article 12(1) and hence is unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;''Taw Cheng Kong'' (C.A.), p. 508, para. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the mere finding of a differentiating measure in this first stage does not necessarily make the law discriminatory, as the other two stages will still have to be taken into consideration. If the impugned statute does not contain such a differentiating measure, it is a good law and the objection fails.

Even if a differentiating measure is found, there is a strong [[presumption of constitutionality|presumption that it is constitutional]]. The legislature must necessarily have a wide power of classification in making laws that operate differently for different groups of people in order to give effect to its policy.&lt;ref&gt;''Malaysian Bar'', p. 170, cited in ''Taw Cheng Kong'' (C.A.), p. 508, para. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Unless the law is plainly arbitrary, suggesting examples of arbitrariness are not ordinarily helpful in rebutting this presumption of constitutionality. It is presumed that Parliament knows best for its people, and is experienced in making laws directed at societal problems, hence its differentiation is based on adequate grounds. Therefore, to rebut this presumption it is necessary for the person challenging the law to adduce some material or factual evidence to show that it was enacted arbitrarily or had operated arbitrarily.&lt;ref&gt;''Taw Cheng Kong'' (C.A.), p. 514, para. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Stage 2: Intelligible differentia=====
The second stage of the rational nexus test looks at whether the basis for differentiation is founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes those who are grouped together from those left outside the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LIIofIndia|litigants=State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali|court=INSC|year=1952|num=1|parallelcite=A.I.R. 1952 S.C. 75, [1952] S.C.R. 284 at 334|courtname=S.C.|juris=India}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To satisfy the second stage, there must be a discernible basis of classification. All persons being discriminated against by a law must share a common identifying mark that is not borne by those not discriminated against. Examples of such features include gender, age, race, religion, seniority of professional qualification and area of residence.&lt;ref name="Taw HC 33"&gt;''Taw Cheng Kong'' (H.C.), p. 94, para. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Another feature that has been accepted by the courts as constituting an intelligible differentia is Singapore citizenship.&lt;ref name="Taw HC 37"/&gt; Singling out a person or object with characteristics not peculiar to itself, but which may conceivably be found in other persons or objects, does not constitute classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=S[u] M[ien] Huang-Thio|title=Equal Protection and Rational Classification|journal=Public Law|year=1963|pages=412–440 at 414}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If there is no consistent means of identifying the persons treated differently, the differentiation is arbitrary and the law is invalid. If there is an intelligible differentia, the differentiation is not arbitrary in this sense and it is necessary to proceed to the third stage.

Equality under Article 12(1) does not require that all persons are treated alike, but rather that all persons in like situations should be treated alike.&lt;ref name="Taw Cheng Kong (HC)"/&gt; Similarly, failing to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different also amounts to inequality. As such, at the second stage the question to be considered is whether persons falling within the same class are treated equally. Article 12(1) prohibits laws which require that some individuals within a single class should be treated more harshly than others.&lt;ref name="Ong Ah Chuan 35"&gt;''Ong Ah Chuan'', [1979-1980] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 725, para. 35, [1981] 1 A.C. at p. 673.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the law is not unconstitutional if all persons discriminated against are equally discriminated against, and all persons not discriminated against are equally not discriminated against.&lt;ref name="Taw HC 33"/&gt; The courts have found this stage to be satisfied where under a statute all citizens are equally liable to prosecution, whereas all non-citizens are equally immune from it.&lt;ref name="Taw HC 37"/&gt; The second stage test was also found to have been satisfied where all members of the Singapore Congregation of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] found to have been in violation of the [[Societies Act (Singapore)|Societies Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Societies Act|titlelink=Societies Act (Singapore)|cap=311|ed=1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; were treated equally.&lt;ref name="Dennis Kok 40"&gt;''Kok Hoong Tan Dennis'', p. 581, para. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Stage 3: Reasonable relation to statutory objective=====
In this stage, it is necessary to inquire into, firstly, the object of the statute, and secondly, whether the basis of differentiation against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object. The essence of the test is whether it is reasonable, taking into consideration the object of the statute, to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation. As such, it is necessary to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers the object of the statute.&lt;ref name="Taw HC 33"/&gt; The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved, and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional.

In ''Taw Cheng Kong'', the respondent challenged his conviction for corruption on the ground that section 37 of the Prevention of Corruption Act,&lt;ref name=PCA/&gt; which extends the effect of the Act to corrupt acts by Singapore citizens (but not non-citizens) occurring outside Singapore, discriminated against citizens and thus violated Article 12(1). The Court of Appeal held that the distinction drawn by the section 37 between citizens and non-citizens who are abroad is valid as it is a reasonable means of achieving the Act's object, which is to address acts of corruption taking place outside Singapore but affecting events within it. The exclusion of non-citizens from the ambit of section 37 observes international comity and the sovereignty of other nations.&lt;ref&gt;''Taw Cheng Kong'' (C.A.), p. 512, para. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticisms of the test====

=====Unreasonable legislative objectives=====
In equal protection cases, the purpose of the law must be distilled before the reasonableness of a classification can be judged. When the purpose of the law is not explicitly stated, the court may conclude that there is no legitimate public purpose, assume that there is a legitimate public purpose but refuse to look for it, or draw some inferences as to what it is. When the purpose of the law is explicitly stated, the court may either accept it at face value; or challenge the integrity of the legislative declaration, looking behind the explicit purpose to determine the true purpose. In the latter situation, what is concerned is the discriminatory character of the legislation. The need to identify the legislative purpose has been said to involve the court in the "thornier aspects of judicial review", because it must either "uncritically and often unrealistically accept a legislative avowal at face value" or "challenge legislative integrity and push beyond the express statement into unconfined realms of inference". The court must then "make a judgment as to the purity of legislative motive and ... determine the legitimacy of the end".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Joseph Tussman|authorlink=Joseph Tussman|author2=Jacobus tenBroek|title=The Equal Protection of the Laws|journal=[[California Law Review]]|year=1949|volume=37|issue=3|pages=341–381 at 366–367|doi=10.2307/3477801|jstor=3477801}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This step is necessary because the rational nexus test is not foolproof. The test is based on the presumption that the legislative object itself is not in violation of the Constitution. However, if the object of the statute is itself illegitimate, a classification may be invalid even if it satisfies the test. Hence, the test is only applicable if the object of the impugned legislation is a proper one.&lt;ref&gt;Huang-Thio, p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, a solution was proffered by means of a more holistic approach to the constitutional promise of equality. In ''[[Maneka Gandhi]] v. Union of India'' (1978),&lt;ref name="Maneka Gandhi"&gt;{{cite LIIofIndia|litigants=Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India|court=INSC|year=1978|num=16|parallelcite=A.I.R. 1978 S.C. 597|courtname=S.C.|juris=India}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the learned Justice [[Prafullachandra Natwarlal Bhagwati]] noted that "an essential element of equality pervades Article 14", the equivalent of Singapore's Article 12. With that as a starting point, he went on to assert that "the procedure ... must be right and just and fair and not arbitrary". The judge in ''Maneka Gandhi'' therefore spoke for a dynamic approach to equality, one that should not be "subjected to a narrow, pedantic or lexicographic approach".&lt;ref&gt;''Maneka Gandhi'', p. 625.&lt;/ref&gt; This more liberal approach, which accords courts the latitude to deal with legislation backed by arbitrary or unreasonable objectives, was cited with approval in Malaysia by the learned Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram in ''[[Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan &amp; Another|Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan &amp; Another|Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan]]'' [1996] 1 M.L.J. 261, C.A. (Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear, though, if this test will be applied in Singapore due to a dearth of case law on the matter.

=====Over- and under-inclusiveness=====
Another problem encountered when applying the rational nexus test is that of over- and under-inclusiveness. Under-inclusiveness occurs when the legislative classification fails to embrace all persons within the ambit of the objective sought to be achieved by the law.&lt;ref name="Thio 433"&gt;Huang-Thio, p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, over-inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the legislative objective, but also persons outside it.&lt;ref name="Huang-Thio 435"&gt;Huang-Thio, p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt; Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational nexus test, as a classification can still bear a rational relation to the legislative objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires.

It has been argued that this results in the different treatment of persons in like situations, and thus violates Article 12(1). Although a rational connection exists between the classification adopted and the legislative object, the effect of an under-inclusive classification is to accord different treatment to persons similarly placed.&lt;ref name="Thio 433"/&gt; However, the courts have often justified under-inclusiveness on the ground that the legislature is free to recognize degrees of harm, to confine its restrictions to cases where the need is felt to be the greatest, and to advance its policies step by step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LIIofIndia|litigants=State of Bombay v. Balsara|court=INSC|year=1951|num=38|parallelcite=A.I.R. 1951 S.C. 318, [1951] S.C.R. 682 at 708–710|courtname=S.C.|juris=India}} and ''Sashibhusan v. Mangala'' A.I.R. 1953 Orissa 171, [[Orissa High Court|High Court]] (Orissa, India), cited in Huang-Thio, p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, resort to legislative wisdom to justify under-inclusiveness, if used indiscriminately, may result in the watering down of the equal protection guarantee provided by Article 12(1).

In a 1943 case brought by him, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] upheld the constitutionality of an executive order imposing on American citizens of Japanese ancestry a [[curfew]] and an obligation to register for removal from a designated military area, even though it was over-inclusive.
|}

Similarly, where an over-inclusive classification is concerned, a rational relation still exists between the differentia adopted and the legislative object. Thus, it is tolerated under the rational nexus test in Singapore. While the effect of an over-inclusive classification may be to accord similar treatment to persons differently placed,&lt;ref name="Huang-Thio 435"/&gt; courts have nonetheless justified it on the ground that the exigencies of the situation require such classification. The US Supreme Court case ''[[Hirabayashi v. United States]]'' (1943)&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hirabayashi v. United States]]'' {{ussc|320|81|1943}}, cited in Huang-Thio, p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of this principle. Following the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] issued an [[executive order (United States)|executive order]] requiring, among other things, all persons of Japanese ancestry within a designated military area to be "within their place of residence between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m." and to report to the authorities to register for removal from the military area. The defendant, [[Gordon Hirabayashi]], was convicted of violating the [[curfew]] and the registration requirement. The order was arguably over-inclusive as it did not distinguish between Japanese Americans who were loyal to the US and those in respect of which there was evidence of disloyalty. Although the Court noted that distinctions between citizens solely on the basis of ancestry "are, by their very nature, odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality",&lt;ref&gt;''Hirabayashi'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; because the US was at war with Japan the race-based classification bore a rational relation to the aim of the order, which was to protect from sabotage war materials and utilities in areas believed to be in danger of Japanese invasion and air attack. The Court said: "We cannot close our eyes to the fact, demonstrated by experience, that, in time of war, residents having ethnic affiliations with an invading enemy may be a greater source of danger than those of a different ancestry."&lt;ref&gt;''Hirabayashi'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Taw Cheng Kong'', the High Court was of the view that section 37(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act was both under- and over-inclusive. It did not apply to non-Singapore citizens such as permanent residents and foreigners working for the Government who received bribes for acts which would be done in Singapore. On the other hand, it would catch a Singapore citizen now a foreign permanent resident employed in a foreign country by a foreign government who received a bribe in relation to a transaction that had nothing to do with Singapore. For this reason, Karthigesu J. found section 37(1) to be unconstitutional since the nexus between the classification and section 37(1)'s objective was not reasonable enough to justify derogating from Article 12(1).&lt;ref&gt;''Taw Cheng Kong'' (H.C.), p. 104, paras. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court's decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal, which held that the under-inclusiveness was not fatal because of the "overriding need to observe international
comity". In any case, "[t]he enactment of a provision need not be seamless and perfect to cover every contingency. Such a demand would be legislatively impractical, if not impossible." The over-inclusiveness of section 37(1) was deemed irrelevant to the constitutional issue because the provision applied equally to all Singapore citizens.&lt;ref&gt;''Taw Cheng Kong'' (C.A.), p. 514, paras. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Applications of the rational nexus test====
The rational nexus test was applied in ''Mohamed Emran bin Mohamed Ali v. Public Prosecutor'' (2008),&lt;ref&gt;''Mohamed Emran bin Mohamed Ali v. Public Prosecutor'' [2008] 4 S.L.R.(R.) 411, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; in which the High Court was faced with the issue of whether the failure to prosecute drug enforcement authorities in an [[entrapment]] case amounted to discrimination against the persons eventually charged with drug trafficking. The Court found that there was a "perfectly rational nexus between entrapment operations and the socially desirable and laudable objective of containing the drug trade"&lt;ref&gt;''Mohamed Emran'', p. 422, para. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; as convicting state agents who carried out covert operations would result in illicit drug suppliers prospering and flourishing while enforcement agencies would "wither and perish".&lt;ref&gt;''Mohamed Emran'', p. 423, para. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the exercise of the Attorney-General's [[enforcement discretion|prosecutorial discretion]] was an executive act which satisfied the rational nexus test and was therefore not in contravention of Article 12 of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''Mohamed Emran'', p. 421, para. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor]]'' (2010),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor]]'' [2010] 3 S.L.R. 489, C.A. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal had to determine the validity of a differentiating factor prescribed by the legislature for distinguishing between different classes of offenders for [[sentence (law)|sentencing]] purposes. In that case, the differentiating factor was found in the [[Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)|Misuse of Drugs Act]] ("MDA"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Misuse of Drugs Act|titlelink=Misuse of Drugs Act (Singapore)|cap=185|ed=2008}} ("MDA").&lt;/ref&gt; which stipulated that an accused trafficking in more than {{convert|15|g}} of diamorphine (heroin) would result in him or her facing a mandatory death penalty upon conviction. Following its previous decision in ''[[Van Tuong Nguyen|Nguyen Tuong Van]] v. Public Prosecutor'' (2005),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Van Tuong Nguyen|Nguyen Tuong Van]] v. Public Prosecutor'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20101115085712/http://www.singaporelaw.sg/rss/judg/46431.html &amp;#91;2004&amp;#93; SGCA 47], [2005] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 103, C.A. (Singapore), archived from [http://www.singaporelaw.sg/rss/judg/46431.html the original] on 15 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; which had applied ''Ong Ah Chuan'',&lt;ref name="Ong Ah Chuan 37"/&gt; the Court applied the rational nexus test and found that the 15-gram differentia bore a reasonable relation to the social object of the MDA. The Court also noted that the "quantity of addictive drugs trafficked is not only broadly proportionate to the quantity of addictive drugs brought onto the illicit market, but also broadly proportionate to the scale of operations of the drug dealer and, hence, broadly proportionate to the harm likely to be posed to society by the offender's crime."&lt;ref&gt;''Yong Vui Kong'', p. 537, para. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''Taw Cheng Kong'' was not cited in this case, the test applied was substantially similar to that which it enunciated in ''Taw Cheng Kong''.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Nguyen Tuong Van'', p. 123, para. 70, the Court of Appeal noted that the test has been applied locally numerous times, such as in ''Kok Hoong Tan Dennis v. Public Prosecutor'' [1996] 3 S.L.R.(R.) 570, H.C. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternatives to the rational nexus test====
In other jurisdictions, courts have applied standards of [[judicial review#Judicial review of primary legislation|judicial review]] more exacting than the rational nexus test in Singapore when deciding if a law is unconstitutional. It remains to be seen whether any of these approaches will be adopted locally.

=====Three-tiered scrutiny=====
In footnote 4 of ''[[United States v. Carolene Products Co.]]'' (1938),&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Carolene Products Co.]]'' {{ussc|304|144|pin=153|1938}}, S.C. (United States).&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Harlan F. Stone]] opined that where legislation was aimed at "discrete and insular minorities" who lack the normal protections of the political process, a more exacting standard of judicial review with no presumption of constitutionality should be applied.

[[File:Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone photograph circa 1927-1932.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Justice [[Harlan F. Stone|Harlan Fiske Stone]] (1872–1946) photographed ''c.''&amp;nbsp;1925–1932. Stone J. authored the well-known footnote 4 of ''[[United States v. Carolene Products Co.]]'' (1938), which suggested that a stricter standard of [[judicial review#Judicial view of primary legislation|judicial review]] should be applied to legislation impacting upon "discrete and insular minorities".]]

At present in the United States there are three different levels of scrutiny. Firstly, if a law categorizes on the basis of race or national origin (which are regarded as [[suspect classification]]s), or infringes a fundamental right, [[strict scrutiny]] is applied. Accordingly, the law is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''[[McLaughlin v. Florida]]'' {{ussc|379|184|pin=192|1964}}, S.C. (United States); ''[[Plyler v. Doe]]'' {{ussc|457|202|pin=217|1982}}, S.C. (United States).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there should not be a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest. Secondly, if the law categorizes on the basis of gender, legitimacy or similar [[suspect classification#Quasi-suspect class|quasi-suspect classifications]], [[intermediate scrutiny]] is applied – the law is unconstitutional unless it is substantially related to an important government interest.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''[[Craig v. Boren]]'' {{ussc|429|190|pin=210|1976}}, S.C. (United States); ''Plyler'', p. 218, n. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the traditional [[rational basis review]] is applied if the law categorizes on some other, non-suspect, basis. In this case, the law is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Aaron Baker|title=Proportional, Not Strict, Scrutiny: Against a U.S. 'Suspect Classifications' Model under Article 14 ECHR in the U.K.|journal=[[American Journal of Comparative Law]]|year=2008|volume=56|pages=847–894 at 865–882|doi=10.5131/ajcl.2007.0030}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Malaysian Bar v. Government of Malaysia'' (1987), the Supreme Court of Malaysia referred to the strict scrutiny approach but asserted that in reality it was not very different from the traditional rational nexus standard, which it then proceeded to apply. The Court's endorsement of strict scrutiny was much less ambiguous in ''Government of Malaysia v. V.R. Menon'' (1990).&lt;ref&gt;''Government of Malaysia v. V.R. Menon'' [1990] 1 M.L.J. 277, S.C. (Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt; It held that the impugned Act was concerned with economic and social welfare and not fundamental rights, and therefore the trial judge had erred in applying a stricter standard of review. As such, the court implicitly endorsed the application of the strict scrutiny test in cases concerning fundamental rights in Malaysia.

There are several criticisms of the three-tiered scrutiny analysis, the most compelling reason against its adoption arguably being that it does not control judicial discretion: the identification of classifications as suspect, quasi-suspect or non-suspect involves unconstrained balancing of public and private interests, and political and social interests.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 878.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Test of proportionality=====
The test of proportionality in English law, which is applied to determine whether a fundamental right is appropriately restricted by legislation, has three limbs:&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite BAILII|litigants=R. (Daly) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department|court=UKHL|year=2001|num=26|parallelcite=[2001] 2 A.C. 532 at 547|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

#The legislative objective must be sufficiently important to justify limiting the fundamental right.
#The measures designed to meet the legislative objective must be rationally connected to it.
#The means used to impair the right must be no more than is necessary to accomplish the objective.

It has been suggested that a proportionality analysis better safeguards equality compared to the American three-tiered scrutiny approach.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 877.&lt;/ref&gt; The third limb of the proportionality test may also serve to strike down over-inclusive classifications which are currently tolerated under the rational nexus test.

=====Test of reasonableness=====
In ''Maneka Gandhi'',&lt;ref name="Maneka Gandhi"/&gt; Bhagwati J. appeared to suggest that the rational nexus test should not be applied to Article 14 of the Indian Constitution, which guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the law, because it led to a narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision. He held that Article 14 should not be construed too narrowly as it was the pillar on which the foundation of the Indian Democratic Republic rested. In his view, the principle of reasonableness was an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness, and it pervaded Article 14 "like a brooding omnipresence".&lt;ref&gt;''Maneka Gandhi'', p. 625, cited in ''Danaharta Urus Sdn. Bhd. v. Kekatong Sdn. Bhd.'' [2004] 2 M.L.J. 257 at 276–277, para. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

A test of reasonableness was applied to Article 8(1) of the Malaysian Constitution in some cases,&lt;ref&gt;See generally ''Tan Tek Seng'', p. 283; ''Ahmad Tajudin bin Hj. Ishak v. Suruhanjaya Pelabuhan Pulau Pinang'' [1997] 1 M.L.J. 241 at 257, C.A. (Malaysia).&lt;/ref&gt; but it was later rejected by the [[Federal Court of Malaysia|Federal Court]] in ''Danaharta Urus Sdn. Bhd. v. Kekatong Sdn. Bhd.'' (2004). The Court noted that in cases subsequent to ''Maneka Gandhi'' the reasonable classification test had been applied, even by Bhagwati J. himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Danaharta Urus'', pp. 277–279, paras. 44–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, equality under Article 8(1) does not mean absolute equality, but only assures the right to equal treatment with other individuals in similar circumstances.&lt;ref name="Ong Ah Chuan 35"/&gt; The rational nexus test is needed to determine if a law applies equally to all persons in the same group, and is therefore an "integral part" of Article 8(1).&lt;ref&gt;''Danaharta Urus'', pp. 273–274, paras. 33 and 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discriminatory application of laws==
The traditional ''Taw Cheng Kong'' rational nexus test is inappropriate where the issue is not the existence of discriminatory classification in a statute, but discriminatory application of a neutral statute.  This is because the statute would inevitably pass the test as the answer to whether the legislation in question differentiates between different classes of persons (stage 1 of the ''Taw Cheng Kong'' test) will always be in the negative. In ''[[Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General]]'' (2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CommonLII|litigants=Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General|court=SGCA|year=2009|num=1|parallelcite=[2009] 2 S.L.R. 542|courtname=C.A.|juris=Singapore}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Judge of Appeal [[Andrew Phang]], delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, applied a modified form of the ''Taw Cheng Kong'' test, holding that "[t]he question is whether there is a reasonable nexus between the state action and the objective to be achieved by the law".&lt;ref&gt;''Eng Foong Ho'', p. 550, para. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phang J.A. relied on the principles set out in the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] cases ''Howe Yoon Chong v. Chief Assessor'' (1980)&lt;ref&gt;''Howe Yoon Chong v. Chief Assessor'' [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1980/1980_26.html &amp;#91;1980&amp;#93; UKPC 26], [1979–1980] S.L.R.(R.) 594, [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] (on appeal from Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Howe Yoon Chong v. Chief Assessor'' (1990),&lt;ref&gt;''Howe Yoon Chong v. Chief Assessor'' [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1990/1990_7.html &amp;#91;1990&amp;#93; UKPC 7], [1990] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 78, P.C. (on appeal from Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; drawing the following salient points from them:

*An executive act may be unconstitutional if it amounts to intentional and arbitrary discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;''Eng Foong Ho'', p. 553, para. 30, citing ''Public Prosecutor v. Ang Soon Huat'' [1990] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 246 at 258, para. 23, H.C. (Singapore), which in turn cited ''Howe Yoon Chong'' (1990), p. 84, para. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, an intentional systematic undervaluation of property would breach Article 12(1) of the Constitution, though "something less might perhaps suffice".&lt;ref name="Eng 28"&gt;''Eng Foong Ho'', p. 551, para. 28, citing ''Howe Yoon Chong'' (1980), p. 600, para. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;
*However, absolute equality is not attainable and inequalities arising from "the application of a reasonable administrative policy"&lt;ref&gt;''Eng Foong Ho'', p. 552, para. 29, citing ''Howe Yoon Chong'' (1990), p. 84, para. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  or "mere errors of judgement"&lt;ref&gt;''Eng Foong Ho'', p. 551, para. 29, citing ''Howe Yoon Chong'' (1990), p. 83, para. 13, itself citing ''Sunday Lake Iron Co. v. Township of Wakefield'' {{ussc|247|350|pin=352|1918}}, [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] (United States).&lt;/ref&gt; are not sufficient to constitute a violation of Article 12(1). Inequalities due to "inadvertence or inefficiency" need to be on "a very substantial scale" to violate the Article.&lt;ref name="Eng 28"/&gt;

[[Thio Li-ann]] has expressed the view that Phang J.A.'s approach in ''Eng Foong Ho'' leaves room for judicial clarification. An important question is whether the "intentional and arbitrary discrimination" test, which implies the lack of any rationality,&lt;ref&gt;''Ang Soon Huat'', p. 258, para. 23, cited in ''Eng Foong Ho'', p. 553, para. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; is the sole test for proving that an executive act violates Article 12, or only one possible test. If it is the only test, then the need to prove the absence of rationality is excessively onerous for the plaintiff to satisfy, compared to the "reasonable classification" test.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Thio Li-ann|authorlink=Thio Li-ann|title=Administrative and Constitutional Law|journal=Singapore Academy of Law Annual Review of Singapore Cases|year=2009|volume=10|pages=1–37 at 11, para. 1.24}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She posits that it is preferable for both the "intentional and arbitrary discrimination" test and the "reasonable classification" test to apply to executive acts.&lt;ref&gt;Thio, "Administrative and Constitutional Law", p. 12, para 1.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restrictions on the right to equality and equal protection==
[[File:Central Sikh Temple.JPG|thumb|Singapore's oldest ''[[gurdwara]]'', the [[Central Sikh Temple]]. Laws such as the Central Sikh Gurdwara Board Act are exempt from compliance with Article 12.]]

Article 12(3) of the Constitution provides that Article 12 does not invalidate or prohibit any provision regulating personal law; or any provision or practice restricting office or employment connected with the affairs of any religion, or of an institution managed by a group professing any religion, to persons professing that religion.

Personal law is the law governing a person's family matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=personal law|editor=Bryan A. Garner|editor-link=Bryan A.

(Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; the High Court identified a number of personal laws, including the Intestate Succession Act&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Intestate Succession Act|cap=146|ed=1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which does not apply to Muslims; and regulations 103(2) and (3) of the Prisons Regulations,&lt;ref&gt;Prisons Regulations (Cap. 248, Rg. 2, 2002 Rev. Ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; which respectively state that Jewish prisoners can claim an exemption against working on Saturdays and may observe certain festival days as may be allowed by the Government, and that Muslim prisoners may fast during [[Ramadan]] and have their work reduced during this period.&lt;ref&gt;''Shafeeg bin Salim Talib'', pp. 444–445, paras. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[private bill|private Acts]] establishing religious organizations expressly confine membership of their governing boards to persons professing the respective religions. For instance, a person may only be appointed to the [[Hindu Endowments Board]], which administers [[Hinduism|Hindu]] religious and charitable [[financial endowment|endowments]], if he or she is Hindu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Hindu Endowments Act|cap=364|ed=1994}}, s. 5(4)(a).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, one may only be a member of the Central Sikh Gurdwara Board, which manages ''[[gurdwara]]s'' (Sikh temples) in Singapore, if one professes the [[Sikhism|Sikh faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Central Sikh Gurdwara Board Act|cap=357|ed=1985}}, ss. 3(3) and 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 149(1) immunizes the [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Internal Security Act|titlelink=Internal Security Act (Singapore)|cap=143|ed=1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from invalidity due to inconsistency with five of the fundamental liberty provisions in the Constitution, including Article 12.&lt;ref&gt;The other provisions are Arts. 9, 11, 13 and 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The reference to Article 12 in Article 149(1) was enacted by Parliament in 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act|no=1|year=1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to reverse the effect of ''[[Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs]]'' (1988),&lt;ref&gt;[1988] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 525, C.A. (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Court of Appeal expressed the view that sections 8 and 10 of the Act violated Article 12(1).

==Other constitutional provisions==
[[Article 16 of the Constitution of Singapore|Article 16(1)]] of the Constitution prohibits discrimination against citizens of Singapore on the ground only of religion, race, descent or place of birth in the administration of public educational institutions (and, in particular, as regards the admission of students or the payment of fees), and in providing financial aid from public funds for the maintenance or education of students in any educational institution. This provision is stated to be "[w]ithout prejudice to the generality of Article 12". Article 16(2) declares that religious groups have the right to establish and maintain institutions for the education of children and to provide them religious instruction in those institutions, but there must not be any discrimination on the ground only of religion in laws relating to such institutions or the administration of such laws.

Article 154 states that all persons who are in the same Government service grade must be treated impartially regardless of their race, subject to the terms and conditions of their employment and to other provisions of the Constitution.

The Constitution also establishes a procedure for ensuring that statutes do not contain "differentiating measures", that is, measures which discriminate against any racial or religious community.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Most bills&lt;ref&gt;[[Money bill]]s; bills which affect defence or security or which relate to public safety, peace or good order; and urgent bills need not be submitted to the PCMR: Constitution, Art. 78(7).&lt;/ref&gt; that have been passed by Parliament must be scrutinized by a non-elected advisory body called the [[Presidential Council for Minority Rights]] (PCMR), which must report to the [[Speaker of the Parliament of Singapore|Speaker of Parliament]] if it is of the view that any clause in a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] contains a differentiating measure.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; If the PCMR submits an adverse report, Parliament can either make amendments to the bill and resubmit it to the Council for approval, or decide to present the bill for the President's assent nonetheless provided that a Parliamentary motion for such action has been passed by at least two-thirds of all [[List of Singapore MPs|Members of Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;Constitution, Art. 78(6)(c).&lt;/ref&gt; The PCMR has not rendered any adverse reports since it was set up in 1970.

'''Association of ideas''', or '''mental association''', is a process by which representations arise in [[consciousness]], and also for a principle put forward by an important historical school of thinkers to account generally for the succession of mental phenomena.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}} The term is now used mostly in the [[history of philosophy]] and of [[History of psychology|psychology]]. One idea was thought to follow another in consciousness if it were associated by some principle. The three commonly asserted principles of association were similarity, contiguity, and contrast, numerous others had been added by the nineteenth century. By the end of the nineteenth century [[physiological psychology]] was so altering the approach to this subject that much of the older associationist theory was rejected.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}

Everyday observation of the association of one idea or memory with another gives a face validity to the notion. In addition, the notion of association between ideas and behavior gave some early impetus to [[Behaviorism|behaviorist thinking]]. The core ideas of associationist thinking recur in some recent thought on [[cognition]], especially consciousness.

==Early theory==
The associationist theory is anticipated in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'', as part of the doctrine of [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]. The idea of Simmias is recalled by the picture of Simmias (similarity) and that of a friend by the sight of the lyre on which he played (contiguity).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=785}} But [[Aristotle]] is credited with originating associationist thinking based on this passage:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}

{{Quote|
"When, therefore, we accomplish an act of Reminiscence, we pass through a certain series of precursive movements, until we arrive at a movement, on which the one we are in quest of is habitually consequent. Hence too it is, that we hunt through the mental train, excogitating from the present or some other, and from its similar or contrary or coadjacent. Through this process Reminiscence is effected. For the movements are, in these cases, sometimes at the same, sometimes at the same time, sometimes parts of the same whole; so that the subsequent movement is already more than half accomplished."|
Aristotle as translated by W. Hamilton|&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''[[On Memory|De Memoria et Reminiscentia]]'', as translated by Sir William Hamilton and appended to his edition of Reid's Works: [https://archive.org/details/worksnowfullyco02reiduoft|The Works of Thomas D.D. Reid by Sir William Hamilton], Vol 2., 8th Edition, Edinburgh, Maclachlan and Stewart, 1880, pp. 897-900.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The passage is obscure, but it indicates the principles known as contiguity, similarity, and contrast. Similar principles are stated by [[Zeno the Stoic]], by [[Epicurus]] (see ''Diogenes Laertius'' vii. § 52, x. § 32), and by St [[Augustine of Hippo]] (''Confessions'', x. c. 19). Aristotle's doctrine was expanded and illustrated during throughout the Middle Ages, and in some cases even into the 17th century. [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]] listed philosophical authorities who gave prominence to the general fact of mental association - the Spanish philosopher [[Ludovicus Vives]] (1492-1540) especially being exhaustive in his account of memory.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}

In [[Thomas Hobbes]]'s psychology much importance is assigned to what he called, variously, the succession, sequence, series, consequence, coherence, train of imaginations or thoughts in mental discourse. But not before [[David Hume]] is there an express question as to what are the distinct principles of association. [[John Locke]] had, meanwhile, introduced the phrase "association of ideas" as the title of a supplementary chapter incorporated with the fourth edition of his ''Essay'', though with little or no suggestion of its general psychological import. Hume reduced the principles of association to three: similarity, contiguity in time and place, and cause and/or effect. [[Dugald Stewart]] suggested resemblance, contrariety, and vicinity in time and place, though he added, as another obvious principle, accidental coincidence in the sounds of words, and further noted three other cases of relation: cause and effect, means and end, and premise and conclusion, as connecting trains of thought under circumstances of special attention. [[Thomas Reid]], made light of association, remarking that it seems to require only the power of habit to explain the spontaneous recurrence of trains of thinking, which become familiar by frequent repetition (''Intellectual Powers'', p.&amp;nbsp;387).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}

Hamilton's own theory of mental reproduction, suggestion, or association is a development of his ideas in ''Lectures on Metaphysics'' (vol. ii. p.&amp;nbsp;223, seq.), which reduced the principles of association to simultaneity and affinity, and these further to one supreme principle of [[Redintegration]] or totality. In the final scheme he sets out four general laws of mental succession:
*(1) Associability or possible co-suggestion (all thoughts of the same mental subject are associable or capable of suggesting each other);
*(2) Repetition or direct remembrance (thoughts identical in a modification, but differing in time, tend to suggest each other);
*(3) Redintegration, indirect remembrance or reminiscence (thoughts once identical in time, but different as mental modes, are suggestive of each other in the order they originally held);
*(4) Preference (thoughts are suggested not merely by the general subjective relation subsisting between them, they are also suggested in proportion to the amount of interest they hold to the individual mind).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}

These special laws logically follow from the general laws above:
*A - Primary - modes of the laws of Repetition and Redintegration:
**(1) law of Similars (Analogy, Affinity);
**(2) law of Contrast; and
**(3) law of Coadjacency (Cause and Effect, etc.).
*B - Secondary - modes of the law of Preference, under the law of Possibility:
**(1) laws of Immediacy and Homogeneity and
**(2) law of Facility.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}

==The Associationist School==
The "Associationist School" includes the English psychologists who aimed at explaining all mental acquisitions and the more complex mental processes generally under laws under the associations which their predecessors applied only to simple reproduction. Hamilton, though professing to deal with reproduction only, formulates a number of still more general laws of mental succession: law of Succession, law of Variation, law of Dependence, law of Relativity or Integration (involving law of Conditioned), and, finally, law of Intrinsic or Objective Relativity. These he posits as the highest to which human consciousness is subject, but it is in a sense quite different that the psychologists of the Associationist School intend their appropriation of the principle or principles commonly signalized. In this regard, as far as can be judged from imperfect records, they were anticipated to some extent by the experientialists of ancient times, both Stoic and Epicurean (cf. ''Diogenes Laertius'', as above).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}

In the period that led to modern philosophy, Hobbes was the first thinker of permanent note to whom this doctrine may be traced. Although he took a narrow view of the phenomena of mental succession, he (after dealing with trains of imagination or "mental discourse") sought in the higher departments of intellect to explain reasoning as a discourse in words, dependent upon an arbitrary system of marks, each associated with or standing for a variety of imaginations. Except for a general assertion that reasoning is a reckoning (otherwise, a compounding and resolving), he had no other account of knowledge to give. The whole emotional side of mind ("the passions") he similarly resolved into an expectation of consequences based on past experience of pleasures and pains of sense. Thus, though he made no serious attempt to justify his analysis in detail, he is undoubtedly to be classed with the associationists of the next century. They, however, were wont to trace their psychological theory no further back than to Locke's ''Essay''. [[Bishop Berkeley]] was driven to posit expressly a principle of suggestion or association in these terms:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"That one idea may suggest another to the mind, it will suffice that they have been observed to go together, without any demonstration of the necessity of their coexistence, or so much as knowing what it is that makes them so to coexist''." (''New Theory of Vision'', § 25)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and, to support the obvious application of the principle to the case of the sensations of sight and touch before him, he constantly urged that association of sound and sense of language which the later school has always put in the foreground, whether as illustrating the principle in general or in explanation of the supreme importance of language for knowledge. It was natural, then, that Hume, coming after Berkeley and assuming Berkeley's results (though he reverted to the larger inquiry of Locke), should be more explicit in his reference to association. But Hume was original also, when he spoke of it as a "kind of attraction which in the mental world will be found to have as extraordinary effects as in the natural, and to show itself in as many and as various forms''." (''Human Nature'', i. 1, § 4){{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}

Other inquirers about the same time conceived of association with this breadth of view, and set themselves to track, as psychologists, its effects in detail.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}

===David Hartley===
[[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]] is the thinker most precisely identified with the Associationist School. In his ''Observations on Man'', published in 1749 (11 years after Hume's ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' and one year after the better known ''[[An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding]]''), opened the path for all the investigations of like nature that have been so characteristic of English psychology. A physician by profession, he sought to combine with an elaborate theory of mental association a minutely detailed hypothesis as to the corresponding action of the nervous system, based upon the suggestion of a vibratory motion within the nerves thrown out by [[Isaac Newton]] in the last paragraph of the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''. So far, however, from promoting the acceptance of the psychological theory, this physical hypothesis proved to have rather the opposite effect, and it began to be dropped by Hartley's followers (as [[Joseph Priestley]], in his abridged edition of the ''Observations'', 1775) before it was seriously impugned from without. When it is studied in the original, and not taken upon the report of hostile critics, who would not, or could not understand it, no little importance must still be accorded to the first attempt, not seldom a curiously felicitous one, to carry through that parallelism of the physical and psychical, which since then has come to count for more and more in the science of mind. Nor should it be forgotten that Hartley himself, for all his paternal interest in the doctrine of vibrations, was careful to keep separate from its fortunes the cause of his other doctrine of mental association. Of this the point lay in no mere restatement, with new precision, of a principle of coherence among "ideas" (which were also called by Hartley "vestiges", "types" and "images"), but in its being taken as a clue by which to follow the progressive development of the mind's powers. Holding that mental states could be scientifically understood only as they were analysed, Hartley sought for a principle of synthesis to explain the complexity exhibited not only in trains of representative images, but alike in the most involved combinations of reasonings and (as Berkeley had seen) in the apparently simple phenomena of objective perception, as well as in the varied play of the emotions, or, again, in the manifold conscious adjustments of the motor system. One principle appeared to him sufficient for all, running, as enunciated for the simplest case, thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Any sensations A, B, C, etc., by being associated with one another a sufficient number of times, get such a power over the corresponding ideas a, b, c, etc., that any one of the sensations A, when impressed alone, shall be able to excite in the mind b, c, etc., the ideas of the rest."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
To render the principle applicable in the cases where the associated elements are neither sensations nor simple ideas of sensations, Hartley's first care was to determine the conditions under which states other than these simplest ones have their rise in the mind, becoming the matter of ever higher and higher combinations. The principle itself supplied the key to the difficulty, when coupled with the notion, already implied in Berkeley's investigations, of a coalescence of simple ideas of sensation into one complex idea, which may cease to bear any obvious relation to its constituents. So far from being content, like Hobbes, to make a rough generalization to all mind from the phenomena of developed memory, as if these might be straightway assumed, Hartley made a point of referring them, in a subordinate place of their own, to his universal principle of mental synthesis. He expressly put forward the law of association, endued with such scope, as supplying what was wanting to Locke's doctrine in its more strictly psychological aspect, and thus marks by his work a distinct advance on the line of development of the experiential philosophy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=784}}

===Continuing reception===
The new doctrine received warm support from some, as [[William Law]] and Priestley, who both, like Hume and Hartley himself, took the principle of association as having the like import for the science of mind that gravitation had acquired for the science of matter. The principle began also, if not always with direct reference to Hartley, yet, doubtless, owing to his impressive advocacy of it, to be applied systematically in special directions, as by [[Abraham Tucker]] (1768) to [[morals]], and by [[Archibald Alison (author)|Archibald Alison]] (1790) to [[aesthetics]]. [[Thomas Brown (philosopher)|Thomas Brown]] (d. 1820) subjected anew to discussion the question of theory. Hardly less unjust to Hartley than Reid or Stewart had been, and forward to proclaim all that was different in his own position, Brown must yet be ranked with the associationists before and after him for the prominence he assigned to the associative principle in [[sensory perception]] (what he called "external affections of mind"), and for his reference of all other mental states ("internal affections") to the two generic capacities or susceptibilities of Simple and Relative Suggestion. He preferred the word "[[suggestion]]" to "association", which seemed to him to imply some prior connecting process, for which there was no evidence in many of the most important cases of suggestion, nor even, strictly speaking, in the case of contiguity in time where the term seemed least inapplicable. According to him, all that could be assumed was a general constitutional tendency of the mind to exist successively in states that have certain relations to each other, of itself only, and without any external cause or any influence previous to that operating at the moment of the suggestion. Brown's chief contribution to the general doctrine of mental association, besides what he did for the theory of perception, was, perhaps, his analysis of voluntary reminiscence and constructive [[imagination]], faculties that appear at first sight to lie altogether beyond the explanatory range of the principle. In [[James Mill]]'s ''Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind'' (1829), the principle, much as Hartley had conceived it, was carried out, with characteristic consequence, over the psychological field. With a much enlarged and more varied conception of association, [[Alexander Bain]] reexecuted the general psychological task, while Herbert Spencer revised the doctrine from the new point of view of the evolution hypothesis. [[John Stuart Mill]] made only occasional excursions into the region of psychology proper, but sought, in his ''System of Logic'' (1843), to determine the conditions of objective truth from the point of view of the associationist theory, and, thus or otherwise being drawn into general philosophical discussion, spread wider than any one before him its repute.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=785}}

===French and German associationists and Kant===
The Associationist School was composed chiefly of British thinkers, but in France also it had distinguished representatives. Of these it will suffice to mention [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], who professed to explain all knowledge from the single principle of association (liaison) of ideas, operating through a previous association with signs, verbal or other. In Germany, before the time of [[Immanuel Kant]], mental association was generally treated in the traditional manner, as by [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=785}}

Kant's inquiry into the foundations of knowledge, agreeing in its general purport with Locke's, however it differed in its critical procedure, brought him face to face with the newer doctrine that had been grafted on Locke's philosophy. To account for the fact of synthesis in cognition, in express opposition to associationism, as represented by Hume, was, in truth, his prime object, starting, as he did, from the assumption that there was in knowledge that which no mere association of experiences could explain.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=785}}

To the extent, therefore, that his influence prevailed, all inquiries made by the English associationists were discounted in Germany. Notwithstanding, under the very shadow of his authority a corresponding, if not related, movement was initiated by [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]]. As peculiar and widely different from anything conceived by the associationists as Herbart's metaphysical opinions were, he was at one with them and at variance with Kant in assigning fundamental importance to the psychological investigation of the development of consciousness. Further, his conception of the laws determining the interaction and flow of mental presentations and representations, when taken in its bare psychological import, was essentially similar to theirs. In [[Friedrich Eduard Beneke]]'s psychology also and in more recent inquiries conducted mainly by physiologists, mental association has been understood in its wider scope, as a general principle of explanation.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=785}}

===Differences among versions of associationist thought===
The associationists differ among themselves in the statement of their principle and, when they adduce several principles, in their conception of the relative importance of these.
* Hartley took account only of Contiguity, or the repetition of impressions synchronous or immediately successive.
* The same is true of James Mill, though, incidentally, he made an express attempt to resolve the received principle of Similarity and, through this, the other principle of Contrast, into his fundamental law (the law of Frequency, as he sometimes called it, because upon frequency, in conjunction with vividness of impressions, the strength of association, in his view, depended).
* In a sense of his own, Brown also, while accepting the common Aristotelian enumeration of principles, inclined to the opinion that "all suggestion may be found to depend on prior coexistence, or at least on such proximity as is itself very probably a modification of coexistence", provided account be taken of
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:"the influence of emotions and other feelings that are very different from ideas, as when an analogous object suggests an analogous object by the influence of an emotion which each separately may have produced before, and which is, therefore, common to both".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* To the contrary effect, Spencer maintained that the fundamental law of all mental association is that presentations aggregate or cohere with their like in past experience, and that, besides this law, there is in strictness no other, all further phenomena of association being incidental. Thus in particular, he would have explained association by Contiguity as due to the circumstance of imperfect assimilation of the present to the past in consciousness.
* [[Alexander Bain]] regarded Contiguity and Similarity logically, as perfectly distinct principles, though in actual psychological occurrence blending intimately with each other, contiguous trains being started by a first (it may be, implicit) representation through Similarity, while the express assimilation of present to past in consciousness is always, or tends to be, followed by the revival of what was presented in contiguity with that past.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=785}}

===Inseparable association===
The highest philosophical interest, as distinguished from that which is more strictly psychological, attaches to the mode of mental association called Inseparable. The coalescence of mental states noted by Hartley, as it had been assumed by Berkeley, was farther formulated by James Mill in these terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Some ideas are by frequency and strength of association so closely combined that they cannot be separated; if one exists, the other exists along with it in spite of whatever effort we make to disjoin them." (''Analysis of the Human Mind'', 2nd ed., vol. i, p. 93)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
John Stuart Mill's statement was more guarded and particular:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When two phenomena have been very often experienced in conjunction, and have not, in any single instance, occurred separately either in experience or in thought, there is produced between them what has been called inseparable, or, less correctly, indissoluble, association; by which is not meant that the association must inevitably last to the end of life - that no subsequent experience or process of thought can possibly avail to dissolve it; but only that as long as no such experience or process of thought has taken place, the association is irresistible; it is impossible for us to think the one thing disjoined from the other." (''Examination of Hamilton's Philosophy'', 2nd ed., p. 191)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is chiefly by John Stuart Mill that the philosophical application of the principle has been made. The first and most obvious application is to so-called necessary truths, those that are not merely analytic judgments but involve a synthesis of distinct notions. Again, the same thinker sought to prove Inseparable Association the ground of belief in an external objective world. The former application, especially, is facilitated, when the experience through which the association is supposed to be constituted is understood as cumulative in the race, and transmissible as original endowment to individuals - endowment that may be expressed either, subjectively, as latent intelligence or, objectively, as fixed nervous connexions. Spencer, as suggested before, is the author of this extended view of mental association.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=785}}

==Criticism in the 19th century==
In the later part of the 19th century the associationist theory was subjected to searching criticism, and it was maintained by many writers that the laws are both unsatisfactorily expressed and insufficient to explain the facts. Among the most vigorous and comprehensive of these investigations is that of [[F. H. Bradley]] in his ''Principles of Logic'' (1883). Having admitted the psychological fact of mental association, he attacks the theories of Mill and Bain primarily on the ground that they purport to give an account of mental life as a whole, a metaphysical doctrine of existence. According to this doctrine, mental activity is ultimately reducible to particular feelings, impressions, ideas, which are disparate and unconnected, until chance Association brings them together. On this assumption, the laws of Association naturally emerge in the following form:
* The law of Contiguity
:"Actions, sensations and states of feeling, occurring together or in close connexion, tend to grow together, or cohere, in such a way that, when any one of them is afterwards presented to the mind, the others are apt to be brought up in idea." (A. Bain, ''Senses and Intellect'', p. 327)
* The law of Similarity
:"Present actions, sensation, thoughts or emotions tend to revive their like among previous impressions or states." (A. Bain, ''Senses and Intellect'', p. 457{{snd}}compare J. S. Mill, ''Logic'', 9th ed., ii, p. 440){{sfn|Chisholm|pp=785–786}}

The fundamental objection to the law of Contiguity is that ideas and impressions, once experienced, do not recur; they are particular existences, and, as such, do not persevere to recur or be presented. So Mill is wrong in speaking of two impressions being "frequently experienced." Bradley claims thus to reduce the law to
:"When we have experienced (or even thought of) several pairs of impressions (simultaneous or successive), which pairs are like one another; then whenever an idea occurs which is like all the impressions on one side of these pairs, it tends to excite an idea which is like all the impressions on the other side."
This statement is destructive of the title of the law, because it appears that what were contiguous (the impressions) are not associated, and what are associated (the ideas) were not contiguous; in other words, the association is not due to contiguity at all.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=786}}

Proceeding to the law of Similarity (which in Mill's view is at the back of association by contiguity), and having made a similar criticism of its phrasing, Bradley maintains that it involves an even greater absurdity; if two ideas are to be recognized as similar, they must both be present in the mind; if one is to call up the other, one must be absent. To the obvious reply that the similarity is recognized ex post facto, and not while the former idea is being called up, Bradley replies simply that such a view reduces the law to the mere statement of a phenomenon and deprives it of any explanatory value, though he hardly makes it clear in what sense this necessarily invalidates the law from a psychological point of view. He further points out with greater force that in point of fact mere similarity is not the basis of ordinary cases of mental reproduction, inasmuch as in any given instance there is more difference than similarity between the ideas associated.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=786}}

Bradley himself bases association on identity plus contiguity:
:"Any part of a single state of mind tends, if reproduced, to re-instate the remainder."
or
:"Any element tends to reproduce those elements with which it has formed one state of mind."
This law he calls by the name "[[redintegration]]", understood, of course, in a sense different from that in which Hamilton used it. The radical difference between this law and those of Mill and Bain is that it deals not with particular units of thoughts but with universals or identity between individuals. In any example of such reproduction, the universal appears in a particular form which is more or less different from that in which it originally existed.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=786}}

==Psychophysical researches==
[[F. H. Bradley]]'s discussion deals with the subject purely from the metaphysical side, and the total result practically is that association occurs only between universals. From the point of view of empirical psychologists Bradley's results are open to the charge which he made against those who impugned his view of the law of similarity, namely that they are merely a statement - not in any real sense an explanation. The relation between the mental and the physical phenomena of association has occupied the attention of all the leading psychologists (see Psychology). [[William James]] holds that association is of "objects" not of "ideas," is between "things thought of" - so far as the word stands for an effect. "So far as it stands for a cause it is between processes in the brain." Dealing with the law of Contiguity he says that the "most natural way of accounting for it is to conceive it as a result of the laws of habit in the nervous system; in other words to ascribe it to a physiological cause." Association thus results because when a nerve current has once passed by a given way, it will pass more easily by that way in future; and this fact is a physical fact. He further seeks to maintain the important deduction that the only primary or ultimate law of association is that of neural [[Habit (psychology)|habit]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=786}}

The objections to the associationist theory are summed up by [[George Stout|George F. Stout]] (''Analytic Psychol.'', vol. ii. pp.&amp;nbsp;47 seq.) under three heads. Of these the first is that the theory as stated, e.g., by [[Alexander Bain]], lays far too much stress on the mere connexion of elements hitherto entirely separate; whereas, in fact, every new mental state or synthesis consists in the development or modification of a pre-existing state or psychic whole. Secondly, it is quite false to regard an association as merely an aggregate of disparate units; in fact, the form of the new idea is quite as important as the elements which it comprises. Thirdly, the phraseology used by the associationists seems to assume that the parts that go to form the whole retain their identity unimpaired; in fact, each part or element is ipso facto modified by the very fact of its entering into such combination.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=786}}

The experimental methods in vogue in the early part of the 20th century to a large extent removed the discussion of the whole subject of association of ideas, depending in the case of the older writers on introspection, into a new sphere. In such a work as [[Edward B. Titchener]]'s ''Experimental Psychology'' (1905), association was treated as a branch of the study of mental reactions, of which association reactions are one division.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=786}}

Today the field is studied by neuroscientists and artificial intelligence researchers as well as philosophers and psychologists.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5125">A '''Bioeffector'''  is a viable [[microorganism]] or active natural compound which directly or indirectly affects plant performance ([[Biofertilizer]]), and thus has the potential to reduce [[fertilizer]] and [[pesticide]] use in crop production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dpg.phytomedizin.org/fileadmin/tagungen/03_PPPHE/Doku/2014/MinutesPPPHE2014.pdf Minutes of the 6th International Symposium Plant Protection and Plant Health in Europe, May 2014 Braunschweig, Germany]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Bioeffectors have a direct or indirect effect on plant performance by influencing the functional implementation or activation of biological mechanisms, particularly those interfering with soil-plant-microbe interactions.&lt;ref&gt;V. Römheld, G. Neumann (2006): ''The Rhizosphere: Contributions of the soil-root interface to sustainable soil systems''. In: N. Uphoff, N., N. A. S. Ball et al. (Hg.), ''Biological Approaches to Sustainable Soil Systems'', S. 92–107, CRC-Press, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast to conventional fertilizers and pesticides, the effectiveness of bioeffectors is not based on a substantial direct input of mineral plant nutrients, either in inorganic or organic forms.

*Products in use are:
** Microbial residues,
** Composting and fermentation products,
** Plant and algae extracts
*Bioeffector-preparations (''bio-agents'') as ready-formulated products are applied:
** with the purpose of stimulating plant growth (bio-stimulants),
** to improve plant nutrient acquisition (bio-fertilizers),
** to protect plants from [[pathogens]] and [[Pest (organism)|pests]] ([[Biological pest control|bio-control agents]])
** or generally to advance cropping efficiency; they can contain one or more bio-effectors along with other substances”&lt;ref&gt;Bakonyi N., Donath S., Weinmann M., Neumann G., [[Torsten Müller (agroscientist)|Müller T.]], [[Volker Roemheld|Römheld V.]] (2008): Assessing commercial bio-fertilisers for improved phoshorus availability. Use of rapid screening tests. Jahrestagung der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Pflanzenernährung 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
*Well established bioeffectors with documented positive results in the field level are:
** [[Rhizobia]] strains for soil or seed inoculation as a prerequisite for symbiotic N2-fixation when establishing new legume species or varieties.
** positive effects of [[mycorrhiza]] inoculation for soils with a (temporarily) low potential for natural root mycorrhization.
** sufficient mycorrhization enhances nutrient (P) and water uptake and increases resistance to pathogenic fungi.
*Further mechanisms for the positive impact of bioeffectors on plant growth have postulated, promising a high potential for resource preservation due to reduction of fertiliser and pesticide use:
** Active nutrient mobilisation by exudation of acids and carboxylates (e.g. P-mobilisation),
** exudation of micro-nutrient mobilising siderophores/chelates (e.g. Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;),
** reduction of trace elements from less soluble oxidised to highly soluble reduced forms (e.g. Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; to Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;),
** associative/non-symbiotic N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fixation, protective antagonism to plant pathogens,
** enhancement of mycorrhizal infection and growth, and stimulating hormonal effects.

== Research and Public Dissemination ==
Under the Acronym ''Biofector'' the European Union supports the Research of Bioeffectors under the leadership of the [[University of Hohenheim]] (Coordinator [[Guenter Neumann (agricultural scientist)|Guenter Neumann]]).
The results of the project will be evaluated by the members of the [[Association Biostimulants in Agriculture]] (ABISTA) and provided agriculture for use and EU institutions for the legislative and registration procedures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biostimulants.info/ Webpage Biostimulants Association]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other Biostimulants Organisations are [[European Biostimulant Industry Council]], [[International Biocontrol Manufacturers' Association]] and [[Annual Biocontrol Industry Meeting]].

'''Causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving''' is a [[statutory]] offence in [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. It has been abolished in the [[Republic of Ireland]].

==Statute==
This offence is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/35 section 35] of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] (drivers of carriages injuring persons by furious driving):

{{blockquote|"Whosoever, having the charge of any carriage or vehicle, shall by wanton or furious driving or racing, or other wilful misconduct, or by wilful neglect, do or cause to be done any bodily harm to any person whatsoever, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and being convicted thereof shall be liable, at the discretion of the court, to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years ..."}}

This section is printed as amended by section 1(2) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]] and of the [[Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1953]].

This section was repealed for the [[Republic of Ireland]] by [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0025/sec0070.html section 70(a)] of the [[Road Traffic Act 2010]]. In the Republic of Ireland, a person liable to be charged an offence under section 53 of the [[Road Traffic Act, 1961]] was not liable, by reference to the same occurrence, to be charged with an offence under this section.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Road Traffic Act, 1961]], [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1961/en/act/pub/0024/sec0053.html section 53(5)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Misdemeanour"'''

The reference to a [[misdemeanour]] must now be construed as a reference to an offence.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Law Act 1967]], section 12(5)(a); the [[Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Bodily harm"'''

See [[bodily harm]]

In England and Wales, this offence is now used to prosecute:
*drivers of horse-drawn carriages and vehicles
*motorists who cannot be prosecuted for [[dangerous driving]] because they were driving elsewhere than on a road or public place, or because they were not warned that prosecution was intended pursuant to section 1 of the [[Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988]]
*cyclists who cannot be prosecuted for [[dangerous cycling]] because they were cycling elsewhere than on a road, or because they were not warned that prosecution was intended pursuant to section 1 of the [[Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, paragraph 19-248b at page 1626&lt;/ref&gt;

It was used in 2009 to prosecute a death caused by a cyclist collision, which would have fallen outside other laws as it is the closest equivalent to [[dangerous driving]] for cyclists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cyclist jailed for pavement death |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/8197430.stm |date=12 August 2009 |work= BBC News |accessdate=12 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was used again in 2017 for similar reasons&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-41028321&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Mode of trial==

In England and Wales, this is an [[indictable-only offence]].

==Sentence==
In England and Wales, this offence is punishable with imprisonment for any term not exceeding two years,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], section 35; the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]] (11 &amp; 12 Geo.6 c.58), section 1(2)&lt;/ref&gt; as it is in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], section 35; the [[Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1953]], section 1(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attempt==
The offence of [[attempt]]ing to cause bodily harm by wanton driving requires an [[Intention (criminal law)|intent]] to cause bodily harm.&lt;ref&gt;R v Mohan [1976] QB 1, [1975] 2 WLR 859, [1975] 2 All ER 193, 60 Cr App R 272, [1975] RTR 337, [1975] Crim LR 283, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|CA]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Christian]] [[theology]], '''Charity''' ([[Latin]] '''''Caritas''''') is considered as one of the [[Seven virtues|seven virtues]] and is understood by [[Thomas Aquinas]] as "the friendship of man for God", which "unites us to [[God]]". He holds it as "the most excellent of the [[cardinal virtue|virtues]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3023.htm|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: Charity, considered in itself (Secunda Secundae Partis, Q. 23)|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Aquinas holds that "the habit of charity extends not only to the love of God, but also to the love of our neighbor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3025.htm|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The object of charity (Secunda Secundae Partis, Q.25)|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catechism of the Catholic Church defines "charity" as "the [[theological virtue]] by which we love God above all things for His own sake, and our neighbor as ourselves for the love of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#448/z|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|author=|date=|website=usccb.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caritas: the altruistic love==
The phrase ''Deus caritas est'' from {{bibleverse|1|John|4:8|4}}—or ''Θεὸς ἀγάπη ἐστίν'' (Theos agapē estin) in the original Greek&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/interlinear/1_john/4.htm|title=1 John 4  Interlinear Bible|author=|date=|website=biblehub.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is translated in the King James Version as: "God is love", and in the [[Douay-Rheims]] bible as: "God is charity" ({{bibleverse|1|John|4:8|63}}). Thomas Aquinas does not simply equate charity with "[[Love (religious views)#Christian|love]]", which he holds as a passion, not a virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2026.htm|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The passions of the soul in particular: and first, of love (Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 26)|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[King James Version]] uses both the words ''charity'' and ''love'' to translate the idea of ''caritas''/ἀγάπη (agapē): sometimes it uses one, then sometimes the other, for the same concept.  Most other English translations, both before and since, do not; instead, throughout they use the same more direct English word ''love''.  Love can have other meanings in English, but as used in the [[New Testament]] it almost always refers to the virtue of ''caritas''.

Many times when charity is mentioned in English-language bibles, it refers to "love of God", which is a spiritual love that is extended from God to man and then reflected by man, who is made in the image of God, back to God. God gives man the power to act as God acts (God is love), man then reflects God's power in his own human actions towards others. One example of this movement is "charity shall cover the multitude of sins" ({{bibleverse|1|Peter|4:8|KJV}}). "The practice of charity brings us to act toward ourselves and others out of love alone, precisely because each person has the dignity of a beloved child of God."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osv.com/Article/TabId/493/ArtMID/13569/ArticleID/10360/What-is-Virtue.aspx King, Will. "What is Virtue?", ''Our Sunday Visitor'', November 29, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a theological virtue==
[[File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Charity (1878).jpg|thumb|upright|''Charity'' by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]] ]]

Charity is held to be the ultimate perfection of the human spirit, because it is said to both glorify and reflect the nature of God. Confusion can arise from the multiple meanings of the English word "love".  As other theological virtues, Charity is divinely infused into the soul; it resides in the ''will''.&lt;ref name=sollier&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm Sollier, Joseph. "Love (Theological Virtue)." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 21 Aug. 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Aquinas, charity is an absolute requirement for happiness, which he holds as man's last goal.

Charity has two parts: love of God and love of man, which includes both love of one's neighbor and one's self.&lt;ref name=sollier/&gt;

In [[1 Corinthians 13]], [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] places the greater emphasis on Charity (Love). "So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love." He describes it as:

{{quote|Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become ''as'' sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have ''the gift of'' prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed ''the poor'', and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.

Charity never faileth: but whether ''there be'' prophecies, they shall fail; whether ''there be'' tongues, they shall cease; whether ''there be'' knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away....And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these ''is'' charity.}}

The fruits of charity are joy, peace, and mercy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#450/z|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|author=|date=|website=usccb.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] issued the encyclical ''[[Deus caritas est]]'', in which he discussed "... the love which God lavishes upon us and which we in turn must share with others."&lt;ref&gt;[https://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20051225_deus-caritas-est.html Pope Benedict XVI, ''Deus caritas est'', December 25, 2005, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9178">'''Cognitive ergonomics''', defined by the [[International Ergonomics Association]] "is concerned with mental processes, such as perception, memory, reasoning, and motor response, as they affect interactions among humans and other elements of a system. The relevant topics include mental workload, decision-making, skilled performance, [[Human–computer interaction|human-computer interaction]], human reliability, work stress and training as these may relate to human-system design."&lt;ref name="IEA website"&gt;[http://www.iea.cc/whats/index.html What is Ergonomics?] International Ergonomics Association&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive ergonomics studies cognition in work and operational settings, in order to optimize human well-being and system performance.  It is a subset of the larger field of [[human factors and ergonomics]].

== Goals ==
Cognitive ergonomics (sometimes known as [[cognitive engineering]] though this was an earlier field) is an emerging branch of [[Human factors and ergonomics|ergonomics]] which places particular emphasis on the analysis of [[cognitive]] processes required of operators in modern industries and similar milieus.   Examples include diagnosis, workload, situation awareness, [[decision making]], and planning. Cognitive ergonomics aims at enhancing performance of cognitive tasks by means of several interventions, including these:
*user-centered design of human-machine interaction and [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI);
*design of information technology systems that support cognitive tasks (e.g., cognitive artifacts);
*development of training programs;
*work redesign to manage [[cognitive workload]] and increase [[human reliability]].

== History ==
The field of cognitive ergonomics emerged predominantly in the 70's with the advent of the personal computer and new developments in the fields of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[artificial intelligence]]. CE contrasts the tradition of physical ergonomics because "cognitive ergonomics is...the application of [[psychology]] to work...to achieve the optimization between people and their work."&lt;ref name="Long 2000"&gt;{{cite news |title= Cognitive ergonomics - past, present, future: 10 lessons learned (10 lessons remaining) Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society ... Annual Meeting |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/235419773/ |newspaper= human factors and ergonomics society |date= June 6, 2010 |accessdate= November 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewed as an applied science, the methods involved with creating cognitive ergonomic design have changed with the rapid development in technological advances over the last 27 years. In the 80's, there was a worldwide transition in the methodological approach to design. According to van der Veer, [[Enid Mumford]] was one of the pioneers of [[interactive systems engineering]], and advocated the notion of user-centered design, wherein the user is considered and "included in all phases of the design".&lt;ref name="Van der veer 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author=van der veer GC |title= Cognitive Ergonomics in Interface Design – Discussion of a Moving Science |journal= journal of universal computer science |volume=14 |issue=16 |pages=2614–2629 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several different models which describe the criteria for designing user-friendly technology. A number of models focus on a systematic process for design, using [[task analysis]] to evaluate the cognitive processes involved with a given task and develop adequate interface capabilities. Task analysis in past research has focused on the evaluation of cognitive task demands, concerning motor control and cognition during visual tasks such as operating machinery, or the evaluation of [[attention]] and focus via the analysis of eye saccades of pilots when flying.&lt;ref name="Van der veer 2008" /&gt;  [[Neuroergonomics]], a subfield of cognitive ergonomics, aims to enhance [[human-computer interaction]] by using neural correlates to better understand situational task demands. Neuroergonomic research at the university of Iowa has been involved with assessing safe-driving protocol,  enhancing elderly mobility, and analyzing cognitive abilities involved with the navigation of abstract virtual environments."&lt;ref name="IDNU"&gt;[http://www.uiowa.edu/~neuroerg/research.html Division of Neuroergonomics] University of Iowa Division of Neuroscience&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Successful, [[Human factors and ergonomics|ergonomic]] intervention in the area of cognitive tasks requires [[Industrial &amp; Organizational Assessment|a thorough understanding not only of the demands of the work situation]], but also of user strategies in performing cognitive tasks and of limitations in human cognition. In some cases, the artifacts or tools used to carry out a task may impose their own constraints and limitations (e.g., navigating through a large number of GUI screens). Tools may also co-determine the very nature of the task.&lt;ref name="Van der veer 2008" /&gt; In this sense, the analysis of cognitive tasks should examine both the interaction of users with their work setting  and the user interaction with artifacts or tools; the latter is very important as modern artifacts (e.g., control panels, software, expert systems) become increasingly sophisticated. Emphasis lies on how to design human-machine interfaces and cognitive artifacts so that human performance is sustained in work environments where information may be unreliable, events may be difficult to predict, multiple simultaneous goals may be in conflict, and performance may be time constrained.&lt;ref name= "Lee 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Lee JD |title= Emerging challenges in cognitive ergonomics: managing swarms of self-organizing agent-based automation |journal= Theoretical Issues in ergonomic science |volume= 2 |issue= 3 |pages= 238–250 |year= 2001 |doi=10.1080/14639220110104925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|User interface modeling}}

=== Cognitive task analysis ===
{{See also|Task analysis}}
''Cognitive task analysis'' is a general term for the set of methods used to identify the mental demands and cognitive skills needed to complete a task.&lt;ref name="Militello et al. 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hutton RJB, Militello LG |title= applied cognitive task analysis (ACTA): a practitioner’s toolkit for understanding cognitive task demands |journal= Ergonomics |volume= 41|issue= 11 |pages= 1618–1641 |year= 1998 |doi=10.1080/001401398186108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frameworks like [[GOMS]] provide a formal set of methods for identifying the mental activities required by a task and an artifact, such as a desktop computer system. By identifying the sequence of mental activities of a user engaged in a task, cognitive ergonomics engineers can identify bottlenecks and critical paths that may present opportunities for improvement or risks (such as [[human error]]) that merit changes in training or system behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, K. M., Helton, W. S., &amp; Wiggins, M. W. (2013). Cognitive engineering. Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science, 4(1), 17-31.{{DOI|10.1002/wcs.1204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
As a design philosophy, cognitive ergonomics can be applied to any area where humans interact with technology. Applications include aviation (e.g., cockpit layouts),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baxter|first1=Gordon|last2=Besnard|first2=Denis|last3=Riley|first3=Dominic|title=Cognitive mismatches in the cockpit: Will they ever be a thing of the past?|journal=Applied Ergonomics|date=July 2007|volume=38|issue=4|pages=417-423|doi=10.1016/j.apergo.2007.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; transportation (e.g., collision avoidance), the health care system (e.g., drug bottle labelling), mobile devices, appliance interface design, product design, and nuclear power plants.

A '''command missile''' is a [[missile]], the payload of which issues electronic commands. A command missile does not carry any destructive payload. Its payload is designed to be delivered to very high altitude rather than at ground targets. 

A command missile might function as part of a [[mutually assured destruction]] scenario. In the event of a nuclear first strike being detected, the defending nation launches command missiles, which command retaliation from friendly units. Thus, retaliation is assured even if the nation's leadership, military chain of command, and communications infrastructure are destroyed by the first strike.

The United States operated a command missile system known as the Emergency Rocket Communications System (ERCS). In the event of a nuclear first strike against the continental United States, centrally located [[LGM-30 Minuteman]] missiles would be launched, each of which carried a payload that would electronically trigger a nuclear retaliation.

The Soviet Union was also known to operate command missiles.

A '''conscientious objector'''  is an "individual who has claimed the right to refuse to perform [[military service]]"&lt;ref&gt;On July 30, 2001, explicit clarification of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] Article 18 was made in the United Nations [[Human Rights Committee]] general comment 22, Para. 11: {{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomReligion/Pages/IstandardsI3k.aspx|title=Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief.

In some countries, conscientious objectors are assigned to an alternative [[civilian service]] as a substitute for conscription or military service. Some conscientious objectors consider themselves [[pacifism|pacifist]], [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist]], [[nonresistance|non-resistant]], [[non-aggression principle|non-aggressionist]], [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] or [[antimilitarist]].

On March 8, 1995, the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] resolution 1995/83 stated that "persons performing military service should not be excluded from the right to have conscientious objections to military service."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,4565c22523,4565c25f2c9,3b00f0d220,0.html |title=UN Commission on Human Rights, Conscientious objection to military service., 8 March 1995, E/CN.4/RES/1995/83 (See point #2)|author=UN Commission on Human Rights |date=March 8, 1995 |work=|publisher=UN Commission on Human Rights |accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was re-affirmed in 1998, when resolution 1998/77 recognized that "persons [already] performing military service may ''develop'' conscientious objections."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/5bc5759a53f36ab380256671004b643a?Opendocument|title= Conscientious objection to military service; Commission on Human Rights resolution 1998/77; see preamble "Aware..."|author= United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|date=April 22, 1998|work=|publisher= United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=2009-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?page=search&amp;amp;docid=3b00f0be10&amp;amp;skip=0&amp;amp;query=1998/77|title=Conscientious objection to military service; E/CN.4/RES/1998/77; See introductory paragraph|date=April 22, 1998|publisher=UN Commission on Human Rights|accessdate=2009-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/sdpage_e.aspx?b=1&amp;se=10&amp;t=11|title= Conscientious objection to military service, Commission on Human Rights resolution 1998/77, Navigation to document: press "next" four times, see bottom listing, and at the right choose letter for language ("E" for English) Document:  CHR 54th 4/22/1998E/CN.4/RES/1998/77 |year=1998|publisher= United Nations Human Rights, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights| accessdate=2008-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="D.

==History==
Many conscientious objectors have been executed, imprisoned, or otherwise penalized when their beliefs led to actions conflicting with their society's legal system or government. The legal definition and status of conscientious objection has varied over the years and from nation to nation. Religious beliefs were a starting point in many nations for legally granting conscientious objector status.

The first recorded conscientious objector, [[Maximilian of Tebessa|Maximilianus]], was conscripted into the Roman army in the year 295, but "told the Proconsul in Numidia that because of his religious convictions he could not serve in the military." He was executed for this, and was later canonized as Saint Maximilian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/ConscientiousObjection_en.pdf |title=Conscientious objection to military service |author=The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early recognition of conscientious objection was granted by [[William the Silent]] to the Dutch [[Mennonite]]s in 1575. They could refuse military service in exchange for a monetary payment.&lt;ref name="co"&gt;Robert Paul Churchill, "Conscientious Objection", in Donald K. Wells,

Formal legislation to exempt objectors from fighting was first granted in mid-18th century [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] following problems with attempting to force [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] into military service. In 1757, when the first attempt was made to establish a [[Militia (Great Britain)|British Militia]] as a professional national military reserve, a clause in the Militia Ballot Act allowed Quakers exemption from military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quakersintheworld.org/quakers-in-action/171|title=Conscientious Objection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], conscientious objection was permitted from the country's founding, although regulation was left to individual states prior to the introduction of [[conscription]].&lt;ref name="co" /&gt;

==International law==

===Universal Declaration of Human Rights===
In 1948, the issue of the right to "conscience" was dealt with by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. It reads:

{{Quote|Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.}}

The proclamation was [[ratified]] during the General Assembly on 10 December 1948 by a vote of 48 in favour, 0 against, with 8 abstentions.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web |url=http://www.unac.org/rights/question.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912162219/http://www.unac.org/rights/question.html |archivedate=2012-09-12 |df= }} under "Who are the signatories of the Declaration?"&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Muhammad Ali NYWTS.jpg|thumb|"I ain't got no quarrel with them [[Viet Cong]] ... They never called me [[nigger]]."&amp;nbsp;– [[Muhammad Ali]], 1966]]
In 1974, the Assistant [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], [[Sean MacBride]] said, in his Nobel Lecture, "To the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights one more might, with relevance, be added. It is ' [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights#"The Right to Refuse to Kill"|The Right to Refuse to Kill]].'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1974/macbride-lecture.html|title= The Imperatives of Survival|year=1974|publisher=Nobel Foundation|accessdate=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the United Nations [[treaty]] the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] [[coming into force|entered into force]]. It was based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and was originally created in 1966. Nations that have signed this treaty are bound by it. Its Article 18 begins: "Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights |publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights |accessdate=2008-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |archivedate=2008-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights left the issue of conscientious objection inexplicit, as we see in this quote from [[War Resisters International]]: "Article 18 of the Covenant does put some limits on the right [to freedom of thought, conscience and religion], stating that [its] manifestations must not infringe on public safety, order, health or morals. Some states argue that such limitations [on the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion] would [derivatively] permit them to make conscientious objection during time of war a threat to public safety, or mass conscientious objection a disruption to public order,...[Some states] even [argue] that it is a 'moral' duty to serve the state in its military."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wri-irg.org/books/co-guide-un.htm|title=A Conscientious Objector's Guide to the UN Human Rights System|publisher=War Resisters International|accessdate=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 30, 1993, explicit clarification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Article 18 was made in the United Nations [[Human Rights Committee]] general comment 22, Paragraph 11: "The Covenant does not explicitly refer to a right to conscientious objection, but the Committee believes that such a right can be derived from article 18, inasmuch as the obligation to use lethal force may seriously conflict with the freedom of conscience and the right to manifest one's religion or belief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/religion/I3k.htm|title=Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief.

In 1997, an announcement of [[Amnesty International]]'s forthcoming campaign and briefing for the [[UN Commission on Human Rights]] included this quote: "The right to conscientious objection to military service is not a marginal concern outside the mainstream of international human rights protection and promotion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur01/004/1997/en/ |title=Out of /http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR010041997?open&amp;of=ENG-2EU |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the Human Rights Commission reiterated previous statements and added "states should . . . refrain from subjecting conscientious objectors . . . to repeated punishment for failure to perform military service."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3b00f0be10.html|title=Conscientious objection to military service; E/CN.4/RES/1998/77; See Point #5|date=April 22, 1998|publisher=UN Commission on Human Rights|accessdate=2009-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also encouraged states "to consider granting asylum to those conscientious objectors compelled to leave their country of origin because they fear persecution owing to their refusal to perform military service . . . ."&lt;ref name="D.

In 2001, [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] recognised the right to conscientious objection.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]], Article 10, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status===
The Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status (the Handbook) of the Office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;171. Not every conviction, genuine though it may be, will constitute a sufficient reason for claiming [[refugee]] status after [[desertion]] or draft-evasion. It is not enough for a person to be in disagreement with his government regarding the political justification for a particular military action. Where, however, the type of military action, with which an individual does not wish to be associated, is condemned by the [[international community]] as contrary to basic rules of human conduct, punishment for desertion or draft-evasion could, in the light of all other requirements of the definition, in itself be regarded as persecution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/publ/PUBL/3d58e13b4.pdf Source: Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Selective conscientious objection==
[[Air Commodore]] [[Lionel Charlton]], of the British Royal Air Force (RAF), served in the military from 1898 to 1928. In 1923 he ''selectively'' refused to serve in the [[RAF Iraq Command]]. (He later went on to serve as [[Air Officer Commanding]] [[No. 3 Group RAF|No 3 Group]].)&lt;ref&gt;[[Sven Lindqvist]], "A History of Bombing" (''Nu dog du: bombernas århundrade''), 1999, relevant quotation at [http://www.columbia.edu/~lnp3/mydocs/culture/lawrence.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 1967, [[John Courtney Murray]], an American [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] and theologian, delivered an address at [[Western Maryland College]] concerning a more specific type of conscientious objection: "the issue of selective conscientious objection, conscientious objection to particular wars, or as it is sometimes called, discretionary armed service."&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://woodstock.georgetown.edu/library/Murray/1967L.htm|title = Selective Conscientious Objection; Editor Note: An address given at Western Maryland College, June 4, 1967.

On March 8, 1971, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in the case of ''[[Gillette v. United States]]'' that "the exemption for those who oppose "participation in war in any form" applies to those who oppose participating in all war and not to those who object to participation in a particular war only."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=401&amp;invol=437|title=FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|website=Findlaw|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, 2003, in [[Israel]], [[Refusal to serve in the Israeli military#The pilots.27 letter|27 reserve pilots and former pilots refused to serve in only specific missions]].

On May 25, 2005, journalist Jack Random wrote the following: "The case of Sergeant [[Kevin Benderman]] ([[List of Iraq War resisters|Iraq War Resister]]) raises the burning issue of selective conscientious objection: While it is universally accepted that an individual cannot be compelled against conscience to war in general, does the same hold for an individual who objects, in the depths of the soul, to a particular war?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Jack|last= Random|title= Just Say No: The Case for Selective Conscientious Objection|work= |page= |date= May 25, 2005|accessdate= 26 January 2009|quote= |url= http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/5-25-2005-70478.asp}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious motives==
{{main|List of pacifist faiths|Freedom of religion}}
Cases of behavior which could be considered as religiously motivated conscientious objection are historically attested long before the modern term appeared. For example, the Medieval ''[[Orkneyinga Saga]]'' mentions that [[Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney]]&amp;nbsp;– the future Saint Magnus&amp;nbsp;– had a reputation for piety and gentleness, and because of his religious convictions refused to fight in a Viking raid on [[Anglesey]], [[Wales]], instead staying on board his ship singing [[psalm]]s.

The reasons for refusing to perform military service are varied. Many conscientious objectors cite religious reasons. [[Unitarian Universalists]] object to war in their sixth principle "The goal of world community with peace, liberty and justice for all". Members of the [[Peace Churches|Historic Peace Churches]] such as Quakers, Mennonites, [[Amish]], [[Old Order Mennonite]], [[Conservative Mennonites]], the [[Bruderhof Communities]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Bruderhof_Communities|title=Bruderhof Communities - GAMEO|website=gameo.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Church of the Brethren]] object to war from the conviction that [[Christian]] life is incompatible with military action, because [[Jesus]] enjoins his followers to love their enemies and to refuse violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/bruderhof-christians-beliefs-set/2015/05/07/id/643320/|title=5 Beliefs That Set the Bruderhof Apart From Other Christians|work=Newsmax|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the American Civil War, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] have been known as non-combatants, and have done work in hospitals or to give medical care rather than combat roles, and the church has upheld the non-combative position.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sidadventist.org/lead/index.php/resources/essent/89-leadership{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Christadelphians]], refuse to participate in the armed services on the grounds that they believe they should be neutral in worldly conflicts and often cite the latter portion of [http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Isaiah+2:4%E2%80%932:4&amp;version=nrsv Isaiah 2:4] which states, "...neither shall they learn war anymore." Other objections can stem from a deep sense of responsibility toward humanity as a whole, or from simple denial that any government possesses the [[moral authority]] to command warlike behavior from its citizens.

The varied experiences of non-combatants are illustrated by those of Seventh-day Adventists when there was mandatory military service:  "Many Seventh-day Adventists refuse to enter the army as combatants, but participate as medics, ambulance drivers, etc. During World War II in Germany, many SDA conscientious objectors were sent to concentration camps or mental institutions; some were executed. Some Seventh-day Adventists volunteered for the US Army's [[Operation Whitecoat]], participating in research to help others. The Church preferred to call them "conscientious participants", because they were willing to risk their lives as test subjects in potentially life-threatening research. Over 2,200 Seventh-day Adventists volunteered in experiments involving various infectious agents during the 1950s through the 1970s in Fort Detrick, MD. "&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/sda3.htm "The Seventh-day Adventist Church: Controversies, books and other resources"],''religioustolerance.org,''Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] arose during and after World War I between Seventh-day Adventists in Germany who agreed to serve in the military if conscripted and those who rejected all participation in warfare&amp;nbsp;— the latter group eventually forming a separate church (the [[Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdarm.org/origin.htm "Origin of the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815073949/http://www.sdarm.org/origin.htm |date=2010-08-15 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blessed are the Peacemakers.gif|alt=|thumb|''Blessed are the Peacemakers'' (1917) by [[George Bellows]].]]
In the [[early Christian Church]] followers of [[Christ]] refused to take up arms.

{{quote|In as much as they [Jesus' teachings] ruled out as illicit all use of violence and injury against others, clearly implied [was] the illegitimacy of participation in war... The early Christians took Jesus at his word, and understood his inculcations of gentleness and non-resistance in their literal sense. They closely identified their religion with peace; they strongly condemned war for the bloodshed which it involved.|{{cite book|title=The Early Christian Attitude to War}}}}

After the [[Roman Empire]] officially embraced [[Christianity]], the [[Just War]] theology was developed in order to reconcile warfare with Christian belief. After Theodosius I made Christianity an official religion of the Empire, this position slowly developed into the official position of the Western Church. In the 11th century, there was a further shift of opinion in the Latin-Christian tradition with the [[crusade]]s, strengthening the idea and acceptability of [[religious war|Holy War]]. Objectors became a minority. Some theologians see the [[Constantinian shift]] and the loss of  [[Christian pacifism]] as a great failing of the Church.

[[Ben Salmon]] was a Catholic conscientious objector during World War I and outspoken critic of Just War theology. The Catholic Church denounced him and ''The New York Times'' described him as a "spy suspect." The US military (in which he was never inducted) charged him with desertion and spreading propaganda, then sentenced him to death (this was later revised to 25 years hard labor).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Staff of the Catholic Peace Fellowship| year= 2007| title=The Life and Witness of Ben Salmon| journal = Sign of Peace | volume = 6.1| issue = Spring 2007| pages =| id =| url =http://www.catholicpeacefellowship.org/nextpage.asp?m=2524}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 5, 1917, Salmon wrote in a letter to President Wilson:

{{quote|Regardless of nationality, all men are brothers. God is "our Father who art in heaven." The commandment "Thou shalt not kill" is unconditional and inexorable. ... The lowly Nazarene taught us the doctrine of non-resistance, and so convinced was he of the soundness of that doctrine that he sealed his belief with death on the cross. When human law conflicts with Divine law, my duty is clear. Conscience, my infallible guide, impels me to tell you that prison, death, or both, are infinitely preferable to joining any branch of the Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unsung Hero of the Great War: The Life and Witness of Ben Salmon|year=1989|author=Torin Finney|pages= 118 and 119}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Because of their conscientious objection to participation in military service, whether armed or unarmed, Jehovah's Witnesses have often faced imprisonment or other penalties. In [[Greece]], for example, before the introduction of alternative civilian service in 1997, hundreds of Witnesses were imprisoned, some for three years or even more for their refusal. In [[Armenia]], young Jehovah's Witnesses were imprisoned because of their conscientious objection to military service; this was discontinued in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jw.org/en/news/by-region/europe/armenia/armenia-releases-imprisoned-jehovahs-witnesses/ Armenia Releases All Imprisoned Jehovah's Witnesses].&lt;/ref&gt; The government of South Korea also imprisons hundreds for refusing the draft. In [[Switzerland]], virtually every Jehovah's Witness is exempted from military service. The [[Finland|Finnish]] government exempts Jehovah's Witnesses from the draft completely.

For believers in [[Indian religions]], the opposition to warfare may be based on either the general idea of [[ahimsa]], [[nonviolence]], or on an explicit prohibition of violence by their religion, e.g., for a [[Buddhist]], one of the [[five precepts]] is "Pānātipātā veramaṇi sikkhāpadam samādiyāmi," or "I undertake the precept to refrain from destroying living creatures," which is in obvious opposition to the practice of warfare. The [[14th Dalai Lama]] has stated that war "should be relegated to the dustbin of history." On the other hand, many Buddhist sects, especially in Japan, have been thoroughly militarized, warrior monks (''yamabushi'' or ''[[sōhei]]'') participating in the civil wars. Hindu beliefs do not go against the concept of war, as seen in the [[Gita]]. Both Sikhs and Hindus believe war should be a last resort and should be fought to sustain life and morality in society.

[[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] are advised to do social service instead of active army service, but when this is not possible because of obligations in certain countries, the [[Bahá'í laws|Bahá'í law]] of ''loyalty to one's government'' is preferred and the individual should perform the army service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bahai-library.com/mazal_comparison_christianity_bahai&amp;chapter=1 | title = Selected Topics of Comparison in Christianity and the Bahá'í Faith | accessdate = 13 September 2006 | first = Peter |last = Mazal | date = 21 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ud1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/UD/ud-136.html | first = Shoghi | last = Effendi |authorlink = Shoghi Effendi|title = Unfolding Destiny|pages = 134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some practitioners of [[paganism|pagan religions]], particularly [[Wicca]], may object on the grounds of the [[Wiccan rede]], which states "An it harm none, do what ye will" (or variations). The [[threefold law]] may also be grounds for objection.

A notable example of a conscientious objector was the [[Austrians|Austrian]] devout [[Roman Catholic]] Christian [[Franz Jägerstätter]], who was executed on August 9, 1943 for openly refusing to serve in the Nazi [[Wehrmacht]], consciously accepting the penalty of death. He was [[Beatification|declared Blessed]] by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2007 for dying for his beliefs, and is viewed as a symbol of self-sacrificing resistance.

==Alternatives for objectors==
Some conscientious objectors are unwilling to serve the military in any capacity, while others accept noncombatant roles. While conscientious objection is usually the refusal to collaborate with military organizations, as a combatant in war or in any supportive role, some advocate compromising forms of conscientious objection. One compromising form is to accept [[non-combatant]] roles during conscription or [[military service]]. Alternatives to military or civilian service include serving an imprisonment or other punishment for refusing conscription, falsely claiming unfitness for duty by feigning an allergy or a heart condition, delaying conscription until the maximum drafting age, or seeking refuge in a country which does not extradite those wanted for military conscription. Avoiding military service is sometimes labeled [[draft dodger|draft dodging]], particularly if the goal is accomplished through dishonesty or evasive maneuvers. However, many people who support conscription will distinguish between "[[bona fide]]" ''conscientious objection'' and ''draft dodging'', which they view as evasion of military service without a valid excuse.

Conservative Mennonites do not object to serving their country in peaceful alternatives ([[alternative service]]) such as hospital work, farming, forestry, road construction and similar occupations. Their objection is in being part in any military capacity whether noncombatant or regular service. During World War II and the Korean, Vietnam war eras they served in many such capacities in alternative I-W service programs initially through the Mennonite Central Committee and now through their own alternatives.

Despite the fact that international institutions such as the United Nations (UN) and the [[Council of Europe]] (CoE) regard and promote conscientious objection as a human right,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.law.nyu.edu/journals/jilp/issues/33/pdf/33n.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122030613/http://www1.law.nyu.edu/journals/jilp/issues/33/pdf/33n.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 November 2011 |title=THE STATUS OF CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION UNDER ARTICLE 4 OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS, 33 N.Y.U.

Among the roughly one-hundred countries that have conscription, only thirty countries have some legal provisions, 25 of them in Europe. In Europe, most countries with conscription more or less fulfill international guidelines on conscientious objection legislation (except for [[Conscription in Greece|Greece]], [[Conscription in Cyprus|Cyprus]], [[Conscription in Turkey|Turkey]], [[Conscription in Finland|Finland]] and [[Conscription in Russia|Russia]]) today. In many countries outside Europe, especially in armed conflict areas (e.g. [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]), conscientious objection is punished severely.

While conscientious objectors used to be seen as deserters, traitors, cowards, slackers or simply un-patriotic, their image has changed drastically in the Western world in past decades.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Especially in Europe, where objectors usually serve an alternative civilian service, they are regarded as making an equally important contribution to society as conscripts.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Parallel to that, the number of objectors has risen significantly, too:{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} e.g., in [[Germany]], where conscientious objection is a constitutional right, from less than one percent of all eligible men to more than fifty percent in 2003.  In 1991, The Peace Abbey established the National Registry for Conscientious Objection where people can publicly state their refusal to participate in armed conflict.

==Conscientious objection around the world==

===Belgium===
Conscription was mandatory to all able-bodied [[Belgium|Belgian]] males until 1994, when it was suspended. Civilian service was possible since 1963. Objectors could apply for the status of conscience objector. When granted, they did an alternative service with the civil service or with a socio-cultural organisation. The former would last 1.5 times as long as the shortest military service, the latter twice as long.

After their service, objectors are not allowed to take jobs that require them to carry weapons, such as police jobs, until the age of 42.

Since conscription was suspended in 1994 and military service is voluntary, the status of conscience objector can not be granted anymore in Belgium.

===Canada===
{{see also|Canada and Iraq War resisters|War Resisters Support Campaign}}

Mennonites and other similar peace churches in Canada were automatically exempt from any type of service during [[Military history of Canada during World War I|Canada's involvement in World War I]] by provisions of the [[Order in Council]] of 1873 yet initially, many were imprisoned until the matter was again resettled. With pressure of public opinion, the Canadian government barred entry of additional [[Mennonite]] and [[Hutterite]] immigrants, rescinding the privileges of the Order in Council.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 321. The [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]] also barred immigrants and objectors from voting.

This bar on entry was overturned in the 1920s, allowing immigrants to escape Soviet repression.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Military history of Canada during the Second World War|Canada's involvement in World War II]], Canadian conscientious objectors were given the options of noncombatant military service, serving in the medical or dental corps under military control or working in parks and on roads under civilian supervision. Over 95% chose the latter and were placed in Alternative Service camps.&lt;ref&gt;Gingerich p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Peter Dueck |author2=Conrad Stoesz |author3=Grant Klassen |author4=Lynette Wiebe |author5=Elsie Rempel |author6=Lawrence Klippenstein |author7=Alf Redekopp |author8=Dan Dyck |author9=John C.

After May 1943, as the labour shortage developed within the nation and another [[Conscription Crisis of 1944|Conscription Crisis]] burgeoned, men were shifted into agriculture, education and industry. The 10,700 Canadian objectors were mostly Mennonites (63%) and [[Doukhobor|Dukhobors]] (20%).&lt;ref&gt;Krahn, pp. 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colombia===
Conscientious objection is not recognised in Colombia, which has occasionally resulted of the detention and forced recruitment of those who refuse the draft. This is despite the fact that the Colombia constitutional court has ruled that conscientious objection is protected by the constitution in 2012. [https://www.wri-irg.org/en/programmes/world_survey/country_report/en/Colombia War Resisters' International's report on conscientious objection in Colombia] Before being ruled unconstitutional by the court as illegal in Sentence T-455/14, people were at risk of ''batidas'' - raids in the street and public spaces - where young people were rounded up and forcibly recruited if they could not prove they had already undergone military service.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Czechoslovakia===
In [[Czechoslovakia]], those not willing to enter mandatory military service could avoid it by signing a contract for work lasting years in unattractive occupations, such as mining. Those who didn't sign were imprisoned. Both numbers were tiny. After the [[Velvet Revolution|communist party lost its power]] in 1989, alternative civil service was established. As of 2006, both the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] have abolished conscription.

===Denmark===
Any male getting drafted, but unwilling to serve, has the ability to avoid military service by instead serving community service for the duration of the conscription.

===Eritrea===
There is no right to conscientious objection to military service in Eritrea - which is of an indefinite length - and those who refuse the draft are imprisoned. Some Jehovah's Witness conscientious objectors have been in jail since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wri-irg.org/en/programmes/world_survey/reports/Eritrea&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
{{See also|Siviilipalvelus}}
Finland introduced conscription in 1881, but its enforcement was suspended in 1903 as part of [[Russification]]. During the [[Finnish Civil War]] in 1918, conscription was reintroduced for all able-bodied men. In 1922, the option of noncombatant military service was introduced, but service in the military remained compulsory on pain of imprisonment. After the struggle of pacifist [[Arndt Pekurinen]] a law was passed providing for a peacetime-only alternative to military service, or civilian service (Finnish ''siviilipalvelus''). The law was dubbed "Lex Pekurinen" after him. During the [[Winter War]], Pekurinen and other conscientious objectors were imprisoned, and Pekurinen was eventually executed at the front in 1941, during the [[Continuation War]].

After the war, a conscientious objector's civilian service lasted 16 months, whereas military service was 8 months at its shortest. To qualify for civilian service, an objector had to explain his conviction before a board of inspection that included military officers and clergymen. In 1987, the duration of the service was shortened to 13 months and the board of inspection was abolished. In 2008, the term was further shortened to 12 months to match the duration of the longest military service (that of officer trainees and technical crew). Today, a person subject to conscription may apply for civilian service at any time before or during his military service, and the application is accepted as a matter of course. A female performing voluntary military service can quit her service anytime during the first 45 days, however, if she wants to quit after those 45 days she would be treated like a male and assigned to civilian service.

Persons who have completed their civilian service during peacetime have, according to the legislation enacted in 2008, the right to serve in non-military duties also during a crisis situation. They may be called to serve in various duties with the rescue services or other necessary work of a non-military nature. Persons who declare themselves to be conscientious objectors only after a crisis has started must, however, prove their conviction before a special board. Before the new legislation, the right to conscientious objection was acknowledged only in peacetime. The changes to the service term and to the legal status of objectors during a crisis situation were made as a response to human rights concerns voiced by several international bodies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aseistakieltaytyjaliitto.fi/ihmisoikeuselimet.html|title=Suomi syrjii aseistakieltäytyjiä! - AKL|website=aseistakieltaytyjaliitto.fi|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/CCPR.CO.82.FIN.En?Opendocument|title=unhchr.ch|website=unhchr.ch|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are overseeing the implementation of human rights agreements. These organisations had demanded Finland to take measures to improve its legislation concerning conscientious objectors, which they considered discriminatory. None of these organisations have yet raised concerns on the current legislation.

There are a small number of total objectors who refuse even civilian service, and are imprisoned for six months. This is not registered into the person's criminal record.
&lt;!---Text from [[Conscientious objection throughout the world]] - needs merging into existing text -
For many decades, the civilian service remained unpopular and difficult to choose. Refusing military service would have been very strongly discouraged by all state officials, and getting accepted as a conscientious objector required a trial by an examination board, whose judgement was often very harsh and strongly biased towards military service. These boards included army officers and clergy. A typical hypothetical presented to the examinee was "If a group of men threatened to beat your girlfriend up, would you try to stop them?".

The examinations were abolished in the 1980s, and today a conscientious objector is only required to check a box in the draft form and state whether his reasons are religious or ethical. Severe social stigma attachs to conscientious objection, and the military, which is responsible for the draft, does not advertise the option beyond their legal obligation to mention the option to draftees.

The civilian service of conscientious objectors lasts 395 days, over twice as long as the shortest and most common military service (180 days) and thirty days longer than the longest and mostly voluntary service (365 days).

The first four weeks of the civilian service are spent in training, which mostly consists of general-purpose lectures on various topics. The first three weeks of the training are held at the [[Lapinjärvi Educational Center]], and the fourth week is a free vacation.

In Finland today, the right to conscientious objection is still acknowledged only in peacetime. In recent years several international bodies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aseistakieltaytyjaliitto.fi/ihmisoikeuselimet.html|title=Suomi syrjii aseistakieltäytyjiä! - AKL|website=aseistakieltaytyjaliitto.fi|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for example UN's Human Rights Committee&lt;ref name="unhchr.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/CCPR.CO.82.FIN.En?Opendocument|title=unhchr.ch|website=unhchr.ch|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), who are overseeing the implementation of human rights agreements, have demanded Finland to take measures to improve its legislation concerning COs, since they have found it to be discriminatory. Sources of criticism have been the punitive length of the civilian alternative to military service, the release of conscientious objectors from military duty only during peace time and the negligence in arranging accommodation for the servicemen{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}. Since 1999, [[Amnesty International]]&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur20/001/1999/en/&lt;/ref&gt; has considered Finnish ''total objectors'', who have refused to carry out non-military service, as prisoners of conscience, because of the punitive length of civilian service.

The main 12-month period of service can be performed in any institution that is both non-profit and beneficial to the society. Examples include state bureaus, schools, universities, hospitals, libraries, theatres and independent non-profit organisations such as [[Amnesty International]]. Institutions wishing to accept conscientious objectors must comply with rules laid down by the Finnish Ministry of Labour.

From the state's point of view, conscientious objectors are subject to the same rights and obligations as military enlisted men. How the service is handled in practice depends on the place of service, but a typical service consists of a common 40-hour week in the institution.

Some 2,500 men opt for the civilian service every year, which is ca. 10% of the men drafted.

Men who refuse both the military and the civilian services are known as total objectors (Finnish ''totaalikieltäytyjä''). Total objectors are sentenced unconditionally to a prison term equal to half their remaining service. In 2002, some 80 men were convicted as total objectors. It is usual for total objectors to cite in their defence the Finnish Constitution, several international human rights bodies (for example UN's Human Rights Committee&lt;ref name="unhchr.ch"/&gt;), and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which bans forced labour except in emergencies and wartime, as well as the arguably discriminatory and unconstitutional exemption from military service granted to women, men living in demilitarised Åland and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].

Since 1999, [[Amnesty International]]&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt; have considered the excessive length, as compared to military service, of the civilian service to be punitive and accordingly classifies Finnish total objectors as [prisoners of conscience]. In one recent case (namely ''Case-Hermaja''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hermaja.org/&lt;/ref&gt;), a total objector Jussi Hermaja has sought asylum from another country, Belgium. While asylum was eventually not granted, he was not extradited because the state of Finland never filed a formal request.

Since some 80% of Finnish men undergo military service and since military training and rank are considered merits at the job market, conscientious objectors experience discrimination. A reserve officer's or NCO's rank is considered a more significant merit for management positions than university degrees or work experience (see [[management by perkele]]). However, in most cases employers legally have no defensible reason to favour or even ask about a candidate's military training.---&gt;

===France===
[[File:Objecteurs.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Stamp created by the ''Centre de défense des objecteurs de conscience'' (around 1936).]]
The creation of a legal status for conscientious objectors in France was the subject of a long struggle involving for instance or the much-publicised trials of Protestant activists [[Jacques Martin (pacifist)|Jacques Martin]], Philippe Vernier and Camille Rombault in 1932–1933&lt;ref name = JPC&gt;Jean-Paul Cahn, Françoise Knopper, Anne-Marie Saint-Gille, De la Guerre juste à la paix juste: Aspects confessionnels de la construction de la paix dans l'espace franco-allemand (XVIe-XXe siècle), Collection Histoire et civilisations, Presses Universitaires Septentrion, 2008, 313 pages, {{ISBN|9782757400388}}, p.168&lt;/ref&gt; or the hunger strike of [[anarchist]] [[Louis Lecoin]] in 1962.

The legal status law was passed in December 1963, 43 years (and many prison sentences) after the first requests.

In 1983, a new law passed by socialist Interior Minister [[Pierre Joxe]] considerably improved this status, simplifying the conditions under which the status would be granted. Conscientious objectors were then free to choose an activity in the social realm where they would spend their civil service time. However, in order to avoid too many applications for civil service at the expense of the military, the duration of the civil service is however kept twice as long as the military service.

The effect of these laws was suspended in 2001 when compulsory military service was abolished in France. The special prison at Strasbourg for Jehovah's Witnesses, who refuse to join any military, was also abolished.

Since 1986, the associations defending conscientious objection in France have chosen to celebrate their cause on 15 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wri-irg.org/fr/node/1394|title=15 mai – Journée internationale de l'objection de conscience - Internationale des Résistant(e)s à la Guerre|website=wri-irg.org|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
{{Main|Conscientious objection in East Germany|Conscription in Germany}}
Under the Nazis, conscientious objection was not recognized in the law. In theory, objectors would be drafted and then court-martialled for desertion. The practice was even harsher: going beyond the letter of an already extremely flexible law, conscientious objection was considered [[Wehrkraftzersetzung|subversion of military strength]], a crime normally punished with death. On September 15, 1939 August Dickmann, a Jehovah's Witness, and the first conscientious objector of the war to be executed, died by a firing squad at the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]].&lt;ref&gt;September 17, 1939 ''The New York Times'' See also:  ''A Teacher's Guide to the Holocaust'' by Florida Center for Instructional Technology [http://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/people/JWTIMELN.HTM]&lt;/ref&gt; Among others, [[Franz Jägerstätter]] was executed after his conscientious objection, on the grounds that he could not fight in the forces of the evil side. He is now somewhat the patron saint of conscientious objectors.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

After World War II, there was no official right to conscientious objection in the [[German Democratic Republic]]. Nevertheless, and uniquely among the Eastern bloc, objections were accepted and the objectors assigned to construction units. They were however part of the military, so that a fully civilian alternative did not exist. Also, "[[w:de:Bausoldat|construction soldiers]]" were discriminated against in their later professional life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernd Eisenfeld]]: Das Verhältnis der Partei- und Staatsführung der DDR zu den Bausoldaten a) die agitatorische Diskriminierung der Bausoldaten b) die substantielle Diskriminierung der Bausoldaten. pp. 115–125. in: Kriegsdienstverweigerung in der DDR&amp;nbsp;– ein Friedensdienst?

''In German''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[    * Sergej Kaledin: Das Baubataillon.Übersetzung der russischen Originalausgabe "Strojbat" (1991). Verlag Volk &amp; Welt. Berlin 1992. {{ISBN|3-353-00927-2}}. ''In German''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Article 4(3) of the German constitution ([[Grundgesetz]]): "No person may be forced against their conscience to perform armed military service. Details shall be regulated by a federal law."

According to Article 12a, a law may be passed to require every male from the age of 18 to military service called ''Wehrdienst''; also, a law can require conscientious objectors to perform non-military service instead called ''Wehrersatzdienst'', literally "military replacement service", or colloquially ''Zivildienst''. These laws were applicable and demanded compulsory service in the German [[Bundeswehr]] until the abolition of draft in 2011. Initially, conscientious objectors each had to appear in person to a panel hearing at the draft office (or contest a negative decision at the [[administrative court]]). The suspension of the procedure (1977), allowing to "object with a post card", was ruled unconstitutional in 1978. Beginning in 1983, competence was shifted to the ''Kreiswehrersatzamt'' (military replacement office), which had discretion to either approve or reject a conscientious objection, which had to consist of a detailed written statement by an applicant giving reasons as to why the applicant was conscientiously objecting. This was generally just a formality, and objections were not often rejected. In later years in particular however, with the rise of the Internet, conscientious objections fell into disrepute because of the ease of being able to simply download existing example objections. It earned some conscientious objections the suspicion of an applicant simply attempting an easy way out of military service. On the other hand, certain organizations within the German peace movement had been offering pamphlets for decades giving suggestions to applicants as to the proper wording and structure of an objection which would have the greatest chances of success.

Following a 1985 Federal Constitution Court decision, Wehrersatzdienst could be no simple choice of convenience for an applicant, but he had to cite veritable conflict of conscience which made him unable to perform any kind of military service at all. If there was doubt about the true nature of an objector's application, he could be summoned to appear before a panel at the Kreiswehrersatzamt to explain his reasons in person. An approved conscientious objection in any case then meant that an applicant was required by law to perform Wehrersatzdienst. Complete objection both to military and replacement service was known as ''Totalverweigerung''; it was illegal and could be punished with a fine or a suspended custodial sentence.

Nearly the only legal way to get both out of military service and replacement service was to be deemed physically unfit for military service. Both men who entered military service and those who wanted to go into replacement service had to pass a military physical examination at the military replacement office. Five categories/levels of physical fitness, or ''Tauglichkeitsstufen'', existed. ''Tauglichkeitsstufe 5'', in short ''T5'', meant that a person was rejected for military service and thus also did not need to enter replacement service. ''T5'' status was usually only granted if a person had physical or mental disabilities or was otherwise significantly impaired, such as due to very poor eyesight or debilitating chronic illnesses.

Another way to get out of service completely was the ''two brothers rule'', which stated that if two older brothers had already served in the military, any following male children of a family were exempt from service.

Due to [[West Berlin]]'s special status between the end of the Second World War and 1990 as a city governed by foreign military powers, draft did not apply within its borders. This made Berlin a safe haven for many young people who chose to move to the city to prevent criminal court repercussions for ''Totalverweigerung''. As ''Totalverweigerer'' were often part of the far-left political spectrum, this was one factor which spawned a politically active left-wing and left-wing radical scene in the city.

Wehrersatzdienst was for a long time considerably longer than military service, by up to a third, even when the duration of service was gradually reduced following reunification and the end of the Cold War. This was held by some as a violation of constitutional principles, but was upheld in several court decisions based on the reasoning that former service personnel could be redrafted for military exercises called ''Wehrübungen'', while somebody who had served out his replacement service could not. Moreover, work conditions under military service typically involved more hardship and inconvenience than Wehrersatzdienst. In 2004, military service and Wehrersatzdienst were then made to last equal lengths of time.

Military service and draft were controversial during much of their existence. Reasons included the consideration that Germans could be made to fight against their fellow Germans in East Germany. Moreover, draft only applied to men, which was seen as gender based discrimination by some, but was often countered by the argument that women usually gave up their careers either temporarily or permanently to raise their children. With the end of the Cold War and the German military's primary purpose of defending its home territory increasingly looking doubtful, draft also began to become more arbitrary, as only certain portions of a particular birth year were drafted (usually those in very healthy physcial condition), while others weren't. This was seen as a problem of ''Wehrgerechtigkeit'', or equal justice of military service.

Then-German President [[Roman Herzog]] said in a 1994 speech (which was frequently cited as an argument for draft abolition) that only the necessity for national defense, not any other arguments can justify draft. On the other hand, this logic tended to not be extended to men serving Wehrersatzdienst, as they usually worked in fields of public health, [[elderly care]], medical assistance or assistance for the disabled. Their relatively low-paid work was seen as an ever more important backbone of a health sector which was grappling with rapidly increasing costs of care.

Draft was finally abolished in Germany in 2011, mainly due to a perceived lack of aforementioned necessity. The German Bundeswehr now solely relies on service members who deliberately choose it as a career path. Neither Article 12a (establishing the possibility of draft) nor Article 4 (3) (permitting conscientious objection) have been removed from the German Constitution. In theory, this makes a full reversion to draft (and Wehrersatzdienst) possible if it is thought to be necessary.

===Israel===
{{main|Refusal to serve in the IDF}}
All Israeli citizens and permanent residents are liable to military service. However, the Ministry of Defense has used its discretion under article 36 of this law to automatically exempt all non-Jewish women and all Arab men, except for the Druze, from military service ever since Israel was established. Israeli Arabs may volunteer to perform military service, but very few do so (except among the Bedouin population of Israel).&lt;ref name="wri-irg.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wri-irg.org/co/co-isr-03.htm|title=Conscientious objection to military service in Israel: an unrecognised human right - War Resisters' International|website=wri-irg.org|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing the status of the armed forces shortly after the founding of the State of Israel, representatives of orthodox religious parties argued that yeshiva students should be exempt from military service. This derives from the Jewish tradition that if a man wants to dedicate his life to religious study, society must allow him to do so. The request of orthodox political parties to 'prevent neglect of studying the Torah' was granted by the authorities. But in recent years this exemption practice has become the subject of debate in Israeli society, as the absolute and the relative numbers of the men who received this exemption rose sharply.&lt;ref&gt;From the [[Torato Omanuto]] entry: "from 800 men in 1968 to 41,450 in 2005 compared to 7 million for the entire population of Israel. In percentage terms, 2.4% of the soldiers enlisting to the army in 1974 were benefiting from Torato Omanuto compared to 9.2% in 1999, when it was projected that the number would reach 15% by the year 2012."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled in the case of ''Ressler et al. v. The Knesset et al.''.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files/07/980/062/n18/07062980.n18.htm|title=בבית המשפט העליון בשבתו כבית משפט גבוה לצדק|date=February 21, 2012|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the blanket exemption granted to ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students was ''ultra vires'' the authority of the Minister of Defence, and that it violated Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty and was, therefore, unconstitutional.

As for conscientious objection, in 2002, in the case of ''David Zonschein et al. v. Military Advocate General et al.'',&lt;ref name="test"/&gt; the Supreme Court reiterated its position that selective conscientious objection was not permitted, adding that conscientious objection could only be recognized in cases of general objection to military service.

Women can claim exemption from military service on grounds of conscience under arts. 39 (c) and 40 of the Defense Service Law, according to which religious reasons can be grounds for exemption.&lt;ref name="wri-irg.org"/&gt;

===Italy===
Until 2004 conscription was mandatory to all able-bodied [[Italy|Italian]] males. Those who were born in the last months of the year typically used to serve in the Navy, unless judged unable for ship service (in this case they could be sent back to Army or Air Force). Until 1972, objectors were considered as [[Treason|traitors]] and tried by a military tribunal; after 1972, objectors could choose an alternative civilian service, which was eight months longer than standard military service (fifteen months, then twelve, as for Army and Air Force, 24 months, then eighteen, then twelve as for the Navy){{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}. Since such length was judged too punitive, an arrangement was made to make the civilian service as long as the military service. Since 2004, Italian males no longer need to object because military service has been turned into volunteer for both males and females.

===Marshall Islands===
In the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]] no person can be conscripted if, after being afforded a reasonable opportunity to do so, he has established that he is a conscientious objector to participation in war (Marshall Islands Constitution Article II Section 11).

===Romania===
In [[Romania]], as of 23 October 2006 conscription was suspended, therefore, the status of conscience objector does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/view.php?StoryID=20061023-023126-3463r Romania drops compulsory military service], United Press International, 23 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This came about due to a [[Constitution of Romania|2003 constitutional amendment]] which allowed the parliament to make military service optional. The [[Romanian Parliament]] voted to abolish conscription in October 2005, with the vote formalizing one of many military modernization and reform programs that Romania agreed to when it joined [[NATO]].

===Russia===
{{Main|Conscription in Russia}}
The [[Russian Empire]] allowed [[Russian Mennonite]]s to run and maintain [[Forestry service (Russia)|forestry service]] units in South Russia in lieu of their military obligation. The program was under church control from 1881 through 1918, reaching a peak of seven thousand conscientious objectors during World War I. An additional five thousand Mennonites formed complete hospital units and transport wounded from the battlefield to [[Moscow]] and [[Ekaterinoslav]] hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], [[Leon Trotsky]] issued a decree allowing alternative service for religious objectors whose sincerity was determined upon examination.&lt;ref&gt;The decree was issued in October 1918. Smith, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladimir Chertkov]], a follower of [[Leo Tolstoy]], chaired the ''United Council of Religious Fellowships and Groups'', which successfully freed 8000 conscientious objectors from military service during the [[Russian Civil War]]. The law was not applied uniformly and hundreds of objectors were imprisoned and over 200 were executed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}The United Council was forced to cease activity in December 1920, but alternative service was available under the [[New Economic Policy]] until it was abolished in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = Braun, Abraham, Th.

In the present day,{{when|date=July 2015}} Russian draft legislation allows people to choose an alternative civilian service for religious or ideological reasons. Most objectors are employed in healthcare, construction, forestry and post industries, serving 18 to 21 months.

===South Africa===
{{Main|South African resistance to war|End Conscription Campaign}}

During the 1980s, hundreds&lt;ref&gt;The National Registry of Conscientious Objectors launched in 1989, listed some 700 plus objectors for that year alone. Source: Argus, Thursday, September 21, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; of South African white males dodged the draft, refused the call-up or objected to conscription in the [[South African Defence Force]]. Some simply deserted, or joined organisations such as the [[End Conscription Campaign]], an anti-war movement banned in 1988, while others fled into exile and joined the [[Committee on South African War Resistance]]. Most lived in a state of internal exile, forced to go underground within the borders of the country until a moratorium on conscription was declared in 1993. [[South African Border War|Opposition to the Angolan War]], "South Africa's Vietnam," was rife in English-speaking campuses, and later the war in the townships became the focus of these groupings.

===South Korea===
The terminology conscientious objector technically has not existed in Korean dictionary until recently. In fact, significant majority of Korean citizens simply associate conscientious objectors with draft dodging, and are unaware of the fact that conscientious objector draftees in other westernized countries are required to serve in alternative services. Since the establishment of the [[Republic of Korea]], thousands of conscientious objectors had no choice but to be imprisoned as criminals. Every year about 500 young men, mostly Jehovah's Witnesses,&lt;ref name="jw-media"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jw-media.org/kor/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525232027/http://www.jw-media.org/kor/index.htm |archivedate=2012-05-25 |df= }} Imprisonment of conscientious objectors to military service]&lt;/ref&gt; are arrested for refusing the draft.&lt;ref name="nojail"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-korea-objectors-idUSSEO29904620080902|title=South Korea military objectors say don't jail pacifists|date=2 September 2008|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2017|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Korea's stance has drawn criticism from The U.N. Human Rights Committee, which argues that South Korea is violating article 18 of the ICCPR, which guarantees freedom of thought and conscience. In 2006, 2010, and again in 2011 the U.N. Human Rights Committee, after reviewing petitions from South Korean conscientious objectors, declared that the government was violating Article 18 of the ICCPR, the provision that guarantees the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.&lt;ref name="koreaherald.heraldm.com"&gt;http://koreaherald.heraldm.com/common/redirect.jsp?news_id=20110919000963&amp;category_id=020604000000&lt;/ref&gt;

The government's National Action Plan [https://web.archive.org/web/20120402150820/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/plan_actions/docs/Korea_Summary_NHRAP.doc (NAP)] for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights has not shown a clear stance on the pressing human rights issues such as, among other things, the rights of conscientious objectors to military service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.peoplepower21.org/English/20784 Second Session of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726144917/http://blog.peoplepower21.org/English/20784 |date=2008-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007 the government announced a program to give conscientious objectors an opportunity to participate in alternative civilian service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2007/09/205_10373.html Conscientious Objectors to Get Non-Armed Services for 36 Months]&lt;/ref&gt; The program stipulates three years of civilian service that is not connected with the military in any way. However, that program has been postponed indefinitely after the succeeding administration took office in 2008.&lt;ref name="koreaherald.heraldm.com"/&gt;

The government argues that introducing an alternative service would jeopardize national security and undermine social equality and cohesion. This is amid an increasing number of countries which retain compulsory service have introduced alternatives. In addition, some countries, including those with national security concerns have shown that alternative service can be successfully implemented.&lt;ref name="koreaherald.heraldm.com"/&gt;

On January 15, 2009, the Korean Presidential Commission on Suspicious Deaths in the Military released its decision acknowledging that the government was responsible for the deaths of five young men, who were Jehovah's Witnesses and had forcibly been conscripted into the army.
The deaths resulted from "the state's anti-human rights violence" and "its acts of brutality" during the 1970s that continued into the mid-1980s. This decision is significant since it is the first one recognizing the state's responsibility for deaths resulting from violence within the military.&lt;ref name="deaths"&gt;[http://www.jw-media.org/kor/20090126.htm Korean government held responsible for deaths of five conscientious objectors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111130234/http://www.jw-media.org/kor/20090126.htm |date=2010-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/NEWKHSITE/data/html_dir/2009/01/17/200901170008.aspAbuseblamed|title=The Korea Herald|first=The Korea|last=Herald|website=koreaherald.co.kr|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the Commission's decision, "the beatings and acts of brutality committed against them by military officials were attempts to compel and coerce them to act against their conscience (religion) and were unconstitutional, anti-human rights acts that infringed severely upon the freedom of conscience (religion) guaranteed in the Constitution."&lt;ref name="deaths"/&gt;

The records of conscientious objectors to military service are kept by a governmental investigative body as criminal files for five years. As a consequence, conscientious objectors are not allowed to enter a government office and apply for any type of national certification exam. It is also very unlikely that they will be employed by any company that inquires about criminal records.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jw-media.org/kor/20081231rpt.htm Restrictions on Religious Freedom] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218010933/http://jw-media.org/kor/20081231rpt.htm |date=2010-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2000 to 2008, Korean Military Manpower Administration said that at least 4,958 men have objected to service in the military because of religious beliefs. Among those, 4,925 were Jehovah's Witnesses, 3 were Buddhists, and the other 30 refused the mandatory service because of conscientious objections other than religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/01/117_37552.htmlConscientious|title=Objectors Top 5,000|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 1950, there have been more than 16,000 Jehovah's Witnesses sentenced to a combined total of 31,256 years for refusing to perform military service. If alternative service is not provided, some 500 to 900 young men will continue to be added each year to the list of conscientious objectors criminalized in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jw-media.org/kor/20110902.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007145556/http://jw-media.org/kor/20110902.htm |archivedate=2011-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Lee Yeda was the first conscientious objector to be allowed to live in France via asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2015/05/a-korean-conscientious-objector-in-paris/|title=A Korean Conscientious Objector in Paris|first=Yena Lee, The|last=Diplomat|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/news-item/south-korea-authorities-wrecking-lives-by-jailing-conscientious-objectors|title=News &amp; Stories – Amnesty International USA|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, the Constitutional Court ruled 6-3 that Article 5 of the country's Military Service Act is unconstitutional because it fails to provide an alternative civilian national service for conscientious objectors. {{as of|2018}}, 19,300 South Korean conscientious objectors had gone to prison since 1953. The Defense Ministry said it would honor the ruling by introducing alternative services as soon as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/world/asia/south-korea-military-service-conscientious-objectors.html |title=South Korea Must Offer Civilian Alternatives to Military Service, Court Rules |last=Sang-Hun |first=Chloe |date=June 28, 2018 |website=The New York Times |access-date=June 29, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
Conscientious objection was not permitted in [[Francoist Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Brock (historian)|Peter Brock]] and Nigel Young,
''Pacifism in the Twentieth Century''. Syracuse University Press, New York, 1999 {{ISBN|0-8156-8125-9}} 
(pp. 96–7, 311).&lt;/ref&gt; Conscientious objectors usually refused to serve on religious grounds, such as being Jehovah's Witnesses, and were placed in prison for the duration of their sentences. The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] acknowledged conscientious objectors.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Spanish Constitution of 1978/Part I#Division 2. Rights and Duties of Citizens|Spanish Constitution section 30.2]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish parliament established a longer service (''Prestación Social Sustitutoria'') as an alternative to the Army. In spite of this, a strong movement appeared that refused both services. The [[Red Cross]] was the only important organisation employing objectors. Because of this, the waiting lists for the PSS were long, especially in areas like [[Navarre]], where pacifism, [[Basque nationalism]] and a low unemployment rate discouraged young males from the army{{Original research inline|date=January 2011}}. Thousands of ''insumisos'' (non-submittants) publicly refused the PSS, and hundreds were imprisoned. In addition a number of those in the military decided to refuse further duties. A number of people not liable for military service made declarations of self-incrimination, stating that they had encouraged ''insumisión''. The government, fearing popular reaction, reduced the length of service and instead of sentencing ''insumisos'' to prison declared them unfit for public service.

Fronting the decreasing birth rate and the popular opposition to the army, the Spanish government tried to modernise the model carried from the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] era, professionalizing it. The new army tried to provide an education for civilian life and participated in peace operations in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]].

===Turkey===
{{update|section|date=July 2015}}
[[Conscription in Turkey#Conscientious objection|The issue]] is highly controversial in [[Turkey]]. Turkey, [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] are the only three countries refusing to recognize conscientious objection and sustain their membership in the Council of Europe. In January 2006, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) found Turkey had violated article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (prohibition of degrading treatment) in a case dealing with the conscientious objection of [[Osman Murat Ulke]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echr.coe.int/Eng/Press/2006/Jan/Chamberjudgment%C3%9ClkevTurkey240106.htm "Chamber Judgement Ulke vs. Turkey"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009185413/http://www.echr.coe.int/Eng/Press/2006/Jan/Chamberjudgment%C3%9ClkevTurkey240106.htm |date=2006-10-09 }}, Accessed June 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Mehmet Tarhan]] was sentenced to four years in a military prison as a conscientious objector (he was unexpectedly released in March 2006). Journalist [[Perihan Magden]] was tried by a Turkish court for supporting Tarhan and advocating conscientious objection as a human right; but later, she was acquitted.

{{as of|2011|March}}, there were 125 objectors including 25 female objectors in Turkey. Another 256 people of Kurdish origin also had announced their conscientious objection to military service.&lt;ref&gt;See the list on the [http://www.savaskarsitlari.org/arsiv.asp?ArsivTipID=2 pages of the "opponents to war"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604020211/http://www.savaskarsitlari.org/arsiv.asp?ArsivTipID=2 |date=2011-06-04 }}(tr:''savaş karşıtları''), accessed on 15 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Conscientious objector [[İnan Süver]] was named a [[prisoner of conscience]] by Amnesty International.&lt;ref name="AI"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur44/003/2011/en/ |title=Prisoner of conscience escapes and is rearrested |date=28 April 2011 |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |accessdate=2 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 November 2011, the [[Ministry of Justice (Turkey)|Ministry of Justice]] announced a draft proposal to legalise  conscientious objection in Turkey and that it was to take effect two weeks after approval by the President to the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25297170/|title=NTV Haber - Türkiye ve Dünya Gündemi Güncel Son Dakika Haberleri|website=ntvmsnbc.com|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision to legalize by the Turkish government was because of pressure from the European Court of Human Rights. The ECHR gave the Turkish government a deadline until the end of 2011 to legalize conscientious objection. The draft was withdrawn afterwards.

A commission was founded within the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|National Assembly of the Republic]] to write a new constitution in 2012. The commission is still in negotiations on various articles and conscientious objection is one of the most controversial issues.

===United Kingdom===
{{Further|Conscription in the United Kingdom}}
The United Kingdom recognised the right of individuals not to fight in the 18th century following problems with attempting to force Quakers into military service. The Militia Ballot Act of 1757 allowed Quakers to be excluded from service in the [[Militia (Great Britain)|Militia]]. It then ceased to be a major issue, since Britain's armed forces were generally all-volunteer. However, [[press gangs]] were used to beef up army and navy rolls on occasions from the 16th to the early 19th centuries. Pressed men did have the right of appeal, in the case of sailors, to the [[Admiralty]]. The [[Royal Navy]] last took pressed men in the [[Napoleonic War]].

[[File:Conscientious Objector memorial, Tavistock Sq Gardens.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Conscientious Objector memorial in [[Tavistock Square]] Gardens, London&amp;nbsp;— dedicated on [[May 15#Holidays and observances|15 May]] 1994]]

A more general right to refuse military service was not introduced until the [[First World War]]. Britain introduced conscription with the [[Military Service Act (United Kingdom)|Military Service Act]] of January 1916, which came into full effect on 2 March 1916. The Act allowed for objectors to be absolutely exempted, to perform alternative civilian service, or to serve as a non-combatant in the army's [[Non-Combatant Corps]], according to the extent to which they could convince a [[Military Service Tribunals|Military Service Tribunal]] of the quality of their objection.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.P. Taylor, ''English History, 1914–1945'' (Oxford University Press, 1990), p116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 16,000 men were recorded as conscientious objectors, with Quakers, traditionally pacifist, forming a large proportion: 4,500 objectors were exempted on condition of doing civilian 'work of national importance', such as farming, forestry or social service; and 7,000 were conscripted into the specially-created Non-Combatant Corps. However, 6,000 were refused any exemption and forced into main army regiments; if they then refused to obey orders, they were [[Court-martial#United Kingdom|court-martialled]] and sent to prison. Thus, the well-known pacifist and religious writer [[Stephen Henry Hobhouse]] was called up in 1916: he and many other Quaker activists took the unconditionalist stand, refusing both military and alternative service, and on enforced enlistment were court-martialled and imprisoned for disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;Brock, Peter,''These strange criminals: an anthology of prison memoirs by conscientious objectors to military service from the Great War to the Cold War'', p. 14, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0802087078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conscientious objectors formed only a tiny proportion of Military Service Tribunals' cases over the whole conscription period, estimated at around 2%.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Gregory, 'Military Service Tribunals, 1916–1918' in J. Harris (ed.) ''Civil Society in British History''. (Oxford, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Tribunals were notoriously harsh towards conscientious objectors, reflecting widespread public opinion that they were lazy, degenerate, ungrateful 'shirkers' seeking to benefit from the sacrifices of others.&lt;ref&gt;Lois Bibbings, ''Telling Tales About Men''(Manchester University Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty-five objectors, including the [[Richmond Sixteen]], were taken to France and formally sentenced to death by court-martial but immediately reprieved, with commutation to ten-years' penal servitude.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/10507058.Silence_in_castle_to_honour_First_World_War_conscientious_objectors/ Silence in castle to honour First World War conscientious objectors] dated 25 June 2013 at thenorthernecho.co.uk, accessed 19 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions were very hard for conscientious objector prisoners, many of whom were not used to manual work, lack of regular exercise, and the often cold, damp conditions; ten died in prison, and around seventy more died elsewhere as a result of their treatment.

Although a few objectors were accepted for non-combatant service in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]], acting as nursing/paramedic assistants, the majority of non-combatants served in the Non-Combatant Corps on non-lethal stores, road and railway building and general labouring in the UK and France. Conscientious objectors who were deemed not to have made any useful contribution to the state were formally [[Disfranchisement|disfranchised]] (through a clause inserted in the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] at the insistence of back-bench MPs) for the five years 1 September 1921 - 31 August 1926, but as it was a last-minute amendment there was no administrative machinery to enforce such disfranchisement, which was admitted to be a "dead letter".&lt;ref&gt;[[A. J. P. Taylor]], ''English History, 1914–1945'' (Oxford University Press, 1990), p. 116; [http://www.spartacus-educational.com/FWWpacifists.htm FWW Pacifists] at spartacus-educational.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain's conscription legislation of 1916 did not apply to [[Ireland]], despite it being then all part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. However, in 1918 the Army's continuing demand for more troops led to passing a further act enabling conscription in Ireland if and when the government saw fit. In the event, the government never saw fit, although the legislation led to the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918]]. Similarly, British conscription in the [[Second World War]] did not apply to [[Northern Ireland]]. Nevertheless, many [[Irishmen]] volunteered to fight in both world wars. The various parts of the [[British Empire]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] had their own laws: in general, all the larger countries of the Empire participated, and some were, in proportion to their population, major participants in the First World War.

In the Second World War, following the [[National Service (Armed Forces) Act 1939]], there were nearly 60,000 registered Conscientious Objectors. Testing by tribunals resumed, this time by special Conscientious Objection Tribunals chaired by a judge, and the effects were much less harsh. If you were not a member of the Quakers or some similar pacifist organisation, it was generally enough to say that you objected to "warfare as a means of settling international disputes", a phrase from the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]] of 1928. The tribunals could grant full exemption, exemption conditional on alternative service, exemption only from combatant duties, or dismiss the application. Of the 61,000 who were registered, 3,000 were given complete exemption; 18,000 applications were initially dismissed, but a number of such applicants succeeded at the Appellate Tribunal, sometimes after a "qualifying" sentence of three-months' imprisonment for an offence deemed to have been committed on grounds of conscience. Of those directed to non-combatant military service almost 7,000 were allocated to the Non-Combatant Corps, re-activated in mid-1940; its companies worked in clothing and food stores, in transport, or any military project not requiring the handling of "material of an aggressive nature". In November 1940 it was decided to allow troops in the NCC to volunteer for work in [[bomb disposal]].&lt;ref name=UXB92 /&gt; In total over 350 volunteered.&lt;ref name=UXB92&gt;{{cite book |title= Danger UXB The Remarkable Story of the Disposal of Unexploded Bombs During the Second World War |last=Jappy |first=M.J |year=2001 |publisher=Channel 4 books |isbn=0-7522-1938-3 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other non-combatants worked in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]]. For conscientious objectors exempted conditional upon performing civil work, acceptable occupations were [[farm]] work, [[mining]], [[firefighting]] and the [[Emergency medical services|ambulance service]]. About 5,500 objectors were imprisoned, most charged with refusal to attend a medical examination as a necessary preliminary to call-up after being refused exemption, and some charged with non-compliance with the terms of conditional exemption. A further 1,000 were court-martialled by the armed forces and sent to military detention barracks or civil prisons. Differently from the First World War, most sentences were relatively short, and there was no pattern of continually repeated sentences. Nevertheless, the social stigma attached to 'conchies' (as they were called) was considerable; regardless of the genuineness of their motives, cowardice was often imputed.

[[Conscription in the United Kingdom]] was retained, with rights of conscientious objection, as [[National Service]] until the last call-up in 1960 and the last discharge in 1963. The use of all volunteer soldiers was hoped to remove the need to consider conscientious objectors. Ever since the First World War, however, there have been volunteer members of the armed forces who have developed a conscientious objection to continuing in service; a procedure was devised for them in the Second World War, and, with adaptations, it continues to this day.

===United States===
{{Main|Conscientious objection in the United States}}
{{see also|New York Draft Riots|Conscription in the United States}}
There are currently legal provisions in the United States for recognizing conscientious objection, both through the [[Selective Service System]] and through the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. The United States recognizes religious and moral objections, but not selective objections. Conscientious objectors in the United States may perform either civilian work or noncombatant service in lieu of combatant military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sss.gov/consobj |title=Conscientious Objection and Alternative Service |website=Selective Service System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, conscientious objectors have been persecuted in the United States. After the Selective Service System was founded during [[World War I]], such persecutions decreased in frequency, and recognition for conscientious objectors grew.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Other countries===
As of 2005, conscientious objectors in several countries may serve as field paramedics in the army (although some do not consider this a genuine alternative, as they feel it merely helps to make war more humane instead of preventing it). Alternatively, they may serve without arms, although this, too, has its problems. In certain European countries such as Austria, Germany, Greece and Switzerland, there is the option of performing civilian service, subject to the review of a written application or after a hearing about the state of conscience. In Germany, however, the draft was suspended in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/germany-to-suspend-compulsory-military-service/a-6315122|title=Germany to suspend compulsory military service - Germany - DW - 10.12.2010|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|website=DW.COM|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greece, civilian service is twice as long as the corresponding military service; the [[Swiss Civilian Service]] is one and one-half times longer. In 2005, the Swiss parliament considered whether willingness to serve one and a half times longer than an army recruit was sufficient proof of sincerity, citing that the cost of judging the state of conscience of a few thousand men per year was too great.

==Conscientious objection in professional forces==
Only three European Union countries&amp;nbsp;– Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom&amp;nbsp;– recognize the right to conscientious objection for contract and professional military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;War Resisters' International, ''Professional Soldiers and the Right to Conscientious Objection in the European Union'' October 2008, p. 6, downloadable from {{cite web |url=http://wri-irg.org/pdf/eu-rtba2008update-en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118175710/http://wri-irg.org/pdf/eu-rtba2008update-en.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, military personnel who come to a conviction of conscientious objection during their tour of duty must appear in front of a panel of experts, which consists of psychiatrists, military chaplains and officers.

In Switzerland, the panel consists entirely of civilians, and military personnel have no authority whatsoever. In Germany, the draft has been suspended since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/|title=Aktuelle Nachrichten online|last=GmbH|first=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|website=FAZ.NET|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common questions==

Investigators ask questions to determine the sincerity of an individual's convictions. Responses such as "the army is senseless," "it is not just to wage wars," or opposing participation in merely some wars, indicate sociological, philosophical, or political objections, which are not accepted alone.&lt;ref&gt;50 U.S.C. 3806(j)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13393">The '''Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace''' was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on September 13, 1999. This occurred after ten months of negotiations in the context of preparations for the [[International Year for the Culture of Peace]].

UN resolution A/53/243..&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un-documents.net/a53r243a.htm UN resolution A/53/243&lt;/ref&gt; called for the programme of action to include eight action areas:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Culture of peace through education
* Sustainable economic and social development
* Respect for all human rights
* Equality between women and men
* Democratic participation
* Understanding, tolerance and solidarity
* Participatory communication and the free flow of information and knowledge
* International peace and security
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As explained by [[UNESCO]], "each of these areas of action have been priorities of the United Nations since its foundation; what is new is their linkage through the culture of peace and non-violence into a single coherent concept. Linkages have often been made (for example, democracy, development and peace; equality between women and men with development and peace, and so forth). This is the first time, however, that all these areas are interlinked so that the sum of their complementarities and synergies can be developed."&lt;ref&gt;http://undocs.org/en/A/55/377 International Decade for a Culture of Peace and
Non-Violence for the Children of the World: Report of the Secretary-General&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture of Peace== 

United Nations consideration of the culture of peace began in 1992 with the adoption by [[UNESCO]] of a Culture of Peace Programme.  As the programme developed during the following decade, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] began requesting information from UNESCO about its progress.  The General Assembly then declared the Year 2000 as the [[International Year for the Culture of Peace]] and requested UNESCO to submit a draft Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace, which the General Assembly adopted on September 13, 1999.  The General Assembly also declared the Decade 2001-2010 as the [[International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World|International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World]].

Since his retirement from UNESCO where he had promoted the culture of peace in his capacity as Director-General, [[Federico Mayor]] has coordinated the Fundacion Cultura de Paz.  Since his retirement from UNESCO where he chaired the task force for the International Year for the Culture of Peace, [[David Adams (peace activist)|David Adams]] has coordinated the [[Culture of Peace News Network]] which was established for the [[International Year for the Culture of Peace]].

== United Nations Resolution A/53/243 ==

After stating that "the creation of the United Nations system itself, based upon universally shared values and goals, has been a major act towards transformation from a culture of war and violence to a culture of peace and non-violence", the UN General Assembly, in its resolution 52/13 of 20 November 1997, requested UNESCO to submit to its next session a draft declaration and programme of action on a culture of peace&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un-documents.net/a52r13.htm Resolution A/52/13&lt;/ref&gt;.  UNESCO supplied the requested document &lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001130/113034e.pdf Draft Declaration and Programme of Action submitted by UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;which was then taken under consideration by the General Assembly, beginning in December 1998.  The document encountered resistance and the situation at first was not encouraging&lt;ref&gt;http://culture-of-peace.info/history/Adoption.html Adoption of Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace&lt;/ref&gt;. One reason was the fact that the draft declaration referred to a "human right to peace," a concept vigorously opposed by the Great Powers&lt;ref&gt;http://roche.apirg.org/public_html/writings/documents/nuclear/LiuCentrePresentation.pdf 
The Human Right to Peace&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The programme of action also calls for a global movement for a culture of peace and the sharing of information among "actors on their initiatives in this regard".

Addressing the General Assembly, Ambassador [[Anwarul Karim Chowdhury]] of Bangladesh, who had chaired the informal consultation process, called it a unique and universal document: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I believe that this document is unique in more than one way. It is a universal document in the real sense, transcending boundaries, cultures, societies and nations. Unlike many other General Assembly documents, this document is action-oriented and encourages actions at all levels, be they at the level of the individual, the community, the nation or the region, or at the global and international levels.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/53/PV.107 United Nations General Assembly Official Records, Fifty-third Session, 107th plenary meeting&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Manifesto 2000 for a culture of peace and nonviolence ==

The Manifesto was drafted for the International Year for the Culture of Peace by a group of Nobel Peace Prize winners in order to translate the resolutions of the United Nations into everyday language addressed to all people.&lt;ref&gt;http://decade-culture-of-peace.org/iycp/iycp-uk/manifeste/uk_pour_en_savoir_plus.htm UNESCO Information about the Manifesto&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manifesto asked individuals to pledge "in my daily life, in my family, my work, my community, my country and my region, to"&lt;ref&gt;http://decade-culture-of-peace.org/iycp/iycp-uk/manifeste/uk_manifeste.htm Manifesto text&lt;/ref&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Respect the life and dignity of each human being without discrimination or prejudice;
* Practise active nonviolence, rejecting violence in all its forms: physical, sexual, psychological, economic and social, in particular towards the most deprived and vulnerable such as children and adolescents;
* Share my time and material resources in a spirit of generosity to put an end to exclusion, injustice and political and economic oppression;
* Defend freedom of expression and cultural diversity, giving preference always to dialogue and listening without engaging in fanaticism, defamation and the rejection of others;
* Promote consumer behaviour that is responsible and development practices that respect all forms of life and preserve the balance of nature on the planet;
* Contribute to the development of my community, with the full participation of women and respect for democratic principles, in order to create together new forms of solidarity;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Manifesto was translated into more than 50 languages and personally signed by many
Heads of State and Government.  It was diffused throughout the world and individuals were invited to sign and commit themselves to practise its principles in everyday life. As a result, by the end of the International Year, it had been signed by over 74 million individuals, including by more than 1 million each from Brazil, Colombia, India, Japan, Kenya, Nepal and Republic of Korea.&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001223/122350e.pdf Report on the Progress Made by Unesco in the Implementation of the Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace and on Cooperation with the United Nations System in this Field &lt;/ref&gt;

Detailed data entries for the 20 countries with more than 100,000 signatures are shown on the UNESCO website for the Year&lt;ref&gt;http://decade-culture-of-peace.org/iycp/iycp-uk/uk_sum_monde.htm World Information Board&lt;/ref&gt;

== UNESCO Culture of Peace Programme ==

The culture of peace resolution and the Manifesto 2000 campaign were the culmination of a decade-long Culture of Peace Programme at UNESCO.  The Programme was adopted by the UNESCO Executive Board in the fall of 1992, in order to ″heal the social wounds of war by local activities of reconciliation and co-operation in countries where Security Council peace-keeping operations are already being implemented or may be anticipated because of developing violence.″&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0009/000938/093829eo.pdf Co-operation to promote a culture of peace&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major test of the Culture of Peace Programme was in El Salvador&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0009/000958/095819eo.pdf Action programme to promote a culture of peace&lt;/ref&gt; using the methodology of "cross-conflict participation" by which the reconciliation of those who had been fighting against each other in the past was promoted by their joint participation in the planning and implementation of projects designed to benefit all concerned in fields such as education, culture, communication and science&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmu.edu/programs/icar/ijps/vol1_2/UNESCO.htm The UNESCO culture of peace programme in El Salvador: An initial report&lt;/ref&gt;

The national culture of peace programmes did not receive the needed political and financial support from the UNESCO Member States, and were all discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;http://culture-of-peace.info/history/page10.html Early History of the Culture of Peace: National Culture of Peace Projects (1993-1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the most important year in the development of UNESCO/UN culture of peace initiative, three separate initiatives converged: the proclamation of the [[International Year for the Culture of Peace]] (2000)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un-documents.net/a52r15.htm Proclamation of the year 2000 as the International Year for the Culture of Peace&lt;/ref&gt;; the proposal for the UN Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace (see above); and the initiative of the Nobel Peace Laureates "Campaign for the Children of the World"&lt;ref&gt; https://www.un.org/press/en/1997/19970904.unesco4.sep.html Press conference on appeal for launching decade for culture of non-violence&lt;/ref&gt; that would eventually become the [[International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World|International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World]] (2001-2010).

In recent years UNESCO has continued to actively promote the culture of peace in Africa with programs co-ordinated by its field office in Gabon and in cooperation with governments and foundations in Angola and Côte d'Ivoire.&lt;ref&gt;http://cpnn-world.org/new/?p=11285 Will UNESCO once again play a role in the culture of peace?&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Nations High-Level Meetings on the Culture of Peace ==

Beginning in 2012 the President of the United Nations General Assembly has convened in September a High-Level Forum on the Culture of Peace.  The themes of the 2012 Forum were education, youth outreach, and women’s empowerment. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon opened the Forum, saying “When we look at the suffering in our world, we know how urgently we need a culture of peace.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/press/en/2012/ga11281.doc.htm General Assembly High-Level Forum on Culture of Peace&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, similar High-Level Forums have been held at United Nations Headquarters each September.

==  Fundación Cultura de Paz ==

On his retirement as Director-General of UNESCO, Federico Mayor established the Fundación Cultura de Paz to continue the work he had supervised while at UNESCO.  The Fundación has sponsored many events and projects over the years, including the midterm&lt;ref&gt; http://www.fund-culturadepaz.org/spa/INFORME_CULTURA_DE_PAZ/INFORME/InformeENG.pdf World Report on the Culture of Peace&lt;/ref&gt; and final &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fund-culturadepaz.org/spa/DOCUMENTOS/Report_on_the_Decade_for_a_Culture_of_Peace.pdf Final civil society report on the Decade&lt;/ref&gt; reports for the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World. Mayor is frequently invited to address audiences around the world on the subject of the culture of peace &lt;ref&gt; http://fund-culturadepaz.org/eng/07/cent07ENG.htm News&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fundación maintains an updated History of the Culture of Peace which contains references to hundreds of documents and events that have followed up the recommendations of the Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fund-culturadepaz.org/doc/HistoryCultureofPeace.pdf History of the Culture of Peace&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture of Peace News Network ==

The [[Culture of Peace News Network]], begun at UNESCO as part of the [[International Year for the Culture of Peace]], has been continued as a source of news of events that promote the culture of peace.  It is updated more or less daily with articles from around the world promoting at least one of the eight program areas of the culture of peace, and a review of the news is sent out as a bulletin each month.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kosmosjournal.org/article/the-invisible-yet-existent-culture-of-peace/ The Invisible Yet Existent Culture of Peace&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2487">'''Direct Action to Stop the War''' (DASW) was an organization that coordinated [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] [[direct action]]-based opposition activities to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] in the [[San Francisco Bay]] Area. The organization was founded in October 2002 following an overnight [[sit-in]] and morning blockade at the San Francisco Federal Building following the [[U.S. Congress]]'s authorization of the use of force against [[Iraq]]. Operating primarily through the use of [[affinity group]]s and a [[spokescouncil]], it coordinated a mass effort by 5,000 to 20,000 people to disrupt business in the [[Financial District, San Francisco|financial district]] of downtown [[San Francisco]] following the beginning of the war in March 2003. The organization persisted through 2004, coordinating a variety of local protests against corporations with ties to the war effort and sending hundreds of activists to protests in Cancun, [[Miami]] and [[New York City]].

The March 2003 San Francisco actions were the culmination of twenty years of urban direct action organizing. Beginning with the War Chest Tours of the early 1980s and continuing through the 1991 Gulf War and other occasions, direct activists developed the blockading and disruptive tactics that were used by thousands of protesters in opposition to the 2003 war on Iraq. The 1980s protests are documented with photos and narratives at DirectAction.org.

On Jan. 6, 2008, Direct Action to Stop the War was reconvened, with the goal of organizing several direct actions in the San Francisco Bay Area to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the Iraq War.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18316">'''Eastern philosophy in clinical psychology''' refers to the influence of Eastern philosophies on the practice of [[clinical psychology]] based on the idea that East and West are false dichotomies. Travel and trade along the [[Silk Road]] brought ancient texts and mind practices deep into the West.  Vedic psychology dates back  5000 years and forms the core of mental health counselling in the [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic medical]] tradition. The knowledge that enlightened [[Siddhartha Gautama]] was the self-management of mental [[suffering]] through [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] awareness practices. Humane interpersonal care of the mentally disturbed was practiced in the Middle East in the Middle Ages, and later in the West.&lt;ref&gt;MIND (2004) [http://www.mind.org.uk/Information/Factsheets/History+of+mental+health/Notes+on+the+History+of+Mental+Health+Care.htm Notes on the history of mental health care] ''Mind factsheets''&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the founders of clinical psychology were influenced by these ancient texts as translations began to reach Europe during the 19th century.

== Historical clinical psychologists ==
{{further|Islamic psychology}}

The historical practice of clinical psychology may be distinguished from the modern profession of clinical psychology. The Greek word ''psyche'' means 'breath' or 'soul', while ''-logy'' (from ''logos'', meaning 'speech') means 'study of'. [[Eros and Psyche|Psyche]] was the Greek goddess of the soul. An early use of the word [[clinic]] was to describe 'one who receives baptism on a sick bed' (Webster 1913).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionary.net/clinic.&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary use it usually describes another kind of cleansing and rebirth – a non-hospital, healthcare facility for rehabilitation in the community.

[[Patanjali]] was one of the founders of the yoga tradition, sometime between 200 and 400 BC (pre-dating Buddhist psychology) and a student of the [[Vedas]]. He developed the science of breath and mind and wrote his knowledge in the form of between 194 and 196 aphorisms called the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]. These remain one of the only scientific books written in poetic form. He is reputed to have used yoga therapeutically for anxiety, depression and mental disorders as common then as now.

[[File:Guru Rinpoche - Padmasambhava statue.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Padmasambhava|Padmasam-bhava]] developed Tibetan psychiatry]]
[[Padmasambhava]] was the 8th-century medicine Buddha of Tibet, called from the then Buddhist India to tame the Tibetans, and was instrumental in developing Tibetan psychiatric medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, T 'Tibetan buddhist medicine and psychiatry'  Samuel Wiser (1984) including charts of Tibetan psychopharmacology and translation of three chapters of the 8th Century text Gyu-Zhi&lt;/ref&gt; Tibetans were diplomats, counselors, traders, warriors and military tacticians in the Royal courts of East and West. Through these means they introduced arts of war and medicine to the west.

[[Rhazes]] was a Persian physician and scholar of the Middle Ages who had a profound effect on Western thought and medicine as well as the invention of alcohol and of sulfur drugs. He applied the psychology of self-esteem in clinical treatment of his patients (predating [[Nathaniel Branden]] by over a thousand years). He opened the first hospital ward for humane treatment of the mentally ill.

[[Avicenna]]'s ''Canon of Medicine'' was a standard medical text in many European universities for 500 years. He performed psychotherapy without conversing, by observing the movement of a patient's pulse as the patient recounted broken hearted anguish, reported in 'The Life and Work of Jalaluddin Rumi' by Afzal Iqbal, A. J. Arberry, page 94. His treatises have touched most of the Muslim circle of the sciences.

[[Jalaluddin Rumi]]'s view on psychotherapy was to embrace the dread, depression and anger as a blessing. Negative emotions were a bridge to a better life. This style of coping is illustrated in his guesthouse poem: 
::This being human is a guesthouse&lt;br&gt;every morning a new arrival a joy, a&lt;br&gt;depression, a meanness. Some momentary&lt;br&gt;awareness comes as an unexpected&lt;br&gt;visitor. Welcome and entertain them&lt;br&gt;all! Even if they're a crowd of sorrows&lt;br&gt;who violently sweep your house empty of&lt;br&gt;its furniture. Still treat each guest&lt;br&gt;honorably, He may be cleaning you out for&lt;br&gt;some new delight! The dark&lt;br&gt;thought, the shame, the malice meet them&lt;br&gt;at the door laughing and invite them in,&lt;br&gt;be grateful for whoever comes because&lt;br&gt;each has been sent as a guide from the&lt;br&gt;beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Rumi (1995) cited in Zokav (2001), p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] read the German translation of the works of [[Hayyim ben Joseph Vital]] (1542–1620). Vital was a 16th-century rabbi who had been [[Isaac Luria]]'s student, the great master of the theosophical [[Kabbalah]].  Freud read the French translation of the [[Zohar]]. He declared the material 'gold!' without acknowledging that source in his theories. His corpus was deeply influenced by his Jewish heritage and by the Jewish mysticism.&lt;ref&gt;Drob (1989); and, Drob (1998-2006).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jungsm.jpg|thumb|90px|[[Carl Jung]] integrated psychology with spirituality]] 
[[Carl Jung]] read the German translations by [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]] of ''[[The Secret of the Golden Flower]]'', the I Ching. He also read the Kabbalah and drew on its sources for development of his theory of the archetypes.&lt;ref&gt;Drob (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Buber]]

[[Karen Horney]] studied Zen-Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Fromm ''et al.'' (1960, p. 78) states that Karen Horney "was intensely interested in Zen Buddhism during the last years of her life." Also see DeMartino (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fritz Perls]] studied [[Zen Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Wulf (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Typifying such a perspective, Perls once stated: We must lose our minds and come to our senses.

[[Erich Fromm]] collaborated with [[D. T. Suzuki]] in a 1957 workshop on "Zen Buddhism and Psychoanalysis";&lt;ref&gt;Fromm ''et al.''. (1960) is based on presentations given during the 1957 workshop.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote the foreword to a 1986 anthology of [[Nyanaponika Thera]]'s essays.&lt;ref&gt;See Nyanaponika ''et al'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erik H. Erikson]] wrote a biography of Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;Erikson (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Victorfrankl.JPG|thumb|right|100px|[[Viktor Frankl]] wrote of the "[[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]."|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Thursday, 29 November 2007|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt; 
[[Viktor Frankl]] was the founder of Logotherapy. He wrote ''From Death Camp to Existentialism'' (1959) drawing on concentration camp experience and Jewish mysticism.

[[Abraham Maslow]], an American-born Jew who struggled to make his way as a psychologist in an academic atmosphere which was not then ready to receive Jews. He believed his theories of motivation and self-actualization were, despite his avowed atheism, driven by a Jewish consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art.man.ac.uk/RELTHEOL/JEWISH/Silverman.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The Transpersonal psychology that Maslow founded is a blend of Eastern and Western mystic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Nielsen (1994-2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanislav Grof]] studied pre-industrial cosmologies including Egyptian and explored the significance of the posthumous journey of the soul in works such as ''Books of the Dead'' and ''The Human Encounter with Death''.&lt;ref&gt;Grof (1994a); Grof (1994b); Grof &amp; Halifax (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influential Western writers and translators ==
[[Baruch Spinoza]]'s legacy to psychology includes his holistic approach and determinism. He was alienated from his Jewish roots by [[Herem (censure)|excommunication]] and yet embedded in Jewish philosophy and mysticism, for example, 'The human mind cannot be absolutely destroyed with the body, but something of it remains, which is eternal. We feel and know by experience that we are eternal'. (Book V, Proposition 23).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070207080902/http://www.euronet.nl/~advaya/randomnotes.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; He distinguished between active emotions (those that are rationally understood) and passive emotions (those that are not). This predated Freud's popularization of the [[unconscious mind]]. His view, that emotions must be detached from external cause in order to master them, presages [[rational emotive therapy]]. His understanding of the workings of mind makes a bridge between religious mysticism and clinical psychology.

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] was deeply influenced by the first  translations of Hindu and Buddhist texts to reach the west in the 19th Century. His philosophy and methods of inquiry have many similarities to those traditions. His ideas foreshadowed and laid the groundwork for Darwin's theory of evolution and Freud's concepts of libido and unconscious [[Arthur Schopenhauer#Psychology|mind]]. He added empiricism to self-examination, which presaged Freud's interpersonal application in [[psychoanalysis]].

[[File:CAFRD.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Caroline Augusta Foley Rhys Davids|Caroline Rhys Davids]] wrote on [[Buddhism and psychology|Buddhist psychology]].]] 
[[Caroline Rhys Davids]] was a Pali scholar who translated original Pali texts in Buddhist Psychology. In 1914, she  wrote ''Buddhist Psychology: An Inquiry into the Analysis and Theory of Mind in Pali Literature''. Her teacher in Psychology was [[George Croom Robertson]], Scottish philosopher, editor of Mind from foundation in 1876 until 1891.

[[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]] was a translator of Chinese into German of the I Ching, Tao Te Ching and The Secret of the Golden Flower, with a forward written by Jung, a close personal friend.

[[File:Idries Shah.gif|thumb|100px|[[Idries Shah]] expanded Western knowledge of [[Sufism]]]]
[[Idries Shah]] was an  author in the Naqshbandi sufist tradition who wrote works on psychology and spirituality. Defined Sufism in a way that predated Islam and did not depend on the Qur'an.

[[Coleman Barks]] has translated ecstatic poems of [[Rumi]] and other mystic poets of Persia.

[[Jack Kornfield]] trained as a Buddhist monk in India and Southeast Asia, holds a PhD in clinical psychology and co-founded the [[Insight Meditation Society]] and the Spirit Rock Meditation Center. His books include ''Seeking the Heart of Wisdom'' (1987, co-authored with [[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]]), ''A Path with Heart'' (1993) and ''The Art of Forgiveness, Lovingkindness and Peace'' (2002).

[[Daniel Goleman]] taught psychology at Harvard, wrote on science for the New York Times and is the author of the best-selling ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1995) and ''Destructive Emotions: A Scientific Dialogue with the Dalai Lama'' (Bantam Books, 2003).

[[Thomas Cleary]] was a prolific translator of Buddhist, Taoist, Confucian and Muslim religious literature. First publication with his brother of the [[Blue Cliff Record]] in 1992.

== Contemporary clinicians ==
[[Marsha M. Linehan]] incorporates mindfulness techniques (particularly [[Zen]] practices) in her [[Dialectical Behavioral Therapy]] (DBT) which has been found to be particularly effective with Cluster-B personality disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Regarding Linehan's conscious use of Zen techniques, see, for instance, Linehan (1993a), p. 19, and  Linehan (1993b), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] incorporates Buddhist [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] techniques in his [[Mindfulness-based stress reduction|Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction]] (MBSR) program.&lt;ref&gt;Kabat-Zinn (1990), pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Epstein]] is the author of ''Thoughts Without a Thinker|Thoughts without a Thinker: Psychotherapy from a Buddhist Perspective'' (1995) and ''Going to Pieces Without Falling Apart'' (1998).&lt;ref&gt;[http://domanassa.org/blog/sitting-with-depression/ Sitting with Depression]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mordechai Rotenberg]] has adopted the [[Kabbalistic]]-[[Hasidic]] [[tzimtzum]] paradigm, which he believes has significant implications for clinical therapy. According to this paradigm, God's "self-contraction" to vacate space for the world serves as a model for human behavior and interaction. The tzimtzum model promotes a unique community-centric approach which contrasts starkly with the language of Western psychology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishpsychology.org/about2_e.php Rotenberg Center for Jewish Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques used in clinical settings ==

* [[Vipassana]] - trains one to perceive the momentary arising and dissipating of all phenomena, nurturing the calm, detached recognition of all things' impermanence and interdependence.

'''The femicides in Honduras''' is a concept which designates the [[Murder|murders]] comitted against women within the [[Honduras]] territory in Central America, since 1990. According to the Penal Code in force until 2018, the crime of femicide is incurred, when a man or men kill a woman for reasons of gender, with hatred and contempt for her condition as a woman. Between 2002 and 2013 3,923 women were murdered.&lt;ref name="elmundo.es"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/internacional/2014/04/29/53600cb4268e3ec52a8b458b.html|title=Cerca de 4.000 mujeres fueron asesinadas en Honduras entre 2002 y 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elnuevoherald.com/2013/11/06/1608639/mas-de-3600-mujeres-fueron-asesinadas.html |title=Más de 3,600 mujeres fueron asesinadas en Honduras entre 2002 y junio de 2013 - América Latina - ElNuevoHerald.com |date=10 September 2014 |publisher= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910215834/http://www.elnuevoherald.com/2013/11/06/1608639/mas-de-3600-mujeres-fueron-asesinadas.html |archivedate=September 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of [[femicide]]s makes up 9.6% of the total number of homicides in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/2014_GLOBAL_HOMICIDE_BOOK_web.pdf|title = Global Study on Homicide|date = 2013|accessdate = |website = www.unodc.org|publisher = United National Office of Drugs and Crime (Vienna)|last = Gibbons|first = Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, 53 women were killed every month and, as it occurs in the rest of murders, more than 90% of the cases were left in impunity. Before being killed, the women are commonly also burned, raped, and tortured. Between 2010 and 2013 the number of murders increased in 65%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laprensa.hn/honduras/555191-97/los-asesinatos-de-mujeres-aumentan-un-65-por-ciento-en-honduras|title=Los asesinatos de mujeres aumentan un 65 por ciento en Honduras|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laprensa.hn/csp/mediapool/sites/LaPrensa/Especiales/story.csp?cid=381912&amp;sid=770&amp;fid=273|title=Una interminable "epidemia" muerte de mujeres en Honduras|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local national authorities have been accused of inaction by the population, given that in many cases it has not been cleared the responsibility of said felonies. There are a few government and non-government organizations that provide support to the mothers and relatives victims of [[femicide]]. In 2015, the Honduran government committed with 30 million [[Honduran lempira]]s for the creation of a special unit in the 2016 budget for femicide investigation.

== Femicides in 2017 ==
The violent deaths of women and femicides registered between January and December of 2017, added up a total of 389 cases. To disaggregate the data according to the age of the victims, 30.1% (117) was between 15 and 24 years old, women that are in the process of building their identity, educational training, and reproductive age. The records show that the greatest vulnerability occurred in the range of 20 to 24 years, accumulating 17.2% (67) of the total, while the age groups that showed the lowest number of victims were girls under 15 years of age with 32 cases and women aged 60 and over, with 21 victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iudpas.unah.edu.hn/observatorio-de-la-violencia/boletines-del-observatorio-2/unidad-de-genero/|title=Muerte Violenta de Mujeres y Femicidios|last=|first=|date=|website=Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Femicides ==
As in most homicides comitted in Honduras, femicides continue to occur due to lack of investigation and judicial process.

== Contract Killing in Honduras ==
One of the most common methods of murdering women in Honduras is [[contract killing]], shooting the women either inside or outside of their residence and then escaping.

== National Civil Code Reforms ==
In February 2013 the [[National Congress of Honduras]] approved a reform in the national civil code which classified femicide as a serious felony, sanctioning with a sentence of up to 40 years in prison.&lt;ref name="elmundo.es" /&gt;

== Causes ==
Causes for the high level of femicides in Honduras are varied, although one of the principal causes is impunity, because 90% of murders are not investigated, so the killers continue to commit more femicides. 

== Unit for the Investigation of Femicides ==
In 2015, the [[Politics of Honduras|government of Honduras]] attributed 30 million [[Honduran lempira]]s to the creation of a special unit in the 2016 budget for the investigation of femicides.

'''Football hooliganism'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/find_out/guides/sport/international_football/newsid_3089000/3089728.stm | title=What is football hooliganism? | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the term used to describe disorderly, violent or destructive behaviour perpetrated by spectators at [[association football]] events.&lt;ref name="independent38673"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Another sorry outbreak of the English disease|work=[[The Independent]]|date=17 June 2004|url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/leading_articles/article38673.ece|accessdate=2007-07-25|location=London|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930155241/http://comment.independent.co.uk/leading_articles/article38673.ece|archivedate=30 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Football [[hooliganism]] normally involves conflict between gangs, in English known as football [[List of hooligan firms|firm]]s (the term derives from the British slang for a criminal gang), formed for the purpose of intimidating and physically attacking supporters of other teams. Other English-language terms commonly used in connection with hooligan firms include "army", "boys", "[[Casual (subculture)|casuals]]", and "crew".  Certain clubs have long-standing rivalries with other clubs and hooliganism associated with matches between them (sometimes called [[local derby|local derbies]]) is likely to be more severe.

Conflict may take place before, during or after matches. Participants often select locations away from stadiums to avoid arrest by the police, but conflict can also erupt spontaneously inside the stadium or in the surrounding streets.&lt;ref name="Tribune001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="novasports.gr" /&gt; In extreme cases, hooligans, police, and bystanders have been killed, and body-armoured [[riot police]] have intervened with [[tear gas]], [[police dogs]], [[armoured fighting vehicle|armoured vehicles]] and [[water cannon]]s.&lt;ref name="soccerphile001"/&gt; Hooligan-led violence has been called "aggro" (short for "aggravation") and "bovver" (the [[Cockney]] pronunciation of "bother", i.e. trouble).

Hooligans who have the time and money, may follow national teams to away matches and engage in hooligan behaviour against the hooligans of the home team.  They may also become involved in disorder involving the general public.  While national-level firms do not exist in the form of club-level firms, hooligans supporting the national team may use a collective name indicating their allegiance.

==Behavior==

Football hooliganism involves a wide range of behaviour, including:
* taunting
* spitting
* unarmed fighting
* throwing of objects on to the pitch, either in an attempt to harm players and officials or as a gesture of insult.
*throwing of objects at opposing supporters, including stones, bricks, coins, flares and [[Molotov cocktail]]s.&lt;ref name="Tribune001"/&gt;&lt;ref name=novasports.gr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.novasports.gr/default.asp |title=novasports.gr |publisher=novasports.gr |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314052754/http://www.novasports.gr/default.asp |archivedate=14 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* fighting with weapons including [[baseball bats|sports bats]], glass bottles, rocks, [[rebar]], knives, [[machetes]] and [[firearms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwworld.de/dw/article/0,2144,1701053,00.html |title=German Hooligans Make Mark in Bratislava &amp;#124; World Cup 2006 &amp;#124; Deutsche Welle &amp;#124; 05.09.2005 |publisher=Dwworld.de |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* disorderly crowd behaviour such as pushing, which may cause stadium fixtures such as fences and walls to collapse.  Similar effects can occur when law-abiding crowds try to flee disorder caused by hooligans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1094303.stm |title=Fence collapse hits soccer final |publisher=BBC News |date=30 December 2000 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
The first instance of football violence is unknown, but the [[phenomenon]] can be traced back to [[History of England#14th century|14th-century England]]. In 1314, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] banned football (at that time, a violent, unruly activity involving rival villages kicking a [[pig's bladder]] across the local [[heath]]) because he believed the disorder surrounding matches might lead to [[Rebellion|social unrest]], or even [[treason]].&lt;ref name="Guardian061213"&gt;{{Cite news|title=When did football hooliganism start?|publisher=The Guardian|date=13 December 2006|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/news/theknowledge/0,9204,618130,00.html|accessdate=2007-07-25 | location=London | first=Sean | last=Ingle}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[University of Liverpool]] academic [[Academic paper#Scholarly paper|paper]], conflict at an 1846 match in [[Derby]], England, required a reading of the "[[riot act]]" and two groups of [[dragoon]]s to effectively respond to the disorderly crowd. This same paper also identified "[[pitch invasion]]s" as a common occurrence during the 1880s in English football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIG FACT-SHEET FOUR: HOOLIGANISM|url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/footballindustry/hooligan.html|work=University of Liverpool FIG Factsheet|publisher=Liverpool FC|accessdate=9 May 2012|author=Pearson, G.|date=December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded instances of football hooliganism in the [[History of association football#From amateurism to professionalism|modern game]] allegedly occurred during the 1880s in England, a period when [[gang]]s of supporters would intimidate neighbourhoods, in addition to attacking referees, opposing supporters and players. In 1885, after [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] beat [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] 5–0 in a friendly match, both teams were [[wikt:pelt|pelted]] with stones, attacked with sticks, punched, kicked and spat at. One Preston player was beaten so severely that he lost consciousness and press reports at the time described the fans as "howling roughs".&lt;ref name="Guardian061213"/&gt; The following year, Preston fans fought [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] fans in a railway station—the first alleged instance of football hooliganism outside of a match. In 1905, a number of Preston fans were [[Trial|tried]] for hooliganism, including a "[[Public intoxication|drunk and disorderly]]" 70-year-old woman, following their match against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].&lt;ref name="Guardian061213"/&gt;

Although instances of football crowd violence and disorder have been a feature of association football throughout its history&lt;ref name="Dunning"&gt;Dunning, E, Murphy, P and Williams, J., 'The Roots of Football Hooliganism' 1988, Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]'s ground was reportedly closed in 1920, 1934 and 1950 after crowd disturbances), the phenomenon only started to gain the media's attention in the late 1950s due to the re-emergence of violence in [[History of association football#South America|Latin American football]]. In the 1955–56 English football season, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] fans were involved in a number of incidents and, by the 1960s, an average of 25 hooligan incidents were being reported each year in England. The label "football hooliganism" first began to appear in the English media in the mid-1960s,&lt;ref name="Stott"&gt;Stott, C. and Pearson, G., 'Football Hooliganism: Policing and the War on the English Disease', 2007 London: Pennant Books&lt;/ref&gt; leading to increased media interest in, and reporting of, acts of disorder. It has been argued that this in turn created a 'moral panic' out of proportion with the scale of the actual problem.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;Hall, S, 'The Treatment of 'Football Hooligans' in the Press', in Ingham et al., (1978) Football Hooliganism: The Wider Context, London: Inter-Action Inprint&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Football hooliganism has factors in common with juvenile delinquency and what has been called "ritualized male violence".&lt;ref&gt;Ramón Spaaij, Understanding Football Hooliganism: A Comparison of Six Western European Countries&lt;/ref&gt; Sports Studies scholars Paul Gow and Joel Rookwood at [[Liverpool Hope University]] found in a 2008 study that "Involvement in football violence can be explained in relation to a number of factors, relating to interaction, identity, legitimacy and power. Football violence is also thought to reflect expressions of strong emotional ties to a football team, which may help to reinforce a supporter’s sense of identity."&lt;ref name="joelrookwood.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joelrookwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Paper-6-Gow-and-Rookwood-Vol-2-2009.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031101939/http://www.joelrookwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Paper-6-Gow-and-Rookwood-Vol-2-2009.pdf |archivedate=31 October 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] one study from 1986 claimed that alcohol, irregular tickets sales,  the disinterest of the organisers and the "'cowardly ineptitude'" of the police had led to the tragedy. Gow and Rookwood's 2008 study, which used interviews with British football hooligans found that while some identified structural social and physiological causes (e.g. aggression produces violent reactions) most interviewees claimed that media reports (especially in newspapers) and the police's handling of hooligan related events were the main causes of hooliganism.&lt;ref name="joelrookwood.com"/&gt; [[Politics|Political]] reasons may also play in part in hooliganism, especially if there is a political undertone to such a match (e.g. unfriendly nations facing each other).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/devon/hi/people_and_places/newsid_9176000/9176519.stm|title=Why does football violence happen?|date=10 November 2010|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an attempt to explain the hooliganism phenomena in Brazil, Nepomuceno and other scholars at Federal University of Pernambuco has accessed 1363 hooligan incidents before and after an alcohol sanction enforced during 8 years. While alcohol presented low evidence to contribute for the incidents of violence, the knockout phases, finals, competitiveness (derby matches), small score boundaries and the pride levels were some of the potentials for the violence among sports spectators. Months after the work being conducted, the State Legislature of Pernambuco decided to abolish the sanction to allow alcohol intake in stadiums.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nepomuceno|first=Thyago Celso C.|last2=de Moura|first2=Jadielson Alves|last3=e Silva|first3=Lúcio Câmara|last4=Cabral Seixas Costa|first4=Ana Paula|date=December 2017|title=Alcohol and violent behavior among football spectators: An empirical assessment of Brazilian's criminalization|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlcj.2017.05.001|journal=International Journal of Law, Crime and Justice|volume=51|pages=34–44|doi=10.1016/j.ijlcj.2017.05.001|issn=1756-0616}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the [[BBC]] in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22158585 |title=BBC Sport – Millwall &amp; Newcastle violence: Who is to blame for football chaos? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=15 April 2013 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Bond stated that in the UK, {{quote|text=[h]igh-profile outbreaks of violence involving fans are much rarer today than they were 20 or 30 years ago. The scale of trouble now compared to then doesn't bear comparison – either in terms of the number of people involved or the level of organisation.  Football has moved on thanks to [[ban (law)|banning orders]] and better, more sophisticated policing.
And while it is too simplistic to say that the higher cost of watching football has pushed unsavoury elements out, there has been a shift in the way people are expected to behave inside grounds. Offensive chants are still way too commonplace but actual fighting doesn't happen very often.}}

==Subculture==
Football hooligans often appear to be less interested in the football match than in the associated violence. They often engage in behaviour that risks their being arrested before the match, denied admittance to the stadium, ejected from the stadium during the match or banned from attending future matches. Hooligan groups often associate themselves with, and congregate in, a specific section (called an ''end'' in England) of their team's stadium, and sometimes they include the section's name in the name of their group. In the United Kingdom, 1960s and early 1970s football hooliganism was associated with the [[skinhead]] subculture. Later, the [[casual (subculture)|casual]] subculture transformed the British football hooligan scene. Instead of wearing working class skinhead-style clothes, which readily identified hooligans to the police, hooligans began wearing [[Designer clothing|designer clothes]] and expensive "offhand" [[Sportswear (fashion)|sportswear]] (clothing worn without careful attention to practical considerations), particularly [[Stone Island]], [[Prada]], [[Burberry]], [[CP Company]], [[Sergio Tacchini]] and [[Adidas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FASHION: On the Street; A Rainbow of Raincoats|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/02/style/fashion-on-the-street-a-rainbow-of-raincoats.html|accessdate=9 May 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 April 1989|author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-hooligan measures==
Police and civil authorities in various countries with hooligan problems have taken a number of measures, including:
* banning items that could be used as weapons or missiles in stadiums, and searching suspected hooligans
* banning identified hooligans from stadiums, either formally via judicial orders, or informally by denying them admittance on the day
* moving to [[All-seater stadium|all-seated stadiums]], which reduces the risk of disorderly crowd movement
* segregating opposing fans, and fencing enclosures to keep fans away from each other and off the pitch
* banning opposing fans from matches and/or ordering specific matches to be played behind closed doors
* compiling registers of known hooligans
* restricting the ability of known hooligans to travel overseas.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
Football hooliganism in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is particularly associated with the supporters of clubs such as [[FK Sarajevo]] ([[Horde Zla]]), [[FK Željezničar Sarajevo]] ([[The Maniacs]]), [[FK Velež Mostar]] ([[Red Army Mostar|Red Army]]), [[HŠK Zrinjski Mostar]] (Ultrasi) and [[FK Borac Banja Luka]] (Lešinari).  Other clubs with hooligans as supporters include [[FK Sloboda Tuzla]] (Fukare), [[NK Čelik Zenica]] (Robijaši) and [[NK Široki Brijeg]] (Škripari).

Hooliganism reflects local ethnic divisions and tensions.  Bosniak oriented groups are fans of FK Sarajevo, FK Željezničar and FK Velež Mostar.  Serb oriented groups are fans of FK Borac Banja Luka, [[FK Slavija]], and [[FK Drina Zvornik]] (Vukovi). Croat oriented groups are fans of [[NK Široki Brijeg]] (Škripari) and HŠK Zrinjski Mostar.

Many fans are associated with fascist ideologies, supporting and glorifying extremist movements such as the [[Ustaše]], [[Chetniks]] and [[Nazi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lampa Studio d.o.o. – www.lampa.ba |url=http://sportsport.ba/bh_fudbal/ne-nacizmu/46262 |title=Ne nacizmu! |publisher=SportSport.ba |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 [[2009 NK Široki Brijeg–FK Sarajevo football riots|riots]] between supports of [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Premier League]] club sides [[NK Široki Brijeg]] and [[FK Sarajevo]] left [[Horde Zla]] supporter Vedran Puljić (from [[Sarajevo]]) dead from a gunshot wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riotonline.com/blog/2009/10/fc-sarajevo-fan-dies-in-riots/ |title=FC Sarajevo fan dies in riots! &amp;#124; Riot terrace fashion blog |publisher=Riotonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooliganism has also been present in lower leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lampa Studio d.o.o. – www.lampa.ba |url=http://sportsport.ba/bh_fudbal/veliki-neredi-u-jablanici-spasavala-se-ziva-glava/106331 |title=Veliki neredi u Jablanici, spašavala se živa glava |publisher=SportSport.ba |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riots have been common in Jablanica because fans of different clubs tend to meet and clash there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lampa Studio d.o.o. – www.lampa.ba |url=http://sportsport.ba/bh_fudbal/sprijecen-sukob-navijaca-borca-i-zrinjskog-u-jablanici/104194 |title=Spriječen sukob navijača Borca i Zrinjskog u Jablanici |publisher=SportSport.ba |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Croatia===
Football hooliganism in [[Croatia]] has seen riots over inter-ethnic resentments and the politics that were reignited by the breakup of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav federation]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="soccerphile001"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Podnar |first=Ozren| title=The Day Yugoslav Soccer Died |publisher=Soccerphile |url=http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/news/balkans-soccer/football-war.html |accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the best known [[List of hooligan firms|hooligan firms]] are [[Torcida Split|Torcida]] ([[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]]) and [[Bad Blue Boys]] ([[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]]).&lt;ref name="soccerphile002"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Podnar |first=Ozren| title=The Ultra Scene in Croatia and Serbia: Football Hooliganism Balkan Style |publisher=Soccerphile |url=http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/news/balkans-soccer/hooligans.html |accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the groups are not just hooligan firms; they are more like the South American [[Torcida]] supporters groups and [[Ultras]] groups, with organised [[Tifo]]s and so on.

On 13 May 1990 (before the breakup of Yugoslavia) Serbian club [[Red Star Belgrade]] was in [[Zagreb]] to play [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] at the [[Maksimir Stadium]]. Red Star was accompanied by 3000 Delije, the organized supporters of the club. Before the match a number of small fights broke out. Police reinforcements soon arrived with [[armoured fighting vehicle|armoured vehicles]] and [[water cannon]]s, focusing to separate the fans. Dinamo's player [[Zvonimir Boban]] kicked one policeman, defending a Dinamo's fan beaten by the police. The fighting lasted for over an hour and hundreds of people were injured. Football hooliganism in Croatia is sometimes connected with racism and nationalism,&lt;ref name="soccerphile001"/&gt; although the racist remarks, if any appear, are pointed solely to opposing club's players, never to own squad.

Ethnic tension between Croats and Serbs has also led to fighting at a football match in Australia. On 13 March 2005, [[Sydney United FC|Sydney United]] (who have a large Croatian following, and were established by Croatian immigrants) and [[Bonnyrigg White Eagles Football Club|Bonnyrigg White Eagles]] (who have a large Serbian following and were established by Serbian immigrants) met in Sydney in the [[New South Wales Premier League]]. About 50 fans clashed, resulting in two police officers getting injured and five fans being arrested. [[Football NSW]] held an inquiry into the events.

Croatian hooligans are also notorious for staging large illegal pyroshows at stadiums, where signal flares and smoke bombs are hurled onto the pitch causing postponement or cancellation of the match. A large incident occurred in 2003 in Rome during the Hajduk-Roma match when 900 Torcida fans threw signal flares at Roma fans resulting in various injuries and clashes with the police.

Another incident occurred in [[Genoa]] in 2007 when masked Torcida fans attacked the police with bricks, bottles and stones. Rioting continued in the stadium when Torcida fans threw chairs into the pitch and made [[nazi]] salutes. A riot occurred in 2006 in [[Osijek]] during the Osijek-Dinamo match. Several clashes between the Bad Blue Boys and [[Kohorta Osijek|Kohorta]] occurred before the match in which one Osijek fan received several stab wounds after which Osijek fans attacked the police and Dinamo fans with signal flares and stones.

A large riot occurred in 2008 in [[Prague]] prior to the [[Sparta Prague]]-Dinamo match. Riots were ignited with the support of Sparta's ultrafans to Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}}[http://www.index.hr/sport/clanak/bbb-se-susrecu-s-ljubiteljima-karadzica-i-mladica-kojima-ogradu-krasi-srpska-zastava/400226.aspx Index.hr] BBB se susreću s ljubiteljima Karadžića i Mladića, 8 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- just see the pictures --&gt; Approximately 500 Bad Blue Boys rioted in the city centre breaking shops and attacking police with chairs, signal flares and stones. Approximately 300 Bad Blue Boys were detained and 8 police officer were injured. Prior to the riots some Bad Blue Boys provoked local [[Romani people]] by giving [[nazi]] salutes.

After the match violent clashes continued in which one Dinamo fan was shot by police officers. A large incident occurred in 2009 prior to the [[FC Timişoara]]-Dinamo match. 400 Bad Blue Boys rioted in the city centre and attacked local people. After the incident [[Romanians|Romanian]] police detained a large number of Dinamo fans but the situation escalated again at the [[FC Timişoara]] stadium when 200 Bad Blue Boys tore down the pitch fence and attacked the police with chairs and bats resulting in several injured police officers. During the clash Dinamo fans fired signal missiles at [[FC Timişoara]] fans resulting in severe injuries.
Many [[Croats|Croatian]] hooligan groups have also displayed [[nazi]] flags at matches and have [[neo-nazi]] [[skinheads]] in their ranks. Several incidents occurred when Bad Blue Boys and Torcida made racist chants towards opposing club's football players of [[Black people|African]]&lt;!-- Charlize Theron and Richard Gibson are also of African descent --&gt; descent and hurled bananas in the pitch. In 2010, a [[Cameroon]] player was attacked in [[Koprivnica]] resulting in severe injuries.

In December 2010. 10–15 Tornado ([[Zadar]]) hooligans attacked a [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] traveling coach with stones and bricks resulting in one injured person. In December 2010 30–40 [[Bad Blue Boys]] attacked a [[PAOK]] traveling coach with stones, bricks and flares setting the traveling coach on fire and inflicting injuries on several passengers.

In November 2014, during a [[Euro 2016]] qualifying game in [[Milan, Italy]] hooligans from Croatia threw flares and fireworks onto the field and the game had to be briefly suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2836967/Italy-1-1-Croatia-European-Championship-qualifier-suspended-10-minutes-second-half.html|title=Italy 1-1 Croatia: European Championship qualifier suspended for 10 minutes in second-half - Daily Mail Online|date=16 November 2014|work=Mail Online|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyprus===
Football hooliganism in Cyprus has been an issue for the past few decades and incidents are generally associated with the 5 major Cypriot clubs.

[[Anorthosis Famagusta FC]] fans have been in involved in many incidents on most occasions involving their ultras group "Mahites".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sigmalive.com/news/local/103398/epeisodia-ston-petosfairiko-agona-anagennisi-anorthosi|title=Επεισόδια στον πετοσφαιρικό αγώνα Αναγέννηση- Ανόρθωση|author=sigmalive/ΚΥΠΕ|date=22 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two clubs in Limassol, [[AEL Limassol]] and [[Apollon Limassol]] have also been involved in numerous incidents, especially in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsbeast.gr/sports/arthro/680998/epeisodia-amaurosan-to-derbi-ael-apoel/|title=Επεισόδια αμαύρωσαν το ντέρμπι ΑΕΛ-ΑΠΟΕΛ|work=Newsbeast.gr|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philenews.com/el-gr/koinonia-eidiseis/160/153504/krisimos-travmatismos-nearou-sto-filiko-anorthosi-apollon|title=Κρίσιμος τραυματισμός νεαρού στο φιλικό Ανόρθωση-Απόλλων|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ant1iwo.com/kypros/2013/11/03/treis-syllhceis-gia-ta-epeisodia-ston-ag/|title=ANT1 internet world - Τρεις συλλήψεις για τα επεισόδια στον αγώνα Απόλλων - ΑΠΟΕΛ|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of [[APOEL FC]] and [[AC Omonia Nicosia]], the two most successful and most popular clubs in the country are notorious for hooliganism. The most violent cases of hooliganism in Cyprus usually involve the two teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philenews.com/el-gr/koinonia-eidiseis/160/200575/ektetamena-epeisodia-exo-apo-to-oikima-tou-apoel|title=Εκτεταμένα επεισόδια έξω από το οίκημα του ΑΠΟΕΛ|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport24.gr/football/Cyprus/epeisodia-sthn-kupro.2792956.html|title=Επεισόδια και διακοπή στο ΑΕΛ - ΑΠΟΕΛ|author=Φώντας Σέμπρος|date=17 May 2014|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ant1iwo.com/kypros/2012/05/17/skhniko-polemoy-sth-lemeso-videos/{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport24.gr/multimedia/video/anorthwsh-omonoia-epeisodia.1977896.html|title=Ανόρθωση - Ομόνοια (επεισόδια)|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009 APOEL fans entered the Omonia stand and engaged in fistfights with Omonia fans eventually throwing one down the stand stairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.article&amp;id=42915|title=Σοβαρά επεισόδια και διακοπή του ντέρμπι ΑΠΟΕΛ-Ομόνοια|work=Ελευθεροτυπία|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6 months later in November fans of the two teams clashed close to the [[GSP Stadium]] when APOEL fans tried to hijack a futsal tournament organized by Omonia.

The rivalry between Omonia and APOEL has its roots in politics. APOEL fans are in their majority right wing whereas Omonia fans are left wing. Communist symbols in the Omonia stand and right wing or even fascist symbols in the APOEL stand are not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leftwingsoccer.com/politics-of-cypriot-football/|title=Left-Wing Soccer – Understanding the Political Divide in Cypriot Football|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Limassol rivalry between Apollon and AEL Limassol is more a matter of what team dominates over the city.&lt;ref name="free-project.eu"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.free-project.eu/documents-free/Working%20Papers/Performing%20Fan%20Identities%20Role%20Politics%20Antagonistic%20Communication%20Football%20Fans%20Cyprus%20%28S%20Stylianou%20V%20Theodoropoulou%29.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623144937/http://www.free-project.eu/documents-free/Working%20Papers/Performing%20Fan%20Identities%20Role%20Politics%20Antagonistic%20Communication%20Football%20Fans%20Cyprus%20%28S%20Stylianou%20V%20Theodoropoulou%29.pdf |archive-date=23 June 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooliganism in the case of Anorthosis is also politically linked, especially when the club plays a left wing team such as Omonia. Other incidents between clubs of different cities that are of the same political orientation are associated with intercity rivalries, particularly when a club from Limassol faces a club from Nicosia.&lt;ref name="free-project.eu"/&gt;

===France===

[[File:Supporters LOSC vs PSV Eindhoven.png|thumb|This photo of a match in [[Lille]] shows the use of flares by PSV Eindhoven supporters in football hooliganism.]]
Football hooliganism in France is often rooted in [[social conflict]], including racial tension. In the 1990s, fans of [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] (PSG) fought with supporters from Belgium, England, Germany, Italy and Scotland.&lt;ref name = "Bay"&gt;{{Cite news| title =Racist insults infiltrate French soccer stadium|url =http://www.baystatebanner.com/archives/stories/2006/04/042006-07.htm | publisher =[[The Boston Bay State Banner]]| date= 20 April 2006 | accessdate = 2006-10-21|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060715011039/http://www.baystatebanner.com/archives/stories/2006/04/042006-07.htm |archivedate = 15 July 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a long-standing north/south rivalry between PSG (representing Paris and by extension northern France) and [[Olympique de Marseille]] (representing the South of France) which has encouraged authorities to be extremely mobilised during games between the two teams. Violent fights and post-game riots including car burning, and shop windows smashing have been a regular fixture of PSG-OM games. In 2000, the bitter rivalry turned particularly violent.&lt;ref name="BBC3"&gt;{{Cite news| title = PSG act after fan hurt

On 24 November 2006 a PSG fan was shot and killed by police and another seriously injured during fighting between PSG fans and the police. The violence occurred after PSG lost 4–2 to [[Israeli people|Israeli]] club [[Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C.|Hapoel Tel Aviv]] at the Parc des Prince in a [[UEFA Cup]] match. PSG fans chased a fan of Hapoel Tel Aviv, shouting racist and anti-semitic slogans. A plainclothes police officer who tried to protect the Hapoel fan was attacked, and in the chaos, one fan was shot dead and another seriously injured. In response, the French Interior Minister, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] held a meeting with the president of the French Football League, Frederic Thiriez to discuss racism and violence in football. The director-general of the French police, Michel Gaudin, insisted that measures against football hooliganism had reduced racist incidents to six that season from nineteen in the previous season. Gaudin also stated that 300 known hooligans could be banned from matches.&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{Cite news| title = France faces up to football hooliganism |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6189888.stm | publisher = BBC| date= 27 November 2006 | accessdate = 2007-04-29 | first=Caroline | last=Wyatt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fan who was shot, was linked with the ''Boulogne Boys'', a group of fans who modelled themselves on British hooligans in the 1980s. The group's name comes from the [[Kop of Boulogne]] (KOB), one of the two main home fan stand at the Parc des Princes.

The KOB themselves held a silent memorial march attended by 300 and accused the police office of murdering the fan. They cited bias in the French press who had only given a "one-sided" account of the incident.&lt;ref name="BBC2"/&gt; French President [[Jacques Chirac]] condemned violence that led up to the shooting, stating that he was horrified by the reports of racism and anti-Semitism. French Prime Minister, [[Dominique de Villepin]] called for new, tougher measures to deal with football hooligans. Prosecutors opened an inquiry into the incident, to determine whether the officer involved should face criminal charges.&lt;ref name="BBC5"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Chirac condemns football violence |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6182414.stm | publisher = BBC| date= 25 November 2006 | accessdate = 2007-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC6"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Paris fan shot dead by policeman |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6179418.stm | publisher = BBC| date= 24 November 2006 | accessdate = 2007-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0408-011, FC Carl Zeiss Jena - FC Berlin, Ausschreitungen.jpg|thumb|right |German football hooligans with masked faces in a 1990s match.]]Before a home match against [[FC Sochaux-Montbéliard|Sochaux]] on 4 January 2006, two [[Arab]] youths were punched and kicked by [[white people|white]] fans outside the entrance to the KOB. During the match racist insults were aimed at black players and a PSG player of [[Demographics of India|Indian]] origin, [[Vikash Dhorasoo]] was told to "go sell peanuts in the metro".&lt;ref name="Bay" /&gt; In the recent years, following UK's example, France's legislation has changed, including more and more banning of violent fans from stadiums. The threat of dissolution of fan groups has also tempered the outward rivalry and violence of a number of fans. Known violent fans under ban sentences are to report to the nearest Police station on nights of game, to prove they are not anywhere in proximity to the stadium.

On 11 June 2016, during a Euro 2016 match in [[Marseille]] between Russia and England, violent conflict broke out between the fans and left 35 injured. Both threw numerous items at each other and engaged in physical combat. Even a person who is recording the incident can be seen stomping another person's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/14/new-gopro-style-footage-shows-fan-violence-first-hand/|title=Incredible GoPro-style footage from Russian fan shows Euro 2016 violence with England supporters first-hand|website=The Telegraph|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, both countries were given a disqualification warning soon later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36510550|title=Euro 2016: England and Russia given disqualification warning - BBC News|website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match ended with 1-1.

The first incidents between Football fans in Greece were recorded in June 1930, after the match between [[Aris Thessaloniki]] and [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] at Thessaloniki. While Panathinaikos fans where arriving at the port of [[Piraeus]] from [[Thessaloniki]], Olympiakos fans, who had not forgotten the big loss of their team (8–2) by [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] rioted with the green fans. 
The word "hooliganism" was recorded at the early '60s where Greek students in the UK who had experienced the phenomenon of hooliganism there first taught the term to the journalists who were unable to explain why the fans were fighting each other and gave this situation a name.
In 1962, after [[Panathinaikos F.C.]] and [[P.A.O.K. F.C.]] match incidents, newspapers wrote for the first time that hooligans (Χούλιγκανς) vandalized [[Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium]].
It was on 19 November 1966 that a big flag, at the 13th gate of [[Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium]] announced the arrival of a new group on the scene. [[Gate 13]] would be the first organized group that over the years became a part of the club by affecting club decisions and by following the club on all possible occasions.
[[P.A.O.K. F.C.]] fans made Gate 4 in 1978 and [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] fans create the Gate 7 in 1981.
In 1982, between Aris FC – Paok FC match incidents, Aris Dimitriadis was stabbed and later died in Thessaloniki's hospital. On 26 October 1986, at the Alkazar stadium of Larissa Charalambos Blionas was killed by a flare pistol thrown by the Paok fans. One month later anastasios Zontos was stabbed to death in Omonoia square in the center of Athens before the match [[AEK Athens F.C.]] &amp; [[P.A.O.K. F.C.]]. In January 1991, before the derby of Aek F.C. and Olympiakos F.C., George Panagiotou died in the incidents between hooligans outside Nea Filadelfia's stadium hit by flare pistol.
On 15 May 2005, in [[Thessaloniki]] derby [[Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C.|Iraklis]]-[[Aris F.C. (Thessaloniki)|Aris F.C.]], Aris' hooligans called ''Ierolohites'' invaded the pitch when the score was 2–1 for Iraklis. A football player Tasos Katsambis was injured during the clashes. The match was halted and [[Aris F.C. (Thessaloniki)|Aris]] was punished with a 4-point deduction which led to their relegation to the [[Second Division (Greece)|Second Division]].
In April 2007, all sports stadiums were closed down in [[Greece]] for two weeks following the death of a fan in a pre-arranged fight between hooligans in [[Athens]] on 29 March. The fight involved 500 fans of rival [[Super League Greece]] clubs [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]], which is based in Athens, and [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], which is based in nearby [[Piraeus]]. The [[Politics of Greece|Greek government]] immediately suspended all team sports in Greece and severed the ties between teams and their supporters' organizations.&lt;ref name="Tribune001"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Kitsantonis | first = Niki | title = Soccer: Greece wrestles with fan violence| work=International Herald Tribune | date = 19 April 2007 | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/04/19/sports/GREEKS.php | accessdate = 2007-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Third Division (Greece)|Third Division]] match between [[Panetolikos]] and [[Ilioupoli GS|Ilioupoli]] was stopped for thirty minutes when players and fans clashed following a Panetolikos disallowed goal.

On 18 April, rival fans clashed with each other and riot police in [[Ioannina]] during and after a [[Greek football Cup|Greek Cup]] semi-final match between local rivals [[PAS Giannena]] and [[AEL 1964|Larissa]]. There was trouble during the game in which Larissa won 2–0. Fans set fire to [[Waste container|rubbish bins]] and smashed shop windows, while police tried to disperse them by firing tear gas.&lt;ref name="Tribune001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="novasports.gr" /&gt;

On 10 October 2009, a group of about 30 hooligans disrupted an "Under 17" match between local rivals PAOK and [[Aris Thessaloniki]]. Among the injured were a group of Aris Thessaloniki players and their coach, a veteran PAOK player and another official. On 7 October 2011, a group of Greek supporters firebombed the away section of a Euro 2012 qualifying match against Croatia in Athens.
On 18 March 2012, during the match for the Super League Greek Championship in Athens Olympic Stadium between Panathinaikos and Olympiakos, home team Panathinaikos's fans who were inside the stadium attacked police forces with Molotov bombs, causing extended damages to the stadium, while police forces were unable to keep peace.

On 5 January 2014, in [[Aigaleo]], a suburb in [[Athens]], the local team [[Aigaleo FC]] was hosting [[AEK Athens]], a [[Third Division (Greece)|Third Division]] match. Before the match clashes broke up between [[AEK Athens|AEK]] and [[Aigaleo FC|Aigaleo]] fans. Indeed, the clashes resulted in the arrest of a security guard of the stadium who was accused of participating in the clashes among [[Aigaleo]] hooligans and also accused of committing attempted murder against an [[AEK Athens|AEK]] fan.

On 15 September 2014, in [[Nea Alikarnassos]], the team Herodotus&lt;ref&gt;[[:el:Π.Α.Σ.Α. Ηρόδοτος]]&lt;/ref&gt; was hosting [[Ethnikos Piraeus]] , a [[Third Division (Greece)|Third Division]] match. On 75' minute of the game, a clash between the supporters of the two clubs forced the referee to stop the match. During the clash, a 45-year-old supporter of Ethnikos Piraeus suffered a severe head injury and died two weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enikos.gr/sports/263130,Traymatismos_fila8loy_sto_Hrodotos-E8nik.html|title=Λιποθύμησε φίλαθλος στο Ηρόδοτος-Εθνικός|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contra.gr/Soccer/Hellas/pethane-o-traymatias-filathlos-toy-ethnikou.3053057.html|title=Πέθανε ο τραυματίας φίλαθλος του Εθνικού|date=29 September 2014|work=Contra.gr|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
The term ''[[wikt:ultrà|ultrà]]'' or ''[[wikt:ultras|ultras]]'' is used to describe hooligans in Italy.

In February 2001, [[A.S. Roma]] fans fought with police and [[Liverpool F.C.]] fans, and five English supporters were stabbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1172748.stm |title=Fans recover after Rome stabbings |publisher=BBC News |date=16 February 2001 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a weekend of violence in January 2007, the president of the [[Italian Football Federation]] (FIGC) threatened to halt all league football. An official of amateur club Sammartinese died when he was caught up in a fight between players and fans in [[Luzzi]], among numerous incidents of disorder in [[Florence]], [[Bergamo]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6314949.stm |title=Violence could halt Italian games |publisher=BBC News |date=30 January 2007 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2007 the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) suspended all football matches after Police Officer Filippo Raciti was killed at the match between [[Catania]] and [[Palermo]] when he was struck on his liver by a piece of

===Montenegro===
In a [[Euro 2016]] qualifying match in [[Podgorica]] on 27 March 2015, a few seconds in, a hooligan threw a flare at Russia goalkeeper [[Igor Akinfeev]] injuring him. The match was then temporarily suspended. Later fighting between the teams and more hooliganism rendered the game abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/32096292|title=Russia keeper Akinfeev hit by flare in abandoned Montenegro match|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
The earliest recorded case of hooliganism in the Netherlands occurred when [[Rotterdam]] club [[Feyenoord]] and English club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] met at the 1974 [[UEFA Cup]] Final, where Tottenham hooligans destroyed portions of the Feyenoord stadium tribunes. It was the first time the Netherlands encountered such destructive hooliganism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportgeschiedenis.nl/2007/01/12/feyenoord-en-de-voetbalrellen-van-1974.aspx |title=de alternatieve bron voor sportnieuws |publisher=Sportgeschiedenis.nl |date=26 April 1989 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Dutch clubs associated with hooliganism include [[PSV Eindhoven]], [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], [[FC Utrecht]], [[FC Groningen]], [[Twente Enschede]] and [[ADO Den Haag]].

The most violent rivalry is between Ajax and Feyenoord. A particularly serious incident was the so-called "[[Battle of Beverwijk]]" on 23 March 1997, in which several people were seriously injured and one killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =The battle that undermines Ajax's search for beautiful game |url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article1336946.ece | publisher =[[Times Online]]| date= 6 February 2007 | accessdate = 2007-05-26 | location=London | first=Rick | last=Broadbent}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002–03 season was marked by similar incidents, and also by fighting between fans of Ajax and FC Utrecht.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatica.com/actual/article.asp?channel_id=1&amp;story_id=54 |title=The rise of Dutch football hooliganism &lt; Dutch news &amp;#124; Expatica The Netherlands |publisher=Expatica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
{{further|Football hooliganism in Poland}}

One of the biggest riots occurred at a [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA – Group 2)|World Cup qualifying match]] between Poland and England on 29 May 1993 in [[Chorzów]].

Arranged football hooligan fights in Poland are known as ''[[wikt:ustawka|ustawki]]''; they became common in Poland since the late 90s. On 30 March 2003, [[Polish police]] arrested 120 people after rival football supporters fought during a match between [[Śląsk Wrocław]] and [[Arka Gdynia]].&lt;ref name="BBC2901451"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Man killed in Polish football riot | publisher = BBC News | date = 30 March 2003 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2901451.stm | accessdate = 2007-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Wrocław football riot 2003|riot]], [[hooliganism|hooligans]] pelted police officers with stones and fought a running battle with knives and axes. One victim was seriously injured and later died in hospital.

During the [[UEFA Cup 1998-99|1998–99 UEFA Cup]], a knife was thrown at Italian footballer [[Dino Baggio]], from [[Parma F.C.]] by Polish supporters (allegedly [[Wisła Kraków]] fans), injuring his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.igol.pl/article,3402.html |title=W krainie latających noży |publisher=Igol.pl |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430181126/http://www.igol.pl/article,3402.html |archive-date=30 April 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of [[Legia Warszawa]] also attracted negative attention after in Lithuania during the match against [[Vetra Vilnius]] on 10 July 2007.

The most notable hooligan incidents happened in [[Kraków]] where supporters of the [[Wisła Kraków]] and [[KS Cracovia]] teams have a rivalry that reportedly extended to killings of opposing fans.

Country-wide riots involving football fans were seen in [[Słupsk street riots 1998|1998 in Słupsk]] and [[Knurów riots 2015|2015 in Knurów]], both incidents sparked by a killing of a fan by the police.

===Republic Of Ireland===
Football Hooliganism was never an issue in Ireland up until the early 2000s and involved many pre match fights began to spawn in areas such as County Louth, Dublin and Derry. The behaviour of fans in these areas involved fights, racist chants and banners and many different pyrotechnic tools such as flares, smoke bombs and strobes. Often enough the away team and League of Ireland matches would be ganged up on by the home teams and attacked.
===Russia===

===Serbia===
The most prominent groups of hooligans are associated with [[Belgrade]] and [[Serbia]]'s two main clubs, [[Red Star Belgrade]] and [[FK Partizan|Partizan Belgrade]]. They are known as the ''[[Delije]]'' ("Heroes") and ''[[Grobari]]'' ("Gravediggers"), respectively. [[FK Rad]] is a less-successful Belgrade club, whose associated hooligans, known locally as "''United Force''", have notoriously been involved in many violent incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1123137,00.html |title=The Observer: Football, blood and war |publisher=Observer.guardian.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-03-24 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December 2007, a plainclothes police officer was seriously injured when he was attacked during a [[Serbian Superliga]] match between [[Red Star Belgrade]] and [[FK Hajduk Kula|Hajduk Kula]].&lt;ref&gt;The officer was attacked with burning flares and broken seats and he had to fire warning shots in the air in self-defence.

===Spain===
Football [[hooliganism]] in Spain arises from three main sources. The first is racism, as some [[black people|black]] players have been victims of [[list of ethnic slurs|ethnic slurs]]. [[Samuel Eto'o]], a former [[FC Barcelona]] player from [[Cameroon]], has denounced the problem.

The second source is the strong [[Major football rivalries|rivalry]] between [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. After transferring from Barcelona to Real Madrid, [[Luís Figo]]'s appearance in Barcelona's [[Camp Nou|Nou Camp]] Stadium triggered a strong reaction. The crowd threw bottles, mobile phones and other things (including a pig's head). Although nobody was injured the match was followed by a large discussion on fan violence in the Spanish [[La Liga|Primera División]].

Hooliganism is also rooted in deep political divisions arising from the [[General Franco]] fascist regime days (some [[Real Madrid]], [[Atlético Madrid]], [[Espanyol]], [[Real Betis Balompie]] or [[Valencia CF]] ultras are linked to franquista groups), the communist ones, (such as [[Deportivo de La Coruña|Deportivo La Coruña]], [[Athletic Club Bilbao]], [[Sevilla FC]], [[Celta de Vigo]], [[Rayo Vallecano]]) and the independentist movements in [[Catalonia]] (like [[FC Barcelona]]), [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] region. In Spain, organized hooligan groups are popularly called ''grupos ultra''. Three notorious ones are the [[Boixos Nois]], the Frente Atlético and the Ultras Sur, supporter groups of FC Barcelona, Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid respectively.

In 1991, [[Frederiq Roiquier]], a French supporter of [[Espanyol de Barcelona]] was killed by [[FC Barcelona]] hooligans which mistook him for an Espanyol hooligan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1991/01/30/deportes/665190001_850215.html |title=Un 'ultra' azulgrana afirma que la muerte de un joven francés fue rigurosamente planeada &amp;#124; Edición impresa &amp;#124; EL PAÍS |publisher=Elpais.com |date=30 January 1991 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 a 13-year-old child died in [[Espanyol]] stadium before a flare impact in his thorax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-65085 |title=MURIÓ UN NIÑO POR BENGALA EN ESPAÑA – Archivo – Archivo Digital de Noticias de Colombia y el Mundo desde 1.990 |publisher=eltiempo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Aitor Zabaleta, a supporter of [[Real Sociedad]] was killed by an [[Atlético Madrid]] hooligan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/247076/l/ |title=El Tribunal Supremo confirma la pena por desórdenes contra Ricardo Guerra y otros miembros del grupo ultra Bastión |trans-title=The Supreme Court confirmed the sentence for disorderly conduct against Ricardo Guerra and other group members ultra Bastión |language=Spanish |publisher=20 Minutos |date=13 June 2007 |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was linked to a neo-Nazi group (Bastión), just before a match between these two teams. In 2003, a supporter of [[Deportivo de La Coruña|Deportivo La Coruña]] was killed in riots by Deportivo hooligans, when he tried to protect a supporter of the opposing team, [[SD Compostela]]. Since then, authorities have made attempts to bring hooliganism more under control. In 2007, there were acts of hooliganism before a match between Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid, with several cars being destroyed and policemen injured by flares and bottles which were thrown at them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =Vandal incidents in Madrid|url =http://www.elcomerciodigital.com/prensa/20070225/deportes/vandalismo-frente-atletico_20070225.html | publisher =[[El Correo Digital]]| date= 24 February 2007| accessdate = 2007-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many black foreign players have been racially abused, such as at a 2004 friendly match between Spain and England, in which black England players such as [[Shaun Wright-Phillips]] and [[Ashley Cole]] endured [[monkey chants]] from Spain supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/monkey-chants-force-clampdown-on-spains-racist-football-fans-525020.html |title='Monkey chants' force clampdown on Spain's racist football fans – Europe, World |publisher=The Independent |date=29 January 2006 |accessdate=2010-03-24 | location=London | first=Graham | last=Keeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also have been local disputes between rival teams, for example between [[Cádiz Club de Fútbol]] and [[Xerez CD]], [[Real Betis Balompie]] and [[Sevilla FC]] or [[Deportivo de La Coruña]] and [[Celta de Vigo]].

Hooligan violence in Spain decreased since the late '90s due to an alcohol ban in sporting events as well as hooligan laws which attempt fines up to 600,000 euros and bans of two years without access to stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csd.gob.es/csd/informacion/legislacion-basica/ley-del-deporte |title=Ley del Deporte – Portal del Consejo Superior de Deportes |language=es |publisher=Csd.gob.es |date=1 January 2000 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003 [[FC Barcelona]] hooligans, the [[Boixos Nois]] are not allowed to enter in [[Camp Nou]].

In 2012 a [[Rayo Vallecano]] Hooligan was arrested during riots in 14-November general strike and accused of terrorism.

In 2014, debate about eradicating Spanish hooligans arose after Frente Atlético members murdered a Riazor Blues member, [[Deportivo La Coruña]] radicals; and after members of the [[Boixos Nois]] stabbed two [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|PSG]] supporters in Barcelona.

In 2016, Football-related violence came once again to the public debate after a Fight between [[Sevilla FC]] and [[Juventus FC]] Supporters that occurred the day before their [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage match. 2 Juventus supporters were stabbed (one of them was seriously injured but survived after being hospitalized) and a Sevilla supporter was hospitalized with head wounds caused by a glass bottle.

===Sweden===
Hooliganism began in Sweden at the turn of the 20th century as fans of [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]], [[Hammarby IF|Hammarby]] and [[Djurgårdens IF Fotboll|Djurgården]] have been reported fighting after derbies in [[Stockholm]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Modern hooliganism began in 1970 when fans of [[IFK Göteborg]] invaded the pitch, destroyed the goalposts and fought the police at the end of a match that relegated Göteborg from the [[Allsvenskan]], although Hooliganism in Sweden became a growing problem in the 1980s, but [[pitch invasion]]s and violence at football grounds decreased in the late 1990s; when hooligan firms started pre-arranging their fights away from the grounds and the regular supporters. Seven clubs that have large organised hooligans firms are [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]] (Firman Boys), [[IFK Göteborg]] (Wisemen) [[Djurgårdens IF Fotboll|Djurgårdens IF]] (DFG) [[Hammarby IF]] (KGB) [[Malmö FF]] (True Rockers) [[GAIS]] (Gärningsmännen) and [[Helsingborgs IF]] (Frontline). But several other football, bandy and ice hockey clubs have active hooligan followings.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite news| title =First Swedish football death |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/not_in_website/syndication/monitoring/media_reports/2169007.stm | publisher =BBC News| date= 2 August 2002 | accessdate = 2007-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2002, 12 members of the Wisemen stood trial for inflicting life-threatening injuries on a [[Hammarby IF|Hammarby]] fan in 2001.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

In August 2002, [[Tony Deogan]], a member of the Wisemen, was killed after a pre-arranged fight against Firman Boys.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; A second fatality occurred in March 2014, when a 43-year-old [[Djurgårdens IF Fotboll|Djurgården]] supporter was killed in [[Helsingborg]] in an assault on his way to Djurgården's opening match in the [[2014 Allsvenskan]] against [[Helsingborgs IF|Helsingborg]].

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, hooligan incidents are rare due to the fact that the stadiums are small and teams are little.

One incident, dubbed the [[2006 Basel Hooligan Incident]], 13 May 2006, occurred on the last day of the 2005–06 season, when [[FC Zürich]] defeated [[FC Basel]] at [[St. Jakob Park]] to win the Swiss championship with a last-minute goal. After the final whistle, angry Basel hooligans stormed the field and attacked Zürich players. The Zürich team were forced to celebrate in the upper deck of the stands while the fighting continued. There was similar fighting in the streets that night.&lt;ref name="nzz.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzz.ch/2006/11/23/eng/article7274780.html |accessdate=6 December 2006 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nzz.ch"/&gt;

===Turkey===

According to the ''[[Turkish Daily News]]'', hooligan groups are well organised, have their own "leaders", and often consist of organised [[street fighting|street fighters]]. These groups have a "racon" (code of conduct), which states that the intention must be to [[injury|injure]] rather than [[murder|kill]] and that a stab must be made below the waist.&lt;ref name="fatalmistakes"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Chain of Fatal Mistakes | url = http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/h.php?news=chain-of-fatal-mistakes-2000-04-16 | publisher = [[Turkish Daily News]]| date = 16 April 2000| accessdate = 2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other hooligans have fired firearms into the air to celebrate their team's victory, which has been known to accidentally kill innocent people watching the celebrations on their balconies.&lt;ref name="passionofturks"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Passion of Turkish fans| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/704374.stm| publisher = BBC News| date = 6 April 2000| accessdate = 2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="givingperspective"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Giving perspective to football violence| url = http://www.soccernet.com/euro2000/columns/20000521featmike.html| publisher = [[Soccernet]]| date = 20 May 2000| accessdate = 2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trouble has arisen during matches between Istanbul rivals Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe.&lt;ref name="passionofturks" /&gt; However, the [[Turkish Football Federation]] has tightened security to try and contain the hooliganism. During the 2005 [[Turkish Football Cup|Turkish cup final]] between [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]] and [[Fenerbahçe S.K.|Fenerbahçe]], 8,000 police, [[Football steward|stewards]] and officials were employed to prevent violence.&lt;ref name="istanbulready"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Istanbul ready to host final| url = http://www.newagebd.com/2005/may/15/spt.html| publisher = New Age Sports| location = Bangladesh| date = 15 May 2005| accessdate = 2006-10-06| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061028021547/http://www.newagebd.com/2005/may/15/spt.html| archivedate = 28 October 2006| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Turkish Football Federation introduced new measures to combat the threat of hooliganism and have made new regulations that allow the Professional Football Disciplinary Board to fine clubs up to YTL 250,000 for their fans behavior.

[[2000 UEFA Cup Final riots|Violence]] also occurred between [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] fans (mainly from [[The Herd (hooligan firm)|The Herd]]) and Galatasaray fans before the [[UEFA Cup 1999-00#Final|2000 UEFA Cup final]] in Copenhagen&lt;ref name="arsenalfear"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Arsenal fans fear more violence| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/752001.stm| publisher = BBC News| date = 17 May 2000| accessdate = 2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which a Galatasaray fan, an Arsenal fan and a Dane were said to have been stabbed.&lt;ref name="threemorestabbed"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Three more stabbed in Copenhagen| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/752001.stm| publisher = BBC News| date = 18 May 2000| accessdate = 2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galatasaray later won the match after a penalty shoot-out.

On 24 May 2001, 50 people were injured when fighting broke out at a match between French club PSG and Galatasaray at the Parc des Princes stadium.[16][17]PSG were initially given a record $571,000 fine, but it was reduced on appeal to $114,000. Galatasaray was initially fined $114,000 by UEFA, but it too was eventually reduced to $28,500.[18] In May 2001, six PSG fans from the Supporters Club, were arrested and charged with assault, carrying weapons, throwing items on the pitch and racism. The six were alleged to have deliberately entered a part of the Parc des Princes stadium where French fans of Turkish origin were standing, in order to attack them. The six were banned from all football stadiums for the duration of their trial.

On 3 June 2011, after the Belgium vs. Turkey match, several riots occurred in the city center of Ghent after a 1–1 draw. 30 people were injured.

The 1967 Kayseri Atatürk Stadium Disaster was the worst hooliganism event that has ever happened in Turkey. It resulted in 40 deaths and some 600 were injured. The violence started following provocation of the Kayserispor fans in the half time, whose team went to leading by a goal scored in the first half.Supporters of the two teams threw rocks to each other.Some of the hooligans were also armed with bats and knives.The fleeing crowd caused a stampede in front of the stand exits.The events in the stadium were followed by vandalism in Kayseri and many-days lasting riots in Sivas. Hooliganism is also an issue in other sports like Basketball and Volleyball in Turkey.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|Football hooliganism in the United Kingdom}}

There are records of football hooliganism in the UK from the 1880s, and from no later than the 1960s the UK had a worldwide reputation for it&amp;nbsp;– the phenomenon was often dubbed the ''English Disease''.&lt;ref name="LiverpoolUni"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/footballindustry/hooligan.html | title=FIG FACT-SHEET FOUR: HOOLIGANISM | accessdate=20 March 2011 | publisher=Football Industry Group, University of Liverpool}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title='Football Hooliganism: Policing the War on the English Disease' | author=Stott, Clifford | year=2007 | publisher=Pennant Books | isbn=978-1-906015-05-3 | author2=Pearson, Geoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EnglishDiseaseBBC"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6532989.stm | title=The return of the English disease? | accessdate=20 March 2011 | date=6 April 2007 | publisher=BBC | first=Mario | last=Cacciottolo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IndyEnglishDisease"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/leading-articles/another-sorry-outbreak-of-the-english-disease-730590.html | title=Another sorry outbreak of the English disease | accessdate=20 March 2011 | date=17 June 2004 | publisher=The Independent on Sunday | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s, many organised hooligan firms sprang up, with most [[Football League]] clubs having at least one known organised hooligan element. Hooliganism was often as its worst when local rivals played each other. Supporters of teams including [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], [[Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Portsmouth F.C|Portsmouth]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], [[Leicester City]] and 
[[Bristol City]] were among those most frequently linked to hooliganism.

Racism became a major factor in hooliganism around the same time, as black players became a regular feature in English league teams from the 1970s. Black players were frequently targeted with monkey chants, and had bananas thrown at them. Members of far-right groups including the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]] also sprayed racist slogans and distributed racist literature at matches.

[[Sectarian]] violence has long been a regular factor of crowd violence, as well as offensive chanting, at matches in [[Scotland]] between [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].

As a result of the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] at [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], in [[1985 European Cup Final|1985]], where Liverpool FC fans rioting led to the death of 39 [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] fans, English clubs were banned from all European competitions until 1990, with Liverpool (the English team present) banned for an additional year.&lt;ref name="hillsboroughjustice"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Michael Moore's Bowling For Columbine and the Hillsborough Justice Campaign | url = http://www.contrast.org/hillsborough/bowling.shtm | publisher = Hillsborough Justice Campaign | accessdate = 2006-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Manchester United hooligan Colin Blaney in his autobiography 'The Undesirables', many of the football hooligan gangs in the UK used hooliganism as a cover for acquisitive forms of crime, specifically theft and burglary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Colin |last=Blaney |title=Undesirables |year=2014 |publisher=John Blake |isbn=978-1782198970 |pages=1–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has also been confirmed in numerous other articles on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Chester |title=Getting Life Lessons From Manchester's Jet-Setting Career Thieves |publisher=Vice Media |date=31 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=J. |last=Sugden |title=Inside the Grafters' Game: An Ethnographic Examination of Football's Underground Economy |publisher=Journal of Sport and Social Issues |date=January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s and well into the 1990s the UK government led a major crackdown on football-related violence. While football hooliganism has been a growing concern in some other European countries in recent years, British football fans now tend to have a better reputation abroad. Although reports of British football hooliganism still surface, the instances now tend to occur at pre-arranged locations including pubs rather than at the matches themselves.

English clubs who have made the headlines for the worst and most frequent cases of hooliganism include Birmingham City (whose multi racial hooligan element gained the nickname "Zulus" from fans of rival teams in the 1970s when football hooligans were almost always white British), Chelsea (whose then chairman [[Ken Bates]] installed an electric fence at the club's stadium in the mid 1980s to combat hooligans, but was refused permission to switch it on during matches), Leeds United (who were banned from European competitions following a riot after the 1975 European Cup final against Bayern München), Liverpool (14 of whose fans were convicted after a riot at the 1985 European Cup final resulted in the deaths of 39 spectators at Heysel Stadium in [[Belgium]] when a stadium wall collapsed, leading to English clubs being banned from European competitions for 5 years), Manchester United (who were booted out of the European Cup Winner's Cup in 1977 after their fans rioted at a game in France, although they were reinstated to the competition on appeal), Millwall (whose most notorious hooliganism incident was in 1985 when their fans rioted in an FA Cup tie at [[Luton]]), Tottenham Hotspur who gained notoriety for the 1974 UEFA Cup Final disturbances and again in Rotterdam in 1983 (who had a section of fans banned from all football grounds in England in 2008 for their racial and homophobic abuse of former player [[Sol Campbell]]) and Wolves (who had dozens of fans convicted of incidents in the late 1980s involving the [[Subway Army]] hooligan firm at matches against teams including Cardiff City and Scarborough when they were in the Fourth Division).

=== Ukraine ===
Football [[hooliganism]] movement in [[Ukraine]] started in the 1980s. The first big fight (more than 800 people) involving football hooligans was registered in September 1987 between [[Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]] fans in the center of [[Kiev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rusplt.ru/society/okolofutbol-evromaydan-7827.html|title=Родом из советского околофутбола|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1990s passed in relative silence, as there were no big fights between hooligans. The origin of the football hooligan movement in Ukraine started in the mid-90s. On September 5, 1998 an important game between [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] and [[Russia national football team|Russia]]'s national football teams was played. Ukrainian hooligans began to unite in "National crews" to resist Russian fans. However, the mass union did not take place due to police intervention and were mainly composed of Ukrainian fans from [[Kiev]] and [[Dnipropetrovsk]]. In March 2001, several crews united and attacked 80 [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] fans after match between [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] and [[Belarus national football team|Belarus national football]] teams.

====1920s====
The first murder related with Argentine football occurred on 21 September 1922 in [[Rosario]], during the second half of a match between [[Tiro Federal|Tiro Federal Argentino]] (in its stadium) and [[Newell's Old Boys]] for the Copa Estímulo of the local first division, in a discussion between two fans. Enrique Battcock, a railroad worker and supporter of the home club (also former footballer and former member of the club's directing) was interpellated for Francisco Campá (Newell's Old Boys' supporter and member of the club's directing) for his behaviour, which carried a discussion that ended when Battcock hit in the face to Cambá, who retired from the stadium, returned after a little while, extracted a gun and shot him, causing Battcock's death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://salvemosalfutbol.org/lista-de-victimas-de-incidentes-de-violencia-en-el-futbol/ Victims list] Salvemos al Fútbol&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 November 1924 in [[Montevideo]] ([[Uruguay]]), occurred another murder where an Argentina fan was involved. After the final match of the [[1924 South American Championship|South American Championship]] of this year between Uruguay and Argentina (that Uruguay won), in the Colón Hotel (where the [[Argentine national football team]] was staying) broke out a fight among Uruguay supporters and Argentine fans and footballers, where José Lázaro Rodríguez (a recognized Argentine supporter of Boca Juniors and the national team) shot to Pedro Demby, an Uruguayan fan that died consequently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pelotaafuera.blogspot.com/2009/11/85-anos-de-la-muerte-de-pedro-demby.html To 85 years of the death of Pedro Demby] Pelota Afuera&lt;/ref&gt;

====1930s====
On 14 May 1939 at the stadium of [[Club Atlético Lanús|Lanús]] (in the city of [[Lanús]], in the [[Greater Buenos Aires]]), in a match of the minor divisions of the local team and Boca Juniors (previous to the match of the main teams of both clubs), after a foul committed by a player of Lanús, both teams began to fight. Seeing this, Boca Juniors fans wanted to tear down the fence and invade the pitch, prompting the police to fire shots to disperse them. But a police officer named Luis Estrella shot into the stands, killing two spectators: Luis López and Oscar Munitoli (a 9-year old).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=920643 An undesirable list who grow...] La Nación&lt;/ref&gt;

====1940s====
But this violence was not only among fans, footballers or the police, but also against the referees. On 27 October 1946, during a match between Newell's Old Boys and [[San Lorenzo de Almagro]] at Newell's Old Boys stadium (in the city of [[Rosario]]), local fans tried to strangle the referee Osvaldo Cossio. The match was tied on two goals when Cossio annulled a goal of the premises, and the third goal of San Lorenzo de Almagro in the next play worsened the situation. 89 minutes into the game, several Newell's Old Boys fans entered the pitch, hit the umpire and tried to hang him with his own belt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacapital.com.ar/contenidos/2010/03/17/noticia_0049.html The shortest match of the history] La Capital&lt;/ref&gt;

====1950s====
Although in [[Football in Argentina|Argentine football]] violence was already present from the beginning (late 19th century), the organized groups ([[Barra brava|barras bravas]]) appeared in the 1950s (barras bravas of [[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]], [[San Lorenzo de Almagro]], [[Club Atlético Lanús|Lanús]], [[Rosario Central]], [[Club Atlético Vélez Sarsfield|Vélez Sarsfield]], Racing, etc.) and 1960s (barras bravas of [[Club Atlético Belgrano|Belgrano]], Boca Juniors, River Plate, etc.), and continued to grow in the coming decades. With the time, every big and small football club in Argentina started to have its own corresponding barra brava, and all are violent or prepared for violence. In Argentina there are the most dangerous organized supporter groups in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,2816440_page_1,00.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=24 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202124431/http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,2816440_page_1,00.html |archive-date=2 February 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the most powerful of them are the barras bravas of [[Club Atletico Independiente|Independiente]] ([[La barra del Rojo|La Barra Del Rojo]]), [[Club Atlético Boca Juniors|Boca Juniors]] and [[Newell's Old Boys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/especiales/violenciaenelfutbol/nota1/d-07701.htm |title=Clarín digital &amp;#124; Deportes. River: la barra más temida |publisher=Edant.clarin.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But this phenomenon suffered a major transformation in the late 1950s. The journalist Amílcar Romero sets 1958 as the beginning of the current barras bravas (although some had already existed since some years), with the random murder by the police of Mario Alberto Linker (a Boca Juniors supporter -not identified as such- that circumstantially was watching a match between [[Club Atlético Vélez Sársfield|Vélez Sársfield]] and River Plate at the [[Estadio José Amalfitani|José Amalfitani]] stadium), that was located in the grandstand of River Plate fans when some of them started a fight and the police burst throwing tear gas grenades, one of which hit to Linker in the chest, causing his death. Because of this murder in October 1958, the society notes the existence of this organized groups (the barras bravas). The so-called "industrialization of football" was the kickoff for this organization, because needed to control all aspects involved in the game. Before the emergence of these groups, when a team played as a visitor, was pressured by rival fans. This prompted the organization of the barras bravas in response to that pressure:

{{quote|In Argentine football, it was well established that if you played as the visiting team, you were inexorably in a tight spot. Although they were not barras bravas as we know them today, local fans would pressure you, and the police, when not looking the other way, would pressure you as well. That had to be offset by a doctrine that in the next decade became common currency: the only means by which to neutralize any effectual group with a reputation and capacity for violence, is with another, closer-knit group with as great, or greater, reputation for violence.|source=&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/deportes/8-22673-2003-07-13.html The barras appear with the industrialization of the football] Página/12&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=Amílcar Romero}}

In this way, each club began having his barra brava, which was funded by the leaders of the institution. These groups were given their tickets and paid trips to the stadium, adding later other forms of financing. But the access to these "benefits" by the barra brava depended of the hierarchy inside her. For the barra brava to be prestigious, it had to be violent, so they began to increase the number of dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/especiales/violenciaenelfutbol/nota2/r-02401d.htm The origins of an evil without remedy] Clarín, especial "Violencia en el fútbol"&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Linker, in Argentine football began a phase marked by "habituation" to the violence of the barras bravas, and an increase in the number of deaths. According to Amílcar Romero, between 1958 and 1985, 103 deaths related to football violence took place in Argentina, that is, an average of one every three months. However, it also clarifies that the origin of such deaths is not always confrontation in the stadium, and range from the premeditated clash between barras bravas outside the sporting venues, police repression against disorder, infighting in a barra brava or "accidents", its analysis tends to show some kind of negligence or violation of safety standards.

====1960s====
In 1964 more than 300 football fans died and another 500 were injured in [[Lima]] ([[Peru]]) in a riot during an Olympic qualifying match between Argentina and Perú on 24 May.&lt;ref name="Disasters in soccer stadiums"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/africa/05/09/soccer.chronology |title=Disasters in soccer stadiums |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=10 May 2001 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 April 1967 in Argentina, before a match between [[Club Atlético Huracán|Huracán]] and Racing de Avellaneda, a Racing fan of 15 years died murdered by the Huracán barra brava&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efdeportes.com/efd8/amilc83.htm The Souto case] EF Deportes&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Estadio Tomás Adolfo Ducó|Tomás Adolfo Ducó]] stadium.

====1980s====
From the 1980s and onwards, the nuclei of the biggest barras bravas began to attend the matches of the Argentina national football team in the [[FIFA World Cup]]s. That caused fights against supporters of other countries (sometimes were hooligans or [[ultras]]) and between the Argentine barras bravas themselves. Also, in the 1980s and the 1990s were recorded the highest levels of violence in the history of the Argentine football, and there was a new phenomenon: the internal fragmentation of the barras bravas. It was produced by the emergence of sub-groups with their own names inside the barras bravas. Sometimes these sub-groups fought among themselves to have the power within the barra brava to which they belonged.

An example of the violence of this years was the Roberto Basile's death. Before the start of a match between Boca Juniors and Racing in 1983 in the ''[[Estadio Alberto J. Armando|Bombonera]]'' stadium, this Racing supporter died after being pierced in the neck by a flare thrown from the Boca Juniors stand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la-redo.net/la-bengala-perdida-15486/ The lost flare] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528143424/http://www.la-redo.net/la-bengala-perdida-15486/ |date=28 May 2010 }} La Redo&lt;/ref&gt;

====1990s====
In 1997 a member of La Guardia Imperial (barra brava of [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing de Avellaneda]]) was murdered by an Independiente supporter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/1997/10/08/e-05701d.htm Barrabrava jailed for the murder of another supporter] Clarín&lt;/ref&gt;

====2000s====
In 2001, other supporter of Racing was killed, and the barra brava of Independiente was the main suspect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2002/02/19/d-03401.htm Nobody is taking responsibility and today are football in Racing again] Clarín&lt;/ref&gt; Independiente and Racing (both from the city of [[Avellaneda]], in the [[Greater Buenos Aires]]) have a huge rivalry (they form the [[Avellaneda Derby]]), the second most important in Argentina but maybe the fiercest (noteworthy that their stadiums are apart only for about 300 meters).

The next year, one fan was killed and 12 people injured, including six police officers when fans of [[Racing Club de Avellaneda]] and [[Club Atlético Independiente]] clashed in February 2002.

An Independiente fan was shot dead, and another fan was shot in the back and hospitalized when about 400 rival fans fought outside Racing Clubs [[Estadio Juan Domingo Perón]] in [[Avellaneda]] before the match. Between 70 and 80 people were arrested as a result. The match started late when Independiente fans threw a [[smoke bomb]] at Racing Club [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], Gustavo Campagnuolo. That same weekend, 30 people were arrested and 10 police officers injured when fighting broke out at a match between [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] and [[Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata]] in [[La Plata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1826408.stm |title=AMERICAS &amp;#124;Football fan killed in Argentina |publisher=BBC News |date=18 February 2002 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 investigation into football hooliganism in [[Argentina]] stated that football violence had become a national crisis, with about 40 people murdered at football matches in the preceding ten years. In the 2002 season, there had been five deaths and dozens of [[knife]] and [[shotgun]] casualties. At one point the season was suspended and there was widespread social disorder in the country. The first death in 2002 was at a match between fierce rivals [[Boca Juniors]] and [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]]. The match was abandoned and one Boca Juniors fan was shot dead. Boca Juniors, one of the largest clubs in Argentina, may have the largest barra brava element in the country (it is similar to the barras bravas of Independiente and River Plate), with their self-styled leader, Rafael Di Zeo, claiming in 2002 that they had over 2000 members (however there are doubts about the reliability of this information).&lt;ref&gt;The Boca group, known as La Doce (''The Twelfth'') has a long history of violence. In 2002 [[Diego Maradona]] was alleged to remain friends with the group's leaders, in spite of their reputation. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hooligans/2006647.stm Argentine hooligans revere Maradona]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004, while driving up to [[Rosario]] to watch their side play [[Rosario Central]], Los Borrachos del Tablón (River's Barra Bravas) confronted a bus of Newell's firm (one of the big rival firms) on Highway 9, in a battle that killed two Newell's fans. Up to this day, some members of Los Borrachos still face charges because of the deaths.

In 2005 a footballer, Carlos Azcurra, was shot and seriously wounded by a police officer, when rival fans rioted during a [[Primera B Nacional Argentina|Primera B Nacional]] match between local [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] rivals (but not a derby) [[San Martín de Mendoza]] and [[Godoy Cruz Antonio Tomba]].&lt;ref&gt;At half-time, fans had thrown rocks onto the pitch, and just before the end of the match, fans from both clubs invaded the pitch and started fighting. The players who had stayed on the pitch, including Ezcurra, tried to calm the fans, and he was shot when police tried to stop the fans by firing rubber bullets.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4238844.stm BBC NEWS | World | Americas |Argentine footballer shot in riot&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany, there was a confrontation&lt;ref&gt;[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2006/06/22/deportes/m-01501.htm Agited early morning] Clarín&lt;/ref&gt; between 6 members of the barra brava of Independiente and 16 members of the barras bravas of Boca Juniors and [[Defensa y Justicia]] (both were together) in the [[Czech Republic]] (the country where the three barras bravas were housed). As a result of the fight, a supporter of Boca Juniors had to be hospitalized.

In 2007, during the match of the promotion/relegation playoff of the [[2006–2007 in Argentine football|2006–2007 season]] between [[Club Atlético Nueva Chicago|Nueva Chicago]] and [[Club Atlético Tigre|Tigre]] (in the Nueva Chicago's stadium), broke out a fight between the barras bravas of both teams because, when a penalty was sanctionaty for Tigre (who was winning the match 2–1, a result that relegated to Nueva Chicago to the Second division) in the 92nd minute, the barra brava of Nueva Chicago invaded the pitch and ran on direction to the stand occupied by the supporters of Tigre to attack them. After this, were serious riots near the stadium (not only caused by the barras bravas, but also by ordinary people), and as a result of it, a fan of Tigre died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.26noticias.com.ar/locura-en-mataderos-matan-a-un-simpatizante-de-tigre-43236.html Madness in Mataderos: kill a supporter of Tigre] 26 Noticias&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
Fans in Brazil join in organized groups known as [[torcida organizada|torcidas organizadas]] ("organized supporters") often considered criminal organizations that differ in many aspects from European hooligans. They act as the main supporters of each club and often sell products and even tickets. They have up to 60,000 members and are often involved in criminal activities other than fights such as drug dealing and threats to players. These fans establish alliances with other "torcidas organizadas" as they are called such as the alliance between Torcida Mancha Azul ([[Avaí Futebol Clube]]), Força Jovem Vasco ([[CR Vasco da Gama]]), Galoucura ([[Atlético Mineiro]]) and Mancha Verde ([[SE Palmeiras]]), the alliance between Torcida Independente ([[São Paulo F.C.]]), Torcida Jovem ([[CR Flamengo]]), Máfia Azul ([[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube]]) and Leões da TUF ([[Fortaleza Esporte Clube]]) and some other alliances. The "torcidas organizadas" are usually bigger and more committed to the spectacle in the stadiums than the English hooligan fans&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but they often schedule fights against rival groups where many are injured and killed. Fans of local rivals TJP – Torcida Jovem Ponte Preta ([[Associação Atlética Ponte Preta]]) and TFI -Torcida Fúria Independente ([[Guarani Futebol Clube]]) clashed and rioted at a match in Campinas in 2002. Violence had been expected, and just before kick-off, fans started fighting. Police tried to intervene but were pelted by stones. As the fighting continued inside the stadium, a railing collapsed and numerous fans fell over 13&amp;nbsp;ft (four metres) into a pit between the stands and the pitch. Over 30 people were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2375033.stm |title=Brazil fans plummet into pit |publisher=BBC News |date=30 October 2002 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Porto Alegre]] on South Brazil, [[Grêmio]] and [[Internacional]] fans, have a different way to support their teams with too much beer, no samba, no T-shirt identification, these 2 firms in this big city results in a long history of tension and conflict.

===Uruguay===
Following a 5-0 victory against arch-rivals Nacional in April 2014, Peñarol have undertaken an increasingly violent and unhinged attitude in the Uruguayan Clasico. While losing a championship play-off match against Nacional in June 2015, Peñarol's fans started a riot that delayed the game by 15 minutes before it was called off. In March 2016, Pablo Montiel - a supporter of Nacional - was shot to death by Peñarol fans after walking in the same neighborhood as Peñarol's new stadium named "Campeon del Siglo" (named after an IFFHS award not recognized by FIFA, intended as a petty insult towards Nacional). Ignacio Ruglio, a board member of Peñarol who have openly spread lies about Nacional, was interrogated by police following the murder of Montiel. In November 2016, the Uruguayan Clasico was cancelled before kick-off after Peñarol's supporters started a riot at the Estadio Centenario - one supporter was arrested holding a pistol, intended to shoot down Nacional players from the Amsterdam tribune. After winning a Clasico for Peñarol in September 2017, team captain Cristian Rodriguez openly called for murdering Nacional fans while celebrating the victory.

===El Salvador===
The ''[[Football War]]'' (Spanish: ''La guerra del fútbol''), also known as the ''Soccer War'' or ''100 Hour War'', was a brief war fought by [[El Salvador]] and [[Honduras]] in 1969. It was caused by political conflicts between Hondurans and Salvadorans, namely issues concerning immigration from [[El Salvador]] to [[Honduras]]. These existing tensions between the two countries coincided with the inflamed rioting during the second [[CONCACAF|North American]] [[1970 FIFA World Cup (qualification)#CONCACAF Semifinal Round|qualifying round]] of the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]]. [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] and [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] met in the second [[CONCACAF|North American]] [[1970 FIFA World Cup (qualification)#CONCACAF Semifinal Round|qualifying round]] for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]]. There was fighting between fans at the first game in the Honduran capital of [[Tegucigalpa]] on 8 June 1969, which Honduras won 1–0. The second game, on 15 June 1969 in the Salvadoran capital of [[San Salvador]], which was won 3–0 by El Salvador, was followed by even greater violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wars and Peace Treaties, 1816–1991 |last=Goldstein |first=Erik |authorlink= |author2= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=978-0-203-97682-1 |pages=195–6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VjWnMm53xQ8C&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=football+war+honduras+el+salvador# |accessdate=4 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A play-off match took place in [[Mexico City]] on 26 June 1969. El Salvador won 3–2 after [[extra time]].

The war began on 14 July 1969, when the El Salvadoran military launched an attack against Honduras. The [[Organization of American States]] negotiated a cease-fire on the night of 18 July (hence "100 Hour War"), which took full effect on 20 July. El Salvadoran troops were withdrawn in early August. El Salvador dissolved all ties with Honduras, stating that "the government of Honduras has not taken any effective measures to punish these crimes which constitute genocide, nor has it given assurances of indemnification or reparations for the damages caused to Salvadorans".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Thomas P. ''The War of the Dispossessed: Honduras and El Salvador 1969''. p. 105 Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to border clashes between the two nations.

===Mexico===
Football hooliganism in [[Mexico]] appears to be low key, but there have been some incidents, such as small-scale fighting between fans of [[C.F. Monterrey|Monterrey]] and [[Monarcas Morelia|Morelia]] at a [[Primera División de México|Primera División]] match in [[Monterrey]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2992422.stm |title=Fatal Mexican football win |publisher=BBC News |date=15 June 2003 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1998, one man died and several people were injured when Mexico football fans rioted after [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] lost to [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the [[1998 World Cup|World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/123024.stm |title=One killed in Mexican World Cup riots |publisher=BBC News |date=30 June 1998 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, hundreds of riot police were brought in to restore order because fans were looting and rioting. Fans then clashed with the police, and many fans were injured or arrested.  In March 2014 dozens of Chivas supporters clashed with police during their derby with Atlas.  Several police were hospitalized.  As a result, Chivas banned all of their supporters for the Clasico against Club America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccerly.com/article/jonnyrico/chivas-bans-supporter-groups-for-el-clasico-after-violent-acts-in-gdl-derby|title=Chivas Place Indefinite Ban on Supporter Groups After Violent Acts in Derby|author=Jonny Rico  - jonnyrico|work=Soccerly|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2015 Gold Cup]], Mexican hooligans threw trash and drinks in separate games against [[Trinidad &amp; Tobago]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebiglead.com/2015/07/15/mexico-fans-throw-things-at-trinidad-and-tobago-player-during-corner-kick-in-extra-time/|title=Mexico Fans Throw Things at Trinidad and Tobago Player During Corner Kick in Extra Time|work=The Big Lead|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Panama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2015/7/22/9019485/mexico-fans-so-mad-at-panama-goal-they-shower-players-in-beer|title=Mexico fans so mad at Panama goal, they shower players in beer|author=Andrew_Jones|date=23 July 2015|publisher=Vox Media|work=SBNation.com|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
While soccer is traditionally viewed in the United States as a family-friendly event, played by children and supported by parents, some violence does still occur. For junior league soccer, parents can be overzealous and be begrudged over unrelated matters and fights between parents have been documented and reported with police being called and intervening. For major league soccer, on 20 July 2008, in a [[Exhibition game|friendly match]] between [[Major League Soccer]] side [[Columbus Crew]] and English [[Premier League]] club [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], in [[Columbus Crew Stadium|Columbus, Ohio]], a fight broke out between rival fans. Police estimated more than 100 people were involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first= | last= | author2= | title=Crew-West Ham United friendly marred by brawl between fans | date=19 July 2008 | publisher= | url =https://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2008-07-20-crew-west-ham-friendly_N.htm | work =[[USA Today]] | pages = | accessdate = 2008-07-21 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; An unruly encounter occurred between [[Toronto FC]] fans in 2009, upset from a loss in the [[Trillium Cup]], and [[Columbus Crew]] fans. One Toronto fan was tasered by Columbus police.

That same weekend, a riot was narrowly avoided at a packed [[Giants Stadium]] as members of the [[New York Red Bulls]] supporters club, [[Empire Supporters Club]] (ESC), and members of the [[New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority]] security force clashed over what the ESC claimed was unfair and repeated mistreatment. Clashes also took place in the parking area around the stadium after the game, involving already ejected-for-life North Jersey Firm (NJF) members, and the [[New Jersey State Police]] were called to quell the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Ives | last=Galarcep | author2= | title=More mistreatment for Red Bulls fans at Giants Stadium | date=21 July 2008 | publisher= | url =http://www.soccerbyives.net/soccer_by_ives/2008/07/red-bulls-to-bl.html | work =Soccer By Ives | pages = | accessdate = 2008-07-21 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were several arrests, mostly of known NJF hooligans. A rare moment of violence broke out in Seattle in March 2010 after a pre-season [[Portland Timbers]] win in Seattle, when three [[Seattle Sounders FC|Sounders]] fans attacked a Timbers fan, choking and dragging him with his team scarf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clarridge|first=Christine|title=Seattle soccer hooligans choke Timbers fan with scarf|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/theblotter/2011367604_seattle_soccer_hooligans_choke.html|publisher=Seattle Times|accessdate=12 May 2011|date=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 April 2013 in Portland, a [[Portland Timbers]] supporter was assaulted by a group of [[San Jose Earthquakes]] supporters.

On 10 August 2015, fans of [[New York Red Bulls]] and [[New York City FC]] clashed in a brawl outside a pub throwing trash and exchanging blows. On 23 May 2016, fans of both NYC FC and New York Red Bulls rioted outside Yankee Stadium in response to NYC FC's 7-0 defeat to the New York Red Bulls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wannabe-mls-hooligans-are-adopting-the-worst-of-soccer-culture_us_5743285ce4b0613b512ad621|title=Wannabe MLS Hooligans Are Adopting The Worst Of Soccer Culture|first=Justin|last=Block|date=23 May 2016|publisher=|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==

===Bangladesh===
Football hooliganism in Bangladesh does not appear to be a major problem. However, in August 2001, 100 people were injured when thousands of football fans rampaged at a [[Bangladesh Professional Football League|B-League]] match between [[Mohammedan Sporting Club (Bangladesh)|Mohammedan Sporting Club]] and Rahmatganj Sporting Club in the [[Bangabandhu National Stadium]], [[Dhaka]]. When the [[referee (association football)|referee]] disallowed a penalty, Mohammedan fans invaded the pitch, throwing stones at the police, who had to fire [[tear gas]] at the fans to try and restore order. Outside the stadium dozens of cars and buses were damaged and set on fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=CBC Sports |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2001/08/11/socceriot010811.html |title=At least 100 injured in Bangladeshi soccer riot |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=11 August 2001 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
Football hooliganism in China is often linked to accusations of corrupt refereeing, with Chinese football being plagued by allegations of match fixing in the early 2000s.&lt;ref name="BBC News1892421"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Chinese football fans riot over penalty |publisher=BBC News |date=25 March 2002 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1892421.stm|accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News2036050"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Chinese football fans go on rampage|publisher=BBC News |date=10 June 2002 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2036050.stm|accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a match in 2000 between [[Shaanxi Guoli F.C.|Shaanxi Guoli]] and [[Chengdu Blades F.C.|Chengdu Wuniu]] in [[Xi'an]], football fans clashed with police who used tear gas and [[water cannon]]s to disperse the crowd. Eight people were arrested but later released.&lt;ref name="BBC News841378"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Chinese football fans clash with police|publisher=BBC News |date=19 July 2000 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/841378.stm|accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2002 hundreds of football fans rioted at a match in Xi'an between Shaanxi Guoli and [[Qingdao Jonoon F.C.|Qingdao Yizhong]], as a result of fans' suspicions of match-fixing.

Two years earlier, following crowd trouble at a match also in Xi'an, the government demanded more action to stamp out football hooliganism.&lt;ref name="BBC News1892421"/&gt;

In June 2002, riots in [[Fuzhou]], Fujian had to be put down by heavily armed paramilitary police.  The disorder started when fans were unable to watch the [[2002 World Cup|World Cup]] match between [[China national football team|China]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at an outside broadcast.&lt;ref name="BBC News2036050"/&gt; On 4 July 2004 fans rioted in Beijing when [[China national football team|China]] lost the final of the [[AFC Asian Cup]] to [[Japan national football team|Japan]], 3–1.  Japanese flags were burned and a Japanese Embassy official's car vandalised.  Japanese fans had to be protected by the police, and bussed to safety.&lt;ref name="BBC News3541380"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Chinese riot after Japan victory|publisher=BBC News |date=7 August 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3541380.stm|accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News3582364"&gt;{{Cite news|title=China probes football violence|publisher=BBC News |date=24 August 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3582364.stm|accessdate=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rioting was attributed to ill-feeling toward Japan for atrocities committed before and during the Second World War.&lt;ref name="BBC News3541380"/&gt;

===Indonesia===
Between 1995 and 2018 there has been recorded 70 deaths in Indonesian soccer by the NGO Save Our Soccer (SOS).  According to SOS data, 21 deaths of the 70, have occurred at the hands of a mob.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Soccer a deadly game in Indonesia|publisher=The Jakarta Post |date=27 September 2018 |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/09/27/soccer-a-deadly-game-in-indonesia.html|accessdate=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
In [[India]], most of the documented football riots have primarily taken place in [[Kolkata]]. Everytime the [[Kolkata derby|Calcutta derby]] takes place between [[Mohun Bagan A.C.]] and [[East Bengal F.C.]], tensions arise. However, it has taken the form of escalating violence twice- notably, at [[Eden Gardens]] on 16 August 1980. 16 people lost their lives that day due to a stampede. Another incident took place on 9 December 2012 at the [[Salt Lake Stadium]]. Though nobody was killed, [[Syed Nabi]], a [[Mohun Bagan A.C.]] footballer, was injured by a brick thrown, according to the player, by [[Mohun Bagan A.C.]] supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eden Gardens]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiatvnews.com/sports/soccer/violence-mars-mohun-bagan-east-bengal-match--2492.html |title=Violence mars Mohun Bagan-East Bengal match |publisher=Indiatvnews.com |date=9 December 2012 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
In the 2000s, tensions surrounding the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] spilled over into sporadic riots between Jewish and Arab Israeli football fans. In December 2000 it was reported that every club in Israel was on a final warning following escalating violence and intimidation at matches.

A number of incidents have involved [[Beitar Jerusalem F.C.|Beitar Jerusalem]], including racist abuse against overseas players,&lt;ref name="sundayherald001224"&gt;{{cite news|title=200 Beitar Jerusalem – Israel |work=Sunday Herald |date=24 December 2000 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20001224/ai_n13953505 |accessdate=2007-05-20 |first=Natasha |last=Woods}}&lt;/ref&gt; anti-Arab chants, use of smoke bombs and fireworks, and rioting. Beitar has a hooligan firm, [[La Familia (Beitar supporters' group)|La Familia]], whose members consider Israeli Arabs to be their enemy. In November 2007 the Israel Football Association (IFA) ordered Beitar to play their game against the Arab club, Bnei Sakhnin behind closed doors after Beitar fans, led by La Familia, broke a minute's silence for former Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin and sang chants in praise of his assassin, Yigal Amir. After a pitch invasion led by La Familia on 13 April 2008, when Beitar were leading Maccabi Herzliya, 1–0, and about to win the Israeli Premier League, the match was abandoned and the points to their opponents. Beitar was docked two points and had to play its remaining home games behind closed doors.

===Jordan===
Football riots in Jordan are generally regarded as an expression of tension between the country's Palestinian ethnic group and those who regard themselves as ethnically Jordanian, the two groups being of roughly equal size.&lt;ref name="english.aljazeera.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/12/2010121020416452506.html |title=Rival Jordan football fans clash – Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, rioting broke out following a game between rival Amman clubs [[Al-Wehdat SC|Al-Wehdat]] and [[Al-Faisaly Club (Amman)|Al-Faisaly]] clubs. Some Al-Faisali fans threw bottles at Al-Wehdat players and their fans. About 250 people were injured, 243 of them Al-Wehdat fans, according to senior officials from the hospitals.&lt;ref name="english.aljazeera.net" /&gt; According to Al Jazeera, supporters of Al-Wehdat are generally of Palestinian origin, while Faisaly fans are of Jordanian origin. A similar riot occurred in 2009.&lt;ref name="english.aljazeera.net" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikileaks.adhelis.com/cable/2009/07/09AMMAN1689.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216172348/http://wikileaks.adhelis.com/cable/2009/07/09AMMAN1689.html |archivedate=16 December 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Myanmar===
Hooliganism at Myanmar's football matches is common. On 1 October 2011, FIFA announced that [[Myanmar national football team|Myanmar]] will be banned from the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC Second Round|2018 World Cup qualifiers]] after [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC Second Round|a home tie]] against [[Oman national football team|Oman]] had to be stopped when the crowd pelted the opposition with bottles and rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/sport/87010/myanmar-banned-from-2018-world-cup|title=Myanmar banned from 2018 World Cup|publisher=Radio NZ|date=1 October 2011|accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Since the formation of the [[A-League]] in 2004, and the fall of the [[National Soccer League]], football hooliganism has died off in competitions and incidents have become a one-off event during seasons.

The incident with most notoriety in Australia is the Pratten Park riot in 1985 where hundreds of fans stormed the pitch midway through a [[Sydney Olympic FC|Sydney Olympic]] v [[Hakoah Sydney City East FC|Sydney City]] match. In a match between [[Melbourne Heart FC|Melbourne Heart]] and [[Melbourne Victory FC|Melbourne Victory]] in February 2013, 17 plastic seats were destroyed and flares were firing off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2013/02/04/16/03/soccer-fans-destroy-vic-stadium-seats |title=Soccer fans destroy Vic stadium seats |publisher=News.ninemsn.com.au |date=4 February 2013 |accessdate=2013-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206232806/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2013/02/04/16/03/soccer-fans-destroy-vic-stadium-seats |archivedate=6 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a match between [[Sydney FC]] and Melbourne Victory in November 2013, one travelling Melbourne Victory fan was hospitalised with a stab wound by a sixteen-year-old civilian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/man-stabbed-police-arrest-teenager-after-aleague-soccer-match-in-sydney-20131110-2x9an.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Man stabbed, police arrest teenager after A-League soccer match in Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, a riot between Melbourne Victory and Western Sydney Wanderers broke out at a pub before the match later that day. 
At an international football friendly between [[Australia national association football team|Australia]] and [[Serbian national football team|Serbia]] in [[Melbourne]] in June 2011, fans lit flares both inside and outside the stadium, and in city streets. Banners supporting [[Ratko Mladić]], the Serbian military leader charged with war crimes by the [[International Court of Justice]], were displayed. A laser pointer was seen in use. A seat inside the stadium was deemed damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/sport/soccer/friendly-fire-arrests-as-flares-disrupt-soccer-international-20110608-1frjs.html|title=Friendly fire: arrests as flares disrupt soccer international|publisher=The Age | location=Melbourne|date=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/police-angry-after-fans-let-off-flares-during-australia-v-serbia-match/story-fn7x8me2-1226071403244|title=Police flag heftier penalties for fans lighting flares at the soccer|publisher=Herald Dun}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, Victoria Police said they were reluctant to cover Melbourne Victory games because of unacceptable behaviour by fans.

Although it is nothing like football hooliganism in Europe (or what it used to be), anti-social events occur somewhat rarely. A primary example would be the Bourke Street Brawl between Melbourne Victory and Western Sydney Wanderers fans, who gathered in numbers before a match in late 2013 and had a brawl in Melbourne, concerning many who are involved with football in Australia and authorities. There are small hooligan/casual groups in Australia, the most prominent being from the League's biggest fanbases, Melbourne Victory, Sydney FC and Western Sydney Wanderers though others exist within other supporter groups.

==Media portrayal==
Football hooliganism has been depicted in films such as ''[[I.D. (1995 film)|ID]]'', ''[[The Firm (1989 film)|The Firm]]'', ''[[Cass (2008 film)|Cass]]'', ''[[The Football Factory (film)|The Football Factory]]'', ''[[Green Street (film)|Green Street]]'', ''[[Rise of the Footsoldier]]'', ''[[Awaydays]]'', ''[[The Brothers Grimsby]]'' and ''[[Eurotrip]]''. There are also many books about hooliganism, such as ''[[The Football Factory (novel)|The Football Factory]]'' and ''[[Among the Thugs]]''. Some critics argue that these media representations glamorise violence and the hooligan lifestyle.

[[Image:Four continents.png|thumb|The classical four continents]]

Europeans in the 16th century divided the world into '''four continents''': [[Africa]], [[Americas|America]], [[Asia]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Nothing was known of [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], first sighted in the early seventeenth century, or  [[Antarctica]], first sighted in the nineteenth century.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of the four [[continents]] was seen to represent its quadrant of the world&amp;mdash;Europe in the north, Asia in the east, Africa in the south, and America in the west. This division fit the [[Renaissance]] sensibilities of the time, which also divided the world into four [[season]]s, four [[classical element]]s, four [[cardinal directions]], four classical [[virtues]], etc.

The '''four parts of the world'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ciappara|first=Frans|date=1998|url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/4672/1/4672_2141.PDF?UkUDh:CyT|title=Society and inquisition in Malta 1743-1798|publisher=Durhem E-Theses|location=[[Durham University]]|page=38|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''four corners of the world''' refers to the [[Americas]] (the "west"), [[Europe]] (the "north"), [[Asia]] (the "east"), and [[Africa]] (the "south"). 

==A three-cornered world==
[[File:Anaximander world map-en.svg|thumb|The ancient tripartite view of the world]]
Before the discovery of the [[New World]] a commonplace of classical and medieval geography had been the "three parts" in which, from Mediterranean and European perspectives, the world was divided: Europe, Asia and Africa. As [[Laurent de Premierfait]], the pre-eminent French translator of Latin literature in the early fifteenth century, informed his readers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Asia is one of the three parts of the world, which the authors divide in Asia, Africa and Europe. Asia extends towards the [[Orient]] as far as the rising sun (''"devers le [[Levant|souleil levant]]"''&lt;!--souliel in original: the spelling has been carefully proofread--&gt;), towards the south ("midi") it ends at the great sea, towards the occident it ends at [[Mare Nostrum|our sea]], and towards the north ("[[septentrional|septentrion]]") it ends in the [[Maeotian marshes]] and the river named ''[[Tanais|Thanaus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Asie est l'une des trois parties du monde que les auteurs divisent en Asie, Afrique et Europe. Asie se extend devers orient jusques a souleil&lt;!--souliel in original: the spelling has been carefully proofread--&gt; [[levant]], devers midi elle fine a la grant mer devers occident elle fine a notre mer, et devers septentrion elle fine aux paluz Meotides et au fleuve appellé Thanaus''; Laurent de Premierfait's expanded translation of [[Boccaccio]]'s ''[[De Casibus Virorum Illustrium]]'' (1409), quoted in Patricia M. Gathercole, "Laurent de Premierfait: The Translator of Boccaccio's De casibus virorum illustrium" ''The French Review'' '''27'''.4 (February 1954:245-252) p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:EuropaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|left|100px|''Europa:'' woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia'' 1603]]

==A fourth corner: the enlarged world==
For Laurent's French readers, Asia ended at "our sea", the [[Mediterranean]]; Europeans were only dimly aware of the [[Ural Mountains]], which divide Europe from Asia in the eyes of the modern geographer, and which represent the geological suture between two fragmentary continents, or [[craton]]s. Instead, the division between these continents in the European-centered picture was the [[Hellespont]], which neatly separated Europe from Asia. From the European perspective, into the [[Age of Discovery]], Asia began beyond the Hellespont with [[Asia Minor]], where the Roman province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] had lain, and stretched away to unimaginably exotic and distant places&amp;mdash; "the [[Orient]]".

In the sixteenth century [[Americas|America]] too was full of exotic promise: the "[[New World]]".&lt;ref&gt;This theme is extensively explored in Hugh Honour, ''The New Golden Land: European Images of America from the Discoveries to the Present'' (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1603, [[Cesare Ripa]] published a book of emblems for the use of artists and artisans who might be called upon to depict allegorical figures. He covered an astonishingly wide variety of fields, and his work was reprinted many times. It was still being brought up-to-date in the 18th century. The illustrations reveal fixed Eurocentric perceptions of the nature of the "four corners of the world." Ripa's ''Europe'' (''illustration, left'') is the land of abundance (cornucopia) of kings and the pope, whose crowns and the papal tiara lie at her feet, and of cities.
[[Image:AsiaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|right|100px|''Asia:'' woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia,'' 1603]]
''Africa'', by contrast (''illustration, below right'') wears the elephant headdress (worn by rulers depicted on Hellenistic [[Bactria]]n coins) and is accompanied by a lion, the scorpion of the desert sands and [[Cleopatra]]'s [[asp (reptile)|asps]]. ''Asia'' (''illustration, right''), the seat of Religion, carries a smoking [[censer]] as a camel takes its ease.
[[Image:AmericaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|left|100px|''America'', woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia'' 1603]]
And the iconic image of ''America'' (''illustration, below left'') shows a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] maiden in a feathered headdress, with [[bow (weapon)|bow]] and arrow. Perhaps she represents a fabled [[Amazons|Amazon]] from the river that already carried the name.

The American millionaire philanthropist [[James Hazen Hyde]], who inherited a majority share in [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States|Equitable Life Assurance Society]], formed a collection of allegorical prints illustrating the Four Continents that are now at the [[New-York Historical Society]]; Hyde's drawings and a supporting collection of sets of porcelain table ornaments and other decorative arts illustrating the Four Continents were shared by various [[New York City]] museums.
[[Image:AfricaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|right|100px|''Africa'': woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia'' 1603]]

The Renaissance associated one major river to each of the continents.
The Four Rivers theme appears for example in the [[Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi]] in the [[Piazza Navona]] in Rome.

With the confirmed discovery that [[Australia]] was an island continent, the theme of the "Four Continents" lost much of its drive, long before a sixth continent, [[Antarctica]], was discovered. The iconography survived as the '''Four Corners of the World''', however, generally in self-consciously classicizing contexts: for instance, in New York, in front of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] [[Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House]] (1907), four sculptural groups by [[Daniel Chester French]] symbolize the "Four Corners of the World."

'''The Gang of Barbarians''' ({{lang-fr|Gang des barbares}}) was a French criminal gang whose members were responsible for the kidnapping, torture and [[killing of Ilan Halimi]].

==Kidnappers and associates==
The crime was committed by a group of persons belonging to a [[gang]] calling themselves ''les barbares'' (The Barbarians). Many of them have criminal records and have been imprisoned.

During the investigation it appeared that key members of the group were probably implicated in at least 15 other cases of kidnapping or racketeering.&lt;ref name = "LF2"&gt;{{Cite news| url         = http://www.urgenceserrurierparis.fr| title       = La police cherche encore des membres du gang  | accessdate  = 2008-12-30| date        = February 27, 2006| newspaper   = [[Le Figaro]]| language    = fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Posing as members of the [[National Front for the Liberation of Corsica]] or members of the French division of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine|PFLP]], they threatened several high-ranking [[CEO]]s including Jérôme Clément, president of the European TV operator [[Arte]], [[Rony Brauman]], former president and co-founder of [[Médecins Sans Frontières]], and the CEO as well as another high-ranking member of a large company selling [[home appliance]]s. They sent threatening pictures of an unknown man dressed as a middle-eastern Arab in front of a picture of [[Osama Bin Laden]]. In another case, the owner of a large [[grocery store]] was directed to pay 100,000 euros.

In total, 27 individuals were under investigation and were subsequently put on trial. Among these:

* ''Youssouf Fofana'' (August 2, 1980), the self-proclaimed ''Brain of the Barbarians''. He was born in [[Paris]] to immigrants from [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and served time in prison for various crimes including [[armed robbery]], [[car theft]] and [[resisting arrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Steven Erlanger |date=July 11, 2009 |title=Man Sentenced to Life in Killing of Jew in France |newspaper=The New York Times |page=A8 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/11/world/europe/11france.html |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview he denied killing Halimi, but showed no remorse for his actions.&lt;ref name = "LF"&gt;{{Cite news

* ''Jean-Christophe Soumbou'', also known as ''Craps, Crim or Marc''. Fellow inmate of Fofana. Imprisoned for car theft with violence. Supplied the car with which Halimi was transported. He is also suspected of other kidnappings.
* ''Jean-Christophe Gavarin'', usually known as ''JC'' or by his nickname ''Zigo'', one of the individuals who tortured Halimi.&lt;ref name = "LeMonde" /&gt; He was a minor at the time of the crime. He had been expelled from school and had been involved with the law because of a theft and possession of cannabis. He has admitted to pushing a burning joint in the face of Halimi.
* ''Samir Aït Abdelmalek'', nicknamed ''Smiler'', who was the owner of the apartment and is considered the right-hand man of Fofana (he had known Fofana for more than ten years). Had been convicted for possession of drugs and car theft. He also furnished the acid used to burn Halimi.
* ''Jérémy Pastisson'' involved in a number of kidnapping cases, his car was used to transport Halimi.
* ''Tiffenn Gouret'', former girlfriend of Jean-Christophe Gavarin and friend of Arbabzadeh, supplied Fonfana with "bait". She is also suspected in other kidnappings.
* ''Sorour Arbabzadeh'' nicknamed ''Yalda'' (also known as "Emma"), a seventeen-year-old French-[[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] girl who acted as ''appât'' (bait, honeypot) to entrap Halimi.&lt;ref name = "TO-Yalda"&gt;{{cite news

* ''Yahia Touré Kaba'', nicknamed ''Yaks'', one of the jailers (''gaolers'').
* ''Fabrice Polygone'', one of the jailers (''gaolers'').
* ''Jérôme Ribeiro'', known as ''Coup de Tête ([[headbutt]])''. Although he had left the group, he was promised a lot of money. One of the jailers (''gaolers'').

Many others were implicated but their direct connection to the crime could not be proven.

===Similar assault===
{{Importance section|date=February 2014}}
On February 22, 2008, six members of a group calling themselves ''Barbarians'' assaulted 19-year-old Mathieu Roumi in the same Paris suburb of [[Bagneux, Hauts-de-Seine|Bagneux]] where Halimi was kidnapped. For two hours the attackers tortured the young man. One shoved cigarette butts into his mouth, another took issue with Roumi's Jewish origin (paternal), grabbed correction fluid and scrawled ''sale juif'' ("dirty Jew") and ''sale PD'' ("dirty faggot") on his forehead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=March 6, 2008 |url=http://www.rmc.fr/editorial/35560/la-victime-ange-ou-demon/ |title=La victime, ange ou démon? |language=fr |trans-title=The victim, angel or demon? |publisher=BMFTV |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the issue of his sexual orientation arose, one of them placed a condom on the tip of a stick and shoved it in Roumi's mouth. The six men proceeded to scream at him and threaten that he would die the way Halimi did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jewish teen tortured in French town where Ilan Halimi was killed |author=Daniel Ben Simon |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=March 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The men were all arrested.

== Kidnapping and investigation ==
The kidnapping seems to be motivated by a combination of [[antisemitism]] and a desire for money. Although the torture was largely directed at his genitals, there was no evidence of sexual assault or a sexual motive.

===Ransom===

The kidnappers originally thought Halimi was wealthy because he came from a Moroccan Jewish family, though he came from the same poor and working-class neighborhood on the outskirts of Paris as the kidnappers did.&lt;ref name = "NYT1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1004804.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3515340,00.html Philippe Ovadia, the head of the Jewish community living in the very same lower-class area as the place where Halimi was held captive.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to then Interior Minister [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], members of the gang confessed that they believed all Jews to be rich and it motivated them to target several Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2054882,00.html | work=The Times | location=London | title=Paris kidnap gang suspect arrested in Ivory Coast | first1=Philippe | last1=Naughton | date=February 23, 2006 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kidnappers demanded ransom, initially EUR 450,000, eventually decreasing to EUR 5,000. It has been claimed that the family of Halimi was told that if they could not raise the money, they should get it from the Jewish community.

In order to convince Halimi's parents their son had been kidnapped, the abductors sent a picture of the young man being threatened by a gun and holding a newspaper to prove the date and time.&lt;ref name="nysun.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nysun.com/foreign/tale-of-torture-and-murder-horrifies-the-whole/27948/ |title=Tale of Torture and Murder Horrifies the Whole of France |author=Michel Gurfinkiel |authorlink=Michel Gurfinkiel |newspaper=[[The New York Sun]] |date=February 22, 2006 |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police investigation===

The French police were heavily criticized because they initially believed that antisemitism was not a factor in the crime.&lt;ref name = "NYT1"&gt;{{cite news
| url         = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/23/international/europe/23paris.html

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Police have attributed to the banlieues' gang subculture a "poisonous mentality that designates Jews as enemies along with other 'outsiders,'" such as [[United States|Americans]], mainstream French, and [[Europe]]ans in general. "If they could have gotten their hands on a (non-Jewish) French cop in the same way, they probably would have done the same thing," a retired police chief opined.&lt;ref name = "LAT"&gt;{{cite news

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This may have hampered the original investigation. Antisemitism is an [[aggravating circumstance]] (''circonstance aggravante'') in a murder case in France.

Ruth Halimi, Ilan's mother, subsequently co-authored a book with Émilie Frèche titled ''24 jours: la vérité sur la mort d'Ilan Halimi'', released April 2009. In the book, Ruth claimed that French police never suspected her son's kidnappers would kill the 23-year-old after three weeks in captivity in 2006, partly because they would not face the antisemitic character of the crime (as reported in the French daily [[Le Figaro]]). Émilie Frèche stated that "by denying the anti-semitic character,&amp;nbsp;... [the police] did not figure out the profile of the gang." The book details how Ilan's parents were told to stay silent during the ordeal and were ordered not to seek aid in order to pay the ransom, nor show their son's photo to people who might have come forward with information about his whereabouts.&lt;ref name=blamespolice&gt;{{cite news |author=Devorah Lauter |url=http://jta.org/news/article/2009/04/02/1004194/murdered-teens-mother-blames-police |title=Murdered man's mother blames police |publisher=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] (JTA) |date=April 2, 2009 |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Elle (magazine)|''Elle'' Magazine]] on March 27, 2009, Ruth Halimi stated that "The police were completely off the mark. They thought they were dealing with classic bandits, but these people were beyond the norm." Halimi stated that she wrote the book to "alert public opinion to the danger of anti-semitism which has returned in other forms, so that a story like this can never happen again".&lt;ref name=blamespolice/&gt;

== Public interest and reaction ==

The case was widely reported on both in and outside France.

Six French associations called for a mass demonstration against racism and antisemitism in Paris on Sunday, February 26. Between 33,000 (as estimated by police) and 80,000 to 200,000 (as estimated by the organizers) people participated in Paris, as well as thousands around the country. Present were public figures such as [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]], [[François Hollande]], [[Lionel Jospin]] and [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]. Also among the participants were [[Dalil Boubakeur]], head of the Paris Mosque and Chairman of the [[French Council of the Muslim Faith|Council of Muslims in France]], and [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Jean-Marie Lustiger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurojewcong.org/france/370-march-in-paris-in-memory-of-slain-jewish-youth.html|title=March in Paris in Memory of Slain Jewish Youth on the EJC website|publisher=|accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Right-wing politician [[Philippe de Villiers]] was booed by far-left militants and had to leave under police guard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexpress.fr/info/infojour/reuters.asp?id=15467&amp;2138 L'Express&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001031703/http://www.lexpress.fr/info/infojour/reuters.asp?id=15467&amp;2138 |date=October 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outside France===

On May 9, the [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|United States Helsinki Commission]] held a briefing titled "Tools for Combatting Anti-Semitism: Police Training and Holocaust Education" chaired by Commission Co-Chairman [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] (a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States House of Representatives|representative]]) who said: "[Halimi's] tragedy made brutally clear that Jews are still attacked because they are Jews, and that our work to eradicate all forms of anti-Semitism in all its ugly forms and manifestations is far from done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/-osce-critical-point-fight-against-anti-semitism-helsinki-/2006/05/12/1648075.htm |title=OSCE at 'Critical Point' in Fight Against Anti-Semitism; Helsinki Commission Briefing Details Initiatives to Combat Intolerance |date=May 12, 2006 |agency=Comtex Global News |publisher=SIP Trunking Report |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2009 trial ==

The trial, which started on April 29, 2009, was conducted behind closed doors because two of the suspects were minors.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 14 and 20 {{cite web |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069158&amp;dateTexte=20081212 |title=Ordonnance n° 45-174 du 2 février 1945 relative à l'enfance délinquante |language=fr |trans-title=Ordinance No. 45-174 of 2 February 1945 on juvenile delinquency |date=July 12, 2014 |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Halimi family wanted the trial to be conducted openly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Affaire Halimi: "Il n'y a aucune justification au huis-clos" |language=fr |trans-title=Halimi case: "There is no justification for closed session" |author=Julien Konczaty, |date=October 22, 2010 |agency=Reuters |author2=Gonzalo Fuentes |url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/societe/justice/affaire-halimi-il-n-y-a-aucune-justification-au-huis-clos_930291.html |newspaper=l'Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Szpiner spoke for Ruth Halimi, saying, ''A public trial would have helped [people] better understand the criminal machine, to make parents and teenagers reflect. It's the law of silence that killed her son, it would be unbearable for the trial to remain silent.''

The trial took 10 weeks.

===Incidents during and around the trial===
* A number of videos with Fonfana appeared on YouTube.
* Fofana appeared in court wearing a white [[T-shirt]], smiling, pointing to heaven and saying ''[[Takbir|Allāhu Akbar]]''. He claimed he had nothing to say and would be silent to the grave. When asked his name and date of birth he answered: ''Je m'appelle arabe, africaine révolte armée barbare salafiste. Je suis né le 13 février 2006 à Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois''. (''My name is [[Arab people|arab]], armed [[africa]]n rebellion [[Salafism|salafist]] barbarian army'' and ''I was born on February 13, 2006 in Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois'': the date and place Ilan Halimi was found).
* Fofana threw a shoe at the empty benches and again when he was taken down, shouting ''All the Jews in the world are there [in the empty box], they are my enemies. This is an Arab attack with a booby-trapped shoe!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fofana expulsé de son procès après un lancer de chaussures |language=fr |trans-title=Fofana expelled from his trial after a shoe throwing |author=Flore Galaud |agency=AFP |date=June 11, 2009 |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2009/06/11/01016-20090611ARTFIG00541-fofana-expulse-de-son-proces-apres-un-lancer-de-chaussures-.php |newspaper=[[Le Figaro]] |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fofana claimed in court that he had friends who would "take pictures to identify people." Francis Szpiner, lawyer for the Halimi family, believed that Fofana was alluding to the jurors, and was implying that he was going to put a price on their heads.&lt;ref name = "FOXNews-043009"&gt;{{cite news

On the evening of Friday, July 10, 2009, the verdict was handed down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ejpress.org/article/37916 |publisher=European Jewish Press |quote=The verdict was handed down late on Friday as Shabbat already started — by nine judges and a nine-member jury |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220013549/http://ejpress.org/article/37916 |archivedate=February 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ilan Halimi's mother and others were absent from the court, as the [[Sabbath]] had already started.

Of the 27 people on trial, 3 were acquitted.

A number of others, whose implication was not direct, or related to other activities of the gang, received smaller sentences. Three persons were acquitted. Notable is that one person, for whom originally no sentence was asked, received a suspended sentence.

===After the trial===

Sorour Arbabzadeh, the then-17-year-old French-Iranian girl who acted as bait to trap Halimi, was sentenced to 9 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/0101579160-peine-maximale-pour-le-cerveau-du-gang-des-barbares |title=Peine maximale pour le cerveau du "gang des barbares" |language=fr |trans-title=Maximum penalty for the brains of "gang of barbarians"

== 2010 retrial ==
The sentences issued after the first trial were criticized as too lenient by some parties, while others such as the [[Advocate General#Other European jurisdictions|attorney general]] [[Philippe Bilger]] found the sentences "exemplary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Affaire Halimi: un verdict qui ne passe pas |language=fr |trans-title=Halimi Case: A verdict that does not pass [i.e. fails] |author=Jérôme Bouin |newspaper=[[Le Figaro]] |agency=Associated Press and AFP |date=July 12, 2009 |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2009/07/12/01016-20090712ARTFIG00041-affaire-halimi-un-verdict-qui-ne-passe-pas-.php |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ministry of Justice (France)|Minister of Justice]] [[Michèle Alliot-Marie]], demanded an appeal of 8 of the 17 heaviest verdicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="Gang des barbares": peines alourdies requises en appel |language=fr |trans-title="Gang of Barbarians" burdened penalties required appeal |date=December 9, 2010 | url=http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/peines-alourdies-requises-en-appel-contre-le-gang-des-barbares-09-12-2010-1184608.php |newspaper=Le Parisien |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Prasquier, president of [[Conseil Représentatif des Institutions juives de France|CRIF]], France's main Jewish organization, said that a law may soon be available that would preclude closed-door trials in this type of case.&lt;ref name=Kline-709&gt;{{cite news |date=July 16, 2009 |title=Trials and Tribulations |author=Brett Kline |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |url=http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/Trials-and-tribulations |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Perhaps in a year's time there will be a new trial, and perhaps it will be public."

A Halimi relative said: "The important thing for me is not handing out heavier jail terms, honestly. The important thing is to open this to the press and public and make it a learning experience."

The retrial was officially announced Monday July 10, 2009. It started on October 25, 2010, and ended on December 17, 2010, with all convictions upheld and time added to some sentences.&lt;ref name="fcuikofj20101217"&gt;{{cite news

The ''H''-theorem is a natural consequence of the kinetic equation derived by Boltzmann that has come to be known as [[Boltzmann's equation]]. The ''H''-theorem has led to considerable discussion about its actual implications, with major themes being:
* What is entropy? In what sense does Boltzmann's quantity ''H'' correspond to the thermodynamic entropy?
* Are the assumptions (especially the assumption of [[molecular chaos]]) behind Boltzmann's equation too strong? When are these assumptions violated?

== Definition and meaning of Boltzmann's ''H'' ==

The ''H'' value is determined from the function ''f''(''E'', ''t'') ''dE'', which is the energy distribution function of molecules at time ''t''. The value ''f''(''E'', ''t'') ''dE'' is the number of molecules that have kinetic energy between ''E'' and ''E'' + ''dE''. ''H'' itself is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; H(t) = \int_0^\infty f(E,t) \left( \ln\frac{f(E,t)}{\sqrt{E}} - 1 \right) \, dE. &lt;/math&gt;

For an isolated ideal gas (with fixed total energy and fixed total number of particles), the function ''H'' is at a minimum when the particles have a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]; if the molecules of the ideal gas are distributed in some other way (say, all having the same kinetic energy), then the value of ''H'' will be higher. Boltzmann's ''H''-theorem, described in the next section, shows that when collisions between molecules are allowed, such distributions are unstable and tend to irreversibly seek towards the minimum value of ''H'' (towards the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution).

(Note on notation: Boltzmann originally used the letter ''E'' for quantity ''H''; most of the literature after Boltzmann uses the letter ''H'' as here. Boltzmann also used the symbol ''x'' to refer to the kinetic energy of a particle.)

== Boltzmann's ''H'' theorem ==

[[Image:Translational motion.gif|thumb|right|300px|In this mechanical model of a gas, the motion of the molecules appears very disorderly. Boltzmann showed that, assuming each collision configuration in a gas is truly random and independent, the gas converges to the [[Maxwell speed distribution]] even if it did not start out that way.]]

Boltzmann considered what happens during the collision between two particles. It is a basic fact of mechanics that in the elastic collision between two particles (such as hard spheres), the energy transferred between the particles varies depending on initial conditions (angle of collision, etc.).

Boltzmann made a key assumption known as the ''Stosszahlansatz'' ([[molecular chaos]] assumption), that during any collision event in the gas, the two particles participating in the collision have 1) independently chosen kinetic energies from the distribution, 2) independent velocity directions, 3) independent starting points. Under these assumptions, and given the mechanics of energy transfer, the energies of the particles after the collision will obey a certain new random distribution that can be computed.

Considering repeated uncorrelated collisions, between any and all of the molecules in the gas, Boltzmann constructed his kinetic equation ([[Boltzmann's equation]]). From this kinetic equation, a natural outcome is that the continual process of collision causes the quantity ''H'' to decrease until it has reached a minimum.

== Impact ==

Although Boltzmann's H-theorem turned out not to be the absolute proof of the second law of thermodynamics as originally claimed (see Criticisms below), the H-theorem led Boltzmann in the last years of the 19th century to more and more probabilistic arguments about the nature of thermodynamics. The probabilistic view of thermodynamics culminated in 1902 with [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]]'s statistical mechanics for fully general systems (not just gases), and the introduction of generalized [[statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|statistical ensemble]]s.

The kinetic equation and in particular Boltzmann's molecular chaos assumption inspired a whole family of [[Boltzmann equation]]s that are still used today to model the motions of particles, such as the electrons in a semiconductor. In many cases the molecular chaos assumption is highly accurate, and the ability to discard complex correlations between particles makes calculations much simpler.

== Criticism of the ''H''-theorem and exceptions ==
{{Refimprove|date=April 2015}}
There are several notable reasons described below why the ''H''-theorem, at least in its original 1871 form, is not completely rigorous. As Boltzmann would eventually go on to admit, the arrow of time in the ''H''-theorem is not in fact purely mechanical, but really a consequence of assumptions about initial conditions.&lt;ref&gt;J. Uffink, "[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/2691/1/UffinkFinal.pdf Compendium of the foundations of classical statistical physics.]" (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Loschmidt's paradox ===

{{main article|Loschmidt's paradox}}

Soon after Boltzmann published his ''H'' theorem, [[Johann Josef Loschmidt]] objected that it should not be possible to deduce an irreversible process from time-symmetric dynamics and a time-symmetric formalism. If the ''H'' decreases over time in one state, then there must be a matching reversed state where ''H'' increases over time ([[Loschmidt's paradox]]). The explanation is that Boltzmann's equation is based on the assumption of "[[molecular chaos]]", i.e., that it follows from, or at least is consistent with, the underlying kinetic model that the particles be considered independent and uncorrelated. It turns out that this assumption breaks time reversal symmetry in a subtle sense, and therefore [[begs the question]]. Once the particles are allowed to collide, their velocity directions and positions in fact ''do'' become correlated (however, these correlations are encoded in an extremely complex manner). This shows that an (ongoing) assumption of independence is not consistent with the underlying particle model.

Boltzmann's reply to Loschmidt was to concede the possibility of these states, but noting that these sorts of states were so rare and unusual as to be impossible in practice. Boltzmann would go on to sharpen this notion of the "rarity" of states, resulting in his famous equation, his entropy formula of 1877 (see [[Boltzmann's entropy formula]]).

=== Spin echo ===

As a demonstration of Loschmidt's paradox, a famous modern counterexample (not to Boltzmann's original gas-related ''H''-theorem, but to a closely related analogue) is the phenomenon of [[spin echo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rothstein | first1 = J. | title = Nuclear Spin Echo Experiments and the Foundations of Statistical Mechanics | doi = 10.1119/1.1934539 | journal = American Journal of Physics | volume = 25 | issue = 8 | pages = 510–511 | year = 1957 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1957AmJPh..25..510R }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spin echo effect, it is physically possible to induce time reversal in an interacting system of spins.

An analogue to Boltzmann's ''H'' for the spin system can be defined in terms of the distribution of spin states in the system. In the experiment, the spin system is initially perturbed into a non-equilibrium state (high ''H''), and, as predicted by the ''H'' theorem the quantity ''H'' soon decreases to the equilibrium value. At some point, a carefully constructed electromagnetic pulse is applied that reverses the motions of all the spins. The spins then undo the time evolution from before the pulse, and after some time the ''H'' actually ''increases'' away from equilibrium (once the evolution has completely unwound, the ''H'' decreases once again to the minimum value). In some sense, the time reversed states noted by Loschmidt turned out to be not completely impractical.

=== Poincaré recurrence ===

In 1896, [[Ernst Zermelo]] noted a further problem with the ''H'' theorem, which was that if the system's ''H'' is at any time not a minimum, then by [[Poincaré recurrence]], the non-minimal ''H'' must recur (though after some extremely long time). Boltzmann admitted that these recurring rises in ''H'' technically would occur, but pointed out that, over long times, the system spends only a tiny fraction of its time in one of these recurring states.

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the entropy of an [[isolated system]] always increases to a maximum equilibrium value. This is strictly true only in the thermodynamic limit of an infinite number of particles. For a finite number of particles, there will always be entropy fluctuations. For example, in the fixed volume of the isolated system, the maximum entropy is obtained when half the particles are in one half of the volume, half in the other, but sometimes there will be temporarily a few more particles on one side than the other, and this will constitute a very small reduction in entropy. These entropy fluctuations are such that the longer one waits, the larger an entropy fluctuation one will probably see during that time, and the time one must wait for a given entropy fluctuation is always finite, even for a fluctuation to its minimum possible value. For example, one might have an extremely low entropy condition of all particles being in one half of the container. The gas will quickly attain its equilibrium value of entropy, but given enough time, this same situation will happen again. For practical systems, e.g. a gas in a 1-liter container at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, this time is truly enormous, many multiples of the age of the universe, and, practically speaking, one can ignore the possibility.

=== Fluctuations of ''H'' in small systems ===

Since ''H'' is a mechanically defined variable that is not conserved, then like any other such variable (pressure, etc.) it will show [[thermal fluctuations]]. This means that ''H'' regularly shows spontaneous increases from the minimum value. Technically this is not an exception to the ''H'' theorem, since the ''H'' theorem was only intended to apply for a gas with a very large number of particles. These fluctuations are only perceptible when the system is small and the time interval over which it is observed is not enormously large.

If ''H'' is interpreted as entropy as Boltzmann intended, then this can be seen as a manifestation of the [[fluctuation theorem]].

== Connection to information theory ==

''H'' is a forerunner of Shannon's [[information entropy]]. [[Claude Shannon]] denoted his measure of [[Entropy (information theory)|information entropy]] ''H'' after the H-theorem.&lt;ref&gt;Gleick 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The article on Shannon's [[information entropy]] contains an
[[Shannon entropy#Information entropy explained|explanation]] of the discrete counterpart of the quantity ''H'', known as the information entropy or information uncertainty (with a minus sign).  By [[Shannon entropy#Extending discrete entropy to the continuous case: differential entropy|extending the discrete information entropy to the continuous information entropy]], also called [[differential entropy]], one obtains the expression in Eq.(1){{clarify|date=March 2015}}, and thus a better feel for the meaning of ''H''.

The H-theorem's connection between information and entropy plays a central role in a recent controversy called the [[Black hole information paradox]].

== Tolman's ''H''-theorem ==

[[Richard C. Tolman|Tolman]]'s 1938 book "The Principles of Statistical Mechanics" dedicates a whole chapter to the study of Boltzmann's ''H'' theorem, and its extension in the generalized classical statistical mechanics of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]]. A further chapter is devoted to the quantum mechanical version of the ''H''-theorem.

=== Classical mechanical ===

&lt;!-- This section need to be very explicit about the underpinning assumptions of the Boltzmann equation, e.g. Stosszahlansatz etc.
 Technical math derivations are fine but they should go into a collapsible block, and technical terms like "µ-space" must be at least defined!

Other inadequately defined symbols: G, P, \ln \delta v_\gamma. The derivations (or isolated formulas, if you like) are incomprehensible 
by themselves without definitions.     --&gt;

We let &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; be our [[Canonical coordinates|generalized coordinates]] for a set of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; particles. Then we consider a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; that returns the probability density of particles, over the states in [[phase space]]. Note how this can be multiplied by a small region in phase space, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\delta q_1 ... \delta p_r&lt;/math&gt;, to yeld the (average) expected number of particles in that region.

:&lt;math&gt;\delta n = f(q_1 ... p_r,t)\,\delta q_1\delta p_1 ... \delta q_r \delta p_r.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Tolman offers the following equations for the definition of the quantity H in Boltzmann's original H theorem.

: &lt;math&gt;H= \sum_i f_i \ln f_i \,\delta q_1 \cdots \delta p_r&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tolman 1938 pg. 135 formula 47.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Here we sum over the regions into which phase space is divided, indexed by &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. And in the limit for an infinitesimal phase space volume &lt;math&gt;\delta q_i \rightarrow 0, \delta p_i \rightarrow 0 \; \forall \, i&lt;/math&gt;, we can write the sum as an integral.

: &lt;math&gt;H= \int \cdots \int f \ln f \,d q_1 \cdots dp_r&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tolman 1938 pg. 135 formula 47.6&lt;/ref&gt;

H can also be written in terms of the number of molecules present in each of the cells.
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
H &amp; = \sum( n_i \ln n_i -  n_i \ln \delta v_\gamma) \\
&amp; = \sum n_i \ln n_i + \text{constant}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Tolman"&gt;Tolman 1938 pg. 135 formula 47.7&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=April 2014}}

An additional way to calculate the quantity H is:

: &lt;math&gt;H = -\ln P + \text{constant}\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tolman 1938 pg. 135 formula 47.8&lt;/ref&gt;

where ''P'' is the probability of finding a system chosen at random from the specified [[microcanonical ensemble]]. It can finally be written as:

: &lt;math&gt;H = -\ln G + \text{constant}\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tolman 1939 pg. 136 formula 47.9&lt;/ref&gt;

where ''G'' is the number of classical states.{{clarify|date=April 2014}}

The quantity ''H'' can also be defined as the integral over velocity space{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} :

:{| style="width:100%" border="0"
|-
| style="width:95%" |
&lt;math&gt;  \displaystyle
H \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  
\int { P ({\ln P}) \, d^3 v} 
= \left\langle \ln P \right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;
| style= | (1)
|}
where ''P''(''v'') is the probability distribution.

Using the Boltzmann equation one can prove that ''H'' can only decrease.

For a system of ''N'' statistically independent particles, ''H'' is related to the thermodynamic entropy ''S'' through:&lt;ref&gt; Huang 1987 pg 79 equation 4.33 &lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  - V k H + constant&lt;/math&gt; 

So, according to the H-theorem, ''S'' can only increase.

=== Quantum mechanical ===

In Quantum statistical mechanics (which is the quantum version of classical statistical mechanics), the H-function is the function:&lt;ref&gt;Tolman 1938 pg 460 formula 104.7&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;H= \sum_i p_i \ln p_i, \,&lt;/math&gt;
where summation runs over all possible distinct states of the system, and ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the probability that the system could be found in the ''i''-th state.

This is closely related to the [[Gibbs entropy|entropy formula of Gibbs]],
:&lt;math&gt;S = - k \sum_i p_i \ln p_i \;&lt;/math&gt;
and we shall (following e.g., Waldram (1985), p.&amp;nbsp;39) proceed using ''S'' rather than ''H''.

First, differentiating with respect to time gives

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{dS}{dt} &amp; =  - k \sum_i \left(\frac{dp_i}{dt} \ln p_i  + \frac{dp_i}{dt}\right) \\
&amp; =  - k \sum_i \frac{dp_i}{dt} \ln p_i  \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

(using the fact that ∑&amp;nbsp;''dp''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;/''dt'' = 0, since ∑&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1).

Now [[Fermi's golden rule]] gives a [[master equation]] for the average rate of quantum jumps from state α to β; and from state β to α. (Of course, Fermi's golden rule itself makes certain approximations, and the introduction of this rule is what introduces irreversibility. It is essentially the quantum version of Boltzmann's ''Stosszahlansatz''.) For an isolated system the jumps will make contributions
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{dp_\alpha}{dt} &amp; = \sum_\beta \nu_{\alpha\beta}(p_\beta - p_\alpha) \\
\frac{dp_\beta}{dt}  &amp; = \sum_\alpha \nu_{\alpha\beta}(p_\alpha - p_\beta) \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where the reversibility of the dynamics ensures that the same transition constant ''ν''&lt;sub&gt;''αβ''&lt;/sub&gt; appears in both expressions.

So

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dS}{dt} =  \frac{1}{2} k \sum_{ \alpha,\beta} \nu_{\alpha\beta}(\ln p_{\beta}-\ln p_{\alpha})(p_{\beta}- p_{\alpha}).&lt;/math&gt;

But the two differences terms in the summation always have the same sign, so each contribution to ''dS/dt'' cannot be negative.

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta S \geq 0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

for an isolated system.

The same mathematics is sometimes used to show that relative entropy is a [[Lyapunov function]] of a [[Markov process]] in [[detailed balance]], and other chemistry contexts.

== Gibbs' ''H''-theorem ==

[[File:Hamiltonian flow classical.gif|frame|Evolution of an ensemble of [[Hamiltonian mechanics|classical]] systems in [[phase space]] (top). Each system consists of one massive particle in a one-dimensional [[potential well]] (red curve, lower figure). The initially compact ensemble becomes swirled up over time.]]

[[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] described another way in which the entropy of a microscopic system would tend to increase over time.&lt;ref name="gibbs12"&gt;Chapter XII, from {{cite book |last=Gibbs |first=Josiah Willard |authorlink=Josiah Willard Gibbs |title=[[Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics]] |year=1902 |publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]] |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later writers have called this "Gibbs' ''H''-theorem" as its conclusion resembles that of Boltzmann's.&lt;ref name="tolman"&gt;{{cite book | last=Tolman |first=R. C. | authorlink = Richard C. Tolman | year=1938 | title=The Principles of Statistical Mechanics | publisher=[[Dover Publications]] | isbn = 9780486638966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbs himself never called it an ''H''-theorem, and in fact his definition of entropy—and mechanism of increase—are very different from Boltzmann's. This section is included for historical completeness.

The setting of Gibbs' entropy production theorem is in [[statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|ensemble]] statistical mechanics, and the entropy quantity is the [[Gibbs entropy]] (information entropy) defined in terms of the probability distribution for the entire state of the system. This is in contrast to Boltzmann's ''H'' defined in terms of the distribution of states of individual molecules, within a specific state of the system.

Gibbs considered the motion of an ensemble which initially starts out confined to a small region of phase space, meaning that the state of the system is known with fair precision though not quite exactly (low Gibbs entropy). The evolution of this ensemble over time proceeds according to [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's equation]]. For almost any kind of realistic system, the Liouville evolution tends to "stir" the ensemble over phase space, a process analogous to the mixing of a dye in an incompressible fluid.&lt;ref name="gibbs12"/&gt; After some time, the ensemble appears to be spread out over phase space, although it is actually a finely striped pattern, with the total volume of the ensemble (and its Gibbs entropy) conserved. Liouville's equation is guaranteed to conserve Gibbs entropy since there is no random process acting on the system; in principle, the original ensemble can be recovered at any time by reversing the motion.

The critical point of the theorem is thus: If the fine structure in the stirred-up ensemble is very slightly blurred, for any reason, then the Gibbs entropy increases, and the ensemble becomes an equilibrium ensemble. As to why this blurring should occur in reality, there are a variety of suggested mechanisms. For example, one suggested mechanism is that the phase space is coarse-grained for some reason (analogous to the pixelization in the simulation of phase space shown in the figure). For any required finite degree of fineness the ensemble becomes "sensibly uniform" after a finite time. Or, if the system experiences a tiny uncontrolled interaction with its environment, the sharp coherence of the ensemble will be lost. [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes]] argued that the blurring is subjective in nature, simply corresponding to a loss of knowledge about the state of the system.&lt;ref name="jaynes1965"&gt;E.T. Jaynes; Gibbs vs Boltzmann Entropies; American Journal of Physics,391,1965&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, however it occurs, the Gibbs entropy increase is irreversible provided the blurring cannot be reversed.

The exactly evolving entropy, which does not increase, is known as ''fine-grained entropy''. The blurred entropy is known as ''coarse-grained entropy''.
[[Leonard Susskind]] analogizes this distinction to the notion of the volume of a fibrous ball of cotton:&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonard Susskind]], Statistical Mechanics Lecture 7 (2013). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg15UClUY48&amp;t=83m0s Video] at [[YouTube]].&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand the volume of the fibers themselves is constant, but in another sense there is a larger coarse-grained volume, corresponding to the outline of the ball.

Gibbs' entropy increase mechanism solves some of the technical difficulties found in Boltzmann's ''H''-theorem: The Gibbs entropy does not fluctuate nor does it exhibit Poincare recurrence, and so the increase in Gibbs entropy, when it occurs, is therefore irreversible as expected from thermodynamics. The Gibbs mechanism also applies equally well to systems with very few degrees of freedom, such as the single-particle system shown in the figure. To the extent that one accepts that the ensemble becomes blurred, then, Gibbs' approach is a cleaner proof of the [[second law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name="jaynes1965"/&gt;

"'''Haecceity'''" ({{IPAc-en|h|ɛ|k|ˈ|s|iː|ɪ|t|i|,_|h|iː|k|-}}; from the [[Latin]] ''haecceitas'', which translates as "thisness") is a term from [[medieval philosophy|medieval]] [[Scholasticism|scholastic philosophy]], first coined by followers of [[Duns Scotus]] to denote a concept that he seems to have originated: the discrete qualities, properties or characteristics of a thing that make it a ''particular'' thing. Haecceity is a person's or object's ''thisness'', the individualising difference between the concept "a man" and the concept "Socrates" (''i.e.'', a specific person).&lt;ref&gt;[[s:W. H. Gardner|Gardner, W. H.]], ''Gerald Manley Hopkins'' (1975), p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology&lt;!--'To ti esti' redirects here--&gt;==
Haecceity is a literal translation of the equivalent term in [[Aristotle]]'s [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] '''''to ti esti'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (τὸ τί ἐστι)&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', 1030a&lt;/ref&gt; or "the what (it) is."

[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] later used the term as a non-descriptive reference to an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Bertman, M. A., ''Humanities Insights'' (2007), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haecceity and quiddity==
Haecceity may be defined in some dictionaries as simply the "essence" of a thing, or as a simple synonym for [[quiddity]] or [[hypokeimenon]]. However, such a definition deprives the term of its subtle distinctiveness and utility. Whereas haecceity refers to aspects of a thing that make it a ''particular'' thing, quiddity refers to the universal qualities of a thing, its "whatness", or the aspects of a thing it may share with other things and by which it may form part of a [[genus]] of things.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Hicks|Hicks, P.]], ''The Journey So Far'' (2003), p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

Duns Scotus makes the following distinction:

{{quote|Because there is among beings something indivisible into subjective parts—that is, such that it is formally incompatible for it to be divided into several parts each of which is it—the question is not what it is by which such a division is formally incompatible with it (because it is formally incompatible by incompatibility), but rather what it is by which, as by a proximate and intrinsic foundation, this incompatibility is in it. Therefore, the sense of the questions on this topic [viz. of individuation] is: What is it in [''e.g.''] this stone, by which as by a proximate foundation it is absolutely incompatible with the stone for it to be divided into several parts each of which is this stone, the kind of division that is proper to a universal whole as divided into its subjective parts?|Duns Scotus|''Ordinatio'' II, d. 3, p. 1. q. 2, n. 48]}}

While terms such as haecceity, quiddity, [[noumenon]] and hypokeimenon all evoke the [[essence]] of a thing, they each have subtle differences and refer to different aspects of the thing's essence.

Haecceity thus enabled Scotus to find a middle ground in the [[Problem of universals|debate over universals]] between [[Nominalism]] and Realism.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haecceity, sociology and philosophy==
The [[The Social Construction of Reality|social construction of reality]], [[ethnomethodology]], and [[conversation analysis]] are the main streams that elaborated during the 1960s a new kind of sociology—which influenced later sociology, philosophy, and political analysis. [[Harold Garfinkel]] is the founder of ethnomethodology, and teacher of Harvey Sacks, one of the founders of conversation analysis. He used the word haecceity in his seminal ''[[Studies in Ethnomethodology]]'' (1963), to enhance the indexical inevitable character of any expression, behavior or situation. According to him, the members display the social order they refer to within the settings of the situation they contribute to define.

In his famous paper generally referred to as "Parson's Plenum" (1988), Garfinkel used the term "Haecceities" to indicate the importance of the infinite [[contingency (philosophy)|contingencies]] in both situations and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Rawls | first = Ann | contribution = Harold Garfinkel | editor-last = Ritzer | editor-first = George | editor-link = George Ritzer | title = [[The Blackwell Companion to Major Contemporary Social Theorists|The Blackwell companion to major contemporary social theorists]] | publisher = Blackwell | location = Malden, Massachusetts Oxford | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781405105958  | ref = harv | postscript = .}} Also available as: {{Cite journal | last = Rawls | first = Ann | title = Chapter 5.

Garfinkel was drawing on [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[Edmund Husserl]], logic and [[Bertrand Russell]], and perception theory and [[Nelson Goodman]]. Phenomenology is the field of studying the phenomena as such, and can thus be seen as a contemporary philosophical version of the medieval concept of haecceity.

[[Gilles Deleuze]] uses the term to denote entities that exist on the [[plane of immanence]]. The usage was likely chosen in line with his esoteric concept of difference and individuation, and critique of object-centered [[metaphysics]].

==Influence==
[[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] drew on Scotus&amp;nbsp;— whom he described as “of reality the rarest-veined unraveller”&lt;ref&gt;''Duns Scotus's Oxford'' quoted in Gardner, p. xxiv&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— to construct his poetic theory of [[inscape]].

[[James Joyce]] made similar use of the concept of haecceitas to develop his idea of the secular [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Kearney|Kearney, R.]], ''Navigations'' (2007), pp. 133–4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] refers extensively to haecceitas (as "thisness") in developing an argument about conspicuous detail in aesthetic [[literary criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartosch, R., ''EnvironMentality: Ecocriticism and the Event of Postcolonial Fiction'' ([[Amsterdam]] &amp; [[New York City|New York]]: [[Rodopi (publisher)|Rodopi]], 2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2QjiAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA270 p. 270].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harassment''' covers a wide range of [[behavior]]s of an [[wikt:offensive|offensive]] nature. It is commonly understood as behavior that demeans, humiliates or embarrasses a person, and it is characteristically identified by its unlikelihood in terms of social and moral reasonableness. In the legal sense, these are behaviors that appear to be disturbing, upsetting or threatening. It evolves from [[Discrimination|discriminatory grounds]], and has an effect of nullifying or impairing a person from benefiting their rights. When this behaviors become repetitive it is defined as [[bullying]]. [[Sexual harassment]] refers to persistent and unwanted sexual advances even after gently refusing, typically in the workplace, where the consequences are potentially very disadvantageous to the victim if there is a [[Power (social and political)|power]] imbalance between the perpetuator.

==Etymology==
The word is based in English since circa 1618 as a [[loan word]] from the French, which was in turn already attested in 1572 meaning ''torment, annoyance, bother, trouble''&lt;ref&gt;J. Amyot, Œuvres morales, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; and later as of 1609 was also referred to ''the condition of being exhausted, overtired''.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lescarbot, Histoire de la Nouvelle France, I, 479&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Etymology of [http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/harassement harassement] in the French etymologic dictionary CNRTL (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; Of the French verb ''harasser'' itself there are the first records in a Latin to French translation of 1527 of [[Thucydides]]’ [[History of the Peloponnesian War|History of the war]] that was between the [[Peloponnesia]]ns and the [[Athens|Athenians]] both in the countries of the Greeks and the Romans and the neighbouring places wherein the translator writes ''harasser'' allegedly meaning ''harceler'' (to exhaust the enemy by repeated raids); and in the military chant Chanson du [[franc archer]]&lt;ref&gt;The original [https://books.google.com/books?id=hMUFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=%22Chanson+du+franc+archer+%22+&amp;source=web&amp;ots=F80UMk0A17&amp;sig=vfOYYDexxIUL2TQgl1cdcaPOpTo&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result#PPA33,M1 text] of the chant&lt;/ref&gt; of 1562, where the term is referred to a gaunt [[wikt:jument|jument]] (''de poil fauveau, tant maigre et harassée'': of fawn horsehair, so meagre and …) where it is supposed that the verb is used meaning ''overtired''.&lt;ref&gt;Etymology of [http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/harasser harasser] in the French etymologic dictionary CNRTL (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

A hypothesis about the origin of the verb ''harasser'' is ''harace''/''harache'', which was used in the 14th century in expressions like ''courre à la harache'' (to pursue) and ''prendre aucun par la harache'' (to take somebody under constraint).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/academie9/harassant//1 |title=Centre national de ressources textuelles et lexicales |publisher=Cnrtl.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Französisches Etymologisches Wörterbuch]], a German etymological dictionary of the French language (1922–2002) compares phonetically and syntactically both ''harace'' and ''harache'' to the interjection ''hare'' and ''haro'' by alleging a pejorative and augmentative form. The latter was an exclamation indicating distress and emergency (recorded since 1180) but is also reported later in 1529 in the expression ''crier haro sur'' (to arise indignation over somebody). ''hare'' 's use is already reported in 1204 as an order to finish public activities as fairs or markets and later (1377) still as command but referred to dogs. This dictionary suggests a relation of ''haro''/''hare'' with the old lower franconian ''*hara'' (here) (as by bringing a dog to heel).&lt;ref&gt;Etymology of [http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/haro haro]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the pejorative of an exclamation and in particular of such an exclamation is theoretically possible for the first word (''harace'') and maybe phonetically plausible for ''harache'', a semantic, syntactic and phonetic similarity of the verb ''harasser'' as used in the first popular attestation (the chant mentioned above) with the word ''haras'' should be kept in mind: Already in 1160 ''haras'' indicated a group of horses constrained together for the purpose of reproduction and in 1280 it also indicated the enclosure facility itself, where those horses are constrained.&lt;ref&gt;Etymology of [http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/haras haras]&lt;/ref&gt; The origin itself of ''harass'' is thought to be the old Scandinavian ''hârr'' with the Romanic suffix –as, which meant ''grey or dimmish horsehair''. Controversial is the etymological relation to the Arabic word for ''horse'' whose roman [[Romanization of Arabic|transliteration]] is [[Arabian horse|faras]].

Although the French origin of the word 'harassment' is beyond all question in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] and those dictionaries basing on it, a supposed Old French verb ''harer'' should be the origin of the French verb ''harasser'', despite the fact that this verb cannot be found in French etymologic dictionaries like that of the [[:fr:Centre national de resources textuelles et lexicales|Centre national de resources textuelles et lexicales]] or the [[Trésor de la langue française informatisé]] (see also their corresponding websites as indicated in the interlinks); since the entry further alleges a derivation from ''hare'', like in the mentioned German etymological dictionary of the French language a possible misprint of ''harer'' = ''har/ass/er'' = ''harasser'' is plausible or cannot be excluded. In those dictionaries the relationship with ''harassment'' were an interpretation of the interjection ''hare'' as ''to urge a dog to attack', despite the fact that it should indicate a shout to come and not to go (''hare'' = ''hara'' = ''here''; cf. above).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/harassment|title=Harassment - Define Harassment at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=harass&amp;searchmode=phrase|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/harassment|title=Harass - Definition of harass by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Heritage Dictionary]] prudently indicates this origin only as possible.

==Types==

===Electronic===
{{Main|Electronic harassment}}
Electronic harassment is the unproven belief of the use of [[electromagnetic wave]]s to harass a victim. Psychologists have identified evidence of [[auditory hallucination]]s, [[delusional disorder]]s,&lt;ref name=KMIRNews20121112&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jrn.com/kmir6/news/179055911.html |title=Electronic Harassment: Voices in My Mind |last=Monroe |first=Angela |date=November 12, 2012 |newspaper=KMIR News |accessdate=2014-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213164754/http://www.jrn.com/kmir6/news/179055911.html |archivedate=February 13, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or other [[mental disorder]]s in online communities supporting those who claim to be targeted.&lt;ref name=WaPo20070114&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/10/AR2007011001399.html |title=Mind Games |last=Weinberger|first=Sharon |date=January 14, 2007 | work=[[Washington Post]] |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olga Pochechueva.

===Landlord===
{{Main|Landlord harassment}}
Landlord harassment is the willing creation, by a [[landlord]] or his agents, of conditions that are uncomfortable for one or more [[Leasehold estate|tenants]] in order to induce willing abandonment of a [[Real estate contract|rental contract]].  Such a strategy is often sought because it avoids costly legal [[expenses]] and potential problems with [[eviction]].  This kind of activity is common in regions where [[rent control]] laws exist, but which do not allow the direct extension of rent-controlled prices from one tenancy to the subsequent tenancy, thus allowing landlords to set higher prices.  Landlord harassment carries specific legal penalties in some [[jurisdiction]]s, but enforcement can be very difficult or even impossible in many circumstances.  However, when a [[crime]] is committed in the process and motives similar to those described above are subsequently proven in court, then those motives may be considered an [[Attendant circumstance|aggravating factor]] in many jurisdictions, thus subjecting the offender(s) to a stiffer [[Sentence (law)|sentence]].

===Mobile===
{{Main|Mobile harassment}}
Mobile harassment refers to the sending of any type of [[Text messaging|text message]], [[Picture message|photo message]], [[Multimedia Messaging Service|video message]], or [[voicemail]] from a [[mobile phone]] that threatens, torments, or humiliates the recipient of these messages. It is a form of [[cyber bullying]].

===Online===

{{Main|Online harassment}}
Harassment directs multiple repeating obscenities and derogatory comments at specific individuals focusing, for example, on the targets' race, religion, gender, nationality, disability, or sexual orientation. This often occurs in chat rooms, through newsgroups, and by sending hate e-mail to interested parties. This may also include stealing photos of the victim and their families, doctoring these photos in offensive ways, and then posting them on social media with the aim of causing emotional distress (see [[cyberbullying]], [[cyberstalking]], [[hate crime]], [[online predator]], and [[stalking]]).

===Police===
{{Main|Police harassment}}
Unfair treatment conducted by law officials, including but not limited to [[excessive force]], [[Racial profiling|profiling]], [[Intimidation|threats]], [[coercion]], and racial, ethnic, religious, gender/sexual, age, or other forms of [[discrimination]].

===Power===
{{Main|Power harassment}}
Power harassment is harassment or unwelcome attention of a political nature, often occurring in the environment of a workplace including hospitals, schools and universities. It includes a range of behavior from mild irritation and annoyances to serious [[abuse]]s which can even involve forced activity beyond the boundaries of the job description. Power harassment is considered a form of illegal [[discrimination]] and is a form of political and [[psychological abuse]], and [[bullying]].

===Psychological===
This is humiliating, intimidating or abusive behavior which is often difficult to detect, leaving no evidence other than victim reports or complaints. This characteristically lowers a person’s self-esteem or causes one to have overwhelming torment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Annette B. Roter|title=Understanding and Recognizing Dysfunctional Leadership: The Impact of Dysfunctional Leadership on Organizations and Followers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PTElDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161|date=26 June 2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-00517-9|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can take the form of verbal comments, engineered episodes of intimidation, aggressive actions or repeated gestures. Falling into this category is workplace harassment by individuals or groups [[mobbing]].

Sexual harassment is an offensive or humiliating behaviour that is related to a person's sex. It can be an subtle and overt sexual nature of a person (sexual annoyance), implied sexual conditions of a job (sexual coercion), etc. It can happen anywhere, but is most common in the [[Sexual harassment in the workplace in the United States|workplace]], [[Sexual harassment in education|schools]], and the [[Sexual harassment in the military|military]]. It involves unwanted and unwelcome words, deeds, actions, gestures, symbols, or behaviours of a sexual nature that make the target feel uncomfortable.

Workplace harassment is the offensive, belittling or threatening behavior directed at an individual worker or a group of workers.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;http://www.apsc.gov.au/publications01/harassment.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, matters of [[workplace]] harassment have gained interest among practitioners and researchers as it is becoming one of the most sensitive areas of effective workplace management. In [[Oriental]] countries, it attracted lots of attention from researchers and governments since the 1980s, because a significant source of work stress is associated with aggressive behaviors in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Tehrani, N.

==Laws==
{{globalize|section|date=August 2015}}

===United States===

Harassment, under the laws of the United States, is defined as any repeated or continuing un-consented contact that serves no useful purpose beyond creating alarm, annoyance, or emotional distress. In 1964, the United States Congress passed Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] which prohibited discrimination at work on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin and sex. This later became the legal basis for early harassment law. The practice of developing workplace guidelines prohibiting harassment was pioneered in 1969, when the U.S. Department of Defense drafted a Human Goals Charter, establishing a policy of equal respect for both sexes. In ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]],'' {{ussc|477|57|1986}}: the U.S. Supreme Court recognized harassment suits against employers for promoting a sexually [[hostile work environment]]. In 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] signed a law which prohibited the transmission of annoying messages over the [[Internet]] (''aka'' [[Spam (electronic)|spamming]]) without disclosing the sender's true identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCullagh|first=Declan|author-link=Declan McCullagh|url=http://news.com.com/Create+an+e-annoyance,+go+to+jail/2010-1028_3-6022491.html|title=Create an e-annoyance, go to jail|work=CNET news|date=9 January 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315091415/http://news.com.com/Create+an+e-annoyance,+go+to+jail/2010-1028_3-6022491.html|archive-date=15 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Jersey's Law Against Discrimination ("LAD")====
The LAD prohibits employers from discriminating in any job-related action, including recruitment, interviewing, hiring, promotions, discharge, compensation and the terms, conditions and privileges of employment on the basis of any of the law's specified protected categories. These protected categories are race, creed, color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, age, sex (including pregnancy and sexual harassment), marital status, domestic partnership status, affectional or sexual orientation, atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait, genetic information, liability for military service, or mental or physical disability, including [[HIV/AIDS]] and related illnesses. The LAD prohibits intentional discrimination based on any of these characteristics. Intentional discrimination may take the form of differential treatment or statements and conduct that reflect discriminatory animus or bias.

===Canada===
In 1984, the [[Canadian Human Rights Act]] prohibited sexual harassment in workplaces under federal jurisdiction.

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Harassment in the United Kingdom}}
In the UK, there are a number of laws protecting people from harassment, including the [[Protection from Harassment Act 1997]] and the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]].

{{terrorism}}
The '''history of terrorism''' is a history of well-known and historically significant individuals, entities, and incidents associated, whether rightly or wrongly, with [[terrorism]]. Scholars agree that terrorism is a [[definition of terrorism|disputed term]], and very few of those labeled terrorists describe themselves as such. It is common for opponents in a violent conflict to describe the other side as terrorists or as practicing terrorism.&lt;ref name=tws11janbcvc&gt;{{cite news|author1=Paul Reynolds |author2=quoting David Hannay |author3=Former UK ambassador |title= UN staggers on road to reform|quote= This would end the argument that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter...|publisher= BBC News|date= 14 September 2005|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4244842.stm|accessdate= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on how broadly the term is defined, the roots and practice of terrorism can be traced at least to the 1st-century AD [[Sicarii Zealots]], though some dispute whether the group, which [[assassination|assassinated]] collaborators with Roman rule in the province of [[Judea]], was in fact terrorist. The first use in English of the term 'terrorism' occurred during the [[French Revolution]]'s [[Reign of Terror]], when the [[Jacobins]], who ruled the revolutionary state, employed violence, including mass executions by guillotine, to compel obedience to the state and intimidate regime enemies.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/opinion/28furstenberg.html|title=Opinion - Bush’s Dangerous Liaisons|first=François|last=Furstenberg|date=28 October 2007|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association of the term only with state violence and intimidation lasted until the mid-19th century, when it began to be associated with non-governmental groups. [[Anarchism]], often in league with rising [[nationalism]] and [[anti-monarchism]], was the most prominent ideology linked with terrorism. Near the end of the 19th century, anarchist groups or individuals committed assassinations of a Russian Tsar and a U.S. President.

In the 20th century, terrorism continued to be associated with a vast array of anarchist, socialist, fascist and nationalist groups, many of them engaged in '[[third world]]' anti-colonial struggles. Some scholars also labeled as terrorist the systematic internal violence and intimidation practiced by states such as the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–53)|Stalinist Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="NaziTerror"&gt;{{Citation|title=Nazi Terror Begins |publisher=United States Holocaust Museum |date=20 June 2014 |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005686}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foundations"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin A.

Though many have been proposed, there is no consensus definition of the term "terrorism."&lt;ref name=Record-p6-fn11&gt;Jeffrey Record.

See review in The [[New York Times]] [https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hoffman-terrorism.html Inside Terrorism]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term terrorist is believed to have originated during the [[Reign of Terror]] (September 5, 1793{{snds}}July 28, 1794) in France. It was a period of eleven months during the [[French Revolution]] when the ruling [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] employed violence, including mass executions by [[guillotine]], in order to intimidate the regime's enemies and compel obedience to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/recent/sept_11/changing_faces_01.shtml|title=BBC - History - The Changing Faces of Terrorism|date=|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jacobins, most famously Robespierre, sometimes referred to themselves as "terrorists".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt; Some modern scholars, however, do not consider the Reign of Terror a form of terrorism, in part because it was carried out by the French state.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chialand, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early terrorism==
[[File:Asabah2.jpg|thumb|right|Artistic rendering of [[Hassan-i Sabbah]]]]

Scholars dispute whether the roots of terrorism date back to the 1st century and the [[Sicarii Zealots]], to the 11th century and the Al-[[Hashshashin]], to the 19th century and the [[Fenian Brotherhood]] and [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]], or to other eras.&lt;ref name="cdi.org"&gt;[http://www.cdi.org/friendlyversion/printversion.cfm?documentID=1502 History of Terrorism article by Mark Burgess] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511140810/http://www.cdi.org/friendlyversion/printversion.cfm?documentID=1502 |date=2012-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The Sicarii and the Hashshashin are described below, while the Fenian Brotherhood and Narodnaya Volya are discussed in the 19th Century sub-section. Other pre-Reign of Terror historical events sometimes associated with terrorism include the [[Gunpowder Plot]], an attempt to destroy the English [[Palace of Westminster|Parliament]] in 1605.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berr.gov.uk/fireworks/download/FW1434_Keystage2_07.pdf] http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090609003228/http://www.berr.gov.uk/fireworks/download/FW1434_Keystage2_07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1st century CE, the [[Zealotry|Jewish Zealots]] in [[Judaea Province]] rebelled, killing prominent collaborators with Roman rule.&lt;ref name="cdi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.56&lt;/ref&gt; In 6 CE, according to contemporary historian [[Josephus]], [[Judas of Galilee]] formed a small and more extreme offshoot of the Zealots, the [[Sicarii]] ("dagger men").&lt;ref name="Chaliand, Gerard 2007. p.68"/&gt; Their efforts were also directed against Jewish "collaborators," including temple priests, [[Sadducees]], [[Herodians]], and other wealthy elites.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; According to Josephus, the Sicarii would hide short daggers under their cloaks, mingle with crowds at large festivals, murder their victims, and then disappear into the panicked crowds. Their most successful assassination was of the [[List of High Priests of Israel|High Priest of Israel]] Jonathan.&lt;ref name="Chaliand, Gerard 2007. p.68"/&gt;

In the late 11th century, the [[Hashshashin]] (a.k.a. the Assassins) arose, an offshoot of the [[Isma'ili]] sect of [[Shia]] [[Muslim]]s.&lt;ref name="Rapoport, David 1984. p.658"&gt;Rapoport, David. "Fear and Trembling: Terrorism in Three Religious Traditions." ''American Political Science Review'', 1984. p.658&lt;/ref&gt; Led by [[Hassan-i Sabbah]] and opposed to [[Fatimid]] rule, the Hashshashin militia seized Alamut and other fortress strongholds across Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Willey, Peter. ''The Castles of the Assassins''. New York: Linden Press, 2001. p.19&lt;/ref&gt; Hashshashin forces were too small to challenge enemies militarily, so they assassinated city governors and military commanders in order to create alliances with militarily powerful neighbors. For example, they killed Janah al-Dawla, ruler of [[Homs]], to please [[Ridwan of Aleppo]], and assassinated [[Mawdud]], [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] emir of [[Mosul]], as a favor to the regent of [[Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;Daftary, Farhad. ''The Assassin Legends: Myths of the Isma'ilis''. London: I. B. Tauris, 1995. p.42&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hashshashin]] also carried out assassinations as retribution.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, Marshall G. S. ''The Secret Order of Assassins: The Struggle of the Early Nizari Ismai'lis Against the Islamic World''. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005. p.83&lt;/ref&gt; Under some definitions of terrorism, such [[assassinations]] do not qualify as terrorism, since killing a political leader does not intimidate political enemies or inspire revolt.&lt;ref name="cdi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaliand, Gerard 2007. p.68"&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sons of Liberty]] was a clandestine group that formed in [[Boston]] and [[New York City]] in the 1770s. It had a political agenda of independence of Britain's American colonies. The groups engaged in several acts that could be considered terroristic and used the deeds for propaganda purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.varsitytutors.com/earlyamerica/early-america-review/volume-1/sons-liberty-patriots-terrorists|title=Sons of Liberty: Patriots or Terrorists? - Archiving Early America|website=www.varsitytutors.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gunpowder Plot==

On November 5, 1605, a group of conspirators led by [[Robert Catesby]] attempted to destroy the English Parliament on its State Opening by King James I. They planned in secret to detonate a large quantity of [[gunpowder]] placed beneath the [[Palace of Westminster]]. The gunpowder was procured and placed by [[Guy Fawkes]]. The group intended to enact a coup by killing King James I and the members of both houses of Parliament. The conspirators planned to make one of the king's children a puppet monarch and then restore the Catholic faith to England. The conspirator leased a coal cellar beneath the House of Lords and began stockpiling gunpowder in 1604. As well as its primary targets, it would have killed hundreds, if not thousands, of Londoners – the most devastating act of terrorism in Britain's history, plunging the nation into a religious war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4671842/gunpowder-plot-1605-robert-catesby-guy-fawkes-houses-of-parliament/|title=How Britain's first terrorists almost changed the course of history with the Gunpowder Plot|date=5 November 2017|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; English spymasters uncovered the plot and caught Guy Fawkes with the gunpowder beneath Parliament. The other conspirators fled to Holbeach in Staffordshire. A shoot out on November 8 with authorities led to the deaths of Robert Catesby, Thomas Percy and the brothers Christopher and John Wright. The rest were captured.  Fawkes and seven others were tried and executed in January 1606.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historytoday.com/simon-adams/gunpowder-plot-terror-and-toleration|title=The Gunpowder Plot: Terror and Toleration - History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planned attack has become known as the Gunpowder Plot and is commemorated in Britain every November 5 with fireworks displays and large bonfires with effigies of Guy Fawkes and [[the Pope]] are often burned. Comparisons are often drawn between gunpowder plot and modern religious terrorism, such as the attacks in the US by Islamic terrorists on [[9/11]] 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1488402/Gunpowder-Plot-was-Englands-911-says-historian.html|title=Gunpowder Plot was England's 9/11, says historian|first=Nick|last=Britten|date=21 April 2005|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Gunpowder Plot: Terror and Faith in 1605; Author Antonia Fraser; published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
[[File:Fenian guy fawkesr1867reduced.png|thumb|250px|"The Fenian Guy Fawkes" by [[John Tenniel]], published in [[Punch magazine]], on 28 December 1867]]

One of the earliest groups to utilize modern terrorist techniques was arguably the [[Fenian Brotherhood]] and its offshoot the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/adulted/coursesbycode/hn258/|title=Terrorism: From the Fenians to Al Qaeda|accessdate=2014-01-09}}http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/terrorism/&lt;/ref&gt; They were both founded in 1858 as revolutionary, militant nationalist and Catholic groups, both in Ireland and amongst the emigre community in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Irish Freedom, by Richard English Publisher: Pan Books (2 November 2007), {{ISBN|0-330-42759-8}} p179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irish Freedom, by Richard English Publisher: Pan Books (2 November 2007), {{ISBN|0-330-42759-8}} p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

After centuries of continued British rule, and influenced most recently from the devastating effects of the 1840s [[Irish potato famine]], these revolutionary fraternal organisations were founded with the aim of establishing an independent republic in Ireland, and began carrying out frequent acts of violence in metropolitan Britain to achieve their aims through intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;Irish Freedom, by Richard English Publisher: Pan Books (2 November 2007), {{ISBN|0-330-42759-8}} p3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, members of the movement's leadership were arrested and convicted for organizing an [[Fenian Rising|armed uprising]]. While being transferred to [[Belle Vue Gaol|prison]], the police van in which they were being transported was intercepted and a [[police]] sergeant was shot in the rescue. A bolder rescue attempt of another Irish radical incarcerated in [[Clerkenwell Prison]], was made in the same year: an explosion to demolish the prison wall killed 12 people and caused many injuries. The bombing enraged the British public, causing a panic over the Fenian threat.

Although the Irish Republican Brotherhood condemned the Clerkenwell Outrage as a "dreadful and deplorable event", the organisation returned to bombings in Britain in 1881 to 1885, with the [[Fenian dynamite campaign]], beginning one of the first modern terror campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whelehan|first=Niall|title=The Dynamiters: Irish Nationalism and Political Violence in the Wider World 1867–1900|year=2012|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of earlier forms of terrorism based on political assassination, this campaign used modern, timed explosives with the express aim of sowing fear in the very heart of metropolitan Britain, in order to achieve political gains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theirishstory.com/2012/02/13/one-skilled-scientist-is-worth-an-army-the-fenian-dynamite-campaign-1881-85/#.UkniH3-tbXQ|title=The Fenian Dynamite campaign 1881–85|accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; – ([[Prime minister]] [[William Ewart Gladstone]] was partly influenced to disestablish the [[Anglican Church in Ireland]] as a gesture by the Clerkenwell bombing). The campaign also took advantage of the greater global integration of the times, and the bombing was largely funded and organised by the [[Fenian Brotherhood]] in the United States.

The first police unit to combat terrorism was established in 1883 by the [[Metropolitan Police]], initially as a small section of the [[Criminal Investigation Department]]. It was known as the [[Special Irish Branch]], and was trained in counter terrorism techniques to combat the Irish Republican Brotherhood. The unit's name was changed to Special Branch as the unit's remit steadily widened over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Secret War Exhibition, Imperial War Museum London&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anarchism and "propaganda of the deed"===
[[File:I Grinevizky.jpg|170px|thumb|right|[[Ignacy Hryniewiecki]], a terrorist who assassinated Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]]]]

The concept of "[[propaganda of the deed]]" (or "propaganda by the deed", from the French ''propagande par le fait'') advocated physical [[violence]] or other provocative public acts against political enemies in order to inspire mass rebellion or [[revolution]]. One of the first individuals associated with this concept, the Italian revolutionary [[Carlo Pisacane]] (1818{{ndash}}1857), wrote in his "Political Testament" (1857) that "ideas spring from deeds and not the other way around". [[Anarchist]] [[Mikhail Bakunin]] (1814{{ndash}}1876), in his "Letters to a Frenchman on the Present Crisis" (1870) stated that "we must spread our principles, not with words but with deeds, for this is the most popular, the most potent, and the most irresistible form of propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1870/letter-frenchman.htm|title=Works of Mikhail Bakunin 1870|author=Mikhail Bakunin|date=|work=marxists.org|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French [[anarchist]] [[Paul Brousse]] (1844{{ndash}}1912) popularized the phrase "propaganda of the deed"; in 1877 he cited as examples the 1871 [[Paris Commune]] and a workers' demonstration in [[Berne]] provocatively using the socialist red flag.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas]]''&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1880s, the slogan had begun to be used{{by whom|date=April 2015}} to refer to bombings, [[regicide]]s and [[tyrannicide]]s. Reflecting this new understanding of the term, in 1895 Italian anarchist [[Errico Malatesta]] described "propaganda by the deed" (which he opposed the use of) as violent communal insurrections meant to ignite an imminent revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm|title=Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Volume One - ,  - Black Rose Books|date=|work=blackrosebooks.net|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in Russia in 1878, [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]] (''Народная Воля'' in Russian; ''People's Will'' in English) was a revolutionary anarchist group inspired by [[Sergei Nechayev]] and by "propaganda by the deed" theorist Pisacane.&lt;ref name="cdi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoffman, Bruce 1998. p. 5"/&gt; The group developed ideas—such as [[targeted killing]] of the "leaders of oppression"—that would become the hallmark of subsequent violence by small non-state groups, and they were convinced that the developing technologies of the age—such as the invention of dynamite, which they were the first anarchist group to make widespread use of&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Terrorism'', by Walter Laqueur, Transaction Publishers, 2000, {{ISBN|0-7658-0799-8}}, p. 92 [https://books.google.com/books?id=RlqQHKpLfL8C&amp;dq=dynamite+terrorism+history&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s]&lt;/ref&gt;—enabled them to strike directly and with discrimination.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; Attempting to spark a popular revolt against Russian Tsardom, the group killed prominent political figures by gun and bomb, and on March 13, 1881, assassinated Russia's Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]].&lt;ref name="cdi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoffman, Bruce 1998. p. 5"&gt;Hoffman 1998, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The assassination, by a bomb that also killed the Tsar's attacker, [[Ignacy Hryniewiecki]], failed to spark the expected revolution, and an ensuing crackdown brought the group to an end.&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.133&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual Europeans also engaged in politically motivated violence. For example, in 1893, [[Auguste Vaillant]], a French [[Anarchism|anarchist]], threw a bomb in the French [[Chamber of Deputies]] in which one person was injured.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1894/02/06/archives/the-guillotines-sure-work-details-of-the-execution-of-vaillant-the.html The Guillotine's Sure Work; Details of the Execution of Vaillant, the Anarchist]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1984-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction to Vaillant's bombing and other bombings and assassination attempts, the French government restricted [[freedom of the press]] by passing a set of [[law]]s that became pejoratively known as the ''[[lois scélérates]]'' ("villainous laws"). In the years 1894 to 1896 anarchists killed President of France [[Marie Francois Carnot]], Prime Minister of Spain [[Antonio Cánovas del Castillo]], and the Empress of Austria-Hungary, [[Elisabeth of Bavaria]].

===The United States===
Prior to the [[American Civil War]], [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] (1800{{ndash}}1859) advocated and practiced armed opposition to [[slavery]], leading several attacks between 1856 and 1859, the most famous attack was launched in 1859 against the [[Harpers Ferry Armory|armory]] at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]]. Local forces soon recaptured the fort and Brown was tried and executed for [[treason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/04/22/AR2005042201172_pf.html | work=The Washington Post | title=The Good Terrorist | first=David W. | last=Blight |accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A biographer of Brown has written that Brown's purpose was "to force the nation into a new political pattern by creating terror."&lt;ref&gt;Otto Scott, ''The Secret Six: John Brown and the Abolitionist Movement'' (Murphys, Calif.: Uncommon Books, 1979, 1983), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the 150th anniversary of Brown's death, prominent news publications debated over whether or not Brown should be considered a terrorist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2009/dec/02/john-brown-civil-war| work=The Guardian (UK) |title=Let's debate John Brown: terrorist, or no?| first=Michael|last=Tomasky|date=December 2, 2009|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/opinion/02reynolds.html?ref=opinion&amp;_r=0|work=New York Times| title=Freedom's Martyr|first=David S.|last=Reynolds|date=December 1, 2009|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/opinion/02horwitz.html?ref=opinion|work=New York Times| title=The 9/11 of 1859|first=Tony|last=Horwitz|date=December 1, 2009|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], on December 24, 1865, six [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] veterans created the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK).&lt;ref&gt;Horn, 1939, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The KKK used violence, lynching, murder and acts of intimidation such as [[cross burning]] to oppress [[African Americans]] in particular, and it created a sensation with its masked forays' dramatic nature.&lt;ref name="Jackson 1992 ed., pp. 241-242"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/filelink.html?file=/publications/terror/terror2000_2001.pdf|title=Terrorism 2000/2001|accessdate=2009-03-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320174902/https://www.fbi.gov/publications/terror/terror2000_2001.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's politics were [[white supremacy|white supremacist]], [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]], [[racism|racist]], [[anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]], and [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]].&lt;ref name="Jackson 1992 ed., pp. 241-242"&gt;Jackson 1992 ed., pp. 241–242.&lt;/ref&gt; A KKK founder boasted that it was a nationwide organization of 550,000 men and that it could muster 40,000 Klansmen within five days' notice, but as a secret or "[[Invisible dictatorship|invisible]]" group with no membership rosters, it was difficult to judge the Klan's actual size. The KKK has at times been politically powerful, and at various times it controlled the governments of [[Tennessee]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Indiana]] and [[South Carolina]], as well as several legislatures in [[Southern United States|the South]].&lt;ref&gt;Marty Gitlin, ''The Ku Klux Klan: A Guide to an American Subculture'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/library/2848.htm|title=ISL: Ku Klux Klan in Indiana|website=www.in.gov|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Ottoman Empire===
Several nationalist groups used violence against an [[Ottoman Empire]] in apparent decline. One was the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] (in Armenian ''Dashnaktsuthium'', or "The Federation"), a revolutionary movement founded in [[Tiflis]] (Russian Transcaucasia) in 1890 by [[Christapor Mikaelian]]. Many members had been part of [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]] or the [[Hunchakian Revolutionary Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Balakian, Peter. ''The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response.'' New York: Harper Perennial, 2004. p.104&lt;/ref&gt; The group published newsletters, smuggled arms, and hijacked buildings as it sought to bring in European intervention that would force the Ottoman Empire to surrender control of its Armenian territories.&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.193&lt;/ref&gt; On August 24, 1896, 17-year-old Babken Suni led twenty-six members in [[1896 Ottoman Bank Takeover|capturing the Imperial Ottoman Bank in Constantinople]]. The group demanded European intervention in order to stop the [[Hamidian massacres]] and the creation of an Armenian state, but backed down on a threat to blow up the bank. An ensuing security crackdown destroyed the group.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Bruce. ''Inside Terrorism''. New York: Columbia University Press, 2006. Page 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also inspired by Narodnaya Volya, the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) was a revolutionary movement founded in 1893 by Hristo Tatarchev in the Ottoman-controlled Macedonian territories.&lt;ref name="Ross, Jeffrey Ian 2006. p.34"&gt;Ross, Jeffrey Ian. ''Political Terrorism: An Interdisciplinary Approach''. New York: Peter Lang Press, 2006. p.34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Robert. ''Balkan Ghosts: A Journey Through History''. New York: Picador, 2005. p.56&lt;/ref&gt; Through assassinations and by provoking uprisings, the group sought to coerce the Ottoman government into creating a Macedonian nation.&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.189&lt;/ref&gt; On July 20, 1903, the group incited the Ilinden uprising in the Ottoman villayet of Monastir. The IMRO declared the town's independence and sent demands to the [[European Powers]] that all of Macedonia be freed.&lt;ref&gt;Danforth, Loring. ''The Macedonian Conflict.'' Princeton University Press, 1997. p.87&lt;/ref&gt; The demands were ignored and Turkish troops crushed the 27,000 rebels in the town two months later.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Robert. ''Balkan Ghosts: A Journey Through History''. New York: Picador, 2005. p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 20th century==
[[File:Minutos previos al atentado en Sarajevo.jpg|thumb|The assassination of the heir to the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] throne, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], precipitated a [[First World War|global war]]]]
[[File:Nathuram godse.jpg|thumb|[[Nathuram Godse]], the assassin of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in 1948 was the first terrorist of independent [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=rUYyhMxHqnQC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;dq=godse+first+Terrorist&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEjoz-04HeAhWIvo8KHbZwC7AQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=godse%20first%20Terrorist&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pressreader.com/india/the-times-of-india-mumbai-edition/20170725/281762744320909&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Revolutionary nationalism continued to motivate political violence in the 20th century, much of it directed against western colonial powers. The [[Irish Republican Army]] campaigned against the British in the 1910s and inspired the [[Zionism|Zionist]] groups [[Hagannah]], [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] to fight the British throughout the 1930s in the Palestine mandate.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, J. Bowyer. ''Terror Out of Zion: Irgun Zvai Leumi, Lehi and the Palestine Underground, 1929–1949''.

''The Society of the Muslim Brothers in Egypt: The Rise of an Islamic Mass Movement 1928–1942''. Ithaca Press, 2006. p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

The women's [[suffrage movement]] in the UK also committed terrorist attacks prior to the [[First World War]]. There were three phases of [[Women's Social and Political Union|WSPU]] militancy in 1905, 1908, 1913; including civil disobedience, destruction of public property and arson and bombings. Most notably, The WSPU burned down Government Minister, and future Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]]'s house&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Rowland|first= Peter|authorlink= Peter Rowland|title= David Lloyd George:a biography|publisher= Macmillan|page= 228|year= 1978|url= https://books.google.com/?id=u5WfAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; (despite his support for women's suffrage).

Political assassinations continued, resulting in the assassinations of King [[Umberto I of Italy]], killed in July 1900 and US President [[William McKinley]] in September 1901. Political violence became especially widespread in [[Imperial Russia]], and several ministers were killed in the opening years of the 20th century. The highest-ranking was prime minister [[Pyotr Stolypin]], killed in 1911 by Dmitry Bogrov, a spy for the secret police in several anarchist, socialist and other revolutionary groups.&lt;ref&gt;Fontanka 16: The Tsars' Secret Police, by Charles A. Ruud, Sergei A. Stepanov&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 1914, [[Gavrilo Princip]], one of a group of six assassins, shot and killed [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], heir to the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] throne, and his wife, [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg]], in [[Sarajevo]], the capital of the Condominion  of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The assassinations produced widespread shock across Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/100-years-since-the-assassination-of-archduke-franz-ferdinand-the-shot-that-sparked-the-first-world-9570029.html|title=100 years since the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand: How did|date=28 June 2014|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; setting in motion a series of events which led to [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/08/first-world-war-franz-ferdinand-sarajevo|title=First World War: Reports of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo|date=8 November 2008|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, the [[Nazi]] regime in Germany and [[Stalin]]'s rule in [[the Soviet Union]] practiced [[state terror]] systematically and on a massive and unprecedented scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Hitler vs. Stalin: Who Was Worse?|publisher= New York Review of Books|date= 27 January 2011|url= http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2011/jan/27/hitler-vs-stalin-who-was-worse/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Stalin regime branded its opponents with the label "terrorist".&lt;ref&gt;

===Irish independence===
In an action called the [[Easter Rising]] or [[Easter Rebellion]], on April 24, 1916, members of the [[Irish Volunteers]] and the [[Irish Citizen Army]] seized the [[General Post Office (Dublin)|Dublin General Post Office]] and several other buildings, proclaiming an independent Irish Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.185&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellion failed militarily but was a success for [[physical force Irish republicanism]], leaders of the uprising becoming Irish heroes after their eventual execution by the British government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/easterrising/aftermath/af01.shtml|title= BBC - History - 1916 Easter Rising - Aftermath - The Executions|date= |work= bbc.co.uk|accessdate= 27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sackville Street (Dublin) after the 1916 Easter Rising.JPG|left|thumb|Rubble in the streets of [[Dublin]] after the failed [[Easter Rising]] in 1916 against British rule]]

Shortly after the rebellion, [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] and others founded the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), which from 1916 to 1923{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} carried out numerous attacks against symbols of British power. For example, it attacked over 300 police stations simultaneously just before Easter 1920,&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, p.185: "Just before Easter 1920, the IRA simultaneously attacked more than 300 police stations..."&lt;/ref&gt; and, in November 1920, publicly killed a dozen police officers and burned down the Liverpool docks and warehouses, an action that became known as [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]].&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Peter. ''Mick: The Real Michael Collins''. p.241&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of warfare, London agreed to the 1921 Anglo-Irish treaty creating a free Irish state encompassing 26 of the island's 32 counties.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Tim. ''Michael Collins: The Man Who Made Ireland.'' New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2002. p.92&lt;/ref&gt; IRA tactics were an inspiration to other groups, including the [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine Mandate]]'s [[Zionism|Zionists]],&lt;ref name="Colin Shindler p.177"&gt;Colin Shindler, ''The Land Beyond Promise:Israel, Likud and the Zionist Dream'', I.B.Tauris, 2001 p.177&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Special Operations Executive|British special operations]] during World War II.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Hugh Dalton letter to Lord Halifax 2/7/1940&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thefirstpost.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/5754,opinion,how-churchill-helped-britain-perfect-terrorism] article by Matthew Carr Author The Infernal Machine: A History of Terrorism {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081202161231/http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/5754,opinion,how-churchill-helped-britain-perfect-terrorism |date= December 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRA are considered by some the innovators of modern terrorism as the British would replicate and build upon the tactics used against by the IRA in World War II. [[Tony Geraghty]] in ''The Irish War: The Hidden Conflict Between the IRA and British Intelligence'' wrote:

{{quote|The Irish [thanks to the example set by Collins and followed by the SOE] can thus claim that their resistance provide the originating impulse for resistance to tyrannies worse than any they had to endure themselves. And the Irish resistance as Collins led it, showed the rest of the world an economical way to fight wars the only sane way they can be fought in the age of the Nuclear bomb.&lt;ref name=FootGeraghty&gt;Geraghty (1998), p.347&lt;/ref&gt;|[[M. R. D. Foot]], who wrote several official histories of SOE}}

From January 1939 to March 1940, the [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) carried out a campaign of bombing and [[sabotage]] against the civil, economic, and military infrastructure of Britain. It was known as the [[S-Plan|S-Plan or Sabotage Campaign]]. During the campaign, the IRA carried out almost 300 attacks and acts of sabotage in Britain, killing seven people and injuring 96.&lt;ref&gt;Dingley, James. ''The IRA: The Irish Republican Army''. ABC-CLIO, 2012. p.82&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the casualties occurred in the [[1939 Coventry bombing|Coventry bombing]] on 25 August 1939.

===Mandatory Palestine===
{{see also|Jewish insurgency in Palestine|1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|List of killings and massacres in Mandatory Palestine}}

Following the [[1929 Hebron massacre]] of 67 Jews in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], the [[Zionism|Zionist]] militia [[Haganah]] transformed itself into a paramilitary force. In 1931, however, the more militant [[Irgun]] broke away from Haganah, objecting to Haganah's policy of [[Havlagah|restraint]].&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. P. 212-213.&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by [[Avraham Tehomi]],&lt;ref&gt;Zadka, Saul.

''Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence. '' Berkeley, University of California Press, 2001. P. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Irgun sought to aggressively defend Jews from Arab attacks. Its tactic of attacking Arab communities, including the bombing of a crowded Arab market, is considered{{by whom|date=October 2017}} among the first examples of terrorism directed against civilians.&lt;ref name=hoffman1998-26&gt;Hoffman 1998, P. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;
After the British, in the [[White Paper of 1939]], placed severe restrictions on Jewish immigration into Palestine and set forth a vision of a single state with an Arab majority,&lt;ref&gt;Ehud Sprinzak, [https://books.google.com/books?id=M23n0qDTvkQC&amp;pg=PA35 ''Brother Against Brother: Violence and Extremism in Israeli Politics from Altalena to the Rabin Assassination,''] Simon and Schuster, 1999 p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; the Irgun began a campaign against British rule by assassinating police, capturing British government buildings and arms, and sabotaging British railways.&lt;ref name="Sachar, Howard 2007.

The bombing, in 1946, killed ninety-one people and injured forty-six, making it the most deadly attack during the Mandate era. This attack was sharply condemned by the organized leadership of the Yishuv, and further widened the gulf between [[David Ben-Gurion]]'s [[Hagana]] and Begin's Irgun. Following the bombing, Ben-Gurion called Irgun an "enemy of the Jewish people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.jpost.com/Features/In-Thespotlight/This-Week-in-History-The-King-David-Hotel-bombing|title= This Week in History: The King David Hotel bombing|date= |work= The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com|accessdate= 27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tclarke81"&gt;[[Thurston Clarke|Clarke, Thurston]].

Operating in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] in the 1930s, [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam]] (1882–1935) organized and established the [[Black Hand (Palestine)|Black Hand]], a Palestinian nationalist militia. He recruited and arranged military training for [[peasant]]s, and by 1935 had enlisted between 200 and 800 men. Al-Qassam obtained a [[fatwa]] from Shaykh Badr al-Din al-Taji al-Hasani, the [[Mufti]] of [[Damascus]], authorizing armed resistance against the British and against the Jews of Palestine. Black Hand cells were equipped with bombs and firearms, which they used to kill Jews.&lt;ref name=segev&gt;{{cite book |last= Segev |first= Tom |authorlink= Tom Segev |title= One Palestine, Complete |year= 1999 |publisher= Metropolitan Books |isbn= 0-8050-4848-0 |pages= 360–362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shai Lachman, "Arab Rebellion and Terrorism in Palestine 1929-39: The Case of Sheikh Izz al-Din al-Qassam and His Movement", in ''Zionism and Arabism in Palestine and Israel'', edited by Elie Kedourie and Sylvia G.

The [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades]], the military wing of [[Hamas]], as well as the [[Qassam rocket|rockets]] they developed, take their names after Qassam.

[[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] (''Lohamei Herut Yisrael'', a.k.a. "Freedom Fighters for Israel", a.k.a. the Stern Gang) was a [[Revisionist Zionism|revisionist Zionist]] group that splintered off from [[Irgun]] in 1940.&lt;ref name=hoffman1998-26/&gt; [[Abraham Stern]] formed Lehi from disaffected Irgun members after Irgun agreed to a truce with Britain in 1940.&lt;ref name="Sachar, Howard 2007.

''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. P. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; The act was controversial among Zionist militant groups, [[Hagannah]] sympathizing with the British and launching [[the Hunting Season|a massive man-hunt]] against members of Lehi and Irgun. After Israel's 1948 founding, Lehi formally dissolved and its members became integrated into the [[Israeli Defense Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;Pedahzur, Ami.

Some of the tactics of the [[Resistance during World War II|guerrilla, partisan, and resistance movements]] organised and supplied by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] during [[World War II]], according to historian M.

The work of the SOE received recognition in 2009 with a memorial in London, however there are differing views on the morality of the SOE's actions; the British military historian [[John Keegan]] wrote:
{{quote|We must recognise that our response to the scourge of terrorism is compromised by what we did through SOE. The justification&amp;nbsp;... That we had no other means of striking back at the enemy&amp;nbsp;... is exactly the argument used by the Red Brigades, the Baader-Meinhoff gang, the PFLP, the IRA and every other half-articulate terrorist organisation on Earth. Futile to argue that we were a democracy and Hitler a tyrant. Means besmirch ends. SOE besmirched Britain.&lt;ref&gt;

==Anti-colonial struggles (Cold War)==
After World War II, largely successful [[anti-imperialism|anti-colonial]] campaigns were launched against the collapsing European empires, as many World War II resistance groups became militantly anti-colonial. The [[Viet Minh]], for example, which had fought against the Japanese, now fought against the returning [[First Indochina War|French]] colonists. In the Middle East, the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] used bombings and assassinations against British rule in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Lia, Brynjar 2006. p.53"/&gt; Also during the 1950s, the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) in French-controlled Algeria and the [[EOKA]] in British-controlled Cyprus waged [[guerrilla]] and open war against colonial powers.&lt;ref name="Hoffman, Bruce 1998. p. 33"&gt;Hoffman 1998, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, inspired by [[Mao Zedong|Mao's]] Chinese revolution of 1949 and [[Fidel Castro|Castro's]] [[Cuban revolution]] of 1959, national independence movements often fused nationalist and [[socialism|socialist]] impulses. This was the case with Spain's [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], the [[Front de libération du Québec]], and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]]{{Clarify|date=April 2009}}.&lt;ref name="Chaliand, Gerard 2007. p.227"&gt;Chaliand, Gerard.

In the late 1960s and 1970s violent [[left-wing politics|left wing]] and revolutionary groups were on the rise, sympathizing with [[Third World]] guerrilla movements and seeking to spark anti-capitalist revolts. Such groups included the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]] in Turkey{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}, Armenia's [[ASALA]],&lt;ref name="Chaliand, Gerard 2007. p.227"/&gt; the [[Japanese Red Army]], the [[German Red Army Faction]], the [[Italian Red Brigades]], and, in the United States, the [[Weather Underground]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terrorism.about.com/od/originshistory/a/LeftWingTerror.htm|title=Where Did Left Wing Terrorism Go?|author=Amy Zalman|date=|work=About.com News &amp; Issues|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nationalist groups such as the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] and the [[Tamil tigers]] also began operations at this time.

Throughout the [[Cold War]], both the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] made extensive use of violent nationalist organizations to carry on a war by proxy. For example, Soviet and Chinese military advisers provided training and support to the [[Viet Cong]] during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam: A History, Stanley Karnow,1983&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union also provided military support to the [[PLO]] during the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/12/how-the-soviet-union-transformed-terrorism How the Soviet Union Transformed Terrorism]/250433/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fidel Castro]] during the [[Cuban Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/98822/Fidel-Castro|title=Fidel Castro|date=|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States funded groups such as the [[Contras]] in Nicaragua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/PS157/assignment%20files%20public/TOWER%20EXCERPTS.htm|title=Tower Commission Report Excerpts|date=|work=ucsb.edu|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Islamic Terrorism|violent Islamic militants]] of the late 20th and early 21st century had been funded in the 1980s by the United States and the UK because they were fighting the USSR in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;''The Power of Nightmares'', BBC, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crile|first=George|title=Charlie Wilson's War|publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press |year=2004|pages=111–112|isbn=0-8021-4124-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. P. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year, the group gained significant support for an uprising against loyalists in [[Philippeville]]. This uprising, and the heavy-handed response by the French, convinced many Algerians to support the FLN and the independence movement.{{Citation needed|date= March 2009}} The FLN eventually secured Algerian independence from France in 1962, and transformed itself into Algeria's ruling party.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, S.N.

The [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF) was a [[New Left]] group founded in 1968 by [[Andreas Baader]] and [[Ulrike Meinhof]] in West Germany. Inspired by [[Che Guevara]], Maoist socialism, and the [[Vietcong]], the group sought to raise awareness of the Vietnamese and Palestinian independence movements through kidnappings, taking embassies hostage, bank robberies, assassinations, bombings, and attacks on U.S. air bases. The group is best known for 1977's "[[German Autumn]]". The buildup leading to [[German Autumn]] began on April 7, when the RAF shot Federal Prosecutor [[Siegfried Buback]]. On July 30, it shot [[Jürgen Ponto]], then head of the Dresdner Bank, in a failed kidnapping attempt; on September 5, the group kidnapped [[Hanns Martin Schleyer]] (a former SS officer and an important West German industrialist), executing him on October 19.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenau, Bernhard.

The [[Red Brigades]] were a New Left group founded by [[Renato Curcio]] and [[Alberto Franceschini]] in 1970 that sought to create a revolutionary state. The group carried out a series of bombings and kidnappings until Curcio and Franceschini were arrested in the mid-1970s. Their successor as leader, [[Mario Moretti]], led the group toward more militarized and violent actions, including the kidnapping of former Prime Minister [[Aldo Moro]] on March 16, 1978. Moro was killed 56 days later. This led to an all-out assault on the group by Italian law enforcement and security forces and condemnation from Italian left-wing radicals and even imprisoned ex-leaders of the Brigades. The group lost most of its social support and public opinion turned strongly against it. In 1984, the group split, the majority faction becoming the Communist Combatant Party (Red Brigades-PCC) and the minority faction reconstituting itself as the Union of Combatant Communists (Red Brigades-UCC). Members of these groups carried out a handful of assassinations before almost all were arrested in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ed Vulliamy]], [http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/vinciguerra.p2.etc_graun_5dec1990.html Secret agents, freemasons, fascists... and a top-level campaign of political 'destabilisation'], ''[[The Guardian]]'', December 5, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Weather Underground]] (a.k.a. the Weathermen) began as a militant faction of the leftist [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) organization, and in 1969 took over the organization. Weathermen leaders, inspired by China's [[Maoism|Maoists]], the [[Black Panthers]], and the [[May 1968 in France|1968 student revolts in France]], sought to raise awareness of its revolutionary anti-capitalist and anti-[[Vietnam War]] platform by destroying symbols of government power. From 1969 to 1974 the Weathermen bombed corporate offices, police stations, and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] government sites such as the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]]. After the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, most of the group disbanded.&lt;ref name="The Weather Underground"&gt;''[[The Weather Underground (film)|The Weather Underground]]'', produced by Carrie Lozano, directed by Bill Siegel and Sam Green, New Video Group, 2003, DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Japanese Red Army]] was founded by [[Fusako Shigenobu]] in Japan in 1971 and attempted to overthrow the Japanese government and start a world revolution. Allied with the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP), the group committed assassinations, hijacked a commercial Japanese aircraft, and sabotaged a Shell oil refinery in Singapore. On May 30, 1972, [[Kōzō Okamoto]] and other group members launched a machine gun and grenade attack at Israel's Lod Airport in Tel Aviv, killing 26 people and injuring 80 others.

===Africa===
In Kenya, because of the seeming ongoing failure of the Kenyan African Union to obtain political reforms from the British through peaceful means, radical activists within the KAU set up a splinter group and organised a more militant kind of nationalism. By 1952 The Mau Mau consisted of Kikuyu fighters, along with some Embu and Meru recruits. The Mau Mau carried out attacks on political opponents, loyalist villages, raiding white settler farms and destroying livestock. The British colonial administration declared a state of emergency and British forces were sent to Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1952/oct/21/mau-mau-terrorism-in-kenya|title=MAU MAU TERRORISM IN KENYA|date=|work=millbanksystems.com|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of fighting was between loyalist and Mau Mau Kikuyu, so many scholars today now consider it a Kikuyu civil war.

[[Aum Shinrikyo]], now known as Aleph, was a Japanese [[New religious movement|religious group]] founded by [[Shoko Asahara]] in 1984 as a yogic meditation group. Later, in 1990, Asahara and 24 other members campaigned for election to the House of Representatives under the banner of Shinri-tō (Supreme Truth Party). None were voted in, and the group began to militarize. Between 1990 and 1995, the group attempted several apparently unsuccessful [[biological terrorism|violent attacks]] using the methods of [[biological warfare]], using [[Botulinum toxin|botulin toxin]] and [[anthrax]] spores.&lt;ref name=olson/&gt; On June 28, 1994, Aum Shinrikyo members released sarin gas from several sites in the Kaichi Heights neighborhood of [[Matsumoto, Nagano|Matsumoto]], Japan, killing eight and injuring 200 in what became known as the [[Matsumoto incident]].&lt;ref name=olson&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol5no4/olson.htm CDC website], [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], ''Aum Shinrikyo: Once and Future Threat?'', Kyle B.

In May 1995, Asahara and other senior leaders were arrested and the group's membership rapidly decreased.

In 1985, [[Air India Flight 182]] flying from Canada was blown up by a bomb while in Irish airspace, killing 329 people, including 280 Canadian citizens, mostly of Indian birth or descent, and 22 Indians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/airindia/victims.html In Depth: Air India] http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/memorial-for-air-india-victims-unveiled-1.681526 – The Victims, CBC News Online, 16 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was the deadliest act of air terrorism before 9/11, and the first bombing of a 747 Jumbo Jet which would set a pattern for future air terrorism plots. The crash occurred within an hour of the fatal [[1985 Narita International Airport bombing|Narita Airport Bombing]] which also originated from Canada without the passenger for the bag that exploded on the ground. Evidence from the explosions, witnesses and wiretaps of militants pointed to an attempt to actually blow up two airliners simultaneously by members of the [[Babbar Khalsa]] [[Khalistan movement]] militant group based in Canada to punish India for [[Operation Blue Star|attacking the Golden Temple]].

The [[Iranian Embassy siege]] took place in 1980, after a group of six armed men stormed the [[Embassy of Iran, London|Iranian embassy]] in [[South Kensington]], London. The government ordered the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS), a [[special forces]] regiment of the British Army, to conduct an assault—Operation Nimrod—to rescue the remaining hostages. This response set the tone for how Western governments would respond to terrorism.

The [[Moscow theatre hostage crisis]] was the seizure of a crowded [[Moscow]] theatre on 23 October 2002 by some 40 to 50 armed [[Chechen people|Chechens]] who claimed allegiance to the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Islamist militant separatist movement in Chechnya]]. They took 850 hostages and demanded the withdrawal of Russian forces from [[Chechnya]] and an end to the [[Second Chechen War]]. The siege was officially led by [[Movsar Barayev]]. After a two-and-a-half-day siege, Russian [[Spetsnaz]] forces pumped an [[Moscow hostage crisis chemical agent|unknown chemical agent]] (thought to be fentanyl, [[3-methylfentanyl]]), into the building's [[Mechanical ventilation|ventilation]] system and raided it.&lt;ref name="today"&gt;[http://www.russiatoday.ru/spotlight/release/830/video Modest Silin, Hostage, Nord-Ost siege, 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626022037/http://www.russiatoday.ru/spotlight/release/830/video |date=2008-06-26 }}, [[Russia Today]], 27 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, 39 of the attackers were killed by Russian forces, along with at least 129 and possibly many more of the hostages (including nine foreigners).

On September 1, 2004, in what became known as the [[Beslan school hostage crisis]], 32 Chechen separatists took 1,300 children and adults hostage at [[Beslan]]'s School Number One. When Russian authorities did not comply with the rebel demands that Russian forces withdraw from Chechnya, 20 adult male hostages were shot. After two days of stalled negotiations, Russian special forces stormed the building. In the ensuing melee, over 300 hostages died, along with 19 Russian servicemen and all but perhaps one of the rebels. Basayev is believed to have participated in organizing the attack.&lt;ref name="g"&gt;{{cite news | title=Shamil Basayev – Chechen politician seeking independence through terrorism | author=Jonathan Steele | publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]] | work=Obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/chechnya/Story/0,,1817558,00.html |date=July 11, 2006 | accessdate= |quote=one-time guerrilla commander who turned into a mastermind of spectacular and brutal terrorist actions ... served for several months as prime minister | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=April 2009}}.

The [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] (often referred to as 7/7) were a series of coordinated suicide bomb attacks in central London which targeted civilians using the public transport system during the morning rush hour. On the morning of Thursday, 7 July 2005, four Islamist extremists separately detonated three bombs in quick succession aboard London Underground trains across the city and, later, a fourth on a double-decker bus in Tavistock Square. Fifty-two civilians were killed and over 700 more were injured in the attacks. Later a dozen unexploded bombs were found in a car located in North London. 3 out of the 4 suspects were identified Mohammed Silique Khan, Germaine Morris Lindsay, Shahzad Tawnier where they are found to be in cohorts with Osama Bin Laden and eventually documents are leaked showing that Osama bin laden and Rashid Ruff planned the London bombings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/06/world/europe/july-7-2005-london-bombings-fast-facts/|title=July 7 2005 London Bombings Fast Facts|first=CNN|last=Library|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway in 2011 two sequential lone wolf terrorist attacks by right-wing extremist Anders Behring Breivik were carried out against the government, the civilian population, and a Workers' Youth League (AUF)-run summer camp in Norway on 22 July 2011. The attacks claimed a total of 77 lives. The first part of the attack was a van bomb in Oslo. The van was placed in front of the office block housing the office of Prime Minister and other government buildings. The explosion killed eight people and injured at least 209 people, twelve of them seriously. He followed this attack by impersonating a police officer to access the island on which the AUF summer camp was being held and proceeded to go on a shooting spree that killed 69 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/07/29/norway.attacks/|title=Norway honors victims of terrorist attacks|date=|work=cnn.com|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the British government branded the [[murder of Lee Rigby|killing of a serviceman]] in a [[Woolwich]] street, a terrorist attack. One of his attackers made political statements which were later broadcast with blood still on his hands from the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/update/2013-05-22/exclusive-video-man-with-bloodied-hands-speaks-at-woolwich-scene/|title=Exclusive video: Man with bloodied hands speaks at Woolwich scene|date=|work=ITV News|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two men responsible for the attack remained on the scene until incapacitated by armed police.

On 13 November, 28 hours after the [[2015 Beirut bombings|Beirut attack]], three groups of ISIS terrorists performed mass killings in various places in Paris' Xe and XIe arrondissements. They killed a total of more than 130 citizens. Hostages were taken in the concert hall "Le Bataclan" for three hours, and ninety were killed before the special police entered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11999723/Paris-terror-attacks-La-Belle-Equipe-survivor-so-traumatised-she-cant-speak.html] https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11999723/Paris-terror-attacks-La-Belle-Equipe-survivor-so-traumatised-she-cant-speak.html&lt;/ref&gt; The president immediately started the emergency threat procedure, for the first time on the entire French territory since the Algeria events in 1960.

On March 22, 2016 yet another terrorist attack happened within the confines of Europe. Three nail bombs went off at the same time in Belgium, two happened at Brussels Airport in Zaventem approximately 40 seconds apart. The other nail bomb was at Maalbeck metro station also in Brussels about an hour after the airport attacks The act was carried out by 3 suicide bombers, killing 31 people and injuring 300 people in the process. The three men were claimed as members of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria known as ISIS.  The third nail bomb at the metro station failed to explode during the terrorist act that Tuesday and was safely deactivated. The two men who hit the Brussels Airport were brothers Ibrahim El Bakraoui and Khalid El Bakraoui while a third person was with them  Najim Laachraoui who was believed to be the bomb maker also died, the suspect who had the bomb at the metro station has not yet been identified. The Brothers were both killed during the explosions along with the bomb maker, while the unidentified terrorist fled for he had the bomb that did not explode in the metro station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/03/23/belgian-state-tv-names-brussels-attack-suspects/82153446/|title=One 35-pound bomb in Brussels attack failed to go off; suicide note found|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brussels responded to this attack with a level 4 alert the highest it had had since the Paris attacks mentioned above. World leaders responded by unifying and offering their aid along with sorrows for the tragedy that happened there on March 22, 2016. 28 heads of state in the European union agreed to fight the War on Terror to better and protect the Union.

The United States responded to the attacks by launching the [[War on Terror]]. Specifically, on October 7, 2001, it invaded Afghanistan to depose [[the Taliban]], which had harbored al-Qaeda terrorists. On October 26, 2001, the U.S. enacted the [[USA PATRIOT Act|Patriot Act]] that expanded the powers of U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Many countries followed with similar legislation. Under the Obama administration, the U.S. changed tactics moving away from ground combat with large numbers of troops, to the use of drones and special forces. This campaign eliminated much of al-Qaeda's most senior members, including a strike by [[Seal Team Six]] that resulted in the death of Osama Bin Laden in 2011.

As the Islamic state of Syria and Iraq increases in size and power their attacks are affecting all parts of the world even in their own back yard of Turkey. Taking place in [[Istanbul]] a suicide bomber once again detonated a car bomb killing 4 people and injuring 31. No extremist group took responsibility for the attack but the attacker Mehmet Ozturk was linked to have ties with ISIS. This was just days after the car bomb attack in Turkeys capital of Ankara killing 37 people. The U.S. security council asked for the repeated terror attacks on Turkey to stop, and that the War on Terror will just become stronger due actions like these killing innocent people. Since the attacks Israel has requested that its citizens not travel to Turkey unless its necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/20/europe/turkey-blast/|title=Istanbul bomber had ISIS links, minister says|first=Gul Tuysuz, Faith Karimi and Greg Botelho,|last=CNN|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, 2016 a series of terrorist attacks took place in [[Jakarta, Indonesia]] resulting in 8 dead. The responsibility of these attacks were claimed by ISIS Counter terrorism has named this type of attack 'Marauding Terrorist Firearms Attack' because of the fast reaction needed by local policemen to stop the gunfire attack from the terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35309195,&lt;/ref&gt; The attack on Jakarta is linked to a bigger picture of terror in the Indonesian country for those of ISIS. Indonesia is home of the "largest regional terror groups" housing seven Islamist extremist groups. Leaving the thoughts that ISIS is trying to establish a satellite city in Indonesia, due to the fact that it has the largest Muslim population. Although ISIS branches have not yet reached the land of Southeast Asia in big masses, there is the fear that it is only a matter of time until Indonesias small extremist groups grow in masses once direct contact with ISIS is made. Once contact is established [[local terror groups]] will quickly mobilize to carry out the tasks that ISIS asks of them. ISIS will turn to Southeast Asia because it is only evident that they will lose control of the middle east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atimes.com/2016/01/jakarta-terror-attacks-will-parts-of-southeast-asia-become-isis-satellite-cities/|title=Jakarta terror attacks: Will parts of Southeast Asia become ISIS’ satellite cities?|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americas===
2001 also saw the second acknowledged act of [[bioterrorism]] with the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] (the first being [[1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack|intentional food poisoning]] conducted in [[The Dalles, Oregon]] by [[Rajneesh movement|Rajneeshee]] followers in 1984), when letters carrying anthrax spores were posted to several major American media outlets and two [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politicians. This resulted in several of the first fatalities attributed to a bioterror attack.

The more recent terrorist attack in the United States have included the [[2015 San Bernardino attack]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/06/us/san-bernardino-shooter-tashfeen-malik/|title=Tashfeen Malik, the San Bernardino shooter: Who was she? - CNN|first=Pat St. Claire, Greg Botelho and Ralph Ellis,|last=CNN|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Bombing of Boston Marathon by Islamic terrorists, the shooting of police officers in sniper ambushes by members of Black Lives Matter movement, and the shooting of multiple black parishioners at church and car attack on anti-fascist protesters in Charlottesville by right-wing extremists and white supremacists. There have been calls by some analysts to describe violence committed by [[incel]]s as terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/incel-what-is-involuntary-celibates-elliot-rodger-alek-minassian-canada-terrorism-a8335816.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2018/04/incel-online-cult-sad-sexless-young-men-terrorism-any-other-name&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminal procedure (trial)}}
'''Inevitable discovery''' is a doctrine in the [[United States]] criminal procedure that allows evidence of a [[defendant]]'s guilt that would otherwise be considered inadmissible under the [[exclusionary rule]] to be admitted into evidence in a [[trial]].

The doctrine was adopted first by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Nix v. Williams]]'' in 1984.  It holds that evidence obtained in violation of the defendant's constitutional rights is admissible in court if it can be established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that normal [[police investigation]] would have inevitably led to the discovery of the evidence.  The rationale for the rule is that [[police misconduct]] is sufficiently deterred and the interests of society are better served by putting police in the same position that they would have been in without the rights violation, not a worse position.&lt;ref&gt;Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 443–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{rquote|right|The fundamental error of modern times lies in the fact that the '''yawning abyss of quality in the difference between God and man''' has been removed. The result in dogmatic theology is a mockery of God ...|[[Søren Kierkegaard]]|''Journals'', November 20, 1847&lt;ref name="Journals1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kierkegaard |first=Søren |authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard |others=translated by Alexander Dru |title=Journals of Søren Kierkegaard |publisher=Oxford |date=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/div&gt;

The '''infinite qualitative distinction''' ({{lang-da|den uendelige kvalitative forskel}}; {{lang-de|unendliche qualitative Unterschied}}), sometimes translated as '''infinite qualitative difference''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Søren |last=Kierkegaard |title=Training in Christianity, and the Edifying discourse which 'accompanied' it |url=https://books.google.com/?id=T9BXAAAAYAAJ |date=1941 |others=Transl. by [[Walter Lowrie (author)|Walter Lowrie]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=T9BXAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22the+infinite+qualitative+difference+between+God+and+man%22 139 ("the infinite qualitative difference between God and man")]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a concept coined by the Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]]. The distinction emphasizes the very different attributes of finite and temporal men and the infinite and eternal qualities of a supreme being. This concept fits into the [[apophatic theology#20th_century|apophatic theology]] tradition and therefore is fundamentally at odds with theological theories which posit a supreme being able to be fully understood by man. The theologian [[Karl Barth]] made the concept of infinite qualitative distinction a cornerstone of his theology.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, 2006, pp. 225-227&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
For Kierkegaard, direct communication with God is impossible, as the idea of God and man are infinitely different. He argues that indirect communication with God is the only way of communication. For example, in [[Christian]] belief, the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] posits that [[Jesus Christ]] is God incarnate. The infinite qualitative distinction is opposed to rational theology in the sense that, whereas the latter argues one can prove empirically Jesus is God incarnate, the former argues that [[empirical evidence]] is ultimately insufficient in making that conclusion. The paradoxical nature of the Incarnation, that God is embodied in a man, is offensive to reason, and can only be comprehended indirectly, through [[faith]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorrien, Gary. ''The Barthian revolt in modern theology''. Westminster Press, 1999. p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barth's book ''[[The Epistle to the Romans (Barth)|The Epistle to the Romans]]'' also emphasizes such a gulf. In the preface to the Second Edition of his commentary, Barth writes, "if I have a system, it is limited to a recognition of what Kierkegaard called the 'infinite qualitative distinction' between time and eternity, and to my regarding this as possessing negative as well as positive significance: 'God is in heaven, and thou art on earth'. The relation between such a God and such a man, and the relation between such a man and such a God, is for me the theme of the Bible and the essence of philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Karl |last=Barth |authorlink=Karl Barth |title=The Epistle to the Romans |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dCEDzQhI4R4C&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=1968 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=3OrYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22if+I+have+a+system,+it+is+limited+to+a+recognition+of+what+Kierkegaard+called+the+'+infinite+qualitative+distinction+'+between+time+and+eternity,+and+to+my+regarding+this+as+possessing+negative+as+well+as+positive+significance%22 1933] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19500294-6 |id={{ISBN|978-0-195-00294-2}} |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=dCEDzQhI4R4C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=%22if+I+have+a+system,+it+is+limited+to+a+recognition+of+what+Kierkegaard+called+the+'+infinite+qualitative+distinction+'+between+time+and+eternity,+and+to+my+regarding+this+as+possessing+negative+as+well+as+positive+significance%22 10]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kierkegaard doesn't believe God is so objective toward human beings but rather that he is the absolute subjective being. He put it this way in 1846: {{Quotation|The subjective thinker is a dialectician dealing with the existential, and he has the passion of thought requisite for holding fast to the qualitative disjunction. But on the other hand, if the qualitative is applied in empty isolation, if it is applied to the individual in an altogether abstract fashion, one may risk saying something infinitely decisive and be quite correct in what one says, and yet, ludicrously enough, say nothing at all. Hence it is a psychologically noteworthy phenomenon, that the absolute disjunction may be used quite disingenuously, precisely for the purpose of evasion. When the death-penalty is affixed to every crime, it ends in no crime being punished at all.  So also in the case of the injunction. Applied abstractly it becomes an unpronounceable mute letter, or if pronounced, it says nothing. The subjective thinker has the absolute disjunction ready to hand; therefore, as an essential existential moment he holds it fast with a thinker’s passion, but he holds it as a last decisive resort, to prevent everything from being reduced to merely quantitative differences. He holds it in reserve, but does not apply it so as by recurring to it abstractly to inhibit existence. Hence the subjective thinker adds to his equipment aesthetic and ethical passion, which gives him the necessary concreteness. All existential problems are passionate problems, for when existence is interpenetrated with reflection it generates passion.

[[File:PolygonsSetIntersection.svg|thumb|Example of an intersection with sets]]
The intersection of two sets ''A'' and ''B'', denoted by {{math|''A'' ∩ ''B''}}, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}.
In symbols,

:&lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \{ x: x \in A \text{ and } x \in B\}.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, ''x'' is an element of the intersection ''A'' ∩ ''B'' [[if and only if]] ''x'' is both an element of ''A'' and an element of ''B''.

For example:
* The intersection of the sets {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3, 4} is {2, 3}.
* The number 9 is {{em|not}} in the intersection of the set of [[prime number]]s {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...} and the set of [[odd numbers]] {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ...}, because 9 is not prime.

Intersection is an [[associative]] operation; that is, for any sets ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'', one has ''A'' ∩ (''B'' ∩ ''C'')&amp;nbsp;= (''A'' ∩ ''B'') ∩ ''C''.  Intersection is also [[Commutative property|commutative]]; for any ''A'' and ''B'', one has ''A'' ∩ ''B''&amp;nbsp;= ''B'' ∩ ''A.''  It thus makes sense to talk about intersections of multiple sets.  The intersection of ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'', for example, is unambiguously written ''A'' ∩ ''B'' ∩ ''C'' ∩ ''D''.

Inside a universe ''U'' one may define the [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] ''A''&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; of ''A'' to be the set of all elements of ''U'' not in ''A''. Now the intersection of ''A'' and ''B'' may be written as the complement of the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of their complements, derived easily from [[De Morgan's laws]]:&lt;br&gt;
''A'' ∩ ''B'' = (''A''&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; ∪ ''B''&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;

===Intersecting and disjoint sets===
We say that ''A intersects (meets) B at an element x'' if ''x'' belongs to ''A'' and ''B''. We say that ''A intersects (meets) B'' if ''A'' intersects B at some element. ''A'' intersects ''B'' if their intersection is [[inhabited set|inhabited]].

We say that ''A and B are disjoint'' if ''A'' does not intersect ''B''. In plain language, they have no elements in common. ''A'' and ''B'' are disjoint if their intersection is [[empty set|empty]], denoted &lt;math&gt;A\cap B=\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, the sets {1, 2} and {3, 4} are disjoint, while the set of even numbers intersects the set of [[Multiple (mathematics)|multiples]] of 3 at the multiples of 6.

==Arbitrary intersections==

The most general notion is the intersection of an arbitrary ''nonempty'' collection of sets.
If ''M'' is a [[empty set|nonempty]] set whose elements are themselves sets, then ''x'' is an element of the ''intersection'' of ''M'' if and only if [[universal quantification|for every]] element ''A'' of ''M'', ''x'' is an element of ''A''.
In symbols:

:&lt;math&gt;\left( x \in \bigcap_{A \in M} A \right) \Leftrightarrow \left( \forall A \in M, \ x \in A \right).&lt;/math&gt;

The notation for this last concept can vary considerably. [[Set theory|Set theorists]] will sometimes write "⋂&lt;!--U+22C2--&gt;''M''", while others will instead write "⋂&lt;!--U+22C2--&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''A''∈''M''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;''A''".
The latter notation can be generalized to "⋂&lt;!--U+22C2--&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;", which refers to the intersection of the collection {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;: ''i''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''I''}.
Here ''I'' is a nonempty set, and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a set for every ''i'' in ''I''.

In the case that the [[index set]] ''I'' is the set of [[natural number]]s, notation analogous to that of an [[infinite product]] may be seen:

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i.&lt;/math&gt;

When formatting is difficult, this can also be written "''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∩ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∩ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∩ ...".  This last example, an intersection of countably many sets, is actually very common; for an example see the article on [[sigma algebra|σ-algebras]].

==Nullary intersection==

[[File:Multigrade operator AND.svg|thumb|[[Logical conjunction|Conjunctions]] of the arguments in parentheses&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The conjunction of no argument is the [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] (compare: [[empty product]]); accordingly the intersection of no set is the [[universe (set theory)|universe]].]]
Note that in the previous section we excluded the case where ''M'' was the [[empty set]] (∅). The reason is as follows: The intersection of the collection ''M'' is defined as the set (see [[set-builder notation]])
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{A \in M} A = \{x : \forall A \in M, x \in A\}.&lt;/math&gt;
If ''M'' is empty there are no sets ''A'' in ''M'', so the question becomes "which ''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s satisfy the stated condition?" The answer seems to be ''every possible x''. When ''M'' is empty the condition given above is an example of a [[vacuous truth]]. So the intersection of the empty family should be the [[universal set]] (the [[identity element]] for the operation of intersection) &lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, according to standard ([[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]]) set theory, the universal set does not exist. A fix for this problem can be found if we note that the intersection over a set of sets is always a subset of the union over that set of sets. This can symbolically be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{A \in M} A \subseteq \bigcup_{A \in M} A.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, we can modify the definition slightly to
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{A \in M} A = \left\{x \in \bigcup_{A \in M} A : \forall A \in M, x \in A\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
Now if ''M'' is empty there is no problem. The intersection is the empty set, because the union over the empty set is the empty set. In fact, this is the operation that we would have defined in the first place if we were defining the set in ZFC, as except for the operations defined by the axioms (the [[power set]] of a set, for instance), every set must be defined as the subset of some other set or by [[Axiom schema of replacement | replacement]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5074">The '''Kiyotaki–Moore model of credit cycles''' is an [[economic model]] developed by [[Nobuhiro Kiyotaki]] and [[John Hardman Moore|John H. Moore]] that shows how small [[Shock (economics)|shock]]s to the economy might be amplified by [[Credit (finance)|credit]] restrictions, giving rise to large [[business cycle|output fluctuations]]. The model assumes that borrowers cannot be forced to repay their debts. Therefore, in equilibrium, lending occurs only if it is [[Collateral (finance)|collateralized]]. That is, borrowers must own a sufficient quantity of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] that can be confiscated in case they fail to repay. This collateral requirement amplifies [[business cycle]] fluctuations because in a [[recession]], the income from capital falls, causing the price of capital to fall, which makes capital less valuable as collateral, which limits firms' investment by forcing them to reduce their borrowing, and thereby worsens the recession.

Kiyotaki (a [[macroeconomics|macroeconomist]]) and Moore (a [[contract theory|contract theorist]]) originally described their model in a 1997 paper in the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Nobuhiro |last=Kiyotaki |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=John |last2=Moore |year=1997 |title=Credit Cycles |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=211–248 |doi=10.1086/262072 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their model has become influential because earlier [[real business cycle]] models typically relied on large [[exogenous]] shocks to account for fluctuations in [[Aggregate data|aggregate]] [[Output (economics)|output]]. The Kiyotaki–Moore model shows instead how relatively small shocks might suffice to explain business cycle fluctuations, if credit markets are imperfect.

==Structure of the model==
In their model economy, Kiyotaki and Moore assume two types of [[Agent (economics)|decision makers]], with different [[time preference]] rates: "patient" and "impatient." The "patient" agents are called "gatherers" in the original paper, but should be interpreted as [[households]] that wish to [[Saving|save]]. The "impatient" agents are called "farmers" in the original paper, but should be interpreted as [[entrepreneur]]s or [[firm]]s that wish to borrow in order to finance their [[investment]] projects.

Two key assumptions limit the effectiveness of the credit market in the model. First, the knowledge of the "farmers" is an essential input to their own investment projects—that is, a project becomes worthless if the farmer who made the investment chooses to abandon it. Second, farmers cannot be forced to work, and therefore they cannot sell off their future labor to guarantee their debts. Together, these assumptions imply that even though farmers' investment projects are potentially very valuable, lenders have no way to confiscate this value if farmers choose not to pay back their debts.

Therefore, loans will only be made if they are backed by some other form of capital which can be confiscated in case of [[Default (finance)|default]]. In other words, loans must be backed by [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]. Kiyotaki and Moore's paper considers [[Land (economics)|land]] as an example of a [[Collateral (finance)|collateralizable asset]]. Thus land plays two distinct roles in the model: (i) it is a productive input, and (ii) it also serves as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] for debt.

Hence, impatient agents must provide real estate as collateral if they wish to borrow. If for any reason the value of real estate declines, so does the amount of debt they can acquire. This feeds back into the real estate market, driving the price of land down further (thus, the borrowing decisions of the impatient agents are [[strategic complements]]). This [[positive feedback]] is what amplifies economic fluctuations in the model.

The paper also analyzes cases where debt contracts are set only in nominal terms or where contracts can be set in real terms, and considers the differences between the cases.

==Extensions==
The original paper of Kiyotaki and Moore was theoretical in nature, and made little attempt to evaluate the quantitative relevance of their mechanism for actual economies. In 2005, Kiyotaki's student [[Matteo Iacoviello]] embedded the Kiyotaki-Moore mechanism inside a standard [[New Keynesian]] [[DSGE|general equilibrium]] [[macroeconomic model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Matteo |last=Iacoviello |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2005 |title=House Prices, Borrowing Constraints, and Monetary Policy in the Business Cycle |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=739–764 |doi=10.1257/0002828054201477}}&lt;/ref&gt; For realism, Iacoviello assumed that the collateralizable form of capital corresponds to [[real estate]], and compared the predictions of his model with observed fluctuations of real housing prices in the United States.

'''Lightness''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] concept most closely associated with [[continental philosophy]] and [[existentialism]], which is used in [[ontology]]. The term "lightness" varies in usage but is differentiated from physical weight, such as "the lightness of balsa wood". In other words, "light like a bird," as [[Paul Valéry]] wrote, "and not like a feather". Lightness is also considered as a noun.

==Milan Kundera==

[[Milan Kundera]]'s 1984 novel ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]'' is an exploration of the concept of Lightness.

Kundera uses [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s doctrine of the [[Eternal Return]] to illustrate Lightness. Eternal Return dictates that all things in [[existence]] recur over and over again for all eternity. This is to say that human history is a preset circle without progress, the same events arising perpetually and doomed never to alter or to improve. Existence is thus weighty because it stands fixed in an infinite cycle. This weightiness is “the heaviest of burdens”, for “if every second of our lives recurs an infinite number of times, we are nailed to eternity as [[Jesus Christ]] was nailed to the cross.”  At the same time, it is necessary for any event to occur in the cycle of events exactly as it has always occurred for the cycle to be identical; consequently, everything takes on an eternally fixed meaning. This fact prevents one from believing things to be fleeting and worthless.

The inverse of this concept is Kundera's “unbearable lightness of being.”  Assuming that eternal return were impossible, humankind would experience an “absolute absence of burden,” and this would “[cause] man to be lighter than air” in his lack of weight of meaning. Something which does not forever recur has its brief existence, and, once it is complete, the universe goes on existing, utterly indifferent to the completed phenomenon.  “Life which disappears once and for all, which does not return” writes Kundera, is “without weight...and whether it was horrible, beautiful, or sublime...means nothing.” Each life is insignificant; every decision does not matter. Since decisions do not matter, they are "light": they do not tie us down. However, at the same time, the insignificance of our decisions - our lives, or being - is unbearable. Hence, "the unbearable lightness of being." On the other hand, eternal existence would demand of us strict adherence to prescripted rules and laws; a sense of duty and rigorous morality.
 
"What then shall we choose? Weight or lightness?" Kundera notes that this is not a new question. [[Parmenides]] posed it in the sixth century BC. He saw the world divided into pairs of opposites: light/darkness, fineness/coarseness etc. One half of the opposition he called positive (light, fineness, warmth, being), the other negative. We might find this division into positive and negative poles simple except for one difficulty: which one is positive, weight or lightness? Parmenides responded that lightness is positive, weight negative. Kundera then questions "Was he correct or not?" The lightness/weight opposition remains the most ambiguous of all. Kundera then asks, should one live with weight and duty or with lightness and freedom? In Nietzschean terms, weight is life-affirming in that to live with positive intensity is to live in a way you'd be prepared to repeat. The emptiness of Sabina's life in 'The Unbearable Lightness Of Being', and that she wanted to "die in lightness" — which is to say that she is indifferent to her life — shows that she would not want to repeat her life and would not accept an eternal return.

==Italo Calvino==

Similarly to Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]], for [[Italo Calvino]], Lightness is the flexible; the weightless; the mobile; the connective; vectors as distinct from structures. Italo Calvino explored Lightness in the first of his ''[[Six Memos for the Next Millennium]]''. He saw Lightness as an important aspect of post-modern society and existence that should be celebrated; he, like Heraclitus, never viewed Lightness as negative, indeed he never ascribed any evaluative content to it.

Calvino keenly explores the borderline between lightness and the superficial; he posits that a contemplative lightness may make light-heartnedness seem heavy and dim; the pursuit of lightness as a reaction to the dutifulness of life. 

Calvino emphasises that he does not intend to exclude or to define as inferior the opposite, as for example light/heavy, quick/slow; instant deduction is not necessarily better than well-considered thought, the case may be even contrary. It simply communicates something which is only emblematic of lightness. The balance or tension between the two 'poles' is an important aspect.

In ''Six Memos'' he says that "It is true that software cannot exercise its powers of lightness except through the weight of hardware. But it is the software that gives the orders, acting on the outside world and on machines that exist only as functions of software and evolve so that they can work out ever more complex programs. The second industrial revolution, unlike the first, does not present us with such crushing images as rolling mills and molten steel, but with 'bits' in a flow of information traveling along circuits in the form of electronic impulses. The iron machines still exist, but they obey the orders of weightless bits."

==Eastern philosophy==

The [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]] also deal with Lightness. Book 3 describes Lightness or [[Laghima]] as being one of the eight siddhis, or eight perfections: the capacity to offset the force of one's [[facticity]]. This is defined in relation to Pullness or [[Garima]], which concerns worldly weight and mass.

[[Zen Buddhism]] teaches that one ought to become as light as being itself. Zen teaches one not only to find the lightness of being “bearable,” but to rejoice in this lightness. This stands as an interesting opposition to Kundera's evaluation of Lightness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2813">'''Logical determinism''' is the view that a proposition about the future is either necessarily true, or its negation is necessarily true.  The argument for this is as follows. By [[excluded middle]], the future tense proposition (‘There will be a sea-battle tomorrow’) is either true now, or its negation is true. But what makes it (or its negation true) is the present existence of a [[State of affairs (philosophy)|state of affairs]] – a [[truthmaker]].&lt;ref&gt;Buckner and Zupko, ''Duns Scotus on Time and Existence'': The Questions on Aristotle's 'De interpretatione', translated with Introduction and Commentary by Edward Buckner and Jack Zupko, Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press, 2014, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt;  If so, then the future is determined in the sense that the way things are now – namely the state of affairs that makes ‘There will be a sea-battle tomorrow’ or its negation true  – determines the way that things will be. Furthermore, if the past is necessary, in the sense that a state of affairs that existed yesterday cannot be altered, then the state of affairs that made the proposition ‘There will be a sea-battle tomorrow’ true cannot be changed, and so the proposition or its negation is necessarily true, and it is either necessarily the case that there will be a sea-battle tomorrow, or necessarily ''not'' the case.  

The term ‘logical determinism’ (''Logischer Determinismus'') was introduced by [[Moritz Schlick]].&lt;ref&gt;(Schlick 1979 p. 202), cited in Woleński 1996&lt;/ref&gt; 

Logical determinism seems to present a problem for the conception of [[free will]] which requires that different courses of action are possible, for the sea-battle argument suggests that only one course is possible, because necessary. In trying to resolve the problem, the 13th century philosopher [[Duns Scotus]] argued in an early work that a future proposition can be understood in two ways: either as signifying something in reality that makes something be true in the future, or simply as signifying that something will be the case. The second sense is weaker in that it does not commit us to any ''present'' state of affairs that makes the future proposition true, only a ''future'' state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Buckner and Zupko, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Louise Bryant''' (December 5, 1885 – January 6, 1936) was an American [[feminist]], [[political activist]], and [[journalist]] best known for her sympathetic coverage of Russia and the [[Bolsheviks]] during the [[Russian Revolution]]. Bryant, who married fellow journalist [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]] (her second husband) in 1916, wrote about Russian leaders such as [[Catherine Breshkovsky|Katherine Breshkovsky]], [[Maria Spiridonova]], [[Alexander Kerensky]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], and [[Leon Trotsky]]. Her news stories, distributed by [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]] during and after her trips to [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] and Moscow, appeared in newspapers across the United States and Canada in the years immediately following [[World War I]]. A collection of articles from her first trip was published in 1918 as ''Six Red Months in Russia''. Over the next year, she defended the revolution in testimony before the [[Overman Committee]], a [[U.S. Senate|Senate]] subcommittee established to investigate Bolshevik influence in the United States. Later in 1919, she undertook a nationwide speaking tour to encourage public support of the Bolsheviks and to denounce [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|armed U.S. intervention in Russia]].

Born Anna Louise Mohan, as a young girl she began using the last name of her stepfather, Sheridan Bryant, in preference to that of her father. She grew up in rural [[Nevada]] and attended the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]] in [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] and the [[University of Oregon]] in [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], graduating with a degree in history in 1909. Pursuing a career in journalism, she became society editor of the ''Spectator'' and [[freelancer|freelanced]] for ''[[The Oregonian]]'', newspapers in [[Portland, Oregon]]. During her years in that city (1909–1915), she became active in the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] movement. Leaving her first husband in 1915 to follow Reed to [[Greenwich Village]], she formed friendships with leading feminists of the day, some of whom she met through Reed's associates at publications such as ''The Masses''; at meetings of a women's group, [[Heterodoxy (group)|Heterodoxy]]; and through work with the [[Provincetown Players]]. During a [[National Woman's Party]] suffrage rally in [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1919, she was arrested and spent three days in jail. Both she and Reed took lovers outside marriage; during her Greenwich Village years (1916–1920) for her these included the playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]] and the painter [[Andrew Dasburg]].

After Reed's death from [[typhus]] in 1920, Bryant continued to write for Hearst about Russia and also about Turkey, Hungary, Greece, Italy, and other countries in Europe and the Middle East. Some articles from this period were collected in 1923 under the title ''Mirrors of Moscow''. Later that year she married [[William Christian Bullitt Jr.|William C. Bullitt, Jr.]], with whom she had her only child, [[Anne Moen Bullitt|Anne]], the following year. Suffering in her later years from the rare and painful disorder [[adiposis dolorosa]], Bryant did little writing or publishing in her last decade, and drank heavily. Bullitt, winning sole custody of Anne, divorced Bryant in 1930. Bryant died in Paris in 1936 and was buried in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]]. In 1998, a group from Portland restored her grave, which had become neglected.

==Early life==
Anna Louise Mohan was born in 1885 in [[San Francisco]], California.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=9}} Her father, Hugh Mohan, born in [[Pennsylvania]], became a journalist and [[Stump speech (politics)|stump speaker]] involved in labor issues and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politics.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=10–11}} Moving to San Francisco, he continued to write for newspapers, and in 1880 he married Louisa Flick, who grew up on the ranch of her stepfather, James Say, near [[Lake Humboldt|Humboldt Lake]] in [[Nevada]]. The Mohans had two children, Barbara (1880) and Louis (1882), before the birth of Anna Louise.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=10–11}} Later in 1885, the family moved to [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], where Mohan continued his journalistic career but drank heavily. One day he departed and never returned to his wife and children. Louise's mother divorced him in 1889 and married Sheridan Bryant, a freight conductor on the [[Southern Pacific]] railway.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=12–17}} The couple had two children, Floyd (1894) and William (1896).{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=12–17}} Although the family lived in [[Wadsworth, Nevada]], Louise accepted an invitation from James Say to live at his ranch. She remained there for three or four years, returning to Wadsworth at her mother's insistence at the age of 12.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=12–17}} Bryant adopted her stepfather's last name,{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=15}} but never changed it legally from Mohan.{{sfn|Gelb|1973|p=37}}

Attending high school in Wadsworth and Reno and college at [[Nevada State University]] (now known as the University of Nevada, Reno), Bryant developed interests in journalism, debate, illustration, social life, dancing, and basketball.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=12–17}} She edited the "Young Ladies Edition" of the ''Student Record'' in 1905, wrote a short story, "The Way of a Flirt", for a literary magazine, ''Chuckwalla'', and contributed sketches to it and another publication, ''Artemisia''.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=22–24}} Depressed after the death of her step-grandfather in 1906, Bryant left school for a job in [[Jolon, California]], where for a few months she boarded at a cattle ranch and taught children, mostly young Mexicans.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=12–17}}  That summer she moved to [[Eugene, Oregon]], where her brother Louis worked for the [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=18}}

After learning that she could transfer her college credits from Nevada, she enrolled at the [[University of Oregon]], in Eugene.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=22–23}} Popular at the school, which then had a total student enrollment of less than 500,{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=22–23}} she helped start a small [[sorority]], Zeta Iota Phi (a chapter of [[Chi Omega]]),{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=19}} and served as its first president.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=22–23}} During her time in Eugene, she produced poems and pen-and-ink sketches for the ''Oregon Monthly''.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=22–23}} In a small city steeped in "puritan moralism",{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=22–23}} she was the first to wear [[Rouge (cosmetics)|rouge]] on campus; she had multiple boyfriends, and she wore clothes that [[Miriam Van Waters]], the editor of the ''Oregon Monthly'', and [[Luella Clay Carson]], the [[dean of women]], considered improper.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=22–24}} Taking off the spring semester of 1908 to teach in a one-room schoolhouse on [[Stuart Island (Washington)|Stuart Island]], one of the [[San Juan Islands]] near the U.S. border with Canada, she returned to Eugene to finish her bachelor's degree in history, graduating in early 1909. Her senior thesis was on the [[Modoc War|Modoc Indian Wars]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=18–22}}

==Portland==
In the spring of 1909, Bryant moved to Portland, first sharing a downtown apartment with one of her college friends, Clara Wold, then renting her own apartment in the same building.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=22–27}} Among her jobs, she designed a stained-glass window for the [[Povey Brothers Studio|Povey Brothers]],{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=22–27}} worked as a freelance reporter for ''[[The Oregonian]]'',&lt;ref name="Oregonian freelance"&gt;{{cite news|last=Perry|first=Douglas|title=Women's History Month: Revisiting Louise Bryant's Portland|newspaper=The Oregonian|location=Portland, Oregon|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2011/03/national_womens_history_month.html|date=March 1, 2011|access-date=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became an illustrator and society editor for the ''Portland Spectator'',{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=22–27}} a weekly news magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elbert Bede Will Edit 'Portland Spectator'|newspaper=Corvallis Gazette–Times|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/140874802/?terms=%22Portland%2BSpectator%22|date=January 15, 1938|page=1|via=Newspapers.com|subscription=yes|access-date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, she formed friendships with people—such as Cas Baer, drama editor for ''The Oregonian''—who were interested in journalism and the arts.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=22–27}} In late 1909, she met and married Paul Trullinger, a dentist who lived on a houseboat on the [[Willamette River]], collected art, and liked drinking parties that sometimes included invitations to his office to inhale [[ether]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=22–27}}

Bryant, who retained her maiden name and her downtown apartment after her marriage to Trullinger, bridled at doing housework and yearned for professional advancement. Drawn toward politics and the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage movement]] by her friend [[Sara Bard Field]], she joined the Oregon branch of the [[College Equal Suffrage League]] in 1912. She and Field gave pro-suffrage speeches in smaller Oregon cities, and Bryant rode on the suffrage float in Portland's annual [[Flag Day (United States)|Flag Day]] parade. Led by [[Abigail Scott Duniway]], women achieved suffrage in Oregon later that year.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=27–29}}

Bryant became familiar with the [[socialist]] journal ''[[The Masses]]'' through Portland resident and lawyer [[Charles Erskine Scott Wood|C. E. S. Wood]], who eventually married Field and who often contributed to the magazine.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=25–29}} Enthusiastic about its contents, particularly articles by Portland native [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]], Bryant began raising subscriptions for it.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=36–37}} [[Emma Goldman]], a well-known [[Anarchism|anarchist]] whom Wood had defended in court,{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=25–29}} gave a speech in Reed's honor at the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) hall in Portland.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=36–37}} She and other political activists, such as [[Alexander Berkman]], were among guests entertained by Bryant and her husband.&lt;ref name="Oregon Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|last=Munk|first=Michael|title=Louise Bryant (1885–1936)|publisher=Portland State University|work=The Oregon Encyclopedia|url=http://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/bryant_louise_1885_1936_//|accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, Reed, a [[Harvard University|Harvard]] graduate and established writer who by then lived in [[Greenwich Village]], came home for a visit, during which he spoke at the [[University Club (Portland, Oregon)|University Club]] of Portland against the [[Social class|class system]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=36–37}} Exactly how or when or how often Bryant and Reed met is uncertain, but near Christmas 1915 when Reed again came home to visit his widowed mother, the young couple announced their love at a dinner party.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=37–40}} Reed returned to Greenwich Village on December 28, and Bryant, abandoning her marriage, followed him three days later.&lt;ref name="Oregon Encyclopedia"/&gt; Trullinger filed for divorce, which was granted in July 1916, on grounds of desertion.{{sfn|Gelb|1973|p=104}}{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=56}}

==Greenwich Village and Cape Cod==
[[File:John Reed journalist.jpg|thumb|alt=Mid-length photograph of a man of about 25 in a jacket, tie, and fedora.|[[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]], {{Circa|1910–1915}}]] Reed had rented a room for Bryant near his apartment at 43 Washington Square.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=43}} Their unmarried co-habitation caused little curiosity among Reed's friends in the Village, many of whom rejected marriage and other middle-class norms.{{sfn|Gelb|1973|pp=76–77}} Unified by an "air of intellectual freedom, moral laissez-faire and camaraderie", most were involved in literary, artistic, or political pursuits in a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] neighborhood that in some ways resembled the [[Rive Gauche (Paris)|Left Bank]] of Paris.{{sfn|Gelb|1973|pp=76–77}} While visiting New York, Field took Bryant to a meeting of [[Heterodoxy (group)|Heterodoxy]], a women's group that included [[feminist]] [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], journalist [[Mary Heaton Vorse]], [[political activist]] [[Crystal Eastman]], actress [[Ida Rauh]], writers [[Zona Gale]] and [[Mary Austin]], and many others.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=44}} Among Bryant's new friends were feminists [[Inez Milholland]], [[Inez Haynes Irwin|Inez Gillmore]], and [[Doris Stevens]].{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=16}} Other notables circulating in the Village included Emma Goldman, playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]], and one of Reed's former lovers, arts patron [[Mabel Dodge Luhan|Mabel Dodge]].{{sfn|Gelb|1973|pp=78–79}}

At Number 43, Bryant and Reed pursued their journalistic endeavors in separate work rooms.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=14}} Four months after leaving Oregon, Bryant broke into print in New York with an article about two Portland judges, one of whom had dismissed a case brought against Goldman for distributing [[Birth control movement in the United States|birth-control information]]. It was published as "Two Judges" in the April 1916 issue of ''The Masses'', edited by [[Max Eastman]], Crystal Eastman's brother.&lt;ref name="Two Judges"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bryant|first=Louise|title=Two Judges|url=http://dlib.nyu.edu/themasses/books/masses060/18|journal=The Masses|publisher=The Masses Publishing Company|location=New York|via=New York University|date=April 1916|volume=8|number=6|page=18|accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Reed, who had reported on the [[1913 Paterson silk strike]], [[Pancho Villa]] in 1913–14, and the ongoing war (World War I) in Europe,{{sfn|Gelb|1973|pp=44–75}} went on assignment for ''[[Collier's]]'' to interview [[William Jennings Bryan]] in Florida.{{sfn|Gelb|1973|pp=80–81}}

Later that spring Bryant and Reed heeded Vorse's call to spend the warm season in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], at the tip of [[Cape Cod]], and to take part in the communal theater productions of the [[Provincetown Players]]. Others from the Village went as well and joined the group, organized in 1915 by [[George Cram Cook]] and his wife, [[Susan Glaspell]], who hoped to produce plays that were both political and artistic. Among the works the group staged in 1916 were Bryant's ''The Game'', in which characters named Life and Death play dice for the lives of Youth (a poet) and Girl (a dancer). It appeared on the same bill as ''Not Smart'' by [[Wilbur Daniel Steele|Wilbur Steele]] and ''Bound East for Cardiff'' by O'Neill.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=47–52}}

During the summer, Reed left Cape Cod to cover the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] convention in Chicago, and at other times he retreated from the players to work on articles for ''Collier's'' and ''[[Metropolitan Magazine (New York)|Metropolitan Magazine]]''. During these absences, Bryant and O'Neill became lovers, not surprising in a group that professed and practiced [[free love]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=52}} Reed, made aware of this new development, responded by inviting O'Neill to begin taking his meals with them.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=53–54}} In a note to Field, Bryant said that her relationship with Reed was "so beautiful and so free!... We don't ''interfere'' with each other at all...we feel like children who will never grow up."{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=55–56}}

==Croton-on-Hudson==
[[File:Europe Boardman Robinson.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A cartoon named "Europe 1916" depicts Death riding a donkey toward the edge of a cliff. Death holds a long stick from which dangles a carrot just out of reach of the skinny donkey. The carrot is labeled "Victory".| "Europe 1916", an anti-war cartoon by [[Boardman Robinson]], appeared in the October 1916 issue of ''The Masses'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Boardman|title=Europe 1916|url=http://dlib.nyu.edu/themasses/books/masses066/19|journal=The Masses|publisher=The Masses Publishing Company|location=New York|via=New York University|date=October 1916|volume=8|number=12|pages=18–19|accessdate=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a magazine for which Bryant had begun writing articles and poems that same year.]] After spending the month of September 1916 in a cottage they bought in [[Truro, Massachusetts|Truro]], Bryant and Reed returned to Greenwich Village, where the Provincetown Players planned to establish an alternative to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] theater. On weekends, they sojourned to [[Croton-on-Hudson, New York|Croton-on-Hudson]], upriver from New York City, where Villagers including Eastman, Dodge, and illustrator [[Boardman Robinson]] and his wife had cottages. In October, Bryant and Reed bought their own place in Croton-on-Hudson. Meanwhile, Reed, who had suffered from kidney ailments since childhood, was told by his doctors that he would need to have a kidney removed. The surgery, considered "gravely serious", was scheduled for mid-November. Reed wanted to protect Bryant by making her his legal heir,{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=58–59}} and they married on November 9 at the county clerk's office in [[Peekskill, New York|Peekskill]] before Reed left on November 12 for surgery at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in Baltimore.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=48–49}}

Compounding their difficulties were Bryant's ongoing relationship with O'Neill and gynecological problems she was treated for while Reed was in the hospital.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=60–62}} When he returned from Baltimore in mid-December, Reed and Bryant retreated full-time to Croton-on-Hudson to recuperate and to focus on writing. They made plans to travel to China in 1917 to cover events for American publications, but in January the plans fell through when U.S. entry into [[World War I]] against Germany became highly likely.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=62}} (The U.S. entered the war on April 6.){{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=64}} To boost their finances, they sold the cottage in Truro to [[Margaret Sanger]], and Reed pawned his father's gold watch.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=64}} At the same time, his strong anti-war positions, enunciated in ''The Masses'' and elsewhere, alienated most of his employers, further reducing his income.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=64}} Adding to these stresses was Reed's confession to Bryant that he had had multiple love affairs, and the subsequent unhappiness between Bryant and Reed led to a temporary separation. When she expressed a desire to go to Europe, he helped her convince [[John Neville Wheeler|John N. Wheeler]], who had recently formed the [[Bell Syndicate]], to issue her a [[press pass]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=65–67}} Reed paid for her passage,{{sfn|Gelb|1973|p=123}} and Bryant set sail in June to cover the war in France.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=65–67}} Regrets quickly followed. According to Bryant biographer Virginia Gardner:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No sooner had they parted on board the ship than both Reed and Bryant were assailed by misgivings. An outpouring of letters from either side of the Atlantic followed. Both were suffering, both were confused, lonely, and miserable... [The letters were] proof of the basically strong bond that held the two, the poet-reporter and social critic and the erratic, appealing woman he had rescued from the banality of middle-class existence in Portland.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=68}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the voyage across the Atlantic, Bryant interviewed ambulance-service troops and others on board the ''Espagne'' and wrote news stories about them and about the threat of [[torpedo]] attacks. When she arrived in Paris, Bryant tried for several weeks to obtain permission from French authorities to visit the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], but could not do so because of her limited journalistic experience and her sex.{{sfn|Gelb|1973|p=136}} She ended up collecting information about the war from as many sources as she could meet in Paris, and sent her news stories to Reed, who edited them and forwarded them to Wheeler.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=67–70}}

==Petrograd==
[[File:Breshkovskaya.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|right|alt=A grandmotherly woman of about 70 is seated, pen in hand, at a desk with a writing pad.|[[Catherine Breshkovsky|Katherine Breshkovsky]], "grandmother of the revolution", was among the women Bryant interviewed in 1917.]] In mid-August, when Bryant returned from France, Reed met her at the dock and told her to prepare to go to [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] four days later to cover the [[Russian Revolution]]. Eastman of ''The Masses'' had raised funds to pay Reed's travel expenses, and the Bell Syndicate assigned Bryant to report on the war "from a woman's point of view". Leaving New York on August 17, they arrived in Petrograd, which was then the capital of Russia, about six months after the forced abdication of the last Russian [[czar]], [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]. Headed by [[Alexander Kerensky]], the provisional government that had succeeded the czar had already survived an attempted [[coup d'etat|putsch]] by Major General [[Lavr Kornilov]]. Bryant and Reed entered the city after the [[Kornilov Affair]] and before the [[Bolsheviks]] overthrew the Kerensky government in the [[October Revolution]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=74–88}}

Reconciled as a couple, and working from their room at the [[Angleterre Hotel]], Bryant and Reed attended gatherings at the [[Smolny Institute]] and elsewhere in Petrograd and interviewed many leading political figures, including [[Lenin]], [[Trotsky]], and Kerensky, and both eventually compiled books—''Six Red Months in Russia'' by Bryant and Reed's ''Ten Days That Shook the World''—from their articles. Bryant circulated widely, covering [[Duma]] meetings, dining in public mess halls with soldiers and workers, and interviewing women revolutionaries. Among those were [[Catherine Breshkovsky|Katherine Breshkovsky]], known as the "grandmother of the revolution", [[Maria Spiridonova]], whom Bryant considered the most powerful woman in Russia, and [[Aleksandra Kollontai]], who became People's Commissar of Social Welfare and the only woman in the Bolshevik cabinet. In the process, Bryant, who had often been overshadowed by her more famous husband, gained confidence in her professional reporting skills.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=81–96}} By the time she returned to New York, her work was being read across North America. Gardner says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The] springtime of 1918 in the United States was a time of heightened contradictions. Openmindedness about the new Russian experiment in cities and the hinterland coexisted with the intensified patriotism of wartime... No matter what appeared in their editorial pages, newspaper editors knew that feature stories with first-hand knowledge of the Revolution sold papers. The conservative and Republican Philadelphia [[Public Ledger Syndicate|''Public Ledger'' syndicate]] bought Bryant's thirty-two stories and sold them to Hearst's ''New York American'' and to more than one hundred newspapers over the United States and Canada.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=134}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==New York==
Leaving Russia before Reed, who wanted to report on the Bolshevik debate about Russian participation in the war with Germany,{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=124}} Bryant returned to New York, arriving on February 18, 1918.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=126}} She found Greenwich Village much changed by the war: old friends had moved, rents had gone up, and tourists were replacing bohemians.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=126–29}} Under government pressure, ''The Masses'' had shut down.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=110}} Working out of a room at the Brevoort Hotel,{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=126}} Bryant wrote articles about the October Revolution and speeches or cables urging support of the workers' government in Russia.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=130–32}}

Meanwhile, Reed, who was trying to get home, was unable to get State Department clearance for a visa and was detained in [[Oslo]] (then called ''Christiana''), Norway, for more than a month.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=98}} His letters were censored, and Bryant did not hear from him directly until April.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=98}} On orders from [[Sisson Documents|Edgar Sisson]] of the U.S. Commission on Public Information, all of Reed's papers were confiscated when he arrived in New York on April 28.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=103–04}} Unable to write about the October Revolution without his notes, Reed instead gave speeches advocating U.S. recognition of the new Russian government. That summer, the couple retreated to Croton-on-Hudson.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=103–04}}

In August, during a long weekend in the arts colony at [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]], Bryant began what was to be a long-term, intermittent love affair with painter [[Andrew Dasburg]], with whom she had been close for a couple of years.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=108}} Returning to the Village in September, Bryant and Reed rented a small house at 1 [[Patchin Place]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=109}} Later in the month, Reed was arrested for giving a speech in which he denounced the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|use of Allied troops in Russia]]; the specific charge against him was that he had used "disloyal, scurrilous and abusive language about the Military and Naval Forces of the United States". He was released on $5,000 [[bail]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=110}} In separate cases that year, Reed stood trial with Eastman, [[Floyd Dell]], and others from the former staff of ''The Masses'' for conspiracy to obstruct [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]] of men to fight in World War I and for other alleged offenses related to published articles and cartoons; Reed's alleged crime in the latter case was that he had written a headline, "Knit a Strait-Jacket for Your Soldier Boy", for an article about mental illness among the U.S. troops.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=96, 110}} Bryant was questioned in ''The Masses'' cases but not charged. Both trials involving ''The Masses'' ended in [[hung jury|hung juries]], and the defendants were set free.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=110}} In October, Bryant's first book, ''Six Red Months in Russia'', was published to "mostly favorable reviews,"{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=112}} and Reed resumed work on ''Ten Days That Shook the World'' after the government returned his notes.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=146}} It would not be published until April 1919.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=139}}

In February 1919, while still based in New York, Bryant went to Washington, D.C., to speak, along with [[Albert Rhys Williams]], about the situation in Russia.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=148}} She stayed in Washington long enough to participate in a [[National Woman's Party]] suffrage rally, during which she was arrested, [[arraigned]], and sentenced to five days in jail.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=120–23}} The specific charges against her and others, who had burned President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in [[effigy]] on the [[White House]] lawn, were "building fires on government property, standing on the coping around the White House, or attempting to make disorderly speeches."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Five Days in Jail for 25 Militants|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 11, 1919|page=5|via=TimesMachine|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/02/11/97072350.html|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among a group of women who refused [[bail]], she spent at least three days in jail, during which she took part in a [[hunger strike]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=120–23}} Upon her release, she insisted on testifying as an unfriendly witness before the [[Overman Committee]], which had been set up to investigate Bolshevik activity in the United States. Deflecting questions about her religious beliefs, marriages, and other personal matters during her two days of testimony, she tried to convince the subcommittee, led by Senator [[Lee Slater Overman|Lee S. Overman]], that Russia had a right to self-determination.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=123–26}} Soon thereafter, she began a cross-country speaking tour, "The Truth About Russia", arranged by [[Anna Louise Strong]], during which she addressed large audiences in Detroit, Chicago, Spokane, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and other American cities.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=153–63}} According to Gardner, Bryant was the first woman to defend Lenin and Trotsky at political gatherings across the United States. Gardner writes, "Her message was simple, 'Hands off Russia!' 'Bring the boys home!'"{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=163}}

After Bryant returned from her lecture tour in May, she and Reed spent the next few months mainly in Croton-on-Hudson writing, gardening, and in Reed's case, recuperating from [[influenza]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=136–38}} In late August, Reed, who had joined the [[Socialist Party of America]], was chosen by one of its factions, the [[Communist Labor Party of America]] (CLP), to visit Moscow to seek recognition for the CLP as the sole representative of the [[Comintern|Communist International]] (Comintern) in the United States.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=139–40}} Unlike Reed, Bryant avoided party membership.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=182}} The U.S. government quickly outlawed the CLP and its competitor, the [[American Communist Party]], headed by [[Louis Fraina]].{{sfn|Gelb|1973|p=243}} In danger of being arrested and unable to get a passport to go to Russia, Reed, disguised as a [[Fireman (steam engine)|stoker]], left the United States in late September 1919 on a Scandinavian ship headed for Europe.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=174}} During the [[Palmer Raids]] and [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]] days beginning in November 1919, he was charged with conspiring to overthrow the government by force.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=179–80}} In March 1920, after visiting Moscow, he was arrested and incarcerated in Finland on his way home.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=183–89}} Three months later, he was returned to Moscow in a prisoner exchange between the White (anti-Bolshevik) Finns of the [[Finnish Civil War]] and the Bolsheviks.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=183–89}} From [[Tallinn|Reval]] (Tallinn), Estonia, he cabled Bryant, "Passport home refused. Temporarily returning headquarters. Come if possible."{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=188}} Traveling without passport, Bryant, disguised as the wife of a Swedish businessman,{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=193}} arrived in Petrograd in late August 1920.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=200}}

==Reed's death==
When Bryant reached Petrograd, Reed was in [[Baku]], attending the "first congress of peoples of the east" (Oriental Congress) with the Comintern executive committee.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=200–02, 341}} He had left a letter for her with several possibilities for lodging, one of which was a room he had arranged for her at the Dielovoy Hotel in Moscow. This is where, on September 15, they finally reconnected, spending the next few days together and visiting Lenin, Trotsky, Hungarian revolutionary [[Béla Kun]], and [[Enver Pasha]], a former minister of war in the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=202–05}} Bryant began filing Moscow news stories with the [[International News Service]], which had hired her before she left New York.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=205}}

A week after Reed's return from Baku, he began to experience dizziness and headaches, thought at first to be symptoms of influenza. Five days later, when he became delirious, doctors diagnosed [[typhus]] and sent him to the hospital. There, with Bryant by his side, he died on October 17, 1920, a few days shy of his 33rd birthday. On the day of Reed's funeral, in keeping with Russian custom, Bryant walked alone behind the hearse, at the head of the funeral procession. Fainting during the burial, she awoke in her hotel room. Among those at her bedside were Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, who had been arrested in the United States and deported to Russia in late 1919.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=200–08}}

==Further reporting==
After Reed's death, Bryant obtained Lenin's approval for a trip to the southern Russian border and neighboring countries.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=211}} She went by train over the [[Kazakh Steppe]], through areas hard hit by famine, to [[Tashkent]] and [[Bukhara]] and to the borders of [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]], interviewing and taking notes.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=213–17}}

A well-dressed woman is on the steps behind him, while a third person, a man, approaches the steps.|[[William Christian Bullitt, Jr.|William C.

She returned to the U.S. in mid-summer 1921, and stayed for about a year,{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=175–76}} during which she first met [[William Christian Bullitt, Jr.]], then managing editor of film stories at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], to try to persuade him to make ''Ten Days That Shook the World'' into a film.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=201}} Bullitt, a [[Yale University]] graduate from a [[Philadelphia]] family of great wealth, had worked as a journalist specializing in foreign affairs, then as a diplomat in the [[United States Department of State]] before retiring temporarily from politics and taking the Paramount job.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=191–201}} He later returned to politics and became the first U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Bullitt ambassador"/&gt; Bryant and Bullet had in common their interests in Russia, journalism, and Jack Reed, whom Bullitt greatly admired. Although Paramount did not pursue the ''Ten Days'' project, Bullitt was charmed by Bryant and began the amorous pursuit of her that two years later ended in marriage.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=201}}  In August, the ''New York American'', a [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]] newspaper, began publishing a series of 16 of Bryant's articles describing famine in Russia, Lenin's [[New Economic Policy]], the end of the [[Russian Civil War]], and related topics.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=220–21}} In general, the tone of these articles was "sober and at times unsparing, in contrast to her often rapturous reporting in her 1918 stories."{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=222}}

In October, she was the main speaker at a memorial for Reed in New York City, and she spent some of her time collecting Reed's papers for possible publication.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=178}} She also arranged with [[King Features Syndicate]], another Hearst agency, to return to Russia to write portraits of Russians. The first of these appeared in print in June 1922 and led to her second book, ''Mirrors of Moscow'', in 1923.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=181–83}} Bryant's travels in Europe this time included Moscow, Berlin, London, Paris, and other cities. By late October, she was in Rome, accompanied by Bullitt.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=184–87}} Here in late 1922, she wrote about [[Benito Mussolini]], the Fascist leader who had just come to power and with whom she had obtained an interview. Gathering material from a variety of sources, including Madame [[Rachele Mussolini]], Bryant wrote a feature article, "Mussolini Relies Upon Efficiency to Restore Italy", published in the ''New York American'' in early 1923. She described the future dictator this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I will always think of Mussolini as one of the oddest characters in history, and I will remember him as I last saw him in the great white and gold foyer of the Grand Hotel, under a huge crystal candelabra slouching wearily into a graceful Louis XV ivory and enameled chair.

His pale, heavy-boned face showed signs of sleeplessness. His strong body was bulging over the sides of the seat; his legs were spread wide over the pale, rose-colored velvet carpet. There was a little cup of black coffee, absurdly delicate, beside his gnarled work-warped hand.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=211|ps=. As quoted from the ''New York American'', January 28, 1923, section 52, p. 1.}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Leaving Rome to cover the [[Turkish War of Independence]] for the International News Service, Bryant lived with Bullitt in a villa in [[Constantinople]] in early 1923.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=236–37}} While Bullitt worked on a novel, ''It's Not Done'', published in 1926 and dedicated to Bryant, she covered events related to the rise of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], the first president of the [[Republic of Turkey]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=217–19}} From her base in Turkey, she ventured to [[Palermo]] to interview the deposed king of Greece, [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]], and to Athens to interview his son, [[George II of Greece|George II]].{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=220}} Shortly thereafter, Bryant suspended her journalistic career to focus on family matters.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=220}}

==Paris==
Later in 1923, Bryant and Bullitt moved to Paris, where they married in December. Two months later,{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=216–24}} Bryant gave birth to her only child, [[Anne Moen Bullitt]] (1924–2007).&lt;ref name="Oregon Encyclopedia"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Bryant sometimes spelled her father's last name, Mohan, as Moen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Munk|first=Michael|title=Oregon Voices: The Romance of John Reed and Louise Bryant: New Documents Clarify How They Met|publisher=Oregon Historical Society|volume=109|number=3|date=Fall 2008|p=177|jstor=20615880|via=[[JSTOR]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} In 1925 she and Bullitt added to their family an 8-year-old boy, Refik Ismaili Bey, whom they had met in Turkey.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=225}} As the wife of a rich man, Bryant had duties related to the running of an upper-class household: "...the management of servants, the ordering of food and planning of menus, house decoration, flower arrangement, keeping a social calendar."{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=227}} She told one visitor to her home that she considered her new life "useless", and the Bryant–Bullitt marriage began to unravel.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=227–30}} In "Louise Bryant Grows Old", historian [[Christine Stansell]] examines the great changes in Bryant's life after her marriage to Bullitt:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The entrance of William Bullitt into Louise Bryant's life confounds the intertwined stories of the grief-stricken war widow, the radical heroine, and the champion of the oppressed. The marriage is a puzzle, both biographically and historically. Biographically, it proved to be a disaster, in contrast to Bryant's earlier romantic choices, which had been smart and fulfilling.&lt;ref name="Stansell"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stansell|first=Christine|title=Louise Bryant Grows Old|journal=History Workshop Journal|jstor=4289696|subscription=yes|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=50|date=Autumn 2000|page=166|via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Bryant continued to write, little of her work toward the end of her life was published.&lt;ref name="Yale papers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to the Louise Bryant Papers MS 1840|url=http://drs.library.yale.edu:8083/saxon/SaxonServlet?style=http://drs.library.yale.edu:8083/saxon/EAD/yul.ead2002.xhtml.xsl&amp;source=http://drs.library.yale.edu:8083/fedora/get/mssa:ms.1840/EAD|publisher=Yale University Library|access-date=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her last piece of journalism, "A Turkish Divorce", about Atatürk's treatment of women, appeared in ''The Nation'' in August 1925.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=231}}

By 1926, Bryant, who had generally abstained from alcohol earlier in life, was suffering from painful and incurable [[adiposis dolorosa]] (Dercum's disease) and was drinking heavily.{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=244–47}} Bullitt, citing his wife's drinking and alleging that she was involved in a lesbian relationship with Gwen Le Gallienne, a stepdaughter of writer [[Richard Le Gallienne]],{{#tag:ref|Gardner says "daughter", but other sources explain that Gwen was Le Gallienne's [[stepdaughter]] via his marriage to Irma Hinton Perry, Gwen's mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Poet Has Family of Young Artists|newspaper=The Greenwood Commonwealth|agency=Associated Press|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12905283/the_greenwood_commonwealth/|via=Newspapers.com|date=August 29, 1927|page=2|access-date=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} divorced Bryant in 1930 and won sole custody of Anne.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=270–74}} Bryant remained in Paris, occasionally advising writer [[Claude McKay]],{{sfn|Gardner|1982|pp=253–64}} and briefly assisting researchers from Harvard University in preserving Reed's papers.&lt;ref name="Yale papers"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Bryant died on January 6, 1936, of a [[brain hemorrhage]] in [[Sèvres]], in the suburbs of Paris,{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=294}} and is buried in [[Cimetière des Gonards]] in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]].&lt;ref name="Penny Allen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Allen|first=Penny|title=Rehabilitating a Memory From a Forgotten Grave | newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 15, 1999|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/15/opinion/15iht-edallen.2.t.html|access-date=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, three volunteers from the [[Oregon Cultural Heritage Commission]] went to Paris to find the grave, which they discovered was crumbling, undated, and scheduled for removal. Through the commission's efforts as well as donations, including some from relatives of Bryant and Bullitt, the grave was restored.&lt;ref name="Penny Allen"/&gt;

The Bryant–Reed story is told in the 1981 film ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'', starring [[Diane Keaton]] as Bryant and [[Warren Beatty]] as Reed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Myers|first=Marc|title=The Story of 'Reds' and the Reed House|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/03/nyregion/the-story-of-reds-and-the-reed-house.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 3, 1982 |access-date=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting actors include [[Jack Nicholson]] as Eugene O'Neill, [[Maureen Stapleton]] as [[Emma Goldman]], [[Jerzy Kosiński]] as [[Grigory Zinoviev]] (one of the Bolshevik leaders), and [[Edward Herrmann]] as Max Eastman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Canby|first=Vincent|title=''Reds'' (1981): Beatty's 'Reds,' with Diane Keaton|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9406E4DC103BF937A35751C1A967948260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 4, 1981|access-date=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryant's personal papers were transferred to Bullitt, with whom they remained until their daughter, Anne, donated the collection to Yale University in 2004. They exist as separate collections, the Louise Bryant Papers (MS 1840) and the William C. Bullitt Papers (MS 112) in the [[Sterling Memorial Library]] at Yale. The Louise Bryant Papers consists of about 19 linear feet (5.8 m) of letters, texts, photographs, art, and other materials that she created or collected between 1916 and 1936.&lt;ref name="Yale papers"/&gt;

Bryant's early journalistic work appeared in college publications and in newspapers—''The Spectator'', where Bryant was society editor,{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|pp=22–27}} and ''The Oregonian'', for whom she freelanced—in Portland.&lt;ref name="Oregonian freelance"/&gt; Later work appeared in independent magazines, including ''The Masses'',&lt;ref name="Two Judges"/&gt;  and ''The Liberator'',{{sfn|Dearborn|1996|p=138}} Some, written for the ''[[New York Journal-American|New York American]]'' and other [[William Randolph Hearst|Hearst]] publications, were [[Print syndication|syndicated]] to newspapers across North America.{{sfn|Gardner|1982|p=134}} Collections of her articles appeared in book form in 1918 and 1923. Below is a partial list of her published work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="818">In [[USDA|United States agricultural]] policy, a '''nondegradation standard''' is defined in the [[2002 Farm Bill]] provisions establishing the [[Conservation Security Program]] (CSP; P.L. 107-171, Sec. 2001) to mean the level of measures required to protect and prevent degradation of 1 or more natural resources, as determined by the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]]. Participating farmers’ conservation security plans must address resources of concern and meet the appropriate nondegradation standard.

In [[philosophy]], '''potentiality and actuality'''&lt;ref&gt;''dynamis&amp;ndash;energeia'', translated into Latin as ''potentia&amp;ndash;actualitas'' (earlier also ''possibilitas&amp;ndash;efficacia''). Giorgio Agamben, ''Opus Dei: An Archaeology of Duty'' (2013), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=yVYTAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46  p. 46].&lt;/ref&gt; are a pair of closely connected principles which [[Aristotle]] used to analyze [[Motion (physics)|motion]], [[Four causes|causality]], [[Aristotelian ethics|ethics]], and [[physiology]] in his ''[[Aristotelian physics|Physics]]'', ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and ''[[De Anima]]'', which is about the human [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]].&lt;ref name="Sachs2005"/&gt;

The concept of potentiality, in this context, generally refers to any "possibility" that a thing can be said to have. Aristotle did not consider all possibilities the same, and emphasized the importance of those that become real of their own accord when conditions are right and nothing stops them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Sachs|1999|p=lvii}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Actuality, in contrast to potentiality, is the motion, change or activity that represents an exercise or fulfillment of a possibility, when a possibility becomes real in the fullest sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Durrant|1993|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These concepts, in modified forms, remained very important into the [[middle ages]], influencing the development of [[medieval theology]] in several ways. Going further into modern times, while the understanding of [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]], and according to some interpretations [[deity]], implied by the dichotomy lost importance, the terminology has found new uses, developing indirectly from the old. This is most obvious in words like "energy" and "dynamic"--words first used in modern physics by the German scientist and philosopher, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].   Another example is the highly controversial biological concept of an "[[Potentiality and actuality#Entelecheia in modern philosophy and biology|entelechy]]".

==Potentiality==
'''Potentiality''' and '''potency''' are translations of the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''dunamis'' ([[wikt:δύναμις|δύναμις]]) as it is used by Aristotle as a concept contrasting with actuality. Its [[Latin]] translation is "''[[wikt:potentia|potentia]]''", root of the English word potential, and used by some scholars instead of the Greek or English variants.

''Dunamis'' is an ordinary Greek word for possibility or capability. Depending on context, it could be translated "potency", "potential", "capacity", "ability", "power", "capability", "strength", "possibility", "force" and is the root of modern [[English language|English]] words "dynamic", "dynamite", and "dynamo".&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=dunamis&amp;la=greek&amp;prior= Perseus dictionary references] for ''dunamis''.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[early modern]] philosophy, English authors like [[Hobbes]] and [[John Locke|Locke]] used the English word "power" as their translation of Latin ''potentia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Locke|1689|loc=chpt. XXI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his philosophy, Aristotle distinguished two meanings of the word ''dunamis''. According to his understanding of [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] there was both a weak sense of potential, meaning simply that something "might chance to happen or not to happen", and a stronger sense, to indicate how something could be done ''well''. For example, "sometimes we say that those who can merely take a walk, or speak, without doing it as well as they intended, cannot speak or walk". This stronger sense is mainly said of the potentials of living things, although it is also sometimes used for things like musical instruments.&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D5%3Asection%3D1019a 1019a] - [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D5%3Asection%3D1019b 1019b]. The translations used are those of Tredennick on the [[Perseus project]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his works, Aristotle clearly distinguishes things that are stable or persistent, with their own strong natural tendency to a specific type of change, from things that appear to occur by chance. He treats these as having a different and more real existence. "[[Nature (philosophy)|Natures]] which persist" are said by him to be one of the causes of all things, while natures that do not persist, "might often be slandered as not being at all by one who fixes his thinking sternly upon it as upon a criminal". The potencies which persist in a particular material are one way of describing "the nature itself" of that material, an innate source of motion and rest within that material. In terms of Aristotle's theory of [[four causes]], a material's non-accidental potential, is the material cause of the things that can come to be from that material, and one part of how we can understand the [[substance theory|substance]] (''[[ousia]]'', sometimes translated as "thinghood") of any separate thing. (As emphasized by Aristotle, this requires his distinction between [[Accident (philosophy)|accidental]] causes and natural causes.)&lt;ref&gt;From ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' 192a18. Translation from {{Harvtxt|Sachs|1995|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle, when we refer to the nature of a thing, we are referring to the form, shape or look of a thing, which was already present as a potential, an innate tendency to change, in that material before it achieved that form, but things show what they are more fully, as a real thing, when they are "fully at work".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' 193b. ({{Harvtxt|Sachs|1995|p=51}}.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actuality==
'''Actuality''' is often used to translate both ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=e%29nerge%2Fw&amp;la=greek&amp;prior=e%29nerga/zomai energeia]'' ([[wikt:ενέργεια|ενέργεια]]) and ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=e%29ntele%2Fxeia&amp;la=greek&amp;prior=e%29ntele/w#lexicon entelecheia]'' ([[wikt:ἐντελέχεια|ἐντελέχεια]]) (sometimes rendered in English as ''"[[wikt:entelechy|entelechy]]"''). "Actuality" comes from Latin ''{{linktext|actualitas}}'' and is a traditional translation, but its normal meaning in Latin is "anything which is currently happening".

The two words ''energeia'' and ''entelecheia'' were coined by Aristotle, and he stated that their meanings were intended to converge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1047a Metaphysics 1047a30], in the {{Harvtxt|Sachs|1999}} translation: "the phrase being-at-work, which is designed to converge in meaning with being-at-work-staying-complete". [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.+Met.+9.1047a&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051 Greek is]: ἐλήλυθε δ᾽ ἡ '''ἐνέργεια''' τοὔνομα, ἡ πρὸς τὴν '''ἐντελέχειαν''' συντιθεμένη&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, most commentators and translators consider the two words to be interchangeable.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw 2004"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bradshaw|2004}} page 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Durrant|1993|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; They both refer to something being in its own type of action or at work, as all things are when they are real in the fullest sense, and not just potentially real. For example, "to be a rock is to strain to be at the center of the universe, and thus to be in motion unless constrained otherwise".&lt;ref name=Sachs2005/&gt;

===Energeia===
''Energeia'' is a word based upon ἔργον (''ergon''), meaning "work".&lt;ref name="Bradshaw 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.+Met.+9.1050a&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052 Metaphysics 1050a21-23]. In Tredinnick's translation: "For the activity is the end, and the actuality (''energeia'') is the activity (''ergon''); hence the term "actuality" is derived from "activity," and tends to have the meaning of "complete reality (''entelecheia'')." [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1050a Greek:] τὸ γὰρ ἔργον τέλος, ἡ δὲ ἐνέργεια τὸ ἔργον, διὸ καὶ τοὔνομα ἐνέργεια λέγεται κατὰ τὸ ἔργον καὶ συντείνει πρὸς τὴν ἐντελέχειαν.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the source of the modern word "[[energy]]" but the term has evolved so much over the course of the [[history of science]] that  reference to the modern term is not very helpful in understanding the original as used by Aristotle. It is difficult to translate his use of ''energeia'' into English with consistency. Joe Sachs renders it with the phrase "being–at–work" and says that "we might construct the word is-at-work-ness from Anglo-Saxon roots to translate ''energeia'' into English".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Sachs|1995}}, {{Harvtxt|Sachs|1999}}, {{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle says the word can be made clear by looking at examples rather than trying to find a definition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1048a Metaphysics 1048a30ff].&lt;/ref&gt;

Two examples of ''energeiai'' in Aristotle's works are [[pleasure]] and [[happiness]] ([[eudaimonia]]). Pleasure is an ''energeia'' of the human body and mind whereas happiness is more simply the ''energeia'' of a human being a human.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', [[Nicomachean Ethics#Book X. Chapters 1–5: The theory of Pleasure|Book X. Chapters 1–5]].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kinesis'', translated as [[Motion (physics)|movement]], [[motion (physics)|motion]], or in some contexts change, is also explained by Aristotle as a particular type of ''energeia''. See below.

===Entelechy or entelechia===
Entelechy, in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''entelécheia'', was coined by Aristotle and transliterated in [[Latin]] as ''{{linktext|entelechia}}''. According to {{Harvtxt|Sachs|1995|p=245}}:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aristotle invents the word by combining ''entelēs'' (ἐντελής, "complete, full-grown") with ''echein'' (&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''[[hexis]]'', to be a certain way by the continuing effort of holding on in that condition), while at the same time punning on ''endelecheia'' (ἐνδελέχεια, "persistence") by inserting "[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]" (τέλος, "completion"). This is a three-ring circus of a word, at the heart of everything in Aristotle's thinking, including the definition of motion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sachs therefore proposed a complex neologism of his own, "being-at-work-staying-the-same".&lt;ref name=Sachs1995/&gt; Another translation in recent years is "being-at-an-end" (which Sachs has also used).&lt;ref name=Sachs2005&gt;{{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Entelecheia'', as can be seen by its derivation, is a kind of completeness, whereas "the end and completion of any genuine being is its being-at-work" (''energeia''). The ''entelecheia'' is a continuous being-at-work (''energeia'') when something is doing its complete "work". For this reason, the meanings of the two words converge, and they both depend upon the idea that every thing's "thinghood" is a kind of work, or in other words a specific way of being in motion. All things that exist now, and not just potentially, are beings-at-work, and all of them have a tendency towards being-at-work in a particular way that would be their proper and "complete" way.&lt;ref name=Sachs1995&gt;{{Harvtxt|Sachs|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sachs explains the convergence of ''energeia'' and ''entelecheia'' as follows, and uses the word actuality to describe the overlap between them:&lt;ref name=Sachs2005/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Just as ''energeia'' extends to ''entelecheia'' because it is the activity which makes a thing what it is, ''entelecheia'' extends to ''energeia'' because it is the end or perfection which has being only in, through, and during activity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Motion==

Aristotle discusses motion (''kinēsis'') in his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' quite differently from [[modern science]]. Aristotle's definition of motion is closely connected to his actuality-potentiality distinction. Taken literally, Aristotle defines motion as the actuality (''entelecheia'') of a "potentiality as such".&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' 201a10-11, 201a27-29, 201b4-5. ''Metaphysics'' Book VII.&lt;/ref&gt; What Aristotle meant however is the subject of several different interpretations. A major difficulty comes from the fact that the terms actuality and potentiality, linked in this definition, are normally understood within Aristotle as opposed to each other. On the other hand, the "as such" is important and is explained at length by Aristotle, giving examples of "potentiality as such". For example, the motion of building is the ''energeia'' of the ''dunamis'' of the building materials ''as building materials'' as opposed to anything else they might become, and this potential in the unbuilt materials is referred to by Aristotle as "the buildable". So the motion of building is the actualization of "the buildable" and not the actualization of a house as such, nor the actualization of any other possibility which the building materials might have had.&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' Book XI, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D11%3Asection%3D1066a 1066a].&lt;/ref&gt;

In an influential 1969 paper Aryeh Kosman divided up previous attempts to explain Aristotle's definition into two types, criticised them, and then gave his own third interpretation. While this has not become a consensus, it has been described as having become "orthodox".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09tRfDqEo4MC&amp;pg=PA8|title=Oxford Physics in the Thirteenth Century (ca. 1250-1270): Motion, Infinity, Place &amp; Time| first=Cecilia |year=2000|publisher=Brill|last=Trifogli|page=8|isbn=9004116575}}&lt;/ref&gt; This and similar more recent publications are the basis of the following summary.

===1. The "process" interpretation===
{{Harvcoltxt|Kosman|1969}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Coope|2009}} associate this approach with [[W.D. Ross]]. {{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}} points out that it was also the interpretation of [[Averroes]] and [[Maimonides]].

This interpretation is, to use the words of Ross that "it is the passage to actuality that is ''kinesis''” as opposed to any potentiality being an actuality.&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'', text with commentary, London, 1936, p. 359, quoted by {{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument of Ross for this interpretation requires him to assert that Aristotle actually used his own word ''entelecheia'' wrongly, or inconsistently, only within his definition, making it mean "actualization", which is in conflict with Aristotle's normal use of words. According to {{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}} this explanation also can not account for the "as such" in Aristotle's definition.

===2. The "product" interpretation===
{{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}} associates this interpretation with [[St Thomas of Aquinas]] and explains that by this explanation "the apparent contradiction between potentiality and actuality in Aristotle’s definition of motion" is resolved "by arguing that in every motion actuality and potentiality are mixed or blended". Motion is therefore "the actuality of any potentiality insofar as it is still a potentiality". Or in other words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Thomistic blend of actuality and potentiality has the characteristic that, to the extent that it is actual it is not potential and to the extent that it is potential it is not actual; the hotter the water is, the less is it potentially hot, and the cooler it is, the less is it actually, the more potentially, hot.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As with the first interpretation however, {{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}} objects that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One implication of this interpretation is that whatever happens to be the case right now is an ''entelechia'', as though something that is intrinsically unstable as the instantaneous position of an arrow in flight deserved to be described by the word that everywhere else Aristotle reserves for complex organized states that persist, that hold out against internal and external causes that try to destroy them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a more recent paper on this subject, Kosman associates the view of Aquinas with those of his own critics, David Charles, Jonathan Beere, and Robert Heineman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kosman|2013}}, chapter 2, footnote 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===3. The interpretation of Kosman, Coope, Sachs and others===

{{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}}, amongst other authors (such as Aryeh Kosman and Ursula Coope), proposes that the solution to problems interpreting Aristotle's definition must be found in the distinction Aristotle makes between two different types of potentiality, with only one of those corresponding to the "potentiality as such" appearing in the definition of motion. He writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The man with sight, but with his eyes closed, differs from the blind man, although neither is seeing. The first man has the capacity to see, which the second man lacks. There are then potentialities as well as actualities in the world. But when the first man opens his eyes, has he lost the capacity to see? Obviously not; while he is seeing, his capacity to see is no longer merely a potentiality, but is a potentiality which has been put to work. The potentiality to see exists sometimes as active or at-work, and sometimes as inactive or latent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coming to motion, Sachs gives the example of a man walking across the room and says that...
*"Once he has reached the other side of the room, his potentiality to be there has been actualized in Ross’ sense of the term". This is a type of ''energeia''. However it is not a motion, and not relevant to the definition of motion.
*''While'' a man is walking his potentiality to be on the other side of the room is actual ''just as a potentiality'', or in other words the potential ''as such'' is an actuality. "The actuality of the potentiality to be on the other side of the room, as just that potentiality, is neither more nor less than the walking across the room."

{{Harvtxt|Sachs|1995|pp=78–79}}, in his commentary of Aristotle's ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' book III gives the following results from his understanding of Aristotle's definition of motion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The genus of which motion is a species is being-at-work-staying-itself (''entelecheia''), of which the only other species is thinghood. The being-at-work-staying-itself of a potency (''dunamis''), as material, is thinghood. The being-at-work-staying-the-same of a potency as a potency is motion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The importance of actuality in Aristotle's philosophy==
The actuality-potentiality distinction in Aristotle is a key element linked to everything in his physics and metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sachs|1995|p=245}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Carrara 7.JPG|250px|right|thumb|A [[marble]] block in [[Carrara]]. Could there be a particular sculpture already existing in it as a potentiality? Aristotle wrote approvingly of such ways of talking, and felt it reflected a type of causation in nature which is often ignored in scientific discussion.]]
Aristotle describes potentiality and actuality, or potency and action, as one of several distinctions between things that exist or do not exist. In a sense, a thing that exists potentially does not exist, but the potential does exist. And this type of distinction is expressed for several different types of being within Aristotle's categories of being. For example, from Aristotle's ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D5%3Asection%3D1017a 1017a]:&lt;ref&gt;Tredennick's translation, with links to his footnote cross references, using the [[Perseus project|Perseus]] online resources: "For we say that both that which sees potentially and that which sees actually is "a seeing thing." And in the same way we call "understanding" both that which can use the understanding, and that which does ; and we call "tranquil" both that in which tranquillity is already present, and that which is potentially tranquil. Similarly too in the case of substances. For we say that Hermes is in the stone, (Cf. Aristotle ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.%20Met.%203.1002a&amp;lang=original Met. 3.5.6.]'') and the half of the line in the whole; and we call "corn" what is not yet ripe. But when a thing is potentially existent and when not, must be defined elsewhere." Aristotle ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.%20Met.%209.1051a&amp;lang=original Metaphysics 9.9.]''&lt;/ref&gt;
*We speak of an entity being a "seeing" thing whether it is currently seeing or just able to see.
*We speak of someone having understanding, whether they are using that understanding or not.
*We speak of corn existing in a field even when it is not yet ripe.
*People sometimes speak of a figure being already present in a rock which could be sculpted to represent that figure.

Within the works of Aristotle the terms ''energeia'' and ''entelecheia'', often translated as actuality, differ from what is merely actual because they specifically presuppose that all things have a proper kind of activity or work which, if achieved, would be their proper end. Greek for end in this sense is [[telos (philosophy)|telos]], a component word in ''entelecheia'' (a work that is the proper end of a thing) and also [[teleology]]. This is an aspect of Aristotle's [[Four causes|theory of four causes]] and specifically of formal cause (''eidos'', which Aristotle says is ''energeia''&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1050b 1050b]. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1050b Greek:] ὥστε φανερὸν ὅτι ἡ οὐσία καὶ τὸ εἶδος ἐνέργειά ἐστιν.&lt;/ref&gt;) and final cause (''telos'').

In essence this means that Aristotle did not see things as matter in motion only, but also proposed that all things have their own aims or ends. In other words, for Aristotle (unlike modern science) there is a distinction between things with a natural cause in the strongest sense, and things that truly happen by accident. He also distinguishes non-rational from rational potentialities (e.g. the capacity to heat and the capacity to play the flute, respectively), pointing out that the latter require desire or deliberate choice for their actualization.&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1048a 1048a]. The Greek words are ''orexis'' for desire and ''proairesis'' for deliberate choice.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this style of reasoning, Aristotle is often referred to as having a [[teleology]], and sometimes as having a [[theory of forms]].

While actuality is linked by Aristotle to his concept of a [[formal cause]], potentiality (or potency) on the other hand, is linked by Aristotle to his concepts of [[Hylomorphism|hylomorphic matter]] and [[material cause]]. Aristotle wrote for example that "matter exists potentially, because it may attain to the form; but when it exists actually, it is then in the form".&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1050a 1050a15]. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0051%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D1050a Greek:] ἔτι ἡ ὕλη ἔστι δυνάμει ὅτι ἔλθοι ἂν εἰς τὸ εἶδος: ὅταν δέ γε ἐνεργείᾳ ᾖ, τότε ἐν τῷ εἴδει ἐστίν&lt;/ref&gt;

==The active intellect==
{{Main article|Active Intellect}}
The active intellect was a concept Aristotle described that requires an understanding of the actuality-potentiality dichotomy. Aristotle described this in his ''[[On the Soul|De Anima]]'' (book 3, ch. 5, 430a10-25) and covered similar ground in his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' (book 12, ch.7-10). The following is from the ''De Anima'', translated by Joe Sachs,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sachs|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some parenthetic notes about the Greek. The passage tries to explain "how the human intellect passes from its original state, in which it does not think, to a subsequent state, in which it does." He inferred that the energeia/dunamis distinction must also exist in the soul itself:&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt;-
&lt;blockquote&gt;...since in [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] one thing is the material [''[[matter|hulē]]''] for each kind [''[[genos]]''] (this is what is in '''potency''' all the particular things of that kind) but it is something else that is the causal and productive thing by which all of them are formed, as is the case with an art in relation to its material, it is necessary in the soul [''[[psyche (psychology)|psuchē]]''] too that these distinct aspects be present;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;the one sort is intellect [''[[nous]]''] by becoming all things, the other sort by forming all things, in the way an active condition [''[[hexis]]''] like [[light]] too makes the colors '''that are in potency be at work as''' colors [''to phōs poiei ta '''dunamei''' onta chrōmata '''energeiai''' chrōmata''].&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This sort of intellect is separate, as well as being without attributes and unmixed, since it is by its thinghood a '''[[being-at-work]]''', for what acts is always distinguished in stature above what is acted upon, as a governing source is above the material it works on.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Knowledge]] [''epistēmē''], in its '''being-at-work''', is the same as the thing it knows, and while knowledge in '''potency''' comes first in time in any one knower, in the whole of things it does not take precedence even in time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This does not mean that at one time it thinks but at another time it does not think, but when separated it is just exactly what it is, and this alone is deathless and everlasting (though we have no memory, because this sort of intellect is not acted upon, while the sort that is acted upon is destructible), and without this nothing thinks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This has been referred to as one of "the most intensely studied sentences in the history of philosophy".&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{harvtxt|Davidson|1992|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Metaphysics'', Aristotle wrote at more length on a similar subject and is often understood to have equated the active intellect with being the "[[unmoved mover]]" and [[God]]. Nevertheless, as Davidson remarks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Just what Aristotle meant by potential intellect and active intellect - terms not even explicit in the ''De anima'' and at best implied - and just how he understood the interaction between them remains [[wikt:moot|moot]] to this day. Students of the history of philosophy continue to debate Aristotle's intent, particularly the question whether he considered the active intellect to be an aspect of the human soul or an entity existing independently of man.&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Post-Aristotelian usage==

===New meanings of ''energeia'' or energy===

Already in Aristotle's own works, the concept of a distinction between ''energeia'' and ''dunamis'' was used in many ways, for example to describe the way striking metaphors work,&lt;ref&gt;[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.+Rh.+1411b&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0060 1411b]&lt;/ref&gt; or human happiness. [[Polybius]] about 150 BC, in his work the ''Histories'' uses Aristotle's word ''energeia'' in both an Aristotelian way and also to describe the "clarity and vividness" of things.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bradshaw|2004|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus Siculus]] in 60-30 BC used the term in a very similar way to Polybius. However Diodorus uses the term to denote qualities unique to individuals.

===Neoplatonism===
[[Plotinus]] was a late classical pagan philosopher and theologian whose [[monotheism|monotheistic]] re-workings of Plato and Aristotle were influential amongst early Christian theologians. In his ''[[Enneads]]'' he sought to reconcile ideas of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]] together with a form of [[monotheism]], that used three fundamental metaphysical principles, which were conceived of in terms consistent with Aristotle's energeia/dunamis dichotomy, and one interpretation of his concept of the Active Intellect (discussed above):-
*The [[Monism|Monad]] or "the One" sometimes also described as "[[the Good]]". This is the ''dunamis'' or possibility of existence.
*The Intellect, or Intelligence, or, to use the Greek term, ''[[Nous]]'', which is described as God, or a ''[[Demiurge]]''. It thinks its own contents, which are thoughts, equated to the Platonic ideas or [[Theory of Forms|forms]] (''eide''). The thinking of this Intellect is the highest ''activity'' of life. The ''actualization'' of this thinking is the being of the forms. This Intellect is the first principle or foundation of existence. The One is prior to it, but not in the sense that a normal cause is prior to an effect, but instead Intellect is called an [[emanation]] of the One. The One is the possibility of this foundation of existence.
*[[Soul]] or, to use the Greek term, ''[[psyche (psychology)|psyche]]''. The soul is also an ''energeia'': it acts upon or ''actualizes'' its own thoughts and creates "a separate, material cosmos that is the living image of the spiritual or noetic [[Cosmos]] contained as a unified thought within the Intelligence".
This was based largely upon Plotinus' reading of Plato, but also incorporated many Aristotelian concepts, including the [[Unmoved Mover]] as ''energeia''.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Citation|chapter=Plotinus|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/plotinus/|last=Moore|first=Edward}} and {{Citation|chapter=Plotinus|title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plotinus/|last=Gerson|first=Lloyd}}. The direct quote above comes from Moore.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Essence-energies debate in medieval Christian theology===
{{details|Essence-Energies distinction}}

In [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christianity, St [[Gregory Palamas]] wrote about the "energies" (actualities; singular ''energeia'' in Greek, or ''actus'' in Latin) of God in contrast to God's "[[essence]]" (''ousia''). These are two distinct types of existence, with God's energy being the type of existence which people can perceive, while the essence of God is outside of normal existence or non-existence or human understanding, in that it is not caused or created by anything else.

Palamas gave this explanation as part of his defense of the Eastern Orthodox [[asceticism|ascetic]] practice of [[hesychasm]]. Palamism became a standard part of Orthodox dogma after 1351.&lt;ref name=HistoricalOverview&gt;{{cite web |title=Gregory Palamas: An Historical Overview |url=http://www.monachos.net/content/patristics/studies-fathers/61-gregory-palamas-an-historical-overview?title=Gregory_Palamas:_An_Historical_Overview |accessdate=2010-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927014640/http://www.monachos.net/content/patristics/studies-fathers/61-gregory-palamas-an-historical-overview?title=Gregory_Palamas%3A_An_Historical_Overview |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the position of Western Medieval (or Catholic) Christianity, can be found for example in the philosophy of [[Thomas Aquinas]], who relied on Aristotle's concept of entelechy, when he defined God as ''actus purus'', [[pure act]], actuality unmixed with potentiality. The existence of a truly distinct essence of God which is not actuality, is not generally accepted in Catholic Theology.

===Influence on modal logic===

The notion of possibility was greatly analyzed by medieval and modern philosophers. Aristotle's logical work in this area is considered by some to be an anticipation of [[Modal logic#Development of modal logic|modal logic]] and its treatment of potentiality and time. Indeed, many philosophical interpretations of possibility are related to a famous passage on Aristotle's ''[[On Interpretation]]'', concerning the truth of the statement: "There will be a sea battle tomorrow".&lt;ref&gt;See [https://archive.org/stream/AristotleOrganon/AristotleOrganoncollectedWorks#page/n57/mode/1up/search/sea-fight copy] of W.D. Ross's translation scanned on Internet Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Contemporary philosophy]] regards possibility, as studied by [[Modal logic#Metaphysical possibility|modal metaphysics]], to be an aspect of [[modal logic]]. Modal logic as a named subject owes much to the writings of the [[Scholastics]], in particular [[William of Ockham]] and [[John Duns Scotus]], who reasoned informally in a modal manner, mainly to analyze statements about [[essence]] and [[accident (philosophy)|accident]].

===Influence on modern physics===

Aristotle's metaphysics, his account of nature and causality, was for the most part rejected by the [[early modern]] philosophers. [[Francis Bacon]] in his ''[[Novum Organon]]'' in one explanation of the case for rejecting the concept of a formal cause or "nature" for each type of thing, argued for example that philosophers must still look for formal causes but only in the sense of "simple natures" such as [[colour]], and [[weight]], which exist in many gradations and modes in very different types of individual bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Book II, aphorism V&lt;/ref&gt; In the works of [[Thomas Hobbes]] then, the traditional Aristotelian terms, "''potentia et actus''", are discussed, but he equates them simply to "cause and effect".&lt;ref&gt;''[[De Corpore]]'' chapter X (in [https://archive.org/stream/thomhobbesmalme03molegoog#page/n261/mode/1up Latin]; in [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gr8LAAAAIAAJ&amp;vq=power&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q=chapter%20X&amp;f=false English]).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz]], the source of the modern adaptations of Aristotle's concepts of potentiality and actuality.]]

There was an adaptation of at least one aspect of Aristotle's potentiality and actuality distinction, which has become part of modern physics, although as per Bacon's approach it is a generalized form of energy, not one connected to specific forms for specific things. The definition of [[energy]] in modern [[physics]] as the [[Product (mathematics)|product]] of [[mass]] and the [[Square (algebra)|square]] of [[velocity]], was derived by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], as a correction of [[Descartes]], based upon [[Galileo]]'s investigation of falling bodies. He preferred to refer to it as an ''entelecheia'' or "living force" (Latin ''vis viva''), but what he defined is today called "kinetic energy", and was seen by Leibniz as a modification of Aristotle's ''energeia'', and his concept of the potential for movement which is in things. Instead of each type of physical thing having its own specific tendency to a way of moving or changing, as in Aristotle, Leibniz said that instead, force, power, or motion itself could be transferred between things of different types, in such a way that there is a general [[Conservation of energy|conservation of this energy]]. In other words, Leibniz's modern version of entelechy or energy obeys its own laws of nature, whereas different types of things do not have their own separate laws of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Klein|1985}}, and {{Harvtxt|Sachs|2005}}: "[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], who criticized [[Descartes]]’ physics and invented a science of dynamics, explicitly acknowledged his debt to Aristotle (see, e.g., ''Specimen Dynamicum''), whose doctrine of ''entelecheia'' he regarded himself as restoring in a modified form. From Leibniz we derive our current notions of [[potential]] and [[kinetic energy]], whose very names, pointing to the actuality which is potential and the actuality which is motion, preserve the [[Thomism|Thomistic]] resolutions of the two paradoxes in Aristotle’s definition of motion."&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Leibniz|1890|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;...the entelechy of Aristotle, which has made so much noise, is nothing else but force or activity ; that is, a state from which action naturally flows if nothing hinders it. But matter, primary and pure, taken without the souls or lives which are united to it, is purely passive ; properly speaking also it is not a substance, but something incomplete.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Leibniz's study of the "entelechy" now known as energy was a part of what he called his new science of "dynamics", based on the Greek word ''dunamis'' and his understanding that he was making a modern version of Aristotle's old dichotomy. He also referred to it as the "new science of power and action", (Latin "''potentia et effectu''" and "''potentia et actione''"). And it is from him that the modern distinction between [[statics]] and dynamics in physics stems. The emphasis on ''dunamis'' in the name of this new science comes from the importance of his discovery of [[potential energy]] which is not active, but which conserves energy nevertheless. "As 'a science of power and action', dynamics arises when Leibniz proposes an adequate architectonic of laws for constrained, as well as unconstrained, motions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Duchesneau|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Leibniz, like Aristotle, this law of nature concerning entelechies was also understood as a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical law]], important not only for [[physics]], but also for understanding [[life]] and the [[soul]]. A soul, or spirit, according to Leibniz, can be understood as a type of entelechy (or living [[Monadology|monad]]) which has distinct [[perception]]s and memory.

===Entelecheia in modern philosophy and biology===

As discussed above, terms derived from ''dunamis'' and ''energeia'' have become parts of modern scientific vocabulary with a very different meaning from Aristotle's. The original meanings are not used by modern philosophers unless they are commenting on classical or medieval philosophy. In contrast, ''entelecheia'', in the form of "entelechy" is a word used much less in technical senses in recent times.

As mentioned above, the concept had occupied a central position in the metaphysics of Leibniz, and is closely related to his [[Monadology|monad]] in the sense that each sentient entity contains its own entire universe within it. But Leibniz' use of this concept influenced more than just the development of the vocabulary of modern physics. Leibniz was also one of the main inspirations for the important movement in philosophy known as [[German Idealism]], and within this movement and schools influenced by it entelechy may denote a force propelling one to [[self-fulfillment]].

In the biological [[vitalism]] of [[Hans Driesch]], living things develop by ''entelechy'', a common purposive and organising field. Leading vitalists like Driesch argued that many of the basic problems of biology cannot be solved by a philosophy in which the organism is simply considered a machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mayr|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitalism and its concepts like entelechy have since been discarded as without value for scientific practice by the overwhelming majority of professional biologists. 

However, in philosophy aspects and applications of the concept of entelechy have been explored by scientifically interested philosophers and philosophically inclined scientists alike. One example was the American critic and philosopher [[Kenneth Burke]] (1897–1993) whose concept of the "[[terministic screens]]" illustrates his thought on the subject. Most prominent was perhaps the German quantum physicist [[Werner Heisenberg]]. He looked to the notions of potentiality and actuality in order to better understand the relationship of quantum theory to the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/375/2106/20160390?Type=ALERT See Jaeger]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''R v Savage''''' [1992] UKHL 1 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1992/1.html |title=R v Savage [1992&amp;#; UKHL 1 (7 Nov 1991) |publisher=Bailii.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[House of Lords]] case in [[English law]] on establishing [[mens rea]] of [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm|assault]]. 

== Facts == 
The defendant, Susan Savage, threw a beer over another woman, Tracey Beal, who was a former girlfriend of Mrs Savage's husband, in a pub on the evening of 31 March 1989. Mrs Savage had in her hand a full pint of beer before she threw the content over Miss Beal; in doing so the glass slipped from Savage's hand and cut Beal's wrist. The defendant claimed that she had only intended to throw the contents of the beer. It was never her intention or her realization that there was risk of injury in her action. The jury by their verdict concluded that Mrs Savage had deliberately thrown not only the beer but the glass at Miss Beal or while throwing the beer, the glass had slipped off her grip and had struck injured Miss Beal. In any of this instance, the jury concluded there was Mrs Savage had no intention that the glass would injure Miss Beal. Mrs Savage was convicted under s20 of [[Offences against the Person Act 1861|Offences against the Person Act 1861 (OAPA 1861)]] 1861.

== Judgment ==
The [[Court of Appeal]] quashed the conviction of s20 by substituting it with a conviction under s47 OAPA 1861 [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm]]. Mrs Savage appealed this decision to the [[House of Lords]] which dismissed her appeal.

The Morgan is part of the [[RepRap project]] and has an unusual [[SCARA]] arm design.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.htxt.co.za/2015/09/30/morgan-3d-printers-are-a-labour-of-love-inspired-by-the-internet/|title=Morgan 3D Printers are a labour of love inspired by the internet|last=Lotz|first=Brendyn|date=2015-09-30|website=htxt.africa|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Morgan printer was designed by [https://za.linkedin.com/in/quentinharley Quentin Harley], a [[South Africa]]n engineer (working for [[Siemens]] at the time) at the House4Hack Makerspace in [[Centurion, Gauteng|Centurion]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/will-this-100-reprap-be-the-device-that-takes-3d-printing-to-the-masses/|title=Will this $100 RepRap be the device that takes 3D printing to the masses? {{!}} ZDNet|last=Oxford|first=Adam|website=ZDNet|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[SCARA]] arm design was developed due to the lack of access to components of existing 3D printer designs in South Africa and their relatively high cost.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2013 the Morgan won the HumanityPlus Uplift Personal Manufacturing Prize and third place in the Gauteng Accelerator Program.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://humanityplus.org/projects/the-uplift-prize/|title=Humanity+  » The Uplift Prize|website=humanityplus.org|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.htxt.co.za/2013/12/08/reprap-morgan-wins-third-prize-in-gauteng-accelerator-programme-awards/|title=RepRap Morgan wins third prize in Gauteng Accelerator Programme awards|last=adamoxford|date=2013-12-08|website=htxt.africa|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Morgan name comes from the RepRap convention of naming printers after famous deceased biologists.  The Morgan printers was named after [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]].  He worked on the genome of the common fruitfly with his wife, [[Lilian Vaughan Morgan]].  Their names were used in the development codenames for the first two generations of Morgan 3D Printers.

Morgan printers are now manufactured full-time by the inventor in a small workshop factory in the House4Hack makerspace.

==Versions==
There are four versions of the RepRap Morgan, the Morgan v1 (codenamed Thomas), Morgan Pro, Morgan Mega and Morgan Pro 2 (codenamed Lilian).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.morgan3dp.com/|title=Morgan 3D Printers - Robotic 3D prototypers manufactured in South Africa|website=Morgan 3D Printers|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.htxt.co.za/2015/03/20/reprap-mega-morgan-is-a-supersized-sa-designed-3d-printer/|title=RepRap Mega Morgan is a supersized SA-designed 3D printer|last=adamoxford|date=2015-03-20|website=htxt.africa|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery mode="packed"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4001">'''Retention and protention''' ({{lang-de|Retention und Protention}}) are key aspects of [[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[temporality]]. 

==Overview==
Our experience of the world is not of a series of unconnected moments. Indeed, it would be impossible to have an experience of the world if we did not have a sense of [[temporality]]. That our perception brings an impression to our minds depends upon retention and protention. 

'''Retention''' is the process whereby a phase of a perceptual act is retained in our consciousness. It is a presentation of that which is no longer before us and is distinct from immediate experience. A simple example might be that of watching a ball being thrown. We retain where the ball was in our minds to understand the momentum of the ball as we perceive it in the immediate present. Retention is not a representation or memory but a presentation of a temporally extended present. That is, a present that extends beyond the few short milliseconds that are registered in a moment of sense perception. 

'''Protention''' is our anticipation of the next moment. The moment that has yet to be perceived. Again, using the example of a ball, our focus shifts along the expected path the ball will take. 

According to Husserl, perception has three temporal aspects, retention, the immediate present and protention and a flow through which each moment of protention becomes the retention of the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first=Francisco| last=Varela| author-link=Francisco Varela | title=The Specious Present : A Neurophenomenology of Time Consciousness | publisher=Stanford University Press | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] describes the temporal phenomenology of perception in the [[Phenomenology of Perception]] as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Husserl uses the terms protentions and retentions for the intentionalities which anchor me to an environment. They do not run from a central I, but from my perceptual field itself, so to speak, which draws along in its wake its own horizon of retentions, and bites into the future with its protentions. I do not pass through a series of instances of now, the images of which I preserve and which, placed end to end, make a line. With the arrival of every moment, its predecessor undergoes a change: I still have it in hand and it is still there, but already it is sinking away below the level of presents; in order to retain it, I need to reach through a thin layer of time. It is still the preceding moment, and I have the power to rejoin it as it was just now; I am not cut off from it, but still it would not belong to the past unless something had altered, unless it were beginning to outline itself against, or project itself upon, my present, whereas a moment ago it was my present. When a third moment arrives, the second undergoes a new modification; from being a retention it becomes the retention of a retention, and the layer of time between it and me thickens."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first=Maurice| last=Merleau-Ponty| author-link=Maurice Merleau-Ponty | title=Phenomenology of Perception | publisher=Routledge | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Interesting links with this theory come from current neuroscience which shows that present, past and future are always intertwined, also in memory. Accordingly, “memory is not only about the past, but is also about the future. Indeed, while memory serves as the ability to recall previous experiences, recall itself is not solely directed toward the past, but is guided by the present for the service of the future”.&lt;ref&gt;Ofengenden, Tzofit (2014).

'''Robert Henry Lawrence Phillipson''' (born 18 March 1942 in [[Gourock]], [[Scotland]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albumacademicum.uva.nl/ R.H.L. Phillipson, 1942 -] at the University of Amsterdam ''Album Academicum'' website.&lt;/ref&gt; is Research Professor at [[Copenhagen Business School]]'s Department of English. He is perhaps best known for writing ''[[Linguistic Imperialism]]'' and ''[[English-Only Europe?]]: Challenging Language Policy'' (translated in [[Esperanto]] by István Ertl: ''Ĉu nur-angla Eŭropo?

He got his PhD from the [[University of Amsterdam]] and his interests include [[language pedagogy]], [[language policy]], and [[linguistic human rights]].

On 21 February 2010, Phillipson was awarded the [[Linguapax Prize]] along with [[Miquel Siguan i Soler]]. [[Linguapax Institute]] describes them as "renowned advocates of multilingual education as a factor of peace and of linguistic rights against cultural and linguistic homogenization processes". &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linguapax.org/en/news/2010/02/21/miquel-siguan-and-robert-phillipson-linguapax-award-2010-ex-aequo "Linguapax Award 2010"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613050334/http://www.linguapax.org/en/news/2010/02/21/miquel-siguan-and-robert-phillipson-linguapax-award-2010-ex-aequo |date=13 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], applying the '''Schwarz reflection principle''' is a way to extend the domain of definition of an [[analytic function]] of a [[complex variable]], ''F'', which is defined on the [[upper half-plane]] and has well-defined and [[real number]] boundary values on the [[real axis]]. In that case, the putative extension of ''F'' to the rest of the [[complex plane]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{F(\bar{z})}&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;F(\bar{z})=\overline{F(z)}.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, we make the definition that agrees along the real axis.

The result proved by [[Hermann Schwarz]] is as follows. Suppose that ''F'' is a [[continuous function]] on the closed upper half plane &lt;math&gt;\left\{ z \in \mathbb{C}\ |\ \mathrm{Im}(z) \geq 0 \right\} &lt;/math&gt;, [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] on the upper half plane &lt;math&gt;\left\{ F(z) \in \mathbb{C}\ |\ \mathrm{Im}(z) &gt; 0 \right\} &lt;/math&gt;, which takes real values on the real axis. Then the extension formula given above is an [[analytic continuation]] to the whole complex plane.

In practice it would be better to have a theorem that allows ''F'' certain singularities, for example ''F'' a [[meromorphic function]]. To understand such extensions, one needs a proof method that can be weakened. In fact [[Morera's theorem]] is well adapted to proving such statements. [[Contour integral]]s involving the extension of ''F'' clearly split into two, using part of the real axis. So, given that the principle is rather easy to prove in the special case from Morera's theorem, understanding the proof is enough to generate other results.

The principle also adapts to apply to [[harmonic function]]s.

In [[epistemology]] (theory of knowledge), a '''self-evident proposition''' is a proposition that is known to be true by understanding its meaning without [[Logical argument|proof]],{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2014}} and/or by ordinary [[human reason]].

Some epistemologists deny that any proposition can be self-evident. For most others, one's belief that oneself is [[consciousness|conscious]] is offered as an example of self-evidence. However, one's belief that someone else is conscious is not epistemically self-evident.

The following proposition is often said to be self-evident:
* ''A finite whole is greater than, or equal to, any of its parts

Also self evident is the statement that two plus two is equal to four.

A [[logical argument]] for a self-evident conclusion would demonstrate only an ignorance of the purpose of persuasively arguing for the conclusion based on one or more premises that differ from it (see ''[[ignoratio elenchi]]'' and [[begging the question]]).

==Analytic propositions==
It is sometimes said that a self-evident proposition is one whose denial is self-contradictory. It is also sometimes said that an [[analytic–synthetic distinction|analytic proposition]] is one whose denial is self-contradictory. But the concepts mean different things.{{elucidate|date=October 2015}}

Provided that one understands and believes a self-evident proposition, self-evident propositions are not in need of proof. Likewise, that their denial is self-contradictory does not have to be proven. It is in this sense that the self-contradictions at work in self-evident and analytic propositions are different.

Not all analytic propositions are self-evident, and it is sometimes claimed that not all self-evident propositions are analytic: e.g. my knowledge that I am conscious.

==Other uses==
Claims of ''self-evidence'' also exist outside of epistemology.

===Informal speech===
In informal speech, ''self-evident'' often merely means ''obvious'', but the epistemological definition is more strict.

===Moral propositions===
Moral propositions may also be regarded as self-evident. For example, [[Alexander Hamilton]] cited the following moral propositions as self-evident in the [[Federalist No. 37]]:
* ''The means ought to be proportioned to the end.''
* ''Every power ought to be commensurate with its object.''
* ''There ought to be no limitation of a power destined to effect a purpose which is itself incapable of limitation.''

A famous claim of the self-evidence of a moral truth is in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], which states, "We hold these Truths to be ''self-evident'', that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their [[Creator deity|Creator]] with certain [[Inalienable rights|unalienable Rights]], that among these are [[Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness|Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness]]."; philosophically, these propositions' self-evidence is debatable.

Another classic example in epistemology are the claims by the Vedas (Vedanta) to be self-evident.

'''Short shackling''' is a technique that [[United States|American]] [[interrogator]]s have been reported to use in the [[War on Terror]]. According to a military report the suspect's hands are [[shackle]]d to an [[eyebolt]] on the floor, so that the suspect is forced to lie in a [[fetal position]] or [[squatting position]].&lt;ref name="CSHRA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanrights.ucdavis.edu/projects/the-guantanamo-testimonials-project/testimonies/testimony-of-the-department-of-justice/observations-regarding-specific-techniques/b-prolonged-shackling-and-stress-positions|title=Prolonged Shackling and Stress Positions|publisher=[[The Center for the Study of Human Rights in the Americas]]|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the suspect's feet are also bound to the eyebolt, similar to [[Hogtie|hogtying]], but this has not been confirmed in any government reports. This [[interrogation]] technique can cause flesh wounds.

'''Simulated reality''' is the [[hypothesis]] that [[reality]] could be simulated—for example by [[quantum computer]]  [[computer simulation|simulation]]—to a degree indistinguishable from "true" reality. It could contain conscious minds which may or may not be fully aware that they are living inside a simulation. This is quite different from the current, technologically achievable concept of [[virtual reality]]. Virtual reality is easily distinguished from the experience of actuality; participants are never in doubt about the nature of what they experience. Simulated reality, by contrast, would be hard or impossible to separate from "true" reality. There has been much debate over this topic, ranging from philosophical discourse to practical applications in [[computing]].

==Arguments==

===Simulation argument===

{{Main|Simulation hypothesis}}

A version of the simulation hypothesis was first theorised as a part of a philosophical argument on the part of [[René Descartes]], and later by [[Hans Moravec]].&lt;ref name="frc.ri.cmu.edu"&gt;Moravec, Hans, [http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1998/SimConEx.98.html Simulation, Consciousness, Existence]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moravec, Hans, Platt, Charles [https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.10/moravec.html?pg=6&amp;topic=&amp;topic_set= Superhumanism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moravec, Hans [http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1992/CyberPigs.html Pigs in Cyberspace]&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] developed an expanded argument examining the probability of our reality being a simulation.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bostrom, Nick |journal=Philosophical Quarterly |date=2003 |volume=53 |issue=211 |pages=243-255 |url=http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html |title=Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?}}&lt;/ref&gt; His argument states that at least one of the following statements is very likely to be true:

:1. Human civilization or a comparable civilization is unlikely to reach a level of [[transhumanism|technological maturity]] capable of producing simulated realities or such simulations are physically impossible to construct.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"/&gt;
:2. A comparable civilization reaching aforementioned technological status will likely not produce a significant number of simulated realities (one that might push the probable existence of digital entities beyond the probable number of "real" entities in a Universe) for any of a number of reasons, such as diversion of computational processing power for other tasks, ethical considerations of holding entities captive in simulated realities, etc.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"/&gt;
:3. Any entities with our general set of experiences are almost certainly living in a simulation.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"/&gt;
:4. We are living in a reality in which posthumans have not developed yet and we are actually living in reality.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"/&gt;

Bostrom's argument rests on the premise that given sufficiently advanced technology, it is possible to represent the populated surface of the Earth without recourse to [[digital physics]]; that the [[qualia]] experienced by a [[simulated consciousness]] are comparable or equivalent to those of a naturally occurring human consciousness, and that one or more levels of simulation within simulations would be feasible given only a modest expenditure of computational resources in the real world.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"/&gt;

If one assumes first that humans will not be destroyed nor destroy themselves before developing such a technology, and that human descendants will have no overriding legal restrictions or moral compunctions against simulating biospheres or their own historical biosphere, then, Bostrom argues, it would be unreasonable to count ourselves among the small minority of genuine organisms who, sooner or later, will be vastly outnumbered by artificial simulations.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"/&gt;

[[Epistemology|Epistemologically]], it is not impossible to tell whether we are living in a simulation. For example, Bostrom suggests that a window could ''pop up'' saying: "You are living in a simulation. Click here for more information." However, imperfections in a simulated environment might be difficult for the native inhabitants to identify and for purposes of authenticity, even the simulated memory of a blatant revelation might be purged programmatically. Nonetheless, should any evidence come to light, either for or against the skeptical hypothesis, it would radically alter the aforementioned probability.&lt;ref name="bostrom2003"/&gt;

===Computationalism===
{{Main|Computationalism|Mathematical universe hypothesis}}
[[Computationalism]] is a [[philosophy of mind]] theory stating that [[cognition]] is a form of [[computation]]. It is relevant to the [[Simulation hypothesis]] in that it illustrates how a simulation could contain conscious subjects, as required by a "[[Simulated reality#Virtual people|virtual people]]" simulation. For example, it is well known that physical systems can be simulated to some degree of accuracy. If computationalism is correct and if there is no [[hard problem of consciousness|problem]] in generating [[artificial consciousness]] or cognition, it would establish the theoretical possibility of a simulated reality. Nevertheless, the relationship between cognition and phenomenal [[qualia]] of consciousness is [[chinese room|disputed]]. It is possible that [[consciousness]] requires a [[vitalism|vital substrate]] that a computer cannot provide and that simulated people, while behaving appropriately, would be [[philosophical zombie]]s. This would undermine [[Nick Bostrom]]'s simulation argument; we cannot be a simulated consciousness, if consciousness, as we know it, cannot be simulated. The skeptical hypothesis remains intact, however, and we could still be [[brain in a vat|envatted brain]]s, existing as conscious beings within a simulated environment, even if consciousness cannot be simulated. It has been suggested that whereas virtual reality would enable a participant to experience only three senses (sight, sound and optionally smell), simulated reality would enable all five (including taste and touch).{{fact|date=August 2017}}

Some theorists&lt;ref&gt;[http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/ Bruno Marchal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hpcoders.com.au/nothing.html Russel Standish]&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that if the "consciousness-is-computation" version of [[computationalism]] and [[mathematical realism]] (or radical [[mathematical Platonism]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hut |first1=P. |last2=Alford |first2=M. |last3=Tegmark |first3=M. |year=2006 |title=On Math, Matter and Mind |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=765–794 |arxiv=physics/0510188 |bibcode=2006FoPh...36..765H |doi=10.1007/s10701-006-9048-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; are true then consciousnesses is computation, which in principle is [[universal Turing machine|platform independent]] and thus admits of simulation. This argument states that a "Platonic realm" or [[ultimate ensemble]] would contain every algorithm, including those which implement consciousness. [[Hans Moravec]] has explored the simulation hypothesis and has argued for a kind of mathematical Platonism according to which every object (including, for example, a stone) can be regarded as implementing every possible computation.&lt;ref name="frc.ri.cmu.edu"/&gt;

===Dreaming===
{{Further|Dream argument}}

A dream could be considered a type of simulation capable of fooling someone who is asleep. As a result, the "dream hypothesis" cannot be ruled out, although it has been argued that [[common sense]] and considerations of [[Occam's razor|simplicity]] rule against it.&lt;ref&gt;"There is no logical impossibility in the supposition that the whole of life is a dream, in which we ourselves create all the objects that come before us. But although this is not logically impossible, there is no reason whatever to suppose that it is true; and it is, in fact, a less simple hypothesis, viewed as a means of accounting for the facts of our own life, than the common-sense hypothesis that there really are objects independent of us, whose action on us causes our sensations." [[Bertrand Russell]], ''The Problems of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the first philosophers to question the distinction between [[reality]] and [[dream]]s was [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], a [[China|Chinese]] philosopher from the 4th century BC.  He phrased the problem as the well-known "Butterfly Dream," which went as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Once Zhuangzi dreamt he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting and fluttering around, happy with himself and doing as he pleased. He didn't know he was Zhuangzi. Suddenly he woke up and there he was, solid and unmistakable Zhuangzi. But he didn't know if he was Zhuangzi who had dreamt he was a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming he was Zhuangzi. Between Zhuangzi and a butterfly there must be ''some'' distinction! This is called the Transformation of Things. (2, tr. Burton Watson 1968:49)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The philosophical underpinnings of this argument are also brought up by [[Descartes]], who was one of the first [[Western World|Western]] philosophers to do so. In ''Meditations on First Philosophy'', he states "... there are no certain indications by which we may clearly distinguish wakefulness from sleep",&lt;ref name="Des"&gt;René Descartes, Meditations on the First Philosophy, from Descartes, The Philosophical Works of Descartes, trans. Elizabeth S. Haldane and G.R.T. Ross (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1911 – reprinted with corrections 1931), Volume I, 145-46.&lt;/ref&gt; and goes on to conclude that "It is possible that I am dreaming right now and that all of my perceptions are false".&lt;ref name="Des"/&gt;

Chalmers (2003) discusses the dream hypothesis and notes that this comes in two distinct forms:
* that he is ''currently'' dreaming, in which case many of his beliefs about the world are incorrect;
* that he has ''always'' been dreaming, in which case the objects he perceives actually exist, albeit in his imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, J., [http://consc.net/papers/matrix.html The Matrix as Metaphysics], Department of Philosophy, University of Arizona&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the [[dream argument]] and the [[simulation hypothesis]] can be regarded as [[skeptical hypothesis|skeptical hypotheses]]; however in raising these doubts, just as [[Descartes]] noted that his own thinking led him to be convinced of his own existence, the existence of the argument itself is testament to the possibility of its own truth. Another state of mind in which some argue an individual's perceptions have no physical basis in the real world is called [[psychosis]] though psychosis may have a physical basis in the real world and explanations vary.

The dream hypothesis is also used to develop other philosophical concepts, such as Valberg's [[personal horizon]]: what this world would be internal to if ''this'' were all a dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Valberg|first=J.J.|title=Dream, Death, and the Self|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691128597|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8416.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nested simulations===
The existence of simulated reality is unprovable in any concrete sense: any "evidence" that is directly observed could be another simulation itself. In other words, there is an [[infinite regress]] problem with the argument. Even if we are a simulated reality, there is no way to be sure the beings running the simulation are not themselves a simulation and the operators of ''that'' simulation are not a simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Simulation Argument: Some Explanations |first=Nick |last=Bostrom |year=2009 |url=http://www.simulation-argument.com/brueckner.pdf |quote=If each first-level ancestor-simulation run by the non-Sims requires more resources (because they contain within themselves additional second-level ancestor-simulations run by the Sims), the non-Sims might well respond by producing fewer first-level ancestor-simulations. Conversely, the cheaper it is for the non-Sims to run a simulation, the more simulations they may run. It is therefore unclear whether the total number of ancestor-simulations would be greater if Sims run ancestor-simulations than if they do not.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"{{vanchor|Recursive simulation}} involves a simulation or an entity in the simulation, creating another instance of the same simulation, running it and using its results" (Pooch and Sullivan 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=U.W. |last=Pooch |first2=F.J. |last2=Sullivan |year=2000 |url= http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/WSC.2000.899898 |journal=Simulation Conference |volume=1 |pages=958 |edition=Winter |title=Recursive simulation to aid models of decisionmaking |isbn=0-7803-6579-8 |doi=10.1109/WSC.2000.899898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses of the simulation hypothesis in philosophy===

Besides attempting to assess whether the simulation hypothesis is true or false, philosophers have also used it to illustrate other philosophical problems, especially in [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]].  [[David Chalmers]] has argued that simulated beings might wonder whether their [[Mind|mental]] lives are governed by the [[physics]] of their environment, when in fact these mental lives are simulated separately (and are thus, in fact, not governed by the simulated physics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://consc.net/notes/dualism.html|title=How Cartesian Dualism Might Have Been True|last=Chalmers|first=David|date=January 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They might eventually find that their thoughts fail to be physically [[causality|caused]].  Chalmers argues that this means that [[mind-body dualism|Cartesian dualism]] is not necessarily as problematic of a philosophical view as is commonly supposed, though he does not endorse it.

Similarly, Vincent Conitzer has used the following computer simulation scenarios to illuminate [[further facts]]—facts that do not follow logically from the physical facts—about [[qualia]] (what it is ''like'' to have specific experiences), [[indexicality]] (what time it is ''now'' and who ''I'' am), and [[personal identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conitzer|first=Vincent|title=A Puzzle about Further Facts|journal=Erkenntnis|arxiv=1802.01161|doi=10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imagine a person in the real world who is observing a simulated world on a screen, from the perspective of one of the simulated agents in it. (This is not the kind of simulated reality that is the topic of this article, but we will get to such a simulated reality in the next step of the argument.) The person observing knows that besides the [[computer code|code]] responsible for the physics of the simulation, there must be ''additional'' code that determines in which colors the simulation is displayed on the screen, and which agent's perspective is displayed. (These questions are related to the [[inverted spectrum]] scenario and whether there are further facts about personal identity.) That is, the person can conclude that the facts about the physics of the simulation (which are completely captured by the code governing the physics) do not fully determine her [[consciousness|experience]] by themselves. But then, Conitzer argues, imagine someone who has become so engrossed in the simulation that she has ''forgotten'' that it is a simulation she is watching. For this to be the case, the simulation needs to have an exceptionally high fidelity, bringing us into the territory of simulated reality.  (This situation also resembles the one in the [[dream argument]] discussed above.) In this case, could she not still reach the same conclusion that the facts about the physics (of the simulated reality, though she does not realize it is simulated) do not fully determine her experience by themselves? And if so, can we not conclude the same in our own daily lives?

[[Social constructionism]], a branch of [[sociology]], queries commonly held views on the nature of reality, touching on themes of normality and abnormality within the context of power and oppression in societal structures.
The concept of a '''social construction of schizophrenia''', within a social construction of health and illness notary form, denotes that the label of 'schizophrenia' is one that has been socially constructed through ideological systems, none of which are truly [[empirical]] especially as currently there is no definitive evidence as to the cause(s) of [[schizophrenia]].

==Introduction==
In 1966, Berger and Luckman coined the term ''social constructionism'' in their work ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]''. In summary it examines the basis of fact and truth / knowledge within culture. Whilst some 'truths' such as 'fire is hot' are universally agreed as objective, many others considered 'fact' are the result of a common subjective experience and the subsequent validation of that.

Walker has argued that psychiatric diagnoses are nothing but linguistic abstractions. He has criticized the [[DSM-IV]]'s poor reliability and postulated that terms like 'schizophrenia' and 'mental illness' only exist by consensus and persist by convention. Further he argues that the pathologizing language which persists in the [[medical model of disability]] is unuseful in working towards a recovery model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Walker MT |year=2006 |title=The Social Construction of Mental Illness and its Implications for the Recovery Model |journal=International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=71–87 |url=http://www.psychosocial.com/IJPR_10/Social_Construction_of_MI_and_Implications_for_Recovery_Walker.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable practitioners and authors within the humanistic tradition that have viewed schizophrenia as a social construction include psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]] (1920–2012), [[Joseph Berke]], [[R.D. Laing]], [[Erich Fromm]] and [[Mary Barnes]]. Szasz viewed the diagnoses as a fabrication that is borderline abusive in terms of treatment. Szasz has protested against the taxonomic classifications of mental illness and [[reification (fallacy)|reification]] of these as 'science' and has long argued against institutionalisation as a fundamental deprivation of liberty. In Berke's and Barnes's book ''two accounts of a journey through madness'', Berke explores themes of psychosis as an enriching experience. Berke argues that the invalidation of schizophrenic experiences labelled 'sick or mad' is a uniquely western standpoint insofar as dream states and altered perception are not considered valid modes of interpolation of the truth within westernised culture.&lt;ref name="BarnesBerke2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Barnes|author2=Joseph H. Berke|title=Mary Barnes: two accounts of a journey through madness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V0BnPPdBKG4C|accessdate=23 October 2010|date=17 March 2002|publisher=Other Press, LLC|isbn=978-1-59051-016-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laing (1964) commented “the mad things done and said by the schizophrenic will remain essentially a closed book if one does not understand their existential context”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Roberts GA |year=2000 |title=Narrative and severe mental illness:what place do stories have in an evidence-based world? |journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment |volume=6 |pages=432–441 |url=http://apt.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/6/6/432 |doi=10.1192/apt.6.6.432 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noll (1983) has explored the links between [[shamanism]] and schizophrenia, testing the research evidence on shamanism against the [[DSM-III]] diagnostic criterion. Though he draws comparisons between the two states of mind in terms of the phenomenon experienced, he draws out important differences between shamanic and schizophrenic states, notably that many people on the schizophrenic spectrum do not voluntarily enter an altered state of consciousness whereas research into shamanism unilaterally shows that shamanic states are induced and controlled voluntarily by the shaman, who ultimately maintains a healthy world view between a base line level of consciousness and an altered state of consciousness. He concludes that differences between schizophrenic and shamanic states such as 'volition', mean that the DSM-III cannot be used to define shamanism as the same state as schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Noll, Richard |year=1983 |title=Shamanism and Schizophrenia.A State-Specific approach to the 'Schizophrenia Metaphor of shamanic states' |journal=American Ethnologist |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=443–459 |doi=10.1525/ae.1983.10.3.02a00030 |jstor=644263}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Sapolsky]] has theorized that shamanism is practiced by [[schizotypal]] individuals rather than schizophrenics.&lt;ref&gt;"Dr. Robert Sapolsky's lecture about Biological Underpinnings of Religiosity" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WwAQqWUkpI]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

===Philosophy===
Themes in social constructionism draw on various philosophies centred around the differences between objective reality or that which is known or absolute and subjective reality or that which is observed by the knower . In ''Schizophrenia: A scientific delusion'', Mary Boyle explores 'schizophrenia and its assumptions as truths or knowledges which are socially produced and managed'.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, M., 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5iRH0v093OgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=schizophrenia+a+scientific+delusion&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tsadFgfZij&amp;sig=soBofdIPnjVWsQevC8Cb-A8juvA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5Vz-S9XMH6qg4QbJ-KiHDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Schizophrenia:A Scientific Delusion"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistics===
Michael Walker examines the social construction of mental illness and its implications for the recovery model. He is critical of the user becoming defined by the definer, such as if you go for behavioural therapy you come out with a perspective of rewards and punishments etc.:

"Psychology, like psychiatry, has found ways of linguistically contorting, convoluting, and confusing lived experience with essential “truths” of its own. Bill O'Hanlon, a preeminent postmodern consultant and author, uses his holiday cookie making experience to
communicate what happens in the therapy room (O'Hanlon and Wiener-Davis, 1989). A client's problem that s/he brings to therapy is like cookie dough. The experience of it is vague and malleable. Once the "blob" of cookie dough is forced through the cookie press (a tube, funnel, and mold pressed against a baking pan) it becomes a Christmas tree, star, or Santa Claus. Similarly, when a client exposes his or her problem to a therapist it gets "molded" or interpreted in the language of the therapist. So a client attending a psychodynamic therapy session would leave having unresolved childhood conflicts. The same client leaving a behaviorist's office would walk away with problem behavior shaped by reward and punishment. An interaction with a Jungian therapist would result in the need to deal with the various archetypes that apply to him or her. Talking with a diagnostically (and thereby pathologically) minded clinician will leave one with the idea that they “have” “bipolar disorder”, “depression”, “obsessive compulsive disorder”, a “mental illness” – along with all the stories that go with them (“chemical imbalances”, lifelong duration, the need to “comply” with a treatment regimen, etc.). Like cookies, continued exposure to the "heat" of the theoretical lens causes these interpretations to "harden" or "reify" (to make real)." O'Hanlon concludes that if our languaging creates “the problem” then why not leverage the use of language and create a problem that is easiest to solve.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Walker, Michael |year=2006 |title=The social construction of mental illness and it's implications for the recovery model |journal=Internanational journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=71–87 |url=http://www.recoverydevon.co.uk/download/The_Social_Construction_of_Mental_Illness.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213044735/http://www.recoverydevon.co.uk/download/The_Social_Construction_of_Mental_Illness.pdf |archivedate=13 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is critical of a deficit based vocabulary:

"From the perspective of linguistics we see that the reified categories (e.g. mental illness, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) are abstractions defined by clusters of what we call “symptoms.” Schizophrenia is defined as the presence of audio hallucinations (or other “thought disorders”) in the absence of a “mood disorder.” You can even throw in other correlates like “negative symptoms”, PET scans, response to medications, etc. The issue of the DSM's poor reliability and validity aside (Caplan, 1995; Sparks, Duncan, &amp; Miller, 2005), the term “schizophrenia” is a word used to communicate the presence of these “symptoms.” The various human manifestations of thought, feeling, and behavior (aka “symptoms”) exist like the chair you are sitting on as you read this exists. But the next level of abstraction, the word “schizophrenia”, and the next, “mental illness”, only exist through consensus and only persist by convention. Even if the correlations of defining symptoms was perfect (which it is far from), in light of the linguistic paradigm we have to ask ourselves whether using a pathologizing, deficit-based vocabulary is useful in helping people improve the quality of their lives."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Power and control===

Post Structuralist [[Jürgen Habermas]] examines questions of identity in the concept of societal integration and discusses how change occurs when there is a legitimation crisis. 
It assists the understanding of the social construction of schizophrenia and other illness in also understanding forces that shape power imbalances in aetiologies. Phil Brown in ''Naming and Framing : The social construction of diagnosis and illness'' points out how professionals were very slow and unwilling to accept the diagnosis of '[[Tardive dyskinesia]]', despite many research indicated warnings on it, as it was iatrogenic  (caused by) prescription drugs that had been plaudited to be successful in treatment of the associated condition of psychoses. Market forces in pharmacology and/or cultural embarrassment can shape the rate at which society adapts to include new frameworks such as those demonstrated in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brown, Phil |year=1995 |title=Naming and Framing : The Social construction of Diagnosis and Illness |journal=Journal of health and social behaviour |volume=35 |issue=extra issue |pages=34–52 |url=http://instituty.fsv.cuni.cz/~kabele/archiv/Mirek/SC_illness.pdf |doi=10.2307/2626956 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718170606/http://instituty.fsv.cuni.cz/~kabele/archiv/Mirek/SC_illness.pdf |archivedate=18 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conrad writes on medicalization and social control. He looks at the process of science and medicalization . Science is heralded as the new religion in terms of ideological power and Conrad describes how medicalization can be used to police morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Conrad, Peter |year=1992 |title=Medicalization and social control |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |volume=18|pages=209–232 |url=http://people.uncw.edu/ricej/deviance/Medicalization%20of%20Deviance,%20by%20Conrad%20and%20Schneider.pdf |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.18.1.209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The social construction of illness, key insights and policy implications", Conrad and Barker trace the history of the construction of illness from symbolic interactionists and medical sociologists and examine how society reacts in situations to the distinctions such as the construction of gender from sex and the construction of illness from disease :

"Framing anger in women as evidence of the disease PMS, to be treated with antidepressants, trivializes the impact of gender inequality on women’s daily lives. And when difficulties in children’s attention and behavior get defined as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), school policies increasingly encourage the use of medication and special accommodations for learning disabled students; yet these responses fail to address the social and nonmedical causes of children’s classroom inattention or agitation, such as increasing class size or the termination of physical education programs (Conrad 1975).
In each case, and many others, the process by which human problems become medicalized in the first place is largely ignored in creating policy toward these issues. A social constructionist approach provides a means of understanding how such problems come to be defined in medical terms and how this translates into public policy (see Gusfield 1981). As the above examples attest, medicalized constructions can also be strongly evaluative (i.e., they suggest how people ought to behave) and result in policies that authorize social control." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Conrad, P. |author2=Kristen, K.. |year=2010 |title=The social construction of illness, key insights and policy implications |journal=Journal of health and social behaviour |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=S67-S69 |url=http://hsb.sagepub.com/content/51/1_suppl/S67.full.pdf+html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031100543/http://hsb.sagepub.com/content/51/1_suppl/S67.full.pdf+html |archivedate=31 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They conclude that in an information age . new social groupings emerging may challenge the social constructions of illness and force policy changes.

Foucault examines power systems that incur on the operation of institutions and professionals:

“The first task of the doctor is ... political: the struggle against disease must begin with a war against bad government." Man will be totally and definitively cured only if he is first liberated...” &lt;ref&gt;Foucault, M., 1973, The Birth of the Clinic: An Archaeology of Medical Perception, Tavistock publications limited, available at http://monoskop.org/images/9/92/Foucault_Michel_The_Birth_of_the_Clinic_1976.pdf [accessed 14 November 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK parliament in a key issues statement for 2015 references a 1957 statement by the royal commission but queries its impact some 60 years later:

“Most people are coming to regard mental illness and disability in much the same way as physical illness and disability”
(Report of the Royal Commission on the law relating to mental illness and mental deficiency, 1957)

"Anti-stigma campaigns and the growing profile of mental health issues in recent years appear to have gone some way to changing views and dispelling misconceptions about mental illness. But with nine in ten people with mental health problems still experiencing stigma and discrimination, nearly sixty years after the Royal Commission’s optimistic assessment, there may still be some way to go in changing public attitudes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=UK Parliament |year=2015 |title=Tackling social stigma on mental health: Key issues for the 2015 Parliament |url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/key-issues-parliament-2015/social-change/mental-health-stigma/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain oppressions in the UK were removed by the [[Mental Health (Discrimination) Act 2013]]

===The self and identity===
Research directions here are on the importance of experiential narrative within psychiatric dialogue. Some research is critical of modern psychiatric adoption of an 'empiricist-behavioural approach' within the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]. Nelson, Yung, Bechdolf and McGorry examine this in context of a phenomonological approach to the understanding of ultra high risk psychiatric disorders. They criticize psychiatric research that addresses subjectivity:

"When attempts have been made to address subjectivity, the psychiatric researcher is left without the requisite conceptual tools. Instead, this form of research has tended to live out Abraham Maslow’s statement ‘‘If the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to treat everything as if it were a nail.’’ That is, the subjective has been approached in operational terms..."
&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Yung, Bechdolf, McGorry.,2008, [http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/34/2/381.pdf "The Phenomenological Critique and Self-disturbance: Implications for Ultra-High Risk ‘Prodrome’ Research"], Schizophrenia Bulletin ,34(2) pp381-392&lt;/ref&gt;

'Mad Studies' is an emerging field of study wherein the user movement seeks to reclaim words such as mad and loony and redefine how psychiatry envisages the concept of madness, refuting where user experiences have been co-opted into psychiatric definitions . Mad Studies provides a construct whereby people with 'negative' mental health seek to be identified as part of the neuro-diversity of the human race. 
“We write at a time when activist concepts such as recovery, inclusion, access and hope have been co-opted, appropriated and politically neutralised by policy-makers, service-providers and government (Costa 2009; McWade 2014; Morgan 2013). User-led services and organisations continue to be most severely affected by spending cuts (Morris 2011), whilst anti-stigma campaigns endorsed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists continue to be pumped with millions of pounds to sell a sanitised version of ‘mental health’ to the masses (Armstrong 2014). Personalisation has been implemented through a free market ideology that has seen the dispossession and even some deaths of disabled people. It is ‘time to talk’, and not in the way the establishment wants us to, with individualised and neatly packaged tales of recovery. Instead, let us build upon the rich histories of activism and bring our shared experiences of oppression and marginalisation together” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mcwade |author2=Milton |author3=Beresford |year=2015 |title=Mad studies and neurodiversity: a dialogue |journal=Disability &amp; Society|volume=30 | issue = 2 |pages=71–87 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09687599.2014.1000512 |doi=10.1080/09687599.2014.1000512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple way of looking at it is a slogan adopted by self-advocates 'nothing about us, without us', encouraging educators to co-teach with people who have lived experience of mental illness or distress.
A key concept in this ontolology is the idea of san[e]ism – a sixth structural oppression to go alongside those associated with race, gender, disability, age and class. It is also defined as [[Mentalism (discrimination)]] :
“From where we stand, san[e]ism is a devestating [sic?] form of oppression, often leading to negative stereotyping, discrimination, or arguments that Mad individuals are not fit for professional practice or, indeed, for life (Poole et al., 2012). According to Kalinowski and Risser (2005), sane[e]ism also allows for a binary that separates people into a power-up group and a power-down group. The power-up group is assumed to be normal, healthy and capable. The power-down group is assumed to be sick, disabled, unreliable, and, possibly violent. This factional splitting ensures a lower standard of service for the power-down group and allows the power-up group to judge, reframe and belittle the power-down group in pathological terms”.&lt;ref&gt;LeFrançois, B., Menzies, R. 2013, "Mad Matters: A Critical Reader in Canadian Mad Studies, “Breaking open the bone", pp 96-97, Canadian Scholars press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movement to reconstruct schizophrenia==
{{Main|Hearing Voices Movement}}

''Alternative Perception'' is one of several names suggested by the [[schizophrenic]] user movement to replace the term [[schizophrenia]] which is on a [[spectrum]] of psychotic disorders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ahmed, Iqbal |author2=Fujii, Daryl |title=The spectrum of psychotic disorders: neurobiology, etiology, and pathogenesis |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-521-85056-8}}{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered to be outmoded by many consumers of services. Several academic authorities, notably Professor [[Marius Romme]] founder and principal theorist for the Hearing Voices Movement provide a rationale for the abandonment of this label. A symposium of some of the leading notions in this field from consumers of services and academics concluded:{{Quote|We are calling for the label of schizophrenia to be abolished as a concept because it is unscientific, stigmatising, and does not address the root causes of serious mental distress. The CASL campaign is driven by two central factors. The concept of schizophrenia is unscientific and has outlived any usefulness it may once have claimed. The label schizophrenia is extremely damaging to those to whom it is applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caslcampaign.com/|title=caslcampaign.com|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Historical construction of schizophrenia==
{{Further|History of schizophrenia}}

The terms ''[[schizophrenia]]'' and ''[[autism]]'' originated from the works of [[Eugen Bleuler]] (1857–1939) as different aspects of the same diagnostic condition. Bleuler was a contemporary of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]]. Prior to Bleuler's interventions schizophrenia was referred to as [[dementia praecox]] (early insanity) and perceived as a single disorder. Schizophrenia is sometimes also referred to as [[hebephrenia]], stemming in etymology from the Greek god [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]] who was associated with adolescence and as it was thought the onset of schizophrenia came at adolescence. It is generally acknowledged that schizophrenia can have early onset and late onset.

"He first advanced the term schizophrenia in 1908 in a paper based on a study of 647 Burghölzli patients. He then expanded on his paper of 1908 in Dementia Praecox oder Gruppe der Schizophrenie…Bleuler is credited with the introduction of two concepts fundamental to the analysis of schizophrenia: autism, denoting the loss of contact with reality, frequently through indulgence in bizarre fantasy; and ambivalence, denoting the coexistence of mutually exclusive contradictions within the psyche." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/69329/Eugen-Bleuler|title=Eugen Bleuler - Swiss psychiatrist|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schizophrenia in America is a medical diagnostic category, which in the 1970s was primarily termed differentiated and undifferentiated schizophrenia; international leaders such as R.D. Laing in Europe offered professional expertise in serving this population group. In the context of community mental health services, the broad term mental health also referred to individuals who may have this diagnosis, which may or may not be considered to be valid or relevant. The word schizophrenia is often associated with a "major mental breakdown" in common parlance which may result in the need for psychotherapy, mental health counseling, person-centered therapy,&lt;ref&gt;Moon, K.A., Witty, M., Grant, B., &amp; Rice, B. (2011). Ch. 3 The nondirective attitude in client-centered therapy. ''Practicing Client-Centered Therapy''.

==Charities committed to changing public perception==
Charities that disagree with the notion of the schizophrenia label in the U.K. include [[Mind (charity)]] and [[Rethink Mental Illness|Rethink]]. Mind state on their website "Because of differences of opinion about schizophrenia, it's not easy to identify what might cause it." Mind have previously published an explanatory leaflet, prefaced by [[Michael Palin]] that gives a definition of schizophrenia as people 'who think outside the normal range of human experience'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mind.org.uk/help/diagnoses_and_conditions/schizophrenia/|title=Schizophrenia - Mind, the mental health charity - help for mental health problems|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Alliance on Mental Illness says:

"By changing the name, consumers with the symptoms of what actually may be a [[spectrum]] of disorders would have a more accurate and descriptive name attached to their diagnosis. Ideally, they would also experience less stigma, as they left behind a name with Greek origins that roughly translates to “shattered mind” and which is often used in popular culture to mean "multiple personality disorder" or "split personality.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nami.org/Template.cfm?Section=Schizophrenia&amp;template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=40298|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20061117071330/http://www.nami.org/TextTemplate.cfm?Section%3DSchizophrenia%26template%3D/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm%26ContentID%3D40298|dead-url=yes|title=NAMI: National Alliance on Mental Illness - NAMI: The National Alliance on Mental Illness|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science of schizophrenia and comorbid conditions==
{{Main|Causes of schizophrenia}}
Whilst the definitive cause(s) of schizophrenia remain unknown, research has indicated strong links between genetic make-up, social predisposing factors or stressors and environmental conditions in relation to the development and onset of schizophrenia and other conditions. International geneticists are working towards identifying a gene for Schizophrenia, combined efforts are at the [[SzGene]] database. In the course of this research geneticists have identified specific [[genes]] or [[copy number variants]] or [[alleles]] that may explain the [[comorbidity]] of various conditions.

===Genetic links between comorbid conditions===
[[File:Chromosome 16.svg|thumb|alt=Chromosome 16 |Ideogram of human chromosome 16]]
Links between [[autism]] and [[schizophrenia]] have been studied. From clinical observation, both conditions cause a disruption in normative social functioning which may be mild or severe depending on the individual's position within the spectrum. Social cognition is under-developed in autism and highly developed in psychoses. Four genetic loci are diametrically opposed in terms of diagnoses of autism and schizophrenia, with corresponding deletions for one condition or duplications for the other. Researchers examining [[chromosome 16]] (16p11.2) identified a heredity area on the short arm of human chromosome 16 (16p11.2) which contains microduplication and microdeletion of genome variation. Microduplication of hereditary factors in this heredity area increased the individual's risk of schizophrenia more than 8–14-fold and of autism over 20-fold. A corresponding microdeletion instead of microduplication in the area affected the risk of autism only, but not of schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Crespi | first1 = B. | last2 = Badcock | first2 = C. | title = Psychosis and autism as diametrical disorders of the social brain | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–261; discussion 261–320 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X08004214 | pmid=18578904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news178822577.html "Research backs theory on autism, schizophrenia": accessed 9 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=McCarthy SE, Makarov V, Kirov G, etal |title=Microduplications of 16p11.2 are associated with schizophrenia |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=41 |issue=11 |pages=1223–7 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19855392|pmc=2951180 |doi=10.1038/ng.474}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Kumar RA, KaraMohamed S, Sudi J, etal |title=Recurrent 16p11.2 microdeletions in autism |journal=Human Molecular Genetics |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=628–38 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18156158 |doi=10.1093/hmg/ddm376}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study of ''de novo'' mutations, ''ie'' new mutations in people with both autism and schizophrenia spectrum conditions, concluded that schizophrenia and autism are due to "errors" during early [[organogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Awadalla | first1 = P. | last2 = Gauthier | first2 = J. | last3 = Myers | first3 = R.

===Genetic allelles===
Other genetic analysis examines the role of alleles. One study ascribes links between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder by studying a total group of 6909 Europeans, both diagnosed and undiagnosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Purcell SM, Wray NR, Stone JL |title=Common polygenic variation contributes to risk of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder |journal=Nature |volume=460 |issue=7256 |pages=748–52 |year=2009 |pmid=19571811 |doi=10.1038/nature08185|display-authors=etal|pmc=3912837 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study suggests that Genetic markers may be very dissimilar among different lineages of DNA in people of different cultures, making an international commonality in genetics as a precipitating factor in schizophrenia difficult to identify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McClellan JM, Susser E, King MC |title=Schizophrenia: a common disease caused by multiple rare alleles |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=190 |issue= |pages=194–9 |date=2007 |pmid=17329737 |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.106.025585}}&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;

===Social factors===
A study published in ''The Guardian'', reported on 9 December 2009, ascribes the onset of the condition to social factors. The authors of the study, which compared 500 patients with mental health problems with other ethnic groups and a control group of 350 people, claim there is an epidemic of schizophrenia amongst the Afro-Caribbean community . They refute the argument that racism may contribute to more diagnoses from psychiatrists of schizophrenia amongst members of the Afro Caribbean community and ascribe more value to deprivation and social isolation as triggering factors in those with a propensity towards schizotype personalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/dec/09/african-caribbean-schizophrenia-policy|title=Schizophrenia 'epidemic' among African Caribbeans spurs prevention policy change|first=Matthew|last=Lewin|date=8 December 2009|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical and environmental factors===

Various studies have indicated chemical precipitating factors in the development of autism or schizophrenia and also suggested that environmental factors such as toxins in the air may have precipitated a rise in the number of children born with autism. Ploeger discovered that pre-natal prescribed softenon in the 1960s and '70s led to an increase of children born with autism by 4% as opposed to a usual figure of 0.1%. Sodium valproate, a drug used as an anti-epileptic and as a mood stabilizer, increased the chance of children being born with autism sevenfold. The active component of cannabis (THC) is thought by some to increase the chances of onset of schizophrenia by 2.6 times in its skunk preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-12/aaon-edm112508.php|title=Epilepsy drug may increase risk of autism in children|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-12/nofs-aas121708.php|title=Autism and schizophrenia share common origin|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-01/uoc--ssc010709.php|title=Study shows California's autism increase not due to better counting, diagnosis|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/dec/01/skunk-users-psychosis-risk-research|title=Skunk users face greater risk of psychosis, researchers warn|first1=Sarah|last1=Boseley|first2=health|last2=editor|date=30 November 2009|publisher=|access-date=11 September 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/nov/03/david-nutt-drugs-policy|title=David Nutt: my views on drugs classification|first=David|last=Nutt|date=2 November 2009|publisher=|access-date=11 September 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time{{When|date=September 2016}} there is no publicly available research on commonalities between these chemicals that may trigger the on/off switches in neuro-receptors linked to genes responsible for conditions on the autistic or schizophrenic spectrum.

===Criticism of genetics===

Critique in terms of current genetic research is that there are many candidates for [[copy number variants]] that may predispose a likelihood of developing schizophrenia but current research is flawed by both the sample sizes available for analysis by condition population and by an incomplete understanding of 'double whammies' where one [[allele]] affects another.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schizophreniaforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=1575 "CNV 'Double Whammies' May Account for Variable Neuropsychiatric Phenotypes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129221028/http://schizophreniaforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=1575 |date=29 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has also been referred to as genetic 'dark matter' with the notion that many rare mutations have not yet been discovered.

===Evolution===

Links between [[autism]] and [[schizophrenia]] have been studied (as above). The implications are both conditions are part of the same spectrum. From clinical observation, both conditions cause a disruption in normative social functioning which may be mild or severe depending on the individual's position within the spectrum. Simon Fraser University researcher Crespi has examined how social cognition is under developed in autism and highly developed in Psychoses and outlines how the relationship between autism and schizophrenic spectrum is not one that has been explored in detail in the latter part of the 20th century. His research hypothesises that the genetic marker for both conditions may lie in the same location. His team have identified four loci that are diametrically opposed in terms of diagnoses of autism and schizophrenia with corresponding deletions for one condition or duplications for the other:
{{Quote|text="Crespi says the work supports the hypothesis that risks of autism and schizophrenia “have evolved in conjunction with the evolution and elaboration of the human social brain.”"|sign=|source=}}

Professor Timothy Crow, from the University Department of Psychiatry at Oxford University, has long argued that schizophrenia as a condition came about as a result of [[natural selection]]. He has argued that schizophrenia is a by-product of the development of language, resulting from an evolutionary change approximately 150,000 years ago, that persisted due to sexual selection. However, conversely to study in [[polygene]]s or multiple allele combinations, he maintains that the answer lies in:

===Immunology and schizophrenia===
A strand of research into schizophrenia is to investigate the links between viruses that attack the immune system such as herpes and the onset of schizophrenia. Researchers in this field are hopeful that this connection may provide a cure for schizophrenia within the next 20 years.
{{Quote|text="On the basis of the findings, perspectives for future research are outlined aiming at a precise and consequent strategy to elucidate a potential involvement of immune mechanisms in the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia."|sign=|source=}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rothermund, M. |author2=Volker, A. |author3=Bayer, T. | title=Review of Immunological and Immunopathological Findings in Schizophrenia|journal=Brain, Behaviour and immunity |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=319–339 |year=2001 |pmid= |doi=10.1006/brbi.2001.0648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muller proposes that the vulnerability-stress model of analysis of schizophrenia should become the vulnerability-stress-inflammation model:
{{Quote|text="The vulnerability-stress-inflammation model is important as stress may increase proinflammatory cytokines and even contribute to a lasting proinflammatory state. The immune system itself is considered an important further piece in the puzzle, as in autoimmune disorders in general, which are always linked to three factors: genes, the environment and the immune system. Alterations of dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission have been shown with low-level neuroinflammation and may directly be involved in the generation of schizophrenic symptoms"|sign=|source=}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Muller, N.|title=Immunology of Schizophrenia|journal=Neuroimmunomodulation|volume=21 |pages=109–116 |date=2014|doi=10.1159/000356538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that viral infections of the immune system can dramatically increase the frequency of the onset of schizophrenia.

“ a large scale Danish nationwide study on 39,076 persons with a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorders showed that the history of hospitalisation with infection increased the risk of schizophrenia by 60%” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Norbert Muller |author2=Aye-Mu Myint |author3=Markus J.

==Global moves to change the construction of 'schizophrenia' ==

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands alternative proposals for the name ''schizophrenia'' include ''dysfunctional perception syndrome'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://astridvanwoerkom.wordpress.com/2009/10/09/schizophrenia-now-called-dysfunctional-perception-syndrome/|title=Schizophrenia Now Called "Dysfunctional Perception Syndrome"|author=|date=9 October 2009|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Salience Syndrome :

"The concept of 'salience' has the potential to make the public recognize psychosis as relating to an aspect of human mentation and experience that is universal. It is proposed to introduce, analogous to the functional-descriptive term 'Metabolic syndrome', the diagnosis of 'Salience syndrome' to replace all current diagnostic categories of psychotic disorders. Within Salience syndrome, three subcategories may be identified, based on scientific evidence of relatively valid and specific contrasts, named Salience syndrome with affective expression, Salience syndrome with developmental expression and Salience syndrome not otherwise specified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=van Os J |title='Salience syndrome' replaces 'schizophrenia' in DSM-V and ICD-11: psychiatry's evidence-based entry into the 21st century? |journal=Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=363–72 |date=2009 |pmid=19807717 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2009.01456.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a [[social model of disability]] perspective, this interlinks:

{{Quote|The human mind has the ability to turn its attention to something that is salient, something that jumps out at you. We then focus on it. In some people this function is disturbed, and everything gets an enormous significance. They think, for example, that a television programme is about them, or that people who are just walking along the street are out to harm them. Research shows that this can happen to everybody under the influence of drugs, also to healthy people. The word syndrome indicates that it is about a cluster of symptoms. And not about a clearly defined illness.&lt;ref&gt;Mol., S., 2009, ‘Dysfunctional Perception Syndrome’: The new name for schizophrenia? {{cite web |url=http://www.intervoiceonline.org/assets/2010/2/5/Dysfunctional_Perception_Syndrome.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830051101/http://www.intervoiceonline.org/assets/2010/2/5/Dysfunctional_Perception_Syndrome.pdf |archivedate=30 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Japan===
In Japan "In order to contribute to reduce the stigma related to schizophrenia and to improve clinical practice in the management of the disorder, the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology changed in 2002 the old term for the disorder, ''Seishin Bunretsu Byo'' ("mind-split-disease"), into the new term of ''Togo Shitcho Sho'' ("integration disorder")…Eighty-six percent of psychiatrists in the Miyagi prefecture found the new term more suitable to inform patients of the diagnosis as well as to explain the modern concept of the disorder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sato M |title=Renaming schizophrenia: a Japanese perspective |journal=World Psychiatry |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=53–55 |year=2006|pmid=16757998 |pmc=1472254}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Japanese society of psychiatry and neurology report:
"This change is making psychoeducation much easier and is being useful to reduce misunderstandings about the illness and to decrease the stigma related to schizophrenia. The new term has been officially accepted by the Japanese medicine and media and is being adopted in the legislation in 2005."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=1414727 |title=The Yokohama Declaration: an update | pages=60–61 | volume=4 |issue=1 |journal=World Psychiatry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
In South Korea, schizophrenia has been renamed to 'Attunement Disorder'

"a new term, “Johyeonbyung (attunement disorder)”, was coined in South Korea. This term literally refers to tuning a string instrument, and metaphorically it describes schizophrenia as a disorder caused by mistuning of the brain's neural network." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lee, Y.S. |author2=et al. |title=Johyeonbyung (attunement disorder): Renaming mind splitting disorder as a way to reduce stigma of patients with schizophrenia in Korea |journal=Asian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=8 |pages=118–120 |year=2014 |doi=10.1016/j.ajp.2014.01.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

describes '''software entropy''' as follows:

:The [[second law of thermodynamics]], in principle, states that a [[closed system]]'s [[randomness|disorder]] cannot be reduced, it can only remain unchanged or increase. A measure of this disorder is [[entropy]]. This law also seems plausible for [[software system]]s; as a system is modified, its disorder, or entropy, tends to increase. This is known as '''software entropy'''.

:Within [[software development]], there are similar theories; see Lehman (1985),&lt;ref&gt;

:# A [[computer program]] that is used will be modified
:# When a program is modified, its [[complexity]] will increase, provided that one does not actively work against this.

'''Systems science''' is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field that studies the nature of [[system]]s—from simple to complex—in [[nature]], [[society]], [[cognition]], [[engineering]], [[technology]] and [[science]] itself. To systems scientists, the world can be understood as a system of systems.&lt;ref&gt; G. E. Mobus &amp; M. C. Kalton, ''Principles of Systems Science'', 2015, New York:Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; The field aims to develop interdisciplinary foundations that are applicable in a variety of areas, such as psychology, biology, medicine, communication, business management, engineering,  and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip M'Pherson]] (1974, p. 229); as cited by: Hieronymi, A. (2013), Understanding Systems Science: A Visual and Integrative Approach. ''Syst. Res.''. {{doi|10.1002/sres.2215}}. He defined systems science as "the ordered arrangement of knowledge acquired from the study of systems in the observable world, together with the application of this knowledge to the design of man-made systems."&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems science covers [[formal sciences]] such as [[complex systems]], [[cybernetics]], [[dynamical systems theory]], [[information theory]], [[linguistics]] or [[systems theory]]. It has applications in the field of the natural and social sciences and engineering, such as [[control theory]], [[operations research]], social systems theory, [[systems biology]], [[system dynamics]], [[human factors]], [[systems ecology]], [[systems engineering]] and [[systems psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Francis Heylighen]] in "What are Cybernetics and Systems Science?" on ''Principia Cybernetica Web'' (1999) systems science is an "[[Fields of science|academic domain]], that touches virtually all traditional disciplines, from [[mathematics]], [[technology]] and [[biology]] to [[philosophy]] and the [[social sciences]]."&lt;/ref&gt; Themes commonly stressed in system science are (a) holistic view, (b) interaction between a system and its embedding environment, and (c) complex (often subtle) trajectories of dynamic behavior that sometimes are stable (and thus reinforcing), while at various '[[boundary conditions]]' can become wildly unstable (and thus destructive). Concerns about Earth-scale biosphere/geosphere dynamics is an example of the nature of problems to which systems science seeks to contribute meaningful insights.

== Theories ==
Since the emergence of [[Systems theory|general systems research]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert L. Flood]] (1993) ''Dealing with Complexity: : An Introduction to the Theory and Application of Systems Science.'' p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Systems theory|systems thinking]] and systems science have developed into many [[theoretical]] frameworks.
[[Image:Henk Bikker 1991.jpg|thumb|240px|Systems notes of Henk Bikker, [[TU Delft]], 1991]]
;Systems analysis
:[[Systems analysis]] is the branch of systems science that analyzes systems, the interactions within those systems, and/or interaction with its environment,&lt;ref name="AD 1971"&gt;Anthony Debons. "Command and Control: Technology and Social Impact" in:  ''Advances in computers,'' Vol. 11. Franz L. Alt &amp; Morris Rubinoff eds. (1971). p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; often prior to their automation as computer models. This field is closely related to [[operations research]].
;Systems design
:Systems design is the process of "establishing and specifying the optimum system component configuration for achieving specific goal or objective."&lt;ref name="AD 1971"/&gt; For example in computing, systems design can define the [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[systems architecture]]  which includes many sub-architectures including [[software]] architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and [[data]], as well as security, information, and others,  for a [[computer system]] to satisfy specified [[requirement]]s.
;System dynamics
:[[System dynamics]] is an approach to understanding the behavior of [[complex system]]s over time. It offers "simulation technique for modeling business and social systems,"&lt;ref&gt;Center for Complex Adaptive Agent Systems Simulation Argonne National Laboratory (2007) ''Managing Business Complexity : Discovering Strategic Solutions with Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation: Discovering Strategic Solutions with Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation.'' Oxford University Press. p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; which deals with internal feedback loops and time delays that affect the behavior of the entire system.  What makes using system dynamics different from other approaches to studying complex systems is the use of [[feedback]] loops and [[Stock and flow|stocks and flows]].
;Systems engineering
:[[Systems engineering]] (SE) is an interdisciplinary field of [[engineering]], that focuses on the development and organization of complex [[system]]s. It is the "art and science of creating whole solutions to complex problems,"&lt;ref&gt;Derek K. Hitchins (2008) ''Systems Engineering: A 21st Century Systems Methodology.'' p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;  for example: [[signal processing]] systems, [[control system]]s and [[communication system]], or other forms of high-level modelling and design in specific fields of engineering.
;Systems methodologies
:There are several types of Systems Methodologies, that is, disciplines for analysis of systems. For example:
:* [[Soft systems methodology]] (SSM) : in the field of organizational studies is an approach to organisational process modelling, and it can be used both for general [[problem]] solving and in the management of change. It was developed in [[England]] by academics at the [[University of Lancaster]] Systems Department through a ten-year Action Research programme.
:* [[System development methodology]] (SDM) in the field of IT development is a variety of structured, organized processes for developing information technology and embedded software systems.
:* [[Viable systems approach]] (vSa) is a methodology useful for the understanding and governance of complex phenomena; it has been successfully proposed in the field of management, decision making, marketing and service.
;Systems theories
:[[Systems theory]] is an interdisciplinary field that studies [[complex system]]s in [[nature]], [[society]], and [[science]].  More specifically, it is a conceptual framework by which one can analyze and/or describe any group of objects that work in concert to produce some result.
;Systems science
:Systems sciences are scientific disciplines partly based on systems thinking such as [[chaos theory]], [[complex systems]], [[control theory]], [[cybernetics]], [[sociotechnical systems theory]], [[systems biology]], [[systems chemistry]], [[systems ecology]], [[systems psychology]] and the already mentioned systems dynamics, systems engineering, and systems theory.

== Systems scientists ==
{{Main|List of systems scientists}}
General systems scientists can be divided into different generations. The founders of the systems movement like [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], [[Kenneth Boulding]], [[Ralph Gerard]], [[James Grier Miller]], [[George J. Klir]], and [[Anatol Rapoport]] were all born between 1900 and 1920. They all came from different natural and social science disciplines and joined forces in the 1950s to establish the general systems theory [[paradigm]]. Along with the organization of their efforts a first generation of systems scientists rose.

Among them were other scientists like Ackoff, Ashby, Margaret Mead and Churchman, who popularized the systems concept in the 1950s and 1960s. These scientists inspired and educated a second generation with more notable scientists like [[Ervin Laszlo]] (1932) and [[Fritjof Capra]] (1939), who wrote about systems theory in the 1970s and 1980s. Others got acquainted and started studying these works in the 1980s and started writing about it since the 1990s. [[Debora Hammond]] can be seen as a typical representative of these third generation of general systems scientists.

== Organizations ==
{{Main|List of systems sciences organizations}}

The [[International Society for the Systems Sciences]] (ISSS) is an organisation for interdisciplinary collaboration and synthesis of systems sciences. The ISSS is unique among systems-oriented institutions in terms of the breadth of its scope, bringing together scholars and practitioners from academic, business, government, and non-profit organizations. Based on fifty years of tremendous interdisciplinary research from the scientific study of complex systems to interactive approaches in management and community development. This society was initially conceived in 1954 at the Stanford [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]] by [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], [[Kenneth Boulding]], [[Ralph Gerard]], and [[Anatol Rapoport]].

In the field of systems science the [[International Federation for Systems Research]] (IFSR) is an international federation for global and local societies in the field of systems science. This federation is a non-profit, scientific and educational [[non-profit organization|agency]] founded in 1981, and constituted of some thirty member organizations from various countries. The overall purpose of this Federation is to advance [[cybernetic]] and [[systems research]] and systems applications and to serve the international systems community.

The best known research institute in the field is the [[Santa Fe Institute]] (SFI) located in Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States, dedicated to the study of [[complex systems]]. This institute was founded in 1984 by [[George Cowan]], [[David Pines]], [[Stirling Colgate]], [[Murray Gell-Mann]], [[Nick Metropolis]], Herb Anderson, Peter A. Carruthers, and Richard Slansky. All but Pines and Gell-Mann were scientists with [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. SFI's original mission was to disseminate the notion of a separate [[interdisciplinary]] research area, [[complex adaptive system|complexity theory]] referred to at SFI as [[complexity science]]. Recently, [[IIT Jodhpur]] in Rajasthan, India started inculcating system science and engineering to its students through Bachelors, Masters and Doctorate programs. This makes it the first institution to offer [[system science]] education to students in India.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17848">In [[Scientology]], the concept of the '''thetan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|eɪ|t|ən}}) is similar to the concept of [[self]], or the [[spirit]] or [[soul]] as found in several other [[Religion|belief systems]]. The term is derived from the Greek letter Θ, [[theta]], which in [[Scientology beliefs and practices|Scientology beliefs]] represents "the source of life, or life itself."&lt;ref name="DSTD 432"/&gt;  In Scientology it is believed that it is the thetan, not the [[central nervous system]], which commands the body through communication points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/SH6_5.HTM |title=Nerve Assist&amp;nbsp;– Assists for Illnesses and Injuries, How can Scientology help me |publisher=Scientologyhandbook.org |date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thetans have been described in the [[Church of Scientology]] in a number of ways.
* A "thetan is an immortal spiritual being; the human soul."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatisscientology.org/html/part14/chp50/pg1024-a.html#thetan Official Glossary of Scientology &amp; Dianetics Terms] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051112091124/http://www.whatisscientology.org/html/part14/chp50/pg1024-a.html#thetan |date=November 12, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The being who is the individual and who handles and lives in the body."&lt;ref name="DSTD 432"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hubbard|title=Dianetics and Scientology Technical Dictionary|publisher=Bridge Publications|date=June 1975|isbn=0-88404-037-2|page=432}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "A thetan is not a thing, a thetan is the creator of things."&lt;ref name="DSTD 432"/&gt;
* A thetan is "the person himself—not his body or his name, the physical universe, his mind, or anything else; that which is aware of being aware; the identity which is the individual. The thetan is most familiar to one and all as ''you''."&lt;ref name="DSTD 432"/&gt;

According to the [[Church of Scientology]], the concept for the thetan was first discovered in the early 1950s by [[L. Ron Hubbard]], drawing on reports by [[Dianetics]] practitioners of [[Reincarnation|past-life experiences]]. Although the term is comparable to a soul, a thetan can be connected to multiple people over time. An important goal in Scientology is to become one with the thetan as an [[Operating Thetan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schaefer |first1=Richard T. |last2=Zellner |first2=William W. |title=Extraordinary Groups: An Examination of Unconventional Lifestyles |publisher=Macmillan |year=2010 |accessdate=2016-03-07 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iniuCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;pg=PA324#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thetan in Scientology doctrine==
The term and concept were defined by Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]], who adopted the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[theta]] (Θ) to represent "the source of life and life itself".&lt;ref&gt;''Science of Survival'', L. Ron Hubbard pg.3 pub. Publications Organization {{ISBN|0-88404-001-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard first introduced his ideas of "theta-beings" in a lecture series of March 1952.&lt;ref&gt;''Scientology: Milestone One'', L. Ron Hubbard pub. Golden Era Productions. Audio lectures with transcripts&lt;/ref&gt; He attributed the coining of the word to his wife [[Mary Sue Hubbard|Mary Sue]].&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''The Auditor'' 21, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; As an essential point of Scientology doctrine, a person's identity and self-awareness come entirely from a "thetan". It is redundant to refer to "a person's thetan," because the person does not exist independently.&lt;ref&gt;''What is Scientology''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Creed of the Church of Scientology&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard once defined a thetan as: "...&amp;nbsp;having no mass, no wave-length, no energy, no measurable qualities and no time or location in space except by consideration or postulate. The spirit is not a thing. It is the creator of things."&lt;ref name="DSTD 432"/&gt; In a lecture series later published as a book ("The Phoenix Lectures"), he jokingly pointed to a study that implied that a "thetan" manifests a small but measurable amount of mass:

:"From some experiments conducted about fifteen or twenty years ago—a thetan weighed about 1.5&amp;nbsp;ounces {{interp|45&amp;nbsp;grams}}! Who made these experiments? Well, a doctor made these experiments. He weighed people before and after death, retaining any mass. He weighed the person, bed and all, and he found that the weight dropped at the moment of death about 1.5&amp;nbsp;ounces {{interp|45&amp;nbsp;grams}} and some of them 2&amp;nbsp;ounces [60&amp;nbsp;grams]. (Those were super thetans!)"&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''The Phoenix Lectures'', p. 147. Bridge Publications, 1982 {{ISBN|0-88404-006-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hubbard did not name the doctor concerned, there was indeed such an attempt, by [[Duncan MacDougall (doctor)|Duncan MacDougall]], to measure the weight of dying patients to determine the weight of the soul, although MacDougall's [[21 grams experiment|experiments]] took place about fifty years before Hubbard's lectures, not fifteen or twenty, and are generally not regarded as having any scientific validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

According to Hubbard's son [[Ronald DeWolf]] (born L. Ron Hubbard Jr.), his father stated that thetans are immortal and perpetual, having willed themselves into existence at some point several trillion&lt;ref name=bill&gt;Billion in [[Long and short scales|Long Scale]]&lt;/ref&gt; years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.cox.net/batchild1/transcript/pbs1.htm|title=''PBS Late Night'' interview with Ron DeWolf|work=members.cox.net|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060108071658/http://members.cox.net/batchild1/transcript/pbs1.htm|archivedate=2006-01-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Joseph M., ''Is L. Ron Hubbard Dead?'', [[Christianity Today]], 18 February 1983, p 31&lt;/ref&gt; After they originated, thetans generated "points to view" or "dimension points", causing space to come into existence. They agreed that other thetans' dimension points existed, thus bringing into existence the entire universe. All matter, energy, space, and time exists solely because thetans ''agree'' that it exists.

In the primordial past, according to Scientologist teachings, thetans brought the material universe into being largely for their own pleasure.."&lt;ref name=Neusner&gt;{{cite book|last=Neusner|first=Jacob|year=2003|title=World Religions in America|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|pages=221–236|isbn=0-664-22475-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The universe is thought to have no independent reality, but to derive its apparent reality from the fact that most thetans agree it exists.&lt;ref name=Chryssides&gt;{{cite book | last = Chryssides  | first = George D.  | authorlink = George D. Chryssides  | title = Exploring New Religions  | publisher = [[Continuum International Publishing Group]]  | date = 1999  | location =   | page = 283  | url =  | doi =  | isbn = 0-8264-5959-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientologists believe that thetans fell from grace when they began to identify with their creation, rather than their original state of spiritual purity.&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt; Eventually, they lost their memory of their true nature, along with the associated spiritual and creative powers. As a result, thetans came to think of themselves as nothing but embodied beings.&lt;ref name=Chryssides /&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton32"&gt;{{Harvnb|Melton|2000|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thetans are believed to be reborn time and time again in new bodies through a process called "assumption" which is analogous to [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt; Dell deChant and [[Danny Jorgensen]] liken Scientology to [[Hinduism]], in that both ascribe a causal relationship between the experiences of earlier incarnations and one's present life.&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt; With each rebirth, the effects of the "MEST" universe (MEST here stands for matter, energy, space, and time) on the thetan are believed to become stronger.&lt;ref name="Neusner" /&gt; Scientologists believe that the thetan has been “embodied on many occasions,” but they generally avoid the term “reincarnation.” They also reject the idea of transmigration, “i.e. the belief that the thetan would incarnate into any animal less than human.” Scientology’s first phase has to do with removing “encumbrances acquired in this life and in past existences,” J. Gordon Melton writes. These encumbrances are called “engrams,” “described as aberrations attached to the self that produce dysfunctional behavior patterns,” according to Melton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Contemporary Ordered Religious Community: The Sea Org Organization |journal=The Journal of CESNUR |year=2018 |last=Melton |first=J. Gordon |volume=2 |issue=2 |issn=2532-2990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon Atack]], whose book ''[[A Piece of Blue Sky]]'' details how he reached [[Operating Thetan]] level V before leaving Scientology, describes Hubbard's doctrines about thetans:  "Thetans are all-knowing beings, and became bored because there were no surprises. Hubbard asserted that the single most important desire in all beings is to have a '[[game (Scientology)|game]]'. To have a 'game' it was necessary to 'not know' certain things, so certain perceptions were negated ('not-is-ed')."  Since thetans knew everything, this required them to abandon or suppress perceptions and knowledge. Over time, the loss of perception accumulated and certain thetans began to cause harm to others. MEST (physical) beings also sought to "trap" thetans in order to control them. Thetans came to learn contrition, punishing themselves for their own "harmful" acts.&lt;ref name=APoBS&gt;{{cite book | last = Atack | first = Jon | authorlink = Jon Atack | year = 1990 | title = [[A Piece of Blue Sky]] | publisher = Carol Publishing Group | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-8184-0499-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- chapter 9.2 --&gt;

According to Hubbard, an essential part of the thetans' game was the "conquest" of matter, energy, space, and time by the life force, theta. This has produced multiple universes which have ended and begun in succession, each new one being more solid and entrapping than the last. The thetans have by now become so enmeshed in the physical universe that many have identified themselves totally with it, forgetting their quadrillions&lt;ref name=thbill&gt;Thousands of billions in [[Long and short scales|Long Scale]]&lt;/ref&gt; of years of existence and their original godly powers.&lt;ref name=APoBS/&gt;&lt;!-- chapter 9.2 --&gt;

According to Scientology, thetan powers are said to remain potent and restorable. One of the Church of Scientology's stated goals is "the rehabilitation of the human spirit", by which it means the restoration of the thetan's original abilities. Hubbard claims that thetans are able to change reality through "postulates"—decisions made by the individual about the nature of the reality around them. Some thetans are said to have (mis)used this ability to "implant" others with hypnotic suggestions, forcing other thetans to "cluster" around bodies (hence [[body thetan]]s). This sort of directed control is referred to as "other-determinism". Scientology seeks to undo it and return the thetan to "self-determinism", where he can control himself and his environment. The eventual goal is to achieve "pan-determinism", where he acts for the good of all.

The Scientological notion of the thetan differs from other religions, such as Judaism and Christianity, in three significant ways. While other belief systems “fuse the concept of the body and soul”, the thetan is “separate and independent.” Also unlike the Judeo-Christian tradition, Scientologists believe that the thetan has “lived through many, perhaps thousands of lifetimes.” Third, different from the Christian notion of original sin, Scientology believes that the thetan is basically good, but “has lost touch with its true nature.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cowan |first1=Douglas E. |last2=Bromley |first2=David G. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p_xgBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=scientology+religion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjexaC03ObMAhWBbCYKHQDGBoc4ChDoAQg_MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=scientology%20religion&amp;f=false |title=Cults and New Religions: A Brief History, Wiley Blackwell Brief Histories of Religion |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2015 |isbn=9781118722107 |accessdate=2016-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious scholar Richard Holloway writes that thetans were not created, but they created themselves, adopting and creating the human body as a vehicle or existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holloway |first1=Richard |title=A Little History of Religion |publisher=Yale University Press |date=September 20, 2016 |isbn=978-0300208832 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thetans and death==
Non-Scientologists Joel Sappell and Robert Welkos described in a 1990 article in the ''LA Times'' how Scientologists believe that when a person dies—or, in Scientology terms, when a thetan abandons its physical body—they go to a "landing station" on the planet [[Venus]], where the thetan is [[Implant (Scientology)|re-implanted]] and told lies about its past life and its next life. The Venusians take the thetan, "capsule" it, and send it back to Earth to be thrown into the ocean off the coast of California. They quote Hubbard as saying, "If you can get out of that, and through that, and wander around through the cities and find some girl who looks like she is going to get married or have a baby or something like that, you're all set. And if you can find the maternity ward to a hospital or something, you're OK. And you just eventually just pick up a baby."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Joel | last=Sappell |author2=Welkos, Robert W.  | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-scientologysidea062490,1,5476601,full.story?coll=la-news-comment | title=Defining the Theology | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | page=A36:1 | date=1990-06-24 | accessdate=2007-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/la90/la90-1b.html|title=The Scientology Story&amp;nbsp;– Part 1B: Defining the Theology|work=cmu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cempa, Joe; "Petrolia's New Neighbors", ''North Coast Journal'', June 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Hubbard’s discovery of the thetan led to the development of an elaborate cosmology, the doctrinal structure he created is based on the following propositions: “Man is an immortal spiritual being. His experience extends well beyond a single lifetime. His capabilities are unlimited, even if not presently realized.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gallagher |first1=Eugene V. |title=The New Religious Movements Experience in America |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2004 |accessdate=2016-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operating Thetan==
{{Main|Operating Thetan}}

According to Scientology doctrine, a thetan exists whether operating a human body or not. Scientology advertises itself as being able to "rehabilitate" the thetan of a practitioner to a state where the individual can operate with or without a "[[Scientology and sex#MEST and flesh|flesh body]]". The term "operating thetan" would then apply as it does when an individual is operating a body. The Operating Thetan (OT) levels are the upper level courses in Scientology.

The Church defines "Operating Thetan" as "knowing and willing cause over [[life]], [[thought]], and [[matter]], [[energy]], [[space]] and [[time]] ([[MEST (Scientology)|MEST]])."&lt;ref&gt;L. Ron Hubbard's Congress Lectures: Glossary, [http://www.lrh-books.com/mailings/congress/glossary.php#ot "OT"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117035746/http://www.lrh-books.com/mailings/congress/glossary.php#ot |date=2006-01-17 }}, Bridge Publications Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Scientology states as a point of doctrine that an individual exists with or without a body.&lt;ref&gt;Church of Scientology, [http://www.scientology.org/en_US/religion/catechism/pg008.html Scientology Beliefs], accessed 03/28/06&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleared Theta Clear==
Even beyond the Operating Thetan levels comes the "Cleared Theta Clear", a godlike state which Hubbard describes this way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A thetan who is completely rehabilitated and can do everything a thetan should do, such as move MEST and control others from a distance, or create his own universe; a person who is able to create his own universe or, living in the MEST universe is able to create illusions perceivable by others at will, to handle MEST universe objects without mechanical means and to have and feel no need of bodies or even the MEST universe to keep himself and his friends interested in existence".&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''Scientology 8-8008'', pg 114 (1st ed), pg. 151 (1990 ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Body thetan==
{{Main|Body thetan}}

A body thetan is a disincarnate thetan who is "stuck" in, on or near a human body, and all human bodies are said to be infested by these disembodied thetans, or clusters of them. This information is not revealed until a Scientologist reaches Section III of the Operating Thetan levels (commonly referred to as "OT III"). Body thetans were said by Hubbard to be a result of a prehistoric [[Incident (Scientology)|"Incident"]] involving [[Xenu]].

'''Tickle torture''' is the use of [[tickling]] to abuse, dominate, harass, humiliate, or interrogate an individual. While laughter is popularly thought of as a pleasure response, in tickle torture, the one being tickled may laugh despite whether or not they find the experience pleasant. In a tickling situation, laughter can indicate a panic reflex rather than a pleasure response. Tickle torture may be a consensual activity or one that is forced, depending on the circumstances.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/03/science/anatomy-of-a-tickle-is-serious-business-at-the-research-lab.html|publisher=New York Times|title=Anatomy of a Tickle Is Serious Business at the Research Lab|author=Carol Yoon|date=June 3, 1997|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a consensual form, tickle torture may be part of a mutually fulfilling, physically-intimate act between partners. However, forced tickle torture can cause real physical and mental distress in a victim, which is why it has been used as an interrogation method or to simply show dominance over another person.

==In history==
''Chinese tickle torture'' is an ancient form of torture practiced by the Chinese, in particular the courts of the [[Han Dynasty]]. Chinese tickle torture was a punishment for nobility since it left no marks and a victim could recover relatively easily and quickly.&lt;ref name=AZ&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TE2KfBWPAt0C&amp;pg=PA183|page=183|title=A to Z of Punishment and Torture|author=Irene Thompson|isbn=978-1-84624-203-8|publisher=Book Guild Publishing|date=March 2008|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of tickle torture was used in ancient [[Rome]], where a person’s feet were dipped in a salt solution, and a [[goat]] was brought in to lick the solution off. This type of tickle torture would only start as tickling, eventually becoming extremely painful.&lt;ref name=AZ/&gt;

{{Tone|section|date=March 2009}}

[[Josef Kohout]], a man persecuted in the [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]] during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], witnessed [[Nazi]] prison guards perform tickle torture on a fellow inmate, followed by various other tortures which resulted in his death. This incident is described in [[Heinz Heger]]'s book ''The Men With The Pink Triangle'': "The first game that the SS sergeant and his men played was to tickle their victim with goose feathers, on the soles of his feet, between his legs, in the [[armpit]]s, and on other parts of his naked body. At first the prisoner forced himself to keep silent, while his eyes twitched in fear and torment from one SS man to the other. Then he could not restrain himself and finally he broke out in a high-pitched laughter that very soon turned into a cry of pain."&lt;ref&gt;Heger, Heinz. ''The Men With the Pink Triangle''. Boston: Alyson Publications, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in the ''[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'' about European tortures describes a method of tickle torture in which a [[goat]] was compelled to lick the victim's feet because they had been dipped in salt water. Once the goat had licked the salt off, the victim's feet would be dipped in the salt water again and the process would repeat itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yamey | first1 = Gavin | year = 2001 | title = Torture: European Instruments of Torture and Capital Punishment from the Middle Ages to Present | url = | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 323 | issue = 7308| page = 346 | doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7308.346}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Japan]], those in positions of authority could administer punishments to those convicted of crimes that were beyond the criminal code. This was called shikei, which translates as ‘private punishment.’ One such torture was kusuguri-zeme: "merciless tickling."&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Mark.''  The Dark Side: Infamous Japanese Crimes and Criminals''. Japan: Kodansha International, 2001. Page 71&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Sibling Abuse]]'', Vernon Wiehe published his research findings regarding 150 adults who were abused by their siblings during childhood. Several reported tickling as a type of physical abuse they experienced, and based on these reports it was revealed that abusive tickling is capable of provoking extreme physiological reactions in the victim, such as [[vomiting]], incontinence (losing control of bladder), and [[Unconsciousness|losing consciousness]] due to inability to breathe.&lt;ref&gt;Wiehe, Vernon. Sibling Abuse: Hidden Physical, Emotional, and Sexual Trauma. New York: Lexington Books, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a small number of documented instances of tickle torture in the ''[[New York Times]]''. They happened in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and in these instances restrained victims were tickled upon the bare soles of their feet, apparently against their will and for the pleasure of their tormentors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

There is currently no evidence that tickle torture was ever widespread or was practiced by governments. The very small amount of related documentation discovered thus far originates from [[England]] and the [[United States]].

A 1903 article described an immobilized [[Suicide|suicidal]] patient at the [[Hudson River State Hospital]] who was tied to a bed for his own safety. While he lay helpless, the patient's toes were tickled by one of the hospital attendants, Frank A. Sanders. "Sanders is said to have confessed that while intoxicated he amused himself by tickling the feet and ribs of Hayes and pulling his nose." Sanders also gave his restrained victim a black eye. Another hospital employee came upon Sanders while he was entertaining himself at his patient's expense, and the criminal was brought before a grand jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Treated Patient Brutally |work=New York Times |date=September 6, 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1887 article entitled "England in Old Times" states "Gone, too, are the parish stocks, in which offenders against public morality formerly sat imprisoned, with their legs held fast beneath a heavy wooden [[yoke]], while sundry small but fiendish boys improved the occasion by deliberately pulling off their shoes and tickling the soles of their defenseless feet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Ker |title=England in Old Times |work=New York Times |date=November 13, 1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, the beating of a man's bare feet was described in an article entitled "Terrible Punishments: The Russian [[Knout]] and Turkish [[Bastinado]]: How the Punishments are Inflicted". The author, while explaining the intense pain caused by whipping, writes "I have heard men cry out in agony...but I never heard such heart-rending sounds as those from the poor bastinadoed wretch before me. Such is the bastinado. And of the intensiveness of the agony which its infliction produces, one has only to think of the congeries or plexus of delicate nerves which have their terminus in the feet. Even tickling the soles of the feet has often produced death; what then must be the excruciating pain when cruel violence is done to those most sensitive members?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last=L.G.C. |title=Terrible Punishments: The Russian Knout and Turkish [[Bastinado]]: How the Punishments are Inflicted |work=New York Times |date=April 14, 1872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses and meanings==
The term ''tickle torture'' can apply to many different situations that do not include the aforementioned acts of either sexual gratification or malicious torture.

''Tickle torture'' can be an extended act of tickling where the recipient of the tickling would view it as a long time or tickling of an intense nature. This can be due to the length of time they are tickled, the intensity of the tickling or the areas that are being tickled. This can simply be a 30-second tickle applied to the victim's bare feet, which can seem like a much longer time if the victim's feet are very ticklish. While the palm of the [[hand]] is far more sensitive to touch, other commonly ticklish areas include the [[armpits]], sides of the [[torso]], [[neck]], [[knee]], [[midriff]], [[thigh]]s, [[navel]], and the [[ribs]]. Many people consider the [[sole (foot)|sole]]s of their feet the most ticklish, due to the many nerve endings located there: this explains why tickling one's feet against their will is the most common example of "tickle torture".&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harris, Christine R.|title=The mystery of ticklish laughter|journal=American Scientist|year=1999|accessdate=2008-11-09|volume=87|page=344|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/1999/4/the-mystery-of-ticklish-laughter|doi=10.1511/1999.4.344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tickle torture" may also have other uses, including the act of tickling a person as a practical joke, or even an interrogation method. This may not be extreme tickling, but could include prolonged tickling upon a sensitive area until the victim has released the required information. In the former case, it could be used as a way of "pranking" a person, as the act of being tickled can produce many sounds and sensations that could be viewed as being embarrassing to the victim. In this way, the tickling can continue to the point where a certain reaction is revealed.

This method of "pranking" could also incorporate the use of physical restraint or restraint using materials. This would be done to leave a desired area of the body bare and vulnerable to the tickling, in a way that the victim would not be able to remove this area from the tickling, and would have to simply endure. This can also be seen as "punishment" or "payback" as the tickler could be using the tickling as retribution from a previous tickling experience or "prank".

==Consensual==
[[File:Tickling fetish.jpg|thumb|A woman being tickled at [[Exxxotica|EXXXOTICA]] New York 2009]]
{{Main|Tickling fetishism}}
In [[sexual fetishism]], tickle torture is an activity between consenting partners. A torture session usually begins with one partner allowing the other to tie them up in a position that exposes bare parts of the body, particularly those that are sensitive to tickling. Though many parts of the human body are deemed ticklish, tickle torture is commonly associated with the tickling of the bare feet or armpits.

The bondage methods of the tickling usually follows the same basic methods. The object of the bondage is to render the victim unable to remove themselves from the tickling, as well as rendering the ticklish areas of the victim vulnerable. The victim is usually bound in a sitting or lying position rather than a standing one as to expose the soles of the feet which are often among the areas upon which tickling is inflicted. The restraint of the arms above the head leaves the upper body and underarms susceptible to the tickling. This enables the torturer to use whatever they want, e.g. fingers, tongue, beard, feathers, brush, pine cones, salt sticks, electric toothbrush or a vacuum cleaner.

==In fiction==
In [[VeggieTales]]'s ''[[Esther... The Girl Who Became Queen]]'', King Xerxes disposes of criminals by banishing them to the Island of Perpetual Tickling, to which [[Death (personification)|Death]], wielding a scythe-sized feather, escorts them.  Thus, tickle torture serves here as a [[family-friendly]] depiction of capital punishment.

The TV series ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' had a recurring character named Don Turtelli whose main form of torture was to take a feather to the soles of the feet of his captives.

Tickle torture has become the subject of many fetish/sexual publications. These fictional writings can portray a fantasy of a desirable character, often a  celebrity, being restrained and interrogated. These stories are not always sexual, although they are mostly the object of sexual fantasies and dreams. Because of the fantasy element of the plot, the characters are often magical or the circumstances are completely imaginative.

In one of the light novels of the ''[[List of Naruto print media#Naruto_Secret_Chronicles_series|Naruto Secret Chronicle]]'' series, the shinobi Sai uses tickle torture on an ANBU member he was interrogating, as the man had been taught to withstand traditional torture. The action succeeded in them finding the location of their comrade, [[Sakura Haruno]].

In [[mathematics]], a '''Voronoi diagram''' is a [[Partition of a set|partitioning]] of a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] into regions based on distance to points in a specific subset of the plane. That set of points (called seeds, sites, or generators) is specified beforehand, and for each seed there is a corresponding region consisting of all points closer to that seed than to any other. These regions are called Voronoi cells. The Voronoi diagram of a set of points is [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] to its [[Delaunay triangulation]].

It is named after [[Georgy Voronoi]], and is also called a '''Voronoi tessellation''', a '''Voronoi decomposition''', a '''Voronoi partition''', or a '''Dirichlet tessellation''' (after [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]]). Voronoi diagrams have practical and theoretical applications in a large number of fields, mainly in [[science]] and [[technology]], but also in [[visual art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Franz |last=Aurenhammer |authorlink=Franz Aurenhammer |date=1991 |title=Voronoi Diagrams – A Survey of a Fundamental Geometric Data Structure |journal=ACM Computing Surveys |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=345–405 |doi=10.1145/116873.116880}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Atsuyuki |last1=Okabe |first2=Barry |last2=Boots |first3=Kokichi |last3=Sugihara |first4=Sung Nok |last4=Chiu |date=2000 |title=Spatial Tessellations – Concepts and Applications of Voronoi Diagrams |edition=2nd |publisher=John Wiley |isbn=0-471-98635-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The simplest case==
In the simplest case, shown in the first picture, we are given a finite set of points {''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} in the [[Euclidean plane]]. In this case each site ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is simply a point, and its corresponding Voronoi cell ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; consists of every point in the Euclidean plane whose distance to ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is less than or equal to its distance to any other ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. Each such cell is obtained from the intersection of [[Half-space (geometry)|half-spaces]], and hence it is a [[convex polygon]]. The [[line segment]]s of the Voronoi diagram are all the points in the plane that are equidistant to the two nearest sites.  The Voronoi vertices ([[Node (graph theory)|node]]s) are the points equidistant to three (or more) sites.

==Formal definition==
Let &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle X &lt;/math&gt; be a [[metric space]] with distance function &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle d&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle K&lt;/math&gt; be a set of indices and let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (P_k)_{k \in K}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[tuple]] (ordered collection) of nonempty [[subsets]] (the sites) in the space &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X&lt;/math&gt;. The Voronoi cell, or Voronoi region,  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_k&lt;/math&gt;, associated with the site &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_k&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all points in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X&lt;/math&gt; whose distance to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_k&lt;/math&gt; is not greater than their distance to the other sites &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_j&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle j&lt;/math&gt; is any index different from &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle k&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, if &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle d(x,\, A) \;=\; \inf\{d(x,\, a) \mid a \,\in\, A\}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the distance between the point &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x&lt;/math&gt; and the subset &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt; R_k = \{x \in X \mid d(x, P_k) \leq d(x, P_j)\; \text{for all}\; j \neq k\}&lt;/math&gt;

The Voronoi diagram is simply the [[tuple]] of cells &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle (R_k)_{k \in K} &lt;/math&gt;. In principle, some of the sites can intersect and even coincide (an application is described below for sites representing shops), but usually they are assumed to be disjoint. In addition, infinitely many sites are allowed in the definition (this setting has  applications in [[geometry of numbers]] and [[crystallography]]), but again, in many cases only finitely many sites are considered.

In the particular case where the space is a [[finite-dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]], each site is a point, there are finitely many points and all of them are different, then the Voronoi cells are [[convex polytope]]s and they can be represented in a combinatorial way using their vertices, sides, 2-dimensional faces, etc. Sometimes the induced combinatorial structure is referred to as the Voronoi diagram. However, in general the Voronoi cells may not be convex or even connected.

In the usual Euclidean space,  we can rewrite the formal definition in usual terms. Each Voronoi polygon &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_k&lt;/math&gt; is associated with a generator point  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_k&lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all points in the Euclidean space. Let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_1&lt;/math&gt; be a point that generates its Voronoi region  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_2&lt;/math&gt; that generates  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_3&lt;/math&gt; that generates  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_3&lt;/math&gt;, and so on. &lt;!--Then,

:&lt;math&gt; R_1 = \{x \in X \mid d(x, P_1) \leq d(x, P_2) \;\and\; d(x, P_1) \leq d(x, P_3) \;\and\; \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R_2 = \{x \in X \mid d(x, P_2) \leq d(x, P_1) \;\and\; d(x, P_2) \leq d(x, P_3) \;\and\; \ldots\}&lt;/math&gt;
:...
--&gt; Then, as expressed by Tran ''et al''&lt;ref name="Tran09"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Q. T. |last1=Tran |first2=D. |last2=Tainar |first3=M. |last3=Safar |date=2009 |title=Transactions on Large-Scale Data- and Knowledge-Centered Systems |page=357 |isbn=9783642037214}}&lt;/ref&gt; "all locations in the Voronoi polygon are closer to the generator point of that polygon than any other generator point in the Voronoi diagram in Euclidean plane".

==Illustration==
As a simple illustration, consider a group of shops in a city. Suppose we want to estimate the number of customers of a given shop. With all else being equal (price, products, quality of service, etc.), it is reasonable to assume that customers choose their preferred shop simply by distance considerations: they will go to the shop located nearest to them. In this case the Voronoi cell &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_k&lt;/math&gt; of a given shop &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle P_k&lt;/math&gt; can be used for giving a rough estimate on the number of potential customers going to this shop (which is modeled by a point in our city).

For most cities, the distance between points can be measured using the familiar
[[Euclidean distance]]: &lt;math&gt;\ell_2 = d\left[\left(a_1, a_2\right), \left(b_1, b_2\right)\right] = \sqrt{\left(a_1 - b_1\right)^2 + \left(a_2 - b_2\right)^2}&lt;/math&gt; or the [[Manhattan distance]]:&lt;math&gt;d\left[\left(a_1, a_2\right), \left(b_1, b_2\right)\right] = \left|a_1 - b_1\right| + \left|a_2 - b_2\right|&lt;/math&gt;. The corresponding Voronoi diagrams look different for different distance metrics.

==Properties==
* The [[dual graph]] for a Voronoi diagram (in the case of a [[Euclidean space]] with point sites) corresponds to the [[Delaunay triangulation]] for the same set of points.
* The [[closest pair of points]] corresponds to two adjacent cells in the Voronoi diagram.
* Assume the setting is the [[Euclidean plane]] and a group of different points are given. Then two points are adjacent on the [[convex hull]] if and only if their Voronoi cells share an infinitely long side.
* If the space is a [[normed space]] and the distance to each site is attained (e.g., when a site is a [[compact set]] or a closed ball), then each Voronoi cell can be represented as a union of line segments emanating from the sites.&lt;ref name=Reem_alg&gt;{{cite journal |first=Daniel |last=Reem |title=An algorithm for computing Voronoi diagrams of general generators in general normed spaces |doi=10.1109/ISVD.2009.23 |journal=Proceedings of the sixth International Symposium on Voronoi Diagrams in science and engineering (ISVD 2009) |date=2009 |pages=144–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown there, this property does not necessarily hold when the distance is not attained.
* Under relatively general conditions (the space is a possibly infinite-dimensional [[uniformly convex space]], there can be infinitely many sites of a general form, etc.) Voronoi cells enjoy a certain stability property: a small change in the shapes of the sites, e.g., a change caused by some translation or distortion, yields a small change in the shape of the Voronoi cells. This is the geometric stability of Voronoi diagrams.&lt;ref name=Reem_geo_stable&gt;{{cite journal |first=Daniel |last=Reem |title=The geometric stability of  Voronoi diagrams with respect to small changes of the sites |arxiv=1103.4125 |date=2011 |doi=10.1145/1998196.1998234 |journal=Proceedings of the 27th Annual ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG) |pages=254–263}}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown there, this property does not hold in general, even if the space is two-dimensional (but non-uniformly convex, and, in particular, non-Euclidean) and the sites are points.

==History and research==
Informal use of Voronoi diagrams can be traced back to [[Descartes]] in 1644. [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] used 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional Voronoi diagrams in his study of quadratic forms in 1850.
British physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] used a Voronoi diagram in 1854 to illustrate how the majority of people who died in the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|Broad Street cholera outbreak]] lived closer to the infected [[Soho#Broad Street pump|Broad Street pump]] than to any other water pump.

Voronoi diagrams are named after Russian mathematician [[Georgy Voronoy|Georgy Fedosievych Voronoy]] who defined and studied the general ''n''-dimensional case in 1908. Voronoi diagrams that are used in [[geophysics]] and [[meteorology]] to analyse spatially distributed data (such as rainfall measurements) are called Thiessen polygons after American meteorologist [[Alfred H. Thiessen]]. In [[condensed matter physics]], such tessellations are also known as [[Wigner–Seitz unit cell]]s. Voronoi tessellations of the [[reciprocal lattice]] of [[momentum|momenta]] are called [[Brillouin zone]]s. For general lattices in [[Lie group]]s,  the cells are simply called [[fundamental domain]]s. In the case of general [[metric space]]s, the cells are often called metric [[fundamental polygon]]s.
Other equivalent names for this concept (or particular important cases of it): Voronoi polyhedra, Voronoi polygons, domain(s) of influence, Voronoi decomposition, Voronoi tessellation(s), Dirichlet tessellation(s).

==Examples==
[[Image:Coloured Voronoi 3D slice.svg|right|thumb|This is a slice of the Voronoi diagram of a random set of points in a 3D box. In general a cross section of a 3D Voronoi tessellation is not a 2D Voronoi tessellation itself. (The cells are all [[Convex set|convex]] [[polyhedron|polyhedra]].)]]

Voronoi tessellations of regular [[Lattice (group)|lattice]]s of points in two or three dimensions give rise to many familiar tessellations.
* A 2D lattice gives an irregular honeycomb tessellation, with equal hexagons with point symmetry; in the case of a regular triangular lattice it is regular; in the case of a rectangular lattice the hexagons reduce to rectangles in rows and columns; a [[Square (geometry)|square]] lattice gives the regular tessellation of squares; note that the rectangles and the squares can also be generated by other lattices (for example the lattice defined by the vectors (1,0) and (1/2,1/2) gives squares). See [https://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/voronoi.html here] for a dynamic visual example.
* A [[simple cubic lattice]] gives the [[cubic honeycomb]].
* A [[hexagonal close-packed]] lattice gives a tessellation of space with [[trapezo-rhombic dodecahedron|trapezo-rhombic dodecahedra]].
* A [[face-centred cubic]] lattice gives a tessellation of space with [[rhombic dodecahedron|rhombic dodecahedra]].
* A [[body-centred cubic]] lattice gives a tessellation of space with [[truncated octahedron|truncated octahedra]].
* Parallel planes with regular triangular lattices aligned with each other's centers give the [[hexagonal prismatic honeycomb]].
* Certain body centered tetragonal lattices give a tessellation of space with [[rhombo-hexagonal dodecahedron|rhombo-hexagonal dodecahedra]].

For the set of points (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') with ''x'' in a discrete set ''X'' and ''y'' in a discrete set ''Y'', we get rectangular tiles with the points not necessarily at their centers.

==Higher-order Voronoi diagrams==
Although a normal Voronoi cell is defined as the set of points closest to a single point in ''S'', an ''n''th-order Voronoi cell is defined as the set of points having a particular set of ''n'' points in ''S'' as its ''n'' nearest neighbors.  Higher-order Voronoi diagrams also subdivide space.

Higher-order Voronoi diagrams can be generated recursively.  To generate the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-order Voronoi diagram from set&amp;nbsp;''S'', start with the (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-order diagram and replace each cell generated by ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;} with a Voronoi diagram generated on the set&amp;nbsp;''S''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''X''.

===Farthest-point Voronoi diagram===
For a set of ''n'' points the (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-order Voronoi diagram is called a farthest-point Voronoi diagram.

For a given set of points ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} the farthest-point Voronoi diagram divides the plane into cells in which the same point of ''P'' is the farthest point. A point of ''P'' has a cell in the farthest-point Voronoi diagram if and only if it is a vertex of the [[convex hull]] of ''P''. Let ''H''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''h''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;} be the convex hull of ''P''; then the farthest-point Voronoi diagram is a subdivision of the plane into ''k'' cells, one for each point in ''H'', with the property that a point ''q'' lies in the cell corresponding to a site ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if d(''q'', ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) &gt; d(''q'', ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) for each ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''S'' with ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, where d(''p'', ''q'') is the [[Euclidean distance]] between two points ''p'' and&amp;nbsp;''q''.&lt;ref name="berg2008"&gt;{{cite book|year=2008|title=Computational Geometry |isbn=978-3-540-77974-2 |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]]|edition=Third |first1=Mark |last1=de Berg |first2=Marc |last2=van Kreveld |first3=Mark |last3=Overmars |first4=Otfried |last4=Schwarzkopf |authorlink1=Mark de Berg |authorlink2=Marc van Kreveld |authorlink3=Mark Overmars |authorlink4=Otfried Schwarzkopf }} 7.4 Farthest-Point Voronoi Diagrams.

The boundaries of the cells in the farthest-point Voronoi diagram have the structure of a [[Real tree|topological tree]], with infinite [[Ray (mathematics)|rays]] as its leaves. Every finite tree is isomorphic to the tree formed in this way from a farthest-point Voronoi diagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

==Generalizations and variations==
As implied by the definition, Voronoi cells can be defined for metrics other than Euclidean, such as the [[Mahalanobis distance]] or [[Manhattan distance]]. However, in these cases the boundaries of the Voronoi cells may be more complicated than in the Euclidean case, since the equidistant locus for two points may fail to be subspace of codimension 1, even in the 2-dimensional case.

[[Image:Approximate Voronoi Diagram.svg|thumb|Approximate Voronoi diagram of a set of points. Notice the blended colors in the fuzzy boundary of the Voronoi cells.]]
A [[weighted Voronoi diagram]] is the one in which the function of a pair of points to define a Voronoi cell is a distance function modified by multiplicative or additive weights assigned to generator points. In contrast to the case of Voronoi cells defined using a distance which is a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], in this case some of the Voronoi cells  may be empty. A [[power diagram]] is a type of Voronoi diagram defined from a set of circles using the [[Power of a point|power distance]]; it can also be thought of as a weighted Voronoi diagram in which a weight defined from the radius of each circle is added to the [[quadrance|squared distance]] from the circle's center.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Edelsbrunner|first=Herbert|author-link=Herbert Edelsbrunner|contribution=13.6 Power Diagrams|pages=327–328|publisher=Springer-Verlag|series=EATCS Monographs on Theoretical Computer Science|title=Algorithms in Combinatorial Geometry|volume=10|year=1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Voronoi diagram of ''n'' points in ''d''-dimensional space requires &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle O\left(n^{\left\lceil \frac{1}{2}d \right\rceil}\right)&lt;/math&gt; storage space.{{clarify | reason = 'Storage space' for what, exactly?|date=November 2016}} Therefore, Voronoi diagrams are often not feasible for ''d''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2.{{clarify | reason = It seems implausible that a modern computer could not easily work with, say, a 3D diagram for reasonable ''n''|date=November 2016}} An alternative is to use [[approximate Voronoi diagram]]s, where the Voronoi cells have a fuzzy boundary, which can be approximated.&lt;ref&gt;S. Arya, T. Malamatos, and [[David Mount|D. M. Mount]],

Voronoi diagrams are also related to other geometric structures such as the [[medial axis]] (which has found applications in image segmentation, [[optical character recognition]], and other computational applications), [[straight skeleton]], and [[zone diagram]]s. Besides points, such diagrams use lines and polygons as seeds. By augmenting the diagram with line segments that connect to nearest points on the seeds, a planar subdivision of the environment is obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Geraerts|first=Roland|pages=1997–2004|publisher=IEEE|series=International Conference on Robotics and Automation|title=Planning Short Paths with Clearance using Explicit Corridors|year=2010|url=http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gerae101/pdf/ecm.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This structure can be used as a [[navigation mesh]] for path-finding through large spaces. The navigation mesh has been generalized to support 3D multi-layered environments, such as an airport or a multi-storey building.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=van Toll|first1=Wouter G.|last2=Cook IV|first2=Atlas F.|last3=Geraerts|first3=Roland|pages=3526–3532|publisher=IEEE/RSJ|series=International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems|title=Navigation Meshes for Realistic Multi-Layered Environments|year=2011|url=http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gerae101/pdf/navmesh.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

*In [[ecology]], Voronoi diagrams are used to study the growth patterns of forests and forest canopies, and may also be helpful in developing predictive models for forest fires.
*In [[computational chemistry]], Voronoi cells defined by the positions of the nuclei in a molecule are used to compute [[partial charge|atomic charge]]s. This is done using the [[Voronoi deformation density]] method.
*In [[astrophysics]], Voronoi diagrams are used to generate adaptative smoothing zones on images, adding signal fluxes on each one. The main objective for these procedures is to maintain a relatively constant [[signal-to-noise ratio]] on all the image.
*In [[computational fluid dynamics]], the Voronoi tessellation of a set of points can be used to define the computational domains used in [[finite volume]] methods, e.g. as in the moving-mesh cosmology code AREPO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=E pur si muove: Galilean-invariant cosmological hydrodynamical simulations on a moving mesh|last=Springel|first=Volker|year=2010|journal=MNRAS|volume=401|issue=2|pages=791–851|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15715.x|bibcode=2010MNRAS.401..791S|arxiv=0901.4107}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[computational physics]], Voronoi diagrams are used to calculate profiles of an object with [[Shadowgraph]] and proton radiography in [[High energy density physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kasim|first=Muhammad Firmansyah|date=2017-01-01|title=Quantitative shadowgraphy and proton radiography for large intensity modulations|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevE.95.023306|journal=Physical Review E|volume=95|issue=2|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.95.023306|arxiv=1607.04179|bibcode=2017PhRvE..95b3306K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health ===
*In [[medical diagnosis]], models of muscle tissue, based on Voronoi diagrams, can be used to detect neuromuscular diseases.&lt;ref name="Sanchez-Gutierrez 77–88"/&gt; [[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|John Snow's original diagram]]
*In [[epidemiology]], Voronoi diagrams can be used to correlate sources of infections in epidemics. One of the early applications of Voronoi diagrams was implemented by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] to study the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]] in Soho, England. He showed the correlation between residential areas on the map of Central London whose residents had been using a specific water pump, and the areas with most deaths due to the outbreak.&lt;ref name="Johnson2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Johnson|title=The Ghost Map: The Story of London's Most Terrifying Epidemic — and How It Changed Science, Cities, and the Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8R3NrzE8veEC&amp;pg=PT187|date=19 October 2006|accessdate=16 October 2017|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-101-15853-1|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engineering ===
*In [[polymer physics]], Voronoi diagrams can be used to represent free volumes of polymers.
*In [[materials science]], polycrystalline microstructures in metallic alloys are commonly represented using Voronoi tessellations. In solid state physics, the [[Wigner-Seitz cell]] is the Voronoi tessellation of a solid, and the [[Brillouin zone]] is the Voronoi tessellation of reciprocal (wave number) space of crystals which have the symmetry of a space group.
*In [[aviation]], Voronoi diagrams are superimposed on oceanic plotting charts to identify the nearest airfield for in-flight diversion (see [[ETOPS]]), as an aircraft progresses through its flight plan.
*In [[architecture]], Voronoi patterns were the basis for the winning entry for redevelopment of [[The Arts Centre Gold Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GOLD COAST CULTURAL PRECINCT|url=http://www.a-r-m.com.au/projects_GoldCoastCP.html|publisher=ARM Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[mining]], Voronoi polygons are used to estimate the reserves of valuable materials, minerals, or other resources. Exploratory drillholes are used as the set of points in the Voronoi polygons.

=== Geometry ===
*A [[point location]] data structure can be built on top of the Voronoi diagram in order to answer [[nearest neighbor search|nearest neighbor]] queries, where one wants to find the object that is closest to a given query point. Nearest neighbor queries have numerous applications. For example, one might want to find the nearest hospital, or the most similar object in a [[database]]. A large application is [[vector quantization]], commonly used in [[data compression]]. 
*In [[geometry]], Voronoi diagrams can be used to find the [[Largest empty sphere|largest empty circle]] amid a set of points, and in an enclosing polygon; e.g. to build a new supermarket as far as possible from all the existing ones, lying in a certain city.
*Voronoi diagrams together with farthest-point Voronoi diagrams are used for efficient algorithms to compute the [[Roundness (object)|roundness]] of a set of points.&lt;ref name="berg2008" /&gt; The Voronoi approach is also put to good use in the evaluation of circularity/[[roundness (object)|roundness]] while assessing the dataset from a [[coordinate-measuring machine]].
*Modern [[computational geometry]] has provided efficient algorithms for constructing Voronoi diagrams, and has allowed them to be used in [[mesh generation]], [[point location]], [[cluster analysis]], machining plans and many other computational tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=987|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Informatics ===
*In [[Computer network|networking]], Voronoi diagrams can be used in derivations of the capacity of a [[wireless network]].
*In [[computer graphics]], Voronoi diagrams are used to calculate 3D shattering / fracturing geometry patterns.  It is also used to procedurally generate organic or lava-looking textures.
* In autonomous [[robot navigation]], Voronoi diagrams are used to find clear routes. If the points are obstacles, then the edges of the graph will be the routes furthest from obstacles (and theoretically any collisions).
*In [[machine learning]], Voronoi diagrams are used to do [[k-nearest neighbor algorithm|1-NN]] classifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Machine Learning |first=Tom M. |last=Mitchell |year=1997 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |edition=International |isbn=0-07-042807-7|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[user interface]] development, Voronoi patterns can be used to compute the best hover state for a given point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=User Interface Algorithms|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90NsjKvz9Ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civics and planning ===
* In Victoria, Australia, government schools typically admit eligible students to the nearest primary school or high school to where they live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.education.vic.gov.au/school/parents/primary/Pages/boundary.aspx|title=Restrictions and boundaries|website=www.education.vic.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students and parents can see which school "catchment zone" they live in by using [http://melbourneschoolzones.com/ this Voronoi representation].

==Algorithms==
Direct algorithms:
*[[Fortune's algorithm]], an [[big O notation|O]](''n'' log(''n'')) algorithm for generating a Voronoi diagram from a set of points in a plane.
*[[Lloyd's algorithm]] and its generalization via the [[Linde–Buzo–Gray algorithm]] (aka [[k-means clustering]]), produces a Voronoi tessellation in a space of arbitrary dimensions.

Starting with a [[Delaunay triangulation]] (obtain the dual):
*[[Bowyer–Watson algorithm]], an [[big O notation|O]](''n'' log(''n'')) to [[big O notation|O]](''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) algorithm for generating a Delaunay triangulation in any number of dimensions, from which the Voronoi diagram can be obtained.
