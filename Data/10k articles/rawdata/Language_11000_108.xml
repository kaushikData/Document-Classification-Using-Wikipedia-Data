He died in Delhi, in 1642 (1052 [[Hijri year|AH]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://persian.packhum.org/persian/bio?anum=0004 ʿAbd al-Ḥaqq "Ḥaqqī" Dihlavī Buḫārī d. 1052/1642 Profile] [[Packard Humanities Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; and has over 40 works to his name.&lt;ref name=bo&gt;{{cite web |author= |authorlink= |title= Perfection of Faith |url= https://www.darul-ishaat.co.uk/store/Perfection-of-Faith.html|date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syntax==
As in most other Cushitic languages, the basic word order in Afar is [[subject–object–verb]].&lt;ref name="Ethnaar"/&gt;

==Writing system==
[[File:ISO 639 Icon aa.svg|thumb|ISO 639 icon for the Afar language]]
In Ethiopia, Afar is written with the [[Ge'ez script]] (Ethiopic script). Since around 1849, the [[Latin script]] has been used in other areas to transcribe the language.&lt;ref name="Ethnaar"/&gt; Additionally, Afar is also transcribed using the Arabic script.&lt;ref name="Afdal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Development of the Afar Language |url=http://www.afarfriends.org/Dok%20t%20websida/aktivitet_i_Sv/STANDARDIZATION%20OF%20COMMON%20AFAR%20SCRIPT1.pdf |publisher=Afar Friends |accessdate=23 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305143610/http://www.afarfriends.org/Dok%20t%20websida/aktivitet_i_Sv/STANDARDIZATION%20OF%20COMMON%20AFAR%20SCRIPT1.pdf |archivedate=5 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, two Afar intellectuals and nationalists, Dimis and Redo, formalized the Afar alphabet. Known as ''Qafar Feera'', the orthography is based on the Latin script.&lt;ref name="Omafr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Afar (ʿAfár af)|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/afar.htm|publisher=Omniglot|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials from the Institut des Langues de Djibouti, the Eritrean Ministry of Education, and the Ethiopian Afar Language Studies and Enrichment Center have since worked with Afar linguists, authors and community representatives to select a standard orthography for Afar from among the various existing writing systems used to transcribe the language.&lt;ref name="Afdal"/&gt;

An overview of the archaeological discoveries made in [[Knossos]], [[Crete]], from the beginning of the 20th century, especially by the British archaeologist [[Arthur Evans]], a wealthy Englishman, who found the legendary palace of [[Minos|King Minos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bibliomonde.com/livre/cnossos-archeologie-un-reve-2337.html |title=''Cnossos : l'archéologie d'un rêve'' par Alexandre Farnoux |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=1993 |website=bibliomonde.com |language=fr |access-date=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a plethora of [[bric-à-brac]]—frescoes, ceramics, clay tablets covered with unknown writings—Evans recreated an immense civilisation, totally original. A peaceful world which flourished some forty centuries ago, long before [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenae]], radiated throughout the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].

Alexandre Farnoux retraces step by step the rigorous and inspired work of Arthur Evans—the excavations, interpretations, restorations, which will remain, with regard to History, the magician of Knossos—in this [[Pocket edition|pocket-sized]] volume entitled {{lang|fr|Cnossos : L'archéologie d'un rêve}} (lit. "Knossos: The Archaeology of a Dream"; UK edition – ''Knossos: Unearthing a Legend''; US edition – ''Knossos: Searching for the Legendary Palace of King Minos''), published by [[Éditions Gallimard]]. It was released in 1993 in the {{lang|fr|Archéologie}} series of Gallimard's {{lang|fr|[[Découvertes Gallimard|Découvertes]]}} [[Collection (publishing)|collection]]. According to standards of the collection, the book is profusely illustrated with colour plates—Minoan frescoes, maps, drawings, paintings, photographs of artefacts and excavations, etc.—and printed on glossy paper.

The book opens with a "[[pre-credit]]", which is a series of full-page illustrations showing some drawings and photographs of the palace of Knossos. The first chapter "{{lang|la|Terra Incognita|italic=no}}" presents [[Crete]], the Greek island as an [[Terra incognita|unknown land]] at the end of 19th century when Knossos was approached by Evans. The second chapter "Impatience" tells the works of archaeologists. "In the Land of the Griffin" (chap. Ⅲ) recounts the excavations at Knossos. "The Magician of Knossos" (chap. Ⅳ) traces the rebirth of the palace of Knossos thanks to the dream of the English archaeologist. The last chapter "Minoan Art Nouveau" is about the exoticism and the surprising familiarity of the Cretan discoveries, which together presented a sort of ideal image of a modern-day antiquity: {{Quote|text=The [[Prince of the Lilies|royalty of the fleur-de-lys]], the virgin mother, [[Britomartis|Our Lady of the Mountain]] or of the Waves, the plastic symbols, the number three or the cross, the '[[La Parisienne (fresco)|Parisienne]]' of Knossos, the [[Akrotiri Boxer Fresco|boxers]], and [[Bull-Leaping Fresco|toreadors]] bring very close to us a life separated from our own by thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Farnoux |first=Alexandre |translator-last=Baker |translator-first=David J. |date=1996 |chapter=Chapter Ⅴ: Minoan Art Nouveau |title=Knossos: Unearthing a Legend |series=‘New Horizons’ series |url= |location=London |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |pages=95 |isbn=9780500300695}}&lt;/ref&gt;|author=[[Henri Berr]]|source=preface to [[Gustave Glotz]]'s ''The Aegean Civilisation'' (1925)}}

In its second part—the "Documents" section—the book provides a compilation of excerpts divided into eight parts: 1, In the Labyrinth; 2, The return of the Minotaur; 3, The past informs the present; 4, Archaeology and imagination; 5, The Minoan world today; 6, The Minoans in the headlines; 7, Forgers in the realm of Minos; 8, Cretan writing. The book closes with a list of further reading, chronology, list of illustrations, an index and a full-page photograph of Arthur Evans at Knossos. It has been translated into American and British English, Italian and Korean.

'''Arnobius of Sicca''' (died c. 330) was an [[Early Christian]] [[apologetics|apologist]] of Berber origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cvB576o4Tl4C|title=L'apport de l'Afrique à la pensée humaine|last=Guernier|first=Eugène|date=1952-01-01|publisher=Payot|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=181|language=fr|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NtoWzDEcmEIC|title=Le Berbère-- lumière de l'Occident|last=Serralda|first=Vincent|last2=Huard|first2=André|date=1984|publisher=Nouvelles Editions Latines|year=|isbn=9782723302395|location=|pages=|language=fr|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2JkJAQAAIAAJ|title=Histoire de la Tunisie: depuis les origines jusqu'a nos jours|last=Pellegrin|first=Arthur|date=1944-01-01|publisher=La Rapide|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=69|language=fr|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the reign of [[Diocletian]] (284–305).&lt;ref&gt;To distinguish him from a later Arnobius, of the fifth century, he is sometimes called '''Arnobius the Elder'''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jerome]]'s ''Chronicle,'' Arnobius, before his conversion, was a distinguished [[Numidia]]n rhetorician at [[Sicca Veneria]] (El Kef, Tunisia), a major Christian center in Proconsular [[Africa (province)|Africa]], and owed his conversion to a premonitory dream.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Arnobius writes dismissively of dreams in his surviving book, so perhaps Jerome was projecting his own respect for the content of dreams. According to Jerome, to overcome the doubts of the local [[bishop]] as to the earnestness of his Christian belief he wrote (c. 303, from evidence in IV:36) an apologetic work in seven books that St. Jerome calls&lt;ref&gt;''[[De Viris Illustribus (Jerome)|De Viris Illustribus]]'', lxxix.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Adversus Gentes'' but which is entitled ''Adversus Nationes'' in the only (9th-century) manuscript that has survived. Jerome's reference, his remark that [[Lactantius]] was a pupil of Arnobius&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, ''Epistle'' 70.5. Arnobius' and Lactantius' readings of the classical pagan authors are compared in G. L. Ellspermann, ''The Attitude of the Early Christian Writers to Pagan Literature and Learning'' (Washington) 1949:56-50, 72-77.&lt;/ref&gt; and the surviving treatise are all that we know about Arnobius.

==''Adversus nationes''==
''Against the Pagans'' was composed in response to [[Diocletian]]'s persecution of Christians, and was a rebuttal to Pagan arguments as to why the persecution was justifiable.&lt;ref name="YoungEdwards2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=F. Young|author2=M. Edwards|author3=Paul M.

Oliver, reviewing George E. McCracken (tr.), ''Arnobius of Sicca: The Case Against the Pagans'' (Westminster, Maryland: newman Press) 1949, in ''The Classical Journal'' '''46'''.4 (January 1951:201).&lt;/ref&gt; is a vigorous apologist for the Christian faith, more earnest in his defence of Christianity than perfectly [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] in his tenets. His book has been occasioned by complaints that the Christians had brought the wrath of the gods on [[Ancient Rome]]. Thus, he holds the heathen gods to be real beings, but subordinate to the supreme Christian [[God]]; in a streak of [[gnosticism]], he affirms that the human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Book II, 14 - 62) is not the work of God, but of an intermediate being, and is not immortal by nature, but capable of putting on immortality as a [[divine grace|grace]]. He even says that a belief in the soul’s immortality would tend to remove moral restraint, and have a prejudicial effect on human life.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Arnobius (writer)|display=Arnobius|volume=2|page=632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Never specifically identifying his pagan adversaries, some of whom may be [[straw men]], set up to be demolished,&lt;ref&gt;"Arnobius Adversus Genera: 'Arnobius on the Genders'" ''The Classical Journal'' '''42'''.8 (May 1947:474-476) p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt; Arnobius defends and expounds the rightness of [[monotheism]] and [[Christianity]] (''deus princeps, deus summus'') and the divinity of Christ, by adducing its rapid diffusion, its influence in civilizing [[barbarians]] and its consonance with the best [[philosophy]]. Christianizing [[Plato]], he refutes [[Paganism|pagan]] [[idolatry]] as filled with contradictions and openly immoral, and to demonstrate this point, his Books III through V abound with curious information gathered from reliable sources (e.g. [[Cornelius Labeo]]) concerning the forms of idolatrous worship, [[temple]]s, [[cult image|idols]], and the [[Graeco-Roman]] [[cult]] practice of his time, to the historian and mythographer's cautious delight, but all held up by Arnobius for Christian ridicule.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Books VI and VII handle the questions of sacrifices and worship of images.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In book 2 section 4 of ''Adversus nationes'', Arnobius gives the first known version of the argument later called [[Pascal's Wager]],&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin, ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal'', Baltimore 2001, pp. 249-50.&lt;/ref&gt; that in case of doubt about religion one should commit to it because of the rewards of doing so and risks of  not doing so. He argues:

{{quote|Since, then, the nature of the future is such that it cannot be grasped and comprehended by any anticipation, is it not more rational, of two things uncertain and hanging in doubtful suspense, rather to believe that which carries with it some hopes, than that which brings none at all? For in the one case there is no danger, if that which is said to be at hand should prove vain and groundless; in the other there is the greatest loss, even the loss of salvation, if, when the time has come, it be shown that there was nothing false in what was declared.}}

The work of Arnobius appears to have been written when he was a recent convert, for he does not possess a very extensive knowledge of Scripture. He knows nothing of the [[Old Testament]], and only the life of Christ in the [[New Testament|New]], while he does not quote directly from the [[Gospel]]s. He was much influenced by [[Lucretius]] and had read [[Plato]]. His statements concerning Greek and Roman mythology are based respectively on the ''[[Protrepticus (Clement)|Protrepticus]]'' of [[Clement of Alexandria]], and on [[Cornelius Labeo]], who belonged to the preceding generation and attempted to restore [[Neoplatonism]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

''Adversus nationes'' survived in a single ninth-century manuscript in Paris (and a bad copy of it in Brussels).&lt;ref&gt;Codex Parisinus, lat. 1661. Concetto Marchesi, ''Arnobii adversus nationes libri vii'' (Corpus Scriptorum Latinorum Paravianum) Turin, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; The French manuscript also contains the ''[[Octavius]]'' of [[Marcus Minucius Felix]].&lt;ref&gt;Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: "Modern translations of the Octavius come from a 9th century manuscript in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris which contains the seven books of Arnobius’ (284-305) Adversus Nationes along with an 8th book—the Octavius."--http://www.iep.utm.edu/minucius/&lt;/ref&gt;

In viticulture, the climates of wine regions are categorised based on the overall characteristics of the area's climate during the [[growing season (vine)|growing season]].&lt;ref name=Fraga2016/&gt; While variations in [[macroclimate]] are acknowledged, the climates of most [[wine regions]] are categorised (somewhat loosely based on the [[Köppen climate classification]]) as being part of a [[Mediterranean (climate)|Mediterranean]] (for example [[Tuscany wine|Tuscany]]&lt;ref&gt;S. Siddons ''"[http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/food-facts/wine/tuscany-wine-region2.htm How the Tuscany Wine Region Works]"'' TLC Cooking, Accessed: Jan 18th, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Actually Central-Northern Tuscany has a Submediterranean climate (between  ''Csa'' and ''Cfa'', e.g. [[Florence#Climate|Florence]]), while coastal and southern zones belong to Mediterranean proper (''Csa'') climate.}}), [[maritime (climate)|maritime]] (ex: [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]]&lt;ref&gt;M. Ewing-Mulligan ''"[http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/frances-bordeaux-wine-region.html France's Bordeaux Wine Region]"'' Dummies.com Reference page. Accessed: Jan 18th, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;) or [[continental climate]] (ex: [[Columbia Valley AVA|Columbia Valley]]&lt;ref&gt;A. Mumma ''"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3488/is_11_86/ai_n15932784/ The Washington wine difference: it's in the vineyard]"'' Wines &amp; Vines, November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;). The majority of the world's premium wine production takes place in one of these three climate categories in locations between the [[30th parallel (disambiguation)|30th parallel]] and [[50th parallel (disambiguation)|50th parallel]] in both the [[northern (Hemisphere)|northern]] and [[southern hemisphere]].&lt;ref name="Sotheby pg 14-15"&gt;T. Stevenson ''"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia"'' pg 14-15 Dorling Kindersley 2005 {{ISBN|0-7566-1324-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[viticulture]] does exist in some [[tropical climate]]s, most notably [[Brazil]], the amount of quality wine production in those areas is so small that the climate effect has not been as extensively studied as other categories.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 179-195, et al"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 179-195, 388, 428-434, 716-714 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of climate on viticulture==
[[File:Lake Geneva Lavaux.jpg|left|thumb|Large bodies of water, such as [[Lake Geneva]] in Switzerland, can have a moderating effect on the climate of a region.]]
Beyond establishing whether or not viticulture can even be sustained in an area, the climatic influences of a particular area goes a long way in influencing the type of [[grape varieties]] grown in a region and the type of viticultural practices that will be used.&lt;ref name=Fraga2015/&gt; The presence of adequate sun, heat and water are all vital to the healthy growth and development of grapevines during the growing season. Additionally, continuing research has shed more light on the influence of [[dormancy]] that occurs after [[harvest (wine)|harvest]] when the grapevine essentially shuts down and reserves its energy for the beginning of the next year's growing cycle.

In general, grapevines thrive in [[temperate climates]] which grant the vines long, warm periods during the crucial [[flowering (vine)|flowering]], [[fruit set]] and [[ripening periods (wine)|ripening periods]].&lt;ref name="Johnson atlas pg 20-21"&gt;H. Johnson &amp; J. Robinson ''The World Atlas of Wine'' pg 20-21 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 {{ISBN|1-84000-332-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physiological processes of a lot of grapevines begin when temperatures reach around {{convert|50|F|C|order=flip}}. Below this temperature, the vines are usually in a period of dormancy. Drastically below this temperature, such as the [[freezing point]] of {{convert|32|F|C|order=flip}} the vines can be damaged by [[frost]]. When the average daily temperature is between {{convert|63|and|68|F|C|order=flip}} the vine will begin flowering. When temperatures rise up to {{convert|80|F|C|order=flip}} many of the vine's physiological processes are in full stride as grape clusters begin to ripen on the vine. One of the characteristics that differentiates the various climate categories from one another is the occurrence and length of time that these optimal temperatures appear during the growing season.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 12-21"&gt;K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 12-21 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to temperature, the amount of rainfall (and the need for supplemental [[irrigation (vine)|irrigation]]) is another defining characteristics. On average, a grapevine needs around {{convert|28|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} of water for sustenance during the growing season, not all of which may be provided by natural rain fall. In Mediterranean and many continental climates, the climate during the growing season may be quite dry and require additional irrigation. In contrast, maritime climates often suffer the opposite extreme of having too much rainfall during the growing season which poses its own viticultural hazards.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 12-21"/&gt;

Other climate factors such as [[wind]], [[humidity]], [[atmospheric pressure]], sunlight as well as [[diurnal temperature variations]] which can define different climate categories, can also have pronounced influences on the viticulture of an area.&lt;ref name="Johnson atlas pg 20-21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 12-21"/&gt;

==Mediterranean climates==
[[File:Wine regions with Mediterranean climates.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Wine regions with Mediterranean climates.]]
[[File:California_wine_region_map_en.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Most [[California wine]] regions have a Mediterranean climate.]]

[[File:Stellenbosch-region.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Stellenbosch]] wines from [[South Africa]] are from grapes grown in a Mediterranean climate.]]
Wine regions with [[Mediterranean climate]]s are characterised by their long growing seasons of moderate to warm temperatures. Throughout the year there is little [[seasonal]] change with temperatures in the winter generally warmer than those of maritime and continental climates. During the grapevine growing season, there is very little rain fall (with most precipitation occurring in the winter months) which increases the risk of the viticultural hazard of [[drought]] and may present the need for supplemental irrigation.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 179-195, et al"/&gt;

The Mediterranean climate is most readily associated with the areas around the [[Mediterranean basin]], where viticulture and [[winemaking]] first flourished on a large scale due to the influence of the [[Phoenicians and wine|Phoenicians]], [[Ancient Greece and wine|Greeks]], and [[Ancient Rome and wine|Romans]] of the [[ancient world]].&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 179-195, et al"/&gt;

==Continental climates==

[[File:Upper_Mississippi_River_Valley_AVA.png|right|thumb|The [[Upper Mississippi River Valley AVA]] in the [[Midwestern United States]] has a continental climate.]]
[[File:Xinjiang_in_China_(de-facto).svg|right|thumb|[[Xinjiang]] is NW China located near the centre of Asia, so its vineyards have a very continental climate.]]
Wine regions with [[continental climate]]s are characterised by the very marked seasonal changes that occur throughout the growing season, with hot temperatures during the summer season and winters cold enough for periodic ice and snow. This is generally described as having a high degree of [[continentality]]. Regions with this type of climate are often found inland on [[continents]] without a significant body of water, such as an [[Inland sea (geology)|inland sea]], that can moderate their temperatures. Often during the growing season, continental climates will have wide [[diurnal temperature variations]] with very warm temperatures during the day that drop drastically at night. During the winter and early spring months, [[frost]] and [[hail]] can be viticultural hazards. Depending on the particular macroclimate of the region, irrigation may be needed to supplement seasonal rainfall. These many climatic influences contribute to the wide [[vintage]] variation that is often typical of continental climates such as [[Burgundy (wine)|Burgundy]].&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 179-195, et al"/&gt;

There are more wine regions with continental climates in the northern hemisphere than there are in the southern hemisphere. This is due, in part, to small land mass size of southern hemisphere continents relative to the large oceans nearby. This difference means that the oceans exert a more direct influence on the climate of the southern hemisphere wine regions (making them maritime or possibly Mediterranean) than they would on the larger northern hemisphere continents. There are also several wine regions (such as [[Spain (wine)|Spain]]) that have areas that exhibit a [[continental Mediterranean climate]] due to their altitude or distance from the sea. These regions will have more distinct seasonal change than Mediterranean climates, but still retain some characteristics like a long growing season that is very dry during the summer.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 179-195, et al"/&gt;

[[File:Gardenroute_overview.gif|right|thumb|The [[Garden Route]] wine regions of South Africa have a very mild subtropical maritime climate.]] 
Wine regions with [[oceanic climate|maritime climates]] are characterised by their close proximity to large bodies of water (such as [[oceans]], [[estuaries]] and inland seas) that moderate their temperatures. Maritime climates share many characteristics with both Mediterranean and continental climates and are often described as a "middle ground" between the two extremes.&lt;ref name="Fallis pg 20-21"&gt;C. Fallis, editor ''The Encyclopedic Atlas of Wine'' pg 20-21 Global Book Publishing 2006 {{ISBN|1-74048-050-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Mediterranean climates, maritime climates have a long growing season, with [[water current]]s moderating the region's temperatures. However, while Mediterranean climates are usually very dry during the growing season, maritime climates are often subject to the viticultural hazards of excessive rain and [[humidity]] which may promote various [[grape diseases]], such as [[mold]] and [[mildew]]. Like continental climates, maritime climates will have distinct seasonal changes, but they are usually not as drastic, with warm, rather than hot, summers and cool, rather than cold, winters.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 179-195, et al"/&gt; Maritime climates also exist in some wine-growing areas of highlands of subtropical and tropical latitudes, including the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] in the USA, eastern Australian highlands, and central highlands of Mexico.

'''John Edward H. Rulloff''' (also known as '''Ruloff''', '''Rulofson''', or '''Rulloffson''', as well as several aliases; 1819/1820 – May 18, 1871) was a 19th century American doctor, lawyer, schoolmaster, photographer, inventor, carpet designer, [[phrenology|phrenologist]], and [[philologist]], in addition to a career criminal and [[serial killer]]. This dichotomy was exemplified in the title of his 1871 biography, ''The Man of Two Lives''. He was also known as "The Genius Killer."

Rulloff's brain is said to be the second largest brain on record,&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, Nov. 7, 1972, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/07/archives/brain-exhibit-recalls-early-approach.html&lt;/ref&gt; with 1673&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. It can be seen on display at the [[Wilder Brain Collection]] in the [[psychology]] department of [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]].

== Early life ==
Rulloff was born near [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], to German immigrant parents. His brother was photographer [[William Rulofson]]. Rulloff's "two lives" were both premature: by the time he was twenty years old, he had already worked in a law firm and served two years in prison for [[embezzlement]]. In 1842 he moved to [[Dryden, New York|Dryden]] in [[Upstate New York]], where he worked as a school teacher and studied [[botanical medicine]] with Dr. Henry W. Bull. The following year, Rulloff impulsively married Bull's seventeen-year-old cousin, Harriet Schutt, with no formal [[courtship]] and against the wishes of Schutt's family, who considered Rulloff beneath their station.

Rulloff was a jealous, possessive husband. After witnessing his wife kissing Bull once, Rulloff took her aside and produced a vial, telling her that it contained poison, and that he had used an identical one to kill his niece and sister-in-law, who had died earlier under Rulloff's medical care. He ordered her to drink from it, telling her that they would [[murder-suicide|die together]]. When she screamed for help, he attempted to calm her, telling her that it was a joke.

== Murders of Harriet and Priscilla Rulloff ==
The couple moved to [[Lansing, New York]], where Harriet gave birth to a girl, Priscilla. Rulloff wanted to be further away from his wife's family and he pressured her to move to [[Ohio]], where he planned to work as a lawyer or college professor. When Harriet refused and threatened to return to her family with their daughter, on June 22, 1844, Rulloff accused her of having an affair with Bull and fatally hit her on the head with a pestle. Rulloff decided to commit suicide, but he found himself incapable. The next day, Rulloff borrowed a horse and wagon from his neighbors, the Andersons, with the pretense of returning a wooden chest to his uncle. Besides the chest, the Andersons saw Rulloff placing a half-full sack or pillow case in the wagon, and subsequently driving toward [[Cayuga Lake]], on the opposite direction to his declared destination. When Rulloff returned, still with the chest, he told Mrs. Anderson that he and his wife would be out of town for a couple of weeks, and left his house in complete disarray.

Rulloff returned amid rumors that he had killed his wife. Confronted by the Schutts, he denied any murder and claimed first that his wife had abandoned him, then that they had moved to Ohio together. Neither statement was believed because Harriet's clothes and personal items had been found in the house, implying that she had not left on her own accord. Rulloff fled a second time, but he was pursued by his brother-in-law, Ephraim Schutt, who had him apprehended and brought to [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] to stand trial for murder. Cayuga Lake was dredged in an attempt to locate the bodies, but they were never found. As the [[grand jury]] was unwilling to indict Rulloff for [[Murder conviction without a body|murder without]] [[corpus delicti|a body]], he was instead accused of [[kidnapping]] his wife. Rulloff conducted his own defense at his trial, in 1846, focusing on the lack of evidence that any crime had been committed. Nevertheless, he was found guilty and sentenced to ten years with [[hard labor]] in [[Auburn Prison]].

While incarcerated, Rulloff [[autodidacticism|taught himself]] [[philology]] and formulated his own theory about [[language evolution]], that he intended to publish under the title ''The Great Secret in Philology'' after his release. He was even allowed to teach students in his own cell. However, his hopes of starting a career in the field were dashed when he was informed that [[Tompkins County, New York|Tompkins County]] would charge Rulloff with the murder of his wife as soon as he was released. Rulloff claimed [[double jeopardy]] and started a legal battle from jail. The [[district attorney]] dropped the charge for Harriet Rulloff's murder, but replaced it with one for Priscilla's. Rulloff was in turn found guilty of this crime in 1858, but he escaped custody before the verdict reached him.

== Life after his escape ==
Rulloff was likely assisted in his escape by the son of Ithaca's [[undersheriff]], Albert Jarvis, who had been tutored in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]] by Rulloff, and would later become his partner in crime; or by Jarvis's mother Jane, who had also befriended Rulloff, and publicly manifested her disbelief about him being a murderer. Whatever the case, Rulloff fled west, alone and on foot. He fed on wild nuts and food stolen from farms, and lost two toes to [[frostbite]]. Reaching [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]], he introduced himself to local inventor A. B. Richmond under the alias "James Nelson", and convinced him to start a business partnership after Rulloff brandished his knowledge in subjects as varied as [[Conchology]], [[Mineralogy]], [[Forensic anthropology]] and [[Entomology]]. Rulloff made a similar impression at [[Washington &amp; Jefferson College|Jefferson College]], and was about to take a professorship when Jarvis wrote him, informing him that his mother and himself were now destitute, and threatening him if he didn't help them out. Rulloff robbed a jewelry store with the intention of giving the bounty to the Jarvises, but he was arrested and sent back to Ithaca. In spite of being a murder convict, a fugitive, and a robber, Rulloff appealed his murder conviction successfully, was acquitted, and was released after authorities decided to not prosecute him for other offenses.

Rulloff moved to [[New York City]] with Jarvis, where they survived as burglars. In 1861, Rulloff was arrested and sentenced to serve two years and a half term in [[Sing Sing Prison]]. There he met his second partner in crime, William T. Dexter. In 1869, Rulloff learned of the coming first convention of the [[American Philological Association]] in [[Poughkeepsie]], and sent a manuscript detailing his theory in language evolution, which he titled ''Method in the Formation of Language''. He used the alias "Professor Euri Lorio", and announced his intention to auction the manuscript for a starting sum of $500,000. Although Rulloff believed that his findings would revolutionize the field, the Association rejected them and none of its members bid for the text.

== Murder of Frederick Merrick ==
Rulloff, Jarvis and Dexter's next plan was the robbery of a dry goods store in [[Binghamton, New York]] in 1870, while the two live-in clerks (Frederick Merrick and Gilbert Burrows) slept upstairs. The trio burned [[chloroform]] in an attempt to ensure that the employees would sleep through the ordeal, but they awoke when Jarvis stumbled on something. Merrick first attempted to shoot Rulloff with a gun that he kept under the pillow, but it failed to discharge. After that, he grabbed a stool and threw it at the fleeing Rulloff. Meanwhile, Burrows grabbed Dexter and proceed to beat him. When Merrick joined Burrows, Jarvis and Rulloff came to Dexter's rescue, and Rulloff made a warning shot to the air. Burrows stopped, but Merrick threw himself at Jarvis. Rulloff made a second warning shot, and when Merrick wouldn't desist, he pointed the gun to Merrick's head and fired, killing him instantly.

In their disordered escape, the robbers missed the boat that should ferry them across the [[Chenango River]] and attempted to swim across the river. The exhausted Jarvis and Dexter were unable to keep up with the current and drowned. Their bodies were recovered in the morning. Rulloff made it across, but he left behind a couple of leather boots with a distinctive depression where his missing toes would be.

== Arrest and execution ==
Alerted by Burrows, the Binghamton police organized patrols and rounded up men that looked suspicious. Rulloff made himself a suspect the next morning, when he ignored a request to identify himself at the local [[railroad station]] and ran across the train tracks to a nearby farm's [[outhouse]], where he was captured. Rulloff identified himself first as "Charles Augustus", and later as "George Williams." He was brought before the bodies of Dexter and Jarvis, who had been publicly displayed to help identify them, and he denied to know them. However, Rulloff himself was recognized by another onlooker, judge Ransom Balcom, who said: "You are Edward H. Rulloff. You murdered your wife and child in Lansing in 1845 [sic]." He then turned to the authorities and warned: "This man understands his rights better than you do, and will defend them to the last." Documents found in Dexter and Jarvis's bodies later led investigators to a [[Brooklyn]] apartment owned by Rulloff under yet another name, Edward C. Howard.

Rulloff's trial began on January 4, 1871. It became a sensation that attracted crowds of 2,000 people daily. Some, such as the director of the ''[[New York Tribune]]'', [[Horace Greeley]], believed that a man with the evident intellectual prowess of Rulloff was too valuable to be executed and should be spared, regardless of his guilt. Rulloff himself, who led his own defense again, refused to plead [[not guilty by reason of insanity|insanity]] and requested that [[Governor of New York|Governor]] [[John T. Hoffman]] either pardoned him, or stalled his execution until his theory on language evolution was fully developed, claiming that he'd be ready to die after that. [[Mark Twain]] wrote a letter to the ''Tribune'' in which he satirized the requests of clemency for Rulloff, stating his willingness to produce a different man that would admit to Rulloff's crime and be executed in his place. On March 3, Rulloff was found guilty and sentenced to [[hanging|hang]]. While in death row, he confessed to the murder of his wife and described it in detail, but he never admitted to having killed his daughter. This caused some speculation that he had sent her to live with relatives under a different name and not killed her.

Rullof's execution on May 18, 1871 was the last public hanging in New York. Some sources claim he gave a speech on the [[gallows]], ending with "Hurry it up! I want to be in [[hell]] in time for dinner."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rulloffs.com/pages/story.html Profile of Rulloff] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223164130/http://www.rulloffs.com/pages/story.html |date=2012-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources say that his only statement was "I can't stand still."&lt;ref name="crookedlakereview"&gt;[http://www.crookedlakereview.com/articles/34_66/62may1993/62wisbey.html The Life and Death of Edward H. Rulloff]&lt;/ref&gt; His brain was taken to [[Cornell University]] after his execution, where a professor, [[Burt Wilder]], declared Rulloff's brain to be the largest on record.&lt;ref name="crookedlakereview" /&gt;

An '''elevator pitch''', '''elevator speech''', or '''elevator statement''' is a short description of an idea, product, company, or oneself that explains the concept in a way such that any listener can understand it in a short period of time. This description typically explains who the product/company is for, what it does, why it is needed, and how it will get done. For the latter, when explaining an individual, the description generally explains one’s skills and goals, and why they would be a productive and beneficial person to have on a team or within a company/project. An elevator pitch does not have to include all of these components, but it usually does at least explain what the idea, product, company, or person is and why it/they are valuable.

An elevator pitch can be used to entice an investor, executive in a company, or explain an idea to a founder’s parents. The goal is simply to convey the overall concept or topic in an exciting way. Unlike a [[Sales_presentation|sales pitch]], there may not be a clear buyer/seller relationship.

The name—elevator pitch—reflects the idea that it should be possible to deliver the summary in the time span of an elevator ride, or approximately thirty seconds to two minutes. 

== Background information and history ==
There are many origin stories for the elevator pitch or elevator speech. One commonly-known origin story is that of Ilene Rosenzweig and Michael Caruso, two former journalists in the 90s. According to Rosenzweig, Caruso was a senior editor at [[Vanity_Fair_(magazines)|Vanity Fair]] and was continuously attempting to pitch story ideas to the Editor-In-Chief at the time, but could never pin her down long enough to do so simply because she was always on the move.&lt;ref&gt;http://presentingrob.blogspot.com/2016/01/elevator-pitches-brief-history.html&lt;/ref&gt; So, in order to pitch her ideas, Caruso would join her during short free periods of time she had, such as on an elevator ride. Thus, the concept of an elevator pitch was created, as says Rosenzweig.

However, there is another known potential origin story that dates back prior to the story of Rosenzweig and Caruso. [[Philip_B._Crosby#Works|Philip Crosby]], author of “The Art of Getting Your Own Sweet Way” (1972) and “Quality Is Still Free,” (1996) suggested individuals should have a pre-prepared speech that can deliver information regarding themselves or a quality that they can provide within a short period of time, namely the amount of time of an elevator ride for if an individual finds themselves on an elevator with a prominent figure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-confidant.info/2012/the-history-of-the-elevator-speech/&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, an elevator pitch, or elevator speech, is meant to allow an individual to pitch themselves or an idea to a person who is high up in a company, with very limited time.

Crosby, who worked as a quality test technician, and then later as the Director of Quality at [[ITT_Inc.|International Telephone and Telegraph]], recounted how an elevator pitch could be used to push for change within the company.&lt;ref&gt;http://asq.org/quality-progress/2011/05/one-good-idea-going-up.html&lt;/ref&gt; He planned a speech regarding the change he wanted to see and waited at the ITT headquarters elevator. Crosby stepped onto an elevator with the [[Chief_executive_officer|CEO]] of the company in order to deliver his speech. Once they reached the floor in which the CEO was getting off, Crosby was asked to deliver a full presentation on the topic at a meeting for all of the general managers.

The concept of an elevator pitch, as created by Crosby, did not receive much popularity until two statisticians, Gerry Hahn from [[General Electric]] and Tom Boardman, a professor at the [[University_of_Colorado|University or Colorado]], started to push the concept onto other statisticians. The two pushed this concept in order to help other statisticians in promoting what they have to offer. Boardman pushed the concept much further than Hahn, resulting in the elevator pitch, or elevator speech, ultimately being linked to Boardman and his professional life.

Another origin story for the elevator pitch is from [[Elisha_Otis|Elisha Graves Otis]], the inventor of a device meant for elevator safety, which dates back to the 1850s. In 1852, Otis began developing a device that would improve the safety of elevators, specifically related to the hoists used to lift heavy equipment to upper floors.&lt;ref&gt;https://buildingpharmabrands.com/2013/03/29/the-first-ever-elevator-pitch/&lt;/ref&gt; The device was created out of steel wagon spring meshing and provided a backup catch and hold mechanism if the rope lifting the elevator gave way. In 1854, in the Crystal Palace Exposition in New York in front of a big audience, Otis revealed his device. He did so by lifting an elevator, like normal, but as it was positioned approximately halfway up the elevator shaft, the rope was cut. The elevator platform was held in place by Otis’ device. This can be known as the first elevator pitch ever.

== Aspects of an Elevator Pitch ==

An elevator pitch is meant to last the duration of an elevator ride, which can vary in length from approximately 15 seconds to two minutes. Therefore, the main focus of an elevator pitch should be making it short and direct. According to the Idaho Business Review&lt;ref&gt;https://idahobusinessreview.com/2012/02/22/the-elevator-pitch-for-every-professional/&lt;/ref&gt;, the first two sentences of any elevator pitch are the most important, and should hook or grab the attention of the listener(s). Information in an elevator pitch, due to the limited amount of time, should be condensed in order to express the most important ideas or concepts within the allotted time. 
[[File:Business_agreement_handshake_at_coffee_shop.jpg|thumb|225x225px|Business agreement at coffee shop]]
Furthermore, the Idaho Business Review suggests individuals who use an elevator pitch deliver it using simple language, and avoiding statistics or other language that may disrupt the focus of the listener. Bloomberg Businessweek suggests that an important lesson to think about when giving an elevator pitch is to “adjust the pitch to the person who is listening, and refine it as you and your business continue to grow and change.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mrgriffin.org/FHSWEB/ENT/articles/ThePerfectElevatorPitch.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; When delivering an elevator pitch, individuals are encouraged to remain flexible and adaptable, and to be able to deliver the pitch in a genuine and fluent fashion. By doing so, the intended audience of the pitch will likely be able to follow the information, and will not interpret it as being too scripted.

== Advantages of utilizing Elevator Pitches ==

Advantages to conducting an elevator pitch, or elevator speech, include convenience and simplicity. For instance, elevator pitches can be given on short notice and without much preparation due to the pre-planning of the content being delivered within said pitch.&lt;ref&gt;https://idahobusinessreview.com/2012/02/22/the-elevator-pitch-for-every-professional/&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, elevator pitches allow the individual who is giving the pitch the ability to simplify the content and deliver it in a less complicated manner by providing the information in a cut-down fashion that gets right to the point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/36831/wow-project|publisher=[[FastCompany]]|title=The Wow Project|accessdate=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3779">In [[applied linguistics]], an '''error''' is a deviation from accepted rules of a language made by a learner of a second language. Such errors result from the learner's lack of knowledge of correct rules of the target language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ellis |first= Rod |authorlink=Rod Ellis |title=The Study of Second Language Acquisition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KglibyrZ5sC&amp;pg=PA700 |accessdate= |year=1994 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford]] |isbn= 0-19-437189-1 |page=700}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant distinction is generally made between ''errors'' and ''mistakes'' which are not treated the same from a linguistic viewpoint. The study of learners' errors was the main area of investigation by linguists in the history of [[second-language acquisition]] research.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
[[H. Douglas Brown]] has defined linguistic errors as "a noticeable deviation from the adult grammar of a native speaker, reflecting the interlanguage competence of the learner." He cites an example ''Does John can sing?'' where a preceding ''do'' auxiliary verb has been used as an error.&lt;ref name=Brown205&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=H. Douglas |title=Principles of Language Learning and Teaching |url=|accessdate= |year=1994 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall Regents]] |location=[[New Jersey]] |isbn= 0-13-191966-0 |page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference between error and mistake==
In linguistics, it is considered important to distinguish errors from mistakes. A distinction is always made between errors and mistakes where the former is defined as resulting from a learner's lack of proper grammatical knowledge, whilst the latter as a failure to utilize a known system correctly.&lt;ref name=Brown205/&gt; Brown terms these mistakes as performance errors. Mistakes of this kind are frequently made by both native speakers and second language learners. However, native speakers are generally able to correct themselves quickly. Such mistakes include slips of the tongue and random ungrammatical formations. On the other hand, errors are systematic in that they occur repeatedly and are not recognizable by the learner. They are a part of the learner's interlanguage, and the learner does not generally consider them as errors. They are ''errors'' only from the perspective of teachers and others who are aware that the learner has deviated from a grammatical norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gass|first1= Susan M.|last2=Selinker |first2=Larry |title=Second Language Acquisition: An Introductory Course |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fhnbMj597-4C&amp;pg=PA102 |publisher=Routledge |isbn= 0203932846|pages=102–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, mistakes can be self-corrected with or without being pointed out to the speaker but errors cannot be self-corrected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nika Purwati |title=Research in English and Applied Linguistics (REAL) Vol 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcFge3z0sqkC&amp;pg=PA307 |publisher=Routledge |isbn= 6029126237|page=307|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance of error ==
S. Pit Corder was probably the first to point out and discuss the importance of errors learners make in course of their learning a second language. Soon after, the study and analysis of learners’ errors took a prominent place in applied linguistics. Brown suggests that the process of second language learning is not very different from learning a first language, and the feedback a L2 learner gets upon making errors benefits him in developing the L2 knowledge.&lt;ref name=Brown205/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6406">'''Galician-language literature''' is the literature written in [[Galician language|Galician]]. The earliest works in Galician language are from the early 13th-century ''[[trovadorismo]]'' tradition. In the [[Middle Ages]], ''Galego-português'' ([[Galician-Portuguese]]) was a language of culture, poetry (troubadours) and religion throughout not only [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Portugal]] but also [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]].

After the separation of Portuguese and Galician, Galician was considered provincial and was not widely used for literary or academic purposes. It was with  the ''[[Rexurdimento]]'' ("Rebirth"), in the mid-19th century that Galician was used again in literature, and then in politics.

Much [[literature by Galician authors]] is written in Spanish, such as by [[Ignacio Ramonet]] or [[Gonzalo Torrente Ballester]] - though such writers tend to be excluded from discussion of [[Galician literature]] and counted as [[Spanish-language literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Jo Labanyi ''Spanish Literature: A Very Short Introduction'' 2010 "An issue here is how to classify Catalan, Galician, and Basque authors who write in Castilian. They tend to be excluded from discussion of Catalan, Galician, and Basque literature. This produces complications in the case of writers who have published in both languages: for example, the poet Pere Gimferrer (1945–) who in the 1970s switched from Castilian to Catalan; or the novelist Terenci Moix (1942–2003) who in..."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rosalia Castro de Murguía]]'s ''Cantares Gallegos'' (1863; Galician Songs) was the first Galician-language book to be published in four centuries.&lt;ref&gt;World Literature in Spanish: An Encyclopedia: An Encyclopedia - Page 162 Maureen Ihrie, Salvador Oropesa - 2011 "Yet it was her verse collection Cantares Gallegos (1863; Galician Songs) that gave rise to that renaissance, because it was the first Galician-language book to be published in four centuries. In this sense, Rosalıa's work became the ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Related to literature, [[Chano Pineiro]]'s 1989 ''Sempre Xonxa'' (Forever a Woman) is regarded as the first Galician-language film.&lt;ref&gt;Film history - Volume 14 - Page 102 2002 "Chano Pineiro's 1989 Sempre Xonxa (Forever a Woman)was the first Galician-language film from Spain's northwest corner. The same year, Xavier Villaverde's ContinentaI another Galician-language work, met with more mixed reviews."&lt;/ref&gt; The intellectual group [[Xeración Nós]], a name that alludes to the Irish [[Sinn Féin]] ("We Ourselves") promoted Galacian culture in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Geert Lernout, Wim Van Mierlo The Reception of James Joyce in Europe - Page 425 - 2004 "They were known as the Xeración Nós (Generation ourselves) — a name that alludes to the Irish Sinn Fein (We ourselves) — and they were grouped ... In August 1926, also in Nos, Otero Pedrayo gave the Galician translation of various .."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xeración Galaxia]] was established to translate modern texts that would link an independent Galician culture with the European context.&lt;ref&gt;Kirsty Hooper ''Writing Galicia Into the World: New Cartographies, New Poetics'' 2011- Page 21 "Galician language and culture, setting them up in opposition to Spanish language and culture, in a way that in 1922 was still new ... The renewal of Galician cultural history from the early 1950s, through the efforts of the intellectual group known as the Xeración Galaxia, was ... given the estate's refusal to authorize translation into Galician, with the slightly bizarre consequence that Galician was confirmed"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bible translations into Galician|Galician translation of the Bible]] was begun in 1968 by Editorial SEPT and published in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Harald Kittel Ubersetzung, Translation, Traduction: Ein Internationales Handbuch 2011  Page 2015 "The aim of this 'Xeración' was to translate avant-garde texts that could help link an independent Galician culture with the wider European content. ... The Galician translation of the Bible was begun in 1968 and published in 1989. "&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Ghulfan''' (also Gulfan, Uncu, Uncunwee, Wunci, Wuncimbe) is a [[Hill Nubian language]] spoken in the central [[Nuba Mountains]] in the south of [[Sudan]]. It is spoken by around 33,000 people in the Ghulfan Kurgul and Ghulfan Morung hills, south of Dilling. It is closely related to [[Kadaru language|Kadaru]], with which it forms the Kadaru-Ghulfan subgroup of Hill Nubian. ''Ethnologue'' reports that the use of Ghulfan is decreasing as younger speakers switch to [[Sudanese Arabic]] and that there are no [[monolingual]] speakers of the language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to literary theorist [[Rita Felski]], it is "a distinctively modern style of interpretation that circumvents obvious or self-evident meanings in order to draw out less visible and less flattering truths;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"{{bracket|Marx, Freud, and Nietzsche}} share a commitment to unmasking 'the lies and [[illusion]]s of [[consciousness]]'; they are the architects of a distinctively modern style of interpretation that circumvents obvious or self-evident meanings in order to draw out less visible and less flattering truths ...

Felski also notes that "The 'hermeneutics of suspicion' is the name usually bestowed on [a] technique of reading texts against the grain and between the lines, of cataloging their omissions and laying bare their contradictions, of rubbing in what they fail to know and cannot represent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Felski |first=Rita |title=Context Stinks |url=http://kclunc19.web.unc.edu/files/2014/10/FelskiRita-Context-Stinks.pdf |journal=[[New Literary History]] |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |location=[[Baltimore, Maryland]] |date=Autumn 2011 |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=573-591 |doi=10.1353/nlh.2011.0045}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense, it can be seen as being related to [[Critique of ideology|ideology critique]].

'''Idiom Neutral''' is an [[international auxiliary language]], published in 1902 by the [[International Academy of the Universal Language]] (''Akademi Internasional de Lingu Universal'') under the leadership of [[Waldemar Rosenberger]], a [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] [[engineer]].

== History ==
The Academy had its origin as the ''Kadem bevünetik volapüka'' (literally 'International Academy of the World Language') at a congress in [[Munich]] in August 1887, was set up to conserve and perfect the auxiliary language [[Volapük]]. Under Rosenberger, who became the Academy’s director in 1892, the group began to make considerable changes in the grammar and vocabulary of Volapük, changing its nature into an entirely different language. The vocabulary was almost completely replaced by words more closely resembling those used in Western European languages, and a number of grammatical forms unfamiliar to Western Europeans were discarded. It was understood that the changes effectively resulted in the creation of a new language, which was named “Idiom Neutral” (which means “the neutral idiom” or “the neutral language”).

The name of the Academy was changed to ''Akademi Internasional de Lingu Universal'' in 1898 and the circulars of the Academy were written in the new language from that year. Those who continued to use Volapük re-formed the [[International Academy of Volapük]], retaining its name (with a spelling change) as ''Kadäm Bevünetik Volapüka''.

Dictionaries of Idiom Neutral including an outline of the grammar were published in several European languages in 1902 and 1903.

The language, sometimes referred to as “Neutral” or “the Neutral language” by English-speaking writers, created interest among international language enthusiasts at the time. Rosenberger published a periodical in the language called ''Progres''. In 1907 Neutral was one of the projects considered by a committee of scholars which met in [[Paris]] to select an international auxiliary language (what the committee actually decided upon is disputed; see [[Ido (language)|Ido]] and its external links for more information).

In 1908 the Akademi which had created Idiom Neutral effectively chose to abandon it in favor of [[Latino sine flexione]], a simplified form of [[Latin]] developed by Italian mathematician [[Giuseppe Peano]]. Peano was appointed the director of the Akademi, and its name was changed to [[Academia pro Interlingua]]. Peano's language was sometimes called ''Interlingua'', not to be confused with the better-known [[Interlingua]] presented in 1951 by the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] ([[International Auxiliary Language Association|IALA]]).
 
In 1912 Rosenberger published a reformed version of Neutral called Reform-Neutral &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/ManualOfThePracticalUniversalLanguageReformNeutralW.Rosenberger1912] Handbook of Reform-Neutral (1912) at archive.org&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Grammar ==

The following is a rough sketch of Idiom Neutral [[grammar]]. It does not lay out every detail of grammar worked out for the language. The simple grammar of Idiom Neutral is similar to [[Interlingua|Interlingua's]].

Twenty-two letters of the [[Latin script]] are used to write Neutral; the letters q, w, x, and z do not occur. The five [[vowel]]s ('''a''', '''e''', '''i''', '''o''', '''u''') are pronounced roughly as in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Vowels which appear next to each other are pronounced separately, not as a [[diphthong]]. The [[consonant]]s have the same values as in [[English language|English]], except that '''c''' is pronounced like English ''ch'' in ''church'', '''g''' is always like the ''g'' in ''gate'', and '''j''' is pronounced as the ''s'' in ''measure''. The combination '''sh''' is pronounced like English ''sh''.

The [[lexical stress|stress]] falls on the vowel that precedes the last consonant. If no vowel precedes the last consonant (e.g. '''via''' ''way'') the stress is on the first vowel. In a few cases the vowel at the end of a word is stressed; these vowels are marked with an [[acute accent]] (e.g. '''idé''' ''idea''). Such accents are the only [[diacritic]]s used in writing Neutral words.

===Nouns and adjectives===

Unlike [[Esperanto]] and [[Ido (language)|Ido]], [[noun]]s can end in any letter. There is no [[inflection]] for [[grammatical case|case]]. The [[plural]] is formed by adding the letter '''i''' at the end of the word.

[[Adjective]]s can also end in any letter. They normally appear after the nouns they modify and do not agree in [[grammatical number|number]] with their nouns, e.g. '''kaset grand''' ''big box'', '''kaseti grand''' ''big boxes''.

[[comparative|Comparison]] of adjectives (and [[adverb]]s) is with '''plu ... ka''' (''more ... than''), '''tale ... kuale''' (''as ... as'') and '''leplu''' (''most, -est'').

===Verbs===

[[Verb]]s are [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] as follows. Examples are shown for the verb '''amar''' ''to love'' in the [[grammatical voice|active voice]]; the endings do not change for [[grammatical person|person]] or [[grammatical number|number]], except in the [[imperative mood|imperative]].

[[Infinitive]]: '''amar''' ''to love''&lt;br&gt;
[[Present tense|Present]]: '''mi am''' ''I love''&lt;br&gt;
Imperfect: '''mi amav''' ''I loved, I was loving''&lt;br&gt;
[[Future tense|Future]]: '''mi amero''' ''I will love''&lt;br&gt;
[[Present perfect]]: '''mi av amed''' ''I have loved''&lt;br&gt;
[[Pluperfect]]: '''mi avav amed''' ''I had loved''&lt;br&gt;
[[Future perfect]]: '''mi avero amed''' ''I will have loved''&lt;br&gt;
[[Conditional tense|Conditional]]: '''mi amerio''' ''I would love''&lt;br&gt;
Past conditional: '''mi averio amed''' ''I would have loved''&lt;br&gt;
[[imperative mood|Imperative]] second person singular: '''ama!''' ''Love!''&lt;br&gt;
Imperative second person plural: '''amate!''' ''Love!''&lt;br&gt;
Imperative first person plural: '''amam!''' ''Let's love!''&lt;br&gt;
Active [[participle]]: '''amant''' ''loving''&lt;br&gt;
Passive [[participle]]: '''amed''' ''loved''

The [[grammatical voice|passive voice]] is formed with the verb '''esar''' ''to be'' and the passive participle: '''mi es amed''' ''I am loved'', '''mi averio esed amed''' ''I would have been loved'', etc.

There is no inflection for a [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] or volitive. In expressions of desire etc., the present tense is used e.g. '''mi volu ke il am''' ''I want him to love''; '''ila demandav ke vo lekt it''' ''she asked you to read it''.

===Other parts of speech===

There is no definite or indefinite [[article (grammar)|article]]. [[Adverb]]s can be formed from adjectives by adding '''e'''. Some [[preposition]]s are formed from other words by adding '''u''' e.g. '''relativu''' ''relative to'' from '''relativ''' ''relative'' (adj.).

== Sample texts ==

"Aparati deb esar adresed&lt;!--The spelling "adresed" is correct here; this is a sample text in another language--&gt; a shef de stasion Peterburg e deb esar asekured per vo e per votr kont; if aparati u partii de ili esero ruined u perded in voyaj, vo deb mitar nemediate otri, plasu aparati e partii ruined u perded."

''The apparatus must be addressed to the chief of the St. Petersburg station and must be insured by you and by your account; if the apparatus or parts of them are ruined or lost in the voyage, you must send others immediately in place of the apparatus and parts ruined or lost.''

"Publikasion de idiom neutral interesero votr filio, kel kolekt postmarki, kause ist idiom es lingu praktikal pro korespondad ko kolektatori in otr landi."

''The publication of Idiom Neutral will interest your son, who collects postage stamps, because this idiom is a practical language for correspondence with collectors in other countries.''

'''Johannes du Plessis Scholtz''' (14 May 1900 &amp;ndash; 26 January 1990) was a [[South African]] [[philology|philologist]], [[history of art|art historian]], and art collector.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:PROF.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A picture of Prof. J. du P. Scholtz in his chair.|Prof. J. du P. Scholtz. {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;

==Scholarly life==
Scholtz studied first at the [[University of Stellenbosch]], completing an M.A. in 1920. He then took a job assisting the philologist {{Interlanguage link multi|Johannes Jacobus Smith (philologist)|af|3=Johannes J. Smith|lt=J. J. Smith}} in editing ''[[Huisgenoot|Die Huisgenoot]]'', but he moved shortly thereafter over to the [[Naspers|Nasionale Pers]] to be head of the publication department. In 1924 he went to [[Amsterdam]] and in 1927 he received a Ph.D. from the [[Gemeentelijke Universiteit]]. He returned to the Netherlands for two years (1929–1931) to pursue further studies in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]  [[dialectology]] and [[structural linguistics]], studies which formed the foundation of his later work in [[Afrikaans]].

Upon returning to Stellenbosch, he worked again for J. J. Smith on the [[Woordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal]]. He also worked under [[C. G. N. de Vooys]] at the [[University of Utrecht]] on his dissertation ''Die Afrikaner en Sy Taal, 1806-1875'', for which he received the [[Hertzog Prize]] for scholarly prose (what is more, the award had existed until then; it was expressly created in order to honor him with it). In 1934 he accepted a lecturership at the [[University of Cape Town]] teaching [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Afrikaans]]. In 1950 he became head of the Department of Dutch and Afrikaans and Hofmeyr-Professor, and in 1965 retired as emeritus professor to pursue linguistic and artistic scholarship without the pressure of university administration. After his retirement he received [[honorary doctorate]]s from the University of Stellenbosch and the [[University of the Orange Free State]]. His final commemoration came in the form of a ''[[Festschrift]]'' entitled ''Dietse Studies'', given on the occasion of his 65th birthday with contributions from the foremost South African scholars of the time, as well as notable Dutch scholars such as [[C. B. van Haeringen]].

While others in South Africa, and to a lesser extent the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], were still discussing  origin of Afrikaans at a theoretical level only, Scholtz had been collecting and analyzing as much data as were available. He steered clear of theorizing, and his work was based on two great linguistic schools of the time: [[Leonard Bloomfield]]'s [[descriptive linguistics]], and [[N. S. Trubetzkoy]]'s [[structural linguistics]]. Scholtz was the first in South Africa to employ these approaches and in so doing revolutionized the world of Afrikaans linguistics. His work remains to this day the high-water mark for the fields of Afrikaans philology and linguistics.

Scholtz sat on numerous committees such as the Taalkommissie of the [[South African Academy]], the [[Van Riebeeck Society]], the [[Historical Monuments Commission]], the Archive Commission, and was one of the founders of the [[Vereniging vir die Vrye Boek]]. He was a member of  the [[South African Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[Maatschappij der Nederlandsche Letterkunde]], the [[International Centre for Onomastics]], and the [[Linguistic Society of America]]. He was also a co-trustee of the [[Irma Stern Trust]].

The South African Academy of Arts and Sciences honored him with numerous awards: in 1970 with the first [[Langenhoven Prize]] for linguistics, and in 1974 with the first [[Stals Prize]] for art history. The [[Kaapse Drie-Eeuestigting]] added to this and celebrated his work on the Irma Stern Trust with an honorary award in 1972.

==Publications==
His first scholarly work was an M.A. thesis on the language of the fishermen of [[Lamberts Bay|Lambertsbaai]], written under the tutelage of J. J. Smith, (which has subsequently been lost). In 1934 his publishing life began with the article "Afrikaanse geskrifte van Louis Henri Meurant uit die jare 1844-1850" in ''Tydskrif vir Wetenskap en Kuns'', Jg. 12, Nr. 4, Julie 1934.

The most productive period for Scholtz, however, was after 1950, after his retirement from UCT in 1965. He now had  time for his art studies, and also to publish  analyses of the textual material that L.C. van Oordt had mined out of the Kaapse Argief. By this point in his intellectual life, Scholtz was in a perfect position to evaluate these texts.

Scholtz's monographs on [[Strat Caldecott]], [[Pieter Wenning]], [[D. C. Boonzaier]], [[Moses Kottler]], and [[Katrine Harries]] remain authoritative. Not only are they the best works on their subjects, but "Strat Caldecott, 1886-1929" has become a prized possession for collectors of Africana.

==Work in the arts==
He became interested in the fine arts at the height of classical [[modernism]]'s zenith. In 1923, while at the National Press, he met the "famous and feared"  D. C. Boonzaier, [[cartoonist]] and supporter of the fine arts in Cape Town. Through Boonzaier he became acquainted with art critic [[Bernard Lewis (critic)|Bernard Lewis]] and [[sculptor]]  Moses Kottler . Eventually, his circle of artist-friends was to include the [[Painting|painter]]s Enslin du Plessis, Jean Welz, Florence Zerffi  and  Irma Stern, the [[graphic artist]] Katrine Harries, and, less intimately, Hendrik Pierneef, Erich Mayer, and  Ruth Prowse, the members  of a school of South African Impressionism in the years 1915-1935. This was perhaps the most important epoch in South African art, and Scholtz was there for all of it. Scholtz's literary friends were famous in South Africa: M.E.R., N.P. van Wyk Louw, Dirk Opperman, and Boerneef.

'''Kalmyk Oirat''' ({{lang-xal-RU|Хальмг Өөрдин келн}}, ''Haľmg Öördin keln'', {{IPA-all|xalʲˈməg oːrˈtin kɛˈlən}}),&lt;ref&gt;Kalmyk is alternatively spelled as Kalmuck, Qalmaq, or Khal:mag; Kalmyk Oirat is sometimes called "Russian Oirat" or "Western Mongol"&lt;/ref&gt; commonly known as the '''Kalmyk language''' ({{lang-xal-RU|Хальмг келн}}, ''Haľmg keln'', {{IPA-all|xalʲˈməg kɛˈlɛn}}), is a [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] of the [[Oirat language]], natively spoken by the [[Kalmyk people]] of [[Kalmykia]], a federal subject of [[Russia]]. In Russia, it is the [[standard language|standard form]] of the [[Oirat language]] (based on the [[Torgut Oirat|Torgut dialect]]), which belongs to the [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]] language family. The [[Kalmyk people]] of the northwest [[Caspian Sea]] of Russia claim descent from the [[Oirats]] from [[Eurasia]], who have also historically settled in [[Mongolia]] and [[northwest China]]. According to [[UNESCO]], the language is "Definitely endangered".&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/index.php?hl=en&amp;page=atlasmap&amp;lid=368 UNESCO Atlas of the World's languages in danger] Retrieved on 2012-10-31 {{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Russian census of 2010, there are 80,500 speakers of an [[ethnic group|ethnic population]] consisting of 183,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/xal Kalmyk in Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Kalmyk is now only spoken as a native language by a small minority of the Kalmyk population.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Its decline as a [[living language]] began after the Kalmyk people [[Kalmyk deportations of 1943|were deported]] en masse from their homeland in December 1943, as punishment for limited [[Kalmykian Voluntary Cavalry Corps|Kalmyk collaboration with the Nazis]]. Significant factors contributing to its demise include: (1) the deaths of a substantial percentage of the Kalmyk population from disease and malnutrition, both during their travel and upon their arrival to remote exile settlements in [[Central Asia]], south central [[Siberia]] and the [[Soviet Far East]]; (2) the wide dispersal of the Kalmyk population; (3) the duration of exile, which ended in 1957; (4) the stigma associated with being accused of treason, and (5) assimilation into the larger, more dominant culture. Collectively, these factors discontinued the intergenerational language transmission.

In 1957, the Soviet government reinstated the [[Kalmyk Autonomous Oblast]] and later reestablished the [[Autonomous Republic of Kalmykia]]. The Kalmyk people were permitted to return to the Republic in 1957, 14 years after exile. The [[Russian language]], however, was made the official language of the Republic, and Sovietisation was imposed on the Kalmyk people, leading to drastic cuts in Kalmyk language education.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The Cyrillic alphabet became firmly established among the Kalmyks (and other peoples, too). For instance, books, periodicals, newspapers, etc., were published using it. By the late 1970s, the Russian language became the primary language of instruction in all schools in the Republic.

During the period of [[Perestroika]], Kalmyk linguists, in collaboration with the Kalmyk government, planned and tried to implement the revival of the Kalmyk language. This revival was seen as an integral part of the reassertion of Kalmyk culture. In an important symbolic gesture, the Kalmyk language was declared an official language of the Republic, giving it equal status with the Russian language with respect to official governmental use and language education.

During the production of the film ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', sound designer Rafe Mercieca—with his life-time partner Ben Curtis—based the language of the [[Ewok]]s on Kalmyk after hearing it spoken in a documentary and being impressed with its unusual phonology.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Geographic distribution==
The majority of Kalmyk language speakers live in the Republic of Kalmykia, where it is an official language. A small group of Kalmyk language speakers also live in France and the USA, but the use of Kalmyk is in steep decline. In all three locations, the actual number of speakers is unknown. Kalmyk is regarded as an endangered language.

As of 2012, the Kalmyk community in [[New Jersey]], which arrived in the US in the 1950s, was planning to work with the [[Endangered Voices]] project to promote Kalmyk language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Linguistic classification==
From a synchronic perspective, Kalmyk is the most prominent variety of Oirat. It is very close to the Oirat dialects found in Mongolia and the People’s Republic of China, both [[Phonology|phonologically]] and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]]. The differences in dialects, however, concern the vocabulary, as the Kalmyk language has been influenced by and has adopted words from the Russian language and various [[Turkic languages]].

Two important features that characterise Kalmyk are [[agglutination]] and [[vowel harmony]]. In an [[agglutinative language]], words are formed by added [[suffixes]] to existing [[word]]s, called stem words or root words. [[Prefixes]], however, are not common in Mongolic. Vowel harmony refers to the agreement between the vowels in the root of a word and the vowels in the word's suffix or suffixes. Other features include the absence of [[grammatical gender]] (with its distinctions of masculine, feminine, and neuter).

It has some elements in common with the [[Ugric languages|Uralic]] and [[Turkic languages|Uyghur]] languages, which reflects its origin from the common language of the Oirats, a union of four Oirat tribes that absorbed some Ugric and Turkic tribes during their expansion westward.

==Writing systems==
The literary tradition of Oirat reaches back to 11th century when the [[Old Uyghur alphabet|Old Uyghur script]] was used. The official Kalmyk alphabet, named [[Clear Script]] or, in Oirat, ''Todo bicig'', was created in the 17th century by a Kalmyk Buddhist monk called [[Zaya Pandita]]. In 1924 this script was replaced by a [[Cyrillic script]], which was abandoned in 1930 in favour of a [[Latin script]]. The Latin script was in turn replaced by another Cyrillic script in 1938. These script reforms effectively disrupted the Oirat literary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20120717012018/http://www6.gencat.net/llengcat/noves/hm01hivern-primavera/internacional/kornou4_9.htm#3#3&lt;/ref&gt;

The modified Cyrillic alphabet used for the Kalmyk language is as follows:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="78199">The hypothesis of '''linguistic relativity''' holds that the structure of a [[language]] affects its speakers' [[world view]] or [[cognition]]. Also known as the '''Sapir–Whorf hypothesis''', or '''Whorfianism''', the principle is often defined to include two versions: the ''strong hypothesis'' and the ''weak hypothesis'':
*The ''strong'' version says that language ''determines'' thought and that linguistic categories limit and determine cognitive categories.
*The ''weak'' version says that linguistic categories and usage only ''influence'' thought and decisions.

The term "Sapir–Whorf hypothesis" is considered a misnomer by linguists for several reasons: [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]] never co-authored any works, and never stated their ideas in terms of a hypothesis. The distinction between a weak and a strong version of this hypothesis is also a later invention; Sapir and Whorf never set up such a dichotomy, although often in their writings their views of this relativity principle are phrased in stronger or weaker terms.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Mannheim (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennison |first=Shelia |year=2013 |title=Introduction to language development |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Sage }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea was first clearly expressed by 19th-century thinkers, such as [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], who saw language as the expression of the spirit of a nation. Members of the early 20th-century school of American anthropology headed by [[Franz Boas]] and Edward Sapir also embraced forms of the idea to one degree or another, including in a 1928 meeting of the Linguistic Society of America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koerner|first1=E. F. Konrad|title=The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis: A Preliminary History and a Bibliographical Essay|journal=Journal of Linguistic Anthropology|date=December 1992|volume=2|issue=2|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Sapir in particular wrote more often against than in favor of anything like [[linguistic determinism]]. Sapir's student, Benjamin Lee Whorf, came to be seen as the primary proponent as a result of his published observations of how he perceived linguistic differences to have consequences in human cognition and behavior. [[Harry Hoijer]], another of Sapir's students, introduced the term "Sapir–Whorf hypothesis",&lt;ref&gt;"The Sapir–Whorf hypothesis", in Hoijer 1954:92–105&lt;/ref&gt; even though the two scholars never formally advanced any such hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;This usage is now generally seen as a misnomer. As Jane Hill and Bruce Mannheim write: Yet, just as the Holy Roman Empire was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire the "Sapir–Whorf Hypothesis" is neither consistent with the writings of Sapir and Whorf, nor a hypothesis (Hill &amp; Mannheim 1992, p386)&lt;/ref&gt; A strong version of relativist theory was developed from the late 1920s by the German linguist [[Leo Weisgerber]]. Whorf's principle of linguistic relativity was reformulated as a testable hypothesis by [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] and [[Eric Lenneberg]] who conducted experiments designed to find out whether [[color perception]] varies between speakers of languages that classified colors differently. As the study of the universal nature of human language and cognition came into focus in the 1960s the idea of linguistic relativity fell out of favor among linguists. A 1969 study by [[Brent Berlin]] and [[Paul Kay]] demonstrated the existence of universal semantic constraints in the field of colour terminology which were widely seen to discredit the existence of linguistic relativity in this domain, although this conclusion has been disputed by relativist researchers.

From the late 1980s, a new school of linguistic relativity scholars has examined the effects of differences in linguistic categorization on cognition, finding broad support for non-deterministic versions of the hypothesis in experimental contexts.&lt;ref name="Koerner"&gt;Koerner, E.F.K."Towards a full pedigree of the Sapir–Whorf Hypothesis: from Locke to Lucy" Chapter in {{harvcoltxt|Pütz|Verspoor|2000|p=17}}"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wolf|Holmes|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some effects of linguistic relativity have been shown in several semantic domains, although they are generally weak. Currently, a balanced view of linguistic relativity is espoused by most linguists holding that language influences certain kinds of cognitive processes in non-trivial ways, but that other processes are better seen as arising from [[Connectionism|connectionist]] factors. Research is focused on exploring the ways and extent to which language influences thought.&lt;ref name="Koerner" /&gt; The principle of linguistic relativity and the relation between language and thought has also received attention in varying academic fields from [[philosophy]] to [[psychology]] and [[anthropology]], and it has also inspired and coloured works of fiction and the invention of [[constructed language]]s.

== Forms ==

=== Linguistic determinism ===
{{Main|Linguistic determinism}}

The strongest form of the theory is linguistic determinism, which holds that language entirely determines the range of cognitive processes. The hypothesis of linguistic determinism is now generally agreed to be false.{{sfn|Ahearn|2011|page=69}}

=== Linguistic influence ===

This is the weaker form, proposing that language provides constraints in some areas of cognition, but that it is by no means determinative. Research on weaker forms has produced positive [[empirical evidence]] for a relationship.{{sfn|Ahearn|2011|page=69}}

== History ==

The idea that language and thought are intertwined is ancient. [[Plato]] argued against [[sophist]] thinkers such as [[Gorgias of Leontini]], who held that the physical world cannot be experienced except through language; this made the question of truth dependent on aesthetic preferences or functional consequences. Plato held instead that the world consisted of eternal ideas and that language should reflect these ideas as accurately as possible.&lt;ref name="McComiskey2002"&gt;{{cite book|first=Bruce |last=McComiskey|title=Gorgias and the New Sophistic Rhetoric|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=s3T6LYkGOqUC}}|year=2002|publisher=SIU Press|isbn=978-0-8093-2397-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Plato, [[St. Augustine]], for example, held the view that language was merely labels applied to already existing concepts. This view remained prevalent throughout the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Gumperz|Levinson|1996|p=2}} [[Roger Bacon]] held the opinion that language was but a veil covering up eternal truths, hiding them from human experience. For [[Immanuel Kant]], language was but one of several tools used by humans to experience the world.

=== German Romantic philosophers ===

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the idea of the existence of different national characters, or "''Volksgeister''", of different ethnic groups was the moving force behind the German romantics school and the beginning ideologies of ethnic nationalism.

Although himself a Swede, [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] inspired several of the German Romantics. As early as 1749, he alludes to something along the lines of linguistic relativity in commenting on a passage in the table of nations in the book of Genesis: {{quote|"Everyone according to his language, according to their families, as to their nations."[Genesis 10:5] This signifies that these were according to the genius of each;  "according to their language," according to the opinion of each.... "Language," in its inner meaning, signifies opinion, thus principles and persuasions. This is because there is a correspondence of the language with the intellectual part of man, or with his thought, like that of an effect with its cause.&lt;ref&gt; ''Arcana Coelestia'' section 1059. http://smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ac&amp;section=1059. &lt;/ref&gt;}} In 1771 he spelled this out more explicitly: {{quote|There is a common genius prevailing among those who are subject to one king, and who consequently are under one constitutional law. Germany is divided into more governments than the neighboring kingdoms.... However, a common genius prevails everywhere among people speaking the same language.&lt;ref&gt; ''True Christian Religion'' section 813. http://smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=tcr&amp;section=813. &lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:WilhelmvonHumboldt.jpg|thumb|[[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]]]
[[Johann Georg Hamann]] is often suggested to be the first among the actual German Romantics to speak of the concept of "the genius of a language."&lt;ref&gt; Robert L. Miller ''The Linguistic Relativity Principle and Humboldtian Ethnolinguistics'' p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Christina McAfee "The Linguistic Relativity Theory and Benjamin Lee Whorf," ''The McMaster Journal of Communication'' Vol. 1(2004).&lt;/ref&gt; In his "Essay Concerning an Academic Question," Hamann suggests that a people's language affects their worldview:
{{quote|The lineaments of their language will thus correspond to the direction of their mentality.&lt;ref&gt; Quoted in Bernard D. Den Ouden, ''Language and Creativity: An Interdisciplinary Essay in Chomskyan Humanism,'' p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In 1820, [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] connected the study of language to the national romanticist program by proposing the view that language is the fabric of thought. Thoughts are produced as a kind of internal dialog using the same grammar as the thinker's native language.&lt;ref name="Trabant"&gt;Trabant, Jürgen."How relativistic are Humboldts "Weltansichten"?" in {{harvnb|Pütz|Verspoor|2000|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was part of a larger picture in which the world view of an ethnic nation, their "[[world view|Weltanschauung]]", was seen as being faithfully reflected in the grammar of their language. Von Humboldt argued that languages with an [[inflection]]al [[Morphological typology|morphological type]], such as German, English and the other [[Indo-European languages]], were the most perfect languages and that accordingly this explained the dominance of their speakers over the speakers of less perfect languages. Wilhelm von Humboldt declared in 1820:

{{quote|The diversity of languages is not a diversity of signs and sounds but a diversity of views of the world.&lt;ref name="Trabant" /&gt;}}

=== Boas and Sapir ===

[[File:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|[[Franz Boas]]]]

The idea that some languages are superior to others and that lesser languages maintained their speakers in intellectual poverty was widespread in the early 20th century. American linguist [[William Dwight Whitney]], for example, actively strove to eradicate [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]], arguing that their speakers were savages and would be better off learning English and adopting a "civilized" way of life.{{sfn|Seuren|1998|p=180}} The first anthropologist and linguist to challenge this view was [[Franz Boas]].{{sfn|Seuren|1998|p=181}} While undertaking geographical research in northern Canada he became fascinated with the [[Inuit]] people and decided to become an [[Ethnography|ethnographer]]. Boas stressed the equal worth of all cultures and languages, that there was no such thing as a primitive language and that all languages were capable of expressing the same content, albeit by widely differing means. Boas saw language as an inseparable part of culture and he was among the first to require of ethnographers to learn the native language of the culture under study and to document verbal culture such as [[myth]]s and legends in the original language.

Boas:

{{quote|It does not seem likely [...] that there is any direct relation between the culture of a tribe and the language they speak, except in so far as the form of the language will be moulded by the state of the culture, but not in so far as a certain state of the culture is conditioned by the morphological traits of the language."&lt;ref name="BOAS1911"&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=EnZC68mmRhQC}}|last=Boas |first=Franz|year=1911|title=Handbook of American Indian languages|volume=1|publisher=Bureau of American Ethnology, Bulletin 40. Washington: Government Print Office (Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology).}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Boas' student Edward Sapir reached back to the Humboldtian idea that languages contained the key to understanding the world views of peoples. He espoused the viewpoint that because of the differences in the grammatical systems of languages no two languages were similar enough to allow for perfect cross-translation. Sapir also thought because language represented reality differently, it followed that the speakers of different languages would perceive reality differently.

Sapir:

{{quote|No two languages are ever sufficiently similar to be considered as representing the same social reality. The worlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds, not merely the same world with different labels attached.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Sapir |first=Edward|year=1929|title= The status of linguistics as a science|journal=Language|volume=5|doi=10.2307/409588|issue=4|page=207|jstor=409588}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the other hand, Sapir explicitly rejected strong [[linguistic determinism]] by stating, "It would be naïve to imagine that any analysis of experience is dependent on pattern expressed in language."&lt;ref name="SapirSwadesh1946"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Edward |last1=Sapir|first2=Morris |last2=Swadesh |authorlink1=Morris Swadesh|title=American Indian Grammatical Categories|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=wSYJMgEACAAJ|page=100}}|year=1946 |pp=100–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sapir was explicit that the connections between language and culture were neither thoroughgoing nor particularly deep, if they existed at all:

{{quote|It is easy to show that language and culture are not intrinsically associated. Totally unrelated languages share in one culture; closely related languages—even a single language—belong to distinct culture spheres. There are many excellent examples in Aboriginal America. The Athabaskan languages form as clearly unified, as structurally specialized, a group as any that I know of. The speakers of these languages belong to four distinct culture areas... The cultural adaptability of the Athabaskan-speaking peoples is in the strangest contrast to the inaccessibility to foreign influences of the languages themselves.{{sfn|Sapir|1921|p=213–4}}}}

Sapir offered similar observations about speakers of so-called "world" or [[modern language|"modern" languages]], noting, "possession of a common language is still and will continue to be a smoother of the way to a mutual understanding between England and America, but it is very clear that other factors, some of them rapidly cumulative, are working powerfully to counteract this leveling influence. A common language cannot indefinitely set the seal on a common culture when the geographical, physical, and economics determinants of the culture are no longer the same throughout the area."{{sfn|Sapir|1921|p=215}}

While Sapir never made a point of studying directly how languages affected thought, some notion of (probably "weak") linguistic relativity underlay his basic understanding of language, and would be taken up by Whorf.

Drawing on influences such as Humboldt and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], some European thinkers developed ideas similar to those of Sapir and Whorf, generally working in isolation from each other. Prominent in Germany from the late 1920s through into the 1960s were the strongly relativist theories of [[Leo Weisgerber]] and his key concept of a 'linguistic inter-world', mediating between external reality and the forms of a given language, in ways peculiar to that language.&lt;ref&gt;For a critique of Weisgerber, see, for example: Beat Lehmann (1998), ''ROT ist nicht ″rot″ ist nicht [rot]. Eine Bilanz und Neuinterpretation der linguistischen Relativitätstheorie''. Gunter Narr, Tübingen. pp. 58–80; Iwar Werlen (2002), 'Das Worten der Welt', in: ''Lexikologie ... Ein internationales Handbuch'', ed. by D. Alan Cruse et al., Walter de Gruyter, Berlin &amp; New York, 1. pp. 380–391.&lt;/ref&gt; Russian psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]] read Sapir's work and experimentally studied the ways in which the development of concepts in children was influenced by structures given in language. His 1934 work "''Thought and Language''"&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky, L. (1934/1986). Thought and language. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; has been compared to Whorf's and taken as mutually supportive evidence of language's influence on cognition.{{sfn|Lucy|Wertsch|1987}} Drawing on Nietzsche's ideas of perspectivism [[Alfred Korzybski]] developed the theory of [[general semantics]] that has been compared to Whorf's notions of linguistic relativity.{{sfn|Pula|1992}} Though influential in their own right, this work has not been influential in the debate on linguistic relativity, which has tended to center on the American paradigm exemplified by Sapir and Whorf.

=== Benjamin Lee Whorf ===
{{Main|Benjamin Lee Whorf}}

More than any linguist, Benjamin Lee Whorf has become associated with what he called the "linguistic relativity principle".{{sfn|Whorf|1956|p=214}} Studying [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] languages, he attempted to account for the ways in which grammatical systems and language use differences affected perception. Whorf also examined how a scientific account of the world differed from a religious account, which led him to study the original languages of religious scripture and to write several anti-[[evolution]]ist pamphlets.{{sfn|Whorf|1956}} Whorf's opinions regarding the nature of the relation between language and thought remain under contention. Critics such as Lenneberg, [[Max Black|Black]] and [[Steven Pinker|Pinker]] attribute to Whorf a strong linguistic determinism, while [[John A. Lucy|Lucy]], [[Michael Silverstein|Silverstein]] and [[Stephen C. Levinson|Levinson]] point to Whorf's explicit rejections of determinism, and where he contends that translation and commensuration is possible.

Although Whorf lacked an advanced degree in linguistics, his reputation reflects his acquired competence. His peers at [[Yale University]] considered the 'amateur' Whorf to be the best man available to take over Sapir's graduate seminar in Native American linguistics while Sapir was on sabbatical in 1937–38.{{sfn|Darnell|1990|p=380-81}} He was highly regarded by authorities such as Boas, Sapir, [[Leonard Bloomfield|Bloomfield]] and [[Alfred M. Tozzer|Tozzer]]. Indeed, [[John A. Lucy|Lucy]] wrote, "despite his 'amateur' status, Whorf's work in linguistics was and still is recognized as being of superb professional quality by linguists".{{sfn|Lucy|1992b|p=25}}

Detractors such as Lenneberg, [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] and [[Steven Pinker|Pinker]] criticized him for insufficient clarity in his description of how language influences thought, and for not proving his conjectures. Most of his arguments were in the form of anecdotes and speculations that served as attempts to show how 'exotic' grammatical traits were connected to what were apparently equally exotic worlds of thought. In Whorf's words:

{{quote|We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native language. The categories and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do not find there because they stare every observer in the face; on the contrary, the world is presented in a kaleidoscope flux of impressions which has to be organized by our minds—and this means largely by the linguistic systems of our minds. We cut nature up, organize it into concepts, and ascribe significances as we do, largely because we are parties to an agreement to organize it in this way—an agreement that holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns of our language [...] all observers are not led by the same physical evidence to the same picture of the universe, unless their linguistic backgrounds are similar, or can in some way be calibrated.{{sfn|Whorf|1956|p=212–214}}}}

[[File:Whorf Shawnee Example.png|400px|thumb|Whorf's illustration of the difference between the English and Shawnee gestalt construction of cleaning a gun with a ramrod. From the article "Science and Linguistics", originally published in the ''MIT Technology Review'', 1940.]]

Among Whorf's best-known examples of linguistic relativity are instances where an indigenous language has several terms for a concept that is only described with one word in European languages (Whorf used the acronym SAE "[[Standard Average European]]" to allude to the rather similar grammatical structures of the well-studied European languages in contrast to the greater diversity of less-studied languages).

One of Whorf's examples was the supposedly large number of words for [[Eskimo words for snow|'snow' in the Inuit language]], an example which later was contested as a misrepresentation.{{sfn|Pullum|1991}}

Another is the [[Hopi language]]'s words for water, one indicating drinking water in a container and another indicating a natural body of water. These examples of [[polysemy]] served the double purpose of showing that indigenous languages sometimes made more fine grained semantic distinctions than European languages and that direct translation between two languages, even of seemingly basic concepts such as snow or water, is not always possible.

Another example is from Whorf's experience as a chemical engineer working for an insurance company as a fire inspector.{{sfn|Pullum|1991}} While inspecting a chemical plant he observed that the plant had two storage rooms for gasoline barrels, one for the full barrels and one for the empty ones. He further noticed that while no employees smoked cigarettes in the room for full barrels, no-one minded smoking in the room with empty barrels, although this was potentially much more dangerous because of the highly flammable vapors still in the barrels. He concluded that the use of the word ''empty'' in connection to the barrels had led the workers to unconsciously regard them as harmless, although consciously they were probably aware of the risk of explosion. This example was later criticized by Lenneberg{{sfn|Lenneberg|1953}} as not actually demonstrating causality between the use of the word ''empty'' and the action of smoking, but instead was an example of [[circular reasoning]]. Pinker in ''[[The Language Instinct]]'' ridiculed this example, claiming that this was a failing of human insight rather than language.

Whorf's most elaborate argument for linguistic relativity regarded what he believed to be a fundamental difference in the understanding of [[Hopi time controversy|time as a conceptual category among the Hopi]].{{sfn|Whorf|1956}} He argued that in contrast to English and other [[Standard Average European|SAE languages]], Hopi does not treat the flow of time as a sequence of distinct, countable instances, like "three days" or "five years," but rather as a single process and that consequently it has no nouns referring to units of time as SAE speakers understand them. He proposed that this view of time was fundamental to [[Hopi]] culture and explained certain Hopi behavioral patterns. Malotki later claimed that he had found no evidence of Whorf's claims in 1980's era speakers, nor in historical documents dating back to the arrival of Europeans. Malotki used evidence from archaeological data, calendars, historical documents, modern speech and concluded that there was no evidence that Hopi conceptualize time in the way Whorf suggested. Universalist scholars such as Pinker often see Malotki's study as a final refutation of Whorf's claim about Hopi, whereas relativist scholars such as [[John A Lucy|Lucy]] and Penny Lee criticized Malotki's study for mischaracterizing Whorf's claims and for forcing Hopi grammar into a model of analysis that doesn't fit the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1996}} {{harvnb|Lee|1996}} {{harvnb|Leavitt|2011|pp=179–187}} {{harvnb|Lucy|1992b|p=286}} {{harvnb|Lucy|1996|p=43}} {{harvnb|Dinwoodie|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whorf died in 1941 at age 44, leaving multiple unpublished papers. His line of thought was continued by linguists and anthropologists such as Hoijer and [[Dorothy D. Lee|Lee]] who both continued investigations into the effect of language on habitual thought, and [[George L. Trager|Trager]], who prepared a number of Whorf's papers for posthumous publishing. The most important event for the dissemination of Whorf's ideas to a larger public was the publication in 1956 of his major writings on the topic of linguistic relativity in a single volume titled ''Language, Thought and Reality''.

=== Eric Lenneberg ===

In 1953, [[Eric Lenneberg]] criticised Whorf's examples from an objectivist view of language holding that languages are principally meant to represent events in the real world and that even though languages express these ideas in various ways, the meanings of such expressions and therefore the thoughts of the speaker are equivalent. He argued that Whorf's English descriptions of a Hopi speaker's view of time were in fact translations of the Hopi concept into English, therefore disproving linguistic relativity. However Whorf was concerned with how the habitual ''use'' of language influences habitual behavior, rather than translatability. Whorf's point was that while English speakers may be able to ''understand'' how a Hopi speaker thinks, they do not ''think'' in that way.{{sfn|Lakoff|1987|p=}}

Lenneberg's main criticism of Whorf's works was that he never showed the connection between a linguistic phenomenon and a mental phenomenon. With Brown, Lenneberg proposed that proving such a connection required directly matching linguistic phenomena with behavior. They assessed linguistic relativity experimentally and published their findings in 1954.

Since neither Sapir nor Whorf had ever stated a formal hypothesis, Brown and Lenneberg formulated their own. Their two tenets were (i) "the world is differently experienced and conceived in different linguistic communities" and (ii) "language causes a particular cognitive structure".{{sfn|Brown|Lenneberg|1954|p=455,457}} Brown later developed them into the so-called "weak" and "strong" formulation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Structural differences between language systems will, in general, be paralleled by nonlinguistic cognitive differences, of an unspecified sort, in the native speakers of the language.
* The structure of anyone's native language strongly influences or fully determines the worldview he will acquire as he learns the language.{{sfn|Brown|1976|p=128}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Brown's formulations became widely known and were retrospectively attributed to Whorf and Sapir although the second formulation, verging on linguistic determinism, was never advanced by either of them.

Since Brown and Lenneberg believed that the objective reality denoted by language was the same for speakers of all languages, they decided to test how different languages codified the same message differently and whether differences in codification could be proven to affect behavior.

They designed experiments involving the codification of colors. In their first experiment, they investigated whether it was easier for speakers of English to remember color shades for which they had a specific name than to remember colors that were not as easily definable by words. This allowed them to compare the linguistic categorization directly to a non-linguistic task. In a later experiment, speakers of two languages that categorize colors differently ([[English language|English]] and [[Zuni language|Zuni]]) were asked to recognize colors. In this way, it could be determined whether the differing color categories of the two speakers would determine their ability to recognize nuances within color categories. Brown and Lenneberg found that Zuñi speakers who [[Distinguishing blue from green in language|classify green and blue together]] as a single color did have trouble recognizing and remembering nuances within the green/blue category.{{sfn|D'Andrade|1995|p= 185}} Brown and Lenneberg's study began a tradition of investigation of linguistic relativity through color terminology.

=== Universalist period ===
{{Main|Universalism |Universalism and relativism of color terminology}}

Lenneberg was also one of the first cognitive scientists to begin development of the Universalist theory of language that was formulated by Chomsky in the form of [[Universal Grammar]], effectively arguing that all languages share the same underlying structure. The Chomskyan school also holds the belief that linguistic structures are largely innate and that what are perceived as differences between specific languages are surface phenomena that do not affect the brain's universal cognitive processes. This theory became the dominant paradigm in American linguistics from the 1960s through the 1980s, while linguistic relativity became the object of ridicule.{{sfn|Gumperz|Levinson|1996|p=3, 6}}

Examples of universalist influence in the 1960s are the studies by [[Brent Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Paul Kay|Kay]] who continued Lenneberg's color research. They studied color terminology formation and showed clear universal trends in color naming. For example, they found that even though languages have different color terminologies, they generally recognize certain hues as more focal than others. They showed that in languages with few color terms, it is predictable from the number of terms which hues are chosen as focal colors, for example, languages with only three color terms always have the focal colors black, white and red.{{sfn|Berlin|Kay|1969}} The fact that what had been believed to be random differences between color naming in different languages could be shown to follow universal patterns was seen as a powerful argument against linguistic relativity.{{sfn|Gumperz|Levinson|1996|p=6}} Berlin and Kay's research has since been criticized by relativists such as Lucy, who argued that Berlin and Kay's conclusions were skewed by their insistence that color terms encode only color information.{{sfn|Lucy|1992a}} This, Lucy argues, made them blind to the instances in which color terms provided other information that might be considered examples of linguistic relativity.

Other universalist researchers dedicated themselves to dispelling other aspects of linguistic relativity, often attacking Whorf's specific points and examples. For example, Malotki's monumental study of time expressions in Hopi presented many examples that challenged Whorf's "timeless" interpretation of Hopi language and culture.{{sfn|Malotki|1983}}

Today many followers of the universalist school of thought still oppose linguistic relativity. For example, Pinker argues in ''The Language Instinct'' that thought is independent of language, that language is itself meaningless in any fundamental way to human thought, and that human beings do not even think in "natural" language, i.e. any language that we actually communicate in; rather, we think in a meta-language, preceding any natural language, called "mentalese." Pinker attacks what he calls "Whorf's radical position," declaring, "the more you examine Whorf's arguments, the less sense they make."{{sfn|Pinker|1994|p=60}}

Pinker and other universalists have been accused by relativists of misrepresenting Whorf's views and arguing against [[Strawman fallacy|strawmen]].{{sfn|Casasanto|2008|p=}}{{sfn|Lucy|1992a|p=}}{{sfn|Lakoff|1987|p=}}

=== Joshua Fishman's "Whorfianism of the third kind" ===

[[Joshua Aaron Fishman|Joshua Fishman]] argued that Whorf's true position was largely overlooked. In 1978, he suggested that Whorf was a "neo-[[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herderian]] champion"{{sfn|Fishman|1978}} and in 1982, he proposed "Whorfianism of the third kind" in an attempt to refocus linguists' attention on what he claimed was Whorf's real interest, namely the intrinsic value of "little peoples" and "little languages".{{sfn|Fishman|1982|p=5}} Whorf had criticized [[Charles Kay Ogden|Ogden]]'s [[Basic English]] thus:

{{quote|But to restrict thinking to the patterns merely of English […] is to lose a power of thought which, once lost, can never be regained. It is the 'plainest' English which contains the greatest number of unconscious assumptions about nature. […] We handle even our plain English with much greater effect if we direct it from the vantage point of a multilingual awareness.{{sfn|Whorf|1956|p=244}}}}

Where Brown's weak version of the linguistic relativity hypothesis proposes that language ''influences'' thought and the strong version that language ''determines'' thought, Fishman's 'Whorfianism of the third kind' proposes that language ''is a key to culture''.

=== Cognitive linguistics ===

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, advances in [[cognitive psychology]] and [[cognitive linguistics]] renewed interest in the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis.{{sfn|Seidner|1982}} One of those who adopted a more Whorfian approach was [[George Lakoff]]. He argued that language is often used metaphorically and that languages use different [[conceptual metaphor|cultural metaphors]] that reveal something about how speakers of that language think. For example, English employs conceptual metaphors likening time with money, so that time can be saved and spent and invested, whereas other languages do not talk about time in that way. Other such metaphors are common to many languages because they are based on general human experience, for example, metaphors likening ''up'' with ''good'' and ''bad'' with ''down''. Lakoff also argued that metaphor plays an important part in political debates such as the "right to life" or the "right to choose"; or "illegal aliens" or "undocumented workers".

==== Parameters ====
In his book ''Women, Fire and Dangerous things: What categories reveal about the mind,''{{sfn|Lakoff|1987}} Lakoff reappraised linguistic relativity and especially Whorf's views about how linguistic categorization reflects and/or influences mental categories. He concluded that the debate had been confused. He described four parameters on which researchers differed in their opinions about what constitutes linguistic relativity:
* The degree and depth of linguistic relativity. Perhaps a few examples of superficial differences in language and associated behavior are enough to demonstrate the existence of linguistic relativity. Alternatively, perhaps only deep differences that permeate the linguistic and cultural system suffice.
* Whether conceptual systems are absolute or whether they can evolve
* Whether the similarity criterion is translatability or the use of linguistic expressions
* Whether the focus of linguistic relativity is in language or in the brain
Lakoff concluded that many of Whorf's critics had criticized him using novel definitions of linguistic relativity, rendering their criticisms moot.

==== ''Rethinking Linguistic Relativity'' ====
The publication of the 1996 anthology ''Rethinking Linguistic Relativity'' edited by [[John J. Gumperz|Gumperz]] and [[Stephen C. Levinson|Levinson]] began a new period of linguistic relativity studies that focused on cognitive and social aspects. The book included studies on the linguistic relativity and universalist traditions. Levinson documented significant linguistic relativity effects in the linguistic conceptualization of spatial categories between languages. Separate studies by [[Melissa Bowerman|Bowerman]] and [[Dan Slobin|Slobin]] treated the role of language in cognitive processes. Bowerman showed that certain cognitive processes did not use language to any significant extent and therefore could not be subject to linguistic relativity. Slobin described another kind of cognitive process that he named "thinking for speaking" – the kind of process in which perceptional data and other kinds of prelinguistic cognition are translated into linguistic terms for communication. These, Slobin argues, are the kinds of cognitive process that are at the root of linguistic relativity.

=== Refinements ===

Researchers such as [[Lera Boroditsky|Boroditsky]], Lucy and Levinson believe that language influences thought in more limited ways than the broadest early claims. Researchers examine the interface between thought (or cognition), language and culture and describe the relevant influences. They use experimental data to back up their conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gentner|first1=Dedre|last2=Boroditsky|first2=Lera|editor=Melissa Bowerman and Stephen Levinson|title=Language Acquisition and Conceptual Development|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-59659-6|pages=215–256|chapter=Individuation, relativity, and early word development}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levinson2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Levinson|first=Stephen|editor=Melissa Bowerman and Stephen Levinson|title=Language Acquisition and Conceptual Development|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-59659-6|pages=566–588|chapter=Covariation between spatial language and cognition, and its implications for language learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kay ultimately concluded that "[the] Whorf hypothesis is supported in the right visual field but not the left".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Empirical research ==

Lucy identified three main strands of research into linguistic relativity.{{sfn|Lucy|1997}}

=== Structure-centered ===
The "structure-centered" approach starts with a language's structural peculiarity and examines its possible ramifications for thought and behavior. The defining example is Whorf's observation of discrepancies between the grammar of time expressions in Hopi and English. More recent research in this vein is Lucy's research describing how usage of the categories of grammatical number and of numeral classifiers in the [[Mayan languages|Mayan language]] [[Yucatec Maya|Yucatec]] result in Mayan speakers classifying objects according to material rather than to shape as preferred by English speakers.{{sfn|Lucy|1992b|p=}}

=== Domain-centered ===
The "domain-centered" approach selects a semantic domain and compares it across linguistic and cultural groups. It centered on color terminology, although this domain is acknowledged to be sub-optimal, because color perception, unlike other semantic domains, is hardwired into the neural system and as such is subject to more universal restrictions than other semantic domains.

Space is another semantic domain that has proven fruitful for linguistic relativity studies.{{sfn|Lucy|1997|p=301}} Spatial categories vary greatly across languages. Speakers rely on the linguistic conceptualization of space in performing many ordinary tasks. Levinson and others reported three basic spatial categorizations. While many languages use combinations of them, some languages exhibit only one type and related behaviors. For example, [[Guugu Yimithirr language|Yimithirr]] only uses absolute directions when describing spatial relations&amp;nbsp;— the position of everything is described by using the cardinal directions. Speakers define a location as "north of the house", while an English speaker may use relative positions, saying "in front of the house" or "to the left of the house".{{sfn|Levinson|1996}}

=== Behavior-centered ===
The "behavior centered" approach starts by comparing behavior across linguistic groups and then searches for causes for that behavior in the linguistic system. Whorf attributed the occurrence of fires at a chemical plant to the workers' use of the word 'empty' to describe the barrels containing only explosive vapors. Bloom noticed that speakers of Chinese had unexpected difficulties answering counter-factual questions posed to them in a questionnaire. He concluded that this was related to the way in which counter-factuality is marked grammatically in Chinese. Other researchers attributed this result to Bloom's flawed translations.&lt;ref&gt;Au, Terry K, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001002778490012X "Counterfactuals: In Reply to Alfred Bloom"], ''Cognition'', 17 (3), 1984:&lt;/ref&gt; Strømnes examined why Finnish factories had a higher occurrence of work related accidents than similar Swedish ones. He concluded that cognitive differences between the grammatical usage of Swedish [[prepositions]] and Finnish [[Case (linguistics)|cases]] could have caused Swedish factories to pay more attention to the work process while Finnish factory organizers paid more attention to the individual worker.{{sfn|Lucy|1997|p=304}}

Recent research with non-linguistic experiments in languages with different grammatical properties (e.g., languages with and without [[chinese classifier|numeral classifiers]] or with different gender grammar systems) showed that language differences in human categorization are due to such differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kou | first1 = J.

A study published by the [[American Psychological Association]]’s [[Journal of Experimental Psychology]] claimed that language can influence how you estimate time. The study focused on three groups, those who spoke only Swedish, those who spoke only Spanish and bilingual speakers who spoke both of those languages. Swedish speakers describe time using distance terms like "long" or "short" while Spanish speakers do it using volume related terms like "big" or "small". The researchers asked the participants to estimate how much time had passed while watching a line growing across a screen, or a container being filled, or both. The researches stated that "When reproducing duration, Swedish speakers were misled by stimulus length, and Spanish speakers were misled by stimulus size/quantity." When the bilinguals where prompted with the word “duración” (the Spanish word for duration) they based their time estimates of how full the containers were, ignoring the growing lines. When prompted with the word “tid” (the Swedish word for duration) they estimated the time elapsed solely by the distance the lines had traveled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/2017/05/your-perception-of-time-may-depend-on-the-language-you-speak/ |title=Your perception of time may depend on the language you speak |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pierre |first=Kendra |url=http://www.popsci.com/language-time-perception#page-3 |title=The language you speak changes your perception of time |publisher=Popsci.com |date=2017-05-09 |accessdate=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Color terminology ===
{{Main|Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate}}

Research continued after Lenneberg/Roberts and Brown/Lenneberg. The studies showed a correlation between color term numbers and ease of recall in both Zuni and English speakers. Researchers attributed this to focal colors having higher codability than less focal colors, and not with linguistic relativity effects. Berlin/Kay found universal typological color principles that are determined by biological rather than linguistic factors.{{sfn|Berlin|Kay|1969}} This study sparked studies into typological universals of color terminology. Researchers such as Lucy,&lt;ref&gt;Lucy, J. A. (1997). The linguistics of "color". In C.L. Hardin &amp; L. Maffi (Eds.), Color categories in thought and language (pp. 320–436). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Saunders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saunders | first1 = Barbara | year = 2000 | title = Revisiting Basic Color Terms | url = | journal = Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 81–99 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Levinson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages=3–55|doi=10.1525/jlin.2000.10.1.3|title=Yeli Dnye and the Theory of Basic Color Terms|journal=Journal of Linguistic Anthropology|volume=10|year=2000|last1=Levinson|first1=Stephen C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that Berlin and Kay's study does not refute linguistic relativity in color naming, because of unsupported assumptions in their study (such as whether all cultures in fact have a clearly-defined category of "color") and because of related data problems. Researchers such as Maclaury continued investigation into color naming. Like Berlin and Kay, Maclaury concluded that the domain is governed mostly by physical-biological universals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Other domains ==

Linguistic relativity inspired others to consider whether thought could be influenced by manipulating language.

=== Science and philosophy ===

The question bears on philosophical, psychological, linguistic and anthropological questions.{{clarify|reason=what question?|date=May 2017}}

A major question is whether human psychological faculties are mostly innate or whether they are mostly a result of learning, and hence subject to cultural and social processes such as language. The innate view holds that humans share the same set of basic faculties, and that variability due to cultural differences is less important and that the human mind is a mostly biological construction, so that all humans sharing the same neurological configuration can be expected to have similar cognitive patterns.

Multiple alternatives have advocates. The contrary [[Social constructivism|constructivist]] position holds that human faculties and concepts are largely influenced by socially constructed and learned categories, without many biological restrictions. Another variant is [[idealist]], which holds that human mental capacities are generally unrestricted by biological-material strictures. Another is [[essentialism|essentialist]], which holds that essential differences{{clarify|reason=what essential differences|date=May 2017}} may influence the ways individuals or groups experience and conceptualize the world. Yet another is [[relativist]] ([[Cultural relativism]]), which sees different cultural groups as employing different conceptual schemes that are not necessarily compatible or commensurable, nor more or less in accord with external reality.{{sfn|Leavitt|2011}}

Another debate considers whether thought is a form of internal speech or is independent of and prior to language.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In the [[philosophy of language]] the question addresses the relations between language, knowledge and the external world, and the concept of [[truth]]. Philosophers such as [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]], [[Jerry Fodor|Fodor]], Davidson, and [[Daniel Dennett|Dennett]] see language as representing directly entities from the objective world and that categorization reflect that world. Other philosophers (e.g. Wittgenstein, [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], Searle, [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]) argue that categorization and conceptualization is subjective and arbitrary.

Another question is whether language is a tool for representing and referring to objects in the world, or whether it is a system used to construct mental representations that can be communicated.{{clarify|reason=what is the relevance of this in the local context? Is this a true dichotomy?|date=May 2017}}

=== Therapy and self-development ===
{{Main|General semantics|Neurolinguistic Programming}}

Sapir/Whorf contemporary [[Alfred Korzybski]] was independently developing his theory of [[General Semantics|general semantics]], which was aimed at using language's influence on thinking to maximize human cognitive abilities. Korzybski's thinking was influenced by logical philosophy such as [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead's]] ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' and Wittgenstein's ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''.&lt;ref name="Korzybski1949"&gt;{{cite book|first=Alfred |last=Korzybski|title=Time-binding: The General Theory : Two Papers 1924–1926|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=3BvXAAAAMAAJ|page=5}}|year=1949|publisher=Institute of General Semantics|pages=(5), 54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Korzybski was not aware of Sapir and Whorf's writings, the movement was followed by Whorf-admirer Stuart Chase, who fused Whorf's interest in cultural-linguistic variation with Korzybski's programme in his popular work "''The Tyranny of Words''". [[S. I. Hayakawa]] was a follower and popularizer of Korzybski's work, writing ''[[Language in Thought and Action]]''. The general semantics movement influenced the development of [[neurolinguistic programming]], another therapeutic technique that seeks to use awareness of language use to influence cognitive patterns.&lt;ref name="lisawake"&gt;{{cite book|first=Lisa |last=Wake|title=Neurolinguistic Psychotherapy: A Postmodern Perspective|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=xmffzEo-qXIC}}|date=31 March 2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-09482-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korzybski independently described a "strong" version of the hypothesis of linguistic relativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.generalsemantics.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/articles/etc/40-1-read.pdf |doi= 10.5840/cpsem19828 |pages=101–107|title= "The Semiotic Aspect of Alfred Korzybski's General Semantics" |series= Semiotics |year= 1982 |last1= Read |first1= Allen Walker }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We do not realize what tremendous power the structure of an habitual language has. It is not an exaggeration to say that it enslaves us through the mechanism of s[emantic] r[eactions] and that the structure which a language exhibits, and impresses upon us unconsciously, is automatically projected upon the world around us.|Korzybski (1930) &lt;ref name="Korzybski1958"&gt;{{cite book|first=Alfred |last=Korzybski|title=Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=KN5gvaDwrGcC|p=90}}|year=1958|publisher=Institute of GS|isbn=978-0-937298-01-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Artificial languages ===
{{Main|Constructed languages|Experimental languages}}

In their fiction, authors such as [[Ayn Rand]] and [[George Orwell]] explored how linguistic relativity might be exploited for political purposes. In Rand's [[Anthem (novella)|''Anthem'']], a fictive [[communist]] society removed the possibility of individualism by removing the word "I" from the language.{{cn|date=October 2018}} In Orwell's ''[[1984 (book)|1984]]'' the authoritarian state created the language [[Newspeak]] to make it impossible for people to think critically about the government, or even to contemplate that they might be impoverished or oppressed, by reducing the number of words to reduce the thought of the locutor.{{sfn|Pinker|1994|loc=chap. 3}}

Others have been fascinated by the possibilities of creating new languages that could enable new, and perhaps better, ways of thinking. Examples of such languages designed to explore the human mind include [[Loglan]], explicitly designed by [[James Cooke Brown]] to test the linguistic relativity hypothesis, by experimenting whether it would make its speakers think more logically. Speakers of [[Lojban]], an evolution of Loglan, report that they feel speaking the language enhances their ability for logical thinking{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}. [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], who was involved in the early development of neurolinguistic programming, invented the language [[Láadan]] to explore linguistic relativity by making it easier to express what Elgin considered the female worldview, as opposed to [[Standard Average European]] languages which she considered to convey a "male centered" world view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author= Okrent, Arika |title = In the Land of Invented Languages: Esperanto Rock Stars, Klingon Poets, Loglan Lovers, and the Mad Dreamers Who Tried to Build A Perfect Language |publisher=Spiegel &amp; Grau |year=2009 |pages=208–257|isbn= 0-385-52788-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Quijada's language [[Ithkuil]] was designed to explore the limits of the number of cognitive categories a language can keep its speakers aware of at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Foer|first=Joshua |title=UTOPIAN FOR BEGINNERS: An amateur linguist loses control of the language he invented|publisher=New York Times|date=December 24, 2012 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/12/24/121224fa_fact_foer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Sonja Lang's [[Toki Pona]] was developed according to a [[Taoism|Taoist]] point of view for exploring how (or if) such a language would direct human thought.&lt;ref&gt;''A Million Words and Counting: How Global English Is Rewriting the World'', Paul J. J. Payack, (C) 2007, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Programming languages ===

[[APL (programming language)|APL programming language]] originator [[Kenneth E. Iverson]] believed that the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis applied to computer languages (without actually mentioning it by name). His [[Turing award]] lecture, "Notation as a tool of thought", was devoted to this theme, arguing that more powerful notations aided thinking about computer algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://elliscave.com/APL_J/tool.pdf |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |volume=23 |issue=8 |pages=444–465 |date=August 1980 |doi=10.1145/358896.358899 |title=Notation as a tool of thought |last1=Iverson |first1=Kenneth E. |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710183418/http://elliscave.com/APL_J/tool.pdf |archivedate=10 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essays of [[Paul Graham (computer programmer)|Paul Graham]] explore similar themes, such as a conceptual hierarchy of computer languages, with more expressive and succinct languages at the top. Thus, the so-called [[Blub paradox|''blub'' paradox]] (after a hypothetical programming language of average complexity called ''Blub'') says that anyone preferentially using some particular programming language will ''know'' that it is more powerful than some, but not that it is less powerful than others. The reason is that ''writing'' in some language means ''thinking'' in that language. Hence the paradox, because typically programmers are "satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because it dictates the way they think about programs".{{sfn|Graham|2004}}

In a 2003 presentation at an [[Open-source software|open source]] convention, [[Yukihiro Matsumoto]], creator of the [[programming language]] [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], said that one of his inspirations for developing the language was the science fiction novel ''[[Babel-17]]'', based on the Sapir–Whorf Hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/slides/oscon2003/mgp00001.html|title=The Power and Philosophy of Ruby (or how to create Babel-17|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In popular culture ===

[[Ted Chiang]]'s short story ''[[Story of Your Life]]'' developed the concept of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis as applied to an alien species which visits Earth. The aliens' biology contributes to their spoken and written languages, which are distinct. In the 2016 American film [[Arrival (film)|''Arrival'']], based on Chiang's short story, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is the premise. The protagonist explains that "the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is the theory that the language you speak determines how you think".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The science behind the movie ‘Arrival’| work = Washington Post| accessdate = 2017-04-23| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/the-science-behind-the-movie-arrival/2016/11/14/5e344114-a6a7-11e6-ba59-a7d93165c6d4_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his science fiction novel ''[[The Languages of Pao]]'' the author [[Jack Vance]] describes how specialized languages are a major part of a strategy to create specific classes in a society, to enable the population to withstand occupation and develop itself.

[[File:BosWash-Night-Labeled.png|thumb|A satellite view of the U.S. [[Northeast megalopolis]], the most populous megalopolis in the [[Western Hemisphere]], home to over 50 million people, displayed at night.]]

A '''megalopolis''' (sometimes called a '''megapolis'''; also '''megaregion,''' or '''supercity''')&lt;ref name="Fielder76"/&gt; is typically defined as a chain of roughly adjacent [[metropolitan area]]s, which may be somewhat separated or may merge into a continuous urban region.

Emerging megalopolises in the developing world include the [[Pearl River Delta]], which when formed will constitute the core part of a Southern China Coast megaregion; the Unified Jakarta-Bandung metro area forming the core of the Northern [[Java]] megaregion; and the [[Yangtze River]] Delta core, a part of a Central Chinese Coast megaregion.

==History of term ''megalopolis''==
The term was used by [[Patrick Geddes]] in his 1915 book ''Cities in Evolution'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/citiesinevolutio00gedduoft|title=Cities in Evolution|last=Geddes|first=Patrick|publisher=Williams &amp; Norgate|year=1915|isbn=|location=London|pages=|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verification needed|date=August 2017}} by [[Oswald Spengler]] in his 1918 book ''The Decline of the West'', and [[Lewis Mumford]] in his 1938 book ''The Culture of Cities'', which described it as the first stage in urban overdevelopment and social decline. Later, it was used by [[Jean Gottmann]] in his landmark 1961 study, ''Megalopolis: The Urbanized Northeastern Seaboard of the United States'', to describe the chain of metropolitan areas along the [[East Coast of the United States|northeastern seaboard]] of the US, extending from [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], through [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[Baltimore]] and ending in [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Northern Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottmann|first=Jean|title=L'Amerique|year=1954|publisher=Hachette|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gottmann|first=Jean|title=Megalopolis, or the urbanization of the Northeastern Seaboard|journal=Economic Geography|year=1957|volume=33|issue=3|pages=189–200|doi=10.2307/142307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottmann|first=Jean|title=Megalopolis. The Urbanized Northeastern seaboard of the United States|year=1961|publisher=The Twentieth Century Fund|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is sometimes called the "[[BosWash]] [[Northeast megalopolis|megalopolis]]". The term has been interpreted as meaning "supercity".&lt;ref name="Fielder76"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fielder |first1=W. |last2=Feeney |first2=Georgiana |title=Inquiring about Cities: Student text |date=1976 |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |isbn=9780030897849 |pages=193,299 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Vk7CYxsb8jcC |language=en |access-date=2018-06-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625161026/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Vk7CYxsb8jcC |archive-date=2018-06-25 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
[[File:Megalopolis.png|thumb|[[Northeast megalopolis]] ([[United States]]) and [[Taiheiyō Belt]] ([[Japan]]).]]
''Megapolis'' is ungrammatically derived from {{lang-gr|μέγας}} (mégas) meaning 'great' and {{lang-gr|πόλις}} (pólis) meaning 'city', therefore literally a 'great [[city]]' (compare "[[megacity]]"). Because in Greek, πόλις is feminine, the correct term is ''megalopolis''.{{cn|date=July 2018}} The Ancient Greek city of [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]] was formed by the Arcadian League by  bringing together smaller communities.

A ''megalopolis'', also known as a ''megaregion'', is a clustered network of cities. Gottmann defined its population as 25 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottmann|first=Jean|title=Since Megalopolis. The Urban Writings of Jean Gottmann|year=1989|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore and London|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doxiadis defined a small megalopolis a similar cluster with a population of about 10 million.&lt;ref name="megaregions"&gt;{{cite web |last=Taylor |first=Matt |url=http://www.america2050.org/megaregions.html |title=Megaregions |publisher=America 2050 |date= |accessdate=2017-04-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516142109/http://www.america2050.org/megaregions.html |archive-date=2017-05-16 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnet.com/2403-13070_23-192951.html|title=Who's Your City?: What Is a Megaregion?|date=19 March 2008|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612093053/http://www.bnet.com/2403-13070_23-192951.html|archive-date=12 June 2010|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doxiodis"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842940,00.html Cities: Capital for the New Megalopolis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827193412/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842940,00.html |date=2013-08-27 }}.''Time magazine'', November 4, 1966.

Modern interlinked ground [[transportation corridors]], such as rail and highway, often aid in the development of megalopolises. Using these commuter passageways to travel throughout the megalopolis is informally called ''megaloping''. This term was coined by Davide Gadren and Stefan Berteau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citypaper.net/articles/2007/05/31/fumbling-toward-portland |title=Fumbling Toward Portland |last=Tremble |first=Sam |date=May 30, 2007 |work=Philadelphia City Paper |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707005527/http://www.citypaper.net/articles/2007/05/31/fumbling-toward-portland |archivedate=July 7, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil, the similar sounding terms to ''megaregion'' (''megarregião'' when translated to English, are actually legally distinct and take on quite different meaning: [[Mesoregions of Brazil]] (mesorregião) and [[Microregions of Brazil]] (microrregião).

Constituent urban areas of each megalopolis are based on reckoning by a single American organization, the Regional Plan Association (RPA). The RPA definition of the Great Lakes Megalopolis includes some Canadian metropolitan areas with the United States, including some but not all major urban centres in the Windsor-Quebec City Corridor. Note that one city, [[Houston]], is listed in two different Megalopolis regions as defined by the RPA, (the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] and [[Texas Triangle]]).&lt;ref name="megaregions" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Regional Plan Association (2008).

'''Nihali''', also known as '''Nahali''' or erroneously as '''Kalto''', is a moribund [[language isolate]] that is spoken in west-central [[India]] (in [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Maharashtra]]), with approximately 2,000 people in 1991 out of an ethnic population of 5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/nll|title=Did you know Nihali is threatened?|website=Endangered Languages|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nihali tribal area is just south of the [[Tapti River]], around the village of Tembi in [[Nimar]] district of [[Madhya Pradesh]].&lt;ref name="ref77doxil"&gt;{{Citation | title=Nahali: a comparative study| journal=Part 25, Issue 5 of Mededeelingen der Koninklijke Nederlandsche Akademie van Wetenschappen, Afd. Letterkunde | author=Franciscus Bernardus Jacobus Kuiper | publisher=N.V. Noord-Hollandsche Uitg. Mij., 1962 | isbn= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nwh_QgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers of the Nihali language are also present in several villages of the Buldhana district in Maharashtra such as Jamod, Sonbardi, Kuvardev, Chalthana, Ambavara, Wasali, and Cicari. There are dialectal differences between the Kuvardev-Chalthana and the Jamod-Sonbardi varieties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The language has a very large number of words adopted from neighboring languages, with 60–70% apparently taken from [[Korku language|Korku]] (25% of vocabulary and much of its morphology), from [[Dravidian languages]], and from [[Marathi language|Marathi]], but much of its core vocabulary cannot be related to them or other languages, such as the numerals and words for "blood" and "egg". Scholars state that less than 25% of the language's original vocabulary is used today.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Nihali Language|last=Nagaraja|first=K.S.|publisher=Central Institute of Indian Languages|year=2014|isbn=978-81-7343-144-9|location=Manasagangotri, Mysore-570 006, India|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no longer any surviving monolingual speakers of the language. Those well-versed in modern Nihali are likely to speak varieties of Hindi, Marathi or Korku as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Nihali Language|last=Nagaraja|first=K.S.|publisher=Central Institute of Indian Languages|year=2014|isbn=978-81-7343-144-9|location=|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For centuries, most Nihali have often worked as agricultural labourers, for speakers of languages other than their own. In particular, Nihali labourers have often worked for members of the [[Korku people]], and are often bilingual in the [[Korku language]]. Because of this history, Nihali is sometimes used by its speakers only to prevent native Korku speakers and other outsiders from understanding them.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Nihali Language|last=Nagaraja|first=K.S|publisher=Central Institute of Indian Languages|year=2014|isbn=978-81-7343-144-9|location=Manasagangotri,Mysore-570 006|pages=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research into the Nihali language==
[[Franciscus Bernardus Jacobus Kuiper|Franciscus Kuiper]] was the first to suggest that Nihali may be unrelated to any other Indian language, with the non-Korku, non-Dravidian core vocabulary being the remnant of an earlier population in India. However, he did not rule out that it may be a [[Munda languages|Munda language]], like Korku. The [[Endangered Languages Project]] surmises a relationship with [[Kusunda language|Kusunda]], [[Ainu languages|Ainu]], and the [[Andamanese languages]], as part of [[Joseph Greenberg]]'s [[Indo-Pacific languages|Indo-Pacific]] hypothesis.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Kuiper suggested that Nihali may differ from neighbouring languages, such as Korku, mostly in its function as an [[argot]], such as a [[thieves' cant]].&lt;ref name="ref77doxil"/&gt; Kuiper's assertions stem, in part, from the fact that many oppressed groups within India have used [[Argot|secret languages]] to prevent outsiders from understanding them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
 
Linguist Norman Zide describes the recent history of the language  as follows:
"Nihali's borrowings are far more massive than in such textbook examples of heavy outside acquisition as [[Albanian language|Albanian]]." In this respect, says Zide, modern Nihali seems comparable to [[Mixed language|hybridised]] dialects of [[Romany language|Romany]] spoken in [[Western Europe]]. Zide claims that this is a result of a historical process that began with a massacre of Nihalis in the early 19th century, organised by one of the rulers of the area, supposedly in response to "marauding". Zide alleges that, afterwards, the Nihalis "decimated in size", have "functioned largely as raiders and thieves ... who [have] disposed of ... stolen goods" through "outside associates".  Zide adds that Nihali society has "long been multilingual, and uses Nihali as a more or less secret language which is not ordinarily revealed to outsiders" and that early researchers "attempting to learn the language were, apparently, deliberately rebuffed or misled".&lt;ref&gt;Norman Zide, "Munda and non-Munda Austroasiatic languages". In ''Current Trends in Linguistics'' 5: Linguistics in South Asia, p 438&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Korku-speakers refuse to acknowledge the Nihali as a distinct community, and describe the emergence of the Nihalis as resulting from a disruption of Korku civil society.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Munda Languages|last=Anderson|first=Gregory|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=0-415-32890-X|location=New York, New York|pages=772}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Nihali live similarly to the Kalto. That and the fact that Kalto has often been called Nahali led to confusion of the two languages.

'''Non-verbal leakage''' is a form of [[body language]]. This happens when a person verbalizes one thing but their body language does another. The most common forms of non-verbal leakage are [[List of gestures|hand-to-face]] [[gestures]].&lt;ref&gt;Ekman, P., Friesen, W., (1968). [http://www.ekmaninternational.com/ResearchFiles/Nonverbal-Leakage-And-Clues-To-Deception.pdf Nonverbal Leakage and Clues to Deception.] Journal for the Study of Interpersonal Processes,32, 88-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important concepts in the study of body language is that of non-verbal leakage. This occurs when we say one thing but our body language gestures give a different impression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holler|first=Judith|last2=Shovelton|first2=Heather|last3=Beattie|first3=Geoffrey|date=2009-06-01|title=Do Iconic Hand Gestures Really Contribute to the Communication of Semantic Information in a Face-to-Face Context?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10919-008-0063-9|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|language=en|volume=33|issue=2|pages=73–88|doi=10.1007/s10919-008-0063-9|issn=0191-5886}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most obvious of these are hand-to-face gestures. The best way to understand these is to think how you behaved when you were a small child. What did you do then if you saw something frightening? You put your hands over your eyes, because in a toddler’s mind, if you can’t see it, it’s not there.  
  
If you aren’t aware of non-verbal leakage, your body language will scream out to your audience that something is wrong. They won’t necessarily know exactly what that is, but they will subconsciously pick up the incongruity between your verbal and non-verbal messages, and that you are uncomfortable in some way about what you are saying.
 
Therefore you need to know the telltale signs of leakage so you can avoid making them and rehearse your delivery showing open, confident body language instead.
So, what do people do when they see, hear or have to say something they are uncomfortable with?

==Hand To Eyes==
The same thing occurs, but the hand wipes the mouth, scratches the face or strokes the chin. This is especially common when politicians are listening to other people speak, as they are champing at the bit to reply but have to literally hold the words back.
This gesture can be mistaken for interest and deep thought, but when this occurs the hand tends to be lower and holds or strokes the chin without touching the mouth. It is the fingers covering the mouth that makes all the difference.

==Hand To Nose==
Touching of the nose during conversation can also imply lying.
This gesture is also common when someone has been asked a difficult question and they are thinking about how to reply. It may be accompanied by statements like, "That's a good question".
Of course, it could always be that the person has an itchy nose, but when someone scratches an itch it tends to be with a vigorous motion using the fingernail. The hand to nose gesture is slower and uses the knuckle or fingertip to scratch, or pinches the bridge of the nose.

In one study, liars gave more false smiles and embarrassed smiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biland|first=C.|last2=Py|first2=J.|last3=Allione|first3=J.|last4=Demarchi|first4=S.|last5=Abric|first5=J.-C.|title=The effect of lying on intentional versus unintentional facial expressions|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1162908808000029|journal=Revue Européenne de Psychologie Appliquée/European Review of Applied Psychology|volume=58|issue=2|pages=65–73|doi=10.1016/j.erap.2008.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''open space reserve''' (also called '''open space preserve''', '''open space reservation''', and '''green space''') is an area of protected or [[conservation ethics|conserved]] land or water on which [[Real estate development|development]] is indefinitely set aside.

The purpose of an open space reserve may include the [[Historic preservation|preservation]] or [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] of a community or region's [[rural]] natural or historic character; the conservation or preservation of a land or water area for the sake of [[outdoor recreation|recreational]], [[Ecology|ecological]], [[environment (biophysical)|environmental]], [[aesthetics|aesthetic]], or [[agriculture|agricultural]] interests; or the management of a community or region's [[growth management|growth]] in terms of development, industry, or [[natural resource]]s extraction. Open space reserves may be [[Urban open space|urban]], [[suburban]], or rural; they may be actual designated areas of land or water, or they may be [[zoning]] districts or overlays where development is limited or controlled to create undeveloped areas of land or water within a community or region. They may be publicly owned or owned by [[non-profit]] or private interests.

A certain amount of overlap occurs with similar planning and conservation terms. [[Protected area]]s are open space reserves in which certain resources indigenous to the landscape are protected as opposed to conserved. [[Urban open space]] specifically refers to open space reserves within an urban setting; such may include [[natural landscape]]s or manicured urban parkland. [[Greenway (landscape)|Greenway]]s are linear open space reserves, linear corridors that span interconnected open space reserves, or linear chains of connected open space reserves. A [[green belt]] is a general area of open space surrounding an urban area. [[Green infrastructure]] is the total mass and viability of undeveloped, natural, and agricultural land and waterways, protected or not protected, within a particular community or region. [[Nature reserve]]s and [[wildlife refuge]]s are areas of open space set aside for the sake of protecting non-human species. [[National park]]s, [[state park]]s, and municipal parks, recreation areas, and reservations are types of open space reserves managed by government agencies for the primary purpose of passive or active human enjoyment. [[United States National Forest|National forest]]s, [[state forest]]s, and municipal forests are types of open space reserves set aside for the primary purpose of forest conservation. [[Flood control]] projects and protected ecological research areas may also be considered open space reserves secondary to their primary purpose.

There is growing evidence that open space is unequally distributed based on race and class, particularly in the US state of California, leading to concerns regarding [[Open Space Accessibility in California]] and other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDonald|first=Robert I.|last2=Forman|first2=Richard T.

'''Orthology''' is the study of the right use of words in [[language]]. The word comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ortho''- ("correct") and -''logy'' ("science of"). This [[science]] is a place where [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]], and many other fields of [[learning]] come together. The most noted use of ''Orthology'' is for the selection of words 
for the language of [[Basic English]] by the [[Orthological Institute]].

The book, ''The Meaning of Meaning'', by [[Charles Kay Ogden|C.K. Ogden]] and [[I.A. Richards]], is an important book dealing with orthology. The term ''Orthology'' comes from the book ''The Grammar of Science'' by [[Karl Pearson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Karl |first= Pearson |title= The Grammar of Science |origyear= 1893 |publisher= Walter Scott |location= London |pages=454 |quote= A fundamental part of logic is the study of the right use of language, clear definition, and, if needful, invention of terms -- ''Orthology''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2804">'''Person of Jewish ethnicity''' ({{lang-ru|'''Лицо еврейской национальности'''}}) is а Russian [[euphemism]] that was invented as a [[politically correct]] alternative term for an [[ethnic Jew]]. It was invented because [[Jew (word)|the word "Jew"]] became [[derogatory]] during [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Soviet antisemitic campaigns]].&lt;ref name="Sarnov"&gt;[[Benedikt Sarnov]],''Our Soviet Newspeak: A Short Encyclopedia of Real Socialism.'', Moscow: 2002, {{ISBN|5-85646-059-6}} (Наш советский новояз.

Several officially sanctioned antisemitic campaigns took place in the Soviet Union, most notably the [[Doctor's Plot]] and the struggle against the "[[rootless cosmopolitans]]". However, the entire Jewish population was never openly and officially declared the [[enemy of the people]].&lt;ref name="Sarnov"/&gt; Instead, several [[euphemism]]s were used, such as [[zionists]], [[rootless cosmopolitans]] and "persons of Jewish ethnicity". There was an important distinction between these words: ''zionist'' and ''rootless cosmopolitans'' served as a label for "bad Jews" as enemies of the state, whereas "persons of Jewish ethnicity" was a [[politically correct]] expression for good, loyal Jews who were called by some ordinary folks as ''trained'' Jews (the original Russian word "дресированные" (dressage) typically refers to animals trained to perform in circus).&lt;ref name="Sarnov"/&gt; However most people realized that all these euphemisms denoted ''all'' Jews. A dean of [[Marxism-Leninism]] department at one of Soviet Universities explained the policy to his students:&lt;ref name="Sarnov"/&gt;

{{Quotation|1=One of you asked if our current political campaign can be regarded as [[antisemitism|antisemitic]]. Comrade [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] said: "We hate Nazi not because they are Germans, but because they brought enormous suffering to our land". Same can be said about the Jews.}}

The analogous euphemism "person of Caucasian ethnicity" is used less frequently in modern Russian to refer to [[Racism in Russia#Peoples of the Caucasus|peoples of the Caucasus]], such as [[Georgians in Russia|Georgians]] or [[Armenians in Russia]].&lt;ref name="Sarnov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RFERL"/&gt;

[[File:Lean finely textured beef in its finished form.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Lean finely textured beef in its finished form, from an [[ABC News]] report about the product]]

'''Pink slime''' (also known as '''lean finely textured beef''' or '''LFTB''',&lt;ref name="USDA" /&gt; '''finely textured beef''',&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt; and '''boneless lean beef trimmings''' or '''BLBT'''&lt;ref name="Express-Times" /&gt;) is a meat by-product used as a [[food additive]] to [[ground beef]] and beef-based [[Meat#Methods of preparation|processed meats]], as a filler, or to reduce the overall fat content of ground beef.&lt;ref name="filler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="isit" /&gt; In the production process, heat and [[centrifuge]]s remove fat from the meat in [[Advanced meat recovery|beef trimmings]].&lt;ref name="Reuters-Plant Tour" /&gt; The resulting paste is exposed to [[ammonia]] gas or [[citric acid]] to kill bacteria.&lt;ref name="Reuters-Plant Tour" /&gt; In 2001, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) approved the product for limited human consumption. LFTB prepared using ammonia gas is banned for human consumption in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="Özer" /&gt;

In March 2012, an [[ABC News]] series about "pink slime" included claims that approximately 70% of ground beef sold in US supermarkets contained the additive at that time. Some companies and organizations stopped offering ground beef with the product. "Pink slime" was claimed by some originally to have been used as [[pet food]] and [[cooking oil]] and later approved for public consumption,&lt;ref name="abc70" /&gt; but this was disputed in April 2012, by both the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) administrator responsible for approving the product and [[Beef Products, Inc.]] (BPI), the largest US producer of the additive.&lt;ref name="Cattlenetwork" /&gt;&lt;ref name="beefisbeef" /&gt; In September 2012, BPI filed a defamation lawsuit against [[American Broadcasting Company]] for false claims about the product.&lt;ref name="CNN-Eatocracy" /&gt; By 2017 BPI was seeking $1.9 billion in damages.&lt;ref name="NYT_ABC_vs_BPI_2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/05/us/pink-slime-lawsuit.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 5, 2017 |access-date=June 7, 2017 |title=Trial Will Decide if ABC News Sullied a Company With ‘Pink Slime’ |author=Chokshi, Niraj}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 28, 2017, ABC announced that it had settled the suit.&lt;ref name="NYT_settlement"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/28/business/media/pink-slime-abc-lawsuit-settlement.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 28, 2017 |access-date=June 28, 2017 |title=ABC Settles With Meat Producer in ‘Pink Slime’ Defamation Case |author=Victor, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terms of the settlement were at least $177 million (US).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-abc-pinkslime-idUSKBN1AP0FY|title=Disney pays at least $177 million to settle 'pink slime' case: filing|date=August 9, 2017|work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Counsel for BPI believes this to be the largest amount ever paid in a media defamation case in the United States.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/08/09/media/disney-abc-news-pink-slime-settlement/index.html|title=Disney paying at least $177 million to settle 'pink slime' lawsuit|date=August 9, 2017|work=CNN Money|accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The product is regulated in different manners in various regions. In the US, the product is allowed to be used in ground beef, and it can be used in other meat products such as beef-based processed meats. The use of ammonia as an anti-microbial agent is approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]], and is included on the FDA's list of GRAS (generally recognized as safe) procedures, and is used in similar applications for numerous other food products, including puddings and baked goods.&lt;ref name="Beef Magazine" /&gt; The product is not allowed in Canada due to the presence of ammonia in it, and it is banned for human consumption in the European Union. Some consumer advocacy groups have promoted the elimination of the product or for mandatory disclosure of additives in beef, while others have expressed concerns about plant closures that occurred after the product received significant news media coverage.

== Production and content ==

Finely textured meat is produced by heating boneless [[Advanced meat recovery|beef trimmings]] to {{convert|107|-|109|F|abbr=on}}, removing the melted fat by [[centrifugal force]] using a [[centrifuge]], and [[flash freezing]] the remaining product to {{convert|15|F|abbr=on}} in 90 seconds in a roller press freezer.&lt;ref name="nytimes_safety_docs" /&gt; The roller press freezer is a type of freezer that was invented in 1971 by BPI CEO Eldon Roth that can "freeze packages of meat in two minutes" and began to be used at Beef Products Inc. in 1981.&lt;ref name="Food Safety News 2012"/&gt; The lean finely textured beef is added to [[ground beef]] as a filler or to reduce the overall fat content of ground beef.&lt;ref name="filler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="isit" /&gt; In March 2012 about 70% of ground beef sold in US supermarkets contained the product.&lt;ref name="abc70" /&gt; Source areas for the product from [[cattle]] may include the most contaminated portions,&lt;ref name="isit" /&gt; such as near the [[Hide (skin)|hide]].&lt;ref name="ABCNews-CompaniesStop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Menendez-USDA" /&gt;

The recovered beef material is extruded through long tubes that are thinner than a pencil, during which time at the [[Beef Products, Inc.]] (BPI) processing plant, the meat is exposed to gaseous ammonia.&lt;ref name="post" /&gt; At [[Cargill Meat Solutions]], [[citric acid]] is used to kill [[bacteria]] such as ''[[E. coli]]'' and ''[[Salmonella]]''.&lt;ref name="slimeon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miltner" /&gt; Gaseous ammonia in contact with the water in the meat produces [[ammonium hydroxide]].&lt;ref name="post" /&gt; The ammonia sharply increases the [[pH]] and damages microscopic organisms, the freezing causes ice crystals to form and puncture the organisms' weakened [[cell wall]]s, and the [[Stress (mechanics)|mechanical stress]] destroys the organisms altogether.&lt;ref name="nytimes_safety_docs" /&gt; The product is finely ground, compressed into pellets&lt;ref name="New Scientist" /&gt; or blocks, flash frozen and then shipped for use as an [[food additive|additive]].&lt;ref name="ABCNews-CompaniesStop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="omaha" /&gt;

Most of the finely textured beef is produced and sold by BPI, Cargill and [[Tyson Foods]].&lt;ref name="nytimes_safety" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tyson" /&gt;
As of March 2012 there was no labeling of the product, and only a [[USDA Organic]] label would have indicated that beef contained no "pink slime".&lt;ref name="ABCNews-CompaniesStop" /&gt; Per BPI, the finished product is 94% to 97% lean beef (with a fat content of 3% to 6%) has a nutritional value comparable to 90% lean ground beef, is very high in protein, low in fat, and contains iron, zinc and B vitamins.&lt;ref name="New Scientist" /&gt; U.S. beef that contains up to 15% of the product can be labeled as "ground beef".&lt;ref name="Toledo Blade" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Piller" /&gt; Up to 2005, filler could make up to 25% of ground meat.&lt;ref name=post/&gt; In an [[Associated Press]] review, food editor and cookbook author J.M. Hirsh compared the taste of two burgers: one supposedly containing LFTB and one traditional hamburger. He described the LFTB-containing burgers as smelling the same, but being less juicy and with not as much flavor.&lt;ref name="Hirsh" /&gt;

In 2002, a [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) [[microbiologist]] stated that the product contained [[connective tissue]] and that he did not consider it to be ground beef and that it was "not nutritionally equivalent" to ground beef.&lt;ref name=connective/&gt; Rick Jochum, a spokesperson for BPI, stated in 2012 that BPI's product does not contain cow intestines or connective tissue such as [[tendons]].&lt;ref name="New Scientist" /&gt;

== Early use ==
[[file:Ground beef USDA.jpg|thumb|[[Ground beef]] that does not contain the LFTB [[Food additive|additive]], from a USDA image of a beef-grinding operation.]]

In 1990, the USDA's [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]] (FSIS) approved the use of the technology for manufacturing finely textured meat. At the time of its approval, the FSIS called the remaining product "meat", although one FSIS microbiologist dissented, arguing it contained both muscle and [[connective tissue]].&lt;ref name="connective" /&gt;

In 1994, in response to public health concerns over [[pathogen]]ic ''E. coli'' in beef, the founder of BPI, Eldon Roth, began work on the "pH Enhancement System", which [[Disinfectant|disinfects]] meat using injected [[anhydrous]] ammonia in gaseous form,&lt;ref name="nytimes_safety_docs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes_safety" /&gt;&lt;ref name="beefhistory" /&gt; rapid freezing to {{convert|28|F|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="nytimes_safety_docs" /&gt; and mechanical stress.&lt;ref name="nytimes_safety_docs" /&gt;

In 2001, the FSIS approved the gaseous [[Disinfectant|disinfection]] system as an intermediate step before the roller press freezer,&lt;ref name="nytimes_safety_docs" /&gt; and approved the disinfected product for human consumption, as an additive.&lt;ref name = "beefhistory" /&gt; The FSIS agreed with BPI's suggestion that ammonia was a "processing agent" which did not need to be listed on labels as an ingredient.&lt;ref name="nytimes_safety_docs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes_safety" /&gt;&lt;!--The NYT article says the FDA made the 'processing agent' decision, but documents attached to the article indicate it was the USDA/FSIS.--&gt; FSIS microbiologists Carl Custer and Gerald Zirnstein stated that they argued against the product's approval for human consumption, saying that it was not "meat" but actually "salvage",&lt;ref name="abc70" /&gt; and that the USDA should seek independent verification of its safety,&lt;ref name="nytimes_safety" /&gt; but they were overruled.&lt;ref name="abc70" /&gt; In 2003, BPI commissioned a study of the effectiveness and safety of the disinfection process; the [[Iowa State University]] researchers found no safety concern in the product or in ground beef containing it.&lt;ref name="nytimes_safety_docs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes_safety" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PinkSlimeRadford" /&gt;

The term "pink slime", a reference to the product's "distinctive look",&lt;ref name="Robbery" /&gt; was coined in 2002 by Zirnstein in an internal FSIS e-mail.&lt;ref name="nytimes_safety" /&gt;&lt;ref name="connective" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters1" /&gt; Expressing concern that ammonia should be mentioned on the labels of packaged ground beef to which the treated trimmings are added, Zirnstein stated "I do not consider the stuff to be ground beef, and I consider allowing it in ground beef to be a form of fraudulent labeling".&lt;ref name="nytimes_safety" /&gt; He later stated that his main concern was that connective tissue is not "meat", and that ground beef to which the product had been added should not be called ground beef, since it is not nutritionally equivalent to regular ground beef.&lt;ref name="connective" /&gt;

In 2007, the USDA determined the disinfection process was so effective that it would be exempt from "routine testing of meat used in hamburger sold to the general public".&lt;ref name="nytimes_safety" /&gt;

A December 2009 investigative piece published by ''[[The New York Times]]'' questioned the safety of the meat treated by this process, pointing to occasions in which process adjustments were not effective.&lt;ref name=nytimes_safety/&gt; This article included the first public use of the term "pink slime" as a [[pejorative]].&lt;ref name="Atlantic1" /&gt; In January 2010, ''The New York Times'' published an editorial reiterating the concerns posed in the news article while noting that no meat produced by BPI had been linked to any illnesses or outbreaks.&lt;ref name="NYT-1" /&gt;

An episode of ''[[Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution]]'' aired on April 12, 2011, depicted [[Jamie Oliver]] decrying the use of "pink slime" in the food supply and in [[School meal|school lunches]].&lt;ref name="NPR-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver" /&gt; In the episode, Oliver douses beef trimmings in liquid ammonia while explaining what the product is and why he is disgusted with it.&lt;ref name="Oliver" /&gt; Oliver stated, "Everyone who is told about 'pink slime' doesn't like it in their food—school kids, soldiers, senior citizens all hate it".&lt;ref name="Oliver-2" /&gt;  The introduction of the additive into the nation’s meat supply caused concern and was criticized by some scientists.

An 11-segment series of reports in March 2012 from [[ABC News]] brought widespread public attention to and raised consumer concerns about the product.&lt;ref name="filler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABCNews-CompaniesStop" /&gt; The product was described as "essentially scrap meat pieces compressed together and treated with an antibacterial agent".&lt;ref name="Dillingham" /&gt; Lean finely textured beef (LFTB) was referred to as "an unappetizing example of [[Industrial agriculture (animals)|industrialized food production]]".&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; The product has been characterized as "unappetizing, but perhaps not more so than other things that are routinely part of hamburger" by Sarah Klein, an attorney for the food safety program at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.&lt;ref name="Argento" /&gt; Nutritionist [[Andy Bellatti]] has referred to the product as "one of many symptoms of a broken [[Food systems|food system]]".&lt;ref name="Bellatti" /&gt; [[Food policy]] writer Tom Laskawy noted that ammonium hydroxide is only one of several chemicals routinely added to industrially produced meat in the United States.&lt;ref name="Laskawy" /&gt;

It was reported at that time that 70% of ground beef sold in US supermarkets contained the additive, and that the USDA considered it as meat.&lt;ref name="abc70" /&gt; The USDA issued a statement that LFTB was safe and had been included in consumer products for some time, and its [[Under Secretary of Agriculture for Food Safety]] Elisabeth A. Hagen stated that "The process used to produce LFTB is safe and has been used for a very long time. And adding LFTB to ground beef does not make that ground beef any less safe to consume".&lt;ref name="USDA" /&gt;

=== Industry response ===

Manufacturer Beef Products Inc. (BPI) and meat industry organizations addressed public concerns by stating that the additive, though processed, is "lean beef" that simply was not able to be reclaimed through traditional slaughterhouse practices until newer technologies became available approximately 20 years ago.&lt;ref name="isit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABCNews-CompaniesStop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dudebeef" /&gt; With regard to concerns over the use of ammonium hydroxide, BPI noted that its use as an anti-microbial agent is approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]]. The use of ammonium hydroxide is included on the FDA's list of GRAS (generally recognized as safe) procedures, and is used in similar applications for numerous other food products, including puddings and baked goods.&lt;ref name="Beef Magazine" /&gt;

=== Market response ===

Several U.S. food manufacturers publicly stated that they did not use the product in their wares, including [[ConAgra Foods|ConAgra Foods Inc.]], [[Sara Lee Corporation]] and [[Kraft Foods|Kraft Foods Inc.]]&lt;ref name="Reuters-Wendy's" /&gt; Many meat retailers stated that they either did not use the product, or would cease using it.&lt;ref name="Q13" /&gt;

Many fast food chains stopped use of the product after the controversy arose, or stated that they had not used the product before.&lt;ref name="Survey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wendy's" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fiveguys-twitter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC-1" /&gt; In April 2012 the ''[[Concord Monitor]]'' reported increased business in some small neighborhood markets where the product's use was less likely, due to consumer concerns about the additive.&lt;ref name="nomo" /&gt;{{Clear}}

On March 25, 2012, BPI announced it would suspend operations at three of its four plants, being in "[[Crisis management|crisis planning]]".&lt;ref name="omaha" /&gt;&lt;ref name="omaha" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC-2" /&gt; The three plants produced a total of about 900,000 pounds of the product per day.&lt;ref name="HuffPostMarch26" /&gt; BPI said it lost contracts with 72 customers, many over the course of one weekend, and production decreased from 5 million pounds of LFTB per week to below one million pounds a week at the nadir (lowest point of production).&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt; Effective May 25, 2012, BPI closed three of its four plants, including one in [[Garden City, Kansas]], lost more than $400 million in sales,&lt;ref name="kansas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="freepMay8" /&gt; and laid off 700 workers.&lt;ref name="time" /&gt; Production decreased to less than 2 million pounds in 2013.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; Cargill also significantly cut production of finely textured beef and in April 2012 "warned [that] the public's resistance to the filler could lead to higher hamburger prices this barbecue season".&lt;ref name="brupt" /&gt; About 80% of sales of the product evaporated "overnight" in 2012, per the president of Cargill Beef. Cargill stopped production in [[Vernon, California]], and laid off about 50 workers as well as slowing production at other plants including a beef-processing plant in [[Plainview, Texas]], where about 2,000 people were laid off.&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt;

Many [[grocery store]]s and [[supermarket]]s, including the nation's three largest chains, announced in March 2012 that they would no longer sell products containing the additive.&lt;ref name="Reuters-1" /&gt; Some grocery companies, restaurants and school districts discontinued the sale and provision of beef containing the additive after the media reports.&lt;ref name="Muskal" /&gt;

In April 2012, the USDA received requests from beef processors to allow voluntary [[Packaging and labeling|labeling]] of products with the additive, and stated it planned to approve labeling after checks for label accuracy.&lt;ref name="KMTV" /&gt; Both BPI and Cargill made plans to label products that contain the additive to alleviate these concerns and restore consumer confidence.&lt;ref name="LabelingLFTB" /&gt; Following the USDA announcement to allow choices in purchasing decisions for ground beef, many school districts stated that they would opt out of serving ground beef with LFTB.&lt;ref name="USAToday3-22-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-1" /&gt; By June 2012, 47 out of 50 U.S. states declined to purchase any of the product for the 2012–2013 school year while [[South Dakota Department of Education]], Nebraska, and Iowa chose to continue buying it.&lt;ref name="CBS-1" /&gt;

On April 2, 2012, AFA Foods, a ground-beef processor manufacturer of finely textured beef owned by [[Yucaipa Companies]] filed for [[Yucaipa Companies#Bankruptcy of AFA Foods|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]]&lt;ref name="brupt" /&gt; citing "ongoing media attention" that has "dramatically reduced the demand for all ground beef products".&lt;ref name="Singh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Abad-Santos" /&gt; On April 3, 2012, U.S. cattle [[Futures exchange|futures]] on the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] were at a 3.5-month low, which was partially attributed to the "pink slime" controversy. Livestock traders stated that: "It has put a dent in [[demand]]. It is [[bullish]] for live cattle over the long-term, but short-term it is certainly negative".&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Waters" /&gt;

=== Government response ===

Following the suspension of operations at three out of four BPI plants, members of the media and leaders were invited by [[Iowa Governor]] [[Terry Branstad]] to tour the BPI facility that remained open in South Sioux City, Nebraska.&lt;ref name="dudebeef" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yahoo-1" /&gt; The founders of BPI gave campaign contributions to Branstad in 2010,&lt;ref name="dudebeef" /&gt; and to other candidates' campaigns.&lt;ref name="Des Moines Register" /&gt; Branstad stated to ABC News that the contributions were not a factor in his decision regarding having the event.&lt;ref name="dudebeef" /&gt; Texas Governor [[Rick Perry]], Nebraska Lieutenant Governor [[Rick Sheehy]], Kansas Governor [[Sam Brownback]], and South Dakota Lieutenant Governor [[Matt Michels]],&lt;ref name="Huffington-1" /&gt; toured the [[South Sioux City, Nebraska]], plant in an attempt to allay "inaccurate information" that they stated as having caused "an unnecessary panic among consumers".&lt;ref name="GovernorsShowLove" /&gt; The publicity tour emerged with the promotional slogan, "Dude, it's beef!"&lt;ref name="dudebeef" /&gt; News reporters were not allowed to ask employees at BPI any questions during the tour.&lt;ref name="dudebeef" /&gt; BPI asserts that social media and ABC News "grossly misrepresented" their product.&lt;ref name="dudebeef" /&gt; BPI eventually sued ABC News for [[defamation]].&lt;ref name="Lopez" /&gt; On March 28, 2012, Branstad stated, "The problem is, we take this off the market, then we end up with a fatter product that's going to cost more and it's going to increase the obesity problem in this country".&lt;ref name="GovernorsShowLove" /&gt; [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]] and other retailers that have removed the product from their shelves or product lines have stated they will not raise the price of their beef.&lt;ref name="ABCNews-CompaniesStop" /&gt; Branstad also stated that he would recommend that Iowa state public schools continue to use ground beef which contains the product, and stated plans to "send a letter to the state's public schools, encouraging them to continue to buy LFTB".&lt;ref name="Sioux City Journal" /&gt;

On March 22, 2012, 41 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] in [[United States Congress|Congress]], led by [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Chellie Pingree]] of [[Maine]], wrote a letter to [[United States Secretary of Agriculture]] [[Tom Vilsack]], head of the USDA, that "creating a two-tiered school lunch program where kids in less affluent communities get served this low-grade slurry is wrong" and urged its elimination from all public-school lunches.&lt;ref name="Lin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vilsack" /&gt; Senator [[Jon Tester]] of [[Montana]] issued a news release in March 2012 urging Agriculture Secretary Vilsack to remove "pink slime" from school lunches and replace it with "high-quality Montana beef".&lt;ref name="BozemanChronicle" /&gt; Tester stated he planned to include provisions in the upcoming [[United States farm bill|farm bill]] that would allow schools more flexibility in using USDA [[commodity]] funds, to increase options in purchasing [[Local food|locally grown]] and produced foods.&lt;ref name="BozemanChronicle" /&gt;

=== School lunches ===

The reaction against the product has also been partially credited to a [[Change.org]] petition that has landed over a quarter million signatures to ban it in [[School meal|school lunches]].&lt;ref name="ABCNews-CompaniesStop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PinkSlimeRadford"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Radford |first1=Benjamin |authorlink1=Benjamin Radford |title=Pink Slime and the Failure of Skepticism |url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/pink_slime_and_the_failure_of_skepticism |website=csicop.org |accessdate=12 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612011933/https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/pink_slime_and_the_failure_of_skepticism |archivedate=12 June 2018 |date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some parents and consumer advocates insisted the product be removed from public schools, the USDA indicated, beginning in fall 2012, that it would give school districts the choice between ground beef with or without LFTB.&lt;ref name="omaha" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USAToday3-22-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kcs" /&gt; [[CBS News]] reported that Chicago Public schools may have served "pink slime" in school lunches.&lt;ref name="CBS Chicago" /&gt;

While some school districts have their own suppliers, many school districts purchase beef directly from the USDA and do not know what is in the beef.&lt;ref name="Lin" /&gt; For the year 2012, the USDA planned on purchasing 7 million pounds of lean beef trimmings for the U.S. national school lunch program.&lt;ref name=connective/&gt; USDA spokesman Mike Jarvis stated that of the 117 million pounds of beef ordered nationally for the school lunch program in the past year, 6% was LFTB.&lt;ref name="Lin" /&gt; An analysis of [[California Department of Education]] data indicated that "anywhere from none to nearly 3 million pounds of beef from the USDA that was served in California schools last year could have contained lean finely textured beef".&lt;ref name="Lin" /&gt; According to the USDA, the cost differential between ground beef with and without the additive has been estimated at approximately 3%.&lt;ref name="Lin" /&gt;

=== BPI lawsuit ===

On September 13, 2012, BPI announced that it filed a $1.2 billion lawsuit, ''Beef Products, Inc. v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.,'' against ABC News; three reporters ([[Diane Sawyer]], [[Jim Avila]] and [[David Kerley]]) and others, claiming ABC News made nearly "200 false, misleading and defamatory statements, repeated continuously during a month-long disinformation campaign", engaged in "product and food disparagement, and tortious interference with business relationships". BPI called the ABC News series a "concerted disinformation campaign" against LFTB.&lt;ref name="CNN-Eatocracy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BPI Lawsuit" /&gt;

ABC News denied BPI's claims, and called the lawsuit without merit.&lt;ref name="Schulte" /&gt; ABC News sought to have the case [[Removal jurisdiction|removed]] from South Dakota state court to federal court.&lt;ref name="TRcourt" /&gt; In June 2013, a federal judge sent the lawsuit back to state court.&lt;ref name="GlobalPost" /&gt; On March 27, 2014, South Dakota state court Judge Cheryle Gering rejected ABC's motion to dismiss, and allowed the defamation suit to move forward.&lt;ref name="CSM-1" /&gt; Diane Sawyer's motion for [[summary judgment]] was granted and she was dismissed.&lt;ref name="USN031517"&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge Dismisses ABC's Diane Sawyer From 'Pink Slime' Case|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/south-dakota/articles/2017-03-15/judge-dismisses-abcs-diane-sawyer-from-pink-slime-case|accessdate=June 16, 2017|work=US News|agency=AP|date=March 15, 2017|quote=A South Dakota judge has dismissed ABC anchor Diane Sawyer from a defamation lawsuit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial of the case began June 5, 2017, in [[Elk Point, South Dakota]].&lt;ref name="Reuters6517"&gt;{{cite news|author1=P.J.

== Current use ==
In March 2012, 70% of ground beef in the U.S. contained lean finely textured beef, and a year later in March 2013 the amount was estimated by meat industry officials to be at approximately 5%.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; This significant reduction is due in part to the extensive media coverage that began in March 2012 about the additive.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; Kroger Co. and Supervalu Inc. have stopped using the additive.&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt;

Cargill started using a label stating "Contains Finely Textured Beef" from 2014.&lt;ref name="cargill2013" /&gt; Production of finely textured beef increased modestly{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}, as beef prices rose by 27% over two years in 2014 and "retailers [sought] cheaper trimmings to include in hamburger meat and processors find new products to put it in".&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt; Senior management of Cargill claimed almost full recovery as sales tripled.&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt; BPI regained 40 customers that are mostly processors and patty-makers who distribute to retailers and the USDA since March 2012.&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt; It does not label its product.&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt;

== Regulation ==
[[file:Terry Branstad by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Iowa governor Terry Branstad, a supporter of the product's use in beef products]]

In the US, the additive is not for direct consumer sale. Lean finely textured beef can constitute up to 15% of ground beef without additional labeling, and it can be added to other meat products such as beef-based [[Meat#Methods of preparation|processed meats]].&lt;ref name="ABCNews-CompaniesStop" /&gt;

Because of ammonium hydroxide use in its processing, the lean finely textured beef by BPI is not permitted in Canada.&lt;ref name="TheSpec" /&gt; [[Health Canada]] stated that: "Ammonia is not permitted in Canada to be used in ground beef or meats during their production" and may not be imported, as [[Food and Drugs Act|the Canadian Food and Drugs Act]] requires that imported meat products meet the same standards and requirements as domestic meat.&lt;ref name="TheSpec" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Calgary Herald" /&gt; Canada does allow Cargill's citric acid-produced Finely Textured Meat (FTM) to be "used in the preparation of ground meat" and "identified as ground meat" under certain conditions.&lt;ref name="Canadian Food Inspection Agency" /&gt;

Lean finely textured beef and Finely Textured Meat is banned for human consumption in the [[European Union]] (EU).&lt;ref name="Özer" /&gt;{{efn|"Separating meat from bone is what makes desinewed meat. Separating fat from meat results in LFTB. At the moment, however, one thing the two processes have in common is that both are banned by the EC."&lt;ref name="Flynn" /&gt;}}

== Public perception ==

The nature of the product and the manner in which it is processed led to concerns that it might be a risk to human health, despite the fact that there have been no reported cases of [[foodborne illness]]es due to consumption of the product.&lt;ref name="PinkSlimeRadford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KWCH" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Tribune" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Letter" /&gt; Among consumers, media reporting significantly reduced its acceptance as an additive to ground beef.&lt;ref name="ABC-3" /&gt;

A [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris Interactive]] survey commissioned by [[Red Robin]]&lt;ref name="Red Robin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="QSR" /&gt; and released on April 4, 2012, found that 88% of US adults were aware of the "pink slime" issue, and that of those who were aware, 76% indicated that they were "at least somewhat concerned", with 30% "extremely concerned". 53% of respondents who stated that they were aware of pink slime took some action, such as researching ground beef they purchase or consume, or decreasing or eliminating ground beef consumption.&lt;ref name="Survey" /&gt;

== Legislation ==

Some consumer advocacy groups pressed for pink slime's elimination or for mandatory disclosure of additives in beef,&lt;ref name="isit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABCNews-CompaniesStop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dudebeef" /&gt;&lt;ref name="White" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gleiter" /&gt; but a spokesperson from Beef Products Inc. at the time said there was no need for any additional labeling, asking "What should we label it? It's 100 percent beef, what do you want us to label it? I'm not prepared to say it's anything other than beef, because it's 100 percent beef".&lt;ref name="ABC-4" /&gt;

Other consumer advocacy groups, notably the [[National Consumers League]], expressed dismay at the popular reaction against the product, and especially the plant closures "because of business the company has lost to very serious misinformation, widely disseminated by the media, about its product, lean finely textured beef (LFTB)".&lt;ref name="Greenberg" /&gt; Similarly, the [[Consumer Federation of America]] said the plant closures were "unfortunate" and expressed concern that the product might be replaced in ground beef with "something that has not been processed to assure the same level of safety".&lt;ref name="Waldrop" /&gt; U.S. consumers have expressed concerns that ground beef which contains the product is not labeled as such, and that consumers are currently unable to make informed purchasing decisions due to this lack of product labeling.&lt;ref name="isit" /&gt; Senator [[Bob Menendez]] of [[New Jersey]] called upon the USDA to institute mandatory labeling guidelines for ground beef sold in supermarkets, so consumers can make informed purchasing decisions.&lt;ref name="Menendez-USDA" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4440">A '''plant community''' (sometimes "phytocoenosis" or "phytocenosis") is   a collection or association&lt;ref name=ICPL/&gt; of [[plant species]] within a designated geographical unit, which forms a relatively uniform patch, distinguishable from neighboring patches of different [[vegetation type]]s. The components of each plant community are influenced by [[soil type]], [[topography]], [[climate]] and human disturbance. In many cases there are several soil types within a given phytocoenosis.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Gobat, Michel Aragno, Willy Matthey and V. A. K. Sarma. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Mt Anne from High Shelf Camp.jpg|thumb|Alpine Heathland plant community at High Shelf Camp near [[Mount Anne]], [[Tasmania]], [[Australia]]]]
A plant community can be described ''[[floristics|floristically]]'' (the species it contains) and/or ''[[phytophysiognomy|physiognomically]]'' (its physical structure).  For example, a [[forest]] (a community of trees) includes the [[overstory]], or upper [[tree layer]] of the [[canopy (biology)|canopy]], as well as the [[understory]], further subdivided into the [[shrub layer]], [[herbaceous layer]], and sometimes also [[moss layer]]. In some cases of complex forests there is also a well-defined lower tree layer. A plant community is similar in concept to a [[vegetation type]], with the former having more of an emphasis on the ecological association of species within it, and the latter on overall appearance by which it is readily recognized by a layperson.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

A plant community can be rare even if none of the major species defining it are rare.&lt;ref name=ICPL/&gt;{{rp|115}} This is because it is the association of species and relationship to their environment that may be rare.&lt;ref name=ICPL&gt;Introduction to California Plant Life, [[Robert Ornduff]], [[Phyllis M. Faber]], Todd Keeler-Wolf, California Natural History Guides No. 69, University of California Press, Ltd., 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-520-23704-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|115}} An example is the [[Sycamore Alluvial Woodland]] in California dominated by the California sycamore ''[[Platanus racemosa]]''.&lt;ref name=ICPL/&gt;{{rp|115}} The community is rare, being localized to a small area of California and existing nowhere else, yet the California sycamore is not a rare tree in California.&lt;ref name=ICPL/&gt;{{rp|115}}

==Examples==
An example is a grassland on the northern [[Caucasus]] [[Steppes]], where common grass species found are ''[[Festuca|Festuca sulcata]]'' and ''[[Poa|Poa bulbosa]]''. A common sedge in this grassland phytocoenosis is ''[[Carex shreberi]]''. Other representative [[forb]]s occurring in these steppe grasslands are ''[[Artemisia (genus)|Artemisia austriaca]]'' and ''[[Polygonum aviculare]].&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Suttie, Stephen G. Reynolds and Caterina Batello. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a three tiered plant community is in Central Westland of South Island, New Zealand. These forests are the most extensive continuous reaches of [[podocarp]]/broadleaf forests in that country. The overstory includes [[Prumnopitys ferruginea|miro]], [[rimu]] and [[mountain totara]]. The mid-story includes tree ferns such as ''[[Cyathea smithii]]'' and ''[[Dicksonia squarrosa]]'', whilst the lowest tier and [[epiphyte|epiphytic]] associates include ''[[Asplenium polyodon]]'', ''[[Tmesipteris tannensis]]'', ''[[Astelia solandri]]'' and ''[[Blechnum discolor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;C.

A '''post-credits scene''' (also called a '''tag''', '''stinger''', '''coda''', '''after-credits sequence''' or '''credit cookie''')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Credit cookie |url=http://wordspy.com/words/creditcookie.asp |publisher=[[Wordspy.com]] |date=June 25, 2011 |access-date=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a short clip that appears after all or some of the [[closing credits]] have rolled and sometimes after a production logo of a [[film]], [[TV series]] or [[video game]] have run. It is usually included for humour or to set up a possible [[sequel]].

==History==
One of the earliest appearances of a post-credits scene in a modern mainstream film was in  ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' in 1979, and use of such scenes gained popularity throughout the 1980s at the end of comedy films. In 1980, ''[[Airplane!]]'' ended with a callback to an [[Howard Jarvis|abandoned taxicab passenger]] who was not a primary character. Enhanced application continued in August, 1987, when in ''[[Masters of the Universe]]'' Skeletor's head emerges from the water at the bottom of the pit, saying "I'll be back!".  ''The Muppet Movie'' also began a trend of using such scenes to break the [[fourth wall]], even when much of the rest of the film had kept it intact. The scenes were often used as a form of [[metafiction]], with characters showing an awareness that they were at the end of a film, and sometimes telling the audience directly to leave the theatre. Films using this technique include ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'' (in which the title character frequently broke the fourth wall during the film) and the musical remake of ''[[The Producers (2005 film)|The Producers]]''. The post-credits scene in the latter film also includes a cameo appearance by ''Producers'' creator [[Mel Brooks]].

Post-credits scenes also appeared on the long-running television show ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', introduced in the 1990 episode ''[[Rocket Attack U.S.A.]]'', continuing until the end of the series. With few exceptions, they highlighted moments from the films that were either particularly nonsensical or had simply caught the writers' attention.

==Modern film examples==
Stingers lacking the metafictional aspects also gained prominence in the 1980s, although they were still primarily used for comedy films. Post-credits scenes became useful places for humorous scenes that would not fit in the main body of the film. Most were short clips that served to tie together loose ends—minor characters whose fates were not elaborated on earlier in the film, or plotlines that were not fully wrapped up. For example, all five ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean films|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' films include such scenes. During its [[wide release]], ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]'' features a stinger that reveals that Kip and LaFawnduh get married. In the film ''[[The Cannonball Run]]'', [[bloopers]] from the film are shown. Many of [[Jackie Chan]]'s American-made movies feature [[outtakes]] during the credits which often show him getting injured doing his own stunts.

Even when post-credit scenes started to be used by films with little comedy development, the same format of giving closure to incomplete storylines or inconsequential characters remained in use. Using humor in such scenes is also still common for more serious films, as in the film ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'', in which [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] is shown after his defeat by Daredevil in a full body cast. Other films eschew the comedy in favor of a twist or revelation that would be out of place elsewhere in the film, as in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''{{'}}s post-credits scene, where [[Professor X]] is shown to be alive after his apparent death by the hands of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]]. Another example is the stinger at the end of ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' which features a post-memory loss [[Gilderoy Lockhart|Lockhart]]. A third example occurs in ''[[Young Sherlock Holmes]]'': during the entire credits, Rathe is shown traveling to an Alpine inn, where he signs the register as "[[Professor Moriarty|Moriarty]]".

With the rise of pre-planned [[media franchise|film franchise]]s, post-credit scenes have been adopted in order to prepare the audience for upcoming sequels, sometimes going so far as to include a cliffhanger ending where the main film is largely stand-alone. The cinematic release of ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' demonstrated the sequel set-up use of stingers by featuring the [[trailer (film)|trailer]] for ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]''.

Some films, including [[Richard Linklater]]'s ''[[School of Rock]]'', take the idea of the post-credits scene to its limit by running the credits during the main action of the film. In this example, the characters perform a song in the last minutes of the film, and the credits run inconspicuously until one character sings the line "the movie is over/but we're still on screen".

The [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] has made extensive use of mid- or post-credit scenes (often  both) which mainly, but not always, serve purpose as a teaser for one of [[Marvel Studios]]' future films. For instance, in the post-credits scene of 2010's ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', a [[Mjolnir (comics)|large hammer]] at the bottom of a crater in a desert in New Mexico is shown being located by S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Agent Coulson]], thus setting up their next release, 2011's ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', while the post-credits sequence of ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' introduces the characters of [[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro]] and [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda Maximoff]], who go on to face and then join the Avengers in ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''. Other times, rather than to tease other films, these films use mid- and post-credits scenes as jokes, such as ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', which has a post-credits scene of the team eating [[shawarma]] in a derelict restaurant in the aftermath of the film's climactic battle, or ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'', which features [[Captain America]] educating the audience on patience. 

The credits of many [[Pixar]] films, including ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' (1998), ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' (2003), ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]'' (2015) and ''[[Finding Dory]]'' (2016), have included [[comedy]]. Other Pixar films, such as ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' (2006), ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' (2010) and ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'' (2015), have included an epilogue that plays during the credits.

An unusual use of the post-credits scene is to fulfill contractual obligations. In order to secure the [[personality rights]] to produce ''[[The Disaster Artist (film)|The Disaster Artist]]'', a [[biopic]] of [[Tommy Wiseau]], the filmmakers were obligated to include a cameo by Wiseau himself. This scene was filmed, but relegated to the post-credits sequence of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/james-franco-the-disaster-artist/|title=James Franco Directed ‘The Disaster Artist’ in Character as Tommy Wiseau|date=27 October 2017|accessdate=14 November 2017|website=Slashfilm|first=Ben|last=Peason}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In video games==
&lt;!-- Please don't just add examples, especially ones without any references. [[WP:RS]] --&gt;
[[Video game]]s, particularly those with complex stories, also use post-credits scenes. An early example is ''[[EarthBound]]'', in which [[Ness (character)|Ness]] awakens to knock on the front door just like the beginning of the game, and finds Pokey Minch's younger brother [[List of EarthBound characters|Picky]] with a message from his big brother Pokey, indicating that he escaped and warns Ness to come and get him. Common is a scene or voiceover after the credits, of one or more characters speaking, revealing new information that gives a new perspective to the previous events as well as setting up part of the next game in the series.
As the credits for modern games get longer, added cut scenes that maintain interest during the credits are becoming more common.

It is perhaps most widely known for being the main language family of the [[Inca Empire]]. The Spanish colonisers initially encouraged its use, but from the middle of their reign they suppressed it. However, Quechua ultimately [[Historical linguistics| survived]], and variants are still widely spoken today.

==History==
The Quechua had already expanded across wide ranges of the central Andes long before the expansion of the [[Inca Empire]]. The Inca were one among many peoples in present-day Peru who already spoke a form of Quechua. In the [[Cusco]] region, Quechua was influenced by neighboring languages such as [[Aymara language|Aymara]], which caused it to develop as distinct. In similar ways, diverse dialects developed in different areas, borrowing from local languages, when the Inca Empire ruled and imposed Quechua as the official language.

After the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]] in the 16th century, Quechua continued to be used widely by the indigenous peoples as the "common language". It was officially recognized by the Spanish administration and many Spanish learned it in order to communicate with local peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=De la etnohistoria a la historia en los Andes : 51o Congreso Internacional de Americanistas, Santiago de Chile, 2003 | editor1= Fisher, John|editor2=Cahill, David Patrick | publisher=Congreso Internacional de Americanistas | year=2008 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IFH0Z5_HKVEC&amp;pg=PA295&amp;dq=%22lenguas+generales%22+peru+Virreinato&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi78r-g3IPTAhVmzIMKHRzqCw4Q6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lenguas%20generales%22%20peru%20Virreinato&amp;f=false | page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clergy of the [[Catholic Church]] adopted Quechua to use as the language of [[evangelism|evangelization]]. Given its use by the Catholic missionaries, the range of Quechua continued to expand in some areas.

In the late 18th century, colonial officials ended administrative and religious use of Quechua, banning it from public use in Peru after the [[Túpac Amaru II]] rebellion of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name=adelaar167/&gt; The Crown banned even "loyal" pro-Catholic texts in Quechua, such as Garcilaso de la Vega's ''[[Comentarios Reales de los Incas|Comentarios Reales]].''&lt;ref&gt;Aybar cited by Hart, Stephen M. ''A Companion to Latin American Literature,'' p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a brief revival of the language immediately after the Latin American nations achieved independence in the 19th century, the prestige of Quechua had decreased sharply. Gradually its use declined so that it was spoken mostly by indigenous people in the more isolated and conservative rural areas. Nevertheless, in the 21st century, Quechua language speakers number 8 to 10 million people across South America,&lt;ref name=adelaar167/&gt; the most speakers of any indigenous language.

The oldest written records of the language are by missionary [[Domingo de Santo Tomás]], who arrived in Peru in 1538 and learned the language from 1540. He published his ''Grammatica o arte de la lengua general de los indios de los reynos del Perú'' (Grammar or Art of the General Language of the Indians of the Royalty of Peru) in 1560.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The major obstacle to the usage and teaching of Quechuan languages is the lack of written materials in the languages, such as books, newspapers, software, and magazines. The Bible has been translated into Quechua and is distributed by certain missionary groups. Quechua, along with [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and minor indigenous languages, remains essentially a [[spoken language]].

In recent years, Quechua has been introduced in [[intercultural bilingual education]] (IBE) in [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]]. Even in these areas, the governments are reaching only a part of the Quechua-speaking populations. Some indigenous people in each of the countries are having their children study in Spanish for the purposes of social advancement.&lt;ref&gt;Adelaar 2004, pp. 258–259: "The Quechua speakers' wish for social mobility for their children is often heard as an argument for not transmitting the language to the next generation.... As observed quite adequately by [[Rodolfo Cerrón Palomino|Cerrón Palomino]], "Quechua (and [[Aymaran languages|Aymara]]) speakers seem to have taken the project of assimilation begun by the dominating classes and made it their own."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Radio Nacional del Perú]] broadcasts news and agrarian programs in Quechua for periods in the mornings.

Quechua and Spanish are now heavily intermixed in much of the Andean region, with many hundreds of Spanish loanwords in Quechua. Similarly, Quechua phrases and words are commonly used by Spanish speakers. In southern rural Bolivia, for instance, many Quechua words such as ''wawa'' (infant), ''misi'' (cat), ''waska'' (strap or thrashing), are as commonly used as their Spanish counterparts, even in entirely Spanish-speaking areas. Quechua has also had a profound influence on other native languages of the Americas, such as [[Mapuche language|Mapuche]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Number of speakers===
The number of speakers given varies widely according to the sources. The total in ''Ethnologue'' 16 is 10 million, mostly based on figures published 1987–2002, but with a few dating from the 1960s. The figure for Imbabura Highland Quechua in ''Ethnologue'', for example, is 300,000, an estimate from 1977.

The missionary organization FEDEPI, on the other hand, estimated one million Imbabura dialect speakers (published 2006). Census figures are also problematic, due to under-reporting. The 2001 Ecuador census reports only 500,000 Quechua speakers, compared to the estimate in most linguistic sources of more than 2 million. The censuses of Peru (2007) and Bolivia (2001) are thought to be more reliable.

*Argentina: 900,000 (1971)
*Bolivia: 2,100,000 (2001 census); 2,800,000 South Bolivian (1987)
*Chile: few, if any; 8200 in ethnic group (2002 census)
*Colombia: 4,402 to 16,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ling.fi/DICCIONARIO.htm Alain Fabre, Diccionario etnolingüístico y guía bibliográfica de los pubelos indígenas sudamericanos]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ecuador: 2,300,000 (Adelaar 1991)
*Peru: 3,800,000 (2017 census&lt;ref&gt;http://censos2017.inei.gob.pe/redatam/&lt;/ref&gt;); 3,500,000 to 4,400,000 (Adelaar 2000)

Additionally, there are an unknown number of speakers in emigrant communities, including [[Queens]], New York, and [[Paterson, New Jersey]], in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Classification==
[[File:Quechua (subgrupos).svg|thumb|The four branches of Quechua: I (Central), II-A (North Peruvian), II-B (Northern), II-C (Southern)]]

There are significant differences among the varieties of Quechua spoken in the central Peruvian highlands and the peripheral varieties of Ecuador, as well as those of southern Peru and Bolivia. They can be labeled Quechua I (or Quechua B, central) and Quechua II (or Quechua A, peripheral). Within the two groups, there are few sharp boundaries, making them [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]].

But, there is a secondary division in Quechua II between the grammatically simplified northern varieties of Ecuador, Quechua II-B, known there as [[Kichwa language|Kichwa]], and the generally more conservative varieties of the southern highlands, Quechua II-C, which include the old Inca capital of [[Cusco]]. The closeness is at least in part because of the influence of [[Cusco Quechua]] on the Ecuadorean varieties in the Inca Empire. Because Northern nobles were required to educate their children in Cusco, this was maintained as the [[prestige dialect]] in the north.

Speakers from different points within any of the three regions can generally understand one another reasonably well. There are nonetheless significant local-level differences across each. ([[Wanka Quechua]], in particular, has several very distinctive characteristics that make the variety more difficult to understand, even for other Central Quechua speakers.) Speakers from different major regions, particularly Central or Southern Quechua, are not able to communicate effectively.

The lack of [[mutual intelligibility]] among the dialects is the basic criterion that defines Quechua not as a single language, but as a language family. The complex and progressive nature of how speech varies across the dialect continua makes it nearly impossible to differentiate discrete varieties; ''Ethnologue'' lists 45 varieties which are then divided into 2 groups; Central and Peripheral. Due to the non-intelligibility among the 2 groups, they are all classified as separate languages..&lt;ref name=Ethnologue&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=que Ethnologue report for Quechua (macrolanguage) (SIL)]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a reference point, the overall degree of diversity across the family is a little less than that of the [[Romance languages|Romance]] or [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] families, and more of the order of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] or [[Arabic]]. The greatest diversity is within Central Quechua, or Quechua I, which is believed to lie close to the homeland of the ancestral Proto-Quechua language.

===Family tree===
[[Alfredo Torero]] devised the traditional classification, the three divisions above, plus a fourth, a northern or Peruvian branch. The latter causes complications in the classification, however, as the northern dialects ([[Cajamarca–Cañaris Quechua|Cajamarca–Cañaris]], [[Pacaraos Quechua|Pacaraos]], and [[Yauyos–Chincha Quechua|Yauyos–Chincha]]) have features of both Quechua I and Quechua II, and so are difficult to assign to either.

Torero classifies them as the following:

* [[Quechua I]] or ''Quechua B,'' aka ''Central Quechua'' or ''Waywash,'' spoken in Peru's central highlands and coast.
** The most widely spoken varieties are Huaylas, Huaylla Wanca, and Conchucos.
* [[Quechua II]] or ''Quechua A'' or ''Peripheral Quechua'' or ''Wanp'una'', divided into
** Yungay (Yunkay) Quechua or ''Quechua II A,'' spoken in the northern mountains of Peru; the most widely spoken dialect is Cajamarca.
** [[Northern Quechua]] or ''Quechua II B,'' spoken in Ecuador ([[Kichwa language|Kichwa]]), northern Peru, and Colombia ([[Inga Kichwa]])
*** The most widely spoken varieties in this group are Chimborazo Highland Quichua and Imbabura Highland Quichua.
** [[Southern Quechua]] or ''Quechua II C,'' spoken in Bolivia, southern Peru, Chile, and Argentina.
*** The most widely spoken varieties are South Bolivian, Cusco, Ayacucho, and Puno (Collao).

&lt;!-- This schematic was introduced with the summary of Torero above, but it does not reflect Torero's classification, and its origin is not clear.

Landerman (1991) does not believe a truly genetic classification is possible and divides Quechua II so that the family has four geographical–typological branches: Northern, North Peruvian, Central, and Southern. He includes Chachapoyas and Lamas in North Peruvian Quechua so Ecuadorian is synonymous with Northern Quechua.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Landerman, 1991. ''Quechua dialects and their classification.'' PhD dissertation, UCLA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geographical distribution===
Quechua I (Central Quechua, ''Waywash'') is spoken in Peru's central highlands, from the [[Ancash Region]] to [[Huancayo]]. It is the most diverse branch of Quechua,&lt;ref&gt;Lyle Campbell, ''American Indian Languages: The Historical Linguistics of Native America'', Oxford University Press, 1997, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; to the extent that its divisions are commonly considered different languages.

Quechua II (Peripheral Quechua, ''Wamp'una'' "Traveler")
*II-A: Yunkay Quechua (North Peruvian Quechua) is scattered in Peru's occidental highlands
*II-B: Northern Quechua (also known as ''Runashimi'' or, especially in Ecuador, [[Kichwa language|''Kichwa'']]) is mainly spoken in Colombia and Ecuador. It is also spoken in the Amazonian lowlands of Colombia, Ecuador, and in pockets in Peru
*II-C: [[Southern Quechua]], in the highlands further south, from [[Huancavelica]] through the [[Ayacucho]], [[Cusco]], and [[Puno]] regions of [[Peru]], across much of [[Bolivia]], and in pockets in north-western [[Argentina]]. It is the most influential branch, with the largest number of speakers and the most important cultural and literary legacy.

===Quechua and Aymara===
Quechua shares a large amount of vocabulary, and some striking structural parallels, with [[Aymara language|Aymara]], and the two families have sometimes been grouped together as a "[[Quechumaran languages|Quechumaran family]]". That hypothesis is generally rejected by specialists, however. The parallels are better explained by mutual influence and borrowing through intensive and long-term contact. Many Quechua–Aymara cognates are close, often closer than intra-Quechua cognates, and there is little relationship in the [[affix]]al system.

==Vocabulary==
A number of Quechua [[loanword]]s have entered [[English language|English]] via [[Spanish language|Spanish]], including ''[[coca]]'', ''[[condor]]'', ''[[guano]]'', ''[[jerky]]'', ''[[llama]]'', ''[[pampa]]'', ''[[poncho]]'', ''[[puma (genus)|puma]]'', ''[[quinine]]'', ''[[quinoa]]'', ''[[vicuña]]'', and, possibly, ''[[gaucho]]''.  The word ''[[lagniappe]]'' comes from the Quechuan word ''yapay'' ("to increase; to add") with the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] article ''la'' in front of it, ''la yapa'' or ''la ñapa'' in Spanish.

The influence on Latin American Spanish includes such borrowings as ''papa'' for "potato",  ''chuchaqui'' for "hangover" in [[Ecuador]], and diverse borrowings for "[[altitude sickness]]", in [[Bolivia]] from Quechuan ''suruqch'i'' to Bolivian ''sorojchi'', in [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]] ''soroche''.

A rare instance of a Quechua word being taken into general Spanish use is given by ''carpa'' for "tent" (Quechua ''karpa'').&lt;ref&gt;Edward A. Roberts, ''A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the Spanish Language...'', 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bolivia, particularly, Quechua words are used extensively even by non-Quechua speakers. These include wawa (baby, infant), ch'aki (hangover), misi (cat), juk'ucho (mouse), q'omer uchu (green pepper), jacu ("lets go"), chhiri and chhurco (curly haired), among many others. Quechua grammar also enters Bolivian Spanish, such as the use of the suffix -ri. In Bolivian Quechua, -ri is added to verbs to signify an action is performed with affection or, in the imperative, as a rough equivalent to please. In Bolivia -ri is often included in the Spanish imperative to imply "please" or to soften commands. For example, the standard "pásame" (pass me), becomes pasarime.

Quechua has borrowed a large number of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] words, such as ''piru'' (from ''pero'', but), ''bwenu'' (from ''bueno'', good), iskwila (from "escuela," school), waka (from "vaca," cow) and ''burru'' (from ''burro'', donkey).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ru.nl/publish/pages/632031/root_affix_asymmetries.pdf|title=Root/Affix asymmetries in contact and transfer: Case studies from the Andes|last=Muysken|first=Pieter|date=|website=www.ru.nl|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology of Quechua===
At first, Spaniards referred to the language of the Inca empire as the ''lengua general'', the ''general language''. The name ''quichua'' was first used in 1560 by [[Domingo de Santo Tomás]] in his ''Grammatica o arte de la lengua general de los indios de los reynos del Perú''.&lt;ref name=Adelaar179&gt;Adelaar 2004, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known what name the native speakers gave to their language before colonial times and whether it was Spaniards who called it ''quechua''.&lt;ref name=Adelaar179/&gt;

There are two possible etymologies of Quechua as the name of the language. There is a possibility that the name Quechua was derived from ''*qiĉ.wa'', the native word which originally meant the "temperate valley" altitude ecological zone in the Andes (suitable for maize cultivation) and to its inhabitants.&lt;ref name=Adelaar179/&gt;

Alternatively, [[Pedro Cieza de León]] and [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]], the early Spanish chroniclers, mention the existence of a people called Quichua in the present [[Apurímac Region]], and it could be inferred that their name was given to the entire language.&lt;ref name=Adelaar179/&gt;

The Hispanicised spellings ''Quechua'' and ''Quichua'' have been used in Peru and Bolivia since the 17th century, especially after the [[Third Council of Lima]]. Today, the various local pronunciations of "Quechua Simi" include {{IPA-qu|ˈqʰeʃwa&amp;nbsp;ˈsimi|}}, {{IPA-qu|ˈχetʃwa&amp;nbsp;ˈʃimi|}}, {{IPA-qu|ˈkitʃwa&amp;nbsp;ˈʃimi|}}, and {{IPA-qu|ˈʔitʃwa&amp;nbsp;ˈʃimi|}}.

Another name that native speakers give to their own language is ''runa simi'', "language of man/people"; it also seems to have emerged during the colonial period.&lt;ref name=Adelaar179/&gt;

==Phonology==
The description below applies to [[Cusco Quechua]]; there are significant differences in other varieties of Quechua.

===Vowels===
Quechua only has three vowel phonemes: {{IPA|/a/}} {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}, as in Aymara (including [[Jaqaru language|Jaqaru]]). Monolingual speakers pronounce them as {{IPA|[æ, ɪ, ʊ]}} respectively, but [[Spanish language|Spanish]] realizations {{IPA|[ä, i, u]}} may also be found. When the vowels appear adjacent to uvular consonants ({{IPA|/q/}}, {{IPA|/qʼ/}}, and {{IPA|/qʰ/}}), they are rendered more like {{IPA|[ɑ]}}, {{IPA|[ɛ]}} and {{IPA|[ɔ]}}, respectively.

Voicing is not [[phoneme|phonemic]] in the Quechua native vocabulary of the modern Cusco variety.

{{Listen|filename=qu-pata_phata_p'ata.ogg|title=Voiceless bilabial plosives|description=Pronunciation of the voiceless bilabial plosives of Cusco Quechua|format=[[Ogg]]}}

About 30% of the modern Quechua vocabulary is borrowed from Spanish, and some Spanish sounds (such as {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}}) may have become phonemic even among monolingual Quechua-speakers.

[[Cusco Quechua]], [[North Bolivian Quechua|North-]] and [[South Bolivian Quechua|South-Bolivian Quechua]] are the only varieties of Quechua to have glottalized consonants, and they, along with certain kinds of Ecuadorian [[Kichwa language|Kichwa]], are the only varieties with aspirated consonants. Because reflexes of a given Proto-Quechua word may have different stops in neighboring dialects (Proto-Quechua ''čaki'' 'foot' becomes ''č’aki'' and ''čaka'' 'bridge' becomes ''čaka''), they are thought to be innovations in Quechua from [[Aymara language|Aymara]], borrowed independently after branching off from Proto-Quechua.

Gemination of the tap {{IPA|/ɾ/}} results in a trill {{IPA|[r]}}.

===Stress===
Stress is penultimate in most dialects of Quechua. In some varieties, factors such as [[apocope]] of word-final vowels may cause exceptional final stress.

==Orthography==
{{main|Quechua alphabet}}
{{further|Southern Quechua#Standard Quechua|l1=Southern Quechua § Standard Quechua}}

Quechua has been written using the Roman alphabet since the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]]. However, written Quechua is rarely used by Quechua speakers because of the lack of printed&lt;!--hiding this because incomprehensible/illogical: referential --&gt; material in Quechua.

Until the 20th century, Quechua was written with a Spanish-based [[orthography]], for example ''Inca, Huayna Cápac, Collasuyo, Mama Ocllo, Viracocha, quipu, tambo, condor''. This orthography is the most familiar to Spanish speakers and so has been used for most borrowings into English, which essentially always happen through Spanish.

In 1975, the Peruvian government of [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]] adopted a new orthography for Quechua. This is the system preferred by the [[Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua]], which results in the following spellings of the examples listed above: ''Inka, Wayna Qhapaq, Qollasuyu, Mama Oqllo, Wiraqocha, khipu, tampu, kuntur''. This orthography has the following features:
* It uses  '''w''' instead of ''hu'' for {{IPA|/w/}}.
* It distinguishes velar ''k'' from uvular ''q'', both of which were spelled ''c'' or ''qu'' in the traditional system.{{Examples}}
* It distinguishes simple, ejective, and aspirated stops in dialects (such as that of the [[Cusco Region]]) that make these distinctions, e.g. the aspirated ''khipu'' above.
* It continues to use the Spanish five-vowel system.

In 1985, a variation of this system was adopted by the Peruvian government that uses the Quechuan three-vowel system, resulting in the following spellings: ''Inka, Wayna Qhapaq, Qullasuyu, Mama Uqllu, Wiraqucha, khipu, tampu, kuntur''.

The different orthographies are still highly controversial in Peru. Advocates of the traditional system believe that the new orthographies look too foreign and believe that it makes Quechua harder to learn for people who have first been exposed to written Spanish. Those who prefer the new system maintain that it better matches the phonology of Quechua, and they point to studies showing that teaching the five-vowel system to children later causes reading difficulties in Spanish.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

For more on this, see [[Quechuan and Aymaran spelling shift]].

Writers differ in the treatment of Spanish loanwords. These are sometimes adapted to the modern orthography and sometimes left as in Spanish. For instance, "I am Roberto" could be written ''Robertom kani'' or ''Ruwirtum kani''. (The ''-m'' is not part of the name; it is an evidential suffix, showing how the information is known: firsthand, in this case.)

The Peruvian linguist [[Rodolfo Cerrón Palomino]] has proposed an orthographic norm for all of [[Southern Quechua]]: this Standard Quechua (''el Quechua estándar'' or ''Hanan Runasimi'') conservatively integrates features of the two widespread dialects [[Ayacucho Quechua]] and [[Cusco Quechua]]. For instance:&lt;ref&gt;To listen to recordings of these and many other words as pronounced in many different Quechua-speaking regions, see the external website [http://www.quechua.org.uk/Eng/Sounds The Sounds of the Andean Languages]. It also has an entire section on the new [http://www.quechua.org.uk/Eng/Sounds/Home/HomeSpelling.htm Quechua and Aymara Spelling].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish-based orthography is now in conflict with Peruvian law. According to article 20 of the decree ''Decreto Supremo No 004-2016-MC'', which approves regulations relative to Law 29735, published in the  official newspaper El Peruano on July 22, 2016, adequate spellings of the [[toponym]]s in the normalized alphabets of the indigenous languages must progressively be proposed, with the aim of standardizing the spellings used by the National Geographic Institute ''(Instituto Geográfico Nacional, IGN)'' The IGN implements the necessary changes on the official maps of Peru.&lt;ref name=decree&gt;{{cite web |url=http://busquedas.elperuano.com.pe/normaslegales/decreto-supremo-que-aprueba-el-reglamento-de-la-ley-n-29735-decreto-supremo-n-004-2016-mc-1407753-5/|title=Decreto Supremo que aprueba el Reglamento de la Ley N° 29735, Ley que regula el uso, preservación, desarrollo, recuperación, fomento y difusión de las lenguas originarias del Perú, Decreto Supremo N° 004-2016-MC|last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=July 10, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==

===Morphological type===
Quechua is an agglutinating language. Words are built up from basic roots followed by several suffixes which each carry one meaning. All varieties of Quechua are very regular [[agglutinative language]]s, as opposed to [[isolating language|isolating]] or [[fusional language|fusional]] ones  [Thompson]. Their normal sentence order is SOV ([[subject–object–verb]]). Their large number of [[suffix]]es changes both the overall significance of words and their subtle shades of meaning.  Notable grammatical features include bipersonal [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] (verbs agree with both subject and object), [[evidentiality]] (indication of the source and veracity of knowledge), a set of [[topic (linguistics)|topic]] [[grammatical particle|particles]], and suffixes indicating who benefits from an action and the speaker's attitude toward it, but some languages and varieties may lack some of the characteristics.

===Pronouns===

In Quechua, there are seven [[pronoun]]s. Quechua has two first-person plural pronouns ("we" in English). One is called the [[clusivity|inclusive]], which is used if the speaker wishes to include the [[addressee]] ("we and you"). The other form is called the exclusive, which is used when the addressee is excluded ("we without you"). Quechua also adds the suffix ''-kuna'' to the second and third person singular pronouns ''qam'' and ''pay'' to create the plural forms, ''qam-kuna'' and ''pay-kuna''.

===Adjectives===
[[Adjective]]s in Quechua are always placed before nouns. They lack gender and number and are not declined to agree with [[noun|substantives]].

===Numbers===
*[[Cardinal number (linguistics)|Cardinal number]]s. ''ch'usaq'' (0), ''huk'' (1), ''iskay'' (2), ''kimsa'' (3), ''tawa'' (4), ''pichqa'' (5), ''suqta'' (6), ''qanchis'' (7), ''pusaq'' (8), ''isqun'' (9), ''chunka'' (10), ''chunka hukniyuq'' (11), ''chunka iskayniyuq'' (12), ''iskay chunka'' (20), ''pachak'' (100), ''waranqa'' (1,000), ''hunu'' (1,000,000), ''lluna'' (1,000,000,000,000).
*Ordinal numbers. To form ordinal numbers, the word ''ñiqin'' is put after the appropriate cardinal number (''iskay ñiqin'' = "second"). The only exception is that, in addition to ''huk ñiqin'' ("first"), the phrase ''ñawpaq'' is also used in the somewhat more restricted sense of "the initial, primordial, the oldest".

===Nouns===
[[Noun]] roots accept suffixes that indicate [[grammatical person|person]] (defining of possession, not identity), [[grammatical number|number]], and [[grammatical case|case]]. In general, the personal suffix precedes that of number. In the [[Santiago del Estero]] variety, however, the order is reversed.&lt;ref&gt;

===Adverbs===
[[Adverb]]s can be formed by adding ''-ta'' or, in some cases, ''-lla'' to an adjective: ''allin – allinta'' ("good – well"), ''utqay – utqaylla'' ("quick – quickly"). They are also formed by adding suffixes to [[demonstrative]]s: ''chay'' ("that") – ''chaypi'' ("there"), ''kay'' ("this") – ''kayman'' ("hither").

There are several original adverbs. For Europeans, it is striking that the adverb ''qhipa'' means both "behind" and "future" and ''ñawpa'' means "ahead, in front" and "past".&lt;ref&gt;This occurs in English, where "before" means "in the past", and Shakespeare's Macbeth says "The greatest is behind", meaning in the future.&lt;/ref&gt; Local and temporal concepts of adverbs in Quechua (as well as in [[Aymara language|Aymara]]) are associated to each other reversely, compared to European languages. For the speakers of Quechua, we are moving backwards into the future (we cannot see it: it is unknown), facing the past (we can see it: it is remembered).

===Verbs===
The infinitive forms (unconjugated) have the suffix ''-y'' (''much'a''= "kiss"; ''much'a-y'' = "to kiss"). These are the endings for the indicative:

|}

The suffixes shown in the table above usually indicate the [[grammatical subject|subject]]; the person of the [[grammatical object|object]] is also indicated by a suffix (''-a-'' for first person and ''-su-'' for second person), which precedes the suffixes in the table. In such cases, the plural suffixes from the table (''-chik'' and ''-ku'') can be used to express the number of the object rather than the subject.

Various suffixes are added to the stem to change the meaning. For example, ''-chi'' is a causative and  ''-ku'' is a reflexive (example: ''wañuy'' = "to die"; ''wañuchiy'' = to kill ''wañuchikuy'' = "to commit suicide"); ''-naku'' is used for mutual action (example: ''marq'ay''= "to hug"; ''marq'anakuy''= "to hug each other"), and ''-chka'' is a progressive, used for an ongoing action (e.g., ''mikhuy'' = "to eat"; ''mikhuchkay'' = "to be eating").

===Grammatical particles===
[[Grammatical particle|Particles]] are indeclinable: they do not accept suffixes. They are relatively rare, but the most common are ''arí'' ("yes") and ''mana'' ("no"), although ''mana'' can take some suffixes, such as ''-n''/''-m'' (''manan''/''manam''), ''-raq'' (''manaraq'', not yet) and ''-chu'' (''manachu?'', or not?), to intensify the meaning. Also used are ''yaw'' ("hey", "hi"), and certain loan words from Spanish, such as ''piru'' (from Spanish ''pero'' "but") and ''sinuqa'' (from ''sino'' "rather").

===Evidentiality===
The Quechuan languages have three different morphemes that mark [[evidentiality]].  Evidentiality refers to a morpheme whose primary purpose is to indicate the source of information.&lt;ref&gt;Aikhenvald 2004, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Quechuan languages, evidentiality is a three-term system: there are three evidential morphemes that mark varying levels of source information. The markers can apply to the first, second, and third persons.&lt;ref name="Aikhenvald 2004, p. 377"&gt;Aikhenvald 2004, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; The chart below depicts an example of these morphemes from [[Wanka Quechua]]:&lt;ref&gt;Aikhenvald 2004, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Evidential morphemes ||''-m(i)'' || ''-chr(a)'' || ''-sh(i)''
|-
| Meaning || Direct evidence || Inferred; conjecture || Reported; hearsay
|}

The parentheses around the vowels indicate that the vowel can be dropped in when following an open vowel. For the sake of cohesiveness, the above forms are used to discuss the evidential morphemes. However, it should be noted that there are dialectal variations to the forms. The variations will be presented in the following descriptions.

The following sentences provide examples of the three evidentials and further discuss the meaning behind each of them.

====''-m(i)'' : Direct evidence and commitment&lt;ref&gt;Floyd 1999, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;====
Regional variations: In [[Cusco Quechua]], the direct evidential presents itself as ''–mi''  and ''–n''.

The evidential ''–mi'' indicates that the speaker has a "strong personal conviction the veracity of the circumstance expressed."&lt;ref&gt;Floyd 1999, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has the basis of direct personal experience.

I saw them with my own eyes.

====''-chr(a)'' : Inference and attenuation&lt;ref&gt;Floyd 1999, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;====

In Quechuan languages, not specified by the source, the inference morpheme appears as ''–ch(i), -ch(a), -chr(a)''.

The ''–chr(a)'' evidential indicates that the utterance is an inference or form of conjecture. That inference relays the speaker’s non-commitment to the truth-value of the statement. It also appears in cases such as acquiescence, irony, interrogative constructions, and first person inferences. These uses constitute nonprototypical use and will be discussed later in the ''changes in meaning and other uses'' section.

|}
I think they will probably come back.

====''-sh(i)'' : Hearsay&lt;ref&gt;Floyd 1999, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;====
Regional variations: It can appear as ''–sh(i)'' or ''–s(i)'' depending on the dialect.

With the use of this morpheme, the speaker "serves as a conduit through which information from another source passes." The information being related is hearsay or revelatory in nature. It also works to express the uncertainty of the speaker regarding the situation. However, it also appears in other constructions that are discussed in the ''changes in meaning'' section.

(I was told) Shanti borrowed it.

Hintz discusses an interesting case of evidential behavior found in the Sihaus dialect of [[Ancash Quechua]]. The author postulates that instead of three single evidential markers, that Quechuan language contains three pairs of evidential markers.&lt;ref&gt;Hintz 1999, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Affix or clitic====
It may have been noted the evidential morphemes have been referred to as markers or morphemes. The literature seems to differ on whether or not the evidential morphemes are acting as affixes or clitics, in some cases, such as Wanka Quechua, enclitics. Lefebvre and Muysken (1998) discuss this issue in terms of case but remark the line between affix and clitic is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre &amp; Muysken 1998, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Both terms are used interchangeably throughout these sections.

====Position in the sentence====
Evidentials in the Quechuan languages are "second position enclitics", which usually attach to the first constituent in the sentence, as shown in this example.&lt;ref&gt;Aikhenvald 2004, p. 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt;
{|
|-
| ''huk-'''si''''' || ''ka-sqa'' || ''huk'' || ''machucha-piwan'' || ''payacha''
|-
| once-&lt;small&gt;REP&lt;/small&gt; || be-&lt;small&gt;SD&lt;/small&gt; || one || old.man-&lt;small&gt;WITH&lt;/small&gt; || woman
|}
Once, there were an old man and an old woman.

They can, however, also occur on a focused constituent.
{|
|-
| ''Pidru'' || ''kunana-'''mi''''' || ''wasi-ta'' || ''tuwa-sha-n''
|-
| Pedro || now-&lt;small&gt;DIR.EV&lt;/small&gt; || house-&lt;small&gt;ACC&lt;/small&gt; || build-&lt;small&gt;PROG&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;3SG&lt;/small&gt;
|}
It is now that Pedro is building the house.

Sometimes, the affix is described as attaching to the focus, particularly in the Tarma dialect of [[Yaru Quechua]],&lt;ref&gt;Weber 1986, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; but this does not hold true for all varieties of Quechua. In Huanuco Quechua, the evidentials may follow any number of topics, marked by the topic marker ''–qa'', and the element with the evidential must precede the main verb or be the main verb.

However, there are exceptions to that rule, and the more topics there are in a sentence, the more likely the sentence is to deviate from the usual pattern.
{|
|-
| ''Chawrana-qa'' || ''puntataruu-qu'' || ''trayaruptin-qa'' || ''wamrata-qa'' || ''mayna-'''shi''''' || ''Diosninchi-qa'' || ''heqarkaykachisha'' || ''syelutana-shi''
|-
| so:already-&lt;small&gt;TOP&lt;/small&gt; || at:the:peak-&lt;small&gt;TOP&lt;/small&gt; || arriving-&lt;small&gt;TOP&lt;/small&gt; || child-&lt;small&gt;TOP&lt;/small&gt; || already-&lt;small&gt;IND&lt;/small&gt; || our:God-&lt;small&gt;TOP&lt;/small&gt; || had:taken:her:up || to:heaven:already-&lt;small&gt;IND&lt;/small&gt;
|}
When she (the witch) reached the peak, God had already taken the child up into heaven.

====Changes in meaning and other uses====
Evidentials can be used to relay different meanings depending on the context and perform other functions. The following examples are restricted to Wanka Quechua.

'''''The direct evidential, -mi'''''

The direct evidential appears in wh-questions and yes/no questions. By considering the direct evidential in terms of prototypical semantics, it seems somewhat counterintuitive to have a direct evidential, basically an evidential that confirms the speaker’s certainty about a topic, in a question. However, if one focuses less on the structure and more on the situation, some sense can be made. The speaker is asking the addressee for information so the speaker assumes the speaker knows the answer. That assumption is where the direct evidential comes into play. The speaker holds a certain amount of certainty that the addressee will know the answer. The speaker interprets the addressee as being in "direct relation" to the proposed content; the situation is the same as when, in regular sentences, the speaker assumes direct relation to the proposed information.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd 1999, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;
{|
|-
| ''imay-'''mi''''' || ''wankayuu-pu'' || ''kuti-mu-la''
|-
| when-&lt;small&gt;DIR&lt;/small&gt; || Huancayo-&lt;small&gt;ABL&lt;/small&gt; || return-&lt;small&gt;AFAR&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;PAST&lt;/small&gt;
|}
When did he come back from Huancayo?

(Floyd 1999, p. 85)

The direct evidential affix is also seen in yes/no questions, similar to the situation with wh-questions. Floyd describes yes/no questions as being "characterized as instructions to the addressee to assert one of the propositions of a disjunction."&lt;ref&gt;Floyd 1999, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, the burden of direct evidence is being placed on the addressee, not on the speaker. The question marker in Wanka Quechua, ''-chun'', is derived from the negative –chu marker and the direct evidential (realized as –n in some dialects).
{|
|-
| ''tarma-kta'' || ''li-n-'''chun'''''
|-
| Tarma-&lt;small&gt;ACC&lt;/small&gt; || go-&lt;small&gt;3&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;YN&lt;/small&gt;
|}
Is he going to Tarma?

(Floyd 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;89)

====Inferential evidential, -chr(a)====

While ''–chr(a)'' is usually used in an inferential context, it has some non-prototypical uses.

''Mild Exhortation''
In these constructions the evidential works to reaffirm and encourage the addressee’s actions or thoughts.
{|
|-
| ''mas'' || ''kalu-kuna-kta'' || ''li-la-a'' || ''ni-nki-'''chra'''-ri''
|-
| more || far-&lt;small&gt;PL&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;ACC&lt;/small&gt; || go-&lt;small&gt;PST&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;1&lt;/small&gt; || say-&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;CONJ&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;EMPH&lt;/small&gt;
|}
Yes, tell them, "I've gone farther."

(Floyd 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;107)

This example comes from a conversation between husband and wife, discussing the reactions of their family and friends after they have been gone for a while. The husband says he plans to stretch the truth and tell them about distant places to which he has gone, and his wife (in the example above) echoes and encourages his thoughts.

''Acquiescence''
With these, the evidential is used to highlight the speaker’s assessment of inevitability of an event and acceptance of it. There is a sense of resistance, diminished enthusiasm, and disinclination in these constructions.
{|
|-
| ''paaga-lla-shrayki-'''chra'''-a''
|-
| pay-&lt;small&gt;POL&lt;/small&gt;-1›2&lt;small&gt;FUT&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;CONJ&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;EMPH&lt;/small&gt;
|}
I suppose I'll pay you then.

(Floyd 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;109)

This example comes from a discourse where a woman demands compensation from the man (the speaker in the example) whose pigs ruined her potatoes. He denies the pigs as being his but finally realizes he may be responsible and produces the above example.

''Interrogative''
Somewhat similar to the ''–mi'' evidential, the inferential evidential can be found in content questions. However, the salient difference between the uses of the evidentials in questions is that in the ''–m(i)'' marked questions, an answer is expected. That is not the case with ''–chr(a)'' marked questions.
{|
|-
| ''ima-lla-kta-'''chr''''' || ''u-you-shrun'' || ''llapa'' || ''ayllu-kuna-kta-si'' || ''chra-alu-l''
|-
| what-&lt;small&gt;LIM&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;ACC&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;CONJ&lt;/small&gt; || give-&lt;small&gt;ASP&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;12FUT&lt;/small&gt; || all || family-&lt;small&gt;PL&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;ACC&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;EVEN&lt;/small&gt; || arrive-&lt;small&gt;ASP&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;SS&lt;/small&gt;
|}
I wonder what we will give our families when we arrive.

(Floyd 1999, p. 111)

''Irony''
Irony in language can be a somewhat complicated topic in how it functions differently in languages, and by its semantic nature, it is already somewhat vague.  For these purposes, it is suffice to say that when irony takes place in Wanka Quechua, the ''–chr(a)'' marker is used.

{|
|-
| ''chay-nuu-pa-'''chr''''' || ''yachra-nki''
|-
| that-&lt;small&gt;SIM&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;GEN&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;CONJ&lt;/small&gt; || know-&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; 
|}
(I suppose) That's how you learn [that is the way in which you will learn].

(Floyd 199, p.&amp;nbsp;115)

This example comes from discourse between a father and daughter about her refusal to attend school. It can be interpreted as a genuine statement (perhaps one can learn by resisting school) or as an ironic statement (that is an absurd idea).

====Hearsay evidential, -sh(i)====

Aside from being used to express hearsay and revelation, this affix also has other uses.

''Folktales, myths, and legends''

Because folktales, myths, and legends are, in essence, reported speech, it follows that the hearsay marker would be used with them.  Many of these types of stories are passed down through generations, furthering this aspect of reported speech. A difference between simple hearsay and folktales can be seen in the frequency of the ''–sh(i)'' marker.  In normal conversation using reported speech, the marker is used less, to avoid redundancy.

''Riddles''

Riddles are somewhat similar to myths and folktales in that their nature is to be passed by word of mouth.
{|
|-
| ''ima-lla-'''shi''''' || ''ayka-lla-'''sh''''' || ''juk'' || ''machray-chru'' || ''puñu-ya-n'' || ''puka'' || ''waaka''
|-
| what-&lt;small&gt;LIM&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;REP&lt;/small&gt; || how^much-&lt;small&gt;LIM&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;REP&lt;/small&gt; || one || cave-&lt;small&gt;LOC&lt;/small&gt; || sleep-&lt;small&gt;IMPF&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;3&lt;/small&gt; || red || cow
|}

(Floyd 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;142)

====Omission and overuse of evidential affixes====

In certain grammatical structures, the evidential marker does not appear at all. In all Quechuan languages the evidential will not appear in a dependent clause. Sadly, no example was given to depict this omission.&lt;ref&gt;Aikhenvald 2004, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;
Omissions occur in Quechua. The sentence is understood to have the same evidentiality as the other sentences in the context. Quechuan speakers vary as to how much they omit evidentials, but they occur only in connected speech.&lt;ref&gt;Aikhenvald 2004, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

An interesting contrast to omission of evidentials is overuse of evidentials. If a speaker uses evidentials too much with no reason, competence is brought into question.  For example, the overuse of –m(i) could lead others to believe that the speaker is not a native speaker or, in some extreme cases, that one is mentally ill.&lt;ref name="Aikhenvald 2004, p. 377"/&gt;

====Cultural aspect====

By using evidentials, the Quechua culture has certain assumptions about the information being relayed. Those who do not abide by the cultural customs should not be trusted. A passage from Weber (1986) summarizes them nicely below:
# (Only) one’s experience is reliable.
# Avoid unnecessary risk by assuming responsibility for information of which one is not absolutely certain.
# Do not be gullible. There are many folktales in which the villain is foiled by his gullibility.
#Assume responsibility only if it is safe to do so. Successful assumption of responsibility builds stature in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Aikhenvald 2004, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidentials also show that being precise and stating the source of one’s information is extremely important in the language and the culture. Failure to use them correctly can lead to diminished standing in the community. Speakers are aware of the evidentials and even use proverbs to teach children the importance of being precise and truthful. Precision and information source are of the utmost importance. They are a powerful and resourceful method of human communication.&lt;ref&gt;Aikhenvald 2004, p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
Although the body of literature in Quechua is not as sizable as its historical and current prominence would suggest, it is nevertheless not negligible.

As in the case of the [[List of pre-Columbian cultures|pre-Columbian Mesoamerica]], there are a number of surviving Andean documents in the local language that were written down in Latin characters after the European conquest, but they express, to a great extent, the culture of pre-Conquest times. That type of Quechua literature is somewhat scantier, but nevertheless significant. It includes the so-called [[Huarochirí Manuscript]] (1598), describing the mythology and religion of the valley of [[Huarochirí Province|Huarochirí]] as well as Quechua poems quoted within the Spanish-language texts of some chronicles dealing with the pre-Conquest period. There are a number of anonymous or signed Quechua dramas dating from the post-conquest period (starting from the 17th century), some of which deal with the Inca era, while most are on religious topics and of European inspiration. The most famous dramas is ''[[Ollantay]]'' and the plays describing the death of [[Atahualpa]]. For example, [[Juan de Espinosa Medrano]] wrote several dramas in the language. Poems in Quechua were also composed during the colonial period.&lt;ref name=adelaar254/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robert_beer/history.htm |title=History |publisher=Homepage.ntlworld.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515235927/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robert_beer/history.htm |archive-date=2013-05-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dramas and poems continued to be written in the 19th and especially in 20th centuries as well; in addition, in the 20th century and more recently, more prose has been published. However, few literary forms were made present in the 19th century as European influences limited literary criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Carnival Theater: Uruguay's Popular Performers and National Culture&lt;/ref&gt; While some of that literature consists of original compositions (poems and dramas), the bulk of 20th century Quechua literature consists of traditional folk stories and oral narratives.&lt;ref name=adelaar254&gt;Adelaar 2004, pp. 254–256.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johnny Payne]] has translated two sets of Quechua oral short stories, one into Spanish and the other into English.

Many Andean musicians write and sing in their native languages, including Quechua and Aymara. Notable musical groups are [[Los Kjarkas]], [[Kala Marka]], [[J'acha Mallku]], [[Savia Andina]], Wayna Picchu, Wara and many others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1171">In certain theories of [[syntax]], an '''R-expression''' (short for ''referring expression'') is a category in the three-way classification of [[noun phrases]] in binding theory, the other two being [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphors]] and [[pronominal]]s. According to [[principle C]] of binding theory, R-expressions must be free. R-expressions include names (e.g. Mary, John) and definite DPs (e.g. the cat).&lt;ref&gt;[[David Crystal]]; A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chomsky]]'s [[government and binding theory]], an R-expression is an overt NP analysed as [-a. -p] (not anaphor and not pronominal), and hence subject only to Principle C of the Binding Theory, namely, that it be free (unbound) in all domains. Examples of typical R-expressions are "Lisa", "the dog", "my pet unicorn", "the last chapter of the book", and "Janel's cigarettes". The name is derived from the phrase ''[[referring expression]]'', used in semantics for the largest class of NPs, but the GB usage is not synonymous with the semantic sense.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5808">'''Spinning cone''' columns are used in a form of low temperature vacuum [[steam distillation]] to gently extract volatile chemicals from liquid foodstuffs while minimising the effect on the taste of the product. For instance, the columns can be used to remove some of the [[alcohol]] from wine, 'off' smells from cream, and to capture [[aroma compound]]s that would otherwise be lost in [[coffee processing]].

==Mechanism==
The columns are made of stainless steel.  Conical vanes are attached alternately to the wall of the column and to a central rotating shaft.  The product is poured in at the top under vacuum, and steam is pumped into the column from below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = How does the SCC work? | publisher =  FT Technologies | url = http://www.ft-tech.net/Technologies/Spinning_Cone_Column/how-does-scc-work.html | accessdate =  2007-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vanes provide a large surface area over which volatile compounds can evaporate into the steam, and the rotation ensures a thin layer of the product is constantly moved over the moving cone.  It typically takes 20 seconds for the liquid to move through the column, and industrial columns might process 16-160 litres per minute. The temperature and pressure can be adjusted depending on the compounds targeted.

==Wine controversy==
Improvements in [[viticulture]] and warmer vintages have led to increasing levels of sugar in wine grapes, which have translated to higher levels of alcohol - which can reach over 15% [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]] in [[Zinfandel]]s from [[California wine|California]]. Some producers feel that this unbalances their wine, and use spinning cones to reduce the alcohol by 1-2 percentage points.  In this case the wine is passed through the column once to distill out the most volatile aroma compounds which are then put to one side while the wine goes through the column a second time at higher temperature to extract alcohol. The aroma compounds are then mixed back into the wine. Some producers such as Joel Peterson of Ravenswood argue that technological "fixes" such as spinning cones remove a sense of [[terroir]] from the wine; if the wine has the tannins and other components to balance 15% alcohol, Peterson argues that it should be accepted on its own terms.&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Peterson| first = Joel | title = To knock all high-alcohol wines is just simplistic  | journal = Decanter | issue = December 2007 |page=8  | publisher = IPC | location = UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of spinning cones, and other technologies such as reverse osmosis, was banned in the EU until recently, although for many years they could freely be used in wines imported into the EU from certain New World wine producing countries such as Australia and the USA.&lt;ref name="Smithers"&gt;{{cite news | last=Smithers | first=Rebecca | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/03/drink.foodanddrink | title=Low-alcohol 'Chateau D'Orking' falls foul of the rules | date=2007-11-03 | accessdate=2008-01-12 | location=London | work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2007, the Wine Standards Branch (WSB) of the UK's [[Food Standards Agency]] banned the sale of a wine called Sovio,&lt;ref name="Smithers" /&gt; made from Spanish grapes that would normally produce wines of 14% ABV.&lt;ref name="Clement"&gt;{{cite web | last=Clement | first=Sandra | url=http://www.thirtyfifty.co.uk/wine-news-detail.asp?id=217 | title=Spinning cone in Spain could open doors for lower-alcohol wines | date=2007-08-07 | accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sovio runs 40-50% of the wine over spinning cones to reduce the alcohol content to 8%, which means that under EU law it could not be sold as wine as it was below 8.5%; above that, under the rules prevailing at the time, it would be banned because spinning cones could not be used in EU winemaking.&lt;ref name="Clement"/&gt;

Subsequently, the EU legalized dealcoholization with a 2% adjustment limit in its Code of Winemaking Practices, publishing that in its Commission Regulation (EC No. 606 of 10 July 2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EC No. 606|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:193:0001:0059:EN:PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stipulating that the dealcoholization must be accomplished by "physical separation techniques" which would embrace the spinning cone method.

More recently, in International Wine Organization Resolutions OIV-OENO 394A-2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OIV Resolution OENO 394A-2012|url=http://www.oiv.int/oiv/files/3%20.../2012/OIV-OENO%20394A-2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and OIV-OENO 394B-2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OIV Resolution OENO 394B-2012|url=http://www.oiv.int/oiv/files/3%20.../2012/OIV-OENO%20394B-2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; of June 22, 2012 EU recommended winemaking procedures were modified to permit use of the spinning cone column and membrane techniques such as reverse osmosis on wine, subject to a 20% limitation on the adjustment.  That limitation is currently under review following the proposal by some EU members that it be eliminated altogether. The limitation is applicable only to products formally labeled as "wine".

'''Szathmári Sándor''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈsɒtmaːri ˈʃaːndor|lang}}; 19 June 1897 – 16 July 1974) was a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] writer, [[mechanical engineer]], [[Esperanto|Esperantist]], and one of the leading figures in [[Esperanto]] literature.
&lt;!-- the magazine Esperanto 11/1974 (827) states, that he passed away 27 September 1974.--&gt;

== Biography ==

===Family background===

Szathmári was born in [[Gyula, Hungary|Gyula]]. His father – also called Sándor – studied law, later became a state official, and, besides his work, wrote lawbooks, in his leisure played the [[violin]] and painted. His father, the first intellectual in the family, and his ancestors spelled the family name with a y (Szathmáry).

Szathmári's grandfather was a woodworker, who in his time gave 100 forints for the founding of a local music school.

Szathmári's mother (Losonczy-Szíjjártó Margit) came from a pharmacist family in the city of [[Szeghalom]], where she was the sole daughter of the family and lived well. She bore 11 children, of whom only seven grew to adulthood.

=== Early life ===
Szathmári's father was an official of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and the family moved often, living in [[Gyula, Hungary|Gyula]], [[Szombathely]], [[Dolný Kubín|Alsókubin]], [[Sfântu Gheorghe|Sepsiszentgyörgy]], and [[Lugoj|Lugos]] during Szathmári's early years.

=== Illnesses and bodily passivity ===
The young Szathmári was sickly with a weak body and a sensitive nervous system up through his fifteenth year. He did not like wrestling, wild games, and punching.  The youth suffered almost continually from angina; he was also tormented by [[typhus]], [[measles]], [[chickenpox]], [[whooping cough]], [[diphtheria]], and [[sinusitis]].

=== Szathmari and his family ===

According to a fragment of an unpublished biography (manuscript: ''Hogy is volt hát?'' ~So how did it happen?): his grandfather wanted to train and educate him in patriotism and nationalism, but was unsuccessful.  „..my grandfather told me the anecdote in which the gypsy asked to be shown the enemy before a battle, because he wanted to make peace with them.  At that time I thought the anecdote true, and considered the gypsys more advanced, being they were only ones able to think right.”

On the death of his two older brothers, he became the eldest child (the fourth sibling died later), who often had to take care of the younger ones.  That task quite exhausted him, and when the five-month-old little brother John died of [[meningitis]], he went into shock.  "The weeping suddenly weakened and finally stopped.  After a few minutes pause I heard my father's voice: When will we bury this child?" For a long time after that he was unable to sleep peacefully.

=== School, studies ===

Attending the first class in elementary school he did all the exercises in his mathematics text in one week, without knowing the formulas. He was very apt, once smarter than his teacher, which led to his teacher giving him a failing grade to make him repeat the school year.  
Happily, those in charge of the examinations to be repeated let him through.  This conduct, which he never forgot for the rest of his life, greatly affected him.  He called such people 
'muscle-fools'.

He was also very capable in other natural sciences such as physics and chemistry.  He had a good imagination, liked to experiment and wanted to become an engineer.
He graduated in Lugos (now Lugoj, [[Romania]]) and in 1915 enrolled in the mechanical engineering program at the [[Technical University of Budapest]] (Hungary), but found that very boring and thought-limiting. During his studies – under wartime conditions – he never had enough money, and was continually hungry. He took  a break from his studies during 1919-1921 and returned to Lugos. In the beginning he wanted to leave Budapest only provisionally because of the communist rule, but an opportunity to teach students at home developed.

The Romanian government (Lugos belonged to Romania after the [[Treaty of Trianon]]) made life increasingly difficult for the Hungarians and Hungarian officials.  In 1921, Szathmári's father has to choose whether to continue serving the Romanian government or to travel to Hungary.  The father stayed with the six children and undertook a humiliating process: he became a Romanian official, which cost him the sympathy of his acquaintances, the local Hungarians.  Although he aimed to save his family from misery, the Romanian government retired him and forgot to pay his pension.

Because of his family's misery, his siblings did not get an opportunity to study at a college or university and even Szathmári himself had frequently to interrupt his studies to help his family.  He began working in 1920 in the [[Ruskica]] marble mine as a technician.  There he noticed that the mine was tricking the workers by paying a single banknote to three workers.  The workers had to travel – out of their own money and time – to the bank to get change there.  He protested, and received his salary precisely, but did not dare further to make waves.

Although the Hungarian army six times found him unsuitable for recruitment, the Romanian army required him to enlist first time around.  He decided to return to Hungary and finish his studies.  In the spring of 1921 he returned and was approved for a tuition waver.  He completed his studies after five years in 1926.  During the period 1921-1922 he lived in misery, was continually hungry, and often homeless or living in unheated mass accommodations.

In 1923 he worked in Gyula as an office worker and lived with relatives (earlier he took gravely ill and was hospitalized).  In July 1923 his father died.  He lived in actual student 
housing between 1924 and 1926.  Later he studied next to his work in the [[Gschwindt]] plant, and afterwards in the Martin-and-Sigray plant.  Starting in 1924 he worked at [[MÁVAG]], railway machinery plant, and began his true professional life.

==== Politics while a student ====

During his studies, he participated in the association [[Székely Egyetemi és Foiskolai Hallgatók 
Egyesülete]] (SZEFHE, Association of Students of the Sikuly University and Institutions of Higher Learning), where he became acquainted with the movements of the [[Habsburgellenes Liga]] (Anti-Habsburg League) and the Association of Bartha Miklós ([[BARTHA Miklós Társaság]])
When [[Karl I of Austria|Charles IV]] wanted to retake the Hungarian throne in 1921, the young people took up arms at the call of the Association of Students of the Sikuly University and Institutions of Higher Learning and awaited battle at [[Kelenföld]], but without adequate ammunition.  Against the modern German machine gun Szathmari received not one cartridge.

== Professional life ==

From 1924 to 1957 he worked as an engineer at the Hungarian State Wagonworks (Hungarian acronym: MÁVAG) in the Hungarian ministry of heavy industry and in the project bureau.

== Spiritual development ==

=== Esperanto ===

In the empire the family most often worked among minorities (Slovaks in Alsókubin; Romanians and Germans in Lugos).  So the young Szathmari was struck early with the problem of interethnic communication (some Slovaks, for example, laughed at him, when he didn't understand them at the border of a stream).  He then felt himself already an Esperantist in spirit, since he began wishing for a language that would bind the ethnic groups together.

In a bookshop in Lugos he espied an [[Esperanto grammar]] and bought it.  In fact, learning it began only in 1919, when he returned to Lugos, where he organized the Széchenyi Circle (pron. Se’tsenyi), which was the basis of the Free Organization of Christian-socialist Students.   With his friends in the circle he went about learning [[Zamenhof]]'s language (Esperanto), but without a teacher that was not very successful.  He became a speaker of the language starting in 1935, when he participated in the a workers' culture course in Budapest, taught by the famous Esperantist poet [[Emeriko Baranyai]], who helped Szathmári find his way to [[Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda|SAT]], of which he remained a member until died at [[Budapest]] in 1974.

=== Other ideologies ===

Szathmári became acquainted with [[Christian-socialist]] ideas in 1918.  He believed in [[Jesus]], but did not attend churches, which was the result of the non-attentive behaviour of his father.  When the family lived in Szombathely, his father wanted to enrol him in the Roman Catholic School, because it was the closest.  But the school was one-denominational and did not want to admit the youth, since he was not Roman Catholic.  „Well, how about if we baptise him Catholic? – asked my father.”  The instructors were surprised, but were glad that a new lamb had come to the flock.  Even the bishop nodded assent, but the baptism did not occur, still he was allowed to study in the elementary school.  (Szathmari remained reformed for life, and when he was buried, the services were even led by a reformed pastor.)

When the family moved to Alsókubin, the Lutheran pastor explained that up till then he had learned only error, and that fortunately he could become acquainted with the true religion Although he left the church, his faith in Jesus remained, whose teachings he valued highly.

=== Politics after his studies ===

In the middle of the 1920s he discovered the ideas of [[Szabó Dezso]] (sAbo’ dejo’) and spent a bit of time on the ideological right.  Because he was the chief secretary of the Anti-Habsburg League, his landlord evicted him. He was managing director during 1932-1933 of the BARTHA Miklós Association.

Beginning in 1935 he worked in collaboration with the [[Hungarian Communist Party]], but in 1948 he became disillusioned and left communism.

== Szathmari and literature ==

At an early age he very much liked [[Bible]] stories, but until 1917 did not take an interest in literature, although his literature teacher in high school was VAJTHÓ László, who got many students interested in literature.  The young Szathmáry thought writing novels a bore, for him thinking up machines was more interesting.

In 1917 he became acquainted with the works of [[Frigyes Karinthy]] (pron. kArinti frItyes), whom he later came to adore.  Influenced by [[Karinthy]], he began working in the period  1919-1921 on a mathematics textbook and put on paper his first small attempts at [[belles lettres]] (''The Serious Person'' (A komoly ember ~a kOmoy Ember) evinces a satirical view of someone who speaks of pacifist convictions, but who in the end hits someone else).

In the period 1930-1934 he worked on a trilogy of novels, but when that was ready, he no longer recognized his work, so it remained unpublished.  During 1931-32 he wrote the past (''Látván nem látnak'' ~ Seeing one sees not), in the summer and autumn of 1932 the future (''Hiába'' ~In Vain), and in the spring of 1935 the present (''Kazohinia'').  The first part of the trilogy was called „Látván nem látnak” ~Seeing one sees not, which was a pale attempt with excessive characterization.  The second part of the trilogy (1932), called Hiába ~In Vain, takes place in the future socialist Hungary of 2080.

In 1935 he began writing his magnum opus, ''[[Kazohinia]]'' (''Gulliver utazása Kazohiniában'', Budapest 1941; ''Kazohinia'' Budapest 1957, 1972). The edition of (1946?) contains the parts left out earlier due to military censorship, and new details were added.  He even modified the 1957 edition.  This work he dedicated – as the travels of modern Gulliver – to Frigyes Karinthy.  The interesting aspect of the genre is that it combines satire and utopia.

=== Works in Esperanto ===

The international Esperanto movement became acquainted with his name only in 1958, after the appearance of his novel ''Kazohinia'' in Esperanto (''Vojaĝo al Kazohinio''). However, he himself said that his first article in Esperanto appeared in 1934 in ''[[Sennaciulo]]'' (The Nationless). 
Between the years 1937 kaj 1942, Szathmari was the managing president of the [[Hungarian Esperanto-Society]].

In addition to the novel ''Vojaĝo al Kazohinio'', which was originally written in 1935, and before the appearance of the Esperanto original, which was published three times in Hungarian translation, there also appeared in book form Szathmári's short story collection ''[[Maŝinmondo]]'' ~MachineWorld (J. Régulo, 1964), ''Tréfán kívül'', a translation into Hungarian of the Esperanto novel ''[[Kredu min, sinjorino!]]'' ~Believe me, Mamm by [[Cezaro Rossetti]] (1957) and the Esperanto translation of a Hungarian children's book ''Cxu ankau vi scias?'' ~Do you Know it Too?.  
Szathmári is represented in the short story anthology ''33 Rakontoj'' ~33 Stories (J. Régulo, 1964) with one short story.

More short stories by Szathmári appeared in the reviews ''Norda Prismo, La Nica Literatura Revuo, Belarto, Monda Kulturo'' and ''Hungara Vivo''.  He contributed with articles about the Esperanto movement and about literary themes to S''ennacieca Revuo, La Praktiko, Sennaciulo, Hungara Vivo,'' and ''Monda Kulturo'', among others.  Szathmari did not write abundantly, but he, despite his stylistic deficiencies (which some have emphasized), managed to push himself forward as one of the most serious contributors to Esperanto proze, perhaps the only prose writer in the International Language with a creative format worthy of attention outside the Esperanto movement.  Regularly dealing with an imaginary not too distant future of humanity, Szathmári's works flail human society, without idiological reserve and without any perceptible specificity as to time and place.

=== Matter of Tamkó Sirató Károly ===

In 1924, in his new lodgings he met a youth, with whom he became friends and later enemies.  His roommate at school was [[Tamkó Sirató Károly]], then still [[Tamkó Károly]], who was studying law and who later became an emenence in Hungarian avant garde poetry.  He started a lawsuit in 1958 against  Szathmári, claiming that he too collaborated in the writing of ''Kazohinia''.  Szathmári won the lawsuit. (Although ''Kazohinia'' appeared in 1941, 1946, Tamkó started the lawsuit only after the third edition (1957)).  The novel ''Hiába'' ("In Vain") could be proven to be in the same style as that of the winner, but the presentation of the (anti-communist) novel in 1958 would have put him in danger of prison.

Tamkó read Szathmári's trilogy only in 1936, when he returned from Paris.

Born in 1831, Theodore Hope was the only child of Dr. [[James Hope (physician)|James Hope]], F.R.S., a wealthy physician at [[St George's Hospital]], whose research in connection with [[heart disease]] was cut short by his death from [[Tuberculosis|consumption]] in middle life. Theodore's mother, [[Anne Hope|Anne]] was an author. Hope was privately educated for the most part, with spells at [[Rugby School]], and afterwards at [[Lambrook|Haileybury]], then the [[East India Company]]'s college. From frequent [[yachting]] practice abroad he was able to secure a [[Master mariner|master's certificate]] before he was 20; and when he joined the [[Bombay]] [[Civil Service]] in 1853 he spoke five European languages.&lt;ref name ="obit" /&gt;

Within two years of landing Hope became Inspector in [[Gujarat]], India for the newly formed Education Department. With native scholars such as [[Dalpatram]], he prepared a series of Gujarati textbooks later come to be known as ''Hope Vachanmala'' (Hope's Readers).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://epaperbeta.timesofindia.com/Article.aspx?eid=31805&amp;articlexml=World-drawn-by-Gujarat-magnet-18022017516016|title=World drawn by Gujarat magnet|last=|first=|date=2017-02-18|website=The Times of India|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next he served [[Sir George Clerk]], the Governor, as private secretary, and then was given charge of the [[Ahmedabad]] district, where he pursued his archeological hobbies, and when he came home on long leave in 1865-66 he published three large works of the architectural monuments of Ahmedabad, [[Bijapur, Karnataka|Bijapur]], and [[Dharwar]]. Returning to India, he spent eight years as Collector of [[Surat]], and in 1871 he was called to Bombay, to preside over a committee appointed to deal with the unsatisfactory state of municipal finance.

'''Timothy Matlack''' (May 28, 1730 – April 14, 1826) was a brewer and beer bottler who emerged as a popular and powerful leader in the [[American Revolutionary War]], Secretary of Pennsylvania during the war, and a delegate to the [[Second Continental Congress]] in 1780. He became one of Pennsylvania's most provocative and influential political figures, but he was removed from office by his political enemies at the end of the war; however, he returned to power in the Jeffersonian era.&lt;ref&gt;Coelho, Chris. ''Timothy Matlack: Scribe of the Declaration of Independence''. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2013, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Matlack was known for his excellent penmanship and was chosen to write the original [[United States Declaration of Independence]] on vellum.&lt;ref name=lnp&gt;{{cite news|first=Jack |last=Brubaker |title=The Scribbler: The man who really wrote the Declaration of Independence  |url=http://lancasteronline.com/opinion/the_scribbler/the-scribbler-the-man-who-really-wrote-the-declaration-of/article_97e841f4-3c75-11e6-adde-cb17b73fb581.html |work=([[LNP (newspaper)|LNP]]) [[Lancaster Online]] |date=2016-06-28 |accessdate=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Timothy Matlack was born in [[Haddonfield, New Jersey]] on May 28, 1730, to Elizabeth Martha Burr Haines and Timothy Matlack. His grandparents were William Matlack and Mary Hancock, and Henry Burr and Elizabeth Hudson. His siblings were Sybil, Elizabeth, Titus, Seth, Josiah, and [[White Matlack]]; his half siblings were Reuben and Mary Haines. His first cousin was Quaker abolitionist [[John Woolman]].&lt;ref&gt;Coelho, Chris ''Timothy Matlack: Scribe of the Declaration of Independence''. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2013, p.185.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1738, the family moved to Philadelphia, and he was apprenticed to the prosperous Quaker merchant John Reynell in 1749. At the end of his term, he married Ellen Yarnall, the daughter of Quaker minister Mordecai Yarnall, and their children were William, Mordecai, Sibyl, Catharine, and Martha.

In 1760, Matlack opened a store called the Case Knife, and he and Owen Biddle purchased a steel furnace in Trenton, New Jersey in 1762. His shop failed in 1765, and he was disowned by the Quakers who complained that he had been "frequenting company in such a manner as to spend too much of his time from home". He was confined to debtors' prison in 1768 and 1769. By 1769, he had set up a new business selling bottled beer and opened his own brewery near [[Independence Hall]]. 

In 1774 Matlack was hired by Charles Thomson, Secretary of the First Continental Congress, to engross (transcribe) an address to the King of England. In May, 1775, he became clerk to the Second Continental Congress and in June he composed George Washington's commission as General and Commander-in-Chief of the army of the United Colonies. Congress elevated him to Storekeeper of Military Supplies. He was also a member of Philadelphia's Committee of Inspection and Secretary of the Committee of Officers of the city's three militia battalions. Philadelphia added two more battalions to its militia brigade in January 1776, and Matlack was elected Colonel of the Fifth Battalion of Rifle Rangers. He was a delegate to the Conference of Committees which met in June to plan a new constitution for Pennsylvania. Later that month, he engrossed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] on parchment, and members of Congress began signing it on August 2.

Matlack was instrumental in drafting the [[Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776]], and he ardently defended it against such critics as [[Benjamin Rush]], [[James Wilson]], and [[John Dickinson (Pennsylvania and Delaware)|John Dickinson]]. Newspapers were his primary medium and he signed a number of articles with the pseudonym Tiberius Gracchus.&lt;ref&gt;Pennsylvania: A History of the Commonwealth, (ed. Millegrand Pencak, W., the Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, Harrisburg, PA, 2002, p. 117)&lt;/ref&gt; As Secretary to the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania, Matlack was one of the most powerful men in the new state during the war years. In 1780, his government passed an Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery.

The Philadelphia and Pennsylvania militia crossed the Delaware River with Washington on December 27, 1776, and Colonel Matlack and his 5th Rifle Battalion were part of the expedition. Washington credited the Pennsylvania militia for their timely service in this campaign, and other officers commended the force for its manliness and spirit. Following the British occupation of Philadelphia, Washington assigned Benedict Arnold to the post of Commandant of Philadelphia, and Matlack learned to despise the man's presence. He led an investigation of his wrongdoing which triggered a court martial, and the court sentenced Arnold to be reprimanded by the Commander-in-Chief. Washington said that his officer's behavior had been "reprehensible"; Arnold's treason was discovered five months later.

Matlack was named a trustee of the [[University of Pennsylvania|University of the State of Pennsylvania]] in 1779. He was also a Secretary of the [[American Philosophical Society]]. He was among the founders of [[The Religious Society of Free Quakers]] in 1781, Quakers who had been "disowned" for their support of the American war for independence. He was also one of the earliest opponents of slavery in America, and he felt that the Quakers were not moving quickly enough on abolition. He helped raise a substantial sum of money to construct the Free Quaker Meeting House at the corner of Fifth and Arch streets in downtown Philadelphia, along with [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]]. 

In 1790, Matlack was commissioned to survey the "headwaters of the [[Susquehanna River]] and the streams of the [[New Purchase (1768)|New Purchase]]," the northwestern portion of the state purchased from the American Indians.  They were also charged with exploring a route for a passageway to connect the [[West Branch Susquehanna River|West Branch]] with the [[Allegheny River]].&lt;ref&gt;Storey, Henry Wilson.

His remains were removed in 1905 and reinterred in the Wetherill Cemetery opposite [[Valley Forge]].

{{Financial markets}}
A '''treasury stock''' or '''reacquired stock''' is [[stock]] which is also bought back by the issuing [[company]], reducing the amount of [[outstanding stock]] on the open market ("open market" including insiders' holdings). 

[[Share repurchase|Stock repurchases]] are used as a [[tax efficiency|tax efficient]] method to put cash into shareholders' hands, rather than paying [[dividend]]s, in jurisdictions that treat capital gains more favorably. Sometimes, companies do it when they feel that their stock is undervalued on the open market. Other times, companies do it to reduce dilution from incentive compensation plans for employees. Another motive for stock repurchase is to protect the company against a takeover threat.

The [[United Kingdom]] equivalent of '''treasury stock''' as used in the [[United States]] is '''treasury share'''. Treasury stocks in the UK refers to government bonds or [[gilts]].

==Limitations of treasury stock==
*Treasury stock is not entitled to receive a [[dividend]]
*Treasury stock has no voting rights
*Total treasury stock can not exceed the maximum proportion of total capitalization specified by law in the relevant country

When shares are repurchased, they may either be canceled or held for reissue. If not canceled, such shares are referred to as treasury shares. Technically, a repurchased share is a company's own share that has been bought back after having been issued and fully paid.

A company cannot own itself. The possession of treasury shares does not give the company the right to vote, to exercise preemptive rights as a shareholder, to receive cash dividends, or to receive assets on company liquidation. Treasury shares are essentially the same as unissued capital and no one advocates classifying unissued share capital as an asset on the balance sheet, as an asset should have probable future economic benefits. Treasury shares simply reduce ordinary share capital.

==Buying back shares==
{{main|Share repurchase}}
===Benefits===
In an [[Efficient-market hypothesis|efficient market]], a company buying back its stock should have no effect on its price per share valuation. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} If the market fairly prices a company's shares at $50/share, and the company buys back 100 shares for $5,000, it now has $5,000 less cash but there are 100 fewer shares outstanding; the net effect should be that the underlying value of each share is unchanged.  Additionally, buying back shares will improve [[P/E ratios|price/earnings]] ratios due to the reduced number of shares (and unchanged earnings) and improve [[earnings per share]] ratios due to fewer shares outstanding (and unchanged earnings).

If the market is not [[efficient-market hypothesis|efficient]], the company's shares may be underpriced. In that case a company can benefit its other shareholders by buying back shares. If a company's shares are overpriced, then a company is actually hurting its remaining shareholders by buying back stock.

===Incentives===
One other reason for a company to buy back its own stock is to reward holders of [[stock options]]. Call option holders are hurt by dividend payments, since, typically, they are not eligible to receive them. A share buyback program ''may'' increase the value of remaining shares (if the buyback is executed when shares are under-priced); if so, call option holders benefit. A dividend payment short term  ''always'' decreases the value of shares after the payment, so, for stocks with regularly scheduled dividends, on the day shares go ex-dividend, call option holders ''always'' lose whereas put option holders benefit. This does not apply to unscheduled (special) dividends since the strike prices of options are typically adjusted to reflect the amount of the special dividend. Finally, if the sellers into a corporate buyback are actually the call option holders themselves, they may directly benefit from temporary unrealistically favorable pricing.

===After buyback===
The company can either retire (cancel) the shares (however, retired shares are not listed as treasury stock on the company's financial statements) or hold the shares for later resale. Buying back stock reduces the number of outstanding shares. Accompanying the decrease in the number of shares outstanding is a reduction in company assets, in particular, cash assets, which are used to buy back shares.

==Accounting for treasury stock==
On the [[balance sheet]], treasury stock is listed under [[shareholders' equity]] as a negative number. The accounts may be called "Treasury stock" or "equity reduction".

One way of accounting for treasury stock is with the cost method. In this method, the paid-in capital account is reduced in the balance sheet when the treasury stock is bought. When the treasury stock is sold back on the open market, the paid-in capital is either debited or credited if it is sold for less or more than the initial cost respectively.

Another common way for accounting for treasury stock is the [[par value]] method. In the par value method, when the stock is purchased back from the market, the books will reflect the action as a retirement of the shares. Therefore, common stock is debited and treasury stock is credited. However, when the treasury stock is resold back to the market the entry in the books will be the same as the cost method.

In either method, any transaction involving treasury stock cannot increase the amount of [[retained earnings]]. If the treasury stock is sold for more than cost, then the paid-in capital treasury stock is the account that is increased, not [[retained earnings]]. In auditing [[financial statements]], it is a common practice to check for this error to detect possible attempts to "cook the books."

==United States regulations==
In the United States, buybacks are covered by multiple laws under the auspices of the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]].

==United Kingdom regulations==
In the UK, the [[Companies Act 1955]] disallowed companies from holding their own shares. However, the [[Companies Act 1985]] later repealed this.
