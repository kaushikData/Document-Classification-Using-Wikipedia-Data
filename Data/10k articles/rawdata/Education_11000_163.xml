Abernethy runs four [[Outdoor education|outdoor activities]] centres and a bunkhouse in Scotland, providing outdoor instruction and residential facilities. The team  staffed by committed Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abernethytrust.org.uk/ |title=The Abernethy Trust |accessdate=2007-04-23 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |quote= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080807173749/http://www.abernethytrust.org.uk/| archivedate=August 7, 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== A History of Abernethy ==

Abernethy was established in 1971 when the Walker family donated their {{convert|30|acre|m2|sing=on}} estate and buildings at [[Nethybridge]]. About 10 years later Miss Mary Currie, owner of the Hamilton Arms Hotel on the [[Isle of Arran]], gave her property to be used as a Christian Centre resulting in the birth of the Arran Outdoor Centre.  In 1984 the Trust accepted the gift of Brae Lodge at Loch Tay from Mr and Mrs Barratt, which ran under the Abernethy banner as the Ardeonaig Outdoor Centre. The fourth centre to come under Abernethy was the Ardgour Outdoor Centre on the Kilmalieu Estate, across the loch from [[Fort William, Scotland|Fort William]]. A few years later this centre became the home of the Abernethy Trust School of Adventure Leadership (in 1997). The last centre to be added to the Abernethy Trust  was Barcaple Outdoor Centre, in 1996. This Centre was already operating as a Christian outdoor centre, independent from the Abernethy Trust, but Barcaple approached Abernethy asking if they could merge their ministry in [[Dumfries and Galloway]] with that of Abernethy. This officially happened on 1 January 2001. Around the same time it became apparent that the Arran Centre had reached the end of its effective period of service and the property was sold off and the proceeds used to support the other centres. Abernethy also runs an additional winter base at a Chalet in the Swiss Alps, and provide ski holidays from the end of December until the beginning of March.

::"Believing that radio is in its very nature one of the most important factors in our national and international welfare, we, the representatives of the institutions of higher learning, engaged in educational broadcasting, do associate ourselves together to promote, by mutual cooperation and united effort, the dissemination of knowledge to the end that both the technical and educational feature of broadcasting may be extended to all."&lt;ref&gt;Original Constitution of Association of College and University Broadcasting Stations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saettler, L.

Beaconhouse School System has now grown into an international company with independent divisions in [[Belgium]], [[Malaysia]], [[Oman]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], the [[UAE]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Its activities extend beyond education in some countries. Most of its branches are located in Pakistan with [[Beaconhouse School System (Pakistan)|30 branches]] throughout the country.

== History ==
The first [[Beaconhouse School System (Pakistan)|Beaconhouse]] school opened in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]], in 1975. From its initial association in the 1980s with the [[Moray House School of Education]] in Scotland, to its teacher training programme initiated in 1993 in collaboration with the [[University of Bradford]], Beaconhouse has organised in-service teacher training. Today, more than half its teachers have internationally recognised teaching certificates while the rest are enrolled in the permanent in-service programme. In addition, Beaconhouse sends senior academics to the UK annually to pursue master's degrees in education and professional development.

In 1996, the [[World Bank Group]], through its private sector wing, the [[International Finance Corporation]], entered into a financing arrangement with Beaconhouse aimed at the construction of new school campuses.

In September 2012, the founder and chairperson of the Beaconhouse Group, Mrs. Nasreen Mahmud Kasuri, received a "Pakistan Women Power 100 award".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistanpower100.com/index/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/THE-WOMEN-100-LIST.pdf |title=Women Power 100 |page=69 |year=2012 |publisher=Pakistan Power 100 Awards |accessdate=28 December 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Budapest Business School''' ('''BBS''') ({{lang-hu|Budapesti Gazdasági Egyetem or BGE}}) is a [[public university]] [[business school]] specialised in [[business studies]] and [[social sciences]] located in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. Founded in 1857 by merchants and bankers of [[Austria-Hungary]] in order to establish the economic vocational training of higher education in the empire and in [[Central Europe]]. It is the oldest [[Public university|public]] [[business school]] in the world, and second oldest among business schools, after the [[ESCP Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://en.bgf.hu/The-BBS/history|title=History of BBS|accessdate=6 October 2014|publisher=Budapest Business School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Budapest Business School is Hungary's market leading and largest business school and conducts education and research in [[leadership]], [[economics]], [[operations management]], [[marketing]], [[entrepreneurship]], [[organizational behavior]], and other areas; as of this time, its most acclaimed programs are [[finance]], [[accounting]], [[strategic management]], and [[tourism]]. The School offers a wide range of [[graduate school|graduate]]-level academic programs and concentrations. In the latest academic year the Budapest Business School offers 12 [[Bachelor's degree]] programmes, in case of most programmes in English, French, German and Hungarian language as well. Offers 12 [[Master's degree]] programmes, of which the most populars are [[Master of Finance]], [[Master of Management]] (equal to [[MBA]]), [[Master of International Business]] and [[Master of Tourism Management]]. Moreover, offers [[PhD in Management]] [[doctoral school]], 51 post-graduate [[professional qualification]] with either Hungarian, English, German, Dutch or French state degree accreditations, being recognized within the [[European Union]] and throughout the world.

==History==
Budapest Business School was founded as the '''Pest Academy of Commerce''' that was established in 1857, which is the official predecessor of the BBS faculties College of Finance and Accountancy and the College of Catering, Commerce and Tourism. Pest Academy of Commerce (German: Pester Handelsakademie, Hungarian: Pesti Kereskedelmi Akadémia) was founded by the second president of the Pest Chamber of Commerce, József Appiano, Antal Valero (first president of the Pest Chamber of Commerce, and later Pest Mayor) and by Habsburg Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph]]. At the beginning, the language of education was German at the academy.

It was the first higher educational institution for [[business studies]] in [[Austria-Hungary]], thus it was the first [[business school]] in [[Central Europe]]. Moreover, it is the oldest existing [[business school]] in the world, following the [[ESCP Europe]] with its campuses in [[Paris]], [[London]], [[Berlin]], [[Madrid]], and [[Torino]]. After the cities Buda and Pest merged, the institution was renamed to '''Budapest Academy of Commerce'''. Most of the business professionals and economists of the country gained their qualifications there as it was the only business school in the country that time.

Architect [[Győző Czigler]] designed the Alkomány street campus of the '''Budapest Academy of Commerce''' in 1882, and the construction was finished in 1885, when  the construction of the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]] was also starting directly next to it. He was the architect of the [[Széchenyi thermal bath]] and many other famous buildings. The campus at the Alkotmány street is still one of the main campuses of the '''Budapest Business School'''. BBS's campus at the Markó street is also located in Downtown Budapest. It is also a monumental building, designed by famous architect Ferenc Kolbenheyer (father of [[Erwin Guido Kolbenheyer]]) in neoclassical style in 1872. The Markó street campus of the Budapest Business School is a close but more modest kin of the top-ranked [[ETH Zurich]], designed by [[Gottfried Semper]] and [[Gustav Zeuner]]. There is a famous Council Room at the Markó street campus called Lotz Room, full with paintings painted by [[Károly Lotz]] and [[Mór Than]]. Many of the conferences of the Hungarian [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]] was held in this room, and in other lecture rooms of the Markó street campus. Budapest Academy of Commerce was a private business school until 1949, when it was secularized by the government, becoming a public business school.

After the school was renamed and changed several times, the College of Accountancy was established in 1953, and the College of Catering and Commerce was established in 1969. The forerunner of the College of International Management is the School of International Commerce that was established in 1957.
[[File:BGF 1.jpg|thumb|right|270px|College of Commerce, Catering and Tourism historical building campus in [[downtown]]]]
In January 2000, the colleges created the Budapest Business School and became faculties of the university.
The university was awarded the Quality Award of Higher Education by the Minister of Education in 2010.
In March 2011, the College of Business Administration faculty was established out of the College of Finance and Accounting campus in Zalaegerszeg.

[[School]] [[teacher]]s are commonly the subject of [[bullying]] but they are also sometimes the originators of bullying within a school environment. When an adult bullies a child, it is referred to as psychological, emotional, or verbal abuse.{{by whom|date=September 2018}}

==Incidence==
While teacher bullying is recognized as serious and harmful, there are no statistics on either teachers bullying others or teachers being bullied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bullying Teachers {{!}} Bullying Statistics|url = http://www.bullyingstatistics.org/content/bullying-teachers.html|website = www.bullyingstatistics.org|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to one article, a high percentage of teachers admit to bullying students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Teachers Bullying Students{{!}}No Bullying{{!}}Anti Bullying Help Center|url = http://nobullying.com/high-percentage-of-teachers-admit-to-bullying-students/|website = nobullying.com|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comprehensive research carried out in the UK found that [[teaching]] was one of the occupations at highest risk from bullying:&lt;ref&gt;Hoel, H. &amp; [[Cary Cooper|Cooper, C.L]].

* 15.5% of teachers stating they were currently being bullied
* 35.4% saying they had been bullied over the last five years.

In another survey, the [[Economic and Social Research Institute]] found bullying to be more prevalent in schools (13.8pc) than other workplaces (7.9pc).&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-197682649.html BULLYING in the staffroom is having a deeply traumatic effect on some teachers and their families, new research reveals.] [[Irish Independent]] April 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Students with learning disabilities may be especially at risk for teacher bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Students with Learning Disabilities at Risk for Teacher Bullying|url = http://www.kidsinthehouse.com/blogs/dr-jennifer-fraser/students-with-learning-disabilities-at-risk-for-teacher-bullying#.VfHcPdbbOII.facebook|website = Kids in the House|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complex dynamics==
There are complex issues with reporting bullying by teachers, not only for children, but also parents. By means of their position of power over the child, power that enables them to impact the child's present and future,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Teaching Bullies|url = http://www.beakidshero.com/posts/teaching-bullies/|website = Ginger Kadlec: BeAKidsHero™|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; children and parents are reluctant to report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why don’t kids speak up about bullying?|url = http://www.theedadvocate.org/why-dont-kids-speak-up-about-bullying/|website = The Edvocate|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are specific signs that parents should watch for as their child is unlikely to disclose that the teacher is in fact the bully.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 10 Signs That Your Child's Teacher or Coach May Be a Bully|url = http://www.healingwalls.org/10-signs-that-your-childs-teacher-or-coach-may-be-a-bully/|website = Healing Walls|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, a teacher who bullies may present as a Jekyll and Hyde figure: he or she is often celebrated and popular so their abuse can go on for long periods of time undetected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Recognizing the Abusive Coach as Jekyll and Hyde|url = https://jenmfraser.wordpress.com/2015/08/06/recognizing-the-abusive-coach-as-jekyll-and-hyde/|website = Teaching Bullies|accessdate = 2015-11-29|first = Jennifer Fraser|last = PhD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacking research on teachers in classrooms, once again it is hard to be sure, but certainly in teaching a sport, it can be seen that adults are often rewarded for bullying conduct that would never be tolerated or condoned if done by a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rewarding Adults Who Bully|url = http://www.kidsinthehouse.com/blogs/jenmfrasershawca/rewarding-adults-who-bully|website = Kids in the House|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a school setting, this is true for teachers in the classroom as well as in their role as coaches of school sports.

Parsons identifies teacher bullying as often being part of a wider [[bullying culture]] within a school, with a complex web of [[Group dynamics|dynamics]] such as:&lt;ref name="Parsons"&gt;Parsons L [https://books.google.com/books?id=k_wXp4pUJeQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Bullied+Teacher:+Bullied+Student&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=h7t3TfDvLpGEhQfuy7GBBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Bullied Teacher, Bullied Student: How to Recognize the Bullying Culture in Your School and What to Do About It (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staffroom bullying==
A common manifestation of teacher bullying is [[staffroom]] bullying where teachers are bullied by other teachers or school managers.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;&lt;ref name=Field&gt;[[Tim Field|Field T]] [http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=365418 Staffroom bullying] [[Times Educational Supplement|The Times Educational Supplement (TES) Magazine]] 21 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strickland S [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/bullies-in-the-staff-room-1583254.html Bullies in the staff room] [[The Independent]] 23 November 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dean C [http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=393438 Call to beat the staffroom bullies] [[Times Educational Supplement|The Times Educational Supplement (TES)]] 16 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6165338.stm Being bullied in the staffroom] [[BBC News]] 20 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCall B [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2006/nov/20/schools.uk1 Staffroom suffering] [[The Guardian|Education Guardian]], 20 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manifestations==
In investigating teacher bullying, it is important to differentiate a teacher or coach who is demanding versus one who is demeaning. So "yelling" for instance can be highly productive and motivating, but if it involves belittling and is laced with putdowns and swearing, it becomes abusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Abuse or motivation? I know it when I see it. Do you? By Matt Davidson, Ph.D., President, Institute for Excellence &amp; Ethics (IEE)|url = http://excellenceandethics.org/blog/2013/04/abuse-or-motivation-i-know-it-when-i-see-it-do-you-by-matt-davidson-ph-d-president-institute-for-excellence-ethics-iee/|website = EXCELLENCE &amp; ETHICS|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying by teachers can take many forms in order to harass and intimidate including:&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2006/9241594365_eng.pdf?ua=1]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Swearing, or yelling, especially in close proximity to the child
* Using homophobic, sexist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The use of homophobic slurs in sports: It’s for the athletes’ own good, right?|url = http://www.theedadvocate.org/the-use-of-homophobic-slurs-in-sports-its-for-the-athletes-own-good-right/|website = The Edvocate|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; racial slurs, or direct personal attacks, comments targeting a child's disability or difference
* Humiliating
* Berating
* Ignoring or shunning
* Throwing objects
* Raging
* Expressing disgust at the child through gestures or facial expressions
* Muttering obscenities so only the targeted child or children hear
 
Bullying of teachers can take many forms in order to [[harass]] and [[intimidate]] including:&lt;ref name="Lepkowska"&gt;Lepkowska D [http://www.sec-ed.co.uk/cgi-bin/go.pl/article/article.html?uid=79740;type_uid=1;section=News The shocking stories of teacher-on-teacher bullying] Secondary Education News (SecEd) 11 Nov 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Face-to-face confrontation
* [[Memorandum|Memos]]
* [[cyber-bullying|Cyberbullying]] (including the use of [[text messaging]] or [[social networking]] sites)

Bullies often exploit positions of seniority over the colleagues they are intimidating (see [[rankism]]) by:&lt;ref name=Lepkowska/&gt;
* [[Criticising]] their work
* Making unreasonable demands on workload (see [[setting up to fail]])
* [[Sarcasm]] and jokes aimed at the victim
* [[social undermining|Undermining]] them by over-ruling their decisions and views

In some cases, teachers are ignored and isolated by colleagues in the staffroom or turned down for [[Promotion (rank)|promotion]] or training courses (see [[silent treatment]]).&lt;ref name=Lepkowska/&gt; Other times, teachers are ostracized as [[whistleblowers]] when they report to administrators on students' reports of bullying being done by their colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Jennifer Fraser says she left because of a "hostile, humiliating, poisoned or intolerable work environment," created after she complained her son was being abused by teacher coaches.

==Impacts==
The power imbalance of teacher to student is greater than peer to peer and may well intensify the impact. 
The possible impacts of bullying of teachers include:
* [[Victimisation]] and [[victim blaming]]&lt;ref name="Parsons" /&gt;
* [[False accusations]] and fabricated [[Discipline#Employment discipline|formal disciplinary action]]&lt;ref&gt;Munday K [http://www.jfo.org.uk/work/sector/teaching.htm The Bullying of Teachers Through the Use of Formal Disciplinary Procedures 2003] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617075239/http://www.jfo.org.uk/work/sector/teaching.htm |date=June 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Workplace stress|Stress]] symptoms such as [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], [[headaches]], [[nausea]], [[palpitations]], and [[hypertension]]&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;
* Symptoms of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) such as a compromised [[immune system]], [[sleep problems]], excessive [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[irritability]], [[hypervigilance]] (which feels like [[paranoia]], but is not), constant anxiety, [[reactive depression]] and [[suicidal thoughts]]&lt;ref name="Field" /&gt;
* Loss of [[self-esteem]]&lt;ref name="Field" /&gt;
* Loss of job&lt;ref name="Parsons" /&gt;

==Notable incidents==
In April 2012, Stuart Chaifetz, a father of an autistic boy, released a video on [[YouTube]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfkscHt96R0 "Teacher/Bully: How My Son Was Humiliated and Tormented by his Teacher and Aide", Stuart Chaifetz, video at YouTube, posted April 20, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; providing evidence that his son was allegedly the subject of emotional abuse at the hands of his teacher and aide at Horace Mann Elementary School, in the [[Cherry Hill Public Schools]] district.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horacemannelementary.com/ Horace Mann Elementary School website]&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence was secured when Chaifetz wired his son before sending him to school. When he listened to the audio recording, according to one news report, "Chaifetz says he caught his son's teachers gossiping, talking about alcohol and violently yelling at students. He took the audio to the Cherry Hill School District, where officials fired one of the teachers involved after hearing the tape. Chaifetz's son was relocated to a new school, where Chaifetz says he is doing well."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myfoxphilly.com/dpp/news/local_news/nj-father-records-teachers-bullying-his-autistic-child NJ Father Records Teachers Bullying His Autistic Child, MyFoxPhilly.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/education/story/2012-04-29/autism-education-abuse-reform/54616582/1 "Verbal abuse of autistic student sparks calls for reform", Jim Walsh and Phil Dunn, ''Cherry Hill Courier-Post'', reprinted at ''USA Today'' website, 29 April 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it appears that students with learning disabilities may be especially at risk for teacher bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Students with Learning Disabilities at Risk for Teacher Bullying|url = http://www.kidsinthehouse.com/blogs/dr-jennifer-fraser/students-with-learning-disabilities-at-risk-for-teacher-bullying#.VfHcPdbbOII.facebook|website = Kids in the House|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, select members of the Board, the Chaplain and Headmaster at St. Michaels University School were informed that teachers were abusing students in the basketball program. They received an eleven-page document written by a lawyer, who was also a parent of a student at the school, outlining the incidences of "child abuse" occurring on basketball teams at the Senior School. Parents were not informed; teachers remained in position. Although not knowing about this document, throughout the year, at least five families made significant formal complaints to Board members, the Chaplain and Headmaster about the abusive coaching conduct. In 2012, at least thirteen students, at the request of the Headmaster, approved of detailed, written testimonies about the verbal, emotional and some physical abuse they were suffering at the hands of their teachers who were coaching them as a co-curricular.

How they were treated by the Headmaster, the school's Board of Governors, lawyers hired by the school, and educational authorities was the subject of a front-page story by award-winning investigative journalist, Robert Cribb,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = In 2012, students at St. Michael’s University School in Victoria — where Steve Nash played basketball — began alleging emotional abuse and humiliation.

Informed by research into the serious, extensive, and often irreparable damage to adolescent brains in particular{{fact|date=September 2018}}, Fraser has launched an awareness campaign on Facebook&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Teaching Bullies|url = https://www.facebook.com/TeachingBullies/|website = www.facebook.com|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Twitter (@teachingbullies) in an attempt to get lawmakers to put emotional abuse into the criminal code along with sexual and physical abuse. Neuroscientists believe it does similar if not identical harm to developing brains.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

In June 2014, Britain proposed the "Cinderella Law" which would put emotional abuse in the Criminal Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Should Emotional Abuse Be Criminalized?|url = http://www.hautlife.com/humans-and-animals/126-humans/humanity/1302-should-emotional-abuse-be-criminalized|website = www.hautlife.com|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Civilekonom''', literally "civil economist", is a professional title in [[Sweden]] (with corresponding titles in [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]], [[#See also|see below]]) which traditionally refers to an individual who holds either a [[Bachelor's degree]] or a [[Master's degree]] in business administration and economics (with a major in business administration and a minor in economics, or vice versa).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilekonomerna.se/portal/page?_pageid=34,8512339&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL Civilekonomerna&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911142839/http://www.civilekonomerna.se/portal/page?_pageid=34%2C8512339&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL |date=2007-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the English language usage, in Swedish, ''ekonomi'' ("economy") is commonly used as an umbrella designation for both business- and economics-related subjects.

As an academic title it was first introduced by the [[Stockholm School of Economics]] for the degree that the school offered, and was created in parallel to the already established engineering degree {{Interlanguage link multi|civilingenjör|sv}}, which etymologically is the same as the English expression [[civil engineer]].

Formally, the exam certificate for a ''civilekonom'' would say ''ekonomexamen'' ("degree in economy"), or be a general Bachelor's (''kandidat'') or Master's (''magister'') degree.

Although the title remains unprotected in Sweden and the aforementioned practice is still in use, as of 2007 a new academic degree called ''Civilekonomexamen'' (Master of Science in Business and Economics) has been introduced which can be awarded after four years of studies in business administration and economics by the following universities in Sweden:

* [[Gothenburg University]] ([[Gothenburg]])
* [[Linköping University]] ([[Linköping]])
* [[Luleå University of Technology]] ([[Luleå]])
* [[Lund University]] ([[Lund]])
* [[Stockholm University]] ([[Stockholm]])
* [[Umeå University]] ([[Umeå]])
* [[Linnaeus University]] ([[Växjö]] and [[Kalmar]])
* [[Örebro University]] ([[Örebro]])

The '''Dairy Council''' is a British organisation founded in 1920 to promote the widespread consumption of milk in the UK, and advocate its health benefits.

==History==
It was founded on 24 February 1920&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.milk.co.uk/history-dairy-council/ Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;, and incorporated on 4 February 1925&lt;ref&gt;[https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/00203597 Companies House]&lt;/ref&gt; as the '''National Milk Publicity Council''', situated on [[Southampton Street, London]]. From 1983 until 2001 it was known as the National Dairy Council. 

During WWII it had to curtail its activities as [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|milk was heavily rationed]]. Sale of milk in the UK was three pints per head each week in 1939, rising to five pints in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 3 April 1963, page viii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
It is situated in [[Holborn]], west of [[Holborn tube station]], next door to the [[Food Standards Agency]] in the offices of Dairy UK. [[Sodexo]] UK &amp; Ireland is on the opposite side of [[High Holborn]]. It is a subsidiary of Dairy UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dairyuk.org/about-us/our-structure/subsidiaries Dairy UK]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
It produced slogans to consume milk such as ''Drinka Pinta Milka Day'' in the 1950s. It placed large adverts in national newspapers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4128">'''Deadline24''' is an annual programming competition organized by a [[Poland|Polish]] company, [[Future Processing]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.future-processing.com/blog/deadline-24&lt;/ref&gt; for software developers and students from all over the world. The finals of the contest last 24 hours and are held in extreme conditions. It is always organized in the venues closely related to the industrial tradition of the Silesia Province (Poland). Competition tasks are prepared by programmers working at a Gliwice-based company, Future Processing. The marathon is free of charge.

== History ==
First edition of Deadline24 was organized by Tomasz Łakota and Mateusz Brzeszcz, and it took place in 2009 in Gliwice, Poland. Back then, it was the only challenge of this type in Poland.
Currently, it is an international competition and every year it becomes more and more popular. In 2016, for the first stage of the competition, 1,479 players signed up. In qualifying round attended by representatives of: Poland, Germany, Czech Republic, Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Great Britain, Spain, Slovakia, Estonia, China, Egypt, Indonesia, Nigeria, Brazil, and India.

== Contest parameters ==

The contest consists of 2 rounds:
1. An elimination round, where entrants have to complete a five-hour challenge via the Deadline24 website. 
2. The finals, which lasts 24 consecutive clock hours.

The qualifying round lasts 5 hours and is conducted via the Internet. The teams receive tasks and necessary input data. The objective is to find the solution (in any way) and to transfer it to the verification server within a given time. The best 20-30 teams qualify for the final. The qualifying round is open for all the teams who have registered via Deadline24 website before the registration deadline.
The final task of the contest consists of an appropriate interaction with the contest server under the terms and conditions specified in the task. Communication with the server is conducted using TCP/IP protocol.
Participants work on their own equipment (the organizer provides one 230V power outlet and one LAN RJ-45 jack or a plug-in cable for each team) and are allowed to choose any working environment and programming language. They may use any materials and auxiliary devices they bring with them, except for any devices providing access to external support. The access to any external help is strictly forbidden.


== Organizer ==
The competition is organized by Future Processing, a software development company from Gliwice, Poland. It operates in the global market and specializes in producing software for industry, international trade, and services. The company, which became a Microsoft certified partner in 2007, provides outsourcing services, but also creates its own products which set new quality standards.
In 2016, the company was awarded the title of the Outsourcing Service Provider of the Year by the Global Sourcing Association. It was also a finalist among a top employers competition in Silesia, Poland. In 2016, Future Processing launched the Better Future campaign which presents the possibilities of smart technologies in four main sectors: City, Healthcare, Planet, and Property.
Future Processing is also the organizer of a Polish national conference – Quality Excites, dedicated to software quality, Future Dev Day – a programming conference, and a series of lectures and workshops known as DPTO (Polish: Dobre Praktyki Tworzenia Oprogramowania) which stands for Good Practices in Software Creation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8524">'''Double-loop learning''' entails the modification of [[goal]]s or [[decision-making]] rules in the light of experience. The first loop uses the goals or decision-making rules, the second loop enables their modification, hence "double-loop". Double-loop learning recognises that the way a problem is defined and solved can be a source of the problem.&lt;ref name=c-argyris-learning&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Argyris |first1=Chris |authorlink=Chris Argyris |title=Teaching smart people how to learn |journal=[[Harvard Business Review]] |date=May 1991 |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=99–109 |url=http://pds8.egloos.com/pds/200805/20/87/chris_argyris_learning.pdf |accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Detail ==
Double-loop learning is contrasted with "single-loop learning": the repeated attempt at the same problem, with no variation of method and without ever questioning the goal. [[Chris Argyris]] described the distinction between single-loop and double-loop learning using the following analogy:

{{Quote|text=[A] thermostat that automatically turns on the heat whenever the temperature in a room drops below 68°F is a good example of single-loop learning. A thermostat that could ask, "why am I set to 68°F?" and then explore whether or not some other temperature might more economically achieve the goal of heating the room would be engaged in double-loop learning|author=[[Chris Argyris]] |source=''Teaching Smart People How To Learn''&lt;ref name="c-argyris-learning"/&gt;{{rp|99}}}}

Double-loop learning is used when it is necessary to change the mental model on which a decision depends. Unlike single loops, this model includes a shift in understanding, from simple and static to broader and more dynamic, such as taking into account the changes in the surroundings and the need for expression changes in mental models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mildeova, S., Vojtko V. |title=Systémová dynamika |year=2003 |isbn=80-245-0626-2 |publisher=Oeconomica |location=Prague |pages=19–24 |language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Historical precursors ==
''[[A Behavioral Theory of the Firm]]'' (1963) describes how organizations learn, using (what would now be described as) double-loop learning:

{{Quote|text=An organization ... changes its behavior in response to short-run feedback from the environment according to some fairly well-defined rules.  It changes rules in response to longer-run feedback according to more general rules, and so on.|author=[[Richard Cyert]] and [[James G. March]]| source=''A Behavioural Theory of the Firm''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cyert R.M. |author2=March J.G |title=''[[A Behavioral Theory of the Firm]] |year=1963 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=New Jersey |pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quote taken from p. 9 of ''The Blackwell Handbook of Organizational Learning and Knowledge Management'' (2003) which describes this quote as "an early version of the distinction between single and double-loop learning." and refers to the 1963 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The system provides six years of primary education for students ages six to twelve, followed by seven years of [[secondary school]]. In recent years, enrollment has expanded greatly, particularly at the primary level. About 20,750 pupils, or roughly 75 percent of primary-school-age children were enrolled in 1993, up from about 4p  in the late 1970s. About 17 percent of the secondary-school age population was enrolled, up from an estimated 7 percent fifteen to twenty years earlier. Teacher-student ratios also improved, from 47:1 to 36:1 in the primary schools and from 26:1 to 25:1 in secondary schools. The increased attendance was all the more significant given the population's high percentage of school-age children. Improvement in educational facilities was funded in 1993 by loans from the [[OPEC|Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC) and the [[African Development Bank]]. Despite the spread of education, adult [[literacy]] in 1993 has been estimated at no better than 50 percent.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;
[[File:Teacher prescolair.jpg|thumb|Teaching [[Shindzuwani]] in [[Anjouan]]]]
The Comoros has no [[university]] but instead has post-secondary education, which in 1993 involved 400 students, is available in the form of teacher training, agricultural education training, health sciences, and business. Those desiring higher education must study abroad; a "brain drain" has resulted because few university graduates are willing to return to the islands. Teacher training and other specialized courses are available at the M'Vouni School for Higher Education, in operation since 1981 at a site near [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]]. Few Comoran teachers study overseas, but the republic often cannot give its teachers all the training they need. Some international aid has been provided, however, to further teacher training in the islands themselves. For example, in 1987 the [[International Development Association|IDA]] extended credits worth US$7.9 million to train 3,000 primary and 350 secondary school teachers. In 1986 the government began opening technology training centers offering a three-year [[diploma]] program at the upper secondary level. The Ministry of National Education and Professional Training is responsible for education policy.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

As elsewhere in Comoran society, political instability has taken a toll on the education system. Routinely announced reductions in force among the civil service, often made in response to international pressure for fiscal reform, sometimes result in teacher [[Strike action|strikes]]. When civil service cutbacks result in canceled classes or examinations, students have at times taken to the streets in protest. Students have also protested, even violently, against government underfunding or general mismanagement of the schools: the [[World Bank]] stated in 1994 that the quality of education resulted in such high rates of repetition and dropouts that the average student needed fourteen years to complete the six-year primary cycle.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

[[Primary education]] is compulsory until the age of 14. However, the government does not enforce attendance, and boys are often given preference. In 2002, the gross primary enrollment rate was 90 percent and in 1999, the most recent year for which data are available, the net primary enrollment rate was 55 percent. Gross and net enrollment ratios are based on the number of students formally registered in primary school and therefore do not necessarily reflect actual school attendance. In 2000, 44.2 percent of children ages 5 to 14 years were attending school. There is a general lack of facilities, equipment, qualified teachers, textbooks and other resources. [[Salaries]] for teachers are often so far in arrears that many refuse to work.&lt;ref name=ilab&gt;"Comoros".

The '''Escuela Técnica Raggio''' ({{Language with name/for||Spanish|Raggio Technical School|links=no}}) is a government-run [[Secondary education|secondary school]] in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina. It is on [[Avenida del Libertador]], in the [[Núñez, Buenos Aires|Núñez]] neighborhood, near the [[Avenida General Paz]].

This is the only technical school in Buenos Aires that did not belong to the National Council of Technical Education (CONET), a national organization that grouped together industrial schools between 1959 and 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inet.edu.ar/index.php/institucional/historia/ |title=Historia CONET/INET - Instituto Nacional de Educación Tecnológica |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.educ.ar/sitios/educar/recursos/ver?id=113952&amp;nota=1335 |title=Educación Técnica - Recursos educ.ar |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Raggio Technical School was designed and directed by civil engineers Emilio Seitún and Andrés T. Raggio, brother of Rómulo Raggio, the sponsor of the construction and donor of the building.

The school originally had two pavilions, the ''Lorenzo Raggio'' for the boys, and the ''María Celle de Raggio'' for the girls, both named in honour of the parents of the Raggio brothers. 

Andrés Raggio managed the project and directed the work. The school was inaugurated on 8 December 1924, in a ceremony that was attended by both the Argentine President [[Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear]] and the intendant of Buenos Aires, Carlos Noel.&lt;ref&gt;Escuelas Técnicas Raggio 90 años de vida (2015): Editotial Museo Archivo Raggio. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Other attendees included the president's lady Mrs. Regina Pacini, the secretaries of the intendant  Dr.&amp;nbsp;Emilio Ravignani and Don Antonio Barrier Nicholson. 

On the occasion of the expansion of the [[Plaza San Martín (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Martín]] in the ''Retiro'' neighborhood, the municipality dismounted the Argentinian Pavilion between 1932 and 1934 and transferred the [[La República Argentina (sculpture)|sculpture symbolizing the Argentinian Republic]] to the Raggio Technical School.

The school was donated to the City of Buenos Aires.{{when|date=May 2018}}

The [[Buenos Aires City Legislature]] declared of educational interest the approval for the 90 years of the foundation of the Raggio Technical Schools to be celebrated on 8 December of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislatura.gov.ar/noti_ver.php?ver=4214&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution, approved on 30 October 2014 in the session room gave rise to a commemoration that took place in the ''Salón Dorado'' of the Buenos Aires Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=http://www.lapostacapital.com.ar/index.php/ciudad/3962-escuelas-tecnicas-raggio-a-90-anos-de-su-fundacion |title=Escuelas Técnicas Raggio: a 90 años de su fundación |date=12 November 2014 |newspaper=La Posta Capital |language=es |accessdate=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building ==
Its romantics archs characterize the building as [[Neoclassical architecture]]. It was raised in two pavillions with the names of the Raggio marriage, María Celle for the female students, and Lorenzo Raggio for the male students, which worked separately as it was common then. The female pavillion was demolished in 1960 to unify the General Paz Avenue with Lugones Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;Escuelas Técnicas Raggio 90 años de vida (2015): Editorial Museo Archivo Raggio. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The school was donated to the City of Buenos Aires hall. Its open architectural approach is new, valuing the green spaces for expansion and recreational areas

== Museum ==
Inside the school there is the techno-educational museum Lorenzo Raggio, which objective is the recovering, restoring, and the cataloging of photographic, artistic, technical material found in the institution.

There are the ''[[Teatro Colón]]'' builders plans, that is a set of more than 30 plans from 1892 sealed by the architect [[Vittorio Meano]] studio, who was one of the three architects involved in the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1145480-hallan-planos-del-teatro-colon-en-el-deposito-de-una-escuela |title=Hallan planos del Teatro Colón en el depósito de una escuela |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These documents, that were in the school library for many years, were used by former teachers of the school, Federico Federicci and Cayetano Donato, who worked in the construction and in the maintenance of the Teatro Colón scenography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://huellascolon.atwebpages.com/hallazgo_en_las_escuelas_tcnicas_raggio.html|title=Hallazgo en las Escuelas Técnicas Raggio|last=|first=|date=|website=huellascolon.atwebpages.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Irish government BUDGET 2009.jpg|right]]
The Irish government budget for 2009 was delivered on 14 October 2008, as the first budget in the tenure of [[Fianna Fáil]]'s [[Brian Lenihan Jnr|Brian Lenihan]] as [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]] and the first of [[Taoiseach]] [[Brian Cowen]]'s tenure. It was brought forward from its usual December date due to the [[global financial crisis of 2008|global financial crisis]]. The budget, labelled "the toughest in many years",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/1009/1223445618089.html|title=Ministers prepare for toughest budget in years|date=9 October 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; included a number of controversial measures such as a proposed income levy and the withdrawal of previously promised [[HPV vaccine]]s for schoolgirls. Other results of the budget included a new income levy being imposed on all workers above a specified threshold and the closure of a number of [[Irish Army]] barracks near the border with [[Northern Ireland]].

Public outcry arose over the proposed withdrawal of medical cards and the reinstatement of university fees. A series of demonstrations ensued amongst teachers and farmers, whilst on 22 October 2008, at least 25,000 pensioners and students descended in solidarity on government buildings at [[Leinster House]], [[Kildare Street]], Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2008/1023/1224713994987.html?via=rel|title=Thousands march in day of anti-Budget protests|date=23 December 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes to education led to a ministerial meeting with three [[Church of Ireland]] bishops over what was viewed as a disproportionate level of cuts to be suffered by Protestant secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breaking/ireland/mhidojideycw/|title=COI bishops to meet Education Minister over Budget cuts.|date=12 November 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=''[[Irish Examiner]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separately, representatives of the Roman Catholic Church were assured by [[Minister for Education and Skills|Minister for Education and Science]] [[Batt O'Keeffe]] that it would continue to be able to provide religious instruction to pupils in primary schools not under its patronage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/1113/1226408582468.html|title=O'Keeffe reassures on religious instruction|date=13 November 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebellion within the ranks of the ruling [[coalition]] government led to a number of defections of disenchanted [[Government of the 30th Dáil|coalition members]]. [[County Wicklow]] TD [[Joe Behan]] resigned from the Fianna Fáil party in protests at the proposed medical card changes. He, alongside two other government deputies, later voted against his former colleagues in two crucial [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] votes on medical cards and cancer vaccines. These defections reduced the Irish government's majority of twelve by one quarter.

== Announcement ==
The Irish government announced on 3 September 2008 that it was to bring forward the 2009 government budget from its usual December date to 14 October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/0903/breaking70.htm|title=Budget moved to October amid economic gloom|date=3 September 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement the government claimed that this was largely due to a decrease in the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/0903/breaking71.html?via=rel|title=Government statement on Budget 2009|date=3 September 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Important budget features ==
Irish government budget for 2009 introduced a number of new proposals which generated controversy in the weeks that followed. Ultimately a number of these proposals were either altered or abolished entirely.
[[File:Small-cheque.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The budget announcement included an increase in [[stamp duty]] on [[cheque]]s.]]
The initial announcements included:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1014/budgetmain-business.html|title=Budget of difficult choices – Lenihan|date=14 October 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=[[Radio Telefís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Budget main points"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/budget-2009/news/budget-main-points-1498698.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130217204956/http://www.independent.ie/national-news/budget-2009/news/budget-main-points-1498698.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 February 2013 |title=Budget main points - |date=14 October 2008 |accessdate=28 August 2009 |publisher=[[Irish Independent]] |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A new levy of between 1% and 2% on all incomes.
* Excise duties on cigarettes, wine and petrol all increased. The price of 20 cigarettes and bottles of wine were both increased by 50c. The price of a litre of petrol increased by 8c. Betting tax doubled to 2%, whilst motor tax increased by between 4% and 5%.
* [[Deposit Interest Retention Tax|DIRT]] rates, motor tax and [[Value added tax|VAT]] all increased.  The standard rate of VAT rose by 0.5% to 21.5%,&lt;ref name="Budget main points"/&gt; whilst DIRT rose 3% to 23%.
* Automatic entitlement to a medical card for the over-70s was abolished.
* Old-age pensions increased by €7 per week.
* Limitations were placed on entitlements to child benefit and childcare supplement.
* A €200 levy was imposed on employer-provided parking spaces in urban centres.
* 41 state agencies and bodies were to be abolished, amalgamated or privatised.
* There was to be a slowdown in [[Decentralization|decentralisation]].
* [[Stamp duty]] on [[ATM card]]s was halved, paid for by an increase in stamp duty on [[cheque]]s.
* Extra stamp duty relief was announced for first time buyers as was an increase in the size of local council mortgages, and a cut in stamp duty on commercial property.
* Ministers and Ministers of State took a 10% pay cut.

Lenihan expected the economy to decrease by 1.5% in 2009, as measured by GNP, with GDP contracting by 0.75%. He suggested that unemployment would increase to 7.3% but inflation would decrease to 2.5%. He suggested a budget deficit of 6.5% of GDP in 2009, (compared to the EU limit of 3%). Current spending was predicted to rise by 1.8%, with a current deficit of just over €4.7 billion and a capital deficit of €8.7 billion expected.

== Health cuts ==

=== Medical card controversy ===
Prior to the announcement of the government budget on 14 October 2008, each person over the age of seventy living in the [[Republic of Ireland]] was entitled to a [[medical card]] providing free medical, dental and optical treatment and medicines. The budget proposed to change this and introduced a means-tested system of benefits. The proposed income eligibility limits to be introduced for over seventies were published on the [[Health Service Executive]]'s website on 15 October 2008. The site stated that the net weekly income limit for medical card eligibility would be €201.50 for a single person, €173.50 for a single person living with a family and €298 for a married couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1015/budgethealth.html|title=Income eligibility on medical card published|date=15 October 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=[[Radio Telefís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One day later, these eligibility levels were increased so that the income rate for a single person would be €240.30, the income rate for a married couple was increased to €480.60 per week, whilst the previously proposed rate of €173.50 for a single person living with a family was abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1016/budgethealth.html|title=Changes in eligibility for medical cards|date=16 October 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=[[Radio Telefís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant political upheaval in the [[Oireachtas]] followed the publication of the proposals. On 17 October, County Wicklow Deputy Joe Behan resigned his position citing his discomfort with the medical card changes and the proposals to increase school class sizes. He suggested that past [[Taoiseach|taoisigh]] [[Éamon de Valera]] and [[Seán Lemass]] "would be turning in their graves at the decisions made in the past week".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1017/budgethealth.html|title=Behan resigns in protest at Budget|date=17 October 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=[[Radio Telefís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] Deputy [[Finian McGrath]] then threatened to withdraw his support for the government unless the plan to remove the overs 70s automatic right to a medical card was withdrawn completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1018/budgethealth.html|title=McGrath threatens to withdraw over card move|date=18 October 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=[[Radio Telefís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taoiseach]] [[Brian Cowen]] postponed a planned trip to [[People's Republic of China|China]], sending [[Minister for Education and Skills|Minister for Education and Science]] [[Batt O'Keeffe]] ahead to lead the delegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1019/budgethealth.html|title=Cowen calls for more time on cards row|date=19 October 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=[[Radio Telefís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leinsterhouse.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Leinster House]] on [[Kildare Street]], Dublin ''(above)'' was the target of many protests following the government budget announcement in October 2008.]]

Despite a government promise to retain medical cards for 95% of over-70s, an estimated 15,000 pensioners joined in a demonstration organised by the [[Irish Senior Citizens Parliament]] on 22 October. This protest, dubbed "the grey army" by media reports&lt;ref name="Revolution"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2008/1023/1224713994966.html|title='Maybe this is what the revolution looks like,' says onlooking TD|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; included representatives from organisations such as the [[Tara Disabled Mineworkers]], [[Pensioners' Association]], [[Mayo Active Retirement Association]] and the [[Socialist Party (Ireland)|Socialist Party]] as well as numerous independent protesters, marched on Dublin's Leinster House to protest the changes to their medical card scheme. [[Iarnród Éireann]] claimed that up to 1,000 pensioners had travelled on early morning trains from Counties [[County Cork|Cork]] and [[County Kerry|Kerry]] for the protest rally, with a spokesman suggesting that the 06:30 and 07:30 trains from Cork were particularly busy. An extra train had to be commissioned from Cork at 08:20 to cope with the demand by pensioners for transport to reach Dublin in time for the demonstration. All five carriages on the 07:30 train were fully booked by the previous evening; ironically, many of the passengers were pensioners using their free travel passes also provided by the government. The pensioners also availed themselves of taxis offering free journeys to the over-70s especially for the protest. One elderly man clutched a banner heralding the invitation "Just shoot us, it would be quicker".&lt;ref name="Revolution"/&gt;

Later that evening, a motion put forward by the opposition party [[Fine Gael]] seeking a reversal of the government's decision was defeated by 81–74 in a vote which took place in [[Dáil Éireann]]. Behan and McGrath both voted with the Opposition for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1022/budgethealth.html|title=Fine Gael medical card motion defeated|date=22 October 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=[[Radio Telefís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cervical cancer vaccine withdrawal ===
A €10million scheme to vaccinate 26,000 12-year-olds against [[cervical cancer]] by September 2009 was announced in September 2008.

== Education cuts ==

=== University fees controversy ===
On the same day as the pensioners protested, the students of Ireland also protested over a proposal to reinstate university fees. On 11 August 2008, Ireland's Minister for Education and Science, Batt O'Keeffe, had indicated that fees for university students were back on the agenda in a move which contravened prior government policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2008/0811/1218232690542.html|title=University fees for better off are back on agenda says O'Keeffe|date=11 August 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; University fees were abolished in 1995 by the [[Fine Gael]]-[[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]] government. With university presidents putting pressure on the government to approve this proposal, Brian Lenihan announced an increase in the annual college registration fee by €600 on budget day. The [[Union of Students in Ireland]] (USI) arranged a protest in response to claims that any increase in tuition fees would prevent many from attending college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/breaking-news/national-news/students-to-protest-against-threat-of-fees-reintroduction-1505084.html|title=Students to protest against threat of fees reintroduction|date=22 October 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite intense [[Garda Síochána|garda]] presence, the 14:00 lunchtime protest of 15,000 students caused widespread traffic disruption in Dublin city centre, with the students gathering in [[Parnell Square]] ahead of a steel drum beating march down [[O'Connell Street]], on to [[College Green]], up [[Dawson Street]] and across [[Molesworth Street (Dublin)|Molesworth Street]]. The march culminated in a rally outside the national parliament at Leinster House as the protesters were addressed by student leaders and opposition politicians. In what the USI President Shane Kelly called "one of the largest student protests in years", students waved banners and placards imprinted with the slogans "education not recession", "free fees means more degrees" and "[[Enda Kenny]] (leader of the Opposition) would not approve of this" and chanted a multitude of dialogues such as "no cutbacks, no fees, no Fianna Fáil TDs" and "education is a right not a privilege". TDs and senators waited at Leinster House to address the students upon their arrival included [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] education spokesperson [[Ruairi Quinn]], [[Fine Gael]] education spokesperson [[Brian Hayes (politician)|Brian Hayes]], [[Sinn Féin]] Senator [[Pearse Doherty]] and Independent Senator [[Ivana Bacik]].
There were no arrests and no trouble was reported. Quinn stated it was possible that the students demands would be met since the government had backed down on the budgetary issues of medical cards and income levies. A spokeswoman for Minister for Education and Science Batt O'Keeffe was said to have responded to a request to meet student leaders but later cancelled this "due to commitments arising following the budget".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/1023/1224625124742.html|title=10,000 students take to streets|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, a number of government ministers have encountered hostility from students whilst visiting campuses at [[University College Dublin]] and [[National University of Ireland, Galway]]. Three people were arrested for breaches of the peace following two minor scuffles as 100 students took part in a banner-bearing protest at the [[Clinton Institute]] on the [[Belfield, Dublin|Belfield]] campus of UCD on 20 October 2008. Brian Lenihan was to chair a function at the Institute but met with a blockade as students responded to the proposed barrier to their education by creating a physical barrier of their own against the Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/1021/1224454426062.html|title=Three arrested in UCD as students protest about fees|date=21 October 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the evening of 12 November 2008, student campaign group [[Free Education for Everyone]] (FEE) attempted to blockade Minister of State, [[Conor Lenihan]] (a brother of Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan) from his visit to University College Dublin, in protest at the proposed re-introduction of university fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breaking/ireland/mhidojqlsney/|title=UCD students protest over fees re-introduction|date=12 November 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=''[[Irish Examiner]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Quadrangle, National University of Ireland, Galway.jpg|left|thumb|200px|In December 2008, the [[Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs]] [[Éamon Ó Cuív]] and his secretary became involved in a scuffle with student protesters whilst wandering around the Quadrangle ''(front entrance pictured above)'' at [[National University of Ireland, Galway|NUI Galway]].]]

Meanwhile, at NUI Galway on the evening of 9 December 2008, the Irish [[Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs]] [[Éamon Ó Cuív]] became involved in a violent student demonstration which made national headlines. Ó Cuív was on the campus for the official launch of a new €50 million engineering building in place of the Minister for Education and Science Batt O'Keeffe, who had pulled out over fears that he would be met with violent action. As he entered the Quadrangle Ó Cuív was met by a group of fifty students, one of whom the Minister later accused of manhandling his secretary. Ó Cuív stepped in and physically assailed at least one protester by the arms as himself and his assistants were blockaded against a wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/1210/galway.html|title=Minister in confrontation with students|date=10 December 2008|accessdate=9 January 2009|publisher=[[Radio Telefís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; University security intervened and brought the Minister and his assistants to another door which they managed to successfully manoeuvre away from the baying crowd. A spokeswoman claimed that the crowd crushed the Minister's secretary against a wall and kicked her as one of the students set about "waving a big stick at her". A protester insisted that the demonstration had only become violent when Ó Cuív became physically active. The protest was organised by [[NUI, Galway Students' Union]] and FEE in the form of the NUIG societies of Labour Youth, Ógra Sinn Féin, Young Greens and Young Fine Gael. Ó Cuív was previously targeted by some of the same students who stormed and occupied his constituency office for over an hour less than a week prior to the university riot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/mhidsnsnkfmh/|title=Minister 'right to restrain protesting student'|date=10 December 2008|accessdate=9 January 2009|publisher=BreakingNews.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 February 2009, former [[Taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]] was blockaded and jostled out of NUI Galway by a group of angry students protesting over the reintroduction of fees as he attempted to lecture the [[Literary and Debating Society (NUI, Galway)|Literary and Debating Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0203/fees.html|title=Protest forces cancellation of Ahern speech|date=3 February 2009|accessdate=3 February 2009|publisher=[[Radio Telefís Éireann|RTÉ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November 2008, 3000 students were involved in a lunchtime anti-fees protest on [[O'Connell Street, Sligo]]. The students chanted slogans such as "no cutbacks, no fees, no Fianna Fáil TDs" and carried a variety of posters such as "the [[Batt O'Keeffe|Batt-man]] is Robin students", whilst one waved a placard advertising his "[[Ford Fiesta]] for sale" followed by his mobile number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/1113/1226408582454.html|title=3,000 students protest against fees in Sligo|date=13 November 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Substitute teachers controversy ===
Brian Lenihan encountered further controversy over his proposal to reduce the number of substitute teachers made available to schools. More protests followed as the teachers unions took to the streets in [[Galway]], [[Offaly]] (which included people from [[Kilkenny]], [[Laois]], [[Offaly]], [[County Meath|Meath]], [[Westmeath]], [[Longford]] and [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breaking/ireland/mhidgbmhidkf/|title=Teachers and parents to protest at education cuts|date=15 November 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=''[[Irish Examiner]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and [[Donegal]] (which included 5,000 people from Donegal, [[County Leitrim|Leitrim]] and [[Sligo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breaking/ireland/mhidideycwmh/|title=Protest in Donegal over education cuts|date=29 November 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=''[[Irish Examiner]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;) before a mass protest of at least 10,000 people through Dublin on 6 December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breaking/ireland/mhidsneyausn/|title=Thousands to protest education cuts|date=6 December 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=''[[Irish Examiner]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a cost of €2million, the Department of Education then readjusted some of the substitution teacher cuts called for by Lenihan in his budget. Under a deal agreed with the schools, each would receive substitution cover composed of a certain number of hours based upon the number of teachers absent on a particular day. Primary schools would receive substitute cover for teachers on uncertified sick leave after their first day of absence. Schools with more than one teacher absent would receive substitute cover for the second day of absence. Full cover would be provided in schools with two teachers or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breaking/ireland/mhsnaucwidql/|title=Department of Education rolls back on Budget cuts|date=12 December 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=''[[Irish Examiner]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protestant Schooling Controversy ===
The minority Protestant population in the Republic were particularly incensed [http://www.independent.ie/national-news/protestants-outraged-over--schools-budget-discrimation-1875158.html] by cuts announced by the Minister for Education to grants previously available to the 21 Protestant denomination secondary schools which breached a 40-year-old agreement reached when free secondary education was introduced in the Republic by the then Minister for Education, [[Donogh O'Malley]].&lt;ref name="it-surprise-flare-up"&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/1024/1224257388476.html Surprise flare-up at €3m cut to Protestant schools], Seán Flynn, Analysis, [[The Irish Times]], 24 October 2009, retrieved 27 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Under that agreement, Protestant secondary schools which had to provide a boarding element (and therefore charge fees) to provide education for the widespread but sparse Protestant population were treated in the same manner as "free" Roman Catholic schools.&lt;ref name="it-surprise-flare-up"/&gt; The Protestant community in return accepted that they could not expect the State to provide a "free" secondary school in every locality, and that they would have to pay a level of fees to educate their children.&lt;ref name="it-surprise-flare-up"/&gt; It was planned that Protestant churches through their administration of the grants provided by the Department would ensure that those least able to pay fees are assisted to the greatest extent possible.&lt;ref name="it-surprise-flare-up"/&gt;

In October 2008, the Minister of Education grouped these Protestant schools which provided boarding&lt;!-- is the board optional? --&gt; for students living at a distance into the same category as Roman Catholic schools which charged fees.&lt;ref name="it-surprise-flare-up"/&gt; This change meant that the schools must employ fewer teachers per child, and the schools would not receive government funding for non-teaching staff, as the free Roman Catholic schools do.&lt;ref name="it-pamela-duncan"/&gt; Opposition to these cuts is being mounted by the Church of Ireland, the Methodist Church and the Presbyterian Church as well as the schools and parents.&lt;ref name="it-pamela-duncan"&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/1005/1224255887534.html Campaign to resist cuts for Protestant schools intensifies], Pamela Duncan, [[The Irish Times]], 5 October 2009, retrieved 27 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="it-gordon-linney"&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/1005/1224255886694.html Cuts pose a real threat to future of Protestant schools], Gordon Linney, Opinion, [[The Irish Times]], 5 October 2009, retrieved 27 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Income levy difficulties ==
Unions warned the Irish government that its proposal to introduce an income levy of between 1% and 2% on all incomes would undermine a previously negotiated national pay agreement. In response, the government abolished the proposal and replaced it with a 3% levy on all incomes over €250,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breaking/ireland/mhidgbojgbgb/|title=Govt planning 3% income levy on high earners|date=17 November 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=''[[Irish Examiner]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social welfare controversy ==
Within the government budget was announced a Social Welfare Bill worth €515 million. When the [[Minister for Social Protection|Minister for Social and Family Affairs]], [[Mary Hanafin]] introduced it to Dáil Éireann she was accused of "kicking the unemployed when they are down". An Opposition attempt to defeat the Bill due to "savage cuts" was again defeated, this time by 68–60. Labour Party spokesperson [[Róisín Shortall]] objected saying "it provides for savage cuts on the most vulnerable people in our society, and it deliberately targets the poor, the unemployed, children and people with disabilities". Fine Gael spokesperson [[Olwyn Enright]] objected because of the Minister's intention "to bring in amendments on Committee Stage two days after the Bill's publication", to abolish the [[Combat Poverty Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/1112/1226408554767.html|title=Hanafin accused of 'kicking the unemployed when they are down'|date=12 November 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortall also criticised a proposal to remove [[child benefit]] from 18-year-olds, saying it would affect poorer children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/1112/1226408554763.html|title=Removal of child benefit criticised|date=12 November 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Farming protests ==
On 29 November 2008, approximately 300 farmers protested over budget cuts which affected them in [[Offaly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breaking/ireland/mhidideymhau/|title=Offaly farmers protest over Budget cuts|date=29 November 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=''[[Irish Examiner]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The farmers, members of the [[Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association]], demonstrated outside the Tullamore Court Hotel where Taoiseach Brian Cowen was attending a meeting with county councillors from around the country. [[Tánaiste]] and [[Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation|Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment]] [[Mary Coughlan (politician)|Mary Coughlan]] spoke at the event at which she, Cowen and [[Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport|Minister for Transport]] [[Noel Dempsey]], Minister for Education and Science Batt O'Keeffe and [[Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine|Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] [[Brendan Smith (politician)|Brendan Smith]] face questions on their various roles in the budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breaking/ireland/mhidideyojgb/|title=FF councillors to quiz Taoiseach on Budget cuts|date=29 November 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=''[[Irish Examiner]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 7,000 farmers from [[County Clare|Clare]], [[Limerick]], [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]], [[County Cork|Cork]], [[County Kerry|Kerry]], [[County Galway|Galway]], [[County Offaly|Offaly]], [[County Roscommon|Roscommon]] and [[County Wexford|Wexford]] were involved in a mass demonstration in Ennis on 30 November 2008. Padraig Walshe, the President of the [[Irish Farmers Association]] (IFA), claimed budget cutbacks would affect his union's members and would lead to a €20 million loss to farmers in the region each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breaking/ireland/mhididgbkfid/|title=IFA: We won't accept Budget cuts|date=30 November 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=''[[Irish Examiner]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of '''Higher Education Leadership''' encompasses primarily the academic disciplines of leadership and organizational theory.

Founded in 1976, the Association for the Study of Higher Education (ASHE) is a national organization of scholars dedicated to higher education as a field of study. Relevant journals include the ''[[American Educational Research Association#Journals of AERA|American Educational Research Journal]]'' and ''[[Studies in Higher Education]]'' and ''Research in Higher Education''.

Many colleges and universities offer Ph.D. and Ed.D. programs in higher education administration and leadership, including [[Eastern Michigan University]].

[[Image:Greek hoplite.png|right|thumb|A Greek hoplite, armed with spear and shield]]
'''Hoplology''' is a science that studies human combative behavior and performance.

==Etymology and history of the term==
The word ''hoplology'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] terms ''hoplos'' (a mythical plate-armored animal) and ὅπλον ''hóplon'', a wooden shield carried by some warriors in ancient Greece.  The word ''[[hoplite]]'', derived from ''hoplon'', is the term for the classical Greek [[warrior]] who carried such a shield. The field originates in the 19th century with [[Richard Francis Burton|Sir Richard Burton]]; although the origin of the word is often attributed to Burton, there are earlier references to it.&lt;ref name="hacc1" /&gt;  Despite the work of Burton and a few others, it was not until the 1960s that hoplology took shape as an academic field of study under the leadership of [[Donn F. Draeger]].&lt;ref name="hacc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoplology.com/articles_detail.asp?id=9|title=Hoplology and Combative Culture: Part 1|accessdate=2009-03-07|last=Wiley|first=Mark V.|publisher=The International Hoplology Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoplology was at some time defined as the science of "arms and weapons of offense and defence, human and bestial" (Burton, 1884),&lt;ref&gt;Richard Francis Burton - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MGmbAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=History+of+swords&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMI6e-j2pL8xgIVAu8UCh2lYglG#v=onepage&amp;q=History%20of%20swords&amp;f=false The Book of the Sword: A History of Daggers, Sabers, and Scimitars from Ancient Times to the Modern Day - 7th page of ''Chapter 1 - Preamble: on the Origin of Weapons''] published by [[Skyhorse Publishing]], Inc. 20 November 2013, 336 pages, {{ISBN|1628738472}} [Retrieved 2015-07-27]&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently as "the study of the basis, patterns, relationships, and significances of combative behavior at all levels of social complexity" (Draeger, 1982).&lt;ref name="hoplology.com"&gt;International Hoplology Society - [http://www.hoplology.com/about.htm home-page] published by the International Hoplology Society, Inc. 1998-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Sid Campbell, a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] level, [[tenth dan]]-ranked in [[karate]], defines hoplology as "the study of the evolution and development of human combatitive behaviour and performance ... the study of how people fight, why they fight, and how different cultures manifest those behaviours."&lt;ref&gt;Sid Campbell - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZHdRcezT3bwC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=hoplology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAzgeahUKEwitmv7B2YHHAhVC1hQKHUIMDg8#v=onepage&amp;q=hoplology&amp;f=false Warrior Arts and Weapons of Ancient Hawai'i] Blue Snake Books 2006, 266 pages, {{ISBN|1583941606}} [Retrieved 2015-07-30]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The International Hoplology Society==
Founded by Major Donn F. Draeger (USMC Ret.) (1922-1982), the International Hoplology Society ("IHS") exists to study the evolution and development of human combative behavior. Draeger had prior research and personal experience of classical fighting systems.

Draeger's student and colleague, Hunter B. Armstrong, carries on the hoplological tradition as director of IHS. He is a leading authority on combative behavior and performance. He has trained in numerous Asian and Western martial arts from a young age. He has spent a lifetime studying hoplology and related areas, including functional conditioning for combat. He currently trains military and law enforcement around the world in these areas. He works closely with military and law enforcement, and has been central to the most recent recreation of the [[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program]] (MCMAP).

In recent years, with the advent of the [[Modern Army Combatives]] (MAC) Program in the [[US Army]] and the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP), there has been a rapid growth in both scientific and academic research. With [[Matt Larsen]], the father of the MAC program, as a catalyst, research departments are growing at universities across the United States. One of the first such programs was at [[Kansas State University]]; the program is currently defunct.&lt;ref&gt;The Collegian - [http://www.kstatecollegian.com/news/modern-combatives-program-cancelled-due-to-budget-concerns-1.2165227 Modern combatives program cancelled due to budget concerns] published by The Collegian Feb 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Hoplology encompasses the segment of human culture concerned with weapons, armor, combative accouterments and fighting systems, in regard to their technical characteristics and the ways in which they interact with the economic, political, social and religious institutions of human societies, and  has three main research areas: technological, functional, and behavioral.

* Technological hoplology studies the development of weapons, armor, and other combative tools in relation to the contexts in which they are created.
*Functional hoplology delves into the structure, development, and organization of combative systems and their relationship to the application of fighting and weapons.
* Behavioral hoplology encompasses the psychological and physiological factors that affect human’s combative behavior and development of combative capabilities such as weapons or fighting systems. The broad subject range of behavioral hoplology means it also includes the effects that culture has had on man’s evolution as a group-social animal.

There are three widely accepted axioms in hoplological studies.&lt;ref name="hoplology.com"/&gt;

* human combative behavior is rooted in man’s [[Human evolution|evolution]]. 
* humans exhibit two types of aggression: affective aggression and predatory aggression. Both forms evolved from different survival needs as both a group-social animal and as a hunting animal. 
* the evolution of human combative behavior is directly linked to the use of weapons. That is to say that the use of weapons is linked with and reflects combative performance and behavior.

A variation on the pragmatics of hoplological understanding is found in theatrical representations of combat.&lt;ref name="Meron Langsner"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dMUXQMBPyq4C&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=hoplology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBmoVChMI7uLa-eaKxwIVSNEUCh0JCAfT#v=onepage&amp;q=hoplology&amp;f=false|author=Meron Langsner|title=Text &amp; Presentation, 2006|publisher=McFarland, 5 Feb 2007, 260 pages, (edited by Stratos E. Constantinidi), {{ISBN|0786455411}}, ''Volume 3 of The Comparative Drama Conference Series''|accessdate=2015-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While hoplology is still in its infancy, it has become an accepted area of study by scholars in several related disciplines such as [[combative psychology]], [[killology]], [[anthropology]], and [[military history]].

==The hoplological view on violence==
The entrenched nature of violence in human behavior is generally well understood. The skill and potential of deadly aggression is something within human genetics which predisposes humans to violent behavior. However, the genetics that predispose humans to violence is highly influenced by environmental factors. Humans will only tap into their violent potential once the need has arisen. Human genetics have developed an on-off switch in the brain. On the on side "…the fighting activity itself is stimulated by individual and communal thrill, enjoyment in the competitive exercise of spiritual and physical faculties, and even cruelty, blood lust, and killing ecstasy." (Gat 2006) On the off-side violence is deterred away by emotions through fear, revulsion at violence and bloodshed, physical fatigue, compassion, and spirituality. So if the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are present, then he will be violent. If the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are not present, he will abstain and deter violence.&lt;ref&gt;Gat, Azar. War in Human Civilization. New York: Oxford UP, USA, 2006. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Huff 'n'puff equipment.png|right|frame|Huff and Puff Apparatus respiration demonstration]]

The '''huff and puff apparatus''' is used in school [[biology]] labs to demonstrate that [[carbon dioxide]] is a product of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]].  A pupil breathes in and out of the middle tube. The glass tubing is arranged in such a way that one flask bubbles as the pupils breathes in, the other as the pupil breathes out. A suitable carbon dioxide indicator, such as [[limewater]] or [[bicarbonate indicator]] shows the increased presence of carbon dioxide in the outgoing breath.This turns the bicarbonate into milky white substance.

'''Instructional capital''' is a term used in educational administration after the 1960s, to reflect [[capital (economics)|capital]] resulting from investment in producing learning materials.

Some have objected to this phrasing, which is an elaboration of referring to training as "[[human capital]]", either for the same reason that phrase is objectionable, or on the grounds that it implies that the human in which the knowledge is "invested" is a resource to be exploited.

Instructional capital can be used to guide or limit or restrict action by people ([[individual capital]]) or equipment ([[infrastructural capital]]) (if the learning materials are [[computer program]]s).  It cannot generally make either individuals or infrastructure do what they are not trained or designed to do, but it can help prevent them from doing most stupid, destructive and dangerous things.

When people begin to trust instructions, they tend to associate [[social capital]] with them, as symbolized by a [[brand]], [[flag]] or [[label]].  This usually opens up a possibility for those with power to start cheating and/or creating bad instructions that can no longer be trusted, but the good reputation of the brand, flag or label protects them from being caught for longer than would be the case without the [[symbol]] that is associated with good reputation.

As of April 2018, Inter-A is situated within [[Queen Elizabeth Secondary School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.surreyschools.ca/programsandservices/choice/Pages/Inter%20A.aspx|title=Inter A (8-12) - EDUCATION SERVICES|website=www.surreyschools.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is part of [[School District 36 Surrey]]. The program was formerly located at Kwantlen Park Secondary School.

==History==

The Inter-A program was devised by Victor Vollrath and John Harper. The two teachers were sharing a classroom and teaching at opposite sides, when they came to the realization that this way of teaching was highly productive for students. In fact, individual students with the skills and motivation to excel maintain this level of productivity to this day.  Thus, Inter-A was born.

The program was originally located at Len Shepherd Secondary School. There it remained for many years, and the school was separated into Inter-A and the original Len Shepherd students evenly.
Inter-A started off small, with thirty or less students ranging from grades 8-12.

Inter-A moved to Kwantlen Park Secondary School in 2002, opening the door to many more students. Victor Vollrath and John Harper retired as teachers a year later, but their roots are passed off onto the new teachers. The ideas of teamwork, self-motivation, community service and leadership and creativity that started the program still run strong today, and the program is looked favourably upon by the school district, for it has fallen into its guidelines without jeopardizing its intents.

===Academics===

Inter-A students can be found in the hallways at different times of the day, which suggests that Inter-A has more freedom than its mainstream counterpart. It offers all the electives necessary for graduation and a place at any [[University]] or [[College]] in [[British Columbia]] or in [[Canada]]. The main differences are that [[Physical Education]] is demanded of the students until graduation, Fine Arts programs are chosen by the students, and the Inter-A Component.

The students are broken off into two categories: Intermediates (grades 8-9) and Seniors (10-12). There are six blocks in the day, as opposed to the standard four to accommodate the average high school attention span. There are also six units of six (occasionally seven) weeks per school year, with a report card at the end of each one, as opposed to the two-semester system. Mathematically inclined students thrive in the at-your-own-pace [[math]] program, while those who struggle are asked how they can be helped.

===PE===

Physical Education is divided between Seniors and Intermediates on alternating days. Anyone can run a PE option, grade 8-12. The teachers run options to join as well.

[All marks are out of 100%, but are then scaled down to 75%. The remaining 25% goes to the Inter-A Component, which is based on three criteria. The three criteria are: Community Service (10%), Choice (10%), and CPP (5%).]

===Fine Arts===

Fine Arts occurs over the course of three blocks, one day a week. Like P.E, anyone can run an option for it with the options the teachers are running as well.

[All marks are out of 100%, but are then scaled down to 75%. The remaining 25% goes to the Inter-A Component, which is based on three criteria. The three criteria are: Community Service (10%), Choice (10%), and CPP (5%).]

===Community service===
Students earn credit by participating in community service. Ten hours of work is required every unit. A log must be kept by the students and signed by an appropriate overseer. Community Service can be completed within the school; 10% (the full service amount) may be gained that way. This can be as simple as tutoring a fellow peer, or as complex as running the school's [[recycling]] program. Many students go above and beyond, completing up to 20 hours of Community Service a unit. There are no "roll-over" hours

The other 5% can be gained from completing service around the community. Since most of the students are from the [[Greater Vancouver Area]], there are plenty of service opportunities available to them.

===CPP===
Career and Personal Planning is similar to CSL in the fact that students set goals for themselves. However, these goals are checked bi-weekly and must be signed by the pupil's legal guardian for the 5% to go into the student's marks. A portfolio of the student's work is also gathered in this class as evidence of their academic progress.

===Choice===

10% of an Inter-A student's marks consists of choice. Students in grade 7,8, and 9 can elect to run a choice seminar, which, if done well, can bring up a students choice mark by 4%. A choice seminar is a student-led class, based on their knowledge of a particular subject, whether it be soccer, or the history of the ukulele. The student will then be required to teach their peers about that particular subject, through visuals, demonstrations, group activities, or however else they see fit. Attending and handing in an assignment based on the leader's knowledge is worth 1% of an Inter-A students choice mark. 


The choice program allows for students to be exposed to many different new subjects which are not covered by the BC curriculum. Students are given the opportunity to gain a broad view of the world around them, and to gain public speaking, leadership, and teaching skills. 


===Extra languages===

[[French language|French]] is taught in Inter-A. However, if a student is taking a language class outside of Inter-A for extra credit, they can use that as their language credit and have the designated Language block as a spare. A record must be kept of the student's involvement, and the language must be one that makes the student eligible for graduation.

French in Inter-A used to be a work-at-your-own-pace program. However, after the departures of Vollrath and Harper it has gone back to regular classes. Grades 8-12 each have a different teacher taking them through different stages of French. A student can skip ahead if they show vast knowledge of the subject matter or finish the stages early.

===Math===

For students in grades eight through ten, Math is self paced. At the end of every chapter they must get their "Math Tracker" signed to signify they understand the concepts, then take the test. If they pass, they may go on to the next chapter. This age bracket sits in mixed age, mixed ability groups, called "Inter-A groups". The Inter-A group was made to teach group skills, leadership, and problem-solving. An Inter-A group should include even members of each gender, students of different ages/grades when possible, students of different skill levels and students who often do not work with each other.

Grades eleven and twelve students work with a teacher in a traditional setting, as opposed to the self-taught younger grades, as the subject matter is more difficult to grasp. However, once a week the younger students attend a Math Tutorial led by a teacher or a more experienced student. Calculus 12 is not offered in Inter-A at this time, but all three math streams (Apprenticeship and Workplace, Pre-Calculus, and Foundations of Math) are offered until the grade twelve level. 

===Extracurricular activities===

Students wishing to attend a post secondary art school are recommended to attend a specialized high school whose focus is more art-based. That is not to say that Inter-A children cannot participate in other school events; sports, theater and all clubs are open to members of Inter-A and Queen Elizabeth students.

Inter-A had an Ultimate team called "The Kwantlen Park Timberwolves". In the 2007/2008 season, Inter-A ultimate started the regular season with a 6-0 record for both the senior and junior teams. The Junior team is currently ranked 1st throughout British Columbia and the Senior team is ranked second in their division. 

A [[Reach for the Top]] team has been started. The team placed well in their first year of competition. However, this program has currently been suspended.

An Inter-A play is often run annually."The Grounding of Donnie Greener", was fabulously written by Roger Blenman, and was a tremendous success.

Inter-A has several very high-ranking [[Destination Imagination]] teams. The teams often place second or better in [[Province|Provincial]] Tournaments, and several have gone on to score highly at the World Finals in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]].

Math Club is available after school some days for students who struggle, need service, or just love math and need somewhere to do it.

Inter-A has an Executive Team, much like its own Student Council. They make important monetary and educational decisions about Inter-A and its future, as well as plan future field trips. It is led by students as an independent body, and elections are held every two units. All Inter-A students are invited to vote. 

A "Herd" is when the Inter-A students come together for an information session in one of the three Inter-A classrooms. "Apple Awards" are given at the end-of-the-year [[barbecue]]. They are given out during an outdoor herd to each student in a light-hearted manner. The awards are usually inside jokes suggested by friends or playful pokes at students given by the teachers. A red, BC grown apple is given to all students.

==Excursions==

Excursions in Inter-A can be divided into three categories:

===Day trips===

The small field trip in Inter-A is a typical field trip experience. Inter-A students have been to the Vancouver Aquarium, Chinatown, Geneskool, [[Bard on the Beach]], and Science World. Day trips are used as a way to give students a real-world application for work done in a classroom. 

===Overnight===
A field trip that lasts overnight. A great example is the annual "Inter-A Retreat" at the beginning of every year, which is three days, and two nights. The Retreat is in September of every year, and usually occurs at Camp Sunrise on the Sunshine Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.surreyschools.ca/programsandservices/choice/Shared%20Documents/District%20Form%202017.pdf|title=Inter-A District Form 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2015-2016 school year, it took place at Rockridge Canyon in [[Princeton, British Columbia]]. The Retreat is an opportunity for students and teachers to get to know each other before the year starts. This is especially helpful for new grade seven/eight students to integrate into the program with ease. 

===Overseas===

Inter-A is unique, as every second year the program offers a trip overseas for two to three weeks. The trip is expensive, but the response is excellent. Trips to Italy, France, Australia, Greece, England and other countries have been a tremendous success in integrating different cultures and ideals into the minds of the youth. Through Kwantlen Park, exchange programs with other students from [[Quebec]] were also available.

== Achievements ==

Besides producing a class of graduates that flourish both in academics and as human beings, the Inter-A program has consistently been regarded as one of the most notable institutes of secondary education in British Columbia. Through the Inter-A program, students learn self-motivation and direction, skills necessary for post-secondary education. With the skills developed in Inter-A many of the graduates excel in university level education with high exam scores gaining them acceptance to some of the most prestigious universities and other post-secondary institutions in Canada. Both founders of the program, Vic Vollrath and John Harper, have received national recognition awards for their excellence in teaching. Inter-A has placed their parent schools (Len Shepherd and Kwantlen Park Secondary) amongst the top public schools in British Columbia within recent years based on Grade 12 provincial exam marks.

A controversy arose from 2012 to 2016 over the supervision and final acceptance by the [[University of Wollongong]] (UOW) of a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] thesis titled "A critical analysis of the Australian government’s rationale for its vaccination policy" by Roslyn Judith (Judy) Wilyman, one of [[Australia]]'s "most vocal [[anti-vaccination]] activists".&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aus-doctor"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.australiandoctor.com.au/News/Latest-News/The-4-weirdest-anti-vaccination-stories-this-week |title=The 4 weirdest anti-vaccination stories this week |work=Australian Doctor |date=13 January 2016 |accessdate=14 January 2016 |first=Alice |last=Klein |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis came under heavy criticism from multiple directions, including medical professionals, due to claims within the thesis, including advancing a [[conspiracy theory]]&lt;ref name="7news"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/nsw/a/30561382/wollongong-uni-slammed-for-accepting-phd-thesis-on-anti-vax-conspiracies/ |title=Wollongong uni slammed for accepting PhD thesis on 'anti-vax conspiracies' |work=[[7 News]] |date=13 January 2016 |author=. |accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="australian-accepts" /&gt; whereby the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the pharmaceutical industry supposedly conspire to promote vaccinations in the absence of evidence of safety and efficacy.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-13/wilyman-phd/7086346 |title=University of Wollongong criticised over thesis by anti vaccination activist |work=[[ABC News (Australia)]] |date=13 January 2016 |accessdate=13 January 2016 |first=Emily |last=Laurence}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="australian-accepts"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/wollongong-university-accepts-thesis-on-vaccine-conspiracy/news-story/dbd57d8909779f4d82ece7b9ab8d520a |title=Wollongong University accepts thesis on vaccine ‘conspiracy’ |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date=13 January 2016 |author=Loussikian, Kylar |accessdate=14 January 2016 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The awarding of the thesis created questions about the standards being applied and whether or not the thesis supervisors and examiners had sufficient knowledge to oversee the research, and led to calls for the university to review the doctorate. A number of individuals and medical organisations – including academics and researchers from other parts of the University of Wollongong – spoke out against the findings of the thesis, emphasising the need for vaccinations in order to prevent serious disease; and the University of Wollongong was criticised for a perceived lack of transparency in their doctoral process and an alleged failure to uphold standards of scholarship.

The thesis was conducted from within the university's School of Humanities and Social Inquiry, under the primary supervision of cultural studies professor [[Brian Martin (social scientist)|Brian Martin]] and the co-supervision of sociologist [https://lha.uow.edu.au/hsi/contacts/UOW059282.html Andrew Whelan]{{who|date=May 2018}}. Although describing himself as "hardly a neutral observer", Martin argued that the questions raised about the work equate to biased attacks on Wilyman and himself.&lt;ref name="TheAus-MartinMartin"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/high-wired/when-fulltime-isnt-quite-that-and-queenslands-vet-goes-to-kerala/news-story/f142aded8b41660201b71f41b96243c1 |title=When fulltime isn’t quite that, and Queensland’s VET goes to Kerala |date=2 February 2016 |work=[[The Australian]] |author=. |access-date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university responded to the criticism by asserting that the research was conducted and examined under high standards, and spoke in defence of academic freedom. The University of Wollongong also agreed to conduct a review into their overall doctoral process, but the scope did not include specific PhD recipients, and therefore did not encompass Wilyman's work.&lt;ref name="uowreview" /&gt;

==Background==
Judith Wilyman was awarded a Masters by [[University of Wollongong]] (UOW) in 2007 in the Faculty of Law, Humanities and the Arts; her thesis topic was the Australian government's pertussis vaccine policy.&lt;ref name="mastersinvestigation"/&gt; Her thesis alleges a [[Autism-Vaccine Link|connection between vaccinations and autism]], a claim that was already [[MMR vaccine controversy|convincingly refuted]], and false claims that vaccines do not control [[Pertussis|whooping cough]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2007 Wilyman entered a PhD a program in the same faculty at UOW in 2007, with her dissertation focused also on Australian vaccination policy; in 2008 the supervision was transferred to [[Peter Dingle]] at [[Murdoch University]], and in 2011 supervision was transferred back to UOW under the supervision of [[Brian Martin (social scientist)|Brian Martin]].&lt;ref name=jw-member&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nocompulsoryvaccination.blogspot.com/2009/09/letter-on-coercive-vaccination.html |title=No Compulsory Vaccination - Letter on Coercive Vaccination campaigns |author1=Dorey, Meryl |author2=Wilyman, Judy |date=4 September 2009 |website=No Compulsory Vaccination AVN |access-date=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SB-lesson&gt;{{cite web |title=A lesson in "do your research" |author=Dunlop, Rachael |authorlink=Rachael Dunlop |url=http://scepticsbook.com/2012/02/03/a-lesson-in-do-your-research/ |accessdate=27 April 2016 |date=3 February 2012 |work=Sceptics Book }}&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis was accepted by UOW in 2016. Although details of the examiners have not been released, in May 2016 ''The Australian'' reported that one of two original examiners did not recommend that a PhD be granted. It was passed after a third academic evaluated the thesis and recommended changes.&lt;ref name=aus-third&gt;{{cite news |title=Third marker gave OK to anti-vac thesis |page=13 |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/third-marker-gave-ok-to-antivaccination-thesis-by-judy-wilyman/news-story/cbdf24fe7b4388f0fbf715354ebab8bb |date=11 May 2016 |author=Loussikian, Kylar |work=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=11 May 2016 |subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2009, Wilyman was a member of the [[Australian Vaccination-Skeptics Network]] (AVSN),&lt;ref name=jw-member/&gt; an anti-vaccination group,&lt;ref name="illawara-mercury"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/270596/vaccine-row-grieving-parents-slam-researcher/ |title=Vaccine row: grieving parents slam researcher |newspaper=[[Illawarra Mercury]] |date=10 June 2012 |accessdate=14 January 2016 |first=Cydonee |last=Mardon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jw-member/&gt;&lt;ref name=SB-lesson/&gt; and coordinates two anti-vaccination groups; Vaccination Decisions and Vaccination Choice.&lt;ref name=aus-third/&gt; 

In 2011 Wilyman opposed the [[HPV vaccination]] saying evidence about the vaccine's benefits were not clear,&lt;ref name="australian-accepts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sbs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="australian-defends"/&gt;  and it was reported that she claimed that [[Autism-Vaccine Link|vaccinations are linked to autism]].&lt;ref name="australian-accepts" /&gt;

In 2012 she invited controversy after the death of a child from [[whooping cough]], questioning "whether the family had been paid to use their daughter's death to promote vaccine",&lt;ref name="australian-defends"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/university-stands-by-anti-vaccine-student/story-e6frgcjx-1226481373743 |title=University stands by anti-vaccine student |author=Morton, Rick |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=14 January 2016 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news-mccaffrey"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/grieving-parents-speak-out-against-anti-vaccination-extremists/story-fnet08xa-1226650422913 |title=Grieving parents speak out against anti-vaccination extremists |work=[[The Sunday Telegraph (Sydney)]] |date=26 May 2013 |accessdate=14 January 2016 |first=Jane |last=Hansen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="illawara-mercury" /&gt; causing the family of the deceased to request that Wilyman not use their daughter's death in furthering her agenda.&lt;ref name="australian-defends" /&gt; 

In 2013, the [[Australian Medical Association]] (AMA) criticised the university's decision to fund Wilyman to attend a conference in the US. Wilyman was provided with $3,000 by the university to present a paper opposing [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV) vaccinations.&lt;ref name="abc 2014 1"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Anti-vaccination storm brewing at UOW |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-02-01/anti-vaccination/5232434 |work=[[ABC News (Australia)]]|access-date = 17 January 2016 |language=en-AU |date=1 February 2014 |author1=Laurence, Emily  |author2=McLaren, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abc 2014 2"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Claim of academic misconduct lodged against UoW vaccination sceptic |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-27/vaccination-academic/5921190 |work=[[ABC News (Australia)]] |author=. |access-date=17 January 2016 |language=en-AU |date=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was organised by [[predatory open access publishing]] company [[OMICS Publishing Group]], which has also been criticised for running [[predatory meetings]] with no effective standards for speaker selection.&lt;ref name=TheAus3&gt;{{cite news |title=University paid for anti-vaccine student to attend conference |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/university-paid-for-anti-vaccine-student-to-attend-conference/story-e6frgcjx-1226811558843 |accessdate=1 February 2016 |date=28 January 2014 |author=Morton, Rick |work=[[The Australian]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the criticism of Wilyman's trip, the university's Dean of Research, Tim Marchant, stated that the university upheld the principles of academic freedom and, accordingly, it was important to support Wilyman and the presentation of differing viewpoints, even when they were controversial.&lt;ref name="abc 2014 1" /&gt; Martin, who was supervising Wilyman's research, also supported the decision, arguing that the conference was a valuable experience for Wilyman.&lt;ref name=TheAus3 /&gt;

Questions of misconduct concerning Wilyman's Masters thesis were raised in 2014, and were investigated and cleared in 2015.&lt;ref name="abc 2014 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mastersinvestigation"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/wollongong-university-looks-at-releasing-more-wilyman-details/news-story/37f538e1a3997d2415ac077557809b90 |title=Wollongong University looks at releasing more Wilyman details |last=Loussikian |first=Kylar |date=27 January 2016 |work=[[The Australian]]| access-date=28 February 2016 |subscription=yes |quote=university's deputy vice-chancellor (research) Judy Raper wrote to Dr Wilyman to say she was "sincerely sorry for this to have happened".}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''The Australian'' reported that in 2014, "Wilyman [was] shielded from critics" by the university when their media office refused a request to promote The Australian Society for Immunology conference in Wollongong, saying if it "will be discussing vaccinations, we should steer well clear of doing any publicity. We don't want to inflame any opponents of ... Judy Wilyman". According to the university, they were attempting to limit "the vicious and repeated attacks being directed ... towards a then student"&lt;ref name=aus-shielded&gt;{{cite news |title=Judy Wilyman shielded from critics in low-key conference strategy |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/judy-wilyman-shielded-from-critics-in-lowkey-conference-promotion/news-story/6fbd40ae181f6522c0e9d149271bb21f |date=11 May 2016 |author=Loussikian, Kylar |work=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=11 May 2016 |subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims==
Biological scientist Helen Petousis Harris writes that the thesis abstract contains conclusion, and quotes Wilyman's aim of her thesis as an attempt to "assess the rigour of the claims supporting the efficacy, safety and necessity for the use of an expanding number of vaccines in the Australian Government’s National Immunisation Program".&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;Harris, Helen Petousis (14 January 2016). "[http://sciblogs.co.nz/diplomaticimmunity/2016/01/14/a-phd-by-stealth-bs-what-are-university-of-wollongong-thinking/ A PhD By Stealth (BS) – What are University of Wollongong thinking?]", ''Diplomatic Immunity'', [[Sciblogs.co.nz]]. Retrieved 3 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Brull reports that according to supervisor Brian Martin, Wilyman's thesis makes four major points:&lt;ref name="newmatilda" /&gt;

* Wilyman claims that the death rates from diseases in Australia had declined before most vaccines were introduced, leading to a suggestion that other factors may have had a role in the reduced infection rate.
* It is alleged in the thesis that Australia's vaccination policy follows international models, rather than being based on local conditions.
* In her thesis, Wilyman claims that there is a [[conflict of interest]] when research on vaccination is conducted by pharmaceutical companies.
* She alleges that some areas of research which relate to vaccination policy have not been examined, even though there may be value in doing so.&lt;ref name="Scienceblogs2016-01-14"&gt;{{cite web |title=Brian Martin and Judy Wilyman: Promoting antivaccine pseudoscience as "dissent" |url=http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2016/01/14/brian-martin-and-judy-wilyman-promoting-antivaccine-pseudoscience-as-dissent/ |author=Gorski, David |authorlink=David Gorski |website=Science Blogs |date=14 January 2016 |accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other, more specific, claims include that the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) formed a secret committee, which in turn orchestrated "hysteria relating to a global swine flu pandemic in 2009"&lt;ref name="australian-accepts" /&gt; and that the organisation is "perceived to be out of touch with global communities and … controlled by the interests of corporations and the World Bank".&lt;ref name="Australian-spruik" /&gt;

At one stage during Wilyman's candidature, Australian immunisation expert and advisor to the WHO Peter McIntyre offered to advise her on her research, but withdrew his offer as she was "not willing to entertain" alternative points of view that contradicted her beliefs.&lt;ref name="australian-withdraws"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/health/who-expert-withdraws-offer-of-advice-to-antivaxer/news-story/33f8816d4b3289010510d4b2d8012a75 |title=WHO expert withdraws offer of advice to anti-vaxer |last=Loussikian |first=Kylar |date=14 January 2014 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |subscription=yes |accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilyman's PhD thesis claims that "diseases for which vaccines are recommended have not been demonstrated to be a serious risk to the majority of children".&lt;ref name="mastersinvestigation" /&gt;

Medical academics and the [[Australian Medical Association]] (AMA) have questioned whether Martin had sufficient knowledge to supervise the thesis,&lt;ref name=Australian-spruik&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/health-science/antivaccination-activists-spruik-phd-thesis-as-proof-of-conspiracy/news-story/d74552da1a6875e2b0eea290094b590b |title=Anti-vaccination activists spruik PhD thesis as proof of conspiracy |last=Loussikian |first=Kylar |date=16 January 2016 |work=[[The Australian]]|access-date = 17 January 2016 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; with McIntyre observing "No doubt the examiners selected have credentials within that area of study but they are likely to lack necessary credentials in health sciences that would enable them to be aware of the full picture here".&lt;ref name="australian-withdraws" /&gt; Similarly, an editorial in ''[[The Australian]]'' was harshly critical of both Wilyman and the University. It dismissed the central idea of the thesis as "rather like a sociologist who insists that jet aircraft remain aloft only because of a conspiracy between aeronautical engineers and greedy airlines" and noted the problem of academic overreach, with the faculty presuming to judge the quality of work well outside its area of expertise. It characterised the University of Wollongong as putting itself on the wrong side in a "battle of life and death",&lt;ref name="australian-standards"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/editorials/academic-standards-on-the-line/news-story/6bee06824f7af35bb744e34cb9b4625c |title=Academic standards on the line |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date=15 January 2016 |author=. |accessdate=14 January 2016 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and questioned whether the granting of the PhD "could 'reasonably be expected' to lead to lower levels of vaccination?"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

''[[New Matilda]]'' journalist Michael Brull reports that Martin responded to the question of expertise by stating that Wilyman's thesis was about policy, and accordingly, "if anyone can lay claim to having special knowledge about policy, it is those who have researched policy itself". Expertise in immunology and epidemiology, according to Martin, can give "no special insight into vaccination policy". Brull advises against stripping Wilyman of her PhD as it may change her from being a "marginal quack" to a "persecuted martyr", and argues that the claims in the thesis identified by Martin are "issues of both politics and science", not only questions of policy, and therefore were more properly the domain of the hard sciences. Brull observes that the PhD avoided rigorous and informed peer review by being conducted through the University of Wollongong's social sciences faculty, thus avoiding serious scientific scrutiny with the examiners potentially being "out of their depth in dealing with questions of vaccination science".&lt;ref name="newmatilda"&gt;Brull, Michael. (7 February 2016).

==Academic health science sector responses==
[[University of Auckland]] biological scientist Helen Petousis Harris, who has a PhD in Vaccinology,&lt;ref name="newmatilda"/&gt; was highly critical of the thesis and writes:
:Wilyman's "references to support these outrageous comments are from the bottom dwelling literature that includes 50-year-old discussions along with well-established, thoroughly debunked pseudoscience. At no point does she mention any of the vast scientific literature that includes large clinical and epidemiological studies - or attempt a critique of it."&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;
:"It is [a] litany of deceitful reveries. How it could possibly pass as a piece of Doctoral level work is inexplicable and it has made no contribution to knowledge. Shame on you University of Wollongong."&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newmatilda"/&gt;

Saxon Smith, president of the [[New South Wales|NSW]] branch of the [[Australian Medical Association|AMA]], characterised it as "a thesis that’s talking about the science of medicine without any support of its argument from credible scientific literature", adding "the evidence is clear about the safety of vaccines."&lt;ref name="australian-withdraws" /&gt;

Alison Campbell, an associate dean and biological sciences lecturer at the [[University of Waikato]], produced a blistering analysis criticising the use of out-of-date references as well as pointing out numerous scientific errors in Wilyman’s master’s work, including calling the unexplained exclusion of two of four types of vaccine components "an alarming omission for a paper on immunisation".&lt;ref name=TheAust-criticism&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/wilyman-phd-on-vaccination-conspiracy-not-immune-to-criticism/news-story/7d046f8de702ce6315408305457468ca |title=Wilyman PhD on vaccination 'conspiracy' not immune to criticism |last=Loussikian |first=Kylar |date=20 January 2016 |work=[[The Australian]]|access-date = 29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Medical Journal of Australia]]'' criticised the university in awarding a PhD to a student "demonstrating a glaring lack of understanding of immunology and vaccine science," suggesting that unless legislation keeps the anti-vaccination movement in check "we are ushering in a dangerous time."&lt;ref name=MJAus1&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.mja.com.au/insight/2016/3/time-government-tackle-anti-vaxxers |title=Time for government to tackle anti-vaxxers |last=Hendel |first=Simon |date=1 February 2016 |work=[[The Medical Journal of Australia]]|access-date = 1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Dwyer (medicine)|John Dwyer]] [[Order of Australia|AO]], [[emeritus professor]] of medicine at the [[University of New South Wales]], wrote: "[Ms Wilyman] has endorsed a conspiracy theory where all sorts of organisations with claimed vested interests are putting pressure on WHO to hoodwink the world into believing that vaccines provide more benefits than they cause harm. Many well-established concepts in science are being challenged in this thesis with no data to support the conclusions provides [sic]."&lt;ref name="australian-accepts" /&gt; He pointed out that numerous leading scientists and at least five major scientific organisations are criticising the university for rewarding poor scholarship and asking that the thesis be re-examined by experts in immunology and epidemiology, which is what the thesis addresses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In a Feb 2016 media-release the [[Royal Australasian College of Physicians]] (RACP) directly questioned suggestions of bias from Wilyman. In challenging central arguments of her thesis, the RACP highlighted that the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration|TGA]] is the regulatory body responsive to the monitoring and investigation of any adverse events and any significant concerns around vaccination safety.&lt;ref name="racp"&gt;{{cite web |title=RACP: vaccination prevents infectious diseases and saves lives |url=http://www.racp.edu.au/docs/default-source/default-document-library/racp-vaccination-prevents-infectious-diseases-and-saves-lives.pdf |website=The [[Royal Australasian College of Physicians]] – Media Release |author=Walsh, David |accessdate=3 March 2016 |date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American surgical oncologist [[David Gorski]] refers to the thesis as an academic travesty, pseudoscientific and containing "easily refutable downright incorrect information." He also "has to wonder how much Martin buys into antivaccine pseudoscience", and as an example refers to Martin's prior defence of discredited [[Andrew Wakefield]]. Gorski goes on to say that "Martin has a history of being sympathetic to medical cranks. He views crank views as "medical dissent"".&lt;ref name="Scienceblogs2016-01-14" /&gt; In response Martin accused Gorski of being part of an "orchestrated" attack on Wilyman and the University of Wollongong led by Australian pro-science group Stop the Australian Vaccination Network (SAVN)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Martin |first1=Brian |authorlink=Brian Martin |title=An orchestrated attack on a PhD thesis |url=http://comments.bmartin.cc/2016/02/01/an-orchestrated-attack-on-a-phd-thesis/ |website=Brian's comments |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Gorski later wrote in [[ScienceBlogs]] that this accusation was based on a false argument that criticism of the scientific validity of Wilyman's thesis was an attack on the freedom to present dissenting views in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gorski |first1=David |authorlink=David Gorski |title=From deep in the heart of the "organized campaign" against Judy Wilyman's antivaccine PhD thesis |url=https://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2016/02/01/from-deep-in-the-heart-of-the-organized-campaign-against-judy-wilymans-antivaccine-phd-thesis |website=ScienceBlogs |publisher=Science 2.0 |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==University response==
Responding to the criticism of the thesis from several medical researchers and public health advocates who called for a review by the university's academic board,&lt;ref name="mercury conspiracy"&gt;{{Cite news |title=UOW panned for accepting thesis on vaccination 'conspiracy' |url=http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/3666031/uproar-over-uows-anti-vax-thesis/ |work=[[Illawarra Mercury]] |author=. |date=16 January 2016 |access-date=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the university reiterated that research is conducted under strict standards, and that they do not "restrict the subjects into which research may be undertaken just because they involve public controversy or because individuals or groups oppose the topic or the findings".&lt;ref name="sbs"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/01/13/wollongong-uni-accepts-anti-vaccination-thesis-citing-freedom-opinion |title=Wollongong Uni accepts anti-vaccination thesis citing 'freedom of opinion' |work=[[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS News]] |date=14 January 2016 |accessdate=14 January 2016 |first=Andrea |last=Booth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although very critical of the thesis, this view is partially shared by journalist Michael Brull, who argued that having "unorthodox or distasteful" opinions should not be grounds for the denial of a PhD. He goes on to support the freedom of such intellectual inquiry.&lt;ref name="newmatilda"/&gt;

In January 2016, the [[Vice Chancellor]] of the university, [[Paul Wellings]], announced a review into the doctoral process. However, the review did not examine specific doctorates, and therefore did not look at the awarding of Wilyman's PhD.&lt;ref name="uowreview"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hare |first=Julie |date=19 January 2016 |title=Anti-vax PhD not in uni's review |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/judy-wilymans-antivaccine-phd-not-included-in-unis-review/news-story/874833db483a8f733a7a52023b2caec5 |work=[[The Australian]] p3. |accessdate=8 March 2016 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion, the university's report found that their higher degree research policies and procedures were consistent with those at other comparable Australian universities.&lt;ref&gt;(June 2016), "[http://media.uow.edu.au/content/groups/public/@web/@media/documents/doc/uow217166.pdf UOW HDR Student Lifecycle Review]", University of Wollongong. Retrieved 22 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Immunology academic John Dwyer noted that even though the university's review made some "excellent recommendations for improving the postgraduate research students' experience", it "failed to address the vital question of matching the scientific question to be examined to the expertise of the supervisor and the ultimate reviewers".&lt;ref name=AusWorkload&gt;{{cite news |title=Higher education: uni's PhD overseers 'based on workload |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/higher-education-unis-phd-overseers-based-on-workload/news-story/9edc8cc544ba21eaa54561ce8b38a30c |author=Loussikian, Kylar |work=The Australian |date=23 June 2016 |subscription=yes|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the university, all theses are examined by two people with "unchallengeable knowledge in the field of study", but the university does not reveal the identities of the examiners or their respective academic fields.&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt; In March 2016, the university's compliance officer turned down a request to identify the examiners, arguing that "the examiners would be offended, humiliated or intimidated by the conduct of the media and the public once their names are released", concerned for "their physical, psychological or emotional wellbeing" and noting that current privacy laws forbid the release of the information.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/examiners-of-antivax-thesis-to-remain-anonymous-for-safety/news-story/dee35a2b0c07ed0c01c7935b3f6fa07f |title=Examiners of anti-vax thesis to remain anonymous 'for safety' |author=Loussikian, Kylar |date=2 March 2016 |work=[[The Australian]]| access-date = 2 March 2016 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Dwyer AO responded that the names of examiners would not have been required if the university had agreed to re-examine the thesis, adding "as we know they are social scientists not clinical scientists".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; In a rebuttal the [[Australian Skeptics]] considers UOW's statement of a possible "detrimental effect on the [examiner's] physical ... wellbeing" to be verging on a libellous depiction, as it "suggest[s] that the community critical of the PhD may physically attack the examiners".&lt;ref name=aus-skeptics&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.skeptics.com.au/2016/05/11/conflict-among-wilyman-phd-examiners/ |title=Conflict Among Wilyman PhD Examiners |author=Mendham, Tim |date=11 May 2016 |work=[[Australian Skeptics]]| access-date=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remonstrations==
In response to UOW and Wilyman's thesis an online petition called ''Stop the University of Wollongong's Spread of Disease and Death Via Anti-Vaccination PhD'' was established in January 2016&lt;ref name="mercury petition"&gt;{{Cite news |title=‘Travesty’: petition against UOW anti-vaccine thesis |url=http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/3668397/travesty-petition-against-uow-anti-vaccine-thesis/ |work=[[Illawarra Mercury]]|access-date = 17 January 2016 |date=17 January 2016 |last=Humphries |first=Glen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attracted over 2,100 signatures within the first few weeks. The petition reportedly states that UOW's acceptance of the thesis "demonstrates an anti-scientific culture at the University of Wollongong that is inimical to scholarship".&lt;ref name="newmatilda" /&gt;

At the same time over sixty of the university's health and medical academics and researchers jointly signed a statement that "the evidence is clear" in support of vaccination urging all parents to ensure their children are fully immunised,&lt;ref name="Med Obs furore"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Vax thesis furore: University academics unite to support immunisation |url=http://www.medicalobserver.com.au/professional-news/vax-thesis-furore-university-academics-unite-to-support-immunisation |website=Medical Observer |author=. |date=18 January 2016 |access-date=18 January 2016 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public Health Association of Australia president Heather Yeatman said the 65 academics wanted to clarify the scientific position and point out they are firmly behind vaccination and that “Universities need to publish papers based on sound evidence and the balance of evidence in relation to any matter”.&lt;ref name="australian-review"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/judy-wilymans-antivaccine-phd-not-included-in-unis-review/news-story/874833db483a8f733a7a52023b2caec5 |title=Judy Wilyman’s anti-vaccine PhD not included in uni’s review |last=Hare, Julie |date=19 January 2016 |work=[[The Australian]]|access-date = 19 January 2016 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A week later, representatives from 12 medical research and clinical societies also signed a supporting statement on behalf of 5,000 scientists and clinicians in the fields of microbiology, virology, immunology and infectious diseases concerned about vaccine-preventable diseases in the community.&lt;ref name="MedObs-societies"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Vax thesis furore: Infectious diseases societies voice condemnation |url=http://www.medicalobserver.com.au/professional-news/vax-thesis-furore-infectious-diseases-societies-voice-condemnation |website=Medical Observer|access-date = 29 January 2016 |date=27 January 2016 |last=Wood, Paddy |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eminent research biologist Sir [[Gustav Nossal]] was one of signatories, and Jonathan Iredale who drafted the statement said "It’s not about academic freedom; it’s an academic issue. If the thesis comes from poor scholarship then that is something the university must deal with".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/the-great-atar-hoax/news-story/8040b17aec17016660baa30da2979fb5 |title=The great ATAR hoax |date=28 January 2016 |work=[[The Australian]] |author=. |access-date=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Elsevier]] journal ''[[Vaccine (journal)|Vaccine]]'' three months later, UoW's executive dean of the Faculty of Science, Medicine and Health, researcher and toxicologist Alison Jones,&lt;ref name=uow-jones&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://smah.uow.edu.au/about/contacts/UOW103582.html |title=Alison Jones |work=U.O.W. website |access-date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-authored a paper in-part referring to Wilyman, and in discussing the balance of good public health versus unchecked academic freedom stated: 
:"there is the very real potential for feral academic liberty and free speech to do harm ... this is particularly pertinent in the field of child health, where two recent controversial "scholarly" vaccine contributions ... could undermine community confidence in immunisation and immunisation uptake ... by suggesting scientific doubt where doubt is not warranted on the basis of the evidence available... [Wilyman has] repeated the discredited claims of a link between vaccines and autism, without providing compelling scientific evidence to support her claim".&lt;ref&gt;Durrheim, D.N. &amp; Jones, A.L. (2016) "Public health and the necessary limits of academic freedom?", ''Vaccine'', 34:22, pp 2467-2468, ISSN 0264-410X.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin responded to Durrheim and Jones, arguing that they had misrepresented parts of Wilyman's work.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Brian. (2016) "[https://social-epistemology.com/2016/06/26/public-health-and-academic-freedom-brian-martin/ Public Health and Academic Freedom]".

McIntyre, a senior doctor at the Westmead Children's Hospital, said that Wollongong University "must bear the major responsibility for manifestly inadequate supervision", saying: "It is clear from even cursory examination that Wilyman’s thesis, although raising some legitimate questions about gaps in both the process and transparency of immunisation policy development, is based on a highly selective and poorly informed review of the literature, driven by the imperative to support pre-determined conclusions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/anti-vaccination-activist-turns-expert-witness-in-family-court-immunisation-brawl-20180922-p505dk.html |title=Anti-vaccination activist turns expert witness in family court immunisation brawl |last=Loussikian |first=Kylar |date=2018-09-22 |access-date=2018-09-22 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After graduation==
Within two months of University of Wollongong publishing the thesis it was reported that Wilyman was claiming her "PhD provides evidence that all vaccines are not safe and effective and that the combined schedule of vaccines is doing more harm than good in the population through the increase in chronic illness".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/high-wired/two-weeks-two-campuses-down/news-story/855cf6adb12a2584b9ae05a3ada8467a |title=Two weeks, two campuses down |date=14 March 2016 |work=[[The Australian]] |author=. |access-date=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016 ''The Australian'' reported that Wilyman was an audience member at a vaccination forum run by the [[Telethon Institute for Child Health Research|Telethon Kids Research Institute]] in Perth. Anti-vaccination activists at the event accused the forum members of lying, and heckled, interjected and continuously interrupted the speakers, forcing  the event to close early.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/high-wired/high-wired-pwc-takes-stake-in-chinafavoured-higher-ed-outfit/news-story/d390700c24a223e640ff19a9f80f3591|title=High Wired: PwC takes stake in China-favoured higher ed outfit|last=.|first=|date=6 June 2016|work=The Australian|access-date=6 June 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/31734325/anti-vaccination-activists-crash-perth-immunisation-seminar/|title=Anti-vaccination activists crash immunisation seminar|last=O'Leary|first=Cathy|date=1 June 2016|work=The West Australian|access-date=6 June 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilyman wrote an open letter to [[Paul Wellings]], the Vice Chancellor of the University of Wollongong asking the university to correct alleged inaccuracies in the Wikipedia article about her research, asserting that criticism of her thesis in the media and by individual scientists was not "a proper scientific debate (but) suppression of the literature using political strategies".&lt;ref name="Loussikian2016"&gt;Loussikian, Kylar. (27 July 2016).

Retrieved 27 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She also criticised Wollongong academic, Alison Jones, for using the university's website to publicise "personal opinions of vaccination". The university responded by saying that they do not endorse or otherwise the views of students or academic staff, and do not curate Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="Loussikian2016" /&gt;

Wilyman, Martin and the Faculty were awarded the satirical [[Australian Skeptics]] 2016 [[Bent Spoon Award]] for “a PhD thesis riddled with errors, misstatements, poor and unsupported ‘evidence’ and conspiratorial thinking”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Skeptics awards – Spoon to Wilyman, Skeptic of the Year to Harvey and Vickers|url=http://www.skeptics.com.au/2016/11/28/2016-skeptics-awards-spoon-to-wilyman-skeptic-of-the-year-to-harvey-and-vickers/|website=www.skeptics.com.au|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skeptics name winners of Bent Spoon award|url=http://www.pharmacynews.com.au/News/Skeptics-name-winners-of-Bent-Spoon-award|website=pharmacynews.com.au|accessdate=28 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129082741/http://www.pharmacynews.com.au/News/Skeptics-name-winners-of-Bent-Spoon-award|archivedate=29 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kneller Hall.JPG|right|thumb|Kneller Hall, autumn 2009]]
'''Kneller Hall''' is a mansion in [[Whitton, London|Whitton]], in the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]]. It houses the [[Royal Military School of Music]], training musicians for the [[British Army]], which acquired the building in the mid-19th century. It is also home to the school's Museum of Army Music. The Army is scheduled to vacate the site in 2020.

==History and architecture==
The first house on the site was built by Edmund Cooke between 1635 and 1646 and in 1664 was the fourth largest house in [[Twickenham]].&lt;ref name=twickenham&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twickenham-museum.org.uk/detail.asp?ContentID=126 |title=Kneller Hall: Whitton|publisher= [[Twickenham Museum]]|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1709 the property was purchased by Sir [[Godfrey Kneller]], court painter to British monarchs from [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] to [[George I of the United Kingdom|George I]]. He had the original house demolished and replaced by a new building, reputedly designed by Sir [[Christopher Wren]]. This second house was known as '''Whitton Hall''', after the village, but was renamed by Kneller's widow, in memory of her husband. In 1757, the house was sold to Sir Samuel Prime, a prominent London lawyer, who, with his son of the same name, extended it significantly and landscaped the grounds. After Samuel Prime junior died in 1813, the hall was sold to [[Charles Calvert (MP)|Charles Calvert]], [[British Whig Party|Whig]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Southwark (UK Parliament constituency)|Southwark]] from 1812–1832. He further expanded the house (to designs by [[Philip Hardwick]]), adding [[drawing room]]s at the east and west ends of the building. Calvert died of cholera in 1832 and his widow inhabited until death about 1845. The house was then acquired by the government as a [[teacher training college]] but it needed substantial reconstruction.&lt;ref name=twickenham/&gt;

Around 1850 much of the Wren bulk of the house was dilapidated and so was demolished. The Hardwick additions formed the wings of the new house, the one still standing today, designed by [[George Mair]]. This third building on the site is stone-corniced, casemented and constructed as to its ground floor central range and otherwise built of red bricks, all in the neo-[[Jacobethan architecture|Jacobethan style]] suitable to 19th and 20th century mansions of its scale. It consists of 17 bays, the central of which is the widest and of stained glass and the two adjacent of which are arrow-slit windows. The bays are split into five recessed or projecting ranges. Two square, pavilion towers form the near left and right bays, each tower crowned by a stone and leaded [[ogee]]-shaped [[cupola]]. Its gatepiers and house are separately listed by [[Historic England]] in the initial, [[listed building|grade II category]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1065380|desc=Kneller Hall and Boundary Walls, Royal College of Music|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
From 1850 to 1856 Kneller Hall served as a teacher training college under principal [[Frederick Temple]] and vice-principal [[Francis Turner Palgrave]], known for his poetry anthology ''[[Palgrave's Golden Treasury]]''.  In exchange for a two-year college education almost entirely subsidised by the state – one of the first forms of state-sponsored [[social mobility]] – graduates of the college were supposed to teach pauper and delinquent boys in specially built district schools.  Though Kneller Hall itself was generously funded by the state, the larger scheme to build district schools never came to fruition owing to political and religious conflict. The college closed when it was unable to attract any more students, who were now expected to teach in miserable conditions in Britain's [[workhouses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christopher Bischof, "Masculinity, Social Mobility, and the Plan to End Pauperism in Mid-Victorian England: Kneller Hall Teacher's Training College," Journal of Social History, 46, 4 (2013), 1039–1059 |url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/jsh/sht003|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

On 3 March 1857 the building was taken over by the [[War Office]] as the base for a school for army bandsmen; it then evolved into the [[Royal Military School of Music]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twickenham-museum.org.uk/detail.asp?ContentID=126 Twickenham Museum: Kneller Hall]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[World War II|Second World War]] the site was briefly the headquarters of the [[Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces]] from late 1939 until the headquarters moved out to [[St Paul's School, London|St Paul's School]] in July 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newbold|first1=David John|title=British planning and preparations to resist invasion on land, September 1939 - September 1940|url=https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/2928115/DX199711.pd|publisher=King's College, University of London|page=245|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 January 2016 defence minister [[Mark Lancaster]] announced that Kneller Hall is one of 12 MOD sites proposed to be "released" (meaning sold) as part of the department’s drive for greater efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-minister-mark-lancaster-announces-release-of-mod-sites-for-development|title=Defence Minister Mark Lancaster announces release of MOD sites for development|publisher=MoD|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016 the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] announced that the site would close in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/565858/20161107_MOD_Better_Defence_Estate_FINAL.pdf|title=A Better Defence Estate|publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]|date=November 2016 |accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28070">'''Learning analytics''' is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which it occurs.&lt;ref name="LAK11 Call"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://tekri.athabascau.ca/analytics | title=Call for Papers of the 1st International Conference on Learning Analytics &amp; Knowledge (LAK 2011) | accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related field is [[educational data mining]].

==Definition==
The definition and aims of learning analytics are contested. One earlier definition discussed by the community suggested that
"Learning analytics is the use of intelligent data, learner-produced data, and analysis models to discover information and social connections for predicting and advising people's learning."&lt;ref name="Siemens LA Def"&gt;Siemens, George. "What Are Learning Analytics?" Elearnspace, August 25, 2010. http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2010/08/25/what-are-learning-analytics/&lt;/ref&gt; But this definition has been criticised by [[George Siemens]]&lt;ref&gt;"I somewhat disagree with this definition—it serves well as an introductory concept if we use analytics as a support structure for existing education models. I think learning analytics—at an advanced and integrated implementation—can do away with pre-fab curriculum models." [http://groups.google.com.au/group/learninganalytics/msg/1b2ee789be37beb1 George Siemens in the Learning Analytics Google Group discussion, August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2017}} and Mike Sharkey.&lt;ref&gt;"In the descriptions of learning analytics we talk about using data to "predict success". I've struggled with that as I pore over our databases. I've come to realize there are different views/levels of success." [http://groups.google.com.au/group/learninganalytics/msg/3688c9b335e47240 Mike Sharkey, Director of Academic Analytics, University of Phoenix, in the Learning Analytics Google Group discussion, August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2017}}

A more holistic view than a mere definition is provided by the framework of learning analytics by Greller and Drachsler (2012).&lt;ref name="Greller and Drachsler"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ifets.info/journals/15_3/4.pdf |format=pdf |title=Translating Learning into Numbers: Toward a Generic Framework for Learning Analytics. |last=Greller |first=Wolfgang |last2=Drachsler |first2=Hendrik |journal=Educational Technology and Society |date=2012 |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=42–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a general morphological analysis (GMA) to divide the domain into six "critical dimensions".

A systematic overview on learning analytics and its key concepts is provided by Chatti et al. (2012)&lt;ref name="A Refence Model for Learning Analytics"&gt;Mohamed Amine Chatti, Anna Lea Dyckhoff, Ulrik Schroeder and Hendrik Thüs (2012). A reference model for learning analytics. International Journal of Technology Enhanced Learning (IJTEL), 4(5/6), pp. 318-331.&lt;/ref&gt; and Chatti et al. (2014)&lt;ref name="LA Challenges and Directions"&gt;Chatti, M. A., Lukarov, V., Thüs, H., Muslim, A., Yousef, A. M. F., Wahid, U., Greven, C., Chakrabarti, A., Schroeder, U. (2014). Learning Analytics: Challenges and Future Research Directions. eleed, Iss. 10. http://eleed.campussource.de/archive/10/4035&lt;/ref&gt; through a reference model for learning analytics based on four dimensions, namely data, environments, context (what?), stakeholders (who?), objectives (why?), and methods (how?).

It has been pointed out{{By whom|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Picciano|first=Anthony G.|date=2012|title=The Evolution of Big Data and Learning Analytics in American Higher Education.|url=https://search-proquest-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/eric/docview/1238188091/AC784AD901ED497EPQ/10?accountid=14496|journal=Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks|volume=16|pages=9-20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there is a broad awareness of analytics across educational institutions for various stakeholders, but that the way learning analytics is defined and implemented may vary, including:
# for individual learners to reflect on their achievements and patterns of behaviour in relation to others; 
# as predictors of students requiring extra support and attention; 
# to help teachers and support staff plan supporting interventions with individuals and groups;
# for functional groups such as course teams seeking to improve current courses or develop new curriculum offerings; and
# for institutional administrators taking decisions on matters such as marketing and recruitment or efficiency and effectiveness measures.&lt;ref name="Institutional Readiness"&gt;Powell, Stephen, and Sheila MacNeill. Institutional Readiness for Analytics A Briefing Paper. CETIS Analytics Series. JISC CETIS, December 2012. {{cite web |url=http://publications.cetis.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Institutional-Readiness-for-Analytics-Vol1-No8.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502234323/http://publications.cetis.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Institutional-Readiness-for-Analytics-Vol1-No8.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In that briefing paper, Powell and MacNeill go on to point out that some motivations and implementations of analytics may come into conflict with others, for example highlighting potential conflict between analytics for individual learners and organisational stakeholders.&lt;ref name="Institutional Readiness" /&gt;

[[Dragan Gasevic | Gašević]], Dawson, and [[George Siemens | Siemens]] argue that computational aspects of learning analytics need to be linked with the existing educational research if the field of learning analytics is to deliver to its promise to understand and optimize learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gašević | first1 = D. | last2 = Dawson | first2 = S. | last3 = Siemens | first3 = G. | year = 2015 | title = Let's not forget: Learning analytics are about learning | url = https://www.sfu.ca/~dgasevic/papers_shared/techtrends2015.pdf| journal = TechTrends | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 64–71 | doi = 10.1007/s11528-014-0822-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differentiating learning analytics and educational data mining==
Differentiating the fields of [[educational data mining]] (EDM) and learning analytics (LA) has been a concern of several researchers. [[George Siemens]] takes the position that educational data mining encompasses both learning analytics and [[academic analytics]],&lt;ref name="open_learning_analytics"&gt;G. Siemens, D. Gasevic, C. Haythornthwaite, S. Dawson, S. B. Shum, R. Ferguson, E. Duval, K. Verbert, and R. S. J. D. Baker. Open Learning Analytics: an integrated &amp; modularized platform. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the former of which is aimed at governments, funding agencies, and administrators instead of learners and faculty. Baepler and Murdoch define [[academic analytics]] as an area that "...combines select institutional data, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling to create intelligence upon which learners, instructors, or administrators can change academic behavior".&lt;ref name="academic_analytics"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baepler | first1 = P. | last2 = Murdoch | first2 = C. J. | title = Academic Analytics and Data Mining in Higher Education | url = | journal = International Journal for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning | volume = 4 | issue = 2| year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They go on to attempt to disambiguate educational data mining from academic analytics based on whether the process is hypothesis driven or not, though Brooks&lt;ref name="a_data-assisted"&gt;C. Brooks. A Data-Assisted Approach to Supporting Instructional Interventions in Technology Enhanced Learning Environments. PhD Dissertation. University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; questions whether this distinction exists in the literature. Brooks&lt;ref name="a_data-assisted"/&gt; instead proposes that a better distinction between the EDM and LA communities is in the roots of where each community originated, with authorship at the EDM community being dominated by researchers coming from intelligent tutoring paradigms, and learning anaytics researchers being more focused on enterprise learning systems (e.g. learning content management systems).

Regardless of the differences between the LA and EDM communities, the two areas have significant overlap both in the objectives of investigators as well as in the methods and techniques that are used in the investigation. In the [[Master of Science|MS]] program offering in learning analytics at [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teachers]] [[Teachers College, Columbia University|College]], Columbia University, students are taught both EDM and LA methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Learning Analytics {{!}} Teachers College Columbia University|url = http://www.tc.columbia.edu/human-development/learning-analytics/|website = www.tc.columbia.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===The context of learning analytics===
In "The State of Learning Analytics in 2012: A Review and Future Challenges" Rebecca Ferguson&lt;ref name="Ferguson"&gt;Ferguson, Rebecca. ''The State of Learning Analytics in 2012: A Review and Future Challenges''. Technical Report. Knowledge Media Institute: The Open University, UK, 2012. http://kmi.open.ac.uk/publications/pdf/kmi-12-01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; tracks the progress of analytics for learning as a development through:{{efn|This section is adapted from the EdFutures.net wiki ([[CC-By-SA]])}}
# The increasing interest in [[big data]] for [[business intelligence]]
# The rise of [[online education]] focussed around [[virtual learning environment]]s (VLEs), [[content management system]]s (CMSs), and [[management information systems]] (MIS) for education, which saw an increase in digital data regarding student background (often held in the MIS) and learning log data (from VLEs). This development afforded the opportunity to apply [[business intelligence]] techniques to educational data
# Questions regarding the optimisation of systems to support learning particularly given the question regarding how we can know whether a student is engaged/understanding if we can't see them?
# Increasing focus on evidencing progress and professional standards for accountability systems
# This focus led to a teacher stake in the analytics—given that they are associated with accountability systems
# Thus an increasing emphasis was placed on the pedagogic affordances of learning analytics
# This pressure is increased by the economic desire to improve engagement in [[online education]] for the deliverance of high-quality affordable education

===History of techniques and methods of learning analytics===
In a discussion of the history of analytics, Cooper&lt;ref name="Brief History Analytics"&gt;Cooper, Adam. A Brief History of Analytics A Briefing Paper. CETIS Analytics Series. JISC CETIS, November 2012. http://publications.cetis.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Analytics-Brief-History-Vol-1-No9.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; highlights a number of communities from which learning analytics draws techniques, including:
# [[Statistics]], which are a well established means to address hypothesis testing.
# [[Business intelligence]], which has similarities with learning analytics, although it has historically been targeted at making the production of reports more efficient through enabling data access and summarising performance indicators.
# [[Web analytics]], tools such as [[Google analytics]] report on web page visits and references to websites, brands and other keyterms across the internet. The more "fine grain" of these techniques can be adopted in learning analytics for the exploration of student trajectories through learning resources (courses, materials, etc.). 
# [[Operational research]], which aims at highlighting design optimisation for maximising objectives through the use of mathematical models and statistical methods. Such techniques are implicated in learning analytics which seek to create models of real world behaviour for practical application.
# [[Artificial intelligence]] and [[Data mining]], machine learning techniques built on data mining and AI methods are capable of detecting patterns in data. In learning analytics such techniques can be used for [[intelligent tutoring system]]s, classification of students in more dynamic ways than simple demographic factors, and resources such as "suggested course" systems modelled on [[collaborative filtering]] techniques.
# [[Social network analysis]] (SNA), which analyses relationships between people by exploring implicit (e.g. interactions on forums) and explicit (e.g. "friends" or "followers") ties online and offline. SNA developed from the work of sociologists like Wellman and Watts, and mathematicians like Barabasi and Strogatz. The work of these individuals has provided us with a good sense of the patterns that networks exhibit (small world, power laws), the attributes of connections (in early 70's, Granovetter explored connections from a perspective of tie strength and impact on new information), and the social dimensions of networks (for example, geography still matters in a digital networked world). It is particularly used to explore clusters of networks, influence networks, engagement and disengagement, and has been deployed for these purposes in learning analytic contexts. 
# [[Information visualization]], which is an important step in many analytics for [[sensemaking]] around the data provided, and is used across most techniques (including those above).&lt;ref name="Brief History Analytics" /&gt;

=== History of learning analytics in higher education ===
The first graduate program focused specifically on learning analytics was created by [[Ryan S. Baker]] and launched in the Fall 2015 semester at Teachers College, Columbia University. The program description states that
{{Quote|data about learning and learners are being generated today on an unprecedented scale. The fields of learning analytics (LA) and educational data mining (EDM) have emerged with the aim of transforming this data into new insights that can benefit students, teachers, and administrators. As one of world's leading teaching and research institutions in education, psychology, and health, we are proud to offer an innovative graduate curriculum dedicated to improving education through technology and data analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Learning Analytics|url = http://www.tc.columbia.edu/human-development/learning-analytics/|website = www.tc.columbia.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Analytic methods==
Methods for learning analytics include:
* Content analysis, particularly of resources which students create (such as essays).
* Discourse analytics, which aims to capture meaningful data on student interactions which (unlike social network analytics) aims to explore the properties of the language used, as opposed to just the network of interactions, or forum-post counts, etc.
* Social learning analytics, which is aimed at exploring the role of social interaction in learning, the importance of learning networks, discourse used to sensemake, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Buckingham Shum, S. and Ferguson, R., Social Learning Analytics. Educational Technology &amp; Society (Special Issue on Learning &amp; Knowledge Analytics, Eds. G. Siemens &amp; D. Gašević), 15, 3, (2012), 3-26. http://www.ifets.info Open Access Eprint: http://oro.open.ac.uk/34092&lt;/ref&gt;
* Disposition analytics, which seeks to capture data regarding student's dispositions to their own learning, and the relationship of these to their learning.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, M., Learning Analytics: Moving from Concept to Practice. EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative Briefing, 2012. http://www.educause.edu/library/resources/learning-analytics-moving-concept-practice&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buckingam Shum Crick Dispositions"&gt;Buckingham Shum, S. and Deakin Crick, R., Learning Dispositions and Transferable Competencies: Pedagogy, Modelling and Learning Analytics. In: Proc. 2nd International Conference on Learning Analytics &amp; Knowledge (Vancouver, 29 Apr-2 May 2012). ACM: New York. pp.92-101. {{DOI|10.1145/2330601.2330629}} Eprint: http://oro.open.ac.uk/32823&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "curious" learners may be more inclined to ask questions, and this data can be captured and analysed for learning analytics.

==Analytic outcomes==
Analytics have been used for:
* [[Prediction]] purposes, for example to identify "at risk" students in terms of drop out or course failure
* [[Personalization]] &amp; [[Adaptation (computer science)|adaptation]], to provide students with tailored learning pathways, or assessment materials
* Intervention purposes, providing educators with information to intervene to support students
* [[Information visualization]], typically in the form of so-called learning dashboards which provide overview learning data through data visualisation tools

==Software==
{{See also|Social network analysis software|Student information system}}
Much of the software that is currently used for learning analytics duplicates functionality of web analytics software, but applies it to learner interactions with content. Social network analysis tools are commonly used to map social connections and discussions. Some examples of learning analytics software tools include:

==Ethics and privacy==
The ethics of data collection, analytics, reporting and accountability has been raised as a potential concern for learning analytics,&lt;ref name="Greller and Drachsler" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slade, Sharon and Prinsloo, Paul "Learning analytics: ethical issues and dilemmas" in American Behavioral Scientist (2013), 57(10), pp. 1509-1528. http://oro.open.ac.uk/36594&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siemens, G. "Learning Analytics: Envisioning a Research Discipline and a Domain of Practice." In Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge, 4–8, 2012. http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2330605.&lt;/ref&gt; with concerns raised regarding:
* Data ownership&lt;ref&gt;Kristy Kitto, Towards a Manifesto for Data Ownership http://www.laceproject.eu/blog/towards-a-manifesto-for-data-ownership/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Communications around the scope and role of learning analytics
* The necessary role of human feedback and error-correction in learning analytics systems 
* Data sharing between systems, organisations, and stakeholders
* Trust in data clients

As Kay, Kom and Oppenheim point out, the range of data is wide, potentially derived from:&lt;ref name="Legal Risk Ethical"&gt;Kay, David, Naomi Kom, and Charles Oppenheim. Legal, Risk and Ethical Aspects of Analytics in Higher Education. Analytics Series. Accessed January 3, 2013. {{cite web |url=http://publications.cetis.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Legal-Risk-and-Ethical-Aspects-of-Analytics-in-Higher-Education-Vol1-No6.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502234313/http://publications.cetis.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Legal-Risk-and-Ethical-Aspects-of-Analytics-in-Higher-Education-Vol1-No6.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Recorded activity: student records, attendance, assignments, researcher information (CRIS)
* Systems interactions: VLE, library / repository search, card transactions
* Feedback mechanisms: surveys, customer care
* External systems that offer reliable identification such as sector and shared services and social networks

Thus the legal and ethical situation is challenging and different from country to country, raising implications for:&lt;ref name="Legal Risk Ethical" /&gt;
* Variety of data: principles for collection, retention and exploitation
* Education mission: underlying issues of learning management, including social and performance engineering
* Motivation for development of analytics: mutuality, a combination of corporate, individual and general good

In some prominent cases like the inBloom disaster,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-05-01/inbloom-shuts-down-amid-privacy-fears-over-student-data-tracking&lt;/ref&gt; even full functional systems have been shut down due to lack of trust in the data collection by governments, stakeholders and civil rights groups. Since then, the learning analytics community has extensively studied legal conditions in a series of experts workshops on "Ethics &amp; Privacy 4 Learning Analytics" that constitute the use of trusted learning analytics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laceproject.eu/ethics-privacy-learning-analytics/&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2017}} Drachsler &amp; Greller released a 8-point checklist named DELICATE that is based on the intensive studies in this area to demystify the ethics and privacy discussions around learning analytics.&lt;ref&gt;Drachsler, H. &amp; Greller, W. (2016). Privacy and Analytics – it's a DELICATE issue. A Checklist to establish trusted Learning Analytics. 6th Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference 2016, April 25–29, 2016, Edinburgh, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;
# D-etermination: Decide on the purpose of learning analytics for your institution.
# E-xplain: Define the scope of data collection and usage.
# L-egitimate: Explain how you operate within the legal frameworks, refer to the essential legislation.
# I-nvolve: Talk to stakeholders and give assurances about the data distribution and use.
# C-onsent: Seek consent through clear consent questions.
# A-nonymise: De-identify individuals as much as possible
# T-echnical aspects: Monitor who has access to data, especially in areas with high staff turn-over.
# E-xternal partners: Make sure externals provide highest data security standards

It shows ways to design and provide privacy conform learning analytics that can benefit all stakeholders. The full DELICATE checklist is publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;http://de.slideshare.net/Drachsler/delicate-checklist-to-establish-trusted-learning-analytics&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ludmilla Chiriaeff''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CC|GOQ}} (January 10, 1924 &amp;ndash; September 22, 1996) was a Soviet-born Canadian [[ballet]] dancer, choreographer, teacher, and company director.

==Biography==
Ludmilla Alexandrovna Otsup was born in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]], to a Russian father Alexandr Otsup (1882-1948), writer known under the pen name Sergej Gorny, and his wife Ekaterina Otsup (née Abramova; 1886-1962) of Polish descent.&lt;ref&gt;К. И. Финкельштейн, "О Сергее Горном", ''Powrócić do Rosji wierszami i prozą. Literatura rosyjskiej emigracji'' (Slupsk: Akademia Pomorska w Slupsku, 2012), s.170-185.&lt;/ref&gt; 

She considered herself Russian by birth, as her parents were in Latvia only as refugees from conflict in Russia. She was raised and trained in [[Berlin]], where she studied with Alexandra Nikolaeva, a former ballerina of the [[Bolshoi Ballet]], with Nikolaeva's daughter and son-in-law [[Xenia Krüger]] and [[Edouard Borovansky]], and, later, with Eugenie Eduardowa. 

Her career was interrupted by the conflict of World War II, during which she was confined to a Nazi labor camp on the unfounded suspicion of being Jewish. She escaped during a bombing raid and, with the assistance of the Red Cross, made her way to Switzerland, where she was able to resume her ballet training and revive her professional career in Lausanne and Geneva. 

While resident in the ''Suisse romande'', she married Russian artist Alexis Shiriaev, whose surname was spelled Chiriaeff, in the French style.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Conyers, "Chiriaeff, Ludmilla," ''International Encyclopedia of Dance'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), vol. 2, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

After immigrating with her family to Canada in 1952, Chiriaeff settled in [[Montréal]], [[Québec]], opened a ballet school, and soon began to create dances for Société Radio-Canada, the French-language public television service. Because of the success of her television appearances, she founded Les Ballets Chiriaeff, a small troupe that grew in size and popularity and eventually evolved into [[Les Grands Ballets Canadiens]], in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Max Wyman, ''Dance Canada: An Illustrated History'' (Vancouver: Douglas &amp; McIntyre, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under her guidance, shared jointly with choreographer [[Fernand Nault]], this company achieved international prominence in 1966–67, during Canada's Expo 67 World Festival and subsequent tours of the United States and western Europe. Chiriaeff retired as co-artistic director of the company in 1974 and devoted herself to leadership of the company's associated schools.&lt;ref&gt;Conyers, "Chiriaeff, Ludmilla" (1998), vol. 2, pp. 150–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Choreographies==
Chiriaeff created more than three hundred ballets for television and stage. In 1952, she choreographed ''Cendrillon'' (''Cinderella''), a three-act ballet set to music by Mozart, for the nascent French-language television service of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The success of this work led to her being offered a half-hour slot every month to create ballets for ''L'Heure du Concert'' (''The Concert Hour'') and other programs of music and dance broadcast bilingually across Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Linde Howe-Beck, "[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/ludmilla-chiriaeff/ Ludmilla Chiriaeff]," in ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'' www.thecandadianencyclopedia.ca Retrieved 24 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Among her subsequent works for television were ''Jeu de Cartes'' (''Card Game,'' 1954), set to music by Igor Stravinsky, ''Une Nuit sur le Mont Chauve'' (''Night on Bald Mountain''), to music by Modest Mussorgsky, and ''Carnaval des Animaux'' (''Carnival of Animals,'' 1957), to music by Camille Saint-Saëns.&lt;ref&gt;Repertoire records of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in archives of Bibliothèque de la Danse Vincent-Warren. Montréal. http://www.bibliodanse.ca. Retrieved 24 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the formation of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in 1957, Chiriaeff created many works for her young company, including ''Mémoires de Camille'' (1961), to music by Giuseppe Verdi, ''Quatrième Concert Royal'' (1961), to music by François Couperin, and ''Fète Hongroise,'' to music by Johannes Brahms. She also restaged some of her earlier works, including ''Cendrillon'' (1962) and ''Suite Canadienne'' (1961), set to French-Canadian folk tunes arranged by [[Michel Perrault]]. Created for a gala television performance during Queen Elizabeth II's 1955 tour of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Repertoire records of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in archives of Bibliothèque de la Danse Vincent-Warren, Montréal;. http://www.bibliodanse.ca. Retrieved 24 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Suite Canadienne'' was one of Chiriaeff's several ballets celebrating Québécois culture. It became, for a time, a sort of signature work for Les Grands Ballets Canadiens and proved to be one of her most popular creations.

==Educational vision and mission==
In response to her contractual commitment to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Chiriaeff founded Les Ballets Chiriaeff and an associated school in 1952. When the company was renamed Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in 1957, the school expanded, offering instruction to both amateurs and aspiring professionals. In 1966, at the request of the Ministère des Affaires Culturelles du Québec, Madame Chiriaeff established the first fully professional ballet school in the province, the Académie des Grands Ballets Canadiens, which in 1976 became the École Supérieure de Danse des Grands Ballets Canadiens. In 1980, the school obtained an independent charter and became the École Supérieure de Danse du Québec. It continued to operate under that name until 2010, when it was designated the École Supérieure de Ballet du Québec. It is the only institution in North America to provide a professional ballet program taught entirely in French.&lt;ref&gt;"Overview: École Supérieure de Ballet du Québec," http://www.esbq/ca/en/school{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Retrieved 25 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Training dancers and dance instructors was central to Chiriaeff's vision. In addition to founding her own schools, she introduced intensive ballet programs into all levels of the provincial educational system, including Montréal's Pierre Laporte Secondary School (1975), the CÉGEP du Vieux Montréal (College of General and Vocational Education in Old Montreal, 1979), and the École Laurier for elementary school children (1998).&lt;ref&gt;Beck, "Ludmilla Chiriaeff," www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of her educational vision and mission, she has been acknowledged as "''la mère de la danse au Québec''" ("the mother of dance in Quebec").&lt;ref&gt;"Ludmilla Chiriaeff," archives of Radio-Canada,  [http://archives.radio-canada.ca/sports/danse/clips/6236/]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Retrieved 25 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
In 1969 Chiriaeff was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] and was promoted to Companion in 1984. In 1978 she was proclaimed a Grande Montréalaise by the City of Montreal, and in 1985 she was made a Grand Officier de l'[[Ordre National du Québec]]. In 1993, she received Canada's highest honour in the performing arts, the [[Governor General's Performing Arts Award]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ludmilla Chiriaeff - biography|url=http://ggpaa.ca/award-recipients/1993/chiriaeff-ludmilla-(1924-1996).aspx|publisher=Governor General's Performing Arts Awards Foundation|accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Denise Pelletier Award for the Performing Arts, and honorary doctorates from McGill University, the Université de Montréal, and the Université du Québec.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Anderson, "[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/25/arts/ludmilla-chiriaeff-72-founder-of-ballet-company-in-montreal.html Ludmilla Chiriaeff, 72, Founder of Ballet Company in Montreal]," obituary, ''New York Times'', 25 September 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luke Morgan''' is a fictional character from the British [[Channel 4]] soap opera ''[[Hollyoaks]]'', played by [[Gary Lucy]]. He was introduced by the show's creator [[Phil Redmond]] as part of the Morgan family, and made his first on-screen appearance on 7 June 1999. The character was involved in a [[male rape]] storyline, which was branded "groundbreaking" and met with controversy. Lucy opted to leave the role in 2001 after two years, although he returned for two episodes in August 2002. The character's reintroduction was announced on 21 May 2017 and he returned on 24 July. Lucy took a break from the series on 26 September 2018 to appear in a play.

=== Male rape ===
Luke was bullied by Mark Gibbs and his friends for a while due to a football team rivalry. When Luke finally stood up to him Mark was incensed and he and his friends beat Luke up badly. When Luke tried to fight back Mark lost control and raped Luke to belittle and devastate him. ''Hollyoaks'' creator [[Phil Redmond]] defended criticism and said the storyline "aimed to tackle one of the last great social taboos responsibly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hollyoaks goes for one-off X-rated episode.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Hollyoaks+goes+for+one-off+X-rated+episode.-a060502610|accessdate=4 September 2011|newspaper=[[Birmingham Post]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=1 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lead up to the attack producers worked closely with rape-related support groups to help make the storyline as realistic as possible.&lt;ref name=taboo&gt;{{cite news|last=Miles|first=Lucy|title=Can TV scene break taboo of male rape?|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Can+TV+scene+break+taboo+of+male+rape%3f-a061876020|accessdate=4 September 2011|newspaper=[[Sunday Mercury]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=12 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the storyline Lucy said "When they first told me about the storyline I was dubious as to whether or not I should take it. Firstly because I was so young and secondly it hadn't been touched before so no-one knew how the public and press would take it. After thinking about it and doing research behind it I thought it was definitely a subject worth approaching. So we did it and reaped the rewards. I feel very lucky."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Just Luke what I'm doing now!; Ex-Hollyoaks star who's scoring with the wives.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Just+Luke+what+I'm+doing+now!%3b+Ex-Hollyoaks+star+who's+scoring+with...-a081392278|accessdate=4 September 2011|newspaper=[[Liverpool Echo]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=7 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; On why she wanted to tackle the subject series producer Jo Hallows said "The message is about banishing taboos - telling people it's OK to talk and there are people who can help.

Luke arrives with his family: parents [[Andy Morgan (Hollyoaks)|Andy Morgan]] ([[Ross Davidson]]) and [[Sue Morgan (Hollyoaks)|Sue Morgan]] ([[Eve White]]); brother [[Adam Morgan (Hollyoaks)|Adam Morgan]] (David Brown); and sisters [[Beth Morgan (Hollyoaks)|Beth Morgan]] (Elizabeth O'Grady, [[Kate Baines]]) and [[Zara Morgan]] ([[Kelly Greenwood]]). He begins a friendship with [[Darren Osborne]] ([[Ashley Taylor Dawson]]) and a relationship with [[Mandy Richardson]] ([[Sarah Jayne Dunn]]). During a game of football, Luke tackles [[Mark Gibbs]] (Colin Parry) which ends Mark's chances of becoming a professional footballer and leads to Mark resenting Luke and bullying him. When Luke stands up to Mark, he becomes annoyed and beats him up, before [[Male rape|raping]] him. Luke remains silent about the rape, afraid of the consequences and his relationship with Mandy deteriorates as a result. They separate and she begins a relationship with Darren, aware it will upset Luke. When he tries to tell Mandy about the rape, she ignores him and tries to punish him for their separation.

[[File:LukeMorgan.jpg|150px|thumb|A promotional image of Luke as he appeared in his first stint.]]
Luke becomes depressed and [[Suicide attempt|attempts suicide]] so Adam encourages him to talk to someone and Luke tells his family that he was raped. Sue, Adam and Mandy are supportive, whereas Andy struggles to believe his son. Darren is spiteful towards Luke and believes Luke is gay and lying about the rape. Annoyed at Darren's behaviour, Mandy ends their relationship and supports Luke. Sue begins to struggle with the pressure of the rape and begins taking medication. After Mark intimidates him, Luke decides to inform the police he was raped and Mark, along with his two friends, are charged with assault and rape. Believing the family will be disowned by the community, Andy asks Luke to drop the charges and later, Mark harasses Luke and tells him that he won't be believed. At the trial, Mark and his friends are found guilty and Mark is sentenced to eight years imprisonment, whereas the friends are sentenced to three years imprisonment.

Luke and Andy's relationship becomes estranged and he sells the story of his rape to the press to humiliate Andy. Eventually, they reunite but Luke struggles with Andy and Sue's inability to discuss the rape so decides to move out. Luke later expresses an interest in reconciling with Mandy but she decides not to as he is still overcoming the rape and secretly dates [[Ben Davies (Hollyoaks)|Ben Davies]] ([[Marcus Patric]]), Luke's close friend. Luke discovers their affair and briefly disowns them. Hoping to move on, Luke begins a relationship with [[Laura Burns (Hollyoaks)|Laura Burns]] (Lesley Crawford), who is mentally unstable. He begins to believe Laura is using him and is pleased when they separate, although Laura begins to secretly obsess over Mandy.

At a party, [[Scott Anderson (Hollyoaks)|Scott Anderson]] ([[Daniel Hyde (actor)|Daniel Hyde]]) teases Luke over the rape and with his friends, he chases Luke and pretends to rape him. Luke is traumatised by the attack and breaks down with Adam, admitting that he will not be able to move past the rape. He later tells Adam that he plans on leaving the village to escape his past. Luke is offered a job in Canada as a school football coach, which he accepts. As he prepares to leave, Beth admits that Scott raped her at the party, devastating Luke as he blames himself. After deciding to stay in the village to support Beth, she insists he leave to rebuild his life, which he eventually decides to do. Luke leaves and after he settles in Canada, Beth informs their family of her rape. Luke later returns to the village for his parents' second wedding. Despite being in a relationship with Adam, Mandy has a fling with Luke after realising they have feelings for each other. Luke offers Mandy the chance to return to Canada with him, but she declines and he returns alone.

===2017−===
Fifteen years later, Darren spots Luke in a bar near Hollyoaks village and they have lunch together; when Darren disappears momentarily, Luke steals money from his wallet and absconds. Darren tracks Luke down and discovers he is unemployed so offers him a job at his taxi firm, ''Daz Cabs''. A drunk Luke later returns home to his partner, who is revealed to be Mandy; she warns him to stop drinking. When Darren discovers Luke drinking alcohol whilst working, he sacks him; they discuss Luke's situation and Luke denies being an alcoholic. Darren invites Luke to an AA meeting but he does not arrive as planned. Luke leaves Mandy's daughter, [[Ella Richardson]] (Erin Palmer), by herself when he goes to buy alcohol and the neighbours call social services. Tony and Mandy return  to the house and find social services waiting for them. They take Ella in to care and when Luke returns drunk again Mandy leaves him.

Five weeks later, Luke returns to the village to see Mandy and he is not drunk. He tries to win her around but she rejects him so he walks away. However he meets Tony's wife Diane for the first time and she reveals Tony kissed Mandy so Luke heads over to Tony's restaurant and has a fight with him. When Darren is released from prison and he discovers Luke is homeless and living out of his car. After Luke emotionally reveals to Darren that he has a drink problem, Darren moves him in with the Osbornes. After setting into life with the Osbornes, Luke gets a trial at Hollyoaks High as a PE teacher. However, on his first day he is haunted by flashbacks of his torment at the hands of Mark Gibbs years before. Just as Luke is about to drink for the first time in over a month, an explosion rips through the school, leaving Darren and Luke trapped. As Darren and Luke climb through an air vent, Luke reveals to Darren that he has a secret son and wife.

The following month, Mandy decides to give Luke a second chance and they go on a date in Chester. Luke flees after seeing his rapist, Mark. He then becomes obsessed with Mark, stalking him on social media and trying to arrange a meeting with him to buy his car using Nancy's picture. Luke is furious that Mark has a seemingly charmed life, with a wife and two children. He becomes a personal trainer and takes Mark's wife, [[Jenna Gibbs|Jenna]], (Laura Hopper) as a client. She tells Luke that Mark served eight years for a trumped up GBH charge. Fuming, Luke finds out where they live and trashes their house.

After seeing Luke at the police station with Nancy, Mark confronts him at the Osborne house. Mark continues to behave as cockily as he did 17 years ago and shows no remorse for what happened. Mark goes to meet Jenna but finds Luke has followed him. Mark's demeanour has changed, saying his prison sentence was hell because of what he had done. Luke breaks down and reveals the agony of his life because of the rape, and asks Mark just to acknowledge what he did and apologise. Mark begs Luke not to tell Jenna and that he is not to blame for what has gone wrong in his life. Just then, Jenna overhears and asks what he meant, and Luke reveals what Mark had done to him. Jenna believes him due to Mark's silence and storms off, disgusted. Mark tells Luke it was one night and should have been left in the past. Luke responds that it is all his fault.

Mandy and Luke reconcile after she can see how hard he's trying to redeem himself, and in the process Mandy proposes. Luke agrees, even though he is already married to [[Scarlett Morgan]] ([[Susie Amy]]). Luke seeks help from lawyer [[Sami Maalik]] (Rishi Nair) to get a divorce from Scarlett, but they are unable to track her down. Luke damages Mandy's dress in a bid to delay the wedding, but she find another dress. On the day of the wedding, Scarlett arrives in the village and confronts Luke, demanding that he give her money. He offers her £500 and a promise to find more money so Scarlett leaves. Luke and Mandy marry, but Luke's son, [[Oliver Morgan (Hollyoaks)|Oliver Morgan]] (Aedan Duckworth), crashes the wedding reception and reveals that Luke is his father and that he is still married to Scarlett. Luke bonds with Oliver over their shared interest in football. Later, Luke calls Mandy to apologise, unaware that she is sleeping with Darren. Luke's alcoholism continues to get worse, leading to the deterioration of his relationship with Mandy and to causing him to ignore Oliver's attempts to talk to him about the grooming he is experiencing at the hands of [[Buster Smith (Hollyoaks)|Buster Smith]] (Nathan Sussex). Luke also almost kills [[Simone Loveday]] ([[Jacqueline Boatswain]]) while drink driving and she encourages him to seek help after sharing her own experiences with alcohol however, he is later arrested after being caught drink driving again. The charges were dropped but he is arrested soon afterwards for assaulting [[Scott Drinkwell]] ([[Ross Adams]]) after [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) calls the police off-screen. The 2018 Winter Trailer shows Mandy visiting Luke in prison, but whether this return is permanent or just a one-time thing is unknown.

[[File:Alex Ferguson 02.jpg|thumb| [[Alex Ferguson]] winner of the most English [[Premier League Manager of the Year|Manager of the Year]] awards, all won during his tenure as manager of [[Manchester United]]. As of 2015 he is the UEFA Coaching Ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160620065616/http://www.uefa.org/football-development/technical/coach-education/news/newsid%3D2277456.html Europe's top coaches convene in Nyon]. [[UEFA]] website. 2 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[association football]], a '''manager''' is an occupation of '''[[head coach]]''' in the [[United Kingdom]] responsible for running a [[football club]] or a [[national team]]. Outside the [[British Isles]] and across most of Europe, a title of [[head coach]] or coach is predominant.

The manager of a [[sports club|professional club]] is responsible to the club chairman.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

== Responsibilities ==
The manager's responsibilities in a professional football club usually include (but are not limited to) the following:
* Selecting the team of players for matches, and their [[Formation (association football)|formation]].
* Planning the strategy, and instructing the players on the [[Association football pitch|pitch]].
* Motivating players before and during a match.
* Delegating duties to the first team coach and the [[coaching staff|coaching and medical staff]].
* Scouting for young but talented players for eventual [[Training ground (association football)|training]] in the [[Youth system|youth academy]] or the [[reserve team|reserves]], and encouraging their development and improvement.
* Buying and selling players in the [[Transfer (football)|transfer market]], including [[Loan (association football)|loans]].
* Facing the media in pre-match and post-match interviews.

Some of the above responsibilities are shared with the [[director of football]] or [[sporting director]], and are at times delegated to an assistant manager or club coach.

Additionally, depending on the club, some minor{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} responsibilities include:
* Marketing the club, most especially for ticket admission, sponsorship and merchandising.
* Growing turnover and keeping the club profitable.
These responsibilities are more common among managers of small clubs.

The wishes of a national team manager may sometimes conflict with those of a club manager over selection of club players for the national squad; the club manager may not wish the player to miss domestic fixtures. For this reason, in many cases, national football team managers are selected from current club team managers and also in many cases, they select the players of their clubs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==European and North American managers==
The title of manager is almost exclusively used in [[Football in the United Kingdom|British football]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/blogs/sw48.html|title=Manager or Coach?|publisher=Football Italia|date=2008-09-05|accessdate=2011-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the majority of countries where professional football is played, the person responsible for the direction of a team is awarded the position of [[Coach (sport)|coach]] or "trainer". For instance, despite the general equivalence in responsibilities, [[Bobby Robson]] was referred to as the manager of England, while [[Joachim Löw]] was described as the head coach of Germany (Germany also has a team manager role that is subordinate to the head coach and that is filled by [[Oliver Bierhoff]]). For 1994-96 including [[Euro 96]], however, [[The Football Association]] struggled to identify an alternative candidate to [[Terry Venables]], so their discomfort with his soiled reputation for probity was articulated in their appointment of him as England 'coach' rather than under the traditional title of 'manager'.

The responsibilities of a European football manager or head coach tend to be divided up in North American professional sports, where the teams usually have a separate [[General manager#Sports teams|general manager]] and [[Coach (sport)|head coach]] (known as a [[Manager (baseball)|field manager]] in baseball), although occasionally a person may fill both these roles. While the first team coach in football is usually an assistant to the manager who actually holds the real power, the American-style general manager and head coach have clearly distinct areas of responsibilities. For example, a typical European football manager would have the final say on in-game decisions (including player line-ups), and off-the-field and roster management decisions (including contract negotiations). In American sports, these duties would be handled separately by the head coach and general manager, respectively.

It consists of 4 blocks with 12 floors where 767&lt;ref name="toas-fi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toas.fi/asunnot/mikontalo |title=Mikontalo |accessdate=2010-10-19 |last= |first= |work= |publisher=TOAS |language=Finnish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104210711/http://www.toas.fi/asunnot/mikontalo |archivedate=2010-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; dwellings are situated. Mikontalo offers for its inhabitants saunas (two per building), a free gym, public lounge with a TV-set, Nintendo Wii, Soundsystem, board games, coffee machine and microwave; laundry room (5 washing and 2 drying machines), cable TV, and connection to the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name="toas-en" /&gt;

According to word of mouth, Mikontalo is the biggest dwelling building in Finland, and even within the [[Nordic Countries]]. This is however hard to confirm.

The building went through major renovations from Summer 2007 until Summer 2009.&lt;ref name="toas-en" /&gt; During the renovation [[Juliet balcony|juliet balconies]] were added to some of the apartments. Also the façade panels were painted with [[bluish grey]] color, replacing red, orange and yellow colors.

==Mikontalo Lights==
[[File:Mikontalolights.JPG|right|thumb|Mikontalolights event]]
In early December 2007, the D block of Mikontalo, while undergoing the reconstruction, was the scene of the Mikontalolights project.

The object of Mikontalolights project was to create the world's physically largest colored graphics platform by using the [[window]]s of Mikontalo's D block as light [[pixel]]s. The platform was used for playing [[Tetris]] and other games and present demos created by the students of [[Tampere University of Technology]]. The project climaxed on December 4 when the new lights of the building were lit. The goal was to gain global visibility for Tampere University of Technology and the rich student culture of city of Tampere.

Mikontalolights was a part of the 42nd jubilee year of the Student Union of Tampere University of Technology. Mikontalolights was fully carried out by students who were willing to give their work contribution besides their studies. TOAS and the building contractor of Mikontalo Rakennustoimisto Palmberg Oy made it possible to accomplish Mikontalolights by providing Mikontalo as a platform for the project.

==History==
[[File:Lee H Nelson Hall.jpg|thumb|left|240px|NCPTT offices are located in Lee H. Nelson Hall, a property listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]]]NCPTT has its beginnings in "Technologies for Prehistoric and Historic Preservation," the Office of Technology Assessment that U.S. Congress published in September 1986. This report was requested by the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs to assess preservation technologies and their use by federal agencies in the implementation of laws relating to prehistoric and historic preservation. Among the major findings of this report was the need for:
*Training in the use of technologies,
*Studying ways to apply known technologies to preservation problems,
*Improving information sharing and coordination,
*Finding the appropriate fit of technologies to preservation problems,
*Reducing the costs of new technologies, and
*Developing standards for the application of new technologies
The report cited the critical need to establish a federally funded institution as a mechanism to coordinate research, disseminate information and provide training about new technologies in preservation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncptt.nps.gov/wiki/index.php/History_of_NCPTT&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''nylon rope trick''' is a [[scientific demonstration]] that illustrates some of the fundamental chemical principles of [[step-growth polymerization]] and provides students and other observers with a hands-on demonstration of the preparation of a [[synthetic polymer]].

The nylon rope trick typically makes use of a water solution of an aliphatic diamine with a solution of an aliphatic diacid chloride in a solvent that does not dissolve in water, yielding a synthetic polyamide of the [[nylon]]-type. Nylon 610 is commonly used, in which [[hexamethylene diamine]] is dissolved in water to a concentration of about 0.40 [[Molar concentration|moles / deciliter]].  A solution of [[sebacoyl chloride]] in [[cyclohexane]] (0.15 moles / deciliter concentration) is then layered on top of the water solution, the reaction typically being conducted in a [[Beaker (glassware)|beaker]].  The solution is not agitated; instead the nylon 610 polymer forms as a flexible film at the interface of the water and cyclohexane layers, in an example of an [[Interfacial Polymerization|interfacial polymerization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacRitchie|first1=F.|title=Mechanism of interfacial polymerization|journal=Transactions of the Faraday Society|date=1969|volume=65|pages=2503|doi=10.1039/TF9696502503}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experimentalist grasps the polymer film, withdrawing it from the reaction vessel, forming a filament or rope, and collecting it on a rotating rod above the reaction vessel.  New polymer forms at the interface as fresh surfaces of the cyclohexane layer and the water layer form.  In this way, the demonstration yields a continuous rope that is collected on the rotating rod. [[Nylon 66]] can also be produced at laboratory scale in this way.

Representative procedures and equipment lists for conducting the nylon rope trick demonstration are available in literature procedures.&lt;ref name=Lister&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lister|first1=Ted|title=Classic Chemistry Demonstrations|date=1995|publisher=The Royal Society of Chemistry|location=London|isbn=1 870 343 387|page=159|url=http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/content/filerepository/CMP/00/001/001/Classicdemos_full.pdf|accessdate=3 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816215935/http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/content/filerepository/CMP/00/001/001/Classicdemos_full.pdf|archivedate=16 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''online lecture''' is an educational [[lecture]] designed to be posted online. Lectures are recorded to video, audio or both, then uploaded and made viewable on a designated [[Website|site]]. Students may go to a certain designated site to view the lecture online at a time which is convenient for them.

Traditionally, vocal education is possible only when the teacher and the pupil are together in the same room, where the teacher passes on the information in the same vicinity of the student. Online lectures are now possible with the advent of video communications. The development of the online lecture makes it possible so that the teacher and student no longer have to be in the same vicinity to teach and learn, respectively.

There are certain advantages to online lecturing. Students may access online lectures posted on their designated websites anywhere in the world, at any time they wish, as long as they have an [[Internetworking|internet connection]]. They can also be repeated for the sake of [[Notetaking|note taking]]. Studies have shown that students improve significantly in courses with online archived lectures.&lt;ref name=casca&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cascaval|first1=Radu C.|last2=Fogler|first2=Kethera A.|last3=Abrams|first3=Gene D.|last4=Durham|first4=Robert L.|title=Evaluating the Benefits of Providing Archived Online Lectures to In-Class Math Students|journal=Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks|date=December 2008|volume=12|pages=61–70|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ837515|accessdate=September 24, 2016|language=en|issn=1939-5256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also noted that the overall experience of a course has improved with the addition of online lectures.&lt;ref name=casca/&gt; There are disadvantages to online lecturing, namely the lack of [[face-to-face interaction]], and the fact that students cannot easily contact their instructors unless a communications link is created. Additionally, attendance for in-class lectures may drop due to archived lectures. This can be avoided with in class quizzes or by postponing posting lectures until after the in-class session.&lt;ref name=casca/&gt;

The '''Pacific Trade and Development Conference (PAFTAD)''' is an informal private academic conference series that, since its origins in 1968, has developed into a driving force behind the development of thought on Pacific trade and development issues and important economic policy questions facing the region.

The ideas and discussions generated by PAFTAD have helped drive and shape other Pacific economic cooperation organisations, including [[Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) and the [[Pacific Economic Cooperation Council]] (PECC).

Each PAFTAD conference is organised around a particular theme, and research papers addressing the topic are presented and discussed. The results are published in the PAFTAD volume series.

==History==

Since its inception in 1968 the PAFTAD conference series has established itself as one of the leading sources of ideas and discussion on issues affecting economic development in the [[Asia Pacific]]. A private organisation with no formal government ties, PAFTAD has been, and continues to be a driving force for ideas about policy innovation and development at both the national and regional levels.

The essence of PAFTAD’s contribution is both intellectual and practical: it generates ideas about regional economic exchange and integration, provides empirical evidence to support or reject policy proposals and facilitates ongoing debate among policy influential experts. The ideas and evidence generated by PAFTAD have entered the public policy dialogue of most Asia Pacific economies, due in no small part to the intellectual and policy leadership shown by PAFTAD participants at both a national and regional level.

==34th PAFTAD Conference - Beijing 2009==

'''Theme:'''  “China’s Role in the World Economy”

'''Host:''' China Centre for Economic Research (CCER), Peking University [https://web.archive.org/web/20090616001502/http://www.eaber.org/intranet/publish/paftad/index.php]

==Fellowship for Young Scholars==

[[image:PAFTAD 32 Young Fellows.jpg|140px|thumb|Young Fellows at PAFTAD 32 in Vietnam.]]

The PAFTAD Fellowship for Young Scholars is available to graduate students and faculty members aged 35 years and below, and is considered one of the most distinguished fellowships available to young scholars in the region.  The PAFTAD International Steering Committee selects 8 aspiring researchers as PAFTAD Fellows to present papers on themes related to Asia Pacific trade and economic development for each conference.  Selection is based on the quality of a written submission as judged by the Selection Panel from PAFTAD’s distinguished International Steering Committee.

This year the Fellowships will take young scholars to [[Beijing]] where they will present their papers the day prior to PAFTAD's 34th Conference on December 6 and participate in the PAFTAD Conference itself on 7–9 December.

==Notable alumni==

Numerous PAFTAD alumni have occupied senior political and policy positions in regional governments and organisations, with Indonesian Minister of Trade [[Mari Pangestu]], a long-time PAFTAD participant, being a recent example. The extent of PAFTAD’s contribution to regional development was apparent in the formation of APEC.

Two of PAFTAD’s earliest leaders, Professor Sir [[John Crawford (economist)|John Crawford]] and Dr [[Saburo Okita]], were instrumental in leading their countries to establish the tripartite Pacific Economic Cooperation Committee (PECC). In turn PECC, which shares many
members in common with PAFTAD, developed recognition among nations of the region of the need for a framework to support and enhance the rapid growth in regional trade, investment and technology transfer: APEC.

'''Rashtriya Uchchattar Shiksha Abhiyan''' ('''RUSA''') ([[Hindi]] for "National Higher Education Mission") is a [[holistic education|holistic scheme]] of development for [[higher education in India]] initiated in 2013 by the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Ministry of Human Resource Development]], [[Government of India]]. The [[Centrally Sponsored Scheme|centrally sponsored scheme]] aims at providing strategic funding to higher educational institutions throughout the country. Funding is provided by the central ministry through the state governments and [[Union territories of India|union territories]] (UT), which in coordination with the central Project Appraisal Board will monitor the academic, administrative and financial advancements taken under the scheme.&lt;ref name=nitin&gt;{{cite news|last=Nitin|title=What is Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyaan (RUSA)?|url=http://education.oneindia.in/news/2013/11/13/what-is-rashtriya-uchchatar-shiksha-abhiyaan-rusa-007505.html|accessdate=2 February 2014|newspaper=One India Education|date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 316 state public universities and 13,024 colleges will be covered under it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Govt launches Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan for bouldering Higher Education|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2013/10/govt-launches-rashtriya-uchchatar-shiksha-abhiyan-for-bouldering-higher-education/|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Innovative educational policies in India have been a huge success. [[Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan]] (SSA) launched in 2001 for [[elementary education]] and [[Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan]] (RMSA) launched in 2009 for [[secondary education]] produced great results in the educational developments. For higher education [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] (UGC) has a provision for routine innovation and development fundings. UGC funds are quite adequate for centrally funded universities and colleges, which are recognised under sections 12B and 2(f) of UGC Act. However, as of 31 March 2012 statistics, the higher education sector in India consisted of 574 universities and 35,539 colleges, out of which 214 universities are not covered under 12B of UGC Act, and only 6,787 colleges are registered under 12B
and 2(f). Thus a larger number of higher institutes run by state governments, which are limited in their own management, are not provided with sufficient financial support to enhance their facilities for educational reforms. Therefore, a separate scheme for state/UT-managed universities and colleges was proposed by the [[National Development Council (India)|National Development Council]] (NDC) as part of the [[Five-year plans of India|12th Five-Year Plan]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=National Higher Education Mission :: RUSA, a boon for state higher education|url=http://e-pao.net/epPageExtractor.asp?src=education.National_Higher_Education_Missio_RUSA_a_boon_for_state_higher_education.html..|accessdate=2 February 2014|newspaper=E-Pao!|date=25 October 2013|author=N. Premananda Singh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved it in October 2013.&lt;ref name=pib&gt;{{cite web|title=Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan for reforming state higher education system|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=99841|publisher=National Informatics Centre|author=Press Information Bureau|date=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==

RUSA aims to provide equal development to all higher institutions and rectify weaknesses in the higher education system. Its target achievement is to raise the gross enrolment ratio to 32% by the end of XII Plan in 2017. The major objectives are to:&lt;ref name=mhrd&gt;{{cite web|title=Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan: National Higher Education Mission|url=http://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/RUSA_final090913.pdf|publisher=National Informatics Centre|accessdate=2 February 2014|author=Ministry of Human Resource Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CCEA approves Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA)|url=http://currentaffairs.gktoday.in/ccea-approves-rashtriya-uchchatar-shiksha-abhiyan-rusa-1020139133.html|accessdate=2 February 2014|newspaper=General Knowledge Today|date=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#improve the overall quality of existing state institutions by ensuring that all institutions conform to prescribed norms and standards and adopt accreditation as a mandatory quality assurance framework.
#usher transformative reforms in the state higher education system by creating a facilitating institutional structure for planning and monitoring at the state level, promoting autonomy in state universities and improving governance in institutions.
#ensure academic and examination reforms in the higher educational institutions.
#enable conversion of some of the universities into research universities at par with the best in the world.
#create opportunities for states to undertake reforms in the affiliation system in order to ensure that the reforms and resource requirements of affiliated colleges are adequately met.
#ensure adequate availability of quality faculty in all higher educational institutions and ensure capacity building at all levels of employment.
#create an enabling atmosphere in the higher educational institutions to devote themselves to research and innovations.
#expand the institutional base by creating additional capacity in existing institutions and establishing new institutions, in order to achieve enrolment targets.
#correct regional imbalances in access to higher education by facilitating access to high quality institutions in [[urban area|urban]] and semi-urban areas, creating opportunities for students from [[Rural area|rural]] areas to get access to better quality institutions and setting up institutions in un-served and underserved areas.
#improve equity in higher education by providing adequate opportunities of higher education to [[Scheduled tribes|SC]]/[[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|STs]] and socially and educationally backward classes; promote inclusion of women, minorities, and differently abled persons.

==Funding process==

RUSA is provided by the central Ministry of Human Resource Development directly to the state and UT governments. From the state/UT budget the funds are disbursed to individual institutions. The funding to states would be made on the basis of critical appraisal of state plans for higher education plans. The amount of funding from central government will be 60% of the total grants, and 40% will be contributed by the state/UT as matching share. For [[northeast India|northeastern states]], [[Sikkim]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]], and [[Uttarakhand]] the matching share is waived to 10%.&lt;ref name=mhrd/&gt; During the 12th Five-Year Plan period between 2012–2017, RUSA is allotted a financial outlay of INR 228.55 billion, of which INR 162.27 billion will be contributed by the central government. During the first phase, 80 new universities would be created by converting autonomous colleges/colleges in a cluster to state universities. 100 new colleges would be set up and 54 existing colleges would be converted into model degree colleges. Infrastructure grants would be given to 150 universities and 3,500 colleges to upgrade and fill critical gaps in infrastructure especially libraries, laboratories, etc. Further additional 5,000 faculty positions would be supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan|url=http://www.erewise.com/current-affairs/rashtriya-uchchatar-shiksha-abhiyan_art5267c66a978f2.html#.Uu44cfv9HIU|newspaper=erewise|date=23 October 2013|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then the scheme will extend into the 13th Five-Year Plan.&lt;ref name=pib/&gt;

'''RateMyTeachers.com''' ('RMT') is a [[review site]] used to rate [[K-12]] and [[college]] teachers and schools.  Participants are asked to rate their teachers on a scale of 1 to 5 in the categories of ''easiness'', ''helpfulness'', ''knowledge'', and ''clarity'', with the latter two factoring into an "overall quality" score.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ratemyteachers.com/faq&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals can also write brief comments on their experiences with the teachers.  As of April 2010, over eleven million teachers had been rated on the website.

RMT was launched in 2001 by Mister Message, LLC and later sold to former [[RateMyProfessors.com]] owner [[Patrick Nagle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/stories/2008/04/14/tidbits4.htmlBaltimore Business Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; RateMyTeachers.com currently services websites in the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Ireland]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

RateMyTeachers.com was governed by a public community of volunteers who were granted the power to add, remove and delete teacher listings and teacher ratings. The public community was replaced in 2017 by a private moderation community. The private moderation community was tasked to manually re-review every rating and teacher added to RMT since 2001. The private moderation community reviews over 100,000 ratings a day.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Controversy==
RateMyTeachers.com is controversial in certain circles and many have questioned its approach. The site is open to the general public with no requirement to reveal their first or last name when commenting. This has led some to worry that those surfing the Internet can leave libellous comments without any repercussions to their own reputation. In 2007, the Queensland College of Teachers called for the shutdown of the page "until it can be established that it provides a credible service".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qct.edu.au/Publications/Periodical/CollegeConnectionApril2007.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419195725/http://www.qct.edu.au/Publications/Periodical/CollegeConnectionApril2007.PDF |archivedate=19 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }} (pg. 5)&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003, the [[New York State United Teachers]] (NYSUT) sought a court injunction to shut down the site, though the request was denied on free speech grounds. In April 2007 the British education secretary [[Alan Johnson]] said that the online harassment of teachers performed by sites such as RateMyTeachers.com needs to stop. This caused articles on RateMyTeachers by national and international press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/story/0,,2053648,00.html|title=Ban cyber-bullying clips, Johnson to urge websites|date=10 April 2007|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4957">{{Other uses|Reaping (disambiguation)}}The '''Re-Engineering Assessment Practices in Scottish Higher Education''' project, or '''REAP''', is one of six projects funded under the [[Scottish Funding Council]]'s E-learning Transformation Programme. The project is piloting improved models of [[Educational assessment|assessment]] across three [[universities]] - the [[University of Strathclyde]], [[Glasgow Caledonian University]] and the [[University of Glasgow]].

==Project vision==
In the REAP project, [[Educational assessment|assessment]] is defined broadly to include tutor, peer and [[self-assessment]] processes. The goal is to develop new models of assessment geared to fostering [[lifelong learning]] skills. The vision is that, over the course of an [[undergraduate degree]], students should develop their own capacity to self-assess, reflect on, and take an active role in managing their own learning. New technologies can help support the development of learner self-regulation (See [[Self-regulated learning]]).

==Educational research==
Assessment is a key driver of student learning (See [[Student-centred learning]]); it determines both how and what students study. Yet, research shows that prevailing modes of assessment often promote high teacher workloads rather than enhanced student learning. There is a need to rethink institutional assessment systems - away from a model where teachers transmit marks, to one where students develop, over the course of a degree, their own ability to self-assess and self-correct.

The educational basis for the REAP project is recent research on assessment. Black and William (1998) carried out a [[meta-analysis]] of research on [[formative assessment]], over a 10-year period, across the schools and HE sectors. They showed that where assessments focused on generating feedback and encouraging its use the learning gains were 'among the largest ever reported for educational interventions'. Other researchers have shown how formative assessment and feedback might support the development of learner self-regulation (Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick 2006). Still others have shown how assessment might be used to engage students in [[active learning]] over the course of their studies (Gibbs and Simpson, 2004) or might simultaneously enhance both immediate and lifelong learning needs (Boud, 2000). Despite these recent publications, this research has had little impact on HE practices. The current project will address this gap by drawing on current thinking and on the potential available through new technologies (Nicol &amp; Milligan, 2006).

==Project activities==
The REAP project involves the re-engineering of assessment practices in large enrolment first year classes across a range of departments/disciplines. A portfolio of technologies will be piloted to support assessment re-engineering including [[virtual learning environment]]s (VLEs), e-Portfolios (See [[electronic portfolio]]), [[personal response system]]s, [[computer simulation]]s and new communication tools.

==Benefits to Higher Education sector==
* '''Case exemplars''' of innovative assessment practices including evidence of the learning and efficiency benefits across a range of disciplines. 
* '''Records of the change management processes''' (See [[Change management process]]) engaged in by departments and faculties as they re-engineered their own assessment policies and practices. 
* '''Analysis of changes''' required in organisational, management, human and technological processes within institutions in order to sustain improved assessment practices.

==Key members of REAP==
* '''Professor David Nicol''' – Project Director
* '''Ms Catherine Owen''' – Project Manager
* '''Dr Gillian Roberts''' – Project Co-ordinator at GCU
* '''Dr Steve Draper''' - Project Co-ordinator at GU

'''The Recurse Center''' (formerly known as '''Hacker School'''; also called '''RC''') is an independent educational institution, combining a retreat for computer programmers with a [[Recruitment|recruiting]] agency. The retreat is an [[intentional community]], a self-directed academic environment for programmers of all levels to improve their skills in, without charge. There is no curriculum and no particular programming languages or paradigms are institutionally favored; instead, participants work on [[Open-source software|open-source projects]] of their own choice, alone or collaboratively, as they see best. The Center has been an active advocate for [[Women in computing|women in programming]].

== History ==

The Center was initially founded in the Summer of 2010 as '''Hackruiter''', an engineering [[recruitment|recruiting]] company, using seed money from [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]]. The idea quickly arose of trying to transform recruiting for start-ups by running a retreat as part of the process, with the goal of helping clients become better programmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It officially opened its doors as “Hacker School” in New York in July, 2011, obliquely anticipating the [[Coding Bootcamp|coding bootcamp]] movement that arose in the mid-2010s. Hacker School came to wide public attention in mid-2012, when it partnered with the e-commerce company [[Etsy]] to offer “Hacker Grants” in support of female developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A number of companies soon joined Etsy in funding these grants, and in 2014 the grant program expanded to offer support to other groups not well represented in American technology industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2015 Hacker School was renamed the Recurse Center.

== Business model ==

The programming retreat is free of charge for admitted applicants to attend. The organization itself is for-profit and supports itself through recruitment, by placing some participants in programming jobs.&lt;ref name='jobs'&gt;{{cite web

	|title= Jobs, recruiting, and how we make money 
	|publisher= Recurse Center  
	|work= Manual
	|accessdate= November 26, 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the retreat reached the "tipping point" of self-sufficiency purely from recruiting income.&lt;ref name='blog-83'&gt;{{cite web

	|accessdate= November 26, 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internal costs to the company have been reported at "nearly $12,000" for each participant.&lt;ref name='jobs' /&gt;

The Center does not publish statistics on its admission rate, although there is no published rule against reapplication.

== Educational philosophy and name ==

There is no curriculum; each participant imposes their own structure for self-directed learning on their stay at the Recurse Center, with guidance as requested. Despite its original name ”Hacker School“, the Recurse Center is not a school — its model of self-directed learning was inspired by the [[Unschooling]] philosophy of [[John Holt (educator)|John Holt]] (1923–1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Nor does it have any connection to the popular notion of a hacker as someone who breaks into computer systems — rather, “hacker” here was intended to suggest a programmer who is technically resourceful but also supportive of other programmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

	|accessdate= May 1, 2013
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the organization changed its name to the Recurse Center to avoid confusion over these matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Since its founding, the faculty have experimented continually with day-to-day experience in the retreat. Experiments have included:

== Social environment and influence ==

The Center did not initially publish a code of conduct, but eventually formalized its expectations of participant behavior in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  
	|url= https://www.recurse.com/code-of-conduct
	|title= Code of Conduct
	|publisher= Recurse Center  
        |date= June 9, 2017
	|accessdate= June 9, 2017
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, to promote a study environment in which people feel comfortable asking each other for guidance and criticism, the Center has long used a set of “lightweight social rules” to guide interactions between participants. In contrast to traditional “[[Code of conduct|codes of conduct]]”, many of which have a legalistic tone, the social rules are intended to shepherd community behavior unobtrusively, “to remove as many distractions as possible so everyone can focus on programming.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  
	|url= https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules
	|title= Social rules
	|work= Manual
	|publisher= Recurse Center  
	|accessdate= November 25, 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These social rules are one of the retreat's most influential features and have been adopted by a number of other programming communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There is a large community of alumni that have remained active past the end of their ”batch“, interacting with each other and with new participants in person or via virtual tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specializations of participants ==

The level of participants' skill and experience is diverse, in common with retreats in other creative fields and unlike many engineering organizations. Participants range from long-experienced software developers on [[Career break|sabbatical]], to people who have been coding for only a few months, to retirees, to college students on vacation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some participants hold doctoral degrees; others have left school before completing secondary or even primary education. Many participants are engineers, but others have strong non-engineering backgrounds, in the Humanities, journalism, pure mathematics, the performing arts, among many others.

The '''Siebel Scholars''' program was established by the Thomas and Stacey Siebel Foundation in 2000 to recognize the most talented students at 29 graduate schools of business, computer science, bioengineering, and energy science in the United States, China, France, Italy, and Japan.

Funding for the Siebel Scholars program was established through grants totaling more than $45 million.  Each year, top graduate students from each institution are selected as Siebel Scholars. Siebel Scholars are selected by the Deans of each school on the basis of outstanding academic performance and qualities of leadership to receive a $35,000 award.  The specific process varies from school to school.

Siebel Scholars are key advisors to the Siebel Foundation, guiding the development of innovative programs the Foundation initiates. The annual Siebel Scholars conference and ongoing planning sessions throughout the year are an integral part of the Siebel Scholars program.

Its main design criterion is to create a scripting language that can interface with C++, transforming data and returning the result. This enables C++ applications to change their functionality after installation.

==Hello world example==
The basic "Hello World!" TScript example.
&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
CTScript ts;
ts.SetParameter(CTScript::SOURCE_STRING,0,TEXT("main(){")
TEXT("   System::MessageBox(L\"Hello World!\");")
TEXT("}"));
ts.ExecuteStaticMethod();
&lt;/source&gt;

==TVariables==
The standard variable&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekkysoftware.com/Documentation/TScript/TVariableBasics TScript TVariable Help Documentation]&lt;/ref&gt; can be formed as fixed data such as a Boolean, Integer or Decimal and a variable length variable such as an ASCII string, wide character string or a binary string. The type of the data can be used to define variable or the type can be explicitly declared, so for example the code - "variable myInteger = 0;" will create a variable called myInteger and assign it the value of zero. An Integer type can also be declared as - "Integer myInteger;" and its default value will be set to zero.

TVariable are hierarchical in nature and are very similar to [[XML]], [[Javascript|JavaScript]] and [[PHP]] variables.

The TVariable type is also transient as an Integer can be changed into an AString by assigning it a string value or by casting the variable to an AString. For example after an integer variable has been created and used, it can be reassigned by equating it to an AString.

TVariables can also be used to hold an array of TVariables. Once a valid variable has been created, the array index subscripting notation can be used to transform it into an array, so for example the code - "variable list = {0,2,4,6};" will create an array with four elements. The TVariable type for "list.type" will be that of a structure and each element of "list[0].type" will be an Integer.

Class in TScript are similar to array in how TVariable handle them, but use strings as array scriptures. For example the code - "variable list = {"Monday" =&gt; true, "Tuesday" =&gt; false};" will create a structured variable where list. Monday is true and list.Tuesday is false. In the native C++ code, structured TVariable elements are accessible in C++ by - list["Monday"]; or by either list.Monday or list["Monday"] in native code.

==Defined variables (classes)==
Supporting hierarchical variables, TScript is able to store both primitive and complex variables within the same variable structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekkysoftware.com/Documentation/TScript/DefinedVariables TScript Documentation - Defined Variables]&lt;/ref&gt; This removes any requirement for any unique difference between primitives and structured data, therefore making the class structure a logical grouping of functionality rather than data storage type.

TScript implements concepts of inheritance and code encapsulation through defined variables. For example the following code snippet show a defined variables ''Foo'' and ''Bar'' that supports a constructor.
&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
variable Bar{
   Integer minimum, maximum;
   Bar(){
      this.minimum = 1;
   }
}

variable Foo extends Bar{
   WString name;
   Foo(WString name){
      this.name = name;
      this.Bar();
   }
}

public main(){
   Foo foo(L"Goo");
   System::MessageBox(foo.ToString());
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

==Function declarations==
Another striking feature of TScript is the function declarations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekkysoftware.com/Documentation/TScript/Function-Declarations TScript Documentation - Function Declarations]&lt;/ref&gt; which use [[output parameter]]s rather than [[return value]]s, and provide syntactic support for these. The standard function in many procedural languages, following Algol, is of the form:
:['''return type'''] &lt;'''function name'''&gt;(['''input variable'''], ...).
In TScript this pattern has been changed to the form:
:&lt;'''function name'''&gt;(['''input variable'''],... :['''output variable'''],...).
This change has done two things, first it allows multiple output variables and secondly it changed the return statement to an error handling function.

Allowing functions to have a list of input and output variables that are separated by the semi column ":", changed the normal flow of how the function are called and used. This removes some of the need for using reference pointers to return multiple variables that is common in C/C++, and the use of references in most other scripting languages is actually prevented, forcing the use of a structure or array to return multiple values.

The second noticeable thing about the calling conventions is that now all functions have an integrated error handling purpose similar to try{…}catch(…){…} and trow new Exception() of C++ and Java. In TScript since all functions return an error, the return statement operates similar to the throw statement. For example the statement:- return error = "Have an error message"; will terminate the function and return the error message. Alternatively the blank statement;- return; will terminate the function but not return any error.

===Example of multiple return values===
&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
public TextExtent(WString text : Integer width, Integer height){
   text = text.Fragment(L"\n");
   for(height = width = 0; height &lt; text.length; height++){
      if(width &lt; text[height].length) width = text[height].length;
   }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Shorthand notation===

For convenience TScript offers a shorthand function calling in the situation where there is only one returned variable. This notation of will substitute the case of function(: variable); for variable = function();. This short notation prevents the calling code from catching any errors and they will automatically be return to the parental calling code.

==Error handling==

Error handling in many other languages is done through the use of [[Exception handling|exceptions]]. TScript uses a similar process of error handling,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekkysoftware.com/Documentation/TScript/Error-Handling TScript Documentation - Error Handling]&lt;/ref&gt; although slightly different. TScript has a global error variable similar to the traditional [[errno]] in C, although the error variable in TScript is capable to holding both an error code and a detailed error message.

In many languages that use the try{...}catch(...){...} syntax the error is returned via the catch statement and this can make the operational flow of the code awkward in situations where some errors are recoverable. TScript uses the if(...){...} else{...} notation that allows calling code to filter the error, potentially recovering from the error and returning to normal operation, or returning the error to the its own calling function.

===Example of return and handling errors===

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
function(){return error = -1;}

public main(){
   if(!function()){
      if(error != -1) return error;
   }
   System::MessageBox(L"function executed correctly");
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Run-time linking==
C++ supports [[function overloading]], which enables functions to have the same name while being differentiated by their input parameters. This causes TScript an issue while supporting [[Strong and weak typing|loose type]] variables, as there is no way to tell what the type of a variable is until the software is being executed.

To counter this problem, TScript has been written with run-time linking. This is when the particular function called is dependent on the type of the variables when the function is called.

This is an unusual tactic that has some additional benefits. First it means that there is no need to declare functions before they are used, for example in C++ two functions may call one another, like ''void Foo(){ Bar();}'' and ''void Bar(){Bar();}''. In this situation, the ''Bar()'' needs to be prototyped in order for the ''Foo()'' to call it. TScript's run-time linking means the functions can be declared in any order without the need to prototype. This can make writing code much easier for less experienced programmers, allowing them to focus on the logic of the software and not the requirements of the language.

Run-time linking also enables the language to support run-time coding with methods like ''AddMethod'' and ''AddDefinedVariable''. This enables TScript programs to write themselves. For example, when using the [[SOAP]] interface, the remote [[WSDL]] will be encoded into the script library, allowing the functions within to be called as if they were coded at design time. Additionally it is also possible to write code that can learn for itself, writing new functions when it needs it.

==Dynamically linking libraries==

TScript is among a small group is scripting languages that provide the functionality to [[Dynamic-link library|dynamically load]] and link to existing shared libraries. Java through its [[JNI]] and [[Visual Basic|VB6]] are two other scripting languages that enable code to be written that would load a third party library and execute through its native interface. This gives TScript the ability to use a wealth of pre-existing functionality and code written in different languages and this can be done without any need to change the shared library’s interface or to be compiled with the source code.

==Memory management==

TScript uses the standard C++ class encapsulation to allocate and de-allocate memory resources. This means that all allocated memory is released when the variable containing it is destroyed and operated differently from the Garbage Collection model of Java or the reference counting model of [[.NET Framework|.NET]] languages.

Operation system resources such as files, sockets and encryption keys are managed via a reference counting mechanism similar to .NET, so they will be released as soon as there are no variables containing their values.

==Pro-active security==

With the ability to load existing shared libraries, script can access all privileges granted to the user who executes it. To guard against malicious code, all resources beyond the basic memory allocation are required to be granted to each script. This also includes the ability to use message boxes to prompt the user, read and/or write access to any file or directory, or using the Internet connection.

This security architecture is designed to allow the running of scripts in a similar way to [[Javascript|JavaScript]] while enabling the usefulness of more powerful scripting languages like [[PERL]].

'''Thirteenth grade''' or '''grade thirteen''' is the final year of [[secondary school]] in some jurisdictions. In some locales it is compulsory, while it is optional in others.

==Canada==
{{main|Ontario Academic Credit}}
The Ontario Academic Credit (OAC) ({{lang-fr|Cours préuniversitaire de l'Ontario}} or CPO) was a fifth year of secondary school education designed for students preparing for [[post-secondary education]] that existed in the province of [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. The OAC curriculum was codified by the Ontario Ministry of Education in ''Ontario Schools:&amp;nbsp;Intermediate and Senior'' (OS:IS) and its revisions. The Ontario education system had five years of secondary education, the fifth year known as "grade 13" from 1921 to 1988. Then, grade 13 was replaced in 1983 by the OAC for students starting high school ([[grade 9]]). The OAC continued to act as a fifth year of secondary education until it was phased out in 2003.&lt;ref name=vicl&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/ERIC_EJ907035|title=Pathways to university: The "Victory Lap" Phenomenon in Ontario/journal=Canadian Journal of Educational Administration and Policy|last1=Brady|first1=Patrick|last2=Allingham|first2=Philip|issue=113|date=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''For the [[Pitchshifter (band)|Pitchshifter]] song, see [[Underachiever (song)]]. For the hip hop duo, see [[The Underachievers]].''

An '''underachiever''' is a person who fails to achieve his or her [[potential]] or does not do as well as expected.{{by whom?|date=November 2012}}

Of particular interest is '''academic underachievement'''.  Studies of individuals who have not realized their apparent potential have identified [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]], [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], and many other educational problems, and subsequently enabled methods of addressing these problems.  Current theories among academic scholars prefer to address underperformance problems with remedial help.  

The term is also used more generally; for example, a sports team that contains many star players but still loses games against teams with relatively little obvious talent might be termed underachieving. A [[stock]] which achieves poor [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] and/or [[capital gain]]s despite sound underlying business and/or [[asset]]s may be called underachieving.

'''University of Khartoum''' (shortened to '''UofK''') ({{lang-ar|جامعة الخرطوم}}) is a multi-campus, co-educational, public [[university]] located in [[Khartoum]]. It is the largest and oldest [[university]] in [[Sudan]]. UofK was founded as [[Gordon Memorial College]] in 1902 and established in 1956 when Sudan gained independence. Since that date, the University of Khartoum has been recognized as a top university and a high-ranked academic institution in [[Sudan]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Akec, John A. (14 February 2009) [http://www.sudantribune.com/Why-the-university-education-still,30170 Why the university education still excites Sudanese?] The Sudan Tribune, Comment and Analysis, Retrieved 21 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It features several institutes, academic units and research centers including [[Mycetoma Research Center]], [[Soba University Hospital]], [[Saad Abualila Hospital]], [[Dr. Salma Dialysis centre]], [[Institute of Endemic Diseases]], [[Institute for Studies and Promotion of Animal Exports]], [[Institute of African and Asian Studies]], [[Institute of Prof. Abdalla ElTayeb for Arabic Language]], [[Development Studies and Research Institute]] and [[U of K publishing house]]. The [[Sudan Library]], a section of the university's library, serves as the [[national library]] of [[Sudan]].

== History ==
[[File:Khalda Zahir-bw.jpg|thumb|left|[[Khalida Zahir]], graduated as the first Sudanese female doctor in 1952&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unitykhartoum.blogspot.be/2011/07/khalda-zahir-of-almorada-village-ssa.html|title=The Unity High School Archive|author=Unity High School|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1898 after [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] gained dominance in Sudan as part of a [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|condominium]] arrangement, [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] proposed founding a college in the memory of [[Charles George Gordon|Gordon of Khartoum]], who was killed in the [[Battle of Khartoum]]. Gordon Memorial College was founded in 1902 with primary education being its sole program.
 
By 1906, the college was offering programs for training assistant engineers, land surveyors and primary school teachers. The first equipped laboratory for [[bacteriological analysis]] was added in 1905, with donations from [[Henry Wellcome|Sir Henry Wellcome]], an American-British pharmaceutical entrepreneur and archaeologist.

In 1924, the college incorporated programs in [[Sharia]], engineering, education (teachers training), clerical work, accounting and science. The [[Kitchener School of Medicine]], the first medical school in Sudan, was established.

In 1936, the School of Law was established. In 1947, the college was affiliated with [[University of London|The University of London]] as the first overseas participant in its "special relationship" scheme.  The first graduates to receive University of London degrees completed their programs in 1950. The next year, Gordon Memorial College was formally renamed University College Khartoum, which incorporated the Kitchener School of Medicine.

When Sudan gained independence in 1956, the new Parliament passed a bill to award university status to Khartoum University College. It officially became Khartoum University on 24 July 1956. The eminent horticultural scientist [[John Pilkington Hudson]] was a visiting professor in 1961-3, who founded its department of horticulture.&lt;ref&gt;ODNB entry: [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/99289 Retrieved 24 July 2011.]{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 April 1984, the Government announced the closure of all faculties of the university. The university was reopened fully on August 1.&lt;ref name="Eds.1986"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Haim Shaked|editor2=Daniel Dishon|title=Middle East Contemporary Survey, Vol. 8, 1983-84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t32OO3DkDikC&amp;pg=PA646|year=1986|publisher=The Moshe Dayan Center|isbn=978-965-224-006-4|page=646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3780">'''Vivian Trow Thayer''' (1886–1979) is best known as a Progressive educator who authored many books about [[American education]]. He was married to Florence Amelia Adams. 

Thayer was born in Nebraska and raised in rural Wisconsin. Thayer's father worked as a minister, rural mail-carrier, and farmer. The economic challenges of Thayer's early life impacted his sensitivity to the struggle of others later in his career.&lt;ref&gt;Kridel, Craig and Robert V. Bullough, Jr. ''Stories of the Eight-Year Study: Reexamining Secondary Education in America''. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2007. p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Carroll University|Carroll Academy]], and then moved to the [[University of Wisconsin at Madison]], where he received his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. in philosophy. While pursuing his degrees, Thayer worked to support himself through employment first as an attendant at a sanitarium, then in a restaurant, and later waiting tables in a boarding house. At one point, financial constraints forced him to take a two-year leave from the university and serve first as principal of an elementary school, and later as Superintendent of Schools, in [[Ashland, Wisconsin]].

During his tenure as Educational Director of the [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Ethical Culture Schools]] in New York City from 1928–1948, Thayer was involved with the [[Progressive Education Association]]. His role and work in the [[Eight-Year Study]] led to the formation of a second commission which he chaired: the Commission on the Secondary School Curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Cremin, Lawrence A. ''[[The Transformation of the School: Progressivism in American Education, 1876–1957]]''. New York: Random House, 1964. p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the commission were published in ''Reorganizing Secondary Education'' (1939).&lt;ref&gt;Zepper, John T. "V. T. Thayer: Progressive Educator." The Educational Forum May (1970): 495–504.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thayer is associated with the educational philosophy of [[John Dewey]], and worked with many leading Progressive educators. Among others were [[Boyd H. Bode]], [[Horace Kallen]], and [[Harold Alberty]]. Thayer lectured and taught at many universities, including Teacher's College, Columbia University; Harvard University; Ohio State University; the University of Hawaii; the University of Virginia; and Johns Hopkins University.

In 1933, Thayer was one of the original signories of the ''[[Humanist Manifesto]]'' (I). He served in editorial positions for the ''[[The American Review (literary journal)|American Review]]'' and the ''[[Journal of Educational Research]]''. Thayer was named a [[Kappa Delta Pi]] Laureate, Pioneer Humanist of the Year (1964) by the [[American Humanist Association]], and in 1969 received the Distinguished Lifetime Service to Education award from [[John Dewey Society|The John Dewey Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Linda L. G. ''Explore the Laureate Legacy: Vivian Trow Thayer 1957''. http://www.kdp.org/meetourlaureates/laureates/vivianthayer.php&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Ward Watkin''' (January 21, 1886 &amp;ndash; June 24, 1952) was an [[architect]] primarily practicing in [[Houston, Texas]].

Watkin was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] on January 21, 1886, and grew up in [[Danville, Pennsylvania]], where he graduated from high school in 1903.  After graduating from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1908, he spent a year in Europe and then moved to [[Boston, Massachusetts]] to join the architecture firm of [[Cram, Goodhue &amp; Ferguson]].  Watkin was then sent to [[Houston, TX]] to work on plans for [[Rice Institute]] (now named Rice University) and was the firm's representative supervisor there.  [[Edgar Odell Lovett]], the President of Rice Institute, offered Watkin a faculty position in architectural engineering when the Institute opened in 1912.  He later became the head of the architecture department, a position he held until his death.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fwa91 Handbook of Texas Online - William Ward Watkin]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his duties at Rice, Watkin designed a large number of structures, many of which are architecturally significant. He died and was interred at Forest Park Cemetery  in Houston .&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

==Early life==
William Ward Watkin's parents were Fred Ward and Mary Mathilda (née Hancock) Watkin. The family moved to [[Danville, Pennsylvania]], where young William graduated from Danville High School in 1903. He entered the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied architecture with [[Paul Philippe Cret]] and earned a B.S. degree in architecture in 1908. In 1909, he joined the Boston architectural firm of [[Cram, Goodhue, and Ferguson]].&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; In 1910, the firm sent him to [[Houston, Texas]] to supervise construction of the newly created Rice Institute (now [[Rice University]]).&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

Watkin married Annie Ray Townsend in 1914. They had three children, two daughters and a son: Annie Ray Watkin (1914-2011), Rosemary Watkin (1917-1984) and William Ward Watkin, Jr. (1919-2001). His first wife died in 1928. His second wife was Josephine Cockerel, who died in 1987.&lt;ref name="Find-A-Grave"&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8834090 "William Ward Watkin." Find a grave.] Accessed February 19, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Watkin's first major assignment was to oversee construction of a new school in [[Houston, Texas]] named the [[Rice Institute|William Marsh Rice Institute]]. Watkin had helped prepare the original masterplan drawings following intense correspondence between [[Ralph Adams Cram|Cram]], [[Bertram Goodhue|Goodhue]], and [[Edgar Odell Lovett|President Lovett]].&lt;ref&gt;https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/35961/generalplanofwil00foxs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The initial complement of structures included the [[Lovett Hall|Administration Building]] (now named Lovett Hall), a power plant and Mechanical Laboratory, and one dormitory with a dining hall, located on {{convert|300|acre|ha}} two miles southwest of downtown on an unpaved Main Street. The cornerstone of the Administration Building was laid in 1911.

===Academic career===
After the school opened in 1912, Watkin was hired by Dr. Edgar Odell Lovett, the president of Rice, to become an instructor in architectural engineering. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1915 and full professor in 1922. In this capacity, he would continue to work on newer buildings for the campus and nearby, such as:
* Autry House (1920), the unofficial student center across Main Street
* Rice Fieldhouse (1920)
* Harry Crothers Wiess House (1920), later purchased by Rice and used as the President's House.
* Chemistry Building (1925), later renamed Keck Hall
* Robert and Agnes Cohen House (1927), which houses the faculty club.

In 1927, he became a full professor and maintained that rank until his death in 1952.

Watkins established a traveling architectural fellowship in 1928, which enabled one student per year to travel abroad while studying architecture. The fellowship was renamed for its founder in 1953 and is now the William Ward Watkin Traveling Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;http://arch.rice.edu/Academics/William-Ward-Watkin-Traveling-Fellowship/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial practice===
Watkin also conducted a commercial architectural practice in parallel with his academic position. This enabled him to participate in creating a number of notable projects. Most were built in the Houston area, but a few were outside the area. For example, he designed the campus of [[Texas Tech University]] and its administration building in [[Lubbock, Texas]].
