      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2544">'''Anecdotal cognitivism''' is a psychological methodology that attributes mental states to animals on the basis of anecdotes and on the observation of particular cases, other than those observations made during controlled experiments. It is opposed to [[behaviorism]]; behaviorists are critical of anecdotal cognitivism, suggesting that controlled experiments are necessary to measure stimuli and record observable behavior. 

==Animal cognition==
Anecdotal cognitivism is often criticized by behaviorists using specific cases, such as that of [[Clever Hans]], to discredit using anecdotal evidence in assessing [[animal cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/andrewsk/documents/Keeley_Anthropomorphism.pdf|title=Anthropomorphism, primatomorphism, mammalomorphism: understanding cross-species comparisons|last=Keeley|first=Brian L.|date=2004|publisher=York University|pages=527|accessdate=2008-12-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081217060503/http://www.yorku.ca/andrewsk/documents/Keeley_Anthropomorphism.pdf| archivedate= 17 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Clever Hans, a [[horse]] was purported to be able to add and subtract using its hooves, and even answer questions surrounding [[European politics]], but it was determined by later research that the horse's owner was, in fact, unknowingly cueing the [[horse]], and that when he was removed from the room, the [[horse]] would not respond.

Anecdotal cognitivists respond to behaviorists by saying that [[behaviorism]] would have the animals 'lose their minds' and that it is clear that, by observation, they can know a great deal about the cognitive processes of animals. They add that the debate can start with simple observation, rather than in a controlled setting or in a lab.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5294">The '''Bakoya''' are [[pygmies]], earlier known as '''Négrilles''' or '''Babinga''',{{sfn| Soengas|2009|pp=187-188}} who inhabitant the rainforest between [[Cameroon]] and the [[Great Lake]] region of the [[Congo Basin]] in [[Central Africa]]. Since the 1930s, the Bakoya, in particular, have settled in [[Gabon]] in the [[Ogooue-Ivindo Province]],{{sfn| Soengas|2009|pp=187-188}} in the northeastern region of the country.{{sfn|Wessendorf|2009|p=532}}
Similar minority groups are the [[Babongo]] and the [[Baka people (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]] pygmies. Before they adapted to the agricultural practices in the new settlements in Gabon along the flanks of the road, Bakoya were “semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers” like the other forest-dwelling pygmies; they resided in small huts.{{sfn| Soengas|2009|pp=187-188}} The word 'Pygmee' is a [[French language|French]] coinage, adopted by the Gabonese. They are the earliest inhabitants of the forest and are nomadic hunter gatherers.{{sfn|Ichikawa|Kimura|2003|p=85}}

==Location==
Pygmies living in the [[Imbong]] village are specifically known as Bakoya. They are situated in the Ogooue-Ivindo Province, which is one of the nine [[provinces of Gabon]]. They are settled along the Mékambo to Mazingo (Canton Djoua) road and (Canton Djoua), and from Mékambo to Ekata (Canton Loué) road in the [[Zadié Department]].{{sfn| Soengas|2009|pp=187-188}}

==History==
Following the many internecine wars among the tribal groups of the region, the Bakoya, who were living  on the banks of the [[Ogooué River]] migrated along with the non-pygmy group of Bongom to an upstream region of the [[Ivindo River|Ivindo]] and [[Zadié River]]s.{{sfn| Soengas|2009|pp=187-188}} According to the oral traditions of the Bakoya, during their travel through the forests they accompanied the Bongom, a non-pygmie tribe. While the Bongom moved out of the forests and established themselves on the Mékambo-Mazingo Road by setting up the villages of Ego, Grand Itumbi, Ngunangu and Ibea, the Bakoya had stayed back in the forest to harvest their crops of ''u.panda'' (''[[Panda oleosa]]'') and did not move to the Mékambo-Mazingo Road immediately.{{sfn| Soengas|2009|pp=187-188}} At this time the French who had colonized Gabon also created better living facilities.{{sfn| Soengas|2009|pp=187-188}}

The Bakoya, Baka and Babongo are three minorities groups of Gabon who are known as the “Pygmies of Gabon” (said to be the first people to inhabit the forests of Gabon) and they form a very small minority of a few thousand people only.{{sfn|Warne|2003|p=7}} All of them have left behind their hunter-gatherer vocation to more "sedentary" modern way of life. Their skills of hunting game with “bow and poisoned arrows, game traps and harpoons” are however much more skillful than the majority population of the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] community in the country.{{sfn|Warne|2003|p=7}} But their lot is subject to humiliation at the hands of the Bantus. However, in recent years there is an effort to project their history as a matter of tourism interest and their culture has been brought forth in the form of exhibitions, lectures and discussions. One such initiative was taken in 2002 when an exhibition was organized to project the history of pygmies and their culture.{{sfn|Warne|2003|p=7}}

The government of Gabon recognized the ''Minorités Autochtones Pygmées au Gabon'' (MINAPYGA; the Indigenous Pygmy Minorities of Gabon) organization of Bokayo in 1997, which is one of three such indigenous organizations in the country; the other two recognized groups are the ''Edzendgui'' and the ''Association pour le Developpement de la Culture des Peuples Pygmees du Gabon''.{{sfn|Stidsen|2006|p=483}}

==Notable people==
Leonard Odambo is one of the few well educated Bokayo who is a qualified journalist and head of an NGO in [[Libreville]].{{sfn|Ichikawa|Kimura|2003|p=115}}

'''Bungan Bugti''' ({{lang-ur|بنگان بگٹی}}) was a [[Baloch people|Baloch]] politician from [[Sui (Balochistan)|Sui]], [[Dera Bugti District]], [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], [[Pakistan]]. Bungan Bugti was former ally of [[Akbar Bugti|Nawab Akbar Shahbaz Khan Bugti]]. Bungan Bugti was killed on 2007 by a bomb blast. It has been reported that the militants of [[Balochistan Liberation Army]] carried out the attack.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15669">'''Co-regulation''' (or coregulation) is a term used in psychology, defined most broadly as a "continuous unfolding of individual action that is susceptible to being continuously modified by the continuously changing actions of the partner". An important aspect of this idea is that co-regulation cannot be reduced down to the behaviors or experiences of the individuals involved in the interaction.&lt;ref name = butler&gt;Butler, E. A., &amp; Randall, A. K. (2013). Emotional Coregulation in Close Relationships. Emotion Review, 5(2), 202–210. http://doi.org/10.1177/1754073912451630&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction is a result of each participant repeatedly regulating the behavior of the other. It is a continuous and dynamic process, rather than the exchange of discrete information.&lt;ref&gt;Fogel, A., &amp; Garvey, A. (2007). Alive communication. Infant Behavior and Development, 30(2), 251–257. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.infbeh.2007.02.007&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-regulation is often applied in the context of emotions. In this sense, the emotions of each individual within a [[Dyad (sociology)|dyad]] are constantly in flux, depending on the emotions and behaviors of the partner. If emotion co-regulation is in effect, the result will be a decrease in overall emotional distress. A working definition of emotion co-regulation has been offered as "a bidirectional linkage of oscillating emotional channels between partners, which contributes to emotional stability for both partners".&lt;ref name=butler/&gt; Emotion co-regulation is thoroughly studied in the context of early emotional development, often between infants and caregivers. It has also been studied in adult interpersonal interactions, with an emphasis on close, romantic relationships. One important note regarding co-regulation is that there may be an imbalance within the [[Dyad (sociology)|dyad]], such that one member is more actively regulating the behavior of the other.

The following is an example of co-regulation between a mother and her infant, from ''Emotional Development: The Organization of Emotional Life in the Early Years''. This scenario exemplifies a mother maintaining her infant's engagement via variations in her voice, facial expressions, and body language. She sensitively elicits behaviors from the infant and adds more stimulation when appropriate. Likewise, the infant indicates and maintains the mutual engagement with her own facial expressions, vocalizations, and body language.
{{Quote|Hello there pumpkin ... Mommy's comin' to get you. Yes, she is. [Brief pause.] Momma's gonna get you and tickle you. What do you think of that? [Brief pause.] Come on. Come on, you little sweetie. Let me see that smile. Humm? [Pause.] Yeah, that's right ... thaaaat's right. [The infant exhibits a big smile with bobbing head, and mother responds in kind, then says,] Oh, well now, are you gonna say somethin'? Are ya? [Pause, mother nodding head, widening eyes.] Come on! [Pause.] Come on! [The baby begins cycling movements of the arms and kicking the feet.] Come on. [Drawn out, then longer pause.] Yeah! [as the baby bursts forth with a gurgling sound, the caregiver then laughs and hugs the baby]."&lt;ref name = sroufe/&gt;}}

==Proposed criteria==

Despite a history of studies on co-regulation, researchers have lacked a clear, operational definition of co-regulation. In a review of emotional co-regulation in close relationships, Butler and Randall proposed the following three criteria for determining the presence of co-regulation:&lt;ref name = butler/&gt;
#Bidirectional linkage of emotional channels:
#:Both partners' emotions will influence each other in a recursive pattern of mutual regulation. Critically, this effect will be supported by statistical tests for dependence.
#Morphostatic oscillating emotional channels:
#:The level of emotional arousal within each member will stay within the range of stable, comfortable arousal (mildly negative to fairly positive). If the dyad becomes too emotionally aroused without a subsequent return to emotional calm, this would be a failure to co-regulate. Morphostatic oscillation is in contrast to morphogenic oscillation, which results in an elevated emotional state for one or both partners. Examples of morphogenic oscillation includes emotion contagion, transmission, and negative reciprocity during conflicts. 
#Co-regulation will contribute to emotional and physiological [[allostasis]] for both partners.
#:A close relationship partner (e.g., caregiver, spouse) will be sensitive to one's emotional distress, and mere proximity to that partner will automatically lead to reductions in distress. In contrast, proximity to a stranger when faced with a stressor may also lead to reductions in distress, but it will not manifest in a bidirectional pattern.

==Across the lifespan==

===In childhood===

Co-regulation has been identified as a critical precursor for [[emotional self-regulation]]. Infants have instinctive regulatory behaviors, such as gaze redirection, body re-positioning, self-soothing, distraction, problem solving, and venting,&lt;ref&gt;Leerkes, E. M., &amp; Wong, M. S. (2012). Infant Distress and Regulatory Behaviors Vary as a Function of Attachment Security Regardless of Emotion Context and Maternal Involvement. Infancy, 17(5), 455–478. http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00099.x&lt;/ref&gt; but the most effective way for an infant to regulate distress is to seek out help from a caregiver. Sensitive, reliable responses by the caregiver, over time, indicate to the infant that emotional distress is manageable, either with the help of a caregiver, or by strategies developed during past interactions with a caregiver. The strongest theoretical and empirical support for this phenomenon comes from research on [[attachment theory]].&lt;ref name = bowlby&gt;Bowlby, J. (1969/1982). Attachment and loss (Vol 1), 2nd ed. New York: Basic.&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment has even been explicitly defined as "the dyadic regulation of emotion".&lt;ref name=sroufe&gt;Sroufe, L. A. (1997). Emotional development: The organization of emotional life in the early years. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic premise is that early biological and behavioral co-regulation from the caregiver facilitates the child's development of secure attachment which then promotes self-regulation. Drawing from [[John Bowlby]]'s theory of "internal working models", young children develop mental representations of the caregiving relationship, as well as relationships more generally, through repeated interactions with the caregiver. Sensitive and consistent caregiving promotes the development of the expectation that emotional arousal is manageable via eliciting the support of the caregiver (or others) and/or with independent coping. Alternatively, Bowlby hypothesized that infants who experience insensitive and inconsistent caregiving are likely to develop the expectation that emotional needs will not be met by others or the self.&lt;ref name = bowlby/&gt; Furthermore, in studies testing the statistical dependencies between parent and infant behaviors, researchers have found support for contingencies of eye gaze, facial expressions, prosody, speech rhythms, attention, and physiological arousal.&lt;ref&gt;Field, T. (1985). Attachment as psychobiological attunement: Being on the same wavelength. In M. Reite &amp; T. Field (Eds.), The psychobiology of attachment and separation (pp. 415–454). Orlando, FL: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In infancy, co-regulation is primarily initiated and maintained by the caregiver, such that the caregiver is putting forth effort to soothe the child's emotional distress. Caregiver responses are calibrated to closely fit infant responses and elicit the next behavior. This effect has been called "caregiver-guided dyadic regulation".&lt;ref name = sroufe/&gt; Co-regulatory interactions between parents and children become more balanced over time, as children develop emotion regulation strategies of their own. Caregivers of preschoolers, for example, take a more passive co-regulating role. They demonstrate willingness to assist with distress and availability when needed, but not over-involvement. Instead of more actively co-regulating, these parents are more likely than parents of younger children to give their children space to independently regulate, suggest regulation strategies, or facilitate more abstract discussions regarding emotional experiences and appropriate responses.&lt;ref&gt;Blandon, A. Y., Calkins, S. D., Keane, S. P., &amp; O'Brien, M. (2008). Individual differences in trajectories of emotion regulation processes: The effects of maternal depressive symptomatology and children's physiological regulation. Developmental Psychology, 44(4), 1110–1123. http://doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.44.4.1110&lt;/ref&gt;

===In adulthood===
Co-regulation has also been examined in the context of close adult relationships, though less so than in the parent-child context. Research studies conducted thus far provide preliminary support for the phenomenon. Similar to the evidence for co-regulation in childhood, this literature is often rooted in the [[Attachment Theory|attachment]] framework. As such, it works from the hypothesis that early experiences of co-regulation are internalized and guide expectations about and behavior within future close relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Sroufe, L. A., &amp; Fleeson, J. (1986). Attachment and the construction of relationships. In W. Hartup &amp; Z. Rubin (Eds), Relationships in development. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; There, however, are several points of divergence between the child and adult literature on co-regulation. First, co-regulation in adult relationships is defined by reciprocity between partners, such that the responsibility to regulate the other is more or less equally split. Second, research on adult co-regulation is more likely to incorporate physiological measures. Indeed, physiological substrates involved in reward systems (e.g., oxytocin, opioids), are strongly activated by sexual contact, which is an added mechanism through which adults co-regulate. Third, animal models are commonly utilized in studies of co-regulation within adult dyads.&lt;ref&gt;Sbarra, D. A., &amp; Hazan, C. (2008). Coregulation, Dysregulation, Self-Regulation: An Integrative Analysis and Empirical Agenda for Understanding Adult Attachment, Separation, Loss, and Recovery. Personality and Social Psychology Review, 12(2), 141–167. http://doi.org/10.1177/1088868308315702&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these differences, research findings on adult co-regulation thus far seem to extend the parent-child co-regulation findings. So far, researchers have evidence that adult partners' emotions oscillate in a coordinated pattern&lt;ref&gt;Butner, J., Diamond, L. M., &amp; Hicks, A. M. (2007). Attachment style and two forms of affect coregulation between romantic partners. Personal Relationships, 14, 431–455.&lt;/ref&gt; and that presence of one's spouse leads to stress reduction, and even more so for individuals in reportedly high quality marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Coan, J. A., Schaefer, H. S., &amp; Davidson, R. J. (2006). Lending a hand: Social regulation of the neural response to threat. Psychological Science, 17, 1032–1039&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indicators==

===Behavioral===
Examples of co-regulating parent behaviors/caregiver-guided dyadic regulation:&lt;ref name = gulsrud&gt;Gulsrud, A. C., Jahromi, L. B., &amp; Kasari, C. (2009). The Co-Regulation of Emotions Between Mothers and their Children with Autism. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 40(2), 227–237. http://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-009-0861-x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grolnick, W. S., Kurowski, C. O., McMenamy, J. M., Rivkin, I., &amp; Bridges, L. J. (1998). Mothers' strategies for regulating their toddlers' distress. Infant Behavior and Development, 21(3), 437–450. http://doi.org/10.1016/S0163-6383(98)90018-2&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prompting/helping: Mother physically or vocally prompts and scaffolds child (e.g., physical prompting with toy if child becomes frustrated) 
* Following the child's lead: Mother is sensitive to child's interests and follows the child to his/her desired toy/activity (e.g., Mom may appear to wait for child to choose a toy and then insert herself into interaction) 
* Redirection of attention: Mother distracts the child or directs the child's attention away from negative stimulus (e.g., pointing out other toys in room) 
* Active ignoring: Mother actively ignores child during distress episodes (e.g., mom may continue to play with a toy or purposely turn away from child) 
* Reassurance: Mother reassures or encourages child surrounding frustrating or negative activity (e.g., ''It's okay. You can do it!'') 
* Emotional following: Mother's reflection, extension or elaboration upon child's distress or preoccupation (e.g., ''I know you want the toy'') 
* Physical comfort: Mother initiates behaviors to comfort child (e.g., hugging, kissing, picking up the child, rocking) 
* Vocal comfort: Mother initiates vocalizations to comfort the child (e.g., sshhing, singing, sing-song voice)

===Biological===
Inclusion of physiological measurements of co-regulation is a relatively recent innovation in the psychological research. The underlying premise is that, similar to observable indicators of co-regulation, co-regulating partners' physiology will be bidirectionally linked and subsequently stabilized. Some of these biological measures may be more effective research tools than others. More rapidly fluctuating indices, such as autonomic responses, for example, are proposed to be more temporally sensitive measures of biological co-regulation.&lt;ref name = butler/&gt;
* Activity of the [[autonomic nervous system]]
* [[Cortisol]]
* [[Oxytocin]]
* [[Vagal tone]]

==In autism spectrum disorder (ASD)==
{{main article|Autism spectrum}}
As co-regulation is contingent on reciprocal relationships between members of a dyad, it can be compromised by risk factors within the individuals. As such, a newer line of research has identified children on the [[autism spectrum]] as a risk group for disruptions in co-regulation in their parent-child dyads. In the [[DSM-5]], the first diagnostic criterion of ASD is "Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts"&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5®). American Psychiatric Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, disruptions with co-regulation are inherent in the disorder, in that individuals with ASD exhibit difficulties in social-emotional reciprocity and sharing of emotions. Although only a handful of studies have directly examined co-regulation in parent-child with ASD dyads, converging evidence has demonstrated that parents' immediate responses to emotional distress facilitates self-regulation for children with ASD.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschler-Guttenberg, Y., Feldman, R., Ostfeld-Etzion, S., Laor, N., &amp; Golan, O. (2015). Self- and Co-regulation of Anger and Fear in Preschoolers with Autism Spectrum Disorders: The Role of Maternal Parenting Style and Temperament. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 45(9), 3004–3014. http://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-015-2464-z&lt;/ref&gt; One particularly interesting finding was that, while mothers of typically developing children transition to more passive co-regulation over toddlerhood, as their children become more independent self-regulators, mothers of children with ASD continued to use active co-regulation strategies throughout the duration of the study. The authors conjectured that this continuation was a reflection of the mothers' sensitivity to their children's heightened developmental needs.&lt;ref name = gulsrud/&gt;

'''Croats in Germany''' ({{lang-de|Kroaten in Deutschland}}; {{lang-hr|Hrvati u Njemačkoj}}) refers to persons living in [[Germany]] who have total or partial [[Croat|Croatian ancestry]]. They form the 6th largest [[Ethnic groups in Germany|ethnic minority]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160113143335/https://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/DE/Publikationen/Broschueren/bundesamt-in-zahlen-2014.pdf?__blob=publicationFile ]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, there were 270,528 Croats holding Croatian citizenship and living in Germany.  [[Croatia]]'s State Office for the Croats Abroad, Croatian embassy in Berlin and Croatian Catholic Missions estimated that there are more than 350,000 Croats and their descendants living in Germany.&lt;ref name="hrvatiizvanrh1"/&gt;

== Demographics ==
According to the German Federal Statistical Office of Wiesbaden in 2007, there were 225,309 Croatian citizens living in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;German Federal Statistical Office, http://www.destatis.de/&lt;/ref&gt; According to data from church institutions there are about 310,000 to 350,000 Croatians living in Germany.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4922">This article presents the '''Demographic history of Slovenia''', with census results where available. See [[Demographics of Slovenia]] for a more detailed overview of the current demographics from 2002 census.

==Pre WWII==
There are censuses for the years 1830, 1857, and 1869. Population censuses were then carried out every ten years, in 1880, 1890, 1900, 1910, 1921, and 1931.[https://wiki.familysearch.org/en/Slovenia_Census]

===1830===
Slovenia was divided between the Austrian regions of [[Carniola]], [[Austrian Littoral]], [[Styria]] and [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], not counting the Hungarian-owned Prekmurje region. In Styria, there were 342,013 Slovenians, or 38.72% of the population   [http://www.theslovenian.com/articles/klemencic.htm].

===Second half of 19th century===
As a result of the rise of German nationalism, which entailed germanizing school networks, economic coercion, and language shift for economic or social reasons, the number of Slovenians in Slovenia went from 96% in 1846, 85.5% in 1880, 84.6% in 1890 and 87.3% in 1900 to 81.7% in 1910. These developments were particularly visible in southern Carinthia, today mostly a part of [[Austria]], largely due to the developing tourist industry on the lakes of the Klagenfurt basin. Similar developments took place in the Prekmurje region, which was then a part of Royal Hungary, with Hungarian replacing German as the prestigious language.

==1910==
Data shows the following results... [http://www.theslovenian.com/articles/2008/zupancic.pdf]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6261">'''The Ed Block Courage Award''' is an annual award presented to selected players in the [[National Football League]] (NFL), who are voted for by their teammates as role models of inspiration, sportsmanship, and courage.&lt;ref name=Sun29&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Jill|title=Flags down over Block award to Eagles' Vick|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=December 29, 2009|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Named in memory of Ed Block, a well-liked humanitarian and trainer for the [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]], the award is administered by the '''Ed Block Courage Award Foundation'''. Sponsorship proceeds promote the prevention of [[child abuse]] by raising awareness of the epidemic and assisting agencies who provide for the care and treatment of abused children.

==Purpose and development==
Ed Block was [[Athletic trainer|head athletic trainer]] for the [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]] from 1954 to 1977.&lt;ref name=webbio&gt;{{cite web|title=Who was Ed Block|publisher=Ed Block Courage Award Foundation|url=http://www.edblock.org/content/who-was-ed-block |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had earned a master's degree from the [[University of Missouri]] in 1937 and, following service as an army officer in [[World War II]], a doctorate in rehabilitation and physical therapy from [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=webbio /&gt; Block was also a physical therapist at a [[Baltimore, Maryland]], hospital for disabled children. Following his retirement as Colts' trainer, local community leaders led by Baltimore businessman Sam Lamantia Jr. began an annual award in Block's honor in 1978, recognizing a Colts player for outstanding character.&lt;ref name=webinfo&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Giant Steps|publisher=Ed Block Courage Award Foundation|url=http://www.edblock.org/content/historic-giant-steps |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, the award was expanded when players on other NFL teams began to be similarly recognized. In 1986, the Ed Block Courage Award Foundation was incorporated as a charitable organization with Sam Lamantia Jr. as its CEO.&lt;ref name=Sun29 /&gt;&lt;ref name=webinfo /&gt; The ''Ed Block Courage Award'' has since expanded to all 32&amp;nbsp;NFL teams.

The Baltimore-based foundation's twin objectives are to celebrate players of inspiration in the NFL and to raise public awareness and support prevention of child abuse. Radio public service announcements, along with televised programs, internet, and print media, are used by the foundation in furtherance of its mission.

==Award selection and presentation==
Every year, active players on each of the 32&amp;nbsp;teams in the National Football League vote for one member of their team who, in their eyes, "exemplify commitment to the principles of sportsmanship and courage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vick's name still on list of Block Award recipients|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=December 30, 2009|page=Sports 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those players selected are announced in late December.

Each March, the 32&amp;nbsp;selected players receive their Ed Block Courage Award at a banquet held in Baltimore. Past recipients include [[Sam Hurd]], [[Robbie Gould]], [[Joe Montana]], [[Peyton Manning]], and [[Dan Marino]].&lt;ref name=Sun29 /&gt; The award trophy itself is a pewtered [[football helmet]] with the recipient's team logo and engraved with the player's name, team and year.

=="Courage Houses" and other endeavors==
The foundation has also developed a national network of "Courage Houses" that help abused children in NFL cities. These cities are: Pittsburgh, Chicago, Miami, Detroit, Dallas, Baltimore, New York, Oakland, Seattle, Carolina, Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Buffalo, San Francisco, Green Bay, Tampa Bay, Washington and Philadelphia.

The foundation also sponsors the Baltimore Sports Media Hall of Fame Award and presents the Professional Football [[Athletic training|Athletic Training]] Staff of the Year Award. The Pro Football Weekly Assistant Coach of the Year Award is also presented at the annual Courage Awards Gala.

[[File:Fire Escape Collapse.png|thumb|''Fire Escape Collapse'']]
'''''Fire Escape Collapse''''', also known as '''''Fire on Marlborough Street''''', is a black-and-white photograph by [[Stanley Forman]] which received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography]] in 1976&lt;ref name="pulitzer"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1976| title = 1976 Winners|publisher =Pulitzer.org| accessdate = 27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the title of [[World Press Photo of the Year]].&lt;ref name="wpp"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.archive.worldpressphoto.org/search/layout/result/indeling/detailwpp/form/wpp/q/ishoofdafbeelding/true/trefwoord/year/1975| title =1975, Stanley Forman, World Press Photo of the Year| publisher =World Press Photo| accessdate =27 April 2013| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://archive.is/20120730025118/http://www.archive.worldpressphoto.org/search/layout/result/indeling/detailwpp/form/wpp/q/ishoofdafbeelding/true/trefwoord/year/1975| archivedate =30 July 2012| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photograph, which is part of a series, shows 19-year-old Diana Bryant and her 2-year-old goddaughter Tiare Jones falling from the collapsed [[fire escape]] of a burning apartment building on Marlborough Street in [[Boston]] on July 22, 1975. The fire escape at the fifth floor collapsed as a [[turntable ladder]] on a [[fire engine]] was being extended to pick up the two at the height of approximately 50 feet (15 meters).

The photo was taken with a motorized camera and also shows falling potted plants. Other photos of the series show Bryant and Jones waiting for a turntable ladder and the moment of the fire escape's collapse with both victims on it. Originally published in the ''[[Boston Herald]]'', the photo circulated in over a hundred newspapers and led to the adoption of new [[fire escape]] legislation in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.stanleyformanphotos.com/pulitzer.html| title = The Pulitzer Prize|publisher =Stanley Forman Photos| accessdate = 27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The incident==
The tillerman of the first fire engine to arrive at the scene, Robert O'Neill, asked 19-year-old Bryant to lift her 2-year-old goddaughter Jones to him on the roof, but Bryant was unable to do so and O'Neill jumped down&lt;!--from/to where? how did he get there?--&gt; to help before the ladder could reach them. O'Neill had moved from the fire escape to the ladder just before the fire escape collapsed. Bryant and Jones fell approximately 50 feet (15 meters). Bryant sustained multiple head and body injuries and died hours later. Jones survived the fall as she had landed on Bryant's body, softening the impact.&lt;ref name="wpp" /&gt; A helicopter pilot, Joe Green, who provided traffic reports and landed on a nearby roof, reportedly offered to pick up Bryant and Jones, but got no response from the firefighter.&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/clip/16544184/chicago_tribune/|title=Rescue effort fails|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]| date=July 24, 1975|page=1|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web | url =http://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/clip/16544296/chicago_tribune/|title=Rescue was seconds away|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]| date=July 24, 1975| page=5|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police obtained an arrest warrant for the building's owner, Fred Durham, for trash fires behind the building.&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt; A police complaint charged Durham with keeping an unlicensed lodging house.&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt; Three trash fires behind the building were reported in the weeks preceding the accident.&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt;

==Forman's recollection==
Recalling the accident, Forman said he was about to leave the office of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' when, after a call about a fire, he rushed to the scene, following one of the fire engines.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4245138.stm|title=Picture power: Fire-escape drama |publisher=[[BBC]]| date=30 September 2005| accessdate =20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hearing yelling for a ladder truck, Forman ran to the back of the burning building, where he saw Diana Bryant and Tiare Jones on the fire escape.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Because of the heat of the fire behind, Bryant and Jones were "basically leaning" at the point farthest from the building.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Forman then took a position where he could photograph what he thought was "an impending routine rescue" in his own words.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Following the fire escape collapse, Forman acknowledged: "It dawned on me what was happening and I didn't want to see them hit the ground. I can still remember turning around and shaking". Forman, however, noted he was unable to see the moment Bryant and Jones hit the ground "as they fell behind a fence where the bins were".&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

==Publication and repercussions==
This photograph and others from the incident were originally published in the ''Boston Herald.'' Forman made a set of prints for the [[Associated Press]], which provided worldwide distribution of the photos.&lt;ref name="shu"/&gt; [[Tear sheet]]s on the photos were placed on 128 American newspapers and those in several foreign countries.&lt;ref name="shu"/&gt;

Within twenty-four hours, action was taken in Boston to improve the safety of all fire escapes in the city.&lt;ref name="shu"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://pirate.shu.edu/~mckenndo/ethics%20cases-Revictimization%20Photos.htm|title=Ethics cases|publisher=Department of Communication, Seton Hall University| accessdate =21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fire safety groups used the photos to promote similar efforts in other American cities.&lt;ref name="shu"/&gt;

The '''Garachi''' ({{lang-az|Qaraçı}}; {{lang-ku|Qereçî}}; {{lang-ru|Карачи}}), also spelled '''Karachi''' or '''Karaci''', are a group of the [[Romani people]]{{dubious-inline|date=November 2016}} living in [[Azerbaijan]]. Little research has been done on the Garachi, and most of what is known about them is based on the works of the 19th-century [[Russia]]n scholars [[Kerope Patkanov]] and [[Jean-Marie Chopin]].

It is noteworthy that the term ''Garachi'' is sometimes used to describe the [[Domari]]-speaking people of northern [[Iran]], who were previously thought to be of Romani stock. The confusion is explained by the fact that both groups live in the regions populated mostly by [[Azerbaijani people|Azeri-speakers]] who apply the word ''Garachi'' to all medieval collective migrants from the [[Indian subcontinent]], including the Dom. For information on the Dom of Iran, see the article under [[Dom people]].

==Origins and history==
Even though the Garachi of Azerbaijan call themselves ''Dom'' (the name ''Garachi'' was given to them by the local population and derives from the [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]] word ''qara'' - "black" and the suffix ''-çı'' denoting the stem-word's function/occupation), they do not seem to share same origins with the Dom people. According to Jean-Marie Chopin, the Azerbaijani Garachi descend from the medieval Romani nomads of [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Chopin, Jean-Marie. New Articles on the Ancient History of the Caucasus and Its Inhabitants. St Petersburg, 1896&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, [[Vasily Yan]] suggested that the Garachi of Azerbaijan and the Dom of Iran (sometimes referred to as the Garachi) differ in terms of their origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://artofwar.ru/a/afgan/text_0570.shtml Turkestan Campaigns] by Vasily Yan&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, Kerope Patkanov stated that the Garachi of the [[South Caucasus]] (then part of the [[Russian Empire]]) numbered 2,399 people living mostly in the Goychay uyezd (present-day [[Goychay Rayon|Goychay]], [[Ujar Rayon|Ujar]], [[Agsu Rayon|Agsu]], and [[Ismayilli]] rayons of Azerbaijan) and [[Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhichevan]]. The largest Garachi settlement was named after them and is situated around 4&amp;nbsp;km southeast of Khacmaz town in [[Khachmaz Rayon|Khachmaz]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Patkanov, Kerope. ''Gypsies: Several Words on the Dialects of the Transcaucasian Gypsies, the Bosha and the Karachi''. St. Petersburg, 1887&lt;/ref&gt;

Their main occupation was the production of household items such as baskets, sieves and chewing gum made by men and sold by women in the neighbouring towns. Among other sources of income Patkanov lists [[fortune-telling]] and cattle [[larceny]]. Nomadic Garachi groups used to train animals and make street song-and-dance performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://advocat-ua-ru-md.pisem.net/Gipsys.htm Gypsies and Crime] by Oleg Kucheriavy&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was described in the famous 1913 story ''Garaja giz'' by the Azeri writer [[Suleyman Sani Akhundov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{az icon}} [http://azeri.org/Azeri/az_latin/latin_lit/az_literature/short_stories/akhundov_suleyman/akhundov_az/garaja_giz%20.pdf Qaraca Qiz] by Suleyman Sani Akhundov (full text)&lt;/ref&gt; The Garachi claim to adhere to [[Shia Islam]] but in reality are non-religious for the most part.

==Language==

}}

Patkanov's analysis of the language of the Garachi (based on 101 common phrases) indicated that despite being [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], it is not mutually intelligible with any of the [[Romani language|Romani]] or [[Domari language|Domari]] dialects of the [[Balkans]], [[Russia]], or the [[Middle East]]. In addition to it, the Garachi observed by Patkanov spoke Azeri and sometimes [[Tat language (Caucasus)|Tat]] as a second and third language respectively.

Here are four phrases in Garachi and Romani languages with translation.

'''Greek Sign Language''' ({{lang-el|[[:el:Ελληνική νοηματική γλώσσα|Ελληνική νοηματική γλώσσα]]}}) is the [[sign language]] of the [[Greece|Greek]] [[deaf]] community. It has been [[Legal recognition of sign languages|legally recognised]] as the official language of the Deaf Community in Greece by Law 2817 in 2000.

The Greek Sign Language is estimated to be used by about 40,600 signers in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia''' ('''HILDA''')  [[statistical survey|survey]] is an Australian household-based [[panel study]] which began in 2001. It has been used for examining issues such as the incidence of persistent poverty; assets and income in the transition to retirement; the correlates and impact of changes in physical and mental health; and an international comparison of wealth and happiness. The survey is widely used by Australian and international researchers in the fields of [[economics]], [[social science]] and [[social policy]] and by the [[Australian Government]]. The HILDA survey is managed by a small team from [[the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research]] at the [[University of Melbourne]] and the national fieldwork is carried out by [[ACNielsen]] and [[Roy Morgan Research]]. The survey is funded by the Australian Government through the [[Department of Social Services (Australia)|Department of Social Services]].

HILDA has the following key features: 

*It collects information about [[economic]] and subjective [[quality of life|well-being]], [[labor market|labour market]] dynamics and family dynamics. 
*Special questionnaire modules are included each wave and have covered topics such as [[wealth]], [[retirement]] and [[fertility]] intentions. 
*The wave 1 panel consisted of 7,682 [[households]] and 19,914 individuals. In wave 11 this was topped up with an additional 2,153 households and 5,477 individuals
*Interviews are conducted annually with all adult members of each household. Children are interviewed once they turn 15.
*The panel members are followed over time. 
*Funding has been guaranteed for 18 waves, and the survey is expected to continue beyond wave 18.
*Data releases occur at the start of December. The release in December 2017 was for data collected from 2001 (wave 1) to 2016 (wave 16).

HILDA data, when weighted, describe the Australian population (excluding those not living in households). The datasets ([[PSPP]]/[[SPSS]], [[SAS (software)|SAS]] and [[Stata]] files) are available for legitimate research purposes and application can be made from the HILDA website. The data are confidentialised by suppression of geographic and other identifying information. A bibliography of published research, the survey [[methodology]], the [[questionnaires]] and a user manual are available from the HILDA website.

HILDA data are integrated into the [[Cross-National Equivalent File]] (CNEF) which contains population panel data from Australia, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Korea, Switzerland, Russia and the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5782">[[Latvia]] is a source and destination country for men and women [[human trafficking|trafficked]] for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and [[forced labor]]. [[Latvian people|Latvian]] women are trafficked to [[Cyprus]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Spain]], and the [[United Kingdom]] for [[commercial sexual exploitation]]. Latvian women and teenage girls are also trafficked within the country for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation. Men and women from Latvia are trafficked to the United Kingdom for the purpose of forced labor. In addition, Latvia may be a destination country for victims trafficked from [[Thailand]] for the purpose of forced labor.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Latvia". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2008/105388.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2008'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 4, 2008). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Latvia]] does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government continued steps to improve victim assistance by increasing access to government funded protections. The government also demonstrated increased efforts to investigate forced labor offenses. It also made modest prevention efforts by taking initial steps to combat [[sex tourism]] committed by foreign visitors to Latvia.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 2 Watchlist"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The Government of Latvia demonstrated sufficient law enforcement efforts during the reporting period. Latvia prohibits all forms of trafficking through Section 154-1 and 154-2 of its Criminal Code, which prescribes penalties of three to 15 years’ imprisonment. These prescribed penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other grave crimes, such as rape. Latvia also uses non-trafficking-related laws to prosecute traffickers. Police performed 12 trafficking investigations under section 165-1, compared to 22 reported last year, and an additional 14 investigations under other sections—including nine investigations under section 154-1 involving alleged sex trafficking and two investigations involving alleged forced labor. Authorities prosecuted and convicted 21 traffickers under section 165-1, a decrease from 36 reported last year. The government also prosecuted and convicted an additional 15 traffickers under other sections of the law including seven under section 154-1, compared to none in 2006. At least five of the convicted traffickers served time in prison. During the reporting period, two traffickers were sentenced to five to 10 years’ imprisonment, two traffickers were sentenced to three to five years’ imprisonment, and one trafficker was sentenced to one to three years’ imprisonment. At the time of this report, the government was investigating the two cases of potential labor trafficking; however, to date, no one has been prosecuted, convicted, or sentenced for forced labor trafficking.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
The government made some efforts to improve victim protection. The Ministry of Welfare provided $14,500 for the training of 271 social workers to improve the administration of victim assistance and rehabilitation services. Although the government allocated $98,000 for victim assistance in 2007, it spent only $23,000 – an increase from $10,000 spent in 2006. The government offers foreign victims legal alternatives to removal; victims who agree to assist law enforcement may apply for [[temporary residency]] and work permits. In 2007, one trafficking victim received a temporary residency permit. Latvia encouraged victims to participate in investigations against their traffickers. In June 2007, the government instituted a 30-day “reflection period” during which non-Latvian victims and their dependent children are eligible for government-funded assistance and rehabilitation services while deciding whether to cooperate with law enforcement. Government authorities and two [[NGO]]s may authorize victims to obtain government assistance; during the reporting period, 12 out of 27 identified victims qualified for and received government- funded assistance. The remaining 15 victims received assistance from non-government-funded NGOs. The government continued to provide training to law enforcement officers and specialists in orphan courts to identify victims of trafficking; however, the government referred 13 victims total to NGOs for assistance in 2007. The government did not penalize victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being trafficked.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
Latvia demonstrated modest efforts to prevent trafficking in persons during the reporting period. The Ministry of Family and Children’s Affairs continued to train professionals in contact with vulnerable populations to advise potential victims of the dangers of trafficking. The Latvian government reported no measures to reduce the demand for [[commercial sex acts]].&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

The '''Imperial Crown of Brazil''' ({{lang-pt|Coroa Imperial do Brasil}}), also known as the '''Crown of Dom Pedro II''' or as the '''Diamantine Crown''' (so called because all of its precious stones are diamonds), is the [[Crown (headgear)|Crown]] manufactured for the second Brazilian Emperor, [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]]. 

With the addition of this Crown to the [[Brazilian Imperial Regalia]], use of the previous, simpler Crown of Pedro I was abandoned. The design of the Crown of Dom Pedro II also replaced the design of the older diadem in [[Flag of Brazil|flag]] and [[coat of arms of Brazil|coat of arms]] of the [[Brazilian Empire]], thus making the new Crown the official imperial Crown of the State.

The Crown of Dom [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]] was simpler, having been quickly manufactured in 1822 for the [[Coronation]] of Brazil's first Emperor, just a few months after the declaration of the country's independence. 

When Brazil's second Emperor, Pedro II, was declared of age and preparations for his coronation began, the government saw the need to commission the manufacturing of a new crown.

== Manufacture ==

The Crown of Dom Pedro II was created by the goldsmith Carlos Martin&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.museuimperial.gov.br/portal/circuito-exposicao/301-as-coroas.html Web site of the Imperial Museum], "The crowns".&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Rio de Janeiro]], and was first exhibited to the public on July 8, 1841, just days before the new monarch's Coronation that took place on July 18 of the same year.

The Crown's frame is made of quality 18 carat [[gold]]. Its [[circlet]] base supports eight imperial semi-arches, connected at the top by a golden [[monde (crown)|monde]], which in turn is surmounted by a jeweled [[cross (crown)|cross]], forming a [[globus cruciger]]. Inside the [[half-arch (crown)|half-arches]] lies a dark-green [[cap (crown)|velvet cap]] (matching the dark green colour of the top surface of the Emperor's robe). The Crown is set with 639 precious stones (all [[diamond]]s), and 77 [[pearl]]s of 8 millimeters each.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Rio/0,,MUL17627-5606,00.html G1 &gt; Edição Rio de Janeiro - NOTÍCIAS - Coroa Imperial é a original, afirma perita&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  

This Crown weighs 1,9 kilograms,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; has a diameter of 205 millimeters and is 31 centimeters high. It is considered one of the most splendid works of Brazilian jewelry.

== Usage ==

Pedro II na abertura da Assembléia Geral.jpg|thumb|Emperor Pedro II, wearing several elements of the regalia, and crowned with the Imperial Crown of Brazil, here portrayed arriving to deliver the Speech from the Throne in the opening of the annual session of the Brazilian Imperial Parliament (General Assembly) in 1872.

[[Image:Presidente Getúlio Vargas visita o Museu Imperial após a sua inauguração.tif|thumb|President [[Getúlio Vargas]] looking at the Imperial Crown during the opening of the [[Imperial Museum of Brazil|Imperial Museum]] on March 16, 1943]]

Aside from the [[Coronation Mass]], it was customary for Brazilian Emperors to wear their crowns only twice a year, for the ceremonies of opening and closing the session of the [[National Congress of Brazil|Brazilian Imperial Parliament]], when the Emperor appeared in full [[regalia]] to deliver his [[Speech from the Throne]].

Upon the abolition of the monarchy in 1889, the government of the newly proclaimed republic took possession of all items of the Imperial Regalia, but, unlike what happened upon the abolition of other monarchies, no item of the [[Imperial Regalia of Brazil|Crown Jewels]] was sold or destroyed. Since 1943, the Imperial Crown of Brazil and all other items of the regalia have been kept on permanent public exhibition at the Imperial Palace in the City of [[Petrópolis]], now converted to the [[Imperial Museum of Brazil]].

Before the inauguration of the Imperial Museum in 1943, the Imperial Crown and other items of the Brazilian Crown Jewels were kept under lock and key in possession of the Department of the Treasury.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

The Imperial Crown is the property of the Brazilian State.

==Replica==

In the first years of the 21st century, Brazilian Jewellers ''Amsterdam Sauer'' created a replica of the original Imperial Crown of D. Pedro II. The creation of the replica, using 19th century techniques not employed nowadays, took 18 months. The replica is on display at Amsterdam Sauer's Museum of Gemstones and Rare Minerals in Ipanema, Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amsterdamsauer.com/about/?/imperial+crown+replica.htm Amsterdam Sauer - The Source of quality precious stones and fine gemstone jewelry from Brazil&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512201816/http://www.amsterdamsauer.com/about/?%2Fimperial%20crown%20replica.htm |date=2013-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The replica is heavier and larger than the original Crown. It weights 2,77 kilograms and is set with 596 stones totaling 911.84 carats.

'''''In Dubious Battle''''' is a novel by [[John Steinbeck]], written in 1936. The central figure of the story is an activist attempting to organize abused laborers in order to gain fair wages and working conditions.

Prior to publication, Steinbeck wrote in a letter:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is the first time I have felt that I could take the time to write and also that I had anything to say to anything except my manuscript book. You remember that I had an idea that I was going to write the autobiography of a Communist ... There lay the trouble. I had planned to write a journalistic account of a strike. But as I thought of it as fiction the thing got bigger and bigger. It couldn't be that. I've been living with this thing for some time now. I don't know how much I have got over, but I have used a small strike in an orchard valley as the symbol of man's eternal, bitter warfare with himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cla.calpoly.edu/~dkann/ENGL%20511/week7.htm|title=Course notes from a Cal Poly English course|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512214709/http://cla.calpoly.edu/~dkann/ENGL%20511/week7.htm|archivedate= May 12, 2015|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Explanation of the novel's title==
The title is a reference to a passage from [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Innumerable force of Spirits armed,&lt;br/&gt;
That durst dislike his reign, and, me preferring,&lt;br/&gt;
His utmost power with adverse power opposed&lt;br/&gt;
'''In dubious battle''' on the plains of Heaven&lt;br/&gt;
And shook his throne. What though the field be lost?&lt;br/&gt;
All is not lost—the unconquerable will,&lt;br/&gt;
And study of revenge, immortal hate,&lt;br/&gt;
And courage never to submit or yield:&lt;br/&gt;
And what is else not to be overcome?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ed Stephan|url=http://www.edstephan.org/Steinbeck/dubious.html|title=Steinbeck's ''In Dubious Battle''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Literary significance and criticism==
On publication, ''New York Times'' reviewer Fred T. March compared it to the "genial gusto" of the "picaresque" ''[[Tortilla Flat]]''. He commented that "You would never know that ''In Dubious Battle'' was by the same John Steinbeck if the publishers did not tell you so." He called it "courageous and desperately honest,"  "the best labor and strike novel to come out of our contemporary economic and social unrest," and "such a novel as [[Sinclair Lewis]] at his best might have done had he gone on with his projected labor novel..."

In 1943, with Steinbeck now famous, [[Carlos Baker]] "revalued" the novel. He opened by saying "Among Steinbeck's best novels, the least known is probably ''In Dubious Battle.''" Steinbeck, he said, "is supremely interested in what happens to men's minds and hearts when they function, not as responsible, self-governing individuals, but as members of a group.... Biologists have a word for this very important problem; they call it [[bionomics]], or ecology." He said that "Steinbeck's bionomic interest is visible in all that he has done, from ''Tortilla Flat'', in the middle Thirties, through his semi-biological ''Sea of Cortez,'' to his latest communiqués as a war correspondent in England." He characterized ''In Dubious Battle'' as "an attempt to study a typical mid-depression strike in bionomic terms."

In 1958, critic [[Alfred Kazin]] referred to ''In Dubious Battle'' and ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' as "his most powerful books," contrasting them with ''[[Cannery Row (novel)|Cannery Row]]'' and ''[[The Wayward Bus]]''.  President [[Barack Obama]] told the ''New York Times'' that it was his favorite book by Steinbeck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barack Obama's Favorite Books|url=http://www.abebooks.com/books/barack-obama-favorite-books.shtml|website=AbeBooks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel likely recounts a fruit worker strike that occurred in [[Tulare County]], California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''In Dubious Battle'': Setting|url=http://as.sjsu.edu/steinbeck/teaching_steinbeck/index.jsp?val=teaching_in_dubious_battle_setting|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103180310/http://as.sjsu.edu/steinbeck/teaching_steinbeck/index.jsp?val=teaching_in_dubious_battle_setting|archivedate=November 3, 2013|deadurl=yes|work= Martha Heasly Cox Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''incarceration of Daniel Chong''' was an incident in April 2012 in [[San Diego, California]], when agents from the U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) purposefully left a detained student locked in a holding room and forgot he was there. The cell contained no food, water or bathroom facilities.&lt;ref name = "MSNBC"&gt;[http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/05/04/11527375-students-ordeal-how-was-daniel-chong-lost-in-dea-detention?lite "Student's ordeal: How was Daniel Chong lost in DEA detention?"], MSNBC, May 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later when he was found, he had to be hospitalized for several days for a variety of medical problems. The incident touched off a national furor, resulting in several investigations and a $20 million claim filed against the DEA. The incident has been described as a "[[Kafkaesque]] nightmare,"&lt;ref name = "NYT" /&gt; a "debacle," and "one of the worst cases of its kind."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Julie, and Freking, Kevin, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2012/05/01/national/a215603D99.DTL&amp;tsp=1 "Federal lawmaker: DEA debacle suggests breakdown"], San Francisco Chronicle, May 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
At the time of the incident Daniel Chong was a 23-year-old&lt;ref name = "letter" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "LAT" /&gt; student at the [[University of California, San Diego]], a senior majoring in engineering, who is originally from [[Cerritos, CA|Cerritos]] in [[Los Angeles County]]. On April 20, 2012, he was at a friend's apartment in the [[University City, San Diego|University City]] neighborhood of [[San Diego]], where he and his friends were celebrating the [[420 (cannabis culture)|4/20]] holiday, a day that refers to cannabis usage.&lt;ref name = "NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/03/us/daniel-chong-left-for-days-in-holding-cell.html "California Man’s ‘Drug Holiday’ Becomes Four-Day Nightmare in Holding Cell"], New York Times, May 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='msnnowmay2'&gt;{{cite news | title = Man resorts to drinking urine after being forgotten in jail | date = May 2, 2012 | url = http://now.msn.com/now/0502-detained-student-suicide.aspx | work = MSN | accessdate = 2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apartment was raided early on the morning of April 21 by the DEA, which seized [[marijuana]], [[Psilocybin mushroom|hallucinogenic mushrooms]], and 18,000 [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy pill]]s, along with guns and ammunition. Chong and eight other people were transported to the DEA field office in the [[Kearny Mesa, San Diego|Kearny Mesa]] neighborhood of San Diego, where they were interrogated.

Seven of the nine detainees were then taken to county jail, one was released, and Chong was accidentally left in a holding cell at the DEA office, according to the DEA.&lt;ref name = "UT" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Man-Detained-Four-Days-at-San-Diego-DEA-Office-149427965.html|title=Detainee Forgotten at DEA Office: Law Enforcement Source|author=Monica Garske|publisher=NBC San Diego|date=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2012/may/02/san-diego-man-forgotten-cell-says-he-drank-urine/|title=San Diego Man Forgotten In Cell Says He Drank Urine|date=2012-05-02|publisher=KBPS}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chong says he was told that he had been in the wrong place at the wrong time and that he would be released and even given a ride home.&lt;ref name = "UT"&gt;McDonald, Jeff, [http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/may/01/man-abandoned-dea-cell-steps-forward/ "Man abandoned in DEA cell steps forward"], San Diego Union Tribune, May 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He was placed in a {{convert|5|x|10|ft}} holding cell, his wrists bound in handcuffs. He was then left in the windowless cell for five days despite repeated cries for help. He could hear people walking around outside the room but could not get their attention. At one point the lights went off for several days. While locked up, he was starving and hallucinating. He claimed that, while incarcerated, he had to drink his own urine for [[Management of dehydration|hydration]], and ingested some [[methamphetamine]] that he found under a blanket inside the cell in order to keep himself awake{{clarify|date=June 2018}}. In an apparent fugue state, he was found to have bitten the lens in his eyeglasses, carved the phrase "sorry mom" in his arm with the shards and swallowed the glass.&lt;ref name='nbcsandiegomay2criesforhelp'&gt;{{cite news | first = Grieco | last = Sarah |author2=Devine, Rory | title = DEA Ignored All My Cries: Student | date = May 2, 2012 | url = http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/daniel-chong-ucsd-san-diego-dea-149758275.html | work = NBC San Diego | accessdate = 2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='huffingpostmay2'&gt;{{cite news | first = Andy | last = Campbell | title = Daniel Chong Drank Urine To Survive 5 Days In Holding Cell Without Food, Water | date = May 2, 2012 | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/02/daniel-chong-dea-urine-cell-5-days_n_1470430.html | work = Huffington Post | accessdate = 2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time he was discovered on April 25, he was hallucinating and completely incoherent.&lt;ref name='nbcsandiegomay2criesforhelp'/&gt;&lt;ref name='cnnlawsuitmay2'/&gt;

Upon his discovery on April 25, Chong was taken to [[Sharp Memorial Hospital]] in [[Serra Mesa, San Diego|Serra Mesa]] where he remained for five days, including three in the [[intensive care unit]].&lt;ref name = "LAT"&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/05/uc-san-diego-student-dea-jail-outrage.html "UCSD student's 5-day ordeal in DEA jail sparks outrage, anger"], Los Angeles Times, May 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He was treated for various problems including dehydration, near-failure of his kidneys, and a perforated lung from eating broken glass.&lt;ref name = "UT" /&gt; He was never charged with any crime.&lt;ref name='nbcsandiegomay2criesforhelp'/&gt;

On May 1 he came forward with his story, accompanied by his lawyer, who said he planned to file a claim against the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2139333/Daniel-Chong-sues-20m-forgotten-police-cell-5-days.html?ito=feeds-newsxml "Student who was forced to drink his own urine after being forgotten in police cell for five days sues for $20m"], Daily Mail, May 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==DEA reaction==
On May 2, DEA San Diego acting special agent-in-charge William R. Sherman issued a statement saying "I am deeply troubled by the incident that occurred here last week. I extend my deepest apologies to the young man and want to express that this event is not indicative of the high standards that I hold my employees to. I have personally ordered an extensive review of our policies and procedures."&lt;ref name = "MSNBC" /&gt;

==Other reactions==
Senator [[Barbara Boxer]] (Democrat of California) called for an "immediate and thorough" investigation of the matter by the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]].&lt;ref name = "LAT" /&gt; Representative [[Darrell Issa]] (Republican of California) demanded a congressional investigation.&lt;ref name = "LAT" /&gt; Representative [[Duncan D. Hunter]] (Republican of California) asked the DEA for a full account of the incident as well as a report on detention policies and the steps DEA is taking to address this and any other incidents.&lt;ref name = "letter"&gt;[http://reason.com/assets/db/13361565355701.pdf Letter to DEA from Rep. Duncan Hunter dated May 3, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

San Diego [[NORML]] organized a protest outside the office at 4560 Viewridge Avenue on May 7, at 4:20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the420times.com/2012/05/protest-over-deas-treatment-of-daniel-chong-monday-may-7th/|title=Protest Over DEA’s Treatment Of Daniel Chong – Monday, May 7th|publisher=The 420 Times|date=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student government at UCSD denounced the DEA over the incident and asked UCSD Chancellor [[Marye Anne Fox]] to take a "clear stand" on Chong's treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/05/ucsd-student-government-denounces-dea-for-treatment-of-student.html "Student forgotten in jail: UCSD students denounce treatment"], Los Angeles Times, May 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal action==
Attorneys for Chong filed a $20 million [[Cause of action|claim]] against the Drug Enforcement Administration, claiming that Chong's treatment constituted torture under the law and seeking damages for pain and suffering, future medical and psychiatric treatment, and loss of future earnings.&lt;ref name='cnnlawsuitmay2'&gt;{{cite news | first = Duke | last = Alan | title = Student forgotten in cell for 5 days will sue DEA | date = May 2, 2012 | url = http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/02/us/california-forgotten-prisoner/index.html?hpt=hp_t1 | work = CNN | accessdate = August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='sfgatemay2suit'&gt;{{cite news | first = Watson | last = Julie | title = Student left in cell for 4 days files $20M claim | date = May 2, 2012 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2012/05/01/national/a215603D99.DTL&amp;tsp=1 | work = San Francisco Chronicle | accessdate = 2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jeff |last=McDonald |title=Abandoned DEA detainee seeks $20 million |date=May 2, 2012 |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/may/02/abandoned-dea-detainee-seeks-20-million/ |work=San Diego Union-Tribune |accessdate=August 12, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69s24cRnb?url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/may/02/abandoned-dea-detainee-seeks-20-million/ |archivedate=August 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 30, 2013 it was reported that Chong had settled his claim against the DEA for $4.1 million.&lt;ref name = "settled"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/national/student-left-in-dea-cell-to-get-million-from-us/article_c7263c80-a7a4-5cce-8fa0-c2f88a147b76.html|title=Student left in DEA cell to get $4 million from US|date=July 30, 2013|work=Associated Press, cited by St. Louis Post-Dispatch|accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DEA said it has introduced national detention standards including daily inspections and cameras in cells.&lt;ref name = "settled" /&gt;

==Inspector General's report==
On July 8, 2014, the [[United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General|Office of the Inspector General]] (OIG) of the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] issued a report on this case. The OIG said they intervened in the investigation because it appeared the local DEA office was investigating the matter on its own, contrary to protocol, and because at least two of the local agents who were investigating the case had been involved with Chong and thus had a conflict of interest. Among other findings, the OIG report (issued as an executive summary) said that Chong was seen or heard while trapped in the holding cell by four DEA agents, who did nothing because they assumed someone else was taking care of it. The report also charged that supervisors responded improperly and in a way that compromised any potential criminal prosecutions of agents at fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/jul/09/tp-errors-cited-in-dea-detention-case/|title=Errors cited in DEA detention case|last=McDonald|first=Jeff|date=July 9, 2014|work=San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DEA Internal review, punishment and aftermath==
The [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]], via its Board of Professional Conduct, concluded its internal investigation of the incident in March 2015, punishing all six agents involved with letters of reprimand and additional suspensions of 5 and 7 days, respectively, without pay, for two of them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/05/us/california-forgotten-prisoner/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://freebeacon.com/issues/dea-agents-left-college-student-in-cell-for-five-days-receive-light-punishments/&lt;/ref&gt; Chong's lawyer, Gene Iredale, has expressed his disappointment over the punishments, labeling them "insufficient," a sentiment echoed by many lawmakers and administrators, including Congressman [[Ted Lieu]] (D-Los Angeles), who has called for a civil rights investigation into the case.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-dea-chong-20150505-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/ted-lieu-wants-civil-rights-investigation-daniel-chong-dea-case-n355196&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], in a letter to Congress, has also articulated its dismay, stating that such incommensurate penalties are symptomatic of institutional inadequacies with the DEA "disciplinary process" and promising forthcoming recommendations for its improvement. Congress has also vowed rectification of said process by giving the DEA "administrator more authority over civil service disciplinary rules;" DEA officials have blamed this lack of authority for their Agency's history of inadequately disciplining and punishing its employees.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"/&gt; These concerns and promises voiced, however, only target improvements to the DEA's disciplinary process to punish employees for incidences, like that experienced by Chong, after the fact and not to any potential systemic problems that allow them to happen in the first place. These latter issues, DEA spokesperson Rusty Payne assures, have been fixed, and such an assurance appears to have placated most lawmakers and administrators for now.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stltoday.com/news/national/student-left-in-dea-cell-to-get-million-from-us/article_c7263c80-a7a4-5cce-8fa0-c2f88a147b76.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indigenous Australian literature''' is the fiction, plays, poems, essays and other works authored by [[Indigenous Australian]]s. Notable authors include [[David Unaipon]], [[Oodgeroo Noonuccal]], [[Sally Morgan (artist)|Sally Morgan]], [[Marcia Langton]], [[Noel Pearson]], [[Jack Davis (playwright)|Jack Davis]], [[Kevin Gilbert (author)|Kevin Gilbert]], [[Kim Scott]], [[Alexis Wright]], [[Kate Howarth (writer)|Kate Howarth]], [[Tara June Winch]], [[Yvette Holt]] and [[Anita Heiss]]. 
==History==
At the point of the first colonization, [[Indigenous Australians]] had not developed a system of writing, so the first literary accounts of Aborigines come from the journals of early European explorers, which contain descriptions of first contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Genoni|first=Paul|title=Subverting the Empire: Explorers and Exploration in Australian Fiction|year=2004|publisher=Common Ground|location=Altona, VIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While his father, [[James Unaipon]] (c.1835-1907), contributed to accounts of Aboriginal mythology written by the missionary George Taplin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkin|first=Graham|title=Conquest of the Ngarrindjeri|year=1979|publisher=Rigby|location=Adelaide}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Unaipon]] (1872–1967) provided the first accounts of Aboriginal mythology written by an Aboriginal: ''[[Legendary Tales of the Australian Aborigines]]''. For this he is known as the first Aboriginal author. [[Oodgeroo Noonuccal]] (1920–1993) was a famous Aboriginal poet, writer and rights activist credited with publishing the first Aboriginal book of verse: ''[[We Are Going]]'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/poetry/index.htm |title=Modern Australian poetry |publisher=Ministère de la culture }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sally Morgan (artist)|Sally Morgan]]'s novel ''[[My Place (book)|My Place]]'' brought Indigenous stories to wider notice. Leading Aboriginal activists [[Marcia Langton]] ([[First Australians]], 2008) and [[Noel Pearson]] (''[[Up from the Mission]]'', 2009) are contemporary contributors to Australian non-fiction.
[[File:Noel Pearson 8Feb10.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Noel Pearson]] is an Aboriginal lawyer, rights activist and essayist.]]
The voices of [[Australian Aborigines|Indigenous Australians]] include the [[playwright]] [[Jack Davis (playwright)|Jack Davis]] and [[Kevin Gilbert (author)|Kevin Gilbert]].

'''International Whores' Day''' or '''International Sex Workers Day''' is observed annually on June 2 of each year, honours sex workers and recognises their often exploited working conditions. The event commemorates the occupation of [[Église Saint-Nizier]] in [[Lyon]] by more than a hundred sex workers on 2 June 1975 to draw attention to their inhumane working conditions.&lt;ref name="diewelt"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/article3878794/Kirche-soll-Prostituierte-nicht-ausgrenzen.html |title=Internationaler Hurentag – Kirche soll Prostituierte nicht ausgrenzen (International Whores' Day: The church shouldn't exclude the prostitutes) |date=2009-06-07 |language=German |publisher=Die Welt - Online |accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been celebrated annually since 1976. In German, it is known as ''Hurentag'' (Whore's Day). In Spanish-speaking countries, it is the ''Día Internacional de la Trabajadora Sexual'', the International Day of the Sex Worker.

== Background ==
[[File:Sex worker statue Oudekerksplein Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Bronze statue ''Belle'' in front of the [[Oude Kerk (Amsterdam)|Oude Kerk]] in the [[De Wallen]] red-light district in [[Amsterdam]]. It was unveiled in March 2007 with the inscription "Respect sex workers all over the world."]]
In the 1970s, French police kept sex workers under increasing pressure. The police reprisals&lt;ref name="diewelt"/&gt; forced sex workers to work increasingly in secret. As a result, protection of sex workers decreased and led to more violence against them. After two murders and the unwillingness of the government to improve the situation, [[sex worker]]s in Lyon occupied the Saint-Nizier church in rue de Brest and went on strike. The striking workers sang political chants and demanded decent working conditions and an end to stigma.

The police cleared the church after eight days.&lt;ref name="bszonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archiv.bszonline.de/index.php/24-archiv/urbi-et-orbi/2392-829-1-2.html |title=Internationaler Hurentag in Bochum (International Whores' Day in Bochum) |date=2010-05-17 |language=German |publisher=Bochumer Stadt- und Studierendenzeitung (bsz) |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event marks the starting point of an international movement of sex workers for [[sex workers' rights]].&lt;ref name="meritt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sexclusivitaeten.de/herstory_leselust_09.html |title=Sag mir, wer die Huren sind (Tell me, where are the whores?) |date= |language=German |publisher=Sexclusivitäten - Laura Méritt |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reading entitled "Women without rooms" in [[Bochum]], [[Germany]] on 29 May 2011 documented that the situation of sex workers has not improved since 1975.

[[Image:Goslar kaiserpfalz.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Imperial Palace of Goslar]]]] 

The term '''''Kaiserpfalz''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkaɪzɐˌpfalts|lang}}, "imperial palace") or '''''Königspfalz''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkøːnɪçsˌpfalts|lang}}, "royal palace", from [[Middle High German]] ''phal[en]ze'' to [[Old High German]] ''phalanza'' from [[Middle Latin]] ''palatia'' [plural] to [[Latin]] ''palatium'' "[[palace]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Pfalz_Residenz Eintrag ''Pfalz''] in ''Duden online''&lt;/ref&gt;) refers to a number of castles and palaces across the [[Holy Roman Empire]] that served as temporary, secondary seats of power for the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in the Early and High [[Middle Ages]]. The term was also used more rarely for a bishop who, as a [[territorial lord]] (''Landesherr''), had to provide the king and his entourage with board and lodging, a duty referred to as ''Gastungspflicht''.

== Origin of the name ==
''Kaiserpfalz'' is a [[German language|German]] word that is a combination of ''[[Kaiser]]'', meaning "emperor", which is derived from "[[Caesar (title)|caesar]]"; and ''Pfalz'', meaning "palace", and itself derived from the [[Latin]] ''palatium'', meaning the same (see [[palace]]). Likewise ''Königspfalz'' is a combination of ''König'', "king", and ''Pfalz'', meaning "royal palace".

== Description and purpose ==
[[File:Palais charlemagne.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Artist's impression of the ''Königspfalz'' at [[Aachen]]]]
Like their peers in [[France]] and [[England]], the medieval emperors of the Holy Roman Empire did not rule from a capital city, but had to maintain personal contact with their [[vassal]]s on the ground. This was so-called "itinerant kingship"; a sort of "travelling kingdom" (''Reisekönigtum''). Because ''pfalzen'' were built and used by the king as a ruler within the Holy Roman Empire  (''[[Kingdom of Germany|rex Romanorum (Römischer König)]]''), the correct historical term is ''Königspfalz'' or "royal palace". The term ''Kaiserpfalz'' is a 19th-century appellation that overlooks the fact that the king did not bear the title of the Roman Emperor (granted by the [[Pope]]) until after his imperial coronation. Unlike a ''pfalz'', where the itinerant ruler enacted his sovereign duties, a royal estate or ''Königshof'' is only an economic estate owned by the king, which was only occasionally used by the king on his itinerary.&lt;ref name="Königshöfe_Mittelrhein"&gt;Michael Gockel: ''Karolingische Königshöfe am Mittelrhein.'' Verlag Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, Göttingen, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the common notion of "palace", a ''pfalz'' was not a permanent residence but a place where the emperor stayed for a certain time, usually less than a year; itineraries suggest that the monarch rarely would stay for longer than a few weeks. Moreover, they were not always grand palaces in the accepted sense: some were small castles or fortified hunting lodges, such as [[Bodfeld]] in the [[Harz]]. But in the main they were large manor houses (''Gutshöfe''), that offered catering and accommodation for the king and his many retainers, often running to hundreds of staff, as well as numerous guests and their horses. In [[Latin]], such a royal manor was known as a ''villa regia'' or ''curtis regia.'' They were located either near the bishop's residences, near important abbeys, near towns the king held or in the countryside in the middle of royal estates. ''Pfalzen'' were generally built at intervals of 30&amp;nbsp;kilometres, which represented a [[day's journey]] by horse at that time.

At a minimum, a ''pfalz'' consisted of a ''[[palas]]'' with its Great Hall or ''[[Aula Regia]]'', an imperial [[chapel]] (''Pfalzkapelle'') and an  [[estate (land)|estate]] (''Gutshof''). It was here that kings and emperors carried out the business of state, held their [[Imperial court (Holy Roman Empire)|imperial court]] sessions and celebrated important church festivals. Each was administered by a [[count palatine]], who executed jurisdiction in the emperor's stead. One of the most important of them would eventually rise to the title of [[Electoral Palatinate|Prince-elector]].

The ''pfalzen'' that the rulers visited varied depending on their function. Especially important were those palaces in which the kings spent the winter (winter palaces or ''Winterpfalzen''), and the festival palaces (''Festtagspfalzen''), [[Easter]] being the most important and celebrated at Easter palaces (''Osterpfalzen'').

The larger palaces were often in [[town]]s that had special rights (e.g. [[imperial immediacy]]), but could also be [[bishop]]'s seats or [[imperial abbey]]s.

In the [[Hohenstaufen]] era of the Roman-German kingdom, important imperial princes began to demonstrate their claims to power by building their own ''pfalzen''. Important examples of these include [[Henry the Lion]]'s [[Dankwarderode Castle]] in [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] and the [[Wartburg]] above [[Eisenach]] in Thuringia. Both buildings followed the basic design of Hohenstaufen ''pfalzen'' and also had the same dimensions.

Examples of surviving imperial palaces may be found in the town of [[Goslar]] and at [[Düsseldorf-Kaiserswerth]].

'''Mizmar''' ({{lang-ar|مزمار}}) is an [[Africa]]n [[dance]].. The dance involves moving while twirling a [[bamboo]] [[Walking stick|cane]], to the music of drums. The dance and music have strong [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] influences. In the past, the ritual was associated with spiritual healing practices, similar to [[Fann At-Tanbura]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2225">'''Neddy Lohan''', Captain of [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Whiteboys]], died in 1820.

Lohan was a captain of a group of [[Whiteboys]] in the [[Moylough]] area of [[County Galway]], responsible for rural unrest and violence. They were opposed by [[Charles O'Rourke (Moylough)]], a landlord based in Moylough, who arrested suspected members and engaged them in pitched battles. 

An ambush was planned by the Whiteboys, upon learning of his route on a given night. However, a young landowner named Brown was travelling the same road that night, and was killed in the belief that he was O'Rourke. He was well regarded by local people and the Whiteboys.

O'Rourke arrested several men, and upon the information of an informer, Seamus a'Burca, Lohan was sentenced to death for the crime. Prior to sentencing, Lohan was asked if there were any gentleman of the jury who could give him a character recommendation. Lohan pointed out a Mr. Blake of Garbally. On being asked what he had to say about Lohan, Blake replied, ''I never saw two dogs fighting, my lord, but Lohan would be the third.''

Lohan was taken from [[Galway]] jail to be hanged, as was custom, at his own door. He sat on his coffin on a cart on the way. At [[Turloughmore]] he recognised a friend called [[O'Shaughnessy]] and threw him his hat, exclaiming ''I will you my old hat.'' This was afterwards called Lohan's Last Will and Testament.

Lohan was hanged in front of a crowd of hundreds at Cooloo hill, in sight of his house. Two of his sisters were present, and it was stated that they were never in their right mind afterwards. The local historian, [[Martin Finnerty]], recorded that his grandmother witnessed the event.

'''Nepalis in Libya''' consists mainly of migrant workers from [[Nepal]]. According to Nepal's Ministry of Foreign Affair, there are about 3,064 Nepalis working in Libya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2011/02/22/top-story/govt-bailing-out-nepalis-from-libya/218701.html: The Kathmandu Post - Govt bailing out Nepalis from Libya]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The majority of Nepalese workers in Libya work as construction or industrial laborers. The Nepalese government has opened Libya for foreign employment in 2009 and about six Nepalese outsourcing agencies have sent 1,868 Nepalis to Libya while 22 have reached there through individual contracts. The Department of Foreign Employment data shows that 2,592 Nepalis reached the destination in last two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullTodays.php?headline=Over+1%2C200+Nepali+workers+are+back&amp;NewsID=278961: The Himalayan Times - Over 1,200 Nepali workers are back]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], many Nepalese workers began to leave the country. About 1,200 Nepalis had already left Libya according to the Nepal Foreign Employment Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/southasia/news/article_1622281.php/Nepalese-workers-arrive-home-from-Libya: M&amp;C -Nepalese workers arrive home from Libya]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them left the country through [[Egypt]] by reaching the border from [[Derna, Libya|Derna]] under a rescue effort coordinated by Nepal’s envoy in [[Cairo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=46797&amp;cat_id=4%C3%83%C6%92%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%C5%A1%C3%83%E2%A2%E3%9A%C3%82%C2%841%A47%3E%3Cfont%20face=: The Rising Nepal -Stranded Nepalese in Libya reaching Egypt border]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently many Nepalis are still stranded in Libya and living in terrible conditions. About 113 Nepalis are stranded in [[Tripoli]] and [[Misrata]] and about another 44 working in [[Benghazi]] are languishing in a camp facing with food shortage.

In November 2008 Munaf Kalia (Chief Executive Officer of [[Khanani and Kalia International (Pvt.) Ltd.]]), Yusuf Kalia, and associates, were charged for illegally transferring funds from Pakistan to Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="geo.tv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geo.tv/11-9-2008/28465.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211124811/http://www.geo.tv/11-9-2008/28465.htm |archivedate=2008-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In light of the charges, the [[State Bank of Pakistan]] revoked the license for ''Khanani and Kalia International'' to operate its [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] business and forced it to shut its offices.

On March 5, 2011, the directors of ''Khanani and Kailia International'' and four bankers were acquitted of all charges due to lack of evidence.  The judge said that the prosecution failed to present evidence that directly implicated the defendants.&lt;ref name=acquitted&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/127530/forex-scam-court-acquits-8-due-to-lack-of-evidence/ |title=Hawala case: Khanani and Kalia acquitted |publisher=The Express Tribune |date=March 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Since the depreciation of the [[Pakistani rupee|rupee]] from July 2007, the [[Federal Investigation Agency]] was investigating the unexpected depreciation by the orders of the [[Government of Pakistan|Pakistani government]]. In November 2008, the government sought support from [[Interpol]] with whose help the FIA cracked down all over Pakistan searching for persons involved in illegal smuggling of US dollars outside Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenews.com.pk/updates.asp?id=59605&lt;/ref&gt; The FIA conducted raids in various parts of [[Karachi]] detained more than 12 people including Munaf Kalia, and ten officials of the [[National Database Registration Authority]] suspected of providing counterfeit identity cards.&lt;ref name="geo.tv"/&gt; Manaf Kalia appeared in the court of Omar Awan, judicial magistrate South Karachi on November 9, 2008. The FIA sought and obtained a remand to [[Lahore]] to face another charge.

== Exit Control List ==
The Special Civil Court of Lahore, ordered that more than 14 names of different people involved in the [[forex scam]] case be included in the [[Exit Control List]] (ECL) of Pakistan.

==Time Line==
On November 10, 2008, the State Bank of Pakistan suspended the licence of Khanani and Kalia for 30 days and debarred KKI’s head office, branches, franchises payment booths and currency exchange booths from undertaking any kind of business for violating its rules and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenews.com.pk/daily_detail.asp?id=145962&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 10, 2008, the State Bank of Pakistan suspended the licence of Khanani and Kalia for an indefinite period of time. The suspension order further stated that the company's headquarter, branch offices and/or franchise cannot carry any business dealings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geo.tv/12-6-2008/30215.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209044314/http://www.geo.tv/12-6-2008/30215.htm |archivedate=2008-12-09 |df= }} Jang Group of News&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, a second [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] company in Pakistan [[Zarco Exchange]] was accused of similar allegations and also had its license revoked and forced to shut down.

In Dec 2010, the Special Court (offences in banking) Lahore said that due to lack of evidence it saw no reason that Zarco Exchange should not request a revival of its license from the State Bank of Pakistan and in Feb 2011 its CEO was released by the Pakistan [[Federal Investigation Agency]] (FIA) after it said it decided to no longer pursue the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/115638/man-accused-of-illegal-rs67b-transfer-freed/ |title=Man accused of illegal Rs67b transfer freed |publisher=The Express Tribune |date=February 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2011 Zarco Exchange's license was restored and the business started operating again.

On March 5, 2011, the directors of ''Khanani and Kailia International'' and four bankers were acquitted of all charges due to lack of evidence.&lt;ref name=acquitted /&gt;  However the FIA complained about the acquittal and said it had provided enough evidence.  In response the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] had an independent judge investigate the acquittal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.khabrain.info/2011/03/khanani-and-kalia-acquittal-being-investigated-by-shc-34506/ |title=Khanani and Kalia: Acquittal being investigated by SHC |date=March 14, 2011 |publisher=khabrain }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the acquittal a separate action by the FIA appeared to have failed due to mistakes that meant evidence provided to the court was missing important information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dawn.com/2011/04/17/fia-set-to-lose-another-khanani-kalia-case.html |title=FIA set to lose another Khanani &amp; Kalia case |publisher=Dawn.com from the newspaper |date=April 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hawala business==
The government’s action against [[Hawala]] trade, which involves international network of currency dealers for making unrecorded payments in each other’s countries, was one step in the series of the forex scam case.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Politics/12-Nov-2008/Hundi-system-to-be-smashed-Rehman&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/sept11/2001/10/01/hundi.htm | work=USA Today | title='Hundi' system may foil investigators | date=September 30, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; These steps were taken at a time when the rupee depreciated by 30 percent against the dollar since the beginning of 2008.

'''Pangea Day''' was an international multimedia event conducted on May 10, 2008. [[Cairo]], [[Kigali]], [[London]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]] were linked to produce a 4-hour program of films, music and speakers. The program was broadcast live across the globe from 1800 to 2200 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], culminating in a global drum circle, symbolizing the common heartbeat of the world. According to the festival organizers, "Pangea Day plans to use the power of film to bring the world a little closer together." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i12490cf38336fdda945e6048e35c6f19 retrieved January 12/08

Pangea Day originated in 2006 when documentary filmmaker [[Jehane Noujaim]] won the [[TED (conference)|TED Prize]]. Jehane wished to use film to bring the world together.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/11/07/arts/NA-A-E-CEL-US-Goldie-Hawn.php?WT.mc_id=rssap_news retrieved January 12/08&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pangea]] refers to the supercontinent from which all current continents eventually separated. It serves as a reminder of the "connectedness" or unitary nature of all people on Planet [[Earth]].

== Goals ==
*Bring together millions of people from all over the world in a unique shared experience.
*Use the power of film to create a better understanding of one another.
*Form a global community striving for a better future.
&lt;ref name="Pangea Day"/&gt;

*Cairo - [[Egyptian Pyramids|The Pyramids]]
*Kigali - [[Jali Gardens]]
*London - [[Somerset House]]
*Los Angeles - [[Sony Pictures Studios]]
*Mumbai - [[National Centre for the Performing Arts (India)|National Centre for the Performing Arts]]

In [[Brazil]], '''Pardo''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈpaʁdu}} or {{IPA-pt|ˈpaɾdu|}}) is an ethnic/skin color category used by the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] (IBGE) in the Brazilian censuses. The term "''pardo''" is a complex one, more commonly used to refer to Brazilians of mixed ethnic ancestries. Pardo Brazilians represent a wide range of skin colours and backgrounds. They are typically a mixture of  [[white Brazilian]], [[Afro-Brazilian]] and [[indigenous peoples in Brazil|Native Brazilian]].&lt;ref name="Brazil ethnics groups"&gt;Gentios Brasílicos: Índios Coloniais em Minas Gerais Setecentista. Tese de Doutorado em História, IFCH-Unicamp, 2003, 401p&lt;/ref&gt;

The other categories are ''branco'' ("[[white people|white]]"), ''preto'' ("[[black people|black]]"), ''[[Asian Brazilians|amarelo]]'' ("yellow", meaning [[East Asia]]ns), and ''indígena'' ("indigene" or "indigenous person", meaning [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]]). The term was and is still popular in Brazil.

Pardo was also a ''[[casta]]'' classification used in Colonial [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] from the 16th to 19th centuries.  The term ''pardo'' was used primarily in small areas of Spanish America whose economy was based on slavery during the Spanish colonization period. {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Definitions==
{{Main article|Race and ethnicity in Brazil}}
[[File:Main ethnic groups in brazil.JPG|350px|thumb|Main ethnic groups in Brazil.]]
According to [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), ''pardo'' is a broad classification that encompasses [[Mixed-race Brazilian|Multiracial Brazilians]] such as ''[[mulatto|mulatos]]'' and ''[[Zambo|cafuzos]]'', as well as assimilated [[Amerindians]] known as ''[[caboclo]]s'', mixed with Europeans or not. The term "pardo" was first used in a Brazilian census in 1872. The following census, in 1890, replaced the word ''pardo'' by ''mestiço'' (that of mixed origins). The censuses of 1900 and 1920 did not ask about race, arguing that "the answers largely hid the truth".&lt;ref name=magnoli&gt;MAGNOLI, Demétrio. Uma Gota de Sangue, Editora Contexto 2008 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil the word "pardo" has had a general meaning since the beginning of the colonization. In the famous letter by [[Pero Vaz de Caminha]], for example, in which Brazil was first described by the Portuguese, the Native Americans were called "pardo": "Pardo, naked, without clothing".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.culturabrasil.org/zip/carta.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A reading of colonial wills and testaments also shows it. [[Diogo de Vasconcelos]], a widely known historian from [[Minas Gerais]], mentions, for example, the story of Andresa de Castilhos. According to the information from the 18th century, Andresa de Castilhos was thus described: "I declare that Andresa de Castilhos, pardo woman&amp;nbsp;... has been freed&amp;nbsp;... is a descendant of the natives of the land&amp;nbsp;... I declare that Andresa de Castilhos is the daughter of a white man and a native woman".&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogo de Vasconcelos]], [[History of Minas Gerais]], volume 1, testament of the Colonel Salvador Furtado Fernandes de Mendonça, from about 1725&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Maria Leônia Chaves de Resende]] also explains that the word pardo was employed to name people with native ancestry or even Native Americans themselves: a Manoel, natural son of Ana carijó, was baptised as 'pardo'; in [[Campanha]] several Native Americans were classified as 'pardo'; the natives João Ferreira, Joana Rodriges and Andreza Pedrosa, for example, were named 'freed pardo'; a Damaso called himself 'freed pardo' of the 'native of the land'; etc.&lt;ref name="bibliotecadigital.unicamp.br"&gt;Gentios Brasílicos: Índios Coloniais em Minas Gerais Setecentista. Tese de Doutorado em História, IFCH-Unicamp, 2003, 401p; http://www.bibliotecadigital.unicamp.br/document/?code=vtls000295347&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Maria Leônia Chaves de Resende, the growth of the pardo population in Brazil includes the descendants of natives and not only those of African descent: "the growth of the 'pardo' segment had not only to do with the descendants of Africans, but also with the descendants of the natives, in particular the carijós and bastards, included in the condition of 'pardo'".&lt;ref name="bibliotecadigital.unicamp.br"/&gt;

The American historian Muriel Nazzari specifically pointed out the "pardo" category absorbed those of Native American descent in São Paulo: "This paper seeks to demonstrate that, though many Indians and mestizos did migrate, those who remained in São Paulo came to be classified as pardos"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/32735|title=Vanishing Indians: The Social Construction of Race in Colonial Sao Paulo|first=Muriel|last=Nazzari|date=1 January 2001|publisher=|volume=57|issue=4|pages=497–524|accessdate=27 June 2016|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.1353/tam.2001.0040|pmid=19522106|journal=The Americas}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The question about race reappeared in the 1940 census. In this census, "pardo" was not given as an option, but if the answer was different from the options "white", "black" and "yellow", a horizontal line was drawn into the "colour" box. When the census data came to be tabulated, all responses with horizontal lines were collected into the single category of "pardo". The term "pardo" was not used as an option as an assurance to the public that census data would not be used for discriminatory purposes, as a result of rising European racism at the time.&lt;ref name=KertzerArel&gt;{{cite book|title=Census and Identity: The Politics of Race, Ethnicity, and Language in National Censuses|author=Dav(id I. Kertzer and Dominique Arel|pages=63&amp;ndash;64|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-00427-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950 census, "pardo" was actually added as a choice of answer.&lt;ref name=KertzerArel /&gt; This trend remains, with the exception of the 1970 census, which also did not ask about race.&lt;ref name=magnoli/&gt;

The 20th century saw a large growth of the ''pardo'' population.&lt;ref name=magnoli/&gt; In 1940, 21.2% of Brazilians were classified as ''pardos''. In 2000, they had increased to 38.5% of the population. This is only partially due to the continuous process of miscegenation in the Brazilian population. Races are molded in accordance with perceptions and ideologies prevalent at each historical moment. In the 20th century, a significant part of the Brazilians who used to self-report as Black in earlier censuses chose to move to the Pardo category. Also a significant part of the population that used to self-report as white also moved to the Pardo category with the growing racial and social awareness, and [[Demétrio Magnoli|Magnoli]] describes this phenomenon as the ''pardização'' ("pardoization") of Brazil.&lt;ref name=magnoli/&gt;

== Ancestry ==
According to an autosomal DNA study (the autosomal study is about the sum of the ancestors of a person, unlike mtDNA or yDNA haplogroup studies, which cover only one single line), the "pardos" in Rio de Janeiro were found to be predominantly European, at roughly 70% (see table). The geneticist Sérgio Pena criticised foreign scholar Edward Telles for lumping "blacks" and "pardos" in the same category, given the predominantly European ancestry of the "pardos" throughout Brazil. According to him, "the autosomal genetic analysis that we have performed in non-related individuals from Rio de Janeiro shows that it does not make any sense to put "blacks" and "pardos" in the same category".&lt;ref name="laboratoriogene"&gt;[http://www.laboratoriogene.com.br/geneImprensa/2009/pensamento.pdf Do pensamento racial ao pensamento racional] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522233206/http://www.laboratoriogene.com.br/geneImprensa/2009/pensamento.pdf |date=2014-05-22 }}, [http://www.laboratoriogene.com.br/ laboratoriogene.com.br].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another autosomal DNA study has confirmed that the European ancestry is dominant throughout in the Brazilian population, regardless of complexion, "pardos" included. "A new portrayal of each ethnic contribution to the DNA of Brazilians, obtained with samples from the five regions of the country, has indicated that, on average, European ancestors are responsible for nearly 80% of the genetic heritage of the population. The variation between the regions is small, with the possible exception of the South, where the European contribution reaches nearly 90%. The results, published by the scientific magazine 'American Journal of Human Biology' by a team from the Catholic University of Brasília, show that, in Brazil, physical indicators such as skin colour, colour of the eyes and colour of the hair have little to do with the genetic ancestry of each person, as has been shown in previous studies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ciencia/ult306u633465.shtml|title=Folha Online - Ciência - DNA de brasileiro é 80% europeu, indica estudo - 05/10/2009|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Ancestry informative SNPs can be useful to estimate individual and population biogeographical ancestry. The Brazilian population is characterized by a genetic background of three parental populations (European, African, and Brazilian Native Amerindians) with a wide degree and diverse patterns of admixture. In this work we analyzed the information content of 28 ancestry-informative SNPs into multiplexed panels using three parental population sources (African, Amerindian, and European) to infer the genetic admixture in an urban sample of the five Brazilian geopolitical regions. The SNPs assigned apart the parental populations from each other and thus can be applied for ancestry estimation in a three hybrid admixed population. Data was used to infer genetic ancestry in Brazilians with an admixture model. Pairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, ''with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085)''. The described multiplexed SNP panels can be useful tool for bio-anthropological studies but it can be mainly valuable to control for spurious results in genetic association studies in admixed populations."&lt;ref name="pmid19639555"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lins | first1 = T.

According to another autosomal DNA study conducted on a school in the poor periphery of Rio de Janeiro the "pardos" there were found to be on average over 80% European, and the "whites" (who thought of themselves as "very mixed") were found out to carry very little Amerindian and/or African admixtures. "The results of the tests of genomic ancestry are quite different from the self made estimates of European ancestry", say the researchers. In general, the test results showed that European ancestry is far more important than the students thought it would be. The "pardos" for example thought of themselves as 1/3 European, 1/3 African and 1/3 Amerindian before the tests, and yet their ancestry was determined to be at over 80% European.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/current/readings/santos-race-brazil.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meionews.com.br/index.php/noticias/21-estado-do-rio/4607-negros-e-pardos-do-rio-tem-mais-genes-europeus-do-que-imaginam-segundo-estudo.html|title=Negros e pardos do Rio têm mais genes europeus do que imaginam, segundo estudo|author=Editor|work=Meio News RJ|accessdate=14 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706153557/http://www.meionews.com.br/index.php/noticias/21-estado-do-rio/4607-negros-e-pardos-do-rio-tem-mais-genes-europeus-do-que-imaginam-segundo-estudo.html|archivedate=6 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An autosomal study from 2011 (with nearly almost 1000 samples from all over the country, "whites", "pardos" and "blacks") has also concluded that European ancestry is the predominant ancestry in Brazil, accounting for nearly 70% of the ancestry of the population. "In all regions studied, the European ancestry was predominant, with proportions ranging from 60.6% in the Northeast to 77.7% in the South". The "pardos" included were found to be predominantly European in ancestry on average.&lt;ref name="pmid21359226"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pena | first1 = Sérgio D.

==History==
The formation of the Brazilian people is marked by a mixture of whites, blacks and Indians.&lt;ref name=Freyre&gt;Freyre, Gilberto. ''Casa-Grande e Senzala'', Edition. 51, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; According to geneticist Sérgio Pena "''with the exception of immigrants of first or second generation, there is no Brazilian who does not carry a bit of African and Amerindian genetic''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufcg.edu.br/prt_ufcg/assessoria_imprensa/mostra_noticia.php?codigo=5289|title=UFCG - UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE CAMPINA GRANDE-PB|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The correlation between color and genomic ancestry is imperfect: at the individual level one cannot safely predict the skin color of a person from his/her level of European, African and Amerindian ancestry nor the opposite. Regardless of their skin color, the overwhelming majority of Brazilians have a high degree of European ancestry. Also, regardless of their skin color, the overwhelming majority of Brazilians have a significant degree of African ancestry. Finally, most Brazilians have a significant and very uniform degree of Amerindian ancestry.

The high ancestral variability observed in whites and blacks suggests that each Brazilian has a singular and quite individual proportion of European, African and Amerindian ancestry in his/her mosaic genomes" (geneticist Sérgio Pena).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0100-879X2009001000001|title=Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research - DNA tests probe the genomic ancestry of Brazilians|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colonization of Brazil was characterised by a small proportion of women among the settlers.&lt;ref name=Ribeiro&gt;RIBEIRO, Darcy. O Povo Brasileiro, Companhia de Bolso, fourth reprint, 2008 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  As there was a male predominance in the European contingent present in Brazil, most [[sexual partner]]s of those settlers were, initially, Amerindian or African women, and, later, mixed-race women.&lt;ref name=Ribeiro/&gt; This sexual asymmetry is marked on the genetics of the Brazilian people, regardless of skin color: there is a predominance of European Y chromosomes, and of Amerindian and African MtDNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carvalho-Silva DR, Santos FR, Rocha J, Pena SD |title=The Phylogeography of Brazilian Y-Chromosome Lineages|journal=Am J Hum Genet |pages=281–86 |volume=68|issue=1|year=2001 |pmid=11090340 |pmc=1234928 |doi=10.1086/316931}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haplogroup frequencies do not determine phenotype nor admixture. They are very general genetic snapshots, primarily useful in examining past population group migratory patterns. Only autosomal DNA testing can reveal admixture structures, since it analyses millions of alleles from both maternal and paternal sides. Contrary to yDNA or mtDNA, which are focused on one single lineage (paternal or maternal) the autosomal DNA studies profile the whole ancestry of a given individual, being more accurate in describing the complex patterns of ancestry in a given place. In the Brazilian "white" and "pardos" the autosomal ancestry (the sum of the ancestors of a given individual) tends to be largely European, with often a non-European mtDNA (which points to a non-European ancestor somewhere up the maternal line), which is explained by the women marrying newly arrived colonists, during the formation of the Brazilian people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laboratoriogene.com.br/?area=genealogiaAncestralidadeDiferenca|title=Laboratório GENE - Núcleo de Genética Médica|author=Desenvolvimento: Ronnan del Rey|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first century of colonization, there was generalised interbreeding between Portuguese males and Amerindian females in Brazil. However, the Amerindian population was decimated by epidemics, wars and slavery.&lt;ref name=Ribeiro/&gt; Since 1550, African slaves began to be brought to Brazil in large numbers. Miscegenation between Portuguese males and African females was common. European and Asiatic immigrants who came to Brazil in the 19th and 20th centuries (Portuguese, Italians, Spaniards, Germans, Arab, Japanese, etc.) also participated in the process. Among many of the immigrant groups in Brazil, there was a large predominance of men.

In all Brazilian regions European, African and Amerindian genetic markers are found in the local populations, even though the proportion of each varies from region to region and from individual to individual.&lt;ref name="pmid21359226"/&gt; However most regions showed basically the same structure, a greater European contribution to the population, followed by African and Native American contributions: "Some people had the vision Brazil was a heterogeneous mosaic. ... Our study proves Brazil is a lot more integrated than some expected".&lt;ref name="pmid21359226" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The genomic ancestry of individuals from different geographical regions of Brazil is more uniform than expected |pmid=21359226  |vauthors=Pena SD, etal |journal=PLOS ONE |year=2011 |volume=6 |issue=1 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0017063 |pmc=3040205 |pages=e17063|bibcode=2011PLoSO...617063P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazilian homogeneity is, therefore, greater within regions than between them:

An autosomal study from 2013, with nearly 1,300 samples from all of the Brazilian regions, found a pred. degree of European ancestry combined with African and Native American contributions, in varying degrees. 'Following an increasing North to South gradient, European ancestry was the most prevalent in all urban populations (with values up to 74%). The populations in the North consisted of a significant proportion of Native American ancestry that was about two times higher than the African contribution. Conversely, in the Northeast, Center-West and Southeast, African ancestry was the second most prevalent. At an intrapopulation level, all urban populations were highly admixed, and most of the variation in ancestry proportions was observed between individuals within each population rather than among population'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Saloum de Neves Manta F, etal |title=Revisiting the genetic ancestry of Brazilians using autosomal AIM-Indels. |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=8 |issue=9 |year=2013 |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0075145 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0075145 |pmid=24073242 |pages=e75145 |pmc=3779230|bibcode=2013PLoSO...875145S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 autosomal genetic study, which also analysed data of 25 studies of 38 different Brazilian populations concluded that: European ancestry accounts for 62% of the heritage of the population, followed by the African (21%) and the Native American (17%).

Not all descendants of this mixture of peoples are included in the "pardo" category. Since racial classifications in Brazil are based on phenotype, rather than ancestry, a large part of the self-reported white population has African and Amerindian ancestors, as well as a great part of the Black population has large European and Native American contributions.&lt;ref name=Telles&gt;{{cite book|pages=81&amp;ndash;84|title=Race in Another America: the significance of skin color in Brazil|author=Edward Eric Telles|chapter=Racial Classification|year=2004|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-11866-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides skin color, there are social factors that influence the racial classifications in Brazil, such as [[social class]], [[wealth]], racial prejudice and stigma of being Black, Mulatto or Amerindian.&lt;ref name=Ribeiro/&gt;

The following are the results for the different Brazilian censuses, since 1872:

===Politics===

Pardos have made a minor impact in the  Brazilian political arena largely dominated by whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clas.berkeley.edu/research/democracy-puzzling-whiteness-brazilian-politicans|title=DEMOCRACY: The Puzzling Whiteness of Brazilian Politics|work=Center for Latin American Studies (CLAS)|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nilo Peçanha]], who was disputably the only [[mulatto]] president of Brazil.&lt;ref name="Beattie"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9Yv38N0-CqMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPP1,M1 BEATTIE, Peter M.

Since the end of the military dictatorship, the political participation of pardos has increased. Former Senator [[Marina Silva]] is a descendant of [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]] and [[Afro-Brazilian|black African]] ancestors in both her maternal and paternal lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0,,EMI88634-15223,00.html Marina Silva deixa o PT] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts and entertainment===
Many important names of Brazilian literature are or have been pardos. [[Machado de Assis]], generally considered the most important Brazilian fictional writer, was himself "pardo". Other remarkable writers include: [[Lima Barreto]], novelist, master of satyre and sarcasm, and pioneer of social criticism; [[João Ubaldo Ribeiro]], novelist and short story writer; [[João do Rio]], journalist; [[Paulo Leminski]], poet.

Other remarkable artists include Father [[José Maurício Nunes Garcia]]&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Bernardes. [http://www.dc.mre.gov.br/imagens-e-textos/revista-textos-do-brasil/portugues/revista12-mat5.pdf José Maurício Nunes Garcia e a Real Capela de D. João VI no Rio de Janeiro]. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; (baroque conductor and composer), or [[Aleijadinho]] (outstanding sculptor and architect)&lt;ref&gt;Domingos Tavares. [http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/6130.pdf Sensibilidade e cultura na obra arquitectónica do Aleijadinho]. p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; attained high prestige as artists, as did symbolist poet of refined inspiration, [[Lima Barreto]], novelist, master of satire and sarcasm, pioneer of social criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://escritores.folha.com.br/lima_barreto-biografia.html |title=Lima Barreto: Um escritor de triste fim |publisher=Escritores.folha.com.br |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is in popular music, however, that the talents of pardos (along with [[Afro-Brazilian|Afro Brazilians]], an even more disenfranchised group) found the most fertile ground for their development. Some of the examples include [[Pixinguinha]],&lt;ref&gt;Hermínio Bello de Carvalho. [http://www.dc.mre.gov.br/imagens-e-textos/revista-textos-do-brasil/portugues/revista11-mat5.pdf São Pixinguinha]. p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chiquinha Gonzaga]] and [[Lupicínio Rodrigues]] &lt;ref&gt;Gilberto Ferreira da Silva et alli. RS negro: cartografias sobre a produção do conhecimento [https://books.google.com/books?id=kmnrjieFX08C&amp;pg=PA111&amp;f=false p. 111].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another field where "pardos" have excelled is [[Association football|football]]: [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], popularly dubbed "the phenomenon", is considered by experts and fans to be one of the greatest football players of all time.,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/feb/14/ronaldo-retires-brazil-real-madrid-internazionale "Ronaldo: In his pomp, he was a footballing force close to unstoppable"].

According to IBGE's data for 2009,&lt;ref name="IBGE2009"/&gt; of the ten states with greatest percentual ''pardo'' population, five were in the North and five in the Northeast.

*1) [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]] – 77.2%
*2) [[Pará]] – 72.6%
*3) [[Piauí]] – 69.9%

Between 2000 and 2010, the states of [[Goiás]], [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Espírito Santo]], together with the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]] moved to the group of majoritarily non-white states, of which ''pardos'' are very likely to be the new majority if trends continue as they perform the greatest non-white group in all Brazilian states. The next to be [[Minority-majority state|minority-majority]] is probably [[Mato Grosso do Sul]] (51.78% white), followed by [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] (54.25% white). The four southernmost states were all &gt;70% white in the 20th century, nevertheless in the last 2010 census [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] turned to be almost exactly 70.0% white, and according to the contemporary demographic trends it is likely to be less than 70% now.

It should be pointed out that self-identification and ancestry don't correlate well in Brazil. A predominantly self identified "pardo" state like [[Goiás]] turned out to be mostly European in ancestry according to an autosomal study from the UnB undertaken in 2008. According to that study, the ancestral composition of Goiás is 83,70% European, 13,30% African and 3,0% Native American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bdtd.bce.unb.br/tedesimplificado/tde_busca/arquivo.php?codArquivo=3873|title=Untitled Document|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706162307/http://bdtd.bce.unb.br/tedesimplificado/tde_arquivos/36/TDE-2008-08-21T100337Z-3085/Publico/2008_NeideMOGodinho.pdf|archivedate=6 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Fortaleza]], for example, both "whites" and "pardos" displayed a similar ancestral composition, according to a 2011 autosomal study: a predominant degree of European ancestry (&gt;70%) was found out, with minor but important African and Native American contributions.&lt;ref name="pmid21359226" /&gt;

The United States Supreme Court unanimously held that "race" is not limited to Census designations on the "race question" but extends to all ethnicities, and thus can include Jewish and Arab as well as Polish or Italian or Irish, etc.&lt;ref&gt;St. Francis Coll. v. Al-Khazraji 481 U.S. 604 (1987), Shaare Tefila Congregation v. Cobb, 481 U.S. 615 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the Census asks an "Ancestry Question" which covers the broader notion of ethnicity initially in the 2000 Census long form and now in the American Community Survey. The ancestry question will return in the 2020 Census.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/02/01/582338628/-what-kind-of-white-2020-census-to-ask-white-people-about-origins|title=2020 Census Will Ask White People More About Their Ethnicities|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-02-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] of the [[US Department of Labor]] finalized its update of the [[EEO-1]] report format and guidelines to come into an effect on September 30, 2007. In particular, this update concerns the definitions of racial/ethnic categories.

=== Ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino origin ===

The question on Hispanic or Latino origin is separate from the question on race.&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/dmd/www/pdf/d61a.pdf |title=Short Form Questionnaire |accessdate=May 5, 2008 |format=PDF |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] have ethnic origins in the countries of [[Latin America]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]].

When responding to the race question on the census form, each person is asked to choose from among the same racial categories as all Americans, and are included in the numbers reported for those races.&lt;ref name="Guidance"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/compraceho.html |title=U.S. Census Bureau Guidance on the Presentation and Comparison of Race and Hispanic Origin Data |accessdate=April 6, 2007 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |quote=Race and Hispanic origin are two separate concepts in the federal statistical system. People who are Hispanic may be of any race. People in each race group may be either Hispanic or Not Hispanic. Each person has two attributes, their race (or races) and whether or not they are Hispanic.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each racial category may contain '''Non-Hispanic or Latino''' and '''Hispanic or Latino''' Americans. For example: the White (European-American) race category contains Non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanic Whites (see [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans]]); the Black or African-American category contains Non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanic Blacks (see [[Black Hispanic and Latino Americans]]); the Asian-American category contains Non-Hispanic Asians and Hispanic Asians (see [[Asian Hispanic and Latino Americans]]); and likewise for all the other categories.

== Social definitions of race ==
{{See also|African Americans#Identity|Definitions of whiteness in the United States}}

In the United States since its early history, Native Americans, Africans and Europeans were considered to belong to different races. For nearly three centuries, the criteria for membership in these groups were similar, comprising a person's appearance, their social circle (how they lived), and their known non-White ancestry. History played a part, as persons with known slave ancestors were assumed to be African (or, in later usage, black), regardless of whether they also had European ancestry.

The differences between how Native American and Black identities are defined today ([[blood quantum]] versus [[one-drop rule|one-drop]] and political assumptions) have been based on different historical circumstances. According to the [[anthropologist]] Gerald Sider, such racial designations were a means to concentrate power, wealth, privilege and land in the hands of Whites in a society of [[White privilege|White hegemony and privilege]] (Sider 1996; see also Fields 1990). The differences had little to do with biology and more to do with the history of slavery and its [[racism]], and specific forms of [[White supremacy]] (the social, geopolitical and economic agendas of dominant Whites ''vis-à-vis'' subordinate Blacks and Native Americans). They related especially to the different social places which Blacks and Amerindians occupied in White-dominated 19th-century America. Sider suggests that the blood quantum definition of Native American identity enabled mixed-race Whites to acquire Amerindian lands during the allotment process. The one-drop rule of Black identity, enforced legally in the early 20th century, enabled Whites to preserve their agricultural labor force in the South. The contrast emerged because, as peoples transported far from their land and kinship ties on another continent, Black labor was relatively easy to control, and they became reduced to valuable [[commodity|commodities]] as agricultural laborers. In contrast, Amerindian labor was more difficult to control; moreover, Amerindians occupied large territories that became valuable as agricultural lands, especially with the invention of new technologies such as [[railroads]]. Sider thinks the blood quantum definition enhanced White acquisition of Amerindian lands in a doctrine of [[Manifest Destiny]], which subjected Native Americans to marginalization and resulted in numerous conflicts related to American expansionism.

The political economy of race had different consequences for the descendants of aboriginal Americans and African slaves. The 19th-century blood quantum rule meant that it was relatively easier for a person of mixed Euro-Amerindian ancestry to be accepted as White. The offspring of a few generations of intermarriage between Amerindians and Whites likely would not have been considered Amerindian (at least not in a legal sense). Amerindians could have treaty rights to land, but because an individual with only one Amerindian great-grandparent no longer was classified as Amerindian, he lost a legal claim to Amerindian land, under the allotment rules of the day. According to Sider's theory, Whites were more easily able to acquire Amerindian lands. On the other hand, the same individual who could be denied legal standing in a tribe, according to the government, because he was "too White" to claim property rights, might still have enough visually identifiable Amerindian ancestry to be considered socially as a "[[half-breed]]" or breed, and stigmatized by both communities.

The 20th-century one-drop rule made it relatively difficult for anyone of known Black ancestry to be accepted as White. The child of an African-American [[sharecropper]] and a White person was considered Black by the local communities. In terms of the economics of sharecropping, such a person also would likely become a sharecropper as well, thus adding to the landholder or employer's labor force. In short, this theory suggests that in a 20th-century economy that benefited from sharecropping, it was useful to have as many Blacks as possible.

Although some scholars of the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow period]] agree that the 20th-century notion of invisible Blackness shifted the color line in the direction of paleness, and "expanded" the labor force in response to Southern Blacks' [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to the North. But, others (such as the historians [[Joel Williamson]], [[C. Vann Woodward]], [[George M. Fredrickson]], and [[Stetson Kennedy]]) considered the one-drop rule a consequence of the need to define Whiteness as being pure, and justifying White-on-Black oppression.

Over the centuries when Whites wielded power over both Blacks and Amerindians and believed in their inherent superiority over people of color, they created a social order of [[hypodescent]], in which they assigned mixed-race children to the lower-status groups. They were often ignorant of the systems among Native American tribes of social classification, including kinship and hypodescent. The [[Omaha people]], for instance, who had a [[patrilineal]] [[kinship]] system, classified all children with white fathers as "white", and excluded them as members of the clans and tribe, unless one was formally adopted by a male member. Tribal members might care for mixed-race children of white fathers, but considered them outside the hereditary clan and kinship fundamental to tribal society.&lt;ref name="TrueLogan"&gt;[http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ne/topic/resources/OLLibrary/collections/vol19/v19p064.htm Melvin Randolph Gilmore, "The True Logan Fontenelle"], ''Publications of the Nebraska State Historical Society,'' Vol. 19, edited by Albert Watkins, Nebraska State Historical Society, 1919, p. 64, at GenNet, accessed August 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypodescent social construction related to the racial caste that was associated with African slavery and the conditions of the slave societies. It was made explicit by Virginia and other colonies' laws as early as 1662. Virginia incorporated the Roman principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'' into slave law, saying that children of slave mothers were born into their status. Under English common law for subjects, children's social status was determined by the father, not the mother. But the colonists put Africans outside the category of English subjects. Generally, white men were in positions of power to take sexual advantage of black women slaves. But, historian Paul Heinegg has shown that most free African-American families listed in the censuses of 1790–1810 were, in fact, descended from unions between white women and African men in colonial Virginia, from the years when working classes lived and worked closely together, and before slavery had hardened as a racial caste.&lt;ref name="heinegg"&gt;[http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/ Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'', 1995–2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, social and legal conventions developed over time by whites that classified individuals of mixed ancestry into simplified racial categories (Gossett 1997), but these were always porous. The decennial censuses conducted since 1790, after slavery was well established in the United States, included classification of persons by race: white, black, mulatto, and Indian (Nobles 2000). But, the inclusion of [[mulatto]] was an explicit acknowledgement of mixed race. In addition, before the Civil War, Virginia and some other states had legal definition of "whiteness" that provided for people being classified as white if no more than 1/8 black. (For example, if not born into slavery, [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s children by his slave [[Sally Hemings]] would have been classified as legally white, as they were 7/8 white by ancestry. Three of the four surviving children entered white society as adults, and their descendants have identified as white.) In the late 18th and 19th centuries, people of mixed race often migrated to frontiers where societies were more open, and they might be accepted as white if satisfying obligations of citizenship.&lt;ref name="heinegg" /&gt;

The more familiar "[[one-drop rule]]" was not adopted by Virginia and other states until the 20th century, but it classified persons with any known African ancestry as black (Davis 2001). Passage of such laws was often urged by white supremacists and people promoting "racial purity" through eugenics, having forgotten the long history of multi-racial unions in the South that comprised the ancestry of many families.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In other countries in the [[Americas]], where mixing among groups was overtly more extensive, social categories have tended to be more numerous and fluid. In some cases, people may move into or out of categories on the basis of a combination of socioeconomic status, social class, ancestry, and appearance (Mörner 1967).

The term ''[[Hispanic]]'' as an [[ethnonym]] emerged in the 20th century, with the rise of migration of laborers from [[Spanish-speaking countries]] of the western hemisphere to the United States. It includes people who may have been considered racially distinct (Black, White, Amerindian or other mixed groups) in their home countries. Today, the word "Latino" is often used as a synonym for "Hispanic". Even if such categories were earlier understood as racial categories, today they have begun to represent ethno-linguistic categories (regardless of perceived race). Similarly, "[[Anglo]]" is now used among many Hispanics to refer to non-[[Hispanic]] [[White American]]s or [[European American]]s, most of whom speak the English language but are not of primarily [[English people|English]] descent.

== Historical trends and influences ==
The [[United States]] is a racially [[Multiculturalism|diverse]] country. The growth of the Hispanic population through [[immigration]] and high [[birth rates]] is noted as a partial factor for the US' population gains in the last quarter-century. The [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]] revealed that [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] had reached their highest documented population, 4.5 million, since the US was founded in 1776.&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt;

The [[immigrants]] to the [[New World]] came largely from widely separated regions of the [[Old World]]. In the Americas, the immigrant populations began to [[miscegenation|mix]] among themselves and with the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous inhabitants of the continents]]. In the United States, for example, most people who identify as African American have some European ancestors, as revealed by genetic studies. In one analysis of those genetic markers that have differing frequencies between continents, European ancestry ranged from an estimated 7% for a sample of Jamaicans to ~&amp;nbsp;23 % for a sample of African Americans from New Orleans, where there was historically a large class of mixed race (now called [[Louisiana Creoles]]) (Parra ''et al.'' 1998).

In the [[United States]] since its early history, Native Americans, African Americans, and European Americans were classified as belonging to different races. For nearly three centuries, the criteria among whites for membership in these groups were similar, comprising physical appearance, assumption of non-European ancestry, and social circle. The criteria for membership in these races diverged in the late 19th century. During and after [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], after the [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] of [[slaves]] after the Civil War, in the effort to restore [[white supremacy]] in the South, whites began to classify anyone with "[[one-drop theory|one drop]]" of "black blood", or known African ancestry, to be black. Such a legal definition was not put into law until the early 20th century in most southern states, but many established racial segregation of facilities during the [[Jim Crow]] era, after white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] regained control of state legislatures in the South.

Efforts to track mixing between groups led to an earlier proliferation of historical categories (such as "[[mulatto]]" and "[[octaroon]]" among persons with partial African descent) and "blood quantum" distinctions, which became increasingly untethered from self-reported ancestry. In the 20th century, efforts to classify the increasingly mixed population of the United States into discrete categories generated many difficulties (Spickard 1992). By the standards used in past [[censuses]], many mixed-race children born in the United States were classified as of a different race than one of their biological parents. In addition, a person may change personal racial identification over time because of cultural aspects, and self-ascribed race can differ from assigned race (Kressin ''et al.'' 2003).

Until the 2000 census, [[Latinos]] were required to identify as one race, and none was Latino. Partly as a result of the confusion generated by the distinction, 32.9% (U.S. census records) of Latino respondents in the 2000 census ignored the specified racial categories and checked "some other race". (Mays ''et al.'' 2003 claim a figure of 42%)

Historical trends influencing the ethnic [[demographics of the United States]] include:
* '''Patterns of original settlement'''
** [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|settlement of the Americas]] by a variety of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] peoples, including [[Alaska Natives]].
** settlement of Pacific islands by [[Polynesian people]], including [[Native Hawaiians]], [[Samoans]], the [[Chamorro people]] in [[Guam]] and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]].
** settlement of [[Puerto Rico]] by the [[Taíno people]].
** settlement of the [[United States Virgin Islands]] by the [[Ciboney]], [[Island Caribs|Carib]], and [[Arawaks]].
* '''Colonization'''
** Colonization of what is now eastern Canada and the area between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River as [[New France]]. Historical events, including the [[Expulsion of the Acadians]], influenced the ethnic mix, especially in [[Louisiana]], northern [[New England]] and [[New York State]].
** Colonization of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] by the Dutch, British, and later immigrants such as Germans from northern Europe.
** [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]], including Florida, the Southwest, and Puerto Rico, later acquired by the US.
** Denmark and other historical colonial powers influenced the ethnic makeup of what are now the [[United States Virgin Islands]].
* The '''[[Atlantic slave trade]]''', bringing millions of Africans to the South, Caribbean, and Latin America.
* '''Severe reduction of Native American populations''' in the contiguous United States, mostly because of new infectious diseases carried by European colonists, combined with warfare
* '''Forced migration'''
** Deportation and flight of [[United Empire Loyalist]]s to Canada, the Caribbean and Britain after the [[American Revolution]]
** Forced removal of more than one million African Americans in the domestic slave trade from the Upper South to the Deep South during the early 19th century as Americans developed new lands for plantations
** Territorial conflict with Native Americans and the [[Indian removal]] policy of the 19th century displaced many remaining native populations from east of the Mississippi River to territories to the west, especially to what is now Oklahoma.
* '''Immigration'''
** [[History of immigration to the United States|Historical immigration to the United States]] from all countries of the world and throughout the history of the country, for religious, political and economic reasons. Since the late 19th century, the [[History of laws concerning immigration and naturalization in the United States]] and [[illegal immigration to the United States]] have influenced the ethnic balance of that immigration.  Various groups have been denied entry due to discrimination, economic protectionism, and political conflict with their nation of origin. Other groups have received favored status, such as refugees and nationals of allied nations.
** [[Transatlantic migrations]] from Europe, especially in the 19th century, created ethnic enclaves in many eastern cities and settling many rural areas east of the Mississippi
** Immigration from Asia has had the most influence on Hawaii and the West Coast, but has also created predominantly Asian neighborhoods in many major cities across the country.
** Immigration from Mexico and other existing Latino populations has strongly influenced the Southwest.
* '''[[Westward expansion of the United States]]'''
** The [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] restricted the western boundary of European settlement to the watershed east of the Appalachian Mountains; despite the [[Confederation Congress Proclamation of 1783]] and [[Nonintercourse Act]]s prohibiting private purchase of Native American lands, the territory between the Mississippi River and Appalachian Mountains granted to the United States by the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] was gradually opened to white settlers through public purchase of Indian lands.
** The [[Homestead Act]] promoting settlement west of the Mississippi after the [[Louisiana Purchase]]
** [[Utah#The Mormon settlement|Mormon settlement of Utah]]
** [[California Gold Rush]]
** [[Oregon Trail]]
** [[Klondike Gold Rush]] promoting settlement of Alaska
* '''Internal migration'''
** African Americans escaped from slavery, sometimes via the [[Underground Railroad]], reaching the free North before the [[American Civil War]].
** The [[American Industrial Revolution]], promoted urbanization of what was previously a largely agrarian society
** Especially as transportation systems have improved over the centuries, it has become relatively easy for many Americans to move from one part of the country to another, given the lack of internal borders and dominance of English in most areas.  Many do so for reasons of economic opportunity, climate, or culture.
** In the 20th century, to seek jobs and escape racial violence, African Americans left the South in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] and [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]], moving to Northern, Midwestern, and Western cities, where they had to compete with recent European immigrants.
** [[Railroad]]s, promoting migration westwards and [[streetcar suburbs]], created significant ethnic shifts in urban areas.
** Economics and natural disasters have driven migration, for example during the [[Dust Bowl]], [[World War II]], and since the decline of the [[Rust Belt]]
** Suburbanization period after World War II, with "[[white flight]]" to new housing and away from later social unrest, followed by "[[black flight]]"
** The majority of [[Native Hawaiians]] who moved to the mainland U.S. have settled in California.
** Air conditioning has promoted migration from northern areas to the [[Sun Belt]], aided by states' rules against union labor and having low taxes for businesses. The [[Jet Age]] promoted vacationing and part-time living in warmer areas ([[Snowbird (people)|snowbirding]]).

In some cases, immigrants and migrants form [[ethnic enclave]]s; in others, mixture creates ethnically diverse neighborhoods.

== Racial makeup of the U.S. population ==

(For demographics by specific ethnic groups rather than general race, see "Ancestry" below.)

=== White and European Americans ===
{{Main|European Americans|White Americans|White Hispanic and Latino Americans}}
The majority of people currently living in the United States are White and European Americans. The [[United States Census Bureau]] defines [[White people]] as those "having origins in any of the original peoples of [[Europe]], the [[MENA|Middle East, or North Africa]]."&lt;ref name="Census2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf |title=Definition of Race Categories Used in the 2010 Census |date=March 2011 |editors=Karen R. Humes, Nicholas A. Jones, and Roberto R. Ramirez |publisher=United States Census Bureau |page=3 |format=PDF |accessdate=September 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like all official U.S. racial categories, "White" has a [[Non-Hispanic Whites|"not Hispanic or Latino"]] and a [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|"Hispanic or Latino"]] component,&lt;ref name=Census&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/c2kbr01-4.pdf|title=The White Population: 2000|publisher=United States Census Bureau|date=August 2001|accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter consisting mostly of [[White Mexicans|White]] [[Mexican Americans]] and [[White Cubans|White]] [[Cuban Americans]].

[[White Americans]] are the majority in 49 of the 50 states, with Hawaii as the exception. ''Non-Hispanic Whites'' are the majority in 46 states; Hawaii, [[New Mexico]], California, and [[Texas]] (and the District of Columbia) are the exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/population/005514.html |title=Texas Becomes Nation's Newest "Majority-Minority" State, Census Bureau Announces |accessdate=May 5, 2008 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080420121231/http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/population/005514.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = April 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These five jurisdictions have "minority majorities", i.e. minority groups compose the majority of the population.

The non-Hispanic White percentage (63% in 2012&lt;ref name=PEPT4HL /&gt;) tends to decrease every year, and this sub-group is expected to become a [[wikt:plurality|plurality]] of the overall U.S. population after the year 2043. White Americans overall (non-Hispanic Whites together with [[White Hispanics]]) are projected to continue as the majority, at 73.1% (or 303 million out of 420 million) in 2050, from currently 77.1%.

Although a high proportion of the population is known to have multiple ancestries, in the 2000 census, the first with the option to choose more than one, most people still identified with one racial category.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} In the 2000 census, self-identified [[German Americans]] made up 17.1% of the U.S. population, followed by [[Irish Americans]] at 12%, as reported in the 2000 U.S. Census. This makes German and Irish the largest and second-largest self-reported ancestry groups in the United States. Both groups had high rates of [[Immigration to the United States|immigration to the U.S.]] beginning in the mid-19th century, triggered by the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in Ireland and the failed [[German revolutions of 1848–49|1848 Revolution]] in Germany. However, [[English Americans]] and [[British Americans]] are still considered the largest ethnic group due to a serious under count following the 2000 census whereby many English and British Americans self-identified under the new category entry 'American' considering themselves 'indigenous' because their families had resided in the US for so long&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SVoAXh-dNuYC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=Sharing+the+dream:+white+males+in+multicultural+America++english+ancestry&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America] By Dominic J.

Waters, 'Ethnic Groups in Flux: The Changing Ethnic Responses of American Whites', ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', Vol. 487, No. 79 (September 1986), pp. 82-86.&lt;/ref&gt; or, if of mixed European ancestry, identified with a more recent and differentiated ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;Mary C. Waters, ''Ethnic Options: Choosing Identities in America'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

7.2% of the population listed their ancestry as American on the 2000 census (see [[American ethnicity]]). According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the number of people in the U.S. who reported American and no other ancestry increased from 12.4 million in 1990 to 20.2 million in 2000. This change in reporting represented the largest "growth" of any ethnic group in the United States during the 1990s, but it represented how people reported themselves more than growth through birth rates, for instance, and certainly did not reflect immigration.

Most [[French Americans]] are believed descended from colonists of Catholic [[New France]]; exiled [[Huguenot]]s, much fewer in number and settling in the eastern English colonies in the late 1600s and early 1700s, needed to assimilate into the majority culture and have intermarried over generations. [[Isleños in Louisiana|Isleños of Louisiana]] and the [[Hispanos]] of the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] have had, in part, direct Spanish ancestry; most self-reported White Hispanics are of [[Mexican Americans|Mexican]], [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Rican]], and [[Cuban Americans|Cuban]] origins, each of which are multi-ethnic nations. Hispanic immigration has increased from nations of Central and South America.&lt;ref name="PHC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pewhispanic.org/files/reports/35.pdf |format=PDF|title=Shades of Belonging |last=Tafoya |first=Sonya |year=2004 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center|Pew Hispanic Center]] |accessdate=January 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Black and African Americans ===
{{Main|African Americans|Black Hispanic and Latino Americans}}
Black and African Americans are citizens and residents of the United States with origins in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name="IOM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Race, Ethnicity, and Language data - Standardization for Health Care Quality Improvement|url=http://www.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/publications/files/iomracereport.pdf|publisher=Institute of Medicine of the National Academies|accessdate=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Office of Management and Budget]], the grouping includes individuals who self-identify as African-American, as well as persons who emigrated from nations in the [[Caribbean]] and Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="2010USCBAA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-06.pdf |title=The Black Population: 2010 |author=Sonya Tastogi |author2=Tallese D.

According to US Census Bureau data, very few [[African immigration to the United States|African immigrants]] self-identify as African-American. On average, less than 5% of African residents self-reported as "African-American" or "Afro-American" on the 2000 US Census. The overwhelming majority of African immigrants (~95%) identified instead with their own respective ethnicities. Self-designation as "African-American" or "Afro-American" was highest among individuals from West Africa (4%-9%), and lowest among individuals from Cape Verde, East Africa and Southern Africa (0%-4%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kusow|first1=AM|title=African Immigrants in the United States: Implications for Affirmative Action|url=http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1005&amp;context=soc_las_pubs|publisher=Iowa State University|accessdate=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, African immigrants often develop very successful professional and business working-relationships with African-Americans.

In 2008, "[[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino origin]]" was the self-identification of 47 million Americans. They chiefly have origins in the Spanish-speaking nations of Latin America. Very few also come from other places, for example: 0.2% of Hispanic and Latino Americans were born in Asia.&lt;ref name=popprofile&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.factfinder.census.gov/servlet/IPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-geo_id=NBSP&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_S0201&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_S0201PR&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_S0201T&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_S0201TPR&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_&amp;-reg=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_S0201:400;ACS_2008_1YR_G00_S0201PR:400;ACS_2008_1YR_G00_S0201T:400;ACS_2008_1YR_G00_S0201TPR:400&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-format= |title=United States – Selected Population Profile in the United States (Hispanic or Latino (of any race)) |work=2008 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=April 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group is heterogeneous in race and national ancestry.

The Census Bureau defines "Hispanic or Latino origin" thus:
{{cquote
|For Census 2000, American Community Survey: People who identify with the terms "Hispanic" or "Latino" are those who classify themselves in one of the specific Hispanic or Latino categories listed on the Census 2000 or ACS questionnaire - "Mexican," "Puerto Rican," or "Cuban" - as well as those who indicate that they are "other Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino." Origin can be viewed as the heritage, nationality group, lineage, or country of birth of the person, or the person's parents or ancestors, before their arrival in the United States. People who identify their origin as Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino may be of any race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://factfinder.census.gov/help/en/hispanic_or_latino_origin.htm |title=American FactFinder Help; Hispanic or Latino origin |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=September 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The leading country-of-origin for Hispanic Americans is Mexico (30.7 million), followed by Puerto Rico (4.2 million) (which actually has a special relationship with the US, of which its people are citizens), and Cuba (1.6 million), as of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;-context=dt&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_&amp;-mt_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G2000_C03001&amp;-CONTEXT=dt&amp;-tree_id=306&amp;-redoLog=true&amp;-currentselections=ACS_2006_EST_G2000_B02001&amp;-currentselections=ACS_2006_EST_G2000_B02003&amp;-currentselections=ACS_2006_EST_G2000_C02003&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-search_results=01000US&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en |title=C03001.

62.4% of Hispanic and Latino Americans identified as white.&lt;ref name=b03002regions /&gt; 30.5% identified as "some other race" (other than the ones listed). According to the PEP &lt;!--what is this? Not sourced and not referenced--&gt; 91.9% of Latinos are white, as these official estimates do not recognize "some other race".&lt;ref name=PEPT4HL /&gt; In the official estimates, Black or African American Hispanics are the second-largest group, with 1.9 million, or 4.0% of the whole group. The remaining Hispanics are accounted as follows, first per the PEP: 1.6% American Indian and Alaska Native, 1.5% two or more races, 0.7% Asian, and 0.03% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander. Per the ACS: 3.9% two or more races, 1.9% Black or African American, 1.0% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.4% Asian, and 0.05% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander.&lt;ref name=b03002regions /&gt;

In the United States the Hispanic and Latino population has reached 58 million in 2016. According to Pew Research Center the Latino population has been the principal driver of United States demographic growth since 2000. Mexicans make up most of the Hispanic and Latino population 35,758,000. There is also a growth of Hispanics who are receiving a college education in 2015, 40% of Hispanics age 25 and older have had a college experience. In 2000 the percentage was at a low 30%. In all the 50 US states California houses the largest population percentage of Latinos. In 2015, 15.2 million Hispanics lived in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/18/how-the-u-s-hispanic-population-is-changing/|title=How the U.S. Hispanic population is changing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hispanic or Latino population is young and fast-growing, due to immigration and higher birth rates.&lt;ref name=popprofile /&gt; For decades it has contributed significantly to U.S. population increases, and this is expected to continue.

Their histories are diverse. As with the new immigration from central and eastern Europe to the East Coast from the mid-19th century on, [[Asian immigration to the United States|Asians started immigrating to the United States]] in large numbers in the 19th century. This first major wave of immigration consisted predominantly of [[Chinese American|Chinese]] and [[Japanese American|Japanese]] laborers, but also included [[Korean Americans|Korean]] and South Asian immigrants. Many immigrants also came during and after this period from the [[Philippines]], which was [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|a US colony]] from 1898 to 1946. Exclusion laws and policies largely prohibited and curtailed Asian immigration until the 1940s. After the US changed its immigration laws during the 1940s to 1960s to make entry easier, a much larger new wave of immigration from Asia began. Today the largest self-identified Asian American sub-groups according to census data are [[Chinese Americans]], [[Filipino Americans]], [[Indian Americans]], [[Vietnamese Americans]], [[Korean Americans]], and [[Japanese Americans]], [[Demographics of Asian Americans|among other groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/asianamericans-graphics/|title=Asian Americans|date=June 18, 2012|website=Pew Research Center's Social &amp; Demographic Trends Project|access-date=June 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Native Americans and Alaska Natives ===
{{Main|Native Americans in the United States|Alaska Natives}}
[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]], particularly [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], made up 0.8% of the population in 2008, numbering 2.4 million.&lt;ref name=b02001 /&gt; An additional 2.3 million persons declared part-[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] or [[Alaska Native]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;-context=dt&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_&amp;-mt_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G2000_B02010&amp;-CONTEXT=dt&amp;-tree_id=306&amp;-redoLog=true&amp;-currentselections=ACS_2006_EST_G2000_B02001&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-geo_id=02000US1&amp;-geo_id=02000US2&amp;-geo_id=02000US3&amp;-geo_id=02000US4&amp;-search_results=01000US&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en |title=B02010.

The legal and official designation of who is Native American has aroused controversy by demographers, tribal nations, and government officials for many decades. [[Federally recognized tribes]] and [[state recognized tribes]] set their own membership requirements; tribal enrollment may require residency on a reservation, documented [[lineal descent]] from recognized records, such as the [[Dawes Rolls]], and other criteria. Some tribes have adopted the use of blood quantum, requiring members to have a certain percentage. The federal government requires individuals to certify documented blood quantum of ancestry for certain federal programs, such as education benefits, available to members of recognized tribes. But Census takers accept any respondent's identification. [[Genetics|Genetic]] scientists estimated that more than 15 million other Americans, including African Americans and Hispanic Americans (specifically those of Mexican heritage), may have up to one quarter of American Indian ancestry.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Once thought to face extinction as a race or culture, Native Americans of numerous tribes have achieved revival of aspects of their cultures, together with asserting their sovereignty and direction of their own affairs since the mid-20th century. Many have started language programs to revive use of traditional languages; some have established [[tribally controlled colleges]] and other schools on their reservations, so that education is expressive of their cultures. Since the late 20th century, many tribes have developed [[gaming casinos]] on their sovereign land to raise revenues for economic development, as well as to promote the education and welfare of their people through health care and construction of improved housing.

Today more than 800,000 to one million persons claim [[Cherokee descent]] in part or as full-bloods; of these, an estimated 300,000 live in California, 70,000—160,000 in [[Oklahoma]], and 15,000 in [[North Carolina]] in ancestral homelands. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;!--clarify – are these official tribal figures or Census self-identifiers?--&gt;

The second largest tribal group is the [[Navajo people|Navajo]], who call themselves Diné and live on a 16-million acre (65,000&amp;nbsp;km²) [[Indian reservation]] covering northeast [[Arizona]], northwest [[New Mexico]], and southeast [[Utah]]. It is home to half of the 450,000 [[Navajo Nation]] members.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The third largest group are the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] ([[Sioux]]) Nation, with distinct federally recognized tribes located in the states of [[Minnesota]], [[Nebraska]], [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]]; and [[North Dakota|North]] and [[South Dakota]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;!--clarify – are these official tribal figures or Census self-identifiers?--&gt;

=== Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders ===

More than half identify as "full-blooded", but historically most Native Hawaiians on the island chain of [[Hawaii]] are believed to have admixture with Asian and European ancestries.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} But, the Census takes reporting by individuals as to how they identify.

Some demographers believe that by the year 2025, the last full-blooded Native Hawaiian will die off, leaving a culturally distinct, but racially mixed population.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The total number of persons who have identified as Native Hawaiian in 2008 was more than the estimated Hawaiian population when the US annexed the islands in 1898.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Native Hawaiians are receiving ancestral land [[reparation (legal)|reparations]]. Throughout Hawaii, they are working to preserve and assert adaptation of Native Hawaiian customs and the [[Hawaiian language]]. They have cultural schools solely for legally Native Hawaiian students.

The United States Census Bureau is presently finalizing the ethnic classification of MENA populations. In 2012, prompted in part by post-9/11 discrimination, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee petitioned the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency to designate the MENA populations as a minority/disadvantaged community.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/13/stateline-census-mena-africa-mideast/13999239/ "Lobbying for a 'MENA' category on U.S. Census"] Wiltz, Teresea.

Census 2000 Brief |accessdate=May 8, 2008 |last=Jones |first=Nicholas A. |author2=Amy Symens Smith  |format=PDF |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. has a growing multiracial identity movement.

While the colonies and southern states protected white fathers by making all children born to slave mothers be classified as slaves, regardless of paternity, they also banned [[miscegenation]] or [[interracial marriage]], most notably between whites and blacks. This did little to stop interracial relationships, except as legal, consensual unions.

Demographers state that, due to new waves of immigration, the American people through the early 20th century were mostly multi-ethnic descendants of various immigrant nationalities, who maintained cultural distinctiveness until, over time, [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], migration and [[Racial integration|integration]] took place.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The [[Civil Rights Movement]] through the 20th century gained passage of important legislation to enforce constitutional rights of minorities.

According to James P. Allen and Eugene Turner from [[California State University, Northridge]], by some calculations in the 2000 Census, the multiracial population that is part white (which is the largest percentage of the multiracial population), is as follows:
* white/Native American and Alaskan Native, at 7,015,017,
* white/black at 737,492,
* white/Asian at 727,197, and
* white/Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander at 125,628.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csupomona.edu/~mreibel/2000_Census_Files/Allen-Turner.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002234040/http://www.csupomona.edu/~mreibel/2000_Census_Files/Allen-Turner.doc |archivedate=October 2, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Genetic admixture====
A 2002 study found an average of 18.6% European genetic contribution and 2.7% Native American genetic contribution (with standard errors 1.5% and 1.4% respectively) in a sample of 232 [[African Americans]]. Meanwhile, in a sample of 187 [[European Americans]] from [[State College, Pennsylvania]], there was an average of 0.7% West African genetic contribution and 3.2% Native American genetic contribution (with standard errors 0.9% and 1.6% respectively). Most of the non-European admixture was concentrated in 30% of the sample, with West African admixture ranging from 2 to 20%, with an average of 2.3%.&lt;ref name="Shriver03"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=[[Mark D. Shriver]] et al.|title=Skin pigmentation, biogeographical ancestry and admixture mapping|journal=Human Genetics|date=2003|volume=112|issue=4|pages=387–399|doi=10.1007/s00439-002-0896-y|pmid=12579416|url=https://homepages.uc.edu/~nortonhr/MoCHA/Publications_files/Shriver%20et%20el%202003.pdf|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 Robert Stuckert produced a statistical analysis using historical census data and immigration statistics. He concluded that the growth in the White population could not be attributed solely to births in the White population and immigration from Europe, but was also due to people identifying as white who were partly black. He concluded that 21 percent of white Americans had some recent African-American ancestors. He also concluded that the majority of Americans of known African descent were partly European and not entirely sub-Saharan African.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/1811/4532/1/V58N03_155.pdf |title=Robert Stuckert, "African Ancestry Of The White American Population" |format=PDF |accessdate=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, many different DNA studies have shown that many African Americans have European admixture, reflecting the long history in this country of the various populations. Proportions of European admixture in African-American DNA have been found in studies to be 17 %&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Collins-Schramm | first1 = Heather E. | year = 2002 | title = Markers that Discriminate Between European and African Ancestry Show Limited Variation Within Africa | url = | journal = Human Genetics | volume = 111 | issue = 6| pages = 566–69 | doi=10.1007/s00439-002-0818-z | pmid=12436248}}&lt;/ref&gt; and between 10.6% and 22.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parra | first1 = Esteban J. | authorlink11 = Mark D.

The Race, Ethnicity, and Genetics Working Group of the [[National Human Genome Research Institute]] notes that "although genetic analyses of large numbers of loci can produce estimates of the percentage of a person's ancestors coming from various continental populations, these estimates may assume a false distinctiveness of the parental populations, since human groups have exchanged mates from local to continental scales throughout history."&lt;ref name="REGWG"&gt;{{Cite journal |pmc = 1275602|year = 2005|author1=Race, Ethnicity, and Genetics Working Group|title = The Use of Racial, Ethnic, and Ancestral Categories in Human Genetics Research|journal = American Journal of Human Genetics|volume = 77|issue = 4|pages = 519–532|pmid = 16175499|doi = 10.1086/491747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Members of other races ===
{{Expand section||small=no|date=June 2016}}
In the 2000 census, the non-standard category of "Other"&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt; was especially intended to capture responses such as [[Mestizo]] and [[Mulatto]],&lt;ref name="racefactcb" /&gt; two large multiracial groups in most of the countries of origin of Hispanic and Latino Americans. However, many other responses are captured by the category.

In 2008 15.0 million people, nearly 5% of the total U.S. population, were estimated to be "some other race",&lt;ref name=b02001 /&gt; with 95% of them being Hispanic or Latino.&lt;ref name=b03002regions /&gt;

Due to this category's non-standard status, statistics from government agencies other than the Census Bureau (for example: the [[Centers for Disease Control]]'s data on [[vital statistics (government records)|vital statistics]], or the [[FBI]]'s crime statistics), but also the Bureau's own official Population Estimates, omit the "some other race" category and include most of the people in this group in the white population, thus including the vast majority (about 90%) of Hispanic and Latino Americans in the white population. For an example of this, see [[The World Factbook]], published by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html |title=CIA – The World Factbook -- United States |accessdate=May 8, 2008 |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancestry ==
The ancestry of the people of the [[United States|United States of America]] is widely varied and includes descendants of [[population]]s from around the [[world]]. In addition to its variation, the ancestry of people of the United States is also marked by varying amounts of [[interracial marriage|intermarriage]] between [[ethnic group|ethnic]] and [[Race (human classification)|racial]] groups.

While some Americans can trace their ancestry back to a single ethnic group or population in [[Europe]], [[Africa]], or [[Asia]], these are often first- and second-generation Americans.  Generally, the degree of mixed heritage increases the longer one's ancestors have lived in the United States (see [[melting pot]]). In theory, there are several means available to discover the ancestry of the people residing in the United States, including [[genealogy]], [[genetics]], [[Oral history|oral]] [[History|and written history]], and analysis of [[United States Census|Federal Population Census]] schedules. In practice, only few of these have been used for a larger part of the population.

:''This article covers the time period from November 1859 to April 1861.
The immediate '''reactions to ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''''', the book in which [[Charles Darwin]] described [[Evolution|evolution by natural selection]], included international debate, though the heat of controversy was less than that over earlier works such as ''[[Vestiges of Creation]]''. Darwin monitored the debate closely, cheering on [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]'s battles with [[Richard Owen]] to remove clerical domination of the scientific establishment. While Darwin's illness kept him away from the public debates, he read eagerly about them and mustered support through [[correspondence of Charles Darwin|correspondence]].

Religious views were mixed, with the [[Church of England]]'s scientific establishment reacting against the book, while [[liberal Christianity|liberal Anglicans]] strongly supported Darwin's [[natural selection]] as an instrument of God's design. Religious controversy was soon diverted by the publication of ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'' and debate over the [[higher criticism]].

The most famous confrontation took place at the public [[1860 Oxford evolution debate]] during a meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], when the [[Bishop of Oxford]] [[Samuel Wilberforce]] argued against Darwin's explanation. In the ensuing debate [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] argued strongly in favor of Darwinian evolution.  [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Thomas Huxley's]] support of evolution was so intense that the media and public nicknamed him "Darwin's bulldog". Huxley became the fiercest defender of the evolutionary theory on the Victorian stage. Both sides came away feeling victorious, but Huxley went on to depict the debate as pivotal in a struggle between religion and science and used ''[[Darwinism]]'' to campaign against the authority of the clergy in education, as well as daringly advocating the "Ape Origin of Man".

==Background==

Darwin's ideas developed rapidly after returning from [[the Voyage of the Beagle]] in 1836. By December 1838, he had developed the basic principles of his theory. At that time, similar ideas brought others disgrace and association with the revolutionary mob.{{vague|date=January 2016}} He was conscious of the need to answer all likely objections before publishing.  While he continued with research, he had an immense amount of work in hand analyzing and publishing findings from the Beagle expedition, and was repeatedly delayed by illness.

Natural history at that time was dominated by clerical naturalists who saw their science as revealing God's plan, and whose income came from the Established [[Church of England]].{{citation needed|date= January 2016}} Darwin found three close allies. The eminent geologist [[Charles Lyell]], whose books had influenced the young Darwin during [[the Voyage of the Beagle]], befriended Darwin who he saw as a supporter of his ideas of gradual geological processes with continuing divine Creation of species. By the 1840s Darwin became friends with the young botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker who had followed his father into the science, and after going on a survey voyage used his contacts to eventually find a position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=313–320, 325–326}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s Darwin met [[Thomas Huxley]], an ambitious naturalist who had returned from a long survey trip but lacked the family wealth or contacts to find a career&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=403–404}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who joined the progressive group around [[Herbert Spencer]] looking to make science a profession, freed from the clerics.

This was also a time of intense conflict over religious morality in England, where [[evangelicalism]] led to increasing professionalism of clerics who had previously been expected to act as country gentlemen with wide interests, but now were seriously focussed on expanded religious duties. A new orthodoxy proclaimed the virtues of truth but also inculcated beliefs that the Bible should be read literally and that religious doubt was in itself sinful so should not be discussed. Science was also becoming professional and a series of discoveries cast doubt on literal interpretations of the Bible and the honesty of those denying the findings. A series of crises erupted with fierce debate and criticism over issues such as [[George Combe]]'s ''[[The Constitution of Man]]'' and the anonymous ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'' which converted vast popular audiences to the belief that natural laws controlled the development of nature and society. German [[higher criticism]] questioned the Bible as a historical document in contrast to the evangelical creed that every word was divinely inspired. Dissident clergymen even began questioning accepted premises of Christian morality, and [[Benjamin Jowett]]'s 1855 commentary on St. Paul brought a storm of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Altholz|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By September 1854 Darwin's other books reached a stage where he was able to turn his attention fully to ''Species'', and from this point he was working to publish his theory. On 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] enclosing about twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism that was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin put matters in the hands of his friends Lyell and Hooker, who agreed on a joint presentation to the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]] on 1 July 1858. Their papers were entitled, collectively, ''[[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection]]''.

===Publication of ''The Origin of Species''===
{{see also|Publication of Darwin's theory}}
Darwin now worked on an "abstract" trimmed from his ''Natural Selection'' manuscript. The publisher [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] agreed the title as ''[[the Origin of Species|On the Origin of Species through Natural Selection]]'' and the book went on sale to the trade on 22 November 1859.  The stock of 1,250 copies was oversubscribed, and Darwin, still at [[Ilkley]] [[spa town]], began corrections for a second edition. The novelist [[Charles Kingsley]], a Christian socialist country rector, sent him a letter of praise: "It awes me...if you be right I must give up much that I have believed", it was "just as noble a conception of Deity, to believe that He created primal forms capable of self development... as to believe that He required a fresh act of intervention to supply the lacunas which he himself had made."&lt;ref name=Letter2534&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2534.html | title=Letter 2534 – Kingsley, Charles to Darwin, C.

&lt;ref name=B87&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; (by [[John Leifchild]], published anonymously, as was the custom at that time) was quick to pick out the unstated implications of "men from monkeys"  already controversial from ''[[Vestiges of Creation|Vestiges]]'', saw snubs to theologians, summing up Darwin's "creed" as man "was born yesterday – he will perish tomorrow" and concluded that "The work deserves attention, and will, we have no doubt, meet with it. Scientific naturalists will take up the author upon his own peculiar ground; and there will we imagine be a severe struggle for at least theoretical existence. Theologians will say—and they have a right to be heard—Why construct another elaborate theory to exclude Deity from renewed acts of creation? Why not at once admit that new species were introduced by the Creative energy of the Omnipotent? Why not accept direct interference, rather than evolutions of law, and needlessly indirect or remote action? Having introduced the author and his work, we must leave them to the mercies of the Divinity Hall, the College, the Lecture Room, and the Museum."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leifchild|1859}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Ilkley, Darwin raged "But the manner in which he drags in immortality, &amp; sets the Priests at me, &amp; leaves me to their mercies, is base. He would on no account burn me; but he will get the wood ready and tell the black beasts how to catch me."&lt;ref name="Letter=2542"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2542.html | title= Letter 2542 – Darwin, C.

D., 22 Nov 1859 | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin sprained an ankle and his health worsened, as he wrote to friends it was "odious".&lt;ref name=B87/&gt;

By 9 December when Darwin left [[Ilkley]] to come home, he had been told that Murray was organising a second run of 3,000 copies.&lt;ref name="Letter=2570"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2570.html | title= Letter 2570 – Darwin, C. R. to Murray, John (b), 4 Dec (1859) | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooker had been "converted", Lyell was "absolutely gloating" and Huxley wrote "with such tremendous praise", advising that he was sharpening his "beak and claws" to disembowel "the curs who will bark and yelp".&lt;ref name="Letter=2544"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2544.html | title= Letter 2544 – Huxley, T. H. to Darwin, C.

===First response===
[[Richard Owen]] had been the first to respond to the complimentary copies, courteously claiming that he had long believed that "existing influences" were responsible for the "ordained" birth of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2526.html | title= Letter 2526 – Owen, Richard to Darwin, C. R., 12 Nov (1859) | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin now had long talks with him, and told Lyell that "Under garb of great civility, he was inclined to be most bitter &amp; sneering against me. Yet I infer from several expressions, that ''at bottom'' he goes immense way with us." Owen was furious at being included among those defending immutability of species, and in effect said that the book offered the best explanation "ever published of the manner of formation of species", though he did not agree with it in all respects.&lt;ref name="Letter 2575"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-2575 | title= Letter 2575 – Darwin, C. R. to Lyell, Charles, (10 Dec 1859) | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project }}&lt;/ref&gt; He still had the gravest doubts that transmutation would bestialise man. It appears that Darwin had assured Owen that he was looking at everything as resulting from designed laws, which Owen interpreted as showing a shared belief in "Creative Power".

Darwin had already made his views clearer to others, telling Lyell that if each step in evolution was providentially planned, the whole procedure would be a miracle and natural selection superfluous.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2507.html | title= Letter 2507 – Darwin, C. R. to Lyell, Charles, 20 Oct (1859) | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had also sent a copy to [[John Herschel]], and on 10 December he told Lyell of having "heard by round about channel that Herschel says my Book "is the law of higgledy-piggledy".– What this exactly means I do not know, but it is evidently very contemptuous.– If true this is great blow &amp; discouragement."&lt;ref name="Letter 2575"/&gt; Darwin subsequently corresponded with Herschel, and in January 1861 Herschel added a footnote to the draft of his ''Physical Geography''  which, while disparaging "the principle of arbitrary and casual variation and natural selection" as insufficient without "intelligent direction", said that "with some demur as to the genesis of man, we are far from disposed to repudiate the view taken of this mysterious subject in Mr. Darwin's book."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1903|pp= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=235&amp;itemID=F1548.1&amp;viewtype=side 190–191]}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-3154 |title=Darwin, C.

===Geological time===
It was known that the [[geologic time scale]] was "incomprehensibly vast", if unquantifiable. From 1848 Darwin discussed data with [[Andrew Ramsay (geologist)|Andrew Ramsay]], who had said "it is vain to attempt to measure the duration of even small portions of geological epochs." A chapter of Lyell's ''[[Principles of Geology]]'' described the enormous amount of erosion involved in forming the [[Weald]].{{sfn|Herbert|2005|pp=350–351}} To demonstrate the time available for natural selection to operate, Darwin drew on Lyell's example and Ramsay's data in chapter 9 of ''On the Origin of Species'' to estimate that erosion of the Weald's layered dome of [[Cretaceous|Lower Cretaceous rocks]] “must have required 306,662,400 years; or say three hundred million years“.{{sfn|Darwin|Costa|2009|pp=284–287}} 

The "necessary corrections" Darwin made to his drafts for the second edition of the ''Origin'' were based on comments from others, particularly Lyell, and added a caveat suggesting a faster rate of erosion of the Weald:{{sfn | Burchfield | 1974 | pp=303–304}} "perhaps it would be safer to allow two or three inches per century, and this would reduce the number of years to one hundred and fifty or one hundred million years."{{sfn|Darwin|Costa|2009|p= 287}}{{sfn|Darwin|1860|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=305&amp;itemID=F376&amp;viewtype=text 287]}} Copies of the second edition were advertised as ready on 24 December, in advance of official publication on 7 January 1860.{{sfn|Freeman|1977a}}

The ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]'' of 24 December 1859 strongly criticised the methodology of Darwin's calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Anon (24 December 1859) [Review of] [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=2&amp;itemID=A514&amp;viewtype=text On the origin of species], ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]'', pp. 775–776.&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 January 1860, Darwin wrote to Hooker about it: "Some of the remarks about the lapse of years are very good, &amp; the Reviewer gives me some good &amp; well deserved raps,—confound it I am sorry to confess the truth. But it does not at all concern main argument."&lt;ref name="Letter no. 2635"&gt;{{cite web |title=Letter no. 2635; Darwin, C.R. to Hooker, J.D. | website=Darwin Correspondence Project | date=3 January 1860 | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/DCP-LETT-2635.xml | accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day later, he said to Lyell "You saw I suppose Saturday Review: argument confined to Geology, but has given me some perfectly just &amp; severe raps on knuckles."&lt;ref name="Letter no. 2637"&gt;{{cite web |title=Letter no. 2637; Darwin, C.R. to Lyell, C | website=Darwin Correspondence Project | date=4 January 1860 | url=https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/DCP-LETT-2637.xml | accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the third edition published on 30 April 1861, Darwin cited the ''Saturday Review'' article as reason to remove his calculation altogether.&lt;ref name="CD Journal 1860" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OtOOS 61 xii"&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1861|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=19&amp;itemID=F381&amp;viewtype=text xii]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friendly reviews===
The December 1859 review in the British [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] ''[[National Review (1855)|National Review]]'' was written by Darwin's old friend [[William Benjamin Carpenter|William Carpenter]], who was clear that only a world of "order, continuity, and progress" befitted an Omnipotent Deity and that "any theological objection" to a species of slug or a breed of dog deriving from a previous one was "simply absurd" dogma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carpenter|1859}}&lt;/ref&gt; He touched on human evolution, satisfied that the struggle for existence tended "inevitably... towards the progressive exaltation of the races engaged in it".

On [[Boxing Day]] (26 December) ''[[The Times]]'' carried an anonymous review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1859}}&lt;/ref&gt; The staff reviewer, "as innocent of any knowledge of science as a babe", gave the task to Huxley, leading Darwin to ask his friend how "did you influence Jupiter Olympus and make him give three and a half columns to pure science? The old fogies will think the world will come to an end." Darwin treasured the piece more than "a dozen reviews in common periodicals", but noted "Upon my life I am sorry for Owen... he will be so d—d savage, for credit given to any other man, I strongly suspect, is in his eyes so much credit robbed from him. Science is so narrow a field, it is clear there ought to be only one cock of the walk!".&lt;ref name="Letter=2611"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2611.html | title= Letter 2611 – Darwin, C. R. to Huxley, T. H., 28 Dec (1859) | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooker also wrote a favourable review, which appeared at the end of December in the ''Gardener's Chronicle'' and treated the theory as an extension of horticultural lore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hooker|1859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clerical concern, atheist enthusiasm===
In his lofty position at the head of Science, Owen received numerous complaints about the book. The [[Adam Sedgwick|Revd. Adam Sedgwick]], geologist at the [[University of Cambridge]] who had taken Darwin on his first geology field trip, could not see the point in a world without providence. The missionary [[David Livingstone]] could see no struggle for existence on the [[Savanna|African plains]]. [[Jeffries Wyman]] at [[Harvard]] saw no truth in chance variations.

The most enthusiastic response came from atheists, with [[Hewett Watson]] hailing Darwin as the "greatest revolutionist in natural history of this century".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2540.html | title= Letter 2540 – Watson, H. C. to Darwin, C. R., 21 Nov (1859) | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 68-year-old [[Robert Edmund Grant]], who had shown him the study of invertebrates when Darwin was a student at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and who was still teaching [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarckian]] evolution weekly at [[University College London]], brought out a small book on classification dedicated to Darwin: "With one fell-sweep of the wand of truth, you have now scattered to the winds the pestilential vapours accumulated by 'species-mongers'."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-3150.html | title= Letter 3150 – Grant, R. E. to Darwin, C. R., 16 May 1861 | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Widespread interest==
In January 1860, Darwin told Lyell of a reported incident at [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo Bridge Station]]: "I never till to day realised that it was getting widely distributed; for in a letter from a lady today to Emma, she says she heard a man enquiring for it at Railway Station!!! at Waterloo Bridge; &amp; the Bookseller said that he had none till new Edit. was out.— The Bookseller said he had not read it but had heard it was a very remarkable book!!!"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2650.html | title= Letter 2650 – Darwin, C. R. to Lyell, Charles, 14 Jan (1860) | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asa Gray in the United States===
In December 1859 the [[Botany|botanist]] [[Asa Gray]] negotiated with a Boston publisher for publication of an authorised American version, however, he learnt that two New York publishing firms were already planning to exploit the absence of international [[copyright]] to print ''Origin''.&lt;ref name=Letter2592&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2592.html#mark-2592.f3 |title=Letter 2592 – Darwin, C.

Appleton &amp; Company|Appleton's]] of New York,&lt;ref name=Letter2706&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2706.html |title=Letter 2706 – Gray, Asa to Darwin, C.

In a May letter Darwin mentioned a print run of 2,500 copies, but it is not clear if this was the first printing alone as there were four that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FreemanOTOOS&gt;{{citation |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_OntheOriginofSpecies.html |title=Darwin Online: On the Origin of Species |author= |authorlink= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |quote= |accessdate=6 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When sending his ''Historical preface'' and corrections for the American edition in February, Darwin thanked Asa Gray for his comments, as "a Review from a man, who is not an entire convert, if fair &amp;  moderately favourable, is in all respects the best kind of Review. About weak points I agree. The [[Evolution of the eye|eye]] to this day gives me a cold shudder, but when I think of the fine known gradations, my reason tells me I ought to conquer the cold shudder."&lt;ref name=Letter2701&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2701.html |title=Letter 2701 – Darwin, C. R. to Gray, Asa, (8–9 Feb 1860) | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April he continued, "It is curious that I remember well time when the thought of the eye made me cold all over, but I have got over this stage of the complaint, &amp; now small trifling particulars of structure often make me very uncomfortable. The sight of a feather in a peacock's tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!"&lt;ref name=Letter2743&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2743.html |title=Letter 2743 – Darwin, C. R. to Gray, Asa, 3 Apr (1860) | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later Darwin emphasised that he was bewildered by the [[theology|theological]] aspects and "had no intention to write atheistically, ''but could not'' see, as plainly as others do, &amp; as I sh&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; wish to do, evidence of design &amp; beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars" – expressing his particular revulsion at the [[Ichneumonidae]] family of parasitic wasps that lay their eggs in the larvae and pupae of other insects so that their [[parasitoid]] young have a ready source of food. He therefore could not believe in the necessity of design, but rather than attributing the wonders of the universe to brute force was "inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance. Not that this notion at all satisfies me. I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton" – referring to [[Isaac Newton]].&lt;ref name="Letter=2814"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2814.html | title= Letter 2814 – Darwin, C. R. to Gray, Asa, 22 May (1860) | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erasmus and Martineau===
Darwin's brother [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin|Erasmus]] reported on 23 November that their cousin [[Sir Henry Holland, 1st Baronet|Henry Holland]] was reading the book and in "a dreadful state of indecision", sure that explaining the eye would be "utterly impossible", but after reading it "he hummed &amp; hawed &amp; perhaps it was partly conceivable". Erasmus himself thought it "the most interesting book I ever read",&lt;ref name="Letter no. 2545"&gt;{{cite web |title=Letter no. 2545; Darwin, E.A., to Darwin, C.R. | website=Darwin Correspondence Project | date=23 November 1859 | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/DCP-LETT-2545.xml | accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sent a copy to his old flame Miss [[Harriet Martineau]] who, at 58, was still reviewing from her home in the [[Lake District]].  Martineau sent her thanks, adding that she had previously praised "the quality &amp; conduct of your brother's mind, but it is an unspeakable satisfaction to see here the full manifestation of its earnestness &amp; simplicity, its sagacity, its industry, &amp; the patient power by w&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;. it has collected such a mass of facts, to transmute them by such sagacious treatment into such portentious knowledge. I sh&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;. much like to know how large a proportion of our scientific men believe he has found a sound road."&lt;ref&gt;Spelling and abbreviations as {{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=486.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing to her fellow [[Thomas Malthus|Malthusian]] (and atheist) [[George Holyoake]] she enthused, "What a book it is! – overthrowing (if true) revealed Religion on the one hand, &amp; Natural (as far as Final Causes &amp; Design are concerned) on the other. The range &amp; mass of knowledge take away one's breath."  To [[Darwin-Wedgwood family#Josiah Wedgwood 2|Fanny Wedgwood]] &lt;!-- No Wikipedia article on Fanny Wedgwood at this time": If one is created please change this link.--&gt; she wrote, "I rather regret that C.D. went out of his way two or three times to speak of "The Creator" in the popular sense of the First Cause.... His subject is the 'Origin of Species' &amp; not the origin of Organisation; &amp; it seems a needless mischief to have opened the latter speculation at all – There now! I have delivered my mind."

===Clerical reaction===
The Revd. [[Adam Sedgwick]] had received his copy "with more pain than pleasure."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2548.html | title= Letter 2548 – Sedgwick, Adam to Darwin, C. R., 24 Nov 1859 | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without Creation showing divine love, "humanity, to my mind, would suffer a damage that might brutalise it, and sink the human race..." He indicated that unless Darwin accepted God's revelation in nature and scripture, Sedgwick would not meet Darwin in heaven, a sentiment that upset [[Emma Darwin|Emma]]. The Revd. [[John Stevens Henslow]], the botany professor whose natural history course Charles had joined thirty years earlier, gave faint praise to the ''Origin'' as "a stumble in the right direction" but distanced himself from its conclusions, "a question past our finding out..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henslow|1861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anglican]] establishment predominantly opposed Darwin. [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston]], who became Prime Minister in June 1859, mooted Darwin's name to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] as a candidate for the Honours List with the prospect of a [[knight]]hood. While [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] supported the idea, after the publication of the ''Origin'' Queen Victoria's ecclesiastical advisers, including the [[Bishop of Oxford]] [[Samuel Wilberforce]], dissented and the request was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 488}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Anglicans were more in favour, and Huxley reported of Kingsley that "He is an excellent Darwinian to begin with, and told me a capital story of his reply to Lady Aylesbury who expressed astonishment at his favouring such a heresy – 'What can be more delightful to me Lady Aylesbury, than to know that your Ladyship &amp; myself sprang from the same toad stool.' Whereby the frivolous old woman shut up, in doubt whether she was being chaffed or adored for her remark."

There was no official comment from the [[Holy See|Vatican]] for several decades, but in 1860 a council of the German Catholic bishops pronounced that the belief that "man as regards his body, emerged finally from the spontaneous continuous change of imperfect nature to the more perfect, is clearly opposed to Sacred Scripture and to the Faith."  This defined the range of official [[Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church|Catholic discussion of evolution]], which has remained almost exclusively concerned with [[human evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Brian W., [http://www.rtforum.org/lt/lt93.html Early Vatican Responses to Evolutionist Theology], ''Living Tradition'', Organ of the Roman Theological Forum, May 2001 – quotation from here.

===Huxley and Owen===
[[File:TH Huxley 41.5 KB.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The combative [[Thomas Huxley]] demanded a fair hearing for Darwin's ideas.]]
On 10 February 1860 Huxley gave a lecture titled ''On Species and Races, and their Origin'' at the [[Royal Institution]],&lt;ref name=Letter2696&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2696.html |title= Letter 2696 – Darwin, C. R. to Hooker, J. D., 14 Feb (1860) | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; reviewing Darwin's theory with [[fancy pigeon]]s on hand to demonstrate [[artificial selection]], as well as using the occasion to confront the clergy with his aim of wresting science from ecclesiastical control. He referred to [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s persecution by the church, "the little [[Canute the Great|Canute]]s of the hour enthroned in solemn state, bidding that great wave to stay, and threatening to check its beneficent progress." He hailed the ''Origin'' as heralding a "new [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]" in a battle against "those who would silence and crush" science, and called on the public to cherish Science and "follow her methods faithfully and implicitly in their application to all branches of human thought," for the future of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/guide4.html |title=The Huxley File § 4 Darwin's Bulldog |author=Charles Blinderman |authorlink= |author2=David Joyce |year=1998 |publisher=Clark University |accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;br&gt;{{citation |url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/SM2/Sp-R.html |title=On Species and Races, and Their Origin (1860) |author=Thomas Henry Huxley |authorlink=Thomas Henry Huxley |accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
To Darwin such rhetoric was "time wasted" and on reflection he thought the lecture "an entire failure ''which'' gave no just idea of ''natural'' selection,"&lt;ref name=Letter2696/&gt; but by March he was listing those on "our side" as against the "outsiders." His close allies were Hooker and Huxley, and in August he called Huxley his "good and kind agent for the propagation of the Gospel – i.e. the devil's gospel."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.2&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=347 331]}}&lt;br&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2893.html |title=Letter 2893 – Darwin, C.

The position of [[Richard Owen]] was unknown: when emphasising to a Parliamentary committee the need for a new Natural History museum, he pointed out that "The whole intellectual world this year has been excited by a book on the origin of species; and what is the consequence? Visitors come to the British Museum, and they say, 'Let us see all these varieties of pigeons: where is the tumbler, where is the pouter?' and I am obliged with shame to say, I can show you none of them..." As to showing you the varieties of those species, or of any of those phenomena that would aid one in getting at that mystery of mysteries, the origin of species, our space does not permit; but surely there ought to be a space somewhere, and, if not in the British Museum, where is it to be obtained?"

Huxley's April review in the ''[[Westminster Review]]'' included the first mention of the term "[[Darwinism]]" in the question, "What if the orbit of Darwinism should be a little too circular?"&lt;ref name=westminster&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1860}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin thought it a "brilliant review."&lt;ref name=Letter2754&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2754.html |title=Letter 2754 – Darwin, C. R. to Lyell, Charles, 10 Apr (1860) | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=14 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Overflowing the narrow bounds of purely scientific circles, the "species question" divides with Italy and the Volunteers the attention of general society. Everybody has read Mr. Darwin's book, or, at least, has given an opinion upon its merits or demerits; pietists, whether lay or ecclesiastic, decry it with the mild railing which sounds so charitable; bigots denounce it with ignorant invective; old ladies of both sexes consider it a decidedly dangerous book, and even savants, who have no better mud to throw, quote antiquated writers to show that its author is no better than an ape himself; while every philosophical thinker hails it as a veritable [[Joseph Whitworth#Whitworth rifle|Whitworth gun]] in the armoury of liberalism; and all competent naturalists and physiologists, whatever their opinions as to the ultimate fate of the doctrines put forth, acknowledge that the work in which they are embodied is a solid contribution to knowledge and inaugurates a new epoch in natural history. – Thomas Huxley, 1860&lt;ref name=westminster/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Owen's own anonymous review of the ''Origin'' appeared in the April ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'' he praised himself and his own ''axiom of the continuous operation of the ordained becoming of living things'', and showed his anger at what he saw as Darwin's caricature of the creationist position and ignoring Owen's pre-eminence. To him, new species appeared at birth, not through natural selection. As well as attacking Darwin's "disciples" Hooker and Huxley, he thought that the book symbolised the sort of "abuse of science to which a neighbouring nation, some seventy years since, owed its temporary degradation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Owen|1860}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin had Huxley and Hooker staying with him when he read it, and he wrote telling Lyell that it was "extremely malignant, clever &amp; I fear will be very damaging. He is atrociously severe on Huxley's lecture, &amp; very bitter against Hooker. So we three enjoyed it together: not that I really enjoyed it, for it made me uncomfortable for one night; but I have got quite over it today. It requires much study to appreciate all the bitter spite of many of the remarks against me; indeed I did not discover all myself.– It scandalously misrepresents many parts.&amp;nbsp;.... It is painful to be hated in the intense degree with which Owen hates me."&lt;ref name=Letter2754/&gt; He commented to Henslow that "Owen is indeed very spiteful. He misrepresents &amp; alters what I say very unfairly.&amp;nbsp;.... The Londoners says he is mad with envy because my book has been talked about: what a strange man to be envious of a naturalist like myself, immeasurably his inferior!"&lt;ref name=Letter2791&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2791.html |title= Letter 2791 – Darwin, C. R. to Henslow, J. S., 8 May (1860)| publisher = Darwin Correspondence Project | accessdate=14 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geological time and Phillips===
Darwin's had estimated that erosion of the [[Weald]] would take 300 million years, but in the second edition of ''On the Origin of Species'' published on 7 January 1860 he accepted that it would be safer to allow 150 million to 200 million years.{{sfn|Darwin|Costa|2009|p=286}}

Geologists knew the earth was ancient, but had felt unable to put realistic figures on the duration of past geological changes. Darwin's book provided a new impetus to quantifying geological time. His most prominent critic, [[John Phillips (geologist)|John Phillips]], had investigated [[Earth's internal heat budget|how temperatures increased with depth]] in the 1830s, and was convinced that, contrary to Lyell and Darwin's [[uniformitarianism]], the Earth was cooling over the long term. Between 1838 and 1855 he tried various ways of quantifying the timing of [[Stratigraphy|stratified deposits]], without success.{{sfn | Morrell | 2001 | pp=87–88}} On 17 February 1860, Phillips used his presidential address to the [[Geological Society of London]] to accuse Darwin of "abuse of arithmetic". He said 300 million years was an "inconceivable number" and that, depending on assumptions, erosion of the Weald could have taken anything from 12,000 years to at most 1,332,000 years, well below Darwin's estimate. When giving the May 1860 [[Rede Lecture]], Phillips produced his own first published estimates of the duration of the whole stratigraphic record,{{sfn|Herbert|2005|pp=350–351}} using rates of sedimentation to calculate it at around 96 million years.{{sfn | Morrell | 2001 | p=88}}

===Natural persecution===
Most reviewers wrote with great respect, deferring to Darwin's eminent position in science though finding it hard to understand how natural selection could work without a divine selector. There were hostile comments, at the start of May he commented to Lyell that he had "received in a Manchester Newspaper a rather a good squib, showing that I have proved 'might is right', &amp; therefore that Napoleon is right &amp; every cheating Tradesman is also right".&lt;ref name="Letter 2782"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-2782 |title=Letter 2782 – Darwin, C. R. to Lyell, Charles, 4 May (1860) |publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]'' reported that "The controversy excited by the appearance of Darwin's remarkable work on the ''Origin of Species'' has passed beyond the bounds of the study and lecture-room into the drawing-room and the public street."&lt;ref&gt;Anon (5 May 1860), "[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=image&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR226&amp;pageseq=233 Professor Owen on the Origin of Species]", The ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]'', London, p. 579.&lt;/ref&gt;

The older generation of Darwin's tutors were rather negative, and later in May he told his cousin Fox that "the attacks have been falling thick &amp; heavy on my now case-hardened hide.— Sedgwick &amp; Clarke opened regular battery on me lately at Cambridge Phil. Soc&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;. &amp; dear old Henslow defended me in grand style, saying that my investigations were perfectly legitimate."&lt;ref name=Letter2809&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2809.html |title= Letter 2809 – Darwin, C. R. to Fox, W. D., 18 May (1860) | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While defending Darwin's honest motives and belief that  "he was exalting &amp;  not debasing our views of a Creator, in attributing to him a power of imposing laws on the Organic World by which to do his work, as effectually as his laws imposed upon the inorganic had done it in the Mineral Kingdom", Henslow had not disguised his own opinion that "Darwin has pressed his hypothesis too far".&lt;ref name=Letter2794&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2794.html |title=Letter 2794 – Henslow, J. S. to Hooker, J. D., 10 May 1860 | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, [[Karl Marx]] saw the book as a "bitter satire" that showed "a basis in natural science for class struggle in history", in which "Darwin recognizes among beasts and plants his English society".&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Karl Marx to Engels dated 18 June 1862 cited in {{Harvtxt|Browne|2002|pp=187–188}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin remarked to Lyell, "I must be a very bad explainer... Several Reviews, &amp; several letters have shown me too clearly how little I am understood. I suppose ''natural selection'' was bad term; but to change it now, I think, would make confusion worse confounded. Nor can I think of better; ''Natural preservation'' would not imply a preservation of particular varieties &amp; would seem a truism; &amp; would not bring man's &amp; nature's selection under one point of view. I can only hope by reiterated explanations finally to make matter clearer."&lt;ref name=Letter2822&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2822.html |title= Letter 2822 – Darwin, C. R. to Lyell, Charles, 6 June (1860) | publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=6 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was too illegible for Lyell, and Darwin later apologised "I am utterly ashamed &amp; groan over my hand-writing. It was ''Natural Preservation''. Natural persecution is what the author ought to suffer."&lt;ref name=Letter2935&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2935.html |title= Letter 2935 – Darwin, C.

==Debate==

===''Essays and Reviews''===
Around February 1860 [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theologians]] entered the fray, when seven produced a manifesto titled ''[[Essays and Reviews]]''. These [[Anglican]]s included Oxford professors, country clergymen, the headmaster of [[Rugby school]] and a layman. Their declaration that miracles were irrational stirred up unprecedented anger, drawing much of the fire away from Darwin. ''Essays'' sold 22,000 copies in two years, more than the ''Origin'' sold in twenty years, and sparked five years of increasingly polarised debate with books and pamphlets furiously contesting the issues.

The most scientific of the seven was the Reverend [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Baden Powell]], who held the [[Savilian chair of geometry]] at the [[University of Oxford]]. Referring to "Mr Darwin's masterly volume" and restating his argument that God is a lawgiver, miracles break the lawful edicts issued at Creation, therefore belief in miracles is atheistic, he wrote that the book "must soon bring about an entire revolution in opinion in favour of the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature." He drew attacks, with Sedgwick accusing him of "greedily" adopting nonsense and [[Tory]] reviews saying he was joining "the infidel party". He would have been on the platform at the British Association debate, facing the bishop, but died of a heart attack on 11 June.

===The British Association debate===
{{main article|1860 Oxford evolution debate}}
The most famous confrontation took place at a meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] in [[Oxford]] on Saturday 30 June 1860. While there was no formal debate organised on the issue, Professor [[John William Draper]] of [[New York University]] was to talk on Darwin and social progress at a routine "Botany and Zoology" meeting. The new museum hall was crowded with clergy, undergraduates, Oxford dons and gentlewomen anticipating that [[Samuel Wilberforce]], the Bishop of Oxford, would speak to repeat the savage trouncing he had given in 1847 to the ''Vestiges'' published anonymously by [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]]. Owen lodged with Wilberforce the night before, but Wilberforce would have been well prepared as he had just reviewed the ''Origin'' for the Tory ''Quarterly'' for a fee of £60.&lt;ref name=W1860&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilberforce|1860}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley was not going to wait for the meeting, but met Chambers who accused him of "deserting them" and changed his mind. Darwin was taking treatment at Dr. Lane's new [[hydropathy|hydropathic]] establishment at Sudbrooke Park, [[Petersham, London|Petersham]], near [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] in Surrey. 
[[File:Oxf-uni-mus-nh.jpg|thumb|right|The debate was held in the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]]]]
From Hooker's account, Draper "droned on for an hour", then for half an hour [[Samuel Wilberforce|"Soapy Sam" Wilberforce]] replied with the eloquence that had earned him his nickname. This time the climate of opinion had changed and the ensuing debate was more evenly matched, with Hooker being particularly successful in defence of Darwin's ideas. In response to what Huxley took as a jibe from Wilberforce as to whether it was on Huxley's grandfather's or grandmother's side that he was descended from an ape, Huxley made a reply which he later recalled as being that "[if asked] would I rather have a miserable ape for a grandfather or a man highly endowed by nature and possessed of great means and influence and yet who employs these faculties and that influence for the mere purpose of introducing ridicule into a grave scientific discussion I unhesitatingly affirm my preference for the ape". No verbatim record was taken: eyewitness accounts exist, and vary somewhat.&lt;ref&gt;Jenson, J. Vernon 1991. ''Thomas Henry Huxley: communicating for science''. U. of Delaware Press, Newark. [Chapter 3 is an excellent survey, and its notes gives references to all the eyewitness accounts except Newton]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wollaston|1921|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/lifeofalfrednewt00wolliala#page/118/mode/2up 118–120]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lucas|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert FitzRoy]], who had been the captain of {{HMS|Beagle}} during Darwin's voyage, was there to present a paper on storms.  During the debate FitzRoy, seen by Hooker as "a grey haired Roman nosed elderly gentleman", stood in the centre of the audience and "lifting an immense Bible first with both and afterwards with one hand over his head, solemnly implored the audience to believe God rather than man". As he admitted that the ''Origin of Species'' had given him "acutest pain" the crowd shouted him down.

Hooker's "blood boiled, I felt myself a dastard; now I saw my advantage–I swore to myself I would smite that [[Amalek]]ite Sam hip and thigh", (he was invited up to the platform and) "there and then I smacked him amid rounds of applause... proceeded to demonstrate... that he could never have read your book... wound up with a very few observations on the...old and new hypotheses... Sam was shut up... and the meeting was dissolved forthwith leaving you [Darwin] master of the field after 4 hours battle."&lt;ref name=Letter2852&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2852.html | title=Letter 2852 – Hooker, J. D. to Darwin, C. R., 2 July (1860) | publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both sides came away claiming victory, with Hooker and Huxley each sending Darwin rather contradictory triumphant accounts. Supporters of Darwinism seized on this meeting as a sign that the idea of evolution could not be suppressed by authority, and would be defended vigorously by its advocates. Liberal clerics were also satisfied that literal belief in all aspects of the Bible was now questioned by science; they were sympathetic to some of the ideas in ''[[Essays and Reviews]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jenson, J. Vernon 1991. ''Thomas Henry Huxley: communicating for science''. U. of Delaware Press, Newark.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: [[Alfred Newton#Reception of the Origin of Species]] and [[Thomas Henry Huxley#Debate with Wilberforce]]
&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Whewell]] wrote to his friend [[James David Forbes]] that "Perhaps the Bishop was not prudent to venture into a field where no eloquence can supersede the need for precise knowledge. The young naturalists declared themselves in favour of Darwin’s views which tendency I saw already at Leeds two years ago. I am sorry for it, for I reckon Darwin’s book to be an utterly unphilosophical one."&lt;ref name="Secord2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=James A.

[[File:WilberforceVanityFair.jpg|thumb|right|upright|1869 Caricature of [[Samuel Wilberforce|Wilberforce]]. His hand washing gesture helped earn the [[Bishop of Oxford]] his nickname]]

===Wilberforce's ''Quarterly'' review===
In late July Darwin read Wilberforce's review in the ''Quarterly''.&lt;ref name=W1860/&gt; It used a 60-year-old parody from the ''[[Anti-Jacobin]]'' of the prose of Darwin's grandfather [[Erasmus Darwin|Erasmus]], implying old revolutionary sympathies. It argued that if "transmutations were actually occurring" this would be seen in rapidly reproducing invertebrates, and since it isn't, why think that "the favourite varieties of turnips are tending to become men". Darwin pencilled "rubbish" in the margin. To the statement about classification that "all creation is the transcript in matter of ideas eternally existing in the mind of the Most High!!", Darwin scribbled "mere words". At the same time, Darwin was willing to grant that Wilberforce's review was clever: he wrote to Hooker that "it picks out with skill all the most conjectural parts, and brings forward well all the difficulties. It quizzes me quite splendidly by quoting the 'Anti-Jacobin' against my Grandfather."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Darwin|1887| pp= 324–325, Vol. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilberforce also attacked ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'' in the ''[[Quarterly Review]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilberforce|1861}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a letter to ''[[The Times]]'', signed by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and 25 bishops, which threatened the theologians with the ecclesiastical courts.&lt;ref name=DM500&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=500–501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin quoted a proverb: "A bench of bishops is the devil's flower garden", and joined others including Lyell, though not Hooker and Huxley, in signing a counter-letter supporting ''Essays and Reviews'' for trying to "establish religious teachings on a firmer and broader foundation". Despite this alignment of pro-evolution scientists and Unitarians with liberal churchmen, two of the authors were indicted for heresy and lost their jobs by 1862.&lt;ref name=DM500/&gt;

===Geological time, Phillips and third edition===
In October 1860, [[John Phillips (geologist)|John Phillips]] published ''Life on the Earth, its origin and succession'', reiterating points from his [[Rede Lecture]] and disputing Darwin's arguments.&lt;ref name="Phillips 1860"&gt;{{cite book|first=John |last=Phillips|title=Life on the Earth, its origin and succession|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZdWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA130|date=October 1860|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sent a copy to Darwin, who thanked him, though "sorry, but not surprised, to see that you are dead against me".&lt;ref name="Letter no. 2983"&gt;{{cite web |title=Letter no. 2983: Darwin, C. R. to Phillips, John | website=Darwin Correspondence Project | date=14 November 1860 | url=https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/DCP-LETT-2983.xml | accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 20 November, Darwin told Lyell of his revisions for a third edition of the ''Origin'', including removing his estimate of the time it took for the [[Weald]] to erode: "The confounded Wealden calculation, to be struck out. &amp; a note to be inserted to effect that I am convinced of its inaccuracy from Review in Saturday R. &amp; from Phillips, as I see in Table of Contents that he attacks it."&lt;ref name="Letter no. 2989"&gt;{{cite web |title=Letter no. 2989: Darwin, C. R. to Lyell, Charles| website=Darwin Correspondence Project | date=20 November 1860| url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/DCP-LETT-2989.xml | accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later told Lyell that "Having burnt my own fingers so consumedly with the Wealden, I am fearful for you", and advised caution: "for Heaven-sake take care of your fingers; to burn them severely, as I have done, is very unpleasant."&lt;ref name="Letter no. 2997"&gt;{{cite web |title=Letter no. 2997: Darwin, C. R. to Lyell, Charles| website=Darwin Correspondence Project | date=25 November 1860| url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/DCP-LETT-2997 | accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third edition, as published on 30 April 1861, stated "The computation of time required for the denudation of the Weald omitted. I have been convinced of its inaccuracy in several respects by an excellent article in the 'Saturday Review,' Dec. 24, 1859."&lt;ref name="OtOOS 61 xii" /&gt;

===''Natural History Review''===
The ''[[Natural History Review]]'' was bought and refurbished by Huxley, Lubbock, Busk and other "plastically minded young men" – supporters of Darwin. The first issue in January 1861 carried Huxley's paper on man's relationship to apes, "showing up" Owen. Huxley cheekily sent a copy to Wilberforce.

==Darwin at home==
As the battles raged, Darwin returned home from the spa to proceed with experiments on [[chloroform]]ing carnivorous [[Drosera|sundew]] plants, looking over his ''Natural Selection'' manuscript and drafting two chapters on pigeon breeding that would eventually form part of ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]''.&lt;ref name="CD Journal 1860"&gt;{{citation | url= http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR158.1-76&amp;pageseq=74| title= Charles Darwin's journal for 1860 | publisher= Darwin Online }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote to [[Asa Gray]] and used the example of fantail pigeons to argue against Gray's belief "that variation has been led along certain beneficial lines", with the implication of Creationism rather than Natural Selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2998.html | title=Letter 2998 – Darwin, C. R. to Gray, Asa, 26 Nov (1860) | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the winter he organised a third edition of the ''Origin'', adding an introductory historical sketch. Asa Gray had published three supportive articles in the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]''. Darwin persuaded Gray to publish them as a pamphlet, and was delighted when Gray came up with the title of ''Natural Selection Not Inconsistent with Natural Theology''. Darwin paid half the cost, imported 250 copies into Britain and as well as advertising it in periodicals and sending 100 copies out to scientists, reviewers, and theologians (including Wilberforce), he included in the ''Origin'' a recommendation for it, available to be purchased for 1s. 6d. from Trübner's in Paternoster Row.

The Huxleys became close family friends, frequently visiting [[Down House]]. When their 3-year-old son died of scarlet fever they were badly affected. Henrietta Huxley brought their three infants to Down in March 1861 where Emma helped to console her, while Huxley continued with his working-men's lectures at the [[Royal School of Mines]], writing that "My working men stick with me wonderfully, the house fuller than ever, By next Friday evening they will all be convinced that they are monkeys."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Huxley|1903|p=276, Vol. 1}}. Page 190 in the first edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments with Owen===
Huxley's arguments with Owen continued in the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' so that each Saturday Darwin could read the latest ripostes. Owen tried to smear Huxley by portraying him as an "advocate of man's origins from a transmuted ape", and one of his contributions was titled "Ape-Origin of Man as Tested by the Brain". This backfired, as Huxley had already delighted Darwin by speculating on "pithecoid man" – ape-like man, and was glad of the invitation to publicly turn the anatomy of brain structure into a question of human ancestry. He was determined to indict Owen for perjury, promising "before I have done with that mendacious humbug I will nail him out, like a kite to a barn door, an example to all evil doers."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=504}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin egged him on from Down, writing "Oh Lord what a thorn you must be in the poor dear man's side".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-3107.html | title=Letter 3107 – Darwin, C. R. to Huxley, T. H., 1 Apr (1861) | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their campaign ran over two years and was devastatingly successful, with each "slaying" being followed by a recruiting drive for the Darwinian cause. The spite lingered. When Huxley joined the Zoological Society Council in 1861, Owen left, and in the following year Huxley moved to stop Owen from being elected to the Royal Society Council as "no body of gentlemen" should admit a member "guilty of wilful &amp; deliberate falsehood." 

Lyell was troubled both by Huxley's belligerence and by the question of ape ancestry, but got little sympathy from Darwin who teased him that "''Our'' ancestor was an animal which breathed water, had a swim bladder, a great swimming tail, an imperfect skull, and undoubtedly was a hermaphrodite! Here is a pleasant genealogy for mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=505}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2647.html|title=Letter 2647 – Darwin, C. R. to Lyell, Charles, 10 Jan (1860) | publisher= Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=13 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyell began work on a book examining human origins.

===Geological time: William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)===
Like the geologist [[John Phillips (geologist)|John Phillips]], the physicist [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (later ennobled as Lord Kelvin) had considered since the 1840s that the physics of [[thermodynamics]] required that the Earth was cooling from an initial molten state. This contradicted Lyell's [[uniformitarianism|uniformitarian]] concept of unchanging processes over deep geological time, which Darwin shared and had assumed would allow ample time for the slow process of natural selection.{{sfn | Morrell | 2001 | pp=87–88}} 

In June 1861 Thomson asked Phillips how geologists felt about Darwin's "prodigious durations for geological epochs". and mentioned his own preliminary calculation that the Sun was 20 million years old, with the Earth at most 200 to 1,000 million years old. Phillips discussed his own published view that stratified rocks went back 96 million years, and dismissed Darwin's original estimate that the [[Weald]] had taken 300 million years to erode. In September 1861 Thomson produced a paper "On the age of the Sun's heat" which estimated that the Sun was between 100 and 500 million years old,{{sfn | Morrell | 2001 | pp=88–89}} and in 1862 he used assumptions on the rate of cooling from a molten condition to estimate the age of the Earth at 98 million years. The dispute continued for the rest of Darwin's life.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, William. (1864). "[http://courses.seas.harvard.edu/climate/eli/Courses/EPS281r/Sources/Earth-age-and-thermal-history/more/Kelvin-1863-excerpts.pdf On the secular cooling of the earth]", read 28 April 1862. ''Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh'', 23, 157–170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continued debate==
[[File:Ch Darwin-Emile Littré by André Gill.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A French caricature around 1878 shows a bearded Darwin breaking through hoops of "gullibility, superstitions, errors, and ignorance" held up by [[Émile Littré]].]]

The [[On the Origin of Species#Reception|reception of Darwin's ideas]] continued to arouse scientific and religious debates, and wide public interest. Satirical cartoonists seized on animal ancestry in relation to other topical issues, drawing on a long tradition of identifying animal traits in humans. In Britain mass circulation magazines were droll rather than cruel, and thus presented Darwin's theory in an unthreatening way. Due to illness, Darwin began growing a beard in 1862, and when he reappeared in public in 1866 with a bushy beard, caricatures centred on Darwin and his new look contributed to a trend in which all forms of [[evolutionism]] were identified with [[Darwinism]].&lt;ref name=b373&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=373–379}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Freeman76&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|2007|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A27b&amp;pageseq=83 76]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Temple Mount Western Wall on Shabbat by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|300px|Western Wall and Dome of the Rock, Jerusalem&lt;br /&gt;(Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem is [[Positions on Jerusalem|internationally disputed]]).&lt;ref group=note&gt;The [[Jerusalem Law]] states that "Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of Israel" and the city serves as the seat of the government, home to the President's residence, government offices, supreme court, and [[Knesset|parliament]]. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 478]] (20 August 1980; 14–0, U.S. abstaining) declared the Jerusalem Law "null and void" and called on member states to withdraw their diplomatic missions from Jerusalem. The United Nations and all member nations refuse to accept the Jerusalem Law (see {{Harvard citation no brackets|Kellerman|1993|p=140}}) and maintain their embassies in other cities such as Tel Aviv, [[Ramat Gan]], and [[Herzliya]] (see the [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/is.html CIA Factbook] and [https://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/israel.pdf Map of Israel]). The U.S. Congress subsequently adopted the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]], which said that the U.S. embassy should be relocated to Jerusalem and that it should be recognized as the capital of Israel. However, the US Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel concluded that the provisions of the act "invade exclusive presidential authorities in the field of foreign affairs and are unconstitutional". Since passage of the act, all Presidents serving in office have determined that moving forward with the relocation would be detrimental to U.S. national security concerns and opted to issue waivers suspending any action on this front. The [[Palestinian Authority]] sees [[East Jerusalem]] as the capital of a [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|future Palestinian state]]. The city's final status awaits future negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (see [http://www.pij.org/details.php?id=460 "Negotiating Jerusalem", Palestine–Israel Journal]). See [[Positions on Jerusalem]] for more information.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Religion in Israel''' is a central feature of the country and plays a major role in shaping Israeli culture and lifestyle. Religion has played a central role in Israel's history. [[Israel]] is also the only country in the world where a majority of citizens are [[Jewish]]. According to the [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]], the population in 2011 was 75.4% Jewish, 20.6% Arab, and 4.1% minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;Haaretz Service (16-09-2009). "Israel on eve of Rosh Hoshanah: Population hits 7.5m, 75.4% Jewish". Haaretz. https://www.haaretz.com/1.5448149. Retrieved 2009-12-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The religious affiliation of the Israeli population as of 2016&lt;ref name="2016-data"/&gt; was 74.7% Jewish, 17.7% [[Muslim]], 2.0% [[Christian]], and 1.6% [[Druze]], with the remaining 4.1% including faiths such as [[Samaritanism]] and [[Baha'iism]], and [[Irreligion in Israel|irreligious]] people with no faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fazel|first1=Seena|title=THE BAHA'IS OF IRAN: Socio-Historical Studies|date=2012|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS 2.1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Statistical Abstract of Israel 2006 (No. 57)|publisher=[[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]]|url=http://www1.cbs.gov.il/reader/shnatonenew_site.htm|year=2006|chapter=Table 2.1 — Population, by Religion and Population.

Israel does not have a constitution. While the [[Basic Laws of Israel]] that serve in place of a constitution define the country as a "[[Jewish state]]", these Basic Laws, coupled with [[Knesset]] statutes, decisions of the [[Supreme Court of Israel]], and various elements of the [[common law]] current in Israel, offer some protection for free practice of religion in the country.&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35499.htm|title=Israel and the Occupied Territories|website=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/basic3_eng.htm|title=Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pew Research Center]] has identified Israel as one of the countries that places "high" restrictions on religion,&lt;ref name="prc-2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Full report)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport.pdf|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been limits placed on non-Orthodox streams of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;"U.S. Department of State: 2012 Report on International Religious Freedom: Israel and The Occupied Territories (May 20, 2013)"http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2012/nea/208392.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Legal accommodation of the non-Jewish communities follows the pattern and practice of the Ottoman and British administrations, with some important modifications.

The Law of Return does not strictly follow the traditional Jewish religious law ([[halakha]]) in relation to the definition of [[who is a Jew]]. For example, some individuals who would be considered Jewish under halakha are excluded from the rights under the Law of Return - e. g., those who converted to another religion; while others are entitled to immigration though they are not considered Jewish under halakha, e. g., they are related by marriage to a Jew or a grandparent may have been a Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://wupj.org/library/latin-america/6310/the-law-of-return-is-it-time-for-the-return-of-the-law/ |title=The Law of Return – is it time for the Return of the Law? |author=Nicole Maor |access-date=October 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=www.etd.ceu.hu/2012/pransky_tiffany.pdf |title=Boundaries of Belonging: Conversion in Israel's Law of return |author=Tiffany Pransky |format=pdf |access-date=October 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel is in the middle of the international religiosity scale, between Thailand, the world's most religious country, and China, the least religious.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The Israeli Democracy Index commissioned in 2013 regarding religious affiliation of Israeli Jews found that 3.9 percent of respondents felt attached to Reform (Progressive) Judaism, 3.2 percent to Conservative Judaism, and 26.5 percent to Orthodox Judaism. The other two thirds of respondents said they felt no connection to any denomination, or declined to respond.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.528994 Poll: 7.1 percent of Israeli Jews define themselves as Reform or Conservative] Haaretz, 11 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orthodox spectrum====
{{Main article|Religious Zionism|Hardal|Haredi}}
[[File:Tehillim neged Tilim.jpg|thumb|250px|left|'''"Tehillim neged Tilim"''' ("Psalms [recting] to counter Missiles").&lt;br /&gt; A slogan initially coined during the [[First Gulf War]], 1991, and turned into a popular slogan-sticker ever since, especially among the [[Israel]]i [[Religious Zionism]] ("National Religious") community and the [[Haredi Judaism]] sector ]]

The spectrum covered by "Orthodox" in the diaspora exists in Israel, again with some important variations.

What would be called "Orthodox" in the diaspora includes what is commonly called ''dati'' ("religious") or ''[[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]]'' ("ultra-Orthodox") in Israel.&lt;ref name=Lipka/&gt; The former term includes what is called [[Religious Zionism]] or the "National Religious" community (and also [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] in US terms), as well as what has become known over the past decade or so as ''[[Hardal]]'' (''Haredi-Leumi'', i. e., "ultra-Orthodox nationalist"), which combines a largely ''Haredi'' lifestyle with a nationalist (i. e., pro-Zionist) ideology.
[[File:Haredi Judaism.jpg|thumb|200px|Haredi Jews]]
Haredi applies to a populace that can be roughly divided into three separate groups along both ethnic and ideological lines: (1) "[[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]]" (i. e., non-Hasidic) ''Haredim'' of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic]] (i. e., "Germanic" - European) origin; (2) [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] ''Haredim'' of Ashkenazic (mostly of [[Eastern Europe]]an) origin; and (3) [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] (including [[Mizrahi Jews|mizrahi]]) ''Haredim''.

There is also a growing [[baal teshuva]] (Jewish returners) movement of secular Israelis rejecting their previously secular lifestyles and choosing to become religiously observant, with many educational programs and [[yeshiva]]s for them.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} An example is [[Aish HaTorah]], which received open encouragement from some sectors within the Israeli establishment.

At the same time, there is also a significant movement in the opposite direction toward a secular lifestyle. There is some debate which trend is stronger at present. Recent polls show that ranks of secular Jewish minority in Israel continued to drop in 2009. Currently, the secular make up only 42%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/poll-shows-ranks-of-secular-jewish-minority-in-israel-continued-to-drop-in-2009-1.290749|title=Poll Shows Ranks of Secular Jewish Minority in Israel Continued to Drop in 2009|website=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-Orthodox denominations of Judaism====
[[File:WOW Torah Reading.jpg|thumb|WOW Torah Reading with [[Anat Hoffman]] looking on]]
[[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]] are represented among Israeli Jews. According to The Israel Democracy Institute, as of 2013, approximately 8 percent of Israel’s Jewish population "identified" with Reform and Conservative Judaism, a study by [[Pew Research Center]] showed 5% did,&lt;ref name=Lipka&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/15/unlike-u-s-few-jews-in-israel-identify-as-reform-or-conservative/ |first=Michael |last=Lipka |title=Unlike U.S., few Jews in Israel identify as Reform or Conservative |date=March 15, 2016 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a Midgam survey showed that one third "especially identified with Progressive Judaism", almost as many as those who especially identify with Orthodox Judaism. The Chief Rabbinate strongly opposes the Reform and Conservative movements, saying they are "uprooting Judaism", that they cause assimilation and that they have “no connection” to authentic Judaism.&lt;ref name="JPost - Chief Rabbinate opposes reform movements"&gt;{{cite news|last1=By JEREMY SHARON, SAM SOKOL|title=Chief Rabbinate in fierce attack on Reform, Conservative movements|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Chief-Rabbinate-in-fierce-attack-on-Reform-Conservative-movements-446143|access-date=April 27, 2016|work=Jerusalem Post|date=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chief rabbinate's view does not reflect the majority viewpoint of Israeli Jews, however. A survey of Israeli Jews published in May 2016 showed that 72 percent of respondents said they disagreed with the Haredi assertions that Reform Jews are not really Jewish. The survey also showed that a third of Israeli Jews "identify" with progressive (Reform or Conservative) Judaism and almost two thirds agree that Reform Judaism should have equal rights in Israel with Orthodox Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/2016/05/27/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/survey-third-of-israeli-jews-identify-with-reform-movement Survey: Majority of Israeli Jews support equality for Reform movement] JTA, May 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The report was organized by the [[Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism]] ahead of its 52nd biennial conference.

==== Secular–religious status quo ====
{{Main article|Status quo (Israel)}}
The religious [[status quo]], agreed to by [[David Ben-Gurion]] with the Orthodox parties at the time of Israel's formation in 1948, is an agreement on the role that Judaism would play in Israel's government and the judicial system. The agreement was based upon a letter sent by Ben-Gurion to [[Agudat Israel]] dated 19 June 1947.&lt;ref&gt;''The Status Quo Letter'' ([http://w3.kfar-olami.org.il/asaf/pedagogical/ezrahut/status.doc DOC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716140145/http://w3.kfar-olami.org.il/asaf/pedagogical/ezrahut/status.doc |date=2011-07-16 }}) {{He icon}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=iVJR9UZnTVAC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false English translation] in ''Israel in the Middle East: Documents and Readings on Society, Politics, and Foreign Relations, Pre-1948 to the Present'', editors Itamar Rabinovich and Jehuda Reinharz. {{ISBN|978-0-87451-962-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this agreement, which still operates in most respects today:
* The Chief Rabbinate has authority over [[kashrut]], [[Shabbat]], [[Jewish burial]] and personal status issues, such as [[Jewish view of marriage|marriage]], divorce, and conversions.
* Streets in [[Haredi]] neighborhoods are closed to traffic on the Jewish Sabbath.
* There is no [[public transport]] on the Jewish Sabbath, and most businesses are closed. However, there is public transport in [[Haifa]], since Haifa had a large Arab population at the time of the British Mandate.
* Restaurants who wish to advertise themselves as [[kosher]] must be certified by the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbinate]].
* Importation of non-kosher foods is prohibited. Despite this prohibition, a few pork farms supply establishments selling [[white meat]], due to demand therefore among specific population sectors, particularly the Russian immigrants of the 1990s. Despite the status quo, the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] ruled in 2004 that local governments are not allowed to ban the sale of pork, although this had previously been a common by-law.

Nevertheless, some breaches of the ''status quo'' have become prevalent, such as several suburban malls remaining open during the Sabbath. Though this is [[blue law|contrary to the law]], the government largely turns a blind eye.

While the state of Israel enables freedom of religion for all of its citizens, it does not enable civil marriage. The state forbids and disapproves of any civil marriages or non-religious divorces performed amongst within the country. Because of this, some Israelis choose to marry outside of Israel.  Many parts of the "status quo" have been challenged by secular Israelis regarding the Chief Rabbinate's strict control over Jewish weddings, Jewish divorce proceedings, conversions, and the question of [[who is a Jew]] for the purposes of immigration.

The [[Ministry of Education (Israel)|Ministry of Education]] manages the secular and Orthodox school networks of various faiths in parallel, with a limited degree of independence and a common core curriculum.

In recent years, perceived frustration with the ''status quo'' among the secular population has strengthened parties such as [[Shinui]], which advocate separation of religion and state, without much success so far.

Today the secular Israeli Jews claim that they aren't religious and don't observe Jewish law, and that Israel as a democratic modern country should not force the observance thereof upon its citizens against their will. The Orthodox Israeli Jews claim that the separation between state and religion will contribute to the end of Israel's Jewish identity.

Signs of the first challenge to the status quo came in 1977, with the fall of the Labor government that had been in power since independence, and the formation of a right-wing coalition under [[Menachem Begin]]. Right-wing Revisionist Zionism had always been more acceptable to the Orthodox parties, since it did not share the same history of anti-religious rhetoric that marked socialist Zionism. Furthermore, Begin needed the Haredi members of the Knesset (Israel's unicameral parliament) to form his coalition, and offered more power and benefits to their community than what they had been accustomed to receiving, including a lifting of the numerical limit on military exemptions for those engaged in full-time Torah study.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

On the other hand, secular Israelis began questioning whether a "status quo" based on the conditions of the 1940s and 1950s was still relevant in the 1980s and 1990s, and reckoned that they had cultural and institutional support to enable them to change it regardless of its relevance. They challenged Orthodox control of personal affairs such as marriage and divorce, resented the lack of entertainment and transportation options on the Jewish Sabbath (then the country's only day of rest), and questioned whether the burden of military service was being shared equitably, since the 400 scholars who originally benefited from the exemption, had grown to 50,000 {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}. Finally, the Progressive and Conservative communities, though still small, began to exert themselves as an alternative to the Haredi control of religious issues. No one was happy with the "status quo"; the Orthodox used their newfound political force to attempt to extend religious control, and the non-Orthodox sought to reduce or even eliminate it.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In 2010 a report released by the [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]] showed that 8% of Israel's Jewish population defines itself as ultra-Orthodox, 12% as Orthodox, 13% as traditional-religious, 25% as traditional, and 42% as secular, on a descending scale of religiosity. Among the Arab population it showed that 8% define themselves as very religious, 47% as religious, 27% as not very religious, and 18% as not religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3890330,00.html|title=Israel 2010: 42% of Jews are secular|website=ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chief Rabbinate====
[[File:Jerusalem Great Synagogue.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Great Synagogue (Jerusalem)|Great Synagogue]] in Jerusalem, seat of the Chief Rabbinate]]
{{Main|Chief Rabbinate of Israel}}It was during the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]] that the British administration established an official dual Ashkenazi-Sephardi "Chief Rabbinate" (''rabbanut harashit'') that was exclusively Orthodox, as part of an effort to consolidate and organize Jewish life based on its own model in Britain, which encouraged strict loyalty to the British crown, and in order to attempt to influence the religious life of the Jews in Palestine in a similar fashion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} In 1921, Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] (1864–1935) was chosen as the first [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] and Rabbi [[Jacob Meir]] as the first [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] Chief Rabbi (''Rishon LeTzion''). Rabbi Kook was a leading light of the [[Religious Zionism|religious Zionist]] movement, and was acknowledged by all as a great rabbi of his generation. He believed that the work of secular Jews toward creating an eventual Jewish state in [[Eretz Yisrael]] was part of a divine plan for the settlement of the [[land of Israel]]. The return to Israel was in Kook's view not merely a political phenomenon to save Jews from persecution, but an event of extraordinary historical and theological significance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
[[File:Western wall jerusalem night.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Western Wall|Kotel]] is under the supervision of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]
Prior to the 1917 British conquest of Palestine, the Ottomans had recognized the leading rabbis of the [[Old Yishuv]] as the official leaders of the small Jewish community that for many centuries consisted mostly of the devoutly Orthodox Jews from [[Eastern Europe]] as well as those from the [[Levant]] who had made [[aliyah]] to the Holy Land, primarily for religious reasons. The European immigrants had unified themselves in an organization initially known as the ''Vaad Ha'ir'', which later changed its name to ''[[Edah HaChareidis]]''.The Turks viewed the local rabbis of Palestine as extensions of their own Orthodox [[Hakham Bashi]]s ("[Turkish] Chief Rabbi/s") who were loyal to the Sultan.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Thus the centrality of an Orthodox dominated Chief Rabbinate became part of the new state of Israel as well when it was [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel|established in 1948]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}Based in its central offices at ''Heichal Shlomo'' in [[Jerusalem]] the Israeli Chief rabbinate has continued to wield exclusive control over all the Jewish religious aspects of the secular state of Israel. Through a complex system of "advice and consent" from a variety of senior rabbis and influential politicians, each Israeli city and town also gets to elect its own local Orthodox Chief Rabbi who is looked up to by substantial regional and even national religious and even non-religious Israeli Jews.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Through a national network of [[Beth din|Batei Din]] ("religious courts"), each headed only by approved Orthodox [[Av Beit Din]] judges, as well as a network of "Religious Councils" that are part of each municipality, the Israeli Chief Rabbinate retains exclusive control and has the final say in the state about virtually all matters pertaining to [[Ger tzedek|conversion to Judaism]], the [[Hechsher|Kosher certification of foods]], the status of [[Jewish view of marriage|Jewish marriages and divorces]], and monitoring and acting when called upon to supervise the observance of some laws relating to Shabbat observance, [[Passover]] (particularly when issues concerning the sale or ownership of [[Chametz]] come up), the [[Sabbatical year (Bible)#Modern observance in Israel|observance of the Sabbatical year]] and the [[Jubilee (Biblical)|Jubilee year]] in the agricultural sphere.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The [[Israel Defense Forces]] also relies on the Chief Rabbinate's approval for its own Jewish chaplains who are exclusively Orthodox. The IDF has a number of units that cater to the unique religious requirements of the Religious Zionist [[yeshiva]] students through the [[Hesder]] program of combined alternating military service and yeshiva studies over several years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

A poll conducted by the [[Israel Democracy Institute]] in April and May 2014 of which institutions were most and least trusted by Israeli citizens showed that Israelis have little trust in the religious establishment. When asked which public institutions they most trusted, the Chief Rabbinate at 29% was one of the least trusted.&lt;ref&gt;"Tamar Pileggi 'Jews and Arabs proud to be Israeli, distrust government: Poll conducted before war shows marked rise in support for state among Arabs; religious establishment scores low on trust' (4 Jan 2015) The Times of Israel" http://www.timesofisrael.com/jews-and-arabs-proud-to-be-israeli-distrust-government/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Karaite Judaism====
[[File:Karaim sinagog Ashdod.jpg|right|thumb|192px|Karaite Synagogue in [[Ashdod]]]]
The [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]] are an ancient Jewish community that practices a form of Judaism distinct from [[Rabbinical Judaism]], dating ostensibly to between the 7th and 9th centuries based on textual evidence,&lt;ref&gt;Mourad El-Kodsi, The Karaite Jews of Egypt, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ash-Shubban Al-Qarra’in 4, 2 June 1937, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oesterley, W.

====Conversion process====
On December 7, 2016, the chief rabbis of Israel issued a new policy requiring that foreign Jewish converts be recognized in Israel, and vowed to release criteria required for recognizing rabbis who perform such conversions.&lt;ref name="kpppafab"&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.757795&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, such conversions were not required to be recognized.&lt;ref name="kpppafab"/&gt; However, within one week the chief rabbis had retracted their earlier promise and instead appointed members to a joint committee of five rabbis who would formulate the conversion criteria.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesofisrael.com/chief-rabbis-set-up-committee-to-rule-on-conversions-performed-abroad/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Samaritans===
Israel is home to the only significant populations of [[Samaritan]]s in the world.
As of November 1, 2007, there were 712 Samaritans.&lt;ref name="SamNews20071101"&gt;"Developed Community", A.B. The Samaritan News Bi-Weekly Magazine, November 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The community lives almost exclusively in Kiryat Luza on [[Mount Gerizim]] and in [[Holon]]. Their traditional religious leader is the [[Samaritan High Priest]], currently [[Aabed-El ben Asher ben Matzliach]]. Ancestrally, they claim descent from a group of [[Israelite]] inhabitants from the tribes of Joseph (divided between the two "half tribes" of [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]] and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]]), and the priestly [[tribe of Levi]].&lt;ref&gt;David Noel Freedman, ''The Anchor Bible Dictionary'', 5:941 (New York: Doubleday, 1996, c1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being counted separately in the census, for the purposes of citizenship, the Israeli Chief Rabbinate has classified them as Jews according to law.&lt;ref&gt;Shulamit Sela, The Head of the Rabbanite, Karaite and Samaritan Jews: On the History of a Title, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 57, No. 2 (1994), pp. 255-267&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Christians living permanently in Israel are [[Arab Christians|Arabs]], or have come from other countries to live and work mainly in [[Church (building)|churches]] or [[Monastery|monasteries]], which have long and enduring histories in the land.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Ten churches are officially recognized under Israel's [[Marriage in Israel|confessional system]], which provides for the self-regulation of status issues, such as marriage and divorce. These are the [[Roman Catholic (Latin rite)|Roman (Latin rite)]], [[Armenian Catholic|Armenian]], [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syriac]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean]], [[Melkite (Greek Catholic)]] and [[Maronite]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic churches]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[Greek Orthodox Church]], and [[Syriac Orthodox]] churches, as well as [[Anglicanism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Christian Arabs]] are one of the most educated groups in Israel.

According to historical and traditional sources, [[Jesus]] lived in the [[Land of Israel]], and died and was buried on the site of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in Jerusalem, making the land a [[Holy Land]] for Christianity. However, few [[Christian]]s now live in the area, compared to Muslims and Jews. This is because Islam displaced Christianity in almost all of the Middle East, and the rise of modern [[Zionism]] and the establishment of the State of Israel has seen millions of Jews migrate to Israel. Recently, the Christian population in Israel has increased with the immigration of foreign workers from a number of countries, and the immigration of accompanying non-Jewish spouses in [[Interfaith marriage|mixed marriage]]s. Numerous churches have opened in [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref&gt;Adriana Kemp &amp; Rebeca Raijman, "Christian Zionists in the Holy Land: Evangelical Churches, Labor Migrants, and the Jewish State", ''Identities: Global Studies in Power and Culture'', 10:3, 295-318&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ramadan jerusalem kmhad.jpg|thumb|[[Ramadan]] decorations in [[Jerusalem]]]]
Jerusalem is a city of major religious significance for Muslims worldwide.
After capturing the Old City of Jerusalem in 1967, Israel found itself in control of Mount Moriah, which was the site of both Jewish temples and Islam's third holiest site, after those in [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] in [[Saudi Arabia]]: The ''[[Haram al Sharif]]'' ([[Temple Mount]]) from which Muslims believe that [[Mohammad]] ascended to Heaven. This mountain, which has the [[Dome of the Rock]] and the adjacent [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] on it, is the third-holiest site in Islam (and the holiest in Judaism). Since 1967, the Israeli government has granted authority to a [[Waqf]] to administer the area. Rumors that the Israeli government are seeking to demolish the Muslim sites have angered Muslims. These beliefs are possibly related to excavations that have been taking place close to the Temple Mount, with the intention of gathering archeological remnants of the first and second temple period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibleplaces.com/southerntm.htm|title=Southern Temple Mount|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp483.htm|title=The Destruction of the Temple Mount Antiquities, by Mark Ami-El|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the stance of some rabbis and activists who call for its destruction to replace it with the Third Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=172008|title=J'lem posters call for 3rd Temple|website=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Muslims in Israel are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Arab]]s with a small minority of [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi Arabs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t7Ao8dYsCskC&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title=The Arabs in Israel | accessdate=June 2, 2014 | author=Ori Stendel | page=45 | publisher=Sussex Academic Press | isbn=978-1898723240| year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1516 to 1917, the Sunni [[Ottoman Turks]] ruled the areas that now include Israel. Their rulership reinforced and ensured the centrality and importance of Islam as the dominant religion in the region. The [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|conquest of Palestine by the British]] in 1917 and the subsequent [[Balfour Declaration, 1917|Balfour Declaration]] opened the gates for the arrival of large numbers of Jews in Palestine who began to tip the scales in favor of Judaism with the passing of each decade. However, the British transferred the symbolic Islamic governance of the land to the [[Hashemite]]s based in [[Jordan]], and not to the [[House of Saud]]. The Hashemites thus became the official guardians of the Islamic holy places of Jerusalem and the areas around it, particularly strong when Jordan controlled the [[West Bank]] (1948–1967).

In 1922 the British had created the [[Supreme Muslim Council]] in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] and appointed [[Amin al-Husayni]] (1895–1974) as the Grand [[Mufti]] of Jerusalem. The council was disbanded by Jordan in 1951.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Israeli Muslims are free to teach Islam to their children in their own schools, and there are a number of Islamic universities and colleges in Israel and the territories. Islamic law remains the law for concerns relating to, for example, marriage, divorce, inheritance and other family matters relating to Muslims, without the need for formal recognition arrangements of the kind extended to the main Christian churches. Similarly Ottoman law, in the form of the [[Mecelle]], for a long time remained the basis of large parts of Israeli law, for example concerning land ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Guberman, Shlomo (2000).

====Ahmadiyya====
{{Main|Ahmadiyya in Israel}}
[[Ahmadiyya]] is a small Islamic sect in [[Israel]]. The history of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in Israel begins with a tour of the Middle East in 1924 made by the second [[Khalifatul Masih|caliph]] of the Community [[Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad]] and a number of missionaries. However, the Community was first established in the region in 1928, in what was then the British Mandate of Palestine. The first converts to the movement belonged to the ''Odeh'' tribe who originated from [[Ni'lin]], a small village near [[Jerusalem]]. In the 1950s they settled in Kababir, a former village which was later absorbed by the city of Haifa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Approaching conflict the Ahmadiyya way: The alternative way to conflict resolution of the Ahmadiyya community in Haifa, Israel | author=Emanuela C.

Israel is the only country in the Middle East where Ahmadi Muslims can openly practice their Islamic faith. As such, [[Kababir]], a neighbourhood on [[Mount Carmel]] in [[Haifa]], Israel, acts as the Middle Eastern headquarters of the Community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.haifatrail.com/haifa-trail-segment14-eng.htm#./images/sect-14/Haifa-Trail-Sect14-P1610817.jpg | title=Kababir and Central Carmel – Multiculturalism on the Carmel | accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.visit-haifa.org/eng/Kababir | title=Visit Haifa | accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown how many Israeli Ahmadis there are, although it is estimated there are about 2,200 Ahmadis in Kababir.&lt;ref name="israelandyou"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelandyou.com/kababir/ |title=Kababir |publisher=Israel and You |accessdate=February 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130170337/http://www.israelandyou.com/kababir/ |archivedate=January 30, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Western Wall]], a remnant of the Second Temple, is a holy site for Jews, second only to the [[Temple Mount]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.thekotel.org/content.asp?id=212 |publisher=The Kotel |title=What is the Western Wall? |accessdate=2007-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202235206/http://english.thekotel.org/content.asp?id=212 |archivedate=2007-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity reveres Jerusalem not only for its role in the [[Old Testament]] but also for its significance in the life of Jesus. The land currently occupied by the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] is considered one of the top candidates for [[Golgotha]] and thus has been a Christian pilgrimage site for the past two thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=St. John's Gospel: A Bible Study Guide and Commentary for Individuals and Groups |last=Ray |first=Stephen K. |isbn=978-0-89870-821-9 |date=October 2002 |page=340|publisher=Ignatius Press|location=San Francisco, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=PilgrFile: Adventures of the Spirit |last=O'Reilly |first=Sean |author2=James O'Reilly |isbn=978-1-885211-56-9 |date=2000-11-30 |publisher=Travelers' Tales |edition=1st |quote=The general consensus is that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre marks the hill called Golgotha, and that the site of the Crucifixion and the last five Stations of the Cross are located under its large black domes. |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, the [[Ottoman Empire]] allowed the Catholic Church to re-establish its hierarchy in Palestine.

Despite not being explicitly mentioned in the [[Quran]], Jerusalem is the third-holiest city in [[Islam]], after [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]].&lt;ref name="3rd-holiest"&gt;Third-holiest city in Islam:

==Religious relations==
{{Main|Religious relations in Israel}}

===Within the Jewish community===
{{See also|Haredim and Zionism}}
The State of Israel generally respects freedom of religion. [[Freedom House]] reports: "Freedom of religion is respected. Each community has jurisdiction over its own members in matters of marriage, burial, and divorce."

Religious tensions exist between Jewish ''[[Haredi Judaism|haredi]]'' and non-''haredi'' Israeli Jews. ''Haredi'' Israeli males devote their young adulthood to full-time [[Talmud]]ic studies and therefore generally get exemptions from military service in the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. Many leaders of ''haredi'' Judaism encourage these students to apply for exemptions from the mandatory army service, ostensibly to protect them from the secularizing influence of the Israeli army. Over the years, the number of exemptions has grown to about 10% of conscriptable manpower. Many secular Israelis consider these exemptions to be a systematic shirking of their patriotic duty by a large segment of society.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

''Haredi'' Israelis are represented by ''haredi'' political parties, which like all smaller parties in a system of [[proportional representation]] may tend to wield disproportionate political power at the point when government coalitions need to be negotiated following national elections. {{As of|2008|June}}, the two main Haredi parties in the [[Knesset]] are [[Shas]], representing [[Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi]] interests, and [[United Torah Judaism]], an alliance of [[Degel HaTorah]] (Lithuanian Haredi) and [[Agudath Yisrael]]. The [[Shinui]] party was created as a backlash to the perceived influence of the ''haredi'' parties, and to represent the interests of secular Jews that supposedly were not seen to by the other non-religious parties.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Tension also exists between the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] establishment and the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] movements. Only Orthodox Judaism is officially recognized in Israel (though conversions conducted by Conservative and Reform clergy outside of Israel may be accepted for the purposes of the [[Law of Return]]). As a result, Conservative and Reform synagogues receive minimal government funding and support. Conservative and Reform rabbis cannot officiate at religious ceremonies and any marriages, divorces, and conversions they perform are not considered valid. Conservative and Reform Jews have been prohibited from holding services at the Western Wall on the grounds that they violate Orthodox norms regarding participation of women.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Tensions exist surrounding [[Mehadrin bus lines]], a type of bus line in Israel which mostly runs in and/or between major Haredi population centers, in which gender segregation are applied. Non-Haredi female passengers have complained of being harassed and forced to sit at the back of the bus.&lt;ref name="jpost2"&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=Jerusalem Post |title=Egged launches 11 'mehadrin' bus lines |date=December 1, 2006 |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1164881792994 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130706010746/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1164881792994 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 6, 2013 |accessdate=2011-03-08 |first= |last= |first2= |last2= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ruling of January 2011, the [[Israeli High Court of Justice]] stated the unlawfulness of gender segregation and abolished the “mehadrin” public buses. However, the court rule allowed the continuation of the gender segregation in public buses on a strictly voluntary basis for a one-year experimental period.&lt;ref name="jpost1"&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=Jerusalem Post |title=Court scraps ‘mehadrin’ buses |date=January 6, 2011 |url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?ID=202456&amp;R=R1 |accessdate=2011-03-08 | first=Dan |last=Izenberg |first2=Jonah |last2=Mandel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between Jews and Christians===
[[Messianic Jews]] who are members of [[messiah|Messianic]] congregations are among the most active missionary movements in Israel. Their proselytising has faced demonstrations and intermittent protests by the [[Haredi]] anti-missionary group ''[[Yad LeAchim]]'', which infiltrates those movements, as well as other proselytising groups including [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] and [[Scientology]], and maintains extensive records on their activities. Attempts by Messianic Jews to evangelize other Jews are seen by many religious Jews as incitement to "[[idolatry in Judaism|avodah zarah]]" (foreign worship or idolatry). Over the years there have been several arson attempts of messianic congregations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Some Orthodox Jewish communities in Israel have come under scrutiny for the negative [[stereotyping]] and [[scapegoating]] of Christian minorities in the region, including violent acts against Christian missionaries and communities.&lt;ref name="jpal"&gt;Persecution of Christians in Israel: The New Inquisition, ''[[Journal of Palestine Studies]]'', Vol. 8, No. 1 (Autumn, 1978), pp. 135–140&lt;/ref&gt;

The Haredi Community Tribunal of Justice published a statement condemning the practice, stating that it was a "desecration of God's name". Several events were planned in 2010 by the liberal [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Yedidya congregation to show solidarity with Christians and improve relations between the Haredi and Christian communities of Jerusalem.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Marriage and divorce==
{{Main|Marriage in Israel}}
Currently, Israel issues marriage licenses if performed under an official religious authority (whether it be Orthodox Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Druze, etc.) only between a man and a woman of the same religion. Civil marriages were officially sanctioned only if performed abroad, but 2010 changes in Israeli law allow secular marriage in Israel for people that have proven to lack any religion also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=216326|title=Israeli couple become first to be wed in civil union|website=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/04/israel-to-allow-civil-mar_n_779183.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Josh | last=Fleet | title=Israel To Allow Civil Marriages | date=2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a major issue among secular groups, as well as adherents to non-Orthodox streams of Judaism. There is fear that civil marriage will divide the Jewish people in Israel between those who can marry Jews and those who cannot, leading to concerns over retaining the character of the [[Jewish state]].

'''SEED-SCALE''' describes a comprehensive theory of [[social change]] sometimes also categorized as [[social development theory]]. SEED-SCALE can be used both to tell how to implement change and/or it can be used to analyze social change. SEED-SCALE's distinguishing feature is its focus on human energy as the primary currency that causes people to change behaviors.

Normative thinking is that by allocating money to social programs (funding a health service, starting a micro-finance program, providing subsidies for agriculture, etc.) that intentional social action happens. SEED-SCALE does not deny the impact of budget driven projects. However, it suggests that a more available and sustainable approach is redirecting how people apply their energies. "Money is powerful because other people want it or because every all want it… This means, among other things, that if it is taken to be the central factor in social change initiatives, those who do not have it (including countries, including people—the people who need it most) are powerless."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel C. Taylor, Carl E. Taylor, Jesse O. Taylor, ''Empowerment on an Unstable Planet: From Seeds of Human Energy to a Scale of Global Change'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2012) p.xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

SEED-SCALE notes that human energy is a resource that is already present, already being used in every community in the world. If the community exists, it has energy. The opportunity is to use that resource more effectively &amp; timely. There are many types of relevant human energies: individual labor, cooperation, creativity, monitoring, learning, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel C. Taylor, Carl E. Taylor, Jesse O. Taylor, ''Empowerment on an Unstable Planet: From Seeds of Human Energy to a Scale of Global Change'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; SEED-SCALE is an application of [[emergence]] within [[Complexity economics|complexity theory]], articulating how social change "emerges" with socio-economic development specific to each context of society, economics, and natural environment shaped by the interaction of these relationships; noting that the socio-economic product is not the result of inputs to the system (classical development thinking) but is the result of how relationships form within the system as a result of principle interaction ([[emergence]]).

SEED-SCALE builds out of the most forward economic thinking, such as former World Bank economist, [[Paul Collier]], "change in societies at the very bottom must come primarily from within."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Collier, ''The Bottom Billion: Why the poorest countries are failing and what can be done about it'' (Oxford UK: Oxford University Press, 2007) p.xi&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Dani Rodrik]] at Harvard, frames economic growth at the scale level as a consequence of growth aggregated from the local level, growing within the existing larger framework. Local growth occurs not because of inputs from outside but because it has figured out how to occur within the local situation of policies, stimuli, and resources.&lt;ref&gt;Dani Rodrik, ''One Economics, Many Recipes: Globalization, Institutions, and Economic Growth'' (Princeton NJ: Princeton University Press, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origins==
The origins of SEED-SCALE began in [[UNICEF]] in 1992—when the then Executive Director [[James P. Grant]] was seeking a more accurate understanding of how to take successful pilot projects ("seeds") and to extend these to national level impact ("scale"). From the initial 1992 UNICEF charge two publications resulted.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Taylor and Carl E. Taylor ''Community Based Sustainable Human Development—Going to Scale with Self-reliant Social Development'' (New York: UNICEF, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl E. Taylor. Aditi Desai, and Daniel Taylor "Partnership for Social Development—A Casebook" The Independent Task Force on Community Action for Social Development (Franklin, WV, Future Generations, and Johns Hopkins University Department of International Health, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; These publications were presented at the World Summit for Social Development, Copenhagen, March 1995.

SEED-SCALE resides within the larger field of [[emergence]] and [[Complexity economics|complexity theory]]. The thesis is that social change occurs within the complex intersection of people's values, economic dynamics, and environmental conditions (the socio-econo-info-biosphere), and that to either understand or to act in that complex world, answers do not directly follow from actions; they "emerge" out of interacting relationships in almost incomprehensible ways, obvious perhaps after the fact but impossible to predict ahead of time.&lt;ref&gt;John Holland, ''Emergence: From chaos to order'' (New York: Basic Books, 1998) p. 224-227.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent articulation of empowerment as basis of social change championed by [[Robert Chambers (development scholar)|Robert Chambers]], who led in the development of participatory research and action (also called [[participatory rural appraisal]]) (PRA) "astonished by the analytical abilities of poor people. Whether literate or not, whether children, women, or men, they showed that they could map, list, rank, score, and diagram better than professionals."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Chambers, ''Whose Reality Counts, Putting the Last First'' (London: Intermediate Technology Development Group Publishing, 2000, p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt; Key contributions to the thinking also came from [[asset-based community development]] (ABCD)&lt;ref&gt;Gary Paul Green and Anna Haines, ''Asset Based Community Development, 2nd Edition'' (Thousand Oaks CA: Sage Publications 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; and the theory of [[positive deviance]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pascale, Jerry Sternin, and Monique Sternin ''The Power of Positive Deviance: How Unlikely Innovators Solve the World's Toughest Problems'' (Boston, MA: Harvard Business Press, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

SEED is an acronym for ''Self Evaluation for Effective Decision-making''. SCALE is an acronym for ''Systems for Communities to Adapt Learning and Expand''.

==Core argument==
Deep fundamental change happens because of what people do (not what they are given, not what is done to them). When people learn to make use of what they have, where they are, today—then people are moving forward to a future that they can shape according to their priorities.
[[File:Revolution of Rising Aspirations.jpg|thumb|The Revolution of Rising Aspirations]]

A feedback loop, a revolution of rising aspirations, gets started—where people's hopes cause them to work, then that work produces returns, those returns prompt further work, and this circle calls more people in working with their aspirations. As actions get fulfilled and cause new aspirations, what unfolds is society using what it has, for what it wants, and now calling in resources and action from outside.

===Key principles===
# Build from Success—Don't try to fix failures (note: given that failures are complex eco-systems of individual and community expenditures or experiments with social development, failures should not be completely ignored but understood as historical reservoirs that may inform the successful strategies that the SEED-SCALE practitioner(s) are linking together to generate local change in the present)    
# [[Climate Change Adaptation in Nepal|3-way Partnership]] (Top-down, Bottom-up, and Outside-in)—Three types of partnerships are needed for sustainable development. One is Top-down, involving collaboration among community, government officials, and international financial providers. The other is Bottom-up, involving collaboration within a community to frame and act on priorities. The third is Outside-in, which includes involvement of academia and other development partners, such as the Civil Society organizations and NGOs.   
# Decide from Evidence—Power Money Dogma not reliable answers
# Behavior Change is the Goal—Prescribed outputs can be faked

Discussions of the four principles are at:

# Fit your local situation (ecology, economy, &amp; culture) = Self-evaluation survey
# Determine direction &amp; partners = Make a work plan
# Coordinate resources &amp; time = Gather community participation
# Readjust community momentum = To strengthen four principles

===Criteria for evaluation===
*EQUITY=Are more community members involved this time?
*SUSTAINABILITY=Three types exist: environmental, economic, values/culture
*HOLISM=Is life improving in a balanced way
*INTERDEPENDENCE=What is balance in community between inflows and outflows
*ITERATION=Get job done, next time do it better

===Stages of scale===
The scaling up process is a feedback loop of rising quality of life that then draws a rising number of participants into it. As more people become involved, their energy stimulates demand for further rising quality of life (typically moving cross sectors such as from health to income generation). Then the rising quality of life draws in more people. The cycle goes on of numerical growth feeding qualitative so long as there is an enabling environment for such of policies and learning that draws on local resource base or distant resources that can be accessed from locales.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.future.org/applied-research/process-change/going-scale&lt;/ref&gt;

# Numerical Expansion = SCALE One (Stimulating Community Awareness, Learning, and Energy)
# Rising sophistication and quality of life = SCALE Squared (Self-help Centers for Action Learning and Experimentation)
# Expanding the Enabling Environment = SCALE Cubed (Synthesis of Collaboration, Adaptive Learning, and Extension)
Future Generations Graduate School (FGGS) 2015 class, on a residential in India learned on the practical applicability of the SEED Scale in Sevagram (Feb. 09-March 12, 2014).
It is an empowering concept that can grow to scale any initiative in the local community whose benefits are long lasting.This is an alternative development paradigm. The different economic development models which have been existing have all but shown their limits. SEED scale appears to be a good alternative for African countries.

A '''''Sabra''''' ({{lang-he-n|צבר}}, ''tzabar'') is a [[Jews|Jew]] born on [[Israel]]i territory. The term first appeared in the 1930s to refer to a Jew who had been born in the [[land of Israel]] (inclusive of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] and [[Ottoman Palestine]]; ''cf. [[New Yishuv]] &amp; [[Old Yishuv]]''). Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, Israelis have used the word to refer to a Jewish person born anywhere in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The term alludes to a tenacious, thorny desert plant, known in English as [[Opuntia ficus-indica|prickly pear]], with a thick skin that conceals a sweet, softer interior. The cactus [[National personification|is compared]] to [[Israeli Jews]], who are supposedly tough on the outside, but delicate and sweet on the inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=13263 |title=Hard on the outside, soft on the inside, and extinct? |publisher=[[Israel Hayom]] |date= November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, over 4,000,000 Israeli Jews (70%) were sabras, with an even greater percentage of Israeli Jewish youths falling into this category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3877574,00.html |title=Israel at 62: Population of 7,587,000 - Israel News, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynet.co.il |date=1995-06-20 |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, about 75% of Israel's Jewish population was native-born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4649494,00.html|title=8,345,000 people living in Israel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Aliyah}}
[[File:Israeli flag &amp; cactus.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A cactus flowerpot with the [[flag of Israel]]]]
According to ''The Dictionary of Slang (Hebrew)'' by Israeli linguist Ruvik Rosenthal, [[Olim|Jewish immigrants to Palestine]] began using the term in the early 1930s. The term was used by the [[Zionist movement]], to celebrate the "New Jew" that [[Nation-building|emerged]] in the Holy Land. Unlike the [[bourgeois]] "[[Diaspora Jew|Old Jew]]" born in the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]], the "New Jew" was a [[kibbutz]] member or a farmer. The "Old Jew" often spoke broken Hebrew with a heavy accent, while the sabra spoke the [[Hebrew revival|language as a mother tongue]]. Unlike the "Old Jew" who did not fight for his self-defense, the Sabra fought in the Jewish resistance movements, in the [[Palmach]] and after the establishment of Israel in the [[Israel Defense Forces]].

An important influence on the Sabra personality was considered the participation in national youth movements, (such as the [[Hanoar Haoved Vehalomed]], [[Hashomer Hatzair]] and [[Hitachdut Hatsofim Ve Hatsofot Be Israel|Hatsofim]]) followed by the universal participation in military service for both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;''Israel: the Sword and the Harp: The Mystique of Violence and the Mystique of Redemption; Controversial Themes in Israeli Society'', Ferdynand Zweig, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1970, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The sociological&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpost.com/archives/news/the-myth-of-the-israeli-sabra.html|title=JewishPost.com - The Myth of the Israeli Sabra|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; characteristics of the sabra were examined by [[Oz Almog]] in his book ''The Sabra: The Creation of the New Jew''.&lt;ref&gt;Almog, Oz. 2000. The Sabra the creation of the new Jew. The S. Mark Taper Foundation imprint in Jewish studies. Berkeley: University of California Press. pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; According to Almog the term "Tzabar" originated from the insult "Sabras" directed towards migrants of the [[First Aliyah]] (which consisted of the first generation of native born members of the Zionist movement) by migrants of the [[Second Aliyah]] and the [[Third Aliyah]]. The [[Neologism|changing of the meaning]] of the term, to emphasize the softer interior rather than the roughness, was done by the journalist [[Uri Kesari]] who published an essay, "We Are the Leaves of the Sabra!", on 18 April 1931 in the newspaper [[Doar Hayom|Doar HaYom]] in which he argued against the discrimination which was cast against the native-born by the new immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balashon.com/2008/03/tzabar.html Tzabar] Balashon - Hebrew Language Detective&lt;/ref&gt;

The prestige of the Sabra increased during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. The Israeli public, and especially the older generation, tended to attribute the achievements of the war to the country's "sabras", while minimizing the part of the new immigrants and other groups. Even descriptions of the achievements of [[Operation Kadesh]] (1956) emphasized the image of the Sabra. The [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands|large immigration to Israel of Jews from Muslim countries]] during the 1950s, the penetration of Western culture and primarily the American culture, as well as the social and political changes which were created following the [[Six-Day War]] and [[Yom Kippur War]], resulted in a decline of the use of the term after the 1970s.

In relation, those who were born in the country after independence in 1948 became known as the "Dor haMedina" ({{lang-he|דור המדינה}}), or "Statehood Generation", and have been largely described by cultural commentators as being motivated less by the strident nationalism and/or socialism of the pre-independence generations and more by a general cultural pragmatism and sensitivity to the mass-cultural output of Western powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/jerusalem-babylon-returning-to-the-source-of-it-all-1.345554 |title=Jerusalem &amp; Babylon / Returning to the source of it all|author=Anshel Pfeffer|work=Haaretz|date=&lt;!--02:10--&gt; 25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In culture ==
[[File:Srulik.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Srulik]] in the Israeli museum of cartoons and comics in [[Holon]].]]
The Sabra received an artistic and symbolic representation in the form of the illustrated character "[[Srulik]]" (which wears [[shorts]], [[sandals]] and a [[Tembel hat]]), created by cartoonist [[Kariel Gardos|Dosh]]. Another character which became famous was the Israeli children's television character [[Kishkashta]], a talking anthropomorphic cactus.

The English form of the word, Sabra, served Israeli manufacturers who wanted to brand their products as typical Israeli products, which was sold in the foreign markets. As a result, "[[Sabra liqueur]]" and "Sabra sport" (the sports model of the "[[Autocars Co.|Sussita]]") were created. The world's largest hummus manufacturer (as of 2009) is a U.S. company called the [[Sabra (company)|Sabra Dipping Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Aviv Levy|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?QUID=1055,U1259186350557&amp;did=1000517051|script-title=he:זינוק במכירות חומוס שטראוס בארה"ב: כבשה 40% מהשוק|date=25 November 2009 |work=[[Globes]] |accessdate=25 November 2009|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular culture, an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' contained a skit entitled "Sabra Price Is Right" featuring [[Tom Hanks]] as the guest host.  The skit was written by [[Robert Smigel]] and is a parody of Israel-born Jews making bargains with people who believe this show is ''[[The Price Is Right]]''. In the skit, Hanks' character "Uri Shurinson" and the other Sabra are swindling the contestants, conning them into purchasing shoddy products (a Summit clock-radio, a "Pinnacle satellite dish" that's a v-aerial, a cordless phone that's a defective rotary phone, a microwave that's a toaster oven, a CD-player that's a child's bank, and a defective buzzer from the game show itself) for which they guess the price rather than winning them. The skit concludes with an [[Arab]] portrayed by [[Dana Carvey]] who bargains in the same manner as the Sabra and in the middle of their argument, they all "disco" as the skit concludes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1682221/sabra_price_is_right/ |title=Sabra Price is Right - Video |publisher=Metacafe.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A skit featured in an earlier SNL episode was entitled "Sabra Shopping Network" and also featured Uri (Tom Hanks) and his crew, this time bargaining with callers phoning into a television shopping show.

The American comedy film ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]'' plays heavily on sabra [[National stereotype|stereotypes]] in an amicable manner.

== In politics ==
The first ''sabra'' to exercise the powers of the office of the Prime Minister of Israel was [[Yigal Allon]], who served as acting prime minister from February to March 1969; he was born in [[Kfar Tavor]]. The first ''sabra'' to serve as Prime Minister rather than acting Prime Minister was [[Yitzhak Rabin]], who first held the office 1974–77, and then again 1992–1995. Since Rabin first took office, there have been four other ''sabra'' Prime Ministers: the current Prime Minister, [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], is the first and (so far) only ''sabra'' Prime Minister to have been born in the modern state after Israel's declaration of independence in 1948; he first took office in 1996, before leaving office in 1999 and returning in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18008697 |title=Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[Ehud Barak]], [[Ariel Sharon]], and [[Ehud Olmert]] were all born in what is now the territory of the State of Israel during the Mandate period.

===Statehood Generation leaders===
In addition to Netanyahu being the first of the Statehood Generation to serve as Prime Minister, [[Avraham Burg]], speaker of the Knesset from 1999-2003, was also the first Speaker to have been born in the modern state since 1948.

'''Sapuan''' (autonym: ''səpuar'') is a [[Mon–Khmer languages|Mon–Khmer language]] spoken in the single village of Ban Sapuan, located approximately 40&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Attapeu]]. Jacq and Sidwell (1999) provide a short grammar. Sidwell (2003) reports a population of just under 1,000. Chazée (1999:93) gives a lower estimate of 480.

'''Ceylonese / Sri Lankans in Singapore''' consist mainly of Singaporeans of [[Sri Lanka]]n origin whose ancestors came to Singapore before the independence of the island. In Singapore, Ceylonese / Sri Lankans are referred to as Others usually.

==Colonial period==

The [[Jaffna]] [[Sri Lankan Tamils|Tamils]] are predominantly large in number among the people who went to [[Straits Settlements|Singapore]] and [[British Malaya|Malaya]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lankanewspapers.com/news/2011/5/67104_space.html LankaNewspapers.com - Tamils appointed for Key positions in SINGAPORE - Jaffna originated becomes deputy PM]&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since their arrival in Singapore, they were identifying themselves "Ceylonese". They dominated the bureaucracy in Singapore as the British preferred employing the Ceylonese as bureaucrats in many of their Asian colonies. Ceylonese Tamils made up an overwhelming majority in the civil service of British Malaya and Singapore prior to independence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?240486 Outlook India.com - The Jaffna Tamils ]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Circular reference|date=December 2016}}

In 1909, the Ceylon Tamils, who had grown in number to about 300 families, formed the Singapore Ceylon Tamils’ Association (SCTA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senpaga.org.sg/history.asp Sri Senpaga Vinayagar Temple - History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210230115/http://www.senpaga.org.sg/history.asp |date=2012-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sri Lankans in [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]] formed the 'Lanka Regiment' of the [[Indian National Army]], directly under Netaji [[Subhas Chandra Bose]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lankalibrary.com/geo/japan3.htm lankalibrary.com - Four Lankans die in secret 'independence' war]&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Singaporean Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] once said:
{{quote|In terms of numbers, the Ceylonese, like the [[Eurasians in Singapore|Eurasians]], are among the smallest of our various communities. Yet in terms of achievements and contributions to the growth and development of the modern Singapore and Malaysia they have done more than warranted by their numbers. In the early days of Malaysia's and Singapore's history the civil service and the professions were manned by a good number of Ceylonese. Even today the Ceylonese community continues to play a prominent role in these and other fields of civil life.

For example in Singapore, today, the Speaker of Parliament is a Ceylonese. So is our High Commissioner in Great Britain. So is our [[S. Rajaratnam|Foreign Minister]]. In the Judiciary, in the civil service, in the university, in the medical Service and in the professions they continue to make substantial contributions out of all proportion to their numbers. They are there not because they are members of a minority community but on the basis of merit.

The point is that the Ceylonese are holding their own in open competition with communities far larger than them. They have asked for no special favour or consideration as a minority. What they have asked for – and quite rightly – is that they should be judged on their merits and that they be allowed to compete with all other citizens fairly and without discrimination. This, as far as the Singapore government is concerned, is what is best for all of us. I believe that the future belongs to that society which acknowledges and rewards ability, drive and high performance without regard to race, language or religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SPEECH BY MR CHAN SOO SEN, PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY (PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE &amp; MINISTRY OF HEALTH) AND MP FOR EAST COAST GRC (JOO CHIAT), AT THE LAUNCH OF THE RENEWAL AND REBUILDING OF SRI SENPAGA VINAYAGAR TEMPLE ON SUNDAY, 21 MAY 2000|url=http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/speeches/view-html?filename=2000052101.htm|publisher=[[National Archives of Singapore]]|date=21 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some Ceylonese-founded institutions from the colonial era still exist. The [[Sri Senpaga Vinayagar Temple]] was founded by [[Sri Lankan Tamils|Ceylonese Tamils]] on the appropriately named Ceylon Road. [http://cscsingapore.org.sg/ Ceylon Sports Club] was established in 1928 at its current premises along [[Balestier|Balester Road]] and continues to function as not only a sports club but a social and charitable institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://cscsingapore.org.sg/about-us/history/|publisher=cscsingapore.org.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12625">By January 2011 the [[United Nations]] High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that there are 262,900 '''Sudanese refugees in Chad'''. The majority of them left [[Sudan]] escaping from the violence of the ongoing [[Darfur crisis]], which began in 2003. UNHCR has given the Sudanese refugees shelter in 12 different camps situated along the Chadian-Sudanese border. The most pressing issues UNHCR has to deal with in the refugee camps in [[Chad]] are related to insecurity in the camps, (where children are being forcibly recruited by Chadian and Sudanese armed groups), malnutrition, access to water, HIV and AIDS, and education.&lt;ref name="www.unhcr.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/page?page=49e45c226 |title=2012 UNHCR country operations profile-Chad |deadurl=no |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Displacement between Chad and Sudan ==
Sudan and Chad are both guests and hosts to thousands of refugees from the other country. There are 304,650 Sudanese refugees in Chad as of April, 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unhcr.org/afr/protection/operations/524d81849/chad-fact-sheet.html|title=Chad Fact Sheet|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|work=UNHCR|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 8,000 Chadian refugees in Sudan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNHCR|url=http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e483b76.html|work=2011 UNHCR country operation profile-Sudan|accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the majority of which sought refuge escaping from violence and conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Organization for Migration|url=http://www.iom.int/jahia/Jahia/pid/383|work=Sudan, country profile|accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Droughts, famines and political and armed conflicts have pushed Chadians and Sudanese alike in and out of their territories. For instance, Chadians have sought refuge in Sudan during the 1913-4 famine, the 1973 drought, and between 1979 and 1982 Sudan hosted 16,000 supporters of the Chadian leader Hissene Habre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Waal|first=A.|title=Refugees and the Creation of Famine: the case of Dar Masalit, Sudan|journal=Journal of Refugee Studies|year=1988|volume=1|series=2|pages=136|doi=10.1093/jrs/1.2.127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sudan and Chad have also shared seasonal migratory patterns, in particular the area inhabited by the Masalit people, an ethnic group that shares a common language and that was separated when the contemporary borders of the states of Sudan and Chad were drawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Magazine of the International Red Cross|url=http://www.redcross.int/EN/mag/magazine2005_2/22-23.html|work=Darfur's refugees in Chad|publisher=Red Cross|accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This seasonal migration entails the displacement of people between southeastern Chad and Darfur (Sudan), being the dry season when people are more mobile, roads are open and regional markets are integrated. Chadians move to southeastern areas into Sudan looking for food, water and income until the rainy seasons, when they return to their villages and sow their crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Waal|first=A|title=Refugees and the Creation of FamineThe Case of Dar Masalit, Sudan|year=1988|volume=1|series=2|pages=129–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sudan’s Conflicts ==

Since the time Sudan became independent in 1956 from the British and Egyptian condominium, it has experienced 21 years of civil wars between the North and the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IOM |url=http://www.iom.int/jahia/Jahia/chad |work=Chad country profile |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war ended with signature of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in 2005, which stipulated the autonomy of South Sudan for six years followed by a referendum of self-determination that took place in January 2011. Southern Sudanese voters overwhelmingly opted for the independence of [[South Sudan]], which will become a separate and independent state on 9 July 2011.

In 2003 the conflicts over land and water that had been ongoing in Darfur for decades took the shape of a civil war when the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) announced their existence and started fighting against the Janjaweed, a tribal militia backed by the Sudanese central government that had been attacking and razing villages in Darfur for a number of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc/20297_30568.html |publisher=UNICEF |title=Darfur (Sudan/Chad) Region in crisis |deadurl=no |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2003, at least 300,000 people have been killed and 1.8 million people have been displaced in Darfur. The Darfur crisis still continues.  In the first four months of 2011 more than 70,000 people have fled their homes and taken refuge in camps established for displaced persons in Darfur. The Obama administration is pushing towards solving the conflict in Darfur before the independence of South Sudan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Biden says 'great concern\ over Darfur security|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hIGQ-OtyJl-bkUZZS7kpaZ2V_xVw?docId=CNG.d82a43e2d95eff64a2a1f60f64f85948.121|accessdate=22 April 2011|newspaper=AFP|date=9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; although reaching a peace agreement remains unlikely.&lt;ref name="iom.int"&gt;{{cite web|title=IOM|url=http://www.iom.int/jahia/Jahia/chad|work=Chad country profile|accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimated in the end of 2010 that between 1.2 and 1.7 million Sudanese live abroad, and that neighboring countries were hosting more than half of them. Since the signature of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2005, the Sudanese government, in cooperation with UNHCR, has signed tripartite agreements with Kenya, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, Ethiopia and Uganda in order to organize the return of Sudanese refugees. The year 2007 registered a peak of returnees, 126,000, which has been decreasing during the following years: 70,000 in 2008 and 30,000 in 2009, the majority of which returned from Uganda. These return programs have efficiently reduced the number of Sudanese refugees in neighboring countries, which went from 635,000 in 2006 to the current figure of 390,000. Almost all of them have refugee status or protection (around 385,117) and live in Chad, Egypt, Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="iom.int"/&gt;

== Sudanese refugee camps in Chad ==

Chad hosts the largest community of Sudanese refugees, approximately 262,900 by the beginning of 2011, of whom 248,700 are assisted by the UNHCR in camps located along the Chadian-Sudanese border.&lt;ref name="www.unhcr.org"/&gt; Due to the renewal of fighting in Darfur between the rebel group Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and the Sudanese government, approximately 5,000 Sudanese have crossed the border to Chad in April 2010.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Rights Watch|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/world-report-2011/chad|work=World Report 2011: Chad|accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second largest group of refugees in Chad is from the Central African Republic, approximately 73,500 persons. In addition, the UNHCR also gives assistance to 157,200 internally displaced persons, 1,500 returnees and 35,000 displaced returnees. The total number of people assisted by UNHCR on January 2011 were 530,590.&lt;ref name="www.unhcr.org"/&gt; This large number is a reflection of the conflicts and the general insecurity that proliferate in this region of Africa.

Most of the Sudanese refugees that arrive to Chad are escaping from the Darfur crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HNTS-SISN,|url=http://www.thehnts.org/useruploads/files/chad/chad_analysis_sept_2010.pdf|work=Health and Nutrition Tracking Service, Chad-Analysis|accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNHCR has established 12 camps to house them near along the border with Sudan. The camps are organized in different sectors divided by wide dirt roads, which are at the same time divided in blocks. Every refugee camp has a medical center, schools and a market, where refugees can buy or sell clothes, vegetables and goat meat. There is also a point for food distribution in each camp, to where World Food Program trucks bring the food rations (packages consisting of flour, vegetable oil, some cereal grains, sugar and salt) that are distributed to women on a monthly basis. Each family is provided a tent, which has an open fireplace for cooking and a storage place for firewood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herz|first=M.|title=Refugee camps in Chad: planning strategies and the architect’s involvement in the humanitarian dilemma|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,RESEARCH,TCD,456d621e2,4c2472ec0,0.html|publisher=UNHCR, Policy Development and Evaluation Service, Research Paper No. 147, December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues in the camps ==

=== Security ===
UNHCR is facing real obstacles in maintaining security in and around the camps. For years now refugees and international organization have reported thousands of human trafficking cases in the camps, where boys between the age of nine and fifteen are being recruited, forcibly or willingly, by Chadian and Sudanese armed groups. In 2007, the UN estimated that between 7,000 and 10,000 boys had been forcibly recruited in Chad to become soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Darfur’s child refugees being sold to militias|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/06/sudan.humanrights|accessdate=15 May 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNICEF is putting a great effort on dealing with this problem, and from 2007 to 2010 it had demobilized more than 800 child soldiers, most of whom had been recruited into Chadian rebel groups. In June 2010, the Chadian government together with five other Central African countries agreed on the "N’Djamena Declaration" which calls on stopping child recruitment in armed groups and on the integration of child soldiers into civilian society.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"/&gt;

Children in the Chadian refugee camps are also vulnerable to gender-based violence, sexual harassment, prostitution and early marriage. UNICEF has reported that girls as young as 12 are forced to marry and bear children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/chad_50047.html |publisher=UNICEF |title=Ensuring a right to special protection for vulnerable child refugees in Chad |deadurl=no |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nutrition ===
Insecurity has prevented nutrition surveys in the camps in 2009 ad 2010. According to a survey conducted in August 2008, [[acute malnutrition]] is still found among 10 percent of the camps’ population. Despite the precarious situation, it represents an improvement if compared with to 2004 (over 30 percent) and 2005 (more than 25 percent), when most of the refugees were arriving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HNTS-SISN |url=http://www.thehnts.org/useruploads/files/chad/chad_analysis_sept_2010.pdf |work=Health and Nutrition Tracking Service, Chad-Analysis |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water ===
In the camps located in northeastern Chad access to potable water is still a main challenge. At the beginning of 2011 UNHCR placed as a priority in this area the completion of boreholes and the installation of manual pumps in order to reduce dependency on electrical equipment. Provision of water in the refugee camps is 15 liters per day.&lt;ref name="www.unhcr.org"/&gt;

=== HIV and AIDS ===
According to UNHCR the risk of [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]] has been reduced due to prevention activities.&lt;ref name="www.unhcr.org"/&gt;

=== Education ===
In 2005 primary schools and education centers were established in the refugee camps with an enrollment capacity of 44,000 children. Schooling in the camps has entailed for half of the children their first chance to learn how to read and write. According to UNICEF, these schools and centers do not only provide education, but also  "a sense of routine and normalcy for children caught up in conflict", access to clean water and sanitation, physical protections for refugee children and also for Chadian children from neighboring villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNICEF|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/sudan_25018.html|work=Darfur refugees fuel tension in Chad, 1 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNHCR’s strategies for 2011 regarding education is to improve its quality, build more schools and provide expand the post-primary education programs.&lt;ref name="www.unhcr.org"/&gt;

}}
[[Image:Construccion-Carretera Villa Tunari - San Ignacio de Moxos.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Construction of the highway, as observed by a UN-''Página Siete'' team, July 2011]]

The '''Villa Tunari – San Ignacio de Moxos Highway''', also known as the '''Cochabamba–Beni Highway''' is a road project in Bolivia connecting the towns of [[Villa Tunari]] (in [[Cochabamba Department]]) and [[San Ignacio de Moxos]] (in [[Beni Department]]). It would provide the first direct highway link between the two departments. The project has an expected overall cost of $415 million and extends {{convert|306|km|mi}}, divided into three segments: Segment I from Villa Tunari to Isinuta ({{convert|47|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}}), Segment II from Isinuta to Monte Grande ({{convert|177|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}}), and Segment III from Monte Grande to San Ignacio de Moxos ({{convert|82|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref name=Op9April&gt;{{Cite news | title = Diputados aprueban contrato para construir vía Villa Tunari-San Ignacio | work = Opinión | accessdate = 2011-10-03 | date = 2011-04-09 | url = http://www.opinion.com.bo/opinion/articulos/2011/0409/noticias.php?id=7354 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to the highway by local indigenous communities, environmentalists, as well as shifting relations between the Bolivian government and the project's builders and funders interrupted construction of Segment I from October 2011 until October 2013, indefinitely delayed Segment II, and postponed construction of Segment III until June 2015. The government has pledged to improve standards of living in the region before continuing with Segment II.

While the highway has been discussed for decades, a $332 million loan from [[Brazil]]'s National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES), approved by Bolivia in 2011, facilitated the start of construction.&lt;ref name=Op9April /&gt; Under the terms of the loan, the Brazilian construction firm OAS was to build the road. In June 2011, President [[Evo Morales]] inaugurated the project with a ceremony at Villa Tunari. However, neither a final design nor environmental approval had been released for Segment II. Opposition from indigenous residents in the [[Isiboro Sécure National Park and Indigenous Territory]] (TIPNIS) and environmentalists led to a protracted public conflict about the highway, ending with the prohibition of highway passing through the park.  President Morales has stated that the controversy over the highway has "instilled fear" in potential financial backers of other highway projects in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Conflictos por el Tipnis "metieron miedo" a financiadores de carreteras en Beni | work = Grupo Fides | accessdate = 2014-01-16 | date = 2013-11-18 | url = http://mail.radiofides.com/noticia/social/Conflictos_por_el_Tipnis_metieron_miedo__a_financiadores_de_carreteras_en_Beni }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government has remained publicly committed to the project while revising its timeline. The segment of the road from Villa Tunari to Insinuta was built between 2013 and 2016; the northern segment from Monte Grande and San Ignacio de Moxos is under construction. While Segment II within TIPNIS remains prohibited, initial construction work on the highway there was carried out in 2017. An August 2017 law repealed special protections for the park and authorized the drafting of a transportation plan for TIPNIS.

==Proposals==
Proposals for a highway linking the region of [[San Ignacio de Moxos]] with Cochabamba have been raised perennially in the history of the region.

Ignacio Flores, the Spanish governor of Mojos proposed opening a road from Cochabamba to Mojos via the [[Chapare Province|Chapare]] in 1780. The purpose of the proposal was threefold: to encourage re-settlement of Cochabambinos in the region, where they could grow coca, sugar and other crops; to assist in the civilizing of the Yuracaré people, most of whom continued to resist missionary influence; and to bring Mojos into the economic orbit of Cochabamba, bypassing the control of [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = El camino a través del Tipnis, ¿un  proyecto colonial del siglo XVIII? | work = Los Tiempos | accessdate = 2012-03-04 | date = 2012-02-28 | url = http://www.lostiempos.com/lecturas/varios/varios/20120226/el-camino-a-traves-del-tipnis-un-proyecto-colonial-del-siglo_161702_338318.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Route and Segments ==
The proposed {{convert|306|km|mi}} route is divided into three segments, numbered from south to North.  Segment I from Villa Tunari to Isinuta ({{convert|47|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}}), Segment II from Isinuta to Santo Domingo ({{convert|177|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}}), and Segment III from Santo Domingo to San Ignacio de Moxos ({{convert|82|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}}). Current work on Segment III begins at Monte Grande, covering the northern 76&amp;nbsp;km of this segment.

==Construction and contractors==
OAS, a Brazilian infrastructure corporation, won the contract to build the highway in 2008. Bolivia and the [[Brazilian Development Bank]] (BNDES) signed Financial Collaboration Contract N° 10219991 on February 15, 2011, in which the bank extended a $332-million loan to support construction. OAS' work on the road lasted from June 2011 to April 2012, although Segment II was halted in October 2011. On April 10, 2012, President Morales announced the cancellation of the contract, citing delays in construction as well as other technical failures on the part of OAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Evo anuncia decisión de anular contrato con OAS para carretera | work = La Razón | accessdate = 2014-01-15 | date = 2012-04-11 | url = http://www.la-razon.com/nacional/Evo-decision-contrato-OAS-carretera_0_1594040630.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brazilian development bank, which had agreed to the loan financing the bulk of the project contingent on the use of OAS, immediately withdrew its funding and has stated that not one dollar of the loan was disbursed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Carretera por el TIPNIS ya no tiene financiamiento | work = Opinión | accessdate = 2014-01-15 | date = 2012-06-15 | url = http://www.opinion.com.bo/opinion/articulos/2012/0615/noticias.php?id=60112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, 2012, a new contract assigned $32.5 million for the construction of the 47-km Segment I from Villa Tunari and Insinuta. The newly created state-owned Bolivian Enterprise for Construction ({{lang-es|Empresa Boliviana de Construcción}}, EBC) and the local, cocalero-owned Association for Road Maintenance (A''sociación de Mantenimiento Vial''; AMVI) were awarded the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Contrato para la construcción del tramo Villa Tunari-Isinuta | work = Empresa Estrategica Boliviana de Construccion | accessdate = 2014-01-15 | date = 2012-10-06 | url = http://www.ebc.gob.bo/index.php?ID=NoticiaPortada&amp;resp=154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They resumed construction on October 24, 2013, and are obligated to complete their work by September 9, 2015. As of December 2013, the firms reported 30% completion of their work on the segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = El tramo Villa Tunari-Isinuta tiene un avance del 30% | work = Página Siete | accessdate = 2014-01-15 | date = 2013-12-13 | url = http://www.paginasiete.bo/nacional/2013/12/13/tramo-villa-tunari-isinuta-tiene-avance-8606.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Segment II was finally completed in 2016, and was formally opened on September 11.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On June 27, 2015, a binational Bolivian-Venezuelan military unit began construction of Segment III from San Ignacio de Moxos to Santo Domingo. The government announced that $144 million would be invested in building this northern segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Inician la construcción de plataforma en vía al TIPNIS - La Razón| accessdate = 2015-06-29| url = http://la-razon.com/seguridad_nacional/Gobierno-inician-construccion-plataforma-via-TIPNIS_0_2297770226.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 29, 2016, President Morales announced a $20 million government investment through the Agency for the Development of Macroregions and Frontier Zones (''Agencia para el Desarrollo de las Macroregiones y Zonas Fronterizas''; ADEMAF) to build the earthen platform and embankment of this road in the northern 76 kilometer stretch of this road, from Monte Grande to San Ignacio de Moxos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://enlace.comunicacion.gob.bo/index.php/2016/05/30/presidente-da-luz-verde-a-las-obras-de-ampliacion-de-la-carretera-san-ignacio-de-moxos-monte-grande/|title=Presidente da luz verde a las obras de ampliación de la carretera San Ignacio de Moxos – Monte Grande|last=Ministerio de Comunicación|first=|date=2016-05-30|work=ENLACE|access-date=2017-07-05|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction passed to the Social Engineering Directorate (''Dirección de Ingeniería Social'') of ADEMAF.

In July 2017, TIPNIS community members reported that construction is underway on two bridges for Segment II of the highway inside the park, and offered photographic evidence of it.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The newspaper ''El Deber'' confirmed that construction is underway at a bridge 6.7&amp;nbsp;km north of Insinuta and that construction firms Sergut and Incotec are working on the project under a contract with the Bolivian Highway Administration. Incotec's executive president told the paper that the contract has a confidentiality clause.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Minister of Public Works, Milton Claros, testified in September 2017 that these bridges are authorized by Supreme Decree 1146 (of February 24, 2012) and an Environment and Water Ministry resolution of February 4, 2014.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.la-razon.com/sociedad/TIPNIS-Fernando-Vargas-denuncia-construccion-puentes-avanza_0_2887511255.html|title=Fernando Vargas asegura que construcción de puentes en el TIPNIS no ha cesado|last=Ariñez|first=Rubén|date=2018-03-07|work=La Razón|accessdate=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (He had denied, the previous month, that there was any active highway project inside TIPNIS.&lt;ref name="Los Tiempos"/&gt;) According to Minister Claros,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; the three bridges are:

==Conflict concerning Isiboro-Sécure Indigenous Territory and National Park==
In May 2010, the a meeting of TIPNIS Subcentral and corregidores throughout the territory stated their "overwhelming and unrenounceable opposition" to the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Crespo Flores | first = Carlos | author2 = Tania Ricaldi | author3 = Teresa Hosse | author4 = Luis Rojas | author5 = Severo Villarroel | title = La carretera del TIPNIS vulnera la Constitución | work = Fundación Tierra | accessdate = 2011-10-03 | date = 2011-06-06 | url = http://www.ftierra.org/ft/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6272:rair&amp;catid=98:noticias&amp;Itemid=175 | quote = El XXIX Encuentro Extraordinario de Corregidores del Territorio Indígena y Parque Nacional Isiboro Sécure Autónomo de los Pueblos Indígenas Moxeño, Yuracaré y Chimán -18/V/2010, decidieron "Rechazar contundente e innegociablemente la construcción de la carretera Villa Tunari – San Ignacio de Moxos o todo trazo carretero que afecte nuestro territorio, nuestra casa grande" (punto 1 de la Resolución Nº 0001/2010). | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110828181914/http://www.ftierra.org/ft/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6272:rair&amp;catid=98:noticias&amp;Itemid=175 | archive-date = 2011-08-28 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, following the beginning of construction the Subcentral TIPNIS (the representative institution of indigenous residents in the territory), the [[Confederation of Indigenous Peoples of Bolivia]], and the highland indigenous confederation [[CONAMAQ]] announced they would participate in a national march opposing the project.

A major concern about the impact of the road is its contribution to [[deforestation]]: "Empirical evidence has shown that highways are motors for deforestation" concluded a study of the project by the Program for Strategic Investigation in Bolivia (PIEB).&lt;ref&gt;"La evidencia empírica ha mostrado que las carreteras son motores de deforestación" {{Cite web | last = PIEB | title = Investigación: Con o sin carretera, el TIPNIS está expuesto a la deforestación | accessdate = 2011-08-20 | date = 2011-07-18 | url = http://www.pieb.com.bo/sipieb_nota.php?idn=5541 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study projected that the road would markedly accelerate deforestation in the park, leaving up to 64% of TIPNIS deforested by 2030.&lt;ref name=PIEBDefo&gt;{{Cite web | last = PIEB | title = Investigación: Con o sin carretera, el TIPNIS está expuesto a la deforestación | accessdate = 2011-08-20 | date = 2011-07-18 | url = http://www.pieb.com.bo/sipieb_nota.php?idn=5963 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A technical report submitted by the Bolivian Highway Administration (ABC) established that the direct deforestation caused by the road itself would only be 0.03%;&lt;ref&gt;"Indígenas bolivianos persisten en rechazar construcción de vía que genera impacto forestal de 0,03 por ciento" {{Cite web | title = Indígenas bolivianos persisten en rechazar construcción de vía que genera impacto forestal de 0,03 por ciento | url = http://telesurtv.net/secciones/noticias/97335-NN/ind%C3%ADgenas%20bolivianos%20persisten%20en%20rechazar%20construcci%C3%B3n%20de%20v%C3%ADa%20que%20genera%20impacto%20forestal%20de%20003%20por%20ciento/ | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120523183755/http://telesurtv.net/secciones/noticias/97335-NN/ind%C3%ADgenas%20bolivianos%20persisten%20en%20rechazar%20construcci%C3%B3n%20de%20v%C3%ADa%20que%20genera%20impacto%20forestal%20de%20003%20por%20ciento/ | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, President Morales has spoken of a 180-hectare deforestation, an area equivalent to a rectangle 180&amp;nbsp;km long and 10 m wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Evo se queja del conflicto del Tipnis en la Cumbre Iberoamericana | work = Los Tiempos | accessdate = 2011-10-29 | date = 2011-10-29 | url = http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/economia/20111029/evo-se-queja-del-conflicto-del-tipnis-en-la-cumbre_147503_305193.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130128042331/http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/economia/20111029/evo-se-queja-del-conflicto-del-tipnis-en-la-cumbre_147503_305193.html | archivedate = 2013-01-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the last government survey 49 of 64 communities in TIPNIS are in favour of the construction of the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Gobierno envía séptima comisión de diálogo con marchistas y sugiere implementar consulta del Tipnis | url = http://www.cambio.bo/noticia.php?fecha=2011-09-13&amp;idn=54359 | quote = En la actualidad, 15 de 64 comunidades indígenas se mantienen movilizadas en contra de la carretera, luego de que ocho organizaciones abandonaron esa medida de presión, según dijo Romero el domingo. | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120329230759/http://www.cambio.bo/noticia.php?fecha=2011-09-13&amp;idn=54359 | archivedate = 2012-03-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Subcentral, the Confederation of Indigenous Peoples of Bolivia (CIDOB), and the highland indigenous confederation CONAMAQ carried out a national march from Trinidad, Beni to La Paz in opposition to the project, beginning on August 15, 2011. On September 25, a police raid on the march resulted in the detention of hundreds of marchers, who were later released. The march regrouped and arrived in La Paz on October 19 to a massive public welcome. During the march, other movements such as the Cochabamba campesino confederation and the ''colonos'' union in Yucumo mobilized in favor of the project. In early October, the [[Plurinational Legislative Assembly]] passed legislation authored by the MAS authorizing the road following a consultation process, but indigenous deputies and the indigenous movement opposed the bill. At the opening of negotiations with the protesters on October 21, Morales announced that he would veto the legislation and support the text proposed by the indigenous deputies. This text was passed by the Assembly and signed into law on October 24, effectively ending the conflict. Law 180 of 2011 declares TIPNIS an intangible zone and prohibits the construction of highways that cross it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = El Presidente promulga la ley corta del Tipnis | work = Los Tiempos | accessdate = 2011-10-29 | date = 2011-10-25 | url = http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/economia/20111025/el-presidente-promulga-la-ley-corta-del-tipnis_146889_303848.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111030002511/http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/economia/20111025/el-presidente-promulga-la-ley-corta-del-tipnis_146889_303848.html | archivedate = 2011-10-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Le conflit du Tipnis et la Bolivie d'Evo Morales face à ses contradictions  | work = Echogeo | accessdate = 2012-01-30 | date = 2012-01-26 | url = http://echogeo.revues.org/12972 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in December 2011, the Bolivian government rallied supporters of the highway, in Cochabamba, San Ignacio de Moxos, and the southernmost port of TIPNIS, in a campaign to reverse Law 180. Conisur, an organization of communities living in Polygon 7 at the south of TIPNIS, led its own pro-highway march from December 19 in the territory to January 2012 in La Paz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = MAS ejecutó 5 estrategias para conseguir construcción de carretera por el TIPNIS | work = Erbol Digital | date = 2012-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Conisur demand that Law 180 simply be annulled, the government proposed instead to conduct a "prior consultation" of TIPNIS indigenous communities on the question of the highway as well as Law 180's declaration of the highway as an intangible zone. This proposal was passed as Law 222 on February 10, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Ley de Consulta a los Pueblos Indígenas del Territorio Indígena y Parque Nacional Isiboro Sécure - TIPNIS - Ley 222 | work = Infoleyes | accessdate = 2014-01-16 | date = 2012-02-10 | url = http://bolivia.infoleyes.com/shownorm.php?id=3617 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-CONISUR TIPNIS communities and their traditional leaders rejected the proposed consultation declaring that it "is not free, but rather is being imposed by force; is not informed, insofar as there is manipulation of information concerning the reach and effects of this law, which are hidden by the state … and does not deal in good faith"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = TIPNIS Corregidors plan national march, local resistance | work = Carwil without Borders | accessdate = 2014-01-16 | url = http://woborders.wordpress.com/2012/03/22/tipnis-corregidors-plan/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Subcentral TIPNIS and CIDOB organized a new 62-day march opposing the consultation which reached La Paz in June, but their demands were not attended to by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Chávez | first = Frank | title = BOLIVIA: From Police Mutiny to Indigenous Vigil | work = Inter Press Service | accessdate = 2014-01-16 | url = http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/06/bolivia-from-police-mutiny-to-indigenous-vigil/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Plurinational Electoral Organ]] took on the task of carrying out the community consultation, visiting communities in the territory from July 29 through December 3, 2012. According to the official count, 58 communities of the 69 within TIPNIS participated and 55 of them supported the road, while 57 rejected the "intangibility" of the territory imposed by Law 180.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Vargas Lima | first = Alan E. | title = El "informe final" sobre la Consulta Previa en el Tipnis | work = La Razón | accessdate = 2014-01-16 | date = 2013-04-23 | url = http://www.la-razon.com/suplementos/la_gaceta_juridica/informe-final-Consulta-Previa-Tipnis_0_1819618146.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a human rights observation mission led by the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights of Bolivia (APDHB), the Inter-American Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), and the Catholic Church from November 29 to December 14 reached a different conclusion. They found that "of the 36 communities visited by FIDH and APDHB, only 19 stated having been consulted, and 30 communities rejected construction of the road." The observers also described "numerous irregularities in the consultation process" and denounced that "the communities consulted reported having received gifts, having been pressured or being imposed restrictions in exchange for acceptance of the consultation; some were coerced through the suspension of development projects in case of refusal."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = FIDH and APDHB call for the respect of the right of the TIPNIS indigenous communities to a prior, free, informed, concerted and good faith consultation | work = FIDH | accessdate = 2014-01-16 | date = 2013-07-16 | url = http://www.fidh.org/en/americas/bolivia/fidh-and-apdhb-call-for-the-respect-of-the-right-of-the-tipnis-indigenous-13238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coinciding the publication of the consultation's results in April 2013, three laws were envisioned to address the future of the territory and the road project: one annulling Law 180, a second instituting environmental safeguards, and a third preventing further occupation of the territory by coca growers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Asamblea Legislativa debatirá 3 leyes para el Tipnis | work = Los Tiempos | location = Cochabamba, Bolivia | accessdate = 2014-01-16 | date = 2013-04-01 | url = http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/nacional/20130401/asamblea-legislativa-debatira-3-leyes-para-el_207717_445296.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, legislative leaders and Minister of Public Works Vladimir Sánchez announced that the government would prioritize eliminating extreme poverty in TIPNIS through the end of 2014, and defer any action on the highway project and the suggested laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = La Asamblea no tratará aún leyes para el TIPNIS | work = La Razón | accessdate = 2014-01-16 | date = 2013-04-11 | url = http://www.la-razon.com/nacional/Asamblea-tratara-leyes-TIPNIS_0_1813018726.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Ferrier, the governor of Beni after the 2015 elections, has pledged to advance the project.

In May 2015, Conisur announced that it held a gathering of pro-road communities who called for Segment II to be built. Later that month, Emilio Noza of the Subcentral Isiboro Sécure-Tipnis and Fernando Vargas president of the Subcentral Tipnis declared that their member communities continue to oppose the road and stating that a Subcentral Tipnis representative had confirmed that no such gathering had been held, as claimed, in Santa Trinidad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = | first = | title = Denuncian que es falsa la reunión del Conisur que pide vía por el Tipnis| work = La Prensa| accessdate = 2016-06-03| date = 2016-05-31| url = http://www.laprensa.com.bo/diario/actualidad/economia/20160531/denuncian-que-es-falsa-la-reunion-del-conisur-que-pide-via-por-el_78132_136044.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the governing MAS party introduced legislation to repeal the intangibility protections of Law 180 and to authorize the drafting of a transportation plan. This law, the Law for the Protection, Integral and Sustainable Development of TIPNIS ({{Lang-es|Ley de Protección, Desarrollo Integral y Sustentable del Territorio Indígena Parque Nacional Isiboro Sécure (TIPNIS)}}), was enacted as Law 266 on August 13, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.paginasiete.bo/nacional/2017/8/13/morales-promulga-anula-intangibilidad-tipnis-148183.html|title=Morales promulga la ley que anula la intangibilidad del TIPNIS|date=2017-08-13|work=Página Siete|accessdate=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
