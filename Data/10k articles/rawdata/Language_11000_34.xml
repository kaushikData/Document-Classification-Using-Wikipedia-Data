'''Achomi''' (''Ajami'' or ''Achami'') ([[Larestani]]: {{lang|lrl|اَچُمی}}), also known as '''Ajami''', '''Lari''' or '''Larestani''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: {{lang|fa|لارستانی}}),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5G0GDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10|title=Governance in Immigrant Family Businesses: Enterprise, Ethnicity and Family Dynamics|last=Halkias|first=Daphne|last2=Adendorff|first2=Christian|date=2016-04-22|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781317125952|location=|pages=10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]] spoken in the south of [[Iran]], mostly in [[Fars Province]] by Achomi people, a [[Shia]] and [[Sunni]] [[Persians|Persian]] ethnic group&lt;ref name="lari"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/12996/IR|title=Larestani, Lari in Iran}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalprayerdigest.org/index.php/issue/day/Larestani-people-of-Iran/|title=Larestani people of Iran|quote=The Larestani people are predominantly Sunni Muslims.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalprayerdigest.org/index.php/issue/day/Larestani-People/|title=Larestani|quote=While most people in Iran are Shi’ite Muslims, the Larestani are Sunnis.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zHxsWspxGIIC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=laristan+sunni+fars&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IFieUsa9NMqM7Aa-pYDoBQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6wEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=laristan%20sunni%20fars&amp;f=false|title=Islamic Desk Reference|work= E. J. Van Donzel|pages=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities that speak this dialect include [[Lar, Iran|Lar]], [[Juyom]], [[Evaz]], [[Gerash]], [[Khonj]], [[Bastak]], [[Khur, Fars|Khour]], [[Kowreh, Fars|Kowreh]], [[Fedagh]], along with many others. Achomi is close to standard new [[Persian language|Persian]] in most aspects and is a dialect of Persian &lt;ref&gt; Khaghaninejad, M. S. The Corpus-based Survey of Sociolinguistic Issues in Iran.&lt;/ref&gt; with a grammar distinct from Persian. The language is mainly spoken by the [[Achomi people]], but also by some [[Huwala]]. The majority of Achomi people are Sunni Muslims.

== In Eastern Arabia (Arab states of the Persian Gulf) ==
Iranian people who have migrated from southern Iran to the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] at the early 20th century still speak this language in their homes, however, this variety has been somewhat influenced by the [[Arabic|Arabic language]].

== Etymology ==

Speakers of Achomi dialects in Iran that come from different towns might also find some variations in some words and may differ slightly in grammar and particularly in accent. Hence, if the speaker is from [[Evaz]], they are referred as speaking Evazi, and if they are from Bastak their dialect is known as Bastaki.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Accents and variations of Achomi ==
Since the Achomi region is widespread, there are different Achomi accents and some slight differences in grammar. For example, in some places people say ''raftom'' for "I went" (very similar to the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''raftam''), but in some other places like Lar people say ''chedem'' instead (Kurdish: ''dichim'' or ''dechim)''.

=== Examples of Achomi (Lari accent) ===
==== Verbs ====
===== Passive =====
To create a passive verb in past tense we can use the verb root plus its proper prefix. For example, in Achomi (Lari), the root for the verb "to tell" is ''got'' (''gota'' equals "tell").

omgot (om+got), Kurdish (migot or min got) = I told ...

otgot (om+got), Kurdish (tugot or tegot) = You told...

oshgot (osh+got), Kurdish (wigot) = He told...

mogot (mo+got), Kurdish (megot) = We told...

togot (to+got), Kurdish pl (wegot) = You(pl) told

shogot (sho+got), Kurdish (wa-n got) = They told

Another example: "deda" means "see," and "dee" Kurdish (Deed or dee) is the root verb. So:

omdee = I saw, Kurdish (mideed, midee, min deed, min dee) 

otdee= you saw, Kurdish (tu-te dee)....

To create a simple present or continued present tense of a passive verb, here's another example:

agota'em (a+got+aem):I am telling...

agota'esh (a+got+aesh): You are telling...

agotay (a+got+ay): He is telling...

agota'am (a+got+a'am): We are telling...

agotay (a+got+ay): You(pl) are telling...

agota'en (a+got+a'en): They are telling...

For the verb "see" ("deda"):

adead'em, adeda'esh, adeaday,...

He left Nigeria for Sweden in 1990 due to political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.7x7.com/arts/poetry-motion-sf-international-poetry-festival&lt;/ref&gt; He already spoke three languages ([[Ibo language|Ibo]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]] and English) and embraced the new opportunity to learn another language by reading modern classical Swedish writers such as [[Pär Lagerkvist]] and [[Harry Martinson]]. After about 5 – 6 years in Sweden he found an urge to write [[poetry]], in Swedish. He says he finds it hard to write in English, the language of the former colonial power. He never learned to write in the Ibo or Hausa languages.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svd.se/kulturnoje/nyheter/cletus-hittade-hem-i-poesin_1416327.svd&lt;/ref&gt; His main themes are love, death and [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heidruns.se/200/201.asp?id=2125&lt;/ref&gt;
He published his first poetry collection in 1998, ''En kort svart dikt'' (A Short Black Poem) and has since then published five more books. Nwadike has also contributed to [[periodicals]] and [[anthologies]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svd.se/kulturnoje/nyheter/cletus-hittade-hem-i-poesin_1416327.svd&lt;/ref&gt;

He has performed at various conventions and the rock festival [[Hultsfredsfestivalen]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svd.se/kulturnoje/nyheter/cletus-hittade-hem-i-poesin_1416327.svd&lt;/ref&gt; Nwadike as also been featured in the [[Sveriges Radio|national radio]] program "Vid dagens slut".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heidruns.se/200/201.asp?id=2125&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
After many years in the city of [[Malmö]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svd.se/kulturnoje/nyheter/cletus-hittade-hem-i-poesin_1416327.svd&lt;/ref&gt; he now resides in [[Aneby]], rural [[Småland]] with his wife and children.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svd.se/kulturnoje/litteratur/afrikanska-tankar-fran-smaland_5903305.svd&lt;/ref&gt; He works at an after school center (Fritidspedagog) and has a Swedish [[university]] degree from Högskolan in [[Jönköping]] in creative writing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.immi.se/kultur/authors/afrikaner/nwadike.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Common sense''' is sound practical judgment concerning everyday matters, or a basic ability to [[Perception|perceive]], [[Nous|understand]], and [[Phronesis|judge]] that is shared by ("common to") nearly all people.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' gives: "sound and prudent judgment based on a simple perception of the situation or facts." [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/common+sense], Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary. The [[Cambridge Dictionary]] defines it as, "the basic level of practical knowledge and judgment that we all need to help us live in a reasonable and safe way."[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/common-sense], Cambridge Dictionaries Online. {{harvtxt|van Holthoorn|Olson|1987|page=9}} say that "common sense consists of knowledge, judgement, and taste which is more or less universal and which is held more or less without reflection or argument." C.S. {{harvtxt|Lewis|1967|page=146}} wrote that what common sense "often means" is "the elementary mental outfit of the normal man."&lt;/ref&gt; The first type of common sense, good sense, can be described as "the knack for seeing things as they are, and doing things as they ought to be done." The second type is sometimes described as [[folk wisdom]], "signifying unreflective knowledge not reliant on specialized training or deliberative thought." The two types are intertwined, as the person who has common sense is in touch with common-sense ideas, which emerge from the lived experiences of those commonsensical enough to perceive them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Emotional Common Sense as Constitutional Law|volume=62|pages=851|date=2009|journal=Vanderbilt Law Review|author=Maroney, Terry A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a psychology context, Smedslund defines common sense as "the system of implications shared by the competent users of a language" and notes, "A proposition in a given context belongs to common sense if and only if all competent users of the language involved agree that the proposition in the given context is true and that its negation is false."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smedslund, Jan|title=Common sense as psychosocial reality: A reply to Sjöberg|journal=Scandinavian journal of psychology|date=September 1982|volume=23|issue=1|pages=79-82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The everyday understanding of common sense derives from historical philosophical discussion involving several European languages. Related terms in other languages include Latin '''{{lang|la|sensus communis}}''', Greek {{lang|grc|αἴσθησις κοινὴ}} ('''{{transl|grc|aísthēsis koinḕ}}'''), and French '''{{lang|fr|bon sens}}''', but these are not straightforward translations in all contexts. Similarly in English, there are different shades of meaning, implying more or less education and wisdom: "good sense" is sometimes seen as equivalent to "common sense", and sometimes not.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Thomas Reid]] contrasted common sense and good sense to some extent. See {{harvtxt|Wierzbicka|2010|page=340}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|right|Aristotle, the first person known to have discussed "common sense", described it as the ability with which animals (including humans) process sense-perceptions, memories and imagination ({{lang|grc|φρονεῖν}}, {{transl|grc|phroneîn}}) in order to reach many types of basic judgments. In his scheme, only humans have real reasoned thinking ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:νοεῖν#Ancient Greek|νοεῖν]]}}, {{transl|grc|noeîn}}), which takes them beyond their common sense.]]
"Common sense" also has at least two specifically philosophical meanings. One is a capability of the animal soul ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:ψυχή#Ancient Greek|ψῡχή]]}}, {{transl|grc|psūkhḗ}}) proposed by [[Aristotle]], which enables different individual senses to collectively perceive the characteristics of physical things such as movement and size, which all physical things have in different combinations, allowing people and other animals to distinguish and identify physical things. This common sense is distinct from basic sensory perception and from human rational thinking, but cooperates with both.

The second special use of the term is Roman-influenced and is used for the natural human sensitivity for other humans and the community.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]'' of 1973 gives 4 meanings of "common sense": (1) An archaic meaning is "An internal sense which was regarded as the common bond or centre of the five senses"; (2) "Ordinary, normal, or average understanding" without which a man would be "foolish or insane" (3) "The general sense of mankind, or of a community" (two sub-meanings of this are good sound practical sense and general sagacity) (4) A philosophical meaning, the "faculty of primary truths".&lt;/ref&gt; Just like the everyday meaning, both of these refer to a type of basic awareness and ability to judge that most people are expected to share naturally, even if they cannot explain why.

All these meanings of "common sense", including the everyday ones, are interconnected in a complex history and have evolved during important political and philosophical debates in modern [[Western civilisation]], notably concerning [[science]], politics and [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;See the body of this article concerning (for example) Descartes, Hobbes, Adam Smith, and so on. [[Thomas Paine]]'s pamphlet named ''"[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]"'' was an influential publishing success during the period leading up to the [[American revolution]].&lt;/ref&gt; The interplay between the meanings has come to be particularly notable in English, as opposed to other western European languages, and the English term has become international.&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{Harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011|page=282}}; {{harvtxt|Wierzbicka|2010}}; and {{harvtxt|van Kessel|1987|page=117}}: "today the Anglo-Saxon concept prevails almost everywhere".&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Age of Enlightenment]] the term "common sense" has frequently been used for [[rhetoric]]al effect, sometimes pejorative, and sometimes appealed to positively, [[Argument from authority|as an authority]]. It can be negatively equated to [[wikt:vulgar|vulgar]] [[prejudice]] and [[superstition]], or on the contrary it is often positively contrasted to them as a standard for [[good taste]] and as the source of the most basic [[axiom]]s needed for science and logic.&lt;ref name="hund"&gt;{{harvtxt|Hundert|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at the beginning of the eighteenth century that this old philosophical term first acquired its modern English meaning: "Those plain, self-evident truths or conventional wisdom that one needed no sophistication to grasp and no proof to  accept  precisely  because  they  accorded  so  well  with  the  basic  (common sense) intellectual capacities and experiences of the whole social body" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Sophia|title=Common sense : a political history.|date=2014|publisher=Harvard Univ Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=9780674284166|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This began with [[René Descartes|Descartes]]' criticism of it, and what came to be known as the dispute between "[[rationalism]]" and "[[empiricism]]". In the opening line of one of his most famous books, ''[[Discourse on Method]]'', Descartes established the most common modern meaning, and its controversies, when he stated that everyone has a similar and sufficient amount of common sense ({{lang|fr|bon sens}}), but it is rarely used well. Therefore, a skeptical logical method described by Descartes needs to be followed and common sense should not be overly relied upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Descartes|1901}} Part I of the ''Discourse on Method''. NOTE: The term in French is "{{lang|fr|bon sens}}" sometimes translated as "good sense". The opening lines in English translation read: {{Quote|"Good Sense is, of all things among men, the most equally distributed; for every one thinks himself so abundantly provided with it, that those even who are the most difficult to satisfy in everything else, do not usually desire a larger measure of this quality than they already possess. And in this it is not likely that all are mistaken: the conviction is rather to be held as testifying that the power of judging aright and of distinguishing [[Truth]] from [[Error]], which is properly what is called [[Good Sense]] or [[Reason]], is by nature equal in all men; and that the diversity of our opinions, consequently, does not arise from some being endowed with a larger share of Reason than others, but solely from this, that we conduct our thoughts along different ways, and do not fix our attention on the same objects. For to be possessed of a vigorous mind is not enough; the prime requisite is rightly to apply it. The greatest minds, as they are capable of the highest excellencies, are open likewise to the greatest aberrations; and those who travel very slowly may yet make far greater progress, provided they keep always to the straight road, than those who, while they run, forsake it."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing 18th century [[Enlightenment era|Enlightenment]], common sense came to be seen more positively as the basis for modern thinking. It was contrasted to [[metaphysics]], which was, like [[Cartesianism]], associated with the {{lang|fr|[[Ancien Régime]]}}. [[Thomas Paine]]'s polemical pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' (1776) has been described as the most influential political pamphlet of the 18th century, affecting both the [[American revolution|American]] and [[French revolution]]s.&lt;ref name="hund" /&gt; Today, the concept of common sense, and how it should best be used, remains linked to many of the most perennial topics in [[epistemology]] and [[ethics]], with special focus often directed at the philosophy of the modern [[social sciences]].

==Aristotelian==
The origin of the term is in the works of [[Aristotle]]. The best-known case is ''[[De Anima]]'' [http://www.mikrosapoplous.gr/aristotle/psyxhs/3_01.html Book III, chapter 1], especially at line 425a27.&lt;ref&gt;There are other places in the works of Aristotle uses the same two words together: ''[[De memoria et reminiscentia]]'' 1450a, ''[[De Partibus Animalium]]'' IV.10 686a, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' I.1 981b, ''[[Historia Animalium]]'' I.3 489a. See {{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage is about how the animal mind converts raw sense perceptions from the [[Five wits|five specialized]] [[sense perception]]s, into perceptions of real things moving and changing, which can be thought about. According to Aristotle's understanding of perception, each of the five senses perceives one type of "perceptible" or "sensible" which is specific ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἴδιος#Ancient Greek|ἴδια]]}}, {{transl|grc|idia}}) to it. For example, sight can see colour. But Aristotle was explaining how the animal mind, not just the human mind, links and categorizes different tastes, colours, feelings, smells and sounds in order to perceive real things in terms of the "common sensibles" (or "common perceptibles"). In this discussion, "common" ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:κοινός#Ancient Greek|κοινή]]}}, {{transl|grc|koiné}}) is a term opposed to specific or particular ({{transl|grc|idia}}). The Greek for these common sensibles is {{transl|grc|tá koiná}} ({{lang|grc|τά κοινᾰ́}}, {{literal translation|'that which is common to many'|lk=on}}), which means shared or common things, and examples include the oneness of each thing, with its specific shape and size and so on, and the change or movement of each thing.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle lists change, shape, magnitude, number and unity, but he notes that we perceive shape, magnitude, and the rest by first being able to perceive change or movement (Greek uses one word for both: {{lang|grc|[[wikt:κίνησις#Ancient Greek|κῑ́νησῐς]]}}, {{transl|grc|kī́nēsis}}), and number is perceived by perceiving a lack of unity. (''De Anima'' 425a16, just before the famous mention of "common sense".) As {{harvtxt|Lee|2011}} explains, Aristotle is talking about what [[Robert Boyle]] and [[John Locke]] referred to as "[[primary qualities]]" (not to be confused with Aristotle's use of the term "primary qualities"). Plato is not so clear. In the equivalent passage in Plato's ''Theaetetus'' 185c–d, he talks about what is common in all things, and in specific things, and by which we say that things for example "are" versus "are not"; are "similar" versus "dissimilar"; are the "same" versus being "different"; being one or a higher number; odd or even.&lt;/ref&gt; Distinct combinations of these properties are common to all perceived things.&lt;ref&gt;These "common sensibles" or {{transl|grc|koiná}} are in other words one Platonic-Aristotelian version of what are today called "[[universals]]", although it should be noted that Aristotle distinguishes the {{transl|grc|koiná}} perceived by common sense, from the [[Theory of forms|forms]] or ideas seen by the {{transl|grc|[[Nous|noûs]]}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:νοῦς#Ancient Greek|νοῦς]]}}). See for example {{citation|title=A Companion to Aristotle
|editor-first= Georgios |editor-last=Anagnostopoulos |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4nlfBVrDmlgC&amp;pg=PT215|isbn= 9781118610633 |date= 2013-03-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this passage, Aristotle explained that concerning these {{transl|grc|koiná}} (such as movement) we already have a sense, a "common sense" or sense of the common things ({{transl|grc|aísthēsis koinḕ}}), which does not work by [[accident (philosophy)|accident]] ({{lang|grc|κᾰτᾰ́ σῠμβεβηκός}}, {{transl|grc|katá sumbebēkós}}). And there is no specific ({{transl|grc|idéā}}) sense perception for movement and other {{transl|grc|koiná}}, because then we would not perceive the {{transl|grc|koiná}} at all, except by accident. As examples of perceiving by accident Aristotle mentions using the specific sense perception vision on its own to see that something is sweet, or to recognize a friend by their distinctive color. {{harvtxt|Lee|2011|page=31}} explains that "when I see Socrates, it is not insofar as he is Socrates that he is visible to my eye, but rather because he is coloured". So the normal five individual senses do sense the common perceptibles according to Aristotle (and Plato), but it is not something they necessarily interpret correctly on their own. Aristotle proposes that the reason for having several senses is in fact that it increases the chances that we can distinguish and recognize things correctly, and not just occasionally or by accident.&lt;ref&gt;''De Anima'' line 425a47, just after the famous mention of "common sense".&lt;/ref&gt; Each sense is used to identify distinctions, such as sight identifying the difference between black and white, but, says Aristotle, all animals with perception must have "some one thing" that can distinguish black from sweet.&lt;ref&gt;''De Anima'' column 427a. Plato, in his ''Theaetatus'' 185a–c uses the question of how to judge if sound or colour are salty.&lt;/ref&gt; The common sense is where this comparison happens, and this must occur by comparing impressions (or symbols or markers; {{lang|grc|[[wikt:σημεῖον#Ancient Greek|σημεῖον]]}}, {{transl|grc|sēmeîon}}, {{literal translation|'sign, mark'|lk=on}}) of what the specialist senses have perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sachs|2011|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common sense is therefore also where a type of [[consciousness]] originates, "for it makes us aware of having sensations at all". And it receives physical picture imprints from the imaginative faculty, which are then memories that can be recollected.&lt;ref name="brann43" /&gt;

The discussion was apparently intended to improve upon the account of Aristotle's friend and teacher [[Plato]] in his [[Socratic dialogue]], the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Approximately [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Theaet.+185a&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171 185a]–[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171%3Atext%3DTheaet.%3Asection%3D187a 187a].&lt;/ref&gt; But Plato's dialogue presented an argument that recognizing {{transl|grc|koiná}} is an active thinking process in the rational part of the human soul, making the senses instruments of the thinking part of man. Plato's Socrates says this kind of thinking is not a kind of sense at all. Aristotle, trying to give a more general account of the souls of all animals, not just humans, moved the act of perception out of the rational thinking soul into this {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, which is something like a sense, and something like thinking, but not rational.&lt;ref name="greg"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Avicenna-miniatur.jpg|thumb|right|Avicenna became one of the greatest medieval authorities concerning Aristotelian common sense, both in Islamic and Christian lands.]]

The passage is difficult to interpret and there is little consensus about many of the details.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007}}, Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|pages=204–205}} has argued that this may be because Aristotle did not use the term as a standardized technical term at all. For example, in some passages in his works, Aristotle seems to use the term to refer to the individual sense perceptions simply being common to all people, or common to various types of animals. There is also difficulty with trying to determine whether the common sense is truly separable from the individual sense perceptions and from imagination, in anything other than a conceptual way as a capability. Aristotle never fully spells out the relationship between the common sense and the [[imagination|imaginative faculty]] ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:φαντασία#Ancient Greek|φᾰντᾰσῐ́ᾱ]]}}, {{transl|grc|phantasíā}}), although the two clearly work together in animals, and not only humans, for example in order to enable a perception of time. They may even be the same.&lt;ref name="brann43"&gt;{{harvtxt|Brann|1991|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greg" /&gt; Despite hints by Aristotle himself that they were united, early commentators such as [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] and [[Al-Farabi]] felt they were distinct, but later, [[Avicenna]] emphasized the link, influencing future authors including Christian philosophers.&lt;ref name="hr42" /&gt;&lt;ref name="walz"&gt;{{citation|title=Al-Farabi on the Perfect State|first=Richard |last=Walzer| isbn=1871031761|year=1998|page=389}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=205}} argues that Aristotle used the term "common sense" both to discuss the individual senses when these act as a unity, which Gregorić calls "the perceptual capacity of the soul", or the higher level "sensory capacity of the soul" that represents the senses and the imagination working as a unity. According to Gregorić, there appears to have been a standardization of the term {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}} as a term for the perceptual capacity (not the higher level sensory capacity), which occurred by the time of Alexander of Aphrodisias at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to Plato, Aristotle's understanding of the soul ({{transl|grc|psūkhḗ}}) has an extra level of complexity in the form of the {{transl|grc|[[Nous|noûs]]}} or "intellect"—which is something only humans have and enables humans to perceive things differently from other animals. It works with images coming from the common sense and imagination, using [[reason]]ing ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:λόγος#Ancient Greek|λόγος]]}}, {{transl|grc|[[Logos|lógos]]}}) as well as the ''[[active intellect]]''. The {{transl|grc|noûs}} identifies the true [[Formal cause|forms of things]], while the common sense identifies shared aspects of things. Though scholars have varying interpretations of the details, Aristotle's "common sense" was in any case not rational, in the sense that it implied no ability to explain the perception. [[Reason]] or [[rationality]] ({{transl|grc|lógos}}) exists only in man according to Aristotle, and yet some animals can perceive "common perceptibles" such as change and shape, and some even have imagination according to Aristotle. Animals with imagination come closest to having something like reasoning and {{transl|grc|noûs}}.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' II.19.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato, on the other hand was apparently willing to allow that animals could have some level of thought, meaning that he did not have to explain their sometimes complex behavior with a strict division between high-level perception processing and the human-like thinking such as being able to form opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|pages=5–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gregorić additionally argues that Aristotle can be interpreted as using the verbs {{transl|grc|phroneîn}} and {{transl|grc|noeîn}} to distinguish two types of thinking or awareness, the first being found in animals and the second unique to humans and involving reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gregorić|2007}}, Part II, chapter 3, which concerns a passage in ''[[De Partibus Animalium]]'' IV, but also refers to other passages in the corpus. See footnote 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in Aristotle (and the medieval Aristotelians) the universals used to identify and categorize things are divided into two. In medieval terminology these are the {{lang|la|species sensibilis}} used for perception and imagination in animals, and the {{lang|la|species intelligibilis}} or apprehendable forms used in the human intellect or {{transl|grc|noûs}}.

Aristotle also occasionally called the {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}} (or one version of it) the {{transl|grc|prôton aisthētikón}} ({{lang|grc|πρῶτον αἰσθητῐκόν}}, {{literal translation|'first of the senses'|lk=no}}). (According to Gregorić, this is specifically in contexts where it refers to the higher order common sense that includes imagination.) Later philosophers developing this line of thought, such as [[Themistius]], [[Galen]], and [[Al-Farabi]], called it the {{em|ruler}} of the senses or {{em|ruling}} sense, apparently a metaphor developed from a section of Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (70b).&lt;ref name="walz" /&gt; [[Augustine]] and some of the Arab writers, also called it the "inner sense".&lt;ref name="hr42" /&gt; The concept of the inner senses, plural, was further developed in the [[Middle Ages]]. Under the influence of the great Persian philosophers [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]], several inner senses came to be listed. "Thomas Aquinas and [[John of Jandun]] recognized four internal senses: the common sense, [[imagination]], {{lang|la|vis cogitativa}}, and memory. Avicenna, followed by [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Albert the Great]], and [[Roger Bacon]], argued for five internal senses: the common sense, imagination, fantasy, {{lang|la|vis aestimativa}}, and memory."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=10}}. The "cogitative" or "estimative" capacity, {{lang|la|vis aestimativa}}, "enables the animal to extract vital information about its environment from the form processed by the common sense and imagination."&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of [[Descartes]] and [[Hobbes]], in the 1600s, the inner senses had been standardized to ''[[five wits]]'', which complemented the more well-known five "external" senses.&lt;ref name="hr42"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this medieval scheme the common sense was understood to be seated not in the heart, as Aristotle had thought, but in the anterior [[Galen]]ic [[Ventricular system|ventricle]] of the brain. The great anatomist [[Andreas Vesalius]] however found no connections between the anterior ventricle and the sensory nerves, leading to speculation about other parts of the brain into the 1600s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=11}}. See below concerning Descartes.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008}} writes that "In different ways the philosophers of medieval Latin and Arabic tradition, from Al-Farabi to Avicenna, [[Averroës]], [[Albertus Magnus|Albert]], and [[Thomas of Aquinas|Thomas]], found in the ''De Anima'' and the ''[[Parva Naturalia]]'' the scattered elements of a coherent doctrine of the "central" faculty of the sensuous soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "one of the most successful and resilient of Aristotelian notions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman==
[[File:Marcus Aurelius statue.01.JPG|right|thumb|Marcus Aurelius, emperor and Stoic philosopher, and an important influence upon the concept of "humanist" common sense.]]
"{{lang|la|Sensus communis}}" is the Latin translation of the Greek {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}}, which came to be recovered by Medieval [[scholastics]] when discussing Aristotelian theories of perception. However, in earlier Latin during the Roman empire the term had taken a distinct ethical detour, developing new shades of meaning. These especially Roman meanings were apparently influenced by several Stoic Greek terms with the word {{transl|grc|koinḗ}} ({{lang|grc|κοινή}}, {{literal translation|'common, shared'}}); not only {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}}, but also such terms as {{transl|grc|koinós noûs}} ({{lang|grc|κοινός νοῦς}}, {{literal translation|'common mind/thought/reason'|lk=no}}) {{transl|grc|koinḗ énnoia}} ({{lang|grc|κοινή ἔννοιᾰ}}), and {{transl|grc|koinonoēmosúnē}}, all of which involve {{transl|grc|noûs}}—something, at least in Aristotle, that would not be present in "lower" animals.&lt;ref name="Bugter1987"&gt;{{harvtxt|Bugter|1987|page=84}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{transl|grc|Koinḗ énnoia}} is a term from [[Stoic philosophy]], a Greek philosophy, influenced by Aristotle, and influential in [[Rome]]. This refers to shared notions, or common conceptions, that are either in-born or imprinted by the senses on to the soul. Unfortunately few true Stoic texts survive, and our understanding of their technical terminology is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Prolepsis and Ennoia in the Early Stoa|first= Henry |last=Dyson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1AXMNpIgJ4C| year=2009| publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn= 9783110212297 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{transl|grc|Koinós noûs}} is a term found in [[Epictetus]] (III.vi.8), a Stoic philosopher. C.S. {{harvtxt|Lewis|1967|page=146}} believed this to be close to a modern English meaning of "common sense", "the elementary mental outfit of the normal man", something like [[intelligence]]. He noted that {{lang|la|sensus}} could be a translation of {{transl|grc|noûs}}, (for example in the [[Vulgate Bible]]), but he only found one clear case of a Latin text showing this apparent meaning, a text by [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus the fable writer]].
* {{transl|grc|Koinonoēmosúnē}} is found only in the work of the emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] (''[[Meditations]]'' I.16), also known as a Stoic. (He uses the word on its own in a list of things he learned from his adopted father.) Shaftesbury and others felt it represented the Stoic Greek original, which gave the special Roman meaning of {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, especially when used to refer to someone's public spirit. Shaftesbury explained the change of meaning as being due to the specific way that Stoics understood perception and intellect, saying that one should "consider withal how small the distinction was in that Philosophy, between the {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ὑπόληψις|ὑπόληψις]]}} [conjecture], and the vulgar {{lang|grc|[[wikt:αἴσθησις|αἴσθησις]]}} [perception]; how generally Passion was by those Philosophers brought under the Head of Opinion".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Shaftesbury|2001}}, volume I, part III, section I, first footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another link between Latin {{lang|la|communis sensus}} and Aristotle's Greek was in [[rhetoric]], a subject that Aristotle was the first to systematize. In rhetoric, a prudent speaker must take account of opinions ({{lang|grc|δόξαι}}, {{transl|grc|[[Doxa|dóxai]]}}) that are widely held.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] saw Aristotle's rhetorical work as having formed a continuity with his ethical and political work, all sharing a focus upon {{transl|grc|[[Phronesis|phrónēsis]]}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:φρόνησις#Ancient Greek|φρόνησῐς]]}}, {{literal translation|'practical wisdom'|lk=no}}), and a connection to what Vico saw in the concept of common sense. See {{citation|title=Gadamer's Hermeneutics and the Art of Conversation| editor-first=Andrzej |editor-last=Wierciński| first=John|last=Arthos| chapter=Gadamer's dialogical imperative: Linking Socratic dialogue to Aristotle's ''PHRONESIS''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4lE268UbRQsC| isbn=9783643111722 | year=2011 }} and {{harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=113}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle referred to such commonly held beliefs not as {{transl|grc|koinaí dóxai}} ({{lang|grc|κοιναί δόξαι}}, {{literal translation|'common opinions'|lk=no}}), which is a term he used for self-evident logical axioms, but with other terms such as {{transl|grc|[[Endoxa|éndóxa]]}} ({{lang|grc|ἔνδόξα}}).

In his ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'' for example Aristotle mentions "{{transl|grc|koinōn&amp;nbsp;[...] tàs písteis}}" or "common beliefs", saying that "our proofs and arguments must rest on generally accepted principles, [...] when speaking of converse with the multitude".&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|grc|ἀνάγκη διὰ τῶν κοινῶν ποιεῖσθαι τὰς πίστεις καὶ τοὺς λόγους}} [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0059%3Abekker+page%3D1355a ''Rhetoric'' 1355a]&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar passage in his own work on rhetoric, ''[[De Oratore]]'', [[Cicero]] wrote that "in oratory the very cardinal sin is to depart from the language of everyday life and the usage approved by the sense of the community". The sense of the community is in this case one translation of "{{lang|la|communis sensus}}" in the Latin of Cicero.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bugter|1987|page=90}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0120:book=1:section=12&amp;highlight=communis%2Csensus ''De Oratore'', I, 3, 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the Latin writers such as [[Cicero]] deliberately used this Aristotelian term in a new more peculiarly Roman way, probably also influenced by Greek Stoicism, therefore remains a subject of discussion. {{harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=112}} has proposed for example that the [[Roman republic]] maintained a very "oral" culture whereas in Aristotle's time rhetoric had come under heavy criticism from philosophers such as Socrates. {{harvtxt|Peters Agnew|2008}} argues, in agreement with [[Shaftesbury]] in the 18th century, that the concept developed from the Stoic concept of ethical virtue, influenced by Aristotle, but emphasizing the role of both the individual perception, and shared communal understanding. But in any case a complex of ideas attached itself to the term, to be almost forgotten in the Middle Ages, and eventually returning into ethical discussion in 18th-century Europe, after Descartes.

As with other meanings of common sense, for the Romans of the classical era "it designates a sensibility shared by all, from which one may deduce a number of fundamental judgments, that need not, or cannot, be questioned by rational reflection".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But even though Cicero did at least once use the term in a manuscript on Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (concerning a primordial "sense, one and common for all [...] connected with nature"), he and other Roman authors did not normally use it as a technical term limited to discussion about sense perception, as Aristotle apparently had in ''De Anima'', and as the Scholastics later would in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bugter|1987|pages=91–92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of referring to all animal judgment, it was used to describe pre-rational, widely shared human beliefs, and therefore it was a near equivalent to the concept of {{lang|la|[[humanitas]]}}. This was a term that could be used by Romans to imply not only [[human nature]], but also humane conduct, good breeding, refined manners, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bugter|1987|page=93}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Cicero, [[Quintilian]], [[Lucretius]], [[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]], [[Horace]] and some of the most influential Roman authors influenced by Aristotle's rhetoric and philosophy used the Latin term "{{lang|la|sensus communis}}" in a range of such ways.&lt;ref name=rethink&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[C. S. Lewis]] wrote:
{{Quote|Quintilian says it is better to send a boy to school than to have a private tutor for him at home; for if he is kept away from the herd ({{lang|la|congressus}}) how will he ever learn that {{lang|la|sensus}} which we call {{lang|la|communis}}? (I, ii, 20). On the lowest level it means tact. In Horace the man who talks to you when you obviously don't want to talk lacks {{lang|la|communis sensus}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lewis|1967|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Compared to Aristotle and his strictest medieval followers, these Roman authors were not so strict about the boundary between animal-like common sense and specially human reasoning. As discussed above, Aristotle had attempted to make a clear distinction between, on the one hand, imagination and the sense perception which both use the sensible {{transl|grc|koiná}}, and which animals also have; and, on the other hand, {{transl|grc|noûs}} (intellect) and reason, which perceives another type of {{transl|grc|koiná}}, the intelligible forms, which (according to Aristotle) only humans have. In other words, these Romans allowed that people could have animal-like shared understandings of reality, not just in terms of memories of sense perceptions, but in terms of the way they would tend to explain things, and in the language they use.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|van Holthoon|1987}}, chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cartesian==
[[File:Descartes mind and body.gif|thumb|200px|right|[[René Descartes]]' illustration of perception. Sensations from the senses travel to {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, seated in the pineal gland inside the brain, and from there to the immaterial spirit.]]
One of the last notable philosophers to accept something like the Aristotelian "common sense" was [[Descartes]] in the 17th century, but he also undermined it. He described this inner faculty when writing in Latin in his ''[[Meditations on first philosophy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Descartes|1901}} Chapter: MEDITATION II.: Of the Nature of the Human Mind ; and that It is More Easily Known than the Body.&lt;/ref&gt; The common sense is the link between the body and its senses, and the true human mind, which according to Descartes must be purely immaterial. Unlike Aristotle, who had placed it in the heart, by the time of Descartes this faculty was thought to be in the brain, and he located it in the [[pineal gland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Descartes|1901}} Chapter: MEDITATION VI.: Of the Existence of Material Things, and of the Real Distinction Between the Mind and Body of Man.&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes' judgement of this common sense was that it was enough to persuade the human consciousness of the existence of physical things, but often in a very indistinct way. To get a more distinct understanding of things, it is more important to be methodical and mathematical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brann|1991|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; This line of thought was taken further, if not by Descartes himself then by those he influenced, until the concept of a faculty or organ of common sense was itself rejected.
{{Quote|René Descartes is generally credited with making obsolete the notion that there was an actual faculty within the human brain that functioned as a {{lang|la|sensus communis}}. The French philosopher did not fully reject the idea of the inner senses, which he appropriated from the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]]. But he distanced himself from the Aristotelian conception of a common sense faculty, abandoning it entirely by the time of his ''[[Passions of the Soul]]'' (1649).&lt;ref name="rosenfeld21" /&gt;}}

Contemporaries such as [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]] and [[Hobbes]] went beyond Descartes in some ways in their rejection of Aristotelianism, rejecting explanations involving anything other than matter and motion, including the distinction between the animal-like judgement of sense perception, a special separate common sense, and the human mind or {{transl|grc|noûs}}, which Descartes had retained from Aristotelianism.&lt;ref&gt;See {{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKFXRA2HPkoC&amp;pg=PA83|page=83|title=The Mechanisation of Aristotelianism: The Late Aristotelian Setting of Thomas Hobbes' Natural Philosophy| first=Cees |last=Leijenhorst| publisher=Brill|isbn=9004117296|year=2002}}. Hobbes (like Gassendi) wrote scornfully of the complex old distinctions, and in particular the medieval concept of sensible "species" (a concept derived from Aristotle's perceptibles):
{{Quote|Some say the Senses receive the Species of things, and deliver them to the Common-sense; and the Common Sense delivers them over to the Fancy, and the Fancy to the Memory, and the Memory to the Judgement, like handing of things from one to another, with many words making nothing understood. ({{citation|first=Thomas |last=Hobbes| title= The English Works of Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury; Now First Collected and Edited by Sir William Molesworth, Bart., 11 vols.| volume=3 (''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'')  |chapter= II.: of imagination| publication-place=London |publisher=Bohn| url= http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/585/89820/2025312}}).}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Descartes who "found it unacceptable to assume that sensory representations may enter the mental realm from without"...
{{Quote|According to Hobbes [...] man is no different from the other animals. [...] Hobbes' philosophy constituted a more profound rupture with [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] thought. He accepted mental representations but [...] "All sense is fancy", as Hobbes famously put it, with the only exception of extension and motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Spruit|1995|pages=403–404}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Descartes portrait.jpg|thumb|right|René Descartes is the source of the most common way of understanding the "common sense" as a widely spread type of judgement.]]
But Descartes used two different terms in his work, not only the Latin term "{{lang|la|sensus communis}}", but also the French term {{lang|fr|bon sens}}, with which he opens his ''Discourse on Method''. And this second concept survived better. This work was written in French, and does not directly discuss the Aristotelian technical theory of perception. {{lang|fr|Bon sens}} is the equivalent of modern English "common sense" or "good sense". As the Aristotelian meaning of the Latin term began to be forgotten after Descartes, his discussion of {{lang|fr|bon sens}} gave a new way of defining {{lang|la|sensus communis}} in various European languages (including Latin, even though Descartes himself did not translate {{lang|fr|bon sens}} as {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, but treated them as two separate things).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011}}, p.&amp;nbsp;282. English is unusual in keeping one term that unites the classical and modern meanings, and philosophical and everyday meanings, so clearly. Italian has {{lang|it|senso comune}} and also {{lang|it|buon senso}}; German has {{lang|de|gemeiner Verstand}}, {{lang|de|gesunder Menschenverstand}}, and {{lang|de|Gemeinsinn}}, used by Kant and others. French also has {{lang|fr|sens commun}}, used by [[Étienne Gilson]] and others. See {{harvtxt|Wierzbicka|2010}}, who also notes that according to Gilson, Descartes himself always referred to {{lang|fr|bon sens}} as {{lang|la|bona mens}} in Latin, never {{lang|la|sensus communis}} (p.&amp;nbsp;340).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=2}} writes that "Descartes is the source of the most common meaning of ''common sense'' today: practical judgment". Gilson noted that Descartes actually gave {{lang|fr|bon sens}} two related meanings, first the basic and widely shared ability to judge true and false, which he also calls {{lang|fr|raison}} ({{literal translation|'reason'|lk=on}}); and second, wisdom, the perfected version of the first. The Latin term Descartes uses, {{lang|la|bona mens}} ({{literal translation|'good mind'}}), derives from the Stoic author [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] who only used it in the second sense. Descartes was being original.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dDpKI8JoLPAC&amp;pg=PA82|page=82| title=Discours de la méthode| chapter=Première Partie; Commentaire Historique| first=Etienne |last=Gilson| year=1925|isbn=9782711601806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that now became influential, developed in both the Latin and French works of Descartes, though coming from different directions, is that common good sense (and indeed sense perception) is not reliable enough for the new Cartesian method of [[skeptical]] [[reason]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cartesian project to replace common good sense with clearly defined mathematical reasoning was aimed at certainty, and not mere probability. It was promoted further by people such as Hobbes, [[Spinoza]], and others and continues to have important impacts on everyday life. In France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Italy, it was in its initial florescence associated with the administration of Catholic empires of the competing [[Bourbon dynasty|Bourbon]], and [[Habsburg dynasty|Habsburg]] dynasties, both seeking to centralize their power in a modern way, responding to [[Machiavelli]]anism and [[Protestantism]] as part of the so-called [[counter reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|van Kessel|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Cartesian theory offered a justification for innovative social change achieved through the courts and administration, an ability to adapt the law to changing social conditions by making the basis for legislation "rational" rather than "traditional".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=52}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} So after Descartes, critical attention turned from Aristotle and his theory of perception, and more towards Descartes' own treatment of common good sense, concerning which several 18th-century authors found help in Roman literature.

==The Enlightenment after Descartes==

===Epistemology: versus claims of certainty===
During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], Descartes' insistence upon a mathematical-style method of thinking that treated common sense and the sense perceptions sceptically, was accepted in some ways, but also criticized. On the one hand, the approach of Descartes is and was seen as radically sceptical in some ways. On the other hand, like the Scholastics before him, while being cautious of common sense, Descartes was instead seen to rely too much on undemonstrable metaphysical assumptions in order to justify his method, especially in its separation of mind and body (with the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} linking them). Cartesians such as [[Henricus Regius]], [[Geraud de Cordemoy]], and [[Nicolas Malebranche]] realized that Descartes's logic could give no evidence of the "external world" at all, meaning it had to be taken on faith.&lt;ref name="gil1"&gt;{{harvtxt|Gilson|1939}}, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Though his own proposed solution was even more controversial, Berkeley famously wrote that enlightenment requires a "revolt from metaphysical notions to the plain dictates of nature and common sense".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Concept of Humanity in an Age of Globalization|first=Longxi |last=Zhang| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUeeHSwEWCcC&amp;pg=PA131|page=131 |isbn=9783862349180 |date=2011-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes and the Cartesian "[[rationalists]]", rejected reliance upon experience, the senses and [[inductive reasoning]], and seemed to insist that certainty was possible. The alternative to induction, deductive reasoning, demanded a mathematical approach, starting from simple and certain assumptions. This in turn required Descartes (and later rationalists such as Kant) to assume the existence of innate or "{{lang|la|[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]}}" [[knowledge]] in the human mind—a controversial proposal.

In contrast to the rationalists, the "[[Empiricism|empiricists]]" took their orientation from [[Francis Bacon]], whose arguments for methodical science were earlier than those of Descartes, and less directed towards mathematics and certainty. Bacon is known for his doctrine of the "[[idols of the mind]]", presented in his ''[[Novum Organum]]'', and in his ''[[Essays (Francis Bacon)|Essays]]'' described normal human thinking as biased towards believing in lies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Francis |last=Bacon |title=On Truth |url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/bacon/bacon_essays.html |access-date=2013-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629183522/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/bacon/bacon_essays.html |archive-date=2013-06-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But he was also the opponent of all metaphysical explanations of nature, or over-reaching speculation generally, and a proponent of science based on small steps of experience,  experimentation and methodical induction. So while agreeing upon the need to help common sense with a methodical approach, he also insisted that starting from common sense, including especially common sense perceptions, was acceptable and correct. He influenced [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Pierre Bayle]], in their critique of metaphysics, and in 1733 [[Voltaire]] "introduced him as the "father" of the [[scientific method]]" to a French audience, an understanding that was widespread by 1750. Together with this, references to "common sense" became positive and associated with modernity, in contrast to negative references to metaphysics, which was associated with the {{lang|fr|[[Ancien Régime]]}}.&lt;ref name="hund" /&gt;

As mentioned above, in terms of the more general epistemological implications of common sense, modern philosophy came to use the term common sense like Descartes, abandoning Aristotle's theory. While Descartes had distanced himself from it, [[John Locke]] abandoned it more openly, while still maintaining the idea of "common sensibles" that are perceived. But then [[George Berkeley]] abandoned both.&lt;ref name="rosenfeld21"&gt;{{harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011|page=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hume]] agreed with Berkeley on this, and like Locke and Vico saw himself as following Bacon more than Descartes. In his synthesis, which he saw as the first Baconian analysis of man (something the lesser known Vico had claimed earlier), common sense is entirely built up from shared experience and shared innate emotions, and therefore it is indeed imperfect as a basis for any attempt to know the truth or to make the best decision. But he defended the possibility of science without absolute certainty, and consistently described common sense as giving a valid answer to the challenge of [[Pyrrhonian skepticism|extreme skepticism]]. Concerning such sceptics, he wrote:
{{Quote|But would these prejudiced reasoners reflect a moment, there are many obvious instances and arguments, sufficient to undeceive them, and make them enlarge their maxims and principles. Do they not see the vast variety of inclinations and pursuits among our species; where each man seems fully satisfied with his own course of life, and would esteem it the greatest unhappiness to be confined to that of his neighbour? Do they not feel in themselves, that what pleases at one time, displeases at another, by the change of inclination; and that it is not in their power, by their utmost efforts, to recall that taste or appetite, which formerly bestowed charms on what now appears indifferent or disagreeable? [...] Do you come to a philosopher as to a cunning man, to learn something by magic or witchcraft, beyond what can be known by common prudence and discretion?&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hume|1987}} Chapter: ESSAY XVIII: THE SCEPTIC&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ethics: "humanist"===
[[File:Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3. Earl of Shaftesbury.jpg|right|thumb|Anthony Ashley Cooper, third Earl of Shaftesbury, and proponent of a Roman-inspired concept of common sense.]]
Once Thomas Hobbes and [[Spinoza]] had applied Cartesian approaches to [[political philosophy]], concerns about the inhumanity of the deductive approach of Descartes increased. With this in mind, [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]] and, much less known at the time, [[Giambattista Vico]], both presented new arguments for the importance of the Roman understanding of common sense, in what is now often referred to, after [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], as a [[Renaissance Humanist|humanist]] interpretation of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=19–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their concern had several inter-related aspects. One ethical concern was the deliberately simplified method that treated human communities as made up of selfish independent individuals ([[methodological individualism]]), ignoring the ''[[sense of community]]'' that the Romans understood as part of common sense. Another connected epistemological concern was that by considering ''common good sense'' as inherently inferior to Cartesian conclusions developed from simple assumptions, an important type of wisdom was being arrogantly ignored.

Shaftesbury's seminal 1709 essay ''Sensus Communis: An Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Humour'' was a highly erudite and influential defense of the use of irony and humour in serious discussions, at least among men of "Good Breeding". He drew upon authors such as [[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]], [[Juvenal]], [[Horace]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]], for whom, he saw, common sense was not just a reference to widely held vulgar opinions, but something cultivated among educated people living in better communities. One aspect of this, later taken up by authors such as Kant, was good taste. Another very important aspect of common sense particularly interesting to later British political philosophers such as [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] was what came to be called ''moral sentiment'', which is different from a tribal or factional sentiment, but a more general fellow feeling that is very important for larger communities:
{{Quote|A {{Not a typo|public|k}} Spirit can come only from a social Feeling or ''Sense of Partnership'' with Human Kind. Now there are none so far from being ''Partners'' in this ''Sense'', or sharers in this ''common Affection'', as they who scarcely know ''an {{Not a typo|Equal|l}}'', nor consider themselves as subject to any law of ''Fellowship'' or ''Community''. And thus Morality and good Government go together.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Shaftesbury|2001}}, Volume I, Part III, section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hutcheson described it as, "a Publick Sense, viz. "our Determination to be pleased with the Happiness of others, and to be uneasy at their Misery."" which, he explains, "was sometimes called {{lang|grc|κοινονοημοσύνη}}&lt;ref&gt;Although Greek, this term {{lang|grc|koinonoēmosúnē}} is from the ''Meditations'' of the Roman emperor-philosopher, Marcus Aurelius, and was possibly coined by him. However Shaftesbury and others suspect it is a Stoic term. (Not many Stoic texts have survived.)&lt;/ref&gt; or Sensus Communis by some of the Antients".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Francis |last=Hutcheson| title=An Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and Affections, with Illustrations on the Moral Sense, ed. Aaron Garrett |publication-place=Indianapolis| publisher=Liberty Fund|year= 2002| chapter= section i: A general Account of our several Senses and Desires, Selfish or Publick|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/885/65922/1605681 |accessdate= 2013-07-25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A reaction to Shaftesbury in defense of the Hobbesian approach of treating communities as driven by individual self-interest, was not long coming in [[Bernard Mandeville]]'s controversial works. Indeed, this approach was never fully rejected, at least in economics. And so despite the criticism heaped upon Mandeville and Hobbes by Adam Smith, Hutcheson's student and successor in Glasgow university, Smith made self-interest a core assumption within nascent modern economics, specifically as part of the practical justification for allowing free markets.

By the late enlightenment period in the 18th century, the communal sense or empathy pointed to by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson had become the "moral sense" or "[[moral sentiment]]" referred to by Hume and [[Adam Smith]], the latter writing in plural of the "moral sentiments" with the key one being ''[[sympathy]]'', which was not so much a public spirit as such, but a kind of extension of self-interest. [[Jeremy Bentham]] gives a summary of the plethora of terms used in British philosophy by the nineteenth century to describe common sense in discussions about ethics:
{{Quote|Another man comes and alters the phrase: leaving out moral, and putting in ''common'', in the room of it. He then tells you, that his common sense teaches him what is right and wrong, as surely as the other's moral sense did: meaning by common sense, a sense of some kind or other, which he says, is possessed by all mankind: the sense of those, whose sense is not the same as the author's, being struck out of the account as not worth taking.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter II, "OF PRINCIPLES ADVERSE TO THAT OF UTILITY", in "[http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/278/20719/941780 An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation]".&lt;/ref&gt;}} This was at least to some extent opposed to the Hobbesian approach, still today normal in economic theory, of trying to understand all human behaviour as fundamentally selfish, and would also be a foil to the new ethics of Kant. This understanding of a moral sense or public spirit remains a subject for discussion, although the term "common sense" is no longer commonly used for the sentiment itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several European languages, a separate term for this type of common sense is used. For example, French {{lang|fr|sens commun}} and German {{lang|de|Gemeinsinn}} are used for this feeling of human solidarity, while {{lang|fr|bon sens}} (good sense) and {{lang|de|gesunder Verstand}} (healthy understanding) are the terms for everyday "common sense".

According to Gadamer, at least in French and British philosophy a moral element in appeals to common sense (or {{lang|fr|bon sens}}), such as found in Reid, remains normal to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=25–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; But according to Gadamer, the civic quality implied in discussion of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} in other European countries did not take root in the German philosophy of the 18th and 19th centuries, despite the fact it consciously imitated much in English and French philosophy. "{{lang|la|Sensus communis|italic=no}} was understood as a purely theoretical judgment, parallel to moral consciousness ([[conscience]]) and [[taste]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} "was emptied and intellectualized by the German enlightenment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; But German philosophy was becoming internationally important at this same time.

Gadamer notes one less-known exception—the [[Württemberg pietism]], inspired by the 18th century [[Swabia]]n churchman, M. [[Friedrich Christoph Oetinger]], who appealed to Shaftesbury and other Enlightenment figures in his critique of the Cartesian rationalism of [[Leibniz]] and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]], who were the most important German philosophers before Kant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=27–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giambattista Vico===
[[File:Giovan Battista Vico.jpg|right|thumb|Giambattista Vico. A defender of classical education in rhetoric, who analysed evidence of ancient wisdom in common sense.]]
Vico, who taught classical rhetoric in [[Naples]] (where Shaftesbury died) under a Cartesian-influenced Spanish government, was not widely read until the 20th century, but his writings on common sense have been an important influence upon [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[Antonio Gramsci#Hegemony|Antonio Gramsci]].&lt;ref name="Bugter1987" /&gt; Vico united the Roman and Greek meanings of the term {{lang|la|communis sensus}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Vico's initial use of the term, which was of much inspiration to Gadamer for example, appears in his ''On the Study Methods of our Time'', which was partly a defense of his own profession, given the reformist pressure upon both his University and the legal system in Naples. It presents common sense as something adolescents need to be trained in if they are not to "break into odd and arrogant behaviour when adulthood is reached", whereas teaching Cartesian method on its own harms common sense and stunts intellectual development. Rhetoric and elocution are not just for legal debate, but also educate young people to use their sense perceptions and their perceptions more broadly, building a fund of remembered images in their imagination, and then using ingenuity in creating linking metaphors, in order to make [[enthymeme]]s. Enthymemes are reasonings about uncertain truths and probabilities—as opposed to the Cartesian method, which was skeptical of all that could not be dealt with as [[syllogism]]s, including raw perceptions of physical bodies. Hence common sense is not just a "guiding standard of [[eloquence]]" but also "the standard of [[practical judgment]]". The imagination or fantasy, which under traditional Aristotelianism was often equated with the {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}}, is built up under this training, becoming the "fund" (to use Schaeffer's term) accepting not only memories of things seen by an individual, but also metaphors and images known in the community, including the ones out of which language itself is made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990}}, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its mature version, Vico's conception of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} is defined by him as "judgment without reflection, shared by an entire class, an entire people, and entire nation, or the entire human race". Vico proposed his own anti-Cartesian methodology for a new Baconian science, inspired, he said, by [[Plato]], [[Tacitus]],&lt;ref&gt;As remarked by several commentators such as Croce and [[Leo Strauss]], during this period citation of Tacitus is referred to as [[Tacitean]]ism, and was often a veiled way of showing the influence of [[Machiavelli]]. Citing Plato on the other hand, shows the typical rejection in this period of Aristotle and scholasticism, but not classical learning in its entirety.&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Bacon and [[Grotius]]. In this he went further than his predecessors concerning the ancient certainties available within vulgar common sense. What is required, according to his new science, is to find the common sense shared by different people and nations. He made this a basis for a new and better-founded approach to discuss [[Natural Law]], improving upon Grotius, [[John Selden]], and [[Pufendorf]] who he felt had failed to convince, because they could claim no authority from nature. Unlike Grotius, Vico went beyond looking for one single set of similarities amongst nations but also established rules about how natural law properly changes as peoples change, and has to be judged relative to this state of development. He thus developed a detailed view of an evolving wisdom of peoples. Ancient forgotten wisdoms, he claimed, could be re-discovered by analysis of languages and myths formed under the influence of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Vico|1968}}, I.ii "Elements" (§§141-146) and I.iv "Method" (§§347-350).&lt;/ref&gt; This is comparable to both [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[Spirit of the Laws]]'', as well as much later [[Hegel]]ian [[historicism]], both of which apparently developed without any awareness of Vico's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cklawreview.com/wp-content/uploads/vol83no3/Bayer.pdf|last=Bayer|journal=Chicago-Kent Law Review|volume=83|issue=3|year=1990|title=Vico's principle of ''sensus communis'' and forensic eloquence}}.

===Thomas Reid and the Scottish school===
[[File:ThomasReid.jpg|right|thumb|Thomas Reid, founder of the Scottish school of Common Sense.]]
Contemporary with Hume, but critical of Hume's scepticism, a so-called [[Scottish Common Sense Realism|Scottish school of Common Sense]] formed, whose basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, [[Thomas Reid]]:
{{Quote|If there are certain principles, as I think there are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity to take for granted in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them — these are what we call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what we call absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor-last=Cuneo |editor2-last=Woudenberg|title=The Cambridge companion to Thomas Reid|year=2004| page= 85 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpQAg6CTl3QC&amp;pg=PA85|isbn=9780521012089}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thomas Reid was a successor to Francis Hutcheson and Adam Smith as [[Professor of Moral Philosophy, Glasgow]]. While Reid's interests lay in the defense of common sense as a type of self-evident knowledge available to individuals, this was also part of a defense of natural law in the style of Grotius. He believed that the term common sense as he used it did encompass both the social common sense described by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, and the perceptive powers described by Aristotelians.

Reid was criticised, partly for his critique of Hume, by Kant and [[J. S. Mill]], who were two of the most important influences in nineteenth century philosophy. He was blamed for over-stating Hume's scepticism of commonly held beliefs, and more importantly for not perceiving the problem with any claim that common sense could ever fulfill Cartesian (or Kantian) demands for absolute knowledge. Reid furthermore emphasized inborn common sense as opposed to only experience and sense perception. In this way his common sense has a similarity to the assertion of {{lang|la|a priori}} knowledge asserted by rationalists like Descartes and Kant, despite Reid's criticism of Descartes concerning his theory of ideas. Hume was critical of Reid on this point.

Despite the criticism, the influence of the Scottish school was notable for example upon American [[pragmatism]], and modern [[Thomism]]. The influence has been particularly important concerning the epistemological importance of a {{lang|la|sensus communis}} for any possibility of rational discussion between people.

==Kant: In aesthetic taste==
[[File:Kant foto.jpg|right|thumb|Immanuel Kant proposed that {{lang|la|sensus communis}} ({{lang-de|Gemeinsinn}}) was a useful concept for understanding aesthetics, but he was critical of the Scottish school's appeals to ordinary widely shared common sense ({{lang|de|gesunden Verstand}}) as a basis of real knowledge.]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] developed a new variant of the idea of {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, noting how having a sensitivity for what opinions are widely shared and comprehensible gives a sort of standard for judgment, and objective discussion, at least in the field of [[aesthetics]] and taste:

{{Quote|multiline=y|''The common Understanding of men'' [{{lang|de|gemeine Menschenverstand}}], which, as the mere sound (not yet cultivated) Understanding, we regard as the least to be expected from any one claiming the name of man, has therefore the doubtful honour of being given the name of common sense [{{lang|de|Namen des Gemeinsinnes}}] ({{lang|la|sensus communis}}); and in such a way that by the name common (not merely in our language, where the word actually has a double signification, but in many others) we understand vulgar, that which is everywhere met with, the possession of which indicates absolutely no merit or superiority.

But under the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} we must include the Idea of a ''communal'' sense [{{lang|de|eines gemeinschaftlichen Sinnes}}], i.e. of a faculty of judgement, which in its reflection takes account ({{lang|la|a priori|italic=no}}) of the mode of representation of all other men in thought; in order as it were to compare its judgement with the collective Reason of humanity, and thus to escape the illusion arising from the private conditions that could be so easily taken for objective, which would injuriously affect the judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kant|1914}}. Key German terms are added in square brackets. See [http://www.korpora.org/Kant/aa05/293.html German text].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kant saw this concept as answering a particular need in his system: "the question of why aesthetic judgments are valid: since aesthetic judgments are a perfectly normal function of the same faculties of cognition involved in ordinary cognition, they will have the same universal validity as such ordinary acts of cognition".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/kantaest/|title=Kant's Aesthetics|first=Douglas |last=Burnham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Kant's overall approach was very different from those of Hume or Vico. Like Descartes, he rejected appeals to uncertain sense perception and common sense (except in the very specific way he describes concerning aesthetics), or the prejudices of one's "{{lang|de|[[Weltanschauung]]}}", and tried to give a new way to certainty through methodical logic, and an assumption of a type of {{lang|la|[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]}} knowledge. He was also not in agreement with Reid and the Scottish school, who he criticized in his ''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]]'' as using "the magic wand of common sense", and not properly confronting the "metaphysical" problem defined by Hume, which Kant wanted to be solved scientifically—the problem of how to use reason to consider how one ought to act.

Kant used different words to refer to his aesthetic {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, for which he used Latin or else German {{lang|de|Gemeinsinn}}, and the more general English meaning which he associated with Reid and his followers, for which he used various terms such as {{lang|de|gemeinen Menscheverstand}}, {{lang|de|gesunden Verstand}}, or {{lang|de|gemeinen Verstand}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011}}, p.&amp;nbsp;312, note 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gadamer, in contrast to the "wealth of meaning" that Vico and Shaftesbury brought from the Roman tradition into their humanism, Kant "developed his moral philosophy in explicit opposition to the doctrine of "moral feeling" that had been worked out in English philosophy". The [[moral imperative]] "cannot be based on feeling, not even if one does not mean an individual's feeling but common moral sensibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=32–34}}. Note: The source makes it clear that "English" includes Scottish authors.&lt;/ref&gt; For Kant, the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} only applied to taste, and the meaning of taste was also narrowed as it was no longer understood as any kind of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taste, for Kant, is universal only in that it results from "the free play of all our cognitive powers", and is communal only in that it "abstracts from all subjective, private conditions such as attractiveness and emotion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant himself did not see himself as a relativist, and was aiming to give knowledge a more solid basis, but as [[Richard J. Bernstein]] remarks, reviewing this same critique of Gadamer:
{{Quote|Once we begin to question whether there is a common faculty of taste (a {{lang|la|sensus communis}}), we are easily led down the path to [[relativism]]. And this is what did happen after Kant—so much so that today it is extraordinarily difficult to retrieve any idea of taste or aesthetic judgment that is more than the expression of personal preferences. Ironically (given Kant's intentions), the same tendency has worked itself out with a vengeance with regards to all judgments of value, including moral judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Richard| last=Bernstein| title=Beyond Objectivism and Relativism: Science, Hermeneutics, and Praxis| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=guJ0-eBoFAEC| year=1983| isbn=0812205502}}, p.&amp;nbsp;120.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Contemporary philosophy==

===Epistemology===
Continuing the tradition of Reid and the enlightenment generally, the common sense of individuals trying to understand reality continues to be a serious subject in philosophy. In America, Reid influenced [[C. S. Peirce]], the founder of the philosophical movement now known as [[Pragmatism]], which has become internationally influential. One of the names Peirce used for the movement was "Critical Common-Sensism". Peirce, who wrote after [[Charles Darwin]], suggested that Reid and Kant's ideas about inborn common sense could be explained by evolution. But while such beliefs might be well adapted to primitive conditions, they were not infallible, and could not always be relied upon.

Another example still influential today is from [[G. E. Moore]], several of whose essays, such as the 1925 "[[A Defence of Common Sense]]", argued that individuals can make many types of statements about what they judge to be true, and that the individual and everyone else knows to be true. [[Michael Huemer]] has advocated an epistemic theory he calls ''[[phenomenal conservatism]]'', which he claims to accord with common sense by way of [[Internalism and externalism|internalist]] [[intuition]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/phen-con/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics: what the community would think===
In twentieth century philosophy the concept of the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as discussed by Vico and especially Kant became a major topic of philosophical discussion. The theme of this discussion questions how far the understanding of eloquent rhetorical discussion (in the case of Vico), or communally sensitive aesthetic tastes (in the case of Kant) can give a standard or model for political, ethical and legal discussion in a world where forms of [[relativism]] are commonly accepted, and serious dialogue between very different nations is essential. Some philosophers such as [[Jacques Rancière]] indeed take the lead from [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and refer to the "[[postmodern]]" condition as one where there is "{{lang|la|dissensus communis}}".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor1-last=van Haute|editor2-last=Birmingham|title=Dissensus Communis: Between Ethics and Politics|year=1995|publisher=Kok Pharos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BK9OTGZ62NEC|isbn=9789039004036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hannah Arendt cropped.jpg|right|thumb|Hannah Arendt, who proposed an adaptation of Kant's aesthetic concept of common sense as having broader relevance to political philosophy.]]

[[Hannah Arendt]] adapted Kant's concept of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as a faculty of aesthetic judgement that imagines the judgements of others, into something relevant for political judgement. Thus she created a "Kantian" political philosophy, which, as she said herself, Kant did not write. She argued that there was often a banality to evil in the real world, for example in the case of someone like [[Adolf Eichmann]], which consisted in a lack of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} and thoughtfulness generally. Arendt and also [[Jürgen Habermas]], who took a similar position concerning Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, were criticised by Lyotard for their use of Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as a standard for real political judgement. Lyotard also saw Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as an important concept for understanding political judgement, not aiming at any consensus, but rather at a possibility of a "[[euphony]]" in "dis-sensus". Lyotard claimed that any attempt to impose any {{lang|la|sensus communis}} in real politics would mean imposture by an empowered faction upon others.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Judging Lyotard| editor-first=Andrew |editor-last=Benjamin| year=1992| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qy17kj4oFocC| isbn=9781134940622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a parallel development, [[Antonio Gramsci]], Benedetto Croce, and later Hans-Georg Gadamer took inspiration from Vico's understanding of common sense as a kind of wisdom of nations, going beyond Cartesian method. It has been suggested that Gadamer's most well-known work, ''[[Truth and Method]]'', can be read as an "extended meditation on the implications of Vico's defense of the rhetorical tradition in response to the nascent methodologism that ultimately dominated academic enquiry".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Gadamer and Ricoeur: Critical Horizons for Contemporary Hermeneutics| editor1-first=Francis J. |editor1-last=Mootz III| editor2-first= George H. |editor2-last=Taylor| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIj4Gi11pJgC|page=84|last=Mootz|chapter=Gadamer's Rhetorical Conception of Hermeneutics as the key to developing a Critical Hermeneutics| isbn=9781441175991 | date=2011-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Gadamer, this was in specific contrast to the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} concept in Kant, which he felt (in agreement with Lyotard) could not be relevant to politics if used in its original sense.

Gadamer came into direct debate with his contemporary Habermas, the so-called {{lang|de|[[Hermeneutikstreit]]}}. Habermas, with a self-declared Enlightenment "prejudice against prejudice" argued that if breaking free from the restraints of language is not the aim of dialectic, then social science will be dominated by whoever wins debates, and thus Gadamer's defense of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} effectively defends traditional prejudices. Gadamer argued that being critical requires being critical of prejudices including the prejudice against prejudice. Some prejudices will be true. And Gadamer did not share Habermas' acceptance that aiming at going beyond language through method was not itself potentially dangerous. Furthermore, he insisted that because all understanding comes through language, hermeneutics has a claim to universality. As Gadamer wrote in the "Afterword" of ''[[Truth and Method]]'', "I find it frighteningly unreal when people like Habermas ascribe to rhetoric a compulsory quality that one must reject in favor of unconstrained, rational dialogue".

[[Paul Ricoeur]] argued that Gadamer and Habermas were both right in part. As a hermeneutist like Gadamer he agreed with him about the problem of lack of any perspective outside of history, pointing out that Habermas himself argued as someone coming from a particular tradition. He also agreed with Gadamer that hermeneutics is a "basic kind of knowing on which others rest."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_KoqK3bl2MAC&amp;pg=PA149|page=149|title=Theology After Ricoeur: New Directions in Hermeneutical Theology
|first= Dan |last= Stiver|year=2001|isbn=9780664222437}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he felt that Gadamer under-estimated the need for a dialectic that was critical and distanced, and attempting to go behind language.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Gadamer and Ricoeur: Critical Horizons for Contemporary Hermeneutics| editor1-first= Francis J. |editor1-last=Mootz III| editor2-first=George H. |editor2-last=Taylor| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIj4Gi11pJgC|chapter=Paul Ricoeur's and Hans-Georg Gadamer's diverging reflections on recognition|last=Vessey| isbn= 9781441175991 | date= 2011-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Paul Ricoeur: The Promise and Risk of Politics|first= Bernard |last= Dauenhauer|year=1998|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ifdWn6SuswMC|isbn= 9780585177724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent commentator on Vico, John D. Schaeffer has argued that Gadamer's approach to {{lang|la|sensus communis}} exposed itself to the criticism of Habermas because it "privatized" it, removing it from a changing and oral community, following the Greek philosophers in rejecting true communal rhetoric, in favour of forcing the concept within a [[Socratic dialectic]] aimed at truth. Schaeffer claims that Vico's concept provides a third option to those of Habermas and Gadamer and he compares it to the recent philosophers [[Richard J. Bernstein]], [[Bernard Williams]], [[Richard Rorty]], and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], and the recent theorist of rhetoric, [[Richard Lanham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990}}, chapters 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Moral sense" as opposed to "rationality"===
The other Enlightenment debate about common sense, concerning common sense as a term for an emotion or drive that is unselfish, also continues to be important in discussion of social science, and especially [[economics]]. The axiom that communities can be usefully modeled as a collection of [[homo economicus|self-interested individuals]] is a central assumption in much of modern [[mathematical economics]], and mathematical economics has now come to be an influential tool of political decision making.

While the term "common sense" had already become less commonly used as a term for the empathetic moral sentiments by the time of Adam Smith, debates continue about [[methodological individualism]] as something supposedly justified philosophically for methodological reasons (as argued for example by [[Milton Friedman]] and more recently by [[Gary Becker|Gary S. Becker]], both members of the so-called [[Chicago school of economics]]).&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[Albert O. Hirschman]], "Against Parsimony: Three Easy Ways of Complicating Some Categories of Economic Discourse." Bulletin of the ''American Academy of Arts and Sciences'' 37, {{abbr|no.|number}} 8 (May '''1984'''): 11–28.&lt;/ref&gt; As in the Enlightenment, this debate therefore continues to combine debates about not only what the individual motivations of people are, but also what can be known about scientifically, and what should be usefully assumed for methodological reasons, even if the truth of the assumptions are strongly doubted. Economics and social science generally have been criticized as a refuge of Cartesian methodology. Hence, amongst critics of the methodological argument for assuming self-centeredness in economics are authors such as [[Deirdre McCloskey]], who have taken their bearings from the above-mentioned philosophical debates involving Habermas, Gadamer, the anti-Cartesian [[Richard Rorty]] and others, arguing that trying to force economics to follow artificial methodological laws is bad, and it is better to recognize social science as driven by rhetoric.

==Catholic theology==
Among Catholic theologians, writers such as theologian [[François Fénelon]] and philosopher [[Claude Buffier]] (1661–1737) gave an anti-Cartesian defense of common sense as a foundation for knowledge. Other catholic theologians took up this approach, and attempts were made to combine this with more traditional Thomism, for example [[Jean-Marie de Lamennais]]. This was similar to the approach of Thomas Reid, who for example was a direct influence on [[Théodore Simon Jouffroy|Théodore Jouffroy]]. This however meant basing knowledge upon something uncertain, and irrational. [[Matteo Liberatore]], seeking an approach more consistent with Aristotle and Aquinas, equated this foundational common sense with the {{transl|grc|koinaí dóxai}} of Aristotle, that correspond to the {{lang|la|communes conceptiones}} of Aquinas.&lt;ref name="gil1" /&gt; In the twentieth century, this debate is especially associated with [[Étienne Gilson]] and [[Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange]].&lt;ref name="murph"&gt;{{citation|title= Art and Intellect in the Philosophy of Etienne Gilson| first= Francesca |last= Aran Murphy|year= 2004| publisher= University of Missouri Press|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ix8sIb9w1tsC| isbn= 9780826262387 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilson pointed out that Liberatore's approach means categorizing such common beliefs as the existence of God or the immortality of the soul, under the same heading as (in Aristotle and Aquinas) such logical beliefs as that it is impossible for something to exist and not exist at the same time. This, according to Gilson, is going beyond the original meaning. Concerning Liberatore he wrote:

{{Quote|Endeavours of this sort always end in defeat. In order to confer a technical philosophical value upon the common sense of orators and moralists it is necessary either to accept Reid's common sense as a sort of unjustified and unjustifiable instinct, which will destroy Thomism, or to reduce it to the Thomist [[nous|intellect]] and reason, which will result in its being suppressed as a specifically distinct faculty of knowledge. In short, there can be no middle ground between Reid and St. Thomas.&lt;ref name="gil1" /&gt;}}

Gilson argued that Thomism avoided the problem of having to decide between Cartesian innate certainties and Reid's uncertain common sense, and that "as soon as the problem of the existence of the external world was presented in terms of common sense, Cartesianism was accepted".&lt;ref name="murph" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3337">'''Croatian Vukovians''' ({{lang-sh|hrvatski vukovci}}) refers to a group of [[Croatia]]n [[linguist]]s that were active at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. Their work focused on the standardization of the Croatian variety of [[Serbo-Croatian]] language. They were led by [[Tomislav Maretić]], and the most prominent members were [[Franjo Iveković]], [[Ivan Broz]], [[Pero Budmani]], [[Armin Pavić]], [[Vatroslav Rožić]] and others.{{sfn|Bičanić|Frančić|Hudeček|Mihaljević|2013|p=84}}

At the period when Vukovians operated, the issue of a dialectal basis for literary Croatian was not yet settled. Vukovians supported the Neoštokavian [[Ijekavian]] dialect ([[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect]]) that was recorded by Karadžić and described by [[Đuro Daničić]]. They advocated the use of phonological [[orthography]]. Through their positions at the [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]] and the [[University of Zagreb]] they exerted influence on the standardization of Croatian.{{sfn|Bičanić|Frančić|Hudeček|Mihaljević|2013|p=84}}

They published three fundamental works:
* ''Hrvatski pravopis'' ("Croatian orthography"), Ivan Broz, 1892
* ''Gramatika i stilistika hrvatskoga ili srpskoga jezika'' ("Grammar and stylistics of Croatian or Serbian language"), Tomislav Maretić, 1899
* ''Rječnik hrvatskoga jezika'' ('"Dictionary of Croatian language"), Franjo Iveković and Ivan Broz, 1901

Primarily due to political reasons as well as their professional competence, the standardological and orthographical conventions introduced and advocated by Vukovians were dominant at the end of the 19th century, and have shaped the course of the language standardization in Croatia in the first half of the 20th century. In their normative works (Maretić's grammar, Broz's orthography and the Broz-Iveković dictionary) they contributed to the final formation of the Croatian standard on Neoštokavian dialectal basis.{{sfn|Bičanić|Frančić|Hudeček|Mihaljević|2013|p=85}}

'''D-3''' is an [[video compression|uncompressed]] composite [[digital video]] [[Videocassette#Cassette formats|videocassette]] format invented at [[NHK]], and introduced commercially by [[Panasonic]] in 1991 to compete with [[Ampex]]'s [[D2 (video format)|D-2]]. It uses half-inch metal particle tape at 83.88&amp;nbsp;mm/s (compare to D-2's 19&amp;nbsp;mm and 131.7&amp;nbsp;mm/s). Like D-2, the [[composite video]] signal is sampled at four times the color subcarrier frequency, with eight bits per sample.  Four channels of 48&amp;nbsp;kHz 16–20 bit PCM audio, and other ancillary data, are inserted during the [[vertical blanking interval]].  The aggregate net (error corrected) bitrate of the format is 143&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s, and because the codec is lossless, it has been used in data applications. [[Camcorder]]s were available which used this format, and are to date the only digital tape camcorders to use a lossless encoding scheme.  The [[D5 HD|D-5]] format, introduced in 1993 by Panasonic and marketed as [[D5 HD|D-5 HD]], uses the D-3 transport and tape running at roughly double D-3 speed.  The D-3 transport in turn is derived from the [[MII (videocassette format)|MII]] transport.  D-3/D-5 tapes come in small (161&amp;nbsp;mm × 96&amp;nbsp;mm × 25&amp;nbsp;mm), medium (212&amp;nbsp;mm × 124&amp;nbsp;mm × 25&amp;nbsp;mm), and large (296&amp;nbsp;mm × 167&amp;nbsp;mm × 25&amp;nbsp;mm) cassettes,  with format-specific recognition holes.  Maximum D-3 runtimes (in the Fujifilm lineup) are 50, 126, and 248 minutes.

The D-3 format is now regarded as obsolete. In the 1990s the [[BBC]] embarked on a massive project to copy its older video tapes onto D-3, but the D-3 cassettes themselves have become unstable and are being transferred again, although there is doubt&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thegreatbear.net/video-tape/d1-d2-d3-histories-digital-video-tape/|title=Histories of digital video tape|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; over whether the surviving D-3 machines will last long enough to play the 340,000 tapes which the corporation holds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/technology/article/art20130704121742520|title=BBC Academy - Technology - Digitising the BBC archive|access-date=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Spanish language}}

'''Dominican Spanish''' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as spoken in the [[Dominican Republic]]; and also among the Dominican diaspora, most of whom live in the United States, chiefly in [[New York City]], [[New Jersey]],  [[Boston]], and [[Miami]].

Dominican Spanish, a subset of [[Caribbean Spanish]], is based on the Andalusian and Canarian Spanish dialects of southern Spain, and has borrowed vocabulary from [[Taíno language|Taíno]] and other [[Arawakan languages]], from West African languages, and from English. Speakers of Dominican Spanish may also use [[Conservative (language)|conservative words]] that in the [[Standard Spanish|upper-class speech of Spain]] would be considered [[archaism]]s. The variety spoken in the [[Cibao]] region is a mixture of two dialects: that of the 16th- and 17th-century [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] colonists in the Cibao valley, and that of the 18th-century [[Canarian]] settlers.&lt;ref name=HenriquezUrenna&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henríquez Ureña|first1=Pedro|authorlink1=Pedro Henríquez Ureña|title=El Español en Santo Domingo|date=1940|publisher=Instituto de Filología de la Universidad de Buenos Aires|location=Buenos Aires|accessdate=29 June 2014|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= |first1= |title=Del Caribe, Números 28-33|date=1998|publisher=Casa del Caribe|isbn= |page=84|url= |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the linguist [[John M. Lipski|John Lipski]], the greatest extra-Hispanic influences on Dominican Spanish have been Haitian Creole&lt;ref name=Lipski1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalrepository.unm.edu/laii_research/8/|title=''A New Perspective on Afro-Dominican Spanish: the Haitian Contribution''|author=John Lipski|publisher=digitalrepository.unm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and West African languages.&lt;ref name=LipskiLatAmSp&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lipski|first1=John M.|authorlink1=John M. Lipski|title=Latin American Spanish|date=1994|page=237|publisher=Longman|location=London|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Most of the Spanish-speaking settlers came from [[Andalusia]] (southern [[Spain]]) and the [[Canary Islands]]. When they first arrived in what is now the Dominican Republic, the first native people they had contact with were the [[Arawak language|Arawak]]-speaking [[Taino people]].

Spanish, just as in other Latin American countries, completely replaced the indigenous languages ([[Taíno language|Taíno]] and the language of the [[Ciguayos]]) of the Dominican Republic to the point where they became entirely extinct, mainly due to the fact that the majority of the indigenous population quickly died out only a few years after European contact.

However, when the Spanish arrived, they found the flora and fauna of the island, as well as various cultural artifacts, very different from those of Spain, so many of the words used by the natives to name these things were conserved and assimilated, thereby enriching Spanish lexicon. Some of these words include: ''[[Chili pepper|ají]], [[Annona squamosa|anón]], [[sweet potato|batata]], [[Barbecue|barbacoa]], [[Guaco|bejuco]], [[Bixa orellana|bija]], [[Caiman (genus)|caiman]], [[Canoe|canoa]], [[Mahogany|caoba]], [[Subsistence agriculture|conuco]], [[Soursop#Annona muricata|guanábana]], [[Guava|guayaba]], [[Hammock|hamaca]], [[Spondias mombin|hobo (jobo)]],  [[Genipa americana|jagua]], [[Peanut|maní]],  [[Papaya|papaya (lechosa)]], [[Savanna|sabana]], [[Manihot esculenta|yuca]].''

The Dominican Spanish lexicon also includes words borrowed from African languages spoken by the Africans brought to the island after the [[Taíno]] extinction, such as ''cachimbo'', which was borrowed from the Portuguese word "cacimba", having the latter being borrowed from the Bantu "cazimba".&lt;ref&gt;http://dle.rae.es/?id=6XDzIZL http://dle.rae.es/?id=6X12dMO&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
*Like many other Spanish dialects, Dominican Spanish features ''[[yeísmo]]'': the sounds represented by ''ll'' (the palatal lateral {{IPA|/ʎ/}}) and ''y'' (historically the palatal approximant {{IPA|/ʝ̞/}}) have fused into one. This merged phoneme is generally pronounced as a {{IPA|[ʝ̞]}} or {{IPA|[dʒ]}} (these are the sounds in [[English language|English]] ''&lt;u&gt;Y&lt;/u&gt;ork'' and ''&lt;u&gt;J&lt;/u&gt;ohn''). That is, in the Dominican Republic (as in most of [[Latin America]] and [[Spain]]), ''se cayó'' "he fell down" is homophonous with ''se calló'' "he became silent / he shut up".
*Dominican Spanish has [[seseo]] (there is no distinction between {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/s/}}). That is, ''caza'' ("hunt") is homophonous with ''casa'' ("house"). ''Seseo'' is common to nearly all of Hispanic America, the Canary Islands, and southern Spain.
*Strong contraction in everyday speech is common, as in ''"voy a"'' into ''"vuá"'' or ''"voá"'', or ''"¿para adónde vas?"'' into ''"¿p'ónde va'?"''. Another example: ''"David 'tá 'co'ta'o"'', from ''"David está acostado"'' ("David is lying down / David is sleeping").
*The fricative {{IPA|/s/}} has a tendency to become an indistinct aspiration or disappear or to become a [[voiceless glottal fricative|voiceless]] {{IPA|[h]}} or [[voiced glottal fricative]] {{IPA|[ɦ]}} (the latter before voiced consonants) at the end of syllables. The change may be realized only at the word level or it may also cross word boundaries. That is, ''las mesas son blancas'' "the tables are white" is pronounced {{IPA|[laɦ ˈmesah sɔn ˈblaŋkah]}}, but in ''las águilas azules'' "the blue eagles", syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}} in ''las'' and ''águilas'' might be resyllabified into the initial syllable of the following vowel-initial words and remain {{IPA|[s]}} ({{IPA|[laˈsaɣilasaˈsulɛh]}}), or become {{IPA|[h]}} (it varies by speaker). Aspiration or disappearance of syllable-final /s/ is common to all of Hispanic America, the Canary Islands, and southern Spain.
**Example 1: To say ''lo niño'' or ''los niño'', instead of ''los niños''
**Example 2: To say ''lluvia ailada'' or ''lluvias ailada'', instead of ''lluvias aisladas''
*In some areas, speakers tend to drop the final ''r'' sound in verb infinitives. The elision is considered a feature of uneducated speakers in some places, but it is widespread in others, at least in rapid speech.
*Syllable-final ''r'' tends to be changed in many words by an ''i'' sound in the Northerly [[Cibao]] region and by an ''l'' (L) in the Eastern and in the capital city ([[Santo Domingo]]): the verb ''correr'' (to run) is pronounced ''correi'' and ''correl'' respectively, and ''perdón'' (forgiveness) becomes ''peidón'' and ''peldón''. This substitution of ''i'' is delicately (almost mutely) present in [[Andalusian Spanish]], and also the ''l'' use is prototypical, and more marked, in [[Puerto Rican Spanish]]. It is believed to be of Andalusian origin.
*Dominican Spanish uses the common Caribbean inverted placement of the second person singular pronoun ''tú'' in front of the verb in questions: ''"¿Cómo tú estás?"'' instead of ''"¿Cómo estás tú?"''. When speaking formally or with those not spoken to with familiarity, they use the more formal ''usted'', instead of ''tú'', the conventional word order is used.
*The "d" is silent in the common word-ending ''-ado''. For example, the words ''casado'' (married) and ''lado'' (side, way) are pronounced as ''casao'' and ''lao'' in Dominican Spanish.
*In a few parts of the country, an "el" at the end of a word is pronounced as "err." For example, ''Miguel'' may be pronounced as ''Miguer'' in Dominican Spanish, a feature shared with [[Andalusian Spanish]] and in contrast to [[Puerto Rican Spanish]], where the reverse occurs, e.g. pronouncing the name ''Arturo'' (Arthur) as ''Alturo''.
*In the northeastern part of the country, some speakers replace a final "l" with "y". An example is the use of "capitay" instead of "capital."

Other differences with [[Standard Spanish]] include subtleties like [[hypercorrection]], in particular, adding the ''s'' erroneously, thus overcompensating the habit of omitting it.

Example 1:
*standard: ''administraciones públicas'' [public administrations]
*vernacular: ''aminitracione pública''
*hypercorrected: ''asministracione púsblica''
Example 2:
*standard: ''jaguar'' [jaguar]
*vernacular: ''jagual'' / ''jaguai''
*hypercorrected: ''jasguar''

The hypercorrected form is more of a blatantly sarcastic mode of speech, commonly used for joking rather than everyday speech.

== Vocabulary ==

As in every dialect, Dominican Spanish has numerous vocabulary differences from other forms of the language. The Dominican Academy of Letters (Academia Dominicana de la Lengua) published in November 2013 a dictionary of Dominican terms (''Diccionario del español dominicano'') containing close to 11,000 words and phrases peculiar to the Dominican dialect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundeu.es/noticia/editan-diccionario-del-espanol-dominicano-que-recoge-mas-de-22-000-acepciones/ Editan «Diccionario del español dominicano» que recoge más de 22 000 acepciones | Fundéu BBVA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Here are some examples:

A slightly pejorative slang expression also common around most of the [[Caribbean]] basin is ''vaina''. The Castilian meanings are "sheath", "pod", "shell", "shell casing", and "hull" (of a plant). It is descended from the [[Latin]] word "vāgīna", which meant "sheath".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=vagina Online Etymological Dictionary], with reference link to [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/vagina Dictionary.com] "Based on the Random House Dictionary"&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the Dominican Republic "vaina" is mainly a thing, a matter, or simply "stuff". For example, ''¿Qué vaina es esa?'' means ''¿Qué cosa es esa?'', "What is that thing/stuff?".

[[Anglicism]]s—due to cultural and commercial influence from the [[United States]] and the [[History of the Dominican Republic|American occupations of the Dominican Republic]] during 1916–1924 and 1965–1966—are extremely common in Dominican Spanish, more so than in any other Spanish variant except for Puerto Rican and perhaps Northern [[Mexican Spanish]]. A prime example of this is "''vaguada''", which is a corruption of the English "''bad weather''", though in Dominican Spanish the term has come to mean storm or torrential downpour, rather than a spot of unpleasant climate. Hence, a common Dominican expression: "''Viene una vaguada''", "here comes a ''vaguada''", or "here comes a storm". Another excellent example of this is "''boche''", a corruption of the English "bull shit", though in Dominican Spanish the term has come to mean a reprimanding, fulmination, or harangue in general terms. Hence, a common Dominican expression: "''Me echaron un boche''", "they threw me a ''boche''", or "they reprimanded me". The pronoun "they" in Dominican Spanish often refers to the third person singular, so that ''me dijeron'', "they told me", is sometimes used instead of "a man told me", or "a woman told me", or "the young boy by the lemon tree told me". Furthermore, is the Dominican Spanish word for [[SUV]], "yipeta", "jeepeta", or rarely "gipeta". This term is a corruption of the American "Jeep", which was the primary mode of transport for the GI's throughout the country during the occupation in the 1960s. Dominican license plates for SUVs are marked with a "G" for "''gipeta''", a variant of, and pronounced like, "yipeta", before their serial number. The word "tichel", from "T-shirt", also refers to a rugby shirt, association football jersey, or undershirt, and similarly, "[[corn flakes]]" and its variant "''con fléi''" can refer to any [[breakfast cereal]], in Dominican Spanish, be it [[puffed corn]], [[bran flakes]], or [[puffed wheat]]. The borrowing "[[polo shirt]]" is frequently pronounced ''polo ché''.

Another phenomenon related to Anglicisms is the usage of brand names as common names for certain objects.&lt;!--this is universal! Is there any language at all which doesn't have this feature?--&gt; For example, "[[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]]" and its derivative ''yilé'' refer to any razor, and while the machete is known as ''machete'', this being originally a Spanish word, it is sometimes referred to as a "colín", derived from "Collins &amp; Co.", name of a former [[Connecticut]] toolmaker.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11635">'''Elias Schwarzfeld''' or '''Schwartzfeld''' ({{lang-he|אליאס (אליהו) שוורצפלד}}; March 7, 1855 &amp;ndash; 1915) was a [[Moldavia]]n, later [[Romania]]n [[Jew]]ish historian, essayist, novelist and newspaperman, also known as a political activist and philanthropist. Writing in several languages ([[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Yiddish]], French), he focused his studies on the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian Jewish community]], while steadily publishing articles and brochures which confronted [[antisemitism]]. The brother of literary historian [[Moses Schwarzfeld]], Elias was the uncle of poet-philosopher [[Benjamin Fondane]].

Harassed and expelled by Romanian authorities, Schwarzfeld settled in France and became a French citizen. While pursuing his literary and scientific activities, he also worked as an assistant to [[Maurice de Hirsch]], managing his various philanthropic projects and, after 1891, the [[Jewish Colonization Association]].

==Biography==

===Romanian career===
Born in [[Iaşi]], Elias Schwarzfeld belonged to a family of intellectual prominence: his father B. Schwarzfeld was a poet&lt;ref name="zoiudaism"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/iudaismul_n_eseistica_lui_fundoianu "Iudaismul în eseistica lui Fundoianu"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 48/1999&lt;/ref&gt; and owner of a large book collection.&lt;ref name="pd597"&gt;Paul Daniel, "Destinul unui poet", in [[Benjamin Fondane|B. Fundoianu]], ''Poezii'', [[Editura Minerva]], Bucharest, 1978, p.597.  {{OCLC|252065138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The future writer, who was two years older than Moses, also had a sister, Adela Schwarzfeld-Wechsler (1859 – 1953), mother of Benjamin Fondane.&lt;ref name="pd597"/&gt; Elias received his early education in the city's [[Education in Romania|public schools]], and while still a student, between 1871 and 1873, contributed to the Iaşi papers ''Curierul de Iaşi'' and ''Noul Curier Român''.&lt;ref name="isencycl"&gt;[[Isidore Singer]], [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=395&amp;letter=S "Schwarzfeld"], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' entry&lt;/ref&gt; Like his two siblings, Elias was raised within an intellectual environment shaped by ''[[Junimea]]'' literary society, his family being acquainted with several of ''Junimea''{{'}}s leading members.&lt;ref name="pd597"/&gt;

In 1872, Schwarzfeld participated in setting up ''Vocea Aparătorului'' ("The Defender's Voice"), a review started on behalf of the Jews.&lt;ref name="isencycl"/&gt; In May 1874, he founded in Iaşi ''Revista Israelitică'' ("The [[Israelites]]' Review"), in which he published his first Jewish novel, ''Darascha''.&lt;ref name="isencycl"/&gt; From 1874 to 1876, Elias Schwarzfeld studied medicine at the [[University of Bucharest]], abandoning it later to take up the study of law.&lt;ref name="isencycl"/&gt; In 1881,&lt;ref name="isencycl"/&gt; he became a [[Doctor of Law]], the title being awarded to him by the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] in Belgium.&lt;ref name="pd597"/&gt;

Between 1877 and 1878, Schwarzfeld edited the Yiddish daily ''Jüdischer Telegraf''; after this had ceased publication, he edited the Yiddish biweekly ''Ha-Yoetz''.&lt;ref name="isencycl"/&gt; During this period, Schwarzfeld became interested in advancing the cause of the [[Jewish emancipation|non-emancipated]] Jewish community in the [[Kingdom of Romania]]: in 1878 he published his first pamphlet, ''Chestia şcoalelor israelite şi a progresului israelit în România'' ("The Issue of Israelite Schools and the Israelite Progress in Romania"), occasioned by a circular which the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]] had issued calling for information regarding the state of education among the Romanian Jews.&lt;ref name="isencycl"/&gt;

In 1881, on settling in [[Bucharest]], he took charge of the paper ''Fraternitatea'' ("Brotherhood").&lt;ref name="isencycl"/&gt; He was at this time one of the principal collaborators on ''Anuarul pentru Israeliţi'' ("Yearbook for Israelites"), founded by his brother Moses in 1877. Presided upon by scholar [[Moses Gaster]], the ''Anuarul pentru Israeliţi'' staff, Elias included, promoted a moderate [[Jewish assimilation|assimilationist]] agenda (''[[Haskalah]]'').&lt;ref name="mshask"&gt;Măriuca Stanciu, [http://ebooks.unibuc.ro/filologie/hebra/2-4.htm "A Promoter of the Haskala in Romania–Moses Gaster"], in the [[University of Bucharest]]'s [http://ebooks.unibuc.ro/filologie/hebra/ ''Studia Hebraica I''], 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this journal that he published, from 1884 to 1898, his numerous studies on the history of the Jews in Romania.&lt;ref name="isencycl"/&gt; In 1883, he published another novel, ''Rabinul făcător de minuni, conte populaire'' ("The Miraculous [[Rabbi]], a Folk Tale").&lt;ref name="isencycl"/&gt;

Involved with the [[B'nai B'rith]], an international [[service club]] for the Jewish communities, he was vice-president of the ''Fraternitatea'' lodge, and later as secretary-general of the supreme council of the Jewish lodges of Romania.&lt;ref name="isencycl"/&gt; In 1885 he published, in behalf of coreligionists in the small towns and villages, two pamphlets discussing cases of [[antisemitic]] persecution and Jewish reactions: ''Radu Porumbaru şi isprăvile lui la Fabrica de Hârtie din Bacău'' ("[[Radu Porumbaru]] and His Doings at the [[Bacău]] Paper Mill"), ''Adevărul asupra revoltei de la Brusturoasa'' ("The Truth on the Revolt in [[Brusturoasa]]").&lt;ref name="isencycl"/&gt;

===Expulsion and move to France===
Schwarzfeld's activities having rendered him objectionable to the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal]] government of [[Ion Brătianu]], he was expelled October 17, 1885, only forty-eight hours being given to him to arrange his personal affairs.&lt;ref name="isencycl"/&gt; Driven out of Romania at roughly the same time as Gaster, who had also spoken out against official antisemitism,&lt;ref name="zoiudaism"/&gt; he consequently moved to France, settling in [[Paris]]. In 1886, he was appointed by Baron [[Maurice de Hirsch]] secretary of his private bureau of charity.&lt;ref name="isencycl"/&gt; When Hirsch founded the [[Jewish Colonization Association]] (1891), Schwarzfeld became its secretary-general; up to the death of Clara Baroness Hirsch he acted as her secretary in the distribution of her charities.&lt;ref name="isencycl"/&gt; Eventually, Schwarzfeld was [[Naturalization|naturalized]] a French citizen.&lt;ref name="zoiudaism"/&gt;

From Paris, Schwarzfeld continued his literary activity in behalf of his Romanian coreligionists, and he was co-editor of ''Egalitatea'' ("Equality"), the Bucharest-based Jewish periodical founded in Bucharest by his brother.&lt;ref name="isencycl"/&gt; He had an international career as an essayist and historian: in 1901, the ''[[American Jewish Year Book]]'' published his ''The Jews of Rumania from the Earliest Time to the Present Day'' and ''The Situation of the Jews in Rumania Since the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Berlin Treaty (1878)]]''; an essay on ''The Jews of Moldavia at the Beginning of the Eighteenth Century'' appeared in ''[[The Jewish Quarterly Review]]'', vol. xvi., and another entitled ''Deux episodes de l'histoire des juifs roumains'' in the ''[[Revue des Études Juives]]'', vol. xiii.&lt;ref name="isencycl"/&gt; His ''Les juifs en Roumaine depuis le Traité de Berlin'' ("The Jews of Romania since the Berlin Treaty") appeared under the pseudonym ''Edmond Sincerus'' ([[London]], 1901).&lt;ref name="isencycl"/&gt;

Elias Schwarzfeld also completed work on several new novels: in 1890, ''Bercu Batlen''; in 1895, ''Gângavul'' ("The Stammerer"), ''Beţivul'' ("The Drunkard"), ''Prigonit de soartă'' ("Persecuted by Fate"); in 1896, ''O fată bătrână'' ("An Old Maid"), ''Unchiul Berisch'' ("Uncle Berisch"), ''Un vagabond'' ("A Vagabond"), ''Schimschele Ghibor'', ''Judecata poporană'' ("The People's Judgment"); in 1897, ''Polcovniceasa'' ("The [[Polkovnik]]'s Wife").&lt;ref name="isencycl"/&gt; Most of these novels have been translated into the [[Hebrew language]] and published by M. Braunstein-Mebaschan.&lt;ref name="isencycl"/&gt; Schwarzfeld also translated into Romanian several novels by, among others, [[Sámuel Kohn]], [[Leopold Kompert]], [[Marcus Lehman (rabbi)|Marcus Lehman]], [[Ludwig Philippson]], [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]].&lt;ref name="isencycl"/&gt; In addition, he published Romanian versions of [[Isidore Loeb]]'s article ''Juifs'' ("Jews"), [[Arsène Darmesteter]]'s pamphlet on the [[Talmud]], and the two lectures by [[Ernest Renan]] on [[Judaism]].&lt;ref name="isencycl"/&gt;

Elias Schwarzfeld's death was marked with an obituary piece in the Jewish magazine ''[[Mântuirea]]'', which was incidentally [[Benjamin Fondane]]'s earliest contribution to this periodical.&lt;ref name="zoiudaism"/&gt; Fondane praised his uncle as "the only historian of the Romanian Jews", a "living archive", and the wager of a "holy battle" for the defense of Jewish rights.&lt;ref name="zoiudaism"/&gt; Schwarzfeld's contribution also earned posthumous praise in later decades. Writing in 1999, literary historian [[Z. Ornea]] described his predecessor's contribution to the field of Jewish Romanian history as "remarkable".&lt;ref name="zoiudaism"/&gt; In 2002, [[Editura Hasefer]] republished some of Schwarzfeld's scholarly contributions in an [[anthology]] edited by historian [[Lya Benjamin]]: ''Evreii în texte istoriografice''. It notably includes his posthumously published reply to Romanian [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic nationalist]] historian [[Nicolae Iorga]]'s ''Istoria evreilor în ţările noastre'' ("The History of the Jews in Our Countries", 1913).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/index.html/articles|details?articleID=5092 "''Evreii în texte istoriografice.

'''Elsa Asenijeff''' ('''Elsa Maria Packeny''' 3 January 1867 in Vienna, Austria-Hungary &amp;ndash; 5 April 1941 in Bräunsdorf), was an Austrian writer and partner of [[Max Klinger]].

== Life ==
Elsa Maria Packeny came from the Viennese bourgeoisie. Her father Karl Packeny was director of the Austrian Southern Railway. Until 1887 she attended the Vienna teacher training center.

After she had refused some marriage proposals, her parents forced her to marry. In 1890 she married the eleven years older Bulgarian engineer and diplomat Ivan Johann Nestoroff and went with him to Sofia. The marriage was not happy. She felt at the mercy of her husband, a theme that influenced her literary works in many ways. In 1896 her narrative volume ''Is That Love?'' under the pseudonym Elsa Asenijeff, which she had chosen in memory of her deceased firstborn son Asen.

In 1896 she divorced Nestoroff. The Bulgarian state allowed her to use Asenijeff as her official name. In 1897 she went to Leipzig to study philosophy and economics. Her second son Heraclitus, born in 1896,&amp;nbsp; left her with the grandparents.

[[File:Asenijeff Zeichnung.jpg|thumb|left|Elsa Asenijeff 1904, drawing by Max Klinger]]
At a Literary Society festival in Leipzig for [[Detlev von Liliencron]] (1844-1909) and [[Frank Wedekind]] (1864-1918), she met the painter and sculptor Max Klinger (1857&amp;ndash;1920). She became a model, muse and lover for him. Klinger did not make the relationship public. He paid for her expensive apartment in the prestigious music district (270 m² in Schwägrichenstraße 11, Hochparterre). She accompanied him on numerous trips and worked as a hostess at social events. She was considered an extremely impressive, fascinating, sometimes even extravagant personality. Their daughter Désirée was born on September 7, 1900, during a longer stay  in Paris. She was given to a French foster mother.

In 1903, Klinger purchased a vineyard in [[Großjena]], including a winegrower's cottage, which he converted into a normal residential building in order to be able to withdraw from the hectic city life of Leipzig with Asenijeff. More books of hers appeared. From 1912 she also wrote poetry. Guests of their salon were, among others, the three young poets [[Walter Hasenclever]] (1890-1940), [[Kurt Pinthus]] (1886&amp;ndash;1975) and [[Franz Werfel]] (1890&amp;ndash;1945).&lt;ref&gt;Leipzig-Lexikon&lt;/ref&gt;

An alienation between Klinger and Asenijeff deepened further when Klinger in 1911 chose 18-year-old Gertrud Bock (1893-1932) as a model and constant companion, who he married a few months before his death. In 1916, the final break between Asenijeff and Klinger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106102948/http://www2.onb.ac.at/ariadne/frauenwerke/asenijeff_e.htm|title=Elsa Asenijeff (1868-1941)|last=|first=|date=2006|website=Österreichische Nationalbibliothek|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This separation met Elsa Asenijeff mentally and materially very difficult, because Klinger denied her any further support. In 1917 she had to give up the apartment in the Dufourstraße 18, in which she had moved in 1909. She only lived on a pension. She began a descent into poverty, associated with a certain decay of personality. Even a poetry book published in 1922 brought no change.

Elsa Asenijeff was completely isolated, had no connection to her Viennese relatives, and her daughter Désirée, who spent some time in Leipzig for the funeral of her father in 1920, did not make any closer contact with her. Lease debts eventually led to admission to the Psychiatric Clinic of the University of Leipzig. Her incapacitation considered her a fraud and claimed damages because she still considered herself one of the greatest female writers. A two-year stay in the Leipzig-Dösen hospital, followed in 1926 by the transfer to Hubertusburg and finally as "not gemgemefährlich" in the supply Colditz. In 1933, the competent authorities relocated this facility to Bräunsdorf near Freiberg as a "Correctional Institution for asocial and unwilling adults".

'''Erotic asphyxiation''' (variously called '''asphyxiophilia''', '''hypoxyphilia''' or '''breath control play''') is the intentional restriction of [[oxygen]] to the brain for the purposes of [[sexual arousal]]. The term '''autoerotic asphyxiation''' is used when the act is done by a person to him- or herself. Colloquially, a person engaging in the activity is sometimes called a ''gasper''.&lt;ref name="Lost English"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Chris|title=Lost English: Words And Phrases That Have Vanished From Our Language|date=30 January 2012|publisher=Michael O'Mara Books|isbn=978-1843172789|page=66}}&lt;!--|accessdate=17 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The erotic interest in asphyxiation is classified as a [[paraphilia]] in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' of the [[American Psychiatric Association]].

==Physiology==
Author John Curra wrote, "The [[carotid arteries]] (on either side of the neck) carry [[oxygen]]-rich blood from the heart to the brain. When these are compressed, as in strangulation or hanging, the sudden loss of oxygen to the brain and the accumulation of [[carbon dioxide]] can increase feelings of giddiness, lightheadedness, and pleasure, all of which will heighten masturbatory sensations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Relativity of Deviance|author=John Curra|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks, California|year=2000|page=111|isbn=0-7619-0778-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author George Shuman describes the effect as such, "When the brain is deprived of oxygen, it induces a lucid, semi-hallucinogenic state called [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]. Combined with [[orgasm]], the rush is said to be no less powerful than cocaine, and highly addictive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Last Breath: A Sherry Moore Novel|author=George D. Shuman|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2007|page=80|isbn=1-4165-3491-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning hallucinogenic states brought about by chronic hypoxia, Dr. E L Lloyd notes that they may be similar to the hallucinations experienced by climbers at altitude. He further notes that no such state occurs in hypoxia brought about by sudden aircraft decompression at altitude. These findings suggest to him that they do not arrive purely from a lack of oxygen. Upon examining the studies on hypoxia he found that "abnormalities in the cerebral neurochemistry involving one or more of the interconnected [[neurotransmitters]], [[dopamine]], [[serotonin]], and [[beta-endorphin]] had been reported in all the conditions associated with hallucinations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Points: Hallucinations, hypoxia, and neurotransmitters|author=Dr. E L Lloyd|publisher=British Medical Journal Volume 292| date=29 March 1986|page=903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Historically, the practice of autoerotic asphyxiation has been documented since the early 17th century. It was first used as a treatment for [[erectile dysfunction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sataniclust.com/04_06/pro_0406_asphyxiation.htm|title=Erotic Asphyxiation|work=Lust Magazine|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for this most likely came from subjects who were executed by [[hanging]]. Observers at public hangings noted that male victims developed an [[erection]], sometimes remaining after death (a [[death erection]]), and occasionally [[ejaculation|ejaculated]] when being hanged. However, [[post-mortem ejaculation]] occurs in hanging victims after death because of disseminated muscle relaxation; this is a different mechanism from that sought by autoerotic asphyxiation practitioners.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Practice==
Various methods are used to achieve the level of oxygen depletion needed, such as a hanging, suffocation with a plastic bag over the head, self-[[strangulation]] such as with a [[Ligature (medicine)|ligature]], gas or volatile solvents, chest compression, or some combination of these.&lt;ref name = Blanchard1991/&gt; Sometimes, complicated devices are used to produce the desired effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Halloran | first1 = R.

E. | year = 1993 | title = Autoerotic fatalities with power hydraulics | url = | journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 359–364 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice can be dangerous even if performed with care and has resulted in a significant number of accidental deaths. Uva (1995) writes “Estimates of the mortality rate of autoerotic asphyxia range from 250 to 1000 deaths per year in the United States.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Uva | first1 = J.

== Accidental death ==
{{See also|Autoerotic fatality}}

Deaths often occur when the loss of consciousness caused by partial asphyxia leads to loss of control over the means of strangulation, resulting in continued asphyxia and death. While often asphyxiophilia is incorporated into sex with a partner, others enjoy this behaviour by themselves, making it potentially more difficult to get out of dangerous situations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/autoerotic-asphyxiophilia Autoerotic Asphyxiophilia] on 'Sexinfo' website, University of Santa Barbara, Ca.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some fatality cases, the body of the asphyxiophilic individual is discovered naked or with genitalia in hand, with pornographic material or sex toys present, or with evidence of having orgasmed prior to death.&lt;ref name = Janssen2005/&gt; Bodies found at the scene of an accidental death often show evidence of other [[paraphilic]] activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00000433-199103000-00012 | last1 = Bogliolo | first1 = L.

This can have the consequence of making the death appear to be a deliberate suicide, rather than an accident.&lt;ref&gt;Downs, Martin.

== In fiction ==
{{refimprove|date=September 2018}}
The sensational nature of autoerotic asphyxiation often makes it the subject of [[urban legends]].  It has also been mentioned specifically in a number of works of fiction.
* In the [[Marquis de Sade]]'s famous novel ''Justine, or The Misfortunes of the Virtue'', Justine is subjected to this by one of her captors.  She survives the encounter.
* In the Guts short story in [[Chuck Palahniuk|Chuck Palahniuk's]] novel [[Haunted (Palahniuk novel)|''Haunted'']], one the characters discusses parents who discover the accidental deaths of their sons to autoerotic asphyxiation.  They are said to cover up the deaths before police or coroners arrive to save the family from shame.
* In the novel (and later movie adaptation) ''[[Rising Sun (novel)|Rising Sun]]'', death as a result of this type of sexual arousal is explained when it is offered as a possible cause for a murder victim's death.
* In the film ''[[World's Greatest Dad]]'', the protagonist's teenage son accidentally kills himself with asphyxiation whilst sexually aroused. The protagonist then stages his son's death as a suicide, which gives him the opportunity to rise to infamy via a [[Literary forgery|literary hoax]].
* In the film ''[[Ken Park]]'' a character named Tate practices autoerotic asphyxia.
* Autoerotic asphyxiation occurs in the [[cold open]] of ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'' episode ''Back to the Garden''. 
* [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] from ''[[South Park]]'' dies from suffocating while wearing a [[Batman]] costume and practicing autoerotic asphyxia in the episode "[[Sexual Healing (South Park)|Sexual Healing]]". 
* In the season four episode of ''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]'', titled "Monkey Business", the character Zig Semetauer is found dead in his bathroom by [[Hank Moody|Hank]], Charlie and Stu after suffocating due to autoerotic asphyxia, to which Hank quips "I'm not averse to the occasional choke-n'-stroke, but this is a prime example of why one must always use a [[buddy system]]."
* A character in the film ''[[Knocked Up]]'' offers to be a "[[:wikt:spotter|spotter]]" for a friend if he intends on performing autoerotic asphyxiation.
* Bruce Robertson, the main character in the 1998 [[Irvine Welsh]] novel, ''[[Filth (novel)|Filth]]'' engages in the practice.  This is also depicted in the 2013 film adaptation.
*In the sixth episode, season two of [[BoJack Horseman|Bojack Horseman]], autoerotic asphyxiation and celebrity deaths are recurrent discussions.

The '''Gallong''' or '''Galo''' language is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language of the [[Tani languages|Tani]] group, spoken by the [[Galo people]]. Its precise position within Tani is not yet certain, primarily because of its central location in the Tani area and the strong effects of intra-Tani contacts on the development of Tani languages. It is an endangered language according to the normal definitions, but prospects for its survival are better than many similarly-placed languages in the world.

==Dialects==
The major Galo dialects are Pugo, spoken around the district capital [[Along, Arunachal Pradesh|Aalo]]; Lare, spoken to the south of [[Aaloo]]; and a dialect that can provisionally be called "Northwestern", spoken in the northwest near the [[Tagin people|Tagin]] area. There may be additional Galo dialects further north, which remains largely unresearched. There are numerous subdialects that often correspond to regional or clan groupings. Neighbouring languages include [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Bodo language|Bodo]], [[Mishing language|Mising]], [[Minyong language|Minyong]], [[Hills Miri dialect|Hills Miri]], [[Tagin language|Tagin]], [[Nishi language|Nishi]], [[Bori language|Bori]], [[Pailibo language|Pailibo]], [[Ramo language|Ramo]] and [[Bokar language|Bokar]].

Post (2007:46) lists a provisional classification of Galo dialects.

'''
**Karkòo?
**Gensìi?
**Taíi(podia)
***(branch)
***Zɨrdóo
****(branch)
****Larèe, Puugóo

==Grammar==
Like most central and eastern Tani languages, Galo is largely [[synthetic language|synthetic]] and [[agglutinating]]. Two primary [[lexical tone]]s are present – High and Low – which may reflect two Proto-Tani syllable tones; in modern Galo, the surface TBU (Tone-Bearing Unit) is the usually polysyllabic phonological word. A robust [[finite verb|finite]]/non-finite asymmetry underlies Galo grammar, and [[clause chaining]] and [[nominalization]] are both rampant. No synchronic verb-serialization appears to exist, although what seems to have been proto-verb-serialization has developed into a very large and productive system of derivational suffixes to bound verbal roots.

Major (non-derived) lexical classes are noun, adjective and verb. Other grammatical features include [[postposition]]s, [[relator noun]]s, [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]], an extremely large system of [[aspect (linguistics)|aspect]]ual suffixes, and a rich set of constituent-final particles coding functions related to epistemological status (such as evidentiality), discourse/pragmatic status, modality, and other related functions. Case-marking is basically [[accusative case|accusative]]; [[ergativity]] has not been found.

==Education==
Galo language is taught as third language in schools of areas dominated by Galo community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northeasttoday.in/arunachal-to-preserve-dying-local-dialects/ Arunachal to Preserve ‘Dying’ Local Dialects - North East Today]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Google Translator Toolkit''' is a [[web application]] designed to allow translators to edit the translations that [[Google Translate]] automatically generates. With the Google Translator Toolkit, translators can organize their work and use shared translations, [[Glossary|glossaries]] and [[translation memories]]. They can upload and translate [[Microsoft Word]] documents, [[OpenDocument]], [[Rich Text Format|RTF]], [[HTML]], text, and Wikipedia articles.

Google Translator Toolkit is supported by [[Google Translate]], a web-based translation service. Google Translator Toolkit can be configured to automatically pre-translate uploaded documents using Google Translate.

Google Translator Toolkit was released by [[Google|Google Inc.]] on June 8, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wleblog.blogspot.com/2009/06/translating-worlds-information-with.html 
|title=Translating the world's information with Google Translator Toolkit
|accessdate=2012-02-02
|publisher=Google
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This product was expected to be named Google Translation Center, as had been announced in August 2008. However, the Google Translation Toolkit turned out to be a less ambitious product: "document rather than project-based, intended not as a process management package but simply another personal [[translation memory]] tool".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  |author1=Garcia, I. |author2=Stevenson, V. | title = Google Translator Toolkit. Free web-based [[translation memory]] for the masses
  | journal = Multilingual
  | issue = September 2009
  | pages = 16–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google claims that Google Translator Toolkit is part of their "effort to make information universally accessible through translation" and "helps translators translate better and more quickly through one shared, innovative translation technology". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=//translate.google.com/toolkit 
|title=Google Translator Toolkit
|accessdate=2010-04-19
|publisher=Google
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the Google Translator Toolkit was meant to attract collaboratively-minded people, such as those who translate Wikipedia entries or material for [[non-governmental organization]]s. However, nowadays it is also more and more widely used in commercial translation projects.&lt;ref name="autogenerated16"&gt;{{cite journal
  |author1=Garcia, I. |author2=Stevenson, V. | title = Google Translator Toolkit. Free web-based translation memory for the masses
  | journal = Multilingual
  | issue = September 2009
  | pages = 16–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The significance of the Google Translator Toolkit is its position as a fully online [[software-as-a-service]] (SaaS) that mainstreams some backend enterprise features and hitherto fringe innovations, presaging a radical change in how and by whom translation is performed". &lt;ref name="autogenerated16"/&gt;

== Source and target languages ==
Starting with only one source language – English and 47 target languages in June 2009, Google Translator Toolkit now supports 100,000 language pairs. Translator Toolkit can translate from 345 source languages into 345 target languages.
&lt;ref&gt;[https://support.google.com/translate/toolkit/answer/147837?hl=en Google translator toolkit - Supported languages]&lt;/ref&gt;

== User interface ==
As of March 6 2017, Google Translator Toolkit's user interface is available in 37 languages:&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/toolkit/settings Translator Toolkit Settings]&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional - Taiwan), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Filipino, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese.

== Workflow ==

The workflow of Google Translator Toolkit can be described as follows. First, users upload a file from their desktop or enter a URL of a web page or Wikipedia article that they want to translate. Google Translator Toolkit automatically 'pretranslates' the document. It divides the document into segments, usually sentences, headers, or bullets. Next, it searches all available translation databases for previous human translations of each segment. If any previous human translations of the segment exist, Google Translator Toolkit picks the highest-ranked search result and 'pretranslates' the segment with that translation. If no previous human translation of the segment exists, it uses machine translation to produce an 'automatic translation' for the segment, without intervention from human translators.

Users can then work on reviewing and improving the automatic translation. They can click on the sentence and fix a translation, or they can use Google‘s translation tools to help them translate by clicking the "Show toolkit" button.

By using the toolkit, they can view translations previously entered by other users in the "Translation search results" tab, or use the "Dictionary" tab to search for the right translations for hard-to-find words. In addition, translators can use features like custom, multi-lingual glossaries and view the machine translation for reference. They can also share their translations with their friends by clicking the "Share" button and inviting them to help edit or view their translation. When they are finished, they can download the translation to their desktop. For Wikipedia articles, they can easily publish back to the source pages.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://blog.wikimedia.org/2009/06/09/google-translator-toolkit-supports-wikipedia/ Google Translator Toolkit Supports Wikipedia]'', Wikimedia blog, June 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googletranslate.blogspot.com/2010/07/translating-wikipedia.html |title=Translating Wikipedia |date= July 14, 2010 |website=Google Translate blog |publisher= |accessdate=26 October 2013 | quote=In three months, we used a combination of human and machine translation tools to translate 600,000 words from more than 100 articles in English Wikipedia, growing Hindi Wikipedia by almost 20 percent. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson: Kadarism - Is it Here to Stay?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717201044/http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/36-7-72.shtml |date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (after [[János Kádár]]) refers to the variety of [[communism]] as practised in the [[Hungarian People's Republic]] from the 1960s until the [[Central Europe]]an [[collapse of communism]] in 1989. With elements of [[regulated market]] economics as well as an improved [[human rights]] record, it represented a quiet reform and deviation from the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] principles applied to Hungary in the previous decade.

The name is a semi-humorous [[metaphor]] derived from "[[goulash]]", a popular Hungarian dish. As goulash is made with an assortment of unlike ingredients, it represents how Hungarian communism was a mixed ideology and how it no longer strictly adhered to [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] interpretations as in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Thayer. "[http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/hungary.htm Economic History and the Economy of Hungary]". Department of Economics, San José State University.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes described as "the happiest barracks in the [[barracks communism|socialist camp]]",{{Elucidate|date=August 2016}} Hungary in this particular period enjoyed many amenities not available in the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc]].{{Clarify|date=August 2016}}.

== Origins ==
[[File:Hungary socialism.JPG|thumb|250px|2009: The physical legacy of the socialist system in Hungary in the form of an [[Ikarus Bus]] and [[panelház]], [[Budapest]]-[[Újpalota]]]]
In 1962, six years after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], the 8th Congress of the [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party]] declared the period of "consolidation of socialism" after 1956 to be over and that the "foundations for the establishment of a socialist society" had been achieved, which enabled a general [[amnesty]] of most people sentenced in connection with 1956. Under [[János Kádár]], the party gradually curbed some of the excesses of the [[secret police]] and repealed most of the restrictions on speech and movement enacted in the [[Mátyás Rákosi]] era. In their place, the party introduced a relatively liberal cultural and economic course aimed at overcoming the post-1956 hostility toward the Kádár government.&lt;ref name = "Stokes1"&gt;Stokes, Gale. The Walls Came Tumbling Down: The Collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe, (Oxford, 1993), pp. 81-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the Central Committee approved the "[[New Economic Mechanism]]" which eased foreign trade restrictions gave limited freedom to the workings of the market and allowed a limited number of small businesses to operate in the services sector. Though liberal in comparison to Soviet socialism, the first relaxation of economic control was far from posing the same threat as the 1956 reforms. Official policy employed different methods of administering the collectives, leaving the pace of [[mechanization]] up to each separately.&lt;ref name="Stokes1"/&gt;

Additionally, rather than enforcing the system of compulsory crop deliveries and of workdays credit the collectivizers used monthly cash wages.&lt;ref name = "Stokes1"/&gt; Later in the 1960s, cooperatives were permitted to enter into related and then general auxiliary businesses such as food processing, light industry and service industry.&lt;ref name = "Stokes1"/&gt;

== Ideology ==
Goulash Communism showed a far greater concern for [[public opinion]] and an increased focus on the present (rather than future) material well-being of the citizens than had been the case in the period preceding 1956. It provided a wider latitude for [[dissent]] than was the case in the rest of the Soviet bloc (in the words of Kádár, "who is not against us is with us"), modified the role of the Communist Party in the development of socialism (now interpreted as "serving" rather than "commanding"), reduced the formality of relations between the party and the populace at large, increased the scope of societal self-expression and self-management and refined the guiding [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] ideology with modified means of dissemination. Marxist–Leninist ideology is invoked in the desire to reform as seen in [[Imre Nagy]]'s "Reform Communism" (1955–1956). He argues that Marxism is a "science that cannot remain static but must develop and become more perfect".&lt;ref name = "Stokes2"&gt;Stokes, Gale, ed. From Stalinism to Pluralism: A Documentary History of Eastern Europe Since 1945, (Oxford, 1996), pp. 81-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

He attributes Marx to having created a method, meant to guide yet not entirely encompass socialism or its development. "The theory of Marx &amp;ndash; as Lenin stated – gives general guiding principles, which must be utilized in Britain in another fashion than in France, in France differently than".&lt;ref name = "Stokes2"/&gt; This interpretation was not shared by the Soviet leadership, [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s response to Hungary in 1956 and [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s to Czechoslovakia in 1968 and the resulting [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] stating that though "each socialist country had the right to determine the concrete form of its development along the path of socialism by taking account of the specific nature of their national conditions… the Soviet Union would not tolerate deviation from the principles of socialism and the restoration of capitalism".&lt;ref name = "Janos"&gt;Janos, Andrew C. East Central Europe in the Modern World: The Politics of the Borderlands From Pre- to Postcommunism, (Stanford, 2000), pp. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was a regime that was far less authoritarian than other Communist regimes—and certainly less so than the first seven years of undisguised Communist rule in Hungary. Generally, Hungarians had much more freedom to speak, write and travel than their counterparts in the Soviet bloc. For instance, [[samizdat]] publications were tolerated to some extent, and conversations with foreigners did not attract much official scrutiny. However, while Kádár's regime was somewhat more humane than most of its counterparts, it was not a liberal one either. The Communist Party still retained a monopoly of power, with the [[National Assembly of Hungary|National Assembly]] being little more than a rubber stamp for decisions already made by the MSZMP and its Politburo. While having somewhat more latitude than in other Communist regimes, the media were still subjected to fairly onerous restrictions.  The secret police operated with somewhat more restraint than in other Communist states, but were still a feared tool of control.

== Economy ==
Hungary's economic resources were mobilized to better satisfy consumer demand by providing a more extensive assortment of [[good (economics and accounting)|consumer goods]]. Some economic reform measures were introduced to integrate limited market mechanisms into the framework of the planned [[socialist economy]]. An unfortunate result of this policy were rising economic stresses and high indebtedness which became evident by the late 1980s. Yet these economic crises were prevalent throughout the collapsing communist world. Hungary's mild diversity left it slightly better equipped.

Being a comparatively well-off country in the Eastern bloc, Hungary was the destination for tourists from other communist nations for whom visits to the West were much more difficult.

== Transition to capitalism ==
Since 1989 and after the general disintegration of communist control in [[Central Europe]], [[Hungary]] has adopted a Western-style multiparty political system and introduced thorough reforms aimed at establishing a capitalist market economy, enabling [[European Union]] membership and integration into a global market economy.

He was a follower of [[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and introduced Husserlian phenomenology to Russia, modifying the phenomenology which he found in Husserl.

As a thinker, he was thoroughly grounded in Russian [[religious]] thought of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. His philosophy combined Husserl's analysis of the structure of consciousness with [[Platonism]] of [[Orthodoxy]], the doctrine of [[incarnation]], and veneration of matter.

In 1921 he founded the [[Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute of Scientific Philosophy]] in [[Moscow]]

He was executed in 1937 during the [[Great Purge]].

The '''Hawu''' also known as '''Havu''' language, historically '''Sawu''' and known to outsiders as '''Savu''' or '''Sabu''' (thus '''Havunese, Savunese, Sawunese'''), is the language of [[Savu Island]] in Indonesia and of [[Raijua Island]] off the western tip of Savu. Traditionally classified as a [[Sumba languages|Sumba language]] in the Austronesian family, it may be a non-Austronesian ([[Papuan languages|Papuan]]) language. (See [[Savu languages]] for details.) [[Dhao language|Dhao]], once considered a dialect, is not [[mutually intelligible]] with Hawu.

The following description is based on Walker (1982) and Grimes (2006).&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Alan T. 1982. ''A Grammar of Sawu.'' NUSA Linguistic Studies in Indonesian and Languages of Indonesia. Vol. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, Charles E. 2006. "[http://www.sil.org/asia/philippines/ical/papers/Grimes-Hawu_Dhao.pdf Hawu and Dhao in eastern Indonesia: revisiting their relationship]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
Seba dialect is dominant, covering most of Savu Island and the main city of [[Seba, Indonesia|Seba]]. Timu is spoken on the eastern, Mesara on the western, and Liae on the southern tip of the island. Raijua is spoken on the island of the same name (''Rai Jua'' 'Jua Island') just off-shore to the west.

==Phonology==
Hawu shares [[implosive consonant|implosive]] (or perhaps [[Pre-glottalization|pre-glottalized]]) consonants with the [[Bima–Sumba languages]] and languages of [[Sumba–Flores languages|Flores]] and [[Celebic languages|Sulawesi]], such [[Wolio language|Wolio]].

Hawu *s, attested during the [[The Portuguese in Indonesia|Portuguese colonial era]], has shifted to {{IPA|/h/}}, a change that has not happened in Dhao. The Hawu consonant inventory is smaller than Dhao:

{| class="wikitable IPA"
!Lab.!!Apic.!!Lam.!!Vel.!!Glot.
|-
|m||n||ɲ||ŋ||
|-
|p||t|| ||k||ʔ
|-
|b||d||dʒ||ɡ||
|-
|ɓ||ɗ||ʄ||ɠ||
|-
|v~β|| || || ||h
|-
| ||l, r||(j)|| 
|}
Consonants of the {{IPA|/n/}} column are [[apical consonant|apical]], those of the {{IPA|/ɲ/}} column [[laminal consonant|laminal]]. The implosives are written {{angle bracket|b', d', j', g'}}. {{angle bracket|w}} is pronounced {{IPA|[v]}} or {{IPA|[β]}}. A wye sound {{IPA|/j/}} (written {{angle bracket|y}}) is found at the beginning of some words in Seba dialect where Dimu and Raijua dialects have {{IPA|/ʄ/}}.

Vowels are {{IPA|/i u e ə o a/}}, with {{IPA|/ə/}} written {{angle bracket|è}}. Phonetic long vowels and diphthongs are vowel sequences. The penultimate syllable/vowel is stressed. (Every vowel constitutes a syllable.) A stressed schwa lengthens the following consonant:

{{IPA|/ŋa/ [ŋa]}} 'with', {{IPA|/niŋaa/ [niˈŋaː]}} 'what?', {{IPA|/ŋaʔa/ [ˈŋaʔa]}} 'eat, food', {{IPA|/ŋali/ [ˈŋali]}} 'senile', {{IPA|/ŋəlu/ [ˈŋəlːu]}} 'wind'.

Syllables are consonant-vowel or vowel-only.

==Grammar==
Hawu appears to be an [[ergative–absolutive language]] with ergative preposition ''ri'' (Seba dialect), ''ro'' (Dimu), or ''li'' (Raijua). Clauses are [[verb-initial]], with intransitive VS and transitive VOA. Within noun phrases, modifiers usually follow the noun, though there are some possibly lexicalized exceptions, such as ''ae dəu'' 'many people' (compare Dhao ''{{IPA|ɖʐəu ae}}'' 'people many').

Many transitive verbs have a special form to indicate singular number of the [[object (grammar)|object]], by replacing the final vowel of the verb with "-e" (e.g.  ''ɓudʒu'' 'touch them', ''ɓudʒe'' 'touch it') or "-o" (''bəlu, bəlo'' 'to forget').

Apart from this, and unlike in Dhao, all pronominal reference uses independent pronouns. These are:

{|class="wikitable IPA"
|-
!rowspan=2|I
|rowspan=2|&lt;small&gt;Seba:&lt;/small&gt; jaa &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;Dimu:&lt;/small&gt; ʄaa &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;Raijua:&lt;/small&gt; ʄaa, dʒoo
!we ([[clusivity|incl]])
|dii
|-
!we ([[clusivity|excl]])
|ʄii
|-
!you (sg.)
|əu, au, ou
!you (pl.)
|muu
|-
!s/he
|noo
!they
|roo &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;Raijua:&lt;/small&gt; naa
|}

The demonstratives are complex and poorly understood. There may be number (see Walker  1982), but it is not confirmed by Grimes. 
{|class="wikitable IPA"
|-
!just this
|ɗii
|-
!this
|nee
|-
!the
|əne, ne
|-
!that
|nəi
|-
!yon
|nii
|}
These can be made locative (here, now, there, then, yonder) by preceding the ''n'' forms with ''na''; the neutral form ''na əne'' optionally contracting to ''nəne''. 'Like this/that' is marked with ''mi'' or ''mi na'', with the ''n'' becoming ''h'' and the neutral ''əne'' form appearing irregularly as ''mi (na) həre''.

Sample clauses (Grimes 2006). (Compare the Dhao equivalents at [[Dhao language#Grammar]].)

:{|class="wikitable IPA"
|''ta ||''nəru ||''ke ||''Simo ||''oro ||''ŋidi ||''dahi.
|-
|[[nonpast|{{sc|npst}}]]?||walk||?||(name)||along||edge||sea

==Early life and career==
Born on 1 June 1855 in Igbein, [[Abeokuta]], [[Ogun State]], to an [[Egba people|Egba]] family, Josiah Ransome-Kuti was baptized in 1859. He enrolled as a student into the Church Missionary Society Training Institution, Abeokuta, before proceeding to the Church Missionary Society Training Institute, [[Lagos State|Lagos]] in 1871.&lt;ref name=dacb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dacb.org/stories/nigeria/ransome-kuti_josiah.html|title=Ransome-Kuti, Josiah Jesse|work=Dictionary of African Christian Biography|date=|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after completing his education at the Church Missionary Society Training Institute, Lagos, Ransome-Kuti was employed as a teacher at St. Peter's School, Ake, Abeokuta, and then left in 1879 to teach music at the CMS Girls School, Lagos, where he met his wife Bertha Anny Erinade Olubi.&lt;ref name=dacb/&gt; In 1891, he was made [[catechist]] at the Gbagura Church Parsonage, Abeokuta before he founded Gbagura Church, a local church where he converted people to the Christian faith through his versatility in rendering [[English language|English]] gospel hymns into indigenous gospel songs.&lt;ref name=dacb/&gt;&lt;ref name="UwechueLimited1991"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Raph Uwechue|author2=Africa Books Limited|title=Makers of Modern Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkEOAQAAMAAJ|year=1991|publisher=Africa Journal Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ransome-Kuti became a deacon in 1895, ordained a priest in 1897 and was appointed district judge from 1902 to 1906.&lt;ref name=dacb/&gt; In 1911, he was appointed pastor of St. Peter's Cathedral Church, Ake after previously serving as superintendent of the Abeokuta Church Mission.&lt;ref&gt;H. Zell, C. H. Bundy and V. Coulon (eds), ''A New Reader's Guide to African Literature'', rev. edn, (London : Heinemann, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kaliram Medhi''' ({{lang-as|কালিৰাম মেধি}}; October 18, 1880 &amp;ndash; January 24, 1954) was a prominent writer and essayist from [[Assam]] who wrote in both the Assamese and English languages in the early part of modern [[Assamese literature]]. He was the third president of the [[Asom Sahitya Sabha]] in 1919 held at [[Barpeta district|Barpeta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TI Trade |url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/details.asp?id=oct2209/City3 |title=Birth anniversary of Pandit Kaliram Medhi observed |publisher=Assamtribune.com |date=2009-10-22 |accessdate=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vedanti.com/News/assam_sahitya_sabha_is_the_forem.htm |title=Assam Sahitya Sabha is the foremost and the most popular organization of Assam |publisher=Vedanti.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926194342/http://www.vedanti.com/News/assam_sahitya_sabha_is_the_forem.htm |archivedate=September 26, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was honoured with the Rai Bahadur title in 1946.

==Early life==
Medhi was born on 18 October 1880 at Ramdia village near [[Hajo]] of [[Kamrup district]] to Bhukali Medhi and Sontara Medhi. After primary education at his village he did his higher education at [[Guwahati]] and City College of Calcutta. In 1897 Medhi passed the entrance examination from Guwahati Government Seminary securing highest marks in Sanskrit. He obtained the Eliotee Scholarship amounting to Rs 20 constituted by Charles Eliot, chief commissioner of Assam. Medhi passed FA in 1899 and BA with honours in [[chemistry]] and [[physical science]] in 1902. Within a year, Medhi passed his MA in physics (natural and physical science) and thus became the third Assamese after [[Radhanath Phukan]] and [[Annada Charan Bhattacharyya]] to obtain an MA degree from [[Calcutta University]].&lt;ref name="assamtribune1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. G.

==Career==
After returning home, the government offered him the post of SDC{{Clarify|date=January 2014|reason=What do SDC, EAC and SDO stand for?}} at Guwahati in 1904. After serving in various capacities like assistant settlement officer of [[Dibrugarh]], SDC of [[Nagaon]] and [[Dhing]], EAC of [[Tura, India|Tura]], [[Goalpara]], [[Golaghat]], SDO (civil) of [[Mangaldoi]] and Goalpara, Medhi became the [[deputy commissioner]] of Nagaon in 1936 and then he went on superannuation. The [[Government of Assam]] re-employed him as special magistrate for about ten years. He retired from active government service finally on 1 January 1946. He died in [[Panbazar]], Guwahati on 24 January 1954.&lt;ref name="assamtribune1"/&gt; His son Surendra Nath Medhi (1930-2011) became a famous Assamese writer under the pseudonym [[Saurabh Kumar Chaliha]] and was awarded [[List of Sahitya Akademi Award winners for Assamese|Sahitya Academy Award in Assamese]] in 1974.

'''Khams Tibetan''' ({{bo|w=Khams skad|s=Khamké}}) is the [[Tibetic languages|Tibetic language]] used by the majority of the people in [[Kham]], which is now divided between the eastern part of [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], the southern part of Qinghai, the western part of [[Sichuan]], and the northwestern part of [[Yunnan]], China. It is one of the six main spoken Tibetic languages, the other four being [[Central Tibetan language]], [[Amdo Tibetan|Amdo]], [[Ladakhi language|Ladakhi]] , [[Dzongkha]] and [[Balti language|Balti]]. These Tibetic languages share the same written script, but their pronunciations, vocabularies and grammars are different. These differences may have emerged due to geographical isolation of the regions of Tibet. Khams Tibetan is used alongside [[Standard Tibetan]] and Amdo Tibetan in broadcasting. Khams Tibetan is not [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with other Tibetic languages.

Like Central Tibetan, Khams Tibetan is a tonal language.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Khampa Tibetan is also spoken by about 1,000 people in two enclaves in eastern [[Bhutan]], the descendants of pastoral yak-herding communities.&lt;ref name=vanDriem93&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repository.forcedmigration.org/pdf/?pid=fmo:3003 |format=PDF |last=van Driem |first=George L. |authorlink=George van Driem |title=Language Policy in Bhutan |publisher=[[School of Oriental and African Studies|SOAS]] |location=[[London]] |year=1993 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
There are five dialects of Khams Tibetan proper:

* '''Central Khams''', spoken in [[Dêgê County]] and [[Chamdo]]
* '''Southern Khams''', spoken in the [[Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]]. There are several subdialects due to the mountainous terrain, as well as contact with neighboring language communities for trade.
* '''Northern''' or '''Northeastern Khams''', spoken in [[Nangqên County]] and [[Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]]
* '''Eastern Khams''', spoken in [[Kangding]]
* '''''Hor''''', or '''Western Khams''', spoken in [[Nagqu Prefecture]]
* The [[Gêrzê County|Gêrzê]] dialect is sometimes considered '''Western Khams'''

These have relatively low mutual intelligibility, but are close enough that they are usually considered a single language.  Khamba and [[Tseku language|Tseku]] are more divergent, but classified with Khams by Tournadre (2013).  

Several other languages are spoken by Tibetans in the Khams region: [[Dongwang Tibetan language]] and the [[Rgyalrong languages]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Tournadre (2005) "L'aire linguistique tibétaine et ses divers dialectes." ''Lalies'', 2005, n°25, p.&amp;nbsp;7–56 [http://tournadre.nicolas.free.fr/fichiers/2005-aire.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The phonologies and vocabularies of the Bodgrong, Dartsendo, dGudzong, Khyungpo (Khromtshang), Lhagang Rangakha, Sangdam, Sogpho, sKobsteng, sPomtserag, Tsharethong, and Yangthang dialects of Kham Tibetan have been documented by Hiroyuki Suzuki.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aa.tufs.ac.jp/en/publications/aall ''Asian and African Languages and Linguistics'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Literary nominalism''' is a paradigm of thought that is interested in the interconnections between certain aspects of [[nominalist]] philosophy and theology and works of literature.

==History of the term==
While the presence of nominalist ideas in fiction and poetry has been discussed by scholars at least since the nineteenth century, the paradigm was first consolidated in 1985 in an essay by Joseph Quack who called the German modernist writer [[Alfred Andersch]] a "literary nominalist".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Quack, "Alfred Andersch: Ein literarischer Nominalist,” ''Neue Deutsche Hefte'' 32.4 (1985), 717–32.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Richard Utz applied the paradigm to [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'', claiming that the medieval English writer might show correspondences with the wave of anti-realist/nominalist thought engendered by [[William of Ockham]] and his intellectual contemporaries and successors, and coining the paradigm "literary nominalism" in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Utz, ''Literarischer Nominalismus im Spätmittelalter. Eine Untersuchung zu Sprache, Charakterzeichnung und Struktur in Geoffrey Chaucers Troilus and Criseyde'' (Frankfurt: Lang, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 1990s, various scholars have added their voices to the discussion of the paradigm, either to confirm or critique its value for literary studies. Various other terms, especially [[Ockhamism]], have also been used especially in claims for the influence of [[William of Ockham]] on individual writers and their works.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Ruth Andretta, ''Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde: A Poet's Response to Ockhamism'' (New York: Lang, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Quack and Utz, [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel, ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' (1980; English translation in 1983), had rekindled interest in the conflict between late medieval [[nominalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]]. Eco's playful and ironic confrontation of both movements of thought questioned the somewhat simplistic separation present in mainstream histories of philosophy and theology.&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Coletti. ''Naming the Rose: Eco, Medieval Signs, and Modern Theory''. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main features==
Among the specific features writers of [[nominalism]] writers have found attractive for their practices are:

*the construction of a narrative that centers on the ontological status of universals and particulars (with a preference for the latter);
*the focus on the radical contingency of language (confirming that there is nothing except names);
*the challenging of allegorical (hence: [[Neoplatonic]] 'realist') forms of narrative, character, and argument;
*the experimentation with non-conclusive, contingent, indeterminate, and fragmentary poetic structures;
*the likening of the relationship between the God's absolute and ordinate powers on the one hand, and God and humanity, rulers, subjects, and authors on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Utz, "Literary Nominalism," in: ''Oxford Dictionary of the Middle Ages'', ed. Robert Bjork (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most discussions of literary nominalism center on the late medieval period and early modern periods, when many of the epistemological foundations of Neoplatonic [[Philosophical realism|realism]] were challenged. The majority of such discussions of literary nominalism have centered on the works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]],&lt;ref&gt;William H. Watts and Richard J. Utz, "Nominalist Influence on Chaucer's Poetry: A Bibliographical Essay," ''Medievalia &amp; Humanistica'' 20 n.s. (1993), 147–73&lt;/ref&gt; but also included [[Jean Molinet]],&lt;ref&gt;Randall, Michael.

'''Lyngam''' is an [[Austroasiatic]] language of [[Northeast India]] closely related to [[Khasi language|Khasi]]. Once listed as a dialect of [[Khasi language|Khasi]], Lyngam has in recent literature been classified as a distinct language. Lyngam speakers have food and dress similar to the neighboring [[Garo people|Garo]] people.

==Phonology==

===Consonant inventory===
The following table lists the consonants attested in Lyngam.&lt;ref name="nagaraj sect1"&gt;{{harvnb|Nagaraja|1996|loc = sect. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difference with the Khasi language is that Lyngngam does not possess the voiced aspirated series. Furthermore, Lyngngam does not have the phoneme {{IPA|/ç/}}. Words which have {{IPA|/ç/}} in Khasi typically have {{IPA|/c/}} or {{IPA|/s/}} in Lyngngam,&lt;ref name="nagaraj sect 2"&gt;{{harvnb|Nagaraja|1996|loc = sect. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in the following pairs of [[cognate]]s:

===Vowel inventory===
The following table lists the vowel inventory of the language.&lt;ref name="nagaraj sect1" /&gt; The only vowels showing a length distinction are {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/a/}}, in contradistinction to Khasi, where length is distinctive for all vowels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2396">'''MacSpeech Scribe''' is speech recognition software for Mac OS X designed specifically for transcription of recorded voice dictation. It runs on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. The software transcribes dictation recorded by an individual speaker. Typically the speaker will record their dictation using a digital recording device such as a handheld digital recorder, mobile smartphone (e.g. iPhone), or desktop or laptop computer with a suitable microphone. MacSpeech Scribe supports specific audio file formats for recorded dictation: .aif, .aiff, .wav, .mp4, .m4a, and .m4v.

MacSpeech Scribe was originally developed by [[MacSpeech]], Inc. and released February 11, 2010 at Macworld Expo in San Francisco. The product is now owned by [[Nuance Communications]] which acquired MacSpeech on February 16, 2010. Nuance is the developer of other speech recognition products including Dragon [[NaturallySpeaking]] for Windows, [[DragonDictate|Dragon Dictate for Mac]] (formerly "[[MacSpeech Dictate]]"), and Dragon Dictation apps for iOS.

Jeffery Battersby of Macworld noted in his September 2010 review &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Battersby |first=Jeffery |url=http://www.macworld.com/reviews/product/664604/review/scribe_11.html |title=MacSpeech Scribe 1.1 |website=Macworld.com |date=2010-09-08 |accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; of MacSpeech Scribe v1.1:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Small foibles aside, MacSpeech Scribe is a powerful and intelligent tool for transcribing your recorded speech. A simple training process and access to a wide variety of standard audio formats mean that you’ll be moving your spoken text to the printed page in a matter of minutes and with a minimum of hassle. Scribe is the best, simplest way for you to get your spoken word to the printed page.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Malaysian language''' ({{lang-ms|bahasa Malaysia}}; [[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: بهاس مليسيا‎) or '''Malaysian Malay''' ({{lang-ms|bahasa Melayu Malaysia|link=no}}) is the name regularly applied to the [[Malay language]] used in Malaysia. Constitutionally, however, the official language of Malaysia is Malay, but the government from time to time refers to it as Malaysian. Standard Malaysian is a [[standard language|normative]] [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] of the [[Malacca Sultanate|Johore-Riau]] dialect of [[Malay language|Malay]]. It is spoken by much of the Malaysian population, although most learn a vernacular form of Malay or other native language first.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; Malay is a compulsory subject in primary and secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Education: [http://www.moe.gov.my/v/soalan-lazim-view?id=150&amp;cat=28&amp;keyword=&amp;page=1&amp; Frequently Asked Questions — To uphold Bahasa Malaysia and to strengthen the English language (MBMMBI)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911045614/http://www.moe.gov.my/v/soalan-lazim-view?id=150&amp;cat=28&amp;keyword=&amp;page=1&amp; |date=11 September 2014 }}; access date 3 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
[[Constitution of Malaysia#Article 152|Article 152]] of the Federation designates Malay as the official language. Between 1986 and 2007, the official term ''Bahasa Malaysia'' was replaced by "''Bahasa Melayu''". Today, to recognise that [[Malaysia]] is composed of many ethnic groups (and not only the ethnic Malays), the term ''Bahasa Malaysia'' has once again become the government's preferred designation for the "''Bahasa Kebangsaan''" (National Language) and the "''Bahasa Persatuan/Pemersatu''" ([[lingua franca|unifying language/lingua franca]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/6/4/nation/17923478&amp;sec=nation Back to Bahasa Malaysia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503222753/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F6%2F4%2Fnation%2F17923478&amp;sec=nation |date=3 May 2011 }}. Thestar.com.my (4 June 2007). Retrieved on 19 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The language is sometimes simply referred to as ''BM'' and often misnomered with the term ''Bahasa''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/bm/news.php?id=294230 Penggunaan Istilah Bahasa Malaysia Dan Bukan Bahasa Melayu Muktamad, Kata Zainuddin]. BERNAMA, 5 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[English language|English]] continues, however, to be widely used in professional and commercial fields and in the superior courts.

==Writing system==
{{Main article|Malay alphabet}}

The Malaysian language is normally written using a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] called Rumi, though an [[Arabic script|Arabic alphabet]] called [[Jawi script|Jawi]] also exists. Rumi is official while {{citation needed span|date=July 2018|text=efforts are currently being undertaken to preserve Jawi script and to revive its use in Malaysia}}. The Latin alphabet, however, is still the most commonly used script in Malaysia, both for official and informal purposes.

==Borrowed words==
{{Main article|List of loanwords in Malay}}
The Malaysian language has most of its borrowings absorbed from [[Sanskrit]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], Dutch, [[Chinese language|Sinitic languages]], Arabic and more recently, English (in particular many scientific and technological terms).
Modern Malaysian Malay has also been influenced lexically by the [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] variety, largely through the popularity of Indonesian dramas, soap operas, and music.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A9UjLYD9jVEC&amp;pg=PA157 Sneddon, James N. "The Indonesian Language: its history and role in modern society"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colloquial and contemporary usage==
{{Main article|Bahasa Rojak}}

Colloquial and contemporary usage of Malay includes modern Malaysian vocabulary, which may not be familiar to the older generation, such as ''awek'' (girl), ''balak'' (guy) or  ''cun'' (pretty). New plural pronouns have also been formed out of the original pronouns and the word ''orang'' (person), such as ''kitorang'' (''kita'' + ''orang'', the [[Clusivity|exclusive]] "we", in place of ''kami'') or ''diorang'' (''dia'' + ''orang'', "they"). Code-switching between English and Malaysian and the use of novel loanwords is widespread, forming [[Bahasa Rojak]]. Consequently, this phenomenon has raised the displeasure of [[Linguistic prescription|language purists]] in Malaysia, in their effort to uphold use of the prescribed normative language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3513">In [[mathematics]], the '''Markus–Yamabe conjecture''' is a [[conjecture]] on global [[asymptotic stability]]. The conjecture states that if a [[Smooth function|continuously differentiable]] map on an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Real number|real]] [[vector space]] has a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]], and its [[Jacobian matrix]] is everywhere [[Hurwitz matrix|Hurwitz]], then the fixed point is globally stable.

The conjecture is true for the two-dimensional case. However, counterexamples have been constructed in higher dimensions. Hence, in the two-dimensional case ''only'', it can also be referred to as the '''Markus–Yamabe theorem'''.

Related mathematical results concerning global asymptotic stability, which ''are'' applicable in dimensions higher than two, include various [[autonomous convergence theorem]]s. Analog of the conjecture for nonlinear control system with scalar nonlinearity is known as [[Kalman's conjecture]].

== Mathematical statement of conjecture ==
:Let &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt; map with &lt;math&gt;f(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and Jacobian &lt;math&gt;Df(x)&lt;/math&gt; which is Hurwitz stable for every &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.
:Then &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is a global attractor of the dynamical system &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}= f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

The conjecture is true for &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt; and false in general for &lt;math&gt;n&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20537">'''Modularity of mind''' is the notion that a [[mind]] may, at least in part, be composed of innate neural structures or modules which have distinct established [[evolution]]arily developed functions. Somewhat different definitions of "module" have been proposed by different authors.

==Early investigations==
Historically, questions regarding the ''functional architecture'' of the mind have been divided into two different theories of the nature of the faculties. The first can be characterized as a horizontal view because it refers to mental processes as if they are interactions between faculties such as memory, imagination, judgement, and perception, which are not [[domain specificity|domain specific]] (e.g., a judgement remains a judgement whether it refers to a perceptual experience or to the conceptualization/comprehension process). The second can be characterized as a vertical view because it claims that the mental faculties are differentiated on the basis of domain specificity, are genetically determined, are associated with distinct neurological structures, and are computationally autonomous.

The vertical vision goes back to the 19th century movement called [[phrenology]] and its founder [[Franz Joseph Gall]], who claimed that the individual mental faculties could be associated precisely, in a sort of one-to-one correspondence, with specific physical areas of the brain. Hence, someone's level of intelligence, for example, could be literally "read off" from the size of a particular bump on his posterior parietal lobe. This simplistic view of modularity has been disproven over the course of the last century.

==Fodor's ''Modularity of Mind''==
In the 1980s, however, [[Jerry Fodor]] revived the idea of the modularity of mind, although without the notion of precise physical localizability. Drawing from [[Noam Chomsky]]'s idea of the [[language acquisition device]] and other work in [[linguistics]] as well as from the [[philosophy of mind]] and the implications of [[optical illusion]]s, he became a major proponent of the idea with the 1983 publication of ''Modularity of Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, Jerry A. (1983). ''Modularity of Mind: An Essay on Faculty Psychology''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-56025-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fodor, a module falls somewhere between the behaviorist and cognitivist views of lower-level processes.

[[Behaviorism|Behaviorists]] tried to replace the mind with reflexes which Fodor describes as encapsulated (cognitively impenetrable or unaffected by other cognitive domains) and non-inferential (straight pathways with no information added). Low level processes are unlike reflexes in that they are inferential. This can be demonstrated by [[argument from poverty of the stimulus|poverty of the stimulus]] arguments in which the proximate stimulus, that which is initially received by the brain (such as the 2D image received by the retina), cannot account for the resulting output (for example, our 3D perception of the world), thus necessitating some form of computation.

In contrast, [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivists]] saw lower level processes as continuous with higher level processes, being inferential and cognitively penetrable (influenced by other cognitive domains, such as beliefs). The latter has been shown to be untrue in some cases, such as with many visual illusions (ex. [[Müller-Lyer illusion]]), which can persist despite a person's awareness of their existence. This is taken to indicate that other domains, including one's beliefs, cannot influence such processes.

Fodor arrives at the conclusion that such processes are inferential like higher order processes and encapsulated in the same sense as reflexes.

Although he argued for the modularity of "lower level" cognitive processes in ''Modularity of Mind'' he also argued that higher level cognitive processes are not modular since they have dissimilar properties. ''The Mind Doesn't Work That Way'', a reaction to [[Steven Pinker]]'s ''[[How the Mind Works]]'', is devoted to this subject.

Fodor (1983) states that modular systems must—at least to "some interesting extent"—fulfill certain properties:
# Domain specificity: modules only operate on certain kinds of inputs—they are specialised
# Informational encapsulation: modules need not refer to other psychological systems in order to operate
# Obligatory firing: modules process in a mandatory manner
# Fast speed: probably due to the fact that they are encapsulated (thereby needing only to consult a restricted database) and mandatory (time need not be wasted in determining whether or not to process incoming input)
# Shallow outputs: the output of modules is very simple
# Limited accessibility
# Characteristic [[ontogeny]]: there is a regularity of development
# Fixed neural architecture.

Pylyshyn (1999) has argued that while these properties tend to occur with modules, one—information encapsulation—stands out as being the real signature of a module; that is the encapsulation of the processes inside the module from both cognitive influence and from cognitive access.&lt;ref&gt;Pylyshyn, Z.W. (1999). Is vision continuous with cognition? The case for cognitive impenetrability of visual perception. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 22(3), 341-423. [http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/ftp/pub/papers/bbs1999_reprint.pdf Full text] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511184911/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/ftp/pub/papers/bbs1999_reprint.pdf |date=2008-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is that conscious awareness of the [[Müller-Lyer illusion]] being an illusion does not correct visual processing.&lt;ref name=FP2007/&gt;

==Evolutionary psychology and massive modularity==
Other perspectives on modularity come from [[evolutionary psychology]], particularly from the work of [[Leda Cosmides]] and [[John Tooby]]. This perspective suggests that modules are units of mental processing that evolved in response to selection pressures. On this view, much modern human psychological activity is rooted in adaptations that occurred earlier in [[human evolution]], when [[natural selection]] was forming the modern human species.

Evolutionary psychologists propose that the mind is made up of genetically influenced and domain-specific&lt;ref&gt;Cosmides, L. &amp; Tooby, J. (1994). Origins of Domain Specificity: The Evolution of Functional Organization. In L.A. Hirschfeld and S.A. Gelmen, eds., Mapping the Mind: Domain Specificity in Cognition and Culture. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Reprinted in R. Cummins and D.D. Cummins, eds., Minds, Brains, and Computers. Oxford: Blackwell, 2000, 523-543.&lt;/ref&gt; mental algorithms or computational modules, designed to solve specific evolutionary problems of the past.&lt;ref&gt;Cosmides, L., &amp; Tooby, J. (1992). Cognitive Adaptations for Social Exchange. In Barkow, Cosmides, and Tooby 1992, 163-228.&lt;/ref&gt; Cosmides and Tooby also state in a brief "primer" on their website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/primer.html |title=Evolutionary Psychology Primer by Leda Cosmides and John Tooby |publisher=Psych.ucsb.edu |date=1997-01-13 |accessdate=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "…the brain is a physical system. It functions like a computer," "…the brain’s function is to process information," "different neural circuits are specialized for solving different adaptive problems," and "our modern skulls house a stone age mind."

The definition of ''module'' has caused confusion and dispute. J. A. Fodor initially  defined module as "functionally specialized cognitive systems" that have nine features but not necessarily all at the same time. In his views modules can be found in peripheral  processing such as low-level visual processing but not in central processing. Later he  narrowed the two essential features to ''domain-specificity'' and ''information  encapsulation''. Frankenhuis and Ploeger&lt;ref name=FP2007/&gt; write that domain-specificity means that "a given cognitive mechanism accepts, or is specialized to operate on, only a specific class of information". Information encapsulation  means that information processing in the module cannot be affected by information in the  rest of the brain. One example is that being aware that a certain optical illusion, caused by low  level processing, is false does not prevent the illusion from persisting.&lt;ref name=FP2007&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Frankenhuis | first1 = W. E. | last2 = Ploeger | first2 = A. | doi = 10.1080/09515080701665904 | title = Evolutionary Psychology Versus Fodor: Arguments for and Against the Massive Modularity Hypothesis | journal = Philosophical Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 687 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists instead usually define modules as functionally specialized  cognitive systems that are domain-specific and may also contain innate knowledge about the  class of information processed. Modules can be found also for central processing. This  theory is sometimes referred to as ''massive modularity.''&lt;ref name=FP2007/&gt;

A 2010 review by evolutionary psychologists Confer et al. suggested that domain general theories, such as for "rationality," has several problems: 1. Evolutionary  theories using the idea of numerous  domain-specific adaptions have produced testable predictions that have been empirically  confirmed; the theory of domain-general rational thought has produced no such predictions  or confirmations. 2. The rapidity of responses such as jealousy due to infidelity indicates  a domain-specific dedicated module rather than a general, deliberate, rational calculation  of consequences. 3. Reactions may occur instinctively (consistent with innate knowledge)  even if a person has not learned such knowledge. One example being that in the ancestral  environment it is unlikely that males during development learn that infidelity (usually  secret) may cause paternal uncertainty (from observing the phenotypes of children born many  months later and making a statistical conclusion from the phenotype dissimilarity to the cuckolded fathers).&lt;ref name=AmPs2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Confer | first1 = J.

Clune et al. (2013) have argued that computer simulations of the evolution of neural nets suggest that modularity evolves because, compared to non-modular networks, connection costs are lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Clune |first1= Jeff |last2= Mouret |first2= Jean-Baptiste |last3= Lipson |first3= Hod |year= 2013 |title= The evolutionary origins of modularity |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society |volume= 280 |issue= 1755 |pages= |publisher= |doi= 10.1098/rspb.2012.2863 |arxiv= 1207.2743|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several groups of critics, including psychologists working within evolutionary frameworks,&lt;ref name="Panksepp, J. 2000"&gt;Panksepp, J. &amp; Panksepp, J. (2000). [http://www.flyfishingdevon.co.uk/salmon/year3/psy364criticisms-evolutionary-psychology/panksepp_seven_sins.pdf The Seven Sins of Evolutionary Psychology. Evolution and Cognition], 6:2, 108-131.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the massively modular theory of mind does little to explain adaptive psychological traits. Proponents of other models of the mind argue that the [[computational theory of mind]] is no better at explaining human behavior than a theory with mind entirely a product of the environment. Even within evolutionary psychology there is discussion about the degree of modularity, either as a few generalist modules or as many highly specific modules.&lt;ref name="Panksepp, J. 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buller, David J. and Valerie Gray Hardcastle (2005) Chapter 4.

Wallace (2010) observes that the evolutionary psychologists' definition of "mind" has been heavily influenced by [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]] and/or [[information processing]] definitions of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, B. (2010). Getting Darwin Wrong: Why Evolutionary Psychology Won’t Work. Exeter, UK: Imprint Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics point out that these assumptions underlying evolutionary psychologists' hypotheses are controversial and have been contested by some psychologists, philosophers, and neuroscientists. For example, [[Jaak Panksepp]], an affective neuroscientist, point to the "remarkable degree of neocortical plasticity within the human brain, especially during development" and states that "the developmental interactions among ancient special-purpose circuits and more recent general-purpose brain mechanisms can generate many of the "modularized" human abilities that evolutionary psychology has entertained."&lt;ref name="Panksepp, J. 2000"/&gt;

Philosopher David Buller agrees with the general argument that the human mind has evolved over time but disagrees with the specific claims evolutionary psychologists make. He has argued that the contention that the mind consists of thousands of modules, including sexually dimorphic jealousy and parental investment modules, are unsupported by the available [[empirical evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Buller |first1= David J. |last2= |first2= |year= 2005 |title= Evolutionary psychology: the emperor's new paradigm |journal= Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume= 9 |issue= 6 |pages= 277–283 |publisher= |doi= 10.1016/j.tics.2005.04.003|url= http://commons.lib.niu.edu/bitstream/10843/13182/1/BullerTiCS%20Reprint.pdf |accessdate=March 23, 2013 |pmid=15925806}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has suggested that the "modules" result from the brain's developmental [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]] and that they are adaptive responses to local conditions, not past evolutionary environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Buller |first1= David J. |last2= Hardcastle |first2= Valerie |year= 2000 |title= Evolutionary Psychology, Meet Developmental Neurobiology: Against Promiscuous Modularity |journal= Brain and Mind |volume= 1 |issue= 3 |pages= 307&amp;ndash;325 |publisher= |doi= 10.1023/A:1011573226794 |url= http://commons.lib.niu.edu/bitstream/10843/13181/1/evolutionarypsych.pdf |accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Buller has also stated that even if massive modularity is false this does not necessarily have broad implications for evolutionary psychology. Evolution may create innate motives even without innate knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Buller |first1= David J. |last2=  |first2=  |year= 2005 |title= Get Over: Massive Modularity |journal= Biology &amp; Philosophy |volume= 20 |issue= 4 |pages= 881–891 |publisher=  |doi= 10.1007/s10539-004-1602-3 |url= http://www.niu.edu/phil/~buller/publications/_pdf/over.pdf |accessdate= March 23, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150317231528/http://www.niu.edu/phil/~buller/publications/_pdf/over.pdf |archive-date= March 17, 2015 |dead-url= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to modular mental structure, some theories posit [[Domain-general learning|domain-general processing]], in which mental activity is distributed across the brain and cannot be decomposed, even abstractly, into independent units. A staunch defender of this view is William Uttal, who argues in ''The New Phrenology'' (2003) that there are serious philosophical, theoretical, and methodological problems with the entire enterprise of trying to localise cognitive processes in the [[brain]].&lt;ref&gt;Uttal, William R. (2003). ''The New Phrenology: The Limits of Localizing Cognitive Processes in the Brain.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this argument is that a successful [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of mental processes has yet to be developed.

Merlin Donald argues that over evolutionary time the mind has gained adaptive advantage from being a general problem solver.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, ''A Mind So Rare: The Evolution of Human Consciousness'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20060620060057/http://psyc.queensu.ca/faculty/donald/book/mindsorare2.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; The mind, as described by Donald, includes module-like "central" mechanisms, in addition to more recently evolved "domain-general" mechanisms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9415">'''Mondial''' is an [[international auxiliary language]] created by the Swedish school principal Helge Heimer, in the 1940s. It received favourable reviews from several academic linguists but achieved little practical success. Grammars and dictionaries were published in Swedish, French, English, Italian, and German.

==Orthography==
Mondial uses 26 letters of the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]], where k and w only occur in proper nouns and loan words &lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/document/93309035/Grammar-of-the-Mondial-language&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==

===Tonic accent===

The tonic accent in Mondial in general falls on the penultimate syllable in words that end in a vowel or s:

* ''am'''i'''co, id'''e'''a, il am'''a'''ra, am'''i'''cos, id'''e'''as, doct'''o'''res''.

on the last syllable in nouns that end with a consonant other than s:

* ''doct'''o'''r, gener'''a'''l, americ'''a'''n''.

A diphthong counts as one syllable:

* ''p'''a'''tria, v'''i'''dua, p'''a'''trias, v'''i'''duas, il am'''a'''ria''.

Exceptions to this show the placing of the tonic accent with an accent:

* ''verit'''á''', caf'''é'''''.

The reflexive, third person singular pronoun (himself, herself, itself) is '''se'''. The pronoun '''su''' means "her own", "his own" or "its own".

Note that the third person singular possessive is the same for both masculine and neuter (''sui''). ''Votre'' can be used as second person singular possessive as a respectful form.&lt;ref name="yoparla"&gt;[https://yoparlamondial.wordpress.com/2009/07/05/parlamo-mondial-le-octeme-lecion-pronomes-personal/ Parlamo Mondial! – Le octeme lecion: “Pronomes personal”] and [https://yoparlamondial.wordpress.com/2009/07/11/parlamo-mondial-le-deceme-lecion-agectives-i-pronomes-posesiv/ Parlamo Mondial! – Le deceme lecion: “Agectives i pronomes posesiv”], read 18th of August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verbs===

Verbs conjugate as follows, using ''savar'' (to know) as an example:

* Infinitive: '''-ar''' (''savar'', to know)
* Present participle: '''-ante''' (''savante'', knowing)
* Past participle: '''-ate''' (''savate'', knew)
* Present: '''-a''' (''yo sava'', I know)
* Imperfect: '''-avi''' (''yo savavi'', I knew)
* Simple future: '''-ara''' (''yo savara'', I will know)
* Present conditional: '''-aria''' (''yo savaria'', I would know)
* Imperative: '''-a''' (''sava!'', know!)
* Imperative plural: '''-amo''' (''savamo!'', let us know!)

Verbs do not conjugate by person: ''yo, tu, il, nu, vu, li sava'' (I, you, he, we, you, they know).

Mondial has a single irregular verb, the verb '''ser''' (to be):

* Infinitive: ''ser'' (to be)
* Present participle: ''sente'' (being)
* Past participle: ''sete'' (been)
* Present: ''e'' (is/am/are)
* Imperfect: ''evi'' (was)
* Simple future: ''sera'' (will be)
* Present conditional: ''seria'' (would be)
* Imperative: ''se!'' (be!)
* Imperative plural: ''semo!'' (let us be!)

The auxiliary verb '''har''' (have) is used in much the same way as English, conjugating in the same way as the above plus the past participle of the main verb:

* ''har savate'' (to have known)
* ''hante savate'' (having known)
* ''yo ha savate'' (I have known) 
* ''yo havi savate'' (I had known)
* ''yo hara savate'' (I will have known)
* ''yo haria savate'' (I would have known)

Passive voice is formed with the auxiliary verb '''var''' and the past participle of the main verb:

* ''yo va savate'' (I am known)
* ''yo vavi savate'' (I was known)
* ''yo ha vate savate'' (I have been known)
* ''yo havi vate savate'' (I had been known)
* ''yo vara savate'' (I will be known)
* ''yo hara vate savate'' (I will have been known)
* ''yo varia savate'' (I would be known)
* ''yo haria vate savate'' (I would have been known)
* ''va savate!'' (be known!)
* ''vamo savate!'' (let us be known!)
* ''var savate'' (to be known)
* ''har vate savate'' (to have been known)
* ''vante savate'' (being known)
* ''hante vate savate'' (having been known)

The verb to be (''ser'') can be used in the same way as var when no ambiguity arises:

* ''Il e / va savate da tutes''
:(He is known by all)

An example of where ''var'' and ''ser'' cannot be used interchangeably:

* ''Le porte va uvrate a tri hores''
: (The door is opened at three o'clock – passive)

* ''Le porte e uvrate a tri hores''
:(The door is open at three o'clock – state of being)

==Sample==
{{quote|Tristan Bernard, le autor humoristique, havi un dia prendate place con un amico in un vagon de primer clase por andar a Versalies. Il alumavi imediatemente un bon cigar, que il comenzavi da fumar con visible satisfacion. Alor un senior entravi i dicavi in un ton iritante a Tristan Bernard da gectar le cigar o da andar in un altere compartimente. Nul response. Le senior inconosate repeta su demande, ma in van. Fuor se de indignacion, il precipita se fuor del compartimente i returna algue momentes dopo con le conductor.

"Cel senior ha nulo da dicar ci", dicavi alor Tristan Bernard, "il ha un biliete de secunde clase, i cil e le primer clase." Confuse i furiose, le pasagero devavi presentar su biliete al conductor i acompaniar lui imediatemente a un compartimente de secunde clase. Cuando li havi andate se, le amico de Tristan Bernard questionavi lui come il havi povate savar que lo evi un biliete de secunde clase.

"Il saliavi del poche de sui gilete", respondavi Tristan Bernard, i yo vidavi que il evi del mem color que le mi."}}

===Translation===
[[Tristan Bernard]], the humorist, one day sat with a friend in a first-class carriage to Versailles.  He immediately lit a good cigar, which he began to smoke with visible satisfaction. Then, a gentleman entered and told Tristan Bernard, in an irritating tone, to put out his cigar or to go to another compartment.  No response. The gentleman, becoming angry, repeated his request, but in vain. Beside himself with indignation, he quickly left the compartment and returned several moments later with the conductor.

"This gentleman has nothing to say here," said Tristan Bernard then; "he has a second-class ticket, and this is first class." Confused and angry, the passenger had to present his ticket to the conductor and accompany him immediately to a second-class compartment.  When they had gone, Tristan Bernard's friend asked him how he could have known that the other passenger had a second-class ticket.

"It came out of his vest pocket," answered Tristan Bernard, "and I saw that it was the same color as mine."

'''O'odham''' (pronounced {{IPA-azc|ˈʔɔʔɔðɦam|}}) or '''Papago-Pima''' is a [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] language of southern [[Arizona]] and northern [[Sonora]], Mexico,  where the [[Tohono O'odham people|Tohono O'odham]] (formerly called the Papago) and [[Pima people|Akimel O'odham]] (traditionally called Pima) reside.&lt;ref&gt;Estrada Fernández, Zarina, and Andrés Oseguera Montiel. "La documentación de la tradición oral entre los pima: el diablo pelea con la luna." Indiana (03418642) 32 (2015). [http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/2470/247043388007.pdf] "El pima bajo es una lengua yutoazteca (yutonahua) de la rama tepimana. Otras tres lenguas de esta rama son el tepehuano del norte, el tepehuano del sur o sureste y el antiguo pápago, actualmente denominado o’otam en Sonora y tohono o’odham y akimel o’odham (pima) en Arizona" &lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 there were estimated to be approximately 9,750 speakers in the United States and Mexico combined, although there may be more due to underreporting.

It is the 10th most-spoken indigenous language in the United States, the 3rd most-spoken indigenous language in Arizona after [[Western Apache language|Western Apache]] and [[Navajo language|Navajo]]. It is the third-most spoken language in [[Pinal County, Arizona]], and the fourth-most spoken language in [[Pima County, Arizona]].

Approximately 8% of O'odham speakers in the US speak English "not well" or "not at all", according to results of the 2000 Census. Approximately 13% of O'odham speakers in the US were between the ages of 5 and 17, and among the younger O'odham speakers, approximately 4% were reported as speaking English "not well" or "not at all".

Native names for the language, depending on the dialect and orthography, include ''Oʼodham ha-ñeʼokĭ'', ''Oʼottham ha-neoki'', and ''Oʼodham ñiok''.

==Dialects==
The O'dham language has a number of dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Saxton, Dean, Saxton, Lucille, &amp; Enos, Susie. (1983). ''Dictionary: Tohono O'odham/Pima to English, English to Tohono O'odham/Pima''. Tucson, AZ: The University of Arizona Press&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tohono O'odham dialects|Tohono O'odham]]
** [[Cukuḍ Kuk dialect|Cukuḍ Kuk]]
** [[Gigimai dialect|Gigimai]]
** [[Huhuʼula dialect|Hu:huʼula]]
** [[Huhuwoṣ dialect|Huhuwoṣ]]
** [[Totoguañ dialect|Totoguañ]]
* [[Akimel O'odham dialects|Akimel O'odham]]
** [[Eastern Gila dialect|Eastern Gila]]
** [[Kohadk dialect|Kohadk]]
** [[Salt River dialect|Salt River]]
** [[Western Gila dialect|Western Gila]]
* [[Hia C-ed O'odham dialects|Hia C-ed O'odham]]
** ?

Due to the paucity of data on the linguistic varieties of the [[Hia C-eḍ O'odham]], this section currently focuses on the Tohono O'odham and Akimel O'odham dialects only.

The greatest [[Lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] and [[grammatical]] dialectal differences are between the Tohono O'odham (or Papago) and the Akimel O'odham (or Pima) dialect groupings. Some examples:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Tohono O'odham
! Akimel O'odham
! English
|-
| ʼaʼad
| hotṣ
| to send
|-
| ñeñida
| tamiam
| to wait for
|-
| s-hewhogĭ
| s-heubagĭ
| to be cool
|-
| sisiṣ
| hoʼiumi ''(but ''si:ṣpakuḍ'', stapler)''
| to fasten
|-
| pi: haʼicug
| pi ʼac
| to be absent
|-
| wia
| ʼoʼoid
| hunt ''tr.''
|}

There are other major dialectal differences between northern and southern dialects, for example:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Early O'odham
! Southern
! Northern
! English
|-
| *''ʼa:phi:m''
| ʼa:ham
| ʼa:pim

|-
| *''cu:khug''
| cu:hug
| cu:kug

|-
| *''ʼe:kheg''
| ʼe:heg
| ʼe:keg
| to be shaded
|-
| *''ʼu:pham''
| ʼu:hum
| ʼu:pam
| (go) back
|}

The Cukuḍ Kuk dialect has null in certain positions where other Tohono O'odham dialects have a bilabial:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Other TO dialects
! Chukuḍ Kuk
! English
|-
| jiwia, jiwa
| jiia

|-
| ʼuʼuwhig
| ʼuʼuhig
| bird
|-
| wabṣ
| haṣ
| only
|-
| wabṣaba, ṣaba
| haṣaba
| but
|}

==Morphology==
O'odham is an [[agglutinative]] language, where words use suffix complexes for a variety of purposes with several [[morpheme]]s strung together.

==Phonology==
''For clarity, note that the terms '''Tohono O'odham''' and '''Papago''' refer to the same language; likewise for '''Akimel O'odham''' and '''Pima'''.''
O'odham phonology has a typical Uto-Aztecan inventory distinguishing 21 consonants and 5 vowels.&lt;ref&gt;Saxton, Dean. (1963). Papago Phonemes. ''International Journal of American Linguistics, 29'', 29–35&lt;/ref&gt;

The retroflex consonants are [[apical consonant|apical]] [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]].

===Vowels===

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! !! [[Front vowel|Front]] !! [[Central vowel|Central]] !! [[Back vowel|Back]]
|-
! [[High vowel|High]]
| {{IPA|i}} iː || {{IPA|ɨ}} ɨː || {{IPA|ʊ}} uː
|-
! [[Mid vowel|Mid]]
| || {{IPA|ə}} || {{IPA|ɔ}} ɔː
|-
! [[Low vowel|Low]]
| || {{IPA|a}} aː||
|}

Most vowels distinguish two degrees of length: long and short, and some vowels also show [[extra-short]] duration (voicelessness).

* ṣe:l {{IPA|/ʂɨːɭ/}} "[[Seri people|Seri]]"
* ṣel {{IPA|/ʂɨɭ/}} "permission"
* ʼa:pi {{IPA|/ʔaːpi/}} "you"
* da:pĭ {{IPA|/daːpɪ̥/}} "I don't know", "who knows?"

Papago {{IPA|/ɨ/}} is pronounced {{IPA|/ʌ/}} in Pima.

Additionally, in common with many northern Uto-Aztecan languages, vowels and nasals at end of words are [[devoiced]]. Also, a short [[schwa]] sound, either voiced or unvoiced depending on position, is often interpolated between consonants and at the ends of words.

===Allophony and distribution===

* {{IPA|/ĭ/}} is realized as {{IPA|[i̥]}}, and devoices preceding obstruents: cuwĭ {{IPA|/tʃʊwĭ/}} → {{IPA|[tʃʊʍi̥]~[tʃʊʍʲ]}} "jackrabbit".
* {{IPA|/w/}} is a fricative {{IPA|[β]}} before unrounded vowels: wisilo {{IPA|[βisiɭɔ]}}.
* {{IPA|[ŋ]}} appears before {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} in Spanish loanwords, but native words do not have nasal assimilation: to:nk {{IPA|[toːnk]}} "hill", namk {{IPA|[namk]}} "meet", ca:ŋgo {{IPA|[tʃaːŋɡo]}} "monkey". {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/ɭ/}}, and {{IPA|/ɖ/}} rarely occur initially in native words, and {{IPA|/ɖ/}} does not occur before {{IPA|/i/}}.
* {{IPA|[ɲ]}} and {{IPA|[n]}} are largely in complementary distribution, {{IPA|[ɲ]}} appearing before high vowels {{IPA|/i/ /ɨ/ /ʊ/}}, {{IPA|[n]}} appearing before low vowels {{IPA|/a/ /ɔ/}}: ñeʼe "sing". They contrast finally (ʼañ (1st imperfective auxiliary) vs. an "next to speaker"), though Saxton analyzes these as {{IPA|/ani/}} and {{IPA|/an/}}, respectively, and final {{IPA|[ɲi]}} as in ʼa:ñi as {{IPA|/niː/}}. However, there are several Spanish loanwords where {{IPA|[nu]}} occurs: nu:milo "number". Similarly, for the most part {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[d]}} appear before low vowels while {{IPA|[tʃ]}} and {{IPA|[dʒ]}} before high vowels, but there are exceptions to both, often in Spanish loanwords: tiki:la ("tequila") "wine", TO weco / AO veco ("[de]bajo") "under".

==Orthography==

There are two orthographies commonly used for the O'odham language: Alvarez–Hale and Saxton. The Alvarez–Hale orthography is officially used by the [[Tohono O'odham Nation]] and the Salt River Pima–Maricopa Indian Community, and is used in this article, but the Saxton orthography is also common and is official in the Gila River Indian Community. It is relatively easy to convert between the two, the differences between them being largely no more than different graphemes for the same phoneme, but there are distinctions made by Alvarez–Hale not made by Saxton.

{| class="wikitable"
|-

|-
| {{IPA|/a/}} || '''a''' ''ʼaʼal'' || '''a''' ''a'al'' || baby

|-
| {{IPA|/ː/}} || ''':''' ''ju:kĭ'' || '''h''' ''juhki'' || rain
|}

The Saxton orthography does not mark word-initial {{IPA|/ʔ/}} or extra-short vowels. Final {{angle bracket|i}} generally corresponds to Hale–Alvarez {{angle bracket|ĭ}} and final {{angle bracket|ih}} to Hale–Alvarez {{angle bracket|i}}:

* Hale–Alvarez to:bĭ vs. Saxton tohbi {{IPA|/toːbĭ/}} "cottontail rabbit"
* Hale–Alvarez ʼaːpi vs. Saxton ahpih {{IPA|/ʔaːpi/}} "I"

=== Etymological or phonetic spelling? ===

There is some disagreement among speakers as to whether the spelling of words should be only phonetic or whether etymological principles should be considered as well.

For example, '''''oam'''ajda'' vs. '''''wua'''majda'' ("frybread"; some people may also use a ''c'' instead of a ''j''), ''oam'' means "yellow/brown/orange" and thus is a compound word of sorts. Some people believe it should begin like any word that starts with a {{IPA|/ʊa/}}, ''wua'', while others think its spelling should match that of the word ''oam'' (''oam'' is in fact a form of ''s-oam'', so while it could be spelled ''wuam'' itself, it is not since it is just a different declension of the same word) to reflect its etymology.

==Grammar==

===Syntax===

O'odham has relatively free word order within clauses; for example, all of the following sentences mean "the boy brands the pig":&lt;ref&gt;Zepeda, Ofelia. (1983). ''A Tohono O'odham Grammar''. Tucson, AZ: The University of Arizona Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''ceoj ʼo g ko:jĭ ceposid''
* ''ko:jĭ ʼo g ceoj ceposid''
* ''ceoj ʼo ceposid g ko:jĭ''
* ''ko:jĭ ʼo ceposid g ceoj''
* ''ceposid ʼo g ceoj g ko:jĭ''
* ''ceposid ʼo g ko:jĭ g ceoj''

In principle, these could also mean "the pig brands the boy", but such an interpretation would require an unusual context.

Despite the general freedom of sentence word order, O'odham is fairly strictly [[V2 word order|verb-second]] in its placement of the auxiliary verb (in the above sentences, it is ''ʼo''):

* ''cipkan '''ʼañ''' '' "I am working"
* but ''pi '''ʼañ''' cipkan'' "I am not working", not **''pi cipkan ʼañ''

===Verbs===
Verbs are inflected for [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] (imperfective ''cipkan'', perfective ''cipk''), [[Grammatical tense|tense]] (future imperfective ''cipkanad''), and [[Grammatical number|number]] (plural ''cicpkan''). Number agreement displays [[Ergative–absolutive language|absolutive]] behavior: verbs agree with the number of the subject in intransitive sentences, but with that of the object in transitive sentences:

* ''ceoj ʼo cipkan'' "the boy is working"
* ''cecoj ʼo cicpkan'' "the boys are working"
* ''ceoj ʼo g ko:ji ceposid'' "the boy is branding the pig"
* ''cecoj ʼo g ko:ji ceposid'' "the boys are branding the pig"
* ''ceoj ʼo g kokji ha-cecposid'' "the boy is branding the pigs"

The main verb agrees with the object for person (''ha-'' in the above example), but the auxiliary agrees with the subject: ''ʼa:ñi ʼañ g kokji ha-cecposid'' "I am branding the pigs".

===Nouns===
Three numbers are distinguished in nouns: singular, plural, and distributive, though not all nouns have distinct forms for each. Most distinct plurals are formed by reduplication and often vowel loss plus other occasional morphophonemic changes, and distributives are formed from these by gemination of the reduplicated consonant:

* ''gogs'' "dog", ''gogogs'' "dogs", ''goggogs'' "dogs (all over)"
* ''ma:gina'' "car", ''mamgina'' "cars", ''mammagina'' "cars (all over)"
* ''mi:stol'' "cat", ''mimstol'' "cats"

===Adjectives===
O'odham adjectives can act both attributively modifying nouns and predicatively as verbs, with no change in form.

* ''ʼi:da ṣu:dagĭ ʼo s-he:pid'' "This water is cold"
* ''ʼs-he:pid ṣu:dagĭ ʼañ hohoʼid'' "I like cold water"

==Sample text==
The following is an excerpt from Oʼodham Piipaash Language Program: ''Taḏai''.&lt;ref&gt;Oʼodham Piipaash Language Program. ''Taḏai''. Salt River, AZ: Oʼodham Piipaash Language Program&lt;/ref&gt; It exemplifies the Salt River dialect.

:''Na:nse ʼe:da, mo: hek jeweḍ ʼu:d si we:coc, ma:ṣ hek Taḏai siskeg ʼu:d ʼuʼuhig. Hek ʼaʼanac c wopo:c si wo skegac c ʼep si cecwac.

Tho ṣud me:tkam, ʼam “si ʼi nai:ṣ hek wo:gk” k gau mel ma:ṣ ʼam ki g Tatañki Jioṣ.''

In Saxton orthography:

:''Nahnse ehtha, moh hek jeved uhth sih vehchoch, mahsh hek Tadai siskeg uhth u'uhig. Hek a'anach ch vopohch sih vo skegach ch ep sih chechvach. Kush am hebai hai kih g O'ottham sham o'oitham k am upam thahtha k am cheh mahsh hehkai chu hek ha nahtha.

A '''paysite''' or ''pay site'', in [[pornography]] jargon, is a [[website]] that charges money to become a member and view its content,&lt;ref name=Klar&gt;{{cite book|title=Citizen Sex: The Girl Next Door on the Adult Internet|publisher=[[Trafford Publishing]]|author=Barry Klar |year=2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a9f96zdCu5MC|isbn=1-55395-732-6|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often produces original adult content. They can be contrasted with "free-sites", which do not charge a membership fee.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Most paysites offer "free tours" which allow non-members to view a limited number of short trailers.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of paysite memberships are bought by men.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest paysites began by scanning images from [[pornographic magazines]].&lt;ref name=Williams100&gt;Williams, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; The number of sites then grew until the market was saturated, and now many thousands of sites cater to every legal pornographic niche.&lt;ref name=Williams100/&gt;

Because there is free porn available on the Internet (e.g. [[thumbnail gallery post]] (TGP) and [[Streaming media|streaming video]] sites, not to mention [[Internet piracy|piracy]]), and some individuals cannot afford to or do not wish to purchase paysite memberships, some consumers of pornography view only free pornography. However, paysites are often one of the main originators of new content; they are one way an administrator can pay for the bandwidth costs and they are one of the most conspicuous ways in the industry to try to turn a profit. Theoretically, the more revenue a site takes in, the higher quality content it can produce.

Payment methods include [[credit card]] or [[checking account]] [[Bill (payment)|bill]]ing. Bills routinely appear on statements as transactions under the name of a billing entity with a neutral-sounding company name (ostensibly for discretionary reasons) and may not be readily recognized as paysite billing transactions upon casual perusal of bank statements.

Most paysites prevent unauthorized access to their members area by means of a [[username]] and [[password]].&lt;ref name=Klar/&gt;

A problem that paysites have is [[copyright]] protection, even with well-secured sites: there are cases of so-called "site rips", i.e. sites are either [[Hacker (computer security)|hacked]], or [[subscriber]]s redistributed content from a members' area without authorization; there have thus been sightings of original content on other TGP sites or entire site rip archives on [[file sharing]] networks. Some sites sell site rips of paysites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://technolog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/07/19/7113220-porn-piracy-wars-get-personal Porn piracy wars get personal]&lt;/ref&gt; Administrators may try to counter these problems by employing [[digital rights management]] technologies.

Because members must confirm some details of their identity when they make their payment, a touted advantage of paysites is the potential to keep minors from the viewing of their content, which, in several jurisdictions, including the [[United States]], is [[Pornography laws|illegal]]. The issue of how to protect these Internet audiences from [[internet pornography|pornographic material]] deemed harmful to them has been widely debated in the U.S. in light of the 1998 federal [[Child Online Protection Act]], although websites hosted in the [[United States]] are required by law to publish contact information for the [[Model release#Types of release|custodian of records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ilt.eff.org/index.php/2257_Reporting_Requirements|title=2257 Reporting Requirements|work=eff.org|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/criminal/ceos/subjectareas/obscenity.html|title=Obscenity|work=justice.gov|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/vc_majorthefts/cac/2257-program|title=FBI — 2257 Program|work=FBI|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2257|title=18 U.S. Code § 2257 - Record keeping requirements|work=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many paysites attract potential paying customers by providing a portion of their content for free via [[Free hosted gallery|free hosted galleries]] (FHGs),&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; and use an [[affiliate marketing|affiliate]] program to drive new traffic to those FHGs.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of unique visitors to FHGs who become paying members is known as the ''[[Conversion marketing|conversion ratio]]''.

With so many paysites and so much free porn being readily available the pricing of many paysites has dropped in recent years to increase subscriptions. This has seen the rise of discount sites that offer reduced price memberships to a variety of paysites. Paysites have also increased the quality of their content to attract memberships, with many now offering [[4k resolution|4K]] videos to their members.

The '''People's Linguistic Survey of India''' ('''PLSI''') is a [[linguistic]] [[Survey methodology|survey]] launched in 2010 in order to update existing knowledge about the [[Languages of India|languages spoken in India]].  Conducted by 3500 volunteers, including 2000 language experts, social historians and the staff of the NGO [[Bhasha Research and Publication Centre]], Baroda, the survey has identified 780 languages in India. The 35,000 page survey is being published in 50 volumes.The first six volumes were released at the BhashaVasudha Global Languages Conference in Vadodara on January 7, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Lalmalsawma, David, ‘India speaks 780 languages, 220 lost in last 50 years’, ''Reuters.com'', September 7, 2013, Accessed on January 5, 2015. http://blogs.reuters.com/india/2013/09/07/india-speaks-780-languages-220-lost-in-last-50-years-survey/&lt;/ref&gt; The survey was completed in December 2012 and several of its volumes are being published by the publishing house Orient Blackswan.

==Survey format==
The publications of the survey include the following information: 
* Name of the language. 
* Brief history. 
* Geographical region where the language is spoken. 
* Short bibliography. 
* Sample oral songs with translation. 
* Sample oral stories with translation. 
* Colour terms. 
* Relational terms.
* Terms for time and space.

For scheduled languages, the survey also provides a broad cultural overview of each language.

==Relevance==
The [[Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India]] recognizes 22 scheduled languages, excluding English, and the linguistic policies and funding of the Indian government are organised around this information. However, this information does not adequately convey the linguistic diversity of India. The 1961 Census of India had recorded 1652 languages being in use in India. However, it was decided to exclude languages spoken by less than 10,000 people in the 1971 Census, which brought down the figure to 108 languages.&lt;ref name="Soman2013"&gt;{{cite web|author=Soman, Sandhya|title=India lost 220 languages in the last 50 years|website=The Times of India|date= 9 August 2013|access-date=7 January 2015|url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-lost-220-languages-in-last-50-years-survey-finds/articleshow/21720601.cms}}&lt;/ref&gt; PLSI has followed the policy of including all languages in the survey, irrespective of the number of users. For example, it records a language called Chaimal in Tripura, which is spoken by only five people.&lt;ref&gt;Lalmalsawma, David, ‘India speaks 780 languages, 220 lost in last 50 years’, ''Reuters.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

PLSI also highlights the phenomenon of [[dying language]]s. "On 26 January 2010, a lady who belonged to a community called Bo died in the [[Andaman Islands]] and she was the last speaker of her language that was also called [[Bo language (India)|Bo]]. Sadly, along with her, the continuous line of wisdom of 65,000 years was also gone." said Ganesh Devy, the Chairperson of Bhasha Research and Publication Centre.&lt;ref&gt;Pathak, Maulik, ‘India becoming a graveyard of languages: Ganesh Devy’, ''Live Mint'', February 22, 2013. Accessed on January 5, 2015. http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/vIbx7ZUHxvTQMbwboNYHPI/India-is-becoming-a-graveyard-of-languages.html&lt;/ref&gt; Observing a link between changing economic realities and the survival of languages, Devy contends that "a language disappears when the livelihood options of the speech community disappear."&lt;ref&gt;Lalmalsawma, David, ‘India speaks 780 languages, 220 lost in last 50 years’, ''Reuters.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected findings==
Of all the languages documented by PLSI, 480 are languages spoken by tribals and nomadic tribes, while about 80 are coastal languages. Arunachal Pradesh is the state with the highest number of languages, with as many as 66 languages spoken there,&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Shiv Sahay, ‘Language Survey Reveals Diversity’, ''The Hindu'', July 22, 2013. Accessed on January 5, 2015. http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/language-survey-reveals-diversity/article4938865.ece&lt;/ref&gt; while West Bengal has the highest number of scripts, nine, and around 38 languages. The scripts that exist in Bengal are Ol Chicki (Santhal), Kol Ho, Barangh Kshiti, Lepcha, Sadri and Limbu besides Bengali, Urdu and Nepali.&lt;ref&gt;Bandopadhyay, Krishnendu, ‘Bengal has highest number of scripts: PLSI’, ''The Times of India'', August 31, 2013. Accessed on January 5, 2013. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Bengal-has-highest-number-of-scripts-PLSI/articleshow/22174671.cms&lt;/ref&gt; Languages with increasing numbers of speakers are Byari in Karnataka, Bhojpuri in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, Khasi in Meghalaya, Mizo in Mizoram, Kumouni in Uttarakhand, Kutchhi in Gujarat and Mewati in Rajasthan.&lt;ref&gt;Lalmalsawma, David, ‘India speaks 780 languages’, ''Reuters.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; 400 million of the Indian population speak Hindi and it remains the most popular language of India, while the number of Indian people with English as their mother language has gone up from one hundred eighty-seven thousand in 1971 to 10 million in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Pathak, Maulik, ‘India becoming a graveyard of languages: Ganesh Devy’, ''Live Mint''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dataset contains sound samples of [[Modern Persian]] combination of [[vowel]] and [[consonant]] phonemes from different speakers. Every sound sample contains just one consonant and one vowel So it is somehow labeled in phoneme level. This dataset contains of 23 Persian consonants and 6 vowels. The sound samples are all possible combinations of vowels and consonants (138 samples for each speaker). The sample rate of all speech samples is 48000 which means there are 48000 sound samples in every 1 second. Every sound sample starts with consonant then continues with vowel. In each sample, in average, 0.5 second of each sample is speech and the rest is silence.

[[File:Printing towns incunabula.svg|thumb|Print shops in the 15th century per establishment date and book output]]

In publishing, '''printers ''' are both [[company (law)|companies]] providing [[printing]] services and individuals who directly operate [[printing press]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/printer|title=Printer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Printers include:

*[[Newspaper]] printers, often owned by newspaper publishers
*[[Magazine]] printers, usually independent of magazine publishers
*[[Book]] printers, often not directly connected with book publishers
*[[Stationery]] printers
*[[Packaging]] printers
*[[Trade printing|Trade printers]], who offer wholesale rates within the printing industry

An artist who operates a printing press to execute their own works of printing press such as, hand in limited runs. That is usually distinguished from other printers by the term [[printmaker]].

'''Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus Palladius''', also known as '''Palladius Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus''' or most often just as '''Palladius''', was an ancient writer who wrote in Latin, and is dated variously to the latter 4th century or first half of the 5th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Browning, "Minor Figures," in ''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature'' (Cambridge University Press, 1982), vol. 2, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; He is principally known for his book on [[Roman agriculture|agriculture]], ''Opus agriculturae'', sometimes known as ''De re rustica''.

==Biography==
Since the [[Middle Ages]], authors of agricultural treatises have referred often to Palladius. The Palladii were a prominent [[Gauls|Gallic]] family, and the name ''Palladius'' is probably a family name (of Greek origin), with Aemilianus his ''[[cognomen]]'' (of Roman origin). In [[Late Antiquity]], the [[Roman naming conventions|convention of the ''tria nomina'']] ("three names") for Roman men was no longer standard, and the greater variation in naming practice contributes to the uncertainty over the correct order of his names.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Cameron (classical scholar)|Alan Cameron]], "Polyonomy in the Late Roman Aristocracy: The Case of Petronius Probus," ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 75 (1985), pp. 173–174, citing ''[[Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire|PLRE]]'' II, nos. 4 and 13–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for his life is scant. Manuscripts of his work call him a ''[[vir inlustris]]''. Although Palladius relies heavily on earlier agricultural writers, mainly [[Columella]] and [[Gargilius Martialis]], he also seems to have some first-hand knowledge of farming in Italy and Sardinia as well as experience as a landowner.&lt;ref&gt;R.H. Rodgers, "The Moore Palladius," ''Transactions of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society'' 5.3 (1971), p. 203; Browning, "Minor Figures," ''CHCL,'' vol. 2, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Opus agriculturae''==
The ''Opus agriculturae'' is a treatise on farming in 14 parts or books, written in the late fourth or early fifth century AD.&lt;ref name=Cambridge/&gt; The first book is general and introductory. Books 2 to 13 give detailed instructions for the typical activities on a Roman farm for each month of the year, starting with January. The fourteenth book, ''De Veterinaria Medicina'', was rediscovered only in the 20th century, and gives instructions for the care of animals and elements of veterinary science.&lt;ref name= Cambridge /&gt; Most of the work is in prose, but the final part, formerly considered to be book 14, ''De Insitione'', on [[Grafting]], consists of eighty-five [[couplet]]s of [[elegiac verse]].&lt;ref name=smith /&gt;

The agricultural writings of Palladius may be compared to those of [[Cato the Elder|Marcus Priscus Cato]], [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] and particularly [[Columella|Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella]], whose ''De re rustica'' appears to have served as a model for Palladius,&lt;ref name= Cambridge /&gt; to such an extent that the ''Opus agriculturae'' has been described as an "abridgement" of Columella.&lt;ref name=anthon /&gt;

The work of Palladius was well known in the [[Middle Ages]]. A translation into [[Middle English]] verse survives from about 1420, entitled ''On Husbondrie'';&lt;ref name=lodge /&gt; it can be seen as part of a genre of instructional agricultural writing that was to develop in England into works such as those of [[Thomas Tusser]] and [[Gervase Markham]]. Two notable thirteenth century works that draw on Palladius are the ''Commoda ruralia'' of [[Pietro de' Crescenzi|Petrus de Crescentius]], written c. 1305 and printed at [[Augsburg]] in 1471; and the [[Vincent of Beauvais#Speculum Maius|''Speculum Maius'']] of Vincentius Bellovacensis ([[Vincent de Beauvais]]) written about 1250 and first printed in [[Strasbourg]] in 1473–76.&lt;ref name=esch /&gt; There are a number of other ''[[incunabula]]'' or early editions.

===Water-mills===
[[File:Barbegal mill 02.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Barbegal|sixteen overshot wheels at Barbegal]] are considered the largest [[ancient history|ancient]] mill complex. Their capacity was sufficient to feed the whole nearby city of [[Arles]]]]

The book is known for reference to a [[water-mill]] in Book 1, ch. 41, where Palladius suggests that waste water from an aqueduct should be used to drive a mill. Such mills had been described by [[Vitruvius]] in 25 BC, and there is a growing number of examples of such Roman water-mills. The most spectacular is the set of 16 mills at [[Barbegal]] in southern France, using water fed by a stone aqueduct along the line of the same aqueduct which supplied nearby [[Arles]].

==Principal early editions==

The earliest editions of Palladius group his works with those on agriculture of Cato the Elder, Varro and Columella. Some modern library catalogues follow [[Jacques Charles Brunet|Brunet]] in listing these under "Rei rusticae scriptores" or "Scriptores rei rusticae".&lt;ref name=brunet /&gt;

'''Scratch monkey''' is a term used in [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] [[jargon]], as in "Before testing or reconfiguring, always [[Mount (computing)|mount]] a scratch monkey", a proverb used to advise caution when dealing with irreplaceable [[data]] or [[Peripheral device|device]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 0-262-68092-0 | title = The New Hacker's Dictionary | last1 = Raymond | first1 = Eric S. | date = {{date|1996-10-11|mdy}} | authorlink1 = Eric S. Raymond |page = 398 |edition = 3rd |publisher = MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/scratch-monkey.html |title=The Jargon File - scratch monkey |access-date=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is used to refer to any temporary configuration changes to a computer during any risky operation, which include a replacement for some precious resource or data that might otherwise be destroyed.

The meaning is based upon the use in the 1970s of a [[scratch tape]] or other storage device, which was available for temporary use, to be loaded in place of other tapes whose valuable contents might be damaged by the operation to be performed. If a problem occurred, it would be the scratch tape that was damaged rather than the more valuable tape that had been removed.

The phrase "always mount a scratch monkey" originated from two tales by technicians about maintenance that was performed on computer equipment.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;One story reads that the University of Toronto had taught a monkey called Mabel to swim using a gas regulator to breathe underwater. A computer technician from the hardware supplier DEC adjusted settings on the regulator that altered the gas mixture and asphyxiated Mabel.&lt;/ref&gt;  The technicians were unaware that the computer was connected to five laboratory monkeys, and the [[Planned maintenance|routine maintenance]] procedures caused the death of three of the monkeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edp.org/monkey.htm|title=Scratch Monkey Story|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;In 1979 or 1980, five monkeys at the University of Toronto in the medicine department were hooked up to brainwave sensors using custom hardware. Part of the interface was a diskdrive located in a different part of the building whose read-only button was activated and taped down with a warning not to remove the adhesive tape. Drive read operations operate at a much lower current than write operations. A maintenance technician from outside the university servicing a fault removed the tape, enabled write mode and performed a drive diagnostic test. The resulting electrical current sent through the sensors stunned two monkeys and killed the other three.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sparkling wine''' is a [[wine]] with significant levels of [[carbon dioxide]] in it, making it fizzy. Commonly called [[champagne]], [[European Union |EU]] countries legally reserve that term for products exclusively produced in the [[Champagne (wine region)|Champagne region]] of France. Usually sparkling wine is white or [[rosé]], but there are examples of red sparkling wines such as the [[Italian wine|Italian]] [[Brachetto]], Bonarda and [[Lambrusco]], [[Australian wine|Australian]] sparkling [[Shiraz grape|Shiraz]], and [[Azerbaijan]]i "Pearl of Azerbaijan" made from [[Madrasa (grape)|Madrasa]] grapes. The [[Sweetness of wine|sweetness]] of sparkling wine can range from very dry ''brut'' styles to sweeter ''doux'' varieties (French  for 'raw' and 'sweet', respectively).&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 656-660"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition pg 656–660 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sparkling quality of these wines comes from its carbon dioxide content and may be the result of natural [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]], either in a bottle, as with the [[Champagne Method|traditional method]], in a large tank designed to withstand the pressures involved (as in the [[Charmat process]]), or as a result of simple [[carbonation|carbon dioxide injection]] in some cheaper sparkling wines.

In [[European Union |EU]] countries, the word "champagne" is reserved by law only for  sparkling wine from the Champagne region of France. The French terms ''Mousseux'' and ''[[Crémant]]''  refer to sparkling wine not made in the Champagne region, such as [[Blanquette de Limoux]] produced in Southern France. Sparkling wines are  produced  around the world, and are often referred to by their local name or region, such as Espumante from Portugal, [[Cava (Spanish wine)|Cava]] from Spain, [[Prosecco]], [[Franciacorta (wine)|Franciacorta]], [[Trento DOC]], [[Oltrepò Pavese Metodo Classico (wine)|Oltrepò Pavese Metodo Classico]] and [[Asti (wine)|Asti]] from Italy (the generic Italian term for sparkling wine being [[Sparkling wine#Italian sparkling wine|''spumante'']]), and Cap Classique from [[South Africa]]. Sparkling wines have  been produced in Central and Eastern Europe since the early 19th-century. "Champagne" was further popularised in the region, late in the century, when [[József Törley]] started production in [[Hungary]] using French methods, learned as an apprentice in [[Reims]]. [[Törley]] has since become one of the largest European producers of sparkling wine. The United States is  a significant producer of sparkling wine today, with producers in numerous states. Recently, production of sparkling wine has re-started in the [[English wine|United Kingdom]]  after a long hiatus.

==History==
{{See also|History of Champagne}}

[[File:Epernay-Moet02.JPG|left|thumb|While Dom Perignon is often credited with inventing Champagne, he actually spent most of his life trying to prevent the wine from developing bubbles.]]
[[Carbonation|Effervescence]] has been observed in wine [[history (wine)|throughout history]] and has been noted by [[Ancient Greek (wine)|Ancient Greek]] and [[Roman (wine)|Roman]] writers, but the cause of this mysterious appearance of bubbles was not understood. Over time it has been attributed to [[phases of the moon]] as well as both good and [[evil spirits]].

The tendency of still wine from the Champagne region to lightly sparkle was noted in the Middle Ages but this was considered a [[wine fault]] and was disdained in early Champagne winemaking although it made the pride of other historic sparkling wine production areas like [[Limoux]].&lt;ref name="Stevenson pg 169-178"&gt;T. Stevenson, ed. ''The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia (4th Edition)'' pg 169–178 Dorling Kindersley 2005 {{ISBN|0-7513-3740-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dom Pérignon (monk)|Dom Pérignon]] was originally charged by his superiors at the [[Abbey|Abbey of Hautvillers]] to get rid of the bubbles since the pressure in the bottles caused many of them to burst in the cellar.&lt;ref name="Kladstrup p 25"&gt;D. &amp; P. Kladstrup ''Champagne'' pg 25 Harper Collins Publisher {{ISBN|0-06-073792-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when deliberate sparkling wine production increased in the early 18th century, cellar workers would still have to wear a heavy iron mask that resembled a baseball [[Catcher gear|catcher's mask]] to prevent injury from spontaneously bursting bottles. The disturbance caused by one bottle's disintegration could cause a chain reaction, with it being routine for cellars to lose 20–90% of their bottles to instability. The mysterious circumstance surrounding the then unknown process of fermentation and carbonic gas caused some critics to call the sparkling creations "The Devil's Wine".&lt;ref name="Kladstrup pp 46–47"&gt;D. &amp; P. Kladstrup ''Champagne'' pp 46–47 Harper Collins Publisher {{ISBN|0-06-073792-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British were the first to see the tendency of wines from Champagne to sparkle as a desirable trait and tried to understand why it produced bubbles. Wine was often transported to England in [[oak (wine)|wooden wine barrels]] where merchant houses would then bottle the wine for sale. During the 17th century, [[Early modern glass in England|English glass production]] used coal-fueled ovens and produced stronger, more durable glass bottles than the wood-fired French glass.&lt;ref&gt;S Clarke ''1000 Years of Annoying the French'' p179 Bantam Press 2010 {{ISBN|9780593062722}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English also rediscovered the use of [[cork (material)|cork]] stoppers, once used by the Romans but forgotten for centuries after the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]]. During the cold winters of the Champagne region, temperatures would drop so low that the [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] process was prematurely halted—leaving some [[residual sugar]] and dormant [[yeast (wine)|yeast]]. When the wine was shipped to and bottled in England, the fermentation process would restart when the weather warmed and the cork-stoppered wine would begin to build pressure from carbon dioxide gas. When the wine was opened, it would be bubbly. In 1662, the English scientist [[Christopher Merret]] presented a paper detailing how the presence of sugar in a wine led to it eventually sparkling and that by adding sugar to a wine before bottling it, nearly any wine could be made to sparkle. This is one of the first known accounts of understanding the process of sparkling wine and even suggests that British merchants were producing "sparkling Champagne" before the French Champenois were deliberately making it.&lt;ref name="Stevenson pg 169-178"/&gt;

==Semi-sparkling wine==
{{Redirect|Frizzante|the horse|Frizzante (horse)}}
[[File:Glass of lambrusco (19545132502).jpg|thumb|right|A glass of [[Lambrusco]] from Italy]]
Fully sparkling wines, such as Champagne, are generally sold with 5 to 6 [[atmospheres (unit)|atmospheres]] of pressure in the bottle. This is nearly twice the pressure found in an automobile tire. European Union regulations define a sparkling wine as any wine with an excess of 3 atmospheres in pressure. These include German ''Sekt'', Spanish ''Espumoso'', Italian ''Spumante'' and French ''Crémant'' or ''Mousseux'' wines. Semi-sparkling wines are defined as those with between 1 and 2.5 atmospheres of pressures and include German ''spritzig'', Italian ''frizzante'' and French ''pétillant'' wines. The amount of pressure in the wine is determined by the amount of sugar added during the [[tirage]] stage at the beginning of the secondary fermentation with more sugar producing increased amount of carbon dioxide gas and thus pressure in the wine.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 272-273"/&gt;

==Red sparkling wine==
While the majority of sparkling wines are white or [[rosé]], Australia, Italy and [[Moldova wine|Moldova]] each have a sizable production of red sparkling wines. Of these, Italy has the longest tradition in red sparkling wine-making, with notable wines including [[Brachetto]] and semi sparkling [[Lambrusco]]. In [[Australia wine|Australia]], red sparkling wines are often made from the [[Shiraz (grape)|Shiraz]] grape.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 790"&gt;K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 790 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Pearl of Azerbaijan" is a kind of red sparkling wine made from [[Madrasa (grape)|Madrasa]] grapes in [[Azerbaijan wine|Azerbaijan]].

==Production==
{{Main article|Sparkling wine production}}
[[File:Harvesting Chardonnay grapes.jpg|right|thumb|While harvesting grapes destined for sparkling wine, premium producers will take extra care to handle the grapes as gently as possible in order to minimize the extraction of harsh phenolic compounds from the skin.]]
The [[viticultural]] and [[winemaking]] practices of making sparkling wine have many similarities to the production of still wine with some noted divergence. At the vineyard, grapes are [[harvested (wine)|harvested]] early when there is still high [[acid levels (wine)|acid levels]]. In areas like Australia, winemakers aim to harvest the grapes at 17 to 20° [[brix]]. Unlike still wine production, high [[sugar levels (wine)|sugar levels]] are not ideal and grapes destined for sparkling wine production may be harvested at higher [[yields (wine)|yields]]. Care is taken to avoid tannins and other [[phenolic compounds (wine)|phenolic compounds]] with many premium producers still choosing to harvest by hand rather than risk mechanical harvesting which may split the berries and encourage [[maceration (wine)|maceration]] between the skins and juice. The press house is often close by the vineyard to where the grapes can be quickly [[pressed (wine)|pressed]] and separated from their skins. Red wine grapes like [[Pinot noir]] can be used in the production of white sparkling wines because their juice is initially clear and is only later [[color (wine)|tinted red]] through exposure to the color pigments in grape skins. While some skin exposure may be desirable in the production of [[rosé]] sparkling wines and some ''blanc de noirs'' (white of blacks), most sparkling wine producers take extended precautions to limit the amount of skin contact.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 656-660"/&gt;

The primary [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] of sparkling wine begins like most other wines, though winemakers may choose to use specially cultivated sparkling wine [[yeast]]s. The wines may go through [[malolactic fermentation]], though producers wishing to make fruitier, simpler wines will usually forgo this step. After fermentation the base wines are then blended to form a ''[[cuvee]]''. While there are examples of [[varietal]] sparkling wines, such as ''blanc de blancs'' (white of whites) made from 100% [[Chardonnay]], most sparkling wines are blends of several grape varieties, vineyards and [[vintage]]s. Producers with wide access to grapes will use wines from several hundred base wines to create a blend that reflect the "house style" of their non-vintage wine. It is through the initiation of a [[Secondary fermentation (wine)|secondary fermentation]] that distinguishes sparkling wine production and gives the wine its characteristic "bubbles". One of the by products of fermentation is the creation of carbon dioxide gas. While this gas is able to be released during the first fermentation, efforts are taken during the second fermentation to retain the gas and have it dissolve into the wine. This creates a high pressure within the wine bottle (on average around 5 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]]) and wine producers take care to package the wine in strong glass bottles. When the wine is open and poured into a glass, the gas is released and the wine becomes sparkling.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 656-660"/&gt;

===Secondary fermentation===
[[File:Moet and glass.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Sparkling wine production#transfer method|transfer method]] is used to make small and large format bottles of sparkling wine, such as this split (quarter bottle) of Champagne.]]
There are several methods used to carry out this secondary fermentation. The most well known is the ''[[Traditional method|Traditional]]'' or ''"Champagne method"'' where the base ''cuvee'' is bottled with a mixture of sugar and yeast. The introduction of a fresh yeast and food source (the sugar) triggers the fermentation process in the bottle that the wine will eventually be sold in. Through the process of [[riddling]] and eventually [[Disgorging|disgorgement]], the dead yeast cells ([[lees (wine)|lees]]) are removed from the wine while still maintaining the dissolved carbon dioxide gas. A [[sparkling wine production|dosage]] mixture of fresh wine and some sugar syrup is used to adjust the sweetness level of the wine after it has been disgorged.

In the ''[[Sparkling wine production#ancestral method|methode ancestrale]]'' the disgorgement step is skipped and the wine is sold with the lees still present as sediment in the wine. In the [[Sparkling wine production#transfer method|transfer method]], after the wines have gone through the traditional method including riddling and disgorgement, the bottles are emptied into a large tank where they are then transferred to small and large format [[wine bottle]]s such as 3 liter ''jeroboam'' and small split sizes used on airlines.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 656-660"/&gt;  Numerous quality producers worldwide use the "Traditional" method to make their sparkling wines.

The ''[[Sparkling wine production#charmat method|Charmat method]]'' takes place in stainless steel fermentation tanks that are pressurized. The fresh yeast and sugar mixture is added to the wine which rapidly stimulates fermentation in the pressurized environment. The wine is then cooled, [[clarified (wine)|clarified]] and bottled using a counter pressure filler. The process of carbon injection (or carbonation), the method used to make [[soda pop]] fizzy, does not involve initiating a secondary fermentation but rather injecting carbon dioxide gas directly into the wine. This method produces large bubbles that quickly dissipate and is generally only used in the cheapest sparkling wines.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 656-660"/&gt;

===Bubbles===
[[File:Rose champagne infinite bubbles.jpg|left|thumb|Bubbles in a rosé sparkling wine]]
{{see also|Carbonation}}
An initial burst of effervescence occurs when the sparkling wine contacts the dry glass on pouring. These bubbles form on imperfections in the glass that facilitate [[nucleation]].
Nucleations are needed to stimulate the formation of bubbles because carbon dioxide has to first diffuse from the wine solution before it can rise out of the glass and into the air. A poured glass of sparkling wine will lose its bubbliness and carbon dioxide gas much more quickly than an open bottle alone would.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 272-273"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition pg 272–273. Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[frothiness]] or "mousse" of the wine, along with the average size and consistency of the bubbles, can vary depending on the quality of the wine and the type of glass used.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 656-660"/&gt;
[[File:Champagne bubbles mousse.jpg|right|thumb|As the bubbles rise to the surface of the glass, they form a frothy ''mousse''.]]
The average bottle of Champagne contains enough carbon dioxide to potentially produce 49 million bubbles.&lt;ref name="Miscellany"&gt;G. Harding ''"A Wine Miscellany"'' pg 136–137, Clarkson Potter Publishing, New York 2005 {{ISBN|0-307-34635-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Wine expert [[Tom Stevenson]] puts the number at 250 million.&lt;ref name="Stevenson pg 169-178"/&gt;) The bubbles initially form at 20 [[micrometer]]s in diameter and expand as they gain buoyancy and rise to the surface. When they reach the surface they are approximately 1 millimeter in size. It is speculated that the bubbles in sparkling wine may speed up [[alcohol intoxication]] by helping the alcohol to reach the bloodstream faster. A study conducted at the [[University of Surrey]] in the United Kingdom gave subjects equal amounts of flat and sparkling Champagne which contained the same [[alcohol level|levels of alcohol]]. After 5 minutes following consumption, the group that had the sparkling wine had 54 milligrams of alcohol in their blood while the group that had the same sparkling wine, only flat, had 39 milligrams.&lt;ref name="Miscellany"/&gt;

The amount of sugar (dosage) added after the second fermentation and aging varies and will dictate the sweetness level of the sparkling wine. Wines produced within the European Union must include the sweetness level on the [[wine label]]. For wines produced outside the EU, the sweetness level is not required but if it is included on the label the terms used must conform to EU guidelines.&lt;ref name="Stevenson pg 169-178"/&gt; [[File:French champagne nm.jpg|right|thumb|A French Champagne designated as "Extra Dry".]]
* ''Brut Natural'' or ''Brut Zéro'' (fewer than 3&amp;nbsp;grams of sugar per litre)
* ''Extra Brut'' (fewer than 6&amp;nbsp;grams of sugar per litre)
* ''Brut'' (fewer than 12&amp;nbsp;grams of sugar per litre)

==French sparkling wine==
The most well-known example of sparkling wine is that of Champagne from the [[Champagne wine region]] of France. On average, Champagne is responsible for about 8% of worldwide sparkling wine production with many other regions emulating the "Champagne style" in both grapes used (generally [[Chardonnay]], [[Pinot noir]] and [[Pinot Meunier]]) and production methods—sometimes referred to as the "Champagne method". French sparkling wines made according to the Champagne method of fermentation in the bottle, but sometimes use different grape varieties, are known as ''Cremants'' and are governed under their own ''[[Appellation d'origine contrôlée]]'' (AOC) regulations. Another style of sparkling wine found in France are those made according to the ''[[Sparkling wine production#ancestral method|methode ancestrale]]'' which skips the process of disgorgement and produces wines with slight sweetness and still containing the particles of dead yeast matter in the form of lees in the bottle. The regions of [[Gaillac]], [[Limoux (wine)|Limoux]] and [[Clairette de Die]] are the most well-known producers of ''methode ancestrale'' wines.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 656-660"/&gt;

===Champagne===
{{Main article|Champagne (wine)}}
[[File:A village with vineyards in Champagne, France 1987.jpg|left|thumb|370px|Champagne can only come from the Champagne region of France.]]
Champagne is produced at the far extreme of viticultural circumstances, where the [[grape struggles to ripen]] in a long drawn out growing season. Cool climate weather limits the varieties of grape, and the types of wine that can be made, but it is in this region that sparkling wine has found its standard bearer. The [[limestone]]–[[chalk]] soil produces grapes that have a certain balance of acidity, [[extract (wine)|extract]] and richness that is difficult to replicate in other parts of the world. The Champenois vigorously defend use of the term "Champagne" to relate the specific wine produced in the Champagne wine region. This includes objection to the term "Champagne style" to refer to sparkling wines produced outside the Champagne region. Since 1985, use of the term ''methode champenoise'' has been banned in all wines produced or sold in the European Union.&lt;ref name="Stevenson pg 169-178"/&gt;

Blending is the hallmark of Champagne wine, with most Champagnes being the assembled product of several vineyards and vintages. In Champagne there are over 19,000 vineyard owners, only 5,000 of which are owned by Champagne producers. The rest sell their grapes to the various Champagne houses, ''[[negociants]]'' and co-operatives. The grapes, most commonly Chardonnay, Pinot noir and Pinot meunier, are used to make several base wines that are assembled together to make Champagne. Each grape adds its own unique imprint to the result. Chardonnay is prized for its finesse and [[aging ability (wine)|aging ability]]. Pinot noir adds [[body (wine)|body]] and fruit while Pinot meunier contributes substantially to the [[aroma (wine)|aroma]], adding fruit and floral notes. The majority of Champagnes produced are non-vintage (or rather, multi-vintage) blends. Vintage Champagne, often a house's most prestigious and expensive wine, is also produced, but only in years when the producers feel that the grapes have the complexity and richness to warrant it.&lt;ref name="Stevenson pg 169-178"/&gt;

===Crémant===
[[File:Crémant d'Alsace Ziegler with glass.jpg|right|thumb|A Crémant d'Alsace]]
Sparkling wines designated Crémant ("creamy") were originally named because their lower [[carbon dioxide]] pressures were thought to give them a creamy rather than fizzy mouth-feel. Though they may have full pressures today, they are still produced using the [[traditional method]], and have to fulfill strict production criteria.&lt;ref name="OCW Cremant"&gt;{{cite web|author=Winepros Limited |url=http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=862 |title=Oxford Companion to Wine, 2nd Edition (1999): Crémant |publisher=Winepros.com.au |date=10 October 2000 |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, there are eight [[Appellation d'origine contrôlée|appellations]] for sparkling wine which include the designation Crémant in their name:
*[[Alsace wine region#Crémant d'Alsace AOC|Crémant d'Alsace]]
*Crémant de Bordeaux
*Crémant de Bourgogne
*[[Clairette de Die AOC|Crémant de Die]]
*[[Jura wine regions|Crémant du Jura]]
*Crémant de Limoux
*Crémant de Loire
*Crémant de Savoie&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wine-searcher.com/m/2014/07/savoie-fizz-joins-the-cremant-family|title=Savoie Fizz Joins The Cremant Family - Wine-Searcher News &amp; Features|website=Wine-Searcher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a Crémant designation outside France:
*[[Crémant de Luxembourg]]

French appellation laws dictate that a Crémant must be [[harvest (wine)|harvested]] by hand with yields not exceeding a set amount for their [[Appellation d'origine contrôlée|AOC]]. The wines must also be aged for a minimum of one year. The [[Loire Valley]] is France's largest producer of sparkling wines outside of the Champagne region. The majority of these Crémant de Loire are produced around the city of [[Saumur]] and are a blend of the [[Chardonnay]], [[Chenin blanc]] and [[Cabernet franc]]. AOC laws do allow [[cuvée]]s with [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Pinot noir]], [[Gamay]], [[Côt]], [[Pineau d'aunis]] and [[Grolleau (grape)|Grolleau]] but those grapes are rarely used in a significant amount. In [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], AOC laws require that Crémant de Bourgogne be composed of at least thirty percent Pinot noir, Chardonnay, [[Pinot blanc]] or [[Pinot gris]].

[[File:bouteillemontagecordeliers.jpg|left|320px|thumb|Crémant de Bordeaux Blanc Brut Les Cordeliers]]
As noted above, the designation Crémant was previously used for sparkling wines from the Champagne region which were produced with slightly less carbon dioxide and somewhat lower bottle pressure (typically 2–3 atmospheres instead of 5–6).&lt;ref name="OCW Cremant"/&gt; These wines were rare in comparison to regular, full-pressure Champagne. The Crémant designation was also used for sparkling wines from the Loire valley, in the form of Crémant de Saumur and Crémant de [[Vouvray wine|Vouvray]], without being defined as separate appellations. In 1975, Crémant de Loire was given formal recognition as an AOC, and was followed by Crémant de Bourgogne (1975) and Crémant d'Alsace (1976). When in the late 1980s lobbying by Champagne producers led to ''méthode champenoise'' being forbidden within the [[European Union]] as a designation for the traditional method, the term Crémant was given its present definition. This meant that the use of "Crémant" in the Champagne region was discontinued and additional French Crémant AOCs were created from 1990, starting with Bordeaux and Limoux.

Since the designation Crémant is not reserved exclusively for French use (as a result of it replacing ''méthode champenoise''), it may also be used by producers in other EU countries which fulfill the production criteria. Although such usage is rare, for example in [[Luxembourg wine|Luxembourg]], Crémant de Luxembourg is a designation within the ''Moselle Luxembourgeoise'' appellation, rather than a separate appellation, but otherwise follow the same rules as French Crémant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivv.public.lu/anbaugebiet/produkte/cremant/index.html Institut Viti-Vinicole Grand Duché de Luxembourg: Cremant], accessed on 1 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also some other French appellations for sparkling wines, which do not carry the name Crémant. Some of these are exclusively sparkling wine appellations, and some are appellations allowing both still and sparkling wine to be made. The term ''Mousseux'' is French for "sparkling" and can refer to a sparkling wine made using methods other than the ''méthode champenoise'' such as the Charmat method,&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 460"&gt;J.

===Cava===
{{main article|Cava (Spanish wine)}}
[[File:Semi Seco rosado cava.jpg|left|thumb|A ''semi-seco'' (semi-dry) rosado Cava.]]
'''Cava''' is the name of a type of Spanish (mostly in [[Catalonia]] but also in other regions such as [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], [[Aragon]], [[Extremadura]]) white or pink sparkling wine produced mainly in the [[Alt Penedès|Penedès region]] in Catalonia, 40&amp;nbsp;km to the south west of Barcelona, with the ''[[méthode champenoise]]'' but grape varieties different from grapes used in Champagne making. Cava is a Greek term that was used to refer to a "high end" table wine or wine cellar, and comes from the Latin word "cava" which means cave in English. Caves were used in the early days of Cava production for the preservation or aging of wine.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 143-144"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition pg 143–144 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today Cavas have become integrated with Catalan and also Spanish family traditions and is often consumed at any kind of celebrations (baptism, marriages, banquets, dinners and parties). The sparkling wine of Cava was created in 1872 by [[Josep Raventós]]. The vineyards of Penedès were devastated by the [[phylloxera]] plague, and the predominantly red vines were being replaced by large numbers of vines producing white grapes. After seeing the success of the Champagne region, Raventós decided to create the dry sparkling wine that has become the reason for the region's continued success. In the past the wine was referred to as ''Spanish Champagne'' (no longer permitted under EU law), or colloquially as ''champaña'' in Spanish or ''xampany'' in Catalan.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 455-460"&gt;K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 455–460 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cava is produced in varying levels of [[sweetness of wine|dryness of the wine]] which are: brut nature, brut (extra dry), sec (in Catalan) seco (dry), semisec (in Catalan) semiseco (medium) and dolç (in Catalan) dulce (sweet). Under Spanish ''[[Denominación de Origen]]'' laws, Cava can be produced in six wine regions and must be made according to the ''Traditional Method'' with second fermentation in the bottle and uses a selection of the grapes [[Macabeu]], [[Parellada]], [[Xarel·lo]], [[Chardonnay]], [[Pinot noir]], and [[Subirat]]. Despite being a traditional Champagne grape, Chardonnay was not used in the production of Cava until the 1980s.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 455-460"/&gt;

==={{Anchor|Espumante}}{{Anchor|Frizante}}Portuguese sparkling wine===
[[File:Murganheira.jpg|right|thumb|A sparkling wine from Portugal]]
[[Espumante]] ({{IPA-pt|ɨʃpuˈmɐ̃t(ɨ)}}) is the Portuguese version of a sparkling wine. Unlike Cava, which is produced solely in northern climates, Espumante is not only produced in the northern wet region of Vinho Verde, but also throughout Portugal all the way to the southern region of the Alentejo, known for its extreme temperatures and arid climate.

While Spain has one regulating body, DOC Cava, spread across several different political regions, quality Espumante is produced solely in DOC Bairrada, located just south of Vinho Verde. In order for a wine to be certified as a quality Espumante from DOC Bairrada, it must be made in the traditional champagne (indicating the year of harvest) and stamped with the VEQPRD (Vinho Espumante de Qualidade Produzido em Região Determinada) certification.

VFQPRD is a regional sparkling wine made in the traditional champagne, charmat or transfer method in one of the following determined regions: [[Douro]], [[Tejo VR|Ribatejo]], [[Rios do Minho VR|Minho]], [[Alentejo]] or [[Lisboa VR|Estremadura]].

[[VQPRD]] is a sparkling wine that can be made by injecting the wine with gas in the traditional champagne, charmat, transfer method anywhere in Portugal.

Espumoso is the cheapest and lowest level of sparkling wine, made by injecting the wine with CO2.

Top-quality Espumantes can be found in [[Bairrada]] region and in [[Távora-Varosa DOC|Távora-Varosa]] sub region – Murganheira is an example of high-quality Espumante from this region.

==={{Anchor|Spumante}}{{Anchor|Frizzante}}Italian sparkling wine===
[[File:Moscato d'asti.jpg|left|thumb|A lightly sparkling Moscato d'Asti.]] According to etymological sources, the term "spumante" was not used in a wine context until 1908, more than 40 years following the first Italian sparkling wine using the ''méthode champenoise'' produced by Carlo Gancia which was then sold as "Moscato Champagne".&lt;ref name=wofw-franc&gt;{{cite web |last= Stevenson |first= Tom, ''The World of Fine Wine'' |title= Savor: Franciacorta de Meglio in Meglio |url= http://www.jeremyparzen.com/publications/franciacorta.pdf |date= June 2008 |format= PDF |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110713102047/http://www.jeremyparzen.com/publications/franciacorta.pdf |archivedate= 13 July 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sparkling wines are made throughout Italy but the Italian sparkling wines most widely seen on the world market are the [[Franciacorta (wine)|Franciacorta]] from [[Lombardy (wine)|Lombardy]], [[Asti (wine)|Asti]] from [[Piedmont (wine)|Piedmont]], [[Lambrusco]] from [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]] and [[Prosecco]] from [[Veneto (wine)|Veneto]]. The [[Trento DOC]] is also famous. Though Franciacorta wines are made according to the traditional method, most Italian sparkling wines, in particular Asti and Prosecco, are made with the [[Sparkling wine production#Charmat method|Charmat method]].

Asti is a slightly sweet wine made from the [[Muscat (grape and wine)|Moscato]] grape in the province of [[Asti]]. The wine is noted for its low alcohol levels around 8% and fresh, grapey flavors. [[Moscato d'Asti]] is a ''frizzante'' style slightly sparkling version of Asti;&lt;ref name="Dummies pg 61-62"&gt;M. Ewing-Mulligan &amp; E. McCarthy ''Italian Wines for Dummies'' pg 61–62 Hungry Minds 2001 {{ISBN|0-7645-5355-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is sweeter and contains even less alcohol, typically around 5.5%.

[[File:Italian prosecco.jpg|right|thumb|A Prosecco sparkling wine from Italy.]]
The Franciacorta region, located northwest of [[Brescia]], is home to the largest segment of Italian sparkling wine production. Made predominately from Chardonnay and [[Pinot blanc|Pinot bianco]], sparkling wine labeled under the Franciacorta DOCG is permitted to include no more than 15% Pinot nero. Both vintage and non-vintage Franciacorta sparkling wines are made which require 30 and 18 months, respectively, of aging on the lees.&lt;ref name=wofw-franc/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dummies pg 95-98"&gt;M. Ewing-Mulligan &amp; E. McCarthy ''Italian Wines for Dummies'' pg 95–98 Hungry Minds 2001 {{ISBN|0-7645-5355-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franciacorta Satèn, a ''Blanc de blancs'', is produced with the reduced 4.5 [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]]s of pressure instead of 6 for an expression of softness.&lt;ref name=wofw-franc/&gt;

Trento DOC is an appellation for white and rosé sparkling wines made according to the méthode traditionnelle. Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Pinot blanc and Pinot Meunier grapes are used. There is a maximum vien yield of 150 q.l. per hectare for all varietals, and a maximum grape yield of 70%. The wines must rest for a minimum of 15 months on their lees for non-vintage, 24 months for vintage, and 36 for riserva. Minimum alcohol content must be of 11.5%, or 12% for riserva. Trento DOC wines are distinguished by their straw-yellow color.

[[Prosecco]] is made in both fully sparkling (''spumante'') and lightly sparkling (''frizzante'') styles. The wine is produced in the cool hills around the town of [[Valdobbiadene]] and are generally dry but sweeter examples are produced.&lt;ref name="Dummies pg 129-130"&gt;M. Ewing-Mulligan &amp; E. McCarthy ''Italian Wines for Dummies'' pg 129–130 Hungry Minds 2001 {{ISBN|0-7645-5355-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''v.f.q.p.r.d.''' (Vini Frizzanti di Qualità Prodotti in Regioni Determinate): [[Quality Wines Produced in Specified Regions|Quality ''Vini frizzanti'' made within defined regions]] are generally labeled as such.

===Sekt===
'''Sekt''' is a German term for some sparkling wine. The majority of Sekt produced (around 95%) is made by the Charmat method with the remaining premium Sekt being made according to the ''méthode traditionnelle''. Cheap sparkling wine made with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; injection must not be called Sekt, but rather ''Schaumwein'' (German for sparkling wine, literally "foam wine"), semi-sparkling wine is called ''Perlwein''.  Around 90 percent of Sekt is made at least partially from imported wines from [[Italy (wine)|Italy]], [[Spain (wine)|Spain]] and [[France (wine)|France]]. Sekt labeled as ''Deutscher Sekt'' is made exclusively from German grapes, and ''Sekt b.A.'' (''bestimmter Anbaugebiete'', in parallel to ''[[QbA|Qualitätswein b.A.]]'') only from grapes from one of the 13 quality wine regions in Germany.

Some of the premium wines are often made using the [[Riesling]], [[Pinot blanc]], [[Pinot gris]] and [[Pinot noir]] grapes, with much of it drunk locally rather than exported. These Sekts are usually vintage dated with the village and vineyards that the grapes are from.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 528-529, 583"&gt;K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 528–529, 583 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Premium Sekt b.A. produced in smaller lots is often referred to as ''Winzersekt'' (winegrower's Sekt), since it is typically produced by a producer which has vineyards of his own, rather than by the large Sekt-producing companies (''Sektkellereien'') which buy grapes or base wine on a large scale for their production. In Austria, the corresponding term is ''Hauersekt''.

German production of sparkling wines dates back to 1826, when G. C. Kessler &amp; Co. was founded in [[Esslingen am Neckar]] by [[Georg Christian Kessler]] (1787–1842), who had previously worked at the Champagne house [[Veuve Clicquot]] from 1807 to 1826. The names used by the German producers for their sparkling wines in the 19th century were "Mousseux", "Sect" or "Champagne" (or ''Champagner''), but the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] forbade Germany the use of this name, long before European Union regulations prohibited its use outside the Champagne region. Sekt was initially an informal German name for sparkling wine, coined in Berlin 1825, but was in common use by the 1890s. Germany long attempted to have the name Sekt reserved for sparkling wine from countries with German as an official language, but these regulations were annulled by the [[European Court of Justice]] in 1975. Another legal decision in the 1970s abolished the large producers' monopoly on Sekt production, allowing [[winemaking cooperative]]s and individual winegrowers to produce and sell their own sparkling wines. Together, these two decision produced the situation of the name Sekt being possible to apply to sparkling wines of varying quality level.

Sekt typically comes with elaborate enclosure (safety cage) to withstand its considerable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure. It also comes with a ''Schaumwein'' tax, which since 2005 has been 136 euro per hectoliter, corresponding to 1.02 euro per 0.75 liter bottle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/schaumwzwstg/__2.html Bundesministerium der Justiz: Gesetz zur Besteuerung von Schaumwein und Zwischenerzeugnissen, § 2 Steuertarif] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221112232/http://bundesrecht.juris.de/schaumwzwstg/__2.html |date=21 December 2008 }}, accessed on 17 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This tax was famously introduced by [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Emperor Wilhelm II]] in 1902 to fund the expansion of the [[Kaiserliche Marine|Imperial Navy]].

Germans also call some similar foreign wines ''Sekt'', like ''Krimsekt'' (often red) from [[Crimea]].

In Austria, Sekt is often made in the ''méthode champenoise'' with the [[Welschriesling]] and [[Grüner Veltliner]] grapes giving the wine a golden hue color. Sparkling [[rosé]] are made from the [[Blaufränkisch]] grape.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 528-529, 583"/&gt; Austria's history of producing sparkling wine dates back to the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]]. Most Austrian Sekt producers are based in [[Vienna]] and source their grapes from the [[Weinviertel]] region in [[Lower Austria]]. Like its German counterpart, Austrian Sekt can be made [[trocken]] (dry) or [[halbtrocken]] (medium dry).&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 620"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition pg 620 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Austrian producer of sparkling wine was [[Robert Alwin Schlumberger]], who presented his first sparkling wine in 1846 under the name ''Vöslauer weißer Schaumwein'' (White sparkling wine of Vöslau). It was produced from [[Blauer Portugieser]] grapes growing in vineyards in [[Bad Vöslau]] which Schlumberger bought in 1843, and the sparkling wine was an immediate success. [[Stuttgart]]-born Schlumberger had worked in the Champagne house [[Ruinart (champagne)|Ruinart]] before he moved to [[Vienna]] in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wein-plus.eu/en/Schlumberger_3.0.2673.html Wein-Plus Glossar: Schlumberger], accessed on 6 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The first production facility outside France where sparkling wine was produced following the original French recipe was founded in 1825 in [[Pressburg]] (today [[Bratislava]]) by Johann Fischer and Michael Schönbauer, both [[Bratislava]] burghers. The company, later renamed ''Hubert J.E.'' after J.E. Hubert of the Hubert family, which bought the company from Johann Fischer in 1877, continues to produce sekt until today.

===Pezsgő===
The [[Hungarian (wine)|Hungarian]] equivalent for sparkling wine is '''pezsgő'''. The beginning of significant sparkling wine production in Hungary is dated back to the first half of the 19th century. The first wineries of sparkling wine were founded near [[Pozsony]] (today [[Bratislava]], Slovakia) by Johann Fischer and Dr. Michael Schönbauer in 1825 (the first in Central-Europe) and Esch és Társa in 1835. A couple of decades later the main producers moved to the [[Buda Hills]] and [[Budafok]] nearby the capital creating a new center of production, the so-called "Hungarian Champagne" still existing nowadays. At the end of the 19th century the two most important wineries were [[Törley|József Törley és Társa]] moving from [[Reims]], France to Budafok in 1882 and Louis és César-François founded in 1886. After the [[Hungarian People's Republic|Soviet era]] the Hungarian wine sector was reborn. New and old wineries are seeking for the forgotten roots. Most of the Hungarian sparkling wines are made by the charmat and transvasée methods and a small but steadily growing amount by the traditional, champagneois method. The sorts of grape used during production can be international like Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Riesling, [[Muscat Ottonel]], [[Muscat Lunel]] or natives like [[Olaszrizling]], [[Kékfrankos]], [[Furmint]], [[Királyleányka]], [[Hárslevelű]], [[Kéknyelű]] and [[Juhfark]].&lt;ref&gt;Gábor Rohály (ed) "Magyar Bor Könyve" pg 94–97, Akó press 2001, {{ISBN|963-00-7729-9}} {{hu icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sovetskoye Shampanskoye===
In the Soviet Union, sparkling wine was produced under the name Soviet Champagne, or [[Sovetskoye Shampanskoye]], most of it sweet. This designation continues to be used for sparkling wine produced in several countries formerly part of the Soviet Union, including [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], [[Belarus]], [[Moldova]], Russia and [[Ukraine]]. Most likely, the name has stuck since Sovetskoye Shampanskoye was one of the few products or brands of the Soviet era which were seen as luxurious. Often the names have been altered to fit the exact country, e.g. Georgian Champagne. Nowadays, it is more common to encounter Sovetskoye Shampanskoye produced in a dry or semi-dry style. The products have some international popularity, thus Russian made dry and semi-dry versions can be found in the European markets and Moldovan made semi-sweet version from Muscat grapes has been regularly available in the U.S.

===Romanian sparkling wine===
In Romania, sparkling wine is mostly made in [[Panciu]]. The same traditional method is used in [[Azuga]], where the mountain climate is perfect for the second fermentation of white and rose sparkling wines in passively-cooled above-ground cellars. Grapes used (obviously not grown in this climate) are [[Chardonnay]] and a mix of [[Chardonnay]] and a Romanian variety called [[Fetească Regală]]. Rhein Azuga Cellars, now owned by [[Halewood International]], was established in 1892 and still uses the same methods and even tools from that era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dTl27xHFBo|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, they've become once again official Supplier to the [[Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen of Romania|Royal House of Romania]], after having this honor between 1920 and 1947. Their Rhein Extra, still produced in the same building, was served at the coronation of [[Ferdinand I of Romania|King Ferdinand I]] at [[Alba Iulia]], in October 1922.

===English sparkling wine===
Commercial production of bottle fermented sparkling wines from grapes grown in England started in the 1960s, although there has been a longer history of sparkling wines made in the UK from imported grapes. In the 1980s, some English winemakers started to grow the grape varieties as used in Champagne – Chardonnay, Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier – and in the ensuing decades availability of English sparkling wines made from these varieties increased. Today, there are over 100 vineyards in England producing sparkling wines with Nyetimber, Ridgeview and Chapel Down being some of the largest producers.&lt;ref name="UKVA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.englishwineproducers.com/ |title=United Kingdom Vineyards Association |publisher=Englishwineproducers.com |date= |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Chardonnay and Pinot noir were the two most commonly planted grape varieties in English vineyards. Along with Pinot Meunier, the three varieties combined accounted for around 40% of vines planted, which appears to reflect a significant growth in interest in English sparkling wines. Other varietals used are [[Auxerrois blanc|Auxerrois]], [[Seyval blanc]], [[Müller-Thurgau]], [[Reichensteiner]], and [[Bacchus (grape)|Bacchus]]. To put that in context, the current yield for all types of English wine averages to around 2 million bottles annually.&lt;ref name="FSA--stats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/enforcement/sectorrules/winestandards/ |title=UK Food Standards Agency, Wine Standards Branch |publisher=Food.gov.uk |date=19 July 2006 |accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New World sparkling wine==

===American sparkling wine===
[[File:Domaine Chandon in Champagne coupe.jpg|left|thumb|Sparkling wines have long been produced in the United States.]]
Sparkling wines produced in the United States can be made in both the méthode champenoise and the charmat method. Lower cost sparkling wines, such as [[André (wine)|André]], [[Cook's (wine)|Cook's]], and [[Tott's]], often employ the latter method with more premium sparkling wines utilizing the former. The history of producing quality sparkling wine in California can be traced to the [[Russian River Valley]] of [[Sonoma County]] where, in 1892, the [[Korbel Champagne Cellars|Korbel brothers]] (emigrated from [[Bohemia]] in 1852) began producing sparkling wine according to the méthode champenoise. The first wines produced were made from Riesling, [[Muscatel]], [[Traminer]] and [[Chasselas]] grapes. Partly aided by the foreign influence{{According to whom|date=August 2015}}, the overall quality of Californian sparkling wine increased{{According to whom|date=August 2015}} with the introduction of the more traditional sparkling wine grapes of Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Pinot Meunier and Pinot blanc into the production. US [[American Viticultural Area|AVA]] requirements and wine laws do not regulate the sugar levels and [[sweetness of wine]] though most producers tend to follow European standards with Brut wine having less than 1.5% sugar up to Doux having more than 5%. As the sparkling wine industry in California grew, foreign investments from some of the Champagne region's most noted [[List of champagne producers|Champagne houses]] came to set up wineries in the area. These include [[Moët et Chandon]]'s [http://www.chandon.com/ Domaine Chandon], [[Louis Roederer]]'s [[Roederer Estate]], and [[Taittinger]]'s Domaine Carneros.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 652-655"&gt;K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 652–655 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many top American sparkling wine producers utilize the traditional methods of production, there are distinct differences in their [[wine making]] techniques that have a considerable effect on the taste of the wines. In Champagne, the [[cuvée]] blend will rarely have less than 30 wines and sometimes as many as 60 that are taken from grapes spanning 4–6 years of different [[vintage]]s. In California, cuvees are typically derived from around 20 wines taken from 1 to 2 years worth of vintages.  Champagne laws require that the wine spend a minimum of 15 months on the [[lees (fermentation)|lees]] for non-vintage and minimum 3 years for vintage Champagne. It is not uncommon for a premium Champagne to age for 7 years or more prior to release. In the US, there are no minimum requirements, and aging length can vary from 8 months to 6 years. Another distinct difference, particularly in Californian sparkling wines, is the favorable Californian climate which allows a vintage wine to be produced nearly every year.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 652-655"/&gt;

Current US regulations ban the use of the term "champagne" on any wines not produced in Champagne except if the label was in use before 2006.  No new labels including the term "champagne" will be approved by the US Government for wines produced outside of the Champagne region of France after 2006. Those "grandfathered labels" can only use the term on a wine label if there appears next to that name the appellation of "the actual place of origin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Code Collection [Section 5388(c) of Title 26 of the United States Code "Section 5388(c) of Title 26 of the United States Code"]

The growth of the [[Finger Lakes]] wine industry in [[New York State]] and the success of [[Riesling]] wines from the region has resulted in an increasing number of producers such as [[Swedish Hill Vineyards]] making méthode champenoise sparkling wines from primarily or 100% Riesling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chronicle-express.com/news/business/x279156168/Governors-Cup-goes-to-Swedish-Hill-Riesling-Cuvee |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006071237/http://www.chronicle-express.com/news/business/x279156168/Governors-Cup-goes-to-Swedish-Hill-Riesling-Cuvee |archive-date=6 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Finger Lakes]] producers such as Glenora and Casa Larga are also producing méthode champenoise sparkling wine from other grapes such as the traditional Chardonnay and Pinot noir.

===Canada===
Canada's sparkling wine producers are found in Southern [[Ontario]], [[British Columbia]], [[Quebec]] and [[Nova Scotia]], where growing conditions mirror that of [[Champagne]], [[Provence]] and [[Languedoc]] of [[France]]. In particular, Ontario's appellations are emerging as strong producers of dry sparkling wines as their cooler climate conditions are very conducive to producing excellent, flavourful and not-too-ripe grapes.&lt;ref name="VQA Ontario Wines - Overview"&gt;{{cite web|  url=http://www.vqaontario.ca/Wines |  work=vqaontario.ca | title=VQA Ontario Wines - Overview }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While traditionally aimed at the domestic market, Canadian sparkling wines have recently gained prominence internationally. In 2011, L'Acadie Vineyards won a silver medal at an international competition for sparkling wines in [[France]] and in 2012, [[Benjamin Bridge]] winery's 2004 Brut Reserve placed higher than a [[Louis Roederer]] 2004 [[Cristal (wine)]] champagne at a blind tasting held with noted critics, bringing attention to the country's wine industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|  url=http://www.macleans.ca/society/life/canadas-bubbly-personality |  work=macleans.ca | title=Canada's bubbly personality}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ontario, wineries recognized for their sparkling wines include [[Henry of Pelham Winery]], [[Jackson-Triggs]] and [[Inniskillin]].

[[Ontario]], and in particular the [[Niagara Peninsula]], is the largest wine growing region in [[Canada]]. Approximately 26 of the [[Niagara Peninsula wineries]] produce some sparkling wine, where annual production averages about 55,000 cases (500,000 litres).&lt;ref name="Sparkling"&gt;{{cite web|  url=http://winecountryontario.ca/media-centre/sparkling |  work=winecountryontario.ca | title=Sparkling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sparkling wine is largely produced in the Traditional Method (65%), and a smaller proportion is produced in the [[Charmat]] method (35%).&lt;ref name="Sparkling"/&gt; The Niagara Peninsula region's micro-climate is well suited for the growth of [[Chardonnay]], [[Riesling]], [[Vidal Blanc]], [[Pinot Noir]] and [[Gamay]] grapes, which are the prominent varietals for Ontario sparkling wine.&lt;ref name="Sparkling"/&gt; Ontario sparkling wines are often noted for having a character and aroma comparable to that of traditional [[Champagne]], including biscuit, subtle yeast and palate cleansing bubbles.&lt;ref name="VQA Ontario Wines - Overview"/&gt;

An emerging sparkling wine-focused region in Ontario is [[Prince Edward County, Ontario]]. The County is noted for its [[Prince Edward County Wine]] and is the fourth and newest Designated Viticultural Area (DVA) in the Province. Like the [[Niagara Peninsula]], Prince Edward County's [[terroir]] and micro-climate are well suited for cool climate grapes where wineries, such as [[The Hinterland Wine Company]], specialize in the production of sparkling wines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|  url=http://www.hinterlandwine.com/pages/about-us |  work=hinterlandwine.com | title=Hinterland Wine Company, About Us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sparkling icewine in [[Ontario]] was first crafted by Canadian wine writer Konrad Ejbich in his home cellar in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|  url=https://sommelierscribbler.wordpress.com/2012/03/13/sparkling-icewine-uniquely-canadian/|title=Sparkling Icewine – Uniquely Canadian|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unique to Ontario and generally referred to as Icewine Dosage, this sparkling wine is produced by topping a Traditional Method, dry sparkling wine with a [[dose (biochemistry)|dosage]] of Icewine, which is slightly off-dry with a hint of Icewine.&lt;ref name="VQA Ontario Wines - Overview"/&gt;

===Australia===

Australian sparkling wine production has come a long time in a very short period of time, according to Wine Australia 2014-2015 annual report{{cn|date=February 2018}} with several notable French Champagne houses investing in production. 

Tasmania is a centre of Australian sparkling wine production. Wine commentator James Halliday states "the clear majority of the best sparkling wines are now solely sourced from Tasmania",&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043152/https://www.winecompanion.com.au/wines/best-of-sparkling-2016 ]&lt;/ref&gt; and Tyson Stelzer says "Tasmania confidently holds its place as Australia’s sparkling capital"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tysonstelzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Australian-Sparkling-Report-2017-1.pdf |title=Australian report |date=2017 |website=www.tysonstelzer.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; with both the traditional grape varieties and method of secondary fermentation being employed. 

Whilst most sparkling wine is produced from Chardonnay, Pinot noir and possibly Pinot Meuniere, an Australian speciality is [[sparkling Shiraz]], a red sparkling wine produced from [[Shiraz (grape)|Shiraz]] grapes. Most sparkling Shiraz is traditionally somewhat sweet, but some producers make it dry, full-bodied and tannic.

Since 2012, Australian mass producers of sparkling wine have begun using [[Screw cap (wine)|screw caps]] in place of the traditional cork &amp; wire closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richard|first1=Alice|title=All the fizz, none of the pop: screw-capped sparkling wine closure launched|url=http://www.foodprocessing.com.au/content/food-design-research/news/all-the-fizz-none-of-the-pop-screw-capped-sparkling-wine-closure-launched-238159608|website=Food Processing|accessdate=31 January 2015|date=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
Chile produces around 12 million bottles of sparkling wine per annum of which only around 1.6 million bottles are exported to overseas markets.&lt;ref&gt;Data provided by Vielle internationale des techniques effervescents. (www.veille.viteff.com)|accessdate=31 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Although sparkling wines have been made since 1879, they have not yet established a significant place in Chile's wine portfolio.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 163-167"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 163-167 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the Pais grape variety has been creatively employed on its own or in blends, to make modern wines that have received favorable reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Tapia P (2011), Descorchados, Santiago, Planeta&lt;/ref&gt; A rise in consumer demand and an ever-broadening selection of cool climate grapes has led to an increase in fresh and delightful sparkling wines ranging from bone dry extra brut to off-dry demi-secs, from blanc de blanc to blanc de noir to sparkling rosé. Valdivieso produce 60% of all sparkling wine in Chile. Most is inexpensive tank method fizz, but 20% is very good quality Champagne method from Pinot and Chardonnay. There is also a product made from a blend of sparkling Pinot wine and fresh handpicked strawberry pulp.

Méthode Cap Classique or MCC is the term used to describe sparkling wines made by the classic method of undergoing second fermentation in the bottle. There are quality standards that all producers adhere to voluntarily, apart from the minimum time on the lees (nine months) and the bars of pressure, which are mandatory in order to use MCC on the label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wosa.co.za/The-Industry/Varieties-and-Styles/Wine-Styles/ |title=Wine styles |publisher=Wosa.co.za |date= |accessdate=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Champagne varieties such as [[Chardonnay]] and [[Pinot noir]] are mostly used for MCC production, however the use of other varieties are becoming increasingly popular and local MCC labels are seen with the likes of [[Sauvignon blanc]] and [[Chenin blanc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vinlab.com/mcc-part-1-viticulture/|title=Méthode Cap Classique, Part 1: Viticulture - Vinlab|date=11 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sparkling wine is also made according to the [[Charmat]] method and red sparkling [[Pinotage]] can also be found.&lt;ref name="Sotheby pg 442-448"&gt;T.

{{Automata theory}}
A '''Turing machine''' is a [[mathematical model of computation]] that defines an [[abstract machine]],&lt;ref&gt;Minsky 1967:107 "In his 1936 paper, A. M. Turing defined the class of abstract machines that now bear his name. A Turing machine is a finite-state machine associated with a special kind of environment -- its tape -- in which it can store (and later recover) sequences of symbols", also Stone 1972:8 where the word "machine" is in quotation marks.&lt;/ref&gt; which manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules.&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1972:8 states "This "machine" is an abstract mathematical model", also cf. Sipser 2006:137ff that describes the "Turing machine model". Rogers 1987 (1967):13 refers to "Turing's characterization", Boolos Burgess and Jeffrey 2002:25 refers to a "specific kind of idealized machine".&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the model's simplicity, given any [[computer algorithm]], a Turing machine capable of simulating that algorithm's logic can be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Sipser 2006:137 "A Turing machine can do everything that a real computer can do".&lt;/ref&gt;

The machine operates on an infinite&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Sipser 2002:137. Also Rogers 1987 (1967):13 describes "a paper tape of infinite length in both directions". Minsky 1967:118 states "The tape is regarded as infinite in both directions". Boolos Burgess and Jeffrey 2002:25 include the possibility of "there is someone stationed at each end to add extra blank squares as needed".&lt;/ref&gt; memory tape divided into [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] ''cells''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Rogers 1987 (1967):13. Other authors use the word "square" e.g. Boolos Burgess Jeffrey 2002:35, Minsky 1967:117, Penrose 1989:37.&lt;/ref&gt; The machine positions its ''head'' over a cell and "reads" (scans)&lt;ref&gt;This word is used by e.g. Davis 2000:151&lt;/ref&gt; the symbol there. Then, as per the symbol and its present place in a ''finite table''&lt;ref&gt;This table represents an [[algorithm]] or "effective computational procedure" which is necessarily finite; see Penrose 1989:30ff, Stone 1972:3ff.&lt;/ref&gt; of user-specified instructions, the machine (i) writes a symbol (e.g., a digit or a letter from a finite alphabet) in the cell (some models allowing symbol erasure or no writing),&lt;ref&gt;Boolos Burgess and Jeffrey 2002:25&lt;/ref&gt; then (ii) either moves the tape one cell left or right (some models allow no motion, some models move the head),&lt;ref&gt;Boolos Burgess Jeffry 2002:25 illustrate the machine as moving along the tape. Penrose 1989:36-37 describes himself as "uncomfortable" with an infinite tape observing that it "might be hard to shift!"; he "prefer[s] to think of the tape as representing some external environment through which our finite device can move" and after observing that the " 'movement' is a convenient way of picturing things" and then suggests that "the device receives all its input from this environment.&lt;/ref&gt; then (iii) (as determined by the observed symbol and the machine's place in the table) either proceeds to a subsequent instruction or halts the computation.&lt;ref&gt;"Also by convention one of the states is distinguished as the stopping state and is given the name HALT" (Stone 1972:9). Turing's original description did not include a HALT instruction but he did allow for a "circular" condition, a "configuration from which there is no possible move" (see Turing 1936 in ''The Undecidable'' 1967:119); this notion was added in the 1950s; see more at [[Halting problem]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turing machine was invented in 1936 by [[Alan Turing]],&lt;ref name=Hodges-2012&gt;{{cite book| first=Andrew | last=Hodges | authorlink =Andrew Hodges | year = 2012 | title =[[Alan Turing: The Enigma]] (The Centenary Edition) |publisher =[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=978-0-691-15564-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The idea came to him in mid-1935 (perhaps, see more in the History section) after a question posed by [[M. H. A. Newman]] in his lectures: "Was there a definite method, or as Newman put it, a ''mechanical process'' which could be applied to a mathematical statement, and which would come up with the answer as to whether it was provable" (Hodges 1983:93). Turing submitted his paper on 31 May 1936 to the London Mathematical Society for its ''Proceedings'' (cf. Hodges 1983:112), but it was ''published'' in early 1937 and offprints were available in February 1937 (cf. Hodges 1983:129).&lt;/ref&gt; who called it an ''a-machine'' (automatic machine).&lt;ref&gt;See footnote in Davis 2000:151.&lt;/ref&gt; With this model, Turing was able to answer two questions in the negative: (1) Does a machine exist that can determine whether any arbitrary machine on its tape is "circular" (e.g., freezes, or fails to continue its computational task); similarly, (2) does a machine exist that can determine whether any arbitrary machine on its tape ever prints a given symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936 in ''The Undecidable'' 1965:132-134; Turing's definition of "circular" is found on page 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus by providing a mathematical description of a very simple device capable of arbitrary computations, he was able to prove properties of computation in general—and in particular, the [[computability|uncomputability]] of the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] ("decision problem").&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936 in ''The Undecidable'' 1965:145&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Turing machines prove fundamental limitations on the power of mechanical computation.&lt;ref&gt;Sipser 2006:137 observes that "A Turing machine can do everything that a real computer can do. Nevertheless, even a Turing machine cannot solve certain problems. In a very real sense, these problems are beyond the theoretical limits of computation."&lt;/ref&gt; While they can express arbitrary computations, their minimalistic design makes them unsuitable for computation in practice: real-world [[computer]]s are based on different designs that, unlike Turing machines, use [[random-access memory]].

[[Turing completeness]] is the ability for a system of instructions to simulate a Turing machine. A programming language that is Turing complete is theoretically capable of expressing all tasks accomplishable by computers; nearly all programming languages are Turing complete if the limitations of finite memory are ignored.

==Overview==
A '''Turing machine''' is a general example of a [[Central processing unit|CPU]] that controls all data manipulation done by a computer, with the canonical machine using sequential memory to store data. More specifically, it is a machine ([[automaton]]) capable of [[enumeration|enumerating]] some arbitrary subset of valid strings of an [[Alphabet (formal languages)|alphabet]]; these strings are part of a [[recursively enumerable set]]. A Turing machine has a tape of infinite length that enables read and write operations to be performed.

Assuming a [[black box]], the Turing machine cannot know whether it will eventually enumerate any one specific string of the subset with a given program. This is due to the fact that the [[halting problem]] is unsolvable, which has major implications for the theoretical limits of computing.

The Turing machine is capable of processing an [[unrestricted grammar]], which further implies that it is capable of robustly evaluating first-order logic in an infinite number of ways. This is famously demonstrated through [[lambda calculus]].

A Turing machine that is able to simulate any other Turing machine is called a [[universal Turing machine]] ('''UTM''', or simply a '''universal machine'''). A more mathematically oriented definition with a similar "universal" nature was introduced by [[Alonzo Church]], whose work on lambda calculus intertwined with Turing's in a formal theory of [[computation]] known as the [[Church–Turing thesis]]. The thesis states that Turing machines indeed capture the informal notion of [[effective method]]s in [[logic]] and [[mathematics]], and provide a precise definition of an [[algorithm]] or "mechanical procedure". Studying their  [[abstract machine|abstract properties]] yields many insights into [[computer science]] and [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]].

===Physical description===
In his 1948 essay, "Intelligent Machinery", Turing wrote that his machine consisted of:

: ...an unlimited memory capacity obtained in the form of an infinite tape marked out into squares, on each of which a symbol could be printed. At any moment there is one symbol in the machine; it is called the scanned symbol. The machine can alter the scanned symbol, and its behavior is in part determined by that symbol, but the symbols on the tape elsewhere do not affect the behavior of the machine. However, the tape can be moved back and forth through the machine, this being one of the elementary operations of the machine. Any symbol on the tape may therefore eventually have an innings.&lt;ref&gt;See the definition of "[[wikt:innings|innings]]" on [[Wiktionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; (Turing 1948, p. 3&lt;ref&gt;

==Informal description==
{{for|visualizations of Turing machines|Turing machine gallery}}

The Turing machine mathematically models a machine that mechanically operates on a tape.  On this tape are symbols, which the machine can read and write, one at a time, using a tape head. Operation is fully determined by a finite set of elementary instructions such as "in state 42, if the symbol seen is 0, write a 1; if the symbol seen is 1, change into state 17; in state 17, if the symbol seen is 0, write a 1 and change to state 6;" etc. In the original article ("[[On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem]]", see also [[#The Entscheidungsproblem (the "decision problem"): Hilbert's tenth question of 1900|references below]]), Turing imagines not a mechanism, but a person whom he calls the "computer", who executes these deterministic mechanical rules slavishly (or as Turing puts it, "in a desultory manner").

[[File:Turing machine 2a.svg|thumb|right|300px|The head is always over a particular square of the tape; only a finite stretch of squares is shown. The instruction to be performed (q&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is shown over the scanned square. (Drawing after Kleene (1952) p. 375.)]]

[[File:Turing machine 2b.svg|thumb|right|300px|Here, the internal state (q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is shown inside the head, and the illustration describes the tape as being infinite and pre-filled with "0", the symbol serving as blank. The system's full state (its ''complete configuration'') consists of the internal state, any non-blank symbols on the tape (in this illustration "11B"), and the position of the head relative to those symbols including blanks, i.e. "011B". (Drawing after Minsky (1967) p. 121.)]]

More precisely, a Turing machine consists of:
* A '''tape''' divided into cells, one next to the other. Each cell contains a symbol from some finite alphabet. The alphabet contains a special ''blank'' symbol (here written as '0') and one or more other symbols. The tape is assumed to be arbitrarily extendable to the left and to the right, i.e., the Turing machine is always supplied with as much tape as it needs for its computation. Cells that have not been written before are assumed to be filled with the blank symbol. In some models the tape has a left end marked with a special symbol; the tape extends or is indefinitely extensible to the right.
* A '''head''' that can read and write symbols on the tape and move the tape left and right one (and only one) cell at a time. In some models the head moves and the tape is stationary.
* A '''state register''' that stores the state of the Turing machine, one of finitely many. Among these is the special ''start state'' with which the state register is initialized. These states, writes Turing, replace the "state of mind" a person performing computations would ordinarily be in.
* A finite '''table'''&lt;ref&gt;Occasionally called an '''action table''' or '''transition function'''.&lt;/ref&gt; of instructions&lt;ref&gt;Usually quintuples [5-tuples]: q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;→q&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;j1&lt;/sub&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, but sometimes quadruples [4-tuples].&lt;/ref&gt; that, given the ''state''(q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) the machine is currently in ''and'' the ''symbol''(a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;) it is reading on the tape (symbol currently under the head), tells the machine to do the following ''in sequence'' (for the 5-tuple models):
# Either erase or write a symbol (replacing a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; with a&lt;sub&gt;j1&lt;/sub&gt;).
# Move the head (which is described by d&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; and can have values: 'L' for one step left ''or'' 'R' for one step right ''or'' 'N' for staying in the same place).
# Assume the same or a ''new state'' as prescribed (go to state q&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt;).
In the 4-tuple models, erasing or writing a symbol (a&lt;sub&gt;j1&lt;/sub&gt;) and moving the head left or right (d&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;) are specified as separate instructions. Specifically, the table tells the machine to (ia) erase or write a symbol ''or'' (ib) move the head left or right, ''and then'' (ii) assume the same or a new state as prescribed, but not both actions (ia) and (ib) in the same instruction. In some models, if there is no entry in the table for the current combination of symbol and state then the machine will halt; other models require all entries to be filled.

Note that every part of the machine (i.e. its state, symbol-collections, and used tape at any given time) and its actions (such as printing, erasing and tape motion) is ''finite'', ''discrete'' and ''distinguishable''; it is the unlimited amount of tape and runtime that gives it an unbounded amount of [[Computer storage|storage space]].

==Formal definition==
Following Hopcroft and Ullman (1979, p.&amp;nbsp;148), a (one-tape) Turing machine can be formally defined as a 7-[[tuple]] &lt;math&gt;M = \langle Q, \Gamma, b, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F \rangle&lt;/math&gt; where
* &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is a finite, non-empty set of ''states'';
* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a finite, non-empty set of ''tape alphabet symbols'';
* &lt;math&gt;b \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the ''blank symbol'' (the only symbol allowed to occur on the tape infinitely often at any step during the computation);
* &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\subseteq\Gamma\setminus\{b\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of ''input symbols'', that is, the set of symbols allowed to appear in the initial tape contents;
* &lt;math&gt;q_0 \in Q&lt;/math&gt; is the ''initial state'';
* &lt;math&gt;F \subseteq Q&lt;/math&gt; is the set of ''final states'' or ''accepting states''. The initial tape contents is said to be ''accepted'' by &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; if it eventually halts in a state from &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\delta: (Q \setminus F) \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \{L,R\}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[partial function]] called the ''[[State transition system|transition function]]'', where L is left shift, R is right shift. (A relatively uncommon variant allows "no shift", say N, as a third element of the latter set.) If &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is not defined on the current state and the current tape symbol, then the machine halts;&lt;ref&gt;p.149; in particular, Hopcroft and Ullman assume that &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is undefined on all states from &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;


Anything that operates according to these specifications is a Turing machine.

The 7-tuple for the 3-state [[busy beaver]] looks like this (see more about this busy beaver at [[Turing machine examples]]):
* &lt;math&gt;Q = \{ \mbox{A}, \mbox{B}, \mbox{C}, \mbox{HALT} \}&lt;/math&gt; (states);
* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \{ 0, 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; (tape alphabet symbols);
* &lt;math&gt;b = 0&lt;/math&gt; (blank symbol);
* &lt;math&gt;\Sigma = \{ 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; (input symbols);
* &lt;math&gt;q_0 = \mbox{A}&lt;/math&gt; (initial state);
* &lt;math&gt;F = \{ \mbox{HALT} \}&lt;/math&gt; (final states);
* &lt;math&gt;\delta = &lt;/math&gt; see state-table below (transition function).

Initially all tape cells are marked with &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Additional details required to visualize or implement Turing machines==
In the words of van Emde Boas (1990), p.&amp;nbsp;6: "The set-theoretical object [his formal seven-tuple description similar to the above] provides only partial information on how the machine will behave and what its computations will look like."

For instance,
* There will need to be many decisions on what the symbols actually look like, and a failproof way of reading and writing symbols indefinitely.
* The shift left and shift right operations may shift the tape head across the tape, but when actually building a Turing machine it is more practical to make the tape slide back and forth under the head instead.
* The tape can be finite, and automatically extended with blanks as needed (which is closest to the mathematical definition), but it is more common to think of it as stretching infinitely at one or both ends and being pre-filled with blanks except on the explicitly given finite fragment the tape head is on.  (This is, of course, not implementable in practice.)  The tape ''cannot'' be fixed in length, since that would not correspond to the given definition and would seriously limit the range of computations the machine can perform to those of a [[linear bounded automaton]].

===Alternative definitions===
Definitions in literature sometimes differ slightly, to make arguments or proofs easier or clearer, but this is always done in such a way that the resulting machine has the same computational power. For example, changing the set &lt;math&gt;\{L,R\}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\{L,R,N\}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''N'' ("None" or "No-operation") would allow the machine to stay on the same tape cell instead of moving left or right, does not increase the machine's computational power.

The most common convention represents each "Turing instruction" in a "Turing table" by one of nine 5-tuples, per the convention of Turing/Davis (Turing (1936) in ''The Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;126-127 and Davis (2000) p.&amp;nbsp;152):

: (definition 1): '''(q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;/E/N, L/R/N, q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;)'''
:: '''(''' current state '''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' ''',''' symbol scanned '''S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''' ''',''' print symbol '''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'''/erase '''E'''/none '''N''' ''',''' move_tape_one_square left '''L'''/right '''R'''/none '''N''' ''',''' new state '''q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''' ''')'''

Other authors (Minsky (1967) p.&amp;nbsp;119, Hopcroft and Ullman (1979) p.&amp;nbsp;158, Stone (1972) p.&amp;nbsp;9) adopt a different convention, with new state '''q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''' listed immediately after the scanned symbol S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;:
: (definition 2): '''(q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;/E/N, L/R/N)'''
:: '''(''' current state '''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' ''',''' symbol scanned '''S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''' ''',''' new state '''q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''' ''',''' print symbol '''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'''/erase '''E'''/none '''N''' ''',''' move_tape_one_square left '''L'''/right '''R'''/none '''N''' ''')'''

For the remainder of this article "definition 1" (the Turing/Davis convention) will be used.

In the following table, Turing's original model allowed only the first three lines that he called N1, N2, N3 (cf. Turing in ''The Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;126). He allowed for erasure of the "scanned square" by naming a 0th symbol S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = "erase" or "blank", etc. However, he did not allow for non-printing, so every instruction-line includes "print symbol S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;" or "erase" (cf. footnote 12 in Post (1947), ''The Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;300). The abbreviations are Turing's (''The Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;119). Subsequent to Turing's original paper in 1936–1937, machine-models have allowed all nine possible types of five-tuples:

Any Turing table (list of instructions) can be constructed from the above nine 5-tuples. For technical reasons, the three non-printing or "N" instructions (4, 5, 6) can usually be dispensed with. For examples see [[Turing machine examples]].

Less frequently the use of 4-tuples are encountered: these represent a further atomization of the Turing instructions (cf. Post (1947), Boolos &amp; Jeffrey (1974, 1999), Davis-Sigal-Weyuker (1994)); also see more at [[Post–Turing machine]].

===The "state"===
The word "state" used in context of Turing machines can be a source of confusion, as it can mean two things. Most commentators after Turing have used "state" to mean the name/designator of the current instruction to be performed—i.e. the contents of the state register. But Turing (1936) made a strong distinction between a record of what he called the machine's "m-configuration", and the machine's (or person's) "state of progress" through the computation - the current state of the total system. What Turing called "the state formula" includes both the current instruction and ''all'' the symbols on the tape:

{{quote|Thus the state of progress of the computation at any stage is completely determined by the note of instructions and the symbols on the tape. That is, the '''state of the system''' may be described by a single expression (sequence of symbols) consisting of the symbols on the tape followed by Δ (which we suppose not to appear elsewhere) and then by the note of instructions. This expression is called the 'state formula'.|''The Undecidable'', pp. 139–140, emphasis added}}

Earlier in his paper Turing carried this even further: he gives an example where he placed a symbol of the current "m-configuration"—the instruction's label—beneath the scanned square, together with all the symbols on the tape (''The Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;121); this he calls "the ''complete configuration''" (''The Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;118). To print the "complete configuration" on one line, he places the state-label/m-configuration to the ''left'' of the scanned symbol.

A variant of this is seen in Kleene (1952) where [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] shows how to write the [[Gödel number]] of a machine's "situation": he places the "m-configuration" symbol q&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; over the scanned square in roughly the center of the 6 non-blank squares on the tape (see the Turing-tape figure in this article) and puts it to the ''right'' of the scanned square. But Kleene refers to "q&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;" itself as "the machine state" (Kleene, p.&amp;nbsp;374-375). Hopcroft and Ullman call this composite the "instantaneous description" and follow the Turing convention of putting the "current state" (instruction-label, m-configuration) to the ''left'' of the scanned symbol (p.&amp;nbsp;149).

'''Example: total state of 3-state 2-symbol busy beaver after 3 "moves"''' (taken from example "run" in the figure below):
:: 1'''A'''1
This means: after three moves the tape has ... 000110000 ... on it, the head is scanning the right-most 1, and the state is '''A'''. Blanks (in this case represented by "0"s) can be part of the total state as shown here: '''B'''01; the tape has a single 1 on it, but the head is scanning the 0 ("blank") to its left and the state is '''B'''.

"State" in the context of Turing machines should be clarified as to which is being described: (''i'') the current instruction, or (''ii'') the list of symbols on the tape together with the current instruction, or (''iii'') the list of symbols on the tape together with the current instruction placed to the left of the scanned symbol or to the right of the scanned symbol.

Turing's biographer Andrew Hodges (1983: 107) has noted and discussed this confusion.

[[File:State diagram 3 state busy beaver 2B.svg|thumb|500px|right|The "3-state busy beaver" Turing machine in a [[Finite State Machine|finite state representation]]. Each circle represents a "state" of the table—an "m-configuration" or "instruction". "Direction" of a state ''transition'' is shown by an arrow. The label (e.g. '''0/P,R''') near the outgoing state (at the "tail" of the arrow) specifies the scanned symbol that causes a particular transition (e.g. '''0''') followed by a slash '''/''', followed by the subsequent "behaviors" of the machine, e.g. "'''P''' '''P'''rint" then move tape "'''R''' '''R'''ight". No general accepted format exists. The convention shown is after McClusky (1965), Booth (1967), Hill, and Peterson (1974).]]

To the right: the above table as expressed as a "state transition" diagram.

Usually large tables are better left as tables (Booth, p.&amp;nbsp;74). They are more readily simulated by computer in tabular form (Booth, p.&amp;nbsp;74). However, certain concepts—e.g. machines with "reset" states and machines with repeating patterns (cf. Hill and Peterson p.&amp;nbsp;244ff)—can be more readily seen when viewed as a drawing.

Whether a drawing represents an improvement on its table must be decided by the reader for the particular context. See [[Finite state machine]] for more.

[[File:Moves of a 3-state Busy Beaver.jpg|thumbnail|500px|right|The evolution of the busy-beaver's computation starts at the top and proceeds to the bottom.]]

The reader should again be cautioned that such diagrams represent a snapshot of their table frozen in time, ''not'' the course ("trajectory") of a computation ''through'' time and space. While every time the busy beaver machine "runs" it will always follow the same state-trajectory, this is not true for the "copy" machine that can be provided with variable input "parameters".

The diagram "Progress of the computation" shows the three-state busy beaver's "state" (instruction) progress through its computation from start to finish. On the far right is the Turing "complete configuration" (Kleene "situation"&lt;!-- Stuation? Not Situation? Is that the right word? Yes, it is, cf. page 375 for example "The Godel number of the stiuation..." and then he shows a tape, etc. This usage runs throughout the chapter. wvbailey~~~~ --&gt;&lt;!--So is it "stuation" or "stiuation"?--&gt;, Hopcroft–Ullman "instantaneous description") at each step. If the machine were to be stopped and cleared to blank both the "state register" and entire tape, these "configurations" could be used to rekindle a computation anywhere in its progress (cf. Turing (1936) ''The Undecidable'', pp.&amp;nbsp;139–140).

==Models equivalent to the Turing machine model==
{{See also|Turing machine equivalents|Register machine|Post–Turing machine}}

Many machines that might be thought to have more computational capability than a simple universal Turing machine can be shown to have no more power (Hopcroft and Ullman p.&amp;nbsp;159, cf. Minsky (1967)). They might compute faster, perhaps, or use less memory, or their instruction set might be smaller, but they cannot compute more powerfully (i.e. more mathematical functions). (Recall that the [[Church–Turing thesis]] ''hypothesizes'' this to be true for any kind of machine: that anything that can be "computed" can be computed by some Turing machine.)

A Turing machine is equivalent to a single-stack [[pushdown automaton]] (PDA) that has been made more flexible and concise by relaxing the [[LIFO (computing)|last-in-first-out]] requirement of its stack. In addition, a Turing machine is also equivalent to a two-stack PDA with standard [[LIFO (computing)|last-in-first-out]] semantics, by using one stack to model the right side and the other stack to model the left side of the Turing machine.

At the other extreme, some very simple models turn out to be [[Turing completeness|Turing-equivalent]], i.e. to have the same computational power as the Turing machine model.

Common equivalent models are the [[multi-tape Turing machine]], [[multi-track Turing machine]], machines with input and output, and the [[Non-deterministic Turing machine|''non-deterministic'' Turing machine]] (NDTM) as opposed to the ''deterministic'' Turing machine (DTM) for which the action table has at most one entry for each combination of symbol and state.

[[Read-only right moving Turing machines|Read-only, right-moving Turing machines]] are equivalent to [[Nondeterministic finite automaton|NDFAs]] (as well as [[Deterministic finite automaton|DFAs]] by conversion using the [[NDFA to DFA conversion algorithm]]).

For practical and didactical intentions the equivalent [[register machine]] can be used as a usual [[Assembly language|assembly]] [[programming language]].

An interesting question is whether the computation model represented by concrete [[programming languages]] is Turing equivalent. While the computation of a real computer is based on finite states and thus not capable to simulate a Turing machine, programming languages themselves do not necessarily have this limitation. Kirner et al., 2009 have shown that among the general-purpose programming languages some are Turing complete while others are not. For example, [[ANSI C]] is not Turing-equivalent, as all instantiations of ANSI C (different instantiations are possible as the standard deliberately leaves certain behaviour undefined for legacy reasons) imply a finite-space memory. This is because the size of memory reference data types is accessible inside the language. However, other programming languages like [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] do not have this feature, which allows them to be Turing complete in principle. 
It is just Turing complete in principle, as [[memory allocation]] in a programming language is allowed to fail, which means the programming language can be Turing complete when ignoring failed memory allocations, but the compiled programs executable on a real computer cannot.

==Choice c-machines, oracle o-machines==
Early in his paper (1936) Turing makes a distinction between an "automatic machine"—its "motion ... completely determined by the configuration" and a "choice machine":

{{quote|...whose motion is only partially determined by the configuration ... When such a machine reaches one of these ambiguous configurations, it cannot go on until some arbitrary choice has been made by an external operator. This would be the case if we were using machines to deal with axiomatic systems.|''The Undecidable'', p. 118}}

Turing (1936) does not elaborate further except in a footnote in which he describes how to use an a-machine to "find all the provable formulae of the [Hilbert] calculus" rather than use a choice machine. He "suppose[s] that the choices are always between two possibilities 0 and 1. Each proof will then be determined by a sequence of choices i&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, i&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., i&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (i&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 or 1, i&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 or 1, ..., i&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 or 1), and hence the number 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; + i&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt; + i&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... +i&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; completely determines the proof. The automatic machine carries out successively proof 1, proof 2, proof 3, ..." (Footnote ‡, ''The Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;138)

This is indeed the technique by which a deterministic (i.e. a-) Turing machine can be used to mimic the action of a [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]; Turing solved the matter in a footnote and appears to dismiss it from further consideration.

An [[oracle machine]] or o-machine is a Turing a-machine that pauses its computation at state "'''o'''" while, to complete its calculation, it "awaits the decision" of "the oracle"—an unspecified entity "apart from saying that it cannot be a machine" (Turing (1939), ''The Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;166–168).

==Universal Turing machines==
{{Main|Universal Turing machine}}

[[File:Model of a Turing machine.jpg|thumb|An implementation of a Turing machine]]
As Turing wrote in ''The Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;128 (italics added):
{{quote|It is possible to invent a ''single machine'' which can be used to compute ''any'' computable sequence. If this machine '''U''' is supplied with the tape on the beginning of which is written the string of quintuples separated by semicolons of some computing machine '''M''', then '''U''' will compute the same sequence as '''M'''.}}

This finding is now taken for granted, but at the time (1936) it was considered astonishing. The model of computation that Turing called his "universal machine"—"'''U'''" for short—is considered by some (cf. Davis (2000)) to have been the fundamental theoretical breakthrough that led to the notion of the [[stored-program computer]].

{{quote|Turing's paper ... contains, in essence, the invention of the modern computer and some of the programming techniques that accompanied it.|Minsky (1967), p. 104}}

In terms of [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]], a multi-tape universal Turing machine need only be slower by [[logarithm]]ic factor compared to the machines it simulates. This result was obtained in 1966 by F. C. Hennie and [[R. E. Stearns]]. (Arora and Barak, 2009, theorem 1.9)

==Comparison with real machines==
[[File:Lego Turing Machine.jpg|thumb|A Turing machine realisation in [[Lego]]]]
It is often said{{By whom|date=February 2016}} that Turing machines, unlike simpler automata, are as powerful as real machines, and are able to execute any operation that a real program can. What is neglected in this statement is that, because a real machine can only have a finite number of ''configurations'', this "real machine" is really nothing but a [[linear bounded automaton]]. On the other hand, Turing machines are equivalent to machines that have an unlimited amount of storage space for their computations. However, Turing machines are not intended to model computers, but rather they are intended to model computation itself. Historically, computers, which compute only on their (fixed) internal storage, were developed only later.

There are a number of ways to explain why Turing machines are useful models of real computers:

# Anything a real computer can compute, a Turing machine can also compute. For example: "A Turing machine can simulate any type of subroutine found in programming languages, including recursive procedures and any of the known parameter-passing mechanisms" (Hopcroft and Ullman p.&amp;nbsp;157). A large enough FSA can also model any real computer, disregarding IO. Thus, a statement about the limitations of Turing machines will also apply to real computers.
# The difference lies only with the ability of a Turing machine to manipulate an unbounded amount of data. However, given a finite amount of time, a Turing machine (like a real machine) can only manipulate a finite amount of data.
# Like a Turing machine, a real machine can have its storage space enlarged as needed, by acquiring more disks or other storage media.
# Descriptions of real machine programs using simpler abstract models are often much more complex than descriptions using Turing machines. For example, a Turing machine describing an algorithm may have a few hundred states, while the equivalent deterministic finite automaton (DFA) on a given real machine has quadrillions. This makes the DFA representation infeasible to analyze.
# Turing machines describe algorithms independent of how much memory they use. There is a limit to the memory possessed by any current machine, but this limit can rise arbitrarily in time. Turing machines allow us to make statements about algorithms which will (theoretically) hold forever, regardless of advances in ''conventional'' computing machine architecture.
# Turing machines simplify the statement of algorithms. Algorithms running on Turing-equivalent abstract machines are usually more general than their counterparts running on real machines, because they have arbitrary-precision data types available and never have to deal with unexpected conditions (including, but not limited to, running [[out of memory]]).

===Limitations of Turing machines===

====Computational complexity theory====
{{further|Computational complexity theory}}

A limitation of Turing machines is that they do not model the strengths of a particular arrangement well. For instance, modern stored-program computers are actually instances of a more specific form of [[abstract machine]] known as the [[random-access stored-program machine]] or RASP machine model. Like the [[universal Turing machine]] the RASP stores its "program" in "memory" external to its finite-state machine's "instructions". Unlike the universal Turing machine, the RASP has an infinite number of distinguishable, numbered but unbounded "registers"—memory "cells" that can contain any integer (cf. Elgot and Robinson (1964), Hartmanis (1971), and in particular Cook-Rechow (1973); references at [[random access machine]]). The RASP's finite-state machine is equipped with the capability for indirect addressing (e.g. the contents of one register can be used as an address to specify another register); thus the RASP's "program" can address any register in the register-sequence. The upshot of this distinction is that there are computational optimizations that can be performed based on the memory indices, which are not possible in a general Turing machine; thus when Turing machines are used as the basis for bounding running times, a 'false lower bound' can be proven on certain algorithms' running times (due to the false simplifying assumption of a Turing machine). An example of this is [[binary search]], an algorithm that can be shown to perform more quickly when using the RASP model of computation rather than the Turing machine model.

====Concurrency====
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
Another limitation of Turing machines is that they do not model concurrency well. For example, there is a bound on the size of integer that can be computed by an always-halting nondeterministic Turing machine starting on a blank tape. (See article on [[unbounded nondeterminism]].) By contrast, there are always-halting concurrent systems with no inputs that can compute an integer of unbounded size. (A process can be created with local storage that is initialized with a count of 0 that concurrently sends itself both a stop and a go message. When it receives a go message, it increments its count by 1 and sends itself a go message. When it receives a stop message, it stops with an unbounded number in its local storage.)

====Interaction====
In the early days of computing, computer use was typically limited to [[batch processing]], i.e., non-interactive tasks, each producing output data from given input data. Computability theory, which studies computability of functions from inputs to outputs, and for which Turing machines were invented, reflects this practice.

Since the 1970s, [[interactivity|interactive]] use of computers became much more common.  In principle, it is possible to model this by having an external agent read from the tape and write to it at the same time as a Turing machine, but this rarely matches how interaction actually happens; therefore, when describing interactivity, alternatives such as [[Input/output automaton|I/O automata]] are usually preferred.

{{See also|Algorithm|Church–Turing thesis}}

They were described in 1936 by [[Alan Turing]].

===Historical background: computational machinery===
[[Robin Gandy]] (1919–1995)—a student of [[Alan Turing]] (1912–1954) and his lifelong friend—traces the lineage of the notion of "calculating machine" back to [[Charles Babbage]] (circa 1834) and actually proposes "Babbage's Thesis":

{{quote|''That the whole of development and operations of analysis are now capable of being executed by machinery''.|(italics in Babbage as cited by Gandy, p. 54)}}

Gandy's analysis of Babbage's [[Analytical Engine]] describes the following five operations (cf. p.&amp;nbsp;52–53):
# The arithmetic functions +, −, ×, where − indicates "proper" subtraction {{nowrap|''x'' − ''y'' {{=}} 0}} if {{nowrap|''y'' ≥ ''x''}}.
# Any sequence of operations is an operation.
# Iteration of an operation (repeating n times an operation P).
# Conditional iteration (repeating n times an operation P conditional on the "success" of test T).
# Conditional transfer (i.e. conditional "[[goto]]").

Gandy states that "the functions which can be calculated by (1), (2), and (4) are precisely those which are [[Turing computable]]." (p.&amp;nbsp;53). He cites other proposals for "universal calculating machines" including those of [[Percy Ludgate]] (1909), [[Leonardo Torres y Quevedo]] (1914), [[Maurice d'Ocagne]] (1922), [[Louis Couffignal]] (1933), [[Vannevar Bush]] (1936), [[Howard Aiken]] (1937). However:

{{quote|… the emphasis is on programming a fixed iterable sequence of arithmetical operations. The fundamental importance of conditional iteration and conditional transfer for a general theory of calculating machines is not recognized…|Gandy p. 55}}

===The Entscheidungsproblem (the "decision problem"): Hilbert's tenth question of 1900===
With regard to [[Hilbert's problems]] posed by the famous mathematician [[David Hilbert]] in 1900, an aspect of problem #10 had been floating about for almost 30 years before it was framed precisely. Hilbert's original expression for #10 is as follows:

{{quote|'''10. Determination of the solvability of a Diophantine equation'''. Given a [[Diophantine equation]] with any number of unknown quantities and with rational integral coefficients: To devise a process according to which it can be determined in a finite number of operations whether the equation is solvable in rational integers.

The Entscheidungsproblem [decision problem for [[first-order logic]]] is solved when we know a procedure that allows for any given logical expression to decide by finitely many operations its validity or satisfiability ... The Entscheidungsproblem must be considered the main problem of mathematical logic.|quoted, with this translation and the original German, in Dershowitz and Gurevich, 2008}}

By 1922, this notion of "[[Entscheidungsproblem]]" had developed a bit, and [[Heinrich Behmann|H. Behmann]] stated that

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;most general form of the Entscheidungsproblem [is] as follows:
:A quite definite generally applicable prescription is required which will allow one to decide in a finite number of steps the truth or falsity of a given purely logical assertion ...|Gandy p. 57, quoting Behmann}}
{{quote|Behmann remarks that ... the general problem is equivalent to the problem of deciding which mathematical propositions are true.|''ibid.''}}
{{quote|If one were able to solve the Entscheidungsproblem then one would have a "procedure for solving many (or even all) mathematical problems".|''ibid.'', p. 92}}

By the 1928 international congress of mathematicians, Hilbert "made his questions quite precise. First, was mathematics ''[[Completeness (logic)|complete]]'' ... Second, was mathematics ''[[Consistency proof|consistent]]'' ... And thirdly, was mathematics ''[[Decidability (logic)|decidable]]''?" (Hodges p.&amp;nbsp;91, Hawking p.&amp;nbsp;1121). The first two questions were answered in 1930 by [[Kurt Gödel]] at the very same meeting where Hilbert delivered his retirement speech (much to the chagrin of Hilbert); the third—the Entscheidungsproblem—had to wait until the mid-1930s.

The problem was that an answer first required a precise definition of "''definite general applicable prescription''", which Princeton professor [[Alonzo Church]] would come to call "[[effective calculability]]", and in 1928 no such definition existed. But over the next 6–7 years [[Emil Post]] developed his definition of a worker moving from room to room writing and erasing marks per a list of instructions (Post 1936), as did Church and his two students [[Stephen Kleene]] and [[J. B. Rosser]] by use of Church's [[lambda-calculus]] and Gödel's [[recursion theory]] (1934). Church's paper (published 15 April 1936) showed that the Entscheidungsproblem was indeed "undecidable" and beat Turing to the punch by almost a year (Turing's paper submitted 28 May 1936, published January 1937). In the meantime, Emil Post submitted a brief paper in the fall of 1936, so Turing at least had priority over Post. While Church refereed Turing's paper, Turing had time to study Church's paper and add an Appendix where he sketched a proof that Church's lambda-calculus and his machines would compute the same functions.

{{quote|But what Church had done was something rather different, and in a certain sense weaker. ... the Turing construction was more direct, and provided an argument from first principles, closing the gap in Church's demonstration.|Hodges p. 112}}

And Post had only proposed a definition of [[Church–Turing thesis|calculability]] and criticized Church's "definition", but had proved nothing.

===Alan Turing's a-machine===
In the spring of 1935, Turing as a young Master's student at [[King's College Cambridge]], [[UK]], took on the challenge; he had been stimulated by the lectures of the logician [[M. H. A. Newman]] "and learned from them of Gödel's work and the Entscheidungsproblem ... Newman used the word 'mechanical' ... In his obituary of Turing 1955 Newman writes:

{{quote|To the question 'what is a "mechanical" process?' Turing returned the characteristic answer 'Something that can be done by a machine' and he embarked on the highly congenial task of analysing the general notion of a computing machine.|Gandy, p. 74}}

Gandy states that:

{{quote|I suppose, but do not know, that Turing, right from the start of his work, had as his goal a proof of the undecidability of the Entscheidungsproblem. He told me that the 'main idea' of the paper came to him when he was lying in Grantchester meadows in the summer of 1935. The 'main idea' might have either been his analysis of computation or his realization that there was a universal machine, and so a [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]] to prove unsolvability.|''ibid.'', p. 76}}

While Gandy believed that Newman's statement above is "misleading", this opinion is not shared by all. Turing had a lifelong interest in machines: "Alan had dreamt of inventing typewriters as a boy; [his mother] Mrs. Turing had a typewriter; and he could well have begun by asking himself what was meant by calling a typewriter 'mechanical'" (Hodges p.&amp;nbsp;96). While at Princeton pursuing his PhD, Turing built a Boolean-logic multiplier (see below). His PhD thesis, titled "Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals", contains the following definition of "a computable function":

{{quote|It was stated above that 'a function is effectively calculable if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process'. We may take this statement literally, understanding by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine. It is possible to give a mathematical description, in a certain normal form, of the structures of these machines. The development of these ideas leads to the author's definition of a computable function, and to an identification of computability with effective calculability. It is not difficult, though somewhat laborious, to prove that these three definitions [the 3rd is the λ-calculus] are equivalent.|Turing (1939) in ''The Undecidable'', p. 160}}

When Turing returned to the UK he ultimately became jointly responsible for breaking the German secret codes created by encryption machines called "The Enigma"; he also became involved in the design of the ACE ([[Automatic Computing Engine]]), "[Turing's] ACE proposal was effectively self-contained, and its roots lay not in the [[EDVAC]] [the USA's initiative], but in his own universal machine" (Hodges p.&amp;nbsp;318). Arguments still continue concerning the origin and nature of what has been named by Kleene (1952) [[Turing's Thesis]]. But what Turing ''did prove'' with his computational-machine model appears in his paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" (1937):

{{quote|[that] the Hilbert Entscheidungsproblem can have no solution ... I propose, therefore to show that there can be no general process for determining whether a given formula U of the functional calculus K is provable, i.e. that there can be no machine which, supplied with any one U of these formulae, will eventually say whether U is provable.|from Turing's paper as reprinted in ''The Undecidable'', p. 145}}

Turing's example (his second proof): If one is to ask for a general procedure to tell us: "Does this machine ever print 0", the question is "undecidable".

===1937–1970: The "digital computer", the birth of "computer science"===
In 1937, while at Princeton working on his PhD thesis, Turing built a digital (Boolean-logic) multiplier from scratch, making his own electromechanical relays (Hodges p.&amp;nbsp;138). "Alan's task was to embody the logical design of a Turing machine in a network of relay-operated switches ..." (Hodges p.&amp;nbsp;138). While Turing might have been just initially curious and experimenting, quite-earnest work in the same direction was going in Germany ([[Konrad Zuse]] (1938)), and in the United States ([[Howard Aiken]]) and [[George Stibitz]] (1937); the fruits of their labors were used by both the Axis and Allied militaries in [[World War II]] (cf. Hodges p.&amp;nbsp;298–299). In the early to mid-1950s [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]] and [[Marvin Minsky]] reduced the Turing machine to a simpler form (a precursor to the [[Post–Turing machine]] of [[Martin Davis]]); simultaneously European researchers were reducing the new-fangled [[electronic computer]] to a computer-like theoretical object equivalent to what was now being called a "Turing machine". In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the coincidentally parallel developments of Melzak and Lambek (1961), Minsky (1961), and Shepherdson and Sturgis (1961) carried the European work further and reduced the Turing machine to a more friendly, computer-like abstract model called the [[counter machine]]; Elgot and Robinson (1964), Hartmanis (1971), Cook and Reckhow (1973) carried this work even further with the [[register machine]] and [[random-access machine]] models—but basically all are just multi-tape Turing machines with an arithmetic-like instruction set.

===1970–present: the Turing machine as a model of computation===
Today, the counter, register and random-access machines and their sire the Turing machine continue to be the models of choice for theorists investigating questions in the [[theory of computation]]. In particular, [[computational complexity theory]] makes use of the Turing machine:

{{quote|Depending on the objects one likes to manipulate in the computations (numbers like nonnegative integers or alphanumeric strings), two models have obtained a dominant position in machine-based complexity theory:
:''the off-line multitape Turing machine''..., which represents the standard model for string-oriented computation, and
:the ''random access machine (RAM)'' as introduced by Cook and Reckhow ..., which models the idealized Von Neumann style computer.|van Emde Boas 1990:4}}
{{quote|Only in the related area of analysis of algorithms this role is taken over by the RAM model.|van Emde Boas 1990:16}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16243">McKinney{{who|date=November 2018}} defines '''vocal resonance''' as "the process by which the basic product of [[phonation]] is enhanced in [[timbre]] and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air."&lt;ref&gt;McKinney, James (1994) The Diagnosis and Correction of Vocal Faults, Nashville, TN: Genovex Music Group.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the vocal literature, various terms related to resonation are used, including: amplification, filtering, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation. Acoustic authorities would question many of these terms from a strictly scientific perspective. However, the main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the result of resonation is to make a "better" sound, or at least suitable to a certain esthetical and practical domain.

== Human resonating chambers ==
The voice, like all acoustic instruments such as the guitar, trumpet, piano, or violin, has its own special chambers for resonating the tone. Once the tone is produced by the vibrating vocal cords, it vibrates in and through the open resonating ducts and chambers. Since the vocal tract is often associated with different regions of the body, different resonance chambers might be referred to as: chest, mouth, nose/"mask", or head.

In more symbolic/perceptual way, rather than physical, the various terms applied can represent vocal "colors" in a continuous scale: from dark (''chest'') resonance to bright (''head-nasal'') resonance. We may call this spectrum a resonance track. In the lower range, the chest/dark color predominates; in the middle range, the mouth-nasal resonance is dominant; and in the higher range, the head-nasal resonance (bright color) predominates. The objective of using such images by several teachers and coaches is to achieve command of all the "colors of the spectrum". That, ultimately, may allow a greater scope of emotional expression. The emotional content of the lyric or phrase suggests the color and volume of the tone and is the personal choice of the artist.

*'''Head resonance''' should not be confused with head register or falsetto. It is used primarily for softer singing in either register throughout the range.
*'''Mouth resonance''' is used for a conversational vocal color in singing and, in combination with nasal resonance, it creates forward placement or mask resonance.
*'''Chest resonance''' adds richer, darker, and deeper tone coloring for a sense of power, warmth, and sensuality. It creates a feeling of depth and drama in the voice.
*'''Nasal''' ('''mask resonance''') is present at all times in a well-produced tone, except perhaps in pure head tone or at very soft volume. Nasal resonance is bright and edgy and is used in combination with mouth resonance to create forward placement (mask resonance). In an over-all sense, it adds overtones that give clarity and projection to the voice.

There are some singers who are recognized by their pronounced nasal quality; whereas others are noted for their deep, dark, and ''chesty'' sound; and still others are noted for their breathy or heady sound; and so on. In part, such individuality depends on the structure of the singer's vocal instrument, that is, the inherent shape and size of the vocal cords and of the vocal tract.

The quality or color of a voice also depends on the singer's ability to develop and use various resonances by controlling the shape and size of the chambers through which the sound flows. It has been demonstrated electrographically in the form of "voice-prints" that, like fingerprints, no two voices are exactly alike.&lt;ref name="Austin"&gt;

== Sympathetic and Forced Vibration ==
In a technical sense resonance is a relationship that exists between two bodies vibrating at the same frequency or a multiple thereof. In other words, the vibrations emanating from one body cause the other body to start vibrating in tune with it. A resonator may be defined as a secondary vibrator which is set into motion by the main vibrator and which adds its own characteristics to the generated sound waves.&lt;ref name=McKinney&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two kinds of resonance: ''sympathetic resonance'' (or free resonance) and ''forced resonance'' (or conductive resonance)&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, Scott (2004) Your Voice: An Inside View. Princeton, NJ: Inside View Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The essential difference between both types is what causes the resonator to start vibrating. In sympathetic resonance there is no need of a direct physical contact between the two bodies. The resonator starts functioning because it receives vibrations through the air and responds to them sympathetically, as long as the resonator's natural frequencies of vibration coincides with the exciting oscillations. In forced resonance the resonator starts vibrating because it is in physical contact with a vibrating body, which "forces" the resonator to replicate its oscillations.&lt;ref name=Vennard&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both types of resonance are at work in the human voice during speaking and singing. Much of the vibration felt by singers while singing is a result of forced resonance. The waves originated by the airflow modulated by the vibrating vocal folds travel along the bones, cartilages, and muscles of the neck, head, and upper chest, causing them to vibrate by forced resonance. There is little evidence that these vibrations, sensed by tactile nerves, make any significant contribution to the external sound.&lt;ref name=Greene&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These same forced vibrations, however, may serve as sensation guides for the singer, regardless of their effect on the external sound. These sensations may provide evidence to the singer that their [[vocal folds]] are forming strong primary vibrations which are being carried from them to the head and chest. Thus these vibratory sensations can supply [[sensory feedback]] about the efficiency of the whole phonatory process to the singer.
 
In contrast, the sound a person hears from a singer is a product of sympathetic resonance. Air vibrations generated at the level of the [[vocal folds]] in the [[larynx]] propagate through the [[vocal tract]] (e.g. the ducts and cavities of the airways). In other words, the voice’s resultant [[glottal wave]] is filtered by the vocal tract: a phenomenon of sympathetic resonance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Sundberg, Johan(1989). The Science of the Singing Voice, Northern Illinois University Press,{{ISBN|0875805426}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vocal resonator is not a [[sounding board]] comparable with [[stringed instruments]]. Rather, it’s a column of air traveling through the vocal tract, with a shape that is not only complex, but highly variable. Vennard says:

{{blockquote|Thus it may vibrate as a whole or in any of its parts. It should not be too hard to think of it as vibrating several ways at once. Indeed most vibrators do this, otherwise we would not have timbre, which consists of several frequencies of different intensities sounding together. Air is fully as capable of this as any other medium; indeed, the sounds of many diverse instruments are carried to the ear by the same air, are funnelled into the same tiny channel, and can still be heard as one sound or as sounds from the individual sources, depending upon the manner in which we give attention.&lt;ref name=Vennard /&gt;}}

==Factors affecting resonators==
There are a number of factors which determine the resonance characteristics of a resonator. Included among them are the following: size, shape, type of opening, composition and thickness of the walls, surface, and combined resonators. The quality of a sound can be appreciably changed by rather small variations in these conditioning factors.&lt;ref name=Greene /&gt;

In general, the larger a resonator is, the lower the frequency it will respond to; the greater the volume of air, the lower its pitch. But the pitch also will be affected by the shape of resonator and by the size of opening and amount of lip or neck the resonator has.&lt;ref name=McKinney /&gt;

A conical shaped resonator, such as a [[megaphone]], tends to amplify all pitches indiscriminately. A cylindrical shaped resonator is affected primarily by the length of the tube through which the sound wave travels. A spherical resonator will be affected by the amount of opening it has and by whether or not that opening has a lip.&lt;ref name=Greene /&gt;

Three factors relating to the walls of a resonator will affect how it functions: the material it is made of, the thickness of its walls, and the type of surface it has. The resonance characteristics of a musical instrument obviously will vary with different materials and the amount of material used will have some effect.&lt;ref name=McKinney /&gt;

Of special importance to singing is the relationship of the surface of a resonator to its tonal characteristics. Resonators can be highly selective-meaning that they will respond to only one frequency (or multiples of it)-or they can be universal-meaning that they can respond to a broad range of frequencies. In general, the harder the surface of the resonator, the more selective it will be, and the softer the surface, the more universal it will become. "[A] hard resonator will respond only when the vibrator contains an overtone that is exactly in tune with the resonator, while a soft resonator permits a wide range of fundamentals to pass through un-dampened but adds its own frequency as on overtone, harmonic or inharmonic as the case may be."&lt;ref name=Vennard /&gt;&lt;!-- Vennard p.85 errs in physics here. He should have said "more" vice "only", "wider" vice "wide", "less-" vice "un-" and omitted the "adds its own frequency" which is caused not by softness but by nonlinearity. --&gt;

Hardness carried to the extreme will result in a penetrating tone with a few very strong high partials. Softness carried to the extreme will result in a mushy, non-directional tone of little character. Between these two extremes lies a whole gamut of tonal possibilities.&lt;ref name=McKinney /&gt;
 
The final factor to be mentioned is the effect of joining two or more resonators together. In general, the effect of joining two or more resonators is that the resonant frequency of each is lowered in different proportions according to their capacities, their orifices, and so forth. The rules governing combined resonators apply to the human voice: for the throat, mouth and sometimes the nose all function in this manner.&lt;ref name=McKinney /&gt;

==The vocal resonators in detail==
[[File:Thoracic landmarks anterior view.svg|thumb|Chest anatomy]]  
There are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators. In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the chest, the tracheal tree, the larynx itself, the pharynx, the oral cavity, the nasal cavity, and the sinuses.&lt;ref name=Greene /&gt;

===The chest===
The chest is not an effective resonator, despite numerous voice books and teachers referring to “chest resonance”. Although strong vibratory sensations may be experienced in the upper chest, it can make no significant contribution to the resonance system of the voice, simply by virtue of its structure and location. The chest is mostly connected to the upstream structures of the airways, such as the lungs and trachea (e.g. under the [[vocal folds]]). There, it has a high degree of vibrational absorption, with little or no acoustical function to reflect sound waves back toward the [[larynx]].&lt;ref name=McKinney /&gt;

===The tracheal tree===
[[File:Throat Diagram.png|thumb|300px|right|throat diagram]]
The tracheal tree makes no significant contribution to the resonance system except for a negative effect around its resonant frequency. The [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and the [[bronchial tubes]] combine to form an inverted Y-shaped structure known as the tracheal tree. It lies just below the [[larynx]], and, unlike the interior of the [[lungs]], has a definite tubular shape and comparatively hard surfaces. The response of the tracheal tree is the same for all pitches except for its own resonant frequency. When this resonant frequency is reached, the response of the subglottic tube is to act as an acoustical impedance or interference which tends to upset the [[phonatory]] function of the [[larynx]]. Research has placed the resonant frequency of the subglottal system or tracheal tree around the E-flat above "middle C" for both men and women, varying somewhat with the size of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
|last=Van den Berg 
|first= J.W.
|date=December 1963
|title= Vocal Ligaments versus Registers
|journal= The NATS Bulletin
|volume= 19
|pages= 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The larynx===
Due to its small size, the [[larynx]] acts as a resonator only for high frequencies. Research indicates that one of the desirable attributes of good vocal tone is a prominent overtone lying between 2800 and 3200 hertz, with male voices nearer the lower limit and female voices nearer the upper. This attribute is identified as brilliance, or more frequently as ''ring'' or the ''singer's formant'', as fully described by Sundberg.&lt;ref&gt;Sundberg, Johan(1974). Articulatory interpretation of the "singing formant". J Acoust Soc Am. 1974 Apr;55(4):838–844.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several areas in or adjacent to the larynx which might resonate such a high pitch. Among them are the collar of the larynx, the ventricles of Morgani, the vallecula, and the pyriform sinuses. The larynx is not under conscious control, but whatever produces "ring" can be encouraged indirectly by awareness on the part of the student and the teacher of the sounds which contain it.

=== The pharynx ===
The [[human pharynx|pharynx]] is the most important resonator by virtue of its position, size, and degree of adjustability. It is the first cavity of any size through which the product of the laryngeal vibrator passes; the other supraglottal cavities have to accept whatever the pharynx passes on to them. Greene states:

"The supraglottic resonators being in the main muscular and moveable structures must be voluntarily controlled to produce conditions of optimal resonance either by varying degrees of tension in their walls, or by alterations in the size of their orifices and cavities during the articulatory movements."

=== The oral cavity ===
[[File:Illu01 head neck.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]
The oral cavity is the second most effective resonator&lt;ref name="Vennard" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

===The nasal cavity===
The nasal cavity is the third most effective resonator&lt;ref name="Vennard" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

===The sinuses===
In spite of being traditionally referred to, by many singers and teachers, as resonators, the sinuses consist of small closed air pockets, not acoustically connected to the vocal tract, and with no proven role in voice resonance&lt;ref name="Vennard" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. One could argue that head surface and deeper nerves close to the sinuses may detect passive vibrations entailed by the voice generated and transmitted across the vocal tract. These sensations might support the preservation of the image of the sinuses as effective resonators.

'''Vachaspati Mishra''' was a 9th- or 10th-century CE [[India]]n [[philosopher]]. He wrote so broadly that he was known as "one for whom all systems are his own", or in Sanskrit, a ''sarva-tantra-sva-tantra''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Stephen|date=2015|title=Seeing From the Other’s Point of View: Counter the Schismatic Interpretation of Vācaspati Miśra|url=http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.apaonline.org/resource/collection/2EAF6689-4B0D-4CCB-9DC6-FB926D8FF530/AsianV14n2.pdf|journal=APA Newsletter: Asian and Asian-American Philosophers and Philosophies|volume=14:2|pages=4--8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vācaspati Miśra was a prolific scholar and his writings are extensive, including [[bhasya]] (commentaries) on key texts of almost every 9th-century school of [[Hindu philosophy]] with notes on non-Hindu or ''nāstika'' traditions such as [[Buddhism]] and [[Charvaka|Carvaka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''Hindu Realism''|author=Jagadisha Chandra Chatterji|pages=vi|year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=larsonvm301&gt;Gerald James Larson and Ram Shankar Bhattacharya (1987), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 4, Princeton University Press, pages 301-312&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote one non-commentary, ''Tattvabindu,'' or ''Drop of Truth'', which focuses on Mīmāṃsā theories of sentence meaning. Some of his works are lost to history or yet to be found.&lt;ref name=larsonvm301/&gt;

Little is known about Vācaspati Miśra's life, and the earliest text that has been dated with certainty is from 840 CE, and he was at least one generation younger than Adi Śaṅkara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Isaeva |first=Natalia |title=Shankara and Indian Philosophy |year=1993 |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=USA |isbn=978-0-7914-1281-7|pages=85-86}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an alternate date for the same text may be 976 CE, according to some scholars, a confusion that is based on whether Hindu Śaka or Vikrama era calendar is used for the dating purposes.&lt;ref name=larsonvm301/&gt; His scholarship is revered in the Hindu tradition, which believes that he was a Maithila [[Brahmin]] from Andhra Tharhi 
[[Bihar]].&lt;ref name=larsonvm301/&gt;

==Primary works==
{{Refimprove-section|date=January 2008}}
''Tattvabindu'' is his original work, wherein he develops principles of [[hermeneutics]], and discusses the "Theory of Meaning" for the Mīmāṃsā school of Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref name=larsonvm301/&gt; This is an influential work, and attempted to resolve some of the interpretation disputes on classical Sanskrit texts.

Vācaspati examines five competing theories of linguistic meaning:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contribution of Vācaspati Miśra to Indian Philosoph|last=Ranganath|first=S.|publisher=Pratibha Prakashan|year=1999|isbn=|location=Delhi|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mandana Misra]]'s (''sphoṭavāda''), which involves grasping the meaning of a word or sentence by perceiving a ''[[sphoṭa]]'' or single holistic sound, which is distinct from the elements (sounds or characters) that make up the word or sentence; 
*the [[Nyāya]] theory which involves concatenating the memory traces (''saṃskāra'') of momentary components of a word or sentence when we hear the final momentary component; 
*the similar [[Mimamsa|Mīmāmsā]] theory, according to which our grasp of the meaning of a sentence lies in the memory traces created by the words; and
*the [[Prābhākara Mīmāmsā]] theory, ''anvitābhidhānavāda'', "the view on which denotation is constituted by what is connected." On this view, sentence-meaning is derived from the meanings of its words, which is fully given only by syntactic relations with the other words &amp;mdash; no ''sphoṭa'' or memory traces are required; and
*the Bhāṭṭa Mīmāṃsā theory, ''abhihitānvayavāda,'' or "the view on which connection (anvaya) is constituted by what has been denoted." On this view, word-meaning is denoted entirely first (''abhihita'') and then individual word-meanings are connected by means of ''lakṣaṇā'' (implication.
Vācaspati concurs with the Bhāṭṭa view, when he employs in other contexts, such as the Nyāya sub-commentary, the ''Nyāya-vārttika-tātparya-ṭīkā,'' and the Tattva-vaiśāradī.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Secondary works: Bhāṣya==
Vācaspati Miśra is credited with influential commentaries such as ''Tattvakaumudi'' on [[Samkhyakarika|Sāṃkhyakārika]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Isaeva |first=Natalia |title=Shankara and Indian Philosophy |year=1993 |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=USA |isbn=978-0-7914-1281-7|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nyāyasucinibandha'' on [[Nyaya Sutras|Nyāya-sūtras]],&lt;ref name=jfowlerpor129/&gt; various important texts of [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita Vedānta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Isaeva |first=Natalia |title=Shankara and Indian Philosophy |year=1993 |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=USA |isbn=978-0-7914-1281-7|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nyāyakānika'' (an Advaita work on science of reason), ''Tattvasamikṣa'' (lost work), ''Nyāya-vārttika-tātparyaṭīkā'' (a subcommentary on the ''Nyāya-sūtras''), ''Tattva-vaiśāradī'' on [[Yogasutra|Yogasūtra]], and others.&lt;ref name=larsonvm301/&gt;

While some known works of Vācaspati Miśra are now lost, others exist in numerous numbers. Over ninety medieval era manuscripts, for example, in different parts of India have been found of his ''Tattvakaumudi'', which literally means "Moonlight on the Truth".&lt;ref name=larsonvm301/&gt; This suggests that his work was sought and influential. A critical edition of ''Tattvakaumudi'' was published by Srinivasan in 1967.&lt;ref name=larsonvm301/&gt;

'''William John Parry''' (28 March 1842 - 1927) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] businessman, politician and author. Parry was a leading voice in a range of activities and causes, and was the first general secretary of the [[North Wales Quarrymen's Union]].

Born in [[Bethesda, Gwynedd|Bethesda]] to John and Elizabeth,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llechicymru.info/IPSLWJParry.english.htm Slatesite]&lt;/ref&gt; Parry was a religious man who took a keen interest in the plight of the [[Slate industry in Wales|slate]] and stone [[quarry]] workers local to his home town. Parry took a prominent part in the creation of the North Wales Quarrymen's Union in 1874, and as well as taking the role as general secretary, later became the union's president. In 1879 he visited slate mines in the United States on the request of his union.

In 1889 Parry became a member of the very first [[Caernarfonshire]] County Council and became its president during 1892-1893.

Parry wrote for several local newspapers, in both the Welsh and English language, and published several books. Of note are his works ''y Ymdrafodaeth'' (1875) and ''The Penrhyn Lock-out'' (1900). Many of his papers and writings are held at [[Bangor University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archivesnetworkwales.info/cgi-bin/anw/search2?coll_id=10354&amp;inst_id=39&amp;term=Parry%20%7C%20W.%20J.%20%28William%20John%29%20%7C%201842-1927 Archives Network Wales]&lt;/ref&gt;
