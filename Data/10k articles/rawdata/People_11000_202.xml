During the '''2018 Winter Olympics Parade of Nations''' at the [[2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony]], beginning at 20:00 [[South Korea Standard Time|KST]] ([[UTC+09:00|UTC+9]]) on 9 February 2018, athletes bearing the flags of their respective nations led their national delegations as they paraded into the [[Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium]] in the host city of [[Pyeongchang]], South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC to Broadcast Winter Olympics Live Across all Time Zones|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/nbc-broadcast-winter-olympics-live-1202018114/|website=Variety|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 92 teams qualified to compete (91 nations and [[Olympic Athletes from Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics|Olympic Athletes from Russia]]).

'''Andrzej Niemojewski''' (24 January 1864 – 3 November 1921) was a Polish social and political activist, [[poet]], [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and writer of the [[Young Poland]] period.

== God Jesus ==

Niemojewski was best known as a proponent of the [[Christ myth theory]]. He was the author of ''Gott Jesus im Lichte fremder und eigener Forschungen samt Darstellung der evangelischen Astralstoffe, Astralszenen und Astralsysteme'' (1910). The book was translated in 1996 as ''God Jesus: The Sun, Moon and Stars as Background to the Gospel Stories'' (1910).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Niemojenski|first=Andrzej|authorlink=Andrzej Niemojewski|title=Gott jesus in Lichte fremder und eigener Forschungen samt Darstellung der evangelischen Astralstoffe, Astralszenen und Astralsysteme|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CNBGwAACAAJ|volume=1|year=1910|publisher=Huber}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Niemojewski|first1=Andrzej|authorlink1=Andrzej Niemojewski|last2=Meuss|first2=Anna|last3=MacDermot|first3=Violet|editor=Violet MacDermot|title=God Jesus: The Sun, Moon and Stars as Background to the Gospel Stories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giKeAAAACAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Janus Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-85756-264-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Schweitzer]] added two new chapters in the 1913 second edition of his ''[[Quest of the Historical Jesus]]''. (''Geschichte der Leben-Jesu-Forschung'', 2. Auflage, 1913)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2xtnOIhZAmgC&amp;pg=PA451&amp;dq=Schweitzer+bestreitung&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=VcSITOexH8zLswbjrv2mCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Schweitzer%20bestreitung&amp;f=false Albert Schweitzer, ''The Quest of the Historical Jesus'', 2d ed. 1913, Ch. 22, p. 451]&lt;/ref&gt; which features ''God Jesus'' in one chapter.

*Ch. 22, (p.&amp;nbsp;451–499), "The New Denial of the Historicity of Jesus" (''Die Neueste Bestreitung der Geschichtlichkeit Jesu'') analyzes Drews's thesis, plus eight writers in support of [[Arthur Drews|Arthur Drews's]] thesis about the non-existence of Jesus: [[J. M. Robertson]], [[Peter Jensen (Orientalist)|Peter Jensen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Peter Christian Albrecht Jensen |title= Hat der Jesus der Evangelien wirklich gelebt?: eine Antwort an Jülicher |year=1910 |publisher= Neuer Frankfurter Verlag |location= Frankfurt am Main |url= http://openlibrary.org/books/OL18686614M/Hat_der_Jesus_der_Evangelien_wirklich_gelebt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrzej Niemojewski, Christian Paul Fuhrmann,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fuhrmann |first=Christian Paul |title=Der Astralmythos von Christus: Die Lösung der Christussage durch Astrologie. Mit 1 Sternkarte und 1 Sternskizze |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=egfGtgAACAAJ |year=1911 |publisher= Brandstetter |language= German}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Benjamin Smith|W.B. Smith]], [[Thomas Whittaker (metaphysician)|Thomas Whittaker]], [[Gerard Bolland|G.J.P.J. Bolland]], [[Samuel Lublinski]]. Three of them favor mythic-astral explanations.

[[Arthur Drews]] featured ''God Jesus'' in his 1926 work, ''[[The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus in Past and Present]]''&amp;nbsp;;&lt;blockquote&gt;A. Niemojewski's main book appeared in 1910.  It also shows a divine Jesus preceding any rumours about a human one.  Contradictions in the Gospel tales prove that they are impossibly about one and the same person -- especially the sayings aren't from a single person.  The sayings are co-opted from Jewish common sources and stuffed into the mouth of the alleged master Jesus.

The most important part of the Gospels, besides the logia, are miracles.  One can't neglect them as the liberal Jesus proponents do, without destroying Christian scripture.  Miracles are proofs for the divinity of Jesus.  Falsely so-called proofs about the human Jesus, like Flavius Josephus, are easily dismissed as chatty hearsays or interpolations.

Niemojewski continues the line of Volney and Dupuis, by looking for parallels in astral mythology.  The Tanakh and Talmud are already full of astral mythological images, like the 12 Jewish tribes and sons of Jacob.  Even more, of course, the New Testament.  This is seen strongest in the Apocalypse of John.  The twin myth, applied to Jesus and John, is especially interesting for Niemojewski.  The constellation of Gemini plays a central role for Niemojewski.  The astral mythological elements are strongest in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke; Mark contains them only quite marginally.

In the end, Niemojewski's system was too confusing to get much consideration, when compared to simpler astral mythical interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drews|first=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur Drews|title=Die Leugnung der Geschichtlichkeit Jesu in Vergangenheit und Gegenwart. Karlsruhe 1926|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NvMOAAAAQAAJ|year=1926|publisher=G. Braun|language=German|quote=''The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus in Past and Present''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the Appendix of ''[[The Christ Myth#Christ Myth II – the witnesses to the historicity of Jesus (1912)|The Witnesses to the Historicity of Jesus]]'', Drews writes&amp;nbsp;;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we substitute for the “crucified” Orion of the twenty-second psalm the two other important celestial crosses the vernal cross with the Earn (Lamb) and the autumnal cross with the Cup (skull) below it, the Virgin, Berenice's Hair (''megaddela''=Mary Magdalene), etc.—we have all the astral elements of what Niemojewski calls the “astral ''via dolorosa''” (p. 413). May we suppose, in fine, that Orion itself plays the part of the crucified Saviour? In that case the (weeping) women at the cross are represented by the Pleiades (the “rainsisters”), one of which bears the name of Maja (Maria). The Pleiades also are hair-dressers (''megaddela''), as they are represented in medieval manuscripts on the basis of an old tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Boll, ''Spaera'', p. 380. Compare the drawing in Thiele's ''Antike Himmelsbilder'' (1898), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; and they culminate when Berenice's Hair rises above the eastern horizon. Electra is supposed to be the centre of the Pleiades. She is the mother of Jasios (Jesus), and is represented as a mourner with a cloth over her head, just in the same way as the Christian Mary. But as Jasios was also regarded, according to another genealogy, as the son of Maja, the mourning Pleiad may also stand for her. As is known, the mother of Jesus also is a dove (''peleids'', Pleiad) in the early Christian conception. 

According to Niemojewski, the cup (''gulguleth''= skull) represents the heavenly Golgotha. But we may refer it to the skull of the Bull and the head of Medusa, and regard “the place of skulls” as the region of the heavens where Orion is found. On this supposition the two evil-doers are recognised in the Twins, which we have already ascertained to be the astral criminals. Castor is regarded as evil on account of his relation to winter, and Pollux good on account of his relation to summer. Niemojewski sees the two evil-doers in the Dogs (Sirius and Procyon). The difference is not great, as the Dogs culminate at the same time as the Twins, and may therefore be substituted for them. 

Here we have firm ground on which to establish the originally astral and mythical character of the remainder of the story of Jesus, and we seem to have a very strong proof that there was a cult of “the crucified” before the time of Jesus, and that the nucleus of the figure of Jesus is in reality purely astral. 

All the oriental religions, including Judaism, are essentially astral religions. We have previously (p. 223) shown that ''Revelation'' is a Jewish-Gnostic work, the Jesus of which is more primitive than the Jesus of the gospels. But ''Revelation'' is entirely and certainly of an astral character. It is a further proof that Christianity is no exception to the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource

==Beatification==

{{Roman Catholicism}}
John Paul II's official title was "[[Bishop of Rome]], [[Vicar]] of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], Successor of [[Saint Peter]], Head of the [[College of Bishops]], Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, [[Patriarch of the West]], Primate of Italy, Archbishop and Metropolitan of the [[Roman province|Roman Province]], Sovereign of the State of the Vatican City, [[Servus Servorum Dei]], Pope John Paul II".&lt;ref name="ShortBio"/&gt;  In 2006 the title ''Patriarch of the West'' was removed from the papal list of titles by the succeeding pope, [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]], due to its obsolescence.

On 9 May 2005, Benedict XVI began the [[beatification]] process for his predecessor. Normally five years must pass after a person's death before the beatification process can begin. However, in an audience with Pope Benedict XVI, [[Cardinal Vicar]] [[Camillo Ruini]], the one responsible for promoting the [[Canonization|cause for canonisation]] of any person who dies within the [[diocese of Rome]], cited "exceptional circumstances" which suggested that the waiting period could be waived.&lt;ref name="MsnbcNews2"/&gt;

The "exceptional circumstances" may possibly refer to the people's cries of "Santo Subito!" ("Saint now!" in Italian) during [[Funeral of Pope John Paul II|the pontiff's funeral]].&lt;ref name="MsnbcNews2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4545585.stm|title=BBC News: ''‘On the fast track to Sainthood’'' |accessdate=2008-11-03 |publisher=BBC | date=13 May 2005 |first=Peter |last=Gould| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090106233926/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4545585.stm| archivedate=6 January 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hollingshead "&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/01/catholicism.religion|title=Whatever happened to ... canonising John Paul II?|last=Iain Hollingshead |first=Iain Hollingshead |date=April 1, 2006|publisher=2006–2009 [[Guardian News and Media]]|accessdate=2009-02-01 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hope"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article5927046.ece |title=Hopes raised for Pope John Paul II's beatification |work=The Times  |accessdate=2009-10-10 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Owen | date=17 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the new pope waived the five year rule "so that the cause of Beatification and Canonisation of the same [[Servant of God]] can begin immediately".&lt;ref name="Canonisation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/csaints/documents/rc_con_csaints_doc_20050509_rescritto-gpii_en.html|title=Response of His Holiness Benedict XVI for the examination of the cause for beatification and canonisation of the servant of God John Paul II|date=9 May 2005|work=Vatican News|publisher=2005–2009 ‘Libreria Editrice Vaticana’|accessdate=2009-01-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090105024819/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/csaints/documents/rc_con_csaints_doc_20050509_rescritto-gpii_en.html| archivedate= 5 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was announced on 13 May 2005, the Feast of [[Our Lady of Fátima]] and the 24th anniversary of the [[1981 Pope John Paul II assassination attempt|assassination attempt]] on John Paul II at St. Peter's Square.&lt;ref name="Zenit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=70889|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090626132926/http://www.zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=70889|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-06-26|title=Waiting Period Waived for John Paul II Benedict XVI Opens Predecessor's Cause of Beatification ROME|publisher=Innovative Media, Inc.|accessdate=2009-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Paul II often credited [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady]] of Fátima for preserving him on that day.

On 28 May 2006, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] said Mass before an estimated 900,000 people in John Paul II's native Poland. During his homily he encouraged prayers for the early [[canonization|canonisation]] of John Paul II and stated that he hoped canonisation would happen "in the near future".

On 8 March 2007 the [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicariate of Rome]] announced that the [[diocese|diocesan]] phase of John Paul's cause for beatification was at an end. Following a ceremony on 2 April 2007 – the second anniversary of the Pontiff's death – the cause proceeded to the scrutiny of the committee of lay, clerical, and episcopal members of the [[Roman Curia|Vatican's]] [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]], who will conduct an investigation of their own.&lt;ref name="Hollingshead "/&gt;&lt;ref name="Westcott"/&gt;

In October 2009, Rome's mayor Gianni Alemanno said that the beatification, likely to draw huge crowds, was expected to take place in 2010, but on 4 November 2009 Monsignor Slawomir Oder, [[postulator]] of the cause of beatification, said that it was not yet known when study of the case could be concluded.&lt;ref&gt;Wooden, Cindy (5 November 2009) [https://archive.is/20120724041258/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0904922.htm "Pope John Paul's legacy continues to touch people, cardinal says"].

Prior to the announcement of the beatification, some ecclesiastical authorities had expressed concern that the cure of Sister Marie-Simon-Pierre, and perhaps the cure of the boy who had cancer, may not be complete and lasting, as it has not been that long since the supposed miracles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/miracle-doubts-delay-sainthood-for-john-paul-ii-1917069.html | location=London |work=The Independent  | first=Michael | last=Day | title='Miracle' doubts delay sainthood for John Paul II | date=6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12191423 |work=BBC News | title=Pope paves way to beatification of John Paul II | date=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sister Marie's symptoms were analyzed very thoroughly before the beatification was announced (by the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints and its medical panel for the Pope's case) to make sure they were not actually [[wikt:psychogenic|psychogenic]], or related to another disease. The medical miracle was given a positive affirmation by the Congregation and its medical and theological panels, and by Pope Benedict. It would not have counted as a miracle if the cause was psychogenic and if the immediate physiological cure had not been judged to be definitive, total, and permanent, as well as directly attributable to his intercession.

Another reported miracle was that of [[Floribeth Mora Diaz]]. She was a Costa Rican lawyer who was cured of an incurable brain tumour. In this case neurosurgeon's were consulted by the authorities at the Vatican. Diaz was invited to the beatification ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/10162835/John-Paul-II-sainthood-was-the-recovery-of-brain-injured-woman-really-a-miracle.html|title=John Paul II sainthood: was the recovery of brain-injured woman really a miracle?|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-09-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Paul II has been [[Criticism of Pope John Paul II|criticised]] (more than perhaps any other issue) for not recognising the full severity of the sex abuse cases until they erupted in America in 2002. He has also been criticised for hindering&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/father-marcial-maciel-and-popes-he-stained-62811]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/father-marcial-maciel-dad-sexually-abused-raul-gonzalez-claims-lawsuit-article-1.181520|title=Father Marcial Maciel, was my dad, and he sexually abused me, Raul Gonzalez claims in lawsuit - NY Daily News | location=New York | work=Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globalpost.com"&gt;[http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/belief/legion-christ-pope-benedict-marcial-maciel]&lt;/ref&gt; the investigation into the charges of sexual immorality leveled against Father [[Marcial Maciel Degollado]] and for allowing diocesan bishops to transfer pedophile priests from one parish to another instead of reporting their crimes to the authorities. John Paul further stands accused of hindering [[Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger]] who allegedly was attempting to prevent sex abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article7086738.ece |location=London |work=The Times |first1=Bojan |last1=Pancevski |first2=John |last2=Follain |title=John Paul ignored abuse of 2000 boys |date=4 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531183440/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article7086738.ece |archivedate=31 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Pope Benedict stands accused of deliberately hushing up the abundance of public and private affection&lt;ref name="globalpost.com"/&gt; displayed between John Paul II and Father Marciel.  According to the ''National Catholic Reporter'', a recent leak of 212 Vatican documents shows a fuller story:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Ratzinger wanted to elevate John Paul to beatification," said [José] Barba, coauthor of ''La Voluntad de No Saber'' ("The Will Not to Know"), an analysis of Vatican documents on Maciel [leaked in late 2011]. The book's publication last March [2012] and Benedict's refusal to meet with Maciel victims on a trip to Mexico [in the very same month] ignited an onslaught of bad press for the pope. Benedict had to reckon with the embarrassment of John Paul's praise of Maciel after the 1998 case, in essence scoffing at allegations against one of the most notorious sexual criminals in church history. By keeping a lid on Maciel's secret life, Barba said, Benedict hoped "to defend the sainthood case against the accusations that John Paul protected predators."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncronline.org/news/accountability/legion-christs-deception-unearthed-new-documents-indicate-wider-cover]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the formal beatification ceremony on 1 May 2011, Pope Benedict could be more forthcoming in acknowledging the depth of Father Marciel's crimes. Meanwhile, Jason Berry has documented how the million dollar gifts of Father Marciel to John Paul II served to cement their friendship and to assure Marciel of papal immunity from prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;[Jason Berry, Render Unto Rome: The Secret Life of Money in the Catholic Church (NY: Random House, 2011), 156–196.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Statue of Pope John Paul the Great in Sydney, Australia.JPG|thumb|upright|The Statue of Pope John Paul the Great in Sydney, Australia]] 
Since giving his homily at the funeral of Pope John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI has continued to refer to John Paul II as "the Great". At the [[World Youth Day 2005|2005 World Youth Day]] in Germany, Pope Benedict XVI, speaking in Polish, John Paul's [[First language|native language]], said, "As the great Pope John Paul II would say: keep the flame of faith alive in your lives and your people." In May 2006, Pope Benedict XVI visited John Paul's native Poland. During that visit he repeatedly made references to "the great John Paul" and "my great predecessor".
[[File:The Statue of Pope John Paul the Great in Sydney, Australia 2.JPG|thumb|left|The plaque marking the statue of John Paul the Great]]
In addition to the Vatican calling him "the great", numerous books and newspapers have also done so. Journalist [[Peggy Noonan]] readily titled her book ''John Paul the Great: Remembering a Spiritual Father'',&lt;ref name="John Paul the Great"&gt;Noonan, Peggy. John Paul the Great: Remembering a Spiritual Father. New York: Viking, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and Catholic writer Randall Meissen subtitles his book about the pope's influence on Catholic culture, ''[https://www.amazon.com/Living-Miracles-Spiritual-Sons-Great/dp/1933271272/ The Spiritual Sons of John Paul the Great].''&lt;ref name="Meissen, Randall J., Alpharetta, GA, Misison Network, 2011. {{ISBN|978-1-933271-27-9}}"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Living-Miracles-Spiritual-Sons-Great/dp/1933271272/ Living Miracles: The Spiritual Sons of John Paul the Great Living Miracles], the book focuses especially on the influence of John Paul II on Catholic culture from the perspective of priests, bishops, and seminarians.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' called him "the Greatest" and the South African Catholic newspaper, The Southern Cross, has called him "John Paul II The Great".

'''Alcide "Blind Uncle" Gaspard'''&lt;ref name="Brasseaux80" /&gt; was a [[Blindness|partially blind]] vocalist and guitarist from [[Louisiana]] who alternated between string-band music (in a band with his brothers) and traditional [[Cajun]] balladry on his recordings for [[Vocalion]]. Born in [[Avoyelles Parish]], Louisiana in 1880, he became partially blinded when he was seven.&lt;ref name="oldweird"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldweirdamerica.wordpress.com/category/social-music/page/3/|title=31 "La Danseuse" by Delma Lachney &amp; Blind Uncle Gaspard|date=2009-12-14|accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Very little is known about Gaspard and his life as a musician; even among big-time Cajun musicians and fans. A brilliant and dexterous guitarist, he is often regarded in [[Cajun music|Cajun]] and [[Americana music|Americana]] music circles as a very mysterious and unacclaimed figure. His influences remain unknown, although his family is believed to have brought him into music. Gaspard suffered from deep depression and [[alcoholism]] throughout his life, and it is believed he remained a [[bachelor]] until his untimely death. Many of his rare recordings were re-released on Cajun compilations into the Millennium. He has since recently retained a small cult-following. Gaspard formed his first band with his brothers Victor and Amade. When he began recording in the late 1920s it was mainly as a backing [[guitar]]ist for first-generation [[Irish American]] [[fiddle]]r [[Delma Lachney]]. It was then that he also recorded some solo selections of his own during these sessions. Little else is known about Gaspard, though four of his sides (and a few of his appearances with Lachney) appear on the [[Yazoo Records|Yazoo]] compilation ''Early American Cajun Music'' released in 1999. None of Gaspard's original recordings are believed to have sold over 100 copies within his lifetime. Gaspard reportedly died untimely and alone in 1937. His sudden cause of death remains unknown. Gaspard is buried at [[Mater Dolorosa Catholic Cemetery]], in [[Plaucheville]], [[Avoyelles Parish]], [[Louisiana]].

One of Gaspard's select songs "[[Sur Le Borde De L'eau]]" was recently featured on the 2014 soundtrack of the [[HBO]] Television series [[True Detective (TV series)|True Detective]], bringing Gaspard's musical endeavors into the mainstream public for the first time. Music journalist [[Amanda Petrusich]] discusses the song in her book about collecting [[Gramophone record|78 rpm records]], ''Do Not Sell At Any Price''.  The song was among those featured in a 2015 interview with Petrusich on the [[NPR]] program, ''[[Fresh Air]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nashvillepublicradio.org/post/music-journalist-chronicles-wild-obsessive-hunt-rare-78-rpm-records Music Journalist Chronicles The 'Wild Obsessive Hunt' For Rare 78 RPM Records]," Nashville Public Radio website, August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Interest in Gaspard and his unsung music career have grown in significant popularity since the recent rediscovery of his music; as is featured on rare Cajun recordings re-released gradually into the Millennium.

'''Bradley Cantrell''' (born 1975) is an award-winning landscape architect and academic researching computation in landscape architecture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fastcoexist.com/3034998/these-synthetic-landscapes-respond-to-nature-in-real-time-to-protect-us-and-the-planet&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Bradley Cantrell received his undergraduate education from the [[University of Kentucky]] and a Masters in Landscape Architecture from the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], where he focused on media and responsive technologies. After completing his studies at Harvard he worked professionally and maintained academic appointments at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, [[Rhode Island School of Design]], [[Louisiana State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Harvard Graduate School of Design  - Homepage|url = http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/people/bradley-cantrell.html|website = www.gsd.harvard.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time at Louisiana State University he developed courses in digital media and design studios that tested how responsive technologies and robotics might help shape future large scale infrastructure. This work was primarily situated in the Mississippi River Delta and addressed issues of land and habitat loss.

'''Brian Viloria''' (born November 24, 1980) is an American [[professional boxer]] of [[Filipinos|Filipino]] descent. He is a former unified [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] and [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] [[flyweight]] champion, as well as a former [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] and [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[light flyweight]] champion. His nickname of "The Hawaiian Punch" was first given to him by [[Jesus Salud]], a fellow Hawaiian  of [[Filipinos|Filipino]] descent and himself a former world champion in boxing.

==Amateur career==
In 1999, he won the US championships, the national [[Golden Gloves]] and the world title as an amateur at the [[1999 World Amateur Boxing Championships]] in [[Houston, Texas]] but lost early at the Sydney Olympics 2000 against Brahim Asloum, who he had beaten in the 1999 World Championships in Houston, Texas. His overall record was 230-8.

He went to Northern Michigan University as part of the United States Olympic Education Center. Viloria bested both [[Glenn Donaire]] in the quarter-finals, and future world champion [[Nonito Donaire]] in the semi-finals of the 2000 US Olympic Trials. He won a spot on the 2000 olympic team by defeating his one-time teammate, Karoz Norman.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Viloria went to the Sydney Olympics as a medal favorite, but lost to eventual gold medalist Brahim Asloum of France, 6-4. Viloria landed dozens of body punches but the judges did not award points for his blows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Professional career==
===Flyweight===
Viloria started his professional career as a flyweight and picked up 17 wins with no defeats. He also captured and defended the [[North American Boxing Federation|NABF]] [[Flyweight]] title in the process before moving down to the [[Light Flyweight]] division.

===Light Flyweight===
On September 10, 2005, Viloria dropped down to light flyweight and won the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] crown by knocking out Eric Ortiz in the first round with a powerful right.

He successfully defended it once on February 18, 2006 against [[José Antonio Aguirre (boxer)]] and was undefeated in 20 bouts. Viloria's unbeaten streak ended when he was dethroned by Mexican [[Omar Niño Romero]] on August 10, 2006.

In a rematch held on November 18, 2006 at [[Las Vegas]], Romero held on to his title with a controversial [[Tie (draw)|majority draw]] decision, with Viloria knocking down Romero twice during the fight. Romero was then stripped of his title after failing a post fight drug test for methamphetamine and the decision was overturned into a no-contest.

On April 14, 2007, he fought [[Edgar Sosa (boxer)|Edgar Sosa]] for the vacant [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[Light Flyweight]] title but lost via majority decision.

===Super Flyweight===
Viloria then decided to move up to the super flyweight division and began training under former champion, [[Roberto Garcia Cortez|Roberto Garcia]], at [[La Colonia Youth Boxing Club|La Colonia Gym]] in [[Oxnard, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleid=444187 Philstar.net - Viloria back to warrior's mentality]&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Viloria won via unanimous decision against Jose Garcia Bernal (26-11-1) in his debut at the [[super flyweight]] division at the Alameda Swap Meet in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] on January 5, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/sports/printedition/la-sp-boxing5jan05,1,1910108.story?coll=la-headlines-pe-sports  LATimes.com, Martirosyan scores impressive victory]&lt;/ref&gt; Viloria secured four more victories before deciding to move back down to [[Light Flyweight]].&lt;ref&gt;http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2008/Jul/24/sp/hawaii807240379.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Light Flyweight===
On April 19, 2009, Viloria moved back down to junior flyweight to challenge Mexican [[Ulises Solís|Ulises "Archie" Solís]] for the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[Light Flyweight|Junior Flyweight]] title. Pressured by a fading career due to his past losses in big fights, Viloria defeated Solis, whom at the time of the fight was rated the #1 Jr. Flyweight by [[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ringtv.com/ratings/jr_flyweight/ ringtv.com - Ring Magazine Jr. Flyweight Ratings] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405055536/http://www.ringtv.com/ratings/jr_flyweight/ |date=April 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 11th round with a vicious right to the jaw. The official bout stoppage was a KO 2:56 into the 11th round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ringtv.com/blog/576/donaire_and_viloria_score_impressive_kos_in_the_philippines/ ringtv.com - Donaire and Viloria score impressive KOs in the Philippines] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20090422143851/http://www.ringtv.com/blog/576/donaire_and_viloria_score_impressive_kos_in_the_philippines/ |date=April 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight was held at [[Araneta Coliseum]] in the Philippines, site of the [[Thrilla in Manila]], as the co-main event of the Donaire-Martinez fight. Viloria snapped Solis' 11-fight unbeaten streak, 8 of which were title defenses while extending his win streak to 6.

Viloria successfully defended his [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[Light Flyweight|Junior Flyweight]] title on August 29, 2009 against Jesus Iribe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/171077/sports/boxing/viloria-outboxes-iribe-retains-ibf-crown&lt;/ref&gt;

For his second defense, Viloria fought [[Carlos Tamara]] of Colombia on January 23, 2010. Though leading in points, the referee called a halt to the bout in Tamara's favor as Viloria was close to passing out in the twelfth round awarding Tamara a TKO victory and the belt.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.badlefthook.com/2010/1/23/1266149/carlos-tamara-stuns-brian-viloria&lt;/ref&gt; Moments following the bout, Viloria passed out due to extreme exhaustion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philstar.com:8080/sports/592204/viloria-claims-split-verdict-over-soto&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Flyweight===
Viloria returned to the flyweight division against Mexico's Omar Soto on July 10, 2010 at the Yñares Sports Arena, Pasig City, Metro Manila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.boxingscene.com/?m=show&amp;id=29136 | title =Brian Viloria Beats Omar Soto By Split Decision Nod | last =Nathanielsz | first =Ronnie | work = | publisher =BoxingScene.com | date =July 10, 2010 | accessdate =July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 2011 Viloria captured the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] [[Flyweight]] title by besting Mexican [[Julio Cesar Miranda]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/6777192/brian-viloria-beats-julio-cesar-miranda-win-wbo-flyweight-title&lt;/ref&gt; On December 10, 2011 Viloria stopped [[Giovani Segura]] by way of an 8th Round TKO.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.badlefthook.com/2011/12/11/2627812/viloria-vs-segura-results-eighth-round-stoppage-hematoma-swelling-pinoy-boxing-news&lt;/ref&gt; On May 13, 2012, Viloria stopped his rival [[Omar Niño Romero]] in the 9th round for another successful defense of his [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] [[Flyweight]] title.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.badlefthook.com/2012/5/13/3017206/viloria-vs-romero-iii-results-brian-viloria-excorcises-demons-stops-nino-ninth-round-boxing-news&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 17, 2012 Viloria challenged [[Hernan Marquez]] in a flyweight unification between his WBO title and the Marquez's WBA crown. He went on to stop Marquez in 10 rounds becoming the first flyweight unified world champion since 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Samaco|publisher=PhilBoxing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viloria then lost both titles to [[Juan Francisco Estrada]] on April 6, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.inquirer.net/94651/viloria-loses-flyweight-belts-to-estrada-via-split-decision&lt;/ref&gt;

Viloria picked up four more wins before facing pound for pound king [[Román González (boxer)|Román González]] on October 17, 2015 for the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] and [[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]] [[Flyweight]] titles. Viloria was stopped in the 9th round and lost via TKO.

'''Carmen Velacoracho de Lara''' (1880s–1960) was a Spanish-Cuban writer, journalist, [[Feminism|feminist]], [[Monarchism|monarchist]], and [[women's rights]] activist. She was co-author of ''El libro amarillo'' (''The yellow book''), a pro-feminist manifesto published in Cuba in the early 20th century, which she drafted along with her husband, landowner Pío Fernández de Lara Zalda.&lt;ref name=Actas/&gt;

With [[Digna Collazo]], she founded the Feminist Party in 1918,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tn8s-vvxanoC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43 |last=Stoner |first=K.

During the 1920s Velacoracho left Cuba for a time to live in the United States.

1928 saw the [[Havana]] premiere of ''El descubrimiento de América'' (''The discovery of America''), a film she had directed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=La fiesta de la raza, película infantil |trans-title=The festival of la raza, children's film |newspaper=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]] |location=Madrid |date=4 April 1928 |page=11 |url=http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1928/04/04/011.html |language=Spanish |access-date=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received a prize at the first Spanish Congress of Cinematography in [[Madrid]] the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rodríguez Esteban |first=José A. |title=Geografía y Colonialismo: La Sociedad Geográfica de Madrid (1876–1936) |trans-title=Geography and Colonialism: The Geographical Society of Madrid (1876–1936) |year=1996 |publisher=[[Autonomous University of Madrid]] |isbn=978-847-477-607-2 |page=412 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, together with her daughter, she joined [[Popular Action (Spain)|Popular Action]], and in 1932 she began the publication of ''Aspiraciones'' in Spain, under their joint direction. She spent some time in jail for having sympathized with the [[Sanjurjada]] coup.

Velacoracho was an active [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] propagandist during the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]], and in the early years of [[Francoist Spain]] she also published antisemitic and [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] tirades, even claiming that the Jews controlled the United States. However this conspiracy theory did not make a large impression on the bulk of [[Falangism|Falangists]].

During [[World War II]], her open antisemitism led her to become a [[Nazism|Nazi]] sympathizer. She wrote two biographies of [[Adolf Hitler]], whom she characterized as a champion of Christianity.

She died in Madrid in 1960.

'''Chad Harris-Crane''' is a [[fictional character]] on the American [[soap opera]] ''[[Passions]]'', which aired on [[NBC]] from 1999 to 2007 and on [[DirecTV]] in 2007–08. Developed by the soap's creator and [[head writer]] [[James E. Reilly]], Chad was portrayed by two actors over the course of the show: [[Donn Swaby]] (1999 to 2002) and [[Charles Divins]] (2002 to 2007). Swaby left the show to pursue roles outside daytime television and was replaced by Divins. The role was the first time that either actor had worked on a television series.

Chad is a member of the [[Crane family]]. The illegitimate son of the evil patriarch [[Alistair Crane]], Chad is introduced as a music producer from [[Los Angeles]] who is searching for his biological family. Chad becomes involved in a love triangle with sisters [[Whitney Russell|Whitney]] and [[Simone Russell]]. His romance with Whitney is complicated by the possibility they may be engaging in an incestuous relationship as Chad is initially believed to be her half-brother, and later revealed to be her adoptive cousin. Chad's later storylines focus on his confusion over his [[sexual identity]], and his sexual relationship with tabloid reporter [[Vincent Clarkson]]. Chad attempts to reconcile with Whitney, after his affair with Vincent is revealed, before being killed by his father Alistair while trying to protect his best friend, [[Ethan Winthrop]].

Critical response to Chad was mixed; some reviewers praised the sensationalism of the incest storyline with Whitney, while others criticized his relationship with Vincent as an irresponsible and problematic representation of racial and sexual identity. The character marks a notable step in daytime television and soap opera history; it was the first depiction in a soap opera of two men having sex. Chad has also been cited as expanding the representation of [[LGBT]] characters of color on daytime television. Divins discussed the storyline with his gay friends and researched [[LGBT culture]] to better shape his performance. Media outlets expressed varying opinions of the exact nature of Chad's [[sexual orientation]].

Over the course of the show, Chad was defined by his relationships with his supposed half-sister Whitney and his nephew-niece, [[Vincent Clarkson]].&lt;ref name="Casting2" /&gt; After Swaby left the show, he was disappointed by the direction Chad's storyline took.&lt;ref name="Character2" /&gt;

Despite the controversy and negative reception of Chad's sexual encounters with Vincent, Divins identified Chad's confusion over his sexual orientation as a vital part of the storyline.&lt;ref name="OutinHollywood" /&gt;{{efn|"Out in Hollywood" is affiliated with the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]''.&lt;ref name="OutinHollywood2"&gt;{{cite web|first=Greg|last=Hernandez|url=http://blogs.dailynews.com/outinhollywood/2009/02/23/one-chapter-ends-another-begin/|title=One chapter ends, another begins&amp;nbsp;... |work=Out in Hollywood |publisher=Digital First Media|date=February 23, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160707212622/http://blogs.dailynews.com/outinhollywood/2009/02/23/one-chapter-ends-another-begin/|archivedate=July 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} While the show was still filming, he expressed an interest in further exploring Chad's rejection of his sexuality.&lt;ref name="Hood" /&gt; Divins felt that the key element of the storyline was Chad's difficulty in coming to terms with his sexuality.&lt;ref name="OutinHollywood"&gt;{{cite web|first=Greg|last=Hernandez|url=http://blogs.dailynews.com/outinhollywood/2007/02/24/a-lover-to-be-revealed-tuesday/|title=A lover to be revealed Tuesday on "Passions" |work=Out in Hollywood |publisher=Digital First Media |date=February 24, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160707205329/http://blogs.dailynews.com/outinhollywood/2007/02/24/a-lover-to-be-revealed-tuesday/|archivedate=July 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked by an interviewer about the revelation of Chad's sexuality, Divins said the show would include clear representations of "male intimacy". Divins said he was uncomfortable shooting scenes related to the storyline, but felt it was an opportunity to sharpen his skills as an actor.&lt;ref name="Hood" /&gt; He added that he wanted to make the character as "grounded and real as possible" and keep the focus on how Chad reconciles with his sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Philly"&gt;{{cite web|first=Ross|last=von Metzke|url=http://philadelphia.edgemedianetwork.com/entertainment/television/news//40814/ten_minutes_with_charles_divins|title=Ten Minutes with Charles Divins |work=Edge Media Network |publisher=Edge Publications Inc. |date=March 17, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709195847/http://www.edgemedianetwork.com//entertainment/television/news//40814/ten_minutes_with_charles_divins|archivedate=July 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prepare for the storyline, Divins consulted with his gay friends and asked them how to ensure the character was "being represented correctly and honestly".&lt;ref name="OutinHollywood" /&gt; [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s discussion of the [[Down-low (sexual slang)|down-low]] on her talk show ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' also helped Divins better understand the character.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt; Divins was unaware of the developments in Chad's sexuality until he was given the script four days prior to the filming of the episodes.&lt;ref name="OutinHollywood" /&gt; He said he was surprised by the reveal that Chad's affair was with a man, but thought the soap opera's "storytelling style lends itself to dramatic changes".&lt;ref name="Hood" /&gt; Divins praised the show for its inclusion of a black, gay character on daytime television regardless of any negative feedback from fans who preferred Chad and Whitney as a couple, and said that he wasn't afraid to take on the role, given the increased visibility of LGBT issues on television and in everyday society at the time of the storyline's broadcast.&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt; Chad's character and storyline were not to every cast member's taste; [[Tracey Ross]], who played [[Eve Russell]], later said she "was never crazy about" the incest plot,&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soaps.sheknows.com/passions/news/2133/tracey-ross-looks-back-at-her-time-on-passions|first=Lori |last=Wilson|title=Tracey Ross Looks Back at Her Time on Passions |website=Soaps.com |date=July 14, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127220937/http://soaps.sheknows.com/passions/news/2133/tracey-ross-looks-back-at-her-time-on-passions|archivedate=January 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Phillip Jeanmarie]], who played Vincent Clarkson, commented that he was glad to have been part of the taboo-breaking story.&lt;ref name="Sex" /&gt;

== Storylines ==
Chad Harris-Crane first appears in the episode airing on September 23, 1999, in which, after discovering he was adopted, he moves from Los Angeles to Harmony to find his real parents. Chad married [[Crane family#Second generation|Latoya Harris]] while he was working as a music producer in Los Angeles. Latoya refused to accompany Chad to Harmony as she did not want to leave her friends and family. While in Harmony, Chad encounters two people with information on his past - Orville Perkins and Crystal Harris. Orville, a senile old man, erroneously believes Chad is Eve's long-lost son with [[Crane Industries]] CEO [[Julian Crane]] and claims to have evidence proving this connection. In a desperate attempt to keep her past hidden, Eve burns down Orville's house and any evidence inside and places him in a retirement home. Chad later meets jazz singer Crystal Harris, who was Eve's confidante during her relationship with Julian and subsequent pregnancy. Crystal also offers information about Chad's birth and parents, but is killed by a French drug cartel's assassin Antoine, who mistakes her for socialite [[Sheridan Crane]], before she can deliver it to him.

During this time, Chad meets and falls in love with Whitney Russell. Their relationship is complicated by her sister Simone Russell's crush on him, and her parent's disapproval of him. Eve discourages both of her children from pursuing a relationship with Chad, fearing he will be a bad influence on her daughter in the same way Julian was on her teenage self. Whitney and Chad keep their romantic and sexual encounters secret for years while he pretends to be in love with Simone. The love triangle continues until Simone catches Whitney kissing Chad. Simone breaks up publicly with Chad and tells everyone in Harmony about his relationship with Whitney. During 2003, Chad's connection to Whitney steadily unravels after the discovery of his marriage to Latoya and her attempt to murder Whitney.

In 2004, Eve's vengeful adoptive sister [[Liz Sanbourne]] arranges for Eve's past relationship with Julian to be exposed to the Russell family and the rest of Harmony, resulting in Chad being erroneously identified as their son. From this point on, the apparently incestuous relationship between Chad and Whitney becomes one of the primary storylines on ''Passions.'' Whitney discovers that she is pregnant with Chad's child. She initiates a relationship with [[Fox Crane]] to be able to insinuate that he is the father and protect herself, and her child, from the stigma of incest. She gives birth to a son and immediately uses her then-boyfriend Fox Crane's power of attorney to put him up for adoption. Two couples—Julian and Eve, and T.C. and Liz—compete to adopt the boy, but Chad is awarded custody of the child. He attempts to use the child to reconnect with Whitney. Whitney and Chad name their baby Miles Davis Harris after jazz musician [[Miles Davis]]. During the show's 2005 [[Passions#Summertime extravaganzas|summertime extravaganza]], Whitney has sex with Chad in the middle of a tsunami and admits to Chad that he is Miles' biological father. Identified as the ''Vendetta'' plot, the show's 2006 summertime extravaganza centers on [[Alistair Crane]] luring Whitney, Chad, and several other residents of Harmony, to Rome. While in Rome, Chad is given his birth certificate by [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] editor [[Minor Passions characters#JT Cornell|JT Cornell]] and discovers that he was conceived during Alistair's rape of Liz. Following the revelation of his true paternity, Chad marries Whitney and they decide to raise their son together, and rename him Miles Harris-Crane.

Unbeknownst to Whitney, Chad previously began a sexual relationship with the tabloid reporter [[Vincent Clarkson]] at an unspecified time around the ''Vendetta'' plot, and he continues the affair after their reunion and wedding. Chad is unaware that Vincent is Eve's child with Julian and his half-brother, making Vincent his half-uncle, adoptive half-cousin, and half-brother-in-law. He is also initially oblivious to the fact that Vincent is [[intersex]], and that Valerie Davis, the executive assistant to [[Crane Industries]]' vice president [[Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald]], is his split personality. While confessing his affair to his friends [[Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald]] and [[Noah Bennett]], Chad repeatedly insists that he is not gay, and that his relationship with Vincent is based solely on sex. Whitney becomes increasingly suspicious of Chad's fidelity after discovering she is pregnant with their second child. Furious with Chad for continuing to sleep with Whitney, Vincent engineers a scenario in which Whitney sees Vincent and Chad having sex in the back of a [[gay bar]]; Whitney leaves Chad immediately and he distances himself from Vincent. The estranged couple start to reconcile as they try to help Theresa and [[Ethan Winthrop]] reunite, but that possibility is cut short on August 28, 2007, when Chad is killed by Alistair while trying to protect his best friend Ethan. Chad dies professing his love for Whitney and their children.

== Reception and impact ==
Chad's possibly incestuous relationship led media outlets to sensationalize Harmony as the place where "half-siblings sleep with one another",&lt;ref name="Tulsa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/daytime-dial-life-is-far-from-harmony--ous-for/article_fb4c1138-affc-586a-848c-f5a811bb9e56.html |title=Daytime Dial: Life is far from 'Harmony'-ous for Brook Kerr's Whitney |last=Block |first=Dana |date=May 21, 2006 |publisher=BH Media |work=Tulsa World |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20161126185132/http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/daytime-dial-life-is-far-from-harmony--ous-for/article_fb4c1138-affc-586a-848c-f5a811bb9e56.html |archivedate=November 26, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2006 revelation that Whitney and Chad were not related by blood was listed as one of ''Passions''{{'}} most shocking secrets by an article in ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]''.&lt;ref name="Shocking2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/passionss-most-shocking-secrets-bra-look-back-those-memorable-revelations-rocked-harmony-0 |title=A Look Back At Those Memorable Revelations That Rocked Harmony |date=December 18, 2007 |publisher=[[American Media, Inc.]] |work=[[Soap Opera Digest]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203214337/http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/passionss-most-shocking-secrets-bra-look-back-those-memorable-revelations-rocked-harmony-0 |archivedate=February  3, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soapdom.com asserted that the plot enabled Divins to showcase his acting abilities and distinguish himself from his predecessor Swaby.&lt;ref name="Soapdom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soapdom.com/Busted-to-Blissful/october-2004-passions.html|title=October 2004 ~ Passions|last=Coker|first=Lesleyann|date=October 7, 2004|publisher=Soapdom.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927154604/http://www.soapdom.com/Busted-to-Blissful/october-2004-passions.html|archivedate=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Passions'' made daytime history by being the first to depict two men having sex, but the pairing of Chad and Vincent drew less media attention than the gay relationships in  ''[[As the World Turns]]'' and ''[[One Life to Live]]''.&lt;ref name="Sex"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daytimeconfidential.com/2009/07/30/dc-exclusive-passions-villain-phillip-jeanmarie-talks-workshop-gay-firsts-and-reilly|title=DC Exclusive: Passions Villain Phillip Jeanmarie Talks "Workshop", Gay Firsts and Reilly|last=Giddens|first=Jamey|date=July 30, 2009|work=Daytime Confidential |publisher=Confidential Media, Inc.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528221942/http://daytimeconfidential.com/2009/07/30/dc-exclusive-passions-villain-phillip-jeanmarie-talks-workshop-gay-firsts-and-reilly|archivedate=May 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complicated incest storyline was described as "insanely convoluted" by [[Gawker]]'s Kyle Buchanan, who felt it was one of "the most insane things that have ever happened on television";&lt;ref name="CrazyCucu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5063983/the-creator-of-the-best-tv-show-ever-passions-has-died|title=The Creator of The Best TV Show Ever, 'Passions,' Has Died|last=Buchanan|first=Kyle|date=October 15, 2008|website=[[Gawker]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528222730/http://gawker.com/5063983/the-creator-of-the-best-tv-show-ever-passions-has-died|archivedate=May 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the plotline was also praised, by Soaps.com, as reflecting the show's "unique perspective and zest for controversy" while challenging the "often too safe and predictable world of soaps".&lt;ref name="Viewers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soaps.sheknows.com/passions/news/607/passions-new-controversy|title=Passions' New Controversy|date=March 9, 2007|work=Soaps.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708031245/http://soaps.sheknows.com/passions/news/607/passions-new-controversy|archivedate=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; NewNowNext.com approved of the plotline for increasing the presence of LGBT people of color on daytime television,&lt;ref name="Logo" /&gt; with Ross von Metze of Edge Media Network commenting that the show was "taking risks where other TV shows have failed".&lt;ref name="Philly" /&gt;

Viewers were divided over the sexually explicit sequences between Chad and Vincent. Some felt the scenes between Chad and Vincent were "appalling" and inappropriate for daytime television, while one viewer praised the soap opera for "continu[ing] their outstanding jobs as they teach the people of today's world about daily life experiences". A writer from Soaps.com defended the show by pointing out graphic sex scenes between men and women were previously aired without complaint.&lt;ref name="Viewers"/&gt;

Chad's relationship with Vincent received some criticism, with ''[[Windy City Times]]''; describing the storyline as "reckless" and "outrageous".&lt;ref name="Windy"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/View-Racial-vs-gay-diversity-in-daytime-TV/21128.html |title=View: Racial vs. gay diversity in daytime TV - Gay Lesbian Bi Trans News Archive - Windy City Times |last=Davis |first=Herndon L. |date=May 1, 2009 |work=[[Windy City Times]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20161214183220/http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/View-Racial-vs-gay-diversity-in-daytime-TV/21128.html |archivedate=December 14, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']]'s Ta-Nehisi Coates, the storyline was also disliked by the show's black audience.&lt;ref name="OntheDownLow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2007/03/a_lowdown_crying_shame.html|title=A Low-Down Crying Shame|last=Coates|first=Ta-Nehisi|date=March 9, 2007|website=[[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']]|publisher=[[The Slate Group]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605064100/http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2007/03/a_lowdown_crying_shame.html|archivedate=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Perigard of the ''[[Boston Herald]]''  was critical of the timing of the death of lesbian Rae Thomas following the reveal of Chad's affair with a man; Perigard argued that Thomas's character was removed to reduce the number of gay characters on the show.&lt;ref name="BostonHerald"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/2007/02/passions_exceeds_gay_quota_kills_character|title='Passions' exceeds gay quota, kills character|last=Perigard|first=Mark|publisher=Herald Media Inc.|work=[[Boston Herald]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709200914/http://www.bostonherald.com/2007/02/passions_exceeds_gay_quota_kills_character|archivedate=July 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles François Dupuis''' (26 October 1742{{snd}}29 September 1809) was a French [[wikt:savant|savant]], a professor (from 1766) of [[rhetoric]] at the [[:fr:Collège de Lisieux|Collège de Lisieux]], [[Paris]], who studied for the law in his spare time and was received as ''avocat'' in 1770. He also ventured into the field of mathematics and served on the committee that developed the [[French Republican Calendar]].

Along with [[Constantin-François Chassebœuf|Constantin François Chassebœuf de Volney]] (1757–1820)  Dupuis was known for developing the [[Christ myth]] theory, which argued that Christianity was an amalgamation of various ancient mythologies and that [[Jesus]] was a mythical character.

==Biography==
Dupuis was born in [[Trie-Château]] (in present-day [[Oise]]), the son of a schoolmaster. His precocious talents were recognized by the [[duc de La Rochefoucauld]] who sent him to the [[College d'Harcourt]].  Dupuis made such rapid progress that, at the age of twenty-four, he was appointed professor of rhetoric at the college of [[Lisieux]], where he had previously passed as a [[Licentiate of Theology]]. In his hours of leisure he studied law, and in 1770 he abandoned the clerical career and became an [[advocate]]. Two university discourses which he delivered in Latin were printed, and laid the foundation of his literary fame.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Dupuis, Charles François|volume=8|page=690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1778, he invented a [[telegraph]] with which he was able to correspond with his friend Fortin de Bagneux, and must be considered among the first inventors of the telegraph that was perfected by [[Claude Chappe]]. The [[French Revolution|Revolution]] made it necessary to destroy his machine in order to avoid suspicion.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Dupuis devoted himself to the study of [[astronomy]] (his tutor was [[Jérôme Lalande|Lalande]]) in connection with [[mythology]], the result of which was his ''magnum opus'': ''Origine de tous les Cultes, ou la Réligion Universelle''. It appeared in 1795 in quarto or octavo format, profusely illustrated (in 12 volumes); an abridgement (1798) spread his system more widely among the reading public. In ''Origine'' he advocated the unity of the astronomical and religious myths of all nations, an aspect of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s confidence in the universality of human nature. In his ''Mémoire explicatif du Zodiaque, chronologique et mythologique'' (1806) he similarly maintains a common origin for the astronomical and religious opinions of the Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese, Persians, and Arabians. His basis was what he saw as the perfect correspondence between the signs of the [[zodiac]] and their significations had existed in [[Upper Egypt]] at a period of between fifteen and sixteen thousand years before the present time, and that it had existed only there. Subsequently, this harmony had been disturbed by the effect of the precession of the equinoxes. He therefore ascribed the invention of the signs of the zodiac to the people who then inhabited Upper Egypt or [[Ethiopia]]. His theory as to the origin of mythology in Upper Egypt led to the expedition organized by [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] for the exploration of that country.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

He then contributed to the ''[[Journal des savants]]'' a memoire on the origin of the constellations and on the explication of myth through astronomy, which was published as a separate fascicle in 1781. He came to the attention of [[Frederick the Great]], who appointed him secretary but died before Dupuis could take up duties in [[Berlin]]. The chair of humanity in the [[Collège de France]] having at the same time become vacant, it was conferred on Dupuis, where he taught Latin eloquence, and in 1788 he became a member of the [[Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres]]. He now resigned his professorship at Lisieux, and was appointed by the administrators of the department of Paris one of the four commissioners of public instruction.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

After the start of the French Revolution, Dupuis fled Paris for [[Évreux]], appalled by the massacres of September 1792, only to return when he discovered he had been elected to the National Convention, where he sat on the [[Council of Five Hundred]], and was President of the Legislative Body after the coup d'état of [[18 Brumaire]]. He left political life in 1802. In April 1806 he received the [[Legion of Honor]].

Dupuis believed in an impersonal God that permeated everything. [[Charles Bradlaugh]] has classified Dupuis as a [[pantheist]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Bradlaugh|Bradlaugh, Charles]]. (1895). [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015002720608;view=1up;seq=67 ''Theological Essays'']. London. p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christ myth theory==
The beginnings of the formal denial of the existence of [[Jesus]] can be traced to late 18th century France, and the works of [[Constantin-François Chassebœuf|Constantin François Chassebœuf de Volney]] (1757–1820) and Dupuis.&lt;ref name="Weaver"&gt;Weaver, Walter P. (1999). ''The Historical Jesus in the Twentieth Century, 1900–1950''. Trinity. pp. 45-50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schweitzer"&gt;Schweitzer, Albert. (2001) [1913] ''The Quest of the Historical Jesus''. Fortress. p. 355ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Volney and Dupuis argued that Christianity was an amalgamation of various ancient mythologies and that Jesus was a mythical character.&lt;ref name="Weaver"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Voorst"&gt;Van Voorst, Robert E. (2000). ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence''. Eerdmans Publishing. pp. 7-11. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dupuis argued that ancient rituals in [[Syria]], [[Egypt]] and [[Persia]] had influenced the Christian story which was [[allegory|allegorized]] as the histories of [[solar deity|solar deities]], such as [[Sol Invictus]].&lt;ref name="Wells"&gt;Wells, G. A. (1969). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2708429 Stages of New Testament Criticism]. ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', 30 (2): 147-160.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued also that Jewish and Christian scriptures could be interpreted according to the solar pattern, e.g. the [[Fall of Man]] in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] being an allegory of the hardship caused by winter, and the [[resurrection of Jesus]] an allegory for the growth of the sun's strength in the sign of Aries at the spring [[equinox]].&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt;

Volney argued that [[Abraham]] and [[Sarah]] were derived from [[Brahma]] and his wife [[Saraswati]], and that Christ was related to [[Krishna]].&lt;ref name=Leask104&gt;Leask, Nigel (2004). ''British Romantic Writers and the East''. Cambridge Univ Press. pp. 104 -105. {{ISBN|0521604443}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Volney published before Dupuis but made use of a draft version of Dupuis' work, and followed much of his argument, but at times differed from him, e.g. in arguing that the gospel stories were not intentionally created as an extended allegory grounded in solar myths, but were compiled organically when simple allegorical statements were misunderstood as history.&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt;

==Reception==
French [[Catholicism|Catholic]] librarian [[Jean-Baptiste Pérès]] wrote a satirical refutation of Dupuis's work under the title of ''Grand Erratum'' (1827), in which he maintains, in parallel to Dupuis's thesis that the cult of Christ is merely a cult of the Sun, that Napoleon (who, in reality, died a mere six years before the publication of the pamphlet) never existed, but was only a sun myth.

'''Charles Coles Diggs Sr.''' (January 2, 1894 – 1967) was the first African-American Democrat elected to the [[Michigan Senate|Senate of the State of Michigan]].

Born in [[Tallula, Mississippi]], to John Diggs and Etta Jones, Diggs moved to Detroit in 1913, where he owned a successful funeral home on the lower east side.

==Political career==
A follower of [[Marcus Garvey]] during the 1920s, Diggs first became involved in politics as a Republican, and then changed affiliation to the Democrats in 1932.  Diggs was an early organizer of the Black Democratic Clubs in Detroit.&lt;ref name="Dillard"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dillard | first = Angela D. | title = Faith in the City: Preaching Radical Social Change in Detroit | publisher = University of Michigan | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Qc8QY2WLZHUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diggs was a member of the Michigan State Senate from the 3rd District from 1937-1944, and was a delegate from Michigan to the Democratic National Convention in 1940.

Diggs gained a reputation as a friend of organized labor and a civil rights champion.  Diggs had a personal story of traveling to [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] in 1938 for his first session in the [[Michigan Legislature|Legislature]], and then being denied a room because of his race at the Olds Hotel across the street from the State Capitol.  Diggs was forced to live during the week in one of Lansing's segregated neighborhoods.  Diggs responded with a series of bills aimed at strengthening Michigan's civil rights laws, and the ''Diggs Law'' (Equal Accommodations Act of 1938&amp;mdash;Act 117, signed by Governor [[Frank Murphy]]) made discriminatory service based on color, race or creed a misdemeanor.&lt;ref name="Dillard"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Suzanne E. | title = To Serve the Living | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 2010 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lQRvQlWntHcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, Diggs was defeated in the Democratic primary.  Later, Diggs was an unsuccessful candidate for U.S. Representative from Michigan (1st District) as a Republican in the 1948 primary, and then as a Democrat in the 1952 primary.&lt;ref name="PG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/geo/MI/funeral.html|title=Charles Coles Diggs, Sr.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Political Graveyard|access-date=|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal convictions==
On January 22, 1944,  Diggs and 19 other current or former state legislators were charged with accepting bribes.  Diggs was convicted and sentenced to three-to-five years in prison.  In 1945, Diggs was convicted in a different bribery case.  On July 20, 1946, Diggs and 18 other legislators were charged with accepting bribes to vote against a banking bill.  The case was dropped when the witness for the prosecution, Charles F. Hemans, refused to testify.&lt;ref name="PG"/&gt;

==Personal life and death==
He was rooted in his family's business, the House of Diggs, which at one time was said to be Michigan's largest funeral home.&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;{{cite news |title=Charles Diggs Dies at 75 |first1=Richard, Staff Writer |last1=Pearson |newspaper=[[Washington Post]]  |date=August 26, 1998 |page=B06 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/junkie/links/diggs.htm |accessdate=May 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diggs was father to politician [[Charles Diggs|Charles C Diggs, Jr.]].  The elder Diggs was a member of the Elks.  He was interred at Detroit Memorial Park in [[Warren, Michigan|Warren]].&lt;ref name="PG"/&gt;

'''Chen Yi''' ({{zh|s=陈怡|t=陳怡|p=Chén Yí}}) (born April 4, 1953) is a Chinese [[violinist]] and composer of [[contemporary classical music]].  She was the first Chinese woman to receive a [[Master of Arts]] (M.A.) in music composition from the [[Central Conservatory of Music]] in [[Beijing]]. Chen was a finalist for the 2006 [[Pulitzer Prize for Music]] for her composition Si Ji (Four Seasons), and has received awards from the Koussevistky Music Foundation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.koussevitzky.org/grantscomplete.html|title=The Koussevitzky Music Foundation {{!}} Complete List of Grants|website=www.koussevitzky.org|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and American Academy of Arts and Letters (Lieberson Award)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.presser.com/composer/chen-yi/|title=Chen Yi {{!}} Theodore Presser Company|website=www.presser.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation  and the National Endowment for the Arts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.presser.com/composer/chen-yi/|title=Chen Yi {{!}} Theodore Presser Company|website=www.presser.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2010, she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from [[The New School]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.newschool.edu/news/2010/05/congratulations-to-the-class-of-2010-the-new-school-commencement-to-be-held-on-may-21/#.Wzpn5BJKgWo |title=The New School Commencement to be Held on May 21 |date=2010-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2012, she was awarded the [[Brock Commission]] from the American Choral Directors Association. 

==Early life==
Chen was born and raised in [[Guangzhou]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] into a talented family. Her parents were doctors and musicians; her mother played the piano, and her father was a violinist. Her older sister was a child prodigy, and both she and their younger brother continue to work as professional musicians in China.

Chen began studying piano at the age of three, heavily influenced by the music of Western composers such as [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. However, once the [[Cultural Revolution]] began in 1966, Western attitudes were severely shunned and arts were opposed. For ten years, education came to a halt and people were relocated to work in large communes in countryside. Chen's father and older sister were sent away, but she managed to stay in her hometown a while longer and continued to practice music, although she was forced to stuff a blanket inside her piano in order to dampen the sound and play her violin with a mute. When she was 15 years old, the family house was searched, all possessions were taken, and the rest of her family was dispersed to different locations to perform compulsory labor in the countryside.

Chen used her time spent laboring in the countryside to learn and appreciate [[Chinese folklore|Chinese folk culture]]. Her connection with Chinese music would prove a useful tool in finding her own voice for her musical compositions in later life. At age seventeen, she returned to Guangzhou and began working as [[concertmaster]] in the orchestra of the Beijing Opera Troupe in Guangzhou.

==Career==

Chen lived for many years in [[New York City]], and studied composition with [[Chou Wen-chung]] and [[Mario Davidovsky]] at [[Columbia University]], earning a [[Doctor of Musical Arts|DMA]] with distinction.  Her husband is the composer [[Zhou Long]].  As of 2006, both Chen and Zhou are professors of composition at the [[University of Missouri–Kansas City]] Conservatory of Music and Dance.

Alongside a great number of orchestral works, Chen has also made many contributions to the choral repertoire and the chamber music repertoire, including works written for traditional Chinese instruments. Chen's works are published by the [[Theodore Presser Company]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7069">{{about|the social and cultural concept of creolization|the linguistic concept of creolization|Creole genesis}}
'''Creolization''' is the process in which [[Creole peoples|creole]] cultures emerge in the [[New World]].&lt;ref name="Sidbury"&gt;{{cite journal |author=James Sidbury |year=2007 |title=Globalization, creolization, and the not-so-peculiar institution |journal=[[Journal of Southern History]] |volume=73 |issue=3 |pages=617–630 |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Globalization,+creolization,+and+the+not-so-peculiar+institution.-a0167979703 |doi=10.2307/27649484|jstor=27649484 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of [[colonization]] there was a mixture among people of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American]], West African and European descent, which came to be understood as Creolization. Creolization is traditionally used to refer to the [[Caribbean]]; although not exclusive to the Caribbean it can be further extended to represent other [[diasporas]].&lt;ref name="Flores"&gt;{{cite book |author=Juan Flores |title=The Diaspora Strikes Back: Caribeño Tales of Learning and Turning |year=2009 |pages=27–30 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-0-415-95261-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixing of people brought a cultural mixing which ultimately led to the formation of new identities. Furthermore, creolization occurs when participants select cultural elements that may become part of or inherited culture. [[Robin Cohen]] states that creolization is a condition in which "the formation of new identities and inherited culture evolve to become different from those they possessed in the original cultures," and then creatively merge these to create new varieties that supersede the prior forms.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Robin Cohen]] |year=2007 |title=Creolization and cultural globalization: the soft sounds of fugitive power |journal=[[Globalizations]] |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=369–373 |url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/sociology/rsw/current/cscs/working_papers/creolization_and_cultural_globalization_the_soft_sounds_of_fugitive_power.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |doi=10.1080/14747730701532492 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215319/http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/sociology/rsw/current/cscs/working_papers/creolization_and_cultural_globalization_the_soft_sounds_of_fugitive_power.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning==
According to Charles Stewart,&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Charles Stewart |year=2007 |title=Creolization: History, Ethnography, Theory |author=Charles Stewart |chapter=Creolization: history, ethnography, theory |publisher=[[Left Coast Press]] |isbn=978-1-59874-279-4 |pages=1–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of creolization originates during the 16th century, although there is no date recording the beginning of the word creolization. The term creolization was understood to be a distinction between those individuals born in the "Old World" versus the New World.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt; As consequence to slavery and the different power relations between different races creolization became synonymous with [[Creole peoples|Creole]], often of which was used to distinguish the master and the slave. The word Creole was also used to distinguish those Afro-descendants who were born in the New World in comparison to African-born slaves.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt; The word ''creolization'' has evolved and changed to have different meaning at different times in history.

What has not changed through the course of time is the context in which [[Creole peoples|Creole]] has been used. It has been associated with cultural mixtures of African, [[Europe]]an, and [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] (in addition to other lineages in different locations) ancestry (e.g. Caribbeans).&lt;ref name="Flores"/&gt; Creole has pertained to "African-diasporic geographical and historical specificity".&lt;ref name="Flores"/&gt; With globalization, creolization has undergone a "remapping of worlds regions",&lt;ref name="Flores"/&gt; or as [[Orlando Patterson]] would explain, "the creation of wholly new cultural forms in the [[International|transnational]] space, such as 'New Yorican' and Miami Spanish". Today, creolization refers to this mixture of different people and different cultures that merge to become one.

==Diaspora==
Creolization as a relational process can enable new forms of identity formation and processes of communal enrichment through pacific intermixtures and aggregations, but its uneven dynamics remain a factor to consider whether in the context of colonization or [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wendy Knepper |year=2006 |title=Colonization, creolization, and globalization: the art and ruses of bricolage |journal=Small Axe: A Caribbean Journal of Criticism |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=70–86 |doi=10.1353/smx.2006.0038}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting points of multiple diasporas and the crossing and intersection of diasporas are sites of new creolizations.&lt;ref name="Flores"/&gt; New sites of creolizations continue the ongoing ethics of the sharing of the world that has now become a global discourse which is rooted in English and [[French West Indies#French Caribbean|French Caribbean]]. The cultural fusion and hybridization of [[new diaspora]]s surfaces and creates new forms of creolization.

==Culture==
There are different processes of creolization have shaped and reshaped the different forms of one culture. For example, food, music, and religion have been impacted by the creolization of today's world.

===Food===
Creolization has affected the elements and traditions of food. The blend of cooking that describes the mixture of African and French elements in the American South, particularly in [[Louisiana]], and in the French Caribbean have been influenced by creolization. This mixture has led to the unique combination of cultures that led to cuisine of creolization, better known as ''creole cooking''.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; These very creations of difference flavors particularly pertains to specific territory which is influenced by different histories and experiences.
	
===Music===
Jazz music took its roots from the dialogue between black folk music in the U.S., that is derived from plantations and rural areas and black music based in urban New Orleans. Jazz music developed from the ''creole music'' that takes its roots from the combination of blues, parlour music, opera, and spiritual music.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

===Religion===
The popular religions of Haiti, Cuba, Trinidad, and Brazil formed from the mixing of African and European elements. Religious beliefs such as [[Haitian Vodou|Voodoo]] in Haiti, [[Santeria]] in Cuba, [[Trinidad Orisha|Shango]] in Trinidad, and [[Candomblé]] in Brazil take its roots from creolization. The creation of these new religious expressions have sustained and evolved over time to make ''creole religions''.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

'''Dorchen A. Leidholdt''' is an activist and leader in the [[feminist]] movement against [[violence against women]]. Since the mid-1970s, she has counseled and advocated for [[rape victim]]s, organized against "the media's promotion of violence against women", served on the legal team for the plaintiff in a precedent-setting [[sexual harassment]] case, founded an international [[non-governmental organization]] fighting prostitution and trafficking in women and children, directed the nation's largest legal services program for victims of [[domestic violence]], advocated for the enactment and implementation of laws that further the rights of abused women, and represented hundreds of women [[victimized]] by [[intimate partner violence]], [[human trafficking]], [[sexual assault]], the threat of [[honor killing]], [[female genital mutilation]], [[forced marriage|forced]] and [[child marriage]], and the [[internet bride]] trade.

Leidholdt has lectured internationally on issues of violence against women, and has published articles, book chapters, and two anthologies.

==Education==
Leidholdt hold a [[masters degree]] from the [[University of Virginia]], and a law degree from [[New York University School of Law]], where she was a [[Root-Tilden-Snow scholar]].&lt;ref name="catwinternational.org"/&gt;

==Past career==
From 1975 to 1977, Leidholdt counseled rape victims as a graduate student at the [[University of Virginia]] and, after moving to [[New York City]] in 1978, became an activist with the Women's Anti-Rape Coalition, the educational arm of New York Women Against Rape. From 1978 through 1980, she was a leader of the New York City Chapter of Women Against Violence Against Women.

Leidholdt is known for her campaigns [[Feminist views on pornography#Radical feminist opposition|against pornography]] and for her suit against ''[[Hustler]]'' magazine publisher [[Larry Flynt]]. In 1979, after ''Hustler Magazine'' published an issue whose cover showed a naked female body being fed through a meat grinder, she joined [[Susan Brownmiller]], [[Dolores Alexander]] (Past President of the [[National Organization for Women]]), and other New York City women's rights leaders in founding the feminist organization, [[Women Against Pornography]] (WAP).

From 1979 through 1983, she served as a leader and spokesperson for WAP, during which time she joined [[Gloria Steinem]] and other feminist leaders in initiating a suit against ''[[Hustler]]'' and [[Larry Flynt]], appeared on numerous television and radio programs, organized educational events, and spoke in [[Washington D.C.]] before the [[U.S. Attorney General]]'s Commission on Pornography (a.k.a. [[The Meese Commission]]) at the commission's invitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cultronix.eserver.org/califia/meese|title=The Meese Commission Report|website=cultronix.eserver.org|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There Leidholdt testified, "Pornography perpetuates the devaluation of women. It sexualizes bigotry, promotes rape and undermines women's self esteem."

Flynt published an attack on her in the magazine's "[[Asshole]] of the Month" column (July 1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anusha.com/asshole.htm|title=Who is Dorchen Leidholdt?|website=www.anusha.com|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, at [[New York University School of Law]], she was the lead organizer of the conference, "The Sexual Liberals and the Attack on Feminism", and in 1988, she was the lead organizer of the first global conference on trafficking in women and girls.

Leidholdt is an opponent of "[[sex-positive feminism]]". Her main argument is that [[prostitution]] is exploitative towards women and has historically benefited men, not women.

==Current career==
Leidholdt is the Director of the [[Center for Battered Women's Legal Services]] at [[Sanctuary for Families]] in [[New York City]]. Under Leidholdt's leadership since 1994, the Center has become the largest legal services program for [[domestic violence]] victims in the country. It has grown from two to twenty-four lawyers and eight support staff members, and has strengthened its advocacy efforts on behalf of under-served populations of women, especially those in New York City's immigrant communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanctuaryforfamilies.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=48|title=Sanctuary for Families {{!}} In love there is no violence|website=Sanctuary for Families|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center has spearheaded state litigation that set new legal precedent expanding the protections available to domestic violence victims petitioning for orders of protection and federal litigation preventing [[child protective agencies]] from charging battered mothers with "engaging in domestic violence".&lt;ref name="law.columbia.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.columbia.edu/fac/Dorchen_Leidholdt|title=Dorchen A. Leidholdt|website=Columbia Law School|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Leidholdt also serves as a Board Member of the [[Coalition Against Trafficking in Women]] (CATW), which she helped found in 1988. She has represented the Coalition at numerous international meetings, including the [[World Conference on Human Rights]] ([[Vienna]], 1993) and the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] ([[Beijing]], 1995). On 6 December 1996, in a special session commemorating the [[abolitionism|abolition of slavery]], Leidholdt and a survivor of sex trafficking together addressed the [[General Assembly of the United Nations]].&lt;ref name="catwinternational.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catwinternational.org/bio_DorchenLeidholdt.php |title=Biography of Dorchen A. Leidholdt |accessdate=2008-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826141307/http://www.catwinternational.org/bio_DorchenLeidholdt.php |archivedate=2007-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leidholdt has taught [[Criminal Procedure]] at [[City University School of Law]], and, since 1998, has taught Domestic Violence and the Law at [[Columbia University School of Law]].&lt;ref name="law.columbia.edu"/&gt;

==Activism==
In 1990, Leidholdt became an associate of the [[Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press]] (WIFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wifp.org/who-we-are/associates/|title=Associates {{!}} The Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press|website=www.wifp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.

==Quotes==

In "From Sex Trafficking to FGM: Emerging Issues", her chapter in ''The Lawyer's Manual on Domestic Violence'',&lt;ref&gt;5th Edition (Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division)&lt;/ref&gt; she wrote:

{{quote|Like other domestic violence victims, immigrant battered women have often been subjected to multiple forms of violence and exploitation, from rape and workplace sexual harassment to child sexual abuse. Lawyers representing battered women who have endured other forms of gender-based violence must be aware that these experiences of abuse often intensify the victim's trauma and may require referrals to specialized social service and health care providers as well as to other legal professionals. Advocates for immigrant women may find this situation particularly daunting. Because the violence may have taken place in a different culture, in a form with which you are unfamiliar, your client may have urgent needs that you are unaware of and rights that, as a consequence, are never vindicated. Some of these forms of violence, like trafficking in persons and exploitation in internet marriages, are more common in the cases of clients from industrialized societies. Other types of violence, such as child marriage and female genital mutilation, are more frequent in the cases of victims from traditional cultures.&lt;ref name="courts.state.ny.us"&gt;Leidholdt, Dorchen; Goodman, Jill Laurie, Lawyer's manual on domestic violence: representing the victim (PDF) (5th ed.), New York: Appellate Division, First Department, Supreme Court of the State of New York.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In "When Women Defend Pornography", her chapter in the ''Sexual Liberals and the Attack on Feminism'', Leidholdt wrote:

{{quote|The problem with the ideas of the [[Sex-positive feminism|pro-sex people]] is that they beg important political questions - like how, why, and in whose interest. They fail both to look at [[gender|sexuality]] as a political system and to examine women's position in that system. They make sense in the abstract, but are revealed as critically flawed when measured against women's actual condition in society. They are not feminist, but "sexual liberationist". And I put "sexual liberationist" in quotes because it has never included the liberation, sexual or otherwise, of women.

As for the hierarchy of sexual privilege, it too sounds convincing, until you examine the position of women in this hierarchy. [[Heterosexuality]], [[procreation]], and [[marriage]] may mean [[Male privilege|privilege for men]], but they mean something very different for the married woman. Her "good fortune" is a one out of three chance of being a battered wife, one out of seven chance of being raped by her own husband, and a statistically undetermined probability that she will be her husbands domestic servant and that her identity will be subsumed in his. The so-called good fortune of [[lesbian feminists]] is either public denigration or invisibility and often loss of jobs and family.}}

'''Emil Rieve''' (June 8, 1892 – January 24, 1975)&lt;ref name="Saxon"&gt;Saxon, "Emil Rieve, Unionist, Dies," ''New York Times,'' January 26, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[trade union|labor]] leader. He was president of the [[Textile Workers Union of America]] (TWUA) from 1939 to 1956, a vice president of the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO) from 1939 to 1955, and a vice president of the [[AFL-CIO]] from 1955 to 1960.

Emil Rieve was born in [[Poland]] and moved to [[Pennsylvania]] as a child. He left school early and first became a union member at age fifteen, quickly rising within the union hierarchy. He organized his first strike in 1930 in [[Reading, Pennsylvania]]. His aggressive drives to unionize the region's textile workers and achieve union recognition led to the [[National Labor Board#The Reading Formula and representational elections|Reading Formula]] of 1933 in negotiating with the [[National Labor Board]], a precedent which resolved large numbers of other labor disputes. Rieve was a major figure in the unsuccessful [[Textile workers strike (1934)|textile workers strike of 1934]]. When the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] formed the following year, Rieve received international recognition for his efforts to avoid a rift with the [[American Federation of Labor]].

In 1937 Rieve pioneered a successful sit-down strike of 50,000 textile workers that resulted in wage increases. He became acting chairman of the Textile Workers Organizing Committee in 1938 and organized the Textile Workers Union of America in 1939. The union was quite strong under Rieve's stewardship and he played a role in the merger of the AFL with the CIO in 1952.

==Early life==
Rieve was born in [[Żyrardów County]] in [[Congress Poland]] in 1892 to Fred and Pauline (née Lange) Rieve. The family was [[Lutheran]], and Fred Rieve was a machinist who tended textile machines.&lt;ref name="Saxon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fink"&gt;Fink, ''Biographical Dictionary of American Labor,'' 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rieve attended a local elementary school. But the family emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1904, interrupting Rieve's education. The Rieves settled in central [[Pennsylvania]], and Emil found work in a [[hosiery]] mill.&lt;ref name="Saxon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fink" /&gt;  He married Laura Wosnack in July 1916. They had a son, Harold.&lt;ref name="Fink" /&gt;

==Early union career==
In 1907, at the age of 15, Rieve joined the [[American Federation of Hosiery Workers]] (AFHW), a semi-autonomous division of the [[United Textile Workers of America]] (UTW), an affiliate of the [[American Federation of Labor]].&lt;ref&gt;Galenson, 1960. The division was also variously called the American Federation of Full-Fashioned Hosiery Workers and the Full-Fashioned Hosiery Workers Union.&lt;/ref&gt; His rise in the union was meteoric: At the age of 22, he was elected a vice president of the AFHW, became the division's president in 1929 at the age of 35, and joined the national UTW executive board in 1934.&lt;ref name="Saxon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fink" /&gt;

===Organizing and the Reading Formula===
Rieve was committed to organizing new members in the hosiery industry. In November 1930, Rieve authorized a strike among hosiery workers in the mills around [[Reading, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;"Hosiery Strike Voted," ''New York Times,'' November 17, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; The strike collapsed after heavy employer opposition. Rieve then tried a new tactic: The union agreed to a 30 percent wage cut in the expectation that non-union mills would lower their wages below the new union level. This would trigger a massive strike, enabling the AFHW to move in and organize the workers. Roughly 3,000 workers, or about a third of the total number in the industry, struck. Rieve purposefully withheld strike aid to the workers in an attempt to increase the radicalism of the workers and raise the demand for a union.&lt;ref&gt;"Hosiery Wage Cut Voted in Union War," ''New York Times,'' September 7, 1931; "3,000 Workers Quit on Hosiery Pay Cut," ''New York Times,'' September 22, 1931; "Union Withholds Hosiery Strike Aid," ''New York Times,'' September 24, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; But employers were content to idle plants in the depths of the [[Great Depression]], and the strike lingered for nearly a year. Admitting defeat, Rieve signed a new contract in September 1932.&lt;ref&gt;"Hosiery Workers Return," ''New York Times,'' September 3, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just three months later, Rieve led his division in approving yet another large organizing drive. Again aimed at workers in the Reading area, Rieve declared war "against [[industrial slavery]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[and]&lt;/nowiki&gt; starvation wages".&lt;ref&gt;"Demands Reforms in Textile Mills," ''New York Times,'' December 17, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt; The organizing drive began in the summer of 1933. The employers refused to recognize the union, and 10,000 workers went on strike. On August 10, 1933, the [[National Labor Board]] mediated a settlement which established the [[National Labor Board#The Reading Formula and representational elections|"Reading formula."]] The "Reading formula" was a major step forward in the conceptualization of American labor law, for it established the principle of secret-ballot elections as a means of determining union support among workers at a plant.&lt;ref&gt;"Mediation Board Ends Hosiery Fight," ''New York Times,'' August 11, 1933; Morris, ''The Blue Eagle at Work: Reclaiming Democratic Rights in the American Workplace,'' 2004; Schlesinger, ''The Age of Roosevelt: The Coming of the New Deal: 1933-1935,'' 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1934 national textile strike===
{{main|Textile workers strike (1934)}}
By 1934, despite Rieve's organizing drive and conditions favorable to union organizing created by the depression, the UTW still had only 80,000 paying members (making it one of the smaller unions in the AFL).&lt;ref name="Galenson"&gt;Galenson, ''The CIO Challenge to the AFL: A History of the American Labor Movement,'' 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (NIRA) of 1933 had authorized the establishment of "industry codes" to regulate wages, hours and working conditions in every industry in the United States. But employers not only heavily influenced the writing of the code, they also dominated the board adjudicating alleged violations of the code. The code led to few improvements in the textile industry. For example, when workers won shorter hours, employers made an end-run around the restriction by speeding up work.&lt;ref name="1934strike"&gt;Irons, ''Testing the New Deal: The General Textile Strike of 1934 in the American South,'' 2000; Salmond, ''The General Textile Strike of 1934: From Maine to Alabama, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein"&gt;Bernstein, ''The Turbulent Years: A History of the American Worker, 1933-1941,'' 1970 (originally published 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

Newly elected to the UTW executive board, Rieve was one of several national union leaders who pressed for the union to threaten a nationwide strike in order to win improvements in the NIRA code. The strike was a mere threat, as UTW had no resources to undertake a nationwide strike. Nevertheless, the [[National Recovery Administration]] agreed to provide UTW leaders with a voice on the code adjudicatory board. UTW agreed to cancel the strike.&lt;ref name="Saxon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1934strike" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;

Local UTW leaders, however, refused to call off the strike. Locals in northern [[Alabama]] struck on July 18, and the strike swept through the [[Deep South]]. UTW was forced to call a special convention on August 13 to address the crisis. The UTW drew up a list of demands, which mill owners ignored. Nevertheless, the strike enjoyed initial success. In many counties, 80 percent of workers walked out. Nationwide, almost 400,000 textile workers left their jobs, an astonishing number in the middle of the depression.&lt;ref name="1934strike" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;

Mill owners and state and local government officials worked together to put down the strike. State and local officials hired hundreds of "special deputies" to guard plants, prevent strikers from closing plants, protect replacement workers from harassment and intimidation, and (in some cases) to beat strikers and break up picket lines. The [[Governor#United States|governors]] of [[Connecticut]], [[Maine]], [[North Carolina]], [[Rhode Island]] and [[South Carolina]] ordered out the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]]. The governors of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and Rhode Island also declared [[Martial law#United States of America|martial law]]. In Georgia, the governor ordered the arrest of all picketers and held hundreds in a former [[World War I]] [[prisoner of war]] camp.&lt;ref name="1934strike" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;

Violence also broke out. Three picketers and mill guard were shot to death in Georgia. Six picketers were killed and more than 20 wounded in South Carolina. A picketer was murdered in Rhode Island when National Guardsmen fired into a crowd attempting to storm a rayon knitting mill.&lt;ref name="1934strike" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;

After a mere 22 days, the strike was over. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had established a mediation board in the first week of the strike. The board recommended further study, that workers return to work, and that employers rehire workers without discriminating against strikers. With the UTW able to provide staff, financial resources and strike benefits in only a few places and for a small number of workers, the strike collapsed. Employees attempted to return to work, but mill owners refused to rehire the strikers.&lt;ref name="1934strike" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;  Although the 1934 textile strike was a major defeat for Rieve and the UTW, the union did sign up thousands of new members and declared victory nonetheless.&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;

===Other activities===
Rieve was also active in politics. In 1932, he led a successful push to get the UTW to call for the establishment of a new political party beholden solely to the labor movement. A [[socialism|socialist]], Rieve resigned his membership in the [[Socialist Party of America]] and supported the new [[American Labor Party]].&lt;ref&gt;"Labor Party Plan Launched By Union," ''New York Times,'' September 17, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rieve also was a committed [[industrial union]]ist. The UTW itself was an amalgamated union, a form of industrial union. Rieve's experiences in attempting to organize new members had convinced him that [[industrial unionism]] was the key to building the labor movement. In 1934, Rieve convinced UTW delegates to approve a resolution supporting industrial unionism. This philosophical commitment would prove to be pivotal in Rieve's life.&lt;ref name="Galenson" /&gt;

==Textile Workers Organizing Committee==
In 1935, the American labor movement split over the question of [[craft unionism|craft]] versus industrial unionism. The [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|Committee for Industrial Organization]] (CIO) formed on November 9, 1935, and UTW president [[Thomas McMahon (UTW president)|Thomas McMahon]] was one of the Committee's charter members.&lt;ref name="Phelan"&gt;Phelan, ''William Green: Biography of a Labor Leader,'' 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zieger"&gt;Zieger, ''The CIO 1935-1955,'' 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rieve and McMahon refused to surrender their principles. The two leaders secured passage in December 1935 of a UTW executive council resolution supporting the CIO. In July 1936, Rieve and McMahon gained additional support when the UTW convention approved the formation of the CIO and the UTW's membership in the organization.&lt;ref name="Galenson" /&gt; The AFL executive council "tried" the members of the CIO from July 8 to July 15, 1936, and expelled the UTW and the other CIO member unions on September 5.&lt;ref name="Galenson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Phelan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zieger" /&gt;

Rieve, however, continued to hold out an olive branch to the AFL. In September 1936, he won AFHW support for a resolution asking the AFL to reconsider the expulsion of the CIO unions.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, "Truce Demanded in Labor's Strife," ''New York Times,'' September 12, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; Rieve was unable to organize many new members. Despite meetings with [[John Brophy (labor)|John Brophy]], the CIO's organizing director, the CIO did not consider any major organizing effort in textiles. The UTW's finances were in such poor shape that the union actually cut the number of staff organizers by 20 percent. And despite conditions conducive to organizing, the union established only nine new locals between September 1936 and February 1937.&lt;ref name="Galenson" /&gt; Nevertheless, Rieve became known internationally for his efforts, and was appointed to the national committee of the [[International Labour Organization]].&lt;ref name="Fink" /&gt;

===Collective bargaining===
For most of the next three years, Rieve attempted to fend off a series of attacks on the division's collective bargaining agreements. About a third of the UTW's membership came from the hosiery division in early 1937, and Rieve was in many ways the UTW's true leader.&lt;ref name="Galenson" /&gt;  In the spring of 1937, Rieve led 15,000 Pennsylvania hosiery workers out on strike for a new contract. Pioneering use of the sit-down strike, the strikers successfully closed the mills. The strike's success spread until more than 50,000 union workers were on strike. Rieve eventually signed an agreement giving workers wage increases of 8 to 10 percent.&lt;ref&gt;"15,000 Ready to Open Hosiery Strike Today," ''New York Times,'' March 1, 1937; "Sues to Evict Strikers," ''New York Times,'' April 11, 1937; "Hosiery Workers to Get Rise," ''New York Times,'' July 15, 1937; "Annual Pay Rise of $5,000,000 Is Granted to 30,000 Full-Fashioned Hosiery Workers," ''New York Times,'' July 16, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1938, however, Rieve was forced to act against his own union members. The [[recession of 1937]] had led to a significant worsening of economic conditions. Union members in [[Philadelphia]] demanded a pay increase. Rieve argued that the union had only managed to stop a wage giveback; there was no possibility of securing a wage increase. Nevertheless, workers at more than 50 hosiery plants in the Philadelphia area struck on March 1, 1938. Rieve declared the strike to be "illegal" and actively supported employer and government efforts to end the job action. When the new union contract was signed in mid-July, Rieve and the AFHW had successfully resisted employer demands to cut wages but were forced to agree to a contract clause barring strikes and lockouts for the term of the three-year agreement.&lt;ref&gt;"Union Board Bars Hosiery Wage Cut," ''New York Times,'' January 10, 1938; "Hosiery Mills Idle in 'Illegal Strike'," ''New York Times,'' March 1, 1938; "Sign Hosiery Pact Outlawing Strikes," ''New York Times,'' July 16, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rieve rose to national prominence through his astute leadership of the AFHW. After passage of the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] in June 1938, Rieve was appointed to a federal committee to determine minimum wages in the textile industry.&lt;ref&gt;"Board Appointed on Textile Wages," ''New York Times,'' September 14, 1938; "Picks Hosiery Wage Body," ''New York Times,'' February 3, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation and leadership of TWOC===
In February 1937, McMahon resigned the presidency of UTW to take a state government job in Rhode Island. He was succeeded by [[Francis J. Gorman]].&lt;ref name="Galenson" /&gt;  Meanwhile, the CIO had achieved sudden and large organizing victories in steel, automobile manufacturing and the rubber industry. The organizing victory in steel had come after the CIO had co-opted the [[Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers]] (the AA), using the long-established but moribund union as a means of legitimizing the CIO's efforts in organizing the steel industry. CIO leaders had forced the AA to become part of a new, centrally-run, and efficient organizing project, the [[Steel Workers Organizing Committee]] (SWOC).&lt;ref name="Galenson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zieger" /&gt;

CIO leaders had little confidence in Gorman or the UTW. Gorman had overseen the ill-fated 1934 textile strike. The UTW staff was considered incompetent, and politically behold to McMahon's relatively conservative policies. Rieve coveted the presidency of UTW, and worked to undercut Gorman at every turn—even when that meant disagreeing with actions he himself would otherwise support. Worst of all, UTW was practically bankrupt. Only the hosiery and dyers divisions were self-supporting, and Gorman was actually seeking a $5,000 loan from the CIO to keep the national union afloat.&lt;ref name="Galenson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zieger" /&gt;

From a strategic perspective, UTW was ill-equipped to organize in textiles. Although there were more than 1 million workers in the industry, "textiles" was actually more than 10 distinct industries. Each had its own markets, technology, and labor force. Workers rarely moved between segments of the industry, for their skills were not normally transferable. More than 6,000 textile firms existed, almost none of them strategic. The geographic spread of the industry encompassed 29 states, with nearly 75 percent of all textile employment in the virulently anti-union Deep South.&lt;ref name="Galenson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;

But [[Sidney Hillman]], president of the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]] and a CIO vice president, was adamant that the CIO undertake a comprehensive organizing drive in textiles. Now, two years after the victories in steel and automobiles, Hillman pressured CIO leaders to force the UTW into an agreement similar to that which had created SWOC. On May 9, 1937, the [[Textile Workers Organizing Committee]] (TWOC) was formed. Hillman was named the chairman, and [[Thomas Kennedy (unionist)|Thomas Kennedy]] of the [[United Mine Workers]] its secretary-treasurer. The committee's other five members included Gorman and Rieve.&lt;ref name="Galenson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;

TWOC organized impressive numbers of workers in its first six months. By September 1937, TWOC had organized 215,000 workers, most of them in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]. But the recession of 1937 led to layoffs and sharp drops in TWOC membership. Additionally, Hillman fell critically ill in October 1937. He did not return to the committee's leadership until April 1938, and Rieve (not Thomas) was named the committee's acting chairman.&lt;ref name="Saxon" /&gt; Meanwhile, TWOC opened its organizing drive in the Deep South, but its efforts against the "fortress of southern cotton" proved fruitless. By the spring of 1939, after 18 months of work, TWOC could count only 27,000 Southern members—less than 7 percent of the region's textile workers.&lt;ref name="Galenson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel"&gt;Daniel, ''Culture of Misfortune: An Interpretive History of Textile Unionism in the United States,'' 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of TWUA==
Rieve's tenure as acting chairman saw the beginning of events which would seriously affect the union in the 1950s. The first was Rieve's ejection of the New Bedford Textile Council. The council, a federation of seven textile unions in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], had been confronted by an employer demand in January 1938 to cut wages by 12.5 percent. Rather than stay silent and acquiesce in the wage cut, the council formally approved the wage reduction. The action not only angered other [[New England]] locals, but undercut TWOC organizing efforts in the region. Determined to uphold the authority of TWOC and concerned that the council's action might spark a revolt by other New England local unions, Rieve revoked the charters of the seven locals.&lt;ref name="Daniel" /&gt;

In late 1938, TWOC also saw a revolt from within. Hillman distrusted Gorman, and clearly favored Rieve as the leader of the union which would emerge once TWOC's organizing drives concluded. Gorman and other disgruntled UTW leaders filed suit against TWOC, claiming that UTW funds had been illegally appropriated by TWOC. A Rhode Island [[superior court]] ruled on November 30, 1938, that the TWOC-UTW agreement of March 9 was invalid. Gorman then denounced TWOC and Hillman, and sought to re-affiliate UTW with the AFL. On December 28, 1938, Gorman led a convention of 21 delegates in voting for affiliation with the AFL. The AFL executive council approve the affiliation on February 3, 1939.&lt;ref name="Galenson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gorman was denied the presidency of the reaffiliated union, because AFL president [[William Green (labor leader)|William Green]] told him he must be penalized for agreeing to lead the union out of the AFL in the first place.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hillman and the TWOC leadership branded Gorman a traitor and replaced him with [[George Baldanzi]], president of the UTW's dyers division.&lt;ref name="Galenson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;

Realizing that the March 9 agreement might not survive court scrutiny, Hillman, Rieve and Baldanzi called a convention of UTW and TWOC locals for May 15, 1939. The convention voted to merge the two organizations into a new union, the Textile Workers Union of America (TWUA). Rieve was elected president, and Baldanzi vice president. Both elections were unanimous.&lt;ref name="Saxon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Galenson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"T.W.O.C. Will Meet Today for Merger," ''New York Times,'' May 15, 1939; "C.I.O. Merger Forms Big Textile Union," ''New York Times,'' May 16, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

==TWUA presidency==
Emil Rieve's tenure as president of the TWUA saw the union's prestige and importance soar during [[World War II]] and falter in the 1950s. The union's decline in the 1960s finally led Rieve to retire. Rieve was elected a vice president of the CIO in 1939 after his election as TWUA president.&lt;ref name="Saxon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fink" /&gt;

In 1940, Rieve established a Southern organizing committee and pushed the union deeper into politics. With himself as the head of the organizing project, the union organized [[Marshall Field's]], Lane Cotton and the Erwin Cotton Mills—the latter the first of the "big four" North Carolina cotton mills to be organized.&lt;ref name="Saxon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Galenson" /&gt; Rieve also kept the union politically active, making the TWUA one of the first labor organizations to endorse Franklin D. Roosevelt for president for reelection in 1940.&lt;ref name="Galenson" /&gt;

But in May 1941, the New Bedford Textile Council affiliated with the AFL's UTW, providing the rump union with a significant boost. Soon the UTW had defeated the TWUA in elections in Massachusetts and Tennessee, and was beginning to challenge the TWUA in the Northeast.&lt;ref name="Galenson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel" /&gt;

In March 1941, President Roosevelt created the National Defense Mediation Board, and appointed Rieve as an alternative labor representative. The board had been created to help resolve collective bargaining disputes in defense production, transportation and raw materials industries. The [[United Mine Workers]] were fighting for the [[closed shop]] when the board's public and employer representatives voted that the issue should be submitted to binding arbitration. Angry that the board would not order the mine owners to submit to the closed shop, Rieve and the other CIO members of the board resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Dubofsky and Van Tine, ''John L. Lewis: A Biography,'' 1992; "All C.I.O. Men Quit Mediation Board," ''New York Times,'' November 14, 1941; "President Rejects C.I.O. Resignations,"  ''New York Times,'' November 28, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], however, the president established the [[National War Labor Board (1942–1945)|War Labor Board]] on January 12, 1942, to arbitrate labor disputes and wage settlements. Rieve was appointed as an alternate to the board and served throughout the war. But Rieve and other labor representatives left the body in early 1945 after the public and employer members of the board refused to approve sizeable post-war wage increases for union members.&lt;ref&gt;"President Names War Labor Body," ''New York Times,'' December 14, 1941; "CIO May Quit WLB, New Reports Say," ''New York Times,'' February 22, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; Rieve released the TWUA from its wartime no-strike pledge shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;"No-Strike Pledge Voided for 100,000." ''New York Times.'' February 21, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Rieve had purged his union of [[communism|communists]] in the mid-1930s, he found himself accused of communist dictatorship in 1944. American Labor Party (ALP) leader Sidney Hillman felt that the 1944 presidential election would be a close one in [[New York (state)|New York]] state. Hillman proposed that communists be permitted to play a role in the party, hoping to tip the state toward Roosevelt. ALP leader [[David Dubinsky]] felt the communists should be expelled from the ALP. Rieve supported Hillman. Rieve was labeled a communist, and Samuel Baron (the general manager of the TWUA) resigned in protest from the union. Nevertheless, Hillman's proposal won the approval of ALP delegates, and Roosevelt easily carried New York in the general election.&lt;ref&gt;"ALP Heads Reject Hillman Proposal," ''New York Times,'' January 21, 1944; "Role of Dictator Held Hillman Aim," ''New York Times,'' February 7, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, Rieve was a member of a CIO delegation to the Soviet Union. He was an ardent anti-communist, however, and strongly criticized the Soviet Union afterward. Two years later, Rieve became one of the first CIO leaders to sign the non-communist oath required by the [[Taft-Hartley Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Raskin, "Russia Criticized by Office of CIO," ''New York Times,'' April 25, 1946; "Textile Union to File Non-Communist Oath," ''New York Times,'' October 7, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secession movement===
In 1948, Rieve expelled his old division, the American Federation of Hosiery Workers, from the TWUA. The division, which had 20,000 members, was a major backer of TWUA executive vice-president George Baldanzi. Baldanzi was strongly critical of Rieve's leadership of the union, and argued that Rieve was not doing enough to organize new members or win contract improvements. When the Hosiery Workers withheld dues in protest of the Rieve administration's policies, Rieve pulled the division's charter.&lt;ref&gt;"CIO Textile Workers Oust Hosiery Rebels," ''New York Times,'' April 23, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tension between Rieve and Baldanzi worsened over the next two years. In May 1950, Rieve attempted to unseat Baldanzi as executive vice-president. Baldanzi, however, beat back the attempt and retained his seat.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, "Textile Union Rift has C.I.O. Worried," ''New York Times,'' April 8, 1950; "C.I.O. Textile Union Split Over High Post," ''New York Times,'' April 30, 1950; Fenton, "Textile Union Re-elects Baldanzi Oven Opposition of Other Officers," ''New York Times,'' May 5, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; Rieve then tried to amend the TWUA constitution to remove the executive vice-president from the line of succession if the president should fall ill or die. This attempt, too, was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;"Textile Union Test Is Won By Baldanzi," ''New York Times,'' May 6, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rieve fired Samuel Baron, a Baldanzi supporter and the regional director of the TWUA in Canada, in March 1951. Baron retained his elected position as a TWUA vice president, however. For the next four months, the TWUA was roiled by the firing, with the Baldanzi faction attempting to overturn Baron's dismissal and drive Rieve from office. In early June, the TWUA executive council upheld Rieve's action, albeit by a slim majority.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, "Factions Embroil C.I.O. Textile Union," ''New York Times,'' March 9, 1951; "Open Row Splits Textile Workers," ''New York Times,'' March 11, 1951; "Union Upholds Rieve," ''New York Times,'' June 10, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; Six weeks later, the Baldanzi faction announced a "democracy movement" within the TWUA and submitted a full slate of candidates to challenge Rieve for leadership of the union.&lt;ref&gt;"Anti-Rieve Faction Confers Here Today," ''Associated Press,'' July 21, 1951; "350 Rieve Foes Plan for T.W.U. Changes," ''Associated Press,'' July 22, 1951; "Democracy Is Union Issue," ''Associated Press,'' July 23, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1951, the AFHWA re-affiliated with the American Federation of Labor.&lt;ref&gt;"Hosiery Union in A.F.L.," ''New York Times,'' August 10, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 30, 1952, TWUA delegates re-elected Rieve as president of the union. The vote was 1,223 to 720, although most observers claimed this was a startlingly close election given Rieve's near-total control over the union. The convention was a contentious one. Delegates engaged in heated debate, with many exchanges devolving into shouting matches. Rieve was forced to alter a number of his policy decisions in order to win delegate support. On the last day of the convention, Rieve fulfilled one such pledge by announcing that he was resigning from the [[Wage Stabilization Board]] in the midst of a major dispute over steelworker wages in order to devote more time to union business and less to government and other duties.&lt;ref&gt;"Textile Workers in Stormy Session," ''New York Times,'' May 1, 1952; "Rieve Holds Rule of Textile Union," ''Associated Press,'' May 2, 1952; "C.I.O. Textile Head Quits Wage Board," ''New York Times,'' May 3, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baldanzi, no longer an office-holder in the TWUA, announced he had been hired as an organizer with the American Federation of Labor and would be working with the TWUA's arch-rival, the United Textile Workers. He called for disaffected TWUA locals to follow him into the AFL. A number of local TWUA union presidents and leaders followed him into the UTW as organizers.&lt;ref&gt;"Defeated in C.I.O., Switches to A.F.L.," ''Associated Press,'' May 16, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next several months, nearly 40 TWUA locals representing 20,000 members—about 2 percent of the union's membership—attempted to disaffiliate from the national union and join the AFL. The secession movement was a national one, involving locals in Canada, Maine, the Carolinas and mid-Atlantic states. Rieve accused Baldanzi and the dissident locals of [[dual unionism]]. Rieve induced CIO president [[Philip Murray]] to threaten wholesale raiding of AFL unions if the UTW accepted the breakaway locals into that union. Rieve suspended local officials, trusteed local unions, impounded local union funds and padlocked local union offices, and sent national staff into wavering locals to shore up support for the TWUA. By August, more than 50,000 TWUA members had left the union for the UTW. But Rieve's actions blunted the secession movement. High-level talks between AFL and CIO leaders eventually put a stop to the raids.&lt;ref&gt;"C.I.O. Acts to Bar Defections to A.F.L.," ''Associated Press,'' May 17, 1952; "Six Textile Locals Quit C.I.O. for A.F.L.," ''Associated Press,'' May 18, 1952; "C.I.O. Textile Bolt Spreads in South," ''Associated Press,'' May 19, 1952; "Union Chiefs Fight Over Textile Shift," ''New York Times,'' May 20, 1952; "Officers of 11 Locals Ousted," ''United Press International,'' May 22, 1952; "Union Impounds Funds," ''Associated Press,'' July 24, 1952; "A.F.L. Textile Union Claims Switch of 50,000 From C.I.O., Denies 'Raids'," ''United Press International,'' August 18, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis severely weakened Rieve's political position within the union, and led to collective bargaining difficulties. Membership losses were particularly high in the South and Canada. Although most of Rieve's political opponents had left the TWUA for the UTW, the secession movement led many of the remaining members to question Rieve's leadership of the union. The union's finances were significant affected by the disaffiliations, forcing members to raise dues to cover a budget shortfall. Rieve claimed that only 12,500 members had disaffiliated, but admitted that the union's membership had fallen by 400,000 as it defended itself from raids rather than organized new members.&lt;ref&gt;Stetson, "Rieve Lists Woes of Textile Union," ''New York Times,'' May 4, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

The secession movement in the TWUA in 1952 aided in the merger between the AFL and CIO in 1955. Both Philip Murray and William Green had died in November 1952. The sudden outbreak of raiding deeply alarmed their successors, [[Walter Reuther]] and [[George Meany]]. The dissension within the TWUA led to a series of "no-raid" pacts between the AFL and CIO, agreements which helped pave the way for eventual merger of the two labor federations. Rieve played an important role in the AFL-CIO merger talks, pushing for merger as a solution to raiding and serving on various merger committees.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, ''AFL-CIO: Labor United,'' 1956; Stetson, "C.I.O. Union Backs Textile Raid Pact," ''New York Times,'' May 8, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other activities===
After the merger of the AFL and CIO, Rieve was elected a vice president of the merged labor federation.&lt;ref name="Saxon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fink" /&gt;  As Rieve's position within the TWUA deteriorated, however, he became nationally-known for a pushing a variety of causes. He stridently attacked the Taft-Hartley Act, and declared that the law had permitted Southern textile executives to engage in a "widespread conspiracy" to destroy the union's Southern locals.&lt;ref&gt;"War on Union Laid to Textile Group," ''United Press International,'' April 27, 1952; "Taft Law Changes Urged," ''United Press International,'' April 17, 1953; Loftus, "Union Scores Bias Despite South's Plea," ''New York Times,'' May 19, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a vocal and extremely critical opponent of President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], and acted as the AFL-CIO's [[point man]] against the president while Meany and other leaders muted their criticism. Despite public disavowals of his extreme attacks on the administration, AFL-CIO leaders privately supported his actions and in 1955 he was named to an AFL-CIO committee on economic policy.&lt;ref name="Saxon" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stetson, "President Scored by Textile Union," ''New York Times,'' May 3, 1954; "Democrats Told Not to Ape G.O.P.," ''New York Times,'' May 15, 1956; "A.F.L.-C.I.O Unit Named," ''New York Times,'' December 30, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rieve continued to play a role in international affairs as well. When [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]] visited the U.S. for 13 days in September 1959, Rieve was a member of an AFL-CIO delegation which met with Khrushchev for three and a half hours in a closed-door session. He excoriated Soviet labor union officials for being puppets of the Communist regime and attacked Khrushchev as a dictator and war-monger.&lt;ref name="Saxon" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raskin, "Premier and Labor Men Find Views Poles Apart," ''New York Times,'' September 21, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement and death==
Faced with rapidly declining membership, the 63-year-old Rieve retired as TWUA president at the union's ninth biennial convention in 1956. However, he continued to serve on the union's executive board as chairman until 1960. He was named "president emeritus" and given a lifetime annuity of $15,000 a year.&lt;ref name="Fink" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fink" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Textile Workers Head to Quit Post in May," ''New York Times,'' March 13, 1956; "Textile Union Elects," ''New York Times,'' May 18, 1956; "Union Gives Rieve $15,000 Annually," ''New York Times,'' June 3, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rieve was forced to retire from the TWUA executive board in 1964. During a speech at the union's biennial convention, Rieve blasted the union's leadership for allowing the membership to fall to a mere 127,000 and for failing to organize non-union plants. Rieve retired as a vice president of the AFL-CIO after losing his TWUA office. Although Rieve had pushed for his successor, [[William Pollock (labor leader)|William Pollock]], to be elected to the AFL-CIO executive council, Reuther supported [[Ralph Helstein]], the president of the [[United Packinghouse Workers of America|United Packinghouse, Food and Allied Workers]].&lt;ref name="Saxon" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, "A.F.L.-C.I.O. Selects Meany's Council Choices," ''New York Times,'' December 15, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his forced retirement, Rieve retired to [[Florida]], where he lived quietly. Emil Rieve died of [[Cardiac arrest|heart failure]] at his home in [[Lauderhill, Florida]], on January 24, 1975.&lt;ref name="Saxon" /&gt;

'''Fenris''' ('''Andrea von Strucker''' and '''Andreas von Strucker''') are two [[fiction]]al characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. They are the [[Germans|German]] [[twin]] children of supervillain [[Baron Strucker]] of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] and the half-siblings of [[Werner von Strucker]]. 

Andrea von Strucker and Andreas von Strucker appear in the television series ''[[The Gifted (U.S. TV series)|The Gifted]]'', portrayed by Caitlin Mehner and Paul Cooper respectively.

==Publication history==
Created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Romita Jr.]], the von Strucker twins first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #194 (June 1985) in their civilian identity and in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #200 (December 1985) as Fenris.

==Fictional character biography==
Andrea and Andreas are the children of the terrorist organization [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] leader [[Baron Strucker|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]]. While the two were still in their mother's uterus, they were genetically modified which gave them bio-energy powers which they can use when in physical contact with one another (usually when holding hands). Strucker indoctrinated his children in the beliefs of [[white supremacy]], Nazism and the [[Fourth Reich]]. In adulthood, the twins became the [[supervillain]]s known as "Fenris" and led the Fenris terrorist organization.

Like their father, they are white supremacists. The Strucker twins have gone up against [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] when Storm interrupts Andreas' attempted assault on a native woman in Africa. Andrea retaliates for Storm's humiliation of her brother by shooting her in the head and leaving her to die.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #196&lt;/ref&gt; The Strucker twins despise [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] for the role in their father's seeming death some years after World War II. They conduct acts of terrorism and finally attack Magneto during the trial in Paris by the International Court of Justice for crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #200&lt;/ref&gt; The [[X-Men]] foil their assassination attempt, but Fenris manages to escape by allowing themselves to be swept into the old city sewers. The twins later resurface as part of a [[Upstarts (comics)|group of mutant millionaires]] who engage in a campaign of murder as part of a game organized by the mutant telepath [[Gamesmaster (comics)|Gamesmaster]] and the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]'s former Black Queen [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]. The twins tried to acquire [[Omega Red]] for the Upstarts but failed. The twins ultimately met their match, though, when they tried to kill the former [[New Mutants|New Mutant]] [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]. Wolfsbane and the [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] team easily beat the twins.

The twins joined a conference of powerful criminal leaders who intended to divide up what's left by the fallen [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]'s empire. Among the members of the conference were [[Slug (comics)|Slug]], [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] and [[Werner von Strucker]]. The twins did not believe Werner was actually their sibling. This, and other arguments, caused the conference to degenerate into a shouting, shooting and blasting match. Fenris attempted to kill Hammerhead but was rescued. Their sibling is soon after killed by their father attending the conference disguised as Werner's assistant. The twins resurfaced, where they were seen working with Baron Strucker.&lt;ref&gt;''Citizen V'' mini-series&lt;/ref&gt; They fight [[Citizen V]] (John Watkins III), however, Andrea discovers that Citizen V is actually [[Helmut Zemo]]'s mind transferred into the real Citizen V's body by [[Fixer (comics)|Techno]] after being decapitated by [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]] under [[Henry Peter Gyrich]]'s orders. Zemo quickly kills Andrea to keep her from telling anyone the truth.

[[File:Swordsmanx.png|left|thumb|Andreas von Strucker as [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] (middle) and [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]]. Art by [[Mike Deodato]].]] 
After Andrea's death, Zemo has the [[Purple Man]] brainwash Andreas into taking the "'''[[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]]'''" alias. Purple Man has him flay the skin from Andrea's corpse to incorporate the resulting leather into his sword's hilt, allowing him to channel their shared powers through his sword. Andreas breaks free of Purple Man's control and joins the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. Andreas continues to be a member under the Thunderbolts' new leadership. Teammate and current field leader [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] has approached Andreas with a reassurance. If he helps kill [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]], Moonstone would be able to make a move to usurp the mentally fragile [[Norman Osborn]] as the Thunderbolts' director. Thus two factions seem to be forming amongst the Thunderbolts with Andreas and Moonstone on one side while Songbird and [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]] stand on the other. Despite his considerable skill, he has been defeated twice; the first is when [[Jack Flag]] hit him with the flat of his own sword, and the second is when [[Steel Spider]] threw him through a window and a flat-screen television using a metal limb.&lt;ref&gt;''New Thunderbolts'' vol. 2, #114&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the control of four imprisoned telepaths, Swordsman has taken over the "'''[[Baron Strucker]]'''" title and shaved his head in his father's honor. He has gained the loyalty of several guards by paying them well, and ordered them to set off a bomb in the ''Zeus'' (the Thunderbolts' carrier) to initiate a lockdown. He declares to one of his guards that Norman will bring him back his sister or everyone in Thunderbolts Mountain will be killed.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #118&lt;/ref&gt; After a detachment of guards kill most of his loyal guards, Strucker kills off the remaining attacking guards. He then encounters [[Mac Gargan|Venom]] declaring to eat Strucker. The two fight, and Strucker runs Venom through with his sword, activating his energy powers while the sword is in Venom's body.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #119&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, Osborn snaps from the pressures of running the Thunderbolts, and the Green Goblin brutally attacks Andreas, [[Crucifixion|crucifying]] him to a wall with small goblin-daggers.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #120&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long afterward, it is discovered that Andreas used [[Arnim Zola]] to make a clone of Andrea von Strucker. Although Andreas has his sister back, he decides to complete his Thunderbolts contract, leaving the group as a free man. In order to protect Andrea's clone while on missions, Andreas skins his arm, giving the flesh to his sister's clone to hold, allowing her to use their shared powers.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #122&lt;/ref&gt; Andrea's clone accompanies Andreas and the Thunderbolts during the [[Secret Invasion|battle]] against the [[Skrull]]s, and witnesses as Moonstone incapacitates Andreas and attempts to make a deal with the Skrulls.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #123&lt;/ref&gt; Andrea's clone then attacks Moonstone. While she is preoccupied with Moonstone, [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] kills her from behind. Osborn later convinces Andreas that the Skrulls killed his sister.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #124&lt;/ref&gt; Andreas also saves Songbird when Bullseye attempts to kill her.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #127&lt;/ref&gt; Andreas later confronts Osborn with the revelation that he was not being offered a slot on Osborn's [[Dark Avengers|personal Avengers]] as well as never planning on fulfilling the vow to resurrect his sister or to give him a full Presidential pardon after his contract ended. During the confrontation, his momentarily insane employer stabs Andreas through the chest, apparently killing him with his own sword, and throwing him out over the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Reign'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrea and Andreas returned to the living and have opened Club Fenris, a supervillain club in Manhattan. When questioned about their demise and subsequent return from the dead, they stated that their father "took care of it".&lt;ref&gt;''Illuminati'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
As a result of genetic engineering with their X-Genes when they were still [[in utero]], Fenris were able to fly and generate energy blasts, but only when they were holding hands. When holding hands, Andreas could generate concussive force blasts while Andrea could generate disintegration beams. Swordsman uses various hidden blades; his primary sword blade is sheathed in an adamantium alloy and can shoot a [[grappling hook]]-like projectile. His sword's hilt is wrapped with Andrea's skin to release powerful [[bioelectric]] blasts of concussive force.

==Other versions==

===House of M===
Andrea and Andreas were seen assisting their father in a resistance against both mutants and Kree. Both of them end up killed in action.&lt;ref&gt;''New Thunderbolts'' #11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Andrea von Strucker and Andreas von Strucker are androgynous mutant twins that can generate heat blasts when they touch each other that seek [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] supremacy through economic control as German business tycoons. Co-Presidents of the global investment firm '''Fenris International''', they're deeply involved in [[corporate crime]] to "end the economic domination of Homo sapiens" while masquerading as an honorable investment banking firm with offices in the [[Empire State Building]].&lt;ref name="mnyc"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 49–51 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also shown that they are lovers{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}. They have dealings with [[Black Tom Cassidy]], and have tried to recruit [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]; Rogue rejected the offer and Gambit was already in their employ but rebelled to help Rogue escape. It is revealed that the Fenris twins are behind the recent [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] attacks with the [[Bolivar Trask|creator]] of the first wave of mutant hunting robots. It has also been revealed that they are tied to the Mutant Liberation Front. As a result of their activities involving the Sentinels and the Mutant Liberation Front, [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] apparently killed the twins during their battle with Bishop's X-Men team.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate X-Men'' # 87&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6360">[[File:Glyndwr Michael.jpg|thumb|The corpse of Michael in April 1943, while dressed as William Martin]]

'''Glyndwr Michael''' (4 January 1909 – 24 January 1943)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/4041661 |title=CWGC Casualty Details |work=[[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] |year=2011 |accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Welsh homeless man whose body was used in [[Operation Mincemeat]], the successful Second World War deception plan that lured German forces to [[Greece]] prior to the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]. The invasion was a success, although the extent to which this can be attributed to the ruse is unknown.

==Life and death==
Michael was born in [[Aberbargoed]] in [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] in south [[Wales]]. Before leaving the town, he held part-time jobs as a gardener and labourer. His father Thomas, a coal miner, killed himself when Michael was 15 and his mother died when he was 31. Michael, homeless, friendless, depressed and with no money, drifted to [[London]] where he lived on the streets. 

He was found in an abandoned warehouse close to [[King's Cross, London|King's Cross]], seriously ill from ingesting [[rat poison]] that contained [[phosphorus]]. Two days later, he died at age 34 in [[St Pancras, London|St. Pancras]] Hospital. His death may have been suicide, although he may have simply been hungry, as the poison he ingested was a paste smeared on bread crusts to attract rats.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Operation Mincemeat==
{{main article|Operation Mincemeat}}
After being ingested, [[phosphide]] reacts with [[hydrochloric acid]] in the stomach, generating [[phosphine]], a highly toxic gas. Bentley Purchase, [[coroner]] of St. Pancras District, explained, "This dose was not sufficient to kill him outright, and its only effect was so to impair the functioning of the liver that he died a little time afterwards". When Purchase obtained Glyndwr's body, it was identified as being in suitable condition for a man who would appear to have floated ashore several days after having died at sea by [[hypothermia]] and [[drown]]ing.

Before Michael, finding a usable [[cadaver]] had been difficult, as indiscreet inquiries would cause talk, and it was impossible to tell a dead man's next of kin what the body was wanted for. The dead man's parents had died and no known relatives were found.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite web| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/book_extracts/article6986802.ece | title=Operation Mincemeat: full story of how corpse tricked the Nazis |publisher=The Times |date=14 January 2010 |first=Ben |last=Macintyre}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body was released on the condition that the man's real identity would never be revealed. [[Ewen Montagu]] later claimed the man died from [[pneumonia]], and that the family had been contacted and permission obtained, but neither of those things was true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.allbusiness.com/government/government-bodies-offices-government/13734274-1.html |title=The Real Man Who Never Was |first=Anna |last=Pukas  |work=allbusiness.com |date=15 January 2010 |accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April, [[Norman Jewell|Lt. Norman Jewell]], captain of the submarine ''[[HMS Seraph (P219)|Seraph]]'', read the [[39th Psalm]], and Michael's body was gently pushed into the sea where the tide would bring it ashore off [[Huelva]] on the Spanish Atlantic coast.

[[File:William Martin.jpg|thumb|alt=A large black marble memorial slab with flowers|Grave of Glyndwr Michael in Huelva, Spain]]
Attached to Michael's body was a briefcase containing secret documents that had been fabricated by the British intelligence service.  The purpose was to make German intelligence (which was known to have operatives in Huelva) think Michael had been a courier delivering documents to a British general.  The documents were crafted to deceive the Germans into thinking that the British were preparing to invade Greece and Sardinia, rather than Sicily, and they succeeded in doing so.

Michael's body was picked up by a fisherman and he was buried as Major William Martin with full military honours. His grave lies in Huelva's cemetery of Nuestra Señora, in the San Marco section. The headstone reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;William Martin, born 29 March 1907, died 24 April 1943, beloved son of John Glyndwyr Martin and the late Antonia Martin of Cardiff, Wales, [[Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori|Dulce et Decorum est pro Patria Mori]], R.I.P.''&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[[Ben Macintyre]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=q6JAazB9nCwC&amp;pg=PA266 Operation Mincemeat]; How a Dead Man and a Bizarre Plan Fooled the Nazis and Assured an Allied Victory, Harmony Books, Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Latin phrase translates as "It is sweet and fitting to die for one's country." In 1998, however, the British Government revealed the body's true identity. To the gravestone was added:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Glyndwr Michael; Served as Major William Martin, RM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/search/certificate.aspx?casualty=4041661 |title=CWGC Certificate |work=Commonwealth War Graves Commission |year=2011 |accessdate=23 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615061830/http://www.cwgc.org/search/certificate.aspx?casualty=4041661 |archivedate=15 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wllmb |title= Operation Mincemeat |work=[[BBC Two]] |year=2011 |accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A plaque commemorating Glyndwr Michael is now also on the war memorial in [[Aberbargoed]]. It is headed "Y Dyn Na Fu Erioed" (translation – "The Man Who Never Was").

==Early life==

==Career==

===Early work (1984–88)===
Graham's first film appearance was an uncredited cameo in ''[[Mrs. Soffel]]'' (1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/features/the-evolution-of-heather-graham/mrs-soffel-1984|title=The Evolution Of Heather Graham|first=Matt|last=Maytum|date=May 26, 2011|work=[[Total Film]]|accessdate=June 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first credited film appearance was in the television film ''[[Student Exchange]]''. In 1986, she appeared on a special "Teen Week" episode of the [[NBC]] game show ''[[Scrabble (game show)|Scrabble]]''. Then she appeared in numerous television commercials, and an episode of the sitcom ''[[Growing Pains]]'' in 1987. Her first high-profile starring role came in the [[Corey Haim]]/[[Corey Feldman]] vehicle ''[[License to Drive]]'' (1988), as a popular girl named Mercedes Lane, who serves as the love interest of Haim's character. Her efforts won her a [[Young Artist Award]] nomination in the ''Best Young Actress in a Motion Picture Comedy or Fantasy'' category. Her strict parents forbade her to accept a role in the [[black comedy]] ''[[Heathers]]'' (1988), which had an expletive-rich script.&lt;ref name=HC/&gt; The same year, she had an uncredited appearance as [[Danny DeVito]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s mother in ''[[Twins (1988 film)|Twins]]'' (during the laboratory conception flashback).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lebeauleblog.com/2012/09/05/what-the-hell-happened-to-heather-graham/|title=What The Hell Happened to Heather Graham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===From ''Drugstore Cowboy'' to ''Swingers'' (1989–1996)===
In 1989, Graham was featured in [[Gus Van Sant]]'s ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]'' as Nadine, a young drug-addicted accomplice of the two main characters (played by [[Matt Dillon]] and [[Kelly Lynch]]). Her performance gave her career an initial boost and earned her a nomination for the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actress]]. She rejected a steady role in a soap opera and a three-picture deal with a major studio because she thought it would be too restrictive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lou|first=Linda|title=The more risks, the more rewards|url=http://159.54.226.237/99_issues/990808/990808graham.html|work=USA Weekend Magazine |accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Drugstore Cowboy'' she appeared in [[Lawrence Kasdan]]'s dark comedy ''[[I Love You to Death]]'' (1990), alongside [[William Hurt]] and [[Keanu Reeves]] and the rock-and-roll coming-of-age film ''[[Shout (film)|Shout]]'' (1991), for which she received a nomination for the [[Young Artist Award]] for Best Actress Starring in a Motion Picture.

After co-starring with [[Benicio del Toro]] in a [[Calvin Klein]] commercial directed by [[David Lynch]], the director cast her as Annie Blackburn in ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', where she appeared in the final six episodes. Following the show's cancellation, Graham reprised the role of Blackburn in the 1992 prequel film ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]''.&lt;ref name="grouchoreviews.com"/&gt;

She featured in ''[[Diggstown]]'' (1992), alongside [[James Woods]]; the well-received ''[[Six Degrees of Separation (film)|Six Degrees of Separation]]'' (1993), alongside [[Will Smith]]; and ''[[The Ballad of Little Jo]]'' (1993), alongside [[Ian McKellen]] before re-teaming with Gus Van Sant for the critically panned [[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (film)|film adaptation]] of ''[[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (novel)|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues]]'', alongside [[Uma Thurman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1994)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/even_cowgirls_get_the_blues/|website=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year she co-starred as Mary Kennedy Taylor in ''[[Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle]]''. In 1995 she starred as Jackie in the poorly received ''Desert Winds'' and guest-starred in an episode of the television series ''[[Fallen Angels (TV series)|Fallen Angels]]''. She had a small but important role in ''[[Swingers (1996 film)|Swingers]]'' (1996), where she played Lorraine, [[Jon Favreau]]'s love interest.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} She also played a small role as Maggie Bowen in ''[[Entertaining Angels: The Dorothy Day Story]]'' (1996).

===Wider industry and public recognition (1997–2003)===
Graham's popularity significantly increased after she appeared as Brandi, a young [[porn star]], nicknamed Rollergirl, in [[Paul Thomas Anderson]]'s critically acclaimed, award-winning ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' (1997). The cast received a nomination for the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]]. The same year she also starred in the [[Gregg Araki]] film [[Nowhere (film)|Nowhere]], and had a cameo in the horror hit ''[[Scream 2]]''. She was subsequently cast in ''[[Two Girls and a Guy]]'' (1998),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/two-girls-and-a-guy-1998|author=Ebert, Roger|title=TWO GIRLS AND A GUY|website=RogerEbert.com|publisher=Chicago Sun-Times|date=24 April 1998|}}&lt;/ref&gt; a film mainly based upon dialogue between the characters which was shot in 11 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|title=Two Girls and A Guy|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117329520/|work=Variety|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which co-starred [[Robert Downey Jr.]] and [[Natasha Gregson]]; and the sci-fi film ''[[Lost in Space (film)|Lost in Space]]'', which was met with mostly negative reviews, and grossed $69,117,629 domestically on a production budget of $80 million.

She starred as [[Felicity Shagwell]] in the sequel ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me]]'' (1999), which was a box-office hit. Shagwell is one of her best-known roles and became a fan favorite.&lt;ref name="cineoutsider1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Raw|first=Timothy E.|title=The spy who misunderstood me|url=http://www.cineoutsider.com/articles/stories/h/heather_graham_interview.html|website=www.cineoutsider.com|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her turn as Shagwell also earned her a nomination for the [[Saturn Award for Best Actress]]. She appeared in the music video for [[Lenny Kravitz]]'s cover of "[[American Woman (song)|American Woman]]". Also in 1999, Graham co-starred as Daisy in the movie ''[[Bowfinger]]'', opposite [[Steve Martin]] and [[Eddie Murphy]].

The 2000 film ''[[Committed (2000 film)|Committed]]'' was her first starring vehicle. She played Joline, a devoted-beyond-reason young wife looking for the husband who left her. While the film itself received mixed-to-negative reviews, critics felt that "Graham shows she can play a central character" but noted "she's not enough to make ''Committed'' successful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committed (2000)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1096844-committed/|website=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year she co-starred as Annie Matthews, an unhappily married woman, in [[Edward Burns]]' ''[[Sidewalks of New York (2001 film)|Sidewalks of New York]]''. In 2003, she starred with [[Joseph Fiennes]] in [[Chen Kaige]]'s English-language debut film ''[[Killing Me Softly (film)|Killing Me Softly]]'', which received overwhelmingly negative response from critics and a 0% at [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with the consensus being: "Respected director Chen Kaige's first English-language film is a spectacularly misguided erotic thriller, with ludicrous plot twists and cringe-worthy dialogue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Killing Me Softly (2002)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/killing_me_softly/|website=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the site also rated it No.&amp;nbsp;12 on the countdown of the worst films over the last ten years.

In 2003, she also posed for a photoshoot by photographer Sam Jones, during which she was levitated several feet into the air by a magician, who later also sawed her in half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=FHM |url=http://www.fhm.com/girls/covergirls/heather-graham |title=FHM Covergirls&amp;nbsp;– Heather Graham |website=FHM.com |date=December 10, 2008 |accessdate=July 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831070050/http://www.fhm.com/girls/covergirls/heather-graham |archivedate=August 31, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2003, Graham appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine for an article titled "The Science of Meditation".&lt;ref name="The Science of Meditation"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20030804,00.html "The Science of Meditation"] August 4, 2003, ''Time''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heather Graham — Peep Show|url=http://www.fhm.com/girls/covergirls/heather-graham|website=www.fhm.com|accessdate=December 3, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115142611/http://www.fhm.com/girls/covergirls/heather-graham|archivedate=November 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; To promote ''Emily's Reasons Why Not'', she had posed for a ''[[Life Magazine]]'' cover story, printed weeks in advance of the assumed series schedule, referring to her as "TV's sexiest star" which appeared in the January 27, 2006 issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=''Life Magazine'' Interview| url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001919450| website=editorandpublisher.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defamer.com/hollywood/heather-graham/heather-grahams-permanent-weekend-151250.php |title=Defamer.com |website=Defamer.com |date=January 27, 2006 |accessdate=July 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218134603/http://defamer.com/hollywood/heather-graham/heather-grahams-permanent-weekend-151250.php |archivedate=December 18, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham is often cast in sexual roles including those of Felicity Shagwell (''Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me''), porn stars Rollergirl (''Boogie Nights'') and Sharonna (''The Guru''), prostitute [[Mary Jane Kelly|Mary Kelly]] (''From Hell''), porn director Margaret (''About Cherry'') and stripper Jade (''The Hangover'' and ''The Hangover, Part III''). She stated she finds these types of roles and the issue of sexuality fascinating, and believes that "our culture sends out mixed messages to women about sex. Are women supposed to be sexually alive people, or are we supposed to be 'good' mothers who would never do those things?" and that she likes "the fact some of my roles maybe help people open their minds about the way they think about sex".&lt;ref name="Heather Graham: I'm a nerd"&gt;{{cite news|title=Heather Graham: I'm a nerd|url=http://www.news.com.au/news/heather-graham-im-a-nerd/story-fnejnq21-1226518061674|website=www.news.com.au|accessdate=December 3, 2012|date=November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heather Graham - Biography|url=http://www.talktalk.co.uk/entertainment/film/biography/artist/heather-graham/biography/38|website=www.talktalk.co.uk|accessdate=December 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heather Graham-Tantra"&gt;{{cite web|title=Heather Graham, 'tantra sex'|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/07/heather-graham-tantric-se_n_212240.html|website=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Graham became the spokeswoman and TV model for the [[Garnier]] brand of hair care products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heather Graham New Mane Attraction for Garnier 100% Color|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/heather-graham-new-mane-attraction-for-garnier-100-color-54281622.html|accessdate=August 30, 2015|website=prnewswire.com|date=April 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Graham has been estranged from her parents in the past, supposedly due to their strict [[Irish Catholic]] beliefs and her rebellion as a teenager. Regarding the media's perception of her relationship with her parents, she stated: "I don't really like to talk about my parents. Because I just feel that it gets misinterpreted in the press..."&lt;ref name="culture.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sidewalks of New York : Interview With Heather Graham|url=http://culture.com/articles/577/sidewalks-of-new-york-interview-with-heather-graham.phtml|website=culture.com|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The more risks, the more rewards|url=http://159.54.226.237/99_issues/990808/990808graham.html|website=USA Weekend Magazine|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been practicing [[Transcendental Meditation technique|transcendental meditation]] since 1991&lt;ref name="Heather Graham-Tantra"/&gt; after being introduced to it by [[David Lynch]]. She also expressed her dislike of [[reality television]], stating in a 2007 interview: "I think some of it, it seems strange – why do we all want to watch people be so miserable? Other people’s pain and misery – it seems kind of sad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heather Graham Interviewed – 'Gray Matters' |url=http://collider.com/entertainment/interviews/archive_detail.asp/aid/3630/tcid/1/pg/2 |work=Collider.com |accessdate=November 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110130524/http://collider.com/entertainment/interviews/archive_detail.asp/aid/3630/tcid/1/pg/2 |archivedate=November 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hélène Boudreau''' (born June 19, 1969) is an [[Acadian]] and [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] Canadian artist and author of children's books, whose writing has appeared in various Canadian publications and her Maritime-themed art has been exhibited by the [[Toronto Public Library]] and other local vicinities.&lt;ref name="Writers' Union"&gt;{{cite web|last=Boudreau|first=Helene|title=Members' Pages|url=http://www.writersunion.ca/ww_profile.asp?mem=1952&amp;L=|work=Writers&amp; Writing|publisher=The Writers' Union of Canada|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hélène Boudreau was born and raised in [[Petit-de-Grat, Nova Scotia|Petit de Grat, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia]] in a French [[Acadian French|Acadian]] community to parents of  Acadian and Métis descent and can speak both English and French fluently.&lt;ref name="Authors' Booking Service"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hélène Boudreau|url=http://authorsbooking.com/2043/authors/Helene_Boudreau.html|work=Authors' Booking Service|publisher=Marsha Skrypuch, Valerie Sherrard|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up in a large family having had three brothers and four sisters. After graduating from Isle Madame District High School in 1987, Boudreau attended [[Dalhousie University]] where she earned a degree in biology and began working as a Park Interpreter for the [[Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society|Canadian Parks Service]]. Afterwards she began training as a Registered Respiratory Therapist at the Victoria General School of Allied Health. It wasn't until she was in her late twenties when she moved to [[Ontario]] from her [[Maritimes|Maritime]] hometown in order to begin her career as a children's author.

==Career==

When asked what inspired Boudreau to become a children’s author, she recalled:
 
{{cquote|I first thought of a being a children's author in 4th/5th grade when a teacher of mine published a picture book. It was very inspirational for me to see someone I knew accomplish such an unimaginable feat. That day, I went straight home and wrote and illustrated a [[picture book]] of my own but it wasn't until much later (almost thirty years) when I actually put that dream of being an author into action.}}

In 2007, Boudreau was short-listed in the [[Surrey International Writers' Conference|Surrey International Writing Contest]], in the "Writing For Young People" category for ''With Measured Breath: A YA short story''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hélène Boudreau|url=http://www.writersunion.ca/ww_profile.asp?mem=1952&amp;L=|work=The Writers' Union Of Canada|publisher=The Writers' Union Of Canada|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, Boudreau began working on her first book called ''Acadian Star'' after many years of having settled in Ontario. The novel was aimed at middle school children and tells the adventures of a young girl named Meg Gallant who takes part in a home town competition with her friend Neve, called the Acadian Star. It was published in 2008, by [[Nimbus Publishing]] and was soon nominated for the 2009/2010 ''Hackmatack Children’s Choice Award''. ''Acadian Star'' also took 2nd place in the 2008 ''Writers Federation of New Brunswick Literary Competition'', at which time Boudreau began accumulating a local fan base among younger readers in Eastern Canada.

The year 2010 saw the publishing of two more novels of Boudreau's titled ''KEEP OUT!'', by ''Nimbus Publishing'' and ''Real Mermaids Don't Wear Toe Rings'', by ''Jabberwocky Publishing'' about "an aquaphobic mer-girl trying to balance the drama of two-legged teenage life with her quest to rescue her mermaid mother from really scary mer-dudes".&lt;ref name="website"&gt;{{cite web|last=Boudreau|first=Helene|title=From Publisher's Marketplace:|url=http://www.heleneboudreau.com/|work=Welcome to my Website !|publisher=Helene Boudreau|accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second was to become her best known book, a Crystal Kite Member Choice Finalist, and served as a prequel to ''Real Mermaids Don't Hold Their Breath'' (May, 2012) and ''Real Mermaids Don't Have Two Left Feet'' (February 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boudreau|first=Helene|title=REAL MERMAIDS Cover Reveals !|url=http://www.heleneboudreau.com/?page_id=181|work=Hélène Boudreau|publisher=Helene Boudreau|accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, Boudreau wrote most of her first novel in the ''Real Mermaids series'', Real Mermaids Don't Wear Toe Rings, on her feet. An avid walker, she stated "I find when you're on the move, it helps your thoughts be on the move, too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gordon|first=Andrea|title=Bottoms Up: The Case for Walking while You Work|url=http://0-search.proquest.com.innopac.douglas.bc.ca/news/docview/853059636/132EC138DF5679BE828/7?accountid=10545|accessdate=6 November 2011|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Boudreau married Gordon Clarke, a now retired lieutenant of 1989 and who is currently the 1st Vice President of the [[Royal Military College of Canada|Royal Military Colleges Club of Canada.]] They have two young daughters together, Charlotte and Marcelle.&lt;ref name="Gordon Clarke"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ex-Cadets in the News|url=http://everitas.rmcclub.ca/?p=2525.|work=eVeritas|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the family resides in [[Markham, Ontario]] presently, Boudraeu’s "birthplace [of Petit de Grat] greatly influences the themes of [her] writing for children." Boudreau is known to be "...a compulsive walker, a chicklet wrangler and a lover of cheese and cheap chocolate."&lt;ref name="website" /&gt; Authors that inspire Boudreau include [[Madeleine L’Engle]], [[Louis Sachar]], [[Katherine Paterson]]  and [[Kate DiCamillo]]. She is also an active member of [[The Writers' Union of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Helene|first=Boudreau|title=Hélène Boudreau|url=http://authorsbooking.com/2043/authors/Helene_Boudreau.html|work=Author's Booking Service|publisher=Marsha Skrypuch, Valerie Sherrard|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ignacy Hryniewiecki''' ({{lang-pl|Ignacy Hryniewiecki}}; {{lang-ru|Игнатий Иоахимович Гриневицкий}}, ''Ignaty Ioakhimovich Grinevitsky''; party [[pseudonym]]: ''Kotik'', [[Russian language|Russian]] for "Kitten";&lt;ref name="road"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yarmolinsky|first=Avrahm|title=Road to Revolution: A Century of Russian Radicalism|url=http://www.ditext.com/yarmolinsky/yar14.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1856 – 13 March 1881) was a revolutionary and independence fighter, member of [[People's Will]] and the principal assassin of [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia]].

==Early life==
Hryniewiecki was born in 1856 in Kalinovka, a village in [[Klichev]] District in present-day [[Belarus]]. His family was a noble family (or ''[[szlachta]]'') of a former [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. According to his friend [[Lev Tikhomirov]], Hryniewiecki called himself a [[Litvin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Васіль Герасімчык|title=Грынявіцкі, або проста «Коцік»|url=http://novychas.by/poviaz_casou/hryniavicki_abo_prosta_kocik/|publisher=Газэта «Новы час»|date=2016-03-01|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revolutionary life==
In 1875 Hryniewiecki left for [[Saint Petersburg]], where he enrolled in mathematics at the Polytechnic. Soon he joined the Russian revolutionary ''[[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]]'' (People's Will) movement.

In 1880 Hryniewiecki, [[Andrei Zhelyabov]], [[Sophia Perovskaya]] and others were in charge of revolutionary [[propaganda]] among students and workers. Hryniewiecki was an organizer of the ''Workers' Gazette'' and a [[typesetter]] at a clandestine printing establishment.

==Assassination of Tsar==
In February 1881 Hryniewiecki joined the bomb-throwing unit created to assassinate Tsar Alexander II.&lt;ref name="road"/&gt;

The night before the [[assassination]], Hryniewiecki wrote a letter to posterity, part of which reads:

{{quote|Alexander II must die. He will die, and with him, we, his enemies, his executioners, shall die too [...] How many more sacrifices will our unhappy country ask of its sons before it is liberated? It is my lot to die young, I shall not see our victory, I shall not live one day, one hour in the bright season of our triumph, but I believe that with my death I shall do all that it is my duty to do, and no one in the world can demand more of me [...]&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Yarmolinsky, Road to Revolution: A Century of Russian Radicalism, Princeton 1986, Page 276&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 13 March 1881, (1 March [[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]]&lt;ref name="spartacus"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander II|url=http://www.spartacus-educational.com/RUSalexander2.htm|publisher=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Alexander II was traveling in a [[Carriage#Coach|two-seater carriage]].&lt;ref name="road"/&gt; An armed [[Cossack]] sat next to the coach-driver with Alexander II in the carriage while six other Cossacks followed on horseback.&lt;ref name="spartacus"/&gt; As the carriage approached a street corner near the Catherine Canal, Sophia Perovskaya gave the signal to [[Nikolai Rysakov]] and [[Timofei Mikhailov]] to throw their bombs.&lt;ref name="spartacus"/&gt; The Tsar was unharmed but two were wounded.&lt;ref name="road"/&gt; Alexander II insisted upon leaving the carriage to check on the wounded.&lt;ref name="spartacus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kropotkin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Kropotkin|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|page=432|year=2010 (reproduction of 1899 edition)|ISBN=978-0-486-47316-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point Hryniewiecki, who was leaning against the railing by the canal fence, raised both arms and threw his bomb&lt;ref name="spartacus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kropotkin"/&gt; and the blast tore the Tsar apart.&lt;ref name="road"/&gt; Just before throwing the bomb he was alleged to have shouted "It is too soon to thank God", in response to the emperor saying "thank God I'm untouched" to the anxious inquires of his entourage.&lt;ref&gt;Robert K. Massie, Nicholas and Alexandra, Dell Publishing Company, New York, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby, Hryniewiecki himself lay unconscious from the blast.&lt;ref name="road"/&gt;

Hryniewiecki was taken to the infirmary attached to the [[Winter Palace]]. At 9 PM he regained consciousness, refusing to give any information to the police. He died from his wounds at 10:30 PM.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Yarmolinsky, Road to Revolution: A Century of Russian Radicalism, Princeton 1986, Page 280&lt;/ref&gt;

The assassination had been meant to ignite revolution. Hryniewiecki's fellow-conspirators — [[Nikolai Kibalchich]], [[Sophia Perovskaya]], Nikolai Rysakov, Timofei Mikhailov, [[Andrei Zhelyabov]] — were sentenced to death and were hanged on 3 April 1881.  They were buried in an anonymous common grave.

The [[Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood]] was erected on the site of the assassination.

==Career==
Throughout her 23-year career as an attorney, Kagezi served as a public servant with the [[government of Uganda]]. Straight out of the Law Development Centre in 1992, she secured a position as land officer in the [[Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development (Uganda)|Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development]]. In May 1994,  she was appointed a [[state attorney]] in the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs. She received a promotion in February 2002 to principal state attorney. In August 2007, she was promoted to senior principal state attorney. In January 2015, she was appointed head of the International Crimes Division, at the rank of assistant director of public prosecutions.&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt;

==Death==
On 30 March 2015, at about 7.30 pm local time, Kagezi, who was driving an official Ford double-cabin pick up with government number plates without security, stopped at a road-side stand to buy fresh vegetables in the [[Kampala]] suburb of [[Kiwaatule]]. Her intended final destination was her home in the adjacent neighbourhood called [[Najjera]]. In the pick-up with her were three of her four children, two girls and one boy. One of the girls left the vehicle to pick up the products while the rest of the family stayed in the vehicle. While the girl was walking back to the car, a man approached the truck. He knocked on the driver's window which was closed, appearing to be making an inquiry. When Kagezi opened the window, the man shot her twice in the neck at close range, jumped on the back of a waiting motor cycle (boda boda), and sped off.&lt;ref name="Career"&gt;{{cite web | date=1 April 2015 | url=http://mobile.monitor.co.ug/News/News/Kagezi--the-name-synonymous-with-handling-high-profile-cases/-/2466686/2672352/-/format/xhtml/-/9p8acs/-/index.html | title=Kagezi, The Name Synonymous With Handling High Profile Cases | accessdate=5 April 2015 | first=Anthony | last=Wesaka | newspaper=[[Daily Monitor|Daily Monitor Mobile]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was rushed to [[Mulago National Referral Hospital]], where she was pronounced [[dead on arrival]] at about 8.00 pm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6811">'''Joe Krush''' (born May 18, 1918) and '''Beth Krush''' (March 31, 1918 – February 2, 2009) were an [[American people|American]] husband-and-wife team of illustrators who worked primarily on [[children's books]]. They may be known best for the U.S. editions of all five [[Borrowers]] books by [[Mary Norton (author)|Mary Norton]], published by Harcourt 1953–1961 and 1982, a series inaugurated very early in their careers.

==Life==

Beth &lt;!--name?--&gt; was born March 31, 1918 in [[Washington, DC]]. As a girl she enjoyed visiting the city institutions and special events and drawing at home.&lt;ref name=degrummond/&gt; Joseph Krush was born May 18, 1918 in [[Camden, New Jersey]], and raised there. As a boy he won some prizes for drawings of boats and planes.&lt;ref name=degrummond/&gt;

Beth and Joe both studied at the [[Philadelphia Museum School of Art]], where they met on the first day of class.&lt;ref name=degrummond/&gt; They married during World War II&lt;ref name=degrummond/&gt; and settled in [[Wayne, Pennsylvania]], south of the city, in 1948.&lt;ref name=staino/&gt; They still lived there when Beth died in 2009 (in [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania]]).&lt;ref name=staino/&gt;

Joe has had a life-long love of aviation. He designed, built and flew award winning model aircraft since 1930. Joe has set numerous indoor freeflight records as a member of the Academy of Model Aeronautics and FAI. He helped organize the Valley Forge Signal Seekers (Pennsylvania) one of oldest Radio Control Model Airplane clubs in the USA. Joe is still active in mentoring students involved with the flying events in Science Olympiad as well as his long-standing art classes on illustrating.

The Krushes had one son, the musician [[Jay Krush|Jay Paul Krush]].&lt;ref name=philly/&gt; Joe Krush [[centenarian|turned 100]] in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://6abc.com/community-events/wayne-artist-joe-krush-is-celebrating-his-100th-birthday/3492461/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Joe worked as a graphic designer for O.S.S. during the war.&lt;ref name=degrummond/&gt; He was a [[courtroom sketch]] artist at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] 1945–1946. Beth taught illustration and drawing at [[Moore College of Art]] in Philadelphia, for at least 15 years.&lt;ref name=UMN-beth/&gt;&lt;!-- one source says 22 yrs; death notice says professor emeritus --&gt;

Both of the Krushes illustrated books that [[Harcourt, Brace]] published in 1947.&lt;!--earliest i have found, not known to be their debuts--&gt; Joe did ''[[Windwagon Smith]] and Other Yarns'', a collection of short stories by [[Wilbur Schramm]].&lt;ref name=isfdb-joe/&gt; Beth did ''Mr. Doodle'' by Sally Scott.&lt;ref name=LCC-doodle/&gt; Sarah Scott Fisher, the daughter of [[Dorothy Canfield Fisher]],{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} was a prolific writer of children's picture books whom Harcourt teamed with multiple illustrators. The Library of Congress online catalog lists 16 Sally Scott and Beth Krush collaborations published from 1947 to 1963.

The Krushes planned to work separately but they helped each other meet deadlines and that collaboration was noticed and approved by editors.&lt;ref name=degrummond/&gt;

Beside ''[[The Borrowers]]'' and its sequels, some famous books illustrated jointly by the Krushes were ''[[Miracles on Maple Hill]]'' (1956) by [[Virginia Sorensen]] (who won the [[Newbery Medal]] as its writer); ''[[Gone-Away Lake]]'' and its sequel, by [[Elizabeth Enright]] (1957, 1961); and ''All-of-a-Kind Family Downtown'' by [[Sydney Taylor]] (1972).

Before collaborating with his wife, Joe Krush illustrated the dustjacket and the interior of ''Huon of the Horn'', published by Harcourt in 1951, an adaptation of ''[[Huon de Bordeaux]]'' that was [[Andre Norton]]'s first fantasy novel. A few years later he did the same for ''[[The Ponder Heart]]'' by [[Eudora Welty]], published in 1953/1954.

Beside collaborating with her husband, Beth Krush illustrated ''[[The Shoe Bird]]'' (1964), the only children's book by Eudora Welty.

There are two collections of Krush papers at the University of Minnesota and one item at the University of Southern Mississippi. All of the materials date from 1964 and earlier.&lt;ref name=degrummond/&gt;&lt;ref name=UMN-beth/&gt;&lt;ref name=UMN/&gt;

The "Boys" category is mentored by Nick Grimshaw. Contestants in this category are male soloists aged between 16 and 25. The six candidates at judges' houses were: Ché Chesterman, Ben Clark, Josh Daniels, Simon Lynch, Seann Miley Moore, and Mason Noise. Grimshaw chose:

===Ché Chesterman===
'''Ché George Chesterman, Jr.''' (born 18 August 1996)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=bmd%2fb%2f1996%2f9%2f123332401|title=England &amp; Wales births 1837-2006 Transcription for Che George Chesterman, Hackney, 1996|accessdate=8 December 2015|via=[[Find My Past]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a singer-songwriter from [[Basildon]], Essex. Prior to auditioning for ''The X Factor'', he used to work stacking shelves at a [[Tesco]] in [[Langdon Hills|Langdon]], Essex, but quit to pursue his singing career.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Chesterman's father, Ché Sr., auditioned for [[The X Factor (UK series 3)|series 3]] of ''The X Factor'' in 2006 and made it through to boot camp.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Chesterman studied music at college, which is where he realised his passion for performing.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} He was the lead singer of a band called Jinx, before they split and he decided to audition for the show.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

With the eliminations of Seann Miley Moore in week two and Mason Noise in week four, Chesterman became Grimshaw's last remaining act in the competition. Chesterman was in the bottom two in week four alongside Anton Stephans, but was saved after only Cowell voted to send him home. He was in the bottom two again in week six alongside Lauren Murray and was sent through to the final after the result went to deadlock. He finished in third place in the competition. Chesterman took part in The X Factor Live Tour 2016.

===Seann Miley Moore===
'''Seann Miley Moore''' (born 30 October 1990) is originally from Sydney. He brought a one way ticket and moved to London in order to take part in the competition. When he was younger, Moore went to a British American International school in Asia.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} However, his family moved and he grew up in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sugarscape.com/film-tv/news/a1083520/x-factor-sean-miley-moore-fact-file/|title=X Factor 2015: Everything you need to know about Seann Miley Moore|last=Baxter-Wright|first=Dusty|date=26 October 2015|publisher=[[sugarscape.com]]|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore originally wanted to be a tennis player and realised his singing dream after performing his father's favourite song, "[[Tears in Heaven]]" at a school acoustic night.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}He auditioned for many musicals and got main parts in several of them.

Seann performed "[[The Show Must Go On]]" at his audition.  Seann was in the bottom three in week two. He performed (" A song for you") in the sing-off against Mason Noise, and despite both Cowell and Fernadez-Versini praising his performance, the result went to deadlock because Ora voted against him and Grimshaw did not want to decide since he mentored both acts. Moore was revealed as the act with the fewest votes and was eliminated. He came in tenth place. Although Moore was not in the top seven, he was given a place on The X Factor Live Tour 2016.

Before "The X Factor" he released a few songs and videos that didn't quite make 100 views on YouTube.

Noise was a controversial act because during the six-seat challenge, after performing for his mentor [[Nick Grimshaw|Grimshaw]], Noise complained that his audition was only broadcast for 47 seconds while other contestants were featured for up to 10 minutes. [[Simon Cowell]] responded by saying "You should feel lucky to be on this show. Why don't you shut up?" and called Noise an "arsehole". Noise was booed by the crowd before dropping the microphone and walking off the stage. Noise later told the Daily Mirror: "[Simon] lost control and it was uncalled for. Especially as all I was doing was saying an opinion. I think that no one has ever questioned him before and no one has questioned the format of the show. Something needs to change on that show. Listen to the kids, at the end of the day I have a lot of support on Twitter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s103/the-x-factor/news/a667013/x-factor-contestant-mason-noise-reacts-to-being-called-an-arsehole-by-simon-cowell-he-lost-control.html|title=X Factor contestant Mason Noise reacts to being called "an arsehole" by Simon Cowell: "He lost control"|last=Harp|first=Justin|date=4 September 2015|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When contestant Tom Bleasby had withdrawn from the show for personal reasons, there was a spare place at judges' houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/xfactor/news/tom-bleasby-withdraws-from-the-x-factor|title=Tom Bleasby withdraws from The X Factor|last=ITV|first=ITV|date=12 October 2015|work=ITV|publisher=ITV|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 October, Grimshaw announced that Noise would replace Bleasby at judges' houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s103/the-x-factor/news/a673796/x-factor-nick-grimshaw-confirms-mason-noise-will-replace-tom-bleasby.html|title=X Factor: Nick Grimshaw confirms Mason Noise will replace Tom Bleasby|last=Warner|first=Sam|date=15 October 2015|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a negative response about this decision from the media due to Noise's behaviour at the six-chair challenge,{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} although the remaining five candidates defended Noise, stating that his attitude had significantly improved since the six-chair challenge.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

At judges' houses, Grimshaw put Noise through to the live shows. This decision was met with a mixture of cheers and boos from the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Law|first1=Nina|title=X Factor 2015: the final 12 revealed and five things we learned|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/x-factor/11941456/what-time-is-x-factor-on-tonight.html|accessdate=8 November 2015|work=telegraph|agency=telegraph|publisher=TelegraphEnts|date=25 October 2015|ref=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/x-factor/11941456/what-time-is-x-factor-on-tonight.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noise was in the bottom three in week two, having to perform on the sing-off against Seann Miley Moore. Initially, Cowell and Fernandez-Versini voted to send him home because of his sing-off performance. However, Ora claimed that she saw something in him and voted against Moore. Their mentor, Grimshaw, did not want to decide between the two and the result went to deadlock, which guaranteed Noise another week. Noise was eliminated in week 4 after receiving the fewest votes on Saturday. He finished in seventh place. Noise took part in the 2016 X Factor Live Tour.

He has released the singles "Blow the doors off", "Take your seat", "Boyfriend", "Heat", "Loco", "She drives me crazy" and "Stranger" (&amp; My Boyz Beatz)

She returned for this series and was eliminated during judges houses by judge Rita Ora but was brought back as a wildcard act as all four judges felt she should have got through.

Michael was in the bottom three in week three. She performed in the sing-off against Anton Stephans, receiving Cowell's and Grimshaw's votes to eliminate her. The result went to deadlock and she was sent home as the act with the fewest votes. Michael finished in seventh place, missing out on a place in The X Factor Live Tour 2016.  Since leaving the show, Michael has released "Pretty Little Sister" and "My Angel" which she sang at her 2014 audition and judges houses in 2015. In 2018, she released her third single "Wish you love", followed by the songs "Diamond in the rough", "Soldier" and "Long gone".

===Kiera Weathers===

Weathers was in the bottom three on week one, facing the sing-off with Alien Uncovered. Weathers was saved after her mentor [[Rita Ora]], [[Nick Grimshaw]] and [[Simon Cowell]] voted to send Alien Uncovered home and [[Cheryl Fernandez-Versini]] voted to send Weathers home. Results polls released post-series revealed that Weathers had received the fewest votes in week one meaning if Cowell sent the result to deadlock, Alien Uncovered would have been saved. She was in the bottom three once again on week two, but this time received the fewest votes and was automatically eliminated, coming in eleventh place.

Kiera Weathers released her debut single 'You Gotta Be' on 9 December 2016 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tellymix.co.uk/reality-tv/the-x-factor/293498-x-factors-kiera-weathers-launches-brilliant-first-single-gotta.html|title=X Factor's Kiera Weathers launches brilliant first single 'You Gotta Be'}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was re-released on 31 March 2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hypefreshmag.com/music/kiera-weathers-you-gotta-be|title=KIERA WEATHERS - "YOU GOTTA BE" - World premiering an exclusive follow-up visual to her hit single, set to turn thousands of heads.}}&lt;/ref&gt; after she signed a record deal with Warner Music UK:

"She originally released this track in late December last year, I heard it one Saturday night and immediately knew I wanted to sign it, so I tweeted Kiera to ask if we could exchange emails. Within the course of a few hours on a Saturday evening, between Kiera and her manager, we had agreed on a deal." - Kieron Donoghue, Warner Music &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-magazine.co.uk/features/power-playlists-streaming-success-2017|title=PLAYLIST POWER: STREAMING SUCCESS IN 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2017, she released the singles "Hurt so good" (feat. Marc) and "Talk to me".

He was in the bottom three on week three and had to perform in the sing-off against Monica Michael, receiving Ora's and Fernandez-Versini's votes to be eliminated. The result was deadlocked and he was spared since he had the most votes. The following week, he was in the bottom two alongside Ché Chesterman and was eliminated by the judges, receiving only Cowell's vote to save him and becoming the last of his acts to leave the competition. He finished in sixth place. He took part in The X Factor Live Tour 2016.

==Groups==
The 'Groups' category is mentored by Cheryl Fernandez-Versini. Contestants in this category are either duos or vocal harmony groups, all aged sixteen and over. The six candidates at judges' houses were: 4th Impact, Alien Uncovered, BEKLN Mile, Melody Stone, New King Order, and Reggie n Bollie. Fernandez-Versini chose:

===4th Impact===
{{main|4th Impact}}
'''4th Impact''' (formerly known as '''The Cercado Sisters''', '''The Cercados''', '''The''' '''Gollayan Sisters''', '''MICA,''' and '''4th Power''') are a girl group from the Philippines consisting of Almira, Irene, Mylene, and Celina Cercado&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/publicaffairs/kapusomojessicasoho/546951/in-photos-4th-impact-s-journey-to-stardom/story/|title=IN PHOTOS: 4th Impact’s journey to stardom|work=GMA News Online|access-date=2017-08-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; who have been singing and dancing together since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/115882-4th-impact-x-factor-uk-concert-tour-history|title=4th Impact: More about the PH girl group, their plans after 'X Factor UK'|work=Rappler|access-date=2017-08-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before ''The X Factor'', they had previously competed in several Philippine and international talent competitions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They are originally from [[Santiago (Philippine city)|Santiago City]] in the Philippines, but now live in [[Metro Manila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/178467/ph-group-in-x-factor-uk-poverty-is-no-hindrance|title=PH group in ‘X Factor UK’: Poverty is no hindrance|last=Pulumbarit|first=Oliver M.|access-date=2017-08-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first four weeks of the X Factor live shows, 4th Impact sailed through the competition, earning nothing but positive comments from the four judges for their performances.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://spinditty.com/artists-bands/4th-Impact-Reminiscing-Their-X-Factor-UK-Journey|title=4th Impact: Reminiscing Their X-Factor UK Journey|work=Spinditty|access-date=2017-07-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fifth week of the live shows, however, the group found themselves in the bottom two for the first time in the competition. Being one of the two acts who received the fewest public votes, they had to perform against fellow contestant [[Lauren Murray]] for a place in the competition. The judges' decision on the face-off, however, were split, so the public vote was consulted and 4th Impact was eliminated, finishing in fifth place, having received the fewest votes that week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/4th-impact-eliminated-x-factor-6924557|title=4th Impact eliminated from X Factor|last=Walker|first=Danny|date=2015-11-29|work=mirror|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alien Uncovered===
'''Alien Uncovered''' (formerly '''Alien''') are a five-piece girl group consisting of Madison, Natalie, Shae, Temple,{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} and Yasmin "Yaz" Crotch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thecomet.net/news/after_wowing_judges_on_the_x_factor_two_stevenage_performers_cruise_through_to_boot_camp_1_4227752|title=After wowing judges on the X Factor two Stevenage performers cruise through to boot camp|last=Pritchard|first=Oliver|date=10 September 2015|work=The Comet|publisher=Archant Community Media|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During their time on the show, they also had a sixth member, Frank. The band came up with their name after people kept staring at them on a train because of the way they looked, stating: "We felt like aliens... so we thought it would be a good name for the band."{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} They have been together for over a year and are all former dancers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Alien Uncovered were eliminated in week one after ending up in the sing-off with Kiera Weathers, receiving [[Rita Ora]]'s, [[Nick Grimshaw]]'s and [[Simon Cowell]]'s votes to be sent home but [[Cheryl Fernandez-Versini]] (their mentor) voted to save them. Result polls released after the end of the series revealed that if Cowell sent the vote to deadlock, Alien Uncovered would've been saved. They finished in 12th place. A few days before their group performance with the other contestants at the final, Frank abruptly left the band, later claiming she was being forced to by the other members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tellymix.co.uk/reality-tv/the-x-factor/243430-x-factors-alien-uncovered-lose-a-member-ahead-of-the-final.html|title=X Factor's Alien Uncovered lose a member and it turns BITCHY &amp;#124; The X Factor 2017 &amp;#124; TellyMix|last=Darvill|first=Josh|date=12 December 2015|accessdate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the girl group released their debut single "[[Handle It]]".

Either at about age two&lt;ref name=elliot15 /&gt; or in his early teens,&lt;ref name=dennis3 /&gt; Fine's left leg became crippled by polio.&lt;ref name=dennis3 /&gt; Developing a talent for art, and influenced by such commercial illustrators and other artists as [[Dean Cornwell]], [[Heinrich Kley]], and [[J. C. Leyendecker|J.C. Leyendecker]],&lt;ref name=dennis3 /&gt; Fine went on to study at Manhattan's [[Grand Central Art School]] and [[Brooklyn]]'s [[Pratt Institute]].&lt;ref name=dennis3 /&gt; In 1938, Fine, like many other comics artists of the time, found work at [[Eisner &amp; Iger]], a prominent "packager" that supplied complete comic books to [[publishers]] testing the waters of the emerging [[mass media|medium]].  Fine's first published comics art was the strip "Wilton of the West" in [[Fiction House]]'s ''[[Jumbo Comics]]'' #4 (Dec. 1938), signed with the house [[pen name]] '''Fred Sande'''&lt;ref name=berk&gt;{{cite web|last=Berk |first=John |url=http://www.comicartville.com/loufine.htm |title=Lou Fine |publisher=Comicartville Library |date=2004 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5scSgYFAB?url=http://www.comicartville.com/loufine.htm |archivedate=September 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (which strip originator [[Jack Kirby]] had used in previous issues). Other early [[pseudonyms]] Fine employed (reflecting the fledgling Eisner &amp; Iger's attempts to convince publishers they had a large stable of artists) were '''Curt Davis''' and '''Basil Berold'''. Eisner would later say, "I had respect for his towering kind of draftsmanship. He was the epitome of the honest draftsman. No fakery, no razzle-dazzle — very direct, very honest in his approach".&lt;ref name=berk /&gt;

Fine went on to do exquisite and acclaimed work for [[Fox Feature Syndicate]], where he supplied the cover of 1939's ''[[Blue Beetle]]'' #1 and drew such features as "[[Flame (comics)|The Flame]]" in ''Wonderworld Comics'' and the later eponymous series. For publisher [[Everett M. "Busy" Arnold]]'s [[Quality Comics]], he drew features including "[[Black Condor|The Black Condor]]" (initially under the pseudonym '''Kenneth Lewis''') in ''Crack Comics''; "[[Doll Man]]" (under the pseudonym '''William Erwin Maxwell''') in ''Feature Comics''; "[[Ray (comics)|The Ray]]" (initially under the jokey pseudonym '''E. Lectron''') in ''Smash Comics''; "[[Uncle Sam (comics)|Uncle Sam]]" (for which Eisner &amp; Iger co-founder [[Will Eisner]] received credit) in ''National Comics''; and "Stormy Foster" in ''Hit Comics''. Fine became particularly prominent as a cover artist.

Fine, along with ''[[Plastic Man]]'' creator [[Jack Cole (artist)|Jack Cole]], was a ghost-artist on Will Eisner's celebrated Sunday-supplement [[newspaper]] comic book ''[[The Spirit]]'' during Eisner's [[World War II]] [[Conscription|military service]], Fine inking over Cole's pencil work. Some of these were reprinted in Quality's ''Police Comics'' and ''The Spirit'' comic book, where Fine's work continued to appear through 1949, five years after Fine had left comics.

[[Joe Simon]], an artist and the first editor of [[Marvel Comics]], called Fine his "favorite artist.... He was also Jack Kirby's favorite artist. I know that Jack was a fan of and greatly influenced by Fine’s work".&lt;ref name=berk /&gt;

===Advertising and comic strips===
Leaving comic books in 1944, Fine segued into [[newspapers]] by drawing Sunday [[advertising]] comics. Starting out at [[Johnstone and Cushing]],&lt;ref&gt;Heintjes, Tom. "Funny Business: The Rise and Fall of Johnstone and Cushing". Hogan's Alley (online magazine), via cartoonician.com.&lt;/ref&gt; he formed his own company with Don Komisarov,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/f/fine.htm&lt;/ref&gt; whom he had met doing ''The Throp Family'' for ''[[Liberty Magazine]]'' in 1946. He had many accounts, but his two most enduring were the series  he did for Philip Morris and the Sam Spade strip for Wildroot haircream.&lt;ref&gt;samples of both on the Fabulous Fifties (http://www.allthingger.blogspot.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

He later drew the [[comic strips]] ''Taylor Woe'' (1949), ''Adam Ames'' (1959) and ''Peter Scratch'' (1965). In a single return to comic books, he contributed to a [[toy]] company's custom one-shot, ''[[Wham-O]] Giant Comics'' (1967), illustrating a two-page story, "The Man From Aeons", starring a [[prehistoric]] man who, though named "Tor", was not the [[Tor (comic book)|same-name caveman character]] created in the 1950s by [[Joe Kubert]].

Fine also worked on the strip ''Space Conquerors'' in the magazine ''[[Boys' Life]]'' from the late 1960s until his death. He and writer [[Gill Fox]], whom he had met during his time with Eisner &amp; Iger and remained in contact with, were developing new comic strips when Fine was found dead of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the threshold of his studio.&lt;ref name="gillfox"&gt;Interview with Gill Fox, ''Will Eisner's Shop Talk'' (Dark Horse, Milwaukie, Oregon, 2001) {{ISBN|1-56971-536-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
By the late 1960s, Fine lived in affluent [[Lido Beach, New York]], on [[Long Island]], owning two houses there. Friend and collaborator Gill Fox described them as, "One for his wife and one for himself. He lived alone [by then]".&lt;ref name="gillfox" /&gt;

==Critical assessment==
'''Atlas Comics''' (retailer), "The Top 100 Artists of American Comic Books": #10 - Lou Fine: "By God, Lou Fine could draw. One of comics' first illustrative stars, he influenced and astounded such later greats as [[Alex Toth]], [[Jim Steranko]], and [[Gil Kane]]. His covers alone during the ' 40s stand as some of the best-designed and most exciting work ever produced for any comic book publisher".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acomics.com/best10.htm |title=Atlas Comics presents The Top 100 Artists of American Comic Books |publisher=Atlas Comics (retailer) |location=Chicago |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5syERAIE4?url=http://www.acomics.com/best10.htm |archivedate=September 24, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
Fine's ''Spirit'' work has been reprinted in [[DC Comics]]' hardcover collections ''The Spirit Archives'' vols. 5 to 9 (2001–2003), spanning July 1942 to December 1944.

'''Maria Dermoût''' (15 June 1888 &amp;ndash; 27 June 1962), was an [[Indo people|Indo-European]] novelist, considered one of the greats of [[Dutch literature]] and as such an important proponent of [[Dutch Indies literature]]. In December 1958 [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] praised the translation of Maria Dermoût's ''[[The Ten Thousand Things]]'', and named it one of the best books of the year.

Whitney Balliett of ''The New Yorker'' wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;''"Mrs. Dermout, in the manner of Thoreau and the early Hemingway, is an extraordinary sensualist. [...] in passages of a startling, unadorned, three-dimensional clarity; often one can almost touch what she describes."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/books/imprints/classics/the-ten-thousand-things/  New York Review Books website.] Retrieved 26 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Biography==
Dermoût was a Dutch novelist born in [[Pati Regency|Pati]], [[Central Java|Java]], [[Dutch East Indies]], and educated in the Netherlands, who wrote in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. After completing her education she returned to [[Java (island)|Java]], where she married and travelled extensively across Java and the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]] with her husband. In 1933 her husband was pensioned, and the couple returned to the Netherlands. Maria Dermoût was widowed in 1952.

Dermoût died in [[The Hague]] in 1962. She is the subject of the [[biography]] ''Geheim Indië. Het leven van Maria Dermoût 1888-1962'' ("The Secret East Indies. The Life of Maria Dermoût 1888-1962") in 2000 by the [[Indo people|Indo-European]] (Dutch-Indonesian) author [[Kester Freriks]].

==Body of work==
Dermoût turned to writing early in life, but remained largely unpublished until she was 63. She wrote two novels, both of which were not published until she was in her sixties: ''[[The Ten Thousand Things]]'' (''De tienduizend dingen'', 1955) and ''Days Before Yesterday'' — also published as ''Just Yesterday'' (''Nog pas gisteren'', 1951).&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica "Her first two novels, Nog pas gisteren (1951; Yesterday) and De tienduizend dingen (1955; The Ten Thousand Things), are fictionalized accounts of her youth. Although written in an economic style, the two novels are rich in details of island life as experienced by both the colonials and the native people"&lt;/ref&gt; There are English translations of her novels by [[Hans Koning]]. Some of her [[Short story|short stories]] were published in translation in magazines such as ''[[Vogue magazine|Vogue]]'' during the 1960s. In Dutch, five short-story collections by her were also published.

She is viewed as one of the giants among [[Dutch Indies literature|Dutch-Indies literary]] writers, and ''The Ten Thousand Things'' in particular is widely regarded as an idiosyncratic masterpiece. The book has been translated into thirteen languages. As Hans Koning puts it in his Introduction to the [[New York Review Books]] edition of the novel:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Dermoût was sui generis, a case all her own. She did not write about her Indies as a Dutch woman, or as a Javanese or an [[Ambon Island|Ambonese]]. Hers was a near-compassionate disdain for the dividing lines, the hatreds and the fears ... She ''painted'' landscapes, [[still life]]s and people in a world of myth and mystery."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although not conventionally [[Autobiography|autobiographical]], both of her novels draw from Dermoût's own life. In particular, like the central character in ''The Ten Thousand Things'', Dermoût lost her son in violent circumstances (he died in a Japanese [[prisoner-of-war camp]]). The Javanese childhood experiences and reminiscences described in ''Days Before Yesterday'' are based on, but do not mirror, her own childhood in the [[tropics]].
[[File:Dermout5.JPG|thumb|Grave headstone]]

Author [[Oek de Jong]] appropriately wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Still, Maria Dermoût an author for the happy few. Is she a writer's writer? Certainly not. She is a storyteller par excellence. Her stories are subtle, but they are also accessible. Nonetheless she remains an author for the happy few, equal to the greats of Dutch prose, but much less known than they are. There are many reasons for her modest literary reputation: her own modesty, the small body of her work, the brevity of her literary career. But it is mainly her work itself that is the cause. It possesses something that wards off hordes of readers, yet still manages to attract a handful, who then embrace it and spread the word of its exquisite nature. The shell seekers among the readers, the slow walkers, those who stop and turn and bend over to pick up that one beautiful shell - they recognize her extraordinary work."''&lt;ref&gt;Jong, Oek de. ''Oek de Jong leest Maria Dermoût.'' (Amsterdam, 2005) P.7-8 [http://www.oekdejong.nl/#/in-translation/pfitem.php]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''María Isabella Cordero Martínez''' (c. 1987 – 16 April 2010) was a Mexican television anchorwoman for a local [[Televisa]] channel in [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], Mexico, and the spokeswoman and director of public relations for [[CANACO]], Chihuahua's local Chamber of Commerce.

She was murdered by unidentified gunmen outside a restaurant in the capital city of Chihuahua on 16 April 2010. At the crime scene, the Mexican authorities discovered several shell casings from [[assault rifle]]s, the habitual weapon of the Mexican organized crime groups. The motive of the killing, however, remains unknown.

== Early life and career ==
As a youth, Cordero completed her primary school education from Escuela Primaria Enrique Rebsamen, and then went on to middle school at the State Junior High Number 15. Upon graduation, she attended high school at an institution called III del Colegio de Bachilleres.&lt;ref name=elheraldo /&gt;

Before enrolling at the [[Autonomous University of Chihuahua|University of Chihuahua]] to study Accounting and Business administration, Cordero's mother suggested that she participate in a casting for a local television program hosted by [[Televisa]].&lt;ref name=elheraldo /&gt; To her surprise, Cordero was selected from a pool of contestants to work as the anchorwoman for the television program. During her three-year career on Televisa, her show – although generally directed at housewives – attracted both men and women. After working for more than three years at Televisa, Cordero resigned to work as the director of [[public relations]] at the [[CANACO]], Chihuahua city's Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref name=laht&gt;{{cite news |title=Former Televisa Reporter Killed in Mexico |url=http://www.laht.com/article.asp?CategoryId=14091&amp;ArticleId=355595 |accessdate=18 December 2012 |newspaper=[[Latin American Herald Tribune]] |date=April 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CzaMW8MO?url=http://www.laht.com/article.asp?CategoryId=14091&amp;ArticleId=355595 |archivedate=18 December 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cordero also opened a small shirt printing business where she sold T-shirts and blouses with peace messages in response to the drug violence in her home state.&lt;ref name=elheraldo /&gt;&lt;ref name=LaPrensa&gt;{{cite news |title=Sicarios ejecutan a ex conductora de televisión en Chihuahua |url=http://www.oem.com.mx/laprensa/notas/n1600161.htm |accessdate=18 December 2012 |newspaper=[[Organización Editorial Mexicana|La Prensa]] |date=17 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Czam2lu9?url=http://www.oem.com.mx/laprensa/notas/n1600161.htm |archivedate=18 December 2012 |deadurl=no |location=[[Mexico City]] |language=Spanish |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cordero was about to graduate from the University of Chihuahua in June 2010 and was pursuing her graduate studies in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=elheraldo&gt;{{cite news |title=Joven ejecutada fue conductora de televisión |url=http://www.oem.com.mx/elheraldodechihuahua/notas/n1600638.htm |accessdate=18 December 2012 |newspaper=[[Organización Editorial Mexicana|El Heraldo de Chihuahua]] |date=18 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CzVmgn5J?url=http://www.oem.com.mx/elheraldodechihuahua/notas/n1600638.htm |archivedate=18 December 2012 |deadurl=no |language=Spanish |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 April 2010, Cordero and her friend María Catalina Flores Aguayo (age 22) went out for dinner at a local restaurant in [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua]] when an armed commando opened fire at them from a moving vehicle at around 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., killing them instantly.&lt;ref name=LaPrensa /&gt; Their bodies were found inside a parked white [[Renault Mégane]] near the corner of Bahía de San Quintín and Libertadores streets in the northern part of the capital city.&lt;ref name=nd&gt;{{cite news |title=Acribillan a funcionaria de la CANACO en Chihuahua |url=http://www.novedadesdetabasco.com.mx/noticia/58384/acribillan-a-funcionaria-de-la-canaco-en-chihuahua/ |accessdate=18 December 2012 |newspaper=Novedades de Tabasco |date=17 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CzgsxDaf?url=http://www.novedadesdetabasco.com.mx/noticia/58384/acribillan-a-funcionaria-de-la-canaco-en-chihuahua/ |archivedate=18 December 2012 |deadurl=no |language=Spanish |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context ==
With the death of Cordero, the death toll of [[List of journalists killed in Mexico|journalists killed in Mexico]] in 2010 reached six. If the journalists killed since the year 2000 are counted, the number of journalists killed would be of more than 60, according to a report issued by [[Reporters Without Borders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Una ex conductora de televisión es asesinada en Chihuahua |url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2010/04/18/una-ex-conductora-de-television-es-asesinada-en-chihuahua |accessdate=18 December 2012 |newspaper=CNNMéxico |date=18 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CzhAQg7J?url=http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2010/04/18/una-ex-conductora-de-television-es-asesinada-en-chihuahua |archivedate=18 December 2012 |deadurl=no |language=Spanish |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Asesinan a ex conductora de Televisa en Chihuahua |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/673617.html |accessdate=18 December 2012 |newspaper=[[El Universal (Mexico City)]] |date=16 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CzhlTuJP?url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/673617.html |archivedate=18 December 2012 |deadurl=no |language=Spanish |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cordero was killed in the state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] in 2010, reported to be "the most violent state in Mexico" at that time.&lt;ref name="laht" /&gt; Almost one-third of all murders in the general population committed by the [[drug cartels]] during the [[Mexican Drug War]] (between 2006 and 2010) happened in the state of Chihuahua.&lt;ref name="laht" /&gt; Chihuahua, and particularly the border city of [[Ciudad Juárez]], was the epicenter of Mexico's drug war as the battle between the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] and [[Juárez Cartel]] left thousands of dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stone |first=Hannah |title=Border State Chihuahua No Longer Leads Mexico Drug Killings |url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/chihuahua-mexico-drug-killings |accessdate=18 December 2012 |newspaper=[[InSight Crime]] |date=1 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CzhGzmaD?url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/chihuahua-mexico-drug-killings |archivedate=18 December 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michel Petrucciani''' ({{IPA-fr|miʃɛl petʁutʃani}}; {{IPA-it|petrutˈtʃaːni|lang}}; 28 December 1962 – 6 January 1999) was a French [[jazz]] pianist. From birth he had [[osteogenesis imperfecta]], a genetic disease that causes brittle bones and, in his case, short stature. He became one of the most accomplished jazz pianists of his generation despite having arms that caused him pain.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Michel Petrucciani came from an Italo-French family (his grandfather was from [[Naples]])&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130929143408/http://www.reatechitalia.it/blog/michel-petrucciani/] &lt;/ref&gt; with a musical background. His father Tony played guitar, his brother Louis played bass, and his brother Philippe also plays the guitar. Michel was born with [[osteogenesis imperfecta]], which is a genetic disease that causes brittle bones and, in his case, short stature. It is also often linked to pulmonary ailments. The disease caused his bones to fracture over 100 times before he reached adolescence and kept him in pain throughout his entire life. "I have pain all the time. I'm used to having hurt arms," he said.&lt;ref name=keys&gt;[[David Hajdu|Hajdu, David]]. [http://www.tnr.com/article/keys-the-kingdom "Keys To the Kingdom."] [[The New Republic]], March 17, 2009. Retrieved July 24, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In Michel's early career, his father and brother occasionally carried him because he could not walk far on his own unaided. In certain respects he considered his disability an advantage, as he got rid of distractions like sports that other boys tended to become involved in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/1999/01/12/michel.t.php | newspaper = International Herald Tribune | type = obituary | publisher = The New York Times | date = 12 January 1999 | title = Michel}}&lt;/ref&gt; And he hints that his disability was helpful in other parts of his life. He said: "Sometimes I think someone upstairs saved me from being ordinary."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

At an early age, Michel saw [[Duke Ellington]] on television and wished to become a pianist like him. When Michel was four, his father bought him a toy piano of his own, but Michel smashed the piano with a toy hammer. "When I was young, I thought the keyboard looked like teeth," he said. "It was as though it was laughing at me. You had to be strong enough to make the piano feel little. That took a lot of work."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = The Independent | place = UK | title = Michel Petrucciani | type = obituary | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-michel-petrucciani-1045629.html | first=Steve | last=Voce | date=8 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after this, Michel's father bought him a real piano.

From the beginning, Petrucciani had always been musical, reportedly humming [[Wes Montgomery]] solos by the time he learned to speak. He began learning classical piano at the age of four, and was making music with his family by the age of nine.&lt;ref name=newgrove&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Kernfeld | first1 = Barry Dean | first2 = Stanley | last2 = Sadie | title = The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz | place = London | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; The musician that would prove most influential to Petrucciani was [[Bill Evans]], whom he began listening to at around the age of ten. Petrucciani's layered harmonies, lyrical style, and articulation of melody have always been linked most strongly to this early exposure to Evans.&lt;ref name=giants&gt;{{Citation | last = Doerschuk | first = Robert 'Bob' | title = 88: The Giants of Jazz Piano | place = San Francisco | publisher = Backbeat | year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music career in Paris===
Petrucciani gave his first professional concert at the age of 13. At this point of his life, he was still quite fragile and had to be carried to and from the piano. His hands were average in length, but his size meant that he required aids to reach the piano's pedals.

Petrucciani felt he needed to travel to Paris to begin his musical career, but he found it difficult to leave home. His father was protective, constantly concerned for his son's well-being and reluctant to put him in any danger. Petrucciani's drummer [[Aldo Romano]] said of Michel's father: "[He] was an idiot. He didn't trust anybody. He wanted to keep Petrucciani as a partner, to play music with. He was very jealous. So I had to fight to take him to Paris, because his father didn't want me to, because he wanted to keep him, like you would cage a monster."&lt;ref name=keys /&gt;

Petrucciani made his first trip to Paris at the age of fifteen. There he played with [[Kenny Clarke]] in 1977 and [[Clark Terry]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=newgrove /&gt; His breakthrough performance occurred at the Cliousclat jazz festival. Terry was missing a pianist, and when Petrucciani was carried onto the stage, he thought it was a joke; Petrucciani was not more than three feet tall. But he astounded Terry and the rest of the festival with his prodigious talent and virtuosity.&lt;ref name = "independent.co.uk"/&gt; Terry said, "When I heard him play – oh, man! He was a dwarf, but he played like a giant. I said, 'listen, little guy – don't run away. I'll be back for you.'"&lt;ref name=keys /&gt;

Petrucciani's trip to Paris garnered mixed experiences but was undoubtedly musically and personally transforming. He reports, "It was mostly to do with drugs and weird women, but I was lucky and got out safe."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; His attitude during his time in France was largely immature and insecure, despite his considerable talent. He wore a yachtsman's cap and frequently acted pushy and tough, referring to people as 'baby'.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; "He acted tough and pushy, and his playing was tough and pushy. He knew how to say 'motherfucker' in French," said [[Michael Zwerin]], who met Petrucciani when the pianist was fifteen. Petrucciani played in a trio with Kenny Clarke during his time in Paris and rose to stardom.&lt;ref name=keys /&gt;

After his stint in Paris, Petrucciani briefly returned to home before beginning his professional life. Living with his drummer, Romano, he was free of the protective presence of his father and began enjoying an independent lifestyle. Petrucciani began recording with Owl Records and struck up a friendship with the recording company's owner, Jean-Jacques Pussiau. Pussiau recalls that Petrucciani always seemed to be in a hurry to record, saying, "I don't want to lose time." Eventually however Petrucciani desired independence from Romano, too. Romano remembers: "He didn't feel free with me. So he had to kill his second father somehow to move on. He needed to escape. He needed to go very far, as far as he could go, and that was California."&lt;ref name=keys /&gt;

Petrucciani travelled to the U.S. after his trip to Paris, but it is not known whether he stopped in New York first. "Michel was really into bullshitting...he would lie to your face," said French journalist Thierry Peremarti. This calls into question his strange account of his time in Manhattan. He claimed to have scammed his way into the city on bad checks and hid out in Brooklyn with the help of Sicilian family connections. He also claimed to have played piano in a midtown brothel.&lt;ref name=keys /&gt;

===With Charles Lloyd in New York===
What is known for certain is that he ended up in California in 1982, where he visited retired saxophonist [[Charles Lloyd (jazz musician)|Charles Lloyd]]. Lloyd had stopped playing when people began to view his sidemen as more fashionable than he himself was.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; After hearing Petrucciani play, Lloyd was so inspired that he agreed to tour with him.&lt;ref name=documentary /&gt; Lloyd said to him, "I was here planning to not play again. You triggered me. I heard this beauty in you and I said, 'well I have to take you 'round the world cause there's something so beautiful, it was like providence calling."&lt;ref name=documentary&gt;[https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1172784483135614308 documentary] at [[Google Videos]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604102817/https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1172784483135614308 |date=4 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Petrucciani and Lloyd's tour of the [[West Coast of the United States]] was a huge success and they continued internationally. On 22 February 1985, with Petrucciani cradled in his arms, Lloyd walked onto the stage at [[Town Hall]] in New York City and sat him on his piano stool for what would be a historic evening in jazz history: the filming of ''[[One Night with Blue Note]]''. The film's director [[John Jopson|John Charles Jopson]] would later recall in the reissued liner notes that the moment moved him to tears.

Petrucciani and Lloyd's performance at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] was made into an album, and in 1982, they won the 1982 [[Prix d'Excellence]].&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; But Petrucciani expressed mostly disdain and frustration at the awards he felt were being heaped upon him, believing that he was receiving so many at least in part because people believed he was going to die young.&lt;ref name=documentary /&gt;

Petrucciani moved to New York City in 1984 and spent the rest of his life there. This was the most productive period of his career. He recorded with [[Wayne Shorter]] and [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]], producing the trio album ''Power of Three''.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; In 1986, Petrucciani recorded a live album with Wayne Shorter and Jim Hall. He also played with diverse figures in the U.S. jazz scene including [[Dizzy Gillespie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.jazzprofessional.com/profiles/Michel%20Petrucciani.htm |publisher=Jazz Professional |title=Michel Petrucciani |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051028133611/http://www.jazzprofessional.com/profiles/Michel%20Petrucciani.htm |archivedate=28 October 2005 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But he made a priority of recording solo piano also. He said: "I really believe a pianist is not complete until he's capable of playing by himself. I started doing solo concerts in February 1993, when I asked my agent to cancel my trio dates for a year in order to play nothing but solo recitals… I had a wonderful time playing alone, and discovering the piano and really studying every night. I felt like I was learning so much about the instrument and about communicating directly with an audience. So it was an incredible experience. I really loved doing that, and afterwards getting on stage with a group again and playing with other people was a piece of cake!"&lt;ref name="Shipton, Alyn 2004"&gt;{{Citation | last = Shipton | first = Alyn | title = Handful of Keys: Conversations with Thirty Jazz Pianists | place = New York | publisher = Routledge | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Regarding his personal life, he had five significant relationships: Erlinda Montano (marriage), Eugenia Morrison, Marie-Laure Roperch, the Italian pianist [[Gilda Buttà]] (the marriage lasted three months and ended in divorce) and Isabelle Mailé (with whom he shares his grave). With Marie-Laure he fathered a son, Alexandre, who inherited his condition. He also had a stepson named Rachid Roperch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.sunnysiderecords.com/artist.php?id=185 | publisher = Sunny Side Records | title = Petrucciani}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1417086/ | type = documentary | title = Michel Petrucciani | first = Michael | last = Radford | publisher = IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/08/classified/paid-notice-deaths-petrucciani-michel.html | date = 8 January 1999 | title = Petrucciani, Michel | newspaper = The New York Times | type = death notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, he was granted a [[Légion d'honneur]] in Paris.

In the late 1990s, Petrucciani's lifestyle became increasingly taxing. He was performing over 100 times per year, and in 1998, the year before he died, he performed 140 times. He became too weak to use crutches and had to resort to a wheelchair. His final manager said, "He was working too much – not only recording and doing concerts, but he was always on television, and he was always doing interviews. He got himself overworked, and you could see it. He pushed too much." In his later years Petrucciani was known to drink heavily.&lt;ref name=keys /&gt;

Petrucciani died from a pulmonary infection a week after his 36th birthday. He was interred in [[Le Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris, one tomb away from [[Frédéric Chopin]].&lt;ref name=keys /&gt;

On 12 February 2009, the French music channel [[Mezzo TV|Mezzo]] broadcast a special event paying homage to Petrucciani on the 10th anniversary of his death.

The first two American albums featuring Petrucciani were produced by Gabreal Franklin. The first, ''100 Hearts'', a solo album, was produced at the famous RCA Studio A, on the [[Avenue of the Americas]] in New York City. The second was a trio album, recorded live at Max Gordon's old [[Village Vanguard]] club in New York City. These were among the first albums to use digital recording technology, on Mitsubishi X80 recorders, so early on that the only manuals available were in Japanese; but Franklin and Tom Arrison managed to get them to function by trial and error.

==Personality and musical style==
[[Osteogenesis imperfecta]] seemed to contribute greatly both to Petrucciani's personality and his playing style. By his own account, he was in almost constant physical pain.&lt;ref name = documentary /&gt; Yet, he was known for his cheerful, playful, even cavalier personality. He said, "I love humor, I love to laugh, I love jokes, I love silliness, I love that, I think it's great, I think laughter is worth a whole lot of medicine."&lt;ref name=documentary /&gt;

Though he often exhibited arrogance and even womanizing tendencies in his adolescent years, the defining characteristic of Petrucciani was his confidence. Michael Zwerin recalled one example: "We were sitting there wondering what to play. It was kind of hot. And Michel said, 'anybody know "[[Giant Steps (composition)|Giant Steps]]?" Neither Louis nor I wanted to admit we didn't really know it. So there was this great silence. And Michel said, "Well, I do!" and he pounded into a solo version of it at a very fast clip, and it was really amazing. That to me is Michel—'Well, I do!' Man, a confidence you wouldn't believe."&lt;ref name=keys /&gt;

Petrucciani also appeared to have a quirky side. In a Mezzo documentary, he can be heard saying in a humorous voice, "I am very short!"&lt;ref name=documentary /&gt; Pussiau, the owner of Owl Records, recalled when he used to carry Michel for convenience. "Sometimes, when I used to carry him, he would bite my ear. We'd walk into a restaurant, and he'd ''chomp''.&lt;ref name=keys /&gt;

During his last years in New York, it seemed Michel's general attitude of carelessness was magnified. He said to his manager, "I want to have at least five women at once, I want to make a million dollars in one night." A common theory is that Petrucciani's awareness of his greatly reduced lifespan compelled his perseverance, success, social life, and recklessness all to extremes, but this does not seem to be the case. Michel himself expressed denial of the life-shortening nature{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} of his disease. In an interview, he said: "My handicap is not mortal. I won't die because of my handicap. It has nothing to do with that."&lt;ref name= documentary /&gt; He also said, "Eventually, when I get to be 75, I'll write a book on my deathbed."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk" /&gt; Yet other reliable sources assert that he was always aware of the potential effects of osteogenesis imperfecta.&lt;ref name=keys /&gt;

What is known for certain is that Michel Petrucciani was fiercely determined to take all the joy and satisfaction from life that he could. "I'm a brat," he said. "My philosophy is to have a really good time and never let anything stop me from doing what I want to do. It's like driving a car, waiting for an accident. That's no way to drive a car. If you have an accident, you have an accident—''c'est la vie''." He certainly lived true to his maxim. Just one week before he died of a pulmonary infection, he was up all night celebrating the new year with his friends.&lt;ref name="Shipton, Alyn 2004"/&gt;

Stylistically, Petrucciani is most frequently compared to [[Bill Evans]] and [[Keith Jarrett]] for his lyricism and [[Oscar Peterson]] for his virtuosity. His playing was often quite dramatic; critics accuse him of over-indulgence and cheap showmanship; sometimes dismiss his music as being too accessible. Petrucciani was loose and playful in a rhythm section, and gave attention to a strong articulation of the melody. He sometimes paused at the peaks of his solo lines before descending again, as if in appreciation of his idea.&lt;ref name = giants /&gt;

Michel distinguished himself most obviously from his primary inspiration in that he lacked Bill Evans's cerebral approach to the piano. Petrucciani's interest was primarily in simply playing; he spent little time reharmonizing or arranging.&lt;ref name=giants /&gt; "When I play, I play with my heart and my head and my spirit… I don't play to people's heads, but to their hearts." he says.&lt;ref name= keys /&gt; The moments of musical clarity or bliss he describes come during his performances. "You know sometimes when I play a concert… and I have that right timing… those notes make me feel warm and good… it's like lovemaking, it's like having an orgasm." Yet despite his emphasis on performance, he disliked applause, calling it old-fashioned and a distraction.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

Michel's unbridled love of the piano in no way entailed artistic carelessness. Indeed, he described the piano as literally taking him to his grave. "It might lead me to death… meaning that I'd be on my deathbed saying, too bad I can't live another year, I would have been much better."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; He also complained about mistakes, saying, "…the pitfall is that when I make a mistake it sounds absolutely outrageous, really horrible because everything else is so clear!"&lt;ref name="Shipton, Alyn 2004"/&gt;

[[Wayne Shorter]] summed up Michel Petrucciani's essential character and style in this quote:

"There's a lot of people walking around, full-grown and so-called normal—they have everything that they were born with at the right leg length, arm length, and stuff like that. They're symmetrical in every way, but they live their lives like they are armless, legless, brainless, and they live their life with blame. I never heard Michel complain about anything. Michel didn't look in the mirror and complain about what he saw. Michel was a great musician—a great musician—and great, ultimately, because he was a great human being because he had the ability to feel and give to others of that feeling, and he gave to others through his music."&lt;ref name=keys /&gt;

The '''military career of [[Hugo Chávez]]''' spans the seventeen years (1975–1992) that the later [[President of Venezuela]] spent in the Venezuelan army. Leader of the "[[Bolivarian Revolution]]", Chávez is known for his professed and self-proclaimed [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] governance, his promotion of [[Panamericanism|Latin American integration]], and his radical critique of [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] globalization and [[foreign relations of the United States|United States foreign policy]].{{Sfn|O'Keefe|2005}}

Born 28 July 1954 in rural [[Sabaneta, Barinas|Sabaneta]], Chávez entered military service upon his graduation from the [[Military academy of Venezuela]] in 1975, as a military officer. Chávez thereafter held a variety of post, command, and staff positions. At the time, he was increasingly drawn into leftist political movements; he eventually engaged in electioneering and political conspiracy. Chávez led a violent [[Venezuelan coup attempt of 1992|1992 civilian-military coup]] which sought to overthrow a democratically elected government that he saw as a corrupt oligarchy. Although the coup ultimately failed—ending Chávez's military career—it also brought Chávez into the national spotlight and set the stage for his future rise to political power.

==Early military career (1975–1982)==
After his undergraduate studies concluded in 1975, Chávez entered active-duty military service. Chávez's first assignment was as commander of a communications platoon attached to a counter-insurgency force—the Manuel Cedeño Mountain Infantry Battalion, headquartered in Barinas and Cumaná. In 1976, it was tasked with suppressing a guerilla insurgency staged by the [[Hoxhaism|Hoxhaist]] Partido Bandera Roja ([[Red Flag Party]]).{{Sfn|Marcano|Barrera Tyszka|2005|pp=75–76}}{{Sfn|Gott|2005|p=36}} Despite this, Chávez saw little actual combat; this was due to a low density of insurgent activity in the Cumaná region. Later, in 1977, Chávez was appointed as a communications officer at the Center of Tactical Operations in San Mateo; it was here that Chávez first received first-hand and hands-on experience in counter-insurgency tactics.{{Sfn|Marcano|Barrera Tyszka|2005|pp=75–76}} Chávez later recalled that, during these years, he experienced growing sympathy for the waning guerilla movements—the very groups he was tasked with countering. He harbored a growing dislike of what he viewed as corruption among the military hierarchy. He perceived such problems as a direct result of political corruption.{{Sfn|Gott|2005|p=36}}

At the age of 23, Chávez married Nancy Colmenares. Colmenares, like Chávez, was also from Barinas and had roots in Venezuela's plains culture. Colmenares' friends gossiped that she was already pregnant with their first daughter before they were married in 1977.{{Sfn|Marcano|Barrera Tyszka|2005|p=77}} Thereafter, Chávez began to lead a "double life": while feigning disciplined obedience amidst his military superiors and miming political neutrality around his family, Chávez engaged in secret trysts with known socialists, communists, and other leftists.{{Sfn|Marcano|Barrera Tyszka|2005|p=81}}

From 1978 through 1979, Chávez was commander and squad leader of the 414th Apure Braves AMX-30 armored battalion in Maracay. (The unit's anthem, [[Fatherland Beloved]] by Venezuelan composer Heriberto Maluenga, the then battalion [[military band]] conductor when he served with the battalion, was the one song he sang during his December 8, 2012 final TV address to the nation.) Chávez received promotions in rapid succession, and was eventually appointed company commander and head of the Department of Physical Education at the Military Academy of Venezuela, remaining in that position from 1980 to 1981. He then headed the Department of Culture at the Academy in 1982. Chávez was also a founding commander of the José Antonio Páez Company at the Academy from 1983 to 1984. At the time, Chávez gained recognition for his lectures at Caracas's war college, in which he spoke for hours in a "folksy" manner that captivated supporters in his audiences.{{Sfn|Chávez|2005b}} Chávez's interest in Venezuelan politics only grew throughout his career in the military.{{Sfn|Guillermoprieto|2005}}

Chávez received several decorations: the Star of Carabobo (''Estrella de Carabobo''); the Land Forces Cross (''Cruz de las Fuerzas Terrestres''); and was awarded the Military Order of Francisco de Miranda, the Order of Rafael Urdaneta, and the Order of the Liberator, 5th Class (Military Division).{{Sfn|Government of Venezuela 2006}} Chávez continued playing baseball and softball: he went to the 1976 National Baseball Championships, held in Barinas; and he played in military baseball tournaments, among the most important of which were those held in Cumaná in 1977 and the Dominican Republic in 1980. Apart from his writing, Chávez sculpted, producing such works as the 1980 ''Sombra de Guerra en el Golfo'' ("Shadows of War in the Gulf").{{Sfn|Government of Venezuela 2006}}

==Premonitions of a military-civilian coup (1982–1989)==

Chávez's first attempt at launching a political movement came in 1977, when he formed the ''Ejército de Liberación del Pueblo de Venezuela'', or ''ELPV''—the "Liberation Army of the Venezuelan People". Years later, he recalled that the ''ELPV'''s purpose was to "prepare ourselves in case something should happen" and that it was "an important pointer to the future".{{Sfn|Gott|2005|p=37}} In 1978, dressed in his army fatigues, Chávez met then-presidential candidate [[José Vicente Rangel]]—who later became Chávez's vice-president—and subsequently aided him in affixing election materials in Maracay. Chávez risked expulsion from the military had his superiors found out about such leftist political activities. Under Venezuelan law at the time, military officers and other personnel were forbidden from involving themselves in political affairs of any sort. Moreover, engaging in such illicit activities while dressed in fatigues or in uniform was punishable by even harsher penalties.{{Sfn|Marcano|Barrera Tyszka|2005|p=82}}

It was not until the period 1982–1983 that Chávez seriously began to plot the overthrow of Venezuela's elected civilian leaders.{{Sfn|Gott|2005|p=38}} On 17 December 1982, Chávez and his co-conspirators gathered under a large tree at Samán de Güere. There, they solemnly witnessed each other's repetition of a revised version of the oath Simon Bolivar undertook while upon Italy's Monte Sacro, this time adding [[Ezequiel Zamora]]'s slogan during the [[Federal War]]:{{Sfn|Gott|2005|p=38}}{{Sfn|Rico|Torrecilla|2002}}

On 24 July 1983, Chávez—along with peers from his days at the military academy—launched the ''Ejército Revolucionario Bolivariano'' (''EBR-200''—"Revolutionary Bolivarian Army"). The "''200''" in ''EBR-200'''s name derives from the movement's founding on the 200th anniversary of Simón Bolívar's birth. The movement established as its political goal the realization of "[[Bolivarianism]]" by means of a "Bolivarian Revolution".{{Sfn|Marcano|Barrera Tyszka|2005|p=90}} Chávez continued to play baseball in the military leagues. Indeed, he progressed with his team to the University League Championships, which were held in Caracas between 1984 and 1985. Chávez wrote collections of stories and poems, including ''Vuelvan Caras'', ''Mauricio'' and ''El Genio y el Centauro'' ("The Genius and the Centaur"). ''El Genio y el Centauro'' garnered him 3rd prize at a 1987 competition held in the ''Teatro Histórico Nacional'' ("National Historical Theater") in Cañafístola. One of his poems honored the late Felipe Acosta Carles, a co-founder of the ''EBR-200''.{{Sfn|Government of Venezuela 2006}}

In March 1986, the ''EBR-200'' held its third congress in [[San Cristóbal, Venezuela|San Cristobal]], close to Venezuela's frontier with war-torn Colombia. The ''EBR-200'''s inner circle came together for the secret meeting. Nine people attended, including six military personnel (including Chávez) and three civilians. Chávez's then-collaborator, [[Francisco Arias Cardenas]] (who, twelve years later, would lose the 2000 presidential election to Chávez) attended. Also in attendance was one of Chávez's uncles. Only one woman attended: Herma Marksman, who by then had become Chávez's mistress. Chávez's own wife and children remained alone in Sabaneta during these years. The attendees sought ways to attain power through a civilian-military power grab, a common method of power seizure in much of South and Latin America's history.{{Sfn|Marcano|Barrera Tyszka|2005|pp=93–95}} Marksman played a crucial role in both Chávez's political and personal lives. Upfront, Chávez told Marksman that he would never marry her. Chávez stated that this stemmed from his mother's refusal to allow him to divorce Nancy. Nevertheless, he told Marksman that she was needed in his life. Thus, for nine years, Marksman would aid Chávez's plans by ferrying and delivering messages for him across the country. She performed various other tasks: placing phone calls and taking notes at meetings.{{Sfn|Guillermoprieto|2005}}

Leaders of the extreme left movement ''La Causa R''—such as founder Alfredo Maneira (just prior to his 1983 death) and leader Pablo Medina—held meetings with Chávez.{{Sfn|Gott|2005|pp=59–60}}{{Sfn|Marcano|Barrera Tyszka|2005|p=98}} Medina recounts that during their meetings Chávez always came across as a jovial person. This was despite recollections of his taciturn demeanor. Medina recalled that Chávez did not articulate his own opinions. Rather, he appeared as a "sponge" via his absorption of vast amounts of information. In this regard, Chávez always reportedly requested a hard copy of all documents he was shown.{{Sfn|Marcano|Barrera Tyszka|2005|p=99}} Nothing of substance came of these initial contacts.{{Sfn|Gott|2005|p=60}} Chávez, then a lieutenant, was stationed as commander of a motorized army division—the Francisco Farfán Cavalry Unit—in remote Elorza, Apure between 1985 and 1986. Elorza itself was situated twelve hours due south (by local bus){{Sfn|Gott|2005|p=41}} from Barinas and towards the vast Venezuelan interior. The distance from his previous acquaintances (including his brother Adán and numerous leftist associates) meant that Chávez had much less opportunity to plan for his desired insurrection. By 1987, Chávez and Arias were seen by associates as the clear leaders of the ''EBR-200''. They together determined that it would be most opportune to launch their coup attempt halfway through the next president's term (they were not concerned about who won the presidential election). They reasoned that it was typically at mid-term that the President and his administration polled their lowest popularity levels.{{Sfn|Marcano|Barrera Tyszka|2005|p=98}}

Later, Chávez commanded the Civilian-Military Development Nucleus at the Arauca-Meta border between 1986 and 1988. There, Chávez took advantage of his authority by implementing experimental civilian-military programs. In these programs, he organized such military aid efforts directed at the surrounding population as socioeconomic development initiatives, historical re-enactments and pageants, and oral history documentation efforts.{{Sfn|Gott|2005|pp=41–42}} Chávez was also in charge of all patron saints' feasts held in Elorza, Apure between 1987 and 1988.{{Sfn|Government of Venezuela 2006}} Chávez realized that such projects would be essential in order to effectively allow Latin America to regain an autonomous cultural identity independent of U.S. "cultural imperialism".{{Sfn|Lynn|2003}} Yet, in 1988, Chávez was seconded to the Miraflores presidential palace; there, he was appointed assistant head of the National Security and Defense Council by ''Accion Democratica'' President [[Jaime Lusinchi]]. The post would see Chávez sent off briefly to Central America on official business;{{Sfn|Gott|2005|p=42}} he would remain at the post until 1989.{{Sfn|Government of Venezuela 2006}}

==Reaction to the ''Caracazo'' (1989)==
Throughout Chávez's early life, Venezuela had enjoyed a period of economic and democratic stability that was remarkable in South America at the time. This stability was partly based on Venezuela's massive foreign exchange earnings gained from petroleum exports. Venezuelans referred to their society as ''Venezuela Saudíta'' ("Saudi Venezuela"—a parody of Saudi Arabia's heavily modernized and oil-based economy).{{Sfn|Guillermoprieto|2005}}{{Sfn|Gott|2005|p=37}}{{Sfn|Guevara|1999}} When Saudi Arabia itself and other United States-aligned oil producers significantly raised their production output—in an attempt to bring about economic implosion in the heavily oil-dependent Soviet Union—a global oil glut ensued. Oil prices collapsed to historic lows, and Venezuelan oil earnings, and economic and social stability in general, were suddenly imperiled: in the 1980s, per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) fell by more than 20%, and by 1989 real wages fell to a third of their previous levels.{{Sfn|Cartaya|Magallanes|Domínguez|1997}}{{Sfn|Schuyler|2001|p=10}} The nation also faced a dire [[balance of payments]] crisis.{{Sfn|DiJohn|2004|p=4}}

Responding to this, in 1989 the [[Carlos Andrés Pérez]] administration enacted sweeping and ambitious [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]-inspired neoliberal [[structural adjustment]] programs.{{Sfn|DiJohn|2004|pp=3–4}} Nevertheless, these reforms were widely unpopular among poor and working class Venezuelans. Such measures involved the removal of state-managed development and industrialization, the implementation of market liberalization measures, enactment of [[export subsidy|export subsidies]] and incentives, extensive privatization of state-owned holdings, curtailed social spending, the release of longstanding [[incomes policy|price controls]] on many goods, as well as liberalization of capital and liquidity flows into and out of Venezuela.{{Sfn|Schuyler|2001|p=10}}{{Sfn|Gott|2005|pp=51–52}} The programs' international backers—including renowned Harvard economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]]—as well as domestic business groups such as ''Grupo Roraima'' thereby sought to restore fiscal stability and responsibility to Venezuela's ailing economy.{{Sfn|DiJohn|2004|pp=5–6}} These policies yielded mixed social and economic results.{{Sfn|DiJohn|2004|pp=7–8}} In 1991 and 1992, Venezuela experienced GDP growth rates of 10.3% and 7%, respectively. Such remarkable results resulted mainly from Pérez's drive to increase investments in the oil industry.{{Sfn|Country Watch 2005}}

Yet, other indicators suffered. Sharp declines in measures of human well-being exacerbated a growing social crisis. Much hardship was thus generated among Venezuela's poor majority.{{Sfn|Schuyler|2001|pp=10–11}}{{Sfn|DiJohn|2004|p=1}} Incidences of hunger, prostitution, murder, and other ills rose sharply, while continuing surges in Venezuela's national debt and flagging foreign direct investment inflows continued to hammer the Venezuelan economy.{{Sfn|Schuyler|2001|p=11}} Further, the neoliberal reforms failed to lower high poverty rates of the 1990s.{{Sfn|Schuyler|2001|p=11}} This continuing poverty complimented Latin American economies' general skewing towards satiating elite consumptive interests while simultaneously relieving upper classes from substantial taxes that would subsidize the poor.{{Sfn|Chomsky|1998|p=33}}

Discontent with the general socioeconomic decline erupted in the violent 27 February 1989 [[Caracazo]] riots; they were the most destructive and deadly such disturbances in Venezuelan history.{{Sfn|Gott|2005|pp=43–44}} Officially, 372 deaths occurred—although some critics of the government claim that the actual total is well in excess of two thousand.{{Sfn|Gott|2005|p=45}} Outraged mobs engaged in mass arson against whole city blocks. Several days passed before troops restored full order. At the time, Chávez was ill.{{Sfn|Marcano|Barrera Tyszka|2005|p=100}} Thus, he was not ordered to help suppress the riots that were breaking out in primarily poor neighborhoods.{{Sfn|Gott|2005|p=46}} Yet, Chávez recalls observing the unfolding events—and realizing that he had missed his "strategic minute" to launch his coup.{{Sfn|Guillermoprieto|2005}} Thus unable for the moment to capitalize on the popular anger and unrest, Chávez refined his critique of what he saw as an irredeemably corrupt traditional two-party ''[[puntofijismo]]'' system.{{Sfn|Guillermoprieto|2005}} Subsequently, Chávez's political rhetoric would dramatically mature; after these ''Caracazo'' riots, Chávez always chose to refer to the type of neoliberalism practiced by Pérez as so-called "savage" neoliberalism. He saw such economic reform packages—including the ten-point "[[Washington Consensus]]" reform program advanced by former [[International Monetary Fund]] advisor [[John Williamson (economist)|John Williamson]]—as forcibly imposed upon the unwilling populations of Latin America by the U.S. government and allied leaders.{{Sfn|Gott|2005|p=50}} In response, Chávez intensified preparations for the Bolivarian military-civilian coup.{{Sfn|Gott|2005|pp=55–56}}

==Final coup preparations (1989–1992)==
&lt;!-- [[File:Chavezcoup.jpg|thumb|right|Chávez meets with [[Francisco Arias|Francisco Arias Cardenas]].]] --&gt;

Weeks after the ''Caracazo'', Chávez returned to work at Miraflores. Chávez recalled that the presidential palace's guards stopped and questioned him. They reportedly asked him: "[l]ook here, major, is it true about the Bolivarian Movement? We'd like to hear more about it; we're not prepared to go on killing people".{{Sfn|Gott|2005|p=47}} Chávez took this as a sign that his plan to overthrow the government was gaining momentum. By late 1989, the first civilians joined the EBR-200's ranks. The EBR-200 thus changed its name to the ''Movimiento Bolivariano Revolucionario-200'' (MBR-200—the "[[Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200]]"). The supplanting of the word "Army" (''Ejército'') with "Movement" (''Movimiento'') was intended to punctuate this shift.{{Sfn|Marcano|Barrera Tyszka|2005|p=101}} However, on 6 December 1989, Chávez along with other senior officers were abruptly arrested. They were brought before army command on charges of plotting a coup that was suspected by the government as planned for Christmas Day. They were accused of planning the assassination of high government officials, including President Pérez. Yet the officers were eventually released—due to lack of evidence. The government was reluctant to prosecute officers who were recognized in the military as among the best in their respective armed services.{{Sfn|Marcano|Barrera Tyszka|2005|pp=101–102}} Nevertheless, all—including Chávez—were thereafter sent to posts far from the federal government in Caracas.{{Sfn|Gott|2005|pp=47–48}} Chávez was sent in 1990 to Maturín, where he was appointed the official in charge of civilian matters with the Ranger Brigade headquartered in the area. Chávez was later allowed to matriculate at the [[Universidad Simón Bolívar]] ("Simón Bolívar University") in Caracas, where he did graduate work in political science. He left without a degree.{{Sfn|Gott|2005b}} Chávez took courses until August 1991.

Chávez re-entered military service with an initial re-posting to Cumaná, where a desk job awaited him. Chávez recalled feeling that such a seemingly dull and minor posting was beneath him.{{Sfn|Marcano|Barrera Tyszka|2005|p=105}} Thereafter, from 1991 to 4 February 1992, Chávez was again given his own command—the Maracay-based Colonel Antonio Nicolas Briceño 421st Airborne Battalion, 42nd Airborne Brigade, of the Venezuelan Army's 4th Armored Division (then the 4th Infantry Division).{{Sfn|Government of Venezuela 2006}} Such troops proved key in facilitating Chávez's violent political ambitions.{{Sfn|Berger|2004}}{{Sfn|Gott|2005|p=68}} Chávez received the job when the battalion's former commander retired from the army; Chávez was his replacement as commanding offivcer. With a posting in Maracay, a city that is relatively near the national power structures in Caracas, Chávez's coup plans were no longer hindered by his own geographic isolation. Later, reports emerged of a dossier detailing all of Chávez's subversive activities. It had been produced just prior to Chávez's new Maracay posting—yet, the document was ignored by military intelligence. The major who had compiled it was ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation.{{Sfn|Marcano|Barrera Tyszka|2005|p=105}}

By 1991, Chávez and other MBR-200 leaders activated the coup plan codenamed after one of Chávez's heroes, Ezequiel Zamora—''Plan Zamora''.{{Sfn|Marcano|Barrera Tyszka|2005|p=105}} Yet despite planning ''for'' the coup's execution, Chávez and other MBR-200 leaders made precious little plans about what their putative future rebel government would do ''after'' the rebellion. Their future governing structure thus remained vague until the end of 1991, when Chávez and others decided to delineate an initial legal framework for their government's operation.{{Sfn|Marcano|Barrera Tyszka|2005|p=106}} Several assorted coup dates were proposed by Chávez's associates. Indeed, many junior captains threatened to launch their own early coup, which would be independent of that waged by their higher ranked commanders. They threatened this action if Chávez refused to pick a date that they considered soon enough. Yet Chávez refused to budge on a December 1991 attempt. He stated that nothing was to be attempted without his involvement. The captains thus waited for Chávez's chosen date.{{Sfn|Marcano|Barrera Tyszka|2005|p=107}} Yet one aspect of the planned coup remained clear throughout: Chávez's demand that it maintain a primarily military focus and character. The leftist ex-guerrilla leader [[Douglas Bravo]]—who fought in the 1960s and 1970s—also regularly met Chávez. These meetings took place during the years leading up to the coup and without the knowledge of other key MBR-200 officers. Bravo recounted that Chávez did not trust civilians enough to afford them a role in his bloody intrigue. According to him, it was for this reason that what was initially planned as a civilian-military rebellion was pared down by Chávez to one fought solely by soldiers; Bravo and his leftist civilian cohorts were turfed out of logistical considerations, preparations, and planning just days before the coup.{{Sfn|Marcano|Barrera Tyszka|2005|pp=104–105}}

Yet, towards the end of January 1992, Chávez realized that the Movement's window of opportunity was to close. Chávez received notification that he faced imminent transferral on 14 February—to a small village on the frontier with war-ravaged Colombia. Chávez realized that this posting would jeopardize his participation in the MBR-200 coup, as the town was far from the major cities and power centers of Venezuela's northern coastal strip. Alarmed at this prospect, Chávez and other Movement members held one final meeting. There, they determined to act before Chávez's transfer. They would quicken preparations and wait until President Pérez—who was just then abroad on a trip to the 1992 [[World Economic Forum]], held in Switzerland—returned to Venezuela.{{Sfn|Marcano|Barrera Tyszka|2005|p=109}} All the while, MBR-200 rebel forces built up their numbers. Eventually, 5 lieutenant colonels, 14 majors, 54 captains, 67 first and second lieutenants, 65 warrant officers and technical non-commissioned personnel, 101 sergeants and senior non-commissioned officers and 2,056 corporals and enlisted servicemen were involved in the conspiracy; thus Chávez and other rebel commanders had 2,367 military personnel from 10 army battalions to rely upon.{{Sfn|Marcano|Barrera Tyszka|2005|pp=123–124}} They set a final date for their coup: Tuesday, 4 February 1992.{{Sfn|Marcano|Barrera Tyszka|2005|p=109}}

'''Philip Hauge Abelson''' (April 27, 1913 – August 1, 2004) was an American physicist, a scientific editor, and a science writer.

==Life==
Abelson was born on April 27, 1913,&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Abelson, Philip Hauge|edition=15th |year=2010|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago, Illinois |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. He attended [[Washington State University]], where he received degrees in [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], and the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (UC Berkeley), where he earned his PhD in [[nuclear physics]]. As a young physicist, he worked for [[Ernest Lawrence]] at the UC Berkeley. He was among the first American scientists to verify [[nuclear fission]] in an article submitted to the [[Physical Review]] in February 1939.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author=Philip Abelson
 |year=1939
 |title=Cleavage of the Uranium Nucleus
 |journal=[[Physical Review]]
 |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=418
 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.55.418
|bibcode = 1939PhRv...55..418A }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1939 until 1941, he worked as an assistant physicist at the [[Carnegie Institution]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] It was while he was here that he worked on a substance that emitted [[beta rays]] and was produced by irradiation of [[uranium]] with [[neutron]]s. After he collaborated with the [[Nobel Prize laureate]] [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] they isolated the material, and became the co-discoverer of [[neptunium]] on 8 June 1940 with [[Edwin McMillan]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; McMillan was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] for this discovery among other elements.

Abelson was a key contributor to the [[Manhattan Project]] during [[World War II]], while working with the [[Naval Research Laboratory]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Although he was not formally associated with the [[atom bomb]] project, the [[Thermophoresis|liquid thermal diffusion]] [[isotope separation]] technique that he invented at the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]]  was used in the [[S-50 (Manhattan Project)|S-50 plant]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]], [[Tennessee]], and proved a critical step in creating the large amount of nuclear fuel required for building atomic bombs.

After the war, he turned his attention under the guidance of [[Ross Gunn]] to applying [[nuclear power]] to [[nuclear marine propulsion|naval propulsion]]. While not written at an engineering-design level, he wrote the first physics report detailing how a [[nuclear reactor]] could be installed in a [[submarine]], providing both [[Marine propulsion|propulsion]] and [[electric power|electrical power]]. His report anticipated the [[nuclear submarine]]'s role as a [[Submarine-launched ballistic missile|missile platform]]. This concept was later supported by [[Admiral]] [[Hyman G. Rickover]] and others. Under Rickover, the concept became reality in the form of {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|6}}, the world's first nuclear submarine.

In 1946, he returned to work at the [[Carnegie Institution]], which published his report “Atomic Energy Submarine,” in March of that year.&lt;ref&gt;"Underway on Nuclear Power" -- The Man Behind the Words: Eugene P. "Dennis" Wilkinson, Vice Admiral USN. The American Nuclear Society.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1953 until 1971 he served as the director of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]]'s [[Geophysical Laboratory]], and as president from 1971 to 1978, and as a trustee from 1978 on.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; From 1962 to 1984 he was editor of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', one of the most prestigious [[academic journals]], and served as its acting [[executive officer]] in 1974, 1975 and 1984. From 1972 until 1974 he served as the president of the [[American Geophysical Union]].

Abelson was outspoken and well known for his opinions on science.  In a 1964 editorial published in ''Science'' magazine, Abelson identified [[overspecialization]] in science as a form of [[bigotry]].  He outlined his view that the pressure towards specialization beginning in undergraduate study and intensifying in PhD programs leads students to believe that their area of specialization is the most important, even to the extreme view that other intellectual pursuits are worthless.  He reasoned that such overspecialization led to obsolescence of one's work, often through a focus on trivial aspects of a field, and that avoidance of such bigotry was essential to guiding the direction of one's work.&lt;ref&gt;

In a 1965 article he described his work in [[paleobiology]] and reported evidence of [[amino acids]] recovered from [[fossils]] hundreds of millions of years in age and [[fatty acid]]s in rocks dating over a billion years old.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;  He estimated that based on his experiments [[alanine]] would be stable for billions of years.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps his most famous work from this time period is an editorial entitled "Enough of Pessimism" ("enough of pessimism, it only leads to paralysis and decay"). This became the title of a 100 essay collection.&lt;ref&gt;

During the 1970s he became interested in the problem of world energy supplies. Books on the topic include ''Energy for Tomorrow'' (1975), from a series of lectures at the University of Washington, and ''Energy II: Use Conservation and Supply''. He pointed out the possibilities of mining the [[Athabascan tar sands]], as well as [[oil shale]] in the [[Colorado]] [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]]. In addition he urged conservation and a change of attitude towards public transit.&lt;ref&gt;

After 1984, he remained associated with the magazine. Some have claimed him to be an early [[global warming controversy|skeptic]] of the case for [[global warming]] on the basis of a lead editorial in the magazine dated March 31, 1990, in which he wrote, "[I]f the global warming situation is analyzed applying the customary standards of scientific inquiry one must conclude that there has been more hype than solid fact." However, this contrasts what is said in a US National Research Council, Energy and Environment report on which his name appears along with Thomas F. Malone over a decade earlier in 1977:

{{Quote|What is important is not that there are differences [in the models] but that the span of agreement embraces a fourfold to eightfold increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in the latter part of the twenty-second century. Our best understanding of the relation between an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and change in global temperature suggests a corresponding increase in average world temperature of more than 6°C, with polar temperature increases of as much as three times this figure. This would exceed by far the temperature fluctuations of the past several thousand years and would very likely, along the way, have a highly significant impact on global precipitation.|Philip H. Abelson, Thomas F. Malone, Cochairmen, Geophysics Study Committee &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12024&amp;page=R7 Energy and Climate: Studies in Geophysics (1977), National Research Council, Forward]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Abelson died on August 1, 2004, from respiratory complications following a brief illness. He was married to [[Neva Abelson]], a distinguished research [[physician]] who co-discovered the [[Rh blood factor test]] (with [[L. K. Diamond]]). Their daughter, [[Ellen Abelson Cherniavsky]], worked as an [[aviation]] researcher for the [[MITRE]] corporation in [[Virginia]].

==Awards and legacy==
Abelson received many distinguished awards, including the [[National Medal of Science]] in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/results.cfm?action=find National Science Foundation - The President's National Medal of Science]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Science Foundation]]'s [[Distinguished Achievement Award]], the [[American Medical Association]]'s [[AMA Scientific Achievement Award|Scientific Achievement Award]], the [[Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Medal]] and the [[Waldo E. Smith Medal]] in 1988. In 1992 he was awarded the [[Public Welfare Medal]], the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]'s highest honor.&lt;ref name=PublicWelfare&gt;{{cite web |title=Public Welfare Award |url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_pwm |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1958.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web |title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A |url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf |publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mineral [[abelsonite]] is named after Abelson in recognition of his contribution to [[organic geochemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv|last1=Milton|first1=Charles|last2=Dwornik|first2=Edward J.|last3=Estep-Barnes|first3=Patricia A.|last4=Finkelman|first4=Robert B.|last5=Pabst|first5=Adolf|last6=Palmer|first6=Susan|title=Abelsonite, Nickel Porphyrin: A New Mineral from the Green River Formation, Utah|journal=American Mineralogist|date=September–October 1978|volume=63|issue=9&amp;ndash;10|page=930|url=http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM63/AM63_930.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paracha''' ([[Urdu]]: پراچہ ; [[Persian language|Persian]]: پاراچا) (also known as '''Peracha''', '''Piracha''' ,'''Pracha''', '''Paracha''') is a family name, originating from the descendants of [[Ali Yamani]], who was responsible for the preparation of [[Muhammad]] seating area and as some believe the descendants of [[Alexander the Great]] although that theory is highly debatable. The Pirachas originally were called the Ferashas which means butterfly but as the name seeped into the Persian culture and after a man named Abul Aas married a Persian princess the name was transformed into Paracha to suit the Persian language better.

== History ==
They were migrated from northern Yemen during the 7th Century AD and travelled to Iran where they were called Ferashas or people who were direct descendants of [[Ali Yamani]], a cloth trader who used to prepare the seating area of [[Muhammad]]. Ferash in Persian means ground. Many from this tribe/clan eventually travelled into Afghanistan and Pakistan, mostly in the north which is why there are speculations of them being related to [[Alexander the Great]]. Others settled in [[Makhad]] in about 12th Century AD. In Pakistan they became to known as Pirachas. It is believed the clan settled in what is presently northern Pakistan although a lot have moved into southern Pakistan in areas such as Karachi.

Today, the Pirachas are scattered all over the world, and follow the various professions which are mainly business, trading, writing, and politics. Piracha's (known by the individual prefixes of the seven groups) are wealthy traders of Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Pirachas share a strong bound with Iran as their ancestors migrated from Iran.

Although there are many theories as to how the Pirachas came to be none have been proven and are just considered rumours among people. Information seems to be passed along generations upon generations and the basis as to how the Pirachas came to be is still a mystery. Various people from all over Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran names Pirachas all seem to believe in different theories as there really is no real history to how the name came to be.

'''Salman Ahmad''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|سلمان احمد}}}}, born 12 December 1963) is a [[People of Pakistan|Pakistani]] musician, [[Pakistani rock|rock guitarist]], [[physician]], [[Social activist|activist]], and [[professor]] at the [[Queens College, City University of New York|City University]] of [[New York City|New York]].

He earned nationwide popularity in 1998 for his unique style of [[Pakistani classical music|neoclassical]] playing in [[Rock music|rock]]. An early engineer of the [[Vital Signs (band)|''Vital Signs'']], he formed [[Junoon (band)|''Junoon'']] (lit. Obsession) in 1990 with [[Americans|American]] [[Bass guitar|bassist]] [[Brian O'Connell (musician)|Brian O'Connell]] and pioneered the [[Sufi rock|Sufi]] influenced rock music in Pakistan. He started his activism in the mid-1990s and has been involved in two [[BBC]] documentaries concerning the issues in Pakistan such as [[Pakistani society|society]], [[Education in Pakistan|education]], [[Religion in Pakistan|religion]] and [[Science in Pakistan|science]].

He has served as the [[UN Goodwill Ambassador]] for [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|HIV/AIDS Programme]] towards spreading awareness about [[HIV/AIDS in Asia|HIV in South Asia]]. While working with the Pakistan's [[Media of Pakistan|media]] to help initiate [[Aman ki Asha|peace]] between [[India and Pakistan relations|India and Pakistan]], Ahmad continues to produce documentaries and solo guitar albums. At present, he is serving tenured professor at the [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] of the [[City University of New York]] although, with Junoon being disintegrated, Salman Ahmad continues to perform as a solo artist under the "Junoon" label and has moved to New York and released one album as a solo artist, "Infiniti" in 2005.

==Early life==
Salman Ahmad spent his childhood in Pakistan, before moving to New York when his father got a job in the airline industry. Ahmad then attended middle and high school in the United States, where he was first exposed to rock music at a [[Led Zeppelin]] concert at [[Madison Square Garden]]. Motivated to become a musician, he began learning the guitar against his parents wishes. After graduation, he returned to Pakistan in order to attend medical school. However, due to vast changes in the political climate and the advent of extremism, Ahmad's guitar playing was repressed. He took action by playing at covert talent shows, unfazed by criticism and even death threats from extremists. These underground performances and the consequent censorship set the stage for him to become a peace advocate and eventually found the bands Junoon and Vital Signs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ahmad|first1=Salman|title=Rock and Roll Jihad|url=https://themoth.org/storytellers/salman-ahmad|website=The Moth|publisher=Public Radio Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==

He has been teaching a class on music titled "Islamic Music and Culture of South Asia", as a guest faculty at [[Queens College]]. This year, he started his second semester as a guest faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.cuny.edu/portal_ur/news/cuny_matters/2007/fall/1.html|title=CUNY Matters Fall 2007: Colleges in Diverse Borough of Queens Create Musical Mosaic Featuring Voices of Moses and Mohammad|website=www1.cuny.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 1 March 2008, Ahmad performed with [[Yale Strom]] (a world leading [[Klezmer]] artist) at Temple Beth Sholom in Roslyn Heights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbsroslyn.org |title=Temple Beth Sholom – Rosyln Heights, NY |publisher=Tbsroslyn.org |date= |accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of another "Common Chords II" concert&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qc.cuny.edu/nis/Releases/viewNews.php?id=297 ]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; celebrating Muslim and Jewish Music. Together with Strom, Ahmad leads the multi-faith ensemble Common Chords, whose members include Chatterjee, dhol player Sunny Jain, bassist Mark Dresser, vocalist Elizabeth Schwartz and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonchordsmusic.com|title=Mix Files - Making you different|website=www.commonchordsmusic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, his new song "Kaise Bolun" from an upcoming [[Bollywood]] movie "Rhythm" starring Adeel Chaudhry has received enormous negative feedback from his fans on social media through showing their discomfort over song's music and video. According to people, they never expected such kind of music from legendary Salman Ahmad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Review: Salman Ahmad’s ‘Kaise Bolun’ is an insult to his artistic prowess|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/1055051/review-salman-ahmads-kaise-bolun-is-an-insult-to-his-artistic-prowess/|work=The Express Tribune|date=February 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Kaise Bolun’: The Unruly Mess That Salman Ahmad Has Made|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/magazine/instep-today/101772-Kaise-Bolun-The-unruly-mess-that-Salman-Ahmad-has-made|work=The News-International|date=February 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship==
Ahmad and his band Junoon suffered political censorship in Pakistan during the administration of [[Benazir Bhutto]] in the 1990s, partly due to a song denouncing political corruption. In 1998 during the administration of [[Nawaz Sharif]], [[Junoon (band)|Junoon]] was again banned in Pakistan, because they protested against the [[nuclear test|nuclear power tests]] in India as well as their own country by saying, "Why escalate the arms race when people still need water? Why see our neighbors as enemies when we are so close to each other?"

Ahmad played at the Roskilde Festival in 2000 under the banner of Freemuse, just a couple of years after the ban. As a musician who faced censorship in his home country, Ahmad says that "there is no conflict between my faith and my music, you can be a Muslim and play electric guitar".

In 2006, during a Freemuse conference in [[Beirut]] he was part of one of the rare occasions where music and religion was taken seriously and where discussions on music and [[Islam]] focused on theology and not just social and cultural patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freemuse.org/sw32379.asp |title=Human Rights for Musicians – Impressions &amp; Descriptions: Salman Ahmad |publisher=Freemuse |date= |accessdate=10 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225083245/http://www.freemuse.org/sw32379.asp |archivedate=25 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; About this he said, "I've taken part in Freemuse dialogue meetings and press meetings. They have always been great meetings places for musicians, researchers and journalists and I've always felt that understanding the motivations behind and the mechanisms of censorship have been in focus – not just condemning censorship. Having said that, we, the artists, should always be ready to defend our colleagues when the rights to freedom of expression are attacked, and thus we need an organisation such as Freemuse to help us do this."

== Nobel Peace Prize concert in Norway ==
Televised in around 100 countries, Ahmad and his band [[Junoon (band)|Junoon]] performed with artists from all over the world at the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] Concert in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], on 11 December 2007. He also played at the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony on 9 December 2007, where he was joined by tabla virtuoso Pandit Samir Chatterjee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freemuse.org/sw23150.asp |title=Ambassador' plays Nobel Peace Prize concert |publisher=Freemuse |date= |accessdate=10 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225083225/http://www.freemuse.org/sw23150.asp |archivedate=25 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writer ==
Salman Ahmad published an autobiographical work titled "[[Rock &amp; Roll Jihad: A Muslim Rock Star's Revolution]]" in January 2010.  The book was published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. [[Melissa Etheridge]] wrote the following in the introduction:

{{quote|text=The story you are about to read is the story of a light-bringer. Salman Ahmad inspires me to reach always for the greatest heights and never to fear. Know that his story is a part of our history.}}

== Swat benefit ==
In 2009, Ahmad and his wife Samina were involved in raising money for Swat [[Internally displaced person|IDPs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830201507/http://www.desiclub.com/community/culture/culture_article.cfm?id=487|title=NYC Comes Together to Raise Funds for Swat Valley Refugees|date=30 August 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Entertainment/14-Sep-2009/Music-concert-in-aid-of-Swat-affectees-held-at-UN |title=Music concert in aid of Swat affectees held at UN |publisher=The Nation |date=14 September 2009 |accessdate=10 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202033424/http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Entertainment/14-Sep-2009/Music-concert-in-aid-of-Swat-affectees-held-at-UN |archivedate=2 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4810">'''Shamai Kedem Leibowitz''', also known as '''Samuel Shamai Leibowitz''', is an American lawyer and blogger who was convicted of leaking classified [[FBI]] information to another blogger.&lt;ref name=justice&gt;"[http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2009/December/09-nsd-1361.html Former FBI Contract Linguist Pleads Guilty to Leaking Classified Information to Blogger]." ([https://www.webcitation.org/6Htp9lIxj Archive], [https://archive.is/RrM5m Archive #2]) [[U.S. Department of Justice]]. Thursday, December 17, 2009. Retrieved on June 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leibowitz pleaded guilty on December 17, 2009, to knowingly and willfully disclosing five Secret level FBI documents in April 2009, to a blogger, who then published information derived from those documents on the blog.&lt;ref name=justice/&gt; He was sentenced on May 24, 2010 to 20 months in prison.&lt;ref name=wapo1&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Leibowitz,
&lt;blockquote&gt;During the course of my work, I came across wrongdoings that led me to conclude this is an abuse of power and a violation of the law. I reported these violations to my superiors at the FBI who did nothing about them. Thereafter, to my great regret, I disclosed the violations to a member of the media.&lt;ref name=fas1&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Leibowitz leaked the documents to blogger [[Richard Silverstein]], who writes a blog called [http://www.richardsilverstein.com Tikun Olam], which gives a left-wing perspective on [[Israel]] and [[Israeli-American relations]]. Silverstein told the ''New York Times'' that the documents were transcripts of F.B.I. [[wiretaps]] of the [[Israeli Embassy in Washington]], and that Leibowitz leaked them because of concerns about Israel's aggressive efforts to influence Congress and public opinion, and fears that Israel might strike [[nuclear facilities in Iran]].&lt;ref name=nytimes1&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aum Shinrikyo==
In 1984, Asahara formed Aum Shinsen no Kai. He changed his name from Chizuo Matsumoto to Shoko Asahara and renamed his group Aum Shinrikyo in 1987.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Metraux|first=Daniel A.|date=1995|title=Religious Terrorism in Japan: The Fatal Appeal of Aum Shinrikyo|jstor=2645835|journal=Asian Survey|volume=35|issue=12|pages=1147|doi=10.2307/2645835}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asahara applied for government registration and, although authorities were initially reluctant, after an appeal,{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government]] eventually granted it legal recognition as a religious corporation in 1989.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; 

After this, a [[monastic order]] was established, and many lay followers joined. Asahara gained credibility by appearing on TV and on magazine covers. He gradually attained a following of believers and began being invited to lecture-meeting at universities.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Asahara also wrote several religious books, including ''Beyond Life and Death'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EGbvAQAACAAJ|title=Beyond Life and Death|last=Asahara|first=Shōkō|date=1993|publisher=Aum Publishing Company|isbn=9784871420723|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Declaring Myself the Christ'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qouIAAAACAAJ|title=Declaring Myself the Christ: Disclosing the True Meanings of Jesus Christ's Gospel|last=Asahara|first=Shōkō|date=1992|publisher=Aum Publishing Company|isbn=9784871420150}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Supreme Initiation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BCxhAAAACAAJ|title=Supreme Initiation: An Empirical Spiritual Science for the Supreme Truth|last=Asahara|first=Shōkō|date=1988|publisher=AUM USA Company|isbn=9780945638001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of [[Aum Shinrikyo]] is based on the [[Vajrayana]] scriptures, the [[Bible]], and other texts. In 1992 Asahara published ''Declaring Myself the Christ'', within which he declared himself "[[Christ (title)|Christ]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Deadly Cults: The Crimes of True Believers |last=Snow |first=Robert L. |year=2003 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |isbn=978-0-275-98052-8 |page=17 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's only fully enlightened master, and identified with the "[[Lamb of God]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Re-Enchantment of the West: Alternative Spiritualities, Sacralization, Popular Culture, and Occulture|last=Partridge|first=Christopher Hugh|year=2006|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|isbn=978-0-567-04133-3|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He outlined a [[End time|doomsday prophecy]], which included a [[World War III|third World War]], and described a final conflict culminating in a [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] "[[Armageddon]]", borrowing the term from the [[Book of Revelation]] {{bibleverse-nb||Revelation|16:16}}.&lt;ref name="kaplan"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-8050-6511-4|last=Lifton|first=Robert Jay|title=Destroying the World to Save It: Aum Shinrikyo, Apocalyptic Violence, and the New Global Terrorism|date=August 1, 2000|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asahara often preached the necessity of Armageddon for "human relief". He eventually declared, "Put [[tantra]] Vajrayana into practice in accordance with the doctrines of [[Mahamudra]]," and he led a series of [[religious terrorism|terrorist attacks]] using a secret organization hidden from ordinary believers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Global Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction: A Case Study on the Aum Shinrikyo|url=http://fas.org/irp/congress/1995_rpt/aum/part03.htm|title=III.

==Tokyo subway gas attack, and arrest==
{{Main|Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway}}
On March 20, 1995, members of Aum Shinrikyo attacked the [[Tokyo subway]] with the nerve gas [[sarin]]. Thirteen people died and thousands more suffered ill effects. After finding sufficient evidence, authorities accused Aum Shinrikyo of complicity in the attack, as well as in a number of smaller-scale incidents. Dozens of disciples were arrested, Aum's facilities were raided, and the court issued an order for Asahara's arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/20/world/japan-arrests-no-2-leader-of-sect-linked-to-tokyo-attack.html|title=Japan Arrests No. 2 Leader of Sect Linked to Tokyo Attack|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|access-date=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-05-16/news/mn-2520_1_shoko-asahara|title=Japanese Guru Arrested in Fatal Subway Attack: Crime: Shoko Asahara found during raid on cult's Mt.

On May 16, 1995, the police investigated the headquarters of Aum Shinrikyo. Asahara was discovered in a very small, isolated room in one of the facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/20/tokyo-subway-sarin-attack_n_6896754.html|title=20 Years Ago, A Shadowy Cult Poisoned The Tokyo Subway|last=Alfred|first=Charlotte|date=March 20, 2015|work=Huffington Post|access-date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Wary of possible Aum military power, the [[1st Airborne Brigade (Japan)|First Airborne Brigade]] of the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force]] was stationed nearby to support the police if needed.&lt;ref name="huff"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.jp/2015/05/07/aum-20th-anniversary-mori-tatsuya_n_7230332.html|title=What is the "universality"? we should have learned from Aum Shinrikyo case after 20 years|date=May 12, 2015|author=Huffpost Society|work=The Huffington Post|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richar"&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Koshimizu|url=http://richardkoshimizu.hateblo.jp/entry/20150806/1438864297|title=TOTAL INDEX PAGE of Aum Shinrikyo case|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations, trial and execution==
Asahara faced 27 counts of murder in 13 separate [[indictment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4aQzDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT430#v=onepage&amp;q=Asahara&amp;f=false|title=Terrorism and Organized Hate Crime: Intelligence Gathering, Analysis and Investigations, Fourth Edition|last=Ronczkowski|first=Michael R.|date=September 1, 2017|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781351787123|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution argued that Asahara gave orders to attack the Tokyo Subway in order to "overthrow the government and install himself in the position of [[Emperor of Japan]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryall|first=Julian|date=January 16, 2014|title=Justice looms for doomsday cult that brought death to the Tokyo subway|page=14|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/10576071/Justice-looms-for-Doomsday-cult-that-brought-death-to-Tokyo-subway.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later, during the trial which took more than seven years to conclude, the prosecution forwarded an additional theory that the attacks were ordered to divert police attention away from Aum. The prosecution also accused Asahara of masterminding the [[Matsumoto incident]] and the [[Sakamoto family murder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2003/04/25/national/death-demanded-for-asahara/|title=Death demanded for Asahara|last=Wijers-Hasegawa|first=Yumi|date=April 25, 2003|work=The Japan Times Online|access-date=July 9, 2018|issn=0447-5763}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Asahara's defense team, a group of senior followers initiated the atrocities and kept them a secret from Asahara.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

During the trials, some of the disciples testified against Asahara, and he was found guilty on 13 of 17 charges, including the Sakamoto family murder; four charges were dropped. On February 27, 2004, he was sentenced to death by [[hanging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/05/asia/japan-aum-shinriyko-leader-executed-intl/index.html|title=Shoko Asahara: Japan doomsday cult leader executed 23 years after Tokyo sarin attack|last=CNN|first=James Griffiths and Yoko Wakatsuki|work=CNN|access-date=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was called the "trial of the century" by the Japanese media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/eafbd67c-80b0-11e8-bc55-50daf11b720d|title=Japan executes cult leader behind 1995 Tokyo subway gas attack|last=Lewis|first=Leo|last2=Inagaki|first2=Kana|date=July 5, 2018|website=Financial Times|access-date=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Asahara resigned from his position as the Aum Shinrikyo representative in an attempt to prevent the group from being forcefully dissolved by the state.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The defense [[appeal]]ed Asahara's sentencing on the grounds that he was mentally unfit, and psychiatric examinations were undertaken.

'''Tara''' ({{lang-sa|तारा}}, {{IAST|tārā}}; Tib. སྒྲོལ་མ, Dölma), '''Ārya Tārā''', or '''White Tara''', also known as '''Jetsun Dölma''' ([[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]]: ''rje btsun sgrol ma'') in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], is an important figure in [[Buddhism]]. She appears as a female [[bodhisattva]] in [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, and as a female [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] in [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism. She is known as the "mother of liberation", and represents the virtues of success in work and achievements. She is known as ''Tara Bosatsu'' (多羅菩薩) in [[Japan]], and occasionally as ''Duōluó Púsà'' (多羅菩薩) in [[Chinese Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/history/b_fbodi.htm Buddhist Deities: Bodhisattvas of Compassion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tārā is a [[yidam|meditation deity]] worshiped by practitioners of the Tibetan branch of [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism to develop certain inner qualities and to understand outer, inner and secret teachings such as [[karuṇā]] (compassion), [[mettā]] (loving-kindness), and [[shunyata]] (emptiness). Tārā may more properly be understood as different aspects of the same quality, as bodhisattvas are often considered [[metaphor]]s for Buddhist [[virtue]]s.

There is also recognition in some schools of [[Buddhism]] of ''twenty-one Tārās''. A practice text entitled ''[[Praises to the Twenty-One Taras]]'', is the most important text on Tara in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Another key text is the ''Tantra Which is the Source for All the Functions of Tara, Mother of All the Tathagatas''.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, Stephan; The Cult of Tara Magic and Ritual, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The main Tārā [[mantra]] is the same for Buddhists and Hindus alike: {{IAST|oṃ tāre tuttāre ture svāhā}}. It is pronounced by Tibetans and Buddhists who follow the [[Tibetan culture|Tibetan traditions]] as {{IAST|oṃ tāre tu tāre ture soha}}. The literal translation would be “Oṃ O Tārā, I pray O Tārā, O Swift One, So Be It!.”

==Emergence of Tārā as a Buddhist deity==
Within [[Tibetan Buddhism]] '''Tārā''' is regarded as a [[bodhisattva]] of compassion and action. She is the female aspect of [[Avalokiteśvara]] and in some origin stories she comes from his tears:

"Then at last Avalokiteshvara arrived at the summit of Marpori, the 'Red Hill', in Lhasa. Gazing out, he perceived that the lake on Otang, the 'Plain of Milk', resembled the Hell of Ceaseless Torment. Myriad beings were undergoing the agonies of boiling, burning, hunger, thirst, yet they never perished, sending forth hideous cries of anguish all the while. When Avalokiteshvara saw this, tears sprang to his eyes. A teardrop from his right eye fell to the plain and became the reverend [[Bhrikuti]], who declared: "Child of your lineage! As you are striving for the sake of sentient beings in the Land of Snows, intercede in their suffering, and I shall be your companion in this endeavour!" Bhrikuti was then reabsorbed into Avalokiteshvara's right eye, and was reborn in a later life as the Nepalese princess Tritsun. A teardrop from his left eye fell upon the plain and became the reverend Tara. She also declared, "Child of your lineage! As you are striving for the sake of sentient beings in the Land of Snows, intercede in their suffering, and I shall be your companion in this endeavor!" Tārā was then reabsorbed into Avalokiteshvara's left eye."

Tārā manifests in many different forms. In Tibet, these forms included White Tārā's manifestation as the Nepalese Princess ([[Bhrikuti]]),&lt;ref&gt;((Min Bahadur Shakya |title=The Life and Contribution of the Nepalese Princess Bhrikuti Devi to Tibetan History |year=2009 |publisher=Pilgrims Publishing})&lt;/ref&gt; and Green Tārā's manifestation as the Chinese princess Kongjo ([[Princess Wencheng]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sakyapa Sonam Gyaltsen |title=The Clear Mirror: A Traditional Account of Tibet's Golden Age |year=1996 |publisher=Snow Lion Publications |pages=64–65 |isbn=1-55939-048-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tārā is also known as a [[salvation|saviouress]], as a heavenly deity who hears the cries of beings experiencing misery in [[saṃsāra]].

Whether the Tārā figure originated as a Buddhist or Hindu goddess is unclear and remains a source of inquiry among scholars. Mallar Ghosh believes her to have originated as a form of the goddess [[Durga]] in the Hindu [[Puranas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mallar Ghosh |title=Development of Buddhist Iconography in Eastern India |year=1980 |publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal |page=17 |isbn=81-215-0208-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, she is worshiped both in Buddhism and in [[Shaktism]] as one of the ten [[Mahavidya]]s. It may be true that goddesses entered Buddhism from Shaktism (i.e. the worship of local or folk goddesses prior to the more institutionalized [[Hinduism]] which had developed by the early medieval period (i.e. [[Middle kingdoms of India]]). Possibly the oldest text to mention a Buddhist goddess is the ''[[Prajnaparamita]] Sutra'' (translated into Chinese from the original Sanskrit c. 2nd century CE), around the time that [[Mahayana]] was becoming the dominant school of thought in Indian and Chinese Buddhism.{{Dubious|date=September 2010}} Thus, it would seem that the feminine principle makes its first appearance in Buddhism as the goddess who personified prajnaparamita.&lt;ref name="beyer"&gt;{{cite book |author=Stephen Beyer |title=The Cult of Tārā: Magic and Ritual in Tibet (Hermeneutics: Studies in the History of Religions) |year=1978 |publisher=University of California Press |pages= |isbn=0-520-03635-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OM TARE TU TTARE.svg|thumb|left|&lt;div align ="center"&gt;The Mantra of Tārā&lt;br&gt;''OṀ TĀRE TUTTĀRE TURE SVAHĀ'' &lt;br&gt;in the ''Lañja'' variant of [[Ranjana alphabet|Ranjana]] and [[Tibetan alphabet]]s.&lt;/div&gt;]]

Tārā came to be seen as an expression of the compassion of perfected wisdom only later, with her earliest textual reference being the ''[[Mañjuśrī-mūla-kalpa]]'' (c. 5th–8th centuries CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Martin Willson |title=In Praise of Tārā: Songs to the Saviouress |year=1992 |publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]] |quote= | pages=40| url= |isbn=0-86171-109-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest, solidly identifiable image of Tārā is most likely that which is still found today at cave 6 within the rock-cut Buddhist monastic complex of the [[Ellora Caves]] in [[Maharashtra]] (c. 7th century CE), with her worship being well established by the onset of the [[Pala Empire]] in [[Eastern India]] (8th century CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mallar Ghosh |title=Development of Buddhist Iconography in Eastern India |year=1980 |publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal |page=6 |isbn=81-215-0208-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tārā became a very popular [[Vajrayana]] deity with the rise of Tantra in 8th-century Pala and, with the movement of Indian Buddhism into Tibet through [[Padmasambhava]], the worship and practices of Tārā became incorporated into Tibetan Buddhism as well.&lt;ref name="beyer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Khenchen Palden Sharab |author2=Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal  |title=Tara's Enlightened Activity: Commentary on the Praises to the Twenty-one Taras |year=2007 |publisher=[[Snow Lion Publications]] |page=13 |isbn=1-55939-287-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She eventually came to be considered the "Mother of all Buddhas," which usually refers to the enlightened wisdom of the Buddhas, while simultaneously echoing the ancient concept of the [[Mother Goddess]] in India.

Independent of whether she is classified as a deity, a Buddha, or a bodhisattva, Tārā remains very popular in [[Tibet]] (and Tibetan communities in exile in Northern India), [[Mongolia]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], and is worshiped in a majority of Buddhist communities throughout the world (see also [[Guanyin]], the female aspect of Avalokitesvara in Chinese Buddhism).

Today, Green Tara and White Tara are probably the most popular representations of Tara. Green Tara (''Khadiravani'') is usually associated with protection from fear and the following eight obs-curation: lions (= pride), wild elephants (= delusion/ignorance), fires (= hatred and anger), snakes (= jealousy), bandits and thieves (= wrong views, including fanatical views), bondage (= avarice and miserliness), floods (= desire and attachment), and evil spirits and demons (= deluded doubts). As one of the three deities of long life, White Tara (''Saraswati'') is associated with longevity. White Tara counteracts illness and thereby helps to bring about a long life. She embodies the motivation that is compassion and is said to be as white and radiant as the moon.

==Origin as a Buddhist bodhisattva==
Tārā has many stories told which explain her origin as a [[bodhisattva]]. 
[[File:Green Tara 8th century 60.138.jpg|thumbnail|left|Green Tara, 8th century. This very early image shows her in a persona known as Syamatara, or Green Tara, who is said to protect her followers from danger. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
[[File:Tara-british.museum.jpg|thumb|right|[[Statue of Tara]], Sri Lanka, 7th - 8th century]]
In this tale there is a young [[princess]] who lives in a different world system, millions of years in the past. Her name is Yeshe Dawa, which means "Moon of [[:wikt:primordial|Primordial]] Awareness". For quite a number of [[aeon]]s she makes offerings to the Buddha of that world system, whose name was Tonyo Drupa. She receives special instruction from him concerning [[bodhicitta]] - the infinitely compassionate mental state of a bodhisattva. After doing this, some monks approach her and suggest that because of her level of attainment she should next pray to be reborn as a male to progress further. At this point she lets the monks know in no uncertain terms that it is only "weak minded worldlings" who see gender as a barrier to attaining [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]]. She sadly notes there have been few who wish to work for the welfare of sentient beings in a female form, though. Therefore, she resolves to always be reborn as a female bodhisattva, until [[samsara (Buddhism)|samsara]] is no more. She then stays in a palace in a state of [[meditation]] for some ten million years, and the power of this practice releases tens of millions of beings from suffering. As a result of this, Tonyo Drupa tells her she will henceforth manifest supreme [[bodhi]] as the Goddess Tārā in many world systems to come.

With this story in mind, it is interesting to juxtapose this with a quotation from the [[14th Dalai Lama]] about Tārā, spoken at a conference on Compassionate Action in Newport Beach, CA in 1989:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a true feminist movement in Buddhism that relates to the goddess Tārā. Following her cultivation of [[bodhicitta]], the bodhisattva's motivation, she looked upon the situation of those striving towards full awakening and she felt that there were too few people who attained [[Buddhahood]] as women. So she vowed, "I have developed bodhicitta as a woman. For all my lifetimes along the path I vow to be born as a woman, and in my final lifetime when I attain Buddhahood, then, too, I will be a woman."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tārā, then, embodies certain ideals which make her attractive to women practitioners, and her emergence as a Bodhisattva can be seen as a part of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism's reaching out to women, and becoming more inclusive even in 6th-century CE [[India]].

==Symbols and Associations==
[[File:Green tara 1947 wk.jpg|upright|thumb|Painting of Buddhist goddess Green Tara by Prithvi Man Chitrakari done in 1947.]]
Tārā's name literally means "star" or "planet", and therefore she is associated with navigation and travel both literally and metaphorically as spiritual crossing to the 'other side' of the ocean of existence (enlightenment).&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 310&lt;/ref&gt; Hence she is known literally as "she who saves" in Tibetan.&lt;ref&gt;Purna, Dharmachari; Tara: Her Origins and Development, http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol2/tara_origins_a_development.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''108 Names of the Holy Tara'', Tara is 'Leader of the caravans ..... who showeth the way to those who have lost it' and she is named as ''Dhruva'', the Sanskrit name for the [[North Star]].&lt;ref&gt;Purna, Dharmachari; Tara: Her Origins and Development, http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol2/tara_origins_a_development.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Miranda Shaw, "[[Motherhood]] is central to the conception of Tara".&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 316&lt;/ref&gt; Her titles include "loving mother", "supreme mother", "mother of the world",  "universal mother" and "mother of all Buddhas".&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 316-317&lt;/ref&gt;

She is most often shown with the blue lotus or night lotus (''utpala''), which releases its fragrance with the appearance of the moon and therefore Tārā is also associated with the moon and night.&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Robert; The Handbook of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols, page 170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Purna, Dharmachari; Tara: Her Origins and Development, http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol2/tara_origins_a_development.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tārā is also a forest goddess, particularly in her form as ''Khadiravani'', "dweller in the Khadira forest" and is generally associated with plant life, flowers, acacia (khadira) trees and the wind. Because of her association with nature and plants, Tārā is also known as a healing goddess (especially as White Tārā) and as a goddess of nurturing quality and fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 324&lt;/ref&gt; Her pure land in Mount Potala is described as "Covered with manifold trees and creepers, resounding with the sound of many birds, And with murmur of waterfalls, thronged with wild beasts of many kinds; Many species of flowers grow everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;Edward Conze, Buddhist Texts Through the Ages, p.196.&lt;/ref&gt; Her association with the wind element (vaayu) also means that she is swift in responding to calls for any aid.

==Tārā as a saviouress==
[[File:GreenTara150.jpg|upright|thumb|Green Tara, [[Nepal]], 14th century. Gilt copper inset with precious and semiprecious stones, H20.25 in, (51.4 cm). [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]], Louis V. Bell Fund, 1966, 66.179.]]

Tārā also embodies many of the qualities of feminine principle. She is known as the Mother of Mercy and Compassion. She is the source, the female aspect of the universe, which gives birth to warmth, compassion and relief from bad karma as experienced by ordinary beings in cyclic existence. She engenders, nourishes, smiles at the vitality of creation, and has sympathy for all beings as a mother does for her children. As Green Tārā she offers succor and protection from all the unfortunate circumstances one can encounter within the samsaric world. As White Tārā she expresses maternal compassion and offers healing to beings who are hurt or wounded, either mentally or psychically. As Red Tārā she teaches discriminating awareness about created phenomena, and how to turn raw desire into compassion and love. As Blue Tārā ([[Ekajati]]) she becomes a protector in the [[Nyingma]] lineage, who expresses a ferocious, wrathful, female energy whose invocation destroys all Dharmic obstacles and engenders good luck and swift spiritual awakening.&lt;ref name="beyer"/&gt;

Within [[Tibetan Buddhism]], she has 21 major forms in all, each tied to a certain color and energy. And each offers some feminine attribute, of ultimate benefit to the spiritual aspirant who asks for her assistance.

Another quality of feminine principle which she shares with the [[dakini]]s is playfulness. As [[John Blofeld]] expands upon in ''Bodhisattva of Compassion'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[John Blofeld]] |title=Bodhisattva of Compassion: The Mystical Tradition of Kuan Yin |year=2009 |publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]] |quote= | url= |isbn=1-59030-735-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tārā is frequently depicted as a young sixteen-year-old girlish woman. She often manifests in the lives of [[dharma]] practitioners when they take themselves, or the spiritual path too seriously. There are Tibetan tales in which she laughs at self-righteousness, or plays pranks on those who lack reverence for the feminine. In ''Magic Dance: The Display of the Self-Nature of the Five Wisdom Dakinis'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thinley Norbu |title=Magic Dance: The Display of the Self-Nature of the Five Wisdom Dakinis |year=1999 |publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]] |isbn=0-87773-885-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinley Norbu explores this as "Playmind". Applied to Tārā one could say that her playful mind can relieve ordinary minds which become rigidly serious or tightly gripped by dualistic distinctions. She takes delight in an open mind and a receptive heart then. For in this openness and receptivity her blessings can naturally unfold and her energies can quicken the aspirants spiritual development.

These qualities of feminine principle then, found an expression in Indian [[Mahayana]] Buddhism and the emerging [[Vajrayana]] of Tibet, as the many forms of Tārā, as dakinis, as [[Prajnaparamita]], and as many other local and specialized feminine divinities. As the worship of Tārā developed, various prayers, chants and mantras became associated with her. These came out of a felt devotional need, and from her inspiration causing spiritual masters to compose and set down [[sadhana]]s, or tantric meditation practices. Two ways of approach to her began to emerge. In one common folk and lay practitioners would simply directly appeal to her to ease some of the travails of worldly life. In the second, she became a [[Tantra|Tantric]] deity whose practice would be used by monks or tantric yogis in order to develop her qualities in themselves, ultimately leading through her to the source of her qualities, which are [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|Enlightenment]], Enlightened Compassion, and Enlightened Mind.

==Tārā as a Tantric deity==
[[File:Tara thangka.jpg|thumb|right|18th-century Eastern [[Tibet]]an [[thanka]], with the Green Tara (Samaya Tara Yogini) in the center and the Blue, Red, White and Yellow taras in the corners, [[Rubin Museum of Art]]]]

Tārā as a focus for tantric deity [[yoga]] can be traced back to the time period of [[Padmasambhava]]. There is a Red Tārā practice which was given by Padmasambhava to [[Yeshe Tsogyal]]. He asked that she [[terton|hide it as a treasure]]. It was not until the 20th century, that a great Nyingma lama, Apong Terton rediscovered it. It is said that this lama was reborn as [[Sakya Trizin]], present head of the [[Sakyapa]] sect. A monk who had known Apong Terton succeeded in retransmitting it to Sakya Trizin, and the same monk also gave it to [[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]], who released it to his western students.

Martin Willson in ''In Praise of Tārā'' traces many different lineages of Tārā Tantras, that is Tārā scriptures used as Tantric sadhanas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Martin Willson |title=In Praise of Tārā: Songs to the Saviouress |year=1992 |publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]] |quote= | pages=| url= |isbn=0-86171-109-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a Tārā sadhana was revealed to [[Tilopa]] (988–1069 CE), the human father of the [[Karma Kagyu]]. [[Atisa]], the great translator and founder of the [[Kadampa]] school of Tibetan Buddhism, was a devotee of Tārā. He composed a praise to her, and three Tārā Sadhanas. Martin Willson's work also contains charts which show origins of her tantras in various lineages, but suffice to say that Tārā as a tantric practice quickly spread from around the 7th century CE onwards, and remains an important part of Vajrayana Buddhism to this day.

The practices themselves usually present Tārā as a tutelary deity (thug dam, [[yidam]]) which the practitioners sees as being a latent aspect of one's mind, or a manifestation in a visible form of a quality stemming from [[Jnana|Buddha Jnana]]. As John Blofeld puts it in ''The Tantric Mysticism of Tibet'':

{{quote|The function of the Yidam is one of the profound mysteries of the Vajrayana...Especially during the first years of practice the Yidam is of immense importance. Yidam is the Tibetan rendering of the Sanskrit word "Iṣṭadeva"—the in-dwelling deity; but, where the Hindus take the Iṣṭadeva for an actual deity who has been invited to dwell in the devotee's heart, the Yidams of Tantric Buddhism are in fact the emanations of the adepts own mind. Or are they? To some extent they seem to belong to that order of phenomena which in Jungian terms are called archetypes and are therefore the common property of the entire human race. Even among Tantric Buddhists, there may be a division of opinion as to how far the Yidams are the creations of individual minds. What is quite certain is that they are not independently existing gods and goddesses; and yet, paradoxically, there are many occasions when they must be so regarded.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[John Blofeld]] |title=The Tantric Mysticism of Tibet: A Practical Guide to the Theory, Purpose, and Techniques of Tantric Meditation |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin |page=176 |isbn=0-14-019336-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are many forms of Tārā, including various popular lists of 21 different emanations of Tārā. Green Tārā, (śyāmatārā) associated with peacefulness and enlightened activity is the most depicted and the central aspect of Tārā from which others such as the 21 Tārās emanate. In her Green form, she is often also known as Khadiravaṇi-Tārā (Tārā of the acacia forest), who appeared to [[Nagarjuna]] in the Khadiravani forest of [[South India]] and protects from the eight great fears. She is often accompanied by her two attendants Mārīcī and Ekajaṭā. Dharmachari Purna writes on the various forms of Tara:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tārā is in fact the name of a whole class of deities. She appears in all the five colours of the Jinas. There are at least ten green forms, seven white, five yellow, two blue and one red. As Sarvajñamitra says of her form: 'It is a universal form, varied like crystal, since it changes according to circumstance'.She has both peaceful and wrathful forms. Her figure is shown in virtually all postures from standing to sitting, full lotus, half lotus, one leg down, and both legs down. There is apparently also a reclining Tārā. She has two-armed forms, four arms, eight arms, twelve arms, and Getty even mentions a Tibetan painting showing a standing Tārā with 'one thousand heads and arms'. Ghosh lists seventy-six distinct forms of Tārā, and tradition tells us there are one hundred and eight names for her.&lt;ref&gt;Purna, Dharmachari; Tara: Her Origins and Development, http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol2/tara_origins_a_development.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Sarvajnamitra she has a “universal form” (''visva-rupa''), that encompasses all living beings and deities, and which changes with the needs of each being.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist Goddesses of India, page 337&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of Tārā include:

*White Tārā, (Sitatārā) with two arms seated on a white lotus and with eyes on her hand and feet, as well as a third eye on her forehead (thus she is also known as "Seven eyed"). She is known for compassion, long life, healing and serenity.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist Goddesses of India, page 333&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as The Wish-fulfilling Wheel, or Cintachakra.
*Pravīratārā, "Tārā Swift and Heroic", a Red colored form with eight arms holding bell and vajra, bow and arrow, wheel, conch, sword and noose.
*[[Kurukullā]] (Rikchema) of red color and fierce aspect associated with magnetizing all good things
*Black Tārā (Ugra Tārā), associated with power
*Various forms of Yellow or Golden colored Tārās, sometimes associated with wealth and [[prosperity]] including "Yellow Cintamani Tārā" (“Wish-Granting Gem Tara”) holding a wish granting jewel, eight armed "Vajra Tārā" and golden "Rajasri Tārā" holding a blue lotus.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist Goddesses of India, page 339&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ekajati|Blue Tārā]] (Ekajati), wrathful with many heads and arms, associated with transmutation of anger
*Cintāmaṇi Tārā, a form of Tārā widely practiced at the level of [[Anuttarayoga Tantra|Highest Yoga Tantra]] in the [[Gelug]] School of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], portrayed as green and often conflated with Green Tārā
*[[Sarasvati]] (Yangchenma), known for the arts, knowledge and wisdom
*Bhṛkuṭītārā (Tronyer Chendze), "Tārā with a Frown", known for protection from spirits
*Uṣṇīṣavijaya Tārā, White Tārā named "Victorious Uṣṇīṣa" with three faces and twelve arms, associated with long life
*Golden Prasanna Tārā - wrathful form, with a necklace of bloody heads and sixteen arms holding an array of weapons and Tantric attributes.
*[[Yeshe Tsogyal]] ("Wisdom Lake Queen"), the consort of [[Padmasambhava]] who brought Buddhism to Tibet, was known as an emanation of Tārā
*Rigjay Lhamo, “Goddess Who Brings Forth Awareness,” seated in royal posture surrounded by rainbow light. 
*[[Sitatapatra]] Tārā, protector against supernatural danger

Tārā's iconography such as the lotus also shows resemblance with the Hindu goddess [[Lakshmi]], and at least one Tibetan liturgy evokes Lakshmi as Tārā.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 332&lt;/ref&gt; According to Miranda Shaw, there is a later trend of Tārā theology that began to see all other female divinities as aspects of Tārā or at least associated with her. Apart from her many emanations named Tārā of varying colors, other Mahayana female divinities that became part of Tara's theology include [[Janguli]], [[Parnasabari]], Cunda, [[Kurukulla]], [[Mahamayuri]], [[Usnisavijaya]], and [[Marici (Buddhism)|Marici]]. Based on this principle of Tārā as the central female divinity, [[Dakinis]] were also seen as emanations of her.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Miranda; Buddhist goddesses of India, page 341&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sadhanas of Tārā==
[[Sadhana]]s in which Tārā is the [[yidam]] (meditational deity) can be extensive or quite brief. Most all of them include some introductory praises or homages to invoke her presence and prayers of taking refuge. Then her [[mantra]] is recited, followed by a visualization of her, perhaps more mantra, then the visualization is dissolved, followed by a dedication of the merit from doing the practice. Additionally there may be extra prayers of aspirations, and a long life prayer for the Lama who originated the practice. Many of the Tārā sadhanas are seen as beginning practices within the world of [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], however what is taking place during the visualization of the deity actually invokes some of the most sublime teachings of all Buddhism. Two examples are Zabtik Drolchok&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Zabtik_Drolchok&lt;/ref&gt; and Chime Pakme Nyingtik.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Chim%C3%A9_Phakm%C3%A9_Nyingtik&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case during the creation phase of Tārā as a yidam, she is seen as having as much reality as any other phenomena apprehended through the mind. By reciting her mantra and visualizing her form in front, or on the head of the adept, one is opening to her energies of compassion and wisdom. After a period of time the practitioner shares in some of these qualities, becomes imbued with her being and all it represents. At the same time all of this is seen as coming out of Emptiness and having a translucent quality like a rainbow. Then many times there is a visualization of oneself as Tārā. One simultaneously becomes inseparable from all her good qualities while at the same time realizing the emptiness of the visualization of oneself as the [[yidam]] and also the emptiness of one's ordinary self.

This occurs in the completion stage of the practice. One dissolves the created deity form and at the same time also realizes how much of what we call the "self" is a creation of the mind, and has no long term substantial inherent existence. This part of the practice then is preparing the practitioner to be able to confront the dissolution of one's self at death and ultimately be able to approach through various stages of meditation upon emptiness, the realization of Ultimate Truth as a vast display of [[Emptiness]] and Luminosity. At the same time the recitation of the mantra has been invoking Tārā's energy through its [[Sanskrit]] seed syllables and this purifies and activates certain psychic centers of the body ([[chakras]]). This also untangles knots of psychic energy which have hindered the practitioner from developing a Vajra body, which is necessary to be able to progress to more advanced practices and deeper stages of realization.

Therefore, even in a simple Tārā [[sadhana]] a plethora of outer, inner, and secret events is taking place and there are now many works such as ''Deity Yoga'', compiled by the present Dalai Lama,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] |title=Deity Yoga: In Action and Performance Tantra |year=1987 |publisher=[[Snow Lion Publications]] |quote= | url= |isbn=0-937938-50-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which explores all the ramifications of working with a [[yidam]] in Tantric practices.

The end results of doing such Tārā practices are many. For one thing it reduces the forces of delusion in the forms of negative karma, sickness, afflictions of [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|kleshas]], and other obstacles and obscurations.

The mantra helps generate Bodhicitta within the heart of the practitioner and purifies the psychic channels ([[nadis]]) within the body allowing a more natural expression of generosity and compassion to flow from the heart center. Through experiencing Tārā's perfected form one acknowledges one's own perfected form, that is one's intrinsic Buddha nature, which is usually covered over by obscurations and clinging to dualistic [[phenomena]] as being inherently real and permanent.

The practice then weans one away from a coarse understanding of Reality, allowing one to get in touch with inner qualities similar to those of a bodhisattva, and prepares one's inner self to embrace finer spiritual energies, which can lead to more subtle and profound realizations of the Emptiness of phenomena and self.

As [[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]], in his ''Introduction to the Red Tārā Sadhana'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]] |title=Red Tara Commentary: Instructions for the Concise Practice Known as Red Tara—An Open Door to Bliss |year=1998 |publisher=Padma Publishing |quote= | url= |isbn=1-881847-04-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; notes of his lineage: "Tārā is the flawless expression of the inseparability of emptiness, awareness and compassion. Just as you use a mirror to see your face, Tārā [[meditation]] is a means of seeing the true face of your mind, devoid of any trace of delusion".

There are several preparations to be done before practising the Sadhana. To perform a correct execution the practitioner must be prepared and take on the proper disposition. The preparations may be grouped as "internal" and "external". Both are necessary to achieve the required concentration.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The preparations are of two types: external and internal. The external preparations consist of cleaning the meditation room, setting up a shrine with images of Buddha Shakyamuni and Green Tara, and setting out a beautiful arrangement of offerings.  We can use water to represent nectar for drinking, water for bathing the feet, and perfume. For the remaining offerings—flowers, incense, light, and pure food—if possible we should set out the actual substances. As for internal preparations, we should try to improve our compassion, bodhichitta, and correct view of emptiness through the practice of the stages of the path, and to receive a Tantric empowerment of Green Tara. It is possible to participate in group pujas if we have not yet received an empowerment, but to gain deep experience of this practice we need to receive an empowerment. The main internal preparation is to generate and strengthen our faith in Arya Tara, regarding her as the synthesis of all Gurus, Yidams, and Buddhas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gadenforthewest.org/sadhanas/Concise%20GreenTara06.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905093605/http://gadenforthewest.org/sadhanas/Concise%20GreenTara06.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Terma teachings related to Tārā==
[[Terma (Buddhism)|Terma]] teachings are "hidden teachings" said to have been left by [[Padmasambhava]] (8th century) and others for the benefit of future generations. [[Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo]] discovered [[Phagme Nyingthig]] (Tib. spelling: 'chi med 'phags ma'i snying thig, Innermost Essence teachings of the Immortal Bodhisattva &lt;nowiki&gt;[Arya Tārā]&lt;/nowiki&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tulku Thondup |title=Masters of Meditation and Miracles: Lives of the Great Buddhist Masters of India and Tibet  |year=1999 |publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]] |quote= | pages=218| url= |isbn=1-57062-509-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in the 19th century, according to a biography,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.cthome.net/tibetanbuddhism/pemadudulbioto51702.htm Biography of Pema Dudul]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nyala Pema Dündul]] received a Hidden Treasure, Tārā Teaching and Nyingthig (Tib. nying thig) from his uncle Kunsang Dudjom (Tib. kun bzang bdud 'joms). It is not clear from the source whether the [[Terma (Buddhism)|terma]] teaching and the [[nyingthig]] teachings refer to the same text or two different texts.

==History==
[[Image:Little Grill Collective.jpg|left|150px|Little Grill Collective in Harrisonburg, Virginia.]]
The Hackensaw Boys were founded in the Fall of 1999&lt;ref name="fredericksburg.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cameron|first1=Matt|title=Charlottesville-Based Band With Wide Following Draws on Diverse Influences: Hackensaw Boys Transcend Genres|url=http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2007/042007/04052007/272366|publisher=FREE LANCE-STAR|date=5 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Rob Bullington, [[Tom Peloso]], David Sickmen, and Robert "Bobby" St. Ours who were all living in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] at the time. Sickmen and Bullington met in [[Harrisonburg, Virginia]] in the early 1990s when the latter was attending [[James Madison University]] there. Bullington was playing in a band called Fried Moose,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://cpg.stparchive.com/Archive/CPG/CPG12081995p40.php Fried Moose on the menu at Sir Guy's Dec. 8]" by Kristen Seal, Cape Gazette; December 8, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-yearbook.com/yearbooks/James_Madison_University_Bluestone_Yearbook/1994/Page_51.html James Madison University - Bluestone / Schoolmaam Yearbook (Harrisonburg, VA) - Class of 1994] e-Yearbook.com.&lt;/ref&gt; while Sickmen was in a group called Pieboy with Ward Harrison (who would later join Hackensaw).Peloso formed a band with some friends in the same decade called Chigger, singing lead and playing the "[[Double bass|doghouse bass]]". All had performed as young musicians on the [[open mic]] stage at the [[Little Grill Collective|Little Grill diner]] in Harrisonburg, as well.&lt;ref name="Americana Rhythm Music Magazine"&gt;[http://www.americanarhythm.com/Americana_Rhythm.html Americana Rhythm Music Magazine] "American Roots from the Soul" by Greg Tutwiler May/June 2009 issue.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before starting The Hackensaw Boys, Sickmen and Peloso had been talking about other possible music projects.&lt;ref name="archives.nodepression.com"&gt;"[http://archives.nodepression.com/2002/11/simple-is-as-simple-does/ Hackensaw Boys: Simple is as simple does] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830064746/http://archives.nodepression.com/2002/11/simple-is-as-simple-does/ |date=2011-08-30 }}" Charlottesville, VA--by Paige La Grone Babcock, No Depression; Town and Country - Shorter Artist Feature from Issue No.&amp;nbsp;42 Nov-Dec 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The four founding members decided to form an [[old-time music]] group — infused with the energy and spirit of [[punk rock]] — while attending an early performance of [[Old Crow Medicine Show]] at the much-storied Miller's Restaurant in Charlottesville.&lt;ref name="archives.nodepression.com" /&gt;

===Touring===

{{Quote|We'd been around the country once on our own and then Cake picked us up for a tour after we opened up for them. And then that sort of spawned them picking us up for that package tour . . it sort of thrust us into the world of big arena touring. So we were like, 'This is easy! We can do this.'

The group took part in the [[Unlimited Sunshine Tour]] the first two years.

At the height of their popularity they have played venues in major music towns like Seattle, [[Asheville]], San Francisco, Minneapolis, [[Knoxville]], New York, Portland, Baltimore, Atlanta, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Although, more recently the band has been relegated to clubs and bars in small markets, often struggling to draw more than a sparse crowd.

===Nicknames===

They came up with nicknames for each other because it seemed all of the old country and blues performers had them.  This became a big part of their act.  Original members included Robert "Mahlon" Bullington (1999–2011), Thomas "Pee Paw" Peloso (1999–2004), David "Shiner" Sickmen (1999–2005; rejoined 2012), and Robert "Uncle Blind Bobby" St. Ours (1999–2003).  Phillip "Jigsaw" St. Ours played [[washboard (musical instrument)|washboard]] in both Hackensaw and Old Crow early on (1999–2001), and then for Hackensaw in (2008).  Other early members included Jesse "Baby J." Fiske (1999–2011), Phil "Slate Hill Phil" Gianniny (1999–2001; d. 2006),&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.readthehook.com/77299/musician-8216slate-hill-phil8217-dies Musician ‘Slate Hill Phil’ dies]" by Hawes Spencer, The Hook; December 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hogwallerramblers.com/phil/ Mr. Slate Hill Phil of Scottsville, Virginia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210175206/http://hogwallerramblers.com/phil/ |date=2012-02-10 }} Hogwaller Ramblers official site.&lt;/ref&gt; and Jimmy "Kooky-Eyed Fox" Stelling (1999–2007).  Others to join the ever-evolving group have included Chris "Sawzall" Johnson (1999–2001), Justin "Salvage" Neuhardt (1999–2010), David "Bellows Lugusi" Goldstein (1999–2004), Charlie "C.B."

===Band name===

The Hackensaw Boys derived their name "from the actions you perform on a mandolin (hack) and a fiddle (saw)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.365bandsin365days.com/2012/01/day-13-hackensaw-boys.html 365 Bands in 365 Days] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716155023/http://www.365bandsin365days.com/2012/01/day-13-hackensaw-boys.html |date=2012-07-16 }} The Hackensaw Boys; posted January 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Says Bullington "it was one of those jokes that sort of sticks . . and after about a week and you've played six or seven shows during the course of that week, you have no choice but to keep the name."&lt;ref name="Making Their Own Kind of Music"/&gt;

[[Image:Moyse and Sickmen of The Hackensaw Boys at New World Brewery.jpg|left|200px|Ferd Lionel "Four" Moyse, IV on fiddle and David Sickmen on guitar at New World Brewery, Ybor City, Tampa, Florida on January 26, 2012.]]

==Recordings==

The first two Hackensaw Boys albums were released by the Valley Entertainment label: ''Get Some'' in 2000 and ''Keep It Simple'' in 2002. The releases proved to have limited commercial appeal.

{{quote|Our guitar player wrote 'Keep It Simple'; there's been some times where things seem to get so complicated with this whole thing. He wrote this song and played it over the phone, left a message, kinda sayin', 'Let's not forget where we came from, let's remember to keep it simple and not let things get away from us.'&lt;ref name="archives.nodepression.com"/&gt;|Tom Peloso, ''former member''}}

"''Keep It Simple'', is packed with vigorous, pitchy bursts" notes [[Amanda Petrusich]] in her [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] review, noting the album "doesn't perfectly reflect the band's fast-and-fierce live show . .

{{quote|. . but it offers a solid glimpse of their proclivity for catchy melodies, classic harmonizing, and stringy noodling. Somehow, the band infuses their grassy tornado with brazen punk attitude and catchy pop structure, while simultaneously remaining vehemently sincere; tracks like "Dance Around" feature prototypically bluegrassian lyrics ("Dancin' with the girls/ That's a mighty fine thing/ You ain't gotta buy no wedding ring") without mocking the traditions from which they came.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3699-keep-it-simple/ Hackensaw Boys: Keep It Simple]" Hackensaw Boys; 2003--review by Amanda Petrusich, Pitchfork; May 28, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Get Some'' was recorded by Rhoderick Cole in his Charlottesville mansion.  ''Keep It Simple'' was recorded in Sickmen's apartment in Charlottesville's Linen Building, also by Cole who did the sound engineering on both recordings. ''Give It Back'', released in 2004, was self-produced.

The group signed with the music label [[Nettwerk]] for the 2005 release of "Love What You Do". Their second release for Nettwerk Records, ''Look Out!'' in 2007, was a "celebratory but defiant sound culled from old-time mountains, backstage doorways and punishing drives through the evolving American landscape" according to [[Isthmus (newspaper)|Isthmus/The Daily Page]].

{{quote|In many ways (Look Out!) is a return to classic Hackensaw form, the punk-amped, old time foot-stompers and ragged harmonies that gained the band its reputation in the live setting when it formed seven years ago. One of the best additions is fiddler Ferd Moyse, who tears through the opening 'Look Out Dog, Slow Down Train!' with blazing fury.|[[The Daily Progress]]}}

Another reviewer concurred, stating the album "is the Boys at their best, a perfect medium between their raw early years and the more polished sound of their previous release."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://jaredmorningstar.blogspot.com/2007/07/cd-review-hackensaw-boys-look-out.html CD REVIEW: The Hackensaw Boys ''Look Out'']" ''The Hank in Chains Review'' Thursday, July 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Bullington states ''Look Out!'' "was definitely an attempt to capture sonically and as beautifully as possible, the sound of the Hackensaws onstage." The group went into the studio "with the defined intention of . . trying to capture the live performance as best as we possibly could. And I think we totally succeeded in doing that."&lt;ref name="recoilmag.com"/&gt;  The album "got to No.&amp;nbsp;6 on the Americana music charts" and "contained nine originals including a couple from the sometimes Modest Mouse, sometimes Hackensaw Tom Peloso."&lt;ref name="herald-dispatch.com"&gt;"[http://www.herald-dispatch.com/life/x698791441/Broken-pelvis-wont-stop-the-Hackensaw-Boys Broken pelvis won't stop the Hackensaw Boys]" by Dave Lavender, The Herald-Dispatch; December 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box
| quote = Before string bands were a "thing" in popular culture, there was the Hackensaw Boys. Before The Avett Brothers were selling out arenas, before Mumford &amp; Sons were becoming the biggest band in music in a given year, before everybody and their brother was growing a beard and wearing suspenders and playing in jug bands, the Hackensaw Boys were mixing bluegrass and old time music with a punk attitude, and reshaping what a modern old school string band could sound like.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.savingcountrymusic.com/album-review-charismo-by-the-hackensaw-boys/|title=Album Review – "Charismo" by The Hackensaw Boys|work=Saving Country Music|access-date=2017-06-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the release of ''Love What You Do'' and ''Look Out!'', The Hackensaws departed from Nettwerk Records to release two independently produced six-song [[Extended play|EP]]s, ''The Old Sound of Music, Vol. 1'' and ''The Old Sound of Music, Vol. 2''  These two collections are "recommended for anyone who feels that time, popularity and (maybe) Don Was has watered down Old Crow Medicine Show, The Hackensaw Boys bring the Appalachian string band roots with punk rock flowers hard and raw."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://ninebullets.net/archives/the-hackensaw-boys-the-old-sound-of-music-vol-1 THE HACKENSAW BOYS – THE OLD SOUND OF MUSIC VOL. 1]" in 9b; February 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The albums resulted from recording sessions held at the Sound of Music studios in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. They were mastered by [[Grammy]] award winner Charlie Pilzer. As with ''Look Out!'' in 2007, all songs were engineered by Bryan Hoffa, archival audio restoration specialist at the [[Library of Congress]]. The titles, bestowed by Ferd Lionel Moyse IV were inspired by the fact that these were the last two recording projects to come out of the old Sound Of Music facility, which has recently moved to a new building in Richmond.

=== ''Charismo'' (2016) ===
The group released ''Charismo'' through Free Dirt Records in 2016, after almost a decade without putting together a studio album. Larry Campbell produced. Glide Magazine said of the album that the group take "a tack similar to that of Old Crow Medicine Show, the [[Punk Brothers]], [[The Howlin' Brothers]] and other modern outfits that draw from the past to make an impression in the present." They went on to say that theirs is "a sound once heard on back porches throughout the heartland, now brought to life with the stirring enthusiasm of would-be rock stars performing for appreciative audiences."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://glidemagazine.com/159799/hackensaw-boys-keep-fiddles-banjos-high-harmonies-potent-charismo-album-review/|title=Hackensaw Boys Keep Fiddles, Banjos &amp; High Harmonies Potent on 'Charismo' (ALBUM REVIEW) - Glide Magazine|date=2016-04-22|work=Glide Magazine|access-date=2017-06-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=. . when we were making this record, we realized that the only true constant in this band from the very first tour on to the present day has been the charismo. So that is what we named the new record, because it personifies our work ethic. It's like -- you have to put something together, then try to maintain it, find new players for it. You know, its like holding something together that looks like it could fall apart, and that is what this band has been about.&lt;ref name="Brexit" /&gt;}}

==Charismo (the instrument)==

[[Image:Charismo player The Hackensaw Boys.jpg|right|200px|Brian Gorby on charismo with The Hackensaw Boys, Legacy Credit Union Stage--Birmingham, Alabama June 15, 2008.]]

A distinctive aspect of the Hackensaw live-performance experience is the percussion instrument known as a "charismo".  Invented and played by former band member Justin "Salvage" Neuhardt, who also performed on [[Spoon (musical instrument)|spoons]] and the [[musical saw]], it is described as "a home-made tin can contraption."&lt;ref name="The Hackensaw Boys"/&gt; As founder Sickmen remembers it:

{{quote|Just before we went out on a 6-week tour, Justin came to us and said, "I can't come on tour for 6 weeks JUST playing the spoons," but at the time we didn't want a drummer with a full kit, so I said to him, "Why don't you just make something up?" So he did! He came back with the very first Charismo, which he'd made out of tin cans, hub caps, and general scrap he'd found around the diner. It was pretty primitive, but when he hit it with those metal brushes and I heard that train sound, I knew it was what we wanted."&lt;ref name="Brexit" /&gt;}}

Calvin James Pynn of The Tartan ([[Radford University]]) states "Neuhardt's charismo" is the "most notable" of the group's instruments:

{{quote|. . a homemade [[percussion]] instrument made from tin cans, license plates, a hubcap, and book bag straps, and then mercilessly beat with wire-brush sticks. While [[old-time music]] is generally marked by its strict absence of percussion, the charismo has an almost symbolic presence in The Hackensaw Boys' music and live shows, and is an irreplaceable aspect of their sound.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.rutartan.com/wordpress/?p=2451 Foot-stomping Bluegrass for younger generation]" by Calvin James Pynn, The Tartan; October 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an interview with [[Scott Simon]] of [[N.P.R.]] Neuhardt himself explains how it came to be:

{{quote|Q: Salvage . . now you say you play a pile of junk? 

A: That's right.  

Q: We're looking at your instrument now has . . like, half a dozen tin cans, a punctured aerosol can . . 

A: A coconut milk can, tea can, breath mints, bike bells . . 

Q: Hubcap is that? 

A: Hubcap, yep, found on the border of Colorado. Most of it has just come from where ever we've been, and various recycling centers around the United States. 

Q: So you keep adding to your instrument? 

A: Well, I, uh, usually just make 'em and break 'em, and then make a new one. It's kind of ever-evolving, sort of ever-changing.&lt;ref name="Making Their Own Kind of Music"/&gt;}}

Brian Gorby, Neuhardt's friend and former bandmate in the percussion-heavy jam-band Humble Sacrifice, has carried on the charismo's tradition in the Hackensaw Boys as their touring percussionist. With funk influences, Gorby uses the charismo to bring a rambunctious flair to the band's old-time style.

==Musical style==

{{Quote|When we typically do our shows, there's the raucous and the wild show and then we hop off the microphones and do acoustic songs. That is the testing ground for the new material. There's not as much pressure under the microphones and the lights. That is where we sneak stuff in. . . it's one of our favorite times of the show . . If you don't have a porch, we bring the porch to you.&lt;ref name="herald-dispatch.com"/&gt; |Ward Harrison, ''former member''}}

{{quote|Like the name dictates, the Hacksensaw Boys are all about finger picking banjos, fiddles and baritone harmonies run through the punk rock blue grass ringer. They are as likely to hit home with hippies as rockabillies, or anyone who wants to raise a glass and stomp a hole through the ole wooden dance floor.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.herohill.com/2007/05/reviews-hackensaw-boys-look-out.htm Reviews:: Hackensaw Boys Look Out!]" Thursday, May 24, 2007 in Herohill.&lt;/ref&gt;|'''Herohill'''|Review of ''Look Out!''}}

{{Quote|I don't get that fired up that many other times in my life like when we play our songs. It's remarkable how it can transform you that way, especially when you see old people get up and shuffle around dance style. I've seen some people make fools of themselves in a most delightful way. We play at ridiculous tempos, screaming and hollering, seemingly doing musically questionable, possibly atrocious things by pop culture standards, but if you're there and involved with it there's raw excitement. You can't package that.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://takecountryback.wordpress.com/tag/hackensaw-boys/ Look Out For The Hackensaw Boys!]" by Dennis Cook, Taking It Back to the Roots!; December 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; |Jesse Fiske, ''former member''}}

As former member and founder Bullington puts it "we can play an old folks home in the afternoon and then play for a bunch of punk rockers, or whoever else might still be up and ready for a good time, or some music at midnight. They all seem to enjoy it equally."&lt;ref name="recoilmag.com"/&gt; Fellow founder Sickmen claims "the original intent of the band . . was to bring old-time Appalachian country punk rock."&lt;ref name="carbondalerocks.com"&gt;"[http://www.carbondalerocks.com/node/65811 Hackensaw Boys: Not a Traditional Oldtime Band]" by T.J. Jones (with interview by Lydia Loveless), Carbondale Rocks; February 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Band member Jesse "Baby J." Fiske questions the importance of assigning a specific style: "We're not really an old-time band either. As long as we speak to someone, it doesn't really matter what the genre is."&lt;ref name="fredericksburg.com"/&gt; The group largely performs original material, with a traditional feel.  As former member Shawn Galbraith, banjo player, puts it: "We play original material provided by different members of the band. There are some traditional elements to our sound for sure, but we always try to maintain some uniqueness."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thedaonline.com/a-e/the-hackensaw-boys-to-play-at-123-pleasant-street-1.2705853#.TyVwnVxSRfE The Hackensaw Boys to play at 123 Pleasant Street]" interview by Hunter Homistek, The Daily Athenaeum &gt; A&amp;E; November 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; "I don't think many people would call us a traditional oldtime band," states bandleader David Sickmen: "I'd say our songs are about ninety percent originals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21470">[[File:Numbered-Treaties-Map.svg|thumb|Wandering Spirit's band fell under the jurisdiction of Treaty Six.]]
'''Wandering Spirit''' (a.k.a. '''Kapapamahchakwew''', '''Papamahchakwayo''', '''Esprit Errant'''; [[birth|b.]]1845 – [[death|d.]]1885) was a [[Cree]] [[Tribal chief|war chief]] of a band of [[Plains Cree]]. There is little information on Wandering Spirit’s life. Most of what is known begins shortly before the 1885 Frog Lake Massacre and ends with his execution at the hands of the Canadian government. However, there is some information regarding his role within the Plains Cree people.

Wandering Spirit was a young war chief among the Plains Cree and frequently came into conflict with the band’s titular leader, Chief Big Bear. Whenever Big Bear left the band for a period of time, Wandering Spirit and Big Bear’s son, Imasees, were left in command.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tobias|first=John|date=1983|title=Canada's Subjugation of the Plains Cree, 1879- 1885|url=|journal=Canadian Historical Review|volume=LXIV| issue =  4|pages=541|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both had challenged Big Bear for full leadership in 1885 but were unsuccessful. Wandering Spirit's failed run for leadership left his popularity waning among his supporters, as Big Bears experience was valued over Wandering Spirit’s enthusiasm to punish their oppressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tobias|first=John|date=1983|title=Canada's Subjugation of the Plains Cree, 1879- 1885|url=|journal=Canadian Historical Review|volume=LXIV| issue =  4|pages=544|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the Frog Lake Massacre, Wandering Spirit gained notoriety for his conquests in battle. During his lifetime he participated in many attacks on the Blackfoot warriors and was successful in killing many of them.

==Frog Lake Massacre==
:{{Main|Frog Lake Massacre}}

=== Lead-up ===
The Frog Lake Massacre occurred within a wider context of starvation, ecological change, and political and cultural conflict. During the 1880s, the Plains Cree were suffering from the decline of the [[Bison hunting|buffalo]] population, which they had traditionally depended on for sustenance. Buffalo were becoming scarce throughout Canada due to overhunting. This created a particular animosity between the Plains Cree and the [[Métis in Canada|Métis]], who were seen as "half-breeds"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Plains Cree: Trade, Diplomacy and War, 1790 to 1870|last=Milloy|first=John|publisher=University of Manitoba Press|year=1988|isbn=9780887553837|location=Winnipeg|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; infringing upon the Plains Cree’s hunting grounds. Another reason for the decline in the buffalo was the introduction of firearms, which combined with the European settlers’ demand for buffalo fur robes and pemmican allowed for unsustainable hunting practices. The Plains Cree often trespassed on Blackfoot lands in search of buffalo and blamed any deaths this incurred on the [[Hudson's Bay Company|Hudson’s Bay Company]], whose trading conquests they felt had forced their hand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the absence of buffalo Indigenous groups came to rely on government rations, which were administered by local Indian Agents. This was a source of contention. There were instances of insufficient or spoiled rations. Indigenous groups felt that the treaty rights they had negotiated with the colonial government were not being respected; meanwhile, as the Conservative and Liberal parties grappled for power, they pressured one another to cut expenditures on welfare programs like those out west. Starvation and politics strained the already tense relationships between natives and European traders.

After extensive fighting with the Blackfoot, the Plains Cree were ordered by the Canadian government to relocate to Frog Lake, where they shared the territory with their cousins the Woods Cree. Frog Lake was not a reservation, and Big Bear’s band subsisted there with minimal provisions or government assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Loyal till Death: Indians and the North-West Rebellion|last=Stonechild|first=Blair|last2=Waiser|first2=Bill|publisher=Best Book Manufacturers|year=1997|isbn=|location=Canada|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Affairs attempted to shepherd them onto a reservation through the denial of rations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Loyal till Death: Indians and the North-West Rebellion|last=Stonechild|first=Blair|last2=Waiser|first2=Bill|publisher=Best Book Manufacturers|year=1997|isbn=|location=Canada|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local Indian Agent was Thomas Quinn, noted by historians as being “a mean-spirited, petty little man completely lacking in compassion.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Clearing the Plains: Disease, Politics of Starvation, and the Loss of Aboriginal Life|last=Daschuk|first=James|publisher=University of Regina Press|year=2013|isbn=9780889772960|location=Canada|pages=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infamously, he once summoned the natives around Frog Lake to the ration house in promise of food only to declare to the emaciated masses that it had been an April Fool’s prank and they would receive nothing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Quinn was unpopular with the Plains Cree and Wandering Spirit in particular. After a disagreement, Wandering Spirit had once threatened Quinn by telling him that he “used to enjoy killing a person” and missed the feeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Loyal till Death: Indians and the North-West Rebellion|last=Stonechild|first=Blair|last2=Waiser|first2=Bill|publisher=Best Book Manufacturers|year=1997|isbn=|location=Canada|pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this incident the government recommended that Quinn relocate to Fort Pitt for his own safety. Quinn refused and remained at Frog Lake.

This discontent was instrumental in the massacre. Contrary to Big Bear’s attempts at diplomacy, Wandering Spirit favoured a more aggressive resistance strategy that resonated with the warlike members of the band and won him popular support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Loyal till Death: Indians and the North-West Rebellion|last=Stonechild|first=Blair|last2=Waiser|first2=Bill|publisher=Best Book Manufacturers|year=1997|isbn=|location=Canada|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would culminate in the deaths of nine European traders.

=== Massacre ===
Even though [[Big Bear]], was against the attacks he later served time in jail for not preventing it from happening. It was the war chief, Wandering Spirit, that held the ruling power in the tribe at the time of the attack and he used his position to lead the men into the Frog Lake settlement while Big Bear was away.&lt;ref&gt;Theresa Gowanlock, ''Two months in the camp of Big Bear: the life and adventures of Theresa Gowanlock and Theresa Delaney'', 21, http://eco.canadiana.ca.cat1.lib.trentu.ca:8080/view/oocihm.30361/23?r=0&amp;s=1&lt;/ref&gt; While historians cannot confirm the reason for Big Bear's absence from his band at the time, the most prolific theory is that he was suffering from alcohol poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;Blair Stonechild and Bill Waiser, ''Loyal till Death: Indians and the North-West Rebellion''(Canada: Best Book Manufacturers, 1997),116.&lt;/ref&gt;

After seeing the success of the [[Métis in Canada|Métis]] in the [[Battle of Duck Lake]], the Cree felt more confident in their ability to combat the Canadian government and seized the opportunity to make their own move against the colonial government.

They hoped to take the people in the Frog Lake settlement as hostages and seize its provisions before going to join the Métis and [[Louis Riel]] at Fort Pitt.&lt;ref&gt;"A Tale of Two Massacres," Literary Review of Canada, https://reviewcanada.ca/magazine/2012/12/a-tale-of-two-massacres/&lt;/ref&gt; When the attack on Frog Lake began, they took Thomas Quinn as a hostage in his home because of his status and his cruelty. After allowing the townspeople to attend mass at the church, the Cree men would not let them leave and took them as their hostages inside. When the Cree attempted to move their hostages from the town to the war camp they had set up, Quinn refused to cooperate with them anymore, leading Wandering Spirit to shoot him in the head with his rifle. This resulted in panic among the hostages. Spurred by Wandering Spirit's actions, his warriors massacred eight more unarmed people.&lt;ref&gt;12&lt;/ref&gt; With nine of their hostages dead, the Cree men took the remaining settlers with them as their prisoners.

The Cree took their hostages to the war camp that they had set up outside of the settlement before the battle began. The hostages were warned that they would be safe so long as they remained inside the camp, but that everyone found outside would be considered an enemy.

Big Bear had been eating breakfast with the wife of the manager of the Hudson's Bay Company when he heard the news,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Peter Lozinski, ''Rewriting Canadian History'', http://www.coldlakesun.com/2015/10/26/rewriting-canadian-history&lt;/ref&gt; but immediately returned to his band to put an end to the violence. He moved the tribe further north in hopes of isolating the group from further violence.&lt;ref&gt;L. John Tobias, “Canada's Subjugation of the Plains Cree, 1879- 1885,” ''Canadian Historical Review'' LXIV, no. 4 (1983): 545.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capture of Fort Pitt ==
Wandering Spirit resolved to capture [[Battle of Fort Pitt|Fort Pitt]] two weeks following the Frog Lake Massacre. The fort contained provisions and ammunition, which appealed to the starving Cree. The conquest was also supported by [[Louis Riel]], as Fort Pitt housed a [[North-West Mounted Police]] detachment that could prove to be a threat during a rebellion.

It was a brief and almost bloodless conflict. After Corporal David Cowan was shot and killed, Fort Pitt was surrendered to the Cree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Loyal till Death: Indians and the North-West Rebellion|last=Stonechild|first=Blair|last2=Waiser|first2=Bill|publisher=Best Book Manufacturers|year=1997|isbn=|location=Canada|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of a North-West Mounted Police officer caused an uproar. Settlers projected anxieties of another Riel conspiracy onto the Cree, who were depicted in newspapers like the ''Saskatchewan Herald'' as villainous. Wandering Spirit, however, insisted that the Cree had only been reacting against starvation and that there was no larger plot at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Loyal till Death: Indians and the North-West Rebellion|last=Stonechild|first=Blair|last2=Waiser|first2=Bill|publisher=Best Book Manufacturers|year=1997|isbn=|location=Canada|pages=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Wandering Spirit's band followed him out of a sense of crisis but generally abhorred the violence.&lt;ref&gt;Blair Stonechild and Bill Waiser, ''Loyal till Death: Indians and the North-West Rebellion''(Canada: Best Book Manufacturers, 1997), 171&lt;/ref&gt;

The band retreated north with their stolen supplies. They were pursued by law enforcement, and after several months Wandering Spirit was cornered. He surrendered and attempted to commit suicide by stabbing himself in the chest, but only pierced a lung.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Loyal till Death: Indians and the North-West Rebellion|last=Stonechild|first=Blair|last2=Waiser|first2=Bill|publisher=Best Book Manufacturers|year=1997|isbn=|location=Canada|pages=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was taken into custody.

== Trial ==
After Wandering Spirit was captured, he was held in custody until the trial took place at Battleford. The court case was overseen by the Magistrate [[Charles Rouleau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCoy|first=Ted|date=May 2009|title=Legal Ideology in the Aftermath of Rebellion:The Convicted First Nations Participants, 1885|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/|journal=Histoire sociale/soical history 42|volume=83|pages=183|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time as the Frog Lake Massacre, Rouleau received a telegram informing him that his home had been burned down by the Cree during the [[Looting of Battleford]]. At this time several other Indigenous men such as [[Little Bear (Native American leader)|Little Bear]] (Apaschiskoos), Walking the Sky (a.k.a. Round the Sky), Bad Arrow, and Miserable Man, Iron Body, Ika (a.k.a. Crooked leg), and Man Without Blood were also facing charges. They were put on trial for the murders committed during the Frog Lake Massacre. Throughout Wandering Spirit's trial, he spoke freely about his actions regarding both the Frog Lake Massacre and the capture of Fort Pitt. This was an admission of guilt so that he could clear his conscience and have assurances for his afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCoy|first=Ted|date=May 2009|title=Legal Ideology in the Aftermath of Rebellion: The Convicted First Nations Participants, 1885|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/|journal=Histoire sociale/Social history 42|volume=83|pages=222|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wandering Spirit was not permitted access to legal counsel during this time. Additionally, the trials were held in English which prevented many of the accused from defending themselves against the charges. Aside from legal matters, the majority of Wandering Spirit's communications were with missionaries, who often encouraged Indigenous people, such as Wandering Spirit and the other men who were held prisoner, to plead guilty regardless of whether they committed the crime or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCoy|first=Ted|date=May 2009|title=Legal Ideology in the Aftermath of Rebellion: The Convicted First Nations Participants, 1885|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/|journal=Histoire sociale/Social history 42|volume=83|pages=185|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally Wandering Spirit refused to speak to the missionaries up until he had a "spiritual awakening" prior to his execution.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCoy|first=Ted|date=May 2009|title=Legal Ideology in the Aftermath of Rebellion: The Convicted First Nations Participants, 1885|url=https://muse.jhu.edu|journal=Histoire sociale/Social history 42,|volume=83|pages=189|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this point that Wandering Spirit was baptized.

Even though Wandering Spirit did plead guilty to the charges laid against him, he insisted that he only played a minor role in the uprising, as he felt immense guilt for the role he had played in both the Frog Lake Massacre and the death of Thomas Quinn. He even said that he "fought against it, Imasees nor the others would let [him] go." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCoy|first=Ted|date=May 2009|title=Legal Ideology in the Aftermath of Rebellion: The Convicted First Nations Participants, 1885|url=https://muse.jhu.edu|journal=Histoire sociale/Social history 42|volume=83|pages=15|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 22, after confessing to shooting Thomas Quinn in the head at point-blank range. Wandering Spirit was sentenced to hang by Rouleau.

==Death==
The Canadian government hoped to make an example of Wandering Spirit and his men to discourage future uprisings by Indigenous peoples. Sir John A MacDonald said on the hanging that “we must vindicate the position of the white man; we must teach the Indians what law is.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The plan was for the eight men to be hung two at a time, but it was later decided that all eight would be hung together.

On November 27, 1885, Wandering Spirit was executed as part of the [[The 1885 Hangings at Battleford|1885 Hangings at Battleford]], which holds the record for Canada’s largest mass execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.historicacanada.ca/on_this_day/largest-mass-execution-occurs|title=Largest Mass Execution Occurs {{!}} Historica Canada|website=www.historicacanada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wandering Spirit had said that he wished his death alone could atone for his acts, as he was saddened that seven others had to die with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Loyal till Death: Indians and the North-West Rebellion|last=Stonechild|first=Blair|last2=Waiser|first2=Bill|publisher=Best Book Manufacturers|year=1997|isbn=|location=Canada|pages=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; A myth circulated that Wandering Spirit sung a love song to his wife as he was hanged. However, there are no reputable sources that substantiate this claim. Sources do indicate that Wandering Spirit appeared stoic during the hanging, while the other men were singing death chants.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Wandering Spirit’s body was interred in a mass grave in Battleford along with the other men hung at Battleford in 1885. Originally unmarked, a tombstone with the names of the eight men buried there was erected in December 1985 to mark the one-hundredth anniversary by the North West Centennial Advisory Committee and Battleford City Council, with both groups splitting the costs along with a grant from the Provincial Department of Culture and Recreation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sicc.sk.ca/archive/saskindian/a85dec43.htm|title=Unveil Mass Grave [Battleford]|last=King|first=Archie|date=December 1985/January 1986|website=sicc.sk.ca|publisher=Saskatchewan Indian 43|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
In 1976, Elder Pauline Shirt and Elder Vern Harper established the Wandering Spirit Survival School of Toronto, which has been renamed as the First Nations Junior and Senior School of Toronto.The School began meeting in the Harper-Shirt household's living room in the Bain Co-op with a handful of children and soon outgrew the space.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They moved temporarily into the Native Canadian Centre's second-floor rooms before finding a suitable space and being designated an  "Alternative School."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The school was named Wandering Spirit, who was Elder Pauline's Great-Grandfather. In 1983 the school was renamed First Nations School of Toronto. A documentary about the school was made in 1978 and can be found in the National Film Board of Canada archives.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/ElderPaulineShirt/videos/250684235098535/|title=Grandmother Pauline Shirt|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:The Tombstone of the Battleford Eight.jpg|thumb|The headstone marking the mass grave of the eight executed Indigenous men.]]In 1985, a tombstone with the names of the eight men executed at Battleford was erected by the North West Centennial Advisory Committee (NWCAC) and Battleford City council to mark the one-hundredth anniversary of the execution. In attendance were Culture and Recreation Minister Rick Folk, Chief Lawrence of Poundmaker, NWCAC member Gordon Tootoosis and Harvey Johnson who was the Director of the NWCAC.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Chairman of the NWCAC Irwin McInstosh was quoted as saying “This mass grave commemoration is the last historical date of any significance in the North West Rebellion.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Rich Folk added “We are not here to pass judgement on the Indian people who lie buried here in this mass grave, that was done 100 years earlier when they were arraigned for acts of violence during the Rebellion but, this gravesite marker will serve as a call to peace and a reminder that violence and war is never the solution.”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A sign and permanent teepee were added in the same year. 
In 2013, the gravesite was vandalized. Ray Fox, the groundskeeper, said in regards to the damage “I’m just saying we need to talk about these kinds of things because this is not pretty, as you can see, when you’re looking at this gravestone and it’s been deliberately pushed over and our tee-pee structure here that we erected as a memorial to these warriors is strung all over this place in this piece of property. That’s not respect.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbcradio.com/2013/06/wandering-spirit-grave-site-vandalized|title=Wandering Spirit Grave-Site Vandalized|last=Collie|first=Doug|date=|website=mbcradio.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that whether or not someone agrees with what the men did, their final resting place should be respected.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Öndör Gongor''' ({{lang-mn|Өндөр Гонгор}}, "Tall Gongor", c. 1880/85 – c. 1925/30) was a very tall man in early-20th century [[Mongolia]]. He was measured 2.36&amp;nbsp;m (7 ft 9 in) high by [[Roy Chapman Andrews]],&lt;ref name="Nyamaa"&gt;M.Nyamaa, ''Khövsgöl aimgiin lavlakh toli'', Ulaanbaatar 2001, p. 49f&lt;/ref&gt; but some other sources even give 2.45&amp;nbsp;m (8 ft). He is known all over Mongolia, and also mentioned or pictured in some accounts of contemporary western travellers.&lt;ref name="Larson"&gt;[[Frans August Larson]], ''Duke of Mongolia'', Boston 1930, p.129f&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbath"&gt;Ladislaus Forbath/Joseph Geleta, ''The New Mongolia'', London 1936, pp. 247, 259&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an interview with his daughter G. Budkhand, published in 1997, Gongor was the third child of a herder named Pürev, who lived in the Dalai Choinkhor wangiin [[Banner (Inner Mongolia)|khoshuu]], or what is today [[Jargalant, Khövsgöl|Jargalant]] [[sums of Mongolia|sum]] of [[Khövsgöl Province|Khövsgöl aimag]]. He was not particularly big as a child, only had long fingers. Because he always ate a lot, he became a bit unpopular with his parents, and eventually was sent to [[Ulaanbaatar|Ikh Khüree]]. One day, he was summoned to the [[Bogd Khan]], given fresh clothes, and after a while he was even made to marry a woman who worked as one of the Bogd Khan's seamstresses, on the grounds that according to a horoscope by the [[Bogd Khan]], their fates were connected.&lt;ref name="Nyamaa"/&gt; 

The accounts are a bit at odds about what Gongor's occupation at the Bogd Khan's court was: accountant and keeper of the Bogd Khan's [[elephant]],&lt;ref name="Nyamaa"/&gt; the Bogd Khan's bodyguard,&lt;ref name="Forbath"/&gt; or wrestler.&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt; In 1913, he travelled to Russia with a delegation headed by [[Sain Noyon Khan Namnansüren]]. Later, he is said to have worked at the toll office.&lt;ref name="Nyamaa"/&gt;

Gongor had four children. He died in his home area in the late 1920s, before reaching the age of 50.&lt;ref name="Nyamaa"/&gt; His corpse is said to have been stolen during the funeral - at that time, the deceased were laid out in the steppe to be devoured by birds and other animals. It is now on display in a [[United States|US]] museum {{Fact|date=January 2008}}.

One of Gongor's grandsons, D. Davaanyam, is a well-known children's author in Mongolia.&lt;ref name="Nyamaa"/&gt;
