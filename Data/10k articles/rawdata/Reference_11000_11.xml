      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13865">'''A Formula of Agreement''' is an ecclesiastical agreement between the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]], [[Reformed Church in America]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] and the [[United Church of Christ]], establishing [[full communion]] with each other.

== Background ==
Beginning in 1962, under the sponsorship of the [[Lutheran World Federation]] and the Reformed World Alliance, representatives from the [[Lutheran Church in America]], the [[American Lutheran Church]], the [[United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.]], the [[Presbyterian Church in the U.S.]], the Reformed Church in America and the United Church of Christ met to discuss their differences and agreements regarding the doctrine of the Lord’s Supper.&lt;ref&gt;Klug, Eugene, ''The Springfielder Volume XXXVI'', No. 2, September, 1972 “From Marburg Revisited to Princeton ‘72” http://www.ctsfw.net/media/pdfs/klugmarburgrevisited.pdf, pgs. 110 &amp; 111&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1966, the book ''Marburg Revisited'', the title referring to the [[Marburg Colloquy]] of 1529, was published, claiming that “As a result of our studies and discussions we see no insuperable obstacles to pulpit and altar fellowship and, therefore, we recommend to our parent bodies that they encourage their constituent churches to enter into discussions looking forward to intercommunion and the fuller recognition of one another's ministries." &lt;ref&gt;Klug, Eugene, ''The Springfielder Volume XXXVI'', No. 2, September, 1972 “From Marburg Revisited to Princeton ‘72” http://www.ctsfw.net/media/pdfs/klugmarburgrevisited.pdf, pg. 111&lt;/ref&gt; While a second round of dialogues between 1972 and 1974, made little progress, a third round (1981-1983) produced joint statements on the Lord’s Supper, justification and ministry, published in ''A Call To Action'' in 1984. Two years later, representatives reached the conclusion that the Reformed and Lutheran denominations recognize each other as churches that preach the Gospel and administer the sacraments in accordance to Christ’s command, recommendations which were adopted by the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) (which has come about due to a merger between the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. and the Presbyterian Church in the U.S. in 1983) and the Reformed Church in America in 1986, and would be adopted by the United Church of Christ in 1989. For their parts, while the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches and the American Lutheran Church also adopted the resolutions in 1986, although the Lutheran Church in America was more reluctant to adopt the resolutions, recommending further dialogues.&lt;ref&gt;"A History of Lutheran/Reformed Dialogues" https://www.rca.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=431&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the [[Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches]], the American Lutheran Church and the Lutheran Church in America merged to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and at their constituting meeting, it was voted to continue discussions with the PCUSA, RCA and United Church of Christ, forming the Lutheran-Reformed Committee for Theological Conversations  in order to discuss doctrinal condemnations in the Lutheran “Formula of Concord” and issues relating to Christology, the Lord’s Supper and predestination. The committee released their report “A Common Calling: The Witness of our Reformation Churches in North America Today” in 1992, which stated that there were no “church dividing differences” and unaminmously recommended &lt;blockquote&gt;“That the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the Reformed Church in America (RCA), and the United Church of Christ (UCC) declare that they are in full communion with one another. In the specific terms of full communion as they are developed in our study, this recommendation also requires (1) that they recognize each other as churches in which the Gospel is rightly preached and the sacraments rightly administered according to the Word of God; (2) that they withdraw any historic condemnation by one side or the other as inappropriate for the faith and life of our churches today; (3) that they continue to recognize each others' Baptism and authorize and encourage the sharing of the Lord's Supper among their members; (4) that they recognize each others' various ministries and make provision for the orderly exchange of ordained ministers of Word and Sacrament; (5) that they establish appropriate channels of consultation and decision-making within the existing structures of the churches; (6) that they commit themselves to an ongoing process of theological dialogue in order to clarify further the common understanding of the faith and foster its common expression in evangelism, witness, and service; (7) that they pledge themselves to living together under the Gospel in such a way that the principle of mutual affirmation and admonition becomes the basis of a trusting relationship in which respect and love for the other will have a chance to grow.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="rca1"&gt;"A History of Lutheran/Reformed Dialogues" https://www.rca.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=434 (retrieved Nov. 13th, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These recommendations led to the production of several documents intended for study in the churches: ''A Common Discovery: Learning about the Churches of the Reformation in North America Today''; ''Lutheran-Reformed Theological Reflections on Full Communion''; and ''Glimpses: What Full Communion May Mean to You''.&lt;ref name=rca1/&gt; Eventually, after some reluctance from those in the RCA about entering into full communion with the UCC due to issues regarding homosexuality, in 1997, A Formula of Agreement was adopted by the denominations.

==Content ==
The formulas affirm that the denominations are in full communion with each other. Full communion is defined as that the denominations
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;big&gt;"&lt;/big&gt;
* recognize each other as churches in which the gospel is rightly preached and the sacraments rightly administered according to the Word of God;
* withdraw any historic condemnation by one side or the other as inappropriate for the life and faith of our churches today;
* continue to recognize each other's Baptism and authorize and encourage the sharing of the Lord's Supper among their members;
* recognize each others' various ministries and make provision for the orderly exchange of ordained ministers of Word and Sacrament;
* establish appropriate channels of consultation and decision-making within the existing structures of the churches;
* commit themselves to an ongoing process of theological dialogue in order to clarify further the common understanding of the faith and foster its common expression in evangelism, witness, and service;	
* pledge themselves to living together under the Gospel in such a way that the principle of mutual affirmation and admonition becomes the basis of a trusting relationship in which respect and love for the other will have a chance to grow.&lt;big&gt;"&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=rca1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;	

Noting overall theological disagreements in the past in their confessional documents, the formulas state that “as a consequence of doctrinal agreement, it is stated that the ‘condemnations expressed in the confessional documents no longer apply to the contemporary doctrinal position of the assenting churches’&amp;nbsp;" (''Leuenberg Agreement'', IV.32.b).

Theologically, the biggest issue has been disagreements between the Lutherans and the Reformed stem from disagreements over the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, with the Lutherans arguing that Christ is physically present in the elements, whereas the Reformed have argued that Christ is spiritually present. The formulas note that “the theological conversations acknowledged that it has not been possible to reconcile the confessional formulations from the sixteenth century with a ‘common language. . .which could do justice to all the insights, convictions, and concerns of our ancestors in the faith’ (''A Common Calling'', p.&amp;nbsp;49). However, the theological conversations recognized these enduring differences as acceptable diversities with regard to the Lord's Supper.” Citing the [[Leuenberg Agreement]] of 1973 made between several Lutheran and Reformed churches in Europe, it notes that:
: "Lutheran and Reformed Christians agree that: In the Lord's Supper the risen Christ imparts himself in body and blood, given up for all, through his word of promise with bread and wine. He thereby grants us forgiveness of sins and sets us free for a new life of faith. He enables us to experience anew that we are members of his body. He strengthens us for service to all people. (The official text reads, 'Er starkt uns zum Dienst an den Menschen,' which may be translated 'to all human beings') (Leuenberg Agreement, II.2.15). 
When we celebrate the Lord's Supper we proclaim the death of Christ through which God has reconciled the world with himself. We proclaim the presence of the risen Lord in our midst. Rejoicing that the Lord has come to us, we await his future coming in glory (Leuenberg Agreement, II.2.16)” 
&lt;ref name="rca"&gt;"A Formula of Agreement Between the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Presbyterian Church (USA), the Reformed Church in America, and the United Church of Christ on Entering into Full Communion on the Basis of A Common Calling" https://www.rca.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=434 (retrieved Nov. 13th, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to historical disagreements over double vs. single predestination, the formulas state that Reformed and the Lutherans can agree that salvation by grace alone through faith alone and that “Although Lutherans and Reformed have different emphases in the way they live out their belief in the sovereignty of God's love, they agree that ‘God's unconditional will to save must be preached against all cultural optimism or pessimism’ (A Common Calling, p.&amp;nbsp;54).&lt;ref name=rca/&gt; It is noted that "‘a common language that transcends the polemics of the past and witnesses to the common predestination faith of Lutheran and Reformed Churches has emerged already in theological writings and official or unofficial statements in our churches’ (A Common Calling, page 55)”.&lt;ref name=rca/&gt;

===Exchange of ministers ===
The ''Formula of Agreement ''allows for “an orderly exchange of ministers of word and sacrament” between the PCUSA, ELCA, UCC or RCA. A minister wishing to transfer to another denomination must be educated in their own tradition before transferring to a church in another tradition and it must be done at the invitation of the receiving church and with the consent of the sending church &lt;ref&gt;“A Formula of Agreement: the Orderly Exchange of Ministers of Word and Sacrament” (Office of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), 2000), pg. 3 http://images.rca.org/docs/ministry/FormulaOfAgreement.pdf , retrieved Nov. 14th, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Each denomination has established procedures for allowing ministers from other denominations to serve in their denomination, and the agreement guarantees that each denomination’s polity will be respected.&lt;ref&gt;"Orderly Exchange of Ministers" pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy ==
The fellowship between the denominations has remained controversial. The [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] has condemned the agreement, arguing that it jettisons the Lutheran confessional standards as laid out in the ''[[Book of Concord]]'', as the Lutheran and the Reformed views of the supper are irreconcilable.&lt;ref&gt;''The Formula of Agreement in Confessional Lutheran Perspective ''The Commission on Theology and Church Relations The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, 1999; retrieved November 22nd, 2013 '' ''www.lcms.org/Document.fdoc?src=lcm&amp;id=338&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the other larger issues has to do with diverging stances on human sexuality, as the Reformed Church in America officially does not affirm homosexuality. Even as the'' Formula of Agreement was ''being drafted, some in the Reformed Church in America objected to the agreement with the United Church of Christ because of their more progressive stance on homosexuality. The ELCA's subsequent decision in 2009 to allow homosexuals to serve as clergy prompted some conservatives in the RCA to call for the RCA's withdrawal from the Formula of Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;"Reformed Body Says Lutheran Gay Vote Does Not Impair Partnership" Lilian Kwon, ''The Christian Post.

'''''Apparatus ad omnium gentium historiam''''' (''Apparatus to the history of all peoples'') (1597)

The author of this impressive bibliographical guide to the library of history, [[Antonio Possevino]] was a major figure in the diplomatic and intellectual life of the [[Counter Reformation]]. His [[Bibliotheca selecta]] 1593 announces a programmatic role for history as a guiding principle in his organization of his Jesuit encyclopedia "in Historia, in Disciplinis". Possevino's ''De Humana Historia'', Book 16, is a first elaboration of his re-edition of the culture of the [[ars historica]] as part of a papally sanctioned programme of Catholic learning. In 1597 with the printer G.B.Ciotti of [[Venice]] Possevino expanded this material into a book with this ambitious title in seven parts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YsM5AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=antonio+possevino+apparatus+ad+omnium+gentium+historiam&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FCCmTf7aF8fb0QHJwuj1CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Online link to this edition]&lt;/ref&gt; Possevino's title is in direct contest with the '''Methodus ad facilem historiarum cognitionem''' 1560 of [[Jean Bodin]]. His source for this work was the [[Artis Historicae Penus]] of the Basel printer [[Pietro Perna]]. Obscuring the uses he was to make of this heterodox source the Jesuit issued a censure of the work in  his ''Iudicium'' of 1592 and had had it placed on the [[Index librorum prohibitorum]].&lt;ref&gt;See Gregory Woods, Antonio Possevino and the Erasmian sources of the Jesuit ars historica: from the Perna Methodus historica (Basel, 1576) to the Bibliotheca selecta in historia (Rome, 1593) and the Apparatus ad omnium gentium historiam (Venice, 1597), Ph.D. Thesis, Columbia University, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Ciotti also printed the work translated in Italian by Possevino in 1598, ''Apparato all'historia di tutte le nationi et il modo di studiare la geografia''. In 1602 there was a further edition, ''De Apparatu ad omnium gentium historia'' published in Venice which served as the text for an updated edition of the ''Bibliotheca selecta'' (Venice, 1603).

With this work Possevino refashioned the [[ars historica]] culture and literature of the [[Late Renaissance]] as a cornerstone of the Jesuit classicism of the [[Baroque]]. His work laid the foundation for a tradition of historical and bibliographical scholarship exemplified in the [[Bollandist]] scholars, [[Nathaniel Bacon (Jesuit)|Nathaniel Bacon]]'s '''Bibliotheca scriptorum Societatis Iesu''', the histories of [[Daniello Bartoli]] and other landmarks of Jesuit historiography, such as the [[Monumenta Historica Societatis Iesu]].

The '''''Austrian Chronicle of the 95 Rulers''''' (''Österreichische Chronik von den 95 Herrschaften '') of '''Leopold von Wien''' (formerly known as Leopold Steinreuter) of [[Vienna]] (lived ca. 1340–1400) is a 14th-century chronicle compiled by order of [[Albert III, Duke of Austria]].

The chronicle is notable for recording legendary history from the time of [[Noah]], constructing a debatable ancestry of the [[Dukes of Austria]] connecting them with biblical rulers of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]]. It exerted considerable influence on 15th century Austrian historiography, a fact underscored by its preservation in more than 50 manuscripts (among these Cod. 2820 foll. 33ra–171vb  in the [[Austrian National Library]]).

In the 16th and 17th centuries, the popularity of the chronicle waned rapidly due to its assumed fictional content, and it remained unedited until the early 20th century.

Since its edition, it has played a certain role in [[pseudohistory]], in particular in  US American [[Biblical literalism]], in publications such as those of [[Herman L. Hoeh]]&lt;ref&gt;"Compendium of World History" (1963){{cite web|url=http://www.earth-history.com/Various/Compendium/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524233911/http://www.earth-history.com/Various/Compendium/ |archivedate=2011-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herbert W. Armstrong]]
&lt;ref&gt;''Here's the Plain Truth About Old Testament Polygamy'' (1963)[http://www.blowthetrumpet.org/OLDTESTAMENTPOLYGAMY.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Worldwide Church of God]], who took the chronicle's genealogies at face value to postulate that, e.g.,
:"European civilization &amp;mdash; and its history &amp;mdash; is as old as Egypt's. But it has been suppressed. Not since the close of the seventeenth century has it been allowed to be taught publicly." (Hoeh (1963), vol. 2 ch. 3[http://www.earth-history.com/Various/Compendium/hhc2ch03.htm])

As a [[DataCite]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20150907234653/https://www.datacite.org/bibsys member] BIBSYS act as a national DataCite representative in Norway and thereby allow all of Norway's higher education and research institutions to use [[Digital object identifier|DOI]] on their research data.

All their products and services are developed in cooperation with their member institutions.

==History==

BIBSYS began in 1972 as a collaborative project between the [[Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters]] Library (Det Kongelige Norske Videnskabers Selskabs Bibliotek), the [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]] Library and the Computer Centre at the Norwegian Institute of Technology. The purpose of the project was to automate internal library routines. Since 1972 Bibsys has evolved from a library system supplier for two libraries in Trondheim, to developing and operating a national library system for Norwegian research and special libraries. The target group has also expanded to include the customers of research and special libraries, by providing them easy access to library resources.

BIBSYS is a public administrative agency answerable to the Ministry of Education and Research, and administratively organised as a unit at NTNU. In addition to BIBSYS Library System, the product portfolio consists of BISBYS Ask, BIBSYS Brage, BIBSYS Galleri and BIBSYS Tyr. All operation of applications and databases is performed centrally by BIBSYS. BIBSYS also offer a range of services, both in connection with their products and separate services independent of the products they supply.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Billboard'' Hot 100}}
[[File:BillboardLogo2013.svg|thumb|The ''Billboard'' logo]]
The '''''Billboard'' Hot 100''' is the [[music industry]] standard [[record chart]] in the United States for songs, published weekly by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine. Chart rankings are based on sales (physical and [[Music download|digital]]), [[airplay|radio play]], and [[Music streaming|online streaming]] in the United States.

The weekly tracking period for sales was initially Monday to Sunday when [[Nielsen Holdings PLC|Nielsen]] started tracking sales in 1991, but was changed to Friday to Thursday in July 2015. This tracking period also applies to compiling online streaming data. Radio airplay, which, unlike sales figures and streaming, is readily available on a real-time basis, is tracked on a Monday to Sunday cycle (previously Wednesday to Tuesday).&lt;ref name="tracking"&gt;{{cite news|author=Billboard Staff|title=Billboard to Alter Chart Tracking Week for Global Release Date|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6605842/billboard-alter-chart-tracking-week-global-release-date|work=Billboard|date=June 24, 2015| accessdate=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new chart is compiled and officially released to the public by ''Billboard'' on Tuesdays.

The first number one song of the Hot 100 was "[[Poor Little Fool]]" by [[Ricky Nelson]], on August 4, 1958. As of the issue for the week ending on December 1, 2018, the Hot 100 has had 1,079 different number one hits. The chart's current number-one song is "[[Thank U, Next (song)|Thank U, Next]]" by [[Ariana Grande]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8486514/ariana-grande-thank-u-next-third-week-hot-100-panic-at-the-disco|title=Ariana Grande's 'Thank U, Next' Leads Hot 100 for Third Week, Panic! at the Disco Hits New High With 'High Hopes'|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== History ==
Prior to 1955, ''Billboard'' did not have a unified, all-encompassing popularity chart; instead, they measured songs by individual metrics. At the start of the rock era in 1955, three such charts existed:&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Molanphy|first1=Chris|title=How The Hot 100 Became America's Hit Barometer|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2013/08/16/207879695/how-the-hot-100-became-americas-hit-barometer|accessdate=14 March 2018|work=All Things Considered|publisher=NPR|date=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Best Sellers in Stores'' was the first ''Billboard'' chart, established in 1936. This chart ranked the biggest selling singles in retail stores, as reported by merchants surveyed throughout the country (20 to 50 positions).
* ''Most Played by Jockeys'' was ''Billboard's'' original airplay chart. It ranked the most played songs on United States radio stations, as reported by radio disc jockeys and radio stations (20 to 25 positions).
* ''Most Played in Jukeboxes'' ranked the most played songs in [[jukebox]]es across the United States (20 positions). This was one of the main outlets of measuring song popularity with the younger generation of music listeners, as many radio stations resisted adding [[rock and roll]] music to their playlists for many years.

Although officially all three charts had equal "weight" in terms of their importance, Billboard Magazine considers the ''Best Sellers in Stores'' chart when referencing a song's performance prior to the creation of the Hot 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CHART BEAT CHAT 12/2/2005|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/60472/chart-beat-chat|website=billboard.com|publisher=Billboard Music|accessdate=14 March 2018|date=2 December 2005|quote=The main chart was Best Sellers in Stores, and that's the list Billboard uses as THE pre-Hot 100 chart.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the week ending November 12, 1955, ''Billboard'' published '''The Top 100''' for the first time. ''The Top 100'' combined all aspects of a single's performance (sales, airplay and jukebox activity), based on a point system that typically gave sales (purchases) more weight than radio airplay. The ''Best Sellers In Stores'', ''Most Played by Jockeys'' and ''Most Played in Jukeboxes'' charts continued to be published concurrently with the new ''Top 100'' chart.

On June 17, 1957, ''Billboard'' discontinued the ''Most Played in Jukeboxes'' chart, as the popularity of jukeboxes waned and radio stations incorporated more and more rock-oriented music into their playlists. The week ending July 28, 1958 was the final publication of the ''Most Played By Jockeys'' and ''Top 100'' charts, both of which had [[Perez Prado]]'s instrumental version of "[[Patricia (Perez Prado song)|Patricia]]" ascending to the top.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

On August 4, 1958, ''Billboard'' premiered one main all-genre singles chart: the ''Hot 100''. The Hot 100 quickly became the industry standard and ''Billboard'' discontinued the ''Best Sellers In Stores'' chart on October 13, 1958.

The ''Billboard'' Hot 100 is still the standard by which a song's popularity is measured in the United States. The Hot 100 is ranked by radio airplay audience impressions as measured by Nielsen BDS, sales data compiled by [[Nielsen SoundScan|Nielsen Soundscan]] (both at retail and digitally) and streaming activity provided by online music sources.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;

There are several component charts that contribute to the overall calculation of the Hot 100. The most significant ones are:

* ''[[Hot 100 Airplay]]'': ''(per Billboard)'' approximately 1,000 stations, "composed of [[adult contemporary]], [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Country music|country]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]] and [[Christian music|Christian]] formats, digitally monitored twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Charts are ranked by number of gross audience impressions, computed by cross-referencing exact times of radio airplay with [[Arbitron]] listener data."
* ''Hot Singles Sales'': ''(per Billboard)'' "the top selling singles compiled from a national sample of retail store, mass merchant and internet sales reports collected, compiled, and provided by [[Nielsen SoundScan]]." The chart is released weekly and measures sales of physical commercial singles. With the decline in sales of physical singles in the US, many songs that become number one on this chart often do not even chart on the Hot 100.
* ''[[Digital Songs]]'': Digital sales are tracked by Nielsen SoundScan and are included as part of a title's sales points.
* ''[[Streaming Songs]]'': a collaboration between ''Billboard'', Nielsen SoundScan and [[National Association of Recording Merchandisers]] which measures the top streamed radio songs, on-demand songs and videos on leading online music services.

== Compilation ==

The tracking week for sales and streaming begins on Friday and ends on Thursday, while the radio play tracking-week runs from Monday to Sunday. A new chart is compiled and officially released to the public by ''Billboard'' on Tuesday. Each chart is post-dated with the "week-ending" issue date four days after the charts are refreshed online (i.e., the following Saturday).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8071011/billboard-chart-magazine-dates-release-week-change|title=Billboard Chart &amp; Magazine Dates Now to Align Closer to Release Week|magazine=Billboard|date=December 19, 2017|accessdate=January 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:

*Friday, January 1 – sales tracking-week begins, streaming tracking-week begins
*Monday, January 4 – airplay tracking-week begins
*Thursday, January 7 – sales tracking-week ends, streaming tracking-week ends
*Sunday, January 10 – airplay tracking-week ends
*Tuesday, January 12 – new chart released, with issue post-dated Saturday, January 16

== Policy changes ==

The methods and policies by which this data is obtained and compiled have changed many times throughout the chart's history.

Although the advent of a singles music chart spawned chart historians and chart-watchers and greatly affected [[popular culture|pop culture]] and produced countless bits of trivia, the main purpose of the Hot 100 is to aid those within the music industry: to reflect the popularity of the "product" (the singles, the albums, etc.) and to track the trends of the buying public. ''Billboard'' has (many times) changed its methodology and policies to give the most precise and accurate reflection of what is popular. A very basic example of this would be the ratio given to sales and airplay. During the Hot 100's early history, singles were the leading way by which people bought music. At times, when singles sales were robust, more weight was given to a song's retail points than to its radio airplay.

As the decades passed, the recording industry concentrated more on album sales than singles sales. Musicians eventually expressed their creative output in the form of full-length albums rather than singles, and by the 1990s many record companies stopped releasing singles altogether (see ''Album Cuts'', below). Eventually, a song's airplay points were weighted more so than its sales. ''Billboard'' has adjusted the sales/airplay ratio many times to more accurately reflect the true popularity of songs.

=== Double-sided singles ===

''Billboard'' has also changed its Hot 100 policy regarding "two-sided singles" several times. The pre-Hot 100 chart "Best Sellers in Stores" listed popular A- and-B-sides together, with the side that was played most often (based on its other charts) listed first. One of the most notable of these, but far from the only one, was [[Elvis Presley]]'s "Don't Be Cruel" / "Hound Dog". During the Presley single's chart run, top billing was switched back and forth between the two sides several times. But on the concurrent "Most Played in Juke Boxes", "Most Played by Jockeys" and the "Top 100", the two songs were listed separately, as was true of all songs. With the initiation of the Hot 100 in 1958, A- and-B-sides charted separately, as they had on the former Top 100.

Starting with the Hot 100 chart for the week ending November 29, 1969, this rule was altered; if both sides received significant airplay, they were listed together. This started to become a moot point by 1972, as most major record labels solidified a trend they had started in the 1960s by putting the same song on both sides of the singles it serviced to radio.

More complex issues began to arise as the typical A-and-B-side format of singles gave way to [[12 inch singles]] and maxi-singles, many of which contained more than one B-side. Further problems arose when, in several cases, a B-side would eventually overtake the A-side in popularity, thus prompting record labels to release a new single, featuring the former B-side as the A-side, along with a "new" B-side.

The inclusion of album cuts on the Hot 100 put the double-sided hit issues to rest permanently.

=== Album cuts ===

As many Hot 100 chart policies have been modified over the years, one rule always remained constant: songs were not eligible to enter the Hot 100 unless they were available to purchase as a single. However, on December 5, 1998, the Hot 100 changed from being a "singles" chart to a "songs" chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2013/08/16/207879695/how-the-hot-100-became-americas-hit-barometer|title=How The Hot 100 Became America's Hit Barometer|work=[[NPR]]|date=2013-08-01|accessdate=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s, a growing trend in the music industry was to promote songs to radio without ever releasing them as singles. It was claimed by major record labels that singles were cannibalizing album sales, so they were slowly phased out. During this period, accusations began to fly of chart manipulation as labels would hold off on releasing a single until airplay was at its absolute peak, thus prompting a top ten or, in some cases, a number one debut. In many cases, a label would delete a single from its catalog after only one week, thus allowing the song to enter the Hot 100, make a high debut and then slowly decline in position as the one-time production of the retail single sold out.

It was during this period that several popular mainstream hits never charted on the Hot 100, or charted well after their airplay had declined. During the period that they were not released as singles, the songs were not eligible to chart. Many of these songs dominated the ''Hot 100 Airplay'' chart for extended periods of time:

* 1995 [[The Rembrandts]]: "[[I'll Be There for You (The Rembrandts song)|I'll Be There for You]]" (number one for eight weeks)
* 1996 [[No Doubt]]: "[[Don't Speak]]" (number one for 16 weeks)
* 1997 [[Sugar Ray]] featuring [[Super Cat]]: "[[Fly (Sugar Ray song)|Fly]]" (number one for six weeks)
* 1997 [[Will Smith]]: "[[Men in Black (song)|Men in Black]]" (number one for four weeks)
* 1997 [[The Cardigans]]: "[[Lovefool]]" (number two for eight weeks)
* 1998 [[Natalie Imbruglia]]: "[[Torn (Ednaswap song)#Natalie Imbruglia version|Torn]]" (number one for 11 weeks)
* 1998 [[Goo Goo Dolls]]: "[[Iris (Goo Goo Dolls song)|Iris]]" (number one for 18 weeks)

As debate and conflicts occurred more and more often, ''Billboard'' finally answered the requests of music industry artists and insiders by including airplay-only singles (or "album cuts") in the Hot 100.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== EPs ===

[[Extended play]] (EP) releases were listed by ''Billboard'' on the Hot 100 and in pre-Hot 100 charts (Top 100) until the mid-to-late 1960s. With the growing popularity of albums, it was decided to move EPs (which typically contain four to six tracks) from the Hot 100 to the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], where they are included to this day.

=== Digital downloads and online streaming ===
Since February 12, 2005, the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 tracks paid digital downloads from such internet services as [[iTunes Store|iTunes]], [[Musicmatch]], and [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]]. ''Billboard'' initially started tracking downloads in 2003 with the [[Hot Digital Tracks]] chart. However, these downloads did not count towards the Hot 100 and that chart (as opposed to [[Hot Digital Songs]]) counted each version of a song separately (the chart still exists today along with Hot Digital Songs). This was the first major overhaul of the Hot 100's chart formula since December 1998.

The change in methodology has shaken up the chart considerably, with some songs debuting on the chart strictly with robust online sales and others making drastic leaps. In recent years, several songs have been able to achieve 80-to-90 position jumps in a single week as their digital components were made available at online music stores. Since 2006, the all-time record for the biggest single-week upward movement was broken nine times.

In the issue dated August 11, 2007, Billboard began incorporating weekly data from [[streaming media]] and on-demand services into the Hot 100. The first two major companies to provide their statistics to Nielsen BDS on a weekly basis were [[AOL]] Music and [[Yahoo! Music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Geoff |last=Mayfield |title=Billboard Hot 100 To Include Digital Streams |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1050326/billboard-hot-100-to-include-digital-streams |work=Billboard |date=August 4, 2007 |accessdate=July 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 24, 2012, Billboard premiered its [[On-Demand Songs]] chart, and its data was incorporated into the equation that compiles the Hot 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/502020/hot-100-impacted-by-new-on-demand-songs-chart|work=Billboard|title=Hot 100 Impacted by New On-Demand Songs Chart|first=Gary|last=Trust|date=March 14, 2012|accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was expanded to a broader [[Streaming Songs]] chart in January 2013, which ranks web radio streams from services such as [[Spotify]], as well as on-demand audio titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1510640/new-danceelectronic-songs-chart-launches-with-william-britney-at-no-1|work=Billboard|title=New Dance/Electronic Songs Chart Launches With Will.i.am &amp; Britney at No. 1|first=Silvio|last=Pietroluongo|date=January 17, 2013|accessdate=February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, U.S. views for a song on [[YouTube]] were added to the Hot 100 formula. "[[Harlem Shake (song)|Harlem Shake]]" was the first song to reach number one after the changes were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sisario|first=Ben|title=What's Billboard's No. 1?

=== Remixes ===

A growing trend in the early first decade of the 21st century was to issue a song as a "remix" that was so drastically different in structure and lyrical content from its original version that it was essentially a whole new song. Under normal circumstances, airplay points from a song's album version, "radio" mix and/or [[dance music]] remix, etc. were all combined and factored into the song's performance on the Hot 100, as the structure, lyrics and melody remained intact. Criticisms began when songs were being completely re-recorded to the point that they no longer resembled the original recording. The first such example of this scenario is [[Jennifer Lopez]]' "[[I'm Real (Jennifer Lopez song)|I'm Real]]". Originally entering the Hot 100 in its album version, a "remix" was issued in the midst of its chart run that featured rapper [[Ja Rule]]. This new version proved to be far more popular than
the album version and the track was propelled to number one.

To address this issue, Billboard now separates airplay points from a song's original version and its remix, if the remix is determined to be a "new song". Since administering this new chart rule, several songs have charted twice, normally credited as "Part 1" and "Part 2". The remix rule is still in place.

=== Recurrents ===

''Billboard'', in an effort to allow the chart to remain as current as possible and to give proper representation to new and developing artists and tracks, has (since 1991) removed titles that have reached certain criteria regarding its current rank and number of weeks on the chart. Recurrent criteria have been modified several times and currently ({{as of|2015|lc=y}}), a song is permanently moved to "recurrent status" if it has spent 20 weeks on the Hot 100 and fallen below position number 50. Additionally, descending songs are removed from the chart if ranking below number 25 after 52 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6770427/adele-tops-hot-100-fourth-week-justin-bieber-alessia-cara|work=Billboard|title=Adele Tops Hot 100 for Fourth Week; Justin Bieber, Alessia Cara Hit Top 10|first=Gary|last=Trust|date=November 23, 2015|accessdate=November 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exceptions are made to re-releases and sudden resurgence in popularity of tracks that have taken a very long time to gain mainstream success. These rare cases are handled on a case-by-case basis and ultimately determined by ''Billboard'''s chart managers and staff.

===Adjustment of tracking week===
''Billboard'' altered its tracking-week for sales, streaming and radio airplay in order to conform to a new Global Release Date, which now falls on Fridays in all major-market territories (United States product was formerly released on Tuesdays prior to June 2015).  This modified tracking schedule took effect in the issue dated July 25, 2015.&lt;ref name="tracking"/&gt;

== Year-end charts ==

''Billboard'''s "chart year" runs from the first week of December to the final week in November. This altered calendar allows for ''Billboard'' to calculate [[Billboard Year-End|year-end charts]] and release them in time for its final print issue in the last week of December.

Prior to Nielsen SoundScan, year-end singles charts were calculated by an inverse-point system based solely on a song's performance on the Hot 100 (for example, a song would be given one point for a week spent at position 100, two points for a week spent at position 99 and so forth, up to 100 points for each week spent at number one). Other factors including the total weeks a song spent on the chart and at its peak position were calculated into its year-end total.

After ''Billboard'' began obtaining sales and airplay information from Nielsen SoundScan, the year-end charts are now calculated by a very straightforward cumulative total of yearlong sales, streaming, and airplay points. This gives a more accurate picture of any given year's most popular tracks, as the points accrued by one song during its week at number one in March might be less than those accrued by another song reaching number three in January. Songs at the peak of their popularity at the time of the November/December chart-year cutoff many times end up ranked on the following year's chart as well, as their cumulative points are split between the two chart-years, but often are ranked lower than they would have been had the peak occurred in a single year.

== Use in media ==

The Hot 100 served for many years as the data source for the weekly radio countdown show ''[[American Top 40]]''. This relationship ended on November 30, 1991, as ''American Top 40'' started using the [[Billboard Hot 100 Airplay|airplay-only side of the Hot 100]] (then called '''Top 40 Radio Monitor'''). The ongoing splintering of [[Contemporary hit radio|Top 40 radio]] in the early 1990s led stations to lean into specific formats, meaning that practically no station would play the wide array of genres that typically composed each weekly Hot 100 chart.

== Similar charts ==

A new chart, the [[Pop 100]], was created by ''Billboard'' in February 2005 to answer criticism that the Hot 100 was biased in favor of [[Rhythmic Top 40|rhythmic]] songs, as throughout most of its existence, the Hot 100 was seen predominantly as a pop chart. It was discontinued in June 2009 due to the charts becoming increasingly similar.

The [[Canadian Hot 100]] was launched June 16, 2007. Like the Hot 100 chart, it uses sales and airplay tracking compiled by Nielsen SoundScan and [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems|BDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Billboard Launches Canadian Hot 100 Chart | url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1051685/billboard-launches-canadian-hot-100-chart | work = Billboard | date = June 7, 2007 | accessdate = June 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Japan Hot 100]] was launched in the issue dated May 31, 2008, using the same methodologies as the Hot 100 charts for the U.S. and Canada, using sales and airplay data from SoundScan Japan and radio tracking service Plantech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Gary | last = Trust | title = Billboard Japan Hot 100 Finds Global Audience | url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1045309/billboard-japan-hot-100-finds-global-audience | work = Billboard | date = May 21, 2008 | accessdate = June 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33844">'''Brain morphometry''' is a subfield of both [[morphometry]] and the [[brain science]]s, concerned with the measurement of [[brain]] structures and changes thereof during [[brain development|development]], aging, learning, disease and [[brain evolution|evolution]]. Since [[autopsy]]-like dissection is generally impossible on living [[brain]]s, brain morphometry starts with noninvasive [[neuroimaging]] data, typically obtained from [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (or MRI for short). These data are [[born digital]], which allows researchers to analyze the brain images further by using advanced mathematical and statistical methods such as shape quantification or [[multivariate analysis]]. This allows researchers to quantify anatomical features of the brain in terms of shape, mass, volume (e.g. of the [[hippocampus]], or of the primary versus secondary [[visual cortex]]), and to derive more specific information, such as the [[encephalization quotient]], grey matter density and white matter connectivity, [[gyrification]], cortical thickness, or the amount of [[cerebrospinal fluid]]. These variables can then be [[brain mapping|mapped]] within the brain volume or on the brain surface, providing a convenient way to assess their pattern and extent over time, across individuals or even between different [[biological species]]. The field is rapidly evolving along with neuroimaging techniques &amp;mdash; which deliver the underlying data &amp;mdash; but also develops in part independently from them, as part of the emerging field of [[neuroinformatics]], which is concerned with developing and adapting [[algorithm]]s to analyze those data.

==Background==

===Terminology===
The term [[brain mapping]] is often used interchangeably with brain morphometry, although ''mapping'' in the narrower sense of [[map projection|projecting]] properties of the brain onto a template brain is, strictly speaking, only a subfield of brain morphometry. On the other hand, though much more rarely, neuromorphometry is also sometimes used as a synonym for brain morphometry (particularly in the earlier literature, e.g. [[CZ:Ref:Haug 1986 History of neuromorphometry|Haug 1986]]), though technically is only one of its subfields.

===Biology===
The morphology and function of a complex [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] like the brain are the result of numerous [[biochemical]] and [[biophysical]] processes interacting in a highly complex manner across multiple scales in space and time ([[CZ:Ref:Vallender 2008 Genetic basis of human brain evolution|Vallender et al., 2008]]). Most of the genes known to control these processes during [[brain development]], [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|maturation]] and [[aging]] are highly [[conservation (biology)|conserved]] ([[CZ:Ref:Holland 2003 Early central nervous system evolution: an era of skin brains?|Holland, 2003]]), though some show [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]s (cf. [[CZ:Ref:Meda 2008 Polymorphism of DCDC2 Reveals Differences in Cortical Morphology of Healthy Individuals—A Preliminary Voxel Based Morphometry Study|Meda et al., 2008]]), and pronounced differences at the cognitive level abound even amongst closely related [[species]], or between individuals within a species ([[CZ:Ref:Roth 2005 Evolution of the brain and intelligence|Roth and Dicke, 2005]]).

In contrast, variations in [[macroscopic]] brain anatomy (i.e., at a level of detail still discernible by the naked [[human eye]]) are sufficiently conserved to allow for [[comparative bullet-lead analysis|comparative analyses]], yet diverse enough to reflect variations within and between individuals and species: As morphological analyses that compare brains at different onto-genetic or pathogenic stages can reveal important information about the progression of normal or abnormal development within a given species, cross-species comparative studies have a similar potential to reveal evolutionary trends and phylogenetic relationships.

Given that the imaging modalities commonly employed for brain morphometric investigations are essentially of a molecular or even sub-atomic nature, a number of factors may interfere with
derived quantification of brain structures. These include all of the parameters mentioned in "Applications" but also the state of hydration, hormonal status, medication and substance abuse.

===Technical requirements===
There are two major prerequisites for brain morphometry: First, the brain features of interest must be measurable, and second, statistical methods have to be in place to compare the measurements quantitatively. Shape feature comparisons form the basis of [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaean]] taxonomy, and even in cases of [[convergent evolution]] or [[brain disorders]], they still provide a wealth of information about the nature of the processes involved. Shape comparisons have long been constrained to simple and mainly volume- or slice-based measures but profited enormously from the digital revolution, as now all sorts of shapes in any number of dimensions can be handled numerically.

In addition, though the extraction of morphometric parameters like brain mass or [[liquor]] volume may be relatively straightforward in [[post mortem]] samples, most studies in living subjects will by necessity have to use an indirect approach: A spatial representation of the brain or its components is obtained by some appropriate [[neuroimaging]] technique, and the parameters of interest can then be analyzed on that basis. Such a structural representation of the brain is also a prerequisite for the interpretation of [[fMRI|functional]] [[neuroimaging]].

The design of a brain morphometric study depends on multiple factors that can be roughly categorized as follows: First, depending on whether ontogenetic, pathological or phylogenetic issues are targeted, the study can be designed as [[longitudinal study|longitudinal]] (within the same brain, measured at different times), or [[cross-sectional study|cross-sectional]] (across brains). Second, brain image data can be acquired using different [[neuroimaging]]  modalities. Third, brain properties can be analyzed at different scales (e.g. in the whole brain, [[region of interest|regions of interest]], cortical or subcortical structures). Fourth, the data can be subjected to different kinds of processing and analysis steps. Brain morphometry as a discipline is mainly concerned with the development of tools addressing this fourth point and integration with the previous ones.

==Methodologies==
With the exception of the usually slice-based [[histology]] of the brain, neuroimaging data are generally stored as [[matrix (biology)|matrices]] of [[voxel]]s. The most popular morphometric method, thus, is known as [[Voxel-based morphometry]] (VBM; cf. [[CZ:Ref:Wright 1995 A Voxel-Based Method for the Statistical Analysis of Gray and White Matter Density Applied to Schizophrenia|Wright et al., 1995]]; [[CZ:Ref:Ashburner 2000 Voxel-Based Morphometry—The Methods|Ashburner and Friston, 2000]]; [[CZ:Ref:Good 2001 A Voxel-Based Morphometric Study of Ageing in 465 Normal Adult Human Brains|Good et al., 2001]]). Yet as an imaging voxel is not a biologically meaningful unit, other approaches have been developed that potentially bear a closer correspondence to biological structures: Deformation-based morphometry (DBM), surface-based morphometry (SBM) and fiber tracking based on [[diffusion-weighted imaging]] (DTI or DSI). All four are usually performed based on [[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging]] data, with the former three commonly using [[T1 relaxation (NMR)|T1]]-weighted (e.g. Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo, MP-RAGE) and sometimes T2-weighted [[pulse sequence (NMR)|pulse sequences]], while DTI/DSI use [[diffusion]]-weighted ones. However, recent evaluation of morphometry algorithms/software demonstrates inconsistency among several of them.&lt;ref name=Gao&gt;Gao, Y., Riklin-Raviv, T., &amp; Bouix, S. "Shape analysis, a field in need of careful validation" [[Human Brain Mapping (journal)]] 2014 &lt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.22525/abstract&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This renders a need for systematic and quantitative validation and evaluation of the field.

===T1-weighted MR-based brain morphometry===
{{main|Magnetic Resonance Imaging}}

====Preprocessing====
{{main|Image registration}}
MR images are generated by a complex interaction between static and dynamic electromagnetic fields and the tissue of interest, namely the brain that is encapsulated in the head of the subject. Hence, the raw images contain noise from various sources—namely head movements (a scan suitable for morphometry typically takes on the order of 10 min) that can hardly be corrected or modeled, and bias fields (neither of the electromagnetic fields involved is homogeneous across the whole head nor brain) which can be modeled.

In the following, the image is segmented into non-brain and brain tissue, with the latter usually being sub-segmented into at least gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Since
image voxels near the class boundaries do not generally contain just one kind of tissue, partial volume effects ensue that can be corrected for.

For comparisons across different scans (within or across subjects), differences in brain size and shape are eliminated by spatially normalizing (i.e. registering) the individual images to the stereotactic space of a template brain.
Registration can be performed using low-resolution (i.e. rigid-body or [[affine transformations]]) or high-resolution (i.e. highly non-linear) methods, and templates can be generated from the study's pool of brains, from a [[brain atlas]] or a derived [[template generator]].

Both the registered images and the deformation fields generated upon registration can be used for morphometric analyses, thereby providing the basis for Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) and Deformation-Based Morphometry (DBM). Images segmented into tissue classes can also be used to convert segmentation boundaries into parametric surfaces, the analysis of which is the focus of Surface-Based Morphometry (SBM).

====Voxel-based morphometry====
{{main|Voxel-based morphometry}}
After the individual images are segmented, they are [[image registration|registered]] to the template. Each voxel then contains a measure of the probability, according to which it belongs to a specific segmentation class. For gray matter, this quantity is usually referred to as gray matter density (GMD) or gray matter concentration (GMC), or gray matter probability (GMP).

In order to correct for the volume changes due to the registration, the gray matter volume (GMV) in the original brain can be calculated by multiplying the GMD with the Jacobian determinants of the deformations used to register the brain to the template.  Class-specific volumes for WM and CSF are defined analogously.

The local differences in the density or volume of the different segmentation classes can then be statistically analyzed across scans and interpreted in anatomical terms (e.g. as gray matter atrophy). Since VBM is available for many of the major neuroimaging software packages (e.g. [[FMRIB Software Library|FSL]] and [[Statistical parametric mapping|SPM]]), it provides an efficient tool to test or generate specific hypotheses about brain changes over time. It is noteworthy, that unlike DBM, considerable criticism and words of caution regarding the correct interpretation of VBM results has been leveled by the medical image computing community &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deformation-based morphometry====
In DBM, highly non-linear registration algorithms are used, and the statistical analyses are not performed on the registered voxels but on the deformation fields used to register them (which requires multivariate approaches) or derived scalar properties thereof, which allows for univariate approaches. One common variant—sometimes referred to as Tensor-based morphometry (TBM)&amp;mdash;is based on the [[Jacobian determinant]] of the deformation matrix.

Of course, multiple solutions exist for such non-linear warping procedures, and to balance appropriately between the potentially opposing requirements for global and local shape fit, ever more sophisticated registration algorithms are being developed. Most of these, however, are computationally expensive if applied with a high-resolution grid. The biggest advantage of DBM with respect to VBM is its ability to detect subtle changes in longitudinal studies. However, due to the vast variety of registration algorithms, no widely accepted standard for DBM exists, which also prevented its incorporation into major neuroimaging software packages.

====Pattern based morphometry====

Pattern based morphometry (PBM) is a method of brain morphometry first put forth in PBM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

 | pmc=4373081
| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21995061}}&lt;/ref&gt; It builds  upon DBM and VBM. PBM is based on the application of sparse dictionary learning to morphometry. As opposed to typical voxel based approaches which depend on univariate statistical tests at specific voxel locations, PBM extracts multivariate patterns directly from the entire image. The advantage of this is that the inferences are not made locally as in VBM or DBM but globally. This allows the method to detect if combinations of voxels are better suited to separate the groups being studied rather than single voxels. Also the method is more robust to variations in the underlying registration algorithms as compared to typical DBM analysis

====Surface-based morphometry====
{{main|Surface-based morphometry}}
Once the brain is segmented, the boundary between different classes of tissue can be [[surface reconstruction|reconstructed as a surface]] on which morphometric analysis can proceed (e.g. towards [[gyrification]]), or onto which results of such analyses can be [[brain mapping|projected]].

===Diffusion-weighted MR-based brain morphometry===

====Fiber-tracking techniques====
Nerve fiber-tracking techniques are the latest offspring of this suite of MR-based morphological approaches. They determine the tract of [[nerve fiber]]s within the brain by means of [[diffusion tensor imaging]] or [[diffusion-spectrum imaging]] (e.g. [[CZ:Ref:Douaud 2007 Anatomically related grey and white matter abnormalities in adolescent-onset schizophrenia|Douaud et al., 2007]] and [[CZ:Ref:O'Donnell 2009 Tract-based morphometry for white matter group analysis|O'Donnell et al., 2009]]).

==Applications==
The qualitatively largest changes within an individual generally occur during early development and more subtle ones during aging and learning, while pathological changes can vary highly in their extent and interindividual differences increase both during and across lifetimes. The above-described morphometric methods provide the means to analyze such changes quantitatively, and MR imaging has been applied to ever more brain populations relevant to these time scales, both within humans and across species.
Currently, however, most applications of MR-based brain morphometry have a clinical focus, i.e. they help to diagnose and monitor neuropsychiatric disorders, in particular neurodegenerative diseases (like Alzheimer) or psychotic disorders (like schizophrenia).

===Brain development===
{{main|Brain development}}
MR imaging is rarely performed during pregnancy and the neonatal period, in order to avoid stress for mother and child. In the cases of birth complications and other clinical events, however, such data are being acquired. For instance, [[CZ:Ref:Dubois 2008 Primary cortical folding in the human newborn: an early marker of later functional development|Dubois et al., 2008]] analyzed gyrification in premature newborns at birth and found it to be predictive of a functional score at term-equivalent age, and Serag et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.09.062 | last1 = Serag | first1 = A. | last2 = Aljabar | first2 = P. | last3 = Ball | first3 = G. | year = 2012 | last4 = Counsell | first4 = S.J. | last5 = Boardman | first5 = J.P. | last6 = Rutherford | first6 = M.A. | last7 = Edwards | first7 = A.D. | last8 = Hajnal | first8 = J.V. | last9 = Rueckert | first9 = D. | title = Construction of a consistent high-definition spatio-temporal atlas of the developing brain using adaptive kernel regression | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811911011360 | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 59 | issue = 3| pages = 2255–2265 | pmid=21985910 }}&lt;/ref&gt; built a 4D atlas of the developing neonatal brain which has led to the construction of brain growth curves from 28–44 weeks’ postmenstrual age. Beyond preterms, there have been a number of large-scale longitudinal MR-morphometric studies (often combined with cross-sectional approaches and other neuroimaging modalities) of normal brain development in humans&lt;!--, most notably by
\citet{Giedd:1999p24137} and \citet{Thompson:2000p55997} and, more recently, by
\citet{Evans:2006p33597} and \citet{Almli:2007p24135}--&gt;.
Using voxel-based and a number of complementary approaches, these studies revealed (or non-invasively confirmed, from the perspective of previous histological studies which cannot be longitudinal) that brain maturation involves differential growth of gray and white matter, that the time course of the maturation is not linear and that it differs markedly across brain regions&lt;!--For reviews of MR morphometric studies of brain maturation, see \citet[][focused on adolescence]{Paus:2005p1501} and \citet[][from early development onto adolescence]{Toga:2006p816,Lenroot:2006p56183}--&gt;. In order to interpret these findings, cellular processes have to be taken into consideration, especially those governing the pruning of axons, dendrites and synapses until an adult pattern of whole-brain connectivity is achieved (which can best be monitored using diffusion-weighted techniques).

===Aging===
{{main|Aging}}
While white matter increases throughout early development and adolescence, and gray matter decreases in that period generally do not involve neuronal cell bodies, the situation is different beyond the age of about 50 years when atrophy affects gray and possibly also white matter. The most convincing explanation for this is that individual neurons die, leading to the loss of both their cell bodies (i.e. gray matter) and their myelinated axons (i.e. white matter). The gray matter changes can be observed via both gray matter density and gyrification.
That the white matter loss is not nearly as clear as that for gray matter indicates that changes also occur in non-neural tissue, e.g. the vasculature or microglia.

===Learning and plasticity===
{{main|Brain plasticity}}

Perhaps the most profound impact to date of brain morphometry on our understanding of the relationships between brain structure and function has been provided by a series of VBM studies targeted at proficiency in various performances: Licensed [[taxicab]] drivers in [[London]] were found to exhibit bilaterally increased gray matter volume in the posterior part of the [[hippocampus]], both relative to controls from the general population&lt;!-- \citep{Maguire:2000p10353}--&gt; and to London [[bus]] drivers matched for driving experience and [[Workplace stress|stress]] levels. Similarly, gray matter changes were also found to correlate with professional experience in musicians, mathematicians and meditators, and with second language proficiency.

What is more, bilateral gray matter changes in the posterior and lateral parietal cortex of medical students memorizing for an intermediate exam could be detected over a period of just three months.

These studies of professional training inspired questions about the limits of MR-based morphometry in terms of time periods over which structural brain changes can be detected. Important determinants of these limits are the speed and spatial extent of the changes themselves. Of course, some events like accidents, a stroke, a tumor metastasis or a surgical intervention can profoundly change brain structure during very short periods, and these changes can be visualized with MR and other neuroimaging techniques. Given the time constraints under such conditions, brain morphometry is rarely involved in diagnostics but rather used for progress monitoring over periods of weeks and months and longer.

One study found that [[juggling]] novices showed a bilateral gray matter expansion in the medial temporal visual area (also known as V5) over a three-month period during which they had learned to sustain a three-ball cascade for at least a minute. No changes were observed in a control group that did not engage in juggling. The extent of these changes in the jugglers reduced during a subsequent three-month period in which they did not practice juggling. To further resolve the time course of these changes, the experiment was repeated with another young cohort scanned in shorter intervals, and the by then typical changes in V5 could already be found after just seven days of juggling practice. The observed changes were larger in the initial learning phase than during continued training.

Whereas the former two studies involved students in their early twenties, the experiments were recently repeated with an elderly cohort, revealing the same kind of structural changes, although attenuated by lower juggling performance of this group&lt;!-- \citep{Boyke:2008p2916}--&gt;.

Using a completely different kind of intervention—application of [[Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation]] in daily sessions over five days—changes were observed in and near the TMS target areas as well as in the basal ganglia of volunteers in their mid-twenties, compared to a control group that had received placebo. It is possible, though, that these changes simply reflect vascularization effects.

Taken together, these morphometric studies strongly support the notion that brain plasticity—changes of brain structure—remains possible throughout life and may well be an adaptation to changes in brain function which has also been shown to change with experience. The title of this section was meant to emphasize this, namely that plasticity and learning provide two perspectives—functional and structural—at the same phenomenon, a brain that changes over time.

*Schizophrenia: [[CZ:Ref:DeLisi 2008 The concept of progressive brain change in schizophrenia: implications for understanding schizophrenia|DeLisi, 2008]]--&gt;
Brain diseases are the field to which brain morphometry is most often applied, and the volume of the literature on this is vast.&lt;!--: For chronic schizophrenics alone, 19 VBM studies were recently reviewed by \citet{Williams:2008p37722}, and a review of our current understanding of schizophrenia makes heavy use of brain morphometric findings \citep{DeLisi:2008p50751}. The situation is similar for Alzheimer's disease \citep{Thompson:2007p56177,Davatzikos:2008p56176,Apostolova:2007p27177,Kloppel:2008p1736} and other neuropsychiatric disorders \citep{mazziotta2000bmd,Gordon:2002p56173,Toga:2003p51833}.--&gt;
&lt;!--
MR-based morphometry of gyrification is gaining importance for clinical diagnostics, precisely because the cortical folding pattern is very stable throughout adult life in non-patient populations \citep{Armstrong:1995p34795}. This means that a deviation from normal gyrification rates has a high probability to indicate a brain disorder. As a result, a number of reports have been published that found abnormal gyrification in a variety of disorders, including schizophrenia \citep{White:2003p24440}, autism \citep{Hardan:2004p33458}, dyslexia \citep{Casanova:2004p33457}, velocardiofacial syndrome \citep{Bearden:2009p23839}, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder \citep{Wolosin:2009p43217} or Williams syndrome \citep{VanEssen:2006p56254,Gaser:2006p1229}.--&gt;

===Brain evolution===

Brain changes also accumulate over periods longer than an individual life but even though twin studies have established that human brain structure is highly heritable, brain morphometric studies with such a broadened scope are rare.
However, in the context of disorders with a known or suspected hereditary component, a number of studies have compared the brain morphometry of patients with both that of non-affected controls and that of subjects at high risk for developing the disorder. The latter group usually includes family members.

Even larger time gaps can be bridged by comparing human populations with a sufficiently long history of genetic separation, such as Central Europeans and Japanese. One surface-based study compared the brain shape between these two groups and found a difference in their gender-dependent brain asymmetries&lt;!-- \citep{Zilles:2001p1468}--&gt;. Neuroimaging studies of this kind, combined with functional ones and behavioural data, provide promising and so far largely unexplored avenues to understand similarities and differences between different groups of people&lt;!-- \citep{Rilling:2008p25224}--&gt;.

Like morphological analyses that compare brains at different ontogenetic or pathogenetic stages can reveal important information about normal or abnormal development within a given species, cross-species comparative studies have a similar potential to reveal evolutionary trends and phylogenetic relationships. Indeed, shape comparisons (though historically with an emphasis on qualitative criteria) formed the basis of biological taxonomy before the era of genetics.
Three principal sources exist for comparative evolutionary investigations: Fossils, fresh-preserved post-mortem or [[in vivo]] studies.

The fossil record is dominated by structures that were already biomineralized during the lifetime of the respective organism (in the case of vertebrates,  mainly teeth and bones).
Brains, like other soft tissues, rarely fossilize, but occasionally they do. The probably oldest vertebrate brain known today belonged to a ratfish that lived around 300 million years ago ([[CZ:Ref:Pradel 2009 Skull and brain of a 300-million-year-old chimaeroid fish revealed by synchrotron holotomography|Pradel et al., 2009]]). While the technique most widely used to image fossils is [[computed tomography]] (CT), this particular specimen was imaged by [[synchrotron tomography]], and recent MR imaging studies with fossils suggest that the method may be used to image at least a subset of fossilized brains.

MR images have also been obtained from the brain of a 3200-year-old [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[mummy]]. The perspectives are slim, however, that any three-dimensional imaging dataset of a fossil, semi-fossil or mummified brain will ever be of much use to morphometric analyses of the kind described here, since the processes of mummification and fossilization heavily alter the structure of soft tissues in a way specific to the individual specimen and subregions therein.

Postmortem samples of living or recently extinct species, on the other hand, generally allow to obtain MR image qualities sufficient for morphometric analyses, though preservation artifacts would have to be taken into account. Previous MR imaging studies include specimens
preserved in formalin,&lt;!-- \citep[][human and elephant brains]{Pfefferbaum:2004p4074,Hakeem:2005p39953}, --&gt;
by freezing &lt;!--\citep[][kiwi brains]{Corfield:2008p45053} --&gt;
or in alcohol &lt;!--\citep[][carps]{Chanet:2009p51744}--&gt;.

The third line of comparative evidence would be cross-species in vivo MR imaging studies like the one by Rilling &amp; Insel (1998), who investigated brains from eleven primate species by VBM in order to shed new light on primate brain evolution.
Other studies have combined morphometric with behavioural measures, and brain evolution does not only concern primates: Gyrification occurs across mammalian brains if they reach a size of several centimeters&amp;mdash;with cetaceans dominating the upper end of the spectrum&amp;mdash;and generally increases slowly with overall brain size, following a power law.

'''''Brut y Brenhinedd''''' ("Chronicle of the Kings")&lt;ref&gt;Alternative titles include "''Ystoria Brutus''" and "''Ystorya Brenhined y Brytanyeit''".&lt;/ref&gt; is a collection of variant [[Middle Welsh]] versions of [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s Latin ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''. About 60 versions survive, with the earliest dating to the mid-13th century. Adaptations of Geoffrey's ''Historia'' were extremely popular throughout Western Europe during the Middle Ages, but the ''Brut'' proved especially influential in medieval [[Wales]], where it was largely regarded as an accurate account of the early history of the [[Celtic Britons]].

==Geoffrey's ''Historia'' and the ''Brut y Brenhinedd''==
Geoffrey's ''Historia Regum Britanniae'' (completed by {{circa|lk=no|1139}}) purports to narrate the history of the [[list of legendary kings of Britain|Kings of Britain]] from its eponymous founder [[Brutus of Troy]] to [[Cadwaladr]], the last in the line. Geoffrey professed to have based his history on "a certain very ancient book" written in ''britannicus sermo'' (the "British tongue", i.e. [[Common Brittonic]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]] or [[Breton language|Breton]]) which he had received from [[Walter of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey of Monmouth, ''Histora Regum Britanniae'': dedication and 7.11.&lt;/ref&gt; It became one of the most popular works in the medieval West, but its impact was particularly profound and enduring in Wales, where the ''Historia'' was accepted as a largely authentic and authoritative account.&lt;ref name="Roberts, Celtic Culture"&gt;Roberts, "''Brut y Brenhinedd''".&lt;/ref&gt; The influence is most clearly evidenced by the existence of several translations into Welsh from the 13th century onwards, usually known as ''Brut y Brenhinedd''. The manuscript history of these texts is a rich and long one attesting to the production of several translations and new redactions, most of which were copied many times over.

The Welsh renderings are not straightforward translations in the modern sense, but by contemporary standards, they are generally close to their Latin source text, with only some commentary or additional material from bardic traditional lore (''cyfarwydd'') appended to the text.&lt;ref name="Roberts, Celtic Culture" /&gt; Importantly, several manuscripts include a version of the tale known as ''[[Lludd and Llefelys]]'' inserted in the segment about [[Lludd Llaw Eraint]]; the presence or absence of this tale has been used to classify the early versions of the ''Brut''.&lt;ref name="Bromwich416"&gt;Bromwich, ''Triads''. p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; One notable area in which Welsh translators have corrected or adapted Geoffrey based on native traditions is that of personal names and sobriquets. Geoffrey's "Hely", for instance, was substituted for [[Beli Mawr]], an ancestor figure who also appears in ''[[Branwen ferch Llŷr]]'' and elsewhere in Middle Welsh literature.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, "The Celtic Lands". p. 289. See further Roberts, "Treatment of personal names" and J. T. Koch, "A Welsh Window on the Iron Age".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==
There are about sixty attestations of the Welsh ''Brut'' in the manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Griscom (ed.), ''The Historia regum Britanniæ of Geoffrey of Monmouth''. pp. 585-99; Evans, ''Grammar of Middle Welsh''. xxxiv; Koch, "The Celtic Lands". p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brynley F. Roberts]], citing J.J. Parry and his own examination of the texts, places all the existing versions into six variant classes: 1) Dingestow MS., 2) Peniarth 44, 3) Llanstephan 1, 4) Peniarth 21, 5) [[List of manuscripts in the Cotton library#Cleopatra|Cotton Cleopatra]] B. v, and 6) the ''Brut Tysilio''.&lt;ref&gt;The following overview is based on Roberts, ''Brut y Brenhinedd'' xxiv-xxxix. Some years before Roberts, Evans noted the existence of at least three separate versions, ''Grammar of Middle Welsh''. xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

===13th century===
*1. The ''Brut'' in [[National Library of Wales|NLW]], Llanstephan MS 1 (mid-13th century), is a relatively close translation of Geoffrey's ''Historia''.
*2. The ''Brut'' in NLW, Peniarth MS 44 (mid-13th century). This text becomes increasingly more condensed towards the end, omitting [[Merlin]]'s prophecy in the process on stated grounds that it lacks credibility. Yet it has the distinct quality of being the first ''Brut'' to incorporate the tale ''[[Lludd and Llefelys]]''.
*3. ''Brut Dingestow'' (later in the 13th century), now in MS Aberystwyth, NLW 5266, once appears to have been in MS 6 of the [[Dingestow]] court collection, and may have originated in Gwynedd. Again, the text is a relatively faithful translation, aided by its occasional reliance on Llanstephan MS 1.

Of these three texts, it is Llanstephan MS 1 and ''Brut Dingestow'' which then came to provide the textual basis for many of the copies attested in other MSS from the 13th century onwards, such as Mostyn MS 117 and NLW Peniarth MS 16.

===14th century===
[[File:History of the Kings (f.18) Morgan and Cunedda.jpg|thumb|An illustration from Peniarth MS 23(f.18), Morgan and Cunedda]]
* Red Book of Hergest redaction. A revised version, presumably from south Wales, was produced which follows the Dingestow version up to the end of Merlin's prophecy, and continues with the Llanstephan 1 version.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, B. (1971) Brut y Brenhinedd (Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies), p.xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; Copied in numerous MSS, this conflated version is most famously represented by the text in the ''Llyfr Coch Hergest'' or [[Red Book of Hergest]]. In most every manuscript, it is preceded by the ''Ystorya Dared'', i.e. a Welsh translation of the ''De Excidio Troiae'' ascribed to [[Dares Phrygius]], and followed by the ''[[Brut y Tywysogion]]''. In this way, the text is made the central piece in a world history extending from the [[Trojan War]] up to events close to the redactors' own time. It seems that the ''Ystorya Dared'', which has no independent existence in the manuscripts, was specially composed to serve as its prologue.
*4. The ''Brut'' in NLW Peniarth MS 23 and elsewhere, a fresh and fairly close translation of Geoffrey's ''Historia''.
*5. The ''Brut'' in [[British Library|BL]] Cotton Cleopatra B. v, NLW MS 7006 ([[Black Book of Basingwerk]]) and elsewhere, appears to have circulated in north-east Wales. It represents a freer and more piquant version than was previously attempted and draws on some extraneous material, notably [[Wace]]'s ''[[Roman de Brut]]'' (a [[Norman language]] work which was in turn based on Geoffrey's ''Historia'') and a Latin chronology. In the manuscripts, it is sandwiched between the ''Ystorya Dared'' and the ''[[Brenhinoedd y Saeson]]'' (''Kings of the English''), a version of the ''Brut y Tywysogyon'' which incorporates material from English chronicles. Also included is a condensed version of the ''Lludd and Llefelys'' tale. This ''Brut'' is the version used for the Welsh historical compilation attributed to the late 15th-century poet [[Gutun Owain]], as well as for the ''Brut Tysilio''.

===14th or 15th century===
*6. ''Brut Tysilio''. Oxford, Jesus College MS 28, transcript from Jesus College MS 61 (14th or 15th century) made by Hugh Jones in 1695.&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.ox.ac.uk/show?collection=jesus&amp;manuscript=ms28 Brut Tysilio in Oxford, Jesus College MS 28].&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Brut Tysilio'' and Geoffrey's putative British source==
The version known as the ''Brut Tysilio'', attributed to the 7th-century Welsh saint [[Tysilio]], became more widely known when its text was published in ''[[The Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales]]'', a once-influential collection of Welsh literary material whose credibility has suffered due the involvement of the antiquarian forger [[Iolo Morganwg]], in 1801-1807. The editors did not place much faith in the attribution to Tysilio, using that title merely to distinguish it from another Welsh ''Brut'' entitled ''Brut Gruffudd ap Arthur'' (the chronicle of Geoffrey son of Arthur, an alternative name for Geoffrey of Monmouth). An English translation of the ''Brut Tysilio'' by Peter Roberts was published in 1811, and San Marte made a German translation of Roberts' English translation in 1854, making it available to non-specialists.&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Hazel Marie Le Saux, ''Layamon's Brut: the poem and its sources'', Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd, 1989, pp. 119-120.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the very end of the ''Brut Tysilio'' there appears a colophon ascribed to Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford, saying "I […] translated this book from the Welsh into Latin, and in my old age have again translated it from the Latin into Welsh."&lt;ref&gt;''Brut Tysilio'', tr. P. Roberts, ''The Chronicle of the kings of Britain''. p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, some took the ''Brut Tysilio'' to be, at one or more remove, the "very ancient book" that Geoffrey claimed to have translated from the "British tongue".&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Morgan, "Welsh Arthurian Literature", in Norris J. Lacy (ed.), ''A history of Arthurian scholarship'', Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2006, pp. 77-94&lt;/ref&gt; This claim was taken up by the archaeologist [[Flinders Petrie]], who argued in a paper presented to the [[Royal Society]] in 1917 that the ''Brut'' and the ''Historia Regum Britanniae'' were both derived from a hypothetical 10th-century version in [[Breton language|Breton]] and ultimately from material originating in [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times, and called for further study.&lt;ref name="petrie"&gt;[[Flinders Petrie]], "[[s:Neglected British History|Neglected British History]]", ''Proceedings of the British Academy'', Volume VIII, pp. 251-278.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, modern scholarship has established that all surviving Welsh variants are derivative of Geoffrey rather than the other way around.&lt;ref name="roberts"&gt;Roberts, ''Brut y Brenhinedd'', Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1971, pp. xxiv-xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts has shown the ''Brut Tysilio'' to be "an amalgam of versions", the earlier part deriving from Peniarth 44, and the later part abridged from Cotton Cleopatra. It survives in manuscripts dating from {{circa|lk=no|1500}}, and Roberts argues that a "textual study of the version […] shows that this is a late compilation, not different in essentials from other chronicles which were being composed in the fifteenth century".&lt;ref name="roberts" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8286">[[File:Cambon Letter.jpg|thumb|The Cambon Letter]]
The '''Cambon letter''' is a letter written on 4 June 1917 by [[Jules Cambon]], head of the political section of the French foreign ministry, to [[Zionist]] diplomat [[Nahum Sokolow]].  The letter expressed French Government sympathy for Jewish colonization in Palestine.  It is regarded as a politically essential precursor of the [[Balfour Declaration]].

==History==
On 11 March 1916, in a telegram to the Russian and French ambassadors,  [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] put forward a proposal that the Allies together issue a public declaration supporting Jewish aspirations in Palestine. Verete, in his account of the developments leading up to this proposal, explains, "here is the root and source of the pro-Zionist policy of British governments until the Balfour Declaration" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Balfour Declaration and Its Makers|first=Mayir |last=Vereté|authorlink=:he:מאיר ורטה|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|volume=6|issue=1|date=1970|pages=48–76|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd.|jstor=4282307|ref=harv|doi=10.1080/00263207008700138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Martin Kramer]] argues that securing the assent of Britain's French and American Allies, and of the Vatican, which controlled many Christian Holy Sites in the Land of Israel, was a necessary precondition for the Balfour Declaration.&lt;ref name="KramerInternationalLaw"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kramer|first1=Martin|title=How the Balfour Declaration Became Part of International Law|url=https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/2017/06/how-the-balfour-declaration-became-part-of-international-law/|accessdate=14 June 2017|publisher=[[Mosaic (magazine)|Mosaic]]|date=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both British diplomat [[Mark Sykes]] and French diplomat [[François Georges-Picot]] were in Petrograd at the time advising their ambassadors in the matter of securing Russian assent to the secret [[Sykes–Picot Agreement|Sykes-Picot Agreement]]  and its terms in regard to a future disposition of Palestine.  There was little enthusiasm for the proposal on the part of either the French or the Russians. Brecher gives an account of French motivations and attitude to the question during the war years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=French Policy toward the Levant|last=Brecher|first=F.W. |year=1993|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|volume=29|issue=4|pages=641–663|ref=harv|doi=10.1080/00263209308700971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were few developments until the change of government in Britain although the need for accommodation with the French, intent on sticking by the terms of Sykes-Picot, remained. In a memorandum dated 21 April 1917, Lord Cecil, who was deputizing for Lord Balfour as Foreign Secretary during the [[Balfour Mission]] to America,&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{citation|last=Friedman|first=Isaiah|title=The Question of Palestine: British-Jewish-Arab Relations, 1914-1918|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d0iR5mS_zckC&amp;pg=PA150|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-3868-9|pages=150–}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I quite recognise the very great difficult of carrying out the Zionist policy involving as it does a strong preference for a British protectorate over Palestine. That seems to me to make it the more desirable to get France to join us in an expression of sympathy for Jewish Nationalist aspirations.&lt;ref name="Sanders1984"&gt;{{citation|last=Sanders|first=Ronald|title=The high walls of Jerusalem: a history of the Balfour Declaration and the birth of the British mandate for Palestine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LBtAAAAMAAJ|date=January 1984|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|isbn=978-0-03-053971-8|page=507}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A trip to France and Italy had been organized for [[Mark Sykes]], who had been appointed earlier in the year to lead negotiations with the Zionists, and Zionist diplomat [[Nahum Sokolow]], during April and May 1917.  They secured the assent of [[Pope Benedict XV]] on 4 May 2017.&lt;ref name="KramerInternationalLaw"/&gt; Having met various French officials in April, they visited Italy and Sokolow secured the verbal support of [[Pope Benedict XV]] on 4 May 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Sokolow wrote a description of the meeting, which is held in the [[Central Zionist Archives]], but no record exists in the Vatican. {{cite book|last=Minerbi|first=Sergio I.|title=The Vatican and Zionism: Conflict in the Holy Land, 1895-1925|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pnor_YaNiSoC|year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-505892-5}}. Friedman sources the quote to "CZA, A 18/26, Report, dated 4 May 1917, on an interview with the Pope". The note of the conversation includes the following exchange:&lt;br&gt;"'''His holiness:''' I am sure you did not come only as a matter of ceremony but as a representative of the Zionist idea. That has great significance. It refers to the rebuilding of Judea by the Jewish people — is that not so? What a historical turnabout. Nineteen hundred years ago Rome destroyed your country, and now, wanting to rebuilt it, you come to Rome.&lt;br&gt;'''Sokolow:''' I am deeply moved by these historical memories, which are so apt. Allow me the liberty to add that the Rome that destroyed Judea was duly punished. It vanished, whereas not only do the Jewish people live on, they still have sufficient vitality to reclaim their land.&lt;br&gt;'''His holiness:''' Yes, yes, it is providential; God has willed it."&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|last=Minerbi|first=Sergio I.|title=The Vatican and Zionism: Conflict in the Holy Land, 1895-1925|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pnor_YaNiSoC|year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-505892-5|p=110|quote=The Vatican archives relating to this period do not contain any documents on these conversations, and as a result we are forced to rely solely on Sokolow’s account of his talks at the Vatican. These reports are necessarily subjective and more than once, contradict the policy adopted by the Holy See. It is not unlikely that on occasion Sokolow heard what he wanted to hear}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return to France, Sokolow was able to obtain the French commitment in written form, the Cambon letter, although it remained unpublished at the time.&lt;ref name="KramerInternationalLaw"/&gt;

Both Kramer and Kaufman gives more information as well as an analysis of the background and motivations for the Cambon letter and the post-Balfour Declaration  endorsement by Pichon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The French pro-Zionist declarations of 1917–1918|last=Kaufman|first=Edy |year=2006|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|volume=15|issue=3|pages=374–407|doi=10.1080/00263207908700418|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KramerInternationalLaw"/&gt;

==Text==
The letter states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You were good enough to present the project to which you are devoting your efforts, which has for its object the development of Jewish colonization in Palestine.You consider that,circumstances permitting,and the independence of the Holy Places being safeguarded on the other hand,it would be a deed of justice and of reparation to assist,by the protection of the Allied Powers,in the renaissance of the Jewish nationahty in that Land from which the people of Israel were exiled so many centuries ago.&lt;br&gt;
The French Government, which entered this present war to defend a people wrongfully attacked, and which continues the struggle to assure the victory of right over might, can but feel sympathy for your cause,the triumph of which is bound up with that of the Allies.&lt;br&gt;
I am happy to give you herewith such assurance.&lt;ref name="BalfourProject"&gt;{{cite web|title=French support for the Zionist cause in 1917|url=http://www.balfourproject.org/french-support-for-the-zionist-cause/|website=balfourproject.org|publisher=Balfour Project|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Software support ===

==== Flash ====

Web browsers cannot render Flash media themselves. Instead, Flash is primarily rendered via the [[proprietary software|proprietary]], but freely available, [[Adobe Flash Player]]. Until 2008, there was no official specification by which to create an alternative player. Alternative players have been developed before 2008, but they support Flash to a lesser degree than the official one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/manual/gnashref.html#runs-on |title=Gnash Reference Manual |publisher=Gnu.org |date=2008-05-18 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest version of the Adobe Flash Player runs on [[Microsoft Windows]], Apple [[macOS]], [[Research In Motion|RIM]], [[QNX]] and [[Google TV]].

Earlier versions run on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] 2.2-4.0.x (Flash has been released for 4.0, but Adobe announced that they will discontinue support for Android 4.1 and higher.&lt;ref name="Adobe Flash coming for ICS, not Android 5.0"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;) (Flash 11.2), GNU/[[Linux]] (Flash 11.2, except for Pepper Flash which is maintained and distributed by Google, not Adobe), [[PlayStation 3]] (Flash 9), [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] (Flash 6). [[Adobe Flash Lite]] runs on [[Wii]], [[Symbian]], [[Maemo]] Linux, [[Windows Mobile]], and [[Chumby]].

Apple does not allow Flash to run on [[iOS]], the operating system which runs on [[iPad]], [[iPhone]], [[iPod Touch]] and [[Apple TV]]. Apple stated that it has no plans to do so.&lt;ref name="thoughtsFlash"/&gt;

In February 2012, Adobe announced it would discontinue development of Flash Player on Linux for all browsers, except Google Chrome, by dropping support for [[NPAPI]] and using only Chrome's [[PPAPI]].&lt;ref name="pcworld-linux-ppapi"&gt;{{cite web|last=Noyes |first=Katherine |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/250455/for_flash_on_linux_chrome_will_be_users_only_choice.html |title=For Flash on Linux, Chrome Will Be Users' Only Choice &amp;#124; PCWorld Business Center |publisher=Pcworld.com |date=April 6, 2012 |accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slashdot-linux-ppapi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linux.slashdot.org/story2/03/31/1417245/adobe-releases-last-linux-version-of-flash-player |title=Adobe Releases Last Linux Version of Flash Player – Slashdot |publisher=Linux.slashdot.org |accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, Adobe announced that, beginning with version 24, it would resume offering of Flash Player for Linux for other browsers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.adobe.com/flashplayer/2016/08/betobe AIR and Adobe Flash Player Team Blog |title=Beta News – Flash Player NPAPI for Linux |date=August 31, 2016 |accessdate=November 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== HTML5 ====
All web browsers support [[HTML]] and other [[Web standards]] to various degree. Adobe released a tool that converts Flash to [[HTML5]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Adobe.com|url=https://www.adobe.com/products/flash/flash-to-html5.html |title=Flash to HTML5: Learn more about the CreateJS toolkit}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in June 2011, Google released an experimental tool that does the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Google Labs|url=http://swiffy.googlelabs.com|title=Google Swiffy|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904140637/http://swiffy.googlelabs.com/|archivedate=2011-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Linked In Groups: HTML5 Technologies |url=https://www.linkedin.com/groups/Google-just-announced-SWF-HTML5-2868882.S.59811646|title=
Google just announced a SWF to HTML5 converter|author=L., Maxime}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- need to replace this with list of browser HTML5 compatibility --&gt;{{As of|2013|12}}, versions of browsers such as [[Google Chrome|Chrome]], [[Firefox]], [[Internet Explorer]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] implement HTML5 to a considerable degree. However, some portions of the HTML5 specification were still being implemented by browser makers.

As of January 2015, [[YouTube]] defaults to HTML5 players to better support more devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=YouTube Engineering and Developers Blog|title=YouTube now defaults to HTML5 &lt;video&gt;|url=https://youtube-eng.googleblog.com/2015/01/youtube-now-defaults-to-html5_27.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vendor neutrality ===
Until 2008, the use of Flash was covered by restrictive licenses. The conditions prohibited use of the specification to develop any software (including players) which could render or read (and thus convert) SWF files, and required the output SWF files to be compatible with Adobe's players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=SWF and FLV File Format Specification License Agreement
| publisher=Adobe Systems
| date=2007-06-27
| quote=''You may not use the Specification in any way to create or develop a runtime, client, player, executable or other program that reads or renders SWF files.''| accessdate=2008-01-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071222125858/http://www.adobe.com/licensing/developer/fileformat/license/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-22

In 2008, restrictions on use of the SWF and FLV/F4V specifications were dropped, and some specifications were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=Open Screen Project Press Release

Flash is not an [[open standard]]. It is controlled by one firm, [[Adobe Systems]]. In contrast, HTML5 is controlled mostly by a committee, the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group ([[WHATWG]]).&lt;ref name="thoughtsFlash"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various people have praised Flash over the years for rendering consistently across platforms. Constructing sites in Flash is a way to prevent ''code forking,'' whereby different versions of a site are created for different browsers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ka Wai Cheung and Craig Bryant |title=Flash Application Design Solutions: The Flash Usability Handbook |page= 6 |publisher=Apress |year= 2006 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=49OwlbrMc-oC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=flash+cross+browser&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cI-hUNeJAu75igLOloGIBg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rob |last=Huddleston |title=Flash Catalyst CS5 Bible |publisher=Wiley |year= 2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=crN1zsYwYAYC&amp;pg=PT39&amp;dq=flash+cross+browser&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SZKhUICyLcr2iwKh7YFo&amp;ved=0CEkQ6wEwCA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking at 'Adobe Max' in 2011, Itai Asseo likewise said that, unlike HTML5, Flash offers a way to develop applications that work across platforms. HTML5, he said, is currently implemented differently (if at all) by different browsers. Although the Flash browser plugin is not supported on the Apple iPhone OS, Flash applications can be exported to Adobe AIR, which runs on that operating system as a native application. In the same talk, Mr. Asseo lamented the return to another browser war (as seen in the late 1990s). If Flash falls out of favor, he said, web developers will either have to develop many different versions of their web sites and native applications to take into account different HTML5 implementations, deny access to browsers that do not support their version of HTML, or dramatically reduce the functionality of their sites in order to deliver content to the least-advanced browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Itai Asseo|title=The Death of Flash|url=http://tv.adobe.com/watch/max-2011-envision/the-death-of-flash/|accessdate=November 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Authoring ===
Constructing Flash websites using Adobe tools is relatively easier than with integrated development environments for CSS, HTML, and JavaScript;&lt;ref name="caseFlash"&gt;{{cite news
|last=Wayner

|accessdate=January 5, 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, many of Adobe's tools are expensive and [[proprietary software]].&lt;ref name=caseFlash/&gt;

Tools for HTML5 are just starting to come to market; in the meantime, Adobe has released a first version of a Flash-to-HTML5 conversion tool for existing content&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2011/03/wallaby-flash-to-html5-conversion-tool-now-available.html |title=John Nack on Adobe : "Wallaby" Flash-to-HTML5 conversion tool now available |publisher=Blogs.adobe.com |date=2011-03-07 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are working on creating new tooling for HTML5 as well, like [[Adobe Edge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/adobe-edge-html5-animation-tool/16741/ |title=Adobe previews its Edge HTML5 animation tool |publisher=Gizmag.com |date=2010-10-26 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because HTML5 is an open format, tools like those for Flash can be built for it, too. Applications like Hype&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tumultco.com/hype/features/ |title=Hype Features |publisher=Tumultco.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adobe Edge]] are already on the market.

=== Performance ===
{{see also|Adobe Flash#Performance}}

Flash has a better performance than HTML, as a comparison of Flash with HTML in 2010 listed Flash as being faster than the other technologies, when used for non-video animations, although they are catching up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="HTML5" versus Flash: Animation Benchmarking|url=http://themaninblue.com/writing/perspective/2010/03/22/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flash vs HTML5 Performance (Updated January 2012)|url=http://pacoup.com/2011/02/03/flash-vs-html5-performance/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some users, more so those on [[macOS]] and [[Linux]], have complained about the relatively high [[CPU time|CPU usage]] of Flash for video playback.&lt;ref&gt;"Flash – CPU Usage – FPS – Frame Rate." [http://forums.adobe.com/thread/230334 Online posting. 10 December 2008. Reader discussions, Adobe Support Forums. 10 December 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2010}} This was partially because the Flash plugin did not use the GPU to render video. Adobe has responded to some of those criticisms in the 10.1 and 10.2 releases of the Flash plugin by offloading H.264 video decoding to dedicated hardware and by introducing a new video API called Stage Video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== DRM ===
Flash includes [[digital rights management|DRM]] support. The main HTML 5 standard does not include any [[digital restrictions management]] functionality directly, instead the [[Encrypted Media Extensions]] (EME) specification describes a communication channel between web browsers and digital rights management (DRM) agent software. The EME is not a complete DRM implementation, but just a specification for how the DRM implementations might operate.

Historically, before EME introduction implementations could support DRM, for example in [[codec]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/html/wiki/FAQs#Is_there_support_for_digital_rights_management_.28DRM.29_in_HTML5_video.3F |title=FAQs - HTML Wiki |publisher=W3.org |date=2011-02-22 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal to add DRM features to HTML5 itself has been criticized by those who consider openness and vendor-neutrality (both server- and client-side) one of the most important properties of HTML, because DRM is incompatible with [[free software]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Accessibility ===
Both Flash and HTML text can be read by screen readers. However, special care must be taken to ensure Flash movies are read correctly. For example, if a Flash movie is set to repeat indefinitely, this can cause a screen reader to repeat the content endlessly. Selecting the "Make object accessible" check box in Adobe Flash Professional will create a text-only version of the object for screen readers. It will also hide any motion from the screen reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/accessibility/products/flash/animation.html|title=Adobe Flash accessibility design guidelines|publisher=Adobe Systems|accessdate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Flash content is usually placed on a single webpage, it appears as a single entry in search engine result pages, unless techniques like [[deep linking]] are used with libraries like [[SWFAddress]] to provide multiple links within Flash websites and web applications. [[graphical user interface|User interface widgets]] in Flash objects don't always behave like their host native counterparts. Keyboard, mouse and other accessibility shortcuts may not work unless the webpage developer explicitly adds support for it.

Both Flash content and HTML content can be indexed by Google, Yahoo!, and Bing, although bi-directional text (e.g. [[Arabic]], [[Hebrew]]) is not supported by Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=72746#1|title=Flash and other rich media files|accessdate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/07/google-yahoo-spiders-can-now-crawl-through-flash-sites.ars|title=Google, Yahoo spiders can now crawl through Flash sites|work=Ars Technica|accessdate=May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yahoo! added support for indexing Flash sites in 2008, although Google had been able to index them for several years before that. Bing added support for Flash sites in 2010.

=== iOS devices ===

}}

===Development Tools===
As widgets are largely combinations of HTML or XHTML, CSS, and Javascript in most cases, standard AJAX tools, such as [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse ATF]], can be used for development. Specialized tools may give access to additional capabilities supplied by frameworks such as [[Dojo Toolkit|Dojo]] or [[Rico (Ajax)|Openrico]].

The '''''Crónicas anónimas de Sahagún''''' are two short [[chronicle]]s composed by the monks of [[Sahagún]] two centuries apart. They survive only in sixteenth-century [[Spanish language|Spanish]] translations. 

The first is a catalogue of the excesses of the [[middle class|middle]] and [[upper class]] of Sahagún between the years 1109 and 1117. Perhaps it was designed to be presented at the [[Council of Burgos]] in the latter year. If an early-twelfth-century provenance is correct then it must have originally been written in [[medieval Latin]]. It is a useful source of detail for the early reign of [[Urraca of León and Castile]], since the monastery at Sahagún was the most important in her realms. The second chronicle, written in the fourteenth century, may have been either originally Latin or originally Spanish. It is generally of little use to the historian.

'''DVD Profiler''' is a program that allows users to catalogue their [[DVD]] collections. The program was created by Ken Cole at InterVocative Software. Although it can be used for free (with free registration), it can be upgraded to a premium registration for a one-time fee.  Registration allows users to download higher-resolution cover scans, to vote on all changes to the DVD database, and to use the newest beta versions of the software.

DVD Profiler permits the adding of DVDs (since V3.0, [[HD DVD]]s and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s, since V4.0 [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]]s) by entering the [[Universal Product Code|UPC]]/[[European Article Number|EAN]], inserting the disc itself into the computer's DVD drive or searching by title. Users can upload their collection to the internet to provide other users the possibility to view their DVD profiles.

Also available is DVD Profiler Mobile, which allows the user to access your DVD Profiler database via a [[Pocket PC]]. You can also make changes to your database directly in DVD Profiler Mobile and synchronize back to your main DVD Profiler database.

Since December 2010 there's also an [[Mobile app|app]] for [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]] available which works as a standalone product or in combination with the Desktop version.

As of May 17, 2013, a version for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] has been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Android announcement|url=http://www.invelos.com/Forums.aspx?task=viewtopic&amp;topicID=676161|accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up through version 2.4 the program was released and maintained by InterVocative Software. Version 3.0 is released and maintained by Invelos Software, a company set up by developer Ken Cole to focus entirely on DVD Profiler and related products &amp; services.

A major drawback is the lack of support for Unicode, which makes it impossible to enter Asian DVD titles correctly.  Another drawback is that after years of fully functional ad-supported versions, from version 3.0 onwards, users cannot use most features with collections over 50 discs without buying the software.

== Legal issues ==
On April 5, 2007, Jesse Slicer, Kenneth Meade, and InterVocative Software, LLC (represented by Tim Haverty) filed an injunction (Case # [https://www.courts.mo.gov/casenet/cases/header.do?inputVO.caseNumber=07CY-CV03512&amp;inputVO.courtId=SMPDB0001_CT07 07CY-CV03512]) in Missouri's 7th Judicial District (Clay County) against Ken Cole and Invelos, LLC (represented by Joseph Gall). Judge Anthony Gabbert presided.

On May 9, 2007 the issue was resolved to the satisfaction of both companies, and InterVocative Software became a wholly owned subsidiary of Invelos Software, Inc.

'''''Der Fischer Weltalmanach''''' is an almanac, a popular publication of the information issued in [[Frankfurt on Main]], [[Germany]], created at the end of each year since 1959 by a team of [[Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag]]. In September 2018, the 60th and last edition will be published. Due to reduced demand, no further editions are produced &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.buchreport.de/2018/03/27/der-fischer-weltalmanach-erscheint-im-herbst-2018-zum-letzten-mal/ Der Fischer Weltalmanach erscheint im Herbst 2018 zum letzten Mal], buchreport.de, 2018-03-27&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Concept==
The idea that inspired the creators of the almanac was to find a new form of rapid transmission of information. Inspired by the U.S. ''The World Almanac and Book of Facts'', Gottfried Bermann Fischer, publisher and Gustav Fochler-Hauke, editor developed a product that became a bestseller in the German market, reaching in the first edition print run of about 100 thousand. copies, although it is discussed in only 89 then-existing sovereign states. With the increased volume of the successive editions of publication - 385 pages (1960), 480 (1980), 704 (2000), and its price - 3.30 DM (1960), DM 9.80 (1980), DM 24.90 (2000), 29,95 € (2009).

==Contents==
Over 50% of the content devoted to characterization of the 195 countries of the world, including giving facts and figures, and other basic information (language, GDP, the currency structure of the country, society, state, government, political parties and the economy), and chronicle the events of the previous year. Facts about [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] are richer. Each federal country (''land'') or canton is a more accurate by adding a chronicle of events and many statistics.

The publication contains a chronicle of events of the past year, discussed the major themes of the world, including economic and financial crisis, sea piracy, armed conflicts. Added information about the [[European Union]] and several international organizations. Discusses the most important problems in economics, environment, culture and sport. It also includes biographies of famous personalities and information about the deceased.

Edition 2010, anniversary, contains more than 250,000, updated data, more than 900 maps, illustrations and tables. It discusses fifty almanac edition, important events in the development of the world, and significant figures in the period 1960 to 2009.

'''Djadjaemankh''' is the name of a [[fiction|fictitious]] [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] appearing in the third chapter of a story told in the legendary ''[[Westcar Papyrus]].'' He is said to have worked [[miracle|wonders]] during the reign of king ([[pharaoh]]) [[Sneferu]] ([[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|4th dynasty]]).

==The literary person==
Djadjaemankh appears only in the third story of the ''Westcar Papyrus'' - there is no [[Archeology|archeological]] or [[History|historical]] evidence that he existed. Nevertheless he is object of great interest for Egyptologists, since his magical trick is connected to later [[culture|cultural]] perceptions of the personality of king Sneferu. In the story Djadjaemankh is described as a high lector priest.&lt;ref name=VeLe&gt;Verena M. Lepper: ''Untersuchungen zum Papyrus Westcar: Eine philologische und literaturwissenschaftliche (Neu-)Analyse''. In: ''Ägyptologische Abhandlungen'', Band 70. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2008, {{ISBN|3-447-05651-7}}, page 30 – 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MiLi&gt;Miriam Lichtheim: ''Ancient Egyptian literature: a book of readings. The Old and Middle Kingdoms'', Band 1. University of California Press 2000, {{ISBN|0-520-02899-6}}, 206 – 211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan B. Lloyd: ''Herodotus, book II: introduction'', Band 1. BRILL, Leiden 1975, {{ISBN|90-04-04179-6}}, page 104 – 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Helck, Eberhard Otto, Wolfhart Westendorf: ''Lexikon der Ägyptologie'', volume 4. page 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The wonder of Djadjaemankh==
According to the ''Westcar Papyrus,'' king Sneferu is in a [[Depression (mood)|melancholic]] mood. He is bored and so he wanders through every room of his palace, to seek some distraction. When unsuccessful, he orders to his servants: "Go and bring the high lector priest and scribe of the books, Djadjaemankh, to me."&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; The summoned is brought to Sneferu at once. Sneferu says to Djadjaemankh: "I have passed every chamber of my palace to find some distraction, but I couldn't find any."&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Djadjaemankh replies: "May thy majesty go to the lake of the palace, after a bark has been prepared with all the beauties from inside the palace. The heart of highness will be cheering up seeing them rowing to and fro. You will see the beautiful bird's marshes of the lake and their banks then and thine heart will become happy when recognizing their beautiful realms."&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Sneferu says: "Truly, I shall arrange such a rowing trip. Let me be brought 20 oars made of [[ebony]], decorated with gold, their handles made of ''seqab''-wood, covered with [[white gold|dja'am]]. Let me also be brought 20 virgin maidens with perfect bodies and well-developed bosoms, compassed with braided hairs. Let them be draped in nets after they have disrobed their clothes."&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; All things Sneferu wished are done. And so they row to and fro and Sneferu's heart is gladdened when he sees the girls row. Then it happens that the stroke maiden goes through her braids with her fingers and a hair pendant in the shape of a fish, made of [[malachite]], falls into the water of the lake. The stroke maiden becomes silent in shock and grief and stops specifying the clock&lt;!--keeping time?--&gt;. Her complete line of rowers becomes silent, too, and they all stop rowing. Sneferu asks: "Shouldn't you row...?"&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; The rowers answer: "Our stroke became silent, without rowing."&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Sneferu consults the stroke maiden: "That you don't row any further, has which reason?"&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; The woman answers: "This fish-pendant made of fresh beaten malachite is the reason. It fell into the water."&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Sneferu brings the stroke maiden back to her seat and offers: "Let me give you a duplicate of your pendant as a substitute."&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; The woman says: "I prefer to receive my property back than having a duplicate.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; The king orders now: "Go and bring the high lector priest Djadjaemankh to me."&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; And Djadjaemankh is brought to Sneferu at once. The ruler says: “Djadjaemankh, my brother, I have done all things that you have advised and the heart of thy majesty was refreshed when seeing the maidens rowing. Then a fish pendant made of fresh beaten malachite, belonging to the stroke maiden, fell into the water. She became silent, without rowing. So it came that she distracted the whole rowing line. I asked her: 'Why don't you row?' and she said: 'That fish-pendant made of fresh beaten malachite is the reason. It fell into the water.' And I replied to her: 'Row! See, I'm someone who replaces it.' But the maiden said: 'I prefer my own property before some substitute.'"&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Djadjaemankh utters a secret spell which makes the waters of the lake move, so that one half side of the lake now rests on the other half. The water which had been 12 cubits in height becomes now 24 cubits at one side, whilst the other side is dry now. Djadjaemankh enters the lake's ground and picks up the lost fish-pendant, which was lying on a pot-shard. He brings the amulet back to the stroke maiden and then removes the waters magically back to their original positions. Sneferu spends the rest of the day celebrating together with his royal palace and Djadjaemankh is rewarded generously by the king.&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt;&lt;ref name=MiLi/&gt;&lt;ref name=AdEr&gt;Adolf Erman: ''Die Märchen des Papyrus Westcar I. Einleitung und Commentar''. In: ''Mitteilungen aus den Orientalischen Sammlungen''. Heft V, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Berlin 1890. page 7 – 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern analysis==
Egyptologists see an important connection between Djadjaemankh's magic performance and the perception of king Sneferu's personality. [[Adolf Erman]] and [[Kurt Heinrich Sethe]] once considered the stories of the ''Westcar Papyrus'' as mere [[folklore]]. They saw literary figures like Djadjaemankh and the other heroes of the ''Westcar Papyrus'' as a pure fiction, created only for entertainment, since there is no archeological evidence of them.&lt;ref name=AdEr/&gt;

Modern Egyptologists such as [[Verena Lepper]] and [[Miriam Lichtheim]] deny this view and argue that Sethe and Erman may have just failed to see the profundity of such novels. They hold that at one side Sneferu is depicted as generous and kind, while on the other side he shows an [[accessibility|accostable]] character when he addresses a subaltern, namely Djadjaemankh, with “my brother”. Both go even further and describe Sneferu as being bawdy when he tells Djadjaemankh how the female rowers shall be dressed and look like.&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt;&lt;ref name=MiLi/&gt; Lepper and Liechtheim evaluate the story of Djadjaemankh as some sort of satire, in which a [[pharaoh]] is depicted as a fatuous fool, who is easily pleased with superficial entertainment and unable to solve his problem with a little rowing girl on his own. Furthermore the author of Djadjaemankh's tale places the main actor intellectually higher than the pharaoh and criticizes the pharaoh with this. Additionally the story of Djadjaemankh shows an interesting writing element: a speech in a speech. Sneferu repeats what he said to the stroke maiden, when he explains his problem to Djadjaemankh. The ''Westcar Papyrus'' is the first preserved Egyptian document in which a speech in a speech occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Verena M. Lepper: ''Untersuchungen zum Papyrus Westcar: Eine philologische und literaturwissenschaftliche (Neu-)Analyse''. In: ''Ägyptologische Abhandlungen'', Band 70. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2008, {{ISBN|3-447-05651-7}}, page 299.&lt;/ref&gt; Liechtheim and Lepper also point to multiple similar but somewhat later ancient Egyptian writings in which magicians perform very similar magic tricks or make prophecies to a king. Their stories are obviously inspired by the tale of [[Dedi]]. Descriptive examples are the papyri ''pAthen'' and ''The prophecy of Neferti''. In the Neferti-novel king Sneferu is also depicted as accostable and here, too, the king addresses a subaltern with "my brother". And again the stories of ''pAthen'' and the Neferti-novel both report about a bored pharaoh seeking for distraction. Furthermore the novels show how popular the theme of prophesying was since the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] - just like in the story of the ''Westcar Papyrus.'' Since ''pAthen'' and ''The prophecy of Neferti'' show the same manner of speaking and equal picking up of quaint phrases as the ''Westcar Papyrus'' does, Lepper and Liechtheim hold that Djadjaemankh must have been known to Egyptian authors for a surprisingly long time.&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt;&lt;ref name=MiLi/&gt;

The '''''Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity''''' ({{lang-ar|رسائل إخوان الصفا}}) also variously known as the '''''Epistles of the Brethren of Sincerity''''', '''''Epistles of the Brethren of Purity''''' and '''''Epistles of the Brethren of Purity and Loyal Friends''''' was a large [[encyclopedia]]&lt;ref name="ency-studies-in-a-mosque-3"&gt;"The work only professes to be an epitome, an outline; its authors lay claim to no originality, they only summarize what others have thought and discovered. What they do lay claim to is system and completeness. The work does profess to contain a ''systematized'', harmonious and co-ordinated view of the universe and life, its origin and destiny, formed out of many discordant, incoherent views; and it does claim to be a 'complete account of all things' - to contain, in epitome, all that was known at the time it was written.

It refers to more profound and special treatises for fuller information on the several sciences it touches upon, but it does claim to touch on all sciences, all departments of knowledge, and to set forth their leading results. In effect, it is, by its own showing, a 'hand-encyclopedia of Arabian philosophy in the tenth century'. It is not easy to exaggerate the importance of this encyclopedia. Its value lies in its completeness, in its systematizing of the results of Persian study."

==Authorship==
{{main|Brethren of Purity#Identities}}

Authorship of the ''Encyclopedia'' is usually ascribed to the mysterious "[[Brethren of Purity]]"  a group of [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Imamology in Ismaili Gnosis|last=Diana|first=Steigerwald|publisher=Monahar Publishers $ Distributors|year=2015|isbn=978-93-5098-081-1|location=New Delhi 110 002|pages=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholars placed in [[Basra]], [[Iraq]] sometime around 10th century CE .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/H051 Ikhwan al-Safa', ''Routledge Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ency-place"&gt;"Not everyone accepts the contemporary evidence that gives the Brethren as inhabitants of Basra. V. A. Ivanov, in ''The Alleged Founders of Ismailism'' ([[Bombay]], 1946), says that "I would be inclined to think that this was a kind of camouflage story being circulated by the Ismailis to avoid the book being used as a proof of their orthodoxy. [sic]". As quoted by Nasr (1964), pg 29.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is generally accepted that it was the group who authored at least the 52 rasa'il,&lt;ref name="ency-authorship"&gt;Unsurprisingly, other authors have been proposed: "Between these two extremes there have been the views expressed over the centuries that the ''Rasa'il'' were written by [['Ali ibn Abi Talib]], [[al-Ghazzali]], [[Hallaj]], [[Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq]], or various Isma'ili ''[[da'i]]''s, or "missionaries"." Nasr (1964), pg 26&lt;/ref&gt; the authorship of the "Summary" (''al-Risalat al-Jami'a'') is uncertain; it has been ascribed to the later [[Majriti]] but this has been disproved by Yves Marquet (see the [[#Risalat al-Jami'a|''Risalat al-Jami'a'' section]]).
Since style of the text is plain, and there are numerous ambiguities, due to language and vocabulary, often of [[Persian language|Persian]] origin, it has been suggested that the authors of the encyclopedia were of [[Persian people|Persian]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;Baffioni, Carmela. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ikhwan-al-safa/ "Ikhwân al-Safâ’"], ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Summer 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), First published April 22, 2008; Retrieved May 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers and historians such as Tawhidi, Ibn al-Qifti, Shahrazuri disclosed the names of those allegedly involved in the development of the work: Abu Sulayma Bisti, Muqaddasi, 'Ali ibn Harun, Zanjani, Muahmmad ibn Ahmad Narhruji, 'Awfi. All these people are according to Henry Corbin, [[Isma'ilism|Ismailis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2016/entries/ikhwan-al-safa/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Baffioni|first=Carmela|date=2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further perplexities abound; the use of pronouns for the authorial "sender" of the ''rasa'il'' is not consistent, with the writer occasionally slipping from [[Grammatical person|third person]] to first-person (for example, in Epistle 44, "The Doctrine of the Sincere Brethren").&lt;ref name="ency-eric4"&gt;"The Prophets and those of the Philosophers who have the right view...maintain that the body is only a prison of the soul, or a veil, an intermediary path or an isthmus...The sages of India called [[Brahmin]]s cremate the bodies of the dead, but ignorant and cunning as they are, they do not do it for the reasons I have given. It would be proper to say that the term "sages" applies to only a few among them." van Reijn (1995), pages 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; This has led some to suggest that the ''rasa'il'' were not in fact written co-operatively by a group or consolidated notes from lectures and discussions, but were actually the work of a single person.&lt;ref name="ency-tibawi"/&gt; Of course, if one accepts the longer time spans proposed for the composition of the ''Encyclopedia'', or the simpler possibility that each ''risala'' was written by a separate person, sole authorship would be impossible.

==Contents==
The subject matter of the ''Rasa'il'' is vast and ranges from mathematics, music, logic, astronomy, the physical and natural sciences, as well as exploring the nature of the soul and investigating associated matters in ethics, revelation, and spirituality.&lt;ref name="IIS-routledge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ency-netton"&gt;From the introduction of ''Muslim Neoplatonists: An Introduction to the Thought of the Brethren of Purity'', [[Ian Richard Netton]], 1991. Edinburgh University Press, {{ISBN|0-7486-0251-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its philosophical outlook was [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] and it tried to integrate [[Greek philosophy]] (and especially the [[Dialectic|dialectical reasoning]] and [[logic]] of [[Aristotle|Aristotelianism]]) with various [[Astrology|astrological]], [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]], [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] and [[Islam]]ic schools of thought. Scholars have seen [[Ismaili]]&lt;ref&gt;Some have claimed that the Brethren ''were'' Ismaili, though this may be unlikely because of their very lukewarm embrace of the [[Shi'a Imam|Imamate]] and other aspects of Ismailian theology, in addition to the lack of solid evidence in favor of such a hypothesis.
* This is not to say that there aren't some suggestive links between the Brethren and the Isma'ili. [[Heinz Halm]] notes in his "The cosmology of the pre-Fatimid Isma'iliyya" (as printed in ''Medieval Isma'ili History and Thought'', ed. Farhad Daftary, 1996, {{ISBN|0-521-45140-X}}) that the Sunni theologian [[Ibn Taymiyya]] (d. 1328) asserted that the doctrines of the Brethren were exactly identical to the Ismaili's in one of his [[fatwa]]s. Halm further notes that Paul Casanova had shown that the infamous [[Hashshashin]] had approved of the ''Encyclopedia'' and that their missionaries in [[Yemen]] even made use of it. Other sects apparently drew upon the ''Encyclopedia'' as well: "The theological treatises of the [[Tayyibi]] Ismailis of the [[Yemen]] contain ample quotations from the ''&lt;nowiki&gt;Rasa'il Ikhwan al-Safa'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'', and in the ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'Uyun al-akhbar&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' by the Yemenite ''da'i'' Idris 'Imad al-Din (d. 1468), Ahmad b. 'Abd Allah b. Muhammad b. Isma'il b. Ja'far al-Sadiq, the ninth imam and the second of the leaders of the Isma'ili ''da'wa'' residing in Salamiyya, is explicitly named as the author as the ''Rasa'il''." (pg 76) Indeed, the respect of some Ismaili was great indeed, some referring to it as "a Quran after the Quran" (Nasr, 1964, pg. 26). V. A. Ivanov remarks in his ''The Alleged Founders of Ismailism'' ([[Bombay]], 1946), that "the work is accepted by the Isma'ili as belonging to their religion, and is still regarded as esoteric..."
* But there are more reasons to reject an identification of the Brethren with Isma'ili, such as the failure of [[Hamid al-Din al-Kirmani]], an extremely important Islamic theologian, to make any mention of them. And other authors agree with this: "...the well-known modern Isma'ili scholar, H. F. al-Hamdani, although emphasizing the importance of the ''Rasa'il'' in the Isma'ili mission in the Yemen, disclaims Isma'ili authorship of the work and instead attributes the treatises to the 'Alids." (Amusingly, V. A. Ivanov attributes sponsorship of the work to the 'Alids' enemies, the Fatimids, instead, in his ''A Guide to Ismaili Literature'', London 1933) From pg 26-27 of Nasr (1964).
* From pg 8 of Tibawi: "There is sufficient evidence in the tracts themselves to prove Isma'ili sympathies. Indeed, such sympathies have long been pointed out by Muslim authors, medieval and modern, who tried to turn sympathy into actual relationship. However, the balance of evidence tends to show that such relationship was a later development. There is as yet no proof that the formation of Ikhwan as-Safa and the publication of their ''Rasa&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;il'' was an Isma'ili movement, or even a movement concerted with any of the contemporary agitation of the Shi'a." From page 9: "A glaring example of the Ikhwan's independence is their advocacy of the principle that the office of ''imam'' need not be hereditary, for they argue that if the desired good qualities are not found in one single person but scattered among a group, then the group and not the individual should be 'the lord of the time and the ''imam''. More surprising still is the denouncement of the belief in a concealed ''imam'' as painful to those who hold it and the discredit of the significance of 'number seven' and those who believe in it as contrary to the Ikhwan's creed."
* Compare this extract from one of the later rasa'il Netton provides on pg 102 of his ''Muslim Neoplatonists'': "Know, O Brother, that if these qualities are united simultaneously in one human being, during one of the cycles of astral conjunctions, then that person is the Delegate (''al-Mab'uth'') and the Master of the Age (''Sahib al-Zaman'') and the Imam for the people as long as he lives, If he fulfills his mission and accomplishes his allotted task, advises the community and records the revelation, codifies its interpretation and consolidates the holy law, clarifies its method and implements the traditional procedures and welds the community into one; if he does all that and then dies and passes away, those qualities will remain in the community as its heritage. If those qualities, or most of them, are united in one in his community, then he is the man suited to be his successor in his community after his death. But if it does not happen that those qualities are united in one man, but are scattered among all its members, and they speak with one voice and their hearts are united in love for each other, and they cooperate in supporting the faith, preserving the law and implementing the ''[[Sunnah|sunna]]'', and bearing the community along the path of religion, then their dynasty will endure in this world and the outcome will be happy for them in the next."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sufism|Sufi]] influences in the religious content, and [[Mu'tazili]]te acceptance of reasoning in the work.&lt;ref name="ency-the-protean-platonizers"/&gt; Others, however, hold the Brethren to be "free-thinkers" who transcended sectarian divisions and were not bound by the doctrines of any specific creed.&lt;ref name="IIS-routledge"/&gt;

Their unabashed [[eclecticism]]&lt;ref name="ency-studies-in-a-mosque1"&gt;"No one system satisfied these Brethren. They were too well acquainted with other creeds, and too well trained in the logical use of thought, to accept the common orthodox Islam which had contented the desert Arabs. Yet all other creeds and systems equally appeared open to doubt or refutation. In this confusion they found their satisfaction in an eclectic theory. All these conflicting views, they said, must be only different ways of looking at the same thing..." or "These fragments of truth were to be found in every system of faith and every method of philosophy; if men failed to detect them, the fault lay in their own imperfect intelligence - it was only the skill to read between the lines that was wanted to build up a harmonious whole out of the fragments of truth scattered about in sacred books and the writings of wise men and the mystic doctrines of saints." Stanley Lane-Poole (1883), pgs. 189, 190.&lt;/ref&gt; is fairly unusual in this period of Arabic thought, characterised by fierce theological disputes; they refused to condemn rival schools of thought or religions, instead insisting that they be examined fairly and open-mindedly for what truth they may contain:
{{cquote|...to shun no science, scorn any book, or to cling fanatically to no single creed. For [their] own creed encompasses all the others and comprehends all the sciences generally. This creed is the consideration of all existing things, both sensible and intelligible, from beginning to end, whether hidden or overt, manifest or obscure . . . in so far as they all derive from a single principle, a single cause, a single world, and a single Soul."'' - (from the ''Ikhwan al-Safa'', or ''Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity''; Rasa'il IV, pg 52) &lt;ref name="ency-vol4" /&gt;}}

In total, they cover most of the areas an educated person was expected to understand in that era. The epistles (or ''"rasa'il"'') generally increase in abstractness, finally dealing with the Brethren's somewhat [[pantheism|pantheistic]] philosophy, in which each soul is an emanation, a fragment of a universal soul with which it will reunite at death;&lt;ref name="ency-hossein-54"&gt;"The world in relation to Allah is like the word in relation to him who speaks it, like light, or heat or numbers to the lantern, sun, hearth or the number One. The word, light, heat and number exist by their respective sources, but without the sources could neither exist nor persist in being. The existence of the world is thus determined by that of Allah..." Nasr (1964), pg 54-55 (based on "Dieterici, ''Die Lehre von der Weltseele'', R., III, 319.")&lt;/ref&gt; in turn, the universal soul will reunite with [[Allah]] on [[Qiyamah|Doomsday]]. The epistles are intended to transmit right knowledge, leading to harmony with the universe and happiness.

===Organization===
{{further|List of rasa'il in the Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity}}

Organizationally, it is divided into 52 [[epistles]]. The 52 rasa'il are subdivided into four sections, sometimes called books (indeed, some complete editions of the ''Encyclopedia'' are in four volumes); in order, they are: 14 on the Mathematical Sciences, 17 on the Natural Sciences, 10 on the Psychological and Rational Sciences, 11 on Theological Sciences.&lt;ref name="ency-netton" /&gt;

The division into four sections is no accident; the number four held great importance in Neoplatonic [[numerology]], being the first [[square number]] and for being even. Reputedly, [[Pythagoras]] held that a man's life was divided into four sections, much like a year was divided into four seasons. The Brethren divided mathematics itself into four sections: [[arithmetic]] was Pythagoras and [[Nicomachus]]' domain; [[Ptolemy]] ruled over [[astronomy]] with his ''[[Almagest]]''; [[geometry]] was associated with [[Euclid]], naturally; and the fourth and last division was that of [[music]]. The fours did not cease there- the Brethren observed that four was crucial to a [[decimal]] system, as &lt;math&gt;1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10&lt;/math&gt;; numbers themselves were broken down into four [[orders of magnitude]]: the ones, tens, hundreds, and thousands; there were four winds from the four directions (north, south, east, west); medicine concerned itself with the [[four humours]], and natural philosophers with the four [[Classical element|elements]] of [[Empedocles]].

Another possibility, suggested by Netton is that the veneration for four stems instead from the Brethren's great interest in the ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]'' of [[Hermes Trismegistus]] (identified with the god [[Hermes]], to whom the number four was sacred); that hermetic tradition's magical lore was the main subject of the 51st rasa'il.

Netton mentions that there are suggestions that the 52nd risalah (on talismans and magic) is a later addition to the ''Encyclopedia'', because of intertextual evidence: a number of the rasa'il claim that the total of rasa'il is 51. However, the 52nd risalah itself claims to be number 51 in one area, and number 52 in another, leading to the possibility that the Brethren's attraction for the number 51 (or 17 times 3; there were 17 rasa'il on [[natural science]]s) is responsible for the confusion. Seyyed Hossein Nasr suggests that the origin of the preference for 17 stemmed from the [[alchemy|alchemist]] [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]]'s numerological symbolism.

====Risalat al-Jami'a====
Besides the fifty-odd epistles, there exists what claims to be overarching summary of the work, which is not counted in the 52, called "The Summary" (''&lt;nowiki&gt;al-Risalat al-Jami'a&lt;/nowiki&gt;'') which exists in two versions. It has been claimed to have been the work of [[Maslamah Ibn Ahmad al-Majriti|Majriti]] (d. ''circa'' 1008), although Netton states Majriti could not have composed it, and that Yves Marquet concludes from a philological analysis of the vocabulary and style in his ''La Philosophie des Ihwan al-Safa'' (1975) that it had to have been composed at the same time as the main corpus.

===Style===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Island-of-animals.jpg|thumb|A cock from the Island of Animals]] --&gt;

Like conventional Arabic Islamic works, the Epistles have no lack of time-worn honorifics and quotations from the Qur'an,&lt;ref name="ency-koran-camouflage"&gt;"But in spite of the anthropomorphic image of a Creator sitting on his Throne and looking down on his creation, the thought of the Sincere Brethren repeatedly breaks through the structures of traditional Islamic theology- a fact the numerous Qur'anic quotations (sometimes quite unrelated to the subject under discussion) barely disguise...." van Reijn (1945), pg ''vii''&lt;/ref&gt; but the ''Encyclopedia'' is also famous for some of the [[Didacticism|didactic]] [[fable]]s it sprinkled throughout the text; a particular one, the "Island of Animals" or the "Debate of Animals" (embedded within the 22nd rasa'il, titled "On How The Animals and their Kinds are Formed"), is one of the most popular animal fables in [[Islam]]. The fable concerns how 70 men, nearly shipwrecked, discover an island where animals ruled, and began to settle on it. They oppressed and killed the animals, who unused to such harsh treatment, complained to the King (or Shah) of Djinns. The King arranged a series of debates between the humans and various representatives of the animals, such as the nightingale, the bee, and the jackal. The animals nearly defeat the humans, but an Arabian ends the series by pointing out that there was one way in which humans were superior to animals and so worthy of making animals their servants: they were the only ones Allah had offered the chance of eternal life to. The King was convinced by this argument, and granted his judgement to them, but strongly cautioned them that the same Qur'an that supported them also promised them hellfire should they mistreat their animals.

==Philosophy==
More metaphysical were the four ranks (or "spiritual principles"), which apparently were an elaboration of [[Plotinus]]' triad of Thought, Soul, and the One, known to the Brethren through ''[[The Theology of Aristotle]]'' (a version of Plotinus' ''[[Enneads]]'' in Arabic, modified with changes and paraphrases, and attributed to [[Aristotle]]);&lt;ref name="ency-Enneads"&gt;"Isma'ilism developed a complex and rich theosophy which owed a great deal to Neoplatonism. In the 9th century, Greek-to-Arabic translations proliferated, first by the intermediary of Syriac then directly. The version of Plotinus' Enneads possessed by Muslims was modified with changes and paraphrases; it was wrongly attributed to Aristotle and called ''Theologia'' of Aristotle, since Plotinus ''(Flutinus)'' remained mostly unknown to the Muslims by name. This latter work played a significant role in the development of Isma‘ilism." From the [http://www.iep.utm.edu/i/ikhwan.htm article] at the [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt; first, the Creator (''al-Bārī'') emanated down to Universal Intellect (''al-'Aql al-Kullī''), then to Universal Soul (''al-Nafs''), and through Prime Matter (''al-Hayūlā al-Ūlā''), which emanated still further down through (and creating) the mundane hierarchy. The mundane hierarchy consisted of Nature (''al-Tabī'a''), the Absolute Body (''al-Jism al-Mutlaq''), the Sphere (''al-Falak''), the Four Elements (''al-Arkān''), and the Beings of this world (''al-Muwalladāt'') in their three varieties of animals, minerals, and vegetables, for a total hierarchy of nine members. Furthermore, each member increased in subdivisions proportional to how far down in the hierarchy it was, for instance, Sphere, being number seven has the seven [[planet]]s as its members.

{{cquote|The Absolute Body is also a form in Prime Matter as we explained in the Chapter on Matter. Prime Matter is a spiritual form which emanated from the Universal Soul. The Universal Soul also is a spiritual form which emanated from the Universal Intellect which is the first thing the Creator Created."'' &lt;ref name="ency-234-235"&gt;pg 234-235 of vol. 3, ''&lt;nowiki&gt;Rasa'il Ikhwan al-Safa'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'', 4 volumes ([[Beirut]], Dar Sadir, 1957)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- TODO: Integrate http://www.iep.utm.edu/i/ikhwan.htm description of the hierarchy. --&gt;

Not all Pythagorean doctrines were followed, however. The Brethren argued strenuously against [[transmigration of the soul]]. Since they refused to accept transmigration, then the Platonic idea that all learning is "remembrance" and that man can never attain to complete knowledge whilst shackled in his body must be false; the Brethren's stance was rather that a person ''could'' potentially learn everything worth knowing and avoid the snares and delusion of this sinful world, eventually attaining to Paradise, Allah, and salvation, but unless they studied wise men and wise books - like their encyclopedia, whose sole purpose was to entice men to learn its knowledge and possibly be saved - that possibility would never become an actuality. As Netton writes, "The magpie eclecticism with which they surveyed and utilized elements from the philosophies of Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle and Plotinus, and religions such as [[Nestorian Christianity]], [[Judaism]] and [[Hinduism]],&lt;ref name="ency-eric4"/&gt; was not an early attempt at [[ecumenism]] or interfaith dialogue. Their accumulation of knowledge was ordered towards the sublime goal of salvation. To use their own image, they perceived their Brotherhood, to which they invited others, as a "Ship of Salvation" that would float free from the sea of matter; the Ikhwan, with their doctrines of mutual cooperation, asceticism, and righteous living, would reach the gates of Paradise in its care."&lt;ref&gt;volume 4, pg 685-688 of the 1998 edition of ''[[The Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''; ed. Edward Craig, {{ISBN|0-415-18709-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another area in which the Brethren differed was in their conceptions of nature, in which they rejected the emanation of Forms that characterized Platonic philosophy for a quasi-Aristotelian system of [[Substance theory|substances]]:
{{cquote|Know, O brother, that the scholars have said that all things are of two types, substances and accidents, and that all substances are of one kind and self-existent, while accidents are of nine kinds, present in the substances, and they are attributes of them. But the Creator may not be described as either accident or substance, for He is their Creator and [[efficient cause]].&lt;ref&gt;pg 41 of vol 1, ''&lt;nowiki&gt;Rasa'il Ikhwan al-Safa'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'', 4 volumes ([[Beirut]], Dar Sadir, 1957)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{cquote|The first thing which the Creator produced and called into existence is a simple, spiritual, extremely perfect and excellent substance in which the form of all things is contained. This substance is called the Intellect. From this substance proceeds a second one which in hierarchy is below the first and is called the Universal Soul (''al-nafs al-kullīyah''). From the Universal Soul proceeds another substance which is below the Soul and which is called Original Matter. The latter is transformed into the Absolute Body, that is, into Secondary Matter which has length, width and depth."'' &lt;ref name="ency-hossein-52"&gt;from page 52 (whose translation is based on "Dieterici, ''Die Lehre von der Weltseele'', p. 15. R., II 4f") of Nasr (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;!-- :''"Know, O brother, that every being under the sphere of the moon has four causes which are all absolutely necessary in the creation of such beings: one of them is a material cause ('''illa hayūlāniyya''); another is a formal cause ('''illa sūriyya''); another is an efficient cause ('''illa fā'iliyya'') and another is a final cause ('''illa tamāmiyya'')."'' from R 2 p 79 --&gt;

The 14th edition (EB-2:187a; 14th Ed., 1930) of the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] described the mingling of Neoplatonism and Aristotelianism this way:
{{cquote|The materials of the work come chiefly from Aristotle, but they are conceived of in a Platonizing spirit, which places as the bond of all things a universal soul of the world with its partial or fragmentary souls."&lt;ref name="ency-brotherpur"/&gt;}}

===Evolution===
The text in the "Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity" describes biological diversity in a manner similar to the modern day theory of evolution.  The contexts of such passages are interpreted differently by scholars.

In this document some modern day scholars note that “chain of being described by the Ikhwan possess a temporal aspect which has led certain scholars to view that the authors of the Rasai’l believed in the modern theory of evolution”.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr (1992) p71: Der Darwinisimuseim X and XI Jarhhundert (Leipzig, 1878)&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Rasa’il “But individuals are in perpetual flow; they are neither definite nor preserved.  The reason for the conservation of forms, genus and species in matter is fixity of their celestial cause because their efficient cause is the Universal Soul of the spheres instead of the change and continuous flux of individuals which is due to the variability of their cause”.&lt;ref&gt;See Nasr (1992) p72 wherein the text has been quoted from Carra&lt;/ref&gt;  This statement is supporting the concept that species and individuals are not static, and that when they change it is due to a new purpose given.  In the Ikhwan doctrine there are similarities between that and the theory of evolution.  Both believe that “the time of existence of terrestrial plants precedes that of animals, minerals precede plants, and organism adapt to their environment”,&lt;ref&gt;Iqbal, Muzaffar Islam and Science (Great Britain: MPG Books Ltd, 1988) 117&lt;/ref&gt; but asserts that everything exists for a purpose.

[[Muhammad Hamidullah]] describes the ideas on [[evolution]] found in the ''Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity'' (''The Epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa'') as follows:

{{quote|"[These books] state that [[God]] first created [[matter]] and invested it with [[energy]] for development. Matter, therefore, adopted the form of [[vapour]] which assumed the shape of [[water]] in due time. The next stage of development was [[mineral]] life. Different kinds of [[Rock (geology)|stone]]s developed in course of time. Their highest form being mirjan ([[coral]]). It is a stone which has in it branches like those of a [[tree]]. After mineral life evolves [[vegetation]]. The evolution of vegetation culminates with a [[tree]] which bears the qualities of an animal. This is the [[Date Palm|date-palm]]. It has [[male]] and [[female]] genders. It does not wither if all its branches are chopped but it dies when the head is cut off. The date-palm is therefore considered the highest among the trees and resembles the lowest among animals. Then is born the lowest of animals. It evolves into an [[ape]]. This is not the statement of Darwin. This is what [[Ibn Miskawayh|Ibn Maskawayh]] states and this is precisely what is written in the ''Epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa''. The Muslim thinkers state that ape then evolved into a lower kind of a [[barbarian]] [[man]]. He then became a superior [[human]] being. Man becomes a [[saint]], a [[prophet]]. He evolves into a higher stage and becomes an [[angel]]. The one higher to angels is indeed none but God. Everything begins from Him and everything returns to Him."&lt;ref name=Hamidullah/&gt;}}

[[English language|English]] translations of the ''Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity'' were available from 1812, hence this work may have had an influence on [[Charles Darwin]] and his inception of [[Darwinism]].&lt;ref name=Hamidullah&gt;[[Muhammad Hamidullah]] and Afzal Iqbal (1993), ''The Emergence of Islam: Lectures on the Development of Islamic World-view, Intellectual Tradition and Polity'', p. 143-144. Islamic Research Institute, Islamabad.&lt;/ref&gt; However Hamidullah's "Darwin was inspired by the Epistles of the Ihkwan al-Safa" theory sounds unlikely as Charles Darwin comes from an evolutionist family with his well-known physician grandfather, [[Erasmus Darwin]], author of the poem The Origin of Sociey on evolution, was one of the leading Enlightenment evolutionists.&lt;ref name=ErasmusDarwinOrigin&gt;Zirkle, Conway (April 25, 1941). "Natural Selection before the 'Origin of Species'". Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
The 48th epistle of the ''Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity'' features a fictional [[Arabic literature|Arabic narrative]]. It is an anecdote of a "prince who strays from his palace during his wedding feast and, drunk, spends the night in a cemetery, confusing a corpse with his bride. The story is used as a gnostic parable of the soul's [[pre-existence]] and return from its terrestrial [[wiktionary:sojourn|sojourn]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1017/S0041977X00141540|title=An Allegory from the Arabian Nights: The City of Brass|first=Andras|last=Hamori|journal=[[School of Oriental and African Studies|Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies]]|volume=34|issue=1|year=1971|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=9–19 [18]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions and translations==
Complete editions of the encyclopedia have been printed at least three times:&lt;ref&gt;345, Hamdani&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Kitāb Ikhwān al-Ṣafā&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' (edited by Wilayat Husayn, Bombay 1888)
# ''Rasā'il Ikhwān al-Ṣafā&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' (edited by Khayr al-din al-Zarkali with introductions by Tāha Ḥusayn and Aḥmad Zakī Pasha, in 4 volumes, Cairo 1928)
# ''Rasā'il Ikhwān al-Ṣafā&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' (4 volumes, Beirut: Dār Ṣādir 1957)

The ''Encyclopedia'' has been widely translated, appearing not merely in its original Arabic, but in German, English, Persian, Turkish, and Hindustani.&lt;ref name="ency-more-influence"/&gt; Although portions of the ''Encyclopedia'' were translated into English as early as 1812, with the Rev. T. Thomason's prose English introduction to Shaikh [[Ahmad bin Muhammed Shurwan|Ahmad b. Muhammed Shurwan]]'s Arabic edition of the "Debate of Animals" published in [[Calcutta]],&lt;ref name="ency-tibawi"&gt;"Ikhwan as-Safa and their Rasa'il: A Critical Review of a Century and a Half of Research", by A. L. Tibawi, as published in volume 2 of ''The Islamic Quarterly'' in 1955; pgs. 28-46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- TODO: Reference this with the monograph I scanned onto Wikicommons. Interestingly, that monograph was "the publication, for the first time, of the titles of the tracts with short descriptions of the contents". I'll have to also remember this statement from the thing I shall footnote: "Obviously unaware of the contemporary evidence of Abu Hayyan at-Tauhidi on the Ikhwan and their tracts, Sprenger reproduces the later testimony of Shahrazuri from ''Tawarikh al-Hukama''."--&gt; a complete translation of the ''Encyclopedia'' into [[English language|English]] does not exist as of 2006, although [[Friedrich Dieterici]] (Professor of Arabic in Berlin) translated the first 40 of the epistles into German;&lt;ref name="ency-german"&gt;''Die Philosophie der Araber im zehnten Jahrhundert'', F. Dieterici, published in [[Berlin]] and [[Leipzig]] between 1865 and 1872; bibliographic information courtesy of ''The Epistles of the Sincere Brethren'', by Eric Van Reijn, 1945, Minerva Press, {{ISBN|1-85863-418-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; presumably, the remainder have since been translated. The "Island of Animals" have been translated several times in differing completion;&lt;ref name="ency-animal-translation"&gt;Such as L. E. Goodman's ''The Case of the Animals Versus Man Before the King of The Jinn'', in Boston 1978&lt;/ref&gt; the fifth risalah, on music, has been translated into English&lt;ref name="ency-music-translation"&gt;van Reijn (1945) - ''The epistle on music of the Ikhwan al-Safa'', Amnon Shiloah. Published by Tel-Aviv University, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; as have the 43rd through the 47th epistles.&lt;ref name="ency-43-47"&gt;van Reijn (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first complete Arabic critical edition and fully annotated English translation of the ''Rasa’il Ikhwan al-Safa’'' with commentaries is being published by a team of experts as editors, translators and scholars.  This constitutes a philosophy bi-lingual book series that is published by [[Oxford University Press]] in association with the [[Institute of Ismaili Studies]] in London; and this large-scale project is chaired by the series General Editor [[Nader El-Bizri]].

The '''FIFA World Ranking''' is a ranking system for men's national teams in association football, currently led by [[Belgian national football team|Belgium]].&lt;ref name="FIFA"/&gt; The teams of the [[List of men's national football teams|member nations]] of [[FIFA]], football's world governing body, are ranked based on their game results with the most successful teams being ranked highest. The rankings were introduced in December 1992, and eight teams ([[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], [[France national football team|France]], [[Germany national football team|Germany]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]], the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] and [[Spain national football team|Spain]]) have held the top position, of which Brazil have spent the longest ranked first.

A points system is used, with points being awarded based on the results of all FIFA-recognised full international matches.

The ranking system has been revamped on several occasions, generally responding to criticism that the preceding calculation method did not effectively reflect the relative strengths of the national teams. The current version of the ranking system was first used on 16 August 2018, adapted from the [[Elo rating system]] used in [[chess]] and [[Go (game)|Go]]. The rankings remain slightly different from the unofficial  [[World Football Elo Ratings]], which makes different presumptions and adaptations to the FIFA rankings.

==History==
In December 1992, FIFA first published a listing in rank order of its member associations to provide a basis for comparison of the relative strengths of these teams. From the following August, this list was more frequently updated, to be published most months.&lt;ref name="FIFAcoke"&gt;{{cite web|title=FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking Procedure |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/ranking/procedure/men.html |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=28 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant changes were implemented in January 1999 and again in July 2006, as a reaction to criticisms of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Revised FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/releases/newsid=104405.html |publisher=FIFA |date=6 July 2006 |accessdate=28 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612172351/http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/releases/newsid%3D104405.html |archivedate=12 June 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical records of the rankings, such as listed at FIFA.com, reflect the method of calculation in use at the time, as the current method has not been applied retrospectively to rankings prior to July 2006. Membership of FIFA has expanded from 167 to 211 since the rankings began; all 211 members are currently included in the rankings.

===1993–1998 calculation method===
The ranking formula used from August 1993 until December 1998 was very simplistic and quickly became noticed for its lack of supporting factors. When the rankings were initially introduced, a team received one point for a draw or three for a victory in FIFA-recognised matches&amp;nbsp;– much the same as [[three points for a win|a traditional league scoring system]]. This was a quite simplistic approach, however, and FIFA quickly realised that there were many factors affecting international matches.

===1999–2006 calculation method===
{{Main|FIFA World Ranking system (1999–2006)}}
In January 1999, FIFA introduced a revised system of ranking calculation, incorporating many changes in response to criticism of inappropriate rankings. For the ranking all matches, their scores and importance were all recorded, and were used in the calculation procedure. Only matches for the senior men's national team were included. Separate ranking systems were used for other representative national sides such as women's and junior teams, for example the [[FIFA Women's World Rankings]]. The women's rankings were, and still are, based on a procedure which is a simplified version of the Football Elo Ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Women's World Ranking Procedure |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/ranking/procedure/women.html |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=28 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major changes were as follows:
* the point ranking was scaled up by a factor of ten
* the method of calculation was changed to take into account factors including:
** the number of goals scored or conceded
** whether the match was played at home or away
** the importance of a match or competition
** regional strength
* a fixed number of points were no longer necessarily awarded for a victory or a draw
* match losers were able to earn points

Two new awards were introduced as part of the system:
*[[#Team of the Year|Team of the Year]]
*[[#Best Mover of the Year|Best Mover of the Year]]

The changes made the ranking system more complex, but helped improve its accuracy by making it more comprehensive.

===2006–2018 calculation method===
{{Main|FIFA World Ranking system (2006–2018)}}
FIFA announced that the ranking system would be updated following the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. The evaluation period was cut from eight to four years, and a simpler method of calculation was used to determine rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Great expectations |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/ranking/news/newsid=104272.html |publisher=FIFA |date=17 May 2006 |accessdate=28 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612172346/http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/ranking/news/newsid%3D104272.html |archivedate=12 June 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Goals scored and home or away advantage were no longer taken into account, and other aspects of the calculations, including the importance attributed to different types of match, were revised. The first set of revised rankings and the calculation methodology were announced on 12 July 2006.

This change was rooted at least in part in widespread criticism of the previous ranking system. Many football enthusiasts felt it was inaccurate, especially when compared to other ranking systems and that it was not sufficiently responsive to changes in the performance of individual teams.

===2018 ranking system update===
In September 2017, FIFA announced they were reviewing the ranking system and will decide after the end of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]] if any changes are to be made to improve the ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fifa to review rankings system after friendlies harm England's World Cup seeding |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/09/04/fifa-review-rankings-system-friendlies-harm-englands-world-cup/ |work=The Telegraph |date=4 September 2017 |accessdate=4 October 2017 |author=Ben Rumsby}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIFA announced on 10 June 2018 that the ranking system would be updated following the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]]. The calculation method to be adopted will be closely modeled after the [[Elo rating system]] and rankings of its member associations will be updated on a game-by-game basis. The weighting designated for each confederation for ranking purposes will be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Price |first1=Steve |title=How FIFA's New Ranking System Will Change International Soccer |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveprice/2018/06/11/how-fifas-new-ranking-system-will-change-international-soccer/#18864e86c412 |accessdate=12 June 2018 |work=Forbes |date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the new methodology does not account for home or away games and margin of the victory, as Elo rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.in/football/fifa-world-cup/story/3522329/fifa-world-ranking-gets-overhaul-to-stop-manipulation-for-draw-seedings|title=FIFA World Ranking gets overhaul to stop manipulation for draw seedings|date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIFA had intended to introduce the new ranking system in July 2018, but with no matches scheduled between the July and August ranking dates, delayed until August 2018. There was speculation from football journalists such as [[ESPN]]'s  Dale Johnson that this was because projections of the new rankings had seen relatively little change in positions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FIFA Ranking: July 2018 final preview (new method) |url=http://www.football-rankings.info/2018/07/fifa-ranking-july-2018-final-preview.html |publisher=Football-rankings |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Germany – who had been eliminated in the first round of the World Cup – remaining as the top ranked team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Dale |title=Tweet sent 14:33, 20-07-18 |url=https://twitter.com/DaleJohnsonESPN/status/1020300705737867277 |publisher=Twitter |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIFA had originally planned to use existing world ranking points from June 2018 as the start value, but when the August rankings appeared, the starting points had been changed to an equal distribution of points between 1600 (Germany, as the previously top ranked team) and 868 (Anguilla, Bahamas, Eritrea, Somalia, Tonga and Turks and Caicos Islands, which had 0 points in June), according to the formula:

&lt;math&gt;P_{seeding}=1600-(R-1)*4&lt;/math&gt;,

where R is the rank in June 2018. When two or more teams had equal ranks, the following team received the next immediate rank possible, e.g. if two teams had R=11, the following team had R=12, not 13. Then the rating changes according to the games played after previous release were calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Revision of the FIFA / Coca-Cola World Ranking |url=https://resources.fifa.com/image/upload/revision-of-the-fifa-coca-cola-world-ranking.pdf?cloudid=iklxmt2jejtjwf8qecba |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="August 18 rankings"&gt;{{cite web |title=August 2018 FIFA World Rankings |url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/rank=288/index.html |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This produced a more dramatically altered ranking table, with Germany falling to 15th and [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] champions France moving to the top of the ranking.&lt;ref name="August 18 rankings" /&gt;

==Rank leaders==
&lt;div style="text-align:center; float:right; clear: right; margin-left: 1em"&gt; '''FIFA World Ranking Leaders'''&lt;br /&gt;{{FIFA World Ranking leaders}}&lt;/div&gt;
When the system was introduced, [[Germany national football team|Germany]] debuted as the top-ranked team following their extended period of dominance in which they had reached the three previous FIFA World Cup finals, winning one of them. [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] took the lead in the run up to the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] after winning eight and losing only one of nine qualification matches, while on the way scoring twenty goals and conceding just four. [[Italy national football team|Italy]] then led for a short time on the back of their own equally successful World Cup qualifying campaign, after which the top place was re-claimed by Germany.

Brazil's success in their lengthy qualifying campaign returned them to the lead for a brief period. Germany led again during the 1994 World Cup, until Brazil's victory in that competition gave them a large lead that would stand up for nearly seven years, until they were surpassed by a strong [[France national football team|France]] team that captured both the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] and the [[2000 European Football Championship]].

Success at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] restored Brazil to the top position, where they remained until February 2007, when Italy returned to the top for the first time since 1993 following their [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] win in Germany. Just one month later, [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] replaced them, reaching the top for the first time, but Italy regained its place in April. After winning the [[Copa América 2007]] in July, Brazil returned to the top, but were replaced by Italy in September and then Argentina in October.

In July 2008, [[Spain national football team|Spain]] took over the lead for the first time, having won [[UEFA Euro 2008]]. Brazil began a sixth stint at the top of the rankings in July 2009 after winning the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup|2009 Confederations Cup]], and Spain regained the title in November 2009 after winning every match in qualification for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].

In April 2010, Brazil returned to the top of the table. After winning the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], Spain regained the top position and held it until August 2011, when the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] reached the top spot for the first time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIFA Ranking: Netherlands dethrone Spain |url=http://www.football-rankings.info/2011/08/fifa-ranking-netherlands-dethrone-spain.html |work=Football-Rankings.info |date=12 August 2011 |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; only to relinquish it the following month.

In July 2014, [[Germany national football team|Germany]] took over the lead once again, having won the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. In July 2015, [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] reached the top spot for the first time since 2008, after reaching both the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final, as well as the 2015 Copa America Final. In November 2015, [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] became the leader in the FIFA rankings for the first time, after topping their [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying|Euro 2016]] qualifying group. Belgium led the rankings until April 2016, when Argentina returned to the top. On 6 April 2017, Brazil returned to the No. 1 spot for the first time since just prior to the 2010 World Cup,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazil back on top of FIFA Ranking, Netherlands slump to record low|url=http://www.espnfc.com/blog/fifa/243/post/3091643/brazil-back-on-top-of-fifa-ranking-as-netherlands-slump-to-record-low |work=ESPN |date=29 March 2017 |accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Germany regained the top spot in July after winning the [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup|Confederations Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40517341|title=Fifa rankings: Northern Ireland reach highest point as Germany lead the way|work=BBC news|date=6 July 2017|accessdate=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, [[France national football team|France]] became the leader in the FIFA rankings again after nearly 16 years, having won the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], and this is also the first time FIFA adopted the Elo rating system to the ranking system. One month later, for the first time two teams were tied at the top spot as Belgium returned to the number one spot with the same ranking as France, to become joint leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/45586533|title=Belgium and France top Fifa world rankings to be first ever joint-leaders|work=BBC news|date=20 September 2018|accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses of the rankings==
The rankings are used by FIFA to rank the progression and current ability of the [[List of men's national association football teams|national football teams]] of its member nations, and claims that they create "a reliable measure for comparing national A-teams".&lt;ref name="FIFAcoke" /&gt; They are used as part of the calculation, or the entire grounds to [[Seed (tennis)|seed]] competitions. In the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]] tournament, the rankings were used to seed the groups in the competitions involving [[CONCACAF]] members (using the May rankings), [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] (with the July set of data), and [[UEFA]], using the specially postponed November 2007 ranking positions.

The October 2009 ranking was used to determine the seeds for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] final draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIFA Organising Committee approves Final Draw procedure |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/southafrica2010/finaldraw/news/newsid=1142262/ |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=13 April 2011 |date=2 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225043322/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/southafrica2010/finaldraw/news/newsid%3D1142262/ |archivedate=25 December 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The March 2011 ranking was used to seed the draw for the [[2012 CAF Men's Pre-Olympic Tournament qualifying rounds#Second qualifying round|2012 CAF Men's Pre-Olympic Tournament second qualifying round]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympics – updated draw procedure, with teams |url=http://www.cafonline.com/football/news/8965-olympics--updated-draw-procedure-with-teams.html |work=CAFOnline.com |publisher=Confederation of African Football |accessdate=13 April 2011|date=12 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rankings are also used to determine the winners of the two annual awards national teams receive on the basis of their performance in the rankings.

The (English) Football Association uses the average of the last 24 months of rankings as one of the criteria for player work permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=POINTS BASED SYSTEM GOVERNING BODY ENDORSEMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR PLAYERS 2017/2018 SEASON |url=http://www.thefa.com/-/media/files/thefaportal/governance-docs/registrations/gbe-criteria-for-players-2017-2018.ashx |publisher=English Football Association |accessdate=29 November 2017 |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Since their introduction in 1992, the FIFA World Rankings have been the subject of much debate, particularly regarding the calculation procedure and the resulting disparity between generally perceived quality and world ranking of some teams.  The perceived flaws in the FIFA system have led to the creation of a number of alternative rankings from football statisticians,&lt;ref name="BBCreport" /&gt; including the [[World Football Elo Ratings]] and the [[rec.sport.soccer Statistics Foundation]]{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} rankings.

The initial system was very simple, with no weighting for the quality of opponent or importance of a match. This saw [[Norway national football team|Norway]] reach second in October 1993 and July–August 1995, a ranking that was criticized at the time.&lt;ref name="BBCreport"&gt;{{Cite news|title=The world rankings riddle |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1081551.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=21 December 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rankings were [[FIFA World Ranking system (1999–2006)|adapted in 1999]] to include weightings based on the importance of the match and the strength of the opponent. A win over a weak opponent resulted in fewer points being awarded than a win over a much stronger one. Further [[FIFA World Ranking system (2006–2018)|adaptations in 2006]] were made to reduce the number of years' results considered from 8 to 4,&lt;ref name="BBCreport" /&gt;&lt;ref name="travour"&gt;{{Cite news|title=FIFA Rankings |url=http://www.travour.com/fifa-world-cup-2006/fifa-rankings.html |publisher=Travour.com |date=1 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614173120/http://www.travour.com/fifa-world-cup-2006/fifa-rankings.html |archivedate=14 June 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; with greater reliance on matches from within the previous 12 months.

Still, criticisms of the rankings remained, with particular anomalies being noted including: the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] rise to fourth in 2006, to the surprise of even their own players;&lt;ref name="GnM"&gt;{{Cite news|title=FIFA adapting new world rankings |url=https://www.fctables.com/pdf/FIFA-adapting-new-world-rankings.pdf |agency=Associated Press |date=2 June 2006 |accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Israel national football team|Israel's]] climb to 15th in November 2008, which surprised the Israeli press;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=FIFA chief praises IFA's work |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1225199592139&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=29 August 2008 |accessdate=13 February 2009 |quote=Blatter was also asked about Israel's unrealistic FIFA ranking.

Further criticisms of the 2006-2018 formula included the inability of hosts of major tournaments to retain a high place in the rankings, as the team participated in only lower-value friendly matches due to their automatic qualification  for the tournament. For example, [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] hosts Brazil fell to a record low ranking of 22nd in the world prior to that tournament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cummings|first=Michael|title=FIFA World Rankings Place Brazil 18th, Reinforce Flawed Nature of System|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1488973-fifa-world-rankings-place-brazil-18th-reinforce-flawed-nature-of-system|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freitas|first=Paulo|title=Scolari blames FIFA for Brazil's poor ranking|url=http://www.sambafoot.com/en/news/48211_scolari_blames_fifa_for_brazil_s_poor_ranking.html|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; at which they then finished fourth. [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] hosts Russia had the lowest ranking (70th) at the tournament, where they reached quarterfinals.

In the 2010s, teams realized the ranking system could be 'gamed', specifically by avoiding playing non-competitive matches, particularly against weaker opponents.&lt;ref name = "Switzerland"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/oct/17/england-seeded-switzerland-world-cup-draw-friendlies |title=With a bit of planning England could have been seeded ahead of the Swiss |first=Simon |last=Burnton |work=The Guardian |publisher= |date=17 October 2013 |accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was because the low weighting of friendlies meant that even victories could reduce a team's ''average'' score: in other words, a team could win a match and lose points. Prior to the seeding of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2018 World Cup preliminary draw]], Romania even appointed a ranking consultant, playing only one friendly in the year before the draw.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2015/07/23/romania-wales-set-to-be-surprise-world-cup-top-seeds/30563797/ |title=Romania, Wales set to be surprise World Cup top seeds |newspaper=USA Today |agency=Associated Press |date=23 July 2015 |accessdate=29 July 2015 |quote=Romania took advice from a consultant who decoded some mysteries of a ranking system used by FIFA since 1992.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.romanialibera.ro/sport/fotbal/exclusiv-rl--romania--in-top-10-mondial--cum-au-depasit-franta-burleanu-si--sfatuitorul-secret--384576 |title=Burleanu: "Am consultat specialiști în clasamentul FIFA."

The use of regional strength multiplier in the ranking formula before 2018 was also accused of further reinforcing and perpetuating the bias for and against certain regions. FIFA's use of regional multiplier was cited as a primary reason why most teams in AFC (Asia) and CONCACAF (North America) held significantly lower FIFA rankings compared to their position in the World Football Elo Rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://therostrumblog.wordpress.com/2015/10/04/soccer-rankings-farewell-fifa-hello-elo/ |title=Soccer rankings: farewell FIFA, hello Elo? |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current calculation method==
On 10 June 2018, the new ranking system was approved by the FIFA Council. It is based on the [[Elo rating system]] and after each game points will be added to or subtracted from a team's rating according to the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;P = P_\text{before}+I(W-W_e)&lt;/math&gt;
where:

* ''P''&lt;sub&gt;before&lt;/sub&gt; – the team's number of points before the game
* ''I'' – the importance coefficient:
** 05 – friendlies played outside the International Match Calendar windows
** 10 – friendlies played within the International Match Calendar windows
** 15 – Nations League matches (group stage)
** 25 – Nations League matches (play-offs and finals)
** 25 – Confederations' final competitions qualifiers, FIFA World Cup qualifiers
** 35 – Confederations' final competitions matches (before quarter-finals)
** 40 – Confederations' final competitions matches (quarter-finals and later), FIFA Confederations Cup matches
** 50 – FIFA World Cup matches (before quarter-finals)
** 60 – FIFA World Cup matches (quarter-finals and later)
* ''W'' – the result of the game:
** 0 – loss after regular or extra time
** 0.5 – draw or loss in a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]]
** 0.75 – win in a penalty shootout
** 1 – win after regular or extra time.
:: If a game ends with a winner, but still requires a Penalty Shoot-Out (PSO) (i.e. in the second game of a [[two-legged tie]]), it is considered as a regular game and the PSO is disregarded.
* ''W&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' – the expected result of the game:
::&lt;math&gt;W_e = \frac{1}{10^{-\frac{dr}{600}} + 1}&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''dr'' is the difference between two teams' ratings before the game.

Negative points in knockout stages of final competitions will not affect teams' ratings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://resources.fifa.com/image/upload/revision-of-the-fifa-coca-cola-world-ranking.pdf?cloudid=iklxmt2jejtjwf8qecba Revision of the FIFA / Coca - Cola World Ranking]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Each year FIFA hands out two awards to its member nations, based on their performance in the rankings. They are:

===Team of the Year===
Team of the Year is awarded to the team that finishes top of the FIFA World Ranking. [[Germany national football team|Germany]] are the Team of the Year for the third time in the 24-year history of the rankings. [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] hold the records for most consecutive wins (seven, between 1994 and 2000) and most wins overall (twelve). The table below shows the three best teams of each year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/ranking/news/newsid=1351535.html ''Team of the Year Award 2010''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218180552/http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/ranking/news/newsid%3D1351535.html |date=18 December 2010 }} on the FIFA website&lt;/ref&gt;

===Best Mover of the Year===
The Best Mover of the Year was awarded to the team who made the best progress up the rankings over the course of the year. In the FIFA rankings, this is not simply the team that has risen the most places, but a calculation is performed in order to account for the fact that it becomes progressively harder to earn more points the higher up the rankings a team is.&lt;ref name="FIFAcoke" /&gt;

The calculation used is the number of points the team has at the end of the year (''z'') multiplied by the number of points it earned during the year (''y''). The team with the highest index on this calculation received the award. The table below shows the top three best movers from each year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/awards/gala/bestmover.html ''Best Mover of the Year''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720000000/http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/awards/gala/bestmover.html |date=20 July 2008 }} on the FIFA website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/worldranking/news/newsid=1560354/index.html ''Spain on top and Wales highest climber''] on the FIFA website&lt;/ref&gt;

The award has not been an official part of the awards since 2006.

While an official award has not been made for movements since 2006, FIFA has released a list of the 'Best Movers' in the rankings since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/r&amp;a-wr/71/25/61/ip-590%5f11a%5ftopteam-bestmover.pdf ''Top Team and the Best Mover of the Year''] on the FIFA website (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the informal on-going "Mover of the Year" award is the recognition made by FIFA to Colombia in 2012 in an official press release.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/worldranking/news/newsid=1974233/index.html Spain finish 2012 on top, Colombia in fifth]. FIFA.com. Retrieved on 12 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the calculation methodology had changed to the difference in ranking points over the course of the year (rather than the methodology used in the official award from 1993 to 2006). The results for latter years are based on a similar methodology.

== Context ==
{{main article|Ross expedition|Flora Antarctica}}

The British government fitted out [[Ross expedition|an expedition]] led by [[James Clark Ross]] to investigate magnetism and marine geography in high southern latitudes, which sailed with two ships, [[HMS Terror (1813)|HMS ''Terror'']] and [[HMS Erebus (1826)|HMS ''Erebus'']] on 29 September 1839 from Chatham.

The ships arrived, after several stops, at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on 4 April 1840. On 21 April the giant kelp ''[[Macrocystis pyrifera]]'' was found off [[Prince Edward Islands|Marion Island]], but no landfall could be made there or on the [[Crozet Islands]] due to the harsh winds. On 12 May the ships anchored at Christmas Harbour for two and a half months, during which all the plant species previously encountered by [[James Cook]] on the [[Kerguelen Islands]] were collected. On 16 August they reached the [[River Derwent (Tasmania)|River Derwent]], remaining in Tasmania until 12 November. A week later the flotilla stopped at [[Auckland Islands|Lord Auckland's Islands]] and [[Campbell Island group|Campbell's Island]] for the spring months.

Large floating forests of ''Macrocystis'' and ''[[Durvillaea]]'' were found until the ships ran into icebergs at latitude 61° S. [[Drift ice|Pack-ice]] was met at 68° S and longitude 175°. During this part of the voyage [[Victoria Land]], [[Mount Erebus]] and [[Mount Terror (Antarctica)|Mount Terror]] were discovered. After returning to Tasmania for three months, the flotilla went via Sydney to the [[Bay of Islands]], and stayed for three months in New Zealand to collect plants there. After visiting other islands, the ships returned to the Cape of Good Hope on 4 April 1843. At the end of the journey specimens of some fifteen hundred plant species had been collected and preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=J.D.

== Species ==
According to Hooker, the flora of the islands south of Tasmania and New Zealand is related to that of New Zealand and bears no likeness to that of Australia. On the Auckland Islands wood grows near the sea and consists of the tree ''[[Metrosideros umbellata]]'' intermixed with woody ''[[Dracophyllum]]'', ''[[Coprosma]]'', ''[[Hebe (plant)|Hebe]]'' (assigned to ''Veronica'' by Hooker) and ''[[Panax]]''. These are undergrown by many ferns. Higher up grow alpines. On the Campbell Islands brushwood is limited to narrow bays which are relatively sheltered. These islands are steeper and rocky and have bear less vegetation, primarily grasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= J.D. Hooker|year= 1844|title= Flora Antarctica, Volume 1, Parts 1-2, Flora Novae-Zelandiae|pages= 1–3|url= https://archive.org/stream/botanyofantarcti01hook#page/31/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants collected by Hooker from Auckland and Campbell Islands are listed below. Species described by him should be cited with his acronym Hook.f. (Hooker filius), but this has not been applied here for brevity. Species already described by other authors are indicated though. Where applicable and as far as possible, the [[Correct name (botany)|corrected botanical names]], and the currently accepted name have been indicated accompanied by the [[List of botanists by author abbreviation|abbreviated author names]].

The ''Flora Antarctica'' contains a very large number of [[liverwort]] species from the Auckland and Campbell Islands, at that time almost all assigned to the genus ''[[Jungermannia]]''. Of the 82 species mentioned in the ''Flora Antarctica'', 79 have since been reassigned to other genera in the [[Jungermanniales]]. Hooker credits the scientists in the Cryptogamic Botany Department, especially [[Thomas Taylor (botanist)|Thomas Taylor]], for their expertise and cooperation in preparing the sections on mosses, liverworts and lichens. The species published under their common authorship are generally indicated by Hook.f &amp; Taylor. This has been omitted in this section for brevity. Authors are also not indicated with type species that have later been transferred to another genus while retaining the original species [[epithet]], because this authority appears in the new combination between brackets. All other author (combinations) were indicated though.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= J.D.

'''Le Grand Ricci''' (or '''Grand dictionnaire Ricci de la langue chinoise''', Simplified Chinese : 利氏汉法辞典 ; Traditional Chinese : 利氏漢法辭典 ; pinyin : Lìshì Hàn-Fǎ cídiǎn ; literally : “Dictionnaire chinois-français Ricci” (2001), from the name of the 15th century Italian missionary, [[Matteo Ricci]].

It is composed of seven volumes of more than 1,200 pages each, identifying 13,500 characters, and about 300,000 entries of terms and expressions. It is, therefore, the largest Chinese-French dictionary yet, and probably the largest dictionary of Chinese into a Western language.

It has become widely known since its publication in 2001, Le Grand Ricci is the most comprehensive up-to-date dictionary of Chinese into a modern Western language. Though it covers the whole history of Chinese language development, most of the dictionary deals with early and imperial period Chinese language usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brill.com/cn/products/online-resources/le-grand-ricci-online|title=Le Grand Ricci Online - Brill|website=www.brill.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''"It is difficult to imagine any scholar in Chinese studies who will not eagerly welcome this new digital incarnation of the Le Grand Ricci. Le Grand Ricci is to all purposes the most comprehensive bilingual dictionary of Chinese in the Western world. It covers three millennia of the Chinese language, from the Classics to the modern age, and is encyclopedic in its scope. The compilers were able to draw on the full range of French sinological expertise in completing the project. Since its publication Le Grand Ricci has established itself as an indispensable reference tool. Now available online, and easily searchable, its functionality has only further increased."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Wilt L. Idema. Research Professor of Chinese Literature, Harvard&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chinesereferenceshelf.brillonline.com/grand-ricci/;jsessionid=8AE9B7ABE21813D3AD884E11CFF30EFA|title=Research Professor of Chinese Literature, Harvard|last=Idema|first=Wilt L.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;On the 11th of May, 2010, the DVD version was presented for the first time at the [[Shanghai Museum]]. The resources of the Ricci dictionary are available on Android phones and tablets and Apple IOS via [[Pleco Software]].

([http://www.plosin.com/work/HortusDetails.html Description of the illumination])]]
[[Image:Hortus Deliciarum - Hell.jpg|thumb|right|Hell, as illustrated in ''Hortus deliciarum''.]]
'''''Hortus deliciarum''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for ''Garden of Delights'') is a [[medieval]] [[manuscript]] compiled by [[Herrad of Landsberg]] at the [[Hohenburg Abbey]] in [[Alsace]], better known today as [[Mont Sainte-Odile]]. It was an [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] [[encyclopedia]], begun in 1167 as a [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] tool for young [[novice]]s at the convent. It is the first encyclopedia that was evidently written by a woman. It was finished in 1185, and was one of the most celebrated illuminated manuscripts of the period.&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the work is in [[Latin language|Latin]], with [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] in [[German language|German]].

Most of the manuscript was not original, but a [[compendium]] of 12th century knowledge. The manuscript contained poems, illustrations, and music, and drew from texts by [[classics|classical]] and [[Arab]] writers.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; Interspersed with writings from other sources were [[poem]]s by Herrad, addressed to the [[nun]]s, almost all of which were set to music.&lt;ref name="Yardley"&gt;Yardley, pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous portion of the manuscript are its 336 illustrations, which symbolised various themes, including theosophical, philosophical, and literary. These works are well regarded.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;

In 1870, the manuscript was burnt and destroyed when [[Temple Neuf|the library]] housing it in [[Strasbourg]] was bombed during [[Siege of Strasbourg|a siege on the city]]. It is possible to reconstruct parts of the manuscript because portions of it had been copied in various sources; Christian Maurice Engelhardt copied the [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] in 1818, and the text was copied and published by Straub and Keller between 1879 and 1899.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hortus deliciarum'' is one of the first sources of [[polyphony]] originating from a [[convent]]. The manuscript contained at least 20 song texts, all of which were originally notated with music. Those that can be recognized now are from the [[conductus]] repertory, and are mainly note against note in texture. The notation was in semi-quadratic [[neume]]s with pairs of four-line [[staff (music)|staves]].&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; Two songs survive with music intact: ''Primus parens hominum'', a [[monophony|monophonic song]], and a two-part work, ''Sol oritur occasus''.&lt;ref name="Yardley"/&gt;

'''''Larbi-Odam v MEC for Education (North-West Province)''''' is a 1997 judgment of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa]] which held that a government policy forbidding the employment of non-citizens (including permanent residents) in permanent teaching positions, was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Iain |last1=Currie |first2=Johan |last2=de Waal |title=The Bill of Rights Handbook |edition=5th |year=2005 |location=Cape Town |publisher=Juta &amp; Company Ltd |isbn=9780702159237 |page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although citizenship is not one of the prohibited grounds for discrimination listed in the [[Section Nine of the Constitution of South Africa|equality clause]] of South Africa's [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]], the court found unanimously that in this case discrimination against non-citizens was unfair. It came to this decision because non-citizens are necessarily a minority with little political power, and because citizenship is a personal attribute which is difficult to change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/1997/16media.pdf |title=Media Summary: Larbi-Odam and Others v MEC for Education (North-West Province) and Another |publisher=Constitutional Court |date=26 November 1997 |accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3429">A '''letter of comfort''', sometimes called a "letter of intent", is a communication from a party to a contract to the other party that indicates an initial willingness to enter into a contractual obligation absent the [[Contract#Elements|elements]] of a legally enforceable contract. The objective is to create a morally binding but not legally binding assurance.&lt;ref name="EUlaw"&gt;Mäntysaari, Petri. ''The Law of Corporate Finance: General Principles and EU Law.'' Heidelberg: Springer, 2010, p. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, a letter of comfort is drafted only in vague terms, to avoid creating enforceable contract terms.&lt;ref name="Fontaine"&gt;Fontaine, Marcel and De Ly, Filip. ''Drafting International Contracts: An Analysis of Contract Clauses.'' Leiden: Martinus Nijhoff Pub., 2009, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Few nations regulate letters of comfort by statute; whether a letter of comfort creates legally enforceable contractual terms is often determined only by courts of law, based solely on the wording of the document.&lt;ref name="EUlaw" /&gt; Despite their nonbinding status, letters of comfort nonetheless provide risk mitigation because the parent company is putting its own reputation in jeopardy.&lt;ref&gt;Huang, Wei-Xin. ''Institutional Banking for Emerging Markets: Principles and Practice.'' Chichester: Wiley, 2007, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

In international contracts, letters of comfort are often used to assure a contracting party that a parent corporation will provide its subsidiary with the necessary resources to fulfill the contract.&lt;ref name="Fontaine" /&gt; However, under both international and [[European Union]] law, a letter of comfort does not require the parent corporation to fulfill the obligations incurred by its subsidiary.&lt;ref name="EUlaw" /&gt; When used to provide support for a subsidiary's actions, a letter of comfort usually consists of three terms:&lt;ref&gt;Bradgate, Robert and White, Fidelma. ''Commercial Law.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008, p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A statement from the parent organization acknowledging that its subsidiary has entered into a contract.
*A promise that the parent organization will not sever its legal relationship with the subsidiary until contractual terms are satisfied.
*A statement of comfort (e.g., "it is our policy" or "it is our intention") indicating how far the parent organization will go to support the subsidiary in fulfilling its contractual terms.

[[Canada]] recognizes two types of letters of comfort.  The weaker version, in which a parent organization acknowledges that a subsidiary has entered into a contract but which provides no assurance of intention, is called a ''letter of awareness''.  The stronger version, the letter of comfort, indicates the parent organization's intention to support the subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;World Trade Organization. ''Dispute Settlement Reports 2002.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 1298.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, there is a general presumption against the enforceability of letters of comfort.  However, depending on the wording of the document, there may be legal liability under the rule of [[Estoppel|reliance]].&lt;ref&gt;Furmston, Michael; Tolhurst, G.J.; and Mik, Eliza. ''Contract Formation: Law and Practice.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 2010, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Calculation: The raw performance of integrated GPU, in single-precision [[FLOPS]], can be calculated as follows:
:* Fourth generation (GMA 3, 4) - EU * 2 * 2 [multiply + accumulate] * clock speed
:* Fifth generation (HD Graphics) - EU * 2 * 2 [multiply + accumulate] * clock speed
:* Sixth generation (HD Graphics 2000, 3000) - EU * 4 [dual-issue x 2 SP] * 2 [multiply + accumulate] * clock speed
:* Seventh generation (HD Graphics 2500, 4000 ~ 5200) - EUs * 8 [2 x SIMD-4 FPU] * 2 [MUL + ADD] * clock speed
:* Eighth generation (HD Graphics 5300 ~ 6300) - EUs * 8 [2 x SIMD-4 FPU] * 2 [MUL + ADD] * clock speed
:* Ninth generation (HD Graphics 5xx) - EUs * 8 [2 x SIMD-4 FPU] * 2 [MUL + ADD] * clock speed

Double-precision [[FLOPS]]:
:* Seventh generation (HD Graphics 2500, 4000 ~ 5200) - EUs * 4 [SIMD-4 FPU] * 2 [MUL + ADD] * clock speed / 2
:* Eighth generation (HD Graphics 5300 ~ 6300) - EUs * 4 [SIMD-4 FPU] * 2 [MUL + ADD] * clock speed / 2
:* Ninth generation (HD Graphics 5xx) - EUs * 4 [SIMD-4 FPU] * 2 [MUL + ADD] * clock speed / 2
:For example, the HD Graphics 3000 is rated at 125 GFLOPS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://img.delivery.net/cm50content/intel/software/e-alert3/Sandy_Bridge_Intel_HD_Graphics_DirectX_Developers_Guide.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425082100/http://img.delivery.net/cm50content/intel/software/e-alert3/Sandy_Bridge_Intel_HD_Graphics_DirectX_Developers_Guide.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is consistent with the formula (12 * 4 * 2 * 1,300&amp;nbsp;MHz).

{{Zoroastrianism}}
'''Magi''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|eɪ|dʒ|aɪ}}; singular '''magus''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|eɪ|g|ə|s}}; from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:magus#Noun 2|magus]]'') denotes followers of [[Zoroastrianism]] or [[Zoroaster]]. The earliest known use of the word Magi is in the trilingual inscription written by [[Darius the Great]], known as the [[Behistun Inscription]]. [[Old Persian]] texts, pre-dating the Hellenistic period, refer to a Magus as a [[Zurvanism|Zurvanic]], and presumably Zoroastrian, priest.

Pervasive throughout the [[Mediterranean Sea|Eastern Mediterranean]] and [[Western Asia]] until [[late antiquity]] and beyond, ''mágos'' was influenced by (and eventually displaced) Greek ''[[Goetia|goēs]]'' (γόης), the older word for a practitioner of magic, to include [[astronomy]]/[[astrology]], [[alchemy]] and other forms of esoteric knowledge. This association was in turn the product of the Hellenistic fascination for [[Pseudo-Zoroaster|(Pseudo&amp;#8209;)Zoroaster]], who was perceived by the Greeks to be the [[Chaldea]]n founder of the Magi and inventor of both astrology and magic, a meaning that still survives in the modern-day words "[[magic (paranormal)|magic]]" and "[[Magician (paranormal)|magician]]".{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

[[Biblical magi|"μάγοι" from the east]] visit Jesus in Chapter 2 of the [[Gospel of Matthew]], and the transliterated plural "magi" entered English from [[Latin]] in this context around 1200 (this particular use is also commonly rendered in English as "kings" and more often in recent times as "wise men")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%202 Matthew 2 in Greek]&lt;/ref&gt;. The singular "magus" appears considerably later, when it was borrowed from [[Old French]] in the late 14th century with the meaning ''magician''.

==In Median sources==
The [[Avestan]] word ''magâunô'', i.e. the religious caste of the [[Medes]], (see Yasna 33.7: ''ýâ sruyê parê magâunô'' "so I can be heard beyond Magi"), seems to be the origin of the term.

The term only appears twice in Iranian texts from before the 5th century BCE, and only one of these can be dated with precision. This one instance occurs in the trilingual [[Behistun inscription]] of [[Darius the Great]], and which can be dated to about 520 BCE. In this trilingual text, certain rebels have 'magian' as an attribute; in the [[Old Persian]] portion as ''maγu-''&lt;!-- Gershevitch--&gt; (generally assumed to be a loan word from [[Median language|Median]]&lt;!--cf Boyce quotation below --&gt;). The meaning of the term in this context is uncertain.

The other instance appears in the texts of the [[Avesta]], i.e. in the sacred literature of Zoroastrianism. In this instance, which is in the [[Avestan language|Younger Avestan]] portion, the term appears in the [[Hapax legomenon|hapax]] ''moghu.tbiš'', meaning "hostile to the ''moghu''", where ''moghu'' does not (as was previously thought&lt;!--according to source Boyce--&gt;) mean "magus", but rather "a member of the tribe"&lt;!-- 10, 10,n38 --&gt;&lt;ref name= "Boyce_1975_10_11" /&gt; or referred to a particular social class in the proto-Iranian language and then continued to do so in Avestan.&lt;ref name="Gershevitch"&gt;{{citation|last=Gershevitch|first= Ilya|title = Zoroaster's Own Contribution|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|volume=23|issue=1|date=1964|doi=10.1086/371754|pages=12}}, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

An unrelated term, but previously assumed to be related, appears in the older Gathic [[Avestan language]] texts. This word, adjectival ''magavan''&lt;!-- not mag*h*avan --&gt; meaning "possessing ''maga-''", was once the premise that Avestan ''maga-'' and Median (i.e. Old Persian) ''magu-'' were co-eval (and also that both these were cognates of [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''magha-''). While "in the [[Gathas]] the word seems to mean both the teaching of Zoroaster and the community that accepted that teaching",&lt;!-- also Boyce "possessed of this gospel" --&gt; and it seems that Avestan ''maga-'' is related to Sanskrit ''magha-'', "there is no reason to suppose that the western Iranian form ''magu'' (Magus) has exactly the same meaning"&lt;ref name="Zaehner_1961"/&gt; as well.

But it "may be, however", that Avestan ''moghu'' (which is not the same as Avestan ''maga-'') "and Medean&lt;!-- sic (in a quotation) --&gt; ''magu'' were the same word in origin, a common Iranian term for 'member of the tribe' having developed among the Medes the special sense of 'member of ''the''&lt;!-- italics Boyce--&gt; (priestly)&lt;!-- parens Boyce--&gt; tribe', hence a priest."&lt;ref name= "Boyce_1975_10_11"&gt;{{citation|last=Boyce|first=Mary|authorlink=Mary Boyce|title=A History of Zoroastrianism, Vol. I|date=1975| publisher = Brill|location=Leiden|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''cf''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Gershevitch"/&gt;

==In Greek sources==
The oldest surviving Greek reference to the magi&amp;nbsp;– from Greek μάγος (''mágos'', plural: ''magoi'') – might be from 6th century BCE [[Heraclitus]] (apud [[Clemens of Alexandria|Clemens]] ''Protrepticus 12''), who curses the magi for their "impious" rites and rituals. A description of the rituals that Heraclitus refers to has not survived, and there is nothing to suggest that Heraclitus was referring to foreigners.

Better preserved are the descriptions of the mid-5th century BCE [[Herodotus]], who in his portrayal of the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] expatriates living in Asia minor uses the term "magi" in two different senses. In the first sense (''Histories'' 1.101), Herodotus speaks of the magi as one of the tribes/peoples (''ethnous'') of the [[Medes]]. In another sense (1.132), Herodotus uses the term "magi" to generically refer to a "[[sacerdotal]] caste", but "whose ethnic origin is never again so much as mentioned."&lt;ref name="Zaehner_1961"&gt;{{citation|last=Zaehner|first=Robert Charles|date=1961|title=The Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism|location=New York|publisher=MacMillan|page=163}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Robert Charles Zaehner]], in other accounts, "we hear of Magi not only in [[Fars Province|Persia]], [[Parthia]], [[Bactria]], [[Chorasmia]], [[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]], [[Medes|Media]], and among the [[Sakas]], but also in non-Iranian lands like [[Samaria]], [[Ethiopia]], and [[Egypt]]. Their influence was also widespread throughout Asia Minor. It is, therefore, quite likely that the sacerdotal caste of the Magi was distinct from the Median tribe of the same name."&lt;ref name="Zaehner_1961"/&gt;

Other Greek sources from before the [[Hellenistic period]] include the gentleman-soldier [[Xenophon]], who had first-hand experience at the Persian [[Achaemenid]] court. In his early 4th century BCE ''[[Cyropaedia]]'', [[Xenophon]] depicts the magians as authorities for all religious matters (8.3.11), and imagines the magians to be responsible for the education of the emperor-to-be.

[[File:Cross-Potent-Heraldry.svg|thumb|200px|[[Cross potent]].]]

[[Victor H. Mair]] provides archaeological and linguistic evidence suggesting that Chinese ''[[Wu (shaman)|wū]]'' (巫 "shaman; witch, wizard; magician", [[Old Chinese]] *''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;ag'') was maybe a loanword from [[Old Persian]] *''maguš'' "magician; magi".&lt;ref name="Mair"&gt;{{citation|last=Mair|first=Victor H.|date=1990|title=Old Sinitic *''Myag'', Old Persian ''Maguš'' and English ''Magician''|journal=Early China|volume=15|pages=27–47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes:

{{quote|The recent discovery at an early [[Zhou Dynasty|Chou]] site of two figurines with unmistakably Caucasoid or Europoid feature is startling prima facie evidence of East-West interaction during the first half of the first millennium Before the Current Era. It is especially interesting that one of the figurines bears on the top of his head the clearly incised graph '''☩''' which identifies him as a ''wu'' (&lt; *''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;ag'').&lt;!--Mair 27--&gt;&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;}}

These figurines, which are dated circa 8th century BCE, were discovered during a 1980 excavation of a [[Zhou Dynasty]] palace in [[Fufeng County]], [[Shaanxi]] Province.

Mair connects the ancient [[Bronzeware script]] for ''wu'' 巫 "shaman" (a cross with [[cross potent|potent]]s) with a Western [[heraldic]] symbol of magicians, the [[cross potent]] '''☩''', which "can hardly be attributable to sheer coincidence or chance independent origination."

Compared with the [[linguistic reconstruction]]s of many [[Indo-European languages]], the current reconstruction of Old (or "Archaic") Chinese is more provisional. This [[velar]] final ''-g'' in Mair's *''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;ag'' (巫) is evident in several Old Chinese reconstructions (Dong Tonghe's *''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;wag'', Zhou Fagao's *''mjwaγ'', and [[Li Fanggui]]'s *''mjag''), but not all ([[Bernhard Karlgren]]'s *''m&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;wo'' and Axel Schuessler's *''ma'').

[[File:Magi (1).jpg|250px|thumb|Byzantine depiction of the Three Magi in a 6th-century mosaic at [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]].]]

As early as the 5th century BCE, Greek ''magos'' had spawned ''mageia'' and ''magike'' to describe the activity of a magus, that is, it was his or her art and practice. But almost from the outset the noun for the action and the noun for the actor parted company. Thereafter, ''mageia'' was used not for what actual magi did, but for something related to the word 'magic' in the modern sense, i.e. using supernatural means to achieve an effect in the natural world, or the appearance of achieving these effects through trickery or sleight of hand. The early Greek texts typically have the pejorative meaning, which in turn influenced the meaning of ''magos'' to denote a conjurer and a charlatan. Already in the mid-5th century BC, Herodotus identifies the ''magi'' as interpreters of omens and dreams (''Histories'' 7.19, 7.37, 1.107, 1.108, 1.120, 1.128).

Once the magi had been associated with "magic"—Greek ''magikos''—it was but a natural progression that the Greeks' image of Zoroaster would metamorphose into a magician too.&lt;!-- para 7--&gt;&lt;ref name="Beck_2003"&gt;{{citation|last=Beck|first=Roger|chapter= Zoroaster, as perceived by the Greeks|title=Encyclopaedia Iranica&lt;!-- supplementary --&gt;|location=New York|publisher=iranica.com| date = 2003|chapter-url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/zoroaster-iv-as-perceived-by-the-greeks}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first century [[Pliny the elder]] names &lt;!--(pseudo-)--&gt;"Zoroaster" as the inventor of magic (''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'' xxx.2.3), but a "principle of the division of labor appears to have spared Zoroaster most of the responsibility for introducing the dark arts to the Greek and Roman worlds. That dubious honor went to another fabulous magus, [[Ostanes]], to whom most of the pseudepigraphic magical literature was attributed."&lt;ref name="Beck_2003"/&gt; For Pliny, this magic was a "monstrous craft" that gave the Greeks not only a "lust" (''aviditatem'') for magic, but a downright "madness" (''rabiem'') for it, and Pliny supposed that Greek philosophers—among them [[Pythagoras]], [[Empedocles]], [[Democritus]], and [[Plato]]—traveled abroad to study it, and then returned to teach it (xxx.2.8–10).

[[Pseudo-Zoroaster|"Zoroaster"]] – or rather what the Greeks supposed him to be – was for the Hellenists the figurehead of the 'magi', and the founder of that order (or what the Greeks considered to be an order). He was further projected as the author of a vast compendium of "Zoroastrian" [[pseudepigrapha]], composed in the main to discredit the texts of rivals. "The Greeks considered the best wisdom to be exotic wisdom" and "what better and more convenient authority than the distant — temporally and geographically — Zoroaster?"&lt;!--para 4--&gt;&lt;ref name="Beck_2003"/&gt; The subject of these texts, the authenticity of which was rarely challenged, ranged from treatises on nature to ones on necromancy. But the bulk of these texts dealt with astronomical speculations and magical lore.

One factor for the association with astrology was Zoroaster's name, or rather, what the Greeks made of it. Within the scheme of Greek thinking (which was always on the lookout for hidden significances and "real" meanings of words) his name was identified at first with star-worshiping (''astrothytes'' "star sacrificer") and, with the ''Zo-'', even as the ''living'' star.&lt;!-- Beck 523 --&gt; Later, an even more elaborate mytho-etymology evolved: Zoroaster died by the living (''zo-'') flux (''-ro-'') of fire from the star (''-astr-'') which he himself had invoked, and even, that the stars killed him in revenge for having been restrained by him.&lt;!-- Beck 523 --&gt;

The second, and "more serious"&lt;!--Beck 523--&gt;&lt;ref name="Beck_1991"&gt;{{citation|last=Beck|first=Roger|chapter=Thus Spake Not Zarathushtra: Zoroastrian Pseudepigrapha of the Graeco-Roman World|pages=491–565|title=A History of Zoroastrianism|volume=3| editor-last = Boyce|editor-first=Mary|editor2-last=Grenet|editor2-first=Frantz|series=Handbuch der Orientalistik, Abteilung I, Band VIII, Abschnitt 1|location=Leiden|publisher=Brill|date=1991}}, p. 516.&lt;/ref&gt; factor for the association with astrology was the notion that Zoroaster was a [[Chaldea]]n. The alternate Greek name for Zoroaster was Zaratas/Zaradas/Zaratos (''cf.'' Agathias 2.23–5, [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]] ''Stromata'' I.15), which—according to Bidez and Cumont—derived from a Semitic form of his name. The [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean tradition]] considered the "founder" of their order to have studied with Zoroaster in Chaldea ([[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] ''Life of Pythagoras'' 12, Alexander Polyhistor apud Clement's ''Stromata'' I.15, Diodorus of Eritrea, Aristoxenus apud Hippolitus VI32.2). [[Joannes Laurentius Lydus|Lydus]] (''On the Months'' II.4) attributes the creation of the seven-day week to "the Chaldeans in the circle of Zoroaster and Hystaspes", and who did so because there were seven planets. The [[Suda]]'s chapter on ''astronomia'' notes that the Babylonians learned their astrology from Zoroaster. [[Lucian|Lucian of Samosata]] (''Mennipus'' 6) decides to journey to Babylon "to ask one of the magi, Zoroaster's disciples and successors", for their opinion.

==In Semitic sources==
In [[Arabic]] texts, as in Greco-Roman tradition, Zoroaster is "founder" of the magians, Arabic ''[[majus]]ya''.

In the 1980s, under the secular Ba'ath Party formerly led by Saddam Hussein, among the many propaganda campaigns of Iraq, the term ''majus'' was used during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] as a generalization of all modern-day Iranians. "By referring to the Iranians in these documents as ''majus'', the security apparatus [implied] that the Iranians [were] not sincere Muslims, but rather covertly practice their pre-Islamic beliefs. Thus, in their eyes, Iraq's war took on the dimensions of not only a struggle for Arab nationalism, but also a campaign in the name of Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|title=The Mindset of Iraq's Security Apparatus|author=Al-Marashi, Ibrahim|year=2000|page=5|url=http://www.cambridgesecurity.net/pdf/iraqi-mindset.pdf|publisher=Cambridge University: Centre of International Studies|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411114823/http://www.cambridgesecurity.net/pdf/iraqi-mindset.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Biblical Magi}}

The word ''mágos'' (Greek) and its variants appears in both the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gospel of Matthew]]2:1–12:9; [[Acts of the Apostles]] 8:9; 13:6,8; and the [[Septuagint|Septuagint of Daniel]] 1:20; 2:2, 2:10, 2:27; 4:4; 5:7, 5:11, 5:15).&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinarily this word is translated "magician" or "sorcerer" in the sense of illusionist or fortune-teller, and this is how it is translated in all of its occurrences (e.g. Acts 13:6) except for the Gospel of Matthew, where, depending on translation, it is rendered "wise man" (KJV, RSV) or left untranslated as ''Magi'', typically with an explanatory note (NIV). However, early church fathers, such as [[Justin Martyr|St. Justin]], [[Origen]], [[St. Augustine]] and [[St. Jerome]], did not make an exception for the Gospel, and translated the word in its ordinary sense, i.e. as "magician".&lt;ref name="CathEnc"&gt;{{citation|last=Drum|first=W.|date=1910|chapter=Magi|title=The Catholic Encyclopedia|location = New York|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|chapter-url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09527a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gospel of Matthew states that [[Biblical Magi|magi]] visited the infant [[Jesus]] shortly after his birth ({{Bibleverse-nb||Matthew|2:1–2:12|9}}). The gospel describes how magi from the east were notified of the birth of a king in [[Judea|Judaea]] by the appearance of his star. Upon their arrival in [[Jerusalem]], they visited [[Herod the Great|King Herod]] to determine the location of the [[Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament#King of the Jews|king of the Jews]]'s birthplace. Herod, disturbed, told them that he had not heard of the child, but informed them of a prophecy that the [[Messiah]] would be born in [[Bethlehem]]. He then asked the magi to inform him when they find the infant so that Herod may also worship him. Guided by the [[Star of Bethlehem]], the wise men found the baby Jesus in a house; Matthew does not say if the house was in Bethlehem. They worshipped him, and presented him with "gifts of gold and of frankincense and of myrrh." (2.11) In a dream they are warned not to return to Herod, and therefore return to their homes by taking another route. Since its composition in the late 1st century, numerous apocryphal stories have embellished the gospel's account. [[Matthew 2:16]] implies that Herod learned from the wise men that up to two years had passed since the birth, which is why [[Massacre of the Innocents|all male children two years or younger were slaughtered]].

In addition to the more famous story of [[Simon Magus]] found in chapter 8, the ''[[Book of Acts]]'' ({{Bibleverse-nb||Acts|13:6–11|}}) also describes another magus who acted as an advisor of [[Sergius Paulus]], the Roman [[proconsul]] at [[Paphos]] on the island of [[Cyprus]]. He was a Jew named Bar-Jesus (son of Jesus), or alternatively [[Elymas]]. (Another Cypriot magus named Atomos is referenced by [[Josephus]], working at the court of [[Antonius Felix|Felix]] at [[Caesarea]].)

One of the non-canonical Christian sources, the [[Syriac Infancy Gospel]], provides, in its third chapter, a story of the wise men of the East which is very similar to much of the story in Matthew.  Unlike Matthew, however, this account cites Zoradascht (Zoroaster) as the source of the prophecy that motivated the wise men to seek the infant Jesus. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/apocryphalnewtes00honeuoft#page/40/mode/2up|title=The Apocryphal Books of the New Testament|last=Hone|first=William|authorlink2=William Wake|date=1890 (4th edit); 1820 (1st edition)|website=Archive.org|publisher=Gebbie &amp; Co., Publishers, Philadelphia|access-date=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Quran (Islamic tradition)==
Although some Islamic scholars have inferred an implicit reference, the Qur'an mentions the 'Majūs' or 'Magus' or Magians (المجوس) explicitly only once:

{{quote|Surely those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Sabians, and the [[Nasrani (Arabic term for Christian)|Nasrani]], and the [[Zoroastrianism|Magians]], and those who associate [others with God] – surely God will decide between them on the Day of Resurrection. Lo! God is a witness over all things.|The Qur'an 22:17}}

'''Montoneros''' ({{lang-es|link=no|Movimiento Peronista Montonero-MPM}}) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[leftist]]  [[urban guerrilla]] group, active during the 1960s and 1970s. The name is an allusion to the 19th century cavalry militias, called [[Montoneras]], who fought for the [[Federalist Party (Argentina)|Partido Federal]] during the [[Argentine Civil Wars]].

After [[Juan Domingo Perón|Juan Perón]]'s return from 18 years of exile and the 1973 [[Ezeiza massacre]], which marked the definitive split between left and right-wing Peronism, the president [[Expulsion of Montoneros from Plaza de Mayo|expelled the Montoneros]] from the [[Justicialist]] party in May 1974. The group was completely destroyed during the [[Dirty War]].

==Ideology==
In Latin America, left-wing guerrillas arose in response to state terror. Some resorted to kidnapping and violence as in their struggle against right-wing dictatorships in Latin America during the 1970s. The Montoneros began as a self-described Christian, nationalist, and socialist group; but as time passed the socialist element eclipsed the Christian.&lt;ref name="Abidor"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Abidor|title=The Montoneros|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/argentina/montoneros/introduction.htm|website=Marxists Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giussani claims that the Montoneros maintained that democracies were a complex masquerade that concealed [[Fascism|fascist]] governments and delayed [[class struggle]].&lt;ref&gt;Giussani, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Their attacks sought to force the governments to give up such pretensions and operate openly as fascist governments, expecting that in such a scenario the people would then support the guerrillas.&lt;ref&gt;Giussani, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; This doctrine did not work as intended: people despised the military dictatorships, but some did not see the guerrillas as the enemies of the dictatorships, but rather as a contributing cause to the government's repression.&lt;ref&gt;Giussani, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The projected class struggle never took place, chiefly because of the U.S.-backed military dictatorship's repression of all dissent.&lt;ref&gt;Giussani, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Juan Perón]] encouraged the actions of [[José López Rega]], supported the right-wing unionists and denied preferential promotions to the Montoneros, they thought that his actions were simply a strategic masquerade. Some believed that Perón supported the Montoneros' projects.&lt;ref&gt;Giussani, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Perón [[Expulsion of Montoneros from Plaza de Mayo|expelled the group from Plaza de Mayo]] and outlined the government's [[counter-insurgency]] that decimated the guerrillas. Some surviving Montoneros still acknowledge Perón as their leader.&lt;ref&gt;Giussani, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after his return to Argentina, however, Peron moved to the Right and insulted all leftists, prompting the Montoneros to go underground.&lt;ref name="Abidor" /&gt;

==From 1970 to Videla's military dictatorship ==
The Montoneros formed around 1970 out of a confluence of Roman Catholic groups, university students in social sciences, and leftist supporters of [[Juan Domingo Perón]]. "The Montoneros took their name from the pejorative term used by the 19th-century elite to discredit the mounted followers of the popular [[caudillos]]."

The Montoneros hoped that Perón would return from exile in [[Spain under Franco|Francoist Spain]] and transform Argentina into a "Socialist Fatherland".

The Montoneros initiated a campaign to destabilise by force the regime supported by the U.S.,&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Campbell|first1=Duncan|title=Kissinger approved Argentinian 'dirty war' Declassified US files expose 1970s backing for junta|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/dec/06/argentina.usa|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had trained Argentinian and other Latin American dictators via the School of the Americas.&lt;ref name="celina"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andreassi|first1=Celina|title=School of Assassins: Past and Present of the School of the Americas|url=http://www.argentinaindependent.com/socialissues/humanrights/school-of-assassins-past-and-present-of-the-school-of-the-americas/|website=The Argentina Independent|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the extreme repression of the Argentina military dictatorship, the Montoneros committed many acts of resistance to the regime.

In 1970, as retribution for the June 1956 [[León Suárez massacre]] and [[Juan José Valle]]'s execution, the Montoneros kidnapped and executed former dictator [[Pedro Eugenio Aramburu]] (1955–1958) and other collaborators. In November 1971, in solidarity with militant car workers, Montoneros took over a car manufacturing plant in [[Caseros, Argentina|Caseros]], sprayed 38 Fiats with petrol, and set them afire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0_u5aLUT8YC&amp;pg=PA382 |title=The Argentina Reader: History, Culture, Politics, Gabriela Nouzeilles &amp; Graciela R.

On 11 March 1973, Argentina held general elections for the first time in ten years. Perón loyalist [[Héctor Cámpora]] became president and Perón returned from Spain. In a controversial move, he released all left-wing guerrillas held captive at the time in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;''On inauguration day, Cámpora declared an amnesty and released all the captured guerrillas. Although the Montoneros pledged their support for the new Peronist government, ERP simply renewed its campaign. As a result, guerrilla violence rose once more in 1973.'' Guerrillas and Generals: The "Dirty War" in Argentina, Paul H. Lewis, p. 51, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Cámpora resigned in July to allow Perón to win the new elections held in October. However, a feud developed between right-wing Peronists and the Montoneros. The right wing of the Peronist party, the unions, and the Radical Party led by [[Ricardo Balbín]] favoured a social pact between trade unions and employers, rather than a violent socialist revolution.

Right-wingers and Montoneros clashed at Perón's homecoming ceremony, leading to the [[1973 Ezeiza massacre|20 June 1973 Ezeiza massacre]], which resulted in 13 dead and more than 300 wounded. Perón supported the unions, the radicals led by Balbín, and the right-wing Peronists. Among the latter was a former federal police corporal, [[José López Rega]], who was the founder of the ''[[Alianza Anticomunista Argentina]]'' ("Triple A"), paramilitary [[death squad]]s, which had organised the massacre.

On 25 September 1973, the Montoneros assassinated [[José Ignacio Rucci]], general secretary of the CGT ([[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|General Confederation of Labour]]) and took other military actions in retaliation.

=== 1974 ===
On 21 February 1974, the Montoneros killed Teodoro Ponce, a right-wing Peronist labour leader in Rosario.&lt;ref&gt;[[Facts on File, 1974]]&lt;/ref&gt; He had sought refuge in a local business after being shot at while driving by a carload of masked gunmen. One of the gunmen who got out of the car shot him dead while he lay on the floor and also shot a woman, who screamed out, "Murderer."

In May 1974, Perón expelled the Montoneros from the [[Justicialist]] movement. The Montoneros waited until after the death of Perón in July 1974 to react.  They claimed to have the "social revolutionary vision of authentic Peronism" and started guerrilla operations against the government. The more radically right-wing factions quickly took control of the government; [[Isabel Perón]], president since Juan Perón's death, was essentially a figurehead under the influence of Rega.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

On 15 July 1974, Montoneros assassinated [[Arturo Mor Roig]], a former foreign minister. On 17 July, they murdered [[David Kraiselburd]], journalist and editor-in-chief of ''[[El Día (La Plata)|El Día]]'' newspaper, in the Manuel B. Gonnet suburb of Buenos Aires after an exchange of fire with police.

In September, in order to finance their operations, they kidnapped the two brothers of the [[Bunge and Born]] family business. Some 20 urban guerrillas dressed as policemen shot dead a bodyguard and chauffeur and diverted traffic in this well-orchestrated ambush. Some 30 militants and sympathisers among the civilian population provided safe houses to the guerrillas and a means to escape.&lt;ref&gt;''Terrorism in an Unstable World,'' by Richard L. Clutterbuck, p. 173, Routledge, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; They demanded and received a ransom of $60 million in cash, as well as $1.2 million worth of food and clothing to be given to the poor. According to the [[Guinness Book of Records]], this ransom is the highest ever paid.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Under López Rega's orders, the Triple A began kidnapping, and killing members of Montoneros and the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (ERP), as well as other leftist militant groups. They expanded their attacks to anyone considered a leftist subversive or sympathiser, such as these groups' deputies or lawyers.

The Montoneros and the ERP in turn attacked business and political figures throughout Argentina, and raided military bases for weapons and explosives. The Montoneros killed executives from [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]]. On 16 September 1974, about 40 Montoneros bombs exploded throughout Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/reports/2005/R1909-1.pdf |title=International Terrorism: A Chronology (1974 Supplement) |author=Brian M.

The Peronist guerrillas also held up at gunpoint two trains in a Buenos Aires suburb on 16 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19740916&amp;id=hNFOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JgIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6881,1670256|title=Toledo Blade - Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Montoneros discouraged foreign investment more directly by blowing up the homes of their executives. For example, in 1975 the homes of five executives of Lazar Laboratories were bombed in the suburb of La Plata in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name="foia.state.gov"/&gt; The violence was widespread.

=== 1975 ===
On 7 February, four carloads of Montoneros intercepted the car driven by Antonio Muscat, a manager of the Bunge y Born firm, and shot him dead in the presence of his daughter. On 14 February 1975, Montoneros killed Hipólito Acuña, a politician, as he parked his car outside his home in the city of Santa Fe.
On 18 February, Montoneros gunmen killed Félix Villafañe of the FITAM S.A. workers union, in the presence of his wife in the suburb of San Isidro in Buenos Aires. On 22 February 1975, in an ambush in the Lomas de Zamora suburb of Buenos Aires, three policemen (First Sergeant Nicolás Cardozo, Corporal Roberto Roque Fredes and Constables Eugenio Rodriguez and Abel Pascuzzi) were killed after their patrol car came under fire from Montoneros guerrillas. On 26 February 1975, the Montoneros kidnapped 62-year-old John Patrick Egan, a U.S. consular agent in the city of Córdoba, executing him two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infobae.com/2013/11/11/1522845-cuando-montoneros-secuestro-y-mato-al-consul-estados-unidos|title=Cuando Montoneros secuestró y mató al cónsul de Estados Unidos|work=infobae|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same day, they killed three policemen in another ambush by urban guerrillas in Buenos Aires, and an army conscript in Tucumán province was reported to have been killed in action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PesgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7XEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3532,33484&amp;dq= |title=The Day, March 1, 1975 |publisher=Google  |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 March 1975, a Montoneros bomb detonated in the underground parking at Plaza Colón of the Argentine Army High Command; a garbage truck driver (Alberto Blas García) was killed and 28 others were wounded,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RcU0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jI8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2936,3732517&amp;dq= "Powerful bomb"], ''Ellensburg Daily Record,'' 15 March 1976&lt;/ref&gt; including four colonels and 18 other ranks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XuQNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gm0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5477,1507913&amp;hl=en "Argentine Blast Kills 1"], ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,'' 16 March 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In early June 1975, Montoneros guerrillas murdered executives David Bargut and Raul Amelong of the Acindar steel firm in Rosario, in reprisal for alleged repression against striking employees.&lt;ref&gt;Latin America, 1975, al Kosut, Chris Hunt, Grace M.

On 12 June 1975, in an ambush in the capital of the Córdoba province, three policemen (Pedro Ramón Enrico, Carlos Alberto Galíndez and corporal Luis Francisco Rodríguez) were killed by guerrillas. On 25 July 1975 four policemen were wounded in guerrilla attacks using bazookas and firebombs.

The Montoneros' leadership was keen to learn from the ERP's ''Compañía de Monte Ramón Rosa Jiménez'' operating in the Andean province of Tucumán. In 1975 they sent "observers" to spend a few months with the ERP platoons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9nFyZaZGthgC&amp;pg=PA230&amp;dq=montoneros+sent+observers+tucuman |title=Terrorism in Context, Martha Crenshaw, p. 230, Penn State Press, 1995 |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; operating against the 5th Infantry Brigade, then consisting of the 19th, 20th and 29th Mountain Infantry Regiments.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian J. English, ''Armed Forces of Latin America: Their Histories, Development, Present Strength, and Military Potential,'' Janes Information Group, 1984, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 August 1975 the Montoneros planted a bomb in a culvert at the Tucumán air base airstrip. The blast destroyed an air force C-130 transport carrying 116 anti-guerrilla commandos of the [[Argentine National Gendarmerie|Gendarmerie]], killing five and wounding 40, one of whom later died of his injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Burzaco, pp. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt;

The network of Montoneros militants had been largely uprooted by the government in the capital of Tucumán province. In August 1975, several hundred Montoneros militants took to the streets in Córdoba, to divert attention from the military operations being waged in the mountains of Tucumán. They shot and killed five policemen (Sergeant Juan Carlos Román, Corporal Rosario del Carmen Moyano and Agents Luis Rodolfo López,  Jorge Natividad Luna and Juan Antonio Diaz)&lt;ref&gt;In memoriam, Volume 2, p. 539 and p. 549, Círculo Militar, República Argentina, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; after attacking their headquarters and bombed the police radio communications centre.&lt;ref name="news.google.com"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vdJGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6XsMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3887,3282259&amp;dq= "5 Policemen Dead In Argentina Violence". ''Times-Union'', 21 August 1975]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the elite 4th Airborne Infantry Brigade, which had been ordered to assist operations in Tucumán province, was kept in Córdoba for the rest of the year.

On 5 October 1975, the Montoneros carried out a complex operation against a regiment of the 5th Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9nFyZaZGthgC&amp;pg=PA236 |title=Terrorism in Context |author=Martha Crenshaw, |pages= 236| publisher= Penn State Press, |date=1995 |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this attack named ''[[Operation Primicia]]'' ("Operation Scoop") a Montoneros force numbering an estimated several hundred guerrillas and underground supporters, set in motion an assault on an army barracks in [[Formosa Province|Formosa province]]. On 5 October 1975, Montoneros members hijacked a civilian airliner bound for [[Corrientes, Argentina|Corrientes]] from Buenos Aires. The guerrillas redirected the plane to Formosa, and took over the provincial airport, killing policeman Neri Argentino Alegre in the process. With tactical support from a local militant group, the invaders attacked the barracks of the 29th Infantry Regiment with gunfire and hand grenades. They shot several soldiers who had been resting in their quarters.&lt;ref name="Heriberto J E Roman"&gt;{{cite web|author=Heriberto J E Roman |url=http://argentinahechoshistoricos.blogspot.com/2008/08/ataque-al-regimiento-de-infanteria-de.html#prof |title=Montoneros ataca a un Regimiento del Ejército Argentino |publisher=Argentinahechoshistoricos.blogspot.com |date=27 February 2004 |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the soldiers and NCOs got over their initial surprise, they mounted stiff resistance to the attacking Montoneros. In total, a second lieutenant (Ricardo Massaferro), sergeant (Víctor Sanabria) and ten conscripts (Antonio Arrieta, Heriberto Avalos, José Coronel, Dante Salvatierra, Ismael Sánchez, Tomás Sánchez, Edmundo Roberto Sosa, Marcelino Torales, Alberto Villalba and Hermindo Luna) were killed and several wounded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lamañanaonline.com.ar/inicio.php?s=1&amp;c=3&amp;id=23366 Homenaje del RIMte 29, a 38 años del ataque montonero]&lt;/ref&gt; The Montoneros lost 16 killed in total.&lt;ref name="Heriberto J E Roman"/&gt; Two policemen later died of their wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=r5cuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lqEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=987,2124967&amp;hl=en |title=Argentina to answer rebels 'with the language of guns'|work=The Montreal Gazette |date= 8 October 1975 |publisher=Google  |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Montoneros escaped by air into a remote area in adjoining [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe province]]. The aircraft, a [[Boeing 737]], landed in a crop field not far from the city of [[Rafaela]]. The Peronist guerrillas fled to waiting cars on a highway nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Hf1jAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HOcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1098,1842894&amp;hl=en |title=Argentine troops rout rebel raid |work= The Sydney Morning Herald |date= 7 October 1975 |publisher=Google  |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sophistication of the operation, and the getaway cars and hideouts they used to escape the military crackdown, suggest the involvement of several hundred guerrillas and civilian sympathisers in Montoneros' organisation. In a controversial move under the presidency of [[Nestor Kirchner]], the families of all the Montoneros killed in the attack were each later compensated with the payment of around US$200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1403475-polemica-por-una-lista-de-indemnizaciones|title=Polémica por una lista de indemnizaciones|author=Mariano De Vedia|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 October 1975, a Catholic youth leader, Juan Ignacio Isla Casares, with the help of the Montoneros commander Eduardo Pereira Rossi (nom de guerre "El Carlón") was the mastermind behind the ambush and killing of five policemen (Pedro Dettle, Juan Ramón Costa, Carlos Livio Cejas, Cleofás Galeano and Juan Fernández) near near San Isidro Cathedral. 

During February 1976, the Montoneros sent assistance to the hard-pressed ''Compañía de Monte Ramón Rosa Jiménez'' fighting in Tucumán province, in the form of a company of their elite "Jungle Troops", while the ERP backed them up with a company of their guerrillas from Cordoba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NtZ3EvNYxjYC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=general+vila%27s+forces+numbered#PPA126,M1 |title=Guerrillas and Generals: The Dirty War in Argentina |author= Paul H.

While the ERP fought the army in Tucumán, the Montoneros were active in Buenos Aires. Montoneros' leadership dismissed the tactics of the ERP in Tucumán as "old fashioned" and "inappropriate" but still sent reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, page 195&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 October 1975 five policemen (Pedro Dettle, Juan Ramón Costa, Carlos Livio Cejas, Cleofás Galeano and Juan Fernández) were killed in Buenos Aires when Montoneros guerrillas ambushed their patrol cars near the San Isidro Cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foia.state.gov/documents/Argentina/00009FBD.pdf |title=Unclassified Telegram from US Embassy Buenos Aires |format=PDF |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the captured policemen were reported to have been executed in this operation under the orders of the Montoneros commander Eduardo Pereyra Rossi (nom de guerre Carlon).&lt;ref&gt;30.000 Desaparecidos: Realidad, Mito y Dogma, Guillermo Rojas, Page 246, Editorial Santiago Apóstol, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1975, Montoneros raided an armaments factory in the capital's Munro neighbourhood, fleeing with 250 assault rifles and sub-machine guns. That same month, a Montoneros bomb exploded at the headquarters of the Argentine army in Buenos Aires, injuring at least six soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HPBLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=c-0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3050,5982817&amp;dq= |title=Argentine theatre hit by bomb The Spokesman-Review December 31, 1975 |publisher=Google  |date=31 December 1975|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1975, a total of 137 army officers, NCOs and conscripts and policemen had been killed that year and approximately 3,000 wounded by left wing terrorism. U.S. journalist Paul Hoeffel in an article written for the Boston Globe concluded that, "Although there is widespread reluctance to use the term, it is now impossible to ignore the fact that civil war has broken out in Argentina."&lt;ref&gt;Argentine army resists takeover to trap would-be rebels, Paul Hoeffel, ''The Boston Globe'', 18 January 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

Montoneros were inspired by the British and Italian wartime commando raids on warships, and on 1 November 1974 Montoneros successfully blew up General Commissioner Alberto Villar, the chief of the Argentine federal police in his yacht.

In January 1976, the son of retired Lieutenant-General Julio Alsogoray, Juan Alsogaray (El Hippie), copied from his father's safe a draft of "Battle Order 24 March" and passed it to the head of the Montoneros intelligence, [[Rodolfo Walsh]], who informed the guerrilla leadership of the planned military coup.&lt;ref&gt;Political violence and trauma in Argentina, By Antonius C.

That same month, Ireneo Garnica and Alejandro Díaz, both railway workers who had refused to participate in a strike, were killed when Montoneros threw a bomb at them in the suburb of Quilmes in Buenos Aires.

Adriana and Gaspar Tasca, both identified as Montoneros, were taken into custody between 7 and 10 December 1977 and remain unaccounted for. On 6 October 1978, José Pérez Rojo and Patricia Roisinblit, both Montoneros members, were made to disappear.

Estimates by human rights organisations estimate up to 30,000&lt;/ref&gt; are estimated to have disappeared and died during the military dictatorship that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983. Some 12,000 of the missing known as the ''detenidos-desaparecidos'', survived detention&lt;ref name="elortiba.org"/&gt; and were later compensated for their ordeal. On the other hand, according to an NGO dedicated to defending "victims of terrorism", 1,355 people, including members of the police and military, were killed by Montoneros and other left-wing armed movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/20111228/internacional/abci-victoria-villarruel-entrevista-201112280343.html|title=Las víctimas del terror montonero no cuentan en Argentina|work=ABC.es|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Falklands War]] against Great Britain, the Argentine military conceived the aborted [[Operation Algeciras]], a covert plan to support and convince some Commando-trained Montoneros, by appealing to their patriotism, to sabotage [[British Forces Gibraltar|British military facilities]] in [[Gibraltar]]. Argentina's defeat led to the fall of the junta, and [[Raúl Alfonsín]] became president in December 1983, thus initiating the [[democratic transition]].

India is a bastion for socialist parties. Almost all the parties profess welfare schemes, freebie culture etc. as a part of electoral politics. Even the ruling [[Bharatiya Janata Party|Bharatiya janata party]], which is considered as a right wing party, gives free groceries to poor people in one of its ruling states as a tactic to fight left wing terrorism. However, some parties have stated their ideology as left oriented and most of them have formed a political block called "Left Front" in the states of West /bengal from 1977 and in Tripura also from 1993.

[[File:Steam narrowboat President - geograph.org.uk - 679005.jpg|thumb|right|''President'' in 1986]]

'''''President''''' is a historic, [[steamboat|steam-powered]] [[narrowboat]], built in 1909 by [[Fellows Morton and Clayton]] (FMC) at their dock at [[Saltley]], Birmingham, England. It is now owned by the [[Black Country Living Museum]], where it is based.
''President'' is registered by [[National Historic Ships]] as part of the [[National Historic Fleet]].

In 1925, the [[Ruston, Proctor and Company]] steam boiler and engine were replaced by a 15&amp;nbsp;hp [[Bolinder-Munktell|Bolinder]] crude oil engine.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Ernest Thomas, a director of FMC, and a Walsall-based coal carrier, acquired the boat in 1946.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; She was sold to George and Matthews of Wolverhampton in 1948,&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; but that year the UK's canals were nationalised and she finished her working days as part of [[British Waterways]]' northern maintenance fleet, on the [[Trent and Mersey Canal|Trent and Mersey]], [[Macclesfield Canal|Macclesfield]] and [[Shropshire Union Canal|Shropshire Union]] canals, from a base at Northwich.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

== Preservation ==

''President'' was bought by Nicholas Bostock and Malcolm Braine in 1973, as a derelict hull.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; They restored the hull and constructed a replica cabin and boiler room.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; A 1928 Muir and Findley "[[Scotch marine boiler|Scotch]]" return boiler, similar to that originally used, but operating at 100 PSI was acquired and fitted,&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; as was a twin cylinder steam engine, originally used in a Thames launch.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; The boat returned to service in 1978.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

''President'' was purchased by the [[Black Country Living Museum]] in January 1983.&lt;ref name="nbp" /&gt;  The boiler was replaced by a Cochran dryback return flue boiler in 1990.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  A major refit took place from 2001–2003, including the provision of a new steam engine, pipework and cabin, plus major hull repairs.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

''President'', in FMC livery, normally operates with a [[butty boat]], ''Kildare''.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

The '''Republican Police Corps''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Corpo di Polizia Repubblicana'') was a police force of the [[Italian Social Republic]] during the [[Italian Civil War]].

== History ==
The Republican Police Corps was established in December 1944 as part of the Italian Armed Forces, within the territory controlled by the Italian Social Republic. The force was established in order to carry out law enforcement and public security duties alongside the [[National Republican Guard (Italy)|National Republican Guard]].

The Police Corps inherited civilian officials both from the Directorate General of Public Security and from the former Public Security Agents Corps. The organization of the police force in the Fascist-led Republic anticipated that of the [[Polizia di Stato|Italian State Police]] established in 1981. The Republican Police Corps was a single government agency, which set it apart from the previous organization (which was upheld in post-war Italy). Previously, the police consisted of civilian police officials and military-organized agents.&lt;ref name="Dal 1925 al 1944"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dal 1925 al 1944|url=http://www.poliziadistato.it/articolo/1460-Dal_1925_al_1944/|website=Polizia di Stato|accessdate=1 September 2014|language=Italian|year=2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006065422/http://www.poliziadistato.it/articolo/1460-Dal_1925_al_1944/|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the war, the Republican Police Corps was reabsorbed into the Directorate General of Public Security. The police activities were not carried uniformly: there were [[Nazi Germany|German]] (particularly [[Waffen-SS]]) interferences and power abuses made by political authorities.{{cn|date=September 2014}}

== Organization ==
The Republican Police Corps numbered about 20 000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Canosa|first1=Romano|title=La polizia in Italia dal 1945 ad oggi|date=1976|publisher=Il Mulino|location=Bologna}}&lt;/ref&gt; deployed mostly in provincial capital cities; they were framed into 10 Regional Inspectorates and 66 Questure (provincial-level commands), 2 Speciality schools in Padua, escort teams detached at the Ministries, including the "Public Security Presidential Squad" ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Squadra Presidenziale di Pubblica Sicurezza'') tasked with [[Benito Mussolini]]'s personal security. There were also operational mobile units, in order to carry out counter-guerrilla warfare and territorial control duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cucut|first1=Carlo|title=Le forze armate della RSI 1943-1945|date=2005|publisher=Gruppo Modellistico Trentino di studio e ricerca storica|location=Trento|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The counter-guerrilla units, belonging to police forces, were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crippa|first1=Paolino|title=REPARTI CORAZZATI DELLA POLIZIA REPUBBLICANA e BRIGATE NERE|url=http://www.zimmerit.com/zimmeritpedia/italia_rsi/ITALIA_RSI_MUTI.html|website=ZimmeriT|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 6 military-organized battalions;
* Mobile Autonomous Legion "[[Ettore Muti]]", led by [[Colonel]] Franco Colombo;
* Special Inspectorate Anti-Partisan Police;
* Police Arditi Legion "Caruso".
Each Questura had a company-sized public order duty; also the Regional Inspectorates had analogous units. Alongside the regular police forces, did exist some "special police units", including ill-famed "[[Banda Koch]]" (formally known as "''Reparto Speciale di Polizia Repubblicana''" or "Republican Police Special Unit") active in [[Rome]], "Banda Carità" (also known as "''Reparto Servizi Speciali''" or "Special Services Unit") active in [[Florence]] and [[Padua]], and other so-called "Repression bands". Most of these band members were heavy sentenced or [[Extra-judicial killing|extra-judicially killed]] in the immediate aftermaths of [[World War II]].

== Chiefs of the Republican Police Corps ==
* [[Tullio Tamburini]], from October, 1st 1943 to April 1944;
* Eugenio Cerruti, from April 1944 to October 1944;
* Renzo Montagna, from October, 6th 1944 to April, 25th 1945.

Retention periods vary with different types of information, based on content and a variety of other factors, including internal organizational need, regulatory requirements for inspection or audit, legal statutes of limitation, involvement in litigation, and taxation and financial reporting needs, as well as other factors as defined by local, regional, state, national, and/or international governing entities.&lt;ref name="CunninghamTheLaw06"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4YIdn6lk7NoC&amp;pg=PA103 |chapter=Records Retention and Disposition |title=The Lawyer's Guide to Records Management and Retention |author=Cunningham, G.C.; Montaña, J.C. |publisher=American Bar Association |pages=103–118 |year=2006 |isbn=9781590314500 |accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HamerTheICSA11"&gt;{{cite book |title=The ICSA Guide to Document Retention |author=Hamer, A.C. |publisher=ICSA Publishing Ltd |pages=338 |year=2011 |isbn=9781860724732}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Once an applicable retention period has elapsed for a given type or series of information, and all holds/moratoriums have been released, the information is typically destroyed using an approved and effective destruction method, which renders the information completely and irreversibly unusable via any means. Information with historical value beyond its "usable value" may be accessioned to the custody of an archive organization for permanent or extended long-term preservation.&lt;ref name="CunninghamTheLaw06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HamerTheICSA11" /&gt;

==Defensible disposition==
Defensible disposition refers to the ability of an identified and applied retention period to effectively provide for the defense of the record, and its eventual destruction or accessioning when scrutinized within a court of law or by other review.

It is commonly advised by [[Records management|records and information management]] (RIM) professionals that any and all retention periods applied to organizational information should be reviewed and approved for use by competent legal counsel, which represents the organization, and is familiar with the specific business needs and legal and regulatory requirements of the organization. Additionally, a practical approach to information assessment/classification, proper documentation of the disposition program, strategic review of disposition policy over time for efficacy are required for proper defensible disposition.&lt;ref name="SmallwoodInfo14"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Defensible Disposal: The Only Real Way to Manage Terabytes and Petabytes |title=Information Governance: Concepts, Strategies, and Best Practices |author=Kahn, R. |editor=Smallwood, R.F. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=130–137 |year=2014 |isbn=9781118218303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Samaritans''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|m|ær|ɪ|t|ən|z}}; [[Samaritan Hebrew]]: {{lang|smp|ࠔࠠࠌࠝࠓࠩࠉࠌ}}, &lt;small&gt;{{color|#0645AD|translit.}}&lt;/small&gt; ''{{transl|smp|Shamerim}}'' ({{Hebrew|שַמֶרִים}}), "Guardians/Keepers/Watchers (of the Torah)") are an [[ethnoreligious group]] of the [[Levant]] originating from the [[Israelites]] (or [[Hebrews]]) of the [[Ancient Near East]].

Ancestrally, Samaritans claim descent from the [[tribe of Ephraim]] and [[tribe of Manasseh]] (two sons of [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]]) as well as from the [[Levite]]s,&lt;ref name="tsu"/&gt; who have links to ancient [[Samaria]] (now constituting the majority of the territory known as the West Bank) from the period of their entry into [[Canaan]], while some Orthodox Jews suggest that it was from the beginning of the Babylonian captivity up to the Samaritan polity under the rule of [[Baba Rabba]]. Samaritans used to include descendants who ascribed to the Benjamin tribe, but this line became extinct in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Schreiber|first=Monika|title=The Comfort of Kin: Samaritan Community, Kinship, and Marriage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4We7AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA29+|year=2014|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-27425-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Samaritan tradition, the split between them and the [[Judean]]-led Southern Israelites began during the biblical time of the priest [[Eli (biblical figure)|Eli]] when the Southern Israelites split off from the central Israelite tradition, as they perceive it.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Fried|first=Lisbeth S.|title=Ezra and the Law in History and Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQHQBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT148|year=2014|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-61117-410-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Talmud]], a central post-exilic religious text of [[Rabbinic Judaism]], the Samaritans are called ''Cutheans'' ({{lang-he|כּוּתִים}}, ''Kutim''), referring to the ancient city of [[Kutha]], geographically located in what is today [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Burgess|first=Henry|authorlink=Henry Burgess (priest)|title=Journal of Sacred Literature and Biblical Record, April 1855 to July 1855|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yKZ87hSOJkQC&amp;pg=PA481|year=2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-7661-5612-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the biblical account, however, Kuthah was one of several cities from which people were brought to Samaria,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Lipschitz|first1=Oded|last2=Knoppers|first2=Gary N.|authorlink2=Gary N.

"According to the rabbis, his emblem was a [[rooster|cock]]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clarke.biblecommenter.com/2_kings/17.htm|title=Clarke's Commentary on the Bible - 2 Kings 17:30|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern genetics partially support both the claims of the Samaritans and the account in the [[Hebrew Bible]] (and Talmud), suggesting that the genealogy of the Samaritans lies in some combination of these two accounts.&lt;ref name="evolutsioon.ut.ee"/&gt; Genetically, modern Samaritan populations are found to have "much greater affinity" genetically to Jews than to neighbouring Palestinian Arabs.&lt;ref name="Genetics and the Jewish identity"&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Features/Genetics-and-the-Jewish-identity Genetics and the Jewish identity] By DIANA MUIR APPELBAUM, PAUL S. APPELBAUM, MD \ 02/11/2008, Jerusalem Post&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the Samaritans remained a genetically isolated population.&lt;ref name="Genetics and the Jewish identity"/&gt;

The Samaritans are adherents of [[Samaritanism]], a religion closely related to [[Judaism]]. Samaritans believe that their worship, which is based on the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-wn8ABo-Fz0C&amp;pg=PR7#v=onepage&amp;q=samaritans%20gerizim&amp;f=false|title=The Israelite Samaritan Version of the Torah|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015|isbn=9780802865199|author1=Tsedaka|first1=Benyamim|date=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the true [[origins of Judaism|religion]] of the ancient Israelites from before the [[Babylonian captivity]], preserved by those who remained in the [[Land of Israel]], as opposed to Judaism, which they see as a related but altered and amended religion, brought back by those returning from the Babylonian Captivity. The Samaritans believe that [[Mount Gerizim]] was the original Holy Place of Israel from the time that [[Joshua]] conquered Canaan. The major issue between Jews and Samaritans has always been the location of the Chosen Place to worship God: The [[Temple Mount]] of Moriah in Jerusalem according to the Jewish faith or Mount Gerizim according to the Samaritan faith.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;

Once a large community, the Samaritan population appears to have shrunk significantly in the wake of the bloody suppression of the [[Samaritan Revolts]] (mainly in 529 CE and 555 CE) against the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Conversion to [[Christianity]] under the Byzantines also reduced their numbers. Conversions to [[Islam]] took place as well,&lt;ref name="autogenerated257"&gt;M.

Samaritans have a stand-alone religious status in Israel, and there are occasional conversions from Judaism to Samaritanism and vice versa due to marriages. While the Israeli [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinic authorities]] consider Samaritanism to be a branch of Judaism,&lt;ref&gt;Shulamit Sela, ''The Head of the Rabbanite, Karaite and Samaritan Jews: On the History of a Title'', Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 57, No. 2 (1994), pp. 255–267&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] requires Samaritans to officially go through a formal [[conversion to Judaism]] in order to be recognized as [[Who is a Jew?#Halakhic perspective|Halakhic Jews]]. One example is Israeli TV personality [[Sofi Tsedaka]], who formally converted to Rabbinic Judaism at the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/54/ART2/155/455.html|title=- - nrg - ... :|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4234099,00.html|title=ynet סופי צדקה עושה שבת (וחג) - יהדות|work=ynet|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samaritans with Israeli citizenship are obligated to undertake mandatory service in the [[Israel Defense Forces]], while those with dual Israeli-Palestinian citizenship (living in Qiryat Luza) are generally exempted.

==Etymology==
There is conflict over the etymology of the name for the Samaritans in Hebrew, stemming from the fact that they are referred to differently in different dialects of Hebrew. This has accompanied controversy over whether the Samaritans are named after the geographic area of Samaria (the northern part of what is now globally known as the West Bank), or whether the area received its name from the group. This distinction is controversial in part because different interpretations can be used to justify or deny claims of ancestry over this region, which has been deeply contested in modern times.

In [[Samaritan Hebrew]], the Samaritans call themselves "Shamerim" (שַמֶרִים), which according to the Anchor Bible Dictionary, is derived from the Ancient Hebrew term meaning "Guardians/Keepers/Watchers [of the [[Torah]]/Law]".&lt;ref&gt;David Noel Freedman, ''The Anchor Bible Dictionary'', 5:941 (New York: Doubleday, 1996, c1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biblical Hebrew]] ''Šomerim''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biblical Hebrew Lexicon entry#SMRI|url=http://www.blbclassic.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H8104&amp;t=KJV|work=Blue Letter Bible|publisher=King James Version|author=Gesenius Biblical Hebrew Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ar|السامريون|al-Sāmiriyyūn}})&lt;ref name="Manzur"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ibn Manzur|authorlink=Ibn Manzur|title=Lisan al Arab|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EY5QAAAACAAJ|volume=21|date=|publisher=Al-dar al-Misriya li-l-talif wa-l-taryamar|isbn=978-0-86685-541-9|chapter=entry SMR}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Guardians" (singular ''Šomer'') comes from the Hebrew [[Semitic root]] שמר, which means "to watch, guard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gessinius Lexicon Hebrew entry#H8104|url=http://www.blbclassic.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H8104&amp;t=KJV|work=Hebrew|publisher=Blue Letter Bible}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, Samaria was the key geographical concentration of the Samaritan community. Thus, it may suggest the region of Samaria is named after the Samaritans, rather than the Samaritans being named after the region. In Jewish tradition, however, it is sometimes claimed that Mount Samaria, meaning "Watch Mountain", is actually named so because watchers used to watch from those mountains for approaching armies from Egypt in ancient times.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} In [[Modern Hebrew]], the Samaritans are called {{lang-he|{{Hebrew|שומרונים}}|Shomronim}}, which would appear to simply mean "inhabitants of Samaria". This is a politically sensitive distinction.

That the etymology of the Samaritans' [[ethnonym]] in Samaritan Hebrew is derived from "Guardians/Keepers/Watchers [of the Law/Torah]", as opposed to Samaritans being named after the region of Samaria, has in history been supported by a number of Christian Church fathers, including [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] in the ''[[Panarion]]'', [[Jerome]] and [[Eusebius]] in the ''[[Chronicon]]'' and [[Origen]] in ''The Commentary on Saint John's Gospel'', and in some [[Talmud]]ic commentary of [[Tanhuma]] on Genesis 31, and [[Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer]] 38, p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;ref name="Pummer2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Reinhard Pummer|title=Early Christian Authors on Samaritans and Samaritanism: Texts, Translations and Commentary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dhDlzh--Q2AC&amp;pg=PA123|year=2002|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-147831-4|pages=123, 42, 156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coggins1975"&gt;{{cite book|author=R.

==Origins==
{{Tribes of Israel}}

===Samaritan sources===
According to Samaritan tradition, Mount Gerizim was the original Holy Place of the Israelites from the time that Joshua conquered Canaan and the tribes of Israel settled the land. The reference to Mount Gerizim derives from the biblical story of Moses ordering Joshua to take the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel]] to the mountains by Shekhem ([[Nablus]]) and place half of the tribes, six in number, on Mount Gerizim, the Mount of the Blessing, and the other half on [[Mount Ebal]], the Mount of the Curse. The two mountains were used to symbolize the significance of the commandments and serve as a warning to whoever disobeyed them (Deut. 11:29; 27:12; Josh. 8:33).

Samaritans claim they are Israelite descendants of the Northern Israelite tribes of [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]] and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]], who survived the destruction of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)]] by the [[Assyria]]ns in 722 BCE.

Samaritan historiography places the basic schism from the remaining part of Israel after the tribes of Israel conquered and returned to the land of [[Canaan]], led by Joshua. In its account, after Joshua's death, [[Eli (Bible)|Eli]] the priest left the Tabernacle which Moses erected in the desert and established on Mount Gerizim and built another one under his own rule in the hills of [[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shiloh]].

[[Abu l-Fath]], who in the 14th century wrote a major work of Samaritan history, comments on Samaritan origins as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''The Keepers, An Introduction to the History and Culture of the Samaritans'', by Robert T. Anderson and Terry Giles, Hendrickson Publishing, 2002, pages 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A terrible civil war broke out between Eli son of Yafni, of the line of Ithamar, and the sons of Pincus ([[Phinehas]]), because Eli son of Yafni resolved to usurp the High Priesthood from the descendants of Pincus. He used to offer sacrifices on an altar of stones. He was 50 years old, endowed with wealth and in charge of the treasury of the Children of Israel. ...

He offered a sacrifice on the altar, but without salt, as if he were inattentive. When the Great High Priest Ozzi learned of this, and found the sacrifice was not accepted, he thoroughly disowned him; and it is (even) said that he rebuked him.

Thereupon he and the group that sympathized with him, rose in revolt and at once he and his followers and his beasts set off for Shiloh. Thus Israel split in factions. He sent to their leaders saying to them, ''Anyone who would like to see wonderful things, let him come to me.'' Then he assembled a large group around him in Shiloh, and built a Temple for himself there; he constructed a place like the Temple (on [[Mount Gerizim]]). He built an altar, omitting no detail—it all corresponded to the original, piece by piece.

At this time the Children of Israel split into three factions. A loyal faction on [[Mount Gerizim]]; a heretical faction that followed false gods; and the faction that followed Eli son of Yafni in Shiloh.}}

Further, the ''Samaritan Chronicle Adler'', or New Chronicle, believed to have been composed in the 18th century using earlier chronicles as sources states:

{{quote|And the Children of Israel in his days divided into three groups. One did according to the abominations of the [[Gentile]]s and served other gods; another followed Eli the son of Yafni, although many of them turned away from him after he had revealed his intentions; and a third remained with the High Priest Uzzi ben Bukki, the chosen place.}}

The emergence of the Samaritans as an ethnic and religious community distinct from other [[Levant]] peoples appears to have occurred at some point after the Assyrian conquest of the Israelite [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] in approximately 721 BCE. The records of [[Sargon II]] of [[Assyria]] indicate that he deported 27,290 inhabitants of the former kingdom.

Jewish tradition affirms the Assyrian deportations and replacement of the previous inhabitants by forced resettlement by other peoples but claims a different ethnic origin for the Samaritans. The Talmud accounts for a people called [[Kutha|"Cuthim"]] on a number of occasions, mentioning their arrival by the hands of the Assyrians. According to [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Josephus]],&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' 9.277–91&lt;/ref&gt; the people of Israel were removed by the king of the Assyrians ([[Sargon II]])&lt;ref&gt;See the wording of 2 Kings 17 which mentions [[Shalmaneser V|Shalmaneser]] in verse 3 but the "king of the Assyrians" from verse 4 onward.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Halah]], to [[Tell Halaf|Gozan]] on the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] and to the towns of the [[Medes]]. The king of the Assyrians then brought people from [[Babylon]], [[Kutha|Cuthah]], [[Avah]], Emath, and [[Sepharvaim]] to place in Samaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2 Kings|17:24|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because God sent lions among them to kill them, the king of the Assyrians sent one of the priests from Bethel to teach the new settlers about God's ordinances. The eventual result was that the new settlers worshiped both the God of the land and their own gods from the countries from which they came.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2 Kings|17:25-33|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This account is contradicted by the version in [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]],&lt;ref&gt;Yitzakh Magen, "The Dating of the First Phase of the Samaritan Temple on Mt Gerizim in Light of Archaeological Evidence", in Oded Lipschitz, Gary N. Knoppers, Rainer Albertz (eds.) ''Judah and the Judeans in the Fourth Century B.C.E.'', Eisenbrauns, 2007 pp. 157–212. p. 187 'The author of Chronicles conceals the information that is given prominence in Kings, and vice versa.' 'The books of [[Ezra]] and [[Nehemiah]] adopt a narrow sectarian approach that seeks to maintain the uniqueness and racial purity of the exiles in Babylonia, while Chronicles is more broad-minded and views the Israelite nation as a great people that includes all the tribes, both Judah and Israel.'&lt;/ref&gt; where, following Samaria's destruction, King [[Hezekiah]] is depicted as endeavouring to draw the [[Ephraimites]] and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manassites]] closer to [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. Temple repairs at the time of [[Josiah]] were financed by money from all "the remnant of Israel" in Samaria, including from Manasseh, Ephraim, and Benjamin.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|2Chronicles|34:9|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremiah likewise speaks of people from Shekhem, Shiloh, and Samaria who brought offerings of frankincense and grain to the House of YHWH.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Jeremiah|41:5|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronicles makes no mention of an Assyrian resettlement.&lt;ref&gt;Yitzakh Magen, "The Dating of the First Phase of the Samaritan Temple on Mt Gerizim in Light of Archaeological Evidence", in Oded Lipschitz, Gary N. Knoppers, Rainer Albertz (eds.) ''Judah and the Judeans in the Fourth Century B.C.E.,'' Eisenbrauns, 2007 pp. 157–212. p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; Yitzakh Magen argues that the version of Chronicles is perhaps closer to the historical truth and that the Assyrian settlement was unsuccessful, a notable Israelite population remained in Samaria, part of which, following the conquest of Judah, fled south and settled there as refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Yitzakh Magen, "The Dating of the First Phase of the Samaritan Temple on Mt Gerizim in Light of Archaeological Evidence", in Oded Lipschitz, Gary N. Knoppers, Rainer Albertz (eds.) ''Judah and the Judeans in the Fourth Century B.C.E.'', Eisenbrauns, 2007 pp. 157–212. p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Midrash ([[Genesis Rabbah]] Sect. 94) relates about an encounter between [[Rabbi Meir]] and a Samaritan. The story that developed includes the following dialogue:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Rabbi Meir: What tribe are you from?
The Samaritan: From Joseph.
Rabbi Meir: No!
The Samaritan: From which one then?
Rabbi Meir: From Issachar.
The Samaritan: How do you figure?
Rabbi Meir: For it is written (Gen 46:13): The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puvah, Iob, and Shimron. These are the Samaritans (shamray).&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Adam Zertal|Zertal]] dates the Assyrian onslaught at 721 BCE to 647 BCE and discusses three waves of imported settlers. He shows that Mesopotamian pottery in Samaritan territory cluster around the lands of Menasheh and that the type of pottery found was produced around 689 BCE. Some date their split with the Jews to the time of [[Nehemiah]], [[Ezra]], and the building of the [[Second Temple]] in Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile. Returning exiles considered the Samaritans to be non-Israelites and, thus, not fit for this religious work.

The ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'' (under "Samaritans") summarizes both past and present views on the Samaritans' origins. It says:

{{quote|sign=|source="Samaritans" in ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', 1972, Volume 14, col. 727.|Until the middle of the 20th century it was customary to believe that the Samaritans originated from a mixture of the people living in Samaria and other peoples at the time of the conquest of Samaria by Assyria (722–721 BCE). The biblical account in II Kings 17 had long been the decisive source for the formulation of historical accounts of Samaritan origins. Reconsideration of this passage, however, has led to more attention being paid to the Chronicles of the Samaritans themselves. With the publication of Chronicle II (Sefer ha-Yamim), the fullest Samaritan version of their own history became available: the chronicles, and a variety of non-Samaritan materials.

According to the former, the Samaritans are the direct descendants of the Joseph tribes, Ephraim and Manasseh, and until the 17th century CE they possessed a high priesthood descending directly from Aaron through Eleazar and Phinehas. They claim to have continuously occupied their ancient territory and to have been at peace with other Israelite tribes until the time when Eli disrupted the Northern cult by moving from Shechem to Shiloh and attracting some northern Israelites to his new followers there. For the Samaritans, this was the "schism" par excellence.}}

Furthermore, to this day the Samaritans claim descent from the tribe of Joseph:

{{quote|sign=|source=J. A. Montgomery, ''The Samaritans, the Earliest Jewish Sect: Their History, Theology and Literature'', 1907, p. 32|The laymen also possess their traditional claims. They are all of the tribe of Joseph, except those of the tribe of Benjamin, but this traditional branch of people, which, the Chronicles assert, was established at Gaza in earlier days, seems to have disappeared. There exists an aristocratic feeling amongst the different families in this community, and some are very proud over their pedigree and the great men it had produced.}}

===Dead Sea scrolls===
The [[Dead Sea Scrolls|Dead Sea scroll]] 4Q372 hopes that the northern tribes will return to the land of Joseph. The current dwellers in the north are referred to as fools, an enemy people. However, they are not referred to as foreigners. It goes on to say that the Samaritans mocked Jerusalem and built a temple on a high place to provoke Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lZSl64Or5UMC&amp;dq=4Q372&amp;q=4Q372#v=snippet&amp;q=4Q372&amp;f=false| title=The Origin of the Samaritans| author=Magnar Kartveit |publisher=BRILL |year=2009 |pages=168–171|accessdate=30 January 2014| isbn=9004178198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assyrian account of the conquest and settlement of Samaria===
The account of the Assyrian kings, which was among the archaeological discoveries in Babylon, differs from the Samaritan account, and confirms much of the Jewish biblical account but may differ in regard to the ethnicity of the foreigners settled in Samaria by the Assyrians. At one point, it is simply said that they were from Arabia, while at another, that they were brought from a number of countries conquered by Sargon II:

{{quote|sign=|source=Sargon II Inscriptions, COS{{unverifiable|reason=What exactly is COS?|date=January 2017}} 2.118A, p. 293|the Samarians who had agreed with a hostile king ...I fought with them and decisively defeated them...carried off as spoil. 50 chariots for my royal force...the rest of them I settled in the midst of Assyria. ...The Tamudi, Ibadidi, Marsimani and Hayappa, who live in distant Arabia, in the desert, who knew neither overseer nor commander, who never brought tribute to any king--with the help of Ashshur my lord, I defeated them. I deported the rest of them. I settled them in Samaria/Samerina.}}

Also,

{{quote|sign=|source=Nimrud Prisms, COS 2.118D, pp. 295–296|The inhabitants of Samaria/Samerina, who agreed [and plotted] with a king [hostile to] me, not to do service and not to bring tribute [to Ashshur] and who did battle, I fought against them with the power of the great gods, my lords. I counted as spoil 27,280 people, together with their chariots, and gods, in which they trusted. I formed a unit with 200 of [their] chariots for my royal force. I settled the rest of them in the midst of Assyria. I repopulated Samaria/Samerina more than before. I brought into it people from countries conquered by my hands. I appointed my eunuch as governor over them. And I counted them as Assyrians.}}

==History==
===Iron Age===
The narratives in Genesis about the rivalries among the twelve sons of Jacob are viewed by some as describing tensions between north and south. They were temporarily united in the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Monarchy]], but after the death of Solomon, the kingdom split in two, the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] with its last capital city [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]] and the [[Kingdom of Judah]] with its capital [[Jerusalem]].

The [[Deuteronomistic history]], written in Judah, portrayed Israel as a sinful kingdom, divinely punished for its idolatry and iniquity by being destroyed by the Assyrians in 720 BCE.

The tensions continued in the postexilic period. The [[Books of Kings]] are more inclusive than [[Ezra–Nehemiah]] since the ideal is of one Israel with twelve tribes, whereas the [[Books of Chronicles]] concentrate on the [[Kingdom of Judah]] and ignore the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Coogan, "A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament" page 363, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bechtel |first=Florentine |year=1911|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11472a.htm |title=The Books of Paralimpomenon (Chronicles)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Samaritans claimed that they were the true Israel who were descendants of the "[[Ten Lost Tribes]]" taken into Assyrian captivity. They had their own sacred precinct on [[Mount Gerizim]] and claimed that it was the original sanctuary. Moreover, they claimed that their version of the Pentateuch was the original and that the Jews had a falsified text produced by [[Ezra]] during the Babylonian exile.

Both Jewish and Samaritan religious leaders taught that it was wrong to have any contact with the opposite group, and neither was to enter each other's territories or even to speak to one another. During the [[New Testament]] period, the tensions were exploited by Roman authorities as they likewise had done between rival tribal factions elsewhere, and [[Josephus]] reports numerous violent confrontations between Jews and Samaritans throughout the first half of the first century.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Powell, "Introducing the New Testament: A Historical, Literary, and Theological Survey" 'Ch.01 The People of Palestine at the Time of Jesus', Baker Academic, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persian period===
[[File:Samaritan inscription.jpg|right|thumb|Ancient inscription in [[Samaritan Hebrew]]. From a photo c. 1900 by the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]].]]

According to historian [[Lawrence Schiffman]], throughout the Persian Period, Judeans and Samaritans fought periodically with one another. The Samaritans were a blend of all kinds of people—made up of Israelites who were not exiled when the Northern Kingdom was destroyed in 722 BCE—of various different nationalities whom the Assyrians had resettled in the area. The Assyrians did this as an attempt to ensure that Israel’s national dream could not come true.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Text to Tradition: A History of Second Temple and Rabbinic Judaism|last=Schiffman|first=Lawrence H.|publisher=Ktav Publishing House|year=1991|isbn=|location=NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Jewish version of events, when the Judean exile ended in 539 BCE and the exiles began returning home from Babylon, Samaritans found their former homeland of the north populated by other people who claimed the land as their own and Jerusalem, their former glorious capital, in ruins. The inhabitants worshiped the [[Paganism|Pagan gods]], but when the then-sparsely populated areas became infested with dangerous wild beasts, they appealed to the king of Assyria for Israelite priests to instruct them on how to worship the "God of that country." The result was a syncretistic religion, in which national groups worshiped the Israelite God, but they also served their own gods in accordance with the customs of the nations from which they had been brought.

According to Chronicles 36:22–23, the Persian emperor, [[Cyrus the Great]] (reigned 559–530 BCE), permitted the return of the exiles to their homeland and ordered the [[Second Temple|rebuilding of the Temple]] ([[Zion]]). The prophet Isaiah identified Cyrus as "the Lord's [[Messiah in Judaism|Messiah]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|45:1|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "Messiah" refers to an anointed individual, such as a king or priest.

During the First Temple, it was possible for foreigners to help the Jewish people in an informal way until tension grew between the Samaritans and Judeans. This meant that foreigners could physically move into Judean land and abide by its laws and religion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Ezra 4 says that the local inhabitants of the land offered to assist with the building of the new Temple during the time of [[Zerubbabel]], but their offer was rejected. According to Ezra, this rejection precipitated a further interference not only with the rebuilding of the Temple but also with the reconstruction of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The issue surrounding the Samaritans offer to help rebuild the temple was a complicated one that took a while for the Judeans to think over. There had always been a division between the north and the south and this instance perfectly illustrates that. Following Solomon's death, sectionalism formed and inevitably led to the division of the kingdom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This division lead to the Judeans rejecting the offer made by the Samaritans to centralise worship at the Temple.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The text is not clear on this matter, but one possibility is that these "people of the land" were thought of as Samaritans. We do know that Samaritan and Jewish alienation increased and that the Samaritans eventually built their own temple on Mount Gerizim, near [[Shechem]].

The rebuilding of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem took several decades. The project was first led by [[Zerubbabel#Sheshbazzar|Sheshbazzar]] (ca.&amp;nbsp;538 BCE), later by Zerubbabel and [[Joshua the High Priest|Jeshua]], and later still by [[Haggai]] and [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]] (520–515 BCE). The work was completed in 515 BCE.

The term "Kuthim" applied by Jews to the Samaritans had clear [[pejorative]] connotations, implying that they were interlopers brought in from [[Kutha]] in Mesopotamia and rejecting their claim of descent from the ancient Tribes of Israel.

According to many scholars, archaeological excavations at Mount Gerizim indicate that a Samaritan temple was built there in the first half of the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=6NsxZRnxE70C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=Lipschits+Yehud#v=onepage&amp;q=Lipschits%20Yehud&amp;f=false |first=Yitzhak |last=Magen |chapter=The Dating of the First Phase of the Samaritan Temple on Mount Gerizim in the Light of the Archaeological Evidence |editor1=Oded Lipschitz|editor2=Gary N.

===Hellenic era===
====Antiochus IV Epiphanes and Hellenization====
[[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] was on the throne of the [[Seleucid Empire]] from 175 to 163 BCE. His policy was to [[Hellenization|Hellenize]] his entire kingdom and standardize religious observance. According to 1 Maccabees 1:41-50 he proclaimed himself the incarnation of the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] god [[Zeus]] and mandated death to anyone who refused to worship him. In the 2nd century BCE, a series of events led to a revolution by a faction Judeans against Antiochus IV.

The universal peril led the Samaritans, eager for safety, to repudiate all connection and kinship with the Jews. The request was granted. This was put forth as the final breach between the two groups, being alleged at a much later date in the Christian Bible (John 4:9), "For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|John|4:9;27|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;—or not "alleged" if the Greek sunchrasthai merely refers to not sharing utensils (NABRE).

Anderson notes that during the reign of Antiochus IV (175–164 BCE):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christiancourier.com/articles/282-jesus-and-the-samaritan-woman |title=Jesus and the Samaritan Woman / A Samaritan Woman Approaches:1 |publisher=Christiancourier.com |accessdate=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|sign=|source=Bromiley, 4.304|the Samaritan temple was renamed either Zeus Hellenios (willingly by the Samaritans according to Josephus) or, more likely, Zeus Xenios, (unwillingly in accord with 2 Macc. 6:2).}}

Josephus Book 12, Chapter 5 quotes the Samaritans as saying:
{{quote|sign=|source=Josephus|We therefore beseech thee, our benefactor and saviour, to give order to Apolonius, the governor of this part of the country, and to Nicanor, the procurator of thy affairs, to give us no disturbances, nor to lay to our charge what the Jews are accused for, since we are aliens from their nation and from their customs, but let our temple which at present hath no name at all, be named the Temple of Jupiter Hellenius.}}

{{quote|sign=|source=II Maccabees 6:1–2|Shortly afterwards, the Greek king sent Gerontes the Athenian to force the Jews of Israel to violate their ancestral customs and live no longer by the laws of God; and to profane the Temple in Jerusalem and dedicate it to Olympian Zeus, and the one on [[Mount Gerizim]] to Zeus, Patron of Strangers, as the inhabitants of the latter place had requested.}}

====Hasmonean influence====
During the [[Hellenistic period]], Samaria was largely divided between a Hellenizing faction based in Samaria (Sebastaea) and a pious faction, led by the High Priest and based largely around Shekhem and the rural areas. Samaria was a largely autonomous state nominally dependent on the [[Seleucid Empire]] until around 113 BCE, when the Jewish [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean ruler]] John Hyrcanus destroyed the Samaritan temple and devastated Samaria.

The Hellinized Samaritan Temple at Mount Gerizim was destroyed by [[John Hyrcanus]] in 113 BC, having existed about 200 years. Only a few stone remnants of it exist today.&lt;ref&gt;See: Jonathan Bourgel, "The Destruction of the Samaritan Temple by John Hyrcanus: A Reconsideration", ''JBL'' 135/3 (2016), pp. 505-523; [https://www.academia.edu/34049422/The_Destruction_of_the_Samaritan_Temple_by_John_Hyrcanus_A_Reconsideration]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman period===
====Early Roman era====
[[File:Gerizim2.jpg|left|thumb|Samaritan worship centre on Mount Gerizim. From a photo c. 1900 by the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]].]]

Under the [[Roman Empire]], Samaria became a part of the [[Herodian Kingdom]], [[Herodian Tetrarchy]] and with deposition of the Herodian [[ethnarch]] Herod Achelaus in early 1st century CE, Samaria became a part of the province of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judaea]].

Samaritans appear briefly in the Christian gospels, most notably in the account of the [[Samaritan woman at the well]] and the [[parable of the Good Samaritan]]. In the latter, it is only the Samaritan who helped the man stripped of clothing, beaten, and left on the road half dead, his Abrahamic covenantal circumcision implicitly evident. The priest and Levite walked past. But the Samaritan helped the naked man regardless of his nakedness (itself religiously offensive to the priest and Levite&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Topical Bible: Nakedness |url=http://biblehub.com/topical/n/nakedness.htm |publisher=Bible Hub |access-date=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), his self-evident poverty, or to which Hebrew sect he belonged (which was unclear to any, due to his nakedness).

The Temple of Gerizim was rebuilt after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] against the Romans, around 136 CE. A building dated to the second century BCE, the [[Delos Synagogue]], is commonly identified as a Samaritan synagogue, which would make it the oldest known Jewish or Samaritan synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=L. Michael White |title=The Delos Synagogue Revisited Recent Fieldwork in the Graeco-Roman Diaspora |journal=Harvard Theological Review |volume=80 |issue=2 |year=1987 |pages=133–160 |doi=10.1017/s0017816000023579}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Matassa argues that, although there is evidence of Samaritans on Delos, there is no evidence the building was a synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lidia Matassa |title=Unravelling the Myth of the Synagogue on Delos |journal=Bulletin of the Anglo-Israel Archaeological Society |year=2007 |volume=25 |pages=81–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Samaritan liturgy was set by the high priest [[Baba Rabba]] in the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;See: Jonathan Bourgel, "The Samaritans in the Eyes of the Romans: The Discovery of an Identity", ''Cathedra'' 144 (2012), 7–20 (in Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

There were some Samaritans in the [[Sasanian Empire]], where they served in the army.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

====Byzantine times====
{{further|Samaritan Revolts}}
This period is considered as something of a golden age for the Samaritan community, the population thought to number up to a million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Greg Johnston |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/israel-and-the-palestinian-territories |title=Israel &amp; the Palestinian Territories Travel Information and Travel Guide |publisher=Lonely Planet |accessdate=2011-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Samaritan sources, [[List of Byzantine emperors|Eastern Roman emperor]] [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] (who ruled 474–491 and whom the sources call "Zait the King of Edom") persecuted the Samaritans. The Emperor went to Neapolis ([[Shechem]]), gathered the elders and asked them to convert; when they refused, Zeno had many Samaritans killed, and re-built the synagogue as a church. Zeno then took for himself [[Mount Gerizim]], where the Samaritans worshiped God, and built several edifices, among whom a tomb for his recently deceased son, on which he put a cross, so that the Samaritans, worshiping God, would prostrate in front of the tomb. Later, in 484, the Samaritans revolted. The rebels attacked Sichem, burned five churches built on Samaritan holy places and cut the finger of bishop Terebinthus, who was officiating the ceremony of [[Pentecost]]. They elected a [[Justa (rebel)|Justa]] (or Justasa/Justasus) as their king and moved to [[Caesarea]], where a noteworthy Samaritan community lived. Here several Christians were killed and the church of St. Sebastian was destroyed. Justa celebrated the victory with games in the circus. According to [[John Malalas]], the ''dux Palaestinae'' Asclepiades, whose troops were reinforced by the Caesarea-based Arcadiani of Rheges, defeated Justa, killed him and sent his head to Zeno.&lt;ref&gt;Malalas, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Procopius]], Terebinthus went to Zeno to ask for revenge; the Emperor personally went to Samaria to quell the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius, ''Buildings'', 5.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern historians believe that the order of the facts preserved by Samaritan sources should be inverted, as the persecution of Zeno was a consequence of the rebellion rather than its cause, and should have happened after 484, around 489. Zeno rebuilt the church of St. Procopius in Neapolis (Sichem) and the Samaritans were banned from Mount Gerizim, on whose top a signalling tower was built to alert in case of civil unrest.&lt;ref&gt;Alan David Crown, ''The Samaritans'', Mohr Siebeck, 1989, {{ISBN|3-16-145237-2}}, pp. 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under a [[charismatic authority|charismatic]], [[Messiah#Messianic figure|messianic figure]] named [[Julianus ben Sabar]] (or ben Sahir), the Samaritans launched a war to create their own independent state in 529. With the help of the [[Ghassanids]], Emperor [[Justinian I]] crushed the revolt; tens of thousands of Samaritans died or were [[slavery|enslaved]]. The Samaritan faith, which had previously enjoyed the status of ''[[religio licita]]'', was virtually outlawed thereafter by the Christian [[Byzantine Empire]]; from a population once at least in the hundreds of thousands, the Samaritan community dwindled to tens of thousands.

Though initially guaranteed religious freedom after the Muslim conquest of Palestine, Samaritan numbers dropped further as a result of massacres and conversions.&lt;ref&gt;Pummer 1987 p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the [[early Muslim conquests]], apart from [[Jund Filastin|Palestine]], small dispersed communities of Samaritans were living also in [[History of Muslim Egypt|Arab Egypt]], [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], and [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Iran]]. Like other non-Muslims in the empire, such as Jews, Samaritans were often considered to be [[People of the Book]]. Their minority status was protected by the Muslim rulers, and they had the right to practice their religion, but, as [[dhimmi]], adult males had to pay the [[jizya]] or "protection tax". This however changed during late Abbasid period, with increasing persecution targeting the Samaritan community and considering them infidels which must convert to Islam. The tradition of men wearing a red [[tarboosh]] may go back to an order by the [[Abbasid]] Caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]] (847-861 CE) that required non-Muslims to be distinguished from Muslims.&lt;ref name ="Pummer"&gt;Reinhard Pummer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VOLOfJ6PgAMC&amp;pg=PA17 ''The Samaritans,''] BRILL, 1987 p.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Crusades]], Samaritans, like the non-Latin Christian inhabitants of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], were second-class citizens, but they were tolerated and perhaps favored because they were docile and had been mentioned positively in the Christian New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Z. Kedar, "The Frankish period", in ''The Samaritans'', ed. Alan D. Cross (Tübingen, 1989), pp. 86-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman rule===
While the majority of the Samaritan population in [[Damascus]] was massacred or converted during the reign of the Ottoman Pasha Mardam Beq in the early 17th century, the remainder of the Samaritan community there, in particular, the Danafi family, which is still influential today, moved back to Nablus in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Monika Schreiber, 
https://books.google.com/books?id=4We7AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46 ''The Comfort of Kin: Samaritan Community, Kinship, and Marriage,'' BRILL, 2014 p.46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nablus community endured because most of the surviving diaspora returned, and they have maintained a tiny presence there to this day. In 1624, the last [[Samaritan High Priest]] of the line of [[Eleazar]] son of [[Aaron]] died without issue, but according to Samaritan tradition, descendants of Aaron's other son, [[Ithamar]], remained and took over the office.&lt;ref name=Ireton/&gt;

By the late Ottoman period, the Samaritan community dwindled to its lowest. In 19th century, with pressure of conversion and persecution from the local rulers and occasional natural disasters, the community fell to just over 100 persons.

===British Mandate===
The situation of the Samaritan community improved significantly during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. At that time, they began to work in the public sector, like many other groups. The censuses of [[1922 census of Palestine|1922]] and [[1931 census of Palestine|1931]] recorded 163 and 182 Samaritans in Palestine, respectively.&lt;ref name=Census1931v1&gt;{{cite book |author=E. Mills |title=Census of Palestine 1931. Volume I. |place=Alexandria |year=1933 |publisher=Government of Palestine |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of them lived in Nablus.&lt;ref name=Census1931v1/&gt;

===Israeli, Jordanian and Palestinian rule===
After the end of the British Mandate of Palestine and the subsequent establishment of the State of Israel, some of the Samaritans who were living in [[Jaffa]] emigrated to Samaria and lived in Nablus. By the late 1950s, around 100 Samaritans left the West Bank for Israel under an agreement with [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|the Jordanian authorities in the West Bank]].&lt;ref name="Yaish"/&gt; In 1954, [[President of Israel|Israeli President]] [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]] fostered a Samaritan enclave in Holon, Israel. 

Until the 1990s, most of the Samaritans resided in the West Bank city of ([[Nablus]]) below [[Mount Gerizim]]. They relocated to the mountain itself near the [[Israel]]i village [[Har Brakha]] as a result of violence during the [[First Intifada]] (1987–1990). Consequently, all that is left of the Samaritan community in Nablus itself is an abandoned synagogue. The [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli army]] maintains a presence in the area.&lt;ref name=CNN14/&gt;

On the last day of the encampment, they begin at dawn a pilgrimage to the crest of the sacred mount. Before setting forth on this pilgrimage, however, the men spread their cloths and repeat the creed and the story of the Creation in silence, after which, in loud voice they read the Book of Genesis and the first quarter of the Book of Exodus, ending with the story of the Passover and the flight from Egypt&lt;br /&gt;— John D. Whiting&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''The National Geographic Magazine'', Jan 1920]]

==Genetic studies==

===Demographic investigation===
Demographic investigations of the Samaritan community were carried out in the 1960s. Detailed pedigrees of the last 13 generations show that the Samaritans comprise four lineages:
* The Tsedakah lineage, claiming descent from the tribe of Manasseh
* The Joshua-Marhiv lineage, claiming descent from the tribe of Ephraim
* The Danafi lineage, claiming descent from the tribe of Ephraim
* The priestly [[Kohen|Cohen]] lineage from the tribe of Levi.

===Y-DNA and mtDNA comparisons===
Recently several genetic studies on the Samaritan population were made using haplogroup comparisons as well as wide-genome genetic studies. Of the 12 Samaritan males used in the analysis, 10 (83%) had Y chromosomes belonging to [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|haplogroup J]], which includes three of the four Samaritan families. The Joshua-Marhiv family belongs to [[Haplogroup J-M267]] (formerly "J1"), while the Danafi and Tsedakah families belong to [[haplogroup J-M172]] (formerly "J2"), and can be further distinguished by M67, the derived allele of which has been found in the Danafi family. The only Samaritan family not found in [[haplogroup]] [[J]] was the Cohen family (Tradition: Tribe of Levi) which was found [[Haplogroup E-V68|haplogroup E-M78]] (formerly "E3b1a M78").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shen |first=P |author2=Lavi T |author3=Kivisild T |author4=Chou V |author5=Sengun D |author6=Gefel D |author7=Shpirer I |author8=Woolf E|author9=Hillel J|author10=Feldman MW|author11=Oefner PJ |year=2004 |url=http://evolutsioon.ut.ee/publications/Shen2004.pdf |title=Reconstruction of Patrilineages and Matrilineages of Samaritans and Other Israeli Populations From Y-Chromosome and Mitochondrial DNA Sequence Variation |journal=Human Mutation |volume=24 |pages=248–260 |format=PDF |pmid=15300852 |doi=10.1002/humu.20077 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article predated the change of the classification of haplogroup E3b1-M78 to E3b1a-M78 and the further subdivision of E3b1a-M78 into 6 subclades based on the research of Cruciani, et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/humu.9445 |last=Cruciani |first=F. |author2=La Fratta, R. |author3=Torroni, A. |author4=Underhill, P.

The 2004 article on the genetic ancestry of the Samaritans by Shen ''et al.'' concluded from a sample comparing Samaritans to several Jewish populations, all currently living in Israel—representing the [[Beta Israel]], [[Ashkenazi Jews]], [[Iraqi Jews]], [[Libyan Jews]], [[Moroccan Jews]], and [[Yemenite Jews]], as well as Israeli [[Druze]] and [[Palestinians]]—that "the principal components analysis suggested a common ancestry of Samaritan and Jewish patrilineages. Most of the former may be traced back to a common ancestor in what is today identified as the paternally inherited Israelite high priesthood (Cohanim) with a common ancestor projected to the time of the Assyrian conquest of the kingdom of Israel."&lt;ref name="evolutsioon.ut.ee"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://evolutsioon.ut.ee/publications/Shen2004.pdf |title=Reconstruction of Patrilineages and Matrilineages of Samaritans and Other Israeli Populations From Y-Chromosome and Mitochondrial DNA Sequence Variation }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(855&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, Hum Mutat 24:248–260, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists Aharoni, et al., estimated that this "exile of peoples to and from Israel under the Assyrians" took place during ca. 734–712 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Yohanan Aharoni, Michael Avi-Yonah, Anson F. Rainey, [[Ze'ev Safrai]], ''The Macmillan Bible Atlas'', 3rd Edition, Macmillan Publishing: New York, 1993, p. 115. A posthumous publication of the work of Israeli archaeologist Yohanan Aharoni and Michael Avi-Yonah, in collaboration with Anson F. Rainey and [[Ze'ev Safrai]].&lt;/ref&gt; The authors speculated that when the Assyrians conquered the Northern Kingdom of Israel, resulting in the exile of many of the Israelites, a subgroup of the Israelites that remained in the Land of Israel "married Assyrian and female exiles relocated from other conquered lands, which was a typical Assyrian policy to obliterate national identities."&lt;ref name="evolutsioon.ut.ee"/&gt; The study goes on to say that "Such a scenario could explain why Samaritan Y chromosome lineages cluster tightly with Jewish Y lineages, while their mitochondrial lineages are closest to Iraqi Jewish and Israeli Arab mtDNA sequences." Non-Jewish Iraqis were not sampled in this study; however, mitochondrial lineages of Jewish communities tend to correlate with their non-Jewish host populations, unlike paternal lineages which almost always correspond to Israelite lineages.

==Demographics==
[[File:Shomroni tora2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A Samaritan and the Samaritan Torah]]
{{As of|2017|01|01|df=US}}, there were 796 Samaritans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Samaritan Update|url=http://www.thesamaritanupdate.com/|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; half of whom reside in their modern homes at [[Kiryat Luza]] on [[Mount Gerizim]], which is sacred to them, and the rest in the city of [[Holon]], just outside [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref name="FRIEDMAN-2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN14"/&gt; There are also four Samaritan families residing in [[Binyamina-Giv'at Ada]], [[Matan, Israel|Matan]], and [[Ashdod]].

As a small community physically divided between neighbors in a hostile region, Samaritans have been hesitant to overtly take sides in the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]], fearing that doing so could lead to negative repercussions. While the Samaritan communities in both the West Bank's Nablus and Israeli Holon have assimilated to the surrounding respective cultures, Hebrew has become the primary domestic language for Samaritans. Samaritans who are Israeli citizens are drafted into the military, along with the Jewish citizens of Israel.
[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - Samaritans praying during Passover holiday ceremony on mount Grizim.jpg|thumb|Samaritans celebrating Passover on Mount Grizim in the West Bank]]
Relations of Samaritans with Jewish Israelis and Muslim and Christian Palestinians in neighboring areas have been mixed. Samaritans living in both Israel and in the West Bank enjoy Israeli [[citizenship]]. Samaritans in the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]]-ruled territories are a minority in the midst of a Muslim majority. They had a reserved seat in the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]] in the [[Palestinian general election, 1996|election of 1996]], but they no longer have one. Samaritans living in Samaria have been granted [[passport]]s by both Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

===Community survival===
{{see also|Cousin marriage in the Middle East}}
One of the biggest problems facing the community today is the issue of continuity. With such a small population, divided into only four families ([[Kohen|Cohen]], Tsedakah, Danafi, and Marhiv, a fifth family dying out in the twentieth century) and a general refusal to accept converts, there has been a history of [[genetic disorder]]s within the group due to the small [[gene pool]]. To counter this, the Samaritan community has recently agreed that men from the community marry non-Samaritan (primarily, Israeli Jewish) women, provided that the women agree to follow Samaritan religious practices. There is a six-month trial period before officially joining the Samaritan community to see whether this is a commitment that the woman would like to take. This often poses a problem for the women, who are typically less than eager to adopt the strict interpretation of biblical (Levitical) laws regarding [[menstrual cycle|menstruation]], by which they must live in a separate dwelling during their periods and after [[childbirth]]. There have been a few instances of [[interfaith marriage|intermarriage]]. In addition, all marriages within the Samaritan community are first approved by a [[geneticist]] at [[Sheba Medical Center|Tel HaShomer Hospital]], in order to prevent the spread of genetic disorders. In meetings arranged by "[[mail-order bride|international marriage agencies]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patience|first=Martin|title=Ancient community seeks brides abroad|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6333475.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=6 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; a small number of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] women have recently been allowed to marry into the community in an effort to expand the gene pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/middleeast/2013/01/20131873534572211.html|title=West Bank Samaritans fight extinction|last=Ferguson|first=Jane|date=8 January 2013|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=8 January 2013|location=Mount Gerizin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Samaritan community in Israel also faces demographic challenges as young people leave the community and convert to Judaism. A notable example is Israeli television presenter [[Sofi Tsedaka]], who has made a documentary about her leaving the community at age 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Steinberg| first = Jessica| title = A former Samaritan faces the music of her complicated roots| accessdate = 2018-04-28| url = http://www.timesofisrael.com/a-former-samaritan-faces-the-music-of-her-complicated-roots/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The head of the community is the [[Samaritan High Priest]], who is selected by age from the priestly family and resides on [[Mount Gerizim]]. The current high priest is [[Aabed-El ben Asher ben Matzliach]] who assumed the office in 2013.

===Samaritan origins of Palestinian Muslims in Nablus===
Much of the local [[Palestinians|Palestinian population]] of [[Nablus]] is believed to be descended from Samaritans who had converted to Islam.&lt;ref name=Ireton/&gt; According to the historian Fayyad Altif, large numbers of Samaritans converted due to persecution under various Muslim rulers, and because the monotheistic nature of Islam made it easy for them to accept it.&lt;ref name=Ireton&gt;{{cite web|title=The Samaritans - The Samaritans: Strategies for Survival of an Ethno-religious Minority in the Twenty First Century|author=Sean Ireton|publisher=Anthrobase|year=2003|accessdate=2007-11-29|url=http://www.anthrobase.com/Txt/I/Ireton_S_01.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Samaritans themselves describe the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman period]] as the worst period in their modern history, as many Samaritan families were forced to convert to Islam during that time.&lt;ref name="Yaish"&gt;[http://www.zajel.org/article_view.asp?newsID=4425&amp;cat=18 The Political History of the Samaritans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119035811/http://www.zajel.org/article_view.asp?newsID=4425&amp;cat=18 |date=2012-01-19 }} - zajel / An-Najah National University, January 24, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Even today, certain Nabulsi family names such as Maslamani, Yaish, and Shaksheer among others, are associated with Samaritan ancestry.&lt;ref name=Ireton/&gt;

For the Samaritans in particular, the passing of the [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|al-Hakim]] Edict by the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] in 1021, under which all Jews and Christians in the Fatimid ruled southern [[Levant]] were ordered to either convert to Islam or leave, along with another notable forced conversion to Islam imposed at the hands of the rebel ibn Firāsa,&lt;ref name="autogenerated257"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fattal, A. 1958 p. 72-73"/&gt; would contribute to their rapid unprecedented decrease, and ultimately almost complete extinction as a separate religious community. As a result, they had decreased from nearly a million and a half in late Roman (Byzantine) times to 146 people by the end of the Ottoman Era.

In 1940, the future Israeli president and historian [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]] wrote an article in which he stated that two thirds of the residents of Nablus and the surrounding neighboring villages were of Samaritan origin.&lt;ref name="Zvi"/&gt; He mentioned the name of several Palestinian Muslim families as having Samaritan origins, including the Buwarda and Kasem families, who protected Samaritans from Muslim persecution in the 1850s.&lt;ref name="Zvi"/&gt; He further claimed that these families had written records testifying to their Samaritan ancestry, which were maintained by their priests and elders.&lt;ref name="Zvi"&gt;{{cite book |title=Oral telling of Samaritan traditions: Volume 780-785|last=Ben Zvi|first=Yitzhak |authorlink=Yitzhak Ben Zvi |date=October 8, 1985 |publisher=A.B. Samaritan News |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Economist]]'', "most ethnic Samaritans are now pious Muslims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2016/10/economist-explains-14|title=Who are the Samaritans and why is their future uncertain?|website=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Samaritanism==
{{main|Samaritanism}}
[[File:Samaritan Passover prayer 1920.JPG|thumb|Samaritans pray before the Holy Rock on Mount Gerizim]]

The Samaritan religion is based on some of the same books used as the basis of [[Judaism]] but differs from the latter. Samaritan religious works include the [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritan version of the Torah]], the Memar Markah, the Samaritan liturgy, and Samaritan law codes and biblical commentaries. Many{{who|date=April 2017}} claim the Samaritans appear to have a text of the Torah as old as the [[Masoretic Text]]; scholars have various theories concerning the actual relationships between these three texts.

===Samaritan Temple===
According to Samaritans,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grizimtour.com/Tourism.htm {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614010749/http://www.grizimtour.com/Tourism.htm |date=June 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was on [[Mount Gerizim]] that Abraham was commanded by God to offer Isaac, his son, as a sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref|Genesis|22:2|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both narratives, God then causes the sacrifice to be interrupted, explaining that this was the ultimate test of Abraham's obedience, as a result of which all the world would receive blessing.

[[File:Harry Fenn. Ruins on the summit of Mount Gerizim, on the site of the Samaritan temple. 1881-1884.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins on Mount Gerizim c. 1880.]]

The Torah mentions the place where God chooses to establish His name (Deut 12:5), and Judaism takes this to refer to Jerusalem. However, the Samaritan text speaks of the place where God ''has chosen'' to establish His name, and Samaritans identify it as Mount Gerizim, making it the focus of their spiritual values.

The legitimacy of the Samaritan temple was attacked by Jewish scholars including [[Andronicus ben Meshullam]].

In the Christian Bible, the [[Gospel of John]] relates an [[Samaritan woman at the well|encounter]] between a Samaritan woman and [[Jesus]] in which she says that the mountain was the center of their worship. She poses the question to Jesus when she realizes that he is the Messiah. Jesus affirms the Jewish position, saying "You (that is, the Samaritans) worship what you do not know".&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref|John|4:20|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious beliefs===
* There is one [[God]], [[Yahweh|YHWH]], the same God recognized by the [[prophet#The Hebrew and Jewish concepts of prophet|Hebrew prophets]].
* The [[Torah]] was given by God to [[Moses]].
* [[Mount Gerizim]], not Jerusalem, is the one true sanctuary chosen by Israel's God.
* Many Samaritans believe that at the end of days, the dead will be [[resurrection|resurrected]] by the Taheb, a restorer (possibly a prophet, some say Moses).
* Resurrection and Paradise ([[heaven]]).
* The priests are the interpreters of the law and the keepers of tradition; scholars are secondary to the priesthood.
* The authority of post-Torah sections of the Tanakh, and classical Jewish [[Rabbi]]nical works (the [[Talmud]], comprising the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Gemara]]) is rejected.
* They have a [[Ten Commandments#Samaritan|significantly different version]] of the [[Ten Commandments]] (for example, their 10th commandment is about the sanctity of Mount Gerizim).

The Samaritans have retained an offshoot of the [[Samaritan alphabet|Ancient Hebrew script]], a [[High Priest of Israel|High Priesthood]], the slaughtering and eating of [[Lamb and mutton|lambs]] on [[Passover]] eve, and the celebration of the first month's beginning around springtime as the New Year. Yom Teru`ah (the biblical name for "[[Rosh Hashanah]]"), at the beginning of [[Tishrei]], is not considered a [[New Year]] as it is in Rabbinic Judaism. The [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] differs from the Jewish [[Masoretic Text]] as well. Some differences are doctrinal: for example, the Samaritan Torah explicitly states that Mount Gerizim is "the place that God ''has chosen''" to establish His name, as opposed to the Jewish Torah that refers to "the place that God ''chooses''". Other differences are minor and seem more or less accidental.

===Relationship to Rabbinic Judaism===
[[File:Samaritan doorpost.jpg|thumb|upright|The Samaritan [[mezuzah]] engraved above the front door]]

Samaritans refer to themselves as ''Benai Yisrael'' ("[[Children of Israel]]") which is a term used by all Jewish denominations as a name for the Jewish people as a whole. They, however, do not refer to themselves as ''Yehudim'' (Jews), the standard Hebrew name for Jews.

The Talmudic attitude expressed in [[Minor tractate|tractate Kutim]] is that they are to be treated as Jews in matters where their practice coincides with Rabbinic Judaism but as non-Jews where their practice differs. Some claim that since the 19th century, Rabbinic Judaism has regarded the Samaritans as a Jewish sect and the term "Samaritan Jews" has been used for them.&lt;ref&gt;Shulamit Sela, ''The Head of the Rabbanite, Karaite and Samaritan Jews: On the History of a Title'', Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 57, No. 2 (1994), pp. 255-267&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious texts===
Samaritan law is not the same as [[Halakha]] (Rabbinic Jewish law). The Samaritans have several groups of religious texts, which correspond to Jewish Halakha. A few examples of such texts are:

* '''[[Torah]]'''
** ''[[Samaritan Pentateuch]]'': There are some 6,000 differences between the Samaritan Pentateuch and the Masoretic Jewish Pentateuch text; and, according to one estimate, 1,900 points of agreement between it and the Greek LXX version. Several passages in the [[New Testament]] would also appear to echo a Torah textual tradition not dissimilar to that conserved in the Samaritan text. There are several theories regarding the similarities. The variations, some corroborated by readings in the Old Latin, Syriac and Ethiopian translations, attest to the antiquity of the Samaritan text.&lt;ref&gt;James VanderKam, Peter Flint, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SBMXnB4CRpUC&amp;pg=PA95 ''The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls: Their Significance For Understanding the Bible, Judaism, Jesus, and Christianity,''] A&amp;C Black, 2nd ed. 2005 p.95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Michael Law, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YZoeAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24 ''When God Spoke Greek: The Septuagint and the Making of the Christian Bible,''] Oxford University Press, USA, 2013 p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isac Leo Seeligmann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BHYnIhREtzgC&amp;pg=PA64 ''The Septuagint Version of Isaiah and Cognate Studies,''] Mohr Siebeck 2004 pp.64ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian sources: New Testament==
Samaria or Samaritans are mentioned in the [[New Testament]] books of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], [[Gospel of John|John]] and [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]]. The [[Gospel of Mark]] contains no mention of Samaritans or Samaria. The best known reference to the Samaritans is the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]], found in the Gospel of Luke. The following references are found:
* When instructing his disciples as to how they should spread the word, Jesus tells them not to visit any Gentile or Samaritan city, but instead, go to the "lost sheep of Israel".&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|10:5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A Samaritan village rejected a request from messengers travelling ahead of Jesus for hospitality, because the villagers did not want to facilitate a pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem]], a practice which they saw as a violation of the [[Torah|Law of Moses]] {{citation needed|reason=What Law? Most sources I read claim it was due to bad blood between Samaritans and Jews|date=November 2015}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Luke|9:51–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Luke|10:30–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jesus]] healed ten [[leper]]s, of whom only one returned to praise God, and he was a Samaritan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Luke|17:11–19, esp. 17:16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jesus asks [[Samaritan woman at the well|a Samaritan woman]] of [[Shechem|Sychar]] for water from [[Jacob's Well]], and after spending two days telling her townsfolk "all things" as the woman expected [[the Messiah]] to do, and presumably repeating the [[Good News (Christianity)|Good News]] that he is the Messiah, many Samaritans [[John 4#Evangelisation of the Samaritans|become followers of Jesus]]. He accepts without comment the woman's assertion that she and her people are Israelites, descendants of Jacob.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John| 4:4-42}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jesus is accused of being a Samaritan and being demon-possessed. He denies the latter accusation, but does not deny the former that seems to be meant to accuse him of not having Jewish beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|8:48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Christ tells them that they would receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon them and that they would be his witnesses in "Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Acts|1:8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Apostles are being persecuted. Philip preaches the Gospel to a city in Samaria, and the Apostles in Jerusalem hear about it. So they send the Apostles Peter and John to pray for and lay hands on the baptized believers, who then receive the Holy Spirit (vs. 17). They then return to Jerusalem, preaching the Gospel "in many villages of the Samaritans".&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Acts|8:1–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Acts 9:31 says that at that time the churches had "rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria".
* Acts 15:2–3 says that Paul and Barnabas were "being brought on their way by the church" and that they passed through "Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles". (''Phoenicia'' in several other English versions).

The rest of the New Testament makes no specific mention of Samaria or Samaritans.

''The Samaritan News'', a monthly magazine started in 1969, is written in Samaritan Aramaic, Hebrew, Arabic, and English and deals with current and historical issues with which the Samaritan community is concerned. The ''Samaritan Update'' is a bi-monthly e-newsletter for Samaritan Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesamaritanupdate.com/|title=The Samaritan News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary film was produced in 2018 entitled ''How to Save a Tribe'' presented by traveller/author [[Leon McCarron]]. It focuses on the population crisis among the Samaritans.

{{About|the Latin expression|the hymn|For All the Saints|the band with Robbie Gladwell and Sheri Kershaw|Sheri Kershaw}}

'''''Sine nomine''''' (abbreviated '''s.n.''') is a [[Latin]] expression, meaning "without a name". It is most commonly used in the contexts of publishing and [[Bibliography|bibliographical]] listings such as [[library catalog]]s, to signify that the [[publisher]] (or distributor, etc.) of a listed work is unknown, or not printed or specified on the work. It is to be compared with ''[[sine loco]]'' (''s.l.''), "without a place", used where the place of publication of a work is unknown or unspecified. While it may sometimes be used to disclose unknown authorship, this is more commonly indicated as ''[[anonymity|anon.]]'' or similar.

The phrase and its abbreviation have been deprecated in [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] [[cataloging]] with the adoption of the [[Resource Description and Access]] standard, which instead prescribes the unabbreviated English phrase "publisher not identified" (or "distributor not identified", etc.). ''Sine loco'' is likewise replaced by "place of publication not identified".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.yale.edu/cataloging/music/rdaoverview.htm#abbreviations |title=A brief overview of some of the changes from AACR2 to RDA |date=26 June 2014 |publisher=[[Yale University Library]] |accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Spoonmaker's Diamond''' ({{Lang-tr|Kaşıkçı Elması}}) is an 86 carat (17.2g) pear-shaped diamond in the Imperial Treasury exhibitions at the [[Topkapi Museum|Topkapi Palace]] Museum and its most valuable single exhibit. It is considered the fourth [[list of diamonds|largest diamond]] of its kind in the world.

Set in silver, surrounded by a double row of 49 [[Old-mine cut]] diamonds ([[Brilliant (diamond cut)|brilliants]]), it hangs in a glass case on the wall of the third room in Imperial Treasury section of Topkapı's "[[Topkapı Palace#Conqueror’s Pavilion|Conqueror’s Pavilion]]".

These surrounding separate [[Brilliant (diamond cut)|brilliants]] give it "the appearance of a full moon lighting a bright and shining sky amidst the stars" and are considered to have been commissioned either by [[Ali Pasha of Tepelena|Ali Pasha]] or by Sultan [[Mahmud II]] – though this, as all other details of the diamond's origins, is doubtful and disputed.

==History==
It is not known with any certainty how this diamond came to the Topkapı Palace. The museum's records do list a ring stone called the Spoonmaker's Diamond, which is noted as having already belonged to the 17th century Sultan [[Mehmet IV]].  However, this stone, along with its gold, is only {{convert|10|-|12|g|carat|abbr=on}}, which is much smaller than the present Spoonmaker's Diamond. Several mutually exclusive accounts exist regarding the origin of the Spoonmaker's Diamond. They continue to circulate, having become part of the Turkish popular culture and being repeated by tourist guides, and in printed guide books.

===The Naive Fisherman===
According to one tale, a poor fisherman in [[Istanbul]] near [[Yenikapi]] was wandering idly, empty-handed, along the shore when he found a shiny stone among the litter, which he turned over and over, not knowing what it was. After carrying it about in his pocket for a few days, he stopped by the jewelers' market, showing it to the first jeweler he encountered. The jeweler took a casual glance at the stone and appeared uninterested, saying "It's a piece of glass, take it away if you like, or if you like I'll give you three spoons. You brought it all the way here, at least let it be worth your trouble." What was the poor fisherman to do with this piece of glass? What's more, the jeweler had felt sorry for him and was giving three spoons. He said okay and took the spoons, leaving in their place an enormous treasure. It is said that for this reason the diamond came to be named "The Spoonmaker's Diamond". Later, the diamond was bought by a [[vizier]] on behalf of the Sultan (or, by a less likely version, it was the vizier who dealt directly with the fisherman).

Variant versions, published in some Istanbul Travel guides, describe the original finder as "a farmer who found it on the ground, and who sold it to a dealer" from whom it eventually "came to a Sultan in the 17th century".

According to still other tales, the name is derived from the finder having actually been a spoonmaker, or that the diamond was given this name because it resembled the bowl of a spoon.

===Ali Pasha of Tepelena===
[[File:Ali Pasha and Kira Vassiliki by Paul Emil Jacobs 1802 1866.jpg|right|thumb|Ali Pasha and his favourite wife Kira Vassiliki, by [[Paul Emil Jacobs]].]]

A persistent element in several accounts of the diamond's origin links it with the well-known [[Ali Pasha of Tepelena]], who in the late 18th and early 19th Centuries was the Ottoman governor of much of present-day Albania and Greece, and who set himself up as a virtually independent ruler.

The Spoonmaker's Diamond is asserted to have been in Ali Pasha's possession for a short or long time before arriving at the Ottoman capital. By some versions, it had been at one time worn by [[Kira Vassiliki]], Ali Pasha's favorite wife (or mistress). Its eventual passing into the Sultan's hands might have taken place either during Ali Pasha's lifetime, as part of his complicated dealings with the central Ottoman government, or after his execution, when his possessions were confiscated by the Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;"Topkapi Palace", 2005, {{ISBN|975-285-234-3}}, pages 69–70&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote needed|date=April 2018}}

The following versions, through mutually contradictory, are all compatible with Ali Pasha having had a part in the diamond's history.

===Captain Camus and Napoleon's Mother===
A widespread strand of stories link the origins of the Spoonmaker's Diamond with historic events at the town of [[Preveza]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]]. In 1797 the town was ceded to France and garrisoned by 700 of [[Napoleon I]]'s French [[grenadier]]s under General [[La Salchette]], together with some 200 armed Prevezian Greek citizens and some 60 Albanian [[Souliotes]]. However, in the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] of 12–13 October 1798, this force was overwhelmed by 7000 Turkish-Albanian warriors under Ali Pasha  and his son Muhtar. 
In the aftermath, French and Greeks were massacred in Preveza and at Port Salaora on the [[Ambracian Gulf]]. Many prisoners who survived the massacre died from the hardships on the road to Ali Pasha's capital at [[Ioannina]], where they were paraded in the streets. Nine French officers were sent on to Sultan [[Selim III]] in Istanbul, among them Captain [[Louis-Auguste Camus de Richemont]] and another officer named [[Tissot]]. Camus remained in captivity until 1801, when he was ransomed and returned to a long and distinguished military career, eventually attaining the rank of general. Onto the above historically attested facts was added an unattested story, according to which Captain Camus was the lover of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s mother [[Letizia Ramolino]]. Therefore, after receiving the bad news, Letizia has been in contact with Sultan [[Selim III]], and immediately  sent a "Big Diamond"  by ship to Preveza as a present for the Sultan, with the expectation of her lover's liberation. The diamond went from Preveza to Ioannina (presumably, in Ali Pasha's custody) and then to Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Gouvas: "History of Preveza Prefecture", editions of Museum of Arts and Sciences, Preveza,2009, {{ISBN|978-960-87328-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional detail appearing in some versions is that the diamond had previously belonged to the executed Queen [[Marie Antoinette]].

Finally, Captain Camus and the other French soldiers had been liberated, while the diamond remained in the Topkapi Palace, in possession of Sultan Selim III and his successors.

As noted, there is no clear historical evidence to either a relationship between Captain Camus and Letizia Ramolino or to her having sent the diamond to the Sultan. It is noteworthy that in some versions Captain Camus is mentioned as having been 47 years old at the time, which would make his age compatible with that of Letizia Ramolino (who was 48 then). However, in fact Camus is known to have been only 27 in 1798. It is also to be noted that at the time Letizia was not yet the Emperor's mother, but simply the mother of a rising young general of Revolutionary France – not so likely to have the power and authority attributed to her in the story.

Much later Camus, by then a General, published his memoirs in three volumes. In one passage he does mention that during their year in possession of Preveza, the French soldiers  carrying out fortification work in a place called Mazoma revealed in their excavations the eastern cemetery of Ancient [[Nicopolis]]. There, many treasures came to light (jewelry, lamps, pottery, etc.)  all of which were pillaged by the soldiers. However, Camus makes no reference to a big diamond having been among these ancient treasures. In any case, almost all French soldiers were killed in the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] and its aftermath, their belongings being looted by the victorious Turkish and Albanian troops.&lt;ref&gt;Cadmius: War acts despite Preveza", Athens, Michael Saliveros Publications, 1900&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dimitris Manos: "Ali Pasha Tepelena", Alpha Publications, Athens&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Konstantinos Zachos, archaeologist: Speech in Preveza, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ntaskagiannis: "The destruction of Preveza," History Matters Magazine, April 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry Gouvas: "History of Preveza Prefecture", editions of Museum of Arts and Sciences Harry Gouvas, Preveza,2009, {{ISBN|978-960-87328-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being historically doubtful, the [[romance (heroic literature)|romantic]] story is often repeated of Captain Camus having been the lover of Napoleon's mother and of her having sent the Spoonmaker's Diamond to the Sultan in order to ransom him. The account was, for example, included in a recent documentary of  [[Television in Japan|Japanese State Television]], "Preveza" (2004).&lt;ref&gt;Japanese State Television Documentary 2004, about Preveza&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry Gouvas: "History of Preveza Prefecture", editions of Museum of Arts and Sciences, Preveza,2009, {{ISBN|978-960-87328-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his part, Dr. [[Ilber Ortayli]], Director of the TopKapi Museum, participated at the 2nd International Symposium of History of Preveza held at that city in 2009, though speaking mainly of a later period in Ottoman history rather than of the origins of the Spoonmaker's Diamond.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin Jason: «Lords of the Horizons», Chapter 24, The Auspicious Event, 1998 edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis Claire: «The Palace of Topkapi in Istanbul», Publisher Charles Scribner's Sons, Ney York 1970. pp. 213–217. ASIN B000NP64Z2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Ilber Ortayli's thesis, announced at the Symposium, was entitled "Society and the governor in Preveza during the time of [[Abdulhamid II]]" – Program, Second International Symposium on History of Preveza, Preveza, 16–20 September 2009. The Symposium followed publication of the First Edition of the book "History of Preveza Prefecture"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry Gouvas: "History of Preveza Prefecture", editions of Museum of Arts and Sciences, Preveza,2009, {{ISBN|978-960-87328-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Pigot Diamond===
{{Main|Pigot Diamond}}

It has sometimes been suggested that the gem is one and the same as the [[Pigot Diamond]], which was at one time the largest diamond in England but details about it since it left England in the 1820s are unknown.  There are various legends about the Pigot Diamond, some of which partially overlap legends about the Spoonmaker's Diamond.  Stories about the two diamonds have been related, which is especially convenient since the disposition of the Pigot Diamond and the origin of the Spoonmaker's Diamond are both unresolved.

In any case, the recorded weight of the Pigot Diamond was just {{convert|47.38|carat|g|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;Jack Ogden, 'England's Largest Diamond', ''Gems and Jewellery'' 18,2, 2009, pp. 30 – 33.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is an oval shape, which would exclude the possibility of its being the Spoonmaker's Diamond.

===Which Sultan first got the diamond?===
In 1798, when [[Preveza]] was captured by Ali Pasha, the Ottoman Sultan was [[Selim III]]. Selim III (Ottoman Turkish: سليم ثالث Selīm-i sālis) (24 December 1761 – 28 or 29 July 1808) was the reform-minded Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1789 to 1807. The Janissaries eventually deposed and imprisoned him, and placed his cousin Mustafa on the throne as Mustafa IV. Selim was killed by a group of assassins subsequently after a Janissary revolt. It is logical, that Reticia Ramolino Bonaparte sent the Diamond in year 1798 or 1799. So, the Sultan who took the "Gift" was Selim III. In 1822, when Ali Pasha was killed, the Sultan was [[Mahmud II]] from year 1808. Assuming that the above stories contain at least a nucleus of historical truth, and that Ali Pasha was involved in the diamond arriving at TopKapi, one of these was most likely the first Sultan to possess the diamond – though the actual circumstances of its arrival there might have been far more mundane. In case of one of the "Naive Fisherman" versions being the right one, the diamond might have arrived much earlier, probably in 1800 – 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Gouvas: "History of Preveza Prefecture", editions of Museum of Arts and Sciences, Preveza,2009, {{ISBN|978-960-87328-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Film==

The Spoonmaker's Diamond is the big diamond that is referenced in the film "[[Topkapi (film)|Topkapi]]", shot in [[Kavala]] and [[Istanbul]] in 1965 and starring [[Melina Mercouri]] and [[Peter Ustinov]]. However,  the robbers depicted in the film are mainly oriented at stealing another Topkapi treasure, the emerald-encrusted dagger of the earlier Sultan [[Mahmud I]].

==History==
Stocksy United was founded April 20, 2012 and publicly launched on March 25, 2013.&lt;ref name=CNET /&gt; It was started by [[iStockphoto]] co-founders [[Bruce Livingstone]] and Brianna Wettlaufer.&lt;ref name=TechCrunch&gt;{{cite news|last=TechCrunch|title=iStockphoto Founder Returns To Stock Photography With Stocksy, A Co-op That Puts Artists (And Quality) Before Profits|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/26/istockphoto-founder-returns-to-stock-photography-with-stocksy-a-co-op-that-puts-artists-and-quality-before-profits/|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of launch, Stocksy had about 220 contributing photographers, with plans to grow to approximately 500 photographers in its first year.&lt;ref name=CNET /&gt; Stocksy now has over 900 contributing members, selected from over 10,000 applications. Its revenue doubled from 2014 to 2015, to $7.9 million. For 2015, Stocksy paid out over half of its revenue as royalties to its contributors, totaling $4.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cortese|first1=Amy|title=A New Wrinkle in the Gig Economy: Workers Get Most of the Money|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/21/business/smallbusiness/a-new-wrinkle-in-the-gig-economy-workers-get-most-of-the-money.html|website=New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revenue for 2016 has grown to $10.7 million, with $4.9 million paid out to contributors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cooperativesfirst.com/blog/2017/6/22/elevating-an-industry-the-stocksy-united-story|title=Elevating an industry: the Stocksy United story|work=Co-operatives First|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total for the first four years of business, Stocksy has paid out over $20 million to their nearly 1,000 artists during the period from 2013 to 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thearthunters.com/meet-stocksy-united-photography-cinematography-stock-media-company/|title=Meet Stocksy United, a photography and cinematography stock media company|work=TheArtHunters|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After starting with 6 founding members, Stocksy’s number of staff reached 50 in early 2018.

== Cooperative Structure ==
Stocksy is a platform cooperative with three classes of [[shareholder]]s. Class A is made up of advisors, including CEO Brianna Wettlaufer. Class B is made up of staff, and Class C is the artists who contribute content. Currently there are around 980 photographer shareholders in this category. Each member co-owns the cooperative and has one vote. Each class has at least two directors on the board.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Contributors==
Contributing photographers live in 65 countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After two years of closed membership, Stocksy's Call to Artists is now open.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.frankie.com.au/item/6882-stocksy-united-call-to-artists-is-now-open|title=stocksy united call to artists is now open|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achieving membership into the cooperative is a single step process whereby interested artists submit a portfolio using Stocksy's Call to Artists webpage. Accepted members license creative content and receive 50% royalties on standard license sales, 75% on extended license sales, and year-end profit sharing in the form of patronage returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Digital Photography Review|title=iStockphoto founder launches Stocksy, an artist-owned stock photo service|url=http://www.dpreview.com/news/2013/03/27/iStockphoto-founder-launches-stocksy-artist-owned-stock-photo-service|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stocksy paid its artists patronage in the amount of $200,000 following financial year 2015 and $300,000 after 2016.

[[File:Haafner Verhandelingen.jpg|thumb|Title page of Haafner's award-winning submission on Christian mission, in ''Verhandelingen van Teylers Godgeleerd Genootschap'' (Proceedings of Teylers Theological society) XXII, Haarlem, 1807.]]
'''Teylers Eerste Genootschap''' (English: ''Teyler's First Society''), also known as the '''Godgeleerd Genootschap''' (''Theological Society'') is one of the societies founded within the [[Teylers Stichting]] as a result of the will of the Dutch 18th-century merchant [[Pieter Teyler van der Hulst]].&lt;ref name="MuseumGenootschap1"&gt;[http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/index.php?m=narratio&amp;id=30&amp;nvlng=en Teylers Museum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525173049/http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/index.php?m=narratio |date=2013-05-25 }} on Teylers First Society&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The society was founded in 1778, and the first five members were appointed through Teylers testament: two [[remonstrant]] preachers and three Baptist preachers. As stipulated, there had to be six members, and the sixth member was selected by the first five, and was the baptist [[Frederik Scheltinga]]. The society had also a sister society, [[Teylers Tweede Genootschap]] - which focused on art and science but is organized in a similar way. 

The main activity of the society is to discuss theological issues, and annually announce contests with a relative high prize compared to similar contests by other societies (400 [[Dutch guilder|guilder]]s for the 1778 edition). The prizes were awarded by the members of the society and the directors of the foundation jointly.

==1803 competition: Jacob Haafner==
Because of the different religious backgrounds of the directors compared to the society members, conflicts over the outcome were not unheard of.&lt;ref name="MuseumHaafner"&gt;[http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/index.php?m=narratio&amp;id=10&amp;nvlng=en Teylers Museum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525173049/http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/index.php?m=narratio |date=2013-05-25 }} describing the Jacob Haafner submission of 1803&lt;/ref&gt; This became especially visible in 1803, when [[Jacob Haafner]] submitted an essay on the question "What did the mission bring us so far, and what can be expected" which answered it in a negative sense - much more liberal than the directors would allow, while the jury members were deeply impressed. It took them two years to work out the differences, and the piece would only be published in 1807.

==Essay competitions: procedure==
Especially in the early years, when the questions were less conservatively focused, the amount of replies was high&lt;ref name="MuseumGenootschap1" /&gt; because of the high prize associated with winning it. Until 1796 the answers had to be submitted in [[Latin]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] or [[French language|French]], after 1796 also [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]] were allowed. The name of the submitting author was only available in a sealed envelope, which was linked to the piece and would only be opened in case the piece would win the contest. All other envelopes were burned unopened - and their replies archived anonymously. The winner receives a silver or gold medal or a sum of money and its submission was published in the [[Verhandelingen van Teylers Eerste Genootschap]] (''Proceedings of Teylers First Society''). 

The most recent contest is from 2011, asking for "research on the formation and/or change of the Dutch perception of Islam in the years 1990-2010" which will run through 2014.&lt;ref name="Current"&gt;[http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/index.php?item=18 The current contests of the Teylers Stichting]&lt;/ref&gt; A contest typically runs for three years at a time - hence multiple contest can be active at any given moment. 

The society meets annually in the ''Kleine Herenkamer'' (Small Boardroom) in the [[Teylers Fundatiehuis]] (Teylers Foundation House) next to the [[Teylers Museum]].

==Current members&lt;ref name="Current" /&gt;==
The members of the society are nowadays well known academics in the field of [[Christianity]] working at various universities throughout the [[Netherlands]] - (assistant) professors in different relevant fields such as "history of Christianity" and "the New Testament".

* [[Alle Hoekema]] (assistant professor [[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam]])
* [[Maarten Menken]] (professor [[University of Tilburg]])
* [[Ed Noort]] (honorary professor [[Rijksuniversiteit Groningen]])

'''''The Engineer's and Mechanic's Encyclopaedia''''' is a book edited by [[Luke Hebert]]&lt;!--  NB Hebert is correct, not Herbert --&gt;, a [[Birmingham]] [[patent attorney|patent agent]] and [[journalist]], and published by [[Thomas Kelly (publisher)|Thomas Kelly]] of [[Paternoster Row]].  The first edition appeared in 1836 and 1837. The second edition appeared in 1849.  It was in two octavo volumes (Vol. 1, 796 pp and vol. 2, 928 pp), illustrated with [[woodcut]]s in the text and a number of full page engravings.

Many of the articles relate to specific processes and machines, and overall the encyclopaedia is not over-concerned with the theoretical aspects.  Of particular value are the monograph-length accounts of the progress of [[rail transport]] and [[steamboat]]s.

'''''Meadows of Gold and Mines of Gems''''' (in  {{lang-ar|مروج الذهب ومعادن الجوهر|Muruj adh-dhahab wa ma'adin al-jawahir}}) is an historical account in [[Arabic]] of the beginning of the world starting with [[Adam and Eve]] up to and through the late [[Abbasid Caliphate]] by [[medieval]] Baghdadi historian [[Masudi]] (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] المسعودي).

One English version is the abridged ''The Meadows of Gold: The Abbasids'', translated and edited by [[Paul Lunde]] and Caroline Stone.
An 1841 translation of volume I, by [[Aloys Sprenger]], also exists and is available at Princeton's Firestone Library.

A first version of the book was allegedly completed in the year 947 AD but the author spent most of his life adding and editing the work as well.&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;{{cite news|last=Stone |first=Caroline|title=The Model of the Historians|work=Saudi Aramco World|volume=56|issue=2|date=March–April 2005|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200502/the.model.of.the.historians.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first European version of ''The Meadows of Gold'' was published in both [[French language|French]] and Arabic between 1861 and 1877 by the [[Societe Asiatique]] of Paris by [[Barbier de Meynard]] and [[Pavet de Courteille]].  For over 100 years this version was the standard version used by Western scholars until [[Charles Pellat]] published a French revision between 1966 and 1974.  This revision was published by the Universite Libanaise in [[Beirut]] and consisted of five volumes.&lt;ref name=Masudi17&gt;{{cite book|author=Masudi|title=The Meadows of Gold:  The Abbasids|location=London|publisher=Kegan Paul International|year=1989|page=17}}  Translated and edited by Paul Lunde and Caroline Stone.&lt;/ref&gt;

Versions of the source text by Mas'udi have been published in Arabic for hundreds of years, mainly from presses operating in [[Egypt]] and [[Lebanon]].

One [[English language|English]] version was published in 1989 and was translated and edited by Paul Lunde and Caroline Stone.  According to this edition's introduction, their English translation is heavily edited and contains only a fragment of the original manuscript due to the editors' own personal research interests and focuses almost exclusively on the Abbasid history of Mas'udi.  Their introduction also outlines how the editors relied mainly on the Pellat revision in French and are therefore mainly working from the French translation with the Arabic source text as a background guide.&lt;ref name=Masudi&gt;{{cite book|author=Masudi|title=The Meadows of Gold:  The Abbasids|location=London|publisher=Kegan Paul International|year=1989}}  Translated and edited by Paul Lunde and Caroline Stone.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another English version was published in 1841 by [[Aloys Sprenger]], which includes a full translation of the first volume and extensive footnotes.

Historian [[Hugh N. Kennedy]] calls the book "Probably the best introduction to the Arabic historical tradition for the non-specialist."&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Hugh.  ''When Baghdad Ruled the Muslim World:  The Rise and Fall of Islam's Greatest Dynasty''.  Cambridge:  Da Capo P, 2006. P. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic Historiography==

Written in the "new style" of historical writing of [[al-Dinawari]] and [[al-Ya'qubi]], Meadows of Gold is composed in a format that contains both historically documented [[fact]]s, [[hadith]]s or sayings from reliable sources and stories, [[anecdote]]s, [[poetry]] and [[joke]]s that the author had heard or had read elsewhere.  Due to its reliance on and references to Islam this style of history writing makes up an example of what constitutes [[Historiography of early Islam|Islamic Historiography]] in general.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;

Masudi also contributed an important role in this historicity by adding the importance of eye-witnessing a place or event in order to strengthen its veracity.  Khalidi states that "Mas'udi's own observations form a valuable part of his work."&lt;ref name=Khalidi4&gt;{{cite book|last=Khalidi|first=Tarif|title=Islamic Historiography:  The Histories of Mas'udi|location=Albany|publisher=State U of New York|year=1975|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And that "In contrast to [[Tabari]], who provides little or no information on the lands and peoples of his own day, Mas'udi often corroborated or rejected geographical and other data acquired second-hand."&lt;ref name=Khalidi4/&gt;

In addition the book is unique in medieval Islamic history for its interest in other cultures and religions as scientific and cultural curiosities.  According to Lunde &amp; Stone's introduction, this outlook is a major "characteristic that distinguishes Mas'udi from other Muslim historians."&lt;ref name=Masudi13&gt;{{cite book|author=Masudi|title=The Meadows of Gold:  The Abbasids|location=London|publisher=Kegan Paul International|year=1989|page=13}}  Translated and edited by Paul Lunde and Caroline Stone.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

===Arabic Version===

===Aloys Sprenger===

===Lunde &amp; Stone===

The contents of the Lunde &amp; Stone version are broken into small vignettes which take up less than a full page of text in most cases.  In addition are several pages of poetry.

The Lunde &amp; Stone edition focuses primarily on the Abbasid period in modern-day [[Iraq]] and begins with a story involving the Caliph [[Al-Mansur]] and ends with the reign of [[Al-Muti]] (Abu al-Qasim al-Fadl bin Ja'far al-Muqtadir Muti'li-Llah).

Some notable sections include several stories involving the various Caliphs and their interactions with commoners like "Mahdi and the Bedouin" (37) in which the Caliph is served a humble meal by a passing [[Bedouin]] who in turn is rewarded with a large monetary reward.

A large portion of the English text is dedicated to stories involving the Caliph [[Harun Al-Rashid]] and his [[Barmakid]] advisors.  These stories from Masudi are key elements in several English language historical non-fiction books about Harun Al-Rashid including Hugh Kennedy's ''When Baghdad Ruled the Muslim World'', [[André Clot]]'s ''Harun al-Rashid and the World of The Thousand and One Nights'' and [[H. St. John Philby]]'s ''Harun Al-Rashid''.

Another significant portion of the text involves the [[Fourth Fitna|civil war]] between Caliph [[Al-Amin]] at Baghdad and his half-brother [[al-Ma'mun]], who defeated Amin and became Caliph of the Abbasid Caliphate.  The text spends a considerable amount of pages relaying several lengthy poems about the horrors of civil war that occurred in the city of Baghdad at the time.

==English Version Reception==

While the French version has been a key historical text for over a century, the newer English version has received mixed reviews.

''The British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies''' review suggests that although the English version leaves out several passages of Pellat's edited version the book still retains important historical text and the passages omitted "are digressions from the main story and interrupt its flow."&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth, C. Edmund.  Rev. of The Meadows of Gold:  The Abbasids by Masudi.  Translated and edited by Paul Lunde and Caroline Stone.  British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies, Vol. 18, No. 1. (1991), pp. 139-140.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Journal of the American Oriental Society'', however, takes issue with the fact that the English version relied heavily on the French edited version (and not the entire French or Arabic version) and that the editing of the text cut out parts that were "no less historical import than the ones included."&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, Michael.  Rev. of The Meadows of Gold:  The Abbasids by Masudi.  Translated and edited by Paul Lunde and Caroline Stone.  Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 111, No. 4. (Oct. - Dec., 1991), pp. 786-787.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
This review also is critical of the English version's use of vignette style segments versus the style of Mas'udi whose original work is not cut into small pieces but rather is written in full pages without apparent breaks or chapters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6986">[[File:7842_1948_Pri-Or_Photohouse_crop3.jpg|thumb|David Ben-Gurion at the declaration ceremony, in front of "Tslil" microphones]]
'''The Recording of the Israel Declaration of Independence''' was a complete recording of the declaration using a [[direct to disc recording]] technique on [[acetate discs]] using special cutting machines. Neither the original records nor their duplicates were demanded by Israel state authorities and to date they cannot be located, except for one original acetate disc. However, copies of the recording itself survived on different media.

== The "Tslil" Recording Company ==
[[File:Lucian salzman invitation 13 05 1948.jpg|thumb|The invitation to perform the recording]]
"Tslil - Palestine Electrical Recording Company Ltd." &lt;ref&gt;With the founding of the State of Israel the company changed its name to "Tslil - Israeli Electrical Recording Company Ltd."&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in early 1947 in Tel Aviv and specialized in recording and marketing of commercial records of [[music of Israel]] and [[classical music]]. "Tslil" records were also played by "[[Kol Yerushalayim]]" (The Voice of Jerusalem), the Hebrew station of the Palestine Broadcasting Service of the British Mandate administration.

In April 1948, a few weeks prior to the Declaration of Independence, Lucien Salzman of "Tslil" recorded the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]] playing the "[[Hatikvah]]" national anthem at the "Ohel Shem" hall in Tel Aviv, a recording that was later used for many years by "[[Kol Yisrael]]" (The Voice of Israel), notably as the closing tone of the broadcasts at midnight, as well as by Israel embassies all over the world.

== The Recording of the Ceremony ==
The declaration ceremony was held at the [[Independence Hall (Israel)|Tel Aviv Museum]] on Friday, 14 May 1948 at 16:00 and the recording was performed by Lucien Salzman from "Tslil - Israeli Electrical Recording Company Ltd.". The official invitation to perform the recording was issued by Karel Salmon from Kol Yisrael on behalf of [[Menachem Avidom|Mendel Mahler-Kalkstein]], the Secretary-General of the Palestine Philharmonic Orchestra,&lt;ref&gt;Izi Mann, '''''This is the Voice of Israel Broadcasting from Jerusalem ... /// A Nation Behind the Microphone''''' (Hebrew edition only), Publisher: Printiv Press, Jerusalem, 2008, p. 106-110&lt;/ref&gt; that was invited to play the Hatikvah national anthem by an undersized ensemble of 30 of its players. Presenting a certificate issued by the provisional government, [[provisional government of Israel|Minhelet HaAm]], Lucien Salzman entered the museum building with two assistants, his nephew Giora Hanoch and Fedor Shanon. They installed the two disc cutting machines and the [[amplifiers]] in a small room on the second floor and placed two identical microphones (model Shure 701D) on the presidential table. One of the microphones was wrapped with a white ribbon bearing the Tslil company name in Hebrew (צליל).

The direct to disc recording was made on double-sided 30-cm discs turning at 78 rpm that allowed a recording time of about 3 minutes only. At the end of the recording of a disc on one cutting machine the recording was switched to another disc on the other machine and vice versa. Therefore, the recording of the entire 33-minute ceremony yielded 11 sides on 6 records. The recording ends with the "Hatikvah" national anthem played by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra followed by the concluding statement of David Ben Gurion: "The State of Israel is established! This meeting is adjourned!"

== The Whereabouts of the Records ==
[[File:One of the master records of hakhrazat haatzmaut.JPG|thumb|The only record out of the six "Tslil" master records that survived]]
The "Tslil" recording company handed over to the Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra (IPO) the original records as well as several duplicate sets thereof. The IPO tried to convince the then leading record companies in the United States, Columbia and Victor, in the commercial value of the historic recording, apparently to no avail. After "Tslil" ceased its operation in 1951 Lucien Salzman kept one duplicate set at his home.

Only in 1981, during a research conducted for the [[Pillar of Fire (documentary)|''Pillar of Fire'']] documentary television series, the records reemerged and the recording was transferred to 1/4-inch magnetic tapes at the "Kol Yisrael" studio. Several segments of the recording were used in the last episode of the series. In the late 1980s Lucien Salzman donated the records to the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]] but the whereabouts of these records is still unknown. Only one of the six original records survived and is in the archives of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra (see picture).

== The Recording of the Radio Broadcast ==
In addition to the recording of Lucien Salzman from "Tslil" there is also a recording of the live radio broadcast of the ceremony transmitted by "Kol Yisrael". This recording begins with the words (in Hebrew): "Here is the Voice of Israel! Here is the Voice of Israel!" in the voice of [[Mordechai Avida|Mordechai Zlotnik (later Avida)]] who together with his colleague Rita Persits broadcast the ceremony.
Two double-sided  33⅓ rpm [[LP record]]s with the recording of the radio broadcast are at the [[Israel State Archive]] but their origins or the identity of those who performed the recording are not known. At the Israel State Archive there is also a CD (Compact Disc) with exactly the same recording of the radio broadcast of the ceremony, related to Hans and Ralf Hellinger from the "Radio Doctor" company in Tel Aviv.

A '''tunggal panaluan''' is a magic staff used by [[Shamanism|shamans]] of the [[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak people]], who live in the highlands of [[North Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]]. Traditionally the tunggal panaluan is made from wood of a specific tree and carved with human figures and embellished with horsehair and cooked human brain, both procured from sacrificial victims.

==Shape==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Toverstaf die zowel geluk kan verzekeren rampen kan weren als ziekte dood en verderf kan veroorzaken TMnr 137-575.jpg|thumb|left|The head of the tunggal panaluan.]]
Tunggal panaluan was carved out of the wood of [[Cassia javanica]], the only tree from which the tunggal panaluan can be created.{{sfn|Sibeth|1991|p=133}} The tree occupies a central place in the ancestral myth of the Batak people, as well as the figures depicted on the tunggal panaluan.{{sfn|Sibeth|1991|p=133}} Tunggal panaluan was carved with human and animal figures arranged above each other. The human figure refer to a Batak myth that tells of incestuous twins.{{sfn|Avé|Hitchcock|Jay|2008|p=23}} Animals found depicted in the tunggal panaluan include snakes, dragons, geckos and water buffaloes. Another type of magic staff, known as the tunggal malehat, depicts a human riding either a horse or a mythical beast.{{sfn|Avé|Hitchcock|Jay|2008|p=23}}

==Use==
The tunggal panaluan was used in ceremonies to ward off disaster and illness as well as to cause them. To imbue the staff with magic, first the datu (shaman) has to create a hole in the staff in which a magical substance known as the [[pupuk]] is inserted.{{sfn|Avé|Hitchcock|Jay|2008|p=23}} Pupuk's creation involved the putrefied remain of the mutilated body of a murdered child.{{sfn|Sibeth|1991|pp=136,8}}

==Variation==
Tungkot malehat is another variation of tunggal panaluan. Most tungkot malehat are manufactured and used by the [[Karo people|Karo]] instead of the Toba. They have more simplistic design than the tunggal panaluan. Tunggal panaluan are elaborately carved all the way until the bottom of the staff, whereas the body of the tungkot malehat are left plain and uncarved. The only carved part of the tungkot malehat is its top part, usually carved with a human figure riding a singa or a horse. It is generally accepted that the tungkot malehat is a more recent development of the tunggal panaluan.{{sfn|Sibeth|Carpenter|2007|p=64}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22375">The '''UK Film Council Completion Fund''' is a major UK short film funding awards scheme, funded by the [[UK Film Council]], and managed by Maya Vision International.  Originally a £50,000 fund awarded on an annual basis to a slate of 8-10 film, from 2008 onwards&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;http://www.ukfilmcouncil.org.uk/information/news/?p=D4A15778187d3196DCrRY412E686&amp;skip=&lt;/ref&gt;
the fund has been increased to £70,000 to be awarded on a bi-annual basis to around 14 films of the most promising UK short films "that have already been shot but lack the funds to finish".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ukfilmcouncil.org.uk/filmmaking/shorts/completionfund/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Screenings==

At the scheme's launch in 2002, the 2003 slate of films were co-funded by [[Film4 Productions]]' [[Filmfour Lab]] and screened on [[Channel 4]], [[Film 4]] and a selection are still available on the [[Film 4]] website.  After the winding down of [[Film Four Ltd]] as a separate entity and the scaling down and re-integration of film production into [[Channel 4]] drama in 2002, the [[UK Film Council]] took over sole funding of the completion fund.  Since 2004, the finished films have played at the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]] in a section called [[First Past the Post (Festival Screening)|First Past the Post]] and also have a central London showcase at the [[Curzon Mayfair]].  A selection of the films are available to screen on the [[BBC]] Film Network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/filmnetwork/tags/ukfc-completion-fund BBC Film Network - UKFC Completion Fund shorts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archive==

The UK Film Council takes delivery of a [[Digibeta]] copy of each film for preservation in its national archive in Sheffield and DVD copies are stored by the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]] as part of the [[Film UK Guide to British Film]] archive.

==Awards and nominations==
