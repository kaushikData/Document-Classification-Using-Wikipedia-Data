The '''2015 Sejong and Hwaseong shootings''' were two separate shooting incidents that occurred in [[South Korea]] on 25 and 27 February 2015 in the cities of [[Sejong]] and [[Hwaseong, Gyeonggi|Hwaseong]], respectively. After each shooting, the gunmen committed [[suicide]].

Both incidents led South Korea to immediate adoption of [[GPS]] monitoring of firearms. Since the rarity of shooting incidents in South Korea are evident, they garner international news coverage; the two unrelated [[spree shooting]]s were widely reported as was the adoption of the [[gun control]] measure.

==Shootings==
At 8 a.m. in the morning of 25 February (23:00 [[GMT]] Tuesday), in Sejong, South Korea's administrative capital, a gunman shot and killed three people at a convenience store, then committed [[suicide]] at another location.&lt;ref name=feb25bbc/&gt; The three victims were the gunman's ex-girlfriend's father, brother, and current boyfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tae-hoon|first=Lee|url=http://www.koreaobserver.com/three-koreans-shot-dead-at-convenience-store-in-sejong-26542/|title=Gunman kills ex-girlfriend’s family and boyfriend in Korea|publisher=''The Korean Observer''|date=25 February 2015|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping a gun in the home in South Korea is restricted; the shooter checked out two shotguns from a police precinct two hours before.&lt;ref name=feb25bbc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-31617122 |title=Three killed in South Korea shooting |date=25 February 2015 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 February, another shooting occurred in Hwaseong, [[Gyeonggi]], South Korea, where an elderly man shot and killed three people—his brother, his sister-in-law, and a [[policeman]]—and injured another police officer before committing suicide. He had checked out a hunting rifle at a police station before driving to his brother's house. A niece of the gunman was injured jumping from a second-story window to escape.&lt;ref name=koreaherald&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20150227000323|title=Four killed in Hwaseong shooting|author=The Korea Herald|work=koreaherald.com|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-31654716|title=BBC News - Gunman kills three in South Korea|work=BBC News|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident caused South Korea's [[Yonhap News Agency]] to criticize the nation's gun control regulations for hunting weapons, and led immediately to gun control regulation changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/region/01-Mar-2015/south-korea-to-tighten-gun-control-amid-frequent-shooting-rampages |title=South Korea to Tighten Gun Control Amid Frequent Shooting Rampages |publisher=''[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]'' |date=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 2, the first business day following the Friday incident, South Korea's [[National Emergency Management Agency]], its [[National Police Agency (South Korea)|National Police Agency]], and the ruling [[Liberty Korea Party|Saenuri Party]] agreed to require GPS monitoring of guns in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police to track guns via GPS |publisher=[[The Korea Herald]] |url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20150302000991 |date=March 2, 2015 |author=Kim Yon-se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Academy of the Hebrew Language''' ({{lang-he-n|הָאָקָדֶמְיָה לַלָּשׁוֹן הָעִבְרִית}}, ''ha-akademya la-lashon ha-ivrit'') was established by the [[Israel]]i government in 1953 as the "supreme institution for scholarship on the Hebrew language in the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] of [[Givat Ram]] campus."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lprc.org.il/LPRC/images/PDF/phd_yitzhaki.pdf Minority Languages and Language Policy: The Case of Arabic in Israel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426061017/http://www.lprc.org.il/LPRC/images/PDF/phd_yitzhaki.pdf |date=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an educational institution with the mission of creating new Hebrew words to ensure that the language does not die out.

==History==
[[Image:Academy of the Hebrew Language.JPG|right|thumb|350px|The Academy of the Hebrew Language building at the [[Hebrew University]] - [[Givat Ram]] campus]]
The Academy replaced the Hebrew Language Committee (Vaʻad ha-lashon ha-ʻIvrit) established in 1890 by [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]], who was its first president. As Hebrew became the spoken language in Palestine and was adopted by the [[Education in Israel|educational system]], the Hebrew Language Committee published bulletins and dictionaries. It coined thousands of words that are in everyday use today.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hZqpCrG3qw0C&amp;pg=PA504 The New Jewish Encyclopedia, ed. David Bridger]&lt;/ref&gt;

Its successor, the Academy of the Hebrew Language, has continued this mission of creating new [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] words to keep up modern usage.

Although the academy's business is creating new words from Hebrew roots and structures to replace loanwords derived from other languages, its own name is a loanword, "akademya."&lt;ref name="Hebrew Academy"&gt;[http://en.hebrew-academy.org.il/ Hebrew Academy]&lt;/ref&gt; It addresses this irony on its English website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.hebrew-academy.org.il/birth-of-a-word/when-should-foreign-words-be-replaced-by-hebrew-words/ When Should Foreign Words Be Replaced By Hebrew Words?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy's mission, as defined in its constitution, is "to direct the development of Hebrew in light of its nature" (לכוון את דרכי התפתחותה של הלשון העברית לפי טבעה).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] argues that this is an "oxymoronic" mission impossible: "If the '''nature''' of a language is to evolve in a specific direction, why '''direct''' it by language policing?", see Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (2008), [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Realistic_Prescriptivism_Academy.pdf Realistic Prescriptivism: The Academy of the Hebrew Language, its Campaign of "Good Grammar" and Lexpionage, and the Native Israeli Speakers]. ''Israel Studies in Language and Society'' 1, pp. 135–154.&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy sets standards for modern Hebrew grammar, orthography, transliteration, and punctuation based on the historical development of the language. It also writes a Hebrew Historical Dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;According to Zuckermann, "the Historical Dictionary Project is the Academy's most important contribution", see Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (2008), [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Realistic_Prescriptivism_Academy.pdf Realistic Prescriptivism: The Academy of the Hebrew Language, its Campaign of "Good Grammar" and Lexpionage, and the Native Israeli Speakers]. ''Israel Studies in Language and Society'' 1, pp. 135–154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The plenum consists of 23 members. In addition, the academy employs 15 academic advisors, among them respected scholars of language, linguistics, Judaic studies, and Bible. The Academy’s decisions are binding on all governmental agencies, including the [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]].&lt;ref name="Hebrew Academy"/&gt;

The '''Aliens Control Act No 40 of 1973''' of [[South Africa]] led to the exemption of the racial group of [[Indian South African|Indians]] from the need to obtain permits for travel between provinces. However, in terms of [[Provinces of South Africa|provincial]] legislation at the time, Indians were not allowed to stay in the [[Orange Free State]] and parts of northern [[Natal Province|Natal]] for more than a brief period unless prior permission had been obtained.

==Repeal==
The laws prohibiting Indians from residing in the Orange Free State and northern Natal, from which the [[Alien (law)|Alien]]s Control Act had granted an exemption, were themselves repealed in 1986. The act was repealed by section 60 of the [[Aliens Control Act, 1991]].

The '''Alliance for an Open Europe''' is a [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] and [[free market]] transnational political organisation, that includes representatives from political parties and [[think tank]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beunderman|first1=Mark|title=Free-market eurosceptics join forces|url=https://euobserver.com/political/20480|website=The EU Observer|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Founding ==
It was initiated by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) [[Daniel Hannan]], and its birth came in the midst of renewed questioning of the linkage between the centre-right [[European People's Party]] and the further-right eurosceptic [[European Democrats]] in the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mulvey|first1=Stephen|title=Tory MEPs to fight Cameron plan|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4507516.stm|website=BBC News|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hannan reportedly launched the Alliance with the intention of promoting national sovereignty, free trade and "maximum devolution of power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mulvey|first1=Stephen|title=Tory MEPs to fight Cameron plan|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4507516.stm|website=BBC News|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have suggested that the organisation could become the nucleus of a new [[European political party]] or that its name be adopted by a newly independent ED group.  The Alliance appears to have never received any official sanction from the respective party leadership of its participants, however. In December 2005, future Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, [[David Cameron]] (then new party leader of the [[British Conservatives]] pledged to pull his party out of the European People's party in favor of the Alliance for an Open Europe. This move was criticized by former UK Conservative minister [[Anthony Nelson (politician)|Anthony Nelson]] who argued that the leader of the Tory party "should occupy the centre ground and be inclusive not exclusive." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bounds|first1=Andrew|title=Rightwingers unite in bid to clip Brussels' wings|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b40de86a-66c6-11da-884a-0000779e2340.html#axzz3RMfFvwTV|website=Financial Times|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delegates to its inaugural meeting on 5 December 2005 included representatives from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] Conservatives, the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]], the [[Poland|Polish]] [[Law and Justice]] party and the [[France|French]] [[Rassemblement pour la France|Rally For France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Belien|first1=Paul|title=The Congress of Brussels|url=http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/544|website=The Brussels Journal|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Communist Initiative''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Kommunistische Initiative'') was an [[Anti-revisionist|orthodox]] [[Marxist-Leninist]] organisation in [[Austria]]. It was founded in 2004 as a faction of the [[Communist Party of Austria]] (KPÖ). It left the party in 2005. It was a candidate in the parliamentary elections in 2008 as a part of the alliance [[Left (Austria)|"The Left"]]. At the elections of the [[Austrian Chamber of Labour|Chamber of Labor]] in Vienna, it was a candidate in an alliance with the ATIGF (Austrian section of the [[Communist Party of Turkey/Marxist-Leninist]]) as "KOMintern" and got 0,7% and one seat. In 2013 the Communist Initiative disbanded and the [[Party of Labour of Austria]] was founded.

'''Damir Polančec'''{{Pronunciation needed}} (born 25 June 1967) is a [[Croatia]]n politician. Polančec served as the Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Economy, Labour and Entrepreneurship in the [[Croatian Government]] of [[Ivo Sanader]] and later [[Jadranka Kosor]] between 2003 and 2009.

On 30 October 2009, Polančec resigned citing a need to avoid damaging the Government and the party ([[Croatian Democratic Union]], HDZ) due to accusations leveled at him for his involvement in the mismanagement of [[Podravka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| date = 2009-10-30
| accessdate = 2010-05-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March 2010, Polančec was apprehended by the police and questioned by [[USKOK]], regarding his involvement in certain financial transactions between Podravka, [[MOL Group]] and [[OTP Bank]].
The County Court in Zagreb authorized a longer detention for Polančec and also blocked his estates, at the request of USKOK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October 2010, Polančec was sentenced to 15 months in prison for a separate instance of abuse of power, where he approved a fictional expense to a Vukovar-based attorney in return for his clients dropping lawsuits against the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ft.com/content/1cf0d876-048b-11e0-a99c-00144feabdc0 | title=Former Croatian PM arrested in Austria | work=[[Financial Times]] | date=2010-12-10 | accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://arhiva.nacional.hr/en/clanak/50529/4-steps-to-taking-down-the-hdz | title=4 steps to taking down the HDZ | date=2010-09-21 | magazine=[[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]] | issue=775 | accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2525">The '''Doric Club''' was an association of [[Loyal (Lower Canada)|Loyals]] set up in [[Lower Canada]] by [[Adam Thom]], a lawyer and journalist, in March 1836. A noted opponent of the [[Patriotes]], the group was both a [[social club]] and a [[paramilitary]] organization. It was used as the [[armed faction]] of the Constitutional Party and many of its members took part in the [[Lower Canada Rebellion]]s of 1837 and 1838 on the British side.

== History ==
The members of the Club were mostly young [[English Canadian|anglophone]] radicals who had been forced to leave the [[British Rifle Corps]] after its dissolution by [[Lord Gosford]] in January 1836. Gosford affirmed that British subjects were not in danger, being adequately protected by the army, and that such groupings were useless. Believing them to be about 2,000 in number, he judged them to be troublemakers.

On March 16, 1836, the Club published its manifesto, calling all loyal British men to unite against what it had called the "French domination" in Lower Canada. "If we are deserted by the British government and the British people, rather than submit to the degradation of being subject of a French-Canadian republic, we are determined by our own right arms to work out our deliverance", read the document.

Despite the opposition of Lord Gosford, the Doric Club was tolerated by General [[John Colborne]], as were many other Loyal armed groups. On November 6, 1837, after [[November 6, 1837 assembly of the Fils de la liberté|an assembly]] of the [[Société des fils de la liberté]], a group of young Patriote supporters, a violent skirmish erupted between the latter and the Club. Finally, during the Lower Canada Rebellions, Colborne recruited several of its members as volunteers to quell the rebels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2170">The (Standing Committee) '''Euro Mediterranean Partnership of Local and Regional Authorities''' (COPPEM), was created in 2000 to promote dialogue and development between local and regional authorities in the Euro-Mediterranean area.

It was set up on the initiative of the [[Council of European Municipalities and Regions]]  (CEMR) and the [[Arab Towns Organization]] (ATO).&lt;ref&gt;http://ato.net/&lt;/ref&gt; Its members represent local authorities, provinces and regions in 35 states of the [[Euro-Mediterranean region]]. Membership is not restricted to the Mediterranean Basin and currently includes Danish and Austrian bodies. 

The administrative structure consists of a Bureau, also known as the Presidency Council, and four commissions: 

I. – Political and institutional (chair = [[Ian Micallef]])

II. – Cooperation between cities and regions (chair = Jan Mans)

III. – Economic and financial cooperation (chair = Abdelkarim Mosbah)

IV. – Culture, technology, tourism and environment (chair = Falah Al Omoush and manager Natale Giordano)

The organisation’s headquarters, with a small secretariat, are in [[Palermo]], Italy. The current president, since April 2008, is [[Raffaele Lombardo]], President of the [[Sicily|Sicilian Region]]. He took over from the former President of the Sicilian Region [[Salvatore Cuffaro]]. The founding President was Fabio Pellegrini.

The acronym derives from its Italian title, the ''Comitato Permanente per il Partenariato Euromediterraneo dei Poteri Locali e Regionali''.

COPPEM held its 13th General Assembly in Palermo from 20 to 21 December 2008. It issues a regular newsletter, available as a PDF download from its website, edited by Fabio Pellegrini.

The '''European Charlemagne Youth Prize''', sometimes shortened '''Charlemagne Youth Prize''', is a prize that since 2008 has been annually awarded by the [[European Parliament]] and the foundation of the original [[Charlemagne Prize]] to young people who have contributed towards the process of [[European integration]]. Like the Charlemagne Prize, which has existed since 1949, the youth prize commemorates [[Charlemagne]], ruler of the [[Frankish Empire]] and founder of what became the [[Holy Roman Empire]], who resided and is buried at [[Aachen]] in today's [[Germany]].

The '''European Union National Institutes for Culture''' ('''EUNIC''') is a network of European national institutes of culture and national bodies engaged in cultural and related activities beyond their national borders. EUNIC brings together organisations from all 28 [[EU member states]] and adds value through its global network of clusters. By pooling together the resources and expertise of its members and carrying out joint work on common areas of interest, EUNIC is a recognized partner of the EU and its stakeholders in defining and implementing European policy on culture inside and outside the EU.

The overarching purpose of EUNIC is to create effective partnerships and networks between the participating organisations, to improve and promote cultural diversity and understanding between [[Europe]]an societies, and to strengthen international dialogue and co-operation with countries outside [[Europe]].

Since its establishment in 2006, EUNIC has evolved into a strong network delivering transnational collaborative projects worldwide through its 36 members and 103 clusters. Members consist of national cultural institutions or organizations. Clusters are collaboration platforms established where at least 3 local offices of EUNIC members operate together. Clusters can operate nationwide or citywide. A EUNIC cluster represents the whole of EUNIC and not only those members present in a country/location.

EUNIC is managed by a bi-annual meeting of the Heads of its member organisations. They elect from among themselves a [[President]], a Vice President, and four ordinary members who together represent the EUNIC Board of Directors.

The Presidents are supported by the EUNIC Global office team based in [[Brussels]]. The EUNIC Global Office in [[Brussels]] also supports the work of EUNIC members and clusters around the world.

[[File:The First Night in Exile.jpg|thumb|''The First Night in Exile'' - This painting comes from a celebrated series illustrating one of Hinduism's great epics, the ''[[Ramayana]]''.

To be in '''exile''' means to be away from one's home (i.e. city, state, or country), while either being explicitly refused permission to return or being threatened with imprisonment or death upon return.

In [[Roman law]], ''exsilium'' denoted both voluntary exile and banishment as a [[capital punishment]] alternative to death. [[Deportation]] was forced exile, and entailed the lifelong loss of citizenship and property. [[Relegation]] was a milder form of deportation, which preserved the subject's citizenship and property.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=[[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | entry=BANISHMENT (ROMAN) | title=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]] | edition=3rd | year=1890 | pages=136-137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms [[diaspora]] and [[refugee]] describe group exile, both voluntary and forced, and "[[government in exile]]" describes a government of a country that has relocated and argues its legitimacy from outside that country. Voluntary exile is often depicted as a form of protest by the person who claims it, to avoid persecution and prosecution (such as tax or criminal allegations), an act of shame or repentance, or isolating oneself to be able to devote time to a particular pursuit.

Article 9 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states that "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile."

==For individuals==
=== Exiled heads of state ===
{{main|List of heads of state or government who have been in exile}}
In some cases the [[Deposition (politics)|deposed]] [[head of state]] is allowed to go into exile following a [[coup]] or other change of government, allowing a more peaceful transition to take place or to escape justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Geoghegan |first=Tom |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13052996 |title=BBC News - What happens to deposed leaders? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-04-14 |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Avoiding tax or legal matters ===
{{main|Tax exile|Fugitive}}
A wealthy citizen who moves to a jurisdiction with lower taxes is termed a ''tax exile''. Creative people such as authors and musicians who achieve sudden wealth sometimes choose this solution. Examples include the British-Canadian writer [[Arthur Hailey]], who moved to the Bahamas to avoid taxes following the runaway success of his novels ''Hotel'' and ''Airport'',&lt;ref&gt;Stevie Cameron, ''Blue Trust: The Author, The Lawyer, His Wife, And Her Money,'' 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and the English rock band the [[Rolling Stones]] who, in the spring of 1971, owed more in taxes than they could pay and left Britain before the government could seize their assets. Members of the band all moved to France for a period of time where they recorded music for the album that came to be called ''Exile on Main Street'', the Main Street of the title referring to the French Riviera.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Greenfield, ''Exile on Main Street: A Season in Hell with the Rolling Stones,'' 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Eduardo Saverin]], one of the founders of Facebook, made headlines by renouncing his U.S. citizenship before his company's [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kucera|first=Danielle|title=Facebook Co-Founder Saverin Gives Up U.S. Citizenship Before IPO|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-11/facebook-co-founder-saverin-gives-up-u-s-citizenship-before-ipo.html|publisher=Bloomberg News|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dual Brazilian/U.S. citizen's decision to move to Singapore and renounce his citizenship spurred a bill in the U.S. Senate, the [[Ex-PATRIOT Act]], which would have forced such wealthy ''tax exiles'' to pay a special tax in order to re-enter the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Drawbaugh|first=Kevin|title=Facebook's Saverin fires back at tax-dodge critics|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/17/us-facebook-taxes-idUSBRE84G11A20120517|accessdate=2 November 2012|newspaper=Reuters|date=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases a person voluntarily lives in exile to avoid legal issues, such as [[litigation]] or [[criminal prosecution]]. An example of this is [[Asil Nadir]], who fled to the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] for 17 years rather than face [[prosecution]] in connection with the failed £1.7 bn company [[Polly Peck]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

=== Avoiding violence or persecution, or in the aftermath of war ===
Examples include:
:* [[Iraq]]i academics asked to return home "from exile" to help rebuild Iraq in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronicle.com/article/Iraq-Appeals-Anew-to-Exiled/47791 |title=Iraq Appeals Anew to Exiled Academics to Return Home|first=Andrew |last=Mills |website=[[Reuters]] via chronicle.com |date=2009-06-23|accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* [[Jew]]s who fled persecution from [[Nazi Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/46415/libyan-exile-plan-uks-frozen-assets |title=Libyan exile plan for UK's frozen assets|first=Simon |last=Rocker |website=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] |date=2011-03-10 |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* People undertaking a religious or [[civil liberties]] role in society may be forced into exile due to threat of persecution. For example, [[nun]]s were exiled following the [[Communism|Communist]] [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948|coup d'état of 1948]] in [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-20/news/mn-233_1_bila-voda |title=For Exiled Nuns, It's Too Late : Banished by the Communist regime, Czechoslovakia's sisters of Bila Voda were symbols of persecution. Now most are too old or weak to benefit from the revolution |first=Dan |last=Fisher |website=articles.latimes.com |date=1990-01-20 |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==For groups, nations and governments==
===Comfortable Exile===
{{main|Social alienation|Identity (social science)}}
It is an alternative theory recently developed by a young anthropologist, Balan in 2018. According to him, comfortable exile is a “social exile of people who have been excluded from the mainstream society.  Such people are considered “aliens” or internal “others” on the grounds of their religious, racial, ethnic, linguistic or caste-based identity and therefore they migrate to a comfortable space elsewhere after having risked their lives to restore representation, identity and civil rights in their own country and often capture a comfortable identity to being part of a dominant religion, society or culture.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Balan|first1=Binesh|title=Making of Comfortable Exile through Sanskritization: Reflections on Imagination of Identity Notions in India|journal=Contemporary Voice of Dalit, Sage Pub.|volume=10|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nation in exile===
{{main|Diaspora|Refugee}}
When a large group, or occasionally a whole people or nation is exiled, it can be said that this nation is in exile, or "diaspora". Nations that have been in exile for substantial periods include the [[Jew]]s, who were deported by [[Babylon]]ian king [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] in 586 BC and again following the destruction of the second [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in AD 70. Many Jewish prayers include a yearning to return to Jerusalem and the Jewish homeland.

After the [[partitions of Poland]] in the late 18th century, and following the uprisings (like [[Kościuszko Uprising]], [[November Uprising]] and [[January Uprising]]) against the partitioning powers ([[Russian Empire]], [[Prussia]] and [[Austro-Hungary]]), many Poles have chosen&amp;nbsp;– or been forced&amp;nbsp;– to go into exile, forming large diasporas (known as [[Polish diaspora|Polonia]]), especially in France and the United States. The entire population of [[Crimean Tatars]] (200,000) that remained in their homeland [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] was exiled on 18 May 1944 to Central Asia as a form of [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[collective punishment]] on false accusations. At [[Diego Garcia]], between 1967 and 1973 the British Government forcibly removed some 2,000 [[Chagossians|Chagossian]] resident islanders to make way for a military base today jointly operated by the US and UK.

Since the [[Cuban Revolution]] over one million [[Cubans]] have left [[Cuba]]. Most of these self-identify as exiles as their motivation for leaving the island is political in nature. It is to be noted that at the time of the [[Cuban Revolution]], [[Cuba]] only had a population of 6.5 million, and was not a country that had a history of significant emigration, it being the sixth largest recipient of immigrants in the world as of 1958. Most of the exiles' children also consider themselves to be [[Cuban exile]]s. It is to be noted that under Cuban law, children of Cubans born abroad are considered Cuban citizens.

===Government in exile===
{{main|Government in exile}}
During a foreign [[Military occupation|occupation]] or after a [[coup d'état]], a ''government in exile'' of a such afflicted country may be established abroad.  One of the most well-known instances of this is the [[Polish government-in-exile]], a government in exile that commanded [[Polish contribution to World War II|Polish armed forces]] operating outside Poland after German occupation during World War II. Other examples include the [[Free French Forces]] government of [[Charles De Gaulle]] of the same time, and the [[Central Tibetan Administration]], commonly known as the Tibetan government-in-exile, and headed by the [[14th Dalai Lama]].

== In popular culture ==
===Drama ===
[[File:Jason and Medea - John William Waterhouse.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Jason and Medea]]'', by [[John William Waterhouse]], 1907]]
[[File:Rama vanavas.jpg|thumb|Rama on the way]]

Exile is an early motif in [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[tragedy]]. In the ancient Greek world, this was seen as a fate worse than death. The motif reaches its peak on the play ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'', written by [[Euripides]] in the fifth century BC, and rooted in the very old oral traditions of  Greek mythology. Euripides’ [[Medea]] has remained the most frequently performed Greek tragedy through the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Helene P. Foley: ''Reimagining Greek Tragedy on the American Stage''. University of California Press, 2012, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
[[File:Klaus Mann.jpg|thumb|Exiled [[Klaus Mann]] as Staff Sergeant of the 5th US Army, Italy 1944]]
[[File:Anna Seghers Das siebte Kreuz 1942.jpg|thumb|Cover of [[Anna Seghers]]’ ''[[The Seventh Cross|Das siebte Kreuz]]'']]

After [[Medea]] was abandoned by [[Jason]] and had become a murderer out of revenge, she fled to Athens and married king [[Aigeus]] there, and became the stepmother of the hero [[Theseus]]. Due to a conflict with him, she must leave the [[Polis]] and go away into exile. [[John William Waterhouse]] (1849–1917), the English [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painter’s famous picture ''[[Jason and Medea]]'' shows a key moment before, when Medea tries to poison Theseus.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Elisabeth Prettejohn: ''Art of the Pre-Raphaelites''. Princeton University Press, London 2000, pp. 165-207. {{ISBN|0-691-07057-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===

In ancient Rome, the Roman Senate had the power to declare the exile to individuals, families or even entire regions. One of the Roman victims was the poet [[Ovid]], who lived during the reign of [[Augustus]]. He was forced to leave Rome and move away to the city of Tomis on the Black Sea, now Constanta. There he wrote his famous work ''Tristia'' (Sorrows) about his bitter feelings in exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tristia by Ovid – high drama and hoax|url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/21/tristia-by-ovid-high-drama-and-hoax|website=theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another, at least in a temporary exile, was [[Dante]].

The German language writer of novels, Franz Kafka, called "the Dante of the twentieth century"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted after Harold Bloom: ''Genius. A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Creative Minds''. Warner Books. New York 2002, p. 206. {{ISBN|978-0-446-52717-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the poet [[W. H. Auden]], describes the exile of Karl Rossmann in the posthumously published novel ''Amerika''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. an unabridged reading by [[Sven Regener]]: ''Amerika'', Roof Music, Bochum 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of National Socialism in the first few years after 1933, many Jews, as well as a significant number of German artists and intellectuals fled into exile; for instance, the authors [[Klaus Mann]]  and [[Anna Seghers]]. So Germany’s own exile literature emerged and received worldwide credit.&lt;ref&gt;See Martin Mauthner: ''German Writers in French Exile, 1933–1940'', Vallentine Mitchell, London 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-85303-540-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Klaus Mann finished his novel ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Der Vulkan|de}}'' (''The Volcano. A Novel Among Emigrants'') in 1939&lt;ref&gt;which he started in September 1936, when he came to New York. Cf. Jan Patocka in: ''Escape to Life. German Intellectuals in New York. A Compendium on Exile after 1933'', ed. by Eckart Goebel/Sigrid Weigel. De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston 2012, p 354. {{ISBN|978-3-11-025867-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing the German exile scene, "to bring the rich, scattered and murky experience of exile into epic form",&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Klaus Mann: Der Wendepunkt. Ein Lebensbericht''. (1949), Frankfurt am Main 2006, p. 514.&lt;/ref&gt; as he wrote in his literary balance sheet.  At the same place and in the same year, Anna Seghers published her famous novel ''Das siebte Kreuz'' (''[[The Seventh Cross]]'', published in the United States in 1942).

Important exile literatures in recent years include that of the Caribbean, many of whose artists emigrated to Europe or the United States for political or economic reasons. These writers include Nobel Prize winners [[V. S. Naipaul]] and [[Derek Walcott]] as well as the novelists [[Edwidge Danticat]] and [[Sam Selvon]].&lt;ref&gt; See Timo Müller, “[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14788810.2016.1220790?journalCode=rjas20 Forms of Exile: Experimental Self-Positioning in Postcolonial Caribbean Poetry],” ''Atlantic Studies'' 13.4 (2016): 457-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Free Papua Movement''' ({{lang-id|Organisasi Papua Merdeka – OPM}}) is an umbrella term for the [[Decolonization|independence]] movement established during 1965 in the [[Western New Guinea|West Papuan or West New Guinea]] territory which is currently being administrated by Indonesia as the provinces of [[Papua (province)|Papua]] and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]], also formerly known as Papua, Irian Jaya and West Irian.&lt;ref name="IPAC"&gt;{{cite report|author1=Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict|title=The current status of the Papuan pro-independence movement|date=24 August 2015|location=Jakarta, Indonesia|url=http://file.understandingconflict.org/file/2015/08/IPAC_21_Papuan_Pro-Independence_Movement.pdf|series=IPAC Report No.21|oclc=974913162|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement consists of three elements: a disparate group of armed units each with
limited territorial control with no single commander; several groups in the territory that conduct demonstrations and protests; and a small group of leaders based abroad that raise awareness of issues in the territory whilst striving for international support for independence.&lt;ref name="IPAC" /&gt;

Since its inception the OPM has attempted diplomatic dialogue, conducted [[Morning Star flag]]-raising ceremonies, and undertaken militant actions as part of the [[Papua conflict]]. Supporters routinely display the Morning Star flag and other symbols of Papuan unity, such as the national anthem "[[Hai Tanahku Papua]]" and a [[Coat of arms of Netherlands New Guinea|national coat of arms]], which had been adopted in the period 1961 until Indonesian administration began in May 1963 under the [[New York Agreement]]. The militant movement is considered as a [[separatist]] in Indonesia, and agitating for independence for the provinces has incurred charges of treason.&lt;ref name="Globe09"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/archive/papuans-try-to-keep-cause-alive/305546/|title=Papuans Try to Keep Cause Alive|last=Lintner|first=Bertil|date=22 January 2009|publisher=Jakarta Globe|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801110116/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/archive/papuans-try-to-keep-cause-alive/305546/|archivedate=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:FPM Fredhom Graffiti.jpg|thumb|150px|Free Papua Movement graffiti in Sentani, [[Papua (province)|Papua]]]]
During [[World War II]], the [[Netherlands East Indies]] (later Indonesia) were guided by [[Sukarno]] to supply oil for the [[Pacific War|Japanese war effort]] and subsequently declared independence as the Republic of Indonesia on 17 August 1945. The [[Netherlands New Guinea]] (Western New Guinea) and [[Australia]]n administered territories of [[Papua (Australian territory)|Papua]] and [[British New Guinea]] resisted Japanese control and were allies with the American and Australian forces during the [[Pacific War]].

The pre-war relationship of the Netherlands and [[Netherlands New Guinea]] was replaced with the promotion of Papuan civil and other services&lt;ref name="un1961report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wpik.org/Src/un_report_1961.html |title=Report on Netherlands New Guinea for the year 1961 |publisher=Wpik.org |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; until Indonesian administration began in 1963. Though there was agreement between [[Australia]] and the [[Netherlands]] by 1957 that it would be preferable for their territories to unite for independence, the lack of development in the Australian territories and the interests of the [[United States]] kept the two regions separate. The OPM was founded in December 1963, with the announcement that "We do not want modern life! We refuse any kinds of development: religious groups, aid agencies, and governmental organizations just Leave Us Alone!{{sic}}"&lt;ref name="umd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.start.umd.edu/start/data_collections/tops/terrorist_organization_profile.asp?id=4023|title=Free Papua Movement (OPM)|work=[[Global Terrorism Database]]|publisher=[[University of Maryland, College Park]]|accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Netherlands New Guinea held elections in January 1961 and a [[New Guinea Council]] was inaugurated in April 1961. However, in [[Washington, D.C.]] there was a desire for Indonesia to release CIA pilot [[Allen Lawrence Pope|Allen Pope]],&lt;ref name=RuskMemo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v23/d153 |title=Memorandum From Secretary of State Rusk to President Kennedy |publisher=History.state.gov |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; there was a proposal for United Nations trusteeship of West New Guinea,&lt;ref name=TrusteeshipPlan&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v23/d160 |title=Memorandum From the Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs (Kohler) to Secretary of State Rusk |publisher=History.state.gov |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesian President Sukarno said he was willing 'to borrow the hand of the United Nations to transfer the territory to Indonesia',&lt;ref name=SukarnoKennedy&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v23/d172 |title=Document 172 – Foreign Relations of the United States, 1961–1963, Volume XXIII, Southeast Asia – Historical Documents – Office of the Historian |publisher=History.state.gov |date=1961-04-24 |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[McGeorge Bundy]] began to lobby U.S President [[John F. Kennedy]] to get the administration of West New Guinea transferred to Indonesia.&lt;ref name=DoSsummary&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wpik.org/Src/950306_FRUS_XXIII_1961-63.html#Indonesia |title=U.S. Dept. of State Foreign Relations, 1961–63, Vol XXIII, Southeast Asia |publisher=Wpik.org |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting [[New York Agreement]] was drafted by Robert Kennedy and signed by the Netherlands and Indonesia before being approved subject to the ''Charter of the United Nations'' article 85&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter12.shtml |title=Charter of the United Nations, International Trusteeship System |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=2014-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712173908/http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter12.shtml |archivedate=2014-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''General Assembly resolution 1752''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/17/ares17.htm |title=17th session of the General Assembly |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 21 September 1962.

Although the Netherlands had insisted the West New Guinea people be allowed self-determination in accord with the United Nations charter and General Assembly [[:s:United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1514|Resolution 1514 (XV)]] which was to be called the "Act of Free Choice"; the New York Agreement instead provided a seven year delay and gave the United Nations no authority to supervise the act.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:New York Agreement|Text of New York Agreement]]&lt;/ref&gt; Separatist groups raise the West Papua Morning Star flag each year on 1 December, which they call "Papuan independence day". An Indonesian police officer speculated that people doing this could be charged with the crime of treason, which carries the penalty of imprisonment for seven to twenty years in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/papua0207/ |title=Protest and Punishment Political Prisoners in Papua Report by Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=2007-02-21 |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1968, [[Nicolaas Jouwe]], member of the New Guinea Council and of the [[National Committee for West Papua|National Committee]] elected by the Council in 1962, lobbied the United Nations claiming 30,000 Indonesian troops and thousands of Indonesian civil servants were repressing the Papuan population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wpik.org/Src/NYT/19681020lobbyist.pdf |format=PDF |title=New York Times, Papuans at U.N. score Indonesia, Lobbyists asking nations to insure fair plebiscite}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to US Ambassador [[Francis Joseph Galbraith|Galbraith]], the Indonesian Foreign Minister [[Adam Malik]] also believed the Indonesian military was the cause of problems in the territory and the number of troops should be reduced by at least one half. Ambassador Galbraith further described the OPM to "represent an amorphous mass of anti-Indonesia sentiment" and that "possibly 85 to 90 percent [of Papuans], are in sympathy with the Free Papua cause or at least intensely dislike Indonesians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB128/index.htm |title=National Security Archive at George Washington University, Document 8 |publisher=Gwu.edu |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indonesian Brigadier General [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo|Sarwo Edhie]] oversaw the design and conduct of the [[Act of Free Choice]] which took place from 14 July to 2 August 1969. The United Nations representative Ambassador Oritiz Sanz arrived on 22 August 1968 and made repeated requests for Indonesia to allow a [[one man, one vote]] system (a process known as a referendum or plebiscite) but these requests were refused on the grounds that such activity was not specified nor requested by the 1962 New York Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wpik.org/Src/NYT/19690707.pdf |format=PDF |title=New York Times interview July 5, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wpik.org/Src/NYT/19690511reject.pdf |format=PDF |title=Interview May 10, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; One thousand and twenty five Papuan elders were selected from and instructed on the required procedure as specified by the article 1962 New York Agreement. The result was a consensus for integration into Indonesia.

=== Republic of West Papua Declaration ===

In response, [[Oom Nicolas Jouwe]] and two OPM commanders, Seth Jafeth Roemkorem and [[Jacob Prai|Jacob Hendrik Prai]], planned to announce Papuan Independence in 1971. On 1 July 1971 Roemkorem and Prai declared a "[[Republic of West Papua]]", and drafted a constitution.

Conflicts over strategy between Roemkorem and Prai soon initiated a split of the OPM into two factions; the PEMKA led by Prai, and TPN led by Roemkorem. This greatly weakened OPM's ability as a centralized combat force. It remains widely used, however, invoked by both contemporary fighters and domestic and expatriate political activists.

Starting from 1976, officials at mining company [[Freeport-McMoRan|Freeport Indonesia]] received letters from the OPM threatening the company and demanding assistance in a planned uprising in the spring. The company refused to cooperate with OPM. From July until 7 September 1977, OPM insurgents carried out their threats against Freeport and cut [[slurry]] and fuel [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], slashed telephone and power cables, burned down a warehouse, and detonated explosives at various facilities. Freeport estimated the damage at $US123,871.23.&lt;ref name="Bishop"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Foreign Investment Disputes: Cases, Materials, and Commentary|author=Bishop, R. Doak |author2=Crawford, James |author3=William Michael Reisman|publisher=[[Wolters Kluwer]]|year=2005|pages=609–611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 a OPM Revolutionary Council (OPMRC) was established, and under the chairmanship of Moses Werror the OPMRC has sought independence through a campaign of international diplomacy. OPMRC aims to obtain international recognition for West Papuan independence through international forums such as the United Nations, The [[Non-Aligned Movement]] of Nations, The [[South Pacific Forum]] and The [[Association of South East Asian Nations]].

In 1984 OPM staged an attack on [[Jayapura]], the provincial capital and a city dominated by non-Melanesian Indonesians. The attack was quickly repelled by the Indonesian military, who followed it with broader counter-insurgency activity. This triggered an exodus of Papuan [[refugee]]s, apparently supported by the OPM, into camps across the border in [[Papua New Guinea]].

On 14 February 1986, Freeport Indonesia received information that the OPM was again becoming active in their area, and that some of Freeport's employees were OPM members or sympathisers. On 18 February, a letter signed by a "Rebel General" warned that "On Wed. 19th, there will be some rain on [[Tembagapura]]". At around 22:00 that night several unidentified people cut Freeport's slurry and fuel pipelines by hacksaw, causing "a substantial loss of slurry, containing copper, silver and gold ores and diesel fuel." Additionally, the saboteurs set fire along the breaks in the fuel line, and shot at police that tried to approach the fires. On 14 April of that same year, OPM insurgents cut more pipelines, slashed electric wires, vandalised plumbing, and burned equipment tyres. Repair crews were attacked by OPM gunfire as they approached the sites of the damage, so Freeport requested police and military assistance.&lt;ref name="Bishop"/&gt;

In separate incidents in January and August 1996, OPM captured European and Indonesian hostages; first from a research group and later from a logging camp. Two hostages from the former group were killed and the rest were released.

In July 1998 the OPM raised their independence flag at the Kota Biak water tower on the island of [[Biak]]. They stayed there for the following few days before the Indonesian Military broke up the group. [[Filep Karma]] was among those arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chauvel|first1=Richard|title=Filep Karma and the fight for Papua’s future|url=http://insidestory.org.au/filep-karma-and-the-fight-for-papuas-future/|accessdate=3 October 2017|work=Inside Story|date=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October 2011, Adj. Comr. Dominggus Oktavianus Awes, the Mulia Police chief, was shot by unknown assailants at Mulia Airport in Puncak Jaya regency. The National Police of Indonesia alleged that the perpetrators were members of the Free Papua Movement (OPM) separatist group. The series of attacks prompted deployments of more personnel to Papua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saragih|first1=Bagus BT Saragih|last2=Dharma Somba|first2=Nethy|title=Police hunt for OPM rebels|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/10/25/police-hunt-opm-rebels.html|accessdate=3 October 2017|work=The Jakarta Post|date=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 January 2012, armed men, believed to be members of OPM, shot and killed a civilian who was running a roadside kiosk. He was a trans migrant from West Sumatra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Antara News article|url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/79364/opm-gunmen-kill-civilian-in-kurilik-papua|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 January 2012, OPM conducted an attack on a public bus which caused the death of three civilians and one member of an Indonesian security force. Four others were also injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Berita article|url=http://berita.liputan6.com/read/346831/anggota-tni-tewas-dalam-serangan-opm|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January 2012, an OPM member was caught carrying {{convert|1|kg|lb}} of drugs on the Indonesian – Papua New Guinea Border. It was alleged that the drugs were intended to be sold in the city of Jayapura.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Suararpembaruan article|url=http://www.suarapembaruan.com/home/anggota-opm-tertangkap-bawa-ganja-sekilo-di-perbatasan/16696|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 April 2012, Indonesian media sources alleged that armed members of OPM carried out an attack on a civilian aircraft flown by Trigana Air on a scheduled service after it landed and was taxiing towards an apron at Mulia Airport on Puncak Jaya, Papua. Five armed OPM militants suddenly opened fire on the moving plane, causing it to go out of control and crash into a building. One person who died, Leiron Kogoya, a journalist for Papua Pos, had suffered a neck gunshot wound. Amongst those wounded were the pilot, Beby Astek, and co-pilot, Willy Resubun, both wounded by shrapnel; Yanti Korwa, a housewife who was hurt by shrapnel on her right arm, and her four-year-old infant, Pako Korwa, who was afflicted by shrapnel on his left hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Viva News article|url=http://us.nasional.vivanews.com/news/read/302631-ditembaki-opm--pesawat-trigana-tabrak-rumah|language=Indonesian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411004451/http://us.nasional.vivanews.com/news/read/302631-ditembaki-opm--pesawat-trigana-tabrak-rumah|archivedate=2012-04-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the allegations, West Papuan media sources denied that the OPM was responsible for the attack, alleging that the Indonesian military had attacked the plane as a part of a [[false flag]] operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://westpapuamedia.info/2012/04/09/doubts-grow-of-opm-responsibility-for-puncak-jaya-aircraft-shooting/|title=Doubts grow of OPM responsibility for Puncak Jaya aircraft shooting|first=|last=westpapuamedia|date=9 April 2012|publisher=|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisational hierarchy and governing authority==
The internal organisation of OPM is difficult to determine. In 1996 OPM's 'Supreme Commander' was [[Mathias Wenda]].&lt;ref name="ii1996"&gt;{{cite journal|author=van Klinken, Gerry |title=OPM information |journal=Inside Indonesia |year=1996 |volume=02 |url=http://www.insideindonesia.org/digest/dig02.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708033307/http://www.insideindonesia.org/digest/dig02.htm |archivedate=July 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An OPM spokesperson in Sydney, [[John Ondawame|John Otto Ondawame]], says it has nine more or less independent commands.&lt;ref name="ii1996" /&gt; Australian freelance journalist, Ben Bohane, says it has seven independent commands.&lt;ref name="ii1996" /&gt; Tentara Nasional Indonesia (TNI), Indonesia's army, says the OPM has two main wings, the 'Victoria Headquarters' and 'Defenders of Truth'. The former is small, and was led by M L Prawar until he was shot dead in 1991. The latter is much larger and operates all over West Papua.&lt;ref name="ii1996" /&gt;

The larger organisation, or 'Defender of the Truth' or Pembela Kebenaran (henceforth PEMKA), was chaired by Jacob Prai, and Seth Roemkorem was the leader of Victoria Faction. During the killing of Prawar, Roemkorem was his commander.

Prior to this separation, TPN/OPM was one, under the leadership of Seth Roemkorem as the Commander of OPM, then the President of West Papua Provisional Government, while Jacob Prai as the Head of Senate. OPM reached its peak in organisation and management as it was structurally well organised. During this time, the [[Senegal]] Government recognised the presence of OPM and allowed OPM to open its embassy in Dakhar, with Tanggahma as the ambassador.

Due to the rivalry, Roemkorem left his base and went to the Netherlands. During this time, Prai took over the leadership. John Otto Ondawame, who had left his law school in Jayapura because of being followed and threatened with death by the Indonesian ABRI day and night, became the right-hand man of Jacob Prai. It was Prai's initiative to establish OPM Regional Commanders. He appointed nine of them, most of whom were members of his own troops at the PEMKA headquarter, Skotiau, Vanimo-West Papua border.

Of those regional commanders, Mathias Wenda was the commander for region II (Jayapura – Wamena), [[Kelly Kwalik]] for Nemangkawi (Fakfak regency), Tadeus Yogi (Paniai Regency), and Bernardus Mawen for Maroke region. These commanders have been active ever since, with the exception of Kelly Kwalik who was shot and killed on 16 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8415484.stm Indonesia police 'kill' Papua separatist Kelly Kwalik] BBC News, 16 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, an OPM command group led by General Goliath Tabuni (Puncak Jaya Regency) was featured on an undercover report about the West Papuan independence movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7942026.stm | work=BBC News | title=Papua's struggle for independence | date=2009-03-13 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5195">The '''generalized other''' is a concept introduced by [[George Herbert Mead]] into the [[social sciences]], and used especially in the field of [[symbolic interactionism]]. It is the general notion that a person has of the common expectations that others have about actions and thoughts within a particular society, and thus serves to clarify their relation to the other as a representative member of a shared social system.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (London 1972) p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

Any time that an actor tries to imagine what is expected of them, they are taking on the perspective of the generalized other.

==Precursors==

Mead's concept of the generalised other has been linked to [[Adam Smith]]'s notion of the impartial spectator&lt;ref&gt;Lars Udehn, ''Methodological Individualism'' (2001) p. 367n&lt;/ref&gt; – itself rooted in the earlier thinking of [[Joseph Addison|Addison]] and [[Epictectus]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Phillipson, ''Adam Smith: An Enlightened Life'' (2011) p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Smith wrote: "We Conceive ourselves as acting in the presence of a person quite candid and equitable, of one who...is meerly a man in general, an impartial Spectator who considers our conduct with the same indifference with which we regard that of other people".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Phillipson, p. 164-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role-play and games==

Mead began by contrasting the experience of role-play and pretence in early childhood, in which one role simply gives way to a different one without any continuity, with that of the organised game: "in the latter", he stated, "the child must have the attitude of all the others involved in that game".&lt;ref&gt;George H. Mead, ''Mind, Self, and Society'' (Chicago 1962) p. 159 and p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the organised game as vital for the formation of a mature sense of self, which can only be achieved by learning to respond to, and take on board, the others' attitudes toward the (changing)  common undertakings they are involved in: i.e. the generalized other.&lt;ref&gt;Mead, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

Mead argued that "in the game we get an organized other, a generalized other, which is found in the nature of the child itself....in the case of such a social group as a ball team, the team is the generalized other in so far as it enters – as an organized process or social activity – into the experience of any one of the individual members of it".&lt;ref&gt;Mead, p. 160 and p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

By seeing things from an anonymous perspective, that of the other, the child may eventually be able to visualize the intentions and expectations of others, and see him/herself from the point of view of groups of others – the viewpoint of the generalized other.

The attitude of the generalized other is the attitude of the larger community. According to Mead, the generalized other is the vehicle by which we are linked to society.

==Multiple generalized others==

Arguably,  a modern differentiated society contains as many generalized others as there are social groupings:&lt;ref&gt;F. C. da Silva, ''G. H. Mead'' (2007) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; as Mead put it, "every individual member of any given human society, of course, belongs to a large number of such different functional groups".&lt;ref&gt;Mead, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that everybody will articulate aspects of the range of socio-cultural values in their own way, taking on the perspectives of a set of generalized others in a unique synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;da Silva, p. 50-1&lt;/ref&gt;

With rising levels of socialisation and [[individuation]], more and more people, and more and more aspects of the self come into play in the dialectic of self and generalized other.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Voelz, ''Transcendental Resistance'' (2010) p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalytic equivalents==

As a concept, the generalised other is roughly equivalent to the idea of the Freudian [[superego]]. It has also been compared to [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]'s use of the [[Name of the Father]], as the third party created by the presence of social convention, law, and language in all human interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Crapanzano, ''Hermes' Dilemma and Hamlet's Desire'' (1992) p. 88-9&lt;/ref&gt; It is also similar to Bakhtin's (Superaddressee) "superaddressee" presumed to receive and understand human communication.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5440">== A '''goodwill ambassador''' is a person who advocates for a specific cause (e.g. a country or an organisation) on the basis of their notability.&lt;ref name="fasulo15"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fasulo|first1=Linda|title=An Insider's Guide to the UN|date=2015|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300210729|page=35|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r2jwBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodwill ambassadors generally deliver goodwill or promote ideals from one entity to another, or to a population. The term should be distinguished from the related concept of a [[brand ambassador]], who plays a role in promoting a company or product through personal interaction.&lt;ref name="conbeh14"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Szmigin|first1=Isabelle|last2=Piacentini|first2=Maria|title=Consumer Behaviour|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199646449|page=292|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6jDcBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA292|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
A goodwill ambassador may be an individual from one country who resides in or travels to another country, in a [[diplomatic mission]] (or international [[friendship]] mission) at a peer to peer level; that is: country to country, state to state, city to city; or, as an intermediary representing the people at the other extreme of an organization.

Goodwill ambassadors have been an official (or unofficial) part of governments and cultures for as long as [[diplomacy]] has existed; to exchange gifts and presents; [[humanitarian]] relief; or development aid, using well-known celebrities, [[scientist]]s, authors, known [[activist]]s, and other [[High society (group)|high society]] figures. Goodwill missions of countries are usually carried out or overseen by the [[head of state]], and do not necessarily involve [[diplomatic credentials]] beyond a letter of presentation (or letter of credence). However, some states, such as [[Haiti]], do issue credentials that include [[diplomatic immunity]] for goodwill ambassadors.&lt;ref name="US Newswire"&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-196654483.html Wyclef Jean, Ban Ki-Moon, Bill Clinton Visit Haiti to Raise Global Awareness and Needs of Devastated Country.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations that employ goodwill ambassadors==
A wide range of organizations employ goodwill ambassadors to promote their programs and reach out to others with programs that are based on good relations, from multinational groups such as the [[United Nations]] and [[United Nations Association]]s, the [[African Union]] and the [[European Union]], through nations and subnational groups (for example the [[United States]] and individual states, for example the role played by [[Tennessee]]'s ambassadors of goodwill and [[Kentucky]]'s [[Kentucky Colonel]]{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}). Goodwill ambassadors are also used by social and fundraising organizations such as [[Rotary International]], the [[Olympic Games]], the [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]], and the organization of goodwill ambassadors, [[Globcal International]]. A wide range of United Nations organizations and other intergovernmental organizations that have an observer status also have goodwill ambassador programs, for example the [[United Nations Development Programme#Goodwill Ambassadors|UN Development Programme]], [[UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador|UNESCO]], [[UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador|UNICEF]] and the [[WHO Goodwill Ambassador|World Health Organization]].

Numerous governmental and nongovernmental organizations employing goodwill ambassadors follow a practice of honoring individuals with goodwill ambassador awards. Awards are given for good relations, fundraising/philanthropic acts, and for recognition in advocacy. For example, comedian [[Trevor Noah]] received a South African Goodwill Ambassador Award in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;Staff. "[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/confidential/tribeca-ball-peter-brant-escape-honor-guard-article-1.2186967 South Africa Prizes Noah]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4736">A '''government-organized non-governmental organization''' ('''GONGO''') is a [[non-governmental organization]] that was set up or sponsored by a government in order to further its political interests and mimic the civic groups and civil society at home, or promote its international or geopolitical interests abroad.

==History==
The term GONGO had become established by the late 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;Brown LD, Korten D. 1989. The role of voluntary organizations in development. IDR Work. Pap. No. 8. Boston: Inst. Dev. Res./Boston Univ. Sch. Manage.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was suggested that it was first introduced by a group of Indonesian [[non-governmental organization]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Radhamany Sooryamoorthy, K. D. Gangrade, ''Ngos in India: A Cross-Sectional Study'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001, {{ISBN|0313319545}}, {{ISBN|9780313319549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
A government-organized non-governmental organization (GONGO) can be created for any sound political or social purpose, however, in reality, it would be functioning as a mechanism of the government to further its domestic political interests and realize its economic and foreign policy objectives. Sometimes, GONGOs are created to solicit international aid, or mitigate specific humanitarian issues.&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Steinberg. Background Paper on GONGOs and QUANGOs and Wild NGOs. ''[[World Federalist Movement]] Institute of Global Policy,'' 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Though not necessarily confined to developing countries, most often, GONGOs are set up by undemocratic governments to maintain some level of control of a GONGO's personnel, purpose, operation or activities.&lt;ref name=Moises/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.

{{Healthcare reform in the United States}}
'''Healthcare reform in the United States''' has a long [[History of health care reform in the United States|history]]. Reforms have often been proposed but have rarely been accomplished. In 2010, landmark reform was passed through two [[United States federal law|federal statutes]] enacted in 2010: the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA), signed March 23, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Stolberg, Sheryl Gay |author2=Pear, Robert |date=March 24, 2010 |title=Obama signs health care overhaul bill, with a flourish |newspaper=The New York Times |page=A19 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/health/policy/24health.html |accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Pear, Robert |author2=Herszenhorn, David M. |date=March 22, 2010 |title=Obama hails vote on health care as answering 'the call of history' |newspaper=The New York Times |page=A1 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/22/health/policy/22health.html |accessdate=March 22, 2010 |quote=With the 219-to-212 vote, the House gave final approval to legislation passed by the Senate on Christmas Eve.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]] ({{USBill|111|H.R.|4872}}), which amended the PPACA and became law on March 30, 2010.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Smith, Donna |author2=Alexander, David |author3=Beech, Eric |date=March 19, 2010 |title=Factbox – U.S. healthcare bill would provide immediate benefits |publisher=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1914020220100319 |accessdate=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=March 26, 2010 |title=Timeline: when healthcare reform will affect you |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/03/23/health.care.timeline/index.html |accessdate=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Future reforms of the [[Health care in the United States|American health care system]] continue to be proposed, with notable proposals including a [[single-payer healthcare|single-payer system]] and a reduction in [[fee-for-service]] medical care.&lt;ref name="NYT-20131221"&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosenthal |first=Elisabeth |title=News Analysis – Health Care's Road to Ruin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/sunday-review/health-cares-road-to-ruin.html |date=December 21, 2013 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=December 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PPACA includes a new agency, the [[Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation]], which is intended to research reform ideas through pilot projects.

{{Main article|History of health care reform in the United States}}

Here is a summary of reform achievements at the national level in the United States. For failed efforts, state-based efforts, native tribes services and more details generally, see the main article [[History of health care reform in the United States]].
* '''1965''' President [[Lyndon Johnson]] enacted legislation that introduced [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], covering both hospital (Part A) and supplemental medical (Part B) insurance for senior citizens. The legislation also introduced [[Medicaid]], which permitted the Federal government to partially fund a program for the poor, with the program managed and co-financed by the individual states.&lt;ref name="MedHist"&gt;{{cite web |year=2010 |title=Brief history of the Medicare program |publisher=New Tech Media |location=San Antonio, Tex. |url=http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/2000%20Files/Aug%2000/FTR-08-04-00MedCarHistry.htm |accessdate=August 31, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628194022/http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/2000%20Files/Aug%2000/FTR-08-04-00MedCarHistry.htm |archivedate=June 28, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ball, Robert M. |date=October 24, 1961 |title=The role of social insurance in preventing economic dependency (address at the Second National Conference on the Churches and Social Welfare, Cleveland, Ohio) |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Social Security Administration|U.S. Social Security Administration]] |url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/churches.html |accessdate=August 31, 2010}}
* Robert M. Ball, the then Deputy Director of the Bureau of Old-Age and Survivors Insurance in the Social Security Administration, had defined the major obstacle to financing health insurance for the elderly several years earlier: the high cost of care for the aged and the generally low incomes of retired people. Because retired older people use much more medical care than younger, employed people, an insurance premium related to the risk for older people needed to be high, but if the high premium had to be paid after retirement, when incomes are low, it was an almost impossible burden for the average person. The only feasible approach, he said, was to finance health insurance in the same way as cash benefits for retirement, by contributions paid while at work, when the payments are least burdensome, with the protection furnished in retirement without further payment.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1985''' The [[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985]] (COBRA) amended the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] of 1974 (ERISA) to give some employees the ability to continue [[health insurance]] coverage after leaving employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2010 |title=An employee's guide to health benefits under COBRA – The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Employee Benefits Security Administration]], [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]] |url=http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/cobraemployee.pdf |accessdate=November 8, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227210946/http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/cobraemployee.pdf |archive-date=December 27, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1996''' The [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA) not only protects health insurance coverage for workers and their families when they change or lose their jobs, it also made health insurance companies cover pre-existing conditions.  If such condition had been diagnosed before purchasing insurance, insurance companies are required to cover it after patient has one year of continuous coverage.  If such condition was already covered on their current policy, new insurance policies due to changing jobs, etc... have to cover the condition immediately.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ191/html/PLAW-104publ191.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1997''' The [[Balanced Budget Act of 1997]] introduced two new major Federal healthcare insurance programs, Part C of Medicare and the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]], or SCHIP. Part C formalized longstanding "Managed Medicare" (HMO, etc.) demonstration projects and SCHIP was established to provide health insurance to children in families at or below 200&amp;nbsp;percent of the federal poverty line. Many other "entitlement" changes and additions were made to Parts A and B of fee for service (FFS) Medicare and to Medicaid within an omnibus law that also made changes to the Food Stamp and other Federal programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2007 |title=What is SCHIP? |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[National Center for Public Policy Research]] |url=http://www.schip-info.org/42.html |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2000''' The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA) effectively reversed some of the cuts to the three named programs in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 because of Congressional concern that providers would stop providing services.
* '''2003''' The [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]] (also known as the Medicare Modernization Act or MMA) introduced supplementary optional coverage within Medicare for self-administered prescription drugs and as the name suggests also changed the other three existing Parts of Medicare law.
* '''2010''' The [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], called PPACA or ACA but also known as Obamacare, was enacted, providing for the phased introduction over multiple years of a comprehensive system of mandated health insurance reforms designed to eliminate "some of the worst practices of the insurance companies"—pre-existing condition screening and premium loadings, policy cancellations on technicalities when illness seems imminent, annual and lifetime coverage caps. It also sets a minimum ratio of direct health care spending to premium income, and creates price competition bolstered by the creation of three standard insurance coverage levels to enable like-for-like comparisons by consumers, and a web-based [[health insurance exchange]] where consumers can compare prices and purchase plans. The system preserves private insurance and private health care providers and provides subsidies in the form of income tax reductions to enable lower income Americans to buy insurance. PPACA also made many changes to the 1997, 2000 and 2003 laws that had previously changed Medicare and further expanded eligibility for Medicaid (that expansion was later ruled by the Supreme Court to be at the discretion of the states)
* '''2015''' The [[Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015|Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act]] (MACRA) made significant changes to the process by which many Medicare Part B services are reimbursed and also extended SCHIP
* '''2017''' [[Donald Trump]] is sworn in as President, signs [[Executive Order 13765]] in anticipation of a repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, one of his campaign promises. The [[American Health Care Act of 2017|American Health Care Act]] is introduced and passed in the House of Representatives and introduced but not voted upon in the Senate. President Donald Trump signs [[Executive Order 13813]] which allows insurance companies to sell low-cost short-term plans with lesser coverage, enables small business to collectively purchase association health plans, and expands health savings accounts.

[[Health care compared#International comparisons|International comparisons of healthcare]] have found that the United States spends more per-capita than other similarly developed nations but falls below similar countries in various health metrics, suggesting inefficiency and waste. In addition, the United States has significant [[underinsurance (healthcare)|underinsurance]] and significant impending unfunded liabilities from its aging demographic and its [[social insurance]] programs [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] (Medicaid provides free long-term care to the elderly poor). The fiscal and human impact of these issues have motivated reform proposals.

U.S. healthcare costs were approximately $3.2 trillion or nearly $10,000 per person on average in 2015. Major categories of expense include hospital care (32%), physician and clinical services (20%), and prescription drugs (10%).&lt;ref name="CDC_NCHS1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/health-expenditures.htm|title=FastStats|date=July 18, 2017|website=www.cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. costs in 2016 were substantially higher than other OECD countries, at 17.2% GDP versus 12.4% GDP for the next most expensive country (Switzerland).&lt;ref name="OECD_HS1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/health-data.htm|title=OECD Health Statistics 2017 - OECD|website=www.oecd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; For scale, a 5% GDP difference represents about $1 trillion or $3,000 per person. Some of the many reasons cited for the cost differential with other countries include: Higher administrative costs of a private system with multiple payment processes; higher costs for the same products and services; more expensive volume/mix of services with higher usage of more expensive specialists; aggressive treatment of very sick elderly versus palliative care; less use of government intervention in pricing; and higher income levels driving greater demand for healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/why-does-health-care-cost-so-much-in-america-ask-harvards-david-cutler/|title=Why does health care cost so much in America?

There is ongoing debate whether the current law (ACA/Obamacare) and the Republican alternatives (AHCA and BCRA) do enough to address the cost challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2017/6/30/15894832/senate-bill-health-prices|title=The Senate bill does nothing to fix America's biggest health care problem|website=vox.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 2009 World Bank statistics, the U.S. had the highest [[health care prices in the United States|health care costs]] relative to the size of the economy (GDP) in the world, even though estimated 50 million citizens (approximately 16% of the September 2011 estimated population of 312 million) lacked insurance.&lt;ref name="WHO 2009"&gt;{{cite web |author=WHO |date=May 2009 |title=World Health Statistics 2009 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |url=http://www.who.int/whosis/whostat/2009/en/index.html |accessdate=August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, billionaire [[Warren Buffett]] commented that the high costs paid by U.S. companies for their employees' health care put them at a competitive disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Funk | first = Josh | title = Buffett says economy recovering but at slow rate | newspaper = San Francisco Chronicle | publisher = SFGate.com | date = March 1, 2010 | url = http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-03-01/business/18371919_1_berkshire-hathaway-billionaire-warren-buffett-health-care | accessdate = April 3, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100306012352/http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-03-01/business/18371919_1_berkshire-hathaway-billionaire-warren-buffett-health-care | archivedate = March 6, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, an estimated 77 million [[Baby Boomers]] are reaching retirement age, which combined with significant annual increases in healthcare costs per person will place enormous budgetary strain on U.S. state and federal governments, particularly through [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] spending (Medicaid provides long-term care for the elderly poor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/media/globalexecutive/coming_gen_storm_e_02.pdf |title=coming_gen_storm_e.indd |format=PDF |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining the long-term fiscal health of the U.S. federal government is significantly dependent on healthcare costs being controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charlierose.com/download/transcript/10697 |title=Charlie Rose-Peter Orszag Interview Transcript |date=November 3, 2009 |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111174416/http://www.charlierose.com/download/transcript/10697 |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insurance cost and availability===
{{further|Health insurance coverage in the United States}}
In addition, the number of employers who offer health insurance has declined and costs for employer-paid health insurance are rising: from 2001 to 2007, premiums for family coverage increased 78%, while wages rose 19% and prices rose 17%, according to the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Kaiser 2007"&gt;{{cite press release |title=Health Insurance Premiums Rise 6.1% In 2007, Less Rapidly Than In Recent Years But Still Faster Than Wages And Inflation |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |date=September 11, 2007 |url=http://www.kff.org/insurance/ehbs091107nr.cfm |accessdate=September 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329111855/http://www.kff.org/insurance/ehbs091107nr.cfm |archivedate=March 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even for those who are employed, the private insurance in the US varies greatly in its coverage; one study by the [[Commonwealth Fund]] published in [[Health Affairs]] estimated that 16 million U.S. adults were underinsured in 2003. The underinsured were significantly more likely than those with adequate insurance to forgo health care, report financial stress because of medical bills, and experience coverage gaps for such items as prescription drugs. The study found that underinsurance disproportionately affects those with lower incomes—73% of the underinsured in the study population had annual incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cathy Schoen |author2=Michelle M. Doty |author3=Sara R. Collins |author4=Alyssa L.

There are health losses from insufficient health insurance. A 2009 Harvard study published in the American Journal of Public Health found more than 44,800 excess deaths annually in the United States due to Americans lacking health insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pnhp.org/excessdeaths/health-insurance-and-mortality-in-US-adults.pdf|title=American Journal of Public Health &amp;#124; December 2009, Vol 99, No. 12|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pnhp.org/excessdeaths/excess-deaths-state-by-state.pdf|title=State-by-state breakout of excess deaths from lack of insurance|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, estimates of the total number of people in the United States, whether insured or uninsured, who die because of lack of medical care were estimated in a 1997 analysis to be nearly 100,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;A 1997 study carried out by Professors David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler (''New England Journal of Medicine'' 336, no. 11 1997) "concluded that almost 100,000 people died in the United States each year because of lack of needed care—three times the number of people who died of AIDs."

Retrieved September 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  A study of the effects of the Massachusetts universal health care law (which took effect in 2006) found a 3% drop in mortality among people 20–64 years old—1 death per 830 people with insurance.

The cost of insurance has been a primary motivation in the reform of the US healthcare system, and many different explanations have been proposed in the reasons for high insurance costs and how to remedy them. One critique and motivation for healthcare reform has been the development of the [[medical–industrial complex]]. This relates to moral arguments for health care reform, framing healthcare as a social good, one that is fundamentally immoral to deny to people based on economic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt7zswmt.7|title=Health Care as a Social Good|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Georgetown University Press|isbn=9781626160774|editor-last=CRAIG|editor-first=DAVID M.|series=Religious Values and American Democracy|pages=85–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motivation behind healthcare reform in response to the medical-industrial complex also stems from issues of social inequity, promotion of medicine over preventative care.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt183p79j|title=To Live and Die in America: Class, Power, Health and Healthcare|last=Chernomas|first=Robert|last2=Hudson|first2=Ian|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Pluto Books|isbn=9780745332123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medical-industrial complex, defined as a network of health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and the like, plays a role in the complexity of the US insurance market and a fine line between government and industry within it.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=10.7591/j.ctt1h4mjdm.6|title=Third Wave Capitalism|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=9781501702310|editor-last=Ehrenreich|editor-first=John|series=How Money, Power, and the Pursuit of Self-Interest Have Imperiled the American Dream|pages=39–77|doi=10.7591/j.ctt1h4mjdm.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, critiques of insurance markets being conducted under a capitalistic, free-market model also include that medical solutions, as opposed to preventative healthcare measures, are promoted to maintain this medical-industrial complex.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Arguments for a market-based approach to health insurance include the Grossman model, which is based on an ideal competitive model, but others have critiqued this, arguing that fundamentally, this means that people in higher socioeconomic levels will receive a better quality of healthcare.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

;Uninsured rate

Another concern is the rate of uninsured people in the US. In June 2014, [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]–Healthways Well–Being conducted a survey and found that the uninsured rate is going down. 13 percent of U.S. adults are uninsured in 2014. This is a decrease from the percentage at 17 percent in January 2014 and translates to roughly 10 million to 11 million individuals who gained coverage. The survey also looked at the major demographic groups and found each is making progress towards getting health insurance. However, Hispanics, who have the highest uninsured rate of any racial or ethnic group, are lagging in their progress. Under the new health care reform, Latinos were expected to be major beneficiaries of the new health care law. Gallup found that the biggest drop in the uninsured rate (3 percentage points) was among households making less than $36,000 a year.&lt;ref name="ALONSO-ZALDIVAR :survey"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_HEALTH_OVERHAUL_UNINSURED?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2014-03-10-03-31-55|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310195507/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_HEALTH_OVERHAUL_UNINSURED?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2014-03-10-03-31-55|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 10, 2014|title=Survey: Uninsured Rate Drops; Health Law Cited|last=Alonso-Zaldivar|first=Ricardo|date=March 10, 2014|newspaper=The Associated Press|accessdate=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Easly-ACA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politicususa.com/2014/03/10/republicans-darkest-fears-realized-obamacare-number-uninsured-drop-age-group.html|title=Republicans Darkest Fears Realized: ACA Causes Number of Uninsured to Drop Across All Ages|last=Easley|first=Jason|date=March 10, 2014|newspaper=Politicus USA|accessdate=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howell-uninsured"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/10/rate-uninsured-americans-dropping-gallup/|title=Rate of uninsured Americans is dropping: Gallup|last=Howell|first=Tom|date=March 10, 2014|newspaper=Washington Times|accessdate=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waste and fraud===
In December 2011 the outgoing Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, [[Donald Berwick]], asserted that 20% to 30% of health care spending is waste. He listed five causes for the waste: (1) overtreatment of patients, (2) the failure to coordinate care, (3) the administrative complexity of the [[health care system]], (4) burdensome rules and (5) fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Pear | first = Robert | title = Health Official Takes Parting Shot at 'Waste' | newspaper = New York Times | date = December 3, 2011 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/health/policy/parting-shot-at-waste-by-key-obama-health-official.html?_r=1&amp;emc=eta1| accessdate =December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 3–10% of all health care expenditures in the U.S. are fraudulent. In 2011, Medicare and Medicaid made $65 billion in improper payments (including both error and fraud). Government efforts to reduce fraud include $4 billion in fraudulent payments recovered by the Department of Justice and the FBI in 2012, longer jail sentences specified by the Affordable Care Act, and [[Senior Medicare Patrols]]—volunteers trained to identify and report fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bankrate.com/financing/retirement/how-big-is-medicare-fraud/ | title=How big is Medicare fraud? | publisher=Bankrate | work=Retirement Blog | date=February 21, 2013 | accessdate=November 28, 2013 | author=Phipps, Jennie L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Department of Justice and Health and Human Services formed the [[Medicare Fraud Strike Force]] to combat fraud through data analysis and increased community policing. As of May 2013, the Strike Force has charged more than 1,500 people for false billings of more than $5 billion. [[Medicare fraud]] often takes the form of kickbacks and money-laundering. Fraud schemes often take the form of billing for medically unnecessary services or services not rendered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2013/May/13-crm-553.html | title=Medicare Fraud Strike Force Charges 89 Individuals for Approximately $223 Million in False Billing | publisher=U.S. Department of Justice | date=May 14, 2013 | accessdate=November 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality of care===
There is significant debate regarding the quality of the U.S. healthcare system relative to those of other countries. [[Physicians for a National Health Program]], a pro-[[universal health care|universal]] [[single-payer health care|single-payer]] system of [[health care]] advocacy group, has claimed that a free market solution to health care provides a lower quality of care, with higher mortality rates, than publicly funded systems.&lt;ref name="fpb"&gt;[http://www.pnhp.org/single_payer_resources/forprofit_hospitals_cost_more_and_have_higher_death_rates.php For-Profit Hospitals Cost More and Have Higher Death Rates], ''Physicians for a National Health Program''&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of [[health maintenance organizations]] and [[managed care]] have also been criticized by this same group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnhp.org/single_payer_resources/forprofit_hmos_provide_worse_quality_care.php For-Profit HMOs Provide Worse Quality Care], ''Physicians for a National Health Program''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2000 study of the [[World Health Organization]], publicly funded systems of industrial nations spend less on health care, both as a percentage of their GDP and per capita, and enjoy superior population-based health care outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf |title=Prelims i-ixx/E |format=PDF |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, conservative commentator [[David Gratzer]] and the [[Cato Institute]], a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] think tank, have both criticized the WHO's comparison method for being biased; the WHO study marked down countries for having private or fee-paying health treatment and rated countries by comparison to their expected health care performance, rather than objectively comparing quality of care.&lt;ref name="fmc"&gt;[[David Gratzer]], [http://www.freemarketcure.com/whynotgovhc.php Why Is not Government Health Care The Answer?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312071328/http://www.freemarketcure.com/whynotgovhc.php |date=March 12, 2009 }}, ''Free Market Cure'', July 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glen Whitman, [http://www.cato.org/pubs/bp/bp101.pdf "WHO's Fooling Who? The World Health Organization's Problematic Ranking of Health Care Systems"], [[Cato Institute]], February 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Some medical researchers say that patient satisfaction surveys are a poor way to evaluate medical care. Researchers at the [[RAND Corporation]] and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] asked 236 elderly patients in two different managed care plans to rate their care, then examined care in medical records, as reported in [[Annals of Internal Medicine]]. There was no correlation. "Patient ratings of health care are easy to obtain and report, but do not accurately measure the technical quality of medical care," said John T. Chang, [[UCLA]], lead author.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115758434624755703 Capital: In health care, consumer theory falls flat] David Wessel, Wall Street Journal, September 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Rand study finds patients' ratings of their medical care do not reflect the technical quality of their care |publisher=RAND Corporation |date=May 1, 2006 |url=https://www.rand.org/news/press.06/05.01.html |accessdate=August 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Chang JT, Hays RD, Shekelle PG, etal |title=Patients' global ratings of their health care are not associated with the technical quality of their care |journal=Ann.

A 2001 article in the [[public health journal]] ''[[Health Affairs]]'' studied fifty years of American public opinion of various health care plans and concluded that, while there appears to be general support of a "national health care plan," poll respondents "remain satisfied with their current medical arrangements, do not trust the federal government to do what is right, and do not favor a single-payer type of national health plan."&lt;ref name="content.healthaffairs.org"/&gt;  [[Politifact]] rated a statement by [[Michael Moore]] "false" when he stated that "[t]he majority actually want single-payer health care."  According to Politifact, responses on these polls largely depend on the wording. For example, people respond more favorably when they are asked if they want a system "like Medicare".&lt;ref name="politifact1"/&gt;

==Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act==
{{Main article|Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010}}

After campaigning on the promise of health care reform, President [[Barack Obama]] gave a speech in March 2010 at a rally in Pennsylvania explaining the necessity of health insurance reform and calling on Congress to hold a final up or down vote on reform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/fighting-for-health-insurance-reform President's speech prior to passage of the legislation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312080210/http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/fighting-for-health-insurance-reform |date=March 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of his efforts was the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]. Because Obama's party did not have a [[filibuster]]-proof majority in the Senate, the law was amended by the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]] using the [[Reconciliation (United States Congress)|reconciliation process]] in which debate in the Senate is limited and the filibuster is therefore not permitted.

The legislation remains controversial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/features/us/jan-june10/healthcare_03-23.html|title=NewsHour Extra: Democrats Push Through Historic, Controversial Health Care Legislation - March 23, 2010 - PBS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website=pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/one-year-later-health-care-reform-still-controversial/Content?oid=2146332 One Year Later, Health-Care Reform Still Controversial | Some lawmakers still pushing to nullify federal policy | Unda' the Rotunda | Boise Weekly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/05/16/184611542/house-republicans-vote-again-to-defund-obamacare|title=House Republicans Vote (Again) To Repeal Obamacare|website=npr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some states challenging it in federal court&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/six-more-states-join-floridas-lawsuit-over-health-care-law/1146132|title=Florida's lawsuit over health care law swells to 26 states – Tampa Bay Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website=tampabay.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opposition from some voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/obama_and_democrats_health_care_plan-1130.html|title=RealClearPolitics - Election Other - Public Approval of Health Care Law|website=www.realclearpolitics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, in a 5–4 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court found major portions of the law to be constitutional.&lt;ref name="NYT-upheld"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/us/supreme-court-lets-health-law-largely-stand.html|title=Supreme Court Lets Health Law Largely Stand, in Victory for Obama|last=Liptak|first=Adam|date=June 28, 2012|work=The New York Times|accessdate=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the law continues to face [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act#Legal challenges|legal challenges]]. The latest attempt at reversing the Affordable Care Act occurred during the Government Shutdown on October 1, 2013. Government officials that oppose the ACA tried to make approval of a bill to reopen the government contingent on the demise of the ACA. This attempt met with failure and the government reopened on November 16, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/16/politics/shutdown-showdown/ | work=CNN | title=Obama signs bill to end partial shutdown, avert debt default  | date=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:U.S. Uninsured and Uninsured Rate (1987 to 2008).JPG|thumb|right|400px|Uninsured Americans, with the numbers shown here from 1987 to 2008, are a major driver for reform efforts]]

As a result of the law, insurance companies can no longer charge members based on gender.  A study by the [[National Institutes of Health]] reported that the lifetime per capita expenditure at birth, using year 2000 dollars, showed a large difference between health care costs of females ($361,192) and males ($268,679).  A large portion of this cost difference is in the shorter lifespan of men, but even after adjustment for age (assume men live as long as women), there still is a 20% difference in lifetime health care expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=1361028 | pmid=15149482 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6773.2004.00248.x | volume=39 | issue=3 | title=The lifetime distribution of health care costs | year=2004 | journal=Health Serv Res | pages=627–42 |vauthors=Alemayehu B, Warner KE }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act's provisions become effective over time. The most significant changes, particularly affecting the availability and terms of insurance become effective January 1, 2014. These include an expansion of [[Medicaid]] (at the option of each state) to those without dependent children and subsidized healthcare exchanges. Changes which occur earlier include allowing dependents to remain on their plan until 26, limitations on [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] (dropping insureds when they get sick), removal of lifetime coverage limits, mandates that insurers fully cover certain preventative services, high-risk pools for uninsureds, tax credits for businesses to provide insurance to employees, an insurance company [[rate review program]], and minimum [[medical loss ratio]]s.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt;

The law creates the [[Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute]] to study [[comparative effectiveness research]] funded by a fee on insurers per covered life (starting at $1, increasing to $2 and thereafter adjusted according to an index&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cigna.com/aboutcigna/informed-on-reform/ior-article12.html Primer on PPACA's New Fees and Taxes]. Cigna.&lt;/ref&gt;). It also allowed the FDA to approve generic [[biologic medical product|biologic]] drugs and specifically allows for 12 years of exclusive use for newly developed biologic drugs.

In addition, the law explores some programs intended to increase incentives to provide quality and collaborative care, such as [[accountable care organization]]s. The [[Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation]] was created to fund pilot programs which may reduce costs;&lt;ref&gt;Kuraitis V. (2010). [http://e-caremanagement.com/pilots-demonstrations-innovation-in-the-ppaca-healthcare-reform-legislation/ Pilots, Demonstrations &amp; Innovation in the PPACA Healthcare Reform Legislation]. e-CareManagement.com.&lt;/ref&gt; the experiments cover nearly every idea healthcare experts advocate, except malpractice/[[tort reform]].&lt;ref name="NewYorker-Gawande"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = [[Atul Gawande|Gawande A]] |date=December 2009 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/12/14/091214fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=all| title = Testing, Testing | journal = [[The New Yorker]]| accessdate = March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law also requires for reduced Medicare reimbursements for hospitals with excess readmissions and eventually ties physician Medicare reimbursements to quality of care metrics.

The law is also designed to complement the 2009 [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act|HITECH Act]] which encourages the "meaningful use" of electronic health records; for example, the law directs the government to make use of these records for analyzing healthcare provider quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foley.com/ppaca-emphasizes-use-of-health-information-technology-05-13-2010/ PPACA Emphasizes Use of Health Information Technology]. Foley &amp; Lardner LLP.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Affordable Care Act also aims to promote access to preventative healthcare. Through providing access to screenings for diseases like breast cancer, promoting health in the workplace, and community preventative health, the Affordable Care Act contains sections that advance and promote preventative health initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koh|first=Howard K.|last2=Sebelius|first2=Kathleen G.|date=2010-09-30|title=Promoting Prevention through the Affordable Care Act|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp1008560|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=363|issue=14|pages=1296–99|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1008560|issn=0028-4793|pmid=20879876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives and research directions==
There are alternatives to the exchange-based market system which was enacted by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which have been proposed in the past and continue to be proposed, such as a single-payer system and allowing health insurance to be regulated at the federal level.

In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act of 2010 contained provisions which allows the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) to undertake pilot projects which, if they are successful could be implemented in future.

===Single-payer health care===
{{Further|Single-payer healthcare#United States}}

A number of proposals have been made for a universal single-payer healthcare system in the United States, most recently the [[United States National Health Care Act]], (popularly known as H.R. 676 or "Medicare for All") but none have achieved more political support than 20% congressional co-sponsorship.  Advocates argue that [[preventative health care]] expenditures can save several hundreds of billions of dollars per year because publicly funded universal health care would benefit employers and consumers, that employers would benefit from a bigger pool of potential customers and that employers would likely pay less, and would be spared administrative costs of health care benefits.  It is also argued that inequities between employers would be reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Institute of Medicine|first=Committee on the Consequences of Uninsurance; Board on Health Care Services|title=Hidden Costs, Value Lost: Uninsurance in America|date=2003|publisher=The National Academies Press|location=Washington, DC|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10719}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lincoln|first=Taylor|title=Severing the Tie That Binds: Why a Publicly Funded, Universal Health Care System  Would Be a Boon to U.S. Businesses|url=http://www.citizen.org/documents/severing-the-ties-that-bind-business-universal-healthcare-report.pdf|publisher=Public Citizen|accessdate=May 20, 2014|date=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ungar|first=Rick|title=A Dose Of Socialism Could Save Our States – State Sponsored, Single Payer Healthcare Would Bring In Business &amp; Jobs|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/04/06/a-dose-of-socialism-could-save-our-states-state-sponsored-single-payer-healthcare-would-bring-in-business-jobs/|accessdate=May 20, 2014|newspaper=Forbes|date=April 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, for example, [[cancer]] patients are more likely to be diagnosed at [[Cancer staging|Stage I]] where curative treatment is typically a few outpatient visits, instead of at [[Cancer staging|Stage III]] or later in an [[emergency room]] where treatment can involve years of hospitalization and is often terminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hogg | first1 = W. | last2 = Baskerville | first2 = N. | last3 = Lemelin | first3 = J. | title = Cost savings associated with improving appropriate and reducing inappropriate preventive care: Cost-consequences analysis | journal = BMC Health Services Research | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 20 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6963-5-20 | pmid = 15755330 | pmc =1079830 | url= http://pubmedcentralcanada.ca/pmcc/articles/PMC1079830/pdf/1472-6963-5-20.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Single Payer 101|url=http://www.amsa.org/AMSA/Libraries/Committee_Docs/SinglePayer101.sflb.ashx|publisher=American Medical Student Association|accessdate=May 20, 2014|author=Kao-Ping Chua|author2=Flávio Casoy|date=June 16, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212220841/http://amsa.org/AMSA/Libraries/Committee_Docs/SinglePayer101.sflb.ashx|archivedate=December 12, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have estimated a long-term savings amounting to 40% of all national health expenditures due to [[preventative health care]],&lt;ref name=canadasavings&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1186/1472-6963-5-20 | last1 = Hogg | first1 = W. | last2 = Baskerville | year = 2005 | first2 = N | last3 = Lemelin | first3 = J | title = Cost savings associated with improving appropriate and reducing inappropriate preventive care: cost-consequences analysis | journal = BMC Health Services Research | volume = 5 | issue = 1| page = 20 | pmid = 15755330 | pmc = 1079830 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although estimates from the [[Congressional Budget Office]] and ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' have found that preventative care is more expensive.&lt;ref&gt;PolitiFact: [http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/10/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-preventive-care-saves-money/ Barack Obama says preventive care 'saves money'.]  February 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Any national system would be paid for in part through taxes replacing insurance premiums, but advocates also believe savings would be realized through preventative care and the elimination of insurance company overhead and hospital billing costs.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Krugman |first=Paul |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/13/opinion/13krugman.html |title=One Nation, Uninsured |work=The New York Times  |date=June 13, 2005 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of a single-payer bill by the [[Physicians for a National Health Program]] estimated the immediate savings at $350 billion per year.&lt;ref name=pnhpsavings&gt;[[Physicians for a National Health Program]] (2008) [http://www.pnhp.org/facts/single_payer_system_cost.php?page=all "Single Payer System Cost?"] ''PNHP.org''&lt;/ref&gt;  The Commonwealth Fund believes that, if the United States adopted a universal health care system, the mortality rate would improve and the country would save approximately $570 billion a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Friedman|first=Gerald|title=Funding a National Single-Payer System "Medicare for All" Would save Billions, and Could Be Redistributive.|publisher=Dollars &amp; Sense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 1, 2017, in light of the recent Trump Administration’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, California Democratic Senator Ricardo Lara proposed a bill to establish single-payer healthcare within the state of California (SB 562), calling on fellow senators to act quickly in defense of healthcare. The legislation would implement “Medicare for All,” placing all levels of healthcare in the hands of the state. The bill proposed to the California Senate by Senator Lara lacked a method of funding required to finance the $400 billion-dollar policy. Despite this lack of foresight, the bill gained approval from the senate and will move on to await approval by the state assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-single-payer-healthcare-plan-advances-1496361965-htmlstory.html|title=Single- Payer healthcare plan advances in California Senate- without a way to pay its $400 billion tab|last=|first=|date=|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In wake of  the Affordable Care Act, the state of California has experienced the greatest rise in newly insured people compared to other states.  Subsequently, the number of physicians under MediCal are not enough to meet the demand, therefore 25% of physicians care for 80% of patients who are covered through MediCal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bindman|first=Andrew B.|last2=Schneider|first2=Andreas G.|date=2011-04-21|title=Catching a Wave — Implementing Health Care Reform in California|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp1014109|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=364|issue=16|pages=1487–1489|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1014109|issn=0028-4793|pmid=21449773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, California has struggled to maintain healthcare effectiveness, due in part to its unstable budget and complex regulations. The state has a policy in place known as the Gann Limit, otherwise entitled proposition 98, which ensures that a portion of state funds are directed towards the education system. This limit would be exceeded if California raises taxes to fund the new system which would require $100 billion in tax revenue. In order to avoid legal dispute, voters would be required to amend proposition 98 and exempt healthcare funding from required educational contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://calbudgetcenter.org/blog/can-california-implement-single-payer-health-care-system-without-going-ballot/|title=Can California Implement a Single-Payer Health Care System Without Going to the Ballot? - California Budget &amp; Policy Center|date=2017-07-21|work=California Budget &amp; Policy Center|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state announced on August 1, 2017 that coverage for health insurance will increase by 12.5% in next year, threatening the coverage of 1.5 million people &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-covered-california-hike-20170801-story.html|title=Covered California premiums will rise 12.5%, and Anthem Blue Cross cuts coverage|last=Karlamangla|first=Soumya|date=2017-08-01|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public option===
{{Main article| Public health insurance option}}

In January 2013, Representative [[Jan Schakowsky]] and 44 other [[U.S. House of Representatives]] Democrats introduced {{USBill|113|HR|261}}, the "Public Option Deficit Reduction Act" which would amend the 2010 [[Affordable Care Act]] to create a public option. The bill would set up a government-run health insurance plan with premiums 5% to 7% percent lower than private insurance. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] estimated it would reduce the [[United States public debt]] by $104 billion over 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/277505-house-dems-push-again-for-creation-of-government-run-health-insurance-option "House Dems push again for creation of government-run health insurance option"] ''The Hill'', January 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balancing doctor supply and demand===
The [[Medicare (United States)#Graduate Medical Education|Medicare Graduate Medical Education]] program regulates the supply of [[medical doctor]]s in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Graduate Medical Education Funding Is Not Helping Solve Primary Care, Rural Provider Shortages, Study Finds |url= http://www.rwjf.org/en/blogs/human-capital-blog/2013/06/graduate_medicaledu.html |publisher= Robert Wood Johnson Foundation |date= June 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By adjusting the reimbursement rates to establish more [[Economic inequality|income equality]] among the medical professions, the effective cost of medical care can be lowered.

===Bundled payments===
A key project is one that could radically change the way the medical profession is paid for services under Medicare and Medicaid. The current system, which is also the prime system used by medical insurers is known as [[fee-for-service]] because the medical practitioner is paid only for the performance of medical procedures which, it is argued means that doctors have a financial incentive to do more tests (which generates more income) which may not be in the patients' best long-term interest. The current system encourages medical interventions such as surgeries and prescribed medicines (all of which carry some risk for the patient but increase revenues for the medical care industry) and does not reward other activities such as encouraging behavioral changes such as modifying dietary habits and quitting smoking, or follow-ups regarding prescribed regimes which could have better outcomes for the patient at a lower cost. The current fee-for-service system also rewards bad hospitals for bad service. Some{{Who|date=September 2010}} have noted that the best hospitals have fewer re-admission rates than others, which benefits patients, but some of the worst hospitals have high re-admission rates which is bad for patients but is perversely rewarded under the fee-for-service system.

Projects at CMS are examining the possibility of rewarding health care providers through a process known as "[[bundled payment]]s"&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120803210546/http://www.hfma.org/Templates/InteriorMaster.aspx?id=22682 The Medicare Bundled Payment Pilot Program: Participation Considerations]&lt;/ref&gt; by which local doctors and hospitals in an area would be paid not on a fee for service basis but on a capitation system linked to outcomes. The areas with the best outcomes would get more. This system, it is argued, makes medical practitioners much more concerned to focus on activities that deliver real health benefits at a lower cost to the system by removing the perversities inherent in the fee-for-service system.

Though aimed as a model for health care funded by CMS, if the project is successful it is thought that the model could be followed by the commercial health insurance industry also.

==Trump administration efforts==
[[Donald Trump]] was elected President on a platform that included a pledge to  "repeal and replace" the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly called the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare). To that end it is supporting the proposed [[American Health Care Act]] (AHCA), developed by the House of Representatives. The administration has suggested that the AHCA is only part of its reform efforts. Other proposals include allowing interstate competition in the health insurance market.{{needs citation|date=August 2018}}

{{NSA surveillance|Lawsuits}}
'''''Hepting v. AT&amp;T''''' is a [[United States]] [[class action lawsuit]] filed in January 2006 by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) against the [[telecommunications]] company [[AT&amp;T]], in which the EFF alleges that AT&amp;T permitted and assisted the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) in unlawfully monitoring the communications of the [[United States]], including AT&amp;T customers, businesses and third parties whose communications were routed through AT&amp;T's network, as well as [[voice over IP]] telephone calls routed via the [[Internet]].

The case is separate from, but related to, the [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy]], in which the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] agency bypassed the [[United States federal courts|courts]] to monitor U.S. phone calls without warrants. ''Hepting v. AT&amp;T'' does not include the federal government as a party.

In July 2006, the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]]—in which the suit was filed—rejected a federal government motion to dismiss the case. The motion to dismiss, which invoked the [[state secrets privilege]], had argued that any court review of the alleged partnership between the federal government and AT&amp;T would harm national security.

The case was immediately appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]]. It was dismissed on June 3, 2009, citing retroactive legislation in the [[FISA Amendments Act]].&lt;ref name="eff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bazan" /&gt; On October 9, 2012, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] declined to review ''Hepting''.&lt;ref name="cnet hepting scotus"&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57529255-83/supreme-court-closes-door-on-warrantless-eavesdropping-suit/ Supreme Court closes door on warrantless eavesdropping suit]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], however, vowed to continue working on a similar case, ''[[Jewel v. NSA]]''.

==Background and allegation==

[[File:SER marcus decl.djvu|right|thumb|180px|page=17|Basic diagram of how the wiretapping was accomplished. From [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] court filings&lt;ref name=marcus1/&gt;]]
[[File:SER klein exhibits.djvu|right|thumb|180px|page=9|More complicated diagram of how it worked. From [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] court filings&lt;ref name=kleinex/&gt;]]

It is alleged in the lawsuit that in 2002-2003, AT&amp;T permitted and assisted the NSA to install a [[NarusInsight]] system in its [[San Francisco]] switching center ([[Room 641A]]), which was capable of monitoring billions of [[bit]]s of Internet traffic a second, including the playback of [[Voice over IP|telephone calls routed on the Internet]], and thus in effect spying upon the entirety of the communication of many or all American citizens and businesses who use the [[Internet]].

A former AT&amp;T engineer, [[Mark Klein]], attested that a [[supercomputer]] built by [[Narus (company)|Narus]] was installed for the purpose, and that similar systems were also installed in at least [[Seattle]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Diego]]. ''[[Wired News]]'' [https://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,70619-0.html states] Klein said he came forward "because he does not believe that the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] is being truthful about the extent of its [[extrajudicial]] monitoring of Americans' communications":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite what we are hearing, and considering the public track record of this administration, I simply do not believe their claims that the NSA's spying program is really limited to foreign communications or is otherwise consistent with the NSA's charter or with [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|FISA]] ... And unlike the controversy over targeted wiretaps of individuals' phone calls, this potential spying appears to be applied wholesale to all sorts of Internet communications of countless citizens.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The EFF alleges in the suit that AT&amp;T also allowed the NSA to [[data-mining|data-mine]] hundreds of [[terabytes]] of client records which included detailed transaction records such as domestic numbers dialed since 2001, and all Internet addresses visited, as well as other content. The EFF's attorney [[Kevin Bankston]] states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our goal is to go after the people who are making the government's illegal surveillance possible ... They could not do what they are doing without the help of companies like AT&amp;T. We want to make it clear to AT&amp;T that it is not in their legal or economic interests to violate the law whenever the president asks them to.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In its amended complaint, the EFF seeks [[Injunction|injunctive relief]] against AT&amp;T continuing such surveillance and [[damages]] allowed under the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act|Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)]], the [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act]], and other U.S. laws. It also seeks aggregated damages under each of four laws. These would exceed $100,000 for each instance of surveillance,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/att/att_complaint_amended.pdf Electronic Frontier Foundation's Amended Complaint]&lt;/ref&gt; creating potentially ruinous liability for AT&amp;T, considering the EFF's claims about the scope of AT&amp;T's cooperation.

==Litigation==
AT&amp;T objected to the filing of the documents supporting the case on the grounds they were trade secrets or might compromise the security of its network. The EFF speculated that the federal government would invoke the [[state secrets privilege]] to bar the entire lawsuit from being heard, but added: "If state secrecy can prevent us from preserving the rights of millions upon millions of people, then there is a profound problem with the law."

EFF's speculation proved accurate when the government indicated, in an April 28 statement of interest in the case, that it intended to invoke the state secrets privilege in a bid to dismiss the action.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eff.org/legal/cases/att/USA_statement_of_interest.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Justice Department filed its motion to dismiss on May 15, 2006. On July 20, however, Chief Judge [[Vaughn Walker]] of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] rejected the federal motion, holding that "[t]he government has opened the door for judicial inquiry by publicly confirming and denying material information about its monitoring of communications content."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/21/washington/21data.html?ex=1311134400&amp;en=8fffb6c71ba705d8&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss | work=The New York Times | first=John | last=Markoff | title=Judge Declines to Dismiss Privacy Suit Against AT&amp;T | date=July 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his decision not to dismiss the case Judge Walker certified the case for immediate appeal, and the government and AT&amp;T both appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]].  The case was argued in August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/att/hepting_9th_circuit_hearing_transcript_08152007.pdf Unofficial transcript of 9th Circuit hearing in Hepting v. AT&amp;T ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/us/politics/02fisa.html?_r=2&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;adxnnlx=1215712914-XE0YD2qi+8ZrETM1ub9MjA&amp; Obama Voters Protest His Switch on Telecom Immunity], ''[[New York Times]]'', 2 Jul 2008.

The Hepting plaintiffs opposed the motion to dismiss,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/att/immunityoppocorrected.pdf Plaintiff's motion in opposition to motion to dismiss]&lt;/ref&gt; asserting that the FISA Amendments Act's retroactive immunity provision was unconstitutional.

[[Image:irontriangle.PNG|400px|thumb|right|Iron Triangle diagram]]

In [[Politics of the United States|United States politics]], the '''iron triangle''' comprises the [[policy]]-making relationship among the [[congressional committee]]s, the [[bureaucracy]], and [[interest group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hayden|first=F.|title=Policymaking Network of the Iron-Triangle Subgovernment for Licensing Hazardous Waste Facilities|journal=Journal of Economic Issues|date=June 2002|volume=36|issue=2|page=479|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&amp;context=cbafacpub|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Central assumption ==

Central to the concept of an iron triangle is the assumption that bureaucratic agencies, as political entities, seek to create and consolidate their own power base.  In this view an agency's power is determined by its [[constituency]], not by its [[consumer]]s.  (For these purposes, "constituents" are politically active members sharing a common interest or goal; ''consumers'' are the expected recipients of goods or services provided by a governmental bureaucracy and are often identified in an agency's written goals or mission statement.)

Apparent bureaucratic dysfunction may be attributable to the [[Business alliance|alliances]] formed between the agency and its constituency.  The official goals of an agency may appear to be thwarted or ignored altogether at the expense of the citizenry it is designed to serve.

== Cultivation of a constituency ==

The need of a bureaucracy for a constituency sometimes leads to an agency's cultivation of a particular clientele.  An agency may seek out those groups (within its policy jurisdiction) that will make the best allies and give it the most clout within the political arena.

Often, especially in a low-level bureaucracy, the consumers (the supposed beneficiaries of an agency's services) do not qualify as power brokers and thus make poor constituents.  Large segments of the public have diffused interests, seldom vote, may be rarely or poorly organized and difficult to mobilize, and are often lacking in resources or financial muscle.  Less-educated and [[Poverty|poorer]] citizens, for example, typically make the worst constituents from an agency's perspective.

Private or special interest groups, on the other hand, possess considerable power as they tend to be well-organized, have plenty of resources, are easily mobilized, and are extremely active in political affairs, through [[voting]], [[Campaign finance|campaign contributions]], and [[lobbying]], as well as proposing legislation themselves.

Thus it may be in an agency's interest to switch its focus from its officially designated consumers to a carefully selected clientele of constituents that will aid the agency in its quest for greater political influence.

== Dynamics ==

In the United States, power is exercised in the Congress, and particularly in congressional committees and subcommittees.  By aligning itself with selected constituencies, an agency may be able to affect policy outcomes directly in these committees and subcommittees.  This is where an iron triangle may manifest itself.  The picture above displays the concept.
 
At one corner of the triangle are interest groups (constituencies). These are the powerful interest's groups that influence Congressional votes in their favor and can sufficiently influence the re-election of a [[member of Congress]] in return for supporting their programs.  At another corner sit members of Congress who also seek to align themselves with a constituency for political and electoral support.  These congressional members support [[legislation]] that advances the interest group's agenda.  Occupying the third corner of the triangle are bureaucrats, who are often pressured by the same powerful interest groups their agency is designated to regulate.  The result is a three-way, stable alliance that is sometimes called a '''''sub-government''''' because of its durability, impregnability, and power to determine policy.
 
An iron triangle can result in the passing of very narrow, [[Pork barrel|pork-barrel]] policies that benefit a small segment of the population. The interests of the agency's constituency (the interest groups) are met, while the needs of consumers (which may be the general public) are passed over. That public administration may result in benefiting a small segment of the public in this way may be viewed as problematic for the popular concept of [[democracy]] if the [[Common good|general welfare]] of all citizens is sacrificed for very specific interests. This is especially so if the legislation passed neglects or reverses the original purpose for which the agency was established.  Some maintain that such arrangements are consonant with (and are natural outgrowths of) the democratic process, since they frequently involve a majority block of voters implementing their will through their representatives in government.

The farm works closely with farmers organizations and holds one Permaculture Design Course per year.

=== Costa Rica ===
Saint Michaels Sustainable Community started building their Permaculture Ranch in 2001 in the mountains of Esterillos, Costa Rica 3.5 Kilometers from the beach. By 2015 they have become internationally recognized model of regenerative agriculture. The building of the community was accomplished by interns, volunteers, woofers, ecological experts, a NASA scientist,agriculture students, permaculturists, local farmers, and environmentalists (some that formerly worked for oil companies)and a regenerative rancher, Justin Dolan. Under Dolans' leadership five living roof homes have been designed and built using permaculture principals and two other homes have been built with [[rainwater harvesting]] roofs.  A natural salt water swimming pools was installed in a food forest containing over hundreds of types of fruits, medicinal herbs, a free energy aquaponics system, 12 rotational pastures, chickens, lambs, a herd of cattle, reforestation, an equestrian center, organic orchards, and a disc golf course. The Community is home to the Permaculture Country Club of Costa Rica (PCC). The club teaches a Journeyman Apprentice Program.  The Candidates need to demonstrate expert knowledge and experience of satisfactory performing the duties involved from start to finish of each area of Permaculute Namely:

The Instituto Mesoamericano de Permacultura (IMAP)&lt;ref name="IMAP" /&gt; was founded in 2000 by a group of Mayan farmers and professionals in San Lucas Toliman, Guatemala. It is a not-for-profit community organization focused on the development of self-sufficient communities through the responsible management of natural resources, using permaculture techniques and ancestral and traditional knowledge. Areas of focus include: the cultural and biological diversity of Mesoamerica; food security and food sovereignty; organic production systems at the community and familial level; and permaculture education and environmental stewardship.

=== Cuba ===
{{main article|Organoponicos}}
Since 1993, Cuba has transformed its food production using low-input, or [[organic agriculture]] and, to some degree, permaculture. [[Havana]] produces up to 50% of its food requirements within the city limits, much of it organic and produced by people in their homes, gardens and in municipal spaces&lt;ref name="Cuba" /&gt; The transformation in agriculture originated as a response to a crisis which is known as the [[Special Period]]. Starting in 1993 Australian permaculturists traveled to Cuba to educate Cuban gardeners in permaculture practices.&lt;ref name="AIDAB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tiller" /&gt;

=== Ecuador ===
{{unsourced|section|date=October 2017}}
The movement of sustainable communities in Ecuador reflects a bit the fact that it sits on the halfway mark of the Earth: it is neither invisible nor well defined, though small, it has many projects, although they are not necessarily part of a functional network.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The {{nihongo|'''Ministry of War'''&lt;ref name="Ministry of War"&gt;[http://www.temcauley.staff.shef.ac.uk/warmin.shtml Ministry of War], Sheffield.&lt;/ref&gt;|兵部省|Hyōbu-shō}}, sometimes called ''Tsuwamono no Tsukasa,'' was a division of the eighth century [[Japan]]ese government of the [[Imperial Court in Kyoto]],&lt;ref&gt;Kawakami, Karl Kiyoshi. (1903). {{Google books|Tm0uAAAAYAAJ|''The Political Ideas of the Modern Japan,'' pp. 36-38.|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; instituted in the [[Asuka period]] and formalized during the [[Heian period]].  The Ministry was replaced in the [[Meiji period]].

==Overview==
The highest-ranking official or {{nihongo|head of the military|兵部卿,|''Hyōbu-kyō''}} was ordinarily a son or a close relative of the Emperor. This important court officer was responsible for directing all military matters; and after the beginning in the late 12th century, this military man would have been empowered to work with the shogunate on the emperor's behalf.&lt;ref name="titsingh431"&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). {{Google books|18oNAAAAIAAJ|''Annales des empereurs du japon,'' p. 431.|page=431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ambit of the Ministry's activities encompasses, for example:
* oversight of the rosters of military officers, including examinations, appointment, ranks, etc.&lt;ref name="kawakami37"&gt;Kawakami, {{Google books|Tm0uAAAAYAAJ|p. 37 n3,|page=37}} citing [[Ito Hirobumi]], ''Commentaries on the Japanese Constitution,'' p. 87 (1889).&lt;/ref&gt;
* dispatching of troops&lt;ref name="kawakami37"/&gt;
* supervision of arsenals of weapons, guards, fortifications and signal fires&lt;ref name="kawakami37"/&gt;
* maintenance of pastures, military horses, and public and private horses and cattle&lt;ref name="kawakami37"/&gt;
* administration of postal stations&lt;ref name="kawakami37"/&gt;
* control of the manufacture of weapons and weapon-makers&lt;ref name="kawakami37"/&gt;
* oversight of drumming and in flute playing&lt;ref name="kawakami37"/&gt; 
* control of public and private means of water transportation&lt;ref name="kawakami37"/&gt;
* regulation of the training of hawks and dogs.&lt;ref name="kawakami37"/&gt;

==History==
The ministry was established as part of the [[Taika Reforms]] and ''[[Ritsuryō]]'' laws which were initiated in the [[Asuka period]] and formalized during the [[Heian period]].  After 702, the Hyōbu-shō replaced the ''Hyōseikan,'' which was created in 683.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis Frédéric ''et al.'' (2005). "Hyōbusho" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia,'' p. 363.|page=363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Edo period]], titles associated with the ministry became ceremonial titles.

In the [[Meiji period]], the ''hyōbu-shō'' was reorganized into a modern [[Ministry of War of Japan|Ministry of War]] and [[Ministry of the Navy of Japan|Ministry of the Navy]].

==Hierarchy==
The Asuka-, Nara-  and Heian-period Imperial court hierarchy encompassed a ministry dealing with military affairs.&lt;ref name="Ministry of War"/&gt;

In the 18th century, the top ritsuryō officials within this ministry structure were:

* {{nihongo|Minister or chief official|兵部卿|Hyōbu-kyō}}, usually a son or a close relative of the Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Varley, Paul. (1980). ''Jinnō Shōtōki'', p. 272; Titsingh, p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{nihongo|First assistant to the Minister|兵部大輔|Hyōbu-taifu}}.&lt;ref name="titsingh431"/&gt;
* {{nihongo|Second assistant to the Minister|兵部少輔|Hyōbu-shō}}.&lt;ref name="titsingh431"/&gt;
* {{nihongo|Senior staff officer|兵部大丞|Hyōbu no dai-jō}}.&lt;ref name="titsingh431"/&gt;
* {{nihongo|Junior staff officers|兵部少丞|Hyōbu no shō-jō}}, two positions.&lt;ref name="titsingh431"/&gt;
* {{nihongo|Director of dance|隼人正|Hayato no kami}}, considered a very low rank.&lt;ref name="titsingh431"/&gt;
* {{nihongo|First assistant director|隼人佑|Hayato no jō}}.&lt;ref name="titsingh431"/&gt;
* {{nihongo|Alternate assistant director|隼人令史|Hayato no sakan}}.&lt;ref name="titsingh431"/&gt;

The '''National Action''' (more commonly known by its Afrikaans name, ''Nasionale Aksie'') was a short-lived [[South African]] [[political party]] formed by Cassie Aucamp when he left the [[Afrikaner Eenheidsbeweging]] (AEB) in the 2003 [[Floor crossing (South Africa)|floor-crossing]] window. The AEB, along with other Afrikaner parties, was merging into the [[Freedom Front Plus]] to contest the [[South African general election, 2004|2004 elections]] but the National Action, claiming to support [[Afrikaner]] interests, remained separate, and competed in the [[South African general election, 2004|2004 elections]]. It won no seats in the [[National Assembly of South Africa]] or any of the provincial legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=13&amp;art_id=vn20040417101646779C866245&lt;/ref&gt; It did not contest the [[South African general election, 2009|2009 elections]].

The '''National Anti-Communist Front''' (Frente Anti-Communista Nacional) was a coalition of the anti-communist parties and groups (of ten or more) that supported [[Carlos Castillo Armas]]. Its program envisioned economic and social reforms for the development of [[Guatemala]] and the elimination of communist infiltration. Its members included the [[Anti-Communist Unification Party]] (PUA), [[Independent Anti-Communist Party of the West]] (PIACO), [[Anti-Communist University Students Committee]] (CEUA), Comités como el Cívico Independiente, Obrero Anticomunista, Femenino Anticomunista, de Locatarias, Asociación Juvenil Anticomunista, among others. In 1955, most member organizations were involved in the establishment of the [[National Democratic Movement (Guatemala)|National Democratic Movement]] (MDN).

'''Nature therapy''' (a broader term than related forest bathing or Shinrin-Yoku) which describes the practice that combines a range of exercises and tasks in an outdoor environment. Garden therapy, horticultural therapy, [[Sebastian Kneipp|Kneipp therapy]] or even ocean therapy may be viewed as forms of nature therapy.

== History ==
[[File:Shinrin Yoku Samurai Spain 02.jpg|thumb|Shinrin Yoku Samurai Spain]]
Anthropologically, nature therapy appears to have existed since the dawn of time in many cultures and tribes. ''[[wikt:shinrinyoku|Shinrin-yoku]]'' ({{lang|ja|森林浴}}) literally means forest bathing, originated in Japan in the early 1980s and may be regarded as a form of nature therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hansen MM, Jones R, Tocchini K | title = Shinrin-Yoku (Forest Bathing) and Nature Therapy: A State-of-the-Art Review | language = en | journal = International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health | volume = 14 | issue = 8 | pages = 851 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28788101 | doi = 10.3390/ijerph14080851 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuo M | title = How might contact with nature promote human health?

In the late 1990s a pseudoscientific variant called '''earthing''' or '''grounding''' started to be marketed, under the notion that the earth functions as an [[Ground (electricity)|electrical ground]] for people and that touching the earth provides an array of health benefits based on an incorrect understanding of [[antioxidant]] activity.&lt;ref name=novella&gt;{{cite web |last1=Novella |first1=Steven |title=Earthing |url=https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/earthing/ |website=NEUROLOGICAblog |accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nordlander''' is a [[Swedes|Swedish]] [[family]] originating from the village of [[Norrland (village)|Norrland]], [[Bjärtrå]] in [[Ångermanland]], [[Sweden]]. Daniel Persson (1683–1763) relocated to the Norrland estate from his former residence at the [[crown land]] ({{lang-sv|[[:sv:Kungsgård|Kungsgård]]}}) of Bjärtrå, a power house in Ångermanland until the establishment of [[Härnösand]] in 1585.&lt;ref&gt;In adjacent to the estate lies the ruins of a medieval fortification or [[manor house]], dated to the early 15th century with [[dendrochronology]], which probably served as a regional military defense position and for housing military personnel. The residence of the [[Vogt]], the regional [[Bailiff]] of Ångermanland, is believed to have been located on the same estate as the present building.

Lansstyrelsen.se. Retrieved on 2016-01-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, his sons Erik Nordlander (1723–1782) and Nils Nordlander (1726–1775) assumed the family name in accordance with that of the estate and its village.&lt;ref&gt;''Norrländska släkter'', del 2, O.

The '''Old Left''' is the pre-1960s [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] in the [[Western world]], the earlier leftist or [[Marxism|Marxist]] movements that had often taken a more [[vanguardism|vanguardist]] approach to [[social justice]] and focused mostly on [[labor union]]ization and questions of [[social class]] in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cynthia Kaufman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3nJUwFqRLTwC&amp;lpg=PA277&amp;ots=R6I8p1E-Mu&amp;dq=new%20left%20cynthia%20kaufman&amp;pg=PA275#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20left&amp;f=false|title=Ideas For Action: Relevant Theory For Radical Change|isbn=9780896086937|year=2003|publisher=South End Press}}&lt;br&gt;- [[Todd Gitlin]], "The Left's Lost Universalism", in Arthur M.

==History of the New Left==
The [[New Left]] arose first among dissenting intellectuals and campus groups in the United Kingdom and later alongside campus in the United States and in the [[Western bloc]].

The German-Jewish critical theorist [[Herbert Marcuse]] is referred to as the "Father of the New Left". Marcuse rejected the theory of class struggle and the [[Marxist]] concern with [[Labour economics|labor]]. According to [[Leszek Kołakowski]], Marcuse argued that since "all questions of material existence have been solved, moral commands and prohibitions are no longer relevant". He regarded the realization of man's erotic nature as the true liberation of humanity, which inspired the utopias of [[Jerry Rubin]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kołakowski|first=Leszek|authorlink=Leszek Kołakowski|title=Main Currents Of Marxism: Volume III, The Breakdown|year=1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0192851098|page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between 1943 and 1950, Marcuse worked in U.S. Government service for the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (predecessor of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]) and criticized the [[ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in the book ''[[Soviet Marxism: A Critical Analysis]]'' (1958). After his studies, in the 1960s and the 1970s he became known as the pre-eminent theorist of the New Left and the student movements of West Germany, France and the United States.

== Social policy ==
Unlike the New Left, the Old Left puts less emphasis on social issues such as [[Abortion-rights movements|abortion]], [[Drug policy reform|drugs]], [[feminism]], [[gay rights]] and [[gender role]]s. Since the mid-1970s with the advent of [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] movements such as [[Eurocommunism]] (and earlier in the Anglosphere, the New Left), some parties on the [[Far-left politics|far-left]] in the West they have begun to adopt homosexual rights from the New Left as part of their platform while parties in the East such as the [[Communist Party of Greece]] and the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] have rejected this move and continue to focus exclusively on worker politics as the Old Left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/23/greece-passes-bill-allowing-same-sex-civil-partnerships|title=Greece passes bill allowing civil partnerships for same-sex couples|first=|last=Reuters|date=22 December 2015|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web|url=http://mao.gr/koutsoumpgay/|title=Κουτσούμπας: Όχι στο σύμφωνο συμβίωσης και στο δικαίωμα υιοθεσίας για ομοφυλόφιλους |website=mao.gr}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web|url=http://gbtimes.com/opinion/after-all-homophobia-greek-word|title=After all, homophobia is a Greek word|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party voted against the Civil Partnerships Bill proposed by [[Syriza]], responding: "With the formation of a socialist-communist society, a new type of partnership will undoubtedly be formed—a relatively stable heterosexual relationship and reproduction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icl-fi.org/english/wv/1089/kke.html|title=Greek Communist Party Pushes Anti-Gay Bigotry|website=www.icl-fi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Communist Party of the Russian Federation supported a ban on the "promotion of non-traditional sexual relations to minors",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/politics/putin-law-gay-religious-457/|title=Putin signs 'gay propaganda' ban and law criminalizing insult of religious feelings|work=rt.com}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web|url=http://themoscownews.com/politics/20140129/192192050-print/Russian-State-Duma-Possessed-printer-or-executor-of-the-peoples.html|title=Russian State Duma: ‘Possessed printer’ or executor of the people’s will?|work=themoscownews.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301042652/http://themoscownews.com/politics/20140129/192192050-print/Russian-State-Duma-Possessed-printer-or-executor-of-the-peoples.html|archivedate=1 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly named a ban on "homosexual propaganda to minors" in Western media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/2013/06/11/russian-mps-vote-overwhelmingly-to-outlaw-gay-propaganda/|title=Russian MPs vote overwhelmingly to outlaw gay ‘propaganda’|work=euronews}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party is known to support bringing back the [[death penalty]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sputniknews.com/russia/20100329158350370/|title=Communist leader proposes reinstatement of death penalty for terrorists|first=|last=|website=Sputnik}}&lt;/ref&gt; like [[Communists of Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/politics/340092-spoiler-communists-highlight-massive-privatization/|title='Communists of Russia' urge massive nationalization, return of death penalty in elections program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] was a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] [[Entryism|entryist]] group in the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], based around the ''Militant'' newspaper launched in 1964. According to [[Michael Crick]], its politics were influenced by [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] and "virtually nobody else".{{sfn|Crick|1986|p=3}} Militant has been cited as an example left-wing opposition to feminism and gay rights initiatives within the [[labour movement]] in the early 1980s, specifically within the context of reaction to the financial support given to gay rights groups by the [[Greater London Council]] under the leadership of [[Ken Livingstone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Brooke|title=Sexual Politics: Sexuality, Family Planning, and the British Left from the 1880s to the Present Day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ozVM8IkcPWkC&amp;pg=PA237|date=24 November 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-956254-1|pages=236–237}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Militant was present in Labour Party women's sections, claiming forty delegates attended the Labour Party women's conference in 1981, it opposed feminism which declared that men were the enemy, or the cause of women's oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Taaffe|title=The Rise of Militant|url=http://www.socialistparty.org.uk/militant|date=November 1995|publisher=Militant Publications|isbn=978-0-906-582473|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communist leaders and intellectuals took many different positions on LGBT rights issues as Marx and Engels said very little on the subject in their published works. Marx in particular commented rarely on [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] in general. Writing for Political Affairs, Norman Markowitz writes: "Here, to be frank, one finds from Marx a refusal to entertain the subject, and from Engels open hostility to the individuals involved".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Markowitz|first1=Norman|title=The Communist movement and gay rights: The hidden history|url=http://www.politicalaffairs.net/the-communist-movement-and-gay-rights-the-hidden-history/|website=politicalaffairs.net|accessdate=22 March 2015|date=6 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816143523/http://politicalaffairs.net/the-communist-movement-and-gay-rights-the-hidden-history|archivedate=16 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because in private Engels criticized male homosexuality and related it to [[pederasty in ancient Greece|ancient Greek pederasty]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sexual Revolution in Russia: From the Age of the Czars to Today|pages=52–53|author=[[Igor Kon]]|publisher=Simon and Schuster|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that "[the ancient Greeks] fell into the abominable practice of sodomy [original German ''Knabenliebe'', meaning "boylove" or [[pederasty]] and degraded alike their gods and themselves with the myth of [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Angus|first1=Ian|last2=Riddell|first2=John|title=Engels and homosexuality|url=http://isreview.org/issue/70/engels-and-homosexuality|accessdate=4 April 2016|work=International Socialist Review|issue=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engels also said that the pro-pederast movement "cannot fail to triumph. ''Guerre aux cons, paix aus trous-de-cul'' [war on the cunts, peace to the arse-holes] will now be the slogan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://marxists.anu.edu.au/archive/marx/works/1869/letters/69_06_22.htm|title=Letters: Marx-Engels Correspondence 1869|author=Engels|date=|work=anu.edu.au|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305025853/https://marxists.anu.edu.au/archive/marx/works/1869/letters/69_06_22.htm|archivedate=5 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engels also referred to Dr. Karl Boruttau as a ''Schwanzschwulen'' ("[[faggot (slang)|faggot]]ty prick") in private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ireland|first1=Doug|title=Socialism and Gay Liberation: Back to the Future|url=http://nova.wpunj.edu/newpolitics/issue46/Ireland46.htm|publisher=|work=New Politics|volume= XII|issue= 2|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Encyclopedia of Homosexuality]]'' volume two is unequivocal on Marx and Engels view of homosexuality, stating: "There can be little doubt that, as far as they thought of the matter at all, Marx and Engels were personally [[homophobia|homo-phobic]], as shown by an acerbic 1869 exchange of letter on Jean-Baptiste von Schweitzer, a German socialist rival. Schweitzer had been arrested in a park on a morals charge and not only did Marx and Engels refuse to join a committee defending him, they resorted to the cheapest form of bathroom humor in their private comments about the affair".&lt;ref&gt;"Marxism" in ''Encyclopedia of Homosexuality'', Volume 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, [[Joseph Stalin]] added Article 121 to the entire Soviet Union criminal code, which made male homosexuality a crime punishable by up to five years in prison with hard labor. The precise reason for Article 121 is in some dispute among historians. The few official government statements made about the law tended to confuse homosexuality with [[pedophilia]] and was tied up with a belief that homosexuality was only practiced among [[Fascism|fascists]] or the [[aristocracy]]. The law remained intact until after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and was repealed in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6ad788c.html|title=Refworld – Russia: Update to RUS13194 of 16 February 1993 on the treatment of homosexuals|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|date=|work=Refworld|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web|url=http://www.savanne.ch/tusovka/en/pilot/homosexuality-russia.html |title=Anne Buetikofer – Homosexuality in the Soviet Union and in today's Russia |publisher=Savanne.ch |date=11 April 1999 |accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gay men were sometimes denied membership or expelled from [[Communist party|Communist parties]] across the globe during the 20th century as most Communist parties followed the social precedents set by the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hnn.us/roundup/comments/54160.html|title=Doug Ireland: Turns out Norman Thomas's Socialist Party Came Close to Breaking the Gay Taboo in 1952|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701195402/http://hnn.us/roundup/comments/54160.html|archivedate=1 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this was not the case in the West and notable gay members of Communist parties include the following:
* [[Mark Ashton]] (founder of [[Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners]]{{sfn|Kelliher|2014}} and LGBT rights advocate) – member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]{{sfn|Skeates|2007}}
* [[Harry Hay]] (gay rights activist, [[Union organizer|labor advocate]],{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=64–65}} [[Native American civil rights]] campaigner,{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=193–197}} [[Mattachine Society]] founder,{{sfn|Timmons|1990|pp=143–145}} co-founder of Los Angeles [[Gay Liberation Front]]){{sfn|Timmons|1990|p=230}} – member of the [[Communist Party USA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=NORMAN MARKOWITZ|title=The Communist movement and gay rights: The hidden history|url=http://www.politicalaffairs.net/the-communist-movement-and-gay-rights-the-hidden-history/|publisher=|work=Political Affairs|accessdate=27 January 2015|date=6 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816143523/http://politicalaffairs.net/the-communist-movement-and-gay-rights-the-hidden-history|archivedate=16 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An other example of left-wing opposition to homosexuality is the [[Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova]], a left-wing party which strongly opposes [[LGBT rights in Moldova]]. Despite officially associating itself with the left-wing movement, the party is working with nationalist, right-wing and religious movements to counter the "promotion of vice spread with the help of the US in Moldova".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moldova.org/en/lgbt-solidarity-march-held/ "LGBT solidarity march in Moldova stopped due to fear of clashes with orthodox counter protesters"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parties that subscribe to the Old Left ==
* [[Communist Party of Greece]] (since 1918)
* [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] (since 1993)
* [[Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova]] (since 1997)

Total involvement faltered in the 1980s, citing that rural violence and regional destabilization disheartened many of the rural members. However, it was also during the 1980s that Angola passed the first [[anti-discrimination law]]s and established strict [[literacy]] laws to support uneducated women.&lt;ref&gt;Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Workers' Party (Movimento Popular de Libertação de Angola-Partido de Trabalho).

As part of the group's commitment to gender equality, over thirty percent of the candidates running for office in the upcoming election are men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Partia e Fortë, gati listën zgjedhore për Prishtinë|url=http://www.zeri.info/artikulli/14004/partia-e-forte-gati-listen-zgjedhore-per-prishtine|accessdate=28 October 2013|newspaper=Zëri|date=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Party seeks to maintain the political ''status quo'', praising Kosovo as a democratic country where living people as well as "those in the other world" can vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zeri.info/artikulli/8459/themelohet-partia-e-forte Themelohet Partia e Fortë], Zëri portal, 24 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Party leaders claim a victory of around 120 percent, as measured by the group's pollsters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arifaj: Unë do të jetoj sa të dojë populli|url=http://www.botasot.info/kosova/245962/arifaj-une-do-te-jetoj-sa-te-doje-populli/|accessdate=28 October 2013|newspaper=Bota Sot|date=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Party is headed by [[Visar Arifaj]]—whose official title ''Kryetar Lexhendar'' (Legendary Chairman) is intentionally misspelled with the so-called hard ''xh''—and other young activists from [[Prishtina]]. It is the only political party which has no ordinary members, beside the Legendary Chairman all its supporters serve as deputy chairmen. The Strong Party is a grass roots organization linked to the [[coffee culture]] of Kosovo's capital.

The first public appearance outside of Facebook and Twitter was on Klan Kosova cable television in early 2013.

On first elections on October 2013, Partia e Fortë got votes to get at least one person elected in the Municipal Assembly of the capital city Prishtina.

Krugman was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IB3mBsgfIHQC&amp;pg=PA721&amp;lpg=PA721&amp;dq=krugman&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q=krugman&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, Volume 1 edited by Stephen Harlan Norwood, Eunice G.

Since present-day science fell far short of "psychohistory", Krugman turned to economics as the next best thing.&lt;ref&gt;Interview, U.S. Economist Krugman Wins Nobel Prize in Economics [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/july-dec08/nobelkrugman_10-13.html "PBS, Jim Lehrer News Hour"], October 13, 2008, transcript Retrieved October 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', August 6, 2009, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/09/books/review/Upfront-t.html?_r=1 "Up Front: Paul Krugman"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Krugman earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] ''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.biographyonline.net/nobelprize/economics/paul-krugman.html | title=Paul Krugman Biography &amp;#124;}}&lt;/ref&gt; summa cum laude'' in economics from [[Yale University]] in 1974, and went on to pursue a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in economics from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT).  In 1977, he successfully completed his PhD in three years, with a thesis titled ''Essays on flexible exchange rates''. While at MIT, he was part of a small group of MIT students sent to work for the [[Central Bank of Portugal]] for three months in the summer of 1976, during the chaotic aftermath of the [[Carnation Revolution]].&lt;ref name=incidents/&gt;

Krugman later praised his PhD thesis advisor, [[Rudi Dornbusch]], as "one of the great economics teachers of all time" and said that he "had the knack of inspiring students to pick up his enthusiasm and technique, but find their own paths".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krugman, 2002, [http://www.pkarchive.org/theory/Rudi.html Rudi Dornbusch]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, Krugman presented a number of ideas to Dornbusch, who flagged as interesting the idea of a monopolistically competitive trade model. Encouraged, Krugman worked on it and later wrote, "[I] knew within a few hours that I had the key to my whole career in hand".&lt;ref name=incidents/&gt; In that same year, Krugman wrote "[[The Theory of Interstellar Trade]]", a tongue-in-cheek essay on computing interest rates on goods in transit near the speed of light. He says he wrote it to cheer himself up when he was "an oppressed assistant professor".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krugman, March 11, 2008, ''The New York Times'' blog, [https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/11/economics-the-final-frontier/ "Economics: the final frontier"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
[[File:Paul Krugman at the German National Library in Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Krugman giving a lecture at the German National Library in Frankfurt in 2008.]]

Krugman became an assistant professor at Yale University in September 1977. He joined the faculty of MIT in 1979. From 1982 to 1983, Krugman spent a year working at the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] [[White House]] as a staff member of the [[Council of Economic Advisers]]. He rejoined MIT as a full professor in 1984. Krugman has also taught at [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Yale University|Yale]], and the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref name=Krugman_CV&gt;[https://www.princeton.edu/pr/pictures/g-k/krugman/Krugman-CV.pdf Krugman Curriculum Vitae]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Krugman joined [[Princeton University]] as Professor of Economics and International Affairs. He is also currently Centenary Professor at the London School of Economics, and a member of the [[Group of Thirty]] international economic body.&lt;ref name="krugmanonline"/&gt; He has been a research associate at the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] since 1979.&lt;ref name=PWB/&gt; Krugman was President of the Eastern Economic Association in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramapo.edu/eea/|title=Home – Eastern Economic Association|work=Eastern Economic Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2014, he announced that he would be retiring from Princeton in June 2015 and that he would be joining the faculty at the [[Graduate Center of the City University of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;

I will also become a distinguished scholar at the Graduate Center's Luxembourg Income Study Center.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Krugman has written extensively on international economics, including [[international trade]], [[economic geography]], and [[international finance]]. The [[Research Papers in Economics]] project ranks him among the world's most influential economists.&lt;ref name="IDEAS"/&gt;  Krugman's ''International Economics: Theory and Policy'', co-authored with [[Maurice Obstfeld]], is a standard undergraduate [[textbook]] on international economics.&lt;ref&gt;"Sources of international friction and cooperation in high-technology development and trade." National Academies Press, 1996, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; He is also co-author, with [[Robin Wells Krugman|Robin Wells]], of an undergraduate economics text which he says was strongly inspired by the first edition of [[Paul Samuelson]]'s classic textbook.&lt;ref name=paul_samuelson_rip&gt;{{cite news | author = Paul Krugman | title = Paul Samuelson, RIP | date = December 13, 2009 | newspaper = The New York Times | quote = One of the things Robin Wells and I did when writing our principles of economics textbook was to acquire and study a copy of the original, 1948 edition of Samuelson's textbook. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Krugman also writes on economic topics for the general public, sometimes on international economic topics but also on [[income distribution]] and [[public policy]].

The [[Nobel Prize Committee]] stated that Krugman's main contribution is his analysis of the effects of [[Economy of scale|economies of scale]], combined with the assumption that consumers appreciate [[diversity (business)|diversity]], on [[international trade]] and on the location of economic activity.&lt;ref name=NobelComments&gt;Nobel Prize Committee, [https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2008/advanced-economicsciences2008.pdf "The Prize in Economic Sciences 2008"]&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of spatial issues in economics has been enhanced by Krugman's ability to popularize this complicated theory with the help of easy-to-read books and state-of-the-art syntheses. "Krugman was beyond doubt the key player in 'placing geographical analysis squarely in the economic mainstream' ... and in conferring it the central role it now assumes."&lt;ref name=behrensrobert/&gt;

=== New trade theory ===
Prior to Krugman's work, trade theory (see [[David Ricardo]] and [[Heckscher–Ohlin model]]) emphasized trade based on the [[comparative advantage]] of countries with very different characteristics, such as a country with a high agricultural [[productivity]] trading agricultural products for industrial products from a country with a high industrial productivity. However, in the 20th century, an ever-larger share of trade occurred between countries with similar characteristics, which is difficult to explain by comparative advantage. Krugman's explanation of trade between similar countries was proposed in a 1979 paper in the ''[[Journal of International Economics]]'', and involves two key assumptions: that consumers prefer a diverse choice of brands, and that production favors [[economies of scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/10/13/krugman-nobel-economics-oped-cx_ap_1013panagariya.html|title=Paul Krugman, Nobel|author=Arvind Panagariya|date=October 13, 2008|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers' preference for diversity explains the survival of different versions of cars like Volvo and BMW. However, because of economies of scale, it is not profitable to spread the production of [[Volvo]]s all over the world; instead, it is concentrated in a few factories and therefore in a few countries (or maybe just one). This logic explains how each country may specialize in producing a few brands of any given type of product, instead of specializing in different types of products.

The horizontal axis represents costs of trade, while the vertical axis represents the share of either region in manufacturing. Solid lines denote stable equilibria, dashed lines denote unstable equilibria.]]

Krugman modeled a 'preference for diversity' by assuming a [[Constant elasticity of substitution|CES utility function]] like that in a 1977 paper by [[Avinash Dixit]] and [[Joseph Stiglitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dixit |first=Avinash |authorlink= |author2=Stiglitz, Joseph |year=1977 |title=Monopolistic Competition and Optimum Product Diversity |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=297–308  |jstor=1831401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Toru |last=Kikuchi |title=The Dixit-Stiglitz-Krugman Trade Model: A Geometric Note |number=1006 |journal=Discussion Papers from Graduate School of Economics, Kobe University |url=http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/koewpaper/1006.htm|year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many models of international trade now follow Krugman's lead, incorporating economies of scale in production and a preference for diversity in consumption.&lt;ref name=NobelComments/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosser |first=J. Barkley |year=2011 |title=Monopolistic Competition and Optimum Product Diversity |page=24 |chapter=2: The New Economic Geography Approach |quote=The workhorse model of this approach since 1991 has been the model of monopolistic competition due to Avinash Dixit and Joseph Stiglitz (1977). It was used by Paul Krugman (1979, 1980) to provide an approach to analyzing increasing returns in international trade. | publisher=Springer }}&lt;/ref&gt; This way of modeling trade has come to be called [[New Trade Theory]].&lt;ref name=behrensrobert/&gt;

Krugman's theory also took into account transportation costs, a key feature in producing the "[[home market effect]]", which would later feature in his work on the new economic geography. The home market effect "states that, [[ceteris paribus]], the country with the larger demand for a good shall, at equilibrium, produce a more than proportionate share of that good and be a net exporter of it."&lt;ref name=behrensrobert/&gt; The home market effect was an unexpected result, and Krugman initially questioned it, but ultimately concluded that the mathematics of the model were correct.&lt;ref name=behrensrobert/&gt;

When there are economies of scale in production, it is possible that countries may become '[[Vendor lock-in|locked into]]' disadvantageous patterns of trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krugman | first1 = P. | year = 1981 | title = Trade, accumulation, and uneven development | url = | journal = Journal of Development Economics | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 149–61 | doi=10.1016/0304-3878(81)90026-2| hdl = 10419/160238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Krugman points out that although globalization has been positive on a whole, since the 1980s the process known as hyper-globalization has at least played a part in rising inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krugman. https://www.ubs.com/microsites/nobel-perspectives/en/paul-krugman.html{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in UBS Nobel Perspectives interview, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, trade remains beneficial in general, even between similar countries, because it permits firms to save on costs by producing at a larger, more efficient scale, and because it increases the range of brands available and sharpens the competition between firms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/finance/economicsfocus/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12429411 "Bold strokes: a strong economic stylist wins the Nobel"], ''[[The Economist]]'', October 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Krugman has usually been supportive of [[free trade]] and [[globalization]].&lt;ref name=smokymountain /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(He writes on p. xxvi of his book ''The Great Unraveling'' that "I still have the angry letter [[Ralph Nader]] sent me when I criticized his attacks on globalization.")&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been critical of [[industrial policy]], which New Trade Theory suggests might offer nations [[rent-seeking]] advantages if "strategic industries" can be identified, saying it's not clear that such identification can be done accurately enough to matter.&lt;ref&gt;''Strategic trade policy and the new international economics'', Paul R. Krugman (ed), The MIT Press, p. 18, {{ISBN|978-0-262-61045-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New economic geography ===
It took an interval of eleven years, but ultimately Krugman's work on New Trade Theory (NTT) converged to what is usually called the "new economic geography" (NEG), which Krugman began to develop in a seminal 1991 paper, "Increasing Returns and Economic Geography", published in the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/honoring-paul-krugman/ "Honoring Paul Krugman"] ''Economix'' blog of ''The New York Times'', Edward Glaeser, October 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In Krugman's own words, the passage from NTT to NEG was "obvious in retrospect; but it certainly took me a while to see it. ... The only good news was that nobody else picked up that $100 bill lying on the sidewalk in the interim."&lt;ref name=allinohlin&gt;Krugman (1999) [http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/ohlin.html "Was it all in Ohlin?"]&lt;/ref&gt; This would become Krugman's most-cited academic paper: by early 2009, it had 857 citations, more than double his second-ranked paper.&lt;ref name=behrensrobert&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Behrens | first1 = Kristian | last2 = Robert-Nicoud | first2 = Frédéric | year = 2009 | title = Krugman's Papers in Regional Science: The 100 dollar bill on the sidewalk is gone and the 2008 Nobel Prize well-deserved | url = | journal = Papers in Regional Science | volume = 88 | issue = 2| pages = 467–89 | doi=10.1111/j.1435-5957.2009.00241.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krugman called the paper "the love of my life in academic work."&lt;ref name=KrugmanNobelInterview&gt;Krugman PR (2008), [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2008/krugman-interview.html "Interview with the 2008 laureate in economics Paul Krugman"], December 6, 2008. Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "home market effect" that Krugman discovered in NTT also features in NEG, which interprets [[economies of agglomeration|agglomeration]] "as the outcome of the interaction of increasing returns, trade costs and [[factor price]] differences."&lt;ref name=behrensrobert/&gt; If trade is largely shaped by [[Economy of scale|economies of scale]], as Krugman's trade theory argues, then those economic regions with most production will be more profitable and will therefore attract even more production. That is, NTT implies that instead of spreading out evenly around the world, production will tend to concentrate in a few countries, regions, or cities, which will become densely populated but will also have higher levels of income.&lt;ref name=NobelComments/&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes131008"/&gt;

=== Agglomeration and economies of scale ===
Manufacturing is characterized by increasing returns to scale and less restrictive and expansive land qualifications as compared to agricultural uses. So, geographically where can manufacturing be predicted to develop? Krugman states that manufacturing's geographical range is inherently limited by economies of scale, but also that manufacturing will establish and accrue itself in an area of high demand. Production that occurs adjacent to demand will result in lower transportation costs, but demand, as a result, will be greater due to concentrated nearby production. These forces act upon one another simultaneously, producing manufacturing and population agglomeration. Population will increase in these areas due to the more highly developed infrastructure and nearby production, therefore lowering the expense of good, while economies of scale provide varied choices of goods and services. These forces will feed into each other until the greater portion of the urban population and manufacturing hubs are concentrated into a relatively insular geographic area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Economics/Faculty/Matthew_Turner/ec2410/readings/Krugman_JPE1991.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International finance ===
Krugman has also been influential in the field of [[international finance]]. As a graduate student, Krugman visited the [[Federal Reserve Board]], where [[Stephen Salant]] and Dale Henderson were completing their discussion paper on [[speculative attacks]] in the gold market. Krugman adapted their model for the [[foreign exchange market]], resulting in a 1979 paper on [[Currency crisis|currency crises]] in the ''[[Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking]]'', which showed that misaligned [[fixed exchange rate]] regimes are unlikely to end smoothly: instead, they end in a sudden [[speculative attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/crises.html |title=Currency Crises |publisher=Web.mit.edu |accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krugman's paper is considered one of the main contributions to the [[Currency crisis#Theories|'first generation']] of [[currency crisis]] models,&lt;ref name="Sarno "&gt;{{cite book|last=Sarno |first=Lucio |author2=Mark P. Taylor |title=The Economics of Exchange Rates |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |pages=245–64|isbn=978-0-521-48584-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig Burnside, Martin Eichenbaum, and Sergio Rebelo (2008), [http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/rebelo/htm/currency%20crisis%20models%20Ed.pdf "Currency crisis models"], ''New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is his second-most-cited paper (457 citations as of early 2009).&lt;ref name=behrensrobert/&gt;

In response to the [[global financial crisis of 2008]], Krugman proposed, in an informal "mimeo" style of publication,&lt;ref&gt;"The International Finance Multiplier", P. Krugman, October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; an "international finance multiplier", to help explain the unexpected speed with which the global crisis had occurred. He argued that when, "highly leveraged financial institutions [HLIs], which do a lot of cross-border investment [....] lose heavily in one market [...] they find themselves undercapitalized, and have to sell off assets across the board. This drives down prices, putting pressure on the balance sheets of other HLIs, and so on." Such a rapid contagion had hitherto been considered unlikely because of [[Eco-economic decoupling|"decoupling" in a globalized economy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kohn20080626a.htm "Global Economic Integration and Decoupling"], [[Donald L.

The note was soon being cited in papers (draft and published) by other economists,&lt;ref&gt;"The geography of finance: after the storm", R O'Brien, A Keith, ''Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society'', June 2009 2(2): 245–65 {{doi|10.1093/cjres/rsp015}} [https://archive.is/20130415164333/http://intl-cjres.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/rsp015]&lt;/ref&gt; even though it had not itself been through ordinary peer review processes.

=== Macroeconomics and fiscal policy ===
Krugman has done much to revive discussion of the [[liquidity trap]] as a topic in economics.&lt;ref&gt;

Krugman had argued in ''The Return of Depression Economics'' that Japan was in a liquidity trap in the late 1990s, since the [[central bank]] could not drop interest rates any lower to escape economic stagnation.&lt;ref&gt;Krugman, Paul (1999). "The Return of Depression Economics", pp. 70–77. W. W. Norton, New York {{ISBN|0-393-04839-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core of Krugman's policy proposal for addressing Japan's liquidity trap was [[inflation targeting]], which, he argued "most nearly approaches the usual goal of modern stabilization policy, which is to provide adequate demand in a clean, unobtrusive way that does not distort the allocation of resources."&lt;ref name=thinkingtrap/&gt; The proposal appeared first in a web posting on his academic site.&lt;ref name=jtrap&gt;"Japan's Trap", May 2008.

Krugman has since drawn parallels between Japan's '[[Lost Decade (Japan)|lost decade]]' and the [[late 2000s recession]], arguing that expansionary fiscal policy is necessary as the major industrialized economies are mired in a liquidity trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/15/opinion/15krugman.html |title=Stay the Course |work = The New York Times |accessdate=August 15, 2009 |last=Krugman |first=Paul | date=June 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to economists who point out that the [[Japanese economy]] recovered despite not pursuing his policy prescriptions, Krugman maintains that it was an export-led boom that pulled Japan out of its economic slump in the late-90s, rather than reforms of the financial system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rieti.go.jp/en/rieti_report/108.html "Some Reasons Why a New Crisis Needs a New Paradigm of Economic Thought"], Keiichiro Kobayashi, RIETI Report No.108, Research Institute of Economy, Trade &amp; Industry (Japan), 07-31-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

His view that most peer-reviewed macroeconomic research since the mid-1960s is wrong, preferring simpler models developed in the 1930s, has been criticized by some modern economists, like [[John H.

A May 2011 [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] analysis of 26 politicians, journalists, and media commentators who made predictions in major newspaper columns or television news shows from September 2007 to December 2008 found that Krugman was the most accurate. Only nine of the prognosticators predicted more accurately than chance, two were significantly less accurate, and the remaining 14 were no better or worse than a coin flip. Krugman was correct in 15 out of 17 predictions, compared to 9 out of 11 for the next most accurate media figure, [[Maureen Dowd]].&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson ''et al.''

[[File:Paul Krugman BBF 2010 Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Krugman at the 2010 [[Brooklyn Book Festival]].]]
In the 1990s, besides academic books and textbooks, Krugman increasingly began writing books for a general audience on issues he considered important for public policy. In ''The Age of Diminished Expectations'' (1990), he wrote in particular about the increasing [[Income inequality in the United States|US income inequality]] in the "[[New Economy]]" of the 1990s. He attributes the rise in income inequality in part to changes in technology, but principally to a change in political atmosphere which he attributes to [[Conservatism in the United States|Movement Conservatives]].

In September 2003, Krugman published a collection of his columns under the title, ''[[The Great Unraveling]]'', about the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]'s economic and foreign policies and the US economy in the early 2000s. His columns argued that the large deficits during that time were generated by the Bush administration as a result of decreasing taxes on the rich, increasing public spending, and fighting the [[Iraq War]]. Krugman wrote that these policies were unsustainable in the long run and would eventually generate a major economic crisis. The book was a best-seller.&lt;ref name=onehanded&gt;''[[The Economist]]'', November 13, 2003, [http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=2208841 "Paul Krugman, one-handed economist"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Great Unraveling: Losing Our Way in the New Century|publisher=Powell's Books |url=http://www.powells.com/biblio/61-0393326055-0 | accessdate =November 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rollingstone06&gt;Krugman, Paul, ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.

In 2007, Krugman published ''[[The Conscience of a Liberal]]'', whose title refers to [[Barry Goldwater]]'s ''[[Conscience of a Conservative]]''.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR1FpbMkZ58 "Nobelpristagaren i ekonomi 2008: Paul Krugman"], speech by Paul Krugman (Retrieved December 26, 2008) 00:43 "The title of The Conscience of a Liberal [...] is a reference to a book published almost 50 years ago in the United States called The ''Conscience of a Conservative'' by Barry Goldwater. That book is often taken to be the origin, the start, of a movement that ended up dominating U.S. politics that reached its first pinnacle under [[Ronald Reagan]] and then reached its full control of the U.S. government for most of the last eight years."&lt;/ref&gt; It details the history of wealth and income gaps in the United States in the 20th century. The book describes how the gap between rich and poor declined greatly in middle of the century, and then widened in the last two decades to levels higher even than in the 1920s. In ''Conscience'', Krugman argues that government policies played a much greater role than commonly thought both in reducing inequality in the 1930s through 1970s and in increasing it in the 1980s through the present, and criticizes the Bush administration for implementing policies that Krugman believes widened the gap between the rich and poor.

Krugman also argued that [[US Republican Party|Republicans]] owed their electoral successes to their ability to exploit the race issue to win political dominance of the South.&lt;ref name="tomaskyconlibrev"&gt;[[Michael Tomasky]], ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', November 22, 2007, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20813 "The Partisan"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krugman, Paul. ''The Conscience of a Liberal'', 2007, W.W. Norton &amp; Co. {{ISBN|0-393-06069-1}} p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; Krugman argues that [[Ronald Reagan]] had used the "[[Southern Strategy]]" to signal sympathy for racism without saying anything overtly racist,&lt;ref&gt;''Conscience of a Liberal'', p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; citing as an example Reagan's coining of the term "[[welfare queen]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Conscience of a Liberal'', p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, Krugman proposed a "new [[New Deal]]", which included placing more emphasis on social and medical programs and less on national defense.&lt;ref&gt;October 17, 2007 – Krugman [http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07/10/17/1352236 "On Healthcare, Tax Cuts, Social Security, the Mortgage Crisis and Alan Greenspan"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113203402/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07%2F10%2F17%2F1352236 |date=November 13, 2007 }}, in response to [[Alan Greenspan]]'s [http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07/09/24/1412226 September 24 appearance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009174033/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=07%2F09%2F24%2F1412226 |date=October 9, 2007 }} with [[Naomi Klein]] on ''[[Democracy Now!]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  In his review of ''Conscience of a Liberal'', the liberal journalist and author [[Michael Tomasky]] credited Krugman with a commitment "to accurate history even when some fudging might be in order for the sake of political expediency."&lt;ref name="tomaskyconlibrev" /&gt; In a review for ''The New York Times'', [[Pulitzer prize]]-winning historian [[David M. Kennedy (historian)|David M. Kennedy]] stated, "Like the rants of [[Rush Limbaugh]] or the films of [[Michael Moore]], Krugman's shrill polemic may hearten the faithful, but it will do little to persuade the unconvinced".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/books/review/Kennedy-t.html "Malefactors of Megawealth"] David M. Kennedy&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2008, Krugman published a substantial updating of an earlier work, entitled ''The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008''. In the book, he discusses the failure of the United States regulatory system to keep pace with a financial system increasingly out-of-control, and the causes of and possible ways to contain the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s. In 2012, Krugman published ''[[End This Depression Now!]]'', a book which argues that looking at the available historical economic data, fiscal cuts and austerity measures only deprive the economy of valuable funds that can circulate and further add to a poor economy – people cannot spend, and markets cannot thrive if there is not enough consumption and there cannot be sufficient consumption if there is large unemployment. He argues that while it is necessary to cut debt, it is the worst time to do so in an economy that has just suffered the most severe of financial shocks, and must be done instead when an economy is near full-employment when the private sector can withstand the burden of decreased government spending and austerity. Failure to stimulate the economy either by public or private sectors will only unnecessarily lengthen the current economic depression and make it worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Krugman's Prescription For A 'Depression'|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/04/27/151473654/paul-krugmans-prescription-for-a-depression|work=NPR Books|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commentator ==
[[Martin Wolf]] has written that Krugman is both the "most hated and most admired columnist in the US".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/022acf50-a4d1-11e1-9a94-00144feabdc0.html|title= Lunch with the FT: Paul Krugman|publisher= Financial Times|author= [[Martin Wolf]]|date = May 24, 2012|accessdate= 2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Economist [[J. Peter Neary]] has noted that Krugman "has written on a wide range of topics, always combining one of the best prose styles in the profession with an ability to construct elegant, insightful and useful models."&lt;ref name=neary&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Neary |first1 = J.

Through his extensive writings, including a regular column for ''The New York Times'', monographs and textbooks at every level, and books on economics and current affairs for the general public ... he has probably done more than any other writer to explain economic principles to a wide audience."&lt;ref name=neary/&gt; Krugman has been described as the most controversial economist in his generation&lt;ref name=Hirsch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/world/china+the+financial+nexus++krugman/109620 |title="China the financial nexus" – Krugman |publisher=Channel4.com |accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to [[Michael Tomasky]] since 1992 he has moved "from being a center-left scholar to being a liberal polemicist."&lt;ref name="tomaskyconlibrev"/&gt;

From the mid-1990s onwards, Krugman wrote for ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' (1997–99)&lt;ref name=PWB&gt;''Princeton Weekly Bulletin'', October 20, 2008, [https://www.princeton.edu/pr/pwb/volume98/issue07/krugman/ "Biography of Paul Krugman"], 98(7)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' (1996–99),&lt;ref name=PWB/&gt; and then for ''[[The Harvard Business Review]]'', ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'', ''[[The Economist]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'', and ''[[Washington Monthly]]''. In this period Krugman critiqued various positions commonly taken on economic issues from across the political spectrum, from [[protectionism]] and opposition to the [[World Trade Organization]] on the left to [[supply side economics]] on the right.&lt;ref name=monthly/&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential campaign]], Krugman praised [[Bill Clinton]]'s economic plan in ''The New York Times'', and Clinton's campaign used some of Krugman's work on [[income inequality]]. At the time, it was considered likely that Clinton would offer him a position in the new administration, but allegedly Krugman's volatility and outspokenness caused Clinton to look elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Hirsch&gt;{{cite news|title=A Nobel-Bound Economist Punctures the CW – and Not a Few Big-Name Washington Egos|last=Hirsh|first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Hirsh (journalist) |date=March 4, 1996|publisher=[[Newsweek]]|accessdate=October 13, 2008|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/101625}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krugman later said that he was "temperamentally unsuited for that kind of role. You have to be very good at people skills, biting your tongue when people say silly things."&lt;ref name=monthly/&gt;&lt;ref name=NS160404&gt;''[[New Statesman]]'', February 16, 2004, [http://www.newstatesman.com/200402160018 "NS Profile – Paul Krugman"]&lt;/ref&gt; In a Fresh Dialogues interview, Krugman added, "you have to be reasonably organized... I can move into a pristine office and within three days it will look like a grenade went off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freshdialogues.com/2009/12/09/paul-krugman-transcript-will-climate-legislation-kill-the-economy/ |title=Fresh Dialogues interview with Alison van Diggelen, November 2009 |publisher=Freshdialogues.com |date=December 9, 2009 |accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, near the height of the [[dot com boom]], ''The New York Times'' approached Krugman to write a bi-weekly column on "the vagaries of business and economics in an age of prosperity."&lt;ref name=monthly/&gt; His first columns in 2000 addressed business and economic issues, but as the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 US presidential campaign]] progressed, Krugman increasingly focused on [[George W. Bush]]'s policy proposals. According to Krugman, this was partly due to "the silence of the media – those 'liberal media' conservatives complain about..."&lt;ref name=monthly/&gt; Krugman accused Bush of repeatedly misrepresenting his proposals, and criticized the proposals themselves.&lt;ref name=monthly/&gt; After Bush's election, and his perseverance with his proposed tax cut in the midst of the slump (which Krugman argued would do little to help the economy but substantially raise the fiscal deficit), Krugman's columns grew angrier and more focused on the administration. As [[Alan Blinder]] put it in 2002, "There's been a kind of [[missionary]] quality to his writing since then ... He's trying to stop something now, using the power of the pen."&lt;ref name=monthly/&gt; Partly as a result, Krugman's twice-weekly column on the Op-Ed page of ''The New York Times'' has made him, according to [[Nicholas Confessore]], "the most important political columnist in America... he is almost alone in analyzing the most important story in politics in recent years – the seamless melding of corporate, class, and political party interests at which the Bush administration excels."&lt;ref name="monthly"&gt;{{cite web|last=Confessore|first=Nicholas|title=Comparative Advantage|work=[[The Washington Monthly]]|date=December 2002|accessdate=February 5, 2007|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0212.confessore.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206044322/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0212.confessore.html|archive-date=February 6, 2007|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in late 2009, Krugman said his missionary zeal had changed in the post-Bush era and he described the Obama administration as "good guys but not as forceful as I'd like...When I argue with them in my column this is a serious discussion. We really are in effect speaking across the transom here."&lt;ref name="freshdialogues.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freshdialogues.com/2009/12/09/paul-krugman-transcript-will-climate-legislation-kill-the-economy/ |title=Fresh Dialogues interview with Alison van Diggelen |publisher=Freshdialogues.com |date=December 9, 2009 |accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krugman says he's more effective at driving change outside the administration than inside it, "now, I'm trying to make this progressive moment in American history a success. So that's where I'm pushing."&lt;ref name="freshdialogues.com"/&gt;

Krugman's columns have drawn criticism as well as praise. A 2003 article in ''[[The Economist]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=(unattributed)|title=The one-handed economist|journal=The Economist|date=November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; questioned Krugman's "growing tendency to attribute all the world's ills to [[George W. Bush|George Bush]]," citing critics who felt that "his relentless partisanship is getting in the way of his argument" and claiming errors of economic and political reasoning in his columns.&lt;ref name=onehanded/&gt; [[Daniel Okrent]], a former ''The New York Times'' [[ombudsman]], in his farewell column, criticized Krugman for what he said was "the disturbing habit of shaping, slicing and selectively citing numbers in a fashion that pleases his acolytes but leaves him open to substantive assaults."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Okrent | first = Daniel | authorlink = | title = 13 Things I Meant to Write About but Never Did | work = The New York Times | date = May 22, 2005 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/22/weekinreview/22okrent.html | accessdate = August 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=headache/&gt;

Krugman's ''New York Times'' blog is "The Conscience of a Liberal," devoted largely to economics and politics.

Five days after [[9/11]] terrorist attacks, Krugman argued in his column that calamity was "partly self-inflicted" due to transfer of responsibility for airport security from government to airlines. His column provoked an angry response and ''The New York Times'' was flooded with complaints. According to [[Larissa MacFarquhar]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'', while some people{{Who|date=November 2011}} thought that he was too partisan to be a columnist for ''The New York Times'', he was revered on the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/03/01/100301fa_fact_macfarquhar?currentPage=all | work=[[The New Yorker]] | author=Larissa MacFarquhar | date=March 1, 2010 | accessdate=October 5, 2011 | title=The Deflationist: How Paul Krugman found politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Paul Krugman |title=Reckonings; Paying the Price |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/16/opinion/reckonings-paying-the-price.html |work=The Conscience of a Liberal |date=September 16, 2001 |accessdate=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 on the United States Krugman again provoked a controversy by accusing on his ''New York Times'' blog former U.S. President George W. Bush and former New York City mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]] of rushing "to cash in on the horror" after the attacks and describing the anniversary as "an occasion for shame".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Paul Krugman |title=The Years of Shame |url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/the-years-of-shame/ |work=The Conscience of a Liberal |date=September 11, 2011 |accessdate=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0911/63404.html | work=[[The Politico]] | author=Tim Mak | date=September 13, 2011 | accessdate=October 5, 2011 | title=Paul Krugman defenders attacked by conservative bloggers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krugman was noteworthy for his fierce opposition to the 2016 presidential campaign of [[Bernie Sanders]]. On January 19, 2016 he wrote an article which criticized Bernie Sanders for his perceived lack of political realism, compared Sanders' plans for healthcare and financial reform unfavorably to those of [[Hillary Clinton]], and cited criticisms of Sanders from other liberal policy wonks like Mike Konczal and [[Ezra Klein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Paul Krugman |title=Weakened at Bernie's|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/19/weakened-at-bernies/|work=The Conscience of a Liberal |date=January 19, 2016|accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Krugman wrote an article which accused Sanders of "[going] for easy slogans over hard thinking" and attacking Hillary Clinton in a way that was "just plain dishonest." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Paul Krugman |title=Sanders Over the Edge|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/08/opinion/sanders-over-the-edge.html?_r=0|date=April 8, 2016|accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 12 July 2016, Krugman tweeted "[[leprechaun economics]]", in response to [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)]] data that 2015 GDP grew 26.3% and 2015 GNP grew 18.7%.  The [[leprechaun economics]] affair (proved in 2018 to be Apple restructuring its [[double Irish]] subsidiaries), led to the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] introducing a new economic statistic, [[Modified gross national income]] (or GNI*) to better measure the Irish economy (2016 Irish GDP is 143% of 2016 Irish GNI*).  The term [[leprechaun economics]] has since been used by Krugman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/leprechaun-economics-and-neo-lafferism/|title=Leprechaun Economics and Neo-Lafferism|publisher=New York Times|date=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/leprechauns-of-eastern-europe/|title=Leprechauns of Eastern Europe | publisher=New York Times | date=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-07-19/the-u-s-has-a-leprechaun-economy-effect-too|title=The U.S. Has a 'Leprechaun Economy' Effect, Too|publisher=Bloomberg|date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/housing-data-reveals-return-of-leprechaun-economics-1.3056546?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fhousing-data-reveals-return-of-leprechaun-economics-1.3056546|title=Housing data reveals return of 'leprechaun economics'|publisher=Irish Times|date=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to describe distorted/unsound economic data.

=== East Asian growth ===
In a 1994 ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' article, Paul Krugman argued that it was a [[myth]] that the economic successes of the [[Four Asian Tigers|East Asian 'tigers']] constituted an economic miracle. He argued that their rise was fueled by mobilizing resources and that their growth rates would inevitably slow.&lt;ref name="Myth Asia"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krugman |first=Paul |date=December 1994 |title=The Myth of Asia's Miracle |journal=Foreign Affairs |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19941101faessay5151/paul-krugman/the-myth-of-asia-s-miracle.html |accessdate=December 26, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016011308/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19941101faessay5151/paul-krugman/the-myth-of-asia-s-miracle.html |archive-date=October 16, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His article helped popularize the argument made by [[Lawrence Lau]] and [[Alwyn Young]], among others, that the growth of economies in [[East Asia]] was not the result of new and original economic models, but rather from high [[capital investment]] and increasing [[Labor force|labor force participation]], and that total factor productivity had not increased. Krugman argued that in the long term, only increasing [[total factor productivity]] can lead to sustained [[economic growth]]. Krugman's article was highly criticized in many Asian countries when it first appeared, and subsequent studies disputed some of Krugman's conclusions. However, it also stimulated a great deal of research, and may have caused the [[Singapore]] government to provide incentives for technological progress.&lt;ref name="VanDenBerg "&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Den Berg |first=Hendrik |author2=Joshua J.

During the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], Krugman advocated [[currency controls]] as a way to mitigate the crisis. Writing in a [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'' magazine]] article, he suggested exchange controls as "a solution so unfashionable, so stigmatized, that hardly anyone has dared suggest it."&lt;ref name="Saving Asia"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krugman |first=Paul |date=September 7, 1998|title=Saving Asia: It's Time To Get Radical The IMF plan not only has failed to revive Asia's troubled economies but has worsened the situation.

=== U.S. economic policies ===
In the early 2000s, Krugman repeatedly criticized the [[Bush tax cuts]], both before and after they were enacted. Krugman argued that the tax cuts enlarged the budget deficit without improving the economy, and that they enriched the wealthy – worsening [[income distribution]] in the US.&lt;ref name=rollingstone06/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Krugman |first=Paul |date=March 21, 2003 |title=Who Lost the U.S. Budget? |journal=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/21/opinion/21KRUG.html |accessdate=June 24, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725084400/http://nytimes.com/2003/03/21/opinion/21KRUG.html |archivedate=July 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dana |first=Will |date=March 23, 2003 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/25146816/voodoo_economics |title=Voodoo Economics |journal= Rolling Stone |accessdate=August 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://dailyuw.com/2003/10/9/krugman-blasts-bush/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009000849/http://dailyuw.com/2003/10/9/krugman-blasts-bush/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 9, 2009 |date=October 9, 2003 |title=Krugman blasts Bush |journal=The Daily of the University of Washington |accessdate=August 1, 2009 |last=Lehrke |first=Dylan Lee }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Krugman|first=Paul|date=October 7, 2001 |title=Fuzzy Math Returns |journal=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/07/opinion/07KRUG.html |accessdate=August 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krugman advocated lower interest rates (to promote investment and spending on housing and other durable goods), and increased government spending on infrastructure, military, and unemployment benefits, arguing that these policies would have a larger stimulus effect, and unlike permanent tax cuts, would only temporarily increase the budget deficit.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Times20020802&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/02/opinion/dubya-s-double-dip.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=Dubya's Double Dip?|last=Krugman|first=Paul|date=Aug 2, 2002|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=Jul 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he was against Bush's proposal to privatize social security.&lt;ref name=SimonsRock20160521&gt;{{cite news|url=http://simons-rock.edu/students-families/commencement/paul-krugman-speech.php|title=Paul Krugman Commencement Speech?|last=Krugman|first=Paul|date=May 21, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623162121/http://simons-rock.edu/students-families/commencement/paul-krugman-speech.php|archive-date=June 23, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, after [[Alan Greenspan]] expressed concern over housing markets, Krugman criticized Greenspan's earlier reluctance to regulate the mortgage and related financial markets, arguing that "[he's] like a man who suggests leaving the barn door ajar, and then – after the horse is gone – delivers a lecture on the importance of keeping your animals properly locked up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Krugman |first=Paul |date=August 29, 2005 |title=Greenspan and the Bubble |journal=The New York Times  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/29/opinion/29krugman.html|accessdate=December 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krugman has repeatedly expressed his view that Greenspan and [[Phil Gramm]] are the two individuals most responsible for causing the [[subprime crisis]]. Krugman points to Greenspan and Gramm for the key roles they played in keeping [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]], financial markets, and [[investment bank]]s unregulated, and to the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]], which repealed [[Great Depression]] era safeguards that prevented [[commercial bank]]s, investment banks and [[insurance]] companies from merging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Krugman|first=Paul|date=March 24, 2008 |title=Financial Crisis Should Be at Center of Election Debate |journal=Spiegel Online |url=https://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,543074,00.html |accessdate=July 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Krugman |first=Paul |date=March 24, 2008 |title=Taming the Beast |journal=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/24/opinion/24krugman.html |accessdate=July 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krugman |first=Paul |date=March 29, 2008 |title=The Gramm connection |journal=The New York Times  |url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/the-gramm-connection/ |accessdate=June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lerer|first=Lisa|date=March 28, 2008 |title=McCain guru linked to subprime crisis |journal=Politico|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0308/9246.html |accessdate=June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krugman has also been critical of some of the [[Obama administration]]'s economic policies. He has criticized the [[Obama stimulus plan]] as being too small and inadequate given the size of the economy and the banking rescue plan as misdirected; Krugman wrote in ''The New York Times'': "an overwhelming majority [of the American public] believes that the government is spending too much to help large financial institutions. This suggests that the administration's money-for-nothing financial policy will eventually deplete its political capital."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Krugman. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/09/opinion/09krugman.html "Behind the Curve"]. ''The New York Times''. March 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he considered the [[Obama administration]]'s actions to prop up the US financial system in 2009 to be impractical and unduly favorable to Wall Street bankers.&lt;ref name=headache&gt;[[Evan Thomas]], ''[[Newsweek]]'', April 6, 2009, [http://www.newsweek.com/id/191393 "Obama's Nobel Headache"]&lt;/ref&gt; In anticipation of President Obama's Job Summit in December 2009, Krugman said in a Fresh Dialogues interview, "This jobs summit can't be an empty exercise...he can't come out with a proposal for $10 or $20&amp;nbsp;Billion of stuff because people will view that as a joke. There has to be a significant job proposal...I have in mind something like $300&amp;nbsp;Billion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freshdialogues.com/2009/11/13/paul-krugman-obama-job-summit-transcript/ |title=Fresh Dialogues interview with Alison van Diggelen, November 2009 |publisher=Freshdialogues.com |date=November 13, 2009 |accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krugman has recently criticized China's exchange rate policy, which he believes to be a significant drag on global economic recovery from the [[Late-2000s recession]], and he has advocated a "surcharge" on Chinese imports to the US in response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/15/opinion/15krugman.html |title=Taking on China |date=March 15, 2010 |author=Paul Krugman |work = The New York Times Company |accessdate=March 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremy Warner of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' accused Krugman of advocating a return to self-destructive [[protectionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/jeremy-warner/7483177/Paul-Krugman-the-Nobel-prize-winner-who-threatens-the-world.html |title=Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize winner who threatens the world |author=Jeremy Warner |date=March 19, 2010 |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=March 22, 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, as the Senate began considering new financial regulations, Krugman argued that the regulations should not only regulate financial innovation, but also tax financial-industry profits and remuneration. He cited a paper by [[Andrei Shleifer]] and [[Robert Vishny]] released the previous week, which concludes that most innovation was in fact about "providing investors with false substitutes for [traditional] assets like bank deposits," and once investors realize the sheer number of securities that are unsafe a "flight to safety" occurs which necessarily leads to "financial fragility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Krugman, Paul | title = Don't cry for Wall Street |work = The New York Times | date = April 23, 2010 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/opinion/23krugman.html | accessdate = April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Shleifer, Andrei |author2 = Vishny, Robert |author3 = Gennaioli, Nicola |title = Financial Innovation and Financial Fragility |date = April 12, 2010 |url = http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/shleifer/files/financial_innovation_fragility.april12.pdf |accessdate = April 27, 2010 |journal =  |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100506040539/http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/shleifer/files/financial_innovation_fragility.april12.pdf |archive-date = May 6, 2010 |dead-url = yes |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his June 28, 2010 column in ''The New York Times'', in light of the recent [[2010 G-20 Toronto Summit|G-20 Toronto Summit]], Krugman criticized world leaders for agreeing to halve deficits by 2013. Krugman claimed that these efforts could lead the global economy into the early stages of a "third depression" and leave "millions of lives blighted by the absence of jobs." He advocated instead the continued stimulus of economies to foster greater growth.&lt;ref name="Toronto"&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Krugman |title=The Third Depression |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/28/opinion/28krugman.html |work=The New York Times |date=June 28, 2010 |accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the article, Krugman comes out in favor of free trade given the enormous political costs of actively engaging in [[Strategic trade theory|strategic trade policy]] and because there is no clear method for a government to discover which industries will ultimately yield positive returns. He also notes that increasing returns and strategic trade theory do not disprove the underlying truth of [[comparative advantage]].

In 2015, Krugman noted his ambivalence about the proposed [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]], as the agreement was not mainly about trade and, "whatever you may say about the benefits of free trade, most of those benefits have already been realized" [by existing agreements].&lt;ref name="NYT_June_15_2015c"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/22/opinion/paul-krugman-trade-and-trust.html?_r=0 |title=Trade and Trust |newspaper=The New York Times |date= May 22, 2015 |author=Paul Krugman |accessdate= June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political views ==
Krugman describes himself as [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]], and has explained that he views the term "liberal" in the American context to mean "more or less what [[social democracy|social democratic]] means in Europe."&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; In a 2009 ''[[Newsweek]]'' article, [[Evan Thomas]] described Krugman as having "all the credentials of a ranking member of the East coast liberal establishment" but also as someone who is anti-establishment, a "scourge of the Bush administration", and a critic of the Obama administration.&lt;ref name=headache/&gt; In 1996, ''[[Newsweek]]''{{'s}} [[Michael Hirsh (journalist)|Michael Hirsh]] remarked,

{{quote|Say this for Krugman: though an unabashed liberal ... he's ideologically colorblind. He savages the supply-siders of the Reagan-Bush era with the same glee as he does the 'strategic traders' of the Clinton administration.&lt;ref name=Hirsch/&gt;}}

Krugman has at times advocated free markets in contexts where they are often viewed as controversial. He has written against [[rent control]] and [[zoning|land-use restrictions]] in favor of market supply and demand,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/07/opinion/reckonings-a-rent-affair.html Reckonings; A Rent Affair], by Paul Krugman, ''The New York Times'', June 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/30/opinion/inequality-and-the-city.html Inequality and the City], by Paul Krugman, ''The New York Times'', November 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; likened the opposition against free trade and globalization to the opposition against evolution via [[natural selection]] (1996),&lt;ref name=difficultidea&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/ricardo.htm |title=''Ricardo's difficult idea'' |publisher=Web.mit.edu |date=1996 |accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; opposed [[Agricultural subsidy|farm subsidies]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E4D91730F934A35756C0A9649C8B63 True Blue Americans] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206074455/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E4D91730F934A35756C0A9649C8B63 |date=December 6, 2008 }}, by Paul Krugman, ''The New York Times'', May 7, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; argued that [[sweatshop]]s are preferable to unemployment,&lt;ref name=smokymountain&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/1918 In Praise of Cheap Labor] by Paul Krugman, Slate, March 21, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; dismissed the case for [[living wage]]s (1998),&lt;ref name=minimumwage&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Living+Wage:+What+It+Is+and+Why+We+Need+It.-a021103427 Book review of ''Living Wage: What It Is and Why We Need It''] Paul Krugman, Washington Monthly, September 1, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and argued against mandates, subsidies, and tax breaks for [[Ethanol fuel|ethanol]] (2000).&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E1DB1430F936A15755C0A9669C8B63 Driving Under the Influence], by Paul Krugman, ''The New York Times'', June 25, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, he questioned the usefulness of [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]'s manned space flights given the available technology and their high financial cost compared to their general benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E4DF1138F937A35751C0A9659C8B63 A Failed Mission] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206074445/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E4DF1138F937A35751C0A9659C8B63 |date=December 6, 2008 }}, by Paul Krugman, ''The New York Times'', February 4, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Krugman has also criticized U.S. zoning laws&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher =The New York Times |title = The Texas Unmiracle |date = Aug 14, 2011 |author = Paul Krugman }}&lt;/ref&gt; and European labor market regulation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01EFD6163CF93AA15750C0A9669C8B63 Reckonings; Pursuing Happiness], by Paul Krugman, ''The New York Times'', March 29, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E7DE1139F930A35756C0A9669C8B63 Reckonings; Blessed Are the Weak], by Paul Krugman, ''The New York Times'', May 3, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; He calls current Israeli policy "narrow-minded" and "basically a gradual, long-run form of national suicide", saying that it's "bad for Jews everywhere, not to mention the world".&lt;ref&gt;[https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/the-crisis-of-zionism/ The Crisis of Zionism], by Paul Krugman, ''The New York Times'', April 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. race relations ===
Krugman has criticized the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] leadership for what he sees as a strategic (but largely tacit) reliance on racial divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Krugman |title=Republicans and Race |work=The New York Times |date=November 19, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/19/opinion/19krugman.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Krugman |title=The Town Hall Mob |work=The New York Times |date=August 7, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/07/opinion/07krugman.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Conscience of a Liberal: Book Review |first=William |last=Amponsah |work=Savannah Daily News |date=December 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Conscience of a Liberal'', he wrote:

{{quote|The changing politics of race made it possible for a revived conservative movement, whose ultimate goal was to reverse the achievements of the New Deal, to win national elections – even though it supported policies that favored the interests of a narrow elite over those of middle- and lower-income Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jay |last=Parini |author-link=Jay Parini |title=Review: The Conscience of a Liberal |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=March 22, 2008 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/22/politics1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== On working in the Reagan administration ===
Krugman worked for [[Martin Feldstein]] when the latter was appointed chairman of the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] and chief economic advisor to President [[Ronald Reagan]]. He later wrote in an autobiographical essay, "It was, in a way, strange for me to be part of the Reagan Administration. I was then and still am an unabashed defender of the [[welfare state]], which I regard as the most decent social arrangement yet devised."&lt;ref name=incidents&gt;[https://www.princeton.edu/~pkrugman/incidents.html Incidents From My Career], by Paul Krugman, Princeton University Press, Retrieved December 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Krugman found the time "thrilling, then disillusioning". He did not fit into the Washington political environment, and was not tempted to stay on.&lt;ref name=incidents/&gt;

=== On Gordon Brown vs David Cameron ===
According to Krugman, [[Gordon Brown]] and his party were unfairly blamed for the  [[late-2000s financial crisis]].&lt;ref name=gordontheunlucky&gt;{{cite news |title=Gordon the Unlucky |first=Paul |last=Krugman |date=June 7, 2009 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/08/opinion/08krugman.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also praised the former [[British Prime Minister]], whom he described as "more impressive than any US politician" after a three-hour conversation with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2010/dec/23/gordon-brown-anthony-seldon-book |work=The Guardian |first=Andrew |last=Sparrow |title=Thirty new facts about Gordon Brown from Anthony Seldon's book |date=December 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krugman asserted that Brown "defined the character of the worldwide financial rescue effort" and urged British voters not to support the opposition [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]], arguing their Party Leader [[David Cameron]] "has had little to offer other than to raise the red flag of fiscal panic."&lt;ref name=gordontheunlucky/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Krugman |title=Gordon Does Good |work=The New York Times |date=October 12, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/opinion/13krugman.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On President Trump ===
Krugman has been a vocal critic of President Trump and his administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trump's Deadly Narcissism |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/opinion/trumps-deadly-narcissism.html |access-date=December 12, 2017|date=2017-09-29 |last1=Krugman |first1=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt; His criticisms have included the president's climate change proposals, the Republican tax plan and Trump's foreign policy initiatives. Krugman has often used his ''New York Times'' Op-Ed column to set out arguments against the President's policies.

== Personal life ==
Krugman has been married twice. His first wife, Robin L. Bergman, is a designer. He is currently married to [[Robin Wells (economist)|Robin Wells]], an academic economist who received her BA from the University of Chicago and her PhD from the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Robin Wells |publisher=Macmillan Learning |access-date=November 22, 2017 |url=http://macmillanlearning.com/Catalog/Author/robinwells}}&lt;/ref&gt; She, as did Krugman, taught at MIT. Together, Krugman and his wife have collaborated on several economics textbooks. Although rumors began to circulate in early 2007 that Krugman's "son" was working for Hillary Clinton's campaign, Krugman reiterated in his NY Times Op-Ed column that he and his wife are childless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Krugman |title=About my son (blog post) |work=The New York Times |date=December 19, 2007 |url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/19/about-my-son/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=THE DEFLATIONIST: How Paul Krugman found politics |first=Larissa |last=MacFarquhar |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=March 1, 2010 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/03/01/100301fa_fact_macfarquhar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Krugman |title=Your questions answered |date=January 10, 2003 |access-date=December 19, 2007 |publisher=Blog archive |url=http://www.pkarchive.org/personal/Strangelove.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krugman currently lives in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Krugman |title=Inequality and the City |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 30, 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/30/opinion/inequality-and-the-city.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon retiring from Princeton after fifteen years of teaching in June 2015, he addressed the issue in his column, stating that while he retains the utmost praise and respect for Princeton, he wishes to reside in New York City and hopes to focus more on public policy issues.&lt;ref name=changes&gt;{{cite web |title=Changes (Personal/Professional) (blog post) |first=Paul |last=Krugman |work=The New York Times |date=February 28, 2014 |url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/28/changes-personalprofessional/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently became a professor at the [[Graduate Center of the City University of New York]] and a distinguished scholar at the Graduate Center's [[Luxembourg Income Study]] Center.&lt;ref name=changes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Noted Economist Paul Krugman to Join Graduate Center Faculty in 2015 |url=http://www.gc.cuny.edu/News/GC-News/Detail?id=23418 |publisher=[[The Graduate Center, CUNY]] |date=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krugman reports that he is a distant relative of conservative journalist [[David Frum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/david-frum-aei-heritage-and-health-care/ |work=The New York Times |title=David Frum, AEI, Heritage And Health Care (blog post) |first=Paul |last=Krugman |date=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has described himself as a "Loner.

{{Politics of South Africa}}
The '''Progressive Federal Party''' (PFP) ({{lang-af|Progressiewe Federale Party}}) was a [[South Africa]]n [[political party]] formed in 1977. It was the main parliamentary opposition to apartheid, instead advocating [[power-sharing]] in [[South Africa]] through a [[Federation|federal]] constitution.

Its first leader was [[Colin Eglin]], who was succeeded by [[Frederik van Zyl Slabbert]] and then [[Zach de Beer]]. Another prominent member was [[Harry Schwarz]] who had led the Reform Party and was the chairman of the Federal Executive (1976–79), finance spokesman (1975–91) and defence spokesman (1975–84). He was regarded as the PFP's greatest parliamentary performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leon|first=Tony|year=2009|title=On the Contrary: Leading the Opposition in the New South Africa|publisher=Jonathan Ball Publishers|isbn=1-86842-259-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its best known parliamentarian was however [[Helen Suzman]], who was for many years the only member of the [[White South African|white]]s-only parliament to speak out unequivocally against the [[apartheid]] regime.

== Formation ==

The party was preceded by the [[Progressive Party (South Africa)|Progressive Party]] as the liberal opposition to the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]]. While the main opposition [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] contained liberal factions, the PP had for many years been the only purely liberal party represented in parliament. A realignment began when liberal members of the UP left to found the [[Reform Party (South Africa)|Reform Party]] in 1975, which merged with the Progressives to form the [[Progressive Reform Party (South Africa)|Progressive Reform Party]] later the same year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1977, another group of United Party members left the by then rapidly declining party to form the Committee for a United Opposition, which then joined the Progressive Reform Party to form the Progressive Federal Party.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv/UQ:11195/louw2.pdf Packing for Perth: The Growth of a Southern African Diaspora], Eric Louw, Gary Mersham, Asian and Pacific Migration Journal, Vol. 10, No. 2, 2001 303]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

South Africa's apartheid laws initially limited the party's membership to the country's whites, from which it drew support mainly from liberal [[South African English|English]] speakers. It opened up its membership to all races as soon as this became legal again, in 1984,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/opposition-progressive-federal-party-pfp-opens-its-membership-all-races|title=The opposition Progressive Federal Party (PFP) opens its membership to all races.|first=|last=tinashe|date=11 November 2011|website=sahistory.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the party remained predominantly white and English. It won seats in cities such as Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Johannesburg and Durban. It had very little support amongst Afrikaners, and the PFP was derided by right-wing whites, who claimed its initials stood for 'Packing for Perth', because of the many white liberal supporters of the 'Progs', who were emigrating to [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3PNt46aB_sYC&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=%22Packing%20for%20Perth%22%20%22PFP%22&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Packing%20for%20Perth%22%20%22PFP%22&amp;f=true ''Native Vs. Settler: Ethnic Conflict in Israel/Palestine, Northern Ireland, and South Africa''], Thomas G. Mitchell, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2000, page 82&lt;/ref&gt;

The PFP would become the official opposition in the 1977 election, winning 17 seats. Colin Eglin, who had also led the earlier Progressive Party, was initially the leader of the PFP. But over the weekend of 3 September 1979, on the behest of [[Gordon Waddell]], the PFP would hold a special congress in [[Johannesburg]] to elect a new leader, citing such reasons as Eglin's "uninspired" parliamentary performance, which allowed the ruling Nationalists to recover from the [[Muldergate Scandal|Muldergate slush fund scandal]]; his "indiscreet" contacts with black US politicians Don McHenry and Andy Young, whom many South Africans regarded as enemies of the country; and the party's severe defeats in three recent Parliamentary by-elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/121408165/|title=South Africa Opposition Leader falls|last=Alexander|first=Douglas|date=1979-07-31|work=The Age|access-date=2017-05-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederik van Zyl Slabbert]] succeeded Eglin in 1979.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The PFP strengthened its opposition status in 1981 by increasing its representation to 27 seats.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It was ousted as the official opposition by the far-right [[Conservative Party (South Africa)|Conservative Party]] in the whites-only parliamentary elections held on 6 May 1987.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

This electoral blow led many of the PFP's leaders to question the value of participating in the whites-only parliament, and some of its MPs left to form the New Democratic Movement (NDM).{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 1989, the PFP and NDM merged with another small white reformist party, the [[Independent Party (South Africa)|Independent Party]] (IP), to form the [[Democratic Party (South Africa)|Democratic Party]] (DP), predecessor to the modern [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] (DA).{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

'''Public sector consulting''' in the US usually refers to the branch of [[management consulting]] that works with local and federal governments as well as government agencies. Several major management consulting firms (e.g.: [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]], [[Boston Consulting Group|BCG]], [[Booz &amp; Company|Booz&amp;Co]], [[Monitor Group|Monitor]]) do public sector engagements as part of their overall business. The biggest public sector consulting firm in the UK is PA Consulting Group. 

Like management consulting, the goal of public sector consulting is to help organizations improve their performance, primarily through the analysis of existing problems and the development of plans for improvement.

Public sector consulting covers a wide range of areas, including:

* Education
* Defense
* Healthcare
* Environmental policy
* Energy
* Economics &amp; strategic planning
* Technology
* Transportation

Consultants are usually brought in as experts or facilitators on a given project.

{{refimprove|date=January 2016}}
{{Property law}}

'''Real estate''' is "property consisting of land and the buildings on it, along with its [[natural resource]]s such as crops, minerals or water; immovable property of this nature; an interest vested in this (also) an item of real property, (more generally) buildings or housing in general. Also: the business of real estate; the profession of buying, selling, or renting land, buildings, or housing."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Real estate": Oxford English Dictionary online: Retrieved September 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a [[law|legal]] term used in jurisdictions whose legal system is derived from English [[common law]], such as [[India]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Pakistan]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]].

==Residential real estate==
Residential real estate may contain either a single family or multifamily structure that is available for occupation or for non-business purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title 16. Conservation; Chapter 1. National Parks, Military Parks, Monuments, and Seashores; Minute Man National Historical Park|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/r/residential-property/|publisher=US Legal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residences can be classified by and how they are connected to neighbouring residences and land. Different types of housing tenure can be used for the same physical type. For example, connected residences might be owned by a single entity and leased out, or owned separately with an agreement covering the relationship between units and common areas and concerns.

[[File:Townhouses in Victoria Australia.jpg|thumb|A photograph of Townhouses in [[Victoria, Australia]]]] 
;Major categories 
* Attached / multi-unit dwellings
** [[Apartment]] (American English) or [[Apartment|Flat]] (British English) – An individual unit in a multi-unit building. The boundaries of the apartment are generally defined by a perimeter of locked or lockable doors.  Often seen in multi-story [[apartment building]]s.
** [[Multi-family residential|Multi-family house]] – Often seen in multi-story detached buildings, where each floor is a separate apartment or unit.
** [[Terraced house]] (a.&amp;nbsp;k.&amp;nbsp;a. ''townhouse'' or ''rowhouse'') – A number of single or multi-unit buildings in a continuous row with shared walls and no intervening space.
** [[Condominium]] (American English) – A building or complex, similar to apartments, owned by individuals. Common grounds and common areas within the complex are owned and shared jointly. In North America, there are ''townhouse'' or ''rowhouse'' style condominiums as well. The British equivalent is a block of flats.
** [[Cooperative]] (a.&amp;nbsp;k.&amp;nbsp;a. co-op) – A type of multiple ownership in which the residents of a multi-unit housing complex own shares in the cooperative corporation that owns the property, giving each resident the right to occupy a specific apartment or unit.
* [[Semi-detached]] dwellings 
** [[Duplex (building)|Duplex]] – Two units with one shared wall. 
* Detached dwellings
** [[Detached house]] or [[single-family detached house]]
* Portable dwellings
** [[Mobile home]]s or [[residential caravan]]s – A full-time residence that can be (although might not in practice be) movable on wheels.
** [[Houseboat]]s – A floating home 
** [[Tent]]s – Usually temporary, with roof and walls consisting only of fabric-like material.

The size of an apartment or house can be described in square feet or meters. In the United States, this includes the area of "living space", excluding the garage and other non-living spaces. The "square meters" figure of a house in Europe may report the total area of the walls enclosing the home, thus including any attached garage and non-living spaces, which makes it important to inquire what kind of surface area definition has been used. It can be described more roughly by the number of rooms. A [[studio apartment]] has a single bedroom with no living room (possibly a separate kitchen). A one-bedroom apartment has a living or dining room separate from the bedroom. Two bedroom, three bedroom, and larger units are common. (A bedroom is a separate room intended for sleeping.  It commonly contains a bed and, in newer dwelling units, a built-in closet for clothes storage.)

;Other categories
* [[Chawls]]
* [[Villa]]s
* [[Havelis]]

The size of these is measured in Gaz (square yards), Quila, Marla, Beegha, and acre.

See [[List of house types]] for a complete listing of housing types and layouts, [[real estate trends]] for shifts in the market, and [[house]] or [[home]] for more general information.

==Sales and marketing==
It is common practice for an intermediary to provide real estate owners with dedicated sales and marketing support in exchange for [[commission (remuneration)|commission]]. In North America, this intermediary is referred to as a [[real estate broker]] (or realtor), whilst in the United Kingdom, the intermediary would be referred to as an [[estate agent]]. In Australia the intermediary is referred to as a real estate agent or real estate representative or the agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of Terms|url=https://reia.asn.au/consumers/glossary-of-terms/|website=Real Estate Institute of Australia (REIA)|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reality Party Logo.jpg|thumb|The party's logo]]

'''The Reality Party''' was a [[political party]] in the [[United Kingdom]] that was founded in 2014, by [[Bez (dancer)|Mark "Bez" Berry]] and stood three candidates in the 2015 UK general election. The party manifesto was a [[centre-left]] anti-[[austerity]] programme&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/03/happy-mondays-star-bez-revolution-standing-salford-and-why-he-didnt-join-greens&lt;/ref&gt; which includes policies against [[privatisation]], [[Tuition fees in the United Kingdom|tuition fees]] and [[tax avoidance]] and in favour of [[renationalisation]], [[progressive taxation]], [[rent controls]], [[Social housing|socially-managed housing]] and [[participatory democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.realitypartysalford.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was deregistered in November, 2016&lt;ref&gt;http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/English/Registrations/PP2595&lt;/ref&gt; and its website no longer functions&lt;ref&gt;http://www.realitypartysalford.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Election campaign ==
In 2014 [[Channel 4]] produced a documentary series following Berry's political campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/24-hour-party-politics/4od|title=24 Hour Party Politics - My Friends Are Squashed|publisher=Channel 4|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reality party toured [[South Thanet]] in a green vintage bus in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentnews.co.uk/news/new_political_party_set_for_ramsgate_launch_this_weekend_1_3838844|title=New political party set for Ramsgate launch this weekend|publisher=Kent News|author=Jamie Weir|date=7 November 2014|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, the Reality Party was deregistered by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] for having a name that was too similar to that of the Realists' Party. Its founder had been given several written warnings that a name change was required, and was removed from the register in January when it had failed to comply.&lt;ref name="Ind"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallagher|first1=Paul|title=Happy Mondays' Bez forgets to register his 'Reality Party' with the Electoral Commission|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/happy-mondays-bez-forgets-to-register-his-reality-party-with-the-electoral-commission-9976008.html|accessdate=14 January 2015|work=[[The Independent]]|date=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 February 2015 the party re-registered as "We Are The Reality Party".&lt;ref name="pefonline.electoralcommission.org.uk"/&gt; They were also permitted to use the description "The Reality Party It's Your Reality" on ballot papers.&lt;ref name="pefonline.electoralcommission.org.uk"&gt;https://pefonline.electoralcommission.org.uk/Search/ViewRegistrations/Profile.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parliamentary candidates ==
[[File:Reality Party Bus.jpg|thumb|The Reality campaign bus]]
The party stood three candidates in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], after some ambiguity over which seats they intended to contest.&lt;ref name="Ind"/&gt;

* Mark "Bez" Berry stood for [[Salford and Eccles (UK Parliament constituency)|Salford and Eccles]] and gained 703 votes, higher than fellow anti-austerity party [[Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition]].
* Nigel Askew stood for [[South Thanet (UK Parliament constituency)|South Thanet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastkentrealityparty.co.uk|title=East Kent Reality Party {{!}} It's Real &amp;ndash; It's Your Reality|publisher=East Kent Reality Party|author=Nigel Askew|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Nigel Farage]] (leader of UKIP) was also standing, and gained 126 votes. He referred to his campaign as "The Battle of the Nigels" and also referred to himself as "the real pub landlord" highlighting another adversary, [[Al Murray]]. Both Farage and Murray beat him in the election,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thanetgazette.co.uk/Bez-town-Realist-Party-candidate/story-23003391-detail/story.html|title=Reality Party candidate promises South Thanet 'battle of the Nigels'|publisher=Thanet Gazette|author=Tom Barnes|date=26 September 2014|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but finished behind [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate [[Craig Mackinlay]].
* Mags McNally was the candidate for [[Worsley and Eccles South (UK Parliament constituency)|Worsley and Eccles South]], gaining 200 votes.

'''Riksdag of the Estates''' (formally {{lang-sv|Riksens ständer}}; informally {{lang-sv|Ståndsriksdagen}}) was the name used for the Estates of [[Sweden]] when they were assembled. Until its dissolution in 1866, the institution was the highest authority in [[Sweden]] next to the [[King of Sweden|King]]. It was a [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] made up of the [[estates of the realm|Four Estates]], which historically were the lines of division in Swedish society:

* [[Swedish nobility|Nobility]]
* [[Estate of Swedish Clergy|Clergy]]
* [[Bourgeoisie|Burghers]]
* [[Estate of Swedish Peasants|Peasants]]

==Important assemblies==
[[Image:SEK 5 1959.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Representatives of the four estates on a commemorative coin (reverse).]]
[[Image:Riddarhuset.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Swedish House of Nobility|House of Nobility]], seat of the [[Swedish nobility]].]]

The meeting at [[Arboga]] in 1435 is usually considered to be the first Riksdag, but there is no indication that the fourth estate, the peasants, had been represented there{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.

* The actual first meeting is likely the one that took place at [[Uppsala]] in 1436 after the death of rebel leader [[Engelbrekt]].

* At [[Västerås]] in 1527 [[Lutheranism]] was adopted as the new state religion instead of [[Roman Catholicism]].
* At [[Arboga]] in 1561, the term ''Riksdag'' was used for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eriksson |first=Bo |title=Lützen 1632: ett ödesdigert beslut |edition=New |year=2007 |publisher=Norstedt |location=Stockholm |language=Swedish |isbn=9789172637900 |id={{LIBRIS|10478413}} |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At [[Söderköping]] in 1595, [[Charles IX of Sweden|duke Charles]] was elected regent of Sweden instead of king [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund]], who was a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and the king of both Sweden and [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]].

* In 1809, the Riksdag elected [[Charles XIII of Sweden|Charles XIII]] king after his nephew [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav IV Adolf]] had been deposed, and after the new king had accepted a new [[Constitution of Sweden|constitution]] that ended Sweden's second Autocracy (1789–1809).
* At the sessions in 1634, 1719, 1720, 1772 and 1809 new constitutions were adopted.

== Replaced by the new Riksdag ==
The [[Instrument of Government (1809)|constitution of 1809]] divided the powers of government between the monarch and the Riksdag of the Estates, and after 1866 between the monarch and the new [[Riksdag]]. In 1866 all the Estates voted in favor of dissolution and at the same time to constitute a new assembly, [[Riksdag|''Sveriges Riksdag'']]. The four former estates were abolished. The [[Swedish House of Nobility|House of Nobility]] ({{lang-sv|Riddarhuset}}) remains as a quasi-official representation of the [[Swedish nobility]]. The modern [[Centre Party (Sweden)|Centre Party]] which grew out of the Swedish farmers' movement, could be construed as a modern representation with a traditional bond to the Estate of the Peasants.

== Riksdag in Finland ==
{{Main|Diet of Finland}}

Following the [[Finnish War]] in 1809, Sweden ceded its eastmost provinces to the [[Russian Empire]]. Comprising much of present-day Finland, these became a [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Grand Duchy]] under the [[Emperor of Russia|Emperor]], but the political institutions were kept practically intact. The Finnish estates [[Diet of Porvoo|assembled in 1809 at Porvoo]] to confirm the change in their allegiance. This [[Diet of Finland]] followed the forms of the Swedish Riksdag, being the legislative body of the new autonomous region. However, during the reigns of [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] and [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] it was not assembled and no new legislation was enacted. The diet was next assembled by tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] in 1863, due to the need to modernize the laws. After this the Diet met regularly until 1905, when it passed an act forming a new unicameral parliament. That assembly has been Finland's legislative body since then. The [[Finnish House of Nobility]] ({{lang-fi|Ritarihuone}}; {{lang-sv|Riddarhuset}}) carries on the tradition of the Estate of Nobility, but no new families have been ennobled since 1906.

'''River basin management plans''' are a management tool in [[integrated water resources management]]. They generally contain descriptions of the [[water resources]] in a [[drainage basin]] and water allocation plans.

==Europe==
River Basin Management Plans are a requirement of the [[Water Framework Directive]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Water Framework Directive: A New Directive for a Changing Social, Political and Economic European Framework|publisher=European Planning Studies - www.informaworld.com|url= http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09654310303640|accessdate=2008-03-23|doi=10.1080/09654310303640}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a means of achieving the protection, improvement and sustainable use of the water environment across Europe. This includes surface freshwaters (including lakes, streams and rivers), groundwater, ecosystems such as some wetlands that depend on groundwater, estuaries and coastal waters out to one nautical mile.

The Directive requires [[Member state of the European Union|member states]] to aim to achieve at least ''good status'' in each [[water body]] within their [[river basin districts]]. Each member state must produce a plan for each of the river basin districts within its territory.

Plans must include: objectives for each water body; reasons for not achieving objectives where relevant; and the programme of actions required to meet the objectives.

River Basin Management Plans were published for several member states in December 2010.

==River basin management in a changing climate - a Guidance document==
In November 2009, Water Directors of EU Member States issued a guidance document on adaptation to climate change in water management. The document is the first result of numerous actions included in the European Commission White Paper ''Adapting to climate change; Towards a European framework for action''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adapting to climate change; Towards a European framework for action|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0147:FIN:EN:pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document includes guidance on how to take climate change into account in the implementation of the Water Framework Directive, the [[Floods Directive]] and the Strategy on [[water scarcity|Water Scarcity]] and [[Drought]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/quantity/scarcity_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SEALDs''', short for {{nihongo|'''Students Emergency Action for Liberal Democracy'''|自由と民主主義のための学生緊急行動|Jiyū to minshu shugi no tame no gakusei kinkyū kōdō}}, was a [[student activism|student activist]] organisation in [[Japan]] that organised protests against the ruling coalition headed by [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Shinzō Abe]] in 2015 and 2016. Its focus was on the [[2015 Japanese military legislation|security-related bills]] enacted in 2015 that allow the [[Japanese Self-Defense Force]] to be deployed overseas.

Most of the core members of the SEALDs were involved with a predecessor movement, Students Against Secret Protection Law (SASPL), that protested against Shinzo Abe's [[Special Secrecy Law]] from February to December 2014.&lt;ref name="kingston"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kingston|first1=Jeff|title=SEALDs: Students Slam Abe’s Assault on Japan’s Constitution|journal=[[The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus|The Asia-Pacific Journal]]|date=7 September 2015|volume=13|issue=36, No. 1|url=http://www.japanfocus.org/-Jeff-Kingston/4371/article.html|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the secrecy law was passed, the members went on to form SEALDs on May 3, 2015, [[Constitution Memorial Day]] in Japan, to highlight what they believed was Shinzo Abe's blatant disregard of the Constitution. They were especially worried that the Abe cabinet, which enjoyed a majority in both Houses of the Japanese Parliament, would railroad their legislation to reinterpret [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution]], allowing Japan to exercise the right of collective self-defence and potentially deploy troops on foreign soil.&lt;ref name="kingston" /&gt; ([[2015 Japanese military legislation|Such legislation]] was passed on September 19, 2015.)

On August 30, 2015, the SEALDs was among protesters who surrounded the [[National Diet Building]] in Tokyo. Estimates of the size of the crowd ranged from 30,000 to 120,000.&lt;ref name="dw"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a large student movement had not emerged in Japan since the anti-war protests of the 1960s, which forced Shinzo Abe's grandfather [[Nobusuke Kishi]] to resign as Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="dw" /&gt; However, in contrast to the [[Zengakuren]], whose radicalism eventually alienated the public in the 1960s, the SEALDs attempted to be moderate and non-partisan.&lt;ref name="kingston" /&gt;

Branches of SEALDs sprang up in various places around Japan. SEALDs KANSAI was established in May 2015, SEALDs TOHOKU on July 20, SEALDs RYUKYU in Okinawa on August 15, and SEALDs TOKAI in Nagoya on September 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=SEALDs: This is What Democracy Looks Like|last=SEALDs|first=|publisher=Ootsukishoten|year=2015|isbn=978-4-272-33086-7|location=Tokyo|pages=78–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The security laws were enacted on March 29, 2016. SEALDs organised a protest in front of the Parliament building the day before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20160329/p2a/00m/0na/009000c|title=Student Group Holds Protest Against Security Laws Ahead of March 29 Enforcement - The Mainichi|website=The Mainichi|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

SEALDs' activities ranged from holding demonstrations, protest rallies and marches, organizing study groups and talk events, to creating booklets, pamphlets and videos, using social media. They also moved around the country to support various movements and candidates, such as the protests in Okinawa against the US military base and the Hokkaido by-elections in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/articles/20160421/ddr/041/010/004000c|title=衆院選：北海道５区補選　ＳＮＳ駆使し若者にアピール　「１８歳以上」見据え両陣営掘り起こし - 毎日新聞|website=毎日新聞|language=ja-JP|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SEALDs disbanded on August 15, 2016, one month after the ruling [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] won a supermajority in the [[Japanese House of Councillors election, 2016|Upper House election]]. However, co-founder Aki Okuda (奥田愛基) stated that the campaign was not over and urged all of Japan's politicians to continue to protect the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/08/14/national/politics-diplomacy/sealds-disband-founder-says-just-beginning/#.V7PCMJgrLIU/|title=SEALDs Disbands, Founder Says Political Activism Just Beginning|date=2016-08-14|newspaper=Japan Times Online|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9534">[[File:Family eating lunch.jpg|thumb|A family eating a meal]]
People from different '''[[social class]]es''' eat different '''[[food]]s'''. Not all foods are available to everyone.  People start to learn to like foods that are appropriate to their class while they are children. Based on the food that people decide to consume, their social class position is often revealed.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deeming|first=Christopher|year=2013|title=The choice of the necessary: class, tastes and lifestyles|journal=The International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy|volume=34.7/8|pages=438–454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People from the middle classes generally enjoy healthier diets than their lower class counterparts.{{r|hupkens}} Part of the explanation for this is that middle-class parents tend to be less permissive in their food choices, are less concerned with the cost of food products, and are more attuned to issues of health.{{r|hupkens}} However, permissiveness, health and cost considerations are insufficient to account for the social class variation in food consumption.{{r|hupkens}}

The significance of a food surplus in class demarcation ought to be highlighted in this section. In antiquity, those (typically upper classes) hoarding a sizeable surplus of harvests were granted experimental agencies leading to the development of elite cuisines. This principle may be contextualized by food historian Rachel Laudan’s assertion that “the humble, constantly at risk of real hunger, had every reason not to experiment with innovative cooking techniques” due to a scarce reserve of harvests.&lt;ref&gt;Laudan, Rachel. Cuisine and Empire: Cooking In World History. Berkeley, University of California Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Social class differences in food consumption are not necessarily static. A study of Finnish consumption patterns for the period from 1979 to 1990 found that across all classes the consumption of butter, high-fat milk, coffee and sugar had decreased and the consumption of vegetables had increased. From the mid-1980s, social class differences in food consumption had diminished with the lower social classes following consumption patterns established by the upper classes.{{r|finnish}}

== Pierre Bourdieu ==
Author of ''[[Distinction (1979 book)|Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste]],'' French sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] wrote extensively on how people of different social classes (specifically the working class) choose what they eat. According to Bourdieu, there isn't much of a choice when it comes to food regarding the working class.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The middle class decides which foods are "good" and "bad", which in turn influences what the working class consumes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While the middle class can afford to eat whatever they'd like, the working class simply has a "taste for necessity" and eats what they can afford.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Food deserts==
A [[food desert]] is a geographical area that lacks adequate grocery stores or markets that provide fresh and nutritious foods that are financially accessible to the people within the area.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bedore|first=Melanie|title=Food Desertification: Situating Choice and Class Relations within an Urban Political Economy of Declining Food Access|journal=Studies in Social Justice|volume=8.2|pages=207–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food deserts are often found in lower income neighborhoods, which in turn limits the availability of higher quality foods to residents of these neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since the residents of these areas are not able to consistently shop for groceries within a reasonable distance from where they reside, this results in their regular consumption of foods considered unsuitable for maintaining a healthy and nutritious diet (i.e. fast food or food from convenience stores).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== In the United States ==
[[File:Whataburger hamburger and fries.jpg|thumb|Cheeseburger (fast food)]]
People tend to define types of foods as belonging to a certain class based on how expensive (or inexpensive) they are.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Wynne|last2=Ransom|first2=Elizabeth|title=STRATIFICATION ON THE MENU: USING RESTAURANT MENUS TO EXAMINE SOCIAL CLASS|journal=Teaching Sociology|volume=33.3|pages=310–316}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study done on students who were asked to categorize restaurant menu items into each of the different social classes, students considered cheap, simple meals lower-class while meals that were much more expensive and came with a choice of wine were considered upper-class.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Since the early 2000s, restaurants and fast-food chains have been incorporating [[gourmet]] hamburgers into their menus which often consist of high-end or exotic ingredients.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caldwell|first=Mark|title=The Rise of the Gourmet Hamburger|journal=Contexts|volume=13.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; While people of all social classes have access to fast-food restaurants that sell "better burgers" (which are burgers that are considered to be of greater quality than the traditional burger), some restaurants sell expensive burgers that are exclusive to those who can afford them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==In Canada==
[[File:Macaroni and cheese.jpg|thumb|Kraft macaroni and cheese]]
Food-secure Canadians perceive [[Kraft Dinner]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s as comforting while food insecure Canadians find it discomforting.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rock|first=Melanie|last2=Mcintyre|first2=Lynn|last3=Rondeau|first3=Krista|title=Discomforting Comfort Foods: Stirring Pots on Kraft Dinner and Social Inequality in Canada|journal=Agriculture and Human Values|volume=26.3|pages=167–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the fact that the food-secure Canadians can afford to eat meals other than those made by Kraft, while food-insecure Canadians have very few options. Furthermore, Kraft meal kits are often found at food banks and charities which contributes to the reason why food-insecure people who visit these places find them undesirable.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The '''People's Party''' or '''Socialist People's Party''' was a minor [[political party]] in the [[Furness]] region of [[England]].

The party was founded in 1995 by four [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] borough councillors who had been suspended from Labour for opposing a reduction in the [[House|housing]] [[budget]]. It was initially known as the '''People's Labour Party''', and stood their chair, Jim Hamezeian, in the [[Barrow and Furness (UK Parliament constituency)|Barrow and Furness]] constituency in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]]. He received 1,995 votes, 4.1% of the total in the constituency.

The party campaigned on a variety of local issues. A split led to two of its four councillors leaving and standing as [[independent (politician)|independents]] in the [[Barrow-in-Furness Council election, 2003|2003 local elections]]; the two People's Party councillors then lost their seats. However, in the [[Barrow-in-Furness Council election, 2006|2006 local elections]], party leader Jim Hamezian regained his seat in the [[Ormsgill]] ward.

In the [[Barrow-in-Furness Council election, 2008|2008 local elections]], one councillor was elected in Central Ward and three others elected in Ormsgill. Following this, in elections to [[Cumbria County Council]] in 2009, Jim Hamezeian was elected to serve for Ormsgill ward in Barrow-in-Furness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cumbria.gov.uk/election2009/results/text/division.asp?division=Ormsgill&amp;district=Barrow|title= Cumbria County Council website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After that, the party's support dropped: in the [[Barrow-in-Furness Council election, 2010|2010 local elections]] the SPP lost two councillors, and lost all representation on the Borough council in [[Barrow-in-Furness Council election, 2011|2011 local elections]]. The SPP retained one councillor on [[Cumbria County Council]] until the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2013|May 2013 elections]], when they lost all representation. The party deregistered with the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] in 2015 and its website is no longer active.

The '''Student Government Program''' (SGP) is the Philippines' program for pupil governments in elementary schools student governments in secondary schools of the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]], under the Office of the Undersecretary for Regional Operations. It is the foremost co-curricular student organization authorized to implement pertinent programs, projects, and activities in Philippine schools as mandated by the Department of Education.

The Philippines has a complex student union with different names such as ''student government'', the term used in all public secondary schools and some of the universities and/or colleges and ''student council'' for most of the colleges/universities.

==History==
The Center for Students and Co-Curricular Affairs (CSCA) was established in 1996 in order to further facilitate co-curricular work of student councils in the country and mold them to be better leaders.
In 2003, the Supreme Student Governments were institutionalized starting with the establishment of the National Federation of Supreme Student Governments (NFSSG) with David Maulas of Bohol as its first National Federation President elected during the 1st National Leadership Training for Student Government Officers (NLTSGO). An institutionalized Constitution and By Laws of the Supreme Student Governments were enforced through a Department Order No. 43, s. 2005, then revised in 2009 as per Department Order No. 79, s. 2009. The last set of National Federation officers were elected September 2012 with Raja Barber of Oriental Mindoro as the last National Federation President.
In 2014, through Department Order No. 47, s. 2014 the Constitution and By-Laws of Supreme Pupil Governments in elementary schools and Supreme Student Governments in secondary schools around the country were unified. This marks the year where the Supreme Pupil Governments are institutionalized.
Currently the program is now under the Office of the Undersecretary for Regional Operations.

The '''Syrian Revolution Network''' ({{lang-ar|شبكة الثورة السورية}}), originally called the '''Syrian Revolution 2011''' and the '''Syrian Days of Rage''', is a [[Syrian opposition]] [[activist organization]] active in the [[Syrian Civil War]]. It was originally a [[Facebook page]] created by [[Fida al-Sayed]], a [[Sweden|Swedish]] activist living in [[Eskilstuna]],&lt;ref name=fida/&gt; during the [[Arab Spring]] in the beginning of 2011.&lt;ref name=restores&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/10syria.html?mcubz=3|title=Syria Restores Access to Facebook and YouTube|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Jennifer Preston|date=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 2011, it was considered the most influential Syrian activist organization in the mobilization of protesters against the [[Syrian government]] during the [[civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian uprising]].&lt;ref name=fida/&gt;

==History==
===Creation===
In January 2011, during the [[Arab Spring]] and the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Egyptian Revolution]], [[Fida al-Sayed]], together with his two younger brothers Mustafa and Yasir, created the page '''"Syrian Revolution"''' on [[Facebook]].&lt;ref name="svt"&gt;{{cite news|title=Om oroligheterna i Syrien |url=http://svtplay.se/v/2493118/gomorron_sverige/om_oroligheterna_i_syrien |publisher=[[Sveriges Television|SVT]] |date=2 August 2011 |accessdate=28 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326175244/http://svtplay.se/v/2493118/gomorron_sverige/om_oroligheterna_i_syrien |archivedate=26 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By February, the page gained more than 16,000 followers. It began to call for a "day of rage" in Syria against the government of [[Bashar al-Assad]], but was initially not able to mobilize protests in Syria.&lt;ref name=restores/&gt;

In an interview on [[Nyhetsmorgon]] at [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]], Fida explained that when he started the page before the "revolution," people laughed at him and said that there will never be an uprising in Syria, while others supported the initiative. He pointed several times that it is a peaceful movement for [[freedom]] and [[democracy]]. He said that they did not have to do any marketing for the page, as the situation in Syria was marketing itself. He said he no longer administrated the page alone, he only founded it, and he now has the help of hundreds of [[Syrians|young people in Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nyhetsmorgon - Så påverkar revolutionen i Libyen upproret i Syrien |url=http://www.tv4play.se/nyheter_och_debatt/nyhetsmorgon?title=sa_paverkar_revolutionen_i_libyen_upproret_i_syrien&amp;videoid=1946736 |publisher=[[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]] |date=24 August 2011 |accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginning of the Syrian uprising===
{{see|Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War}}
On 15 March 2011, around 200 protesters gathered in [[Damascus]] to demand reforms and the end to the [[state of emergency]] in Syria. The Syrian Revolution 2011 Facebook page, then with more than 41,000 followers, called for the protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/syria-revolution-revolt-against-bashar-al--assads-regime/2011/03/15/ABrwNEX_blog.html|title=Syria revolution: A revolt brews against Bashar al- Assad’s regime|work=[[The Washington Post]]|author=Elizabeth Flock|date=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12749674|title=Mid-East unrest: Syrian protests in Damascus and Aleppo|work=[[BBC]]|date=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March 2011, the Syrian Revolution 2011 Facebook page called for a "Day of Dignity" in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Iddon|first=Paul|title=A recap of the Syrian crisis to date|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/329590|accessdate=20 September 2013|work=Digital Journal|date=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Islamic [[Jumu'ah|Friday prayers]], thousands of protesters gathered in 4 cities, notably in [[Siege of Daraa|Daraa]], and called for freedom and democracy and against [[corruption]]. Government forces violently suppressed all of the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Syria, Crackdown After Protests|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/19/world/middleeast/19syria.html?_r=0|accessdate=28 February 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC55uPBKYqU |title=Violence flares at Syrian protest |publisher=Youtube/Al Jazeera (video)|date=18 March 2011|accessdate=28 January 2014| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, the Syrian Revolution 2011 Facebook page had more than 120,000 followers. It once again called for Syrians to take to the streets for Friday protests in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-13168276|title=Syria's spontaneously organised protests|work=BBC|author=Kim Ghattas|date=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May, the Facebook page, which had more than 180,000 followers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/world/middleeast/23facebook.html?mcubz=3|title=Seeking to Disrupt Protesters, Syria Cracks Down on Social Media|work=The New York Times|author=Jennifer Preston|date=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; transformed into a wider network with more than 250,000 members in more than 8 [[social media]] sites. The Syrian Revolution Network became the most influential Syrian opposition organization, influencing and mobilizing thousands of protesters against the Syrian government.&lt;ref name=fida/&gt; 

In July 2011, [[BBC Arabic]] showed in a special report how Fida run the page from his apartment in [[Eskilstuna]]. Fida explained that 75% of the administrators who ran the site were from within Syria. Fida also told that it is a difficult process before a video is approved and posted on the site: the event must have been filmed and sent by various independent sources, even sometimes needed to be confirmed by filming the date on a local newspaper, or that some of the protesters show big signs where you can clearly see the week's campaign name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=حصريا : أحمد الشيخ في غرفة عمليات الثورة السورية |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kqiY0u53M4&amp;feature=related |publisher=[[BBC Arabic]] |date=6 July 2011 |accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Escalation and civil war===
One of the key media activists affiliated with the Syrian Revolution Network is Moaz al-Shami.&lt;ref name=voa/&gt; Moaz al-Shami was from [[Damascus]],&lt;ref name=hts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eldorar.com/node/108527|title=Supporters of the Sham Liberation Organization are raising a banner in a controversial demonstration|work=Al-Dorar al-Shamia|date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the first 3 years of the [[Syrian Civil War]], he mainly operated in and around Damascus. Battles of the war he covered in Damascus included the [[Rif Dimashq offensive (November 2012–February 2013)|Damascus offensive of November 2012]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/11/201211391048764834.html|title='Heavy fighting' at Syria's Taftanaz airbase|work=[[Al Jazeera English]]|date=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Damascus offensive (2013)|Damascus offensive of February 2013]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-crisis-idUSBRE91I0GK20130220|title=Syria "Scud-type" missile said to kill 20 in Aleppo|work=[[Reuters]]|author=Khaled Yacoub Oweis|date=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, [[Reuters]] considered Moaz al-Shami to be one of the leading opposition activists in Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-syria-crisis-alkhatib-idUKBRE92N07A20130324|title=Syrian opposition leader Alkhatib resigns|work=Reuters|author=Omar Fahmy and Khaled Yacoub Oweis|date=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time later in the war, Moaz al-Shami moved to the [[Idlib Governorate]] in northwestern Syria, where he currently operates. Since September 2015, he covered the [[Russian military intervention in Syria]], including the bombing of [[Aleppo]] and [[Idlib]] by the [[Russian Air Force]].&lt;ref name=free&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almodon.com/media/2016/12/6/%D8%A5%D8%AF%D9%84%D8%A8-%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%B4-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%AD-%D9%8A%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%82-%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%B7-%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%B0-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%8A|title=Idlib: "the army of conquest" free activist Moaz Shami|work=Al-Modon|date=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 7 March 2016, while he was covering [[Syrian protests (March–April 2016)|protests]] in rebel-held towns in Idlib, Moaz was arrested by [[al-Qaeda]]'s [[al-Nusra Front]], part of the [[Army of Conquest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zaitonmag.com/?p=8841|title=Front of victory dispersed a demonstration against the regime and arrest activists in the countryside Idlib|work=Zaiton Mag|date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 December 2016, he was once again arrested by the Army of Conquest after disputes with an Army of Conquest [[Sharia]] judge in Idlib, but was soon released after.&lt;ref name=free/&gt;

In the beginning of 2017, Moaz al-Shami covered the rise of [[Tahrir al-Sham]] in Idlib.&lt;ref name=hts/&gt; On 4 April 2017, he recorded photographs and videos of the [[Khan Shaykhun chemical attack]] and its aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.band.uol.com.br/mundo/noticia/100000853043/jornalista-sirio-que-cobriu-ataque-quimico-faz-apelo.html|title=Syrian journalist who covered chemical attack in the country hopes that images touch the world|work=Band.com.br|date=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures''' ('''TTPs''') is an essential concept in [[terrorism]] and [[cyber security]] studies.&lt;ref name=Sullivan2008/&gt;

The role of TTPs in terrorism analysis is to identify individual [[behavioral pattern|patterns of behavior]] of a particular terrorist activity, or a particular terrorist organisation, and to examine and categorize more general tactics and weapons used by a particular terrorist activity, or a particular terrorist organisation.

== Requirement to identify individual terrorism TTPs ==
The current approach to terrorism analysis involves an examination of individual terrorist, or terrorist organisations use of particular weapons, used in specific ways, and different tactics and strategies being exhibited.&lt;ref name=Sullivan2008/&gt; Broadly, a wide range of TTPs have been exhibited historically by individual terrorist, or terrorist organisations worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, C. (2012) Dangerous Minds: Attps://eccp.poste.dككك Monograph on the Relationship Between Beliefs –Behaviours – Tactics. Published by OODA LOOP (7 September 2012).URL: http://www.oodaloop.com/security/2012/09/07/dangerous-minds-the-relationship-between-beliefs-behaviors-and-tactics/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key concepts ==

=== Evolution of TTPs ===
All terrorists, or terrorist organisations, worldwide historically have exhibited an evolution in TTPs. This can be as a result of:
* changing circumstances;
* resource availability; or,
* changing ideologies, or 'war-focus'.
In the case of the [[Taliban]], their tactics have consisted primarily of guerrilla-style [[improvised explosive device]] (IED) attacks and small-arms ambushes against international and state-level security forces and interests, such as police checkpoints and military supply convoys. However, more recently Taliban TTPs have expanded to include mass casualty attacks by [[ suicide bombers ]] and other suicide attacks in order to undermine the current government.

=== Kill-chain model ===
[[File:Flaherty Model of Terrorism Analysis Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures Kill Chain Model.jpg|thumb|right|The kill-chain model, and kill-chain model variations]]
The [[kill chain|kill-chain]] model (KCM) is a conceptual tool used in terrorism analysis and studies.&lt;ref name=Sullivan2008&gt;
Sullivan, J.P., Bauer, A. eds (2008). 
[http://file.lacounty.gov/lasd/cms1_144939.pdf Terrorism Early Warning: 10 Years of Achievement in Fighting Terrorism and Crime]. 
Los Angeles, CA: Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department.&lt;/ref&gt; All terrorists' or terrorist organisations' TTPs form part of understanding the terrorist kill chain, which is the pattern of transactional activities, link together in order for a terrorist act to take place. Broadly, this involves describing the 'hierarchy of tasks and sub-tasks that may be involved in the execution', or in making a terrorist act happen.&lt;ref name=Sullivan2008/&gt; These can include the arrangement and sequence of activities a terrorist or terrorist organisation uses in planning, organizing, mobilizing, training, equipping and staging resources and operatives. These activities make up the terrorist or terrorist organisations' modus operandi or 'attack system'.&lt;ref name=Sullivan2008/&gt;
Four sets of steps make-up the full KCM:
* The first set of activities are the 'attack preparation steps'. In terms of terrorism analysis, individual transactions, such as acquiring finances, acquiring expertise, acquiring materiel, munitions or capability, recruiting members, conducting [[reconnaissance]], mission rehearsal, conducting an attack, have signatures that identify them as terrorist or criminal acts or are consistent with the operations of a specific individual, cell or group.
* The second set of activities are called the 'execution timeline'. This identifies the timeline, along which the terrorist, or terrorist organisations various activities, leading up to an attack process flows time-wise.
* The third set of activities is identified as 'targeting'. An individual or group would carry out some form of dedicated reconnaissance with the aim of identifying weaknesses in the site or operation; and with that information determine the best method of attack.
* The fourth set of activities is identified as the 'planning stages'. These involve some type of planning activity embedded into the ‘kill chain’, and is part of the process of organizing, mobilizing, training, equipping, staging, collecting resources and operatives. These make up the terrorist or terrorist organisations’ [[modus operandi]], or its system of attack.

The KCM “sequence of activities”&lt;ref name=Sullivan2008/&gt; is not linear, but discontinuous. Three additional KCM scenarios can be identified:&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, C. (2012) Dangerous Minds: A Monograph on the Relationship Between Beliefs –Behaviours – Tactics. Published by OODA LOOP (7 September 2012).URL: http://www.oodaloop.com/security/2012/09/07/dangerous-minds-the-relationship-between-beliefs-behaviors-and-tactics/&lt;/ref&gt;
* An individual or group actively promote a terrorist/extremist ideology on the internet, in books, pamphlets, etc. This is then picked up by another terrorist, or terrorist organisations, who then act on this.
* Two or more parallel kill chain sequence of activities (by various individuals/groups) which are only indirectly connected by intermediary individuals/groups. Sharing similar beliefs, but as well cross over into complementary beliefs/ideologies. Many such intermediaries can operate in this space, passing ideas and resources, even recruits between the various terrorist, or terrorist organisations, groups and cells.
* A terrorist or terrorist organisations picks up ideas, knowledge, etc., and jump-start into various places along the ‘standard’ concept of the KCM.

== Transfer of Terrorist Tactics, Techniques and Procedures ==
Terrorist TTPs are often transferred between various terrorists, or terrorist organisations, and they often learn from each other.&lt;ref&gt;Hedges, M. Karasik, T. Evolving Terrorist Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) Migration Across South Asia, Caucasus, and the Middle East. INEGMA Special Report No. 7. URL: {{cite web |url=http://terror-mirror.com/books/etrrep014.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904024306/http://terror-mirror.com/books/etrrep014.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree to which the transfer of TTPs occurs depends on their relative success when transferred to a different conflict, and a different environment.
The similarities in TTPs between various terrorists, or terrorist organisations, across conflicts and periods suggest a transfer of information.
* [[Explicit knowledge|Explicit Knowledge]]: This is the [[ theory | theoretical ]] information which is often stored in hard copies, such as textbooks, manuals and on computers through [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] and video files. These are extremely easy to get hold of, but without the appropriate teaching or experience, this easy access information is commonly not effectively used.
* Tactical Knowledge: Most commonly taught or learnt through experience and hands on teaching. This requires training establishments to be organised. For terrorists, or terrorist organisations, acquiring this information is harder, and more difficult; however, it is seen as a more effective transfer of knowledge.

== Key tactical concepts related to TTPs ==
Several key tactical concepts can be related to TTPs, which are typically used in [[terrorism]] or [[insurgency]] operations.

'''"The rich get richer and the poor get poorer"''' is an [[aphorism]] due to [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]. In ''[[A Defence of Poetry]] (''1821, not published until 1840) Shelley remarked that [[Utilitarianism|the promoters of utility]] had

: exemplified the saying, “To him that hath, more shall be given; and from him that hath not, the little that he hath shall be taken away.” The rich have become richer, and the poor have become poorer; and the vessel of the State is driven [[Between Scylla and Charybdis|between the Scylla and Charybdis]] of anarchy and despotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Defence of Poetry (from the Harvard Classics: English Essays: Sidney to Macaulay|last=Shelley|first=Percy Bysshe|publisher=Bartleby.com|year=1909–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"To him that hath" ''etc''. is a reference to Matthew 25:29 (the [[Parable of the talents or minas|parable of the talents]], see also [[Matthew effect]]). The aphorism is commonly evoked, with variations in wording, as a synopsis of the effect of [[free market]] [[capitalism]] producing [[Economic inequality|inequality]].

==Predecessors==
[[Andrew Jackson]], the seventh President of the U.S. (1829–1837), in his 1832 [[Second Bank of the United States|bank veto]], said that
: when the laws undertake... to make the rich richer and the potent more powerful, the humble members of society... have a right to complain of the injustice to their Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Andrew Jackson V. Henry Clay: Democracy and Development in Antebellum America|last=Watson|first=Harry L.|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=1998|isbn=0-312-17772-0}} [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0312177720/?keywords=%22rich+richer%22&amp;v=search-inside]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{gutenberg|no=10858 |name=A Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents,  Vol. 2, Part 3, Andrew Jackson, 1st term}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase also resembles two [[Bible]] verses from the [[Gospel of Matthew]]:
: For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Matthew|13:12|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Matthew|25:29|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Ain't We Got Fun"==
The phrase was popularized in 1921 in the wildly successful song "[[Ain't We Got Fun]]?", and the phrase is sometimes attributed to the song's lyricists, [[Gus Kahn]] and [[Raymond B. Egan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://everything2.net/index.pl?node_id=1101156 |title = Ain't We Got Fun |accessdate = 2006-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.geocities.com/dferg5493/aintwegotfun.htm |title = Ain't We Got Fun |publisher = Don Ferguson |accessdate = 2006-08-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041210204617/http://www.geocities.com/dferg5493/aintwegotfun.htm |archivedate = 2004-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The line is sometimes mistakenly attributed to [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]. It appears in ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', as 
: the rich get richer and the poor get&amp;mdash;children!
The character Gatsby orders the character Klipspringer, sitting at the piano, "Don't talk so much, old sport... Play!" and Klipspringer breaks into the Whiting, Kahn and Egan song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great Gatsby|last=Fitzgerald|first=F. Scott|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=0-19-283269-7|origyear=1921}} [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0192832697&amp;id=ZMQv026FgT8C&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;sig=TXJ-bqB-iGfrDrPn5AaxBl7Z7fc p. 76]; also at Project Gutenberg of Australia [http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200041.txt]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In economics==
[[Thomas Piketty]]'s book ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'' (2014) presents a body of empirical data spanning several hundred years that supports his central thesis that the owners of capital accumulate wealth more quickly than those who provide labour, a phenomenon widely described with the term "the rich-get-richer".&lt;ref&gt;https://newrepublic.com/article/117429/capital-twenty-first-century-thomas-piketty-reviewed&lt;/ref&gt;

== In modern politics ==
In the United States, the phrase has been used frequently to describe socioeconomic trends under the [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]] presidencies,&lt;ref&gt;[[James K. Galbraith]]. "[http://archive.salon.com/opinion/feature/2004/06/08/reaganomics/index_np.html The rich got richer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929143539/http://archive.salon.com/opinion/feature/2004/06/08/reaganomics/index_np.html |date=2007-09-29 }}."

That is the Liberal policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = HC S: [Confidence in Her Majesty's Government] |url = http://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/108256 |accessdate = 2 May 2016 |work = House of Commons Speech |issue = 22 November 1990 |publisher = [[Hansard]]  HC [181/445-53] |via = Margaret Thatcher Foundation |date = 22 November 1990 |quote = People on all levels of income are better off than they were in 1979.

==Other uses==
In [[statistics]], the phrase "the rich get richer" is often used as an informal description of the behavior of [[Chinese restaurant process]]es and other [[preferential attachment]] processes, where the probability of the next outcome in a series taking on a particular value is proportional to the number of outcomes already having that particular value.  This is useful for modeling many real-world processes that are akin to "popularity contests", where the popularity of a particular choice causes new participants to adopt the same choice (which can lead to the outsized influence of the first few participants).

===Markets with social influence===
Product recommendations and information about past purchases have been shown to influence consumers choices significantly whether it is for music, movie, book, technological, and other type of products. Social influence often induces a rich-get-richer phenomenon ([[Matthew effect]]) where popular products tend to become even more popular.&lt;ref name="altszyler2017"&gt;{{cite journal | url= http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0180040 | title= Transient dynamics in trial-offer markets with social influence: Trade-offs between appeal and quality. |author1= Altszyler, E |author2=Berbeglia, F.| author3= Berbeglia, G. |author4=Van Hentenryck, P. | journal=  PLoS ONE | year=2017 |volume=12|issue=7 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0180040 | page=e0180040|bibcode=2017PLoSO..1280040A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Western Independence Party of Saskatchewan''' is a registered provincial [[political party]] in [[Saskatchewan]], Canada. It advocates for the independence of Saskatchewan, and libertarian ideals. It is not affiliated with any federal party. It supports [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservative]] and socially moderate policies.

==History==
The party was formed on July 12, 2003, and nominated 17 candidates in the November 5, [[Saskatchewan general election, 2003|2003 provincial election]]. These candidates won a total of 2,735 votes, or 0.64% of the provincial total.

The past party president is Frank Serfas, and the past deputy leader is [[David Sawkiw]].  The party nominated eight candidates for the [[Saskatchewan general election, 2007|2007 election]], two in the [[Saskatchewan general election, 2011|2011 election]], and four in the [[Saskatchewan general election, 2016|2016 election]].

At 2018, the party's current [[Party leader|leader]] is Neil Fenske.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/neil.fenske.79&lt;/ref&gt;  

Besides the party's support for independence, the party's platform is [[secularism|secular]] and [[libertarianism|libertarian]] in nature, a distinguishing feature from some of the other separatist parties in [[Western Canada]].  The WIP of Saskatchewan has no ties with the [[Separation Party of Alberta]], the [[Western Canada Party]], or the [[Alberta Independence Party]].

The party not affiliated to the [[Western Canada Concept Party of British Columbia]] or the [[British Columbia]]-based [[Western Block Party]] and has made considerable effort to distance itself from [[Doug Christie (lawyer)|Doug Christie]], the leader of those parties.  Whereas Christie has been mired in controversy for defending [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] and has been accused of being an [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semite]], the WIP has made an explicit statement in support of the [[Israel|State of Israel]].

==About==
The Western Independence Party of Saskatchewan is a registered political party in the province of Saskatchewan, with a focus on three principles:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/pg/Western-Independence-Party-of-Saskatchewan-810249165794566/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Decentralize political power from the Premier's Office to the people.
:*Rebalance economic power from monopolistic Corporations to the producers of wealth.
:*Give policy back to the MLA's that have earned the trust of their people instead of the smoke filled back rooms of the political parties.
