The '''Asticou Azalea Garden''' in [[Northeast Harbor, Maine|Northeast Harbor]], [[Maine]], United States, is a popular visitor attraction. It was created by lifelong resident of the village, [[Charles Kenneth Savage]], in 1956. Savage also created [[Reef Point Estate]] in nearby [[Bar Harbor, Maine|Bar Harbor]]. It was from Reef Point that several [[Laboratory_specimen|specimen]]s, with the financial assistance of [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], were moved, including the weeping [[Tsuga|hemlock]], just north of the main bridge.

Located at the intersection of [[Maine State Route 198|Route 198]] and [[Maine State Route 3|Route 3]] (Peabody Drive), the 2.3 acre garden and its pond are open to the public during daylight hours from May 1 to October 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asticou Azalea Gardens |url=http://www.jgarden.org/gardens.asp?ID=319 |publisher=Japanese Garden Research Network |accessdate=16 July 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816175850/http://www.jgarden.org/gardens.asp?ID=319 |archivedate=16 August 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It features a selection of [[rhododendron]]s and [[azalea]]s, including the ''[[Rhododendron canadense]]'', Maine's native azalea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardenpreserve.org/asticou-azalea-thuya/azalea-garden.html Asticou Azalea Garden at Mount Desert Land &amp; Garden Preserve] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805095127/http://www.gardenpreserve.org/asticou-azalea-thuya/azalea-garden.html |date=August 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Styled after a Japanese stroll garden, the fine-[[gravel]] paths are raked regularly in a manner that suggests flowing water. There is also a [[sand garden]], where this effect is repeated but with the addition of stones, which are meant to represent islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardenpreserve.org/asticou-azalea-thuya/azalea-garden-history.html "History of the Asticou Azalea Garden"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007070817/http://www.gardenpreserve.org/asticou-azalea-thuya/azalea-garden-history.html |date=October 7, 2011 }} - Mount Desert Land &amp; Garden Preserve&lt;/ref&gt;

Savage was also the owner of the Asticou Inn, which is located on the opposite side of Peabody Drive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asticou.com/bar-harbor-vacation-resort/asticou/history.html "History of the Asticou Inn"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902062750/http://www.asticou.com/bar-harbor-vacation-resort/asticou/history.html |date=September 2, 2011 }} - Asticou Inn website&lt;/ref&gt; Group photographs for weddings at the inn are often taken in the Garden.

The '''Boyanska reka''' ({{lang-bg|Боянска река}}, "[[Boyana]] river") is a river in western [[Bulgaria]], a left tributary to the river [[Perlovska]].

The river flows from the northern slopes of [[Cherni Vrah]] on [[Vitosha|Vitosha Mountain]], crossing [[Torfeno Branishte]] Nature Reserve; at the northern foothills of Vitosha the river drops forming the Boyana waterfall and then crosses the village of [[Boyana]] (part of [[Sofia]], from which the river takes its name) to flow into [[Perlovska]] near the [[National Palace of Culture]] in Sofia.

The '''cartography of India''' begins with early charts for navigation&lt;ref name=Sircar3/&gt; and constructional plans for buildings.&lt;ref name=gole1990&gt;Gole (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Indian traditions influenced [[Tibet]]an&lt;ref name=sircar329quote&gt;Sircar, 329&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Geography in medieval Islam|Islamic traditions]],&lt;ref name=Pinto06quote&gt;Pinto (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and in turn, were influenced by the [[United Kingdom|British]] cartographers who solidified modern concepts into India's map making.&lt;ref name=Fuechsel&gt;Fuechsel (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A prominent foreign geographer and cartographer was [[Hellenistic geography|Hellenistic geographer]] [[Ptolemy]] (90–168) who researched at the library in [[Alexandria]] to produce a detailed eight-volume record of world geography.&lt;ref name=Fuechsel/&gt; During the Middle Ages, India sees some exploration by [[Chinese geography|Chinese]] and [[Muslim geography|Muslim]] geographers, while European maps of India remain very sketchy.
A prominent medieval cartographer was [[Geography in medieval Islam|Persian geographer]] [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] (973–1048) who visited India and studied the country's geography extensively.&lt;ref name=Biruni&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Biruni|title=Abu Arrayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European maps become more accurate with the [[Age of Exploration]] and [[Portuguese India]] from the 16th century. The first modern maps were produced by [[Survey of India]], established in 1767 by the [[British East India Company]]. Survey of India remains in continued existence as the official mapping authority of the [[Republic of India]].

Schwartzberg]] (2008) proposes that the Bronze Age [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (c. 2500–1900 BCE) may have known "cartographic activity" based on a number of excavated surveying instruments and measuring rods and that the use of large scale constructional plans, cosmological drawings, and cartographic material was known in India with some regularity since the [[Vedic period]] (1st millennium BCE).{{clarify|date=December 2010}}&lt;ref name=Schwartzberg1&gt;Schwartzberg, 1301–1302&lt;/ref&gt;
: 'Though not numerous, a number of map-like graffiti appear among the thousands of Stone Age Indian cave paintings; and at least one complex Mesolithic diagram is believed to be a representation of the cosmos.'&lt;ref name=Schwartzberg1301&gt;Schwartzberg, 1301&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Gole (1990) comments on the cartographic traditions in early India:
{{Quotation|align=center|The fact that towns as far apart as [[Mohenjodaro]] near the [[Indus]] and [[Lothal]] on the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] coast were built in the second millennium BCE with baked bricks of identical size on similar plans denotes a widespread recognition of the need for accuracy in planning and management. In the 8th century CE the [[Ellora Kailasanathar Temple|Kailas temple]] at [[Ellora]] in [[Maharashtra]] was carved down into mountain for 100 feet, with intricate sculptures lining pillared halls, no easy task even with an exact map to follow, impossible without. So if no maps have been found, it should not be assumed that the Indians did not know how to conceptualize in a cartographic manner.&lt;ref name=gole1990/&gt;}}

==Antiquity==
[[File:Ptolemy_Asia_detail.jpg|thumb|Southeast Asia in a Renaissance map constructed after [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Ptolemy's Geography|Geography]]'', rediscovered by [[Maximus Planudes]] in [[Constantinople]] {{circa|lk=no|1300}}.]]
[[Cartography]] of [[Indian subcontinent|India]] as a part of the greater continent of [[Cartography of Asia|Asia]] develops in [[Classical Antiquity]].

In [[Greek cartography]], India appears as a remote land on the eastern fringe of Asia in the 5th century BCE ([[Hecataeus of Miletus]]). More detailed knowledge becomes available after the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]], and the 3rd-century BCE geographer [[Eratosthenes]] has a clearer idea of the size and location of India. By the 1st century, at least the western coast of India is well known to Hellenistic geography, with itineraries such as the [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]. [[Marinus of Tyre|Marinus]] and [[Ptolemy]] had some knowledge of the [[Indian Ocean]] (which they considered [[Indian Sea|a sea]]) but their [[Taprobane Island|Taprobane]] ([[Sri Lanka]]) was vastly too large and the Indian peninsula much reduced. They also had little knowledge of the interior of the country.

Native Indian cartographic traditions before the Hellenistic period remain rudimentary. Early forms of cartography in [[India]] included legendary paintings; maps of locations described in Indian [[epic poetry]], for example the ''[[Ramayana]]''.&lt;ref name=Sircar1/&gt; These works contained descriptions of legendary places, and often even described the nature of the mythological inhabitants of a particular location.&lt;ref name=Sircar1&gt;Sircar, page 327&lt;/ref&gt; Early Indian cartography showed little knowledge of scale, the important parts of the map were shown to be larger than others (Gole 1990). Indian cartographic traditions also covered the locations of the [[Pole star]], and other constellations of use.&lt;ref name=Sircar3/&gt; These charts may have been in use by the beginning of the [[Common Era]] for purposes of navigation.&lt;ref name=Sircar3/&gt; Other early maps in India include the [[Udaygiri Caves|Udayagiri]] wall sculpture—made under the [[Gupta empire]] in 400 CE—showing the meeting of the [[Ganges]] and the [[Yamuna]].&lt;ref name=Schwartzberg1302&gt;Schwartzberg, 1302&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==

The 8th-century poet and dramatist [[Bhavabhuti]], in Act 1 of the ''Uttararamacarita'', described paintings which indicated geographical regions.&lt;ref name=Sircar2&gt;Sircar, 328&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, over 200 medieval Indian maps were studied in the compilation of a history of cartography. Also considered in the study were copper-plate text inscriptions on which the boundaries of land, granted to the [[Brahman]] priests of India by their patrons, were described in detail.&lt;ref name=gole1990/&gt;  The descriptions indicated good geographical knowledge and in one case over 75 details of the land granted have been found.&lt;ref name=gole1990/&gt; The [[China|Chinese]] records of the [[Tang dynasty]] show that a map of the neighboring Indian region was gifted to Wang Hiuen-tse by its king.&lt;ref&gt;Sircar, 326.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th century, [[Geography in medieval Islam|Islamic geographers]] under [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid Caliph]] [[Al-Ma'mun]] improved on Ptolemy's work and depicted the [[Indian Ocean]] as an [[Ocean|open body of water]] instead of a land-locked [[sea]] as Ptolemy had done.&lt;ref name=Covington&gt;Covington (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] geographers [[Abū Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdānī]] and [[Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi]] set the [[Prime Meridian]] of their maps at [[Ujjain]], a centre of [[Indian astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, 189&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 11th century, the [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] visited India and studied the country's geography extensively.&lt;ref name=Biruni/&gt; He was considered the most skilled when it came to mapping [[City|cities]] and measuring the distances between them, which he did for many cities in the western [[Indian subcontinent]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} He also wrote extensively on the [[Geological history of India|geology of India]].&lt;ref&gt;Salam (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1154, the [[Arab]] geographer [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] included a section on the cartography and geography of India and its neighboring countries in his world atlas, ''[[Tabula Rogeriana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Citation|first=S. Maqbul|last=Ahmad|title=Al-Sharif al-Idrisi: India and the Neighbouring Territories|year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian scholar Francesco Lorenzo Pullè reproduced a number of Indian maps in his ''magnum opus'' ''La Cartografia Antica dell'India''.&lt;ref name=Sircar2/&gt; Out these maps two have been reproduced using a manuscript of ''Lokaprakasa''—originally compiled by the polymath Ksemendra ([[Kashmir]], 11th century CE)—as a source.&lt;ref name=Sircar2/&gt; The other manuscript, used as a source by Francesco Pullè, is titled ''Samgrahani''.&lt;ref name=Sircar2/&gt; The early volumes of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' also described cartographic charts made by the [[Dravidian people]] of India.&lt;ref name=Sircar3&gt;Sircar, 330&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See ''Encyclopædia Britannica, 14th edition, volume XIV, 840–841''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cartographic tradition of India influenced the map making tradition of [[Tibet]], where maps of Indian origin have been discovered.&lt;ref name=sircar329quote/&gt; Islamic cartography was also influenced by the Indian tradition as a result of extensive contact.&lt;ref name=Pinto06quote/&gt;

The Portuguese explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] reached the subcontinent on 20 May 1498, anchoring off [[Calicut]], on Malabar Coast. He would, with other [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese]], navigate and chart much of the sub-continents coast line, within decades. These charts were rapidly reproduced, and appeared in say the 1502 [[Cantino planisphere]].
[[File:Asia oceania anonymous c1550.jpg|thumb|370px|16th century Portuguese navigational chart of the region]]

==Mughal era==
Maps from the 1590 [[Ain-e-Akbari]], a [[Mughal era|Mughal]] document detailing India's history and traditions, contain references to locations indicated in earlier Indian cartographic traditions.&lt;ref name=Sircar2/&gt;

Through the 16th century European explorers, and traders, such as [[Jan Huygen van Linschoten]] ventured into the interior, from the growing number or European trading posts, and expanded on and refined the previous navigational charts, with geographic detail. A series of geographies published under the title ''Itinerario'' (later published as an English edition as Discours of Voyages into Y East &amp; West Indies), appeared in 1596, and graphically displayed for the first time in Europe detailed maps of voyages to the East Indies, particularly India.
[[File:AMH-6577-KB Bird's eye view of the city of Goa.jpg|thumb|370px|Map of Goa, in Linschoten's Itineraries, ca.1590]]

The [[wikt:seamless|seamless]] hollow [[Celestial globe]] was invented in Kashmir by Ali Kashmiri ibn Luqman in 998 AH (1589–90 CE), and twenty other such globes were later produced in [[Lahore]] and Kashmir during the [[Mughal Empire]].&lt;ref name=Emilie/&gt; Before they were rediscovered in the 1980s, it was believed by modern metallurgists to be technically impossible to produce hollow metal globes without any [[wiktionary:seam|seams]], even with modern technology.&lt;ref name=Emilie/&gt; These Mughal metallurgists pioneered the method of [[lost-wax casting]] in order to produce these globes.&lt;ref name=Emilie&gt;Savage-Smith (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholar Sadiq Isfahani of [[Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh|Jaunpur]] compiled an [[atlas]] of the parts of the world which he held to be 'suitable for human life'.&lt;ref name=Schwartzberg1302/&gt; The 32 sheet atlas—with maps oriented towards the south as was the case with Islamic works of the era—is part of a larger scholarly work compiled by Isfahani during 1647 CE.&lt;ref name=Schwartzberg1302/&gt; According to Joseph E. Schwartzberg (2008): 'The largest known Indian map, depicting the former [[Rajput]] capital at [[Amber]] in remarkable house-by-house detail, measures 661 × 645&amp;nbsp;cm. (260 × 254 in., or approximately 22 × 21&amp;nbsp;ft).'&lt;ref name=Schwartzberg1303&gt;Schwartzberg, 1303&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial India==
[[File:NainSingh.gif|thumb|right|For contributing to geographical knowledge about Asia, the [[pundit (explorer)]] and cartographer [[Nain Singh Rawat]] (19th century CE) received a [[Royal Geographical Society]] gold medal in 1876.]]
A map describing the [[kingdom of Nepal]], four feet in length and about two and a half feet in breadth, was presented to [[Warren Hastings]].&lt;ref name=Sircar1&gt;Sircar, page 327&lt;/ref&gt; In this [[raised-relief map]] the mountains were elevated above the surface and several geographical elements were indicated in different colors.&lt;ref name=Sircar1/&gt; The Europeans used 'scale-bars' in their cartographic tradition.&lt;ref name=gole1990/&gt;  Upon their arrival in India during the [[middle ages]], the indigenous Indian measures were reported back to Europe, and first published by Guillaume de I'Isle in 1722 as ''Carte des Costes de Malabar et de Coromandel''.&lt;ref name=gole1990/&gt;

With the establishment of the [[British Raj]] in India, modern European cartographic traditions were officially employed by the [[Survey of India|British Survey of India]] (1767). One British observer commented on the tradition of native Indian cartography:

{{Quotation|align=center|Besides geographical tracts, the Hindus have also maps of the world according to the system of the [[Puranas|puranics]] and of the astronomers: the latter are very common. They also have maps of India and of particular districts, in which latitudes and longitudes are entirely out of question, and they never make use of scale of equal parts. The sea shores, rivers and ranges of mountains are represented by straight lines.&lt;ref name="Sircar1"/&gt;}}

The [[Great Trigonometric Survey]], a project of the [[Survey of India]] throughout most of the 19th century, was piloted in its initial stages by [[William Lambton]], and later by [[George Everest]]. To achieve the highest accuracy a number of corrections were applied to all distances calculated from simple trigonometry:
* [[Curvature of the earth]]
* The non spherical [[Figure of the Earth|nature of the curvature of the earth]]
* [[Gravitation]]al influence of mountains on [[pendulum#Gravity|pendulum]]s
* [[Refraction]]
* [[Height above sea level]]

[[Thomas George Montgomerie]] organized several cartographic expeditions to map [[Tibet]], as well as [[China]].&lt;ref name=Nagendra&gt;Nagendra (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Mohamed-i-Hameed, [[Nain Singh]] and Mani Singh were among the agents employed by the British for their cartographic operations.&lt;ref name=Nagendra/&gt; Nain Singh, in particular, became famous for his geographical knowledge of Asia, and was awarded several honors for his expeditions.&lt;ref name=Nagendra2&gt;In 1876, his achievements were announced in the Geographical Magazine. The awards and recognition soon started flowing in. On his retirement, the [[British India|Indian Government]] honoured him with the grant of a village, and 1000 rupees in revenue. The crowning achievement came in 1876, when the [[Royal Geographical Society]] honoured him with a gold medal as the ‘man who has added a greater amount of positive knowledge to the map of Asia than any individual of our time—Nagendra 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern India (1947 to present)==

'''Digital geologic mapping''' is the process by which [[geological features]]  are observed, analyzed, and recorded in the field and displayed in real-time on a computer or [[personal digital assistant]] ([[PDA]]). The primary function of this [[emerging technology]] is to produce [[spatial reference|spatially referenced]] [[geologic maps]] that can be utilized and updated while conducting [[field work]].&lt;ref name="Kramer"&gt;{{cite conference |first=John |last=Kramer |title=Digital Mapping Systems for Field Data Collection |book-title=Digital Mapping Techniques '00 -- Workshop Proceedings|id=Open-File Report 00-325 |year=2000 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2000/of00-325/kramer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional geologic mapping==
[[Geologic map]]ping is an interpretive process involving multiple types of information, from analytical data to personal observation, all synthesized and recorded by the [[geologist]]. [[Geologic]] [[observations]] have traditionally been recorded on paper, whether on [[standardized]] note cards, in a [[notebook]], or on a [[map]].&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Barnes| first1 = John| last2 = Lisle| first2 = Richard | title = Basic Geological Mapping| publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd| year = 2004| location = Chichester, West Sussex PO19 8SQ, England| pages = 1–204| isbn =978-0-470-84986-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mapping in the digital era==
In the 21st century, computer technology and software are becoming portable and powerful enough to take on some of the more mundane tasks a geologist must perform [[field work|in the field]], such as precisely locating oneself with a [[GPS]] unit, displaying multiple images ([[map]]s, [[satellite images]], [[aerial photography]], etc.), plotting [[strike and dip]] symbols, and color-coding different physical characteristics of a [[lithology]] or contact type (e.g., [[unconformity]]) between rock [[stratum|strata]]. Additionally, computers can now perform some tasks that were difficult to accomplish in the field, for example, [[handwriting recognition|handwriting]] or [[speech recognition|voice recognition]] and [[annotating]] photographs on the spot.&lt;ref name="Sprinkel"&gt;{{Citation  | first = Douglas  | last = Sprinkel  | first2 = Kent  | last2 = Brown  | title = Using digital technology in the field | journal = Survey Notes  | volume = 40  | issue = 1  | pages = 1–2  | date =  | year = 2008  | url = http://geology.utah.gov/surveynotes/snt40-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digital mapping]] has positive and negative effects on the mapping process;&lt;ref name="McCaffrey"&gt;{{Citation  | first = K.  | last = McCaffrey  | first2 = R.  | last2 = Jones | first3 = R.  | last3 = Holdsworth | first4 = R.  | last4 = Wilson| first5 = P.  | last5 = Clegg| first6 = J.  | last6 = Imber| first7 = N.  | last7 = Holliman| first8 = I.  | last8 = Trinks | title = Unlocking the spatial dimension- digital technologies and the future of geoscience fieldwork | journal = Journal of the Geological Society, London  | volume = 162  | issue =   | pages = 927–938  | date =  | year = 2005  | url = http://geology.utah.gov/surveynotes/snt40-1.pdf | doi=10.1144/0016-764905-017}}&lt;/ref&gt; only an assessment of its impact on a geological mapping project as a whole shows whether it provides a net benefit. With the use of computers in the field, the recording of [[observations]] and basic [[data management]] changes dramatically. The use of digital mapping also affects when [[data analysis]] occurs in the mapping process, but does not greatly affect the process itself.&lt;ref name="Athey"&gt;{{Citation |first=Jennifer |last=Athey |first2=Lawrence |last2=Freeman |first3=Kenneth |last3=Woods |title=The transition from traditional to digital mapping: Maintaining data quality while increasing geologic mapping efficiency in Alaska |work=Newsletter 2008-2 |year=2008 |pages=1–12 |publisher=Alaska Division of Geological &amp; Geophysical Surveys |url=http://www.dggs.dnr.state.ak.us/pubs/pubs?reqtype=citation&amp;ID=17821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Some advantages of digital mapping===
* Data entered by a [[geologist]] may have fewer errors than data transcribed by a [[data entry clerk]].
* Data entry by geologists in the field may take less total time than subsequent data entry in the office, potentially reducing the overall time needed to complete a project.
* The spatial extent of real world objects and their [[attribute (computing)|attributes]] can be entered directly into a [[database]] with [[geographic information system]] ([[GIS]]) capability. Features can be automatically color-coded and symbolized based on set criteria.
* Multiple [[map]]s and imagery ([[geophysical]] maps, [[satellite images]], [[orthophoto]]s, etc.) can easily be carried and displayed on-screen.
* Geologists may upload each other's data files for the next day's [[field work]] as reference.
* [[Data analysis]] may start immediately after returning from the field, since the database has already been populated.
* Data can be constrained by dictionaries and dropdown menus to ensure that data are recorded systematically and that mandatory data are not forgotten
* Labour-saving tools and functionlaity can be provided in the field e.g. structure contours on the fly, and 3D visualisation
* Systems can be wirelessly connected to other digital field equipment (such as digital cameras and sensor webs)

===Some disadvantages of digital mapping===
* Computers and related items (extra batteries, stylus, cameras, etc.) must be carried [[field work|in the field]].
* Field data entry into the computer may take longer than physically writing on paper, possibly resulting in longer field programs.
* Data entered by multiple geologists may contain more inconsistencies than data entered by one person, making the [[database]] more difficult to [[information retrieval|query]].
* Written [[descriptions]] convey to the reader detailed information through [[imagery (literature)|imagery]] that may not be communicated by the same data in [[parsing|parsed]] format.
* Geologists may be inclined to shorten text descriptions because they are difficult to enter (either by [[handwriting recognition|handwriting]] or [[Speech recognition|voice recognition]]), resulting in loss of data.
* There are no original, hardcopy field maps or notes to [[archive]]. Paper is a more stable medium than digital format.&lt;ref name="Marcum"&gt;{{Citation  | first = Deanna  | last = Marcum  | first2 = Amy  | last2 = Friedlander  | title = Keepers of the Crumbling Culture: What Digital Preservation Can Learn from Library History | journal = D-Lib Magazine  | volume = 9  | issue = 5  | pages =  | date =  May 2003| year =  | url = http://www.dlib.org/dlib/may03/friedlander/05friedlander.html| doi = 10.1045/may2003-friedlander}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational and scientific uses==
Some universities and [[secondary education|secondary educators]] are integrating digital geologic mapping into class work.&lt;ref name="Berque"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Berque| first1 = Dave| last2 = Prey| first2 = Jane| last3 = Reed| first3 = Robert| title = Impact of Tablet PC's and Pen-based Technology on Education : Vignettes, Evaluations, And Future Directions| publisher = Purdue University Press| year = 2006| location = | pages = 1–200| isbn = 1-55753-434-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, The GeoPad project [http://geopad.org] describes the combination of technology, teaching field geology, and geologic mapping in programs such as [[Bowling Green State University]]’s geology field camp.[http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/geology/page58461.html] 
At Urbino University (Italy) [[:it:Università di Urbino]], Field Digital Mapping Techniques are integrated in Earth and Environmental Sciences courses since 2006 [http://www.uniurb.it/ISDA/Eolieweb/index.html] [http://www.uniurb.it/ISDA/sanbartolo/intro.html].
The MapTeach program is designed to provide hands-on digital mapping for middle and high school students.[http://www.mapteach.org/] The SPLINT [http://www.le.ac.uk/geography/splint/] project in the UK is using the BGS field mapping system as part of their teaching curriculum

Digital mapping technology can be applied to traditional geologic mapping, [[reconnaissance]] mapping, and [[surveying]] of geologic features. At international digital field data capture (DFDC) meetings, major geological surveys (e.g., [[British Geological Survey]] and [[Geological Survey of Canada]]) discuss how to harness and develop the technology.[http://www.bgs.ac.uk/science/dfdc/home.html] Many other geological surveys and private companies are also designing systems to conduct scientific and [[applied science|applied]] geological mapping of, for example, [[geothermal springs]]&lt;ref name=Coolbaugh&gt;{{cite conference |mode=cs2 |first=Mark |last=Coolbaugh |first2=Chris |last2=Sladek |first3=Chris |last3=Kratt |first4=Gary |last4=Edmondo |title=Digital mapping of structurally controlled geothermal features with GPS units and pocket computers |book-title=Proceedings, Annual Meeting of Geothermal Resources Council Transactions |date=Aug 29 – Sep 1, 2004 |volume=28 |pages=321–325 |location=Palm Springs, CA |url=http://www.unr.edu/Geothermal/pdffiles/CoolbaughDigGRC04.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528142315/http://www.unr.edu/Geothermal/pdffiles/CoolbaughDigGRC04.pdf |archive-date=2010-05-28}}

==Digital mapping equipment==
The initial cost of digital geologic computing and supporting equipment may be significant. In addition, equipment and software must be replaced occasionally due to damage, loss, and obsolescence. Products moving through the market are quickly discontinued as technology and consumer interests evolve. A product that works well for digital mapping may not be available for purchase the following year; however, testing multiple brands and generations of equipment and software is prohibitively expensive.&lt;ref name=Athey/&gt;

===Common essential features===
Some features of digital mapping equipment are common to both survey or reconnaissance mapping and “traditional” comprehensive mapping. The capture of less data-intensive reconnaissance mapping or survey data in the field can be accomplished by less robust databases and GIS programs, and hardware with a smaller screen size.&lt;ref name=Clegg&gt;{{Citation  | last = Clegg | first = P.  | last2 = Bruciatelli  | first2 = L.   | last3 = Domingos  | first3 = F.  | last4 = Jones  | first4 = R.  | last5 = De Donatis | first5 = M.  | last6 = Wilson  | first6 = R. | title = Digital geological mapping with tablet PC and PDA: A comparison  | journal = Computers &amp; Geosciences  | volume = 32  | issue =   | pages = 1682–1698  | date =  | year = 2006  | url = http://www.dur.ac.uk/r.r.jones/Downloads/C&amp;G2006_v32_10_1682_Clegg.pdf  | doi =   10.1016/j.cageo.2006.03.007| id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features essential to capture traditional geologic observations===
Hardware and software only recently (in 2000) became available that can satisfy most of the criteria necessary for digitally capturing "traditional" mapping data.
 
* Screen about 5" x 7"—compact but large enough to see map features. In 2009, some traditional mapping is conducted on [[PDA]]s.
* Lightweight—ideally less than 3&amp;nbsp;lbs.
* Transcription to digital text from handwriting and voice recognition.
* Can store paragraphs of data (text fields).
* Can store complex [[relational database]] with drop-down lists.

====Software====
Since every geologic mapping project covers an area with unique [[lithologies]] and complexities, and every geologist has a unique style of mapping, no software is perfect for digital geologic mapping out of the box. The geologist can choose to either modify their mapping style to the available software, or modify the software to their mapping style, which may require extensive  programming. {{as of|2009}}, available geologic mapping software requires some degree of customization for a given geologic mapping project. Some digital-mapping geologists/programmers have chosen to highly customize or extend ESRI's [[ArcGIS]] instead. At digital field data capture meetings such as at the British Geological Survey in 2002 [http://www.bgs.ac.uk/science/dfdc/abstracts.html] some organisations agreed to share development experiences, and some software systems are now available to download for free.

'''Erich Dagobert von Drygalski''' (February 9, 1865 &amp;ndash; January 10, 1949) was a German [[geographer]], [[geophysicist]] and polar scientist, born in [[Königsberg]], [[Province of Prussia]].

Between 1882 and 1887, Drygalski studied [[mathematics]] and [[natural science]] at the [[University of Königsberg]], [[Bonn]], [[Berlin]] and [[Leipzig]]. He graduated with a doctorate thesis about ice shields in Nordic areas. Between 1888 and 1891, he was an assistant at the [[Geodesy|Geodetic]] Institute and the Central Office of International Geodetics in Berlin. 

Drygalski led two expeditions between 1891 and 1893, which were supplied by the Society for [[Geoscience]] of Berlin. One expedition wintered during the winter between 1892 and 1893 in Western [[Greenland]]. He [[Habilitation|habilitated]] 1889 for geography and geophysics with the collected scientific evidence. In 1898, Drygalski became [[associate professor]] and 1899 extraordinary professor for [[geography]] and [[geophysics]] in Berlin.

== ''Gauss'' expedition ==
{{Main|Gauss expedition}}
[[Image:Gauss corp2854.jpg|240px|thumb|right|The ''Gauss'' enclosed in the ice. Photo taken from a balloon, the first [[aerial photography]] in Antarctica]]
Drygalski led the first German [[South Pole|South Polar]] expedition with the ship ''Gauss'' to explore the unknown area of [[Antarctica]] lying south of the [[Kerguelen Islands]]. The expedition started from [[Kiel]] in the summer of 1901. A small party of the expedition was also stationed on the Kerguelen Islands, while the main party proceeded further south. Drygalski also paid a brief call to [[Heard Island]] and provided the first comprehensive scientific information on the island's geology, flora and fauna. Despite being trapped by ice for nearly fourteen months until February 1903, the expedition discovered new territory in [[Antarctica]], the [[Kaiser Wilhelm II Land]] with the [[Gaussberg]]. The expedition arrived back in Kiel in November 1903. Subsequently, Drygalski wrote the narrative of the expedition and edited the voluminous scientific data. Between 1905 and 1931, he published twenty [[Volume (disambiguation)|volumes]] and two [[atlas]]es documenting the expedition and was awarded the 1933 [[Royal Geographical Society]]'s [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Patron's Gold Medal]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf |title=List of Past Gold Medal Winners |publisher=Royal Geographical Society |accessdate=24 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927221002/http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Later years ==
From October 1906 until his retirement, Drygalski was a professor in [[Munich]], where he also presided the Geographic Institute, founded by him, until his death. In 1910, he also took part in Count [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]]'s expedition to [[Svalbard|Spitsbergen]] and participated in other expeditions to [[North America]] and northeastern [[Asia]]. He died 1949 in Munich.

== Trivia ==
[[Drygalski Island]], [[Drygalski Fjord]] in South Georgia, and an avenue in the southern part of Munich were named after him, as is the crater [[Drygalski (crater)|Drygalski]] on the Moon. Two glaciers, including [[Drygalski Glacier (Antarctica)]] and [[Drygalski Glacier (Tanzania)]] on the slopes of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] are also named for him. An archive in the [[Ludwig Maximilians University]] remembers his pioneering efforts. He also has a South African spider named after him, ''[[Araneus drygalskii]]'' (Strand, 1909), based on material collected on the Gauss expedition.

The era of '''European and American voyages of scientific exploration''' followed the [[Age of Discovery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brosse|1983|pp=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were inspired by a new confidence in science and reason that arose in the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Maritime expeditions in the Age of Discovery were a means of expanding colonial empires, establishing new trade routes and extending diplomatic and trade relations to new territories, but with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] scientific curiosity became a new motive for exploration to add to the commercial and political ambitions of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/age_of_enlightenment.htm|title=The age of Enlightenment|author=Hackett, Louis|year=1992|accessdate=2011-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[List of Arctic expeditions]] and [[List of Antarctic expeditions]].

==Maritime exploration in the Age of Discovery==
From the early 15th century to the early 17th century the Age of Discovery had, through Spanish and Portuguese seafarers, opened up southern Africa, the Americas (New World), Asia and [[Oceania]] to European eyes: [[Bartholomew Dias]] had sailed around the Cape of southern Africa in search of a trade route to India; [[Christopher Columbus]], on four journeys across the Atlantic, had prepared the way for European colonisation of the New World; [[Ferdinand Magellan]] had commanded the first expedition to sail across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans to complete the first [[circumnavigation]] of the Earth. Over this period colonial power shifted from the Portuguese and Spanish to the Dutch and then the British and French. The new era of scientific exploration began in the late 17th century as scientists, and in particular natural historians, established scientific societies that published their researches in specialist journals. The British [[Royal Society]] was founded in 1660 and encouraged the scientific rigour of empiricism with its principles of careful observation and deduction. Activities of early members of the Royal Society served as models for later maritime exploration. [[Hans Sloane]] (1650–1753) was elected a member in 1685 and travelled to Jamaica from 1687 to 1689 as physician to the [[Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle|Duke of Albemarle]] (1653–1688) who had been appointed Governor of Jamaica. In Jamaica Sloane collected numerous specimens which were carefully described and illustrated in a published account of his stay.&lt;ref&gt;See{{Harvnb|Sloane|1707–1725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sloane bequeathed his vast collection of natural history 'curiosities' and library of over 50,000 bound volumes to the nation, prompting the establishment in 1753 of the [[British Museum]]. His travels also made him an extremely wealthy man as he patented a recipe that combined milk with the fruit of ''[[Theobroma cacao]]'' (cocoa) he saw growing in Jamaica, to produce milk chocolate.  Books of distinguished social figures like the intellectual commentator [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]], Director of the [[Paris Museum of Natural History]] [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, comte de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]], and scientist-travellers like [[Joseph Banks]], and [[Charles Darwin]], along with the romantic and often fanciful  [[travelogue (literature)|travelogues]] of intrepid explorers, increased the desire of European governments and the general public for accurate information about the newly discovered distant lands.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Speake|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest French expeditions on the coasts of Africa, South America and through the [[Strait of Magellan]] was made by a squadron of French [[Man-of-war|men-of-war]] under the command of M. de Gennes in 1695–97. The young French explorer, engineer and hydrographer [[François Froger]] described this expedition in his ''[[A Relation of a Voyage]]'' (1699).

==Maritime exploration in the Age of Enlightenment==
By the 18th century maritime exploration had become safer and more efficient with technical innovations that vastly improved navigation and cartography: improvements were made to the [[theodolite]], [[octant (instrument)|octant]], precision [[clock]]s, as well as the [[compass]], [[telescope]], and general [[shipbuilding]] techniques.
From the mid-18th century through the 19th century scientific missions mapped the newly discovered regions, brought back to Europe the newly discovered [[fauna]] and [[flora]], made hydrological, astronomical and meteorological observations and improved the methods of navigation. This stimulated great advances in the scientific disciplines of [[natural history]], [[botany]], [[zoology]], [[ichthyology]], [[conchology]], [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[medicine]], [[geography]], [[geology]], [[mineralogy]], [[hydrology]], [[oceanography]], [[physics]], [[meteorology]] etc. – all contributing to the sense of "improvement" and "progress" that characterized the Enlightenment. Artists were used to record landscapes and indigenous peoples, while natural history illustrators captured the appearance of organisms before they deteriorated after collection.&lt;ref name="Rice 2010 320"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rice|2010|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the worlds finest natural history illustrations were produced at this time and the illustrators changed from informed amateurs to fully trained professionals acutely aware of the need for scientific accuracy.&lt;ref name="Rice 2010 10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rice|2010|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the 19th century all of the world's major land masses, and most of the minor ones, had been discovered by Europeans and their coastlines charted.&lt;ref name="Rice 2010 290"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rice|2010|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the end of this phase of science as the [[European and American voyages of scientific exploration#1873–76: HMS Challenger|''Challenger'' Expedition]] of 1872–1876 began exploring the deep seas beyond a depth of 20 or 30 meters. In spite of the growing community of scientists, for nearly 200 years science had been the preserve of wealthy amateurs, educated middle classes and clerics.&lt;ref name="Rice 2010 320"/&gt; At the start of the 18th century most voyages were privately organized and financed but by the second half of the century these scientific expeditions, like [[James Cook]]'s three Pacific voyages under the auspices of the British Admiralty, were instigated by government.&lt;ref name="Rice 2010 10"/&gt; In the late 19th century, when this phase of science was drawing to a close, it became possible to earn a living as a professional scientist although photography was beginning to replace the illustrators. The exploratory sailing ship had gradually evolved into the modern [[research vessel]]s. From now on maritime research in new European colonies in America, Africa, Australia, India and elsewhere, would be carried out by researchers within the occupied territories themselves.&lt;ref name="Rice 2010 290"/&gt;

=== Chronology of voyages ===
This compendium of voyages of scientific exploration provides an overview of maritime scientific research carried out at the time of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe.
Published journals and accounts are included with the individual voyages.

==== 1764–66 : HMS ''Dolphin'' ====
[[File:HMS Dolphin 1751.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Dolphin'' at Tahiti in 1767]]
Considered the first scientific voyage undertaken by the Royal Navy, its primary purpose was the discovery of new lands in the South [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It was during this trip that several islands of the [[Tuamotu archipelago]] were discovered. {{HMS|Dolphin|1751|2}} was a 24-gun post ship launched in 1751 and used as a [[survey ship]] from 1764, making two [[circumnavigation]]s under the command of [[John Byron]] and [[Samuel Wallis]]. She was broken up in 1777.

** Captain: [[John Byron]] (1723–1786).
** Publications: J. Byron, ''A Voyage round the world.'' (London, 1767), translated into French the same year under the title ''Journey around the world in 1764 and 1765, on the English warship "The Dolphin", commissioned by Vice-Admiral Byron ...'' (Paris).

==== 1766–68 : HMS ''Dolphin'' and HMS ''Swallow'' ====
A circumnavigation by the English navigator [[Samuel Wallis]], on board {{HMS|Dolphin|1751|2}}, accompanied by [[Philip Carteret]] on the consort ship {{HMS|Swallow|1766|2}}. In August 1766, the two ships passed through the [[Strait of Magellan]]. In December 1766, conflicts between the two captains led to the separation of the ships. ''Dolphin'' reached [[Tahiti]] in June 1767. Samuel Wallis studied the customs of the Polynesians, reaching the [[Dutch East Indies]] at [[Jakarta|Batavia]], returning to London in May 1768. Meanwhile, Philip Carteret in ''Swallow'' explored and studied the [[Solomon Islands]], [[New Ireland (island)]] (now part of Papua New Guinea) and the islands of the Indonesian archipelago ([[Sulawesi]] among others). The expedition also stopped in Batavia from June to September 1768 and returned to London in March 1769.

** Captains: [[Samuel Wallis]] (1728–1795) (leader of the expedition), [[Philip Carteret]] (1733–1796) (Commander of ''Swallow'' which was separated from the ''Dolphin'' and returned to its point of departure a year later).
** Second Lieutenant: [[Tobias Furneaux]] (1735–1781).

==== 1766 :  HMS ''Niger''====

[[HMS Niger (1759)|HMS ''Niger'']] was a 33-gun [[fifth-rate]] launched in 1759, converted to a [[prison ship]] in 1810 and renamed ''Negro'' in 1813. She was sold in 1814.

** Captain: Thomas Adams (?–1770)
** Also aboard: [[Joseph Banks]] (1743–1820) and Constantine Phipps.

====1766–69 : ''La Boudeuse'' and ''L'Étoile''====
[[File:La Boudeuse.jpg|thumb|[[French frigate Boudeuse (1766)|''La Boudeuse'']] arriving in [[Matavai Bay|Matavai]] in 1767]]
Ordered by [[Louis XV]], it is the first trip around the world initiated by the French. The discovery and description of [[Tahiti]] by [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] in his trip will have a very significant impact on the philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] including [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712–1778). The expedition was organised by [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] and received the support of such prominent figures of the time as [[Charles de Brosses]] (1709–1777), [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]] (1707–1788), [[Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis]] (1698–1759) and [[Jérôme Lalande]] (1732–1807).

The purpose of the expedition is to discover new territories available for [[Human settlement|settlement]], to open a new route to reach China, to found new outlets for the [[French East India Company]] and, finally, discover acclimatable spices for the [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]] (now [[Mauritius]]).

The identity of the authors of this report remains controversial because different authors attribute it to Cook, to Banks, Solander as well as various officers having shared in the voyage. It is translated into French under the title of "Journal of a voyage around the world, 1768, 1769, 1770, 1771; containing the various events of the voyage; with the relationship of the lands newly discovered in the méridional… hemisphere " (Paris, 1772).&lt;br&gt;[[John Hawkesworth (book editor)|John Hawkesworth]] (c. 1715 – 1773) is commissioned by the Admiralty to make a synthesis of different shipments under the title "An Account of the Voyages undertaken… for making discoveries in the Southern Hemisphere and performed by Commodore Byrone [[John Byron]], Captain Hallis, Captain Carteret and Captain Cook (from 1702 to 1771) drawn up from the Journals…" (London, three volumes, 1773).

French King [[Louis XVI]] inspired by Cook's voyages mounted his own expedition under the direction of [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse|La Pérouse]]. Cook's anti-scorbutic remedies to eradicate [[scurvy]] were applied successfully. Lamanon and twelve other members of the expedition were massacred by natives at [[Vanuatu]] where they were looking for water. The two ships disappeared in the [[Solomon Islands]], at Vanikoro, during a violent storm.

More than 70 crates of natural history specimens were sent to Madrid. On return Captain Malaspina was forced into exile because of his ideas, suggesting, among other things, that Spain abandon the military domination of its colonies in favour of a Federation. The scientific journal of the trip was lost but recovered in 1885.

** Captains: [[Alessandro Malaspina]] (1754–1810) ("Descubierta") and [[José de Bustamante y Guerra]] (1759–1825) ("Atravida")

{{Main|Vancouver Expedition}}
A mission to the [[Pacific Ocean|South Seas]] and Pacific Northwest coast of America. In 1791, {{HMS|Discovery|1789|2}} left England with {{HMS|Chatham|1788|2}}. Both ships anchored at [[Cape Town]] before exploring the south coast of Australia. In King George Sound, the Discovery's naturalist and surgeon Archibald Menzies collected various plant species including ''[[Banksia grandis]]'', the first recording of the genus ''[[Banksia]]'' from Western Australia. The two ships sailed to Hawai{{okina}}i where Vancouver named Kamehameha I. Chatham and Discovery then sailed on to the Northwest Pacific. Over the course of the next four years, Vancouver surveyed the northern Pacific Ocean coast in Discovery wintering in Spanish California or Hawai{{okina}}i. Discovery's primary mission was to exert British sovereignty over this part of the Northwest Coast following the hand-over of the Spanish Fort San Miguel at Nootka Sound, although exploration in co-operation with the Spanish was seen as an important secondary objective. Exploration work was successful as relations with the Spanish went well; resupply in California was especially helpful. Vancouver and the Spanish commandant Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra were on such good terms that the original name of Vancouver Island was actually ''Quadra and Vancouver's Island''.

The second voyage of ''[[L'Astrolabe]]'', this time accompanied by ''[[La Zélée]]'', sailed on 7 September 1837 and at the end of November, the ships reached the Strait of Magellan. Dumont thought there was sufficient time to explore the strait for three weeks, taking into account the precise maps drawn by [[Phillip Parker King]] between 1826 and 1830, before heading south again but two weeks after seeing their first [[iceberg]], the ships were encased in pack ice for a while. After reaching the [[South Orkney Islands]], the expedition headed directly to the [[South Shetland Islands]] and the [[Bransfield Strait]]. Then located some land which was named ''Terre de Louis-Philippe'' (now called [[Graham Land]]), the [[Joinville Island group]] and ''Rosamel Island'' (now called [[Andersson Island]]. In poor shape the two ships headed for [[Talcahuano]] in Chile.

==== 1838–42: USS ''Vincennes'' and USS ''Peacock'' ====
[[File:Vincennes.jpg|thumb|USS ''Vincennes'' in Disappointment Bay, Antarctica, during the Wilkes expedition.]]
{{Main|United States Exploring Expedition}}
The "Wilkes Expedition", included [[Natural history|naturalist]]s, [[botanist]]s, a [[mineralogist]], [[taxidermist]]s, [[artist]]s and a [[philologist]] in the ships [[USS Vincennes (1826)|''Vincennes'']], [[USS Peacock (1828)|''Peacock'']], the [[brig]] [[USS Porpoise (1836)|''Porpoise'']], the store-ship [[USS Relief (1836)|''Relief'']], and two [[schooner]]s, [[USS Sea Gull (1838)|''Sea Gull'']], and [[USS Flying Fish (1838)|''Flying Fish'']].

Departing [[Hampton Roads]] on 18 August 18, 1838, the expedition stopped at [[Madeira]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]], Argentina; visited [[Tierra del Fuego]], [[Chile]], [[Peru]], the [[Tuamotu]] Archipelago, [[Samoa]], and [[New South Wales]]. From [[Sydney]], Australia, the fleet sailed into the [[Antarctic Ocean]] in December 1839 and reported the discovery "of an Antarctic continent west of the [[Balleny Islands]]" of which it sighted the coast on January 25, 1840. Next, the expedition visited [[Fiji]] and the [[Hawaiian Islands]] in 1840. In July 1840, two sailors, one of whom was Wilkes' nephew, Midshipman Wilkes Henry, were killed while bartering for food on [[Malolo]], in [[Fiji]]. Wilkes retribution was swift and severe. According to an old man of Malolo Island, nearly 80 Fijians were killed in the incident.

From December 1840 to March 1841, his men with [[native Hawaiian]] porters hauled a [[pendulum]] to the summit of [[Mauna Loa]] to measure gravity. He explored the west coast of [[North America]], including the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], [[Puget Sound]], the [[Columbia River]], [[San Francisco Bay]] and the [[Sacramento River]], in 1841.
The expedition returned by way of the [[Philippines]], the [[Sulu Archipelago]], [[Borneo]], [[Singapore]], [[Polynesia]] and the [[Cape of Good Hope]], reaching [[New York City]] on 10 June 1842. This was the first circumnavigation of the world funded by the Government of the [[United States]] and the last by a sailing vessel. The expedition was poorly prepared and of five vessels which left, only two returned to port. The natural history collections were very rich with 50,000 plant specimens (approximately 10&amp;nbsp;000 species) and 4,000 specimens of animals (half being new species).

This British trip, sponsored by the [[Royal Society]], was to discover magnetic and geographic features of the [[Antarctic]]. The expedition was prepared with great care by James Clark Ross, already familiar with Polar navigation. The two ships left the United Kingdom on 19 September 1839, stopping to explore the [[Kerguelen Islands]] in 1840, and then on [[Tasmania]] to build a magnetic observatory for the Antarctic and to conduct cartographic work. [[Mount Erebus]] and the [[Ross Sea]] were discovered during this journey. After three attempts, Ross admitted that the [[South Magnetic Pole|magnetic pole]] lay in land that he could not reach. Following the footsteps of his uncle [[John Ross (explorer)|John Ross]], he performed the first deep sea surveys up to 4800 m (2677 [[fathom]]s), using ropes.

There is also a photo from Beck's Sierra Nevada collecting trip in the archives of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology on the University of California, Berkeley campus. The story of buried treasure on Tower Island connected with this trip was apparently known to Captain Lindbridge during this voyage, but the information was not revealed until after the group had left Tower Island. This trip lasted from June 1897 to February 1898, after having started on a tragic note with the deaths of three of the original crew to Yellow Fever, and having to reconstitute the expedition in San Francisco, California.

==== 1897–98: ''Belgica'' ====
Adrien de Gerlache was an officer in the Belgian Royal Navy who led the [[Belgian Antarctic Expedition]] of 1897 to 1899. He acquired ''Le Patria'' in 1896 renaming it ''Belgica''. He left Antwerp on 16 August 1897 passing winter in the Antarctic before returning to Belgium on 5 November 1898.

** Naturalist: [[Emil Racovita]] (1868–1947)

==== 1898–99: ''[[Valdivia Expedition|Valdivia]]'' ====
[[File:Vessel Valdivia.jpg|thumb|''Valdivia'', 1898]]
A German deep-sea expedition exploring in Antarctic regions, the ''Valdivia'' being a steamship in the Hamburg-American line of steamers. The subscription was launched by [[Georg von Neumayer]] (1826–1909) and only consisted of a single vessel instead of the two planned. The expedition quickly reached the [[Cape of Good Hope]] where the study of deep waters began. The ship reached Antarctic pack ice and rediscovered [[Bouvet Island]] followed by the [[Kerguelen Islands]]. For the first time, evidence of deep water in this region was provided by survey. The ''Valdivia'' then passed to the [[Indian Ocean]], studying the coast of Sumatra before returning to its port of origin 29 April 1899.

** Captain: Adalbert Krech (1852–1907)
** Naturalist: [[Carl Chun]] (1852–1914).
** Publication: C. Chun (1903), "Aus den Tiefen des Weltmeeres".

[[Image:Jefferson Beach 1.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Feeder Bluff located at Jefferson Beach in Kingston, Washington]]

The geomorphological term '''feeder bluff''' is not a standard, widely accepted geologic term; its use has been limited to the [[Puget Sound]] region.  The concept was apparently first discussed at [[Western Washington University]].  The term '''feeder bluff''' has been applied to certain coastal [[cliffs]] or [[headlands]] that provide sediment to down-current beaches as the result of wave action on the bluff.

A bluff will be more susceptible to erosion if the sediment is unconsolidated, and more resistant in crystalline rocks, like granite. Rocks that are heavily fractured are also very likely to suffer from erosion because the water can flow between the cracks to speed up the process. A bluff will retreat towards land as the erosion processes continue.

The term has not been extensively researched; specific criteria have not been developed to distinguish "feeder bluffs" from other types of [[Cliff|bluffs]]; and quantities and rates of [[sediment]] supply to beaches and the [[littoral drift]] are unspecified and unknown.  The overall contribution of "feeder bluffs" to beach processes, unlike the well-researched effects of sediment from rivers, is still undetermined.

The '''Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS)''' is a Department of the government of [[Fiji]] responsible for providing weather forecasts and is based in [[Nadi]].  The current director of Fiji Meteorological Service is Ravind Kumar. Since 1985, FMS has been responsible for naming and tracking [[tropical cyclone]]s in the Southwest Pacific region.  Current Meteorologists working at FMS have a Graduate Diploma in Meteorology from the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]].

==History==
In the 1910s, weather services for Fiji were considered part of the responsibility of the Harbour Board in Suva.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mca.gov.to/Met/index_files/history_tms.pdf{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of Fiji Meteorological Services==
[[Image:Nadi town.jpg|190px|right]]
Since June 1995, the central weather office of Fiji, Nadi, has been one of six [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]]s within the World Weather Watch program of the [[World Meteorological Organization]].  Its specialty is forecasting tropical cyclones south of the [[equator]] to the [[25th parallel south]], and between the [[160th meridian east]] and [[120th meridian west]] [[longitude]].  FMS issues public and marine weather bulletins for [[Kiribati]], Northern Cooks, Southern Cooks, [[Tuvalu]], [[Tokelau]], [[Niue]], [[Nauru]] and [[Fiji]]. The Fiji Meteorological Services, as per agreement with the International Civil Aviation Organization, functions as the Meteorological Watch Office for the Nadi Flight Information Region (FIR), which
extends from Western [[Kiribati]] to [[Tuvalu]], [[Fiji]], [[Vanuatu]], [[Wallis and Futuna]] and [[New Caledonia]].
However, it still provides certain aviation forecast services to Cook Islands, Christmas Island (Line Islands), [[Samoa]], [[Niue]] and [[Tonga]] which are situated outside the Nadi FIR boundary. Aviation products issued by FMS include [[Terminal Aerodrome Forecast]]s (TAF), [[Trend Type Forecast]]s (TTF), Area Forecasts, Route Forecasts, Inclement Weather Warnings for Nadi and Nausori Airports, Sigmets and Tropical Cyclone Advisories (TCA). Routine 24 hour TAF's are issued for Nadi (NFFN), Nausori (NFNA), Rarotonga (NCRG), Fuamotu (NFTF), Vavau (NFTV), Faleolo (NFSA), Niue, Tarawa (NGTA), and Christmas Island (PLCH) airports. 24 hour TAF's are also issued for Funafuti (NGFU) airport on certain days. TAF's (validity periods of less than 24 hours) are also issued for Aitutaki (NCAI), Manihiki (NCMH), Penrhyn (NCPY), Haapai (NFTL), Labasa (NFNL) and Rotuma (NFNR) airports.

==Tropical Cyclone Products Issued by FMS==
Special Weather Bulletins (SWB's), Tropical Disturbance Advisories (TDA's), Special Advisory for [[Samoa]], Tropical Cyclone Advisories (TCA's), Tropical Cyclone Sigmets, CREX bulletins, International Marine Warnings associated with tropical cyclones (WTPS and WHPS) and Tropical cyclone forecast and uncertainty tracks are the tropical cyclone products issued by FMS.

[[Dominica]] is an [[island]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]], located about halfway between the French islands of [[Guadeloupe]] (to the north) and [[Martinique]] (to the south).  Its coordinates are 15 25 N, 61 20 W.  It is known as "The Nature Island of the Caribbean" due to its spectacular, lush, and varied flora and  fauna, which is protected by an extensive natural park system. It is the fourth largest island in the Eastern Caribbean with a population of people mainly from African descent.

The lowest point in the country is at [[sea level]] along the coast, and the highest is [[Morne Diablotins]] ({{convert|1447|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}).  The extreme southwestern coast of the island includes a large collapsed submarine caldera. Portions of the exposed rim of this caldera form the southwestern tip of the island at Scott's Head. Natural resources include [[farming]], [[hydropower]] and [[timber]].

Geographically, Dominica is distinctive in many ways. The country has one of the most rugged landscapes in the Caribbean, covered by a largely unexploited, multi-layered rain forest. It is also among the Earth's most rain-drenched lands, and the water runoff forms cascading rivers and natural pools. The island, home to rare species of wildlife, is considered by many as a beautiful, unspoiled tropical preserve. According to a popular West Indian belief, Dominica is the only New World territory that Columbus would still recognize.

Dominica is the largest and most northerly of the [[Windward Islands]]. The island faces the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Caribbean Sea to the west. Its nearest neighbors are the French islands of Guadeloupe, some {{convert|48|km|mi|0}} north, and Martinique, about {{convert|40|km|mi|0}} south. Oblong-shaped and slightly smaller than New York City, Dominica is {{convert|750|km2|sqmi|0}} in area, {{convert|47|km|mi|0}} in length, and {{convert|29|km|mi|0}} in width. Roseau, the nation's capital and major port, is favorably situated on the sheltered, southwestern coast.

==Climate==
The island's [[climate]] is tropical, moderated by northeast [[trade winds]] and heavy [[rain]]fall.

Dominica has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] and some areas bordering on a [[tropical monsoon climate]] with characteristically warm temperatures and heavy rainfall. Excessive heat and humidity are tempered somewhat by a steady flow of the northeast trade winds, which periodically develop into hurricanes during the Northern Hemisphere's summer. The steep interior slopes also alter temperatures and winds. Because of the moderating effects of the surrounding ocean temperature ranges are slight. Average daytime temperatures generally vary from {{convert|26|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|32|°C|1}} in June. Diurnal ranges are usually no greater than {{convert|3|C-change|1}} in most places, but temperatures dipping to {{convert|13|°C|1}} on the highest peaks are not uncommon.

Most of the island's ample supply of water is brought by the trade winds. Although amounts vary with the location, rain is possible throughout the year, with the greatest monthly totals recorded from June through October. Average yearly rainfall along the windward east coast frequently exceeds {{convert|5000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, and exposed mountainsides receive up to {{convert|9000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, among the highest accumulations in the [[Caribbean]] and the world. Totals on the leeward west coast, however, are only about {{convert|1800|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year. Humidities are closely tied to rainfall patterns, with the highest values occurring on windward slopes and the lowest in sheltered areas. Relative humidity readings between 70 percent and 90 percent have been recorded in Roseau.

Hurricanes and severe winds, most likely to occur during the wettest months, occasionally are devastating. The most recent hurricanes of note were [[Hurricane David|David and maria]] and [[Hurricane Frederic|Frederic]] in August 1979 and [[Hurricane Allen|Allen]] in August 1980. The 1979 hurricanes caused over 40 deaths, 2,500 injuries, and extensive destruction of housing and crops. Many agricultural commodities were destroyed during the 1980 storm, and about 25 percent of the banana crop was destroyed by strong winds in 1984.

Dominica is especially vulnerable to hurricanes as the island is located in what is referred to as the [[hurricane]] region. In 1979, Dominica was hit directly by [[Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]] [[Hurricane David]], causing widespread and extreme damage. On August 17, 2007, [[Hurricane Dean]], a [[Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 1]] at the time, hit the island. A mother and her seven-year-old son died when a [[landslide]] caused by the heavy rains fell onto their house.&lt;ref name="Forbes Haiti preps"&gt;{{cite news | title =  Hurricane Dean Gains Caribbean Strength | author = Jonathan Katz | publisher = [[Associated Press]] | url = https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/08/18/ap4033014.html | date = 2007-08-18 | accessdate = 2007-08-18}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another incident two people were injured when a tree fell on their house.&lt;ref name="cbc_2007-08-17"&gt;{{cite web|date=2007-08-17 |title=Hurricane claims one life in St. Lucia and possibly two in Dominica |publisher=CBC |accessdate=2007-08-17 |url=http://www.cbc.bb/content/view/12195/45/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828065016/http://www.cbc.bb/content/view/12195/45/ |archivedate=2007-08-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prime Minister of Dominica|Prime Minister]] [[Roosevelt Skerrit]] estimated that 100 to 125 homes were damaged, and that the agriculture sector was extensively damaged, in particular the banana crop.&lt;ref name="cbc_2007-08-17_02"&gt;{{cite web|date=2007-08-17 |title=Dominica Badly Affected |publisher=CBC |accessdate=2007-08-17 |url=http://www.cbc.bb/content/view/12195/45/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828065016/http://www.cbc.bb/content/view/12195/45/ |archivedate=2007-08-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
Dominica was the last island to be formed in the Caribbean. The island was created by volcanic action about 26 mya. It lies upon two opposing tectonic plates. This explains why an island a bit bigger than [[Martha's Vineyard]] has mountains approaching {{convert|5000|ft|0}}.&lt;ref Name="bg090118"&gt;{{cite book | author = Holahan, David |title = Rugged Dominica worth the ruined sneakers | publisher = Boston Globe | date = January 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geologically, Dominica is part of the rugged Lesser Antilles volcanic arc. The country's central spine, a northwest-southeast axis of steep volcanic slopes and deep gorges, generally varies in elevation from {{convert|300|to|1400|m|0}} above sea level. Several east-west trending mountain spurs extend to the narrow coastal plain, which is studded with sea cliffs and has level stretches no wider than {{convert|2000|m|0}}. The highest peak is Morne Diablotins, at {{convert|1447|m|0}}; Morne Trois Pitons, with an elevation of {{convert|1423|m|0}}, lies farther south and is the site of the national park.

The interior features rugged [[mountain]]s of [[volcano|volcanic]] origin. Volcanism is still quite evident on the island, the most popular examples being Dominica's [[Boiling Lake]] and "valley of desolation." The boiling lake (the world's second largest) is within a crater and is fed by a waterfall - the boiling is believed to be caused by the heat of a magma chamber beneath the lake. The valley of desolation is a sulfurous valley of volcanic vents and hot springs that inhibits significant plant growth - in stark contrast to the surrounding rain forest. Technically dormant today, this caldera last erupted in 1880.&lt;ref name="bg090118"/&gt; The area that exploded on 4 January 1880 was reported to be "fully nine square miles".&lt;ref&gt;''The Twillingate Sun'', February 10, 1881.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Volcanic rock (Dominica).jpg|thumb|left|300px|Volcanic rock at Pagua Bay, Dominica]]
Dominica's rugged surface is marked by its volcanic past. Rock formations are mainly volcanic andesite and rhyolite, with fallen boulders and sharp-edged protrusions peppering slope bases. The light- to dark-hued clayey and sandy soils, derived from the rocks and decomposed vegetation, are generally fertile and porous. Only a few interior valleys and coastal strips are flat enough for soil accumulations of consequence, however. Although scores of mostly mild seismic shocks were recorded in 1986, volcanic eruptions ceased thousands of years ago. Sulfuric springs and steam vents, largely concentrated in the central and southern parts of the island, remain active, however. One of the largest springs, Boiling Lake, is located in the national park.

Dominica is water-rich with swift-flowing highland streams, which cascade into deep gorges and form natural pools and crater lakes. The streams are not navigable, but many are sources of hydroelectric power. Trafalgar Falls, located near the national park, is one of the most spectacular sites on the island. The falls has two twin waterfalls known as the mother and father.  The falls form a natural pool where the natives and tourist come to enjoy a nice cool bath. The principal rivers flowing westward into the Caribbean are the Layou and the Roseau, and the major one emptying eastward into the Atlantic is the Toulaman. The largest crater lake, called Boeri, is located in the national park. There are 83 "significant" waterways on the island out of a total of 365 rills and brooks.&lt;ref name="bg090118"/&gt;

===Natural history===
There are 172 species of birds, including four species of [[hummingbird]], [[broad-winged hawk]]s, [[yellow-crowned night heron]]s, and the [[brown trembler]].&lt;ref name="bg090118"/&gt; Some plants and animals thought to be extinct on surrounding islands can still be found in Dominica's forests.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The [[imperial parrot|sisserou parrot]] is Dominica's national bird and is indigenous to its mountain forests.

The [[Caribbean Sea]] offshore of the island of Dominica is home to many [[cetaceans]].  Most notably a small group of [[sperm whale]]s live in this area year round. These are shy animals, but there is a good chance of seeing them if you go out on a calm day. Other cetaceans commonly seen in the area include [[pilot whale]], [[Fraser's dolphin]], [[pantropical spotted dolphin]] and [[bottlenose dolphin]].  Less commonly seen animals include [[Cuvier's beaked whale]], [[false killer whale]], [[pygmy sperm whale]], [[dwarf sperm whale]], [[Risso's dolphin]], [[common dolphin]], [[humpback whale]] and [[Bryde's whale]].  This makes Dominica a destination for tourists interested in [[whale-watching]].

The '''geography of the [[Manila|City of Manila]]''' is characterized by its coastal position at the [[estuary]] of the [[Pasig River]] that flows to [[Manila Bay]]. The city is located on a naturally protected harbor, regarded as one of the finest harbors in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city-data.com/world-cities/Manila-Environment.html |title=Environment — Manila |publisher=City-Data |accessdate=February 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scarce availability of land is a contributing factor that makes Manila the densest populated city in the world.

Almost all of the city sits atop of centuries of prehistoric [[alluvium|alluvial]] deposits built up by the Pasig River and on some land reclaimed from Manila Bay. The city's land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable land reclamation along the waterfronts since the American colonial times. Some of the natural variations in topography have been evened out due to the urbanization of the city. Manila lies 800 miles (1,300&amp;nbsp;km) from mainland [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geography.howstuffworks.com/asia/geography-of-manila.htm |title=Geography of Manila |publisher=[[HowStuffWorks]] |accessdate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before and during the [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines]], [[Manila]] was the provincial capital over a province whose territory at one time covered nearly all of Luzon, and included the modern territorial subdivisions of [[Pampanga]], [[Bulacan]], [[Rizal]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], [[Batangas]], [[Quezon]], [[Mindoro]], [[Masbate]] and [[Marinduque]]. Later, these subdivisions were themselves made provinces, leaving Manila province with a territory roughly equal to the present City of Manila proper (except Intramuros, the capital site), and the northwestern two-thirds of Rizal province. The boundary of Manila province went from northeast to southwest, including [[Antipolo]], [[Cainta]], [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]] and [[Taguig]], and all of the towns north and west of them, in Manila province; and [[Angono]], [[Teresa, Rizal|Teresa]], [[Morong, Rizal|Morong]], and the towns south and east of them, in Laguna province. Early in the province's history, the provincial name was changed from Manila to [[Tondo Province]], by which it was known for most of the Spanish era.

In about 1853, four [[pueblo]]s or towns of Tondo Province were joined with the northeastern towns of Laguna province to form the politico-military ''Distrito de los Montes de San Mateo'', or District of the San Mateo Mountains. The Tondo Province annexed to this new district the towns of [[Cainta]], [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]], [[Antipolo]] and [[Boso-boso]], while Laguna contributed the towns of [[Angono]], [[Binangonan]], [[Cardona, Spain|Cardona]], [[Morong, Rizal|Morong]], [[Baras, Rizal|Baras]], [[Tanay, Rizal|Tanay]], [[Pililla]] and [[Jalajala]]. But the name of the new district proved unwieldy, too long, and misled many into thinking the town of [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]] (in Tondo province) was the capital of the San Mateo Mountain District, when in reality the district capital was in Morong. So, in 1859, following common practice of the day, the district was renamed after its capital; namely, Morong District. At about the same time, Tondo Province was renamed [[Manila Province]].

When the Spaniards turned over the Philippines to the hands of the Americans, a civil government was formed. In about the same period, the Manila Province was dissolved by the [[Philippine Commission]], and its pueblos were incorporated with those of the District of Morong, forming the new [[Rizal|Province of Rizal]]. A few weeks, a new charter for the City of Manila, defining its boundaries and annexing some of towns of the Province of Rizal to its districts. These boundaries were slightly revised and redefined on January 29, 1902 when the suburb of [[Gagalangin, Tondo|Gagalangin]] was annexed to the city district of Tondo, and the former pueblo of [[Santa Ana, Manila|Santa Ana]] was turned into a city district of Manila. On July 30 of the same year, the city board officially divided the city into 13 political subdivisions named as districts, and the boundaries of each were defined. On August 15 of the same year, the pueblo of [[Pandacan, Manila|Pandacan]] was annexed as a city district. Since then the boundaries and city districts of Manila have remained essentially the same.

During World War II, the city of Manila was declared an open city and its administrative boundaries expanded to outlying cities and municipalities. It was called the '''Greater Manila''' and included districts such as ''Bagumbayan'' means New Town (South of Manila), ''Bagumpanahon'' means "New Era" (Sampaloc, Quiapo, San Miguel and Santa Cruz), ''Bagumbuhay'' means "New Life" (Tondo), ''Bagong Diwa'' means "New Order" (Binondo &amp; San Nicholas), the then newly established [[Quezon City]] was collapsed and divided into two districts, while the municipalities of [[Caloocan City|Caloocan]], [[Las Piñas City|Las Piñas]], [[Malabon City|Malabon]], [[Makati City|Makati]], [[Mandaluyong City|Mandaluyong]], [[Navotas City|Navotas]], [[Parañaque City|Parañaque]], [[Pasay City|Pasay]], and [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] became districts of Manila.

The '''geology of Pluto''' consists of the characteristics of the surface, crust, and interior of [[Pluto]]. Because of Pluto's distance from Earth, in-depth study from Earth is difficult. Many details about Pluto remained unknown until 14 July 2015, when ''[[New Horizons]]'' flew through the Pluto system and began transmitting data back to Earth.&lt;ref name="NASA-20150115" /&gt; When it did, Pluto was found to have remarkable geologic diversity, with ''New Horizons'' team member Jeff Moore saying that it  "is every bit as complex as that of Mars".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://astronomy.com/news/year-of-pluto/2015/09/new-pluto-images-from-nasas-new-horizons-show-complex-terrain | title=New Pluto images from NASA’s New Horizons show complex terrain | date=10 September 2015 | publisher=Astronomy | accessdate=29 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The final ''New Horizons'' Pluto data transmission was received on 25 October 2016.&lt;ref name="NYT-20161028"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=No More Data From Pluto |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/science/pluto-nasa-new-horizons.html |date=28 October 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=3 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Pluto-Map-Annotated.jpg|thumb|The portions of Pluto's surface mapped by ''New Horizons''. Center is 180 degrees longitude (diametrically opposite the moon Charon).]]
Pluto's surface is composed of more than 98 percent [[solid nitrogen]], with traces of [[methane]] and [[carbon monoxide]].&lt;ref name="tobias" /&gt; The face of Pluto oriented toward Charon contains more solid methane,&lt;ref name="SP-20170927"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lewin |first=Sarah |title=Pluto's 'Skyscrapers': What's Responsible for Dwarf Planet's Giant Ice Blades |url=https://www.space.com/38281-pluto-giant-ice-blades-explained.html |date=27 September 2017 |work=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=27 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the opposite face contains more nitrogen and solid carbon monoxide.&lt;ref name="Boyle1999-MSNBC" /&gt; Distribution of volatile ices is thought to be season-dependent and influenced more by solar insolation and topography than subsurface processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bertrand|first=T|last2=Forge|first2=F|date=2016|title=Observed glacier and volatile distribution on Pluto from atmosphere-topography processes|journal=Nature|volume=2016; 000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SP-20170927" /&gt;

Maps produced from images taken by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST), together with Pluto's light curve and the periodic variations in its infrared spectra, indicate that Pluto's surface is very varied, with large differences in both brightness and color,&lt;ref name="Buie_2010 light curve" /&gt; with albedos between 0.49 and 0.66.&lt;ref name="Hamilton" /&gt; Pluto is one of the most contrastive bodies in the Solar System, with as much contrast as [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]].&lt;ref name="Buie_web_map" /&gt; The color varies between charcoal black, dark orange and white.&lt;ref name="Hubble2010" /&gt; Pluto's color is more similar to that of [[Io (moon)|Io]] with slightly more orange, significantly less red than [[Mars]].&lt;ref name="Buie_2010 surface-maps" /&gt; ''New Horizons'' found that Pluto's surface age is equally variable, with ancient, dark, mountainous terrain (such as Cthulhu) being found alongside the bright, flat, effectively craterless Sputnik Planitia and various terrains of intermediate age and color.

Pluto's surface color has changed between 1994 and 2003: the northern polar region has brightened and the southern hemisphere has darkened.&lt;ref name="Hubble2010" /&gt; Pluto's overall redness has also increased substantially between 2000 and 2002.&lt;ref name="Hubble2010" /&gt; These rapid changes are probably related to seasonal condensation and [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] of portions of Pluto's [[Atmosphere of Pluto|atmosphere]], amplified by Pluto's extreme [[obliquity|axial tilt]] and high [[orbital eccentricity]].&lt;ref name="Hubble2010" /&gt;

[[Cthulhu Regio]] and [[Brass Knuckles (Pluto)|other dark areas]] have many craters and signatures of solid methane. The dark red color is thought to be due to [[tholin]]s falling out of Pluto's atmosphere.

===Northern latitudes===
The mid-northern latitudes display a variety of terrain reminiscent of the surface of [[Triton (moon)|Triton]]. A polar cap consisting of solid methane "diluted in a thick, transparent slab of solid nitrogen" is somewhat darker and redder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Tartarus Dorsa===
[[File:Snakeskin terrain covering Tartarus Dorsa.png|thumb|right|Snakeskin terrain formed by penitentes covering Tartarus Dorsa.]]

The western part of Pluto's northern hemisphere consists of an extensive, highly distinctive set of 500-meter-high mountains informally named Tartarus Dorsa; the spacing and shape of the mountains looks similar to scales or tree bark. These icy ridges were identified as [[penitente (snow formation)|penitentes]] in a January 2017 [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] paper by Dr. John Moores and his colleagues.&lt;ref name="Moores"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moores|first1=John E.|last2=Smith|first2=Christina L.|last3=Toigo|first3=Anthony D.|last4=Guzewich|first4=Scott D.|title=Penitentes as the origin of the bladed terrain of Tartarus Dorsa on Pluto|journal=Nature|date=4 January 2017|volume=541|issue=7636|pages=188–190|doi=10.1038/nature20779|pmid=28052055|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v541/n7636/pdf/nature20779.pdf|arxiv = 1707.06670 |bibcode = 2017Natur.541..188M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Penitentes are icy depressions formed by erosion and surrounded by tall spires.  Pluto is the only planetary body other than Earth on which penitentes have been identified. Although penitentes have been hypothesized on Jupiter's satellite [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], current theories suggest they may require an atmosphere to form. Moores and his colleagues hypothesize that Pluto's penitentes grow only during periods of high atmospheric pressure, at a rate of approximately 1 centimeter per orbital cycle. These penitentes appear to have formed in the last few tens of millions of years, an idea supported by the sparsity of craters in the region, making Tartarus Dorsa one of the youngest regions on Pluto.&lt;ref name="Moores"/&gt;

Cutting through both Tartarus Dorsa and Pluto's heavily cratered northern terrain (and thus formed more recently than both) is a set of six canyons radiating from a single point; the longest, informally named Sleipnir Fossa, is over 580 kilometers long. These chasms are thought to have originated from pressures caused by material upwelling at the center of the formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|editor-last=Talbert|editor-first=Tricia|url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/icy-spider-on-pluto|title=Icy ‘Spider’ on Pluto|publisher=NASA|date=8 April 2016|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible cryovolcanism===
When ''New Horizons'' first sent back data from Pluto, Pluto was thought to be losing hundreds of tons of its atmosphere an hour to ultraviolet light from the Sun; such an escape rate would be too great to be resupplied by comet impacts. Instead, nitrogen was thought to be resupplied by either [[cryovolcano|cryovolcanism]] or geysers bringing it to the surface. Images of structures that imply upwelling of material from within Pluto, and streaks possibly left by geysers, support this view.&lt;ref name="NYT-20150717-kc3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Scientists study nitrogen provision for Pluto's atmosphere| publisher=phys.org| date=2015-08-11|url=http://phys.org/news/2015-08-scientists-nitrogen-provision-pluto-atmosphere.html |accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent discoveries suggest that Pluto's atmospheric escape was overestimated by several thousand times and thus Pluto could theoretically keep its atmosphere without geological assistance, though evidence of ongoing geology is still strong.&lt;ref&gt;http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=20151109&lt;/ref&gt;

Two possible cryovolcanoes, provisionally named [[Wright Mons]] and [[Piccard Mons]], have been identified in topographic maps of the region south of [[Sputnik Planitia]], near the south pole. Both are over 150&amp;nbsp;km across and at least 4&amp;nbsp;km high, the tallest peaks known on Pluto at present. They are lightly cratered and thus geologically young, although not as young as Sputnik Planitia. They are characterized by a  large summit depression and hummocky flanks. This represents the first time large potentially cryovolcanic constructs have been clearly imaged anywhere in the Solar System.&lt;ref name = "News2015-11-09"&gt;{{cite web

The diameter of the core is hypothesized to be approximately {{val|1700|u=km}}, 70% of Pluto's diameter.&lt;ref name="Hussmann2006"/&gt; It is possible that such heating continues today, creating a subsurface [[ocean layer]] of liquid water and ammonia some {{nowrap|100 to 180 km}} thick at the core–mantle boundary.&lt;ref name="Hussmann2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pluto.jhuapl Inside Story" /&gt;&lt;ref name="space.com" /&gt; Studies based on ''New Horizon'''s images of Pluto reveal no signs of contraction (as would be expected if Pluto's internal water had all frozen and turned into [[ice II]]) and imply that Pluto's interior is still expanding, probably due to this internal ocean; this is the first concrete evidence that Pluto's interior is still liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2094848-pluto-must-have-liquid-ocean-or-itd-look-like-an-overripe-peach/|title=Pluto must have liquid ocean or it’d look like an overripe peach|last=Gearin|first=Conor|work=[[New Scientist]]|date=22 June 2016|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammond|first1=Noah P.|last2=Barr|first2=Amy C.|last3=Parmentier|first3=Edgar M.|title=Recent tectonic activity on Pluto driven by phase changes in the ice shell|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|date=2 July 2016|volume=43|issue=13|pages=6775–6782|doi=10.1002/2016GL069220|arxiv = 1606.04840 |bibcode = 2016GeoRL..43.6775H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pluto is proposed to have a thick water-ice lithosphere, based on the length of individual faults and lack of localized uplift.

'''ISO 3166-2:MA''' is the entry for [[Morocco]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Morocco, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for two levels of subdivisions:
* [[regions of Morocco|12 regions]]

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note too the American spellings of '''integrated assessment modeling''' and '''integrated modeling'''.}} is a type of [[scientific modelling]] often used by the [[environmental sciences]] and [[environmental policy]] analysis. The modelling is '''integrated''' because environmental problems do not respect the borders between academic disciplines. Integrated assessment models therefore integrate knowledge from two or more domains into a single framework. Integrated modelling is referred to as '''assessment''' because the activity aims to generate useful information for policy making, rather than to advance knowledge for knowledge's sake. Integrated assessment modelling is that part of integrated assessment that relies on the use of numerical '''models'''.

Integrated assessment modelling has a long history, and scholars disagree on the first precedent. However, it became recognizable as a sub- or inter-discipline in the late 1980s with a focus on understanding and regulating [[acid rain|acidification]]. Integrated assessment modelling was further developed in the area of [[climate change]], inter alias in the context of the [[Energy Modeling Forum]].

Notable centres of integrated assessment modelling are [[IIASA]], [[MIT]], [[Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]], and [[International Futures]]. Notable scholars are [[Barry B. Hughes]], [[William Nordhaus|Bill Nordhaus]], [[Robert O. Mendelsohn|Robert Mendelsohn]], [[Richard G. Richels|Rich Richels]], [[Michael Schlesinger]], [[Stephen Schneider]], [[Richard Tol]], [[John Weyant]], and [[Gary Yohe]].

== Interpretation ==

While the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) relies heavily on integrated modeling, [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] lead author Thomas Bruckner cautions against overinterpreting the results from such modeling.&lt;ref name="bruckner-2016"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | first = Thomas | last = Bruckner
 | title = Decarbonizing the global energy system: An updated summary of the IPCC report on mitigating climate change
 | date = January 2016
 | journal = Energy Technology
 | volume = 4

 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ente.201500387/pdf
 | access-date = 2016-10-26
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  With regard to future technology choice, Bruckner observes that "The ''quantitative deployment'' of [[nuclear power]] or [[Carbon capture and storage|CCS]] technologies that has been found by the IPCC authors in the different mitigation scenarios, for instance, occasionally has been (mis)interpreted as an IPCC ''recommendation for their factual usage''."&lt;ref name="bruckner-2016"/&gt;{{rp|20}}{{nnbsp}}{{rp|at=emphasis per original}}  Bruckner continues "The scale of deployment of low-carbon technologies shown in [IPCC] diagrams{{nbsp}}... reveals neither the ''possible contribution'' of the respective energy technology to GHG mitigation nor the ''required contribution''.{{nbsp}}... The possible contribution (without considering costs) might be higher whereas the strictly required one could be lower.&lt;ref name="bruckner-2016"/&gt;{{rp|20}}

== Criticism ==

Economist [[Robert Pindyck]] argues that IAMs are problematic and "close to useless as tools for policy analysis". He argues that "IAM-based analyses of [[Climate change policy of the United States|climate policy]] create a perception of knowledge and precision that is illusory, and can fool policy-makers into thinking that the forecasts the models generate have some kind of scientific legitimacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Robert S. |last1=Pindyck |title=The Use and Misuse of Models for Climate Policy |journal=Review of Environmental Economics and Policy |volume=11 |issue=1 |year=2017 |pages=100–114 |doi=10.1093/reep/rew012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ivan Vladimirovitch Chtcheglov''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Ива́н Влади́мирович Щегло́в; 16 January 1933 – 21 April 1998) was a [[France|French]] political theorist, activist and poet, born in [[Paris]] to a [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]] father and a [[French people|French]] mother.

==Family background==

Ivan was the son of Vladimir Chtchegloff, a revolutionary sentenced to two years imprisonment following the [[1905 Revolution]]. After his release, Vladimir left the [[Russian Empire]] with his wife Hélene Zavadsky. After originally staying in [[Belgium]] for three years, the couple moved to [[Paris]] in 1910, where Vladimir continued work as a taxi driver. He was active in the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|CGT]] and involved in the 1911 drivers strike.

==Activities==
Ivan wrote ''Formulaire pour un urbanisme nouveau'' (Formulary for a New Urbanism) in 1953, at age nineteen under the name Gilles Ivain, which was an inspiration to the [[Lettrist International]] and [[Situationist International]] The following quotation from the text was used as the inspiration for the famous Manchester nightclub, the [[The Haçienda|Haçienda]]:

"And you, forgotten, your memories ravaged by all the consternations of two hemispheres, stranded in the Red Cellars of Pali-Kao, without music and without geography, no longer setting out for the hacienda where the roots think of the child and ''where the wine is finished off with fables from an old almanac''. That’s all over. You’ll never see the hacienda. It doesn’t exist.

''The hacienda must be built''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bopsecrets.org/SI/Chtcheglov.htm|title=Formulary for a New Urbanism (Ivan Chtcheglov)|last=Chtcheglov|first=Ivan|website=www.bopsecrets.org|access-date=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He and his friend Henry de Béarn planned to blow up the [[Eiffel Tower]] with some dynamite they had stolen from a nearby building site, because "its reflected light shone into their shared attic room and kept them awake at night."&lt;ref&gt;HUSSEY, A. (2002) The Game of War: The Life and Death of Guy Debord, London, Pimlico. p.51&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested at ''Les Cinq Billards'' on Rue Mouffetard&lt;ref&gt;HUSSEY, A. (2002) The Game of War: The Life and Death of Guy Debord, London, Pimlico. p.94&lt;/ref&gt;  in [[Paris]] and committed to a [[mental hospital]] by his wife, where he was subdued with [[Insulin shock therapy|insulin]] and [[Insulin shock therapy|shock therapy]], and remained for 5 years. He died in 1998.

The dual monarchy of [[Austria-Hungary]] was abolished in 1918. The current Head of the [[House of Habsburg]] is [[Archduke]] [[Karl Habsburg-Lothringen|Karl]]. The succession law used is [[Order of succession#Agnatic succession|Semi-Salic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Almanach de Gotha]] |year=1905 |publisher=[[Justus Perthes]] |edition=142 |page=658 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pragmatic Sanction===
{{Main article|Pragmatic Sanction of 1713}}

===Equal marriages===
During the monarchy and for a number of decades afterwards members of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine had to be born of an Imperially approved, [[Royal intermarriage|equal marriage]] to be deemed [[Dynasty#Dynasts|dynastic]], according to the Imperial Family's [[house law]] of 1839. On the authorization of the Emperor, that law was amended with addenda on 12 June 1900 (two weeks prior to a declaration to the Austrian and Hungarian legislatures of the morganatic nature of  [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]]'s impending marriage to [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Countess Sophie Chotek]]), requiring a spouse to belong to one of the following: the Imperial Family of Austria-Hungary, a currently or previously sovereign Christian dynasty, or a [[German Mediatisation|mediatised]] family. It further clarified the pool of eligible marital partners to include 1. a list of 32 mediatised, princely families, and 2. only members of the specified mediatized families who were born in compliance with their own family's equality of birth house law or who could prove 16 noble, knightly [[Quarters of nobility|quarterings]] (i.e., all great-great-grandparents) and beyond that at least 300 years of [[tournament]], [[fief]]-holding nobility in the paternal and maternal lines.&lt;ref name=houselaw&gt;Wien, Haus-, Hof- und Staatsarchiv.

By the time of the marriage of Archduke Karl in 1993 to Baroness [[Francesca von Habsburg|Francesca Thyssen-Bornemisza]], who did not meet the old equality requirements, the rules regarding equal marriages had been relaxed&lt;ref name="petit"/&gt; (In 1953 [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria (1919–2010)|Archduke Rudolf]]'s marriage to Countess Xenia Tchernichev-Besobrasov and in 1976 that of another [[Archduke Carl Ludwig of Austria (1918–2007)#Family|Archduke Rudolf]] to Baroness Marie-Hélène de Villenfagne de Vogelsangck had been approved as dynastic).&lt;ref name="enache"&gt;Enache, Nicolas. ''La Descendance de Marie-Therese de Habsburg''. ICC, Paris, 1996. pp. 46-47. (French). {{ISBN|2-908003-04-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently for a marriage to be dynastic all that is needed is the consent of the head of the house and a religious marriage.&lt;ref name="petit"/&gt; On 30 November 1990 the head of the house Crown Prince [[Otto von Habsburg|Otto]] recognized the title Count or Countess von Habsburg to the issue of [[morganatic marriage]]s contracted after the dynasty ceased to reign.&lt;ref name="petit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ghda"&gt;''Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Fürstliche Häuser'' XVI.

===Archduchesses===
Although under the semi-salic succession law archduchess possess the right of succession when there are no males of any Habsburg-Lorraine branch left to succeed, during the monarchy (from 1719) upon marriage they renounced their succession rights to the Austro-Hungarian thrones in favor of the heiress of the last male ("Erbtochter" in German).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Prince Weds Archduchess |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/02/11/100350177.pdf |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=11 February 1912 |accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/ps1713.htm#Renunciations  The House Laws of the German Habsburgs, renunciations of archduchesses (Heraldica.org)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''F.C. Copenhagen Player of the Year''' award is voted for annually by the members of the official [[fan club]] for [[F.C. Copenhagen]], FCKFC, in recognition of the best overall performance by an individual player throughout the [[Association football|football]] season. Towards the end of each season, members are invited to cast their votes for this award. The winner is the player who polls the most votes. The recipient is awarded a diploma, presented on the pitch before one of the last home games of the season.

The inaugural award has existed as long as the club, and was given to [[Palle Petersen]] at the end of the club's first season.

==Winners==
Player name in bold text represents players still on the playing staff of the club.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] and [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]] influenced the park in the contemporary architectural styles of [[Rococo]] and [[Classicism]] and had an artistic synthesis of architecture and gardens constructed, whose centrepiece is the vineyard terraces and the palace of Sanssouci that crowns them.

In 1787 [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick William II]] had a new garden laid out on this site, hence the name. The park was intended to reflect the prevailing fashion for the [[English garden]], in contrast to the outmoded style of the [[Baroque]] ornamental and vegetable garden at Sanssouci.

===Albania===
{{Main|Smoking in Albania}}
A law came into effect on 30 May 2007 restricting smoking in closed public areas and outlawing the advertisement of tobacco, although the measure was reportedly poorly enforced in the country until 2013. From 2013, law enforcement has been implemented, and smoking is strictly forbidden in closed public areas, including bars, pubs, restaurants etc. If any of these places are caught allowing a customer to smoke, they are fined €2,200 and the person smoking is fined €350.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No smoking law is working this time in Albania|url=http://www.balkaneu.com/smoking-law-working-time-albania/|work=www.balkaneu.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903210500/http://www.balkaneu.com/smoking-law-working-time-albania/|archivedate=3 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Andorra===
Since 2004, smoking is prohibited in government buildings, educational facilities, hospitals, enclosed sport facilities and buses. In 2010, an increase in restrictions at restaurants, bars, and workplaces was under discussion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diariandorra.ad/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=1794 Una proposta ciutadana vol que no es pugui fumar a la feina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706062305/http://www.diariandorra.ad/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=1794 |date=6 July 2011 }} – Diari d'Andorra&lt;/ref&gt;

Andorra introduced a smoking ban in all public places on 13 December 2012. However, an exception was made for bars and restaurants, allowing special smoking rooms as long as they fulfill strict conditions: such as not serving food and drink.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/sociedad/andorra-prohibe-fumar-los-espacios-publicos-2271733 Andorra prohíbe fumar en los espacios públicos Bares y restaurantes podrán habilitar zonas para fumadores pero no podrán consumir bebida ni comida] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121216121042/http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/sociedad/andorra-prohibe-fumar-los-espacios-publicos-2271733 |date=16 December 2012 }} – ElPeriodico&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Andorra joined France and Spain in banning smoking indoors, which resulted in the first smoke free ski season in Andorra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andorra's first smoke-free ski season|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/news/Andorras-first-smoke-free-ski-season/|work=The Telegraph|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227123916/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/ski/news/Andorras-first-smoke-free-ski-season/|archivedate=27 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Andorra was one of the countries with the lowest mortality rate from cardiovascular disease, whose main causes include smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The cause-thirds of deaths in the world - micetimes.asia|url=http://micetimes.asia/the-cause-thirds-of-deaths-in-the-world/|work=micetimes.asia|date=18 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223043845/http://micetimes.asia/the-cause-thirds-of-deaths-in-the-world/|archivedate=23 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===
{{Main|Smoking in Argentina}}
Since June 1, 2011 a smoking ban in all of Argentina prohibits smoking in workplaces, all public indoor areas, schools, hospitals, museums and libraries, theatres,  and all public transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infoleg.gov.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/180000-184999/183207/norma.htm|title=National Law Nº26,687 – Article 23|publisher=|accessdate=10 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610162948/http://infoleg.gov.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/180000-184999/183207/norma.htm|archivedate=10 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, smoking is still allowed in balconies, terraces and patios. The law also included the prohibiting of advertising and sponsoring of tobacco. The fine for breaking the law is equivalent to 250 to 1,000,000 packets of the most expensive cigarettes in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Argentine law targets smoking in enclosed public spaces|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-13624384|work=BBC News|date=2 June 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111003603/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-13624384|archivedate=11 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armenia===
A law came into effect in March 2005 prohibiting smoking in hospitals, in cultural, educational and mental institutions, and on public transportation. On 1 March 2006, new rules came into effect requiring all public and private institutions, including bars and restaurants, to allow smoking only in special secluded areas. Absence of any legal sanctions against those who violate the smoking laws has made them completely ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2006/03/484fbde7-796a-4798-b4d1-b99aa705fa47.asp |title=Smoking Restrictions Widened In Armenia |publisher=Armenialiberty.org |date=1 March 2006 |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115040823/http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2006/03/484FBDE7-796A-4798-B4D1-B99AA705FA47.ASP |archivedate=15 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco advertising is prohibited in TV, radio and outdoor advertising.

* Australian Capital Territory: A restriction upon smoking in enclosed public places has been in effect since December 2006.
* Victoria: A restriction upon smoking in enclosed public places has been in effect since July 2007.

Private cigar bars and certain rooms of the Crown Casino still permitted smoking in fully enclosed areas  providing it has a proper ventilation system.
* New South Wales: A restriction upon smoking in all enclosed areas of restaurants, licensed clubs and pubs came into force in July 2007. From 1 July 2009, smoking in a car with a child under the age of 16 is against the law. The Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2008 creates a new offence of smoking in a car with a child under 16 years of age in the vehicle. A $250 on-the-spot fine applies to the driver and any passenger who breaks the law. This is enforced by NSW Police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/publichealth/healthpromotion/tobacco/smoke_free_cars.asp |title=Smoke-free Cars – NSW Department of Health |publisher=Health.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219052152/http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/publichealth/healthpromotion/tobacco/smoke_free_cars.asp |archivedate=19 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Northern Territory: Certain restrictions upon smoking in enclosed areas of restaurants, licensed clubs and pubs came into force on 2 January 2010.
*Norfolk Island: Smoking is banned in all government buildings, tour buses, taxis and flights to and from the island. There is no law on smoking in restaurants but many are smokefree, however, they often have a dedicated smoking room for people that wish to smoke. Smoking is permitted in all bars and licensed premises. Resorts and motels have smoking rooms and areas for smokers.

===Austria===
Austrian law limits or bans smoking in certain areas:
* Smoking is prohibited in all enclosed public spaces, with certain exceptions for eating and drinking establishments. Smoking in the workplace can be permitted if no employee working in the enclosed space objects.
* A January 2009 law mandates that all restaurants, bars, discos, and pubs larger than 50 m² must either be non-smoking or introduce separate smoking rooms.

===Bhutan===
{{Main|Tobacco Control Act of Bhutan 2010}}
Following a resolution of the 87th session of the National Assembly on 17 December 2004, a national prohibition upon the sale of tobacco and tobacco products went into effect, but importing limited tobacco was still permitted subject to very heavy taxes.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate Magazine]]'': [http://www.slate.com/id/2112449/ The First Nonsmoking Nation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301005049/http://slate.com/id/2112449 |date=1 March 2009 }} by Eric Weiner&lt;/ref&gt; Smoking in all public places in Bhutan became illegal on 22 February 2005. It thus became the first nation in the world to outlaw this practice outright.

The Tobacco Control Act of Bhutan was enacted by [[parliament of Bhutan|parliament]] on June 16, 2010.&lt;ref name=TCA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nab.gov.bt/downloadsact/Dzo76.pdf |format=PDF |title=Tobacco Control Act of Bhutan, 2010 |publisher=[[Government of Bhutan]] |date=2010-06-16 |accessdate=2011-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706162944/http://www.nab.gov.bt/downloadsact/Dzo76.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It regulates tobacco and tobacco products, banning the cultivation, harvesting, production, and sale of [[tobacco]] and [[tobacco products]] in Bhutan. The act also mandates that the [[government of Bhutan]] provide counseling and treatment to facilitate [[smoking cessation|tobacco cessation]]. Premised on the physical health and well-being of the Bhutanese people – important elements of [[Gross National Happiness]] – the Tobacco Control Act recognizes the harmful effects of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke on both spiritual and social health.

The consumption of tobacco is not altogether prohibited in Bhutan, though it is largely banned in places of public accommodation. The Act largely targets [[smoking]] in particular, though all forms of tobacco are subject to the Act. The Tobacco Control Act establishes [[smoking ban|non-smoking]] areas: commercial centers including markets, hotel lobbies, restaurants, and bars; recreation centers such as discothèques, cinemas, and playing fields; institutions and offices, both public and private; public gatherings and public spaces such as festivals, taxi stands, and [[Paro Airport|the airport]]; all public transportation; and any other places declared by the Tobacco Control Board. The board also has the authority to designate smoking areas in public. Smoking areas are permitted in non-public areas of hotels (i.e. smoking floors or smoking rooms) at the discretion of the patron.

The Act prohibits the cultivation, harvest, manufacture, supply, and distribution of tobacco, as well as the manufacture, supply, distribution, sale, and purchase of tobacco products within Bhutan. The Act allows individuals to import tobacco and tobacco products for personal consumption subject to limits set by the Tobacco Control Board, as well as duties and taxes. Those who bring their own tobacco or tobacco products into Bhutan must bear{{clarifyme|date=December 2017}} proof of taxation, may only bring goods that display required health warnings, and must not bring goods that promote tobacco by means that are false, misleading, or likely to create an erroneous impression of its characteristics, health effects, or hazards. (e.g. descriptors such as "light" or "mild") The Act totally prohibits tobacco advertisement, promotion and sponsorship, restricting the appearance of tobacco in domestic videos and movies to educational clips produced for the purpose of health promotion.

{{Main|Smoking in Canada}}
In [[Smoking in Canada|Canada]], indoor smoking is restricted by all territories and provinces and by the [[Government of Canada|Canadian federal government]].  As of 2010, smoking bans within each of these jurisdictions are mostly consistent, despite the separate development of legislation by each. The federal government's workplace smoking ban applies only to the federal government and to federally regulated businesses, such as airports. In Ontario and Alberta, smoking is banned in all workplaces except designated areas. Smoking rooms are available in select hotels and motels in most jurisdictions. Individual communities have bylaws restricting where individuals may smoke. In several Canadian cities smoking has now been banned on municipally owned property including public parks. Manitoba, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Alberta, and Ontario have also prohibited smoking within vehicles with children under 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/265625|title=Smoking Ban Starts Wednesday For Ontario Cars That Carry Children|date=21 January 2009|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820214418/http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/265625|archivedate=20 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/drivers/smoking_law.html |title=Province of Manitoba &amp;#124; Effective July 15, it's the law |publisher=Gov.mb.ca |date=15 July 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104064009/http://www.gov.mb.ca/drivers/smoking_law.html |archivedate=4 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the ban was not very effective as a study revealed that more than 50% of the population are being exposed to smoking in daily life. In 2014, Cuban authorities said that they are working on passing further anti-smoking legislation. Such legislation will prevent the sale of cigarettes to people under the age of eighteen. The new legislation will also require tobacco companies to add graphic warnings on the packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cuba to Pass Stricter Anti-Smoking Legislation - Havana Times.org|url=http://www.havanatimes.org/?p=107601|work=www.havanatimes.org|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026110447/http://www.havanatimes.org/?p=107601|archivedate=26 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there is a law in force that restricts smoking in some public places such as institutions, hospitals, bus stops and other public service stops, in May 2017 restriction expanded to prohibit smoking in restaurants, bars and clubs. In June 2009 the parliament approved a bill ostensibly regulating smoking in public places. However, at the time this regulation only required bars and restaurants to post a sign saying whether smoking was allowed, not allowed, or whether there are separate rooms for smokers and non-smokers in the establishment.
In February 2011, the popular initiative "stop kouření" announced, that 115,000 people had signed their petition demanding a ban on smoking in restaurants and denouncing the country's high cancer rate, poor rating concerning tobacco control and possible corruption of members of the Czech parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.praguepost.com/opinion/7561-petition-pushes-for-czech-smoking-ban.html|title=Petition pushes for Czech smoking ban – Prague Post|publisher=|accessdate=10 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909155822/http://www.praguepost.com/opinion/7561-petition-pushes-for-czech-smoking-ban.html|archivedate=9 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 9, 2016, the Chamber of Deputies passed a law that bans smoking in all restaurants and bars.

===Finland===
{{Main|Smoking in Finland}}
Smoking has been restricted in indoor public areas and workplaces from 1 March 1995, and permitted only in specially designated [[smoking room]]s; restaurants were included in 2007. Legislation aimed towards voluntary reduction of [[second-hand smoke]] was enacted, but was not successful; few establishments installed effective ventilation systems. Dividing a restaurant into a smoking and non-smoking section was also an ineffective measure. As a result, smoking has since been prohibited in all indoor public and workplaces, including bars, cafes, clubs and restaurants, from 1 June 2007, except in some places permitted a transition period of up to two years. Smoking was permitted in trains in designated smoking booths until June 2013, when it was banned by the national railway company. Smoking in bars is still allowed in enclosed smoking booths, where it is not permitted to serve or consume food or drink.  Many smaller bars have not been able to build such smoking booths and patrons must smoke outside.

As of early 2010, Finland's government has openly considered planning gradual moves towards prohibiting smoking completely.&lt;ref name="ban all smoking"&gt;{{cite web

Casinos and bars bigger than 300&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; were given eight months to apply the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.us-winston.com/greece-to-ban-smoking-in-all-indoor-public-places/ |title=Greece to ban smoking in all indoor public places &amp;#124; US Winston Online Club |publisher=Us-winston.com |date=1 June 2010 |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717174253/http://www.us-winston.com/greece-to-ban-smoking-in-all-indoor-public-places/ |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Enforcement of the law is reportedly weak, with most owners of coffee shops, pubs, and restaurants continuing to permit smoking, especially at outdoor sitting areas.
In [[Santorini]], there appears to be no enforcement.

===Guinea===
Guinea has a smoking ban in place for certain public places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tobaccocontrollaws.org/legislation/country/guinea/summary|title=Guinea Details – Tobacco Control Laws|website=www.tobaccocontrollaws.org|accessdate=4 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205093124/https://www.tobaccocontrollaws.org/legislation/country/guinea/summary|archivedate=5 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guatemala===
Guatemala has implemented a comprehensive smoking ban covering all types of places and institutions. In December 2008 the Guatemalan Congress approved Decree 74-2008 and it became effective in February 2009. This law restricts smoking in all work-places including health-care facilities,  governmental facilities, schools, universities, airports, bars and restaurants. However, two years after the law's implementation enforcement has been deficient. Governments are facing pressures to permit work-place smoking once more by local tobacco companies.&lt;ref&gt;Decreto 74-2008, Ley de Creación de los Ambientes Libres de Humo de Tabaco, El Congreso de la República de Guatemala Diciembre del 2008 url={{cite web |url=http://www.congreso.gob.gt/archivos/decretos/2008/gtdcx74-2008.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306092052/http://www.congreso.gob.gt/archivos/decretos/2008/gtdcx74-2008.pdf |archivedate=6 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guernsey===
Smoke-free ordinances were introduced at different times in the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]], a [[British Islands|British]] [[Crown dependency]]. Smoking was restricted in all enclosed public places in the island of [[Guernsey]], including workplaces, bars, clubs and restaurants, on 2 July 2006, under the ''"Smoking (Prohibition in Public Places and Workplaces) (Guernsey) Law 2005"''. Anyone who breaks the law, upon conviction, could be fined up to the maximum of £1000 (~€1150, ~$1470). Smoking is allowed anywhere outside and in whatever company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.gg/ccm/navigation/health---social-services/environmental-health---pollution-regulation/smoke-free-guernsey/ Information about the Guernsey smoking ban] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928033314/http://www.gov.gg/ccm/navigation/health---social-services/environmental-health---pollution-regulation/smoke-free-guernsey/ |date=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Alderney]], the [[States of Alderney]] passed a smoke-free law with the President's casting vote on 13 January 2010; the legislation came into force at 4&amp;nbsp;am on 1 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alderneyjournal.com/readnews.php?id=1145 |title=Alderney Journal |publisher=Alderney Journal |date=14 January 2010 |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707104350/http://www.alderneyjournal.com/readnews.php?id=1145 |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honduras===
Honduras strictly banned smoking in all indoors places in Feb 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/22/smoking-ban-in-honduras-_n_826490.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Honduras' Smoking Ban Takes It To The Next Level | date=22 February 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530115432/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/22/smoking-ban-in-honduras-_n_826490.html | archivedate=30 May 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It carries fines of $311 per incident, with police involvement, and fines up to $6,000 for businesses with possibility of being forced to close, and has been strongly enforced, even in provincial areas, including in large bars and nightclubs.  Billiards areas at night continue to allow smokers.

===Hong Kong===
{{Main|Smoking in Hong Kong}}
[[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Hong Kong]] has seen all public smoking restricted from 1 January 2007 under the [[Hong Kong Government|government]]'s revised [[Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance]] (Cap. 371), first enacted in 1982 with several amendments subsequently. The latest amendment enlarges the smoke-free regulations to include indoor workplaces, most public places including restaurants, Internet cafés, public lavatories, beaches and most public parks. Some bars, karaoke parlors, saunas and nightclubs were exempt until 1 July 2009. Smoke-free regulations pertaining to lifts, public transport, cinemas, concert halls, airport terminals and escalators had been phased in between 1982 and 1997. The smoke-free requirements in shopping centres, department stores, supermarkets, banks, game arcades have been in place since July 1998.

An anomaly exists on cross-border trains between Hong Kong and mainland China as they are operated jointly between MTR Corporation and China Railways, of whom the latter allows smoking in the restaurant car and in the vestibules at the end of the cars, but not in the seating area.

Any person who smokes or carries a lighted tobacco product in a statutory no smoking area commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a maximum fine of HK$5,000. Unlike many other jurisdictions, Hong Kong does not place the onus on licensees of liquor licensed premises to enforce smoke-free regulations bans with subsequent loss of licence for non compliance. A 2009 law provides for fixed-penalty arrangement (HK$1,500) for smoking, on a par with that for littering. At the same time smoking was to be prohibited in designated public transport interchanges, but the government has yet to clarify how it will enforce this against non Hong Kong ID card-holders and tourists, since the offender has 21 days after the ticket issue to pay up.

The overall daily smoking rate in Hong Kong is 11.8% (HK Department of Census and Statistics Household Thematic Survey 36) with 25% of males smoking whereas in China 63% of males smoke.

Smoking in Iran has been banned in all public places since 2007. This includes all state bodies, hotels, restaurants. The law also bans the smoking of traditional waterpipes (ghalyun) which were common in Iranian tea houses. A smoking ban for all car drivers nationwide was implemented in March 2006, and although offenders can face fines, the ban has been widely ignored. The sale of tobacco products to anyone under the age of 18 is prohibited and is punishable by the confiscation of the vendor's tobacco products and a fine.

{{Main|Smoking in Ireland}}
[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] became the first country in the world to institute a nationwide comprehensive smoke-free workplaces law on 29 March 2004. Prior to this, comprehensive smoke-free law was instituted, smoking had already been outlawed (1988) in public buildings, hospitals, pharmacies, schools, banking halls, cinemas, public hairdressing premises, restaurant kitchens, part of all restaurants, on public aircraft and buses, and some trains (Intercity trains provided smokers' carriages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-sheesh.com/ireland-work-place-ban|title=Ireland Work Place Ban|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818091718/http://www.e-sheesh.com/ireland-work-place-ban|archivedate=18 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This also included Europe's first fully smoke-free prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iomtoday.co.im/ViewArticle.aspx?SectionID=870&amp;articleid=2015621 Exact Date Set For Smoking Ban – Isle Of Man Today] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929112057/http://www.iomtoday.co.im/ViewArticle.aspx?SectionID=870&amp;articleid=2015621 |date=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
In Israel, smoking is prohibited  in public  enclosed places or commercial areas via several laws:
particularly, since 1983, the "Israel Clean Air Act" ([[:he:חוק אוויר נקי לישראל|חוק אוויר נקי לישראל]] (in Hebrew)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law for the restriction of smoking in public places|publisher=(in Hebrew)|url=http://www.linshom.com/law/public.htm|accessdate=21 November 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112141608/http://www.linshom.com/law/public.htm|archivedate=12 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was amended in 2007 so that owners are held accountable for smoking in premises under their responsibility.  The second means by which smoking is regulated in Israel is via the environmental hazard law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avir-naki.com/Laws/%D7%97%D7%95%D7%A7%20%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%AA%20%D7%9E%D7%A4%D7%92%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%9D.doc|title=(in Hebrew)|publisher=|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and via criminal law smoking (or the introduction of second-hand smoke) may even be considered an assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.1439141|title=בימ"ש: עישון במסעדה הוא תקיפה ועילה לפיטורים|first=כרמל בן|last=צור|date=3 September 2007|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2016|via=Haaretz|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406084342/http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.1439141|archivedate=6 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avir-naki.com/Laws/%D7%97%D7%95%D7%A7%20%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9F.doc the criminal act law defines smoking as an assault] (in Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

The restrictions include all commercial entities such as lavatories, office buildings, gyms, cafés, restaurants, discos, pubs and bars, and it is illegal for the owners of such places to put ashtrays anywhere inside enclosed spaces. Also, owners of public places must display "no smoking" signs and prevent visitors from smoking. They can also designate a well-ventilated and completely separate area for smokers, as long as the non-smokers' area does not fall below 75% of the whole area. The fine for owners of public places is [[New Israeli sheqel|₪]] 5,000 (around US$1400) and for smokers – ₪ 1000.
In spite of all of this, the smoke-free law has not met with 100% compliance and smoking is still encountered in some pubs, bars and clubs. In Israel, a 2011 law restricts smoking in railway stations and at bus stops, and prohibits the sale of tobacco from automated vending machines.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} An individual may call the police in cases of smoking in a restricted environment and can also sue (via the citizen's court) the smoking entity (i.e., both the person smoking and the facility that allowed smoking to occur).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.articles.co.il/article/24611/%D7%90%D7%93%D7%9D%20%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%A4%D7%92%D7%A2%20%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9F%20%D7%A4%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%91%D7%99%20%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%90%D7%99%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%92%D7%99%D7%A9%20%D7%92%D7%9D%20%D7%AA%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%94%20%D7%90%D7%96%D7%A8%D7%97%D7%99%D7%AA%20%D7%A0%D7%92%D7%93%20%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%A9%D7%9F passive smoker is allowed to sue smokers when he can prove damages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720050325/http://www.articles.co.il/article/24611/%D7%90%D7%93%D7%9D%20%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%A4%D7%92%D7%A2%20%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9F%20%D7%A4%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%91%D7%99%20%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%90%D7%99%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%92%D7%99%D7%A9%20%D7%92%D7%9D%20%D7%AA%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%94%20%D7%90%D7%96%D7%A8%D7%97%D7%99%D7%AA%20%D7%A0%D7%92%D7%93%20%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%A9%D7%9F |date=20 July 2012 }} (in Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3584649,00.html|title=תקדים: מעשנת תפצה אדם שנפגע מעישון פסיבי|date=19 August 2008|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2016|via=Ynet|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114221747/http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3584649,00.html|archivedate=14 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120724202309/http://www.avir-naki.com/Verdicts_Summary.aspx aggregation of verdicts against smokers in Israel](in Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, special smoking rooms are allowed. In such areas food can be served, but they are subjected to strict conditions: they need to be separately ventilated, with high air replacement rates; their air pressure must constantly be lower than the pressure in the surrounding rooms; they must be equipped with automatic sliding doors to prevent smoke from spreading to tobacco-free areas; they may occupy at most 50% of the establishment. Only 1% of all public establishments have opted for setting up a smoking room.
Smoking is also forbidden in all enclosed workplaces – this includes also trains and underground stations.
It is, indeed, permitted to smoke outdoors, which means that since Italy has sunny weather more than half of the year, people can still smoke at restaurants and bars as long as they sit at the outside tables and the establishment permits it.

===Jamaica===
{{Main|Smoking in Jamaica}}
Smoking is not permitted in the airport or generally indoors at shops and malls and places of business.  However smoking is usually permitted in bars, discos and other licensed premises that serve alcohol indoors, but not in restaurants or casinos.  Smoking is often permitted in tourist resorts in places that would be typically considered indoors in North America (roof but no walls), but this does not apply to indoor air-conditioned places.  Jamaica has no national smoke-free law, but most places have a no-smoking sign if smoking is not permitted and it is open-air with a roof.  Most places that permit smoking indoors will have ashtrays on the table to signify that it is permitted.  However, if there is a sandbox at the entrance of a building then it usually signals that the place you are entering does not permit indoor smoking.

Effective 15 July 2013, Jamaica's Health Minister banned smoking in all covered public places on the island.

===Japan===
{{Main|Smoking in Japan}}
Although there are no consistent nationwide smoke-free regulations in Japan, and all moves to introduce such reforms are strongly opposed by the powerful [[Lobbying|lobby]] groups, there are a growing number of local ordinances restricting smoking. Smoking is forbidden on the streets of the [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda]], [[Shinagawa, Tokyo|Shinagawa]], [[Shinjuku, Tokyo|Shinjuku]] and [[Nakano, Tokyo|Nakano]] wards of Tokyo&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2292007.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Smoking ban on Tokyo's streets | date=2 October 2002 | accessdate=4 April 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525020519/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2292007.stm | archivedate=25 May 2006 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; for reasons of child safety (not health). Smoking is prohibited on public transport and subway platforms, while above ground train station platforms typically have smoking areas. Unlike Tokyo wards' ability to fine people for smoking on the streets, public transportation companies don't have the authority to enforce no smoking rules. Due to this inability, there are smokers not respecting no smoking rules, in some cases on a very frequent basis such as at Minami Urawa station in Saitama Prefecture, adjacent to Tokyo. [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] has implemented in April 2010 the nation's first prefecture-wide smoking ban, banning smoking in public facilities, including hospitals, schools and government offices. The ordinance requires large restaurants and hotels to choose whether to become nonsmoking or create separate smoking areas, while [[mah-jong]] and [[pachinko]] parlours, restaurants with floor space of up to 100 sq. meters and hotels of up to 700 sq. metres are merely required to "make efforts" to reduce [[second-hand smoke]]. Another Kanagawa ordinance to restrict smoking at swimming beaches was expected to be implemented in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100402a5.html |title=Kanagawa enforces first antismoking code &amp;#124; The Japan Times Online |publisher=Search.japantimes.co.jp |date=2 April 2010 |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607134219/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100402a5.html |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although still relatively few, there are a growing number of private businesses implementing voluntary smoking restrictions bans in restaurants, taxis, buildings and bars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wa-shoi.com/?page=100595 |title=Wa-Shoi.com |publisher=En.wa-shoi.com |date= |accessdate=14 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815164615/http://en.wa-shoi.com/?page=100595 |archivedate=15 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/7083.php |title=Noose tightening on Japanese smokers |publisher=Medicalnewstoday.com |date= |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611054406/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/7083.php |archivedate=11 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Japan experienced pressure from the International Olympics Committee (IOC) to implement smoking bans in all public areas to offer for healthy sporting environment.

===Jersey===
Smoking is restricted in public places in [[Jersey]] (a [[British Islands|British]] [[Crown dependency]]).

In pursuance of this law, smoking was banned on public transport by the ''Smoking (Public Transport) (Jersey) Regulations 1982''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jerseylegalinfo.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce/consolidated/superseded/20/20.825.30_restrictiononsmoking(publictransport)regs.1982_revisededition_31august2004.htm |title=Jersey Regulations |publisher=Jerseylegalinfo.je |date=20 March 2009 |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090703/http://www.jerseylegalinfo.je/law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2Fconsolidated%2Fsuperseded%2F20%2F20.825.30_restrictiononsmoking%28publictransport%29regs.1982_revisededition_31august2004.htm |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enforcing the smoke-free law appears to be somewhat problematic as far as public bus services are concerned. While smoking by passengers on the public bus services was never an issue, bus operators on duty were being consistently reported as smoking inside the bus vehicles and persistently ignoring requests by the passengers not to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.respublika-kaz.info/news/society/9121/ |title=Алматинские потомки японских камикадзе – Общество – Информационно-аналитический портал РЕСПУБЛИКА |publisher=Respublika-kaz.info |date=22 May 2010 |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227195712/http://www.respublika-kaz.info/news/society/9121/ |archivedate=27 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latvia===
As of 1 May 2010, smoking has been completely outlawed in restaurants and bars. Previously non-smoking areas had to be larger than half of the total area of the establishment. In addition, more than half of the summer terraces of bars and restaurants are required to be smoke-free. Smoking is also restricted in parks and for ten metres around entrances of public buildings as well as public transportation stops. Smoking on public transportation, except for ferries, is also forbidden.

In late 2011 some municipalities, for example, [[Ozolnieku novads]], prohibited smoking on balconies and by open windows in apartment blocks and others multi-storey buildings.

In late 2014 amendments to the law considering smoking ban took effect and included whole areas surrounding educational institutions, apartment building balconies, entrances and staircases as prohibited areas where smoking is not allowed. Also additions to law states that every person, located in the vicinity of the smoker, now are given rights to ask the smoker to extinguish the cigarette at once upon request. Smoking in vicinity of underage children is now classified as child abuse, and punished respectively.

===Liechtenstein===
There have been several smoking bans put into place. These include the restriction of smoking in government buildings, places of employment, and all forms of public transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rauchverbotweltweit.de/smokingban.php?land=Liechtenstein|title=Smoking ban in Liechtenstein|last=|first=|date=|website=en.rauchverbotweltweit.de|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170514185214/http://en.rauchverbotweltweit.de/smokingban.php?land=Liechtenstein|archivedate=14 May 2017|deadurl=no|accessdate=11 November 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March of 2009, Liechtenstein held a public vote to ban smoking in restaurants.

===Lithuania===
Smoking has been restricted in restaurants, bars, places where food is served, clubs (except for special cigar and pipe clubs), and nightclubs since 1 January 2007. Furthermore, smoking on public transportation is forbidden (except on long-distance trains with special facilities), and workplaces inside a building (except designated places). It is also illegal to smoke inside public halls where non-smoking people might have to breathe tobacco fumes. The law is well respected (at least in the largest cities) but smoking in hallways and staircases is still common. The age restriction is 18 years old.

===Nepal===
Nepal Government implemented a smoke-free law covering public places, effective from 7 August 2011. The Tobacco (Control and Regulatory) Act restricts smoking in airports, hotels, restaurants, government offices and other public places. The act also makes it obligatory for tobacco product manufacturers to ensure that product packs carry graphic warnings about the adverse effects of smoking and the harmful ingredients the products contain. The warnings should cover at least 75% of the total pack area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ITC-subsidiary-faces-double-whammy-in-Nepal/articleshow/9684569.cms |work=The Times Of India |title=ITC subsidiary faces double whammy in Nepal – The Times of India |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822134006/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ITC-subsidiary-faces-double-whammy-in-Nepal/articleshow/9684569.cms |archivedate=22 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The act also prohibits sales of tobacco products to pregnant women and people below the age of 18.

The Tobacco Control and Regulation Act-2068 was signed by President Dr. Ram Baran Yadav on 29 April.

The Act includes provisions for officials to inspect implementation of the new law. A fine of Rs 100-100,000 will be slapped on anyone who smokes in public places or sells tobacco products to people below 18 or to pregnant women.

===Netherlands===
The smoking of tobacco is prohibited by law in all public buildings and on public transport. On railway platforms, the limited smoking areas are not enforced.  As of 1 January 2004, every employee has the right to work in a smoke-free environment. Tobacco legislation states that employers are obliged to take measures to ensure that employees are able to carry out their work without being bothered or affected by secondhand smoke from other people. On 1 January 2008, [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]] became the first completely smoke-free European airport{{Citation needed|reason=Surely Irish airports were smoke-free in 2004?|date=September 2016}}; however, since August 2008; smoking has been permitted in designated smoking rooms. Since 1 July 2008, the smoke-free law has also applied to all hotels, restaurants, bars and cafes in the Netherlands. Separate smoking rooms are allowed in hospitality facilities as long as no food or beverage is served there, although the court banned them as of February 2018. All forms of tobacco advertising, promotion or sponsorship are prohibited. Smoking of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] (including [[hashish]]) in coffeeshops is permitted as long as it is not mixed with tobacco. In 2010, the new government spoke out against the effects of the smoke-free law upon small catering businesses. The law was widely ignored with statistics showing that around 41% of bars and discos had flouted it.&lt;ref name="BT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/smoking-ban-uturn-by-dutch-government-14995132.html |title=Smoking ban U-turn by Dutch government, Belfast Telegraph, 4&amp;nbsp;November 2010 |publisher=Belfasttelegraph.co.uk |date=4 November 2010 |accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 November 2010, the new government lifted the smoke-free regulations for bars of 70 square metres or less, on the condition that the bar did not employ any staff other than the owner.&lt;ref name="BT"/&gt; Around 3,000 of the 5,500 bars in the Netherlands are staffed by the owner alone.&lt;ref name="BT"/&gt;

On 12 February 2013, the Dutch [[Tweede Kamer|lower house]] agreed on a total ban in the hospitality sector with 77-73, with no exception for smaller, owner-operated bars. Special smoking rooms without service were not affected by the change in the law.

Since 1 January 2017, smoking rooms are no longer to be allowed in city hall and other municipal buildings of Amsterdam and within a 20-meter distance of these buildings.&lt;ref name="AMS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/4/AMSTERDAM/article/detail/4238510/2016/02/04/Amsterdam-moet-minder-roken.dhtml |title=Amsterdam moet minder roken, Parool, 4&amp;nbsp;February 2016 |publisher=Parool.nl |date=4 February 2016 |accessdate=14 February 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216120408/http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/4/AMSTERDAM/article/detail/4238510/2016/02/04/Amsterdam-moet-minder-roken.dhtml |archivedate=16 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
{{Main|Smoking in New Zealand}}
[[File:'Cancer', 1958 (17909231579).jpg|thumb|Prevention poster, New Zealand Department of Health, 1958.]]

The first building in the world to have a smoke-free policy was the [[Old Government Buildings (Wellington)|Old Government Building]] in [[Wellington, New Zealand]], in 1876. This was over concerns about the threat of fire, as it is the second largest wooden building in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Government Buildings|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/historic/by-region/wellington-kapiti/wellington/government-buildings/|publisher=Department of Conservation|accessdate=3 February 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210022222/http://doc.govt.nz/conservation/historic/by-region/wellington-kapiti/wellington/government-buildings/|archivedate=10 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand passed an amendment to the [[Smoke-free Environments Act 1990]] law on 3 December 2003 (effective in 2004) that covers all indoor public workplaces and inside hospitality venues (pubs, bars, restaurants and casinos). Studies have shown very high levels of compliance with the law. Also the air quality inside hospitality venues is very good compared to similar settings in other countries where smoking is still permitted. In New Zealand, tobacco and tobacco products cannot be sold or supplied to anyone under 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moh.govt.nz/smokefreelaw |title=Smokefree Law |publisher=Moh.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129001044/http://www.moh.govt.nz/smokefreelaw |archivedate=29 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outdoor smoke-free laws cover the grounds of all schools, the grounds of some hospitals, stadiums and two university campuses (Massey University, and the [[University of Auckland]], in 2010). Victoria University of Wellington has restricted smoking rules with specified areas where one may smoke. The government has not moved to restrict smoking in cars but has run mass media campaigns that promote smoke-free cars and homes.

There are also increasing numbers of local councils implementing educative smokefree policies. South Taranaki District Council was the first. In May 2005 the Council made its playgrounds, parks and swimming pools smokefree, as well as ensuring that all Council events held in South Taranaki parks were to be promoted as smoke-free events and in May 2006 the [[Upper Hutt]] city council followed suit and declared all  "open areas for which members of the public gather" (i.e., parks, playgrounds, pools) smoke-free however this by-law lacks in enforcement other than a polite request by city council officials and [[Security Guards]] (rather than confiscation and court penalty).  At least 19 of New Zealand's other Councils have followed suit. (Source: www.smokefreecouncils.org.nz).

On 5 September 2007, [[Action on Smoking and Health]] (ASH) New Zealand called for the removal of tobacco from sale by 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ash.org.nz/index.php?pa_id=4&amp;news_id=159&amp;expand_section=1 Welcome to ASH – Action on Smoking and Health] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610024556/http://www.ash.org.nz/index.php?pa_id=4&amp;news_id=159&amp;expand_section=1 |date=10 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government wants to be smokefree by 2025.&lt;ref name="stuff.co.nz"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jody O'Callaghan |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/taranaki-daily-news/features/6822327/Running-out-of-puff |title=Running out of puff |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date= |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, a pack of cigarettes is still cheap, costing about 27 pesos (54 cents) and more than 74 percent of that is taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Fellipe Villamormay |publisher=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/world/asia/rodrigo-duterte-smoking-ban-philippines.html?mcubz=0 |title=Duterte Orders Strict Smoking Ban in Philippines, and Asks Citizens to Help |date=18 May 2017 |accessdate=1 August 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801170317/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/world/asia/rodrigo-duterte-smoking-ban-philippines.html?mcubz=0 |archivedate=1 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
Smoking is prohibited in schools, hospitals or other medical facilities and public transport (including the vehicles such as train or bus and bus stops, train stations, etc. within the 10 metres radius).

In March 2010, an attempt to introduce a complete smokefree law failed.

Since 1 January 2011, it is forbidden to smoke in indoor workplaces, and all public indoor spaces, including public offices, museums, bars, cafés, discos, shops or restaurants smaller than 100 square metres. In larger restaurants enclosed smoking areas are permitted, provided they are physically separated and properly ventilated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Agnes Sekowski, The Krakow Post |url=http://sofiaecho.com/2010/11/09/990229_poland-smoking-ban-economics |title=Poland: smoking ban economics – Foreign |publisher=The Sofia Echo |date=9 November 2010 |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108075806/http://sofiaecho.com/2010/11/09/990229_poland-smoking-ban-economics |archivedate=8 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smoking is also prohibited in venues for cultural and sporting events.

===Portugal===
Portuguese Law 37/2007 (in force since 1 January 2008) governs various aspects of the consumption, sale and control of tobacco in Portugal, and lists a large number of enclosed spaces where smoking is not permitted, including such obvious cases as schools, hospitals and theatres. The law states that exceptions to the no-smoking rule may be made in the cases, inter alia, of enclosed eating and drinking establishments (i.e. restaurants, cafes and bars) not frequented by under-18s if the smoking area is physically separated from the non-smoking area or where ventilation and air extraction systems directed towards the exterior are effective to the point of preventing smoke from entering the non-smoking area, and that in the case of establishments with a floor area of more than 100 square metres no more than 40% (if physically separated) or 30% otherwise may be designated a smoking area.
In effect, restaurants are almost always smoke-free as are most cafes whose trade is mainly for food, whereas in bars the law is ignored by customers and bar owners alike. A study published in 2011 by the Ministry of Health showed 90% compliance with the law in establishments with a total smoking ban, but only 50% compliance in establishments where smoking is partly or wholly permitted (i.e., most bars).

===Puerto Rico===
The Law No. 40 from 1993, the ''Law to Regulate the Smoking Practice in Public Places'', and its later 1996 amendment Law 133, regulate smoking in private and public places. The most recent modification established in [2 March 2007], Law 66, amended articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 11 of Law Num. 40, forbids this practice inside jails, pubs, restaurants (including open-air terraces with one or more employees), bars, casinos, workplaces, educational institutions, cars with children under age 13 and most public places. Smoking sections are not allowed. Fines start at $250.

===Qatar===
The capital of Qatar, [[Doha]], restricted smoking in public or closed areas     in 2002. The law discouraged shopkeepers from selling to under-aged people and completely banned tobacco advertisements in the country and punished violaters with hefty fines. However, the law is openly flouted especially by the youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=192251&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=36&amp;parent_id=16 |title=Gulf Times – Qatar’s top-selling English daily newspaper – Qatar |publisher=Gulf-times.com |date= |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607103719/http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=192251&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=36&amp;parent_id=16 |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
Russia had been highly tolerant of smoking for a long time, with almost no regulation. However, the Soviet Union had approved countrywide campaigns against smoking. &lt;ref name="Cooper1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=R|title=Smoking in the Soviet Union.|journal=[[BMJ (Clin Res Ed)]]|volume=285|issue=6341|year=1982|pages=549–551|issn=0959-8138|doi=10.1136/bmj.285.6341.549|url=http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC1499048/pdf/bmjcred00621-0025.pdf|pmid=6809168|pmc=1499048|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The law "on the protection of the population from the harmful effects of cigarette smoke and the consequences of tobacco consumption" has passed the third and final vote in the State Duma and has been effective partly from 1 July 2013 and has completely from 1 July 2014. 
Starting 1 June 2013, smoking in workplaces, on aircraft, trains and municipal transport as well as in schools, hospitals, cultural institutions and government buildings has been restricted and tobacco advertising and sponsorship forbidden. Graphic warnings have become compulsory. 
Starting 1 June 2014, smoking has also been prohibited in restaurants and cafés.
Smokers will also be fined for smoking within a distance of 15 meters in front of entrances of subway stations, the airport or in children playgrounds and parks, as well as places and squares that attract many people.

===Saudi Arabia===
Saudi Arabia had almost no restrictions against smoking until 2010 when the [[Council of Ministers of Saudi Arabia|Council of Ministers]] urged the [[General Authority of Civil Aviation]] (GACA) to restrict smoking at all airports and their facilities in the Kingdom, and strict rules were imposed. It also advised GACA to impose a fine of SR200 (US$53) on people who violate the new regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=News |first=Arab |url=http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article70606.ece |title=Smoking banned at airports |publisher=Arab News |date= |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627124808/http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article70606.ece |archivedate=27 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many commercial buildings and work places banned smoking at offices in an attempt to stop smoking in public places. In addition, [[King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals]] in [[Dhahran]], for instance, launched a program in 2010 to make their university smoke-free, and [[Umm al-Qura University]] in [[Mecca]] launched a campaign with the same title{{clarify|date=November 2015}} in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article571987.ece] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209083100/http://arabnews.com/saudiarabia/article571987.ece|date=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, [[King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre]] in [[Riyadh]] banned people from smoking in and around its buildings, the first such move in the country. The hospital implemented fines of SR200 for violations.

From 6 June 2016, smoking is prohibited in the vicinity of religious, educational, health, sport and cultural institutions, social and charity institutions. Smoking is also prohibited at private and government offices, factories, banks, public transport facilities, in areas for manufacturing and processing food products and drinks, petrol, gas and fuel distribution systems, warehouses, elevators and restrooms, in addition to several other public places. Violating the law is punishable by a fine of SAR 200, which increases for repeat violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saudigazette.com.sa/saudi-arabia/smoking-ban-public-areas-takes-effect/|title=Smoking ban in public areas takes effect – Saudi Gazette|first=Sadiq|last=Hussain|date=13 June 2016|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617191324/http://saudigazette.com.sa/saudi-arabia/smoking-ban-public-areas-takes-effect/|archivedate=17 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Serbia===
The Serbian Parliament passed a new law on public smoking in November 2010. It forbids smoking in every indoor working or public space, and any outdoor space that is a functional part of a facility connected with health care, education, or child care. This law prescribes very high fines for employers and restaurant owners who do not post smoking ban notifications. Outlets (bars, cafés, restaurants, night clubs etc.) smaller than 80 sq m can choose whether to ban smoking or not, and outlets larger than this margin have to have divided areas for smokers and non-smokers.

===Singapore===
{{Main|Smoking in Singapore}}
[[Image:Singapore-smoking-area.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A sign in Singapore to indicate that smoking is allowed]]
Smoking was restricted in [[hawker centre]]s, coffee-shops, cafes and fast-food outlets beginning 1 July 2006. For establishments with an outdoor area, 10–20% of the area can be set aside for smoking, although they would have to be clearly marked to avoid confusion. Gradually, the regulations have been extended to bus interchanges and shelters, public toilets and public swimming complexes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://app.mewr.gov.sg/view.asp?cid=168&amp;nid=168&amp;id=SAS765 Smoking Ban in Singapore] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003024903/http://app.mewr.gov.sg/view.asp?cid=168&amp;nid=168&amp;id=SAS765 |date=3 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2007, the regulations were extended to entertainment nightspots. The rule allows for construction of designated smoking rooms that can take up to 10% of the total indoor space.

On 1 January 2009, the regulations were extended to all children's playgrounds, exercise areas, markets, underground and multi-storey carparks, ferry terminals and jetties. Coverage was also extended to non-air conditioned areas in offices, factories, shops, shopping complexes and lift lobbies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/332003/1/.html |title=Smoking ban to be extended to more areas from January 2009 |publisher=Channelnewsasia.com |date= |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412205058/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/332003/1/.html |archivedate=12 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slovakia===

Smoking is prohibited in most indoor places. Since 2004, employers have been obliged to provide separate smoking rooms or a designated outdoor smoking place if smoking is allowed at work. Smoking is also prohibited in the majority of indoor public places. The regulations currently exempt bars that do not serve food. Restaurants are also excepted from indoor smoking restrictions. Since 2010 there has been no requirement for restaurants to have separate smoking and non-smoking areas. Smoking is also prohibited in shopping centres but a loop-hole in the law allows smoking on the balconies of cafeterias in shopping centres. Enforcement of this law is the responsibility of the Slovak Business Inspection (SOI) service.

There is also a partial restriction upon outdoor smoking, especially around railways stations and bus termini, and close to the entrances of government buildings. Local police forces are responsible for enforcing these laws, although this has on occasion been lax, reportedly due to a mix of corruption and insufficiently clear legislative requirements.

===Slovenia===
On 22 June 2007, the Slovenian National Assembly approved a law prohibiting smoking in all indoor public and work places, effective 5 August 2007. Exempted from the ban are "open public areas, special smoking hotel rooms, special smoking areas in [[elderly care]] centres and jails, and special smoking chambers in bars and other work places.
The smoking chambers, which will have to meet strict technical standards, will however not be allowed to occupy more than 20% of an establishment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukom.gov.si/eng/slovenia/publications/slovenia-news/4994/5005/ Slovenia Gets Tough Anti-Smoking Legislation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121084844/http://www.ukom.gov.si/eng/slovenia/publications/slovenia-news/4994/5005/ |date=21 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The law also raised the minimum age to purchase tobacco products from 15 to 18 and mandated that tobacco labels carry the telephone number of a quit-smoking hotline.

===South Africa===
[[File:Rook Verbode Sign.JPG|thumb|Bilingual "No Smoking" sign in English and [[Afrikaans]] at a state-owned facility.]]
The [[South Africa]]n government passed the first [[Tobacco Products Control Act]] in 1993 and started implementing the act in 1995. The act regulated smoking in public areas and prohibited tobacco sales to people under the age of 18. Some aspects of tobacco advertising were also regulated for example labelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acts.co.za/tobacco/index.htm|title=Tobacco Products Control Act 1993&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=10 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411010737/http://www.acts.co.za/tobacco/Index.htm|archivedate=11 April 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1993 act was not considered to be comprehensive enough and the Tobacco Products Control Amendment Act was passed in 1999. This act prohibits all advertising and promotion of tobacco products, including sponsorship and free distribution of tobacco products. The act also restricts smoking in public places, which includes workplaces, restaurants, bars, and public transport. The act does allow for designated smoking areas (no more than 25% of the total floor area). The act also stipulates penalties for transgressors of the law, and specifies the maximum permissible levels of [[tar]] and [[nicotine]]. The regulations were implemented in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.multinationalmonitor.org/mm2001/01jan-feb/corp8.html |title=The Great South African Smokeout: Anna White, 2001 |publisher=Multinationalmonitor.org |date=1 October 2000 |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614173057/http://www.multinationalmonitor.org/mm2001/01jan-feb/corp8.html |archivedate=14 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government proposed further amendments to the bill in 2007 that sought to deal with new practices designed to circumvent the Act. These amendments also aim to bring the current law into [[compliance (regulation)|compliance]] with the [[World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] (FCTC). This framework has been [[ratified]] by the [[South African government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polity.org.za/article.php?a_id=106646 |title=Madlala-Routledge: Tobacco Products Control Amendment Bill (29/03/2007) |publisher=Polity.org.za |date= |accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Korea enforced strict smoking bans in public places since July 2013, with fines of ₩100,000 [[South Korean won|won]] on any spotted smoker and up to ₩5 million won on shop owners not following the law. It is illegal and strictly prohibited to smoke in all bars and restaurants, cafes, internet cafes, government buildings, kindergartens, schools, universities, hospitals, youth facilities, libraries, children's playgrounds, private academies, subway or train stations and their platforms and underground pathways, large buildings, theaters, department stores or shopping malls, large hotels and highway rest areas.

The strict bans came into force gradually beginning with a ban on places larger than 150 square meters in 2012, extended to 100 square meters in 2014, with a full-fledged complete nationwide ban on 1 January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2999132|title=New Year brings in smoking ban|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803223148/http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2999132|archivedate=3 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
Since 1 January 2006 Spain had a partial restriction upon smoking in most public places. Offices, schools, hospitals and public transportation were smoke-free, but restaurants and bars could create a "smokers' section" or allow smoking if they were small (under 100m²).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4574734.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Spain sees smoking ban take hold | date=2 January 2006 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070121122934/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4574734.stm | archivedate=21 January 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2 January 2011 smoking has been restricted in every indoor public place, including restaurants, bars and cafes.

====Northern Ireland====
''Main article: [[Smoking in Ireland]]''

In [[Northern Ireland]], a smoke-free law has been in effect since 30 April 2007. It is illegal to smoke in all enclosed workplaces. This includes bars, restaurants, offices (even if the smoker is the only person in the office) and public buildings.
Like Scotland, the smoke-free law is comprehensive in that places such as telephone boxes and enclosed bus/train shelters are included. The on-the-spot fine for smoking in a workplace is £50 (~€70/~$100), while a business that allows smoking can be fined £2,500 (~€3,700/~$5,000).

A £200 fine may be levied by local councils if businesses fail to display no-smoking signs.
An opinion poll showed that 91% of people supported the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=30 April 2007 – 07:15:42 |url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/?jp=308472&amp;rss=rss2 |title=Northern Irish Smoking Ban |publisher=Breakingnews.ie |date=30 April 2007 |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614043017/http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/?jp=308472&amp;rss=rss2 |archivedate=14 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spacetobreathe.org.uk/ |title=Smoking ban information website |publisher=spacetobreathe.org.uk |date= |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012191557/http://www.spacetobreathe.org.uk/ |archivedate=12 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
{{Main|Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Act 2005}}
On 26 March 2006, Scotland prohibited smoking in enclosed (more than 50% covered) public places, which includes public buildings, workplaces, sports stadiums, bars and restaurants. Exemptions are in place to allow hotel guests to smoke in their own rooms, as long as the hotel has designated them as smoking rooms. The law restricts smoking in bus shelters, phone boxes or other shelters that are more than 50% enclosed. It also prohibits smoking in trucks and vans owned by a company, whether or not the driver is the only person inside (though smoking while driving was already legally questionable as it could be presented as "[[driving without due care and attention]]"). Nevertheless, the ban on smoking in work vehicles is commonly flouted, especially by tradesmen, and compliance with outdoor bans is minimal. There are no restrictions on smoking in railway stations as the railway bylaw applies only to England, and smoking remains common in outdoor areas of railway stations. Compliance with the indoor ban in pubs, restaurants and other workplaces is almost universal. Businesses covered by the smoking ban must display a statutory smoking sign at the entrance to, and around the building&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clearingtheairscotland.com/faqs/pdf/A4Poster.pdf |title=Standard no smoking sign in Scotland |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708163736/http://www.clearingtheairscotland.com/faqs/pdf/A4Poster.pdf |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a smoke-free policy. Opinion polls at its introduction showed a clear majority of the Scottish public were in favour of the ban&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketresearchworld.net/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=629&amp;Itemid= |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805010531/http://www.marketresearchworld.net/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=629&amp;Itemid= |archivedate=5 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }} 'Widespread support for smoking ban in Scotland'&lt;/ref&gt;

As in New Zealand, the smoke-free law was initially criticised by certain interested groups (e.g., publicans, cafe and [[Bingo (UK)|bingo]] hall owners, etc.) who feared that it would adversely impact their businesses. A survey published by the Scottish Beer &amp; Pubs Association one year on from implementation concluded that "the number of pub licensed premises in Scotland has remained more or less constant over the last year"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishpubs.co.uk/Aboutus/News/PR%202006%20Licensing%20Statistics.pdf |title='Research on liquor licenses for Scotland, March 2007, SBPA' |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205124507/http://www.scottishpubs.co.uk/Aboutus/News/PR%202006%20Licensing%20Statistics.pdf |archivedate=5 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating fears of an adverse impact of the ban on the hospitality industry were unfounded.

However, no statistical analysis has been conducted and speculation within the betting and gaming industry is that a decline could also be the result of demographic changes and increases in online gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bingo-uk.co.uk/smoking-bingo-players.htm |title='Smoking Ban, bingo.co.uk' |publisher=Bingo-uk.co.uk |date= |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809054437/http://www.bingo-uk.co.uk/smoking-bingo-players.htm |archivedate=9 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[NHS Scotland]] Quit Smoking Line reported it received an additional 50,000 calls from people wishing to give up in the six months after the smoke-free law was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clearingtheairscotland.com/ |title=Smoking ban information website |publisher=clearingtheairscotland.com |date= |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207180325/http://clearingtheairscotland.com/ |archivedate=7 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007 a study of nine Scottish hospitals over the twelve months following implementation reported positively on its impact on the country's health, including a 17% drop in admissions for heart attacks, compared with average reductions of 3% per year for the previous decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.gov.scot/News/Releases/2007/09/10081400 |title=Smoking ban brings positive results |publisher=[[Scottish Government]] |date=10 September 2007 |accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wales====
{{Main|Health Act 2006}}
Smoking was restricted across all enclosed public premises and work premises in Wales on 2 April 2007. Adherence is widespread and many public houses have closed since the law came into place.&lt;ref name="BBC2011"&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-13948624 "MPs campaign to relax smoking ban in pubs"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528042503/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-13948624 |date=28 May 2014 }}, BBC, 29 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Public places must display a special bilingual no smoking sign:
* "Mae ysmygu yn y fangre hon yn erbyn y gyfraith" (Welsh)
* "It is against the law to smoke in these premises" (English)

In addition, Wales is due to introduce a smoking ban outside schools and hospitals from Summer 2019.&lt;ref name=wales2019&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/25/wales-to-ban-smoking-outside-hospitals-and-schools-in-uk-first |title=Wales to ban smoking outside hospitals and schools in UK first |accessdate=29 May 2018 |first=Steven |last=Morris |date=25 May 2018 |publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations===
As United Nations buildings are not the subject of any national jurisdiction, the United Nations has its own smoking and non-smoking policies. Following the gradual introduction of partial smoking restrictions between 1985 and 2003, Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] introduced in 2003 a total prohibition upon smoking at [[United Nations Headquarters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N03/468/96/doc/N0346896.DOC?OpenElement|title=Smoking ban at United Nations Headquarters|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718234131/http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N03/468/96/doc/N0346896.DOC?OpenElement|archivedate=18 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar restrictions have not been introduced in field offices of the United Nations worldwide.  Some specialised agencies of the United Nations, such as the [[UNICEF|United Nations Children's Fund]] and the [[WHO|World Health Organization]] have their own strict smoke-free regulations that apply to their offices worldwide, but the same is not necessarily true for entities of the Secretariat, such as the [[Department of Peacekeeping Operations]] and the [[OCHA|Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)]]. Only on 13 December 2007, OCHA introduced a smoke-free regulation applicable to all its field offices.

===United States===
{{double image|right|US states smoking bans.svg|325|Smoking ban key.svg|250|Map of current and scheduled future statewide smoking bans as of 6 November 2012.}}
{{Main|List of smoking bans in the United States}}
In the United States, [[United States Congress|Congress]] has not attempted to enact any nationwide [[law of the United States|federal]] smoking ban. Therefore, smoking bans in the United States are entirely a product of state and [[local government in the United States|local]] [[criminal law|criminal]] and [[occupational safety and health]] laws. As a result, the existence and aggressiveness of smoking bans varies widely throughout the United States, ranging from total bans (even outdoors), to no regulation of smoking at all. Jurisdictions in the greater [[Southern United States|South]] tend to have the least restrictive smoking bans or no statewide bans at all. Of the 60 [[List of United States cities by population|most populated cities in the United States]], all but 17 ban smoking in all bars and restaurants.

According to Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, as of October 2012, 81.3% of the U.S. population is covered by bans on smoking in "workplaces, and/or restaurants, and/or bars, by either a state, commonwealth, or local law,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.no-smoke.org/pdf/mediaordlist.pdf |title=Overview List – How many Smokefree Laws? |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=5 October 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101121233/http://www.no-smoke.org/pdf/mediaordlist.pdf |archivedate=1 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; although only 48.7% are covered by bans in all workplaces ''and'' restaurants ''and'' bars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.no-smoke.org/pdf/SummaryUSPopList.pdf |title="Summary of 100% Smokefree State Laws and Population Protected by 100% U.S. Smokefree Laws", Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, 2&amp;nbsp;October 2012 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=5 October 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029060223/http://no-smoke.org/pdf/SummaryUSPopList.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2012, 28 states have banned smoking in all general workplaces and public places, including bars and restaurants (though many of these exempt tobacconists, cigar bars, casinos, private clubs, and/or small workplaces). Six have enacted smoking bans exempting all adult venues including bars, and in some cases casinos and restaurants (Tennessee exempts any place not admitting patrons under 21). [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Idaho]], [[Nevada]], [[New Hampshire]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Virginia]] have particularised state laws banning smoking in specific places but leaving out all others. The remaining 10 states have no statewide smoking bans at all, though many cities and/or counties in those states have enacted local smoking bans to varying degrees (except [[Oklahoma]], which prohibits local governments from regulating smoking at all).

As for U.S. jurisdictions that are not states, as of November 2012 smoking is banned in all public places (including bars and restaurants) in [[American Samoa]], the [[District of Columbia]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[United States Virgin Islands]]. [[Guam]] prohibits smoking in restaurants, but not in any other workplaces. The [[Northern Mariana Islands]] prohibits smoking in most workplaces and in restaurants but not in bars.

In [[Indianapolis]], [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] announced that it will ban smoking in its grandstands starting fall 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Press|first1=Associated|title=Indianapolis Motor Speedway to ban smoking in grandstands|url=http://www.kokomotribune.com/news/state_news/indianapolis-motor-speedway-to-ban-smoking-in-grandstands/article_e3aece3e-2b42-11e7-be0a-53b8d69864cc.html|website=Kokomo Tribune|publisher=Michael Conroy|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427185726/http://www.kokomotribune.com/news/state_news/indianapolis-motor-speedway-to-ban-smoking-in-grandstands/article_e3aece3e-2b42-11e7-be0a-53b8d69864cc.html|archivedate=27 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uruguay===
{{Main|Smoking in Uruguay}}
In March 2006, it became illegal in Uruguay to smoke in enclosed public spaces. Now bars, restaurants or offices where people are caught smoking face fines of more than $1,100 or a three-day closure. This makes Uruguay the first country in South America to ban smoking in enclosed public spaces.&lt;ref name=bbcuruguay&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4761624.stm |title=Uruguay curbs smoking in public |publisher=BBC News |date=1 March 2006 |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125195733/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4761624.stm |archivedate=25 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-smoking groups estimate that as many as a third of Uruguay's 3.4&amp;nbsp;million people smoke. [[President of Uruguay|President]] [[Tabaré Vázquez]], a practicing [[oncologist]], has cited reports suggesting about seven people die each day in Uruguay (an estimated 5,000 people a year) from smoking-related causes including lung cancer, emphysema and other illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tobaccofree.org/news%20articles/2006-03-02-Associated-Press/2006-03-02-Associated-Press-Uruguay.htm?SITE=VACUL&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT Public smoking ban takes effect in Uruguay] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614100802/http://www.tobaccofree.org/news%20articles/2006-03-02-Associated-Press/2006-03-02-Associated-Press-Uruguay.htm?SITE=VACUL&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |date=14 June 2007 }} – TobacoFree.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vatican City===
A July 2002 law signed by [[Pope John Paul II]] banned smoking on all places accessible to the public, and in all closed places of work within the [[Vatican City]], and within all extraterritorial [[properties of the Holy See]].

Owners or managers that do not post the notice or do not ensure compliance with the rule may be penalized with the closure of the establishment and / or a fine that can be up to 190,000 VEF (1.9 USD), however, regulation does not provide sanctions for smokers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Venezuelanalysis.com]], 30 May 2011, [http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/6226 Smoking Banned in Public and Commercial Closed Spaces in Venezuela] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603122413/http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/6226 |date=3 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Main article: [[Smoking in Vietnam]]'' 

The Vietnamese government has banned smoking and cigarette sales in offices, production facilities, schools, hospitals, and on public transport. However, bus drivers, especially in north Vietnam, occasionally smoke.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-05/17/content_6112701.htm |title=Xinhua – English |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=17 May 2007 |accessdate=15 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020140525/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-05/17/content_6112701.htm |archivedate=20 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smoking was banned in enclosed indoor spaces and public facilities in [[Ho Chi Minh City]] in 2005 with the exception of entertainment areas.

This is a '''list of terrestrial [[ecoregions]]''' as compiled by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF). The WWF identifies [[terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]], [[freshwater ecoregion|freshwater]], and [[marine ecoregion]]s.

The terrestrial scheme divides the Earth's land surface into 8 [[ecozone|terrestrial ecozones]], containing 867 smaller ecoregions. Each ecoregion is classified into one of 14 '''major habitat types''', or [[biome]]s.

[[File:Denali Mt McKinley.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Elevation|highest]] [[Summit|mountain peak]] of [[North America]].  Denali is the third most [[Topographic prominence|topographically prominent]] and third most [[Topographic isolation|topographically isolated]] [[summit]] on Earth after [[Mount Everest]] and [[Aconcagua]].]]

The following sortable table comprises the '''200 [[topographic isolation|most topographically isolated]] [[Summit|mountain peaks]] of [[North America|greater North America]]&lt;ref name=NA&gt;This article defines [[North America|greater North America]] as the portion of the [[Continent|continental landmass]] of the [[Americas]] extending westward and northward from the [[Isthmus of Panama]] plus the [[Island|ocean islands]] surrounding that landmass.  This article defines the ocean islands of greater North America to include the [[Island#Continental islands|coastal islands]] of [[Geography of North America|North America]], the [[Caribbean|islands of the Caribbean Sea]], the [[Lucayan Archipelago]], the [[List of islands of Greenland|islands of Greenland]] ([[Greenland|Kalaallit Nunaat]]), the [[List of islands of Canada|islands of Canada]], and the [[List of islands of Alaska|islands of Alaska]].  The [[Hawaiian Islands]] are not included because they are considered part of [[Oceania]].&lt;/ref&gt; with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]]'''.&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=NAVD_88&gt;All elevations in the 48 [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[contiguous United States]] include an elevation adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denali]] is one of only three summits on Earth with more than {{convert|6000|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic isolation.  Four major summits of greater North America exceed {{convert|2000|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, eight exceed {{convert|1000|km|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, 35 exceed {{convert|500|km|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, 107 exceed {{convert|200|km|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, [[List of the major 100-kilometer summits of North America|230 exceed {{convert|100|km|2|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}]], and 413 exceed {{convert|50|km|2|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic isolation.

[[Niue]] is subdivided into 14 villages (that is, [[municipalities]]). Each village has a village council that elects its chairman. The villages are at the same time electoral districts. Each village sends an assemblyman to the [[Parliament of Niue]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paclii.org/nu/legis/num_act/nivco1967321/ Niue Village Councils Ordinance 1967]&lt;/ref&gt;

==List==
The table lists the villages with population and area. These are the administrative subdivisions of Niue. Some of them include smaller settlements and hamlets.

The villages Alofi North and Alofi South together serve as the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of Niue, [[Alofi]] (pop. 614). In the following table, the villages are listed in clockwise sequence.

''Mistra Rocks''' (literally meaning "mysterious place" or "hidden rocks") is a coastline stretching from [[San Blas Bay]] to [[Riħan Valley]] in [[Nadur]], [[Gozo]], [[Malta]]. It is a [[Natural environment|naturally occurring]] rubble rocky area at the site of the ta' [[Sopu Tower]]. It has an endangered ecosystem being the niche of a number of species, such as wild shrubs and small animals. The geographical area has a rough terrain, making it difficult to access other than on foot. Remains of Maltese rubble walls and water canals, built over a hundred years ago, are taken as primarily evidence that until recent human activity took place for agricultural purposes. Some stretches of land were used as a quarry, but other than that the area was not altered by man-made intervention. Huge rocks, some the size of small houses, pile over each other forming deep under ground 'caves'. The area is considered a walker's paradise for visitors, even if so safety precautions should be taken in consideration when visiting, preferably with the assistance of locals.

The Czech name {{lang|cs|'''Čechy'''}} is from the same root but means [[Bohemia]], the westernmost and largest historical region of the [[Czech lands]] and the modern Czech Republic. The name ''Bohemia'' is an [[exonym]] derived from the [[Boii]], a Celtic tribe inhabiting the area before the [[early Slavs]] arrived. The [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] (1348–1918) were part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; often called "the Czech lands", they sometimes extended further, to all of [[Silesia]], [[Lusatia]], and various smaller territories. The Czech adjective {{lang|cs|'''český'''}} means both "Czech" and "Bohemian".

The Czech Republic's official formal and short names in Czech were decided at its creation after the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]] in the so-called "Velvet Divorce" of 1993.&lt;ref name="zakonyprolidi.cz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1990-53|title=53/1990 Sb.

==Czech-language name==
The country is named after the Czechs ({{lang-cs|Čechové}}), a Slavic tribe residing in central [[Bohemia]] that subdued the surrounding tribes in the late 9th century and created the Czech/Bohemian state. The origin of the name of the tribe itself is unknown. According to legend, it comes from their leader [[Lech, Czech, and Rus|Čech]], who brought them to Bohemia. Research regards Čech as a derivative of the root ''čel-'' (member of the people, kinsman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://nase-rec.ujc.cas.cz/archiv.php?art=4320 | publisher=The Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic | title=Původ jména Čech | trans-title=Origin of the name ''Čech'' | first=Jaromír | last=Spal | journal=Naše řeč (Our Speech) | pages=263–267 | volume=36 | issue=9-10 | year=1953 | language=Czech | accessdate=2012-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several variants of the name have been used over the centuries, due to the evolution of the Czech language. The digraph "cž" was used from the time of the 16th-century ''[[Bible of Kralice]]'' until the [[Czech orthography#History|reform of 1842]], being eventually replaced by "č" (changing ''Cžechy'' to ''Čechy''). In the late 19th century the suffix for the names of countries changed from -y to -sko (e.g. ''Rakousy''-''Rakousko'' for Austria, ''Uhry''-''Uhersko'' for Hungary). While the notion of ''Česko'' appears for the first time in 1704, it only came into official use in 1918 as the first part of the name of the newly independent [[Czechoslovakia]] (''Česko-Slovensko'' or ''Československo'') . Within that state, the [[Czech Socialist Republic]] (''Česká socialistická republika'', ''ČSR'')&lt;ref name="nase-rec.ujc.cas.cz"/&gt; was created on 1 January 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psp.cz/docs/texts/constitution_1968.html|title=Ústava 1968|website=www.psp.cz|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 March 1990 the Czech Socialist Republic was renamed the [[Czech Republic]] (''Česká republika'', ''ČR'').&lt;ref name="zakonyprolidi.cz"/&gt; When Czechoslovakia broke up in 1993, the Czech part of the name was intended to serve as the name of the Czech state. The decision started a dispute as many perceived the "new" word ''Česko'', which before had been only rarely used alone, as harsh sounding or as a remnant of ''Československo''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio.cz/en/article/53850 Looking for a name – Radio Prague] Radio.cz (2011-01-21). Retrieved on 2011-01-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The older term ''Čechy'' was rejected by many because it was primarily associated with Bohemia proper and to use it for the whole country was seen as inappropriate. This feeling was especially prominent among the inhabitants of [[Moravia]].

The use of the word "Česko" within the country itself has increased in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;According to the official Czech list of country names (Jména států a jejich územních částí. Český úřad zeměměřický a katastralní, Praha 2009, {{ISBN|978-80-86918-57-0}}): ''Česko je kodifikovaný jednoslovný název státu, který se podle ústavy oficiálně nazývá Česká republika'' ("Česko is a standardized one-word name of the state, which is officially named Česká republika according to its constitution")&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s, "Česko" was rarely used and viewed as controversial: some Czech politicians and public figures (e.g. media magnate [[Vladimír Železný]]) expressed concern about the non-use of ''Česko'' and ''Czechia''; on the other side, individuals such as president [[Václav Havel]] and minister [[Alexandr Vondra]] have strongly opposed using these forms. In 1997, the Civic initiative Czechia was formed by linguists and geographers in [[Brno]] to promote the use of Czechia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.czechia-initiative.com/index.html|title=Official pages|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, a conference of professionals aimed at encouraging the use of the name was held at [[Charles University in Prague]]. The Czech [[Senate of the Parliament of the Czech Republic|Senate]] held a session on the issue in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.cz/xqw/xervlet/pssenat/htmlhled?action=doc&amp;value=26753|title=Senát PČR: Náhled dokumentu|website=www.senat.cz|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.cz/xqw/xervlet/pssenat/htmlhled?action=doc&amp;value=27462|title=Senát PČR: Náhled dokumentu|website=www.senat.cz|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== English-language name ==
The historical English name of the country is Bohemia. This name derives from the Celtic tribe of [[Boii]], who inhabited the area from the 4th century BC. ''Boiohaemum'', as it was originally known in Latin, comes from the Germanic "Boi-haima", meaning "home of the Boii". The name survived all the later migrations affecting the area, including the arrival of the [[Slavs]] and the creation of the Czech state. In the 9th century, the country became officially known as the Duchy of Bohemia, changing to the Kingdom of Bohemia in the 11th century, and the Crown of Bohemia in the 14th century. A number of other names for the country have been used, including Lands of the Bohemian Crown, Czech/Bohemian lands, Bohemian Crown, the lands of the Crown of Saint Wenceslas and others.&lt;ref name="Šitler 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see Moryson 1626; https://archive.org/stream/fynesmorysons04moryuoft/fynesmorysons04moryuoft_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt; The Bohemian state included the three historical lands: Bohemia (''Čechy'') in narrower meaning, [[Moravia]] (''Morava'') and [[Silesia]] (''Slezsko''). From the 14th century until 1635 it also included Upper and Lower [[Lusatia]]. The higher hierarchical status of the Bohemian region led to that name being used for the larger country, with the people and language of this country being commonly referred to as Bohemian.

The first known usage of the word Czechia in English comes from a book of 1841 by Henry and Thomas Rose ""A New General Biographical Dictionary Projected and Partly Arranged".&lt;ref name="Šitler 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.cz" /&gt;

Shortly before the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire, there were proposals to use the traditional name Bohemia for the newly-formed state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite_book |last=Beneš |first=Edvard |authorlink=Edvard Beneš |year=1917 |title=Bohemia's case for independence |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |location=London |isbn=0-405-02734-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, out of consideration for Slovak national aspirations, the name "Czecho-Slovakia" (later "Czechoslovakia") was adopted instead.

After the establishment of Czechoslovakia, the name ''Czechia'' appeared in English, alongside the official name, as a reference to all the Czech lands&lt;ref&gt;Munzar J., Drápela M.V.: Czechia = Bohemia + Moravia + Silesia (Moravian Geographical Report. Brno: Ústav Geoniky, 1999. s. 58-61. Moravian Geographical Report, sv. 7, č. 2.) [http://www.muni.cz/research/publications/353778/], 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and to differentiate between the Czech and [[Slovakia|Slovak]] parts of the state. It was used at least as early as 4 January 1925; appearing in the article "Literary History of the Czechs", published by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i1203.photobucket.com/albums/bb383/JanBlanicky/LiteraryhistoryoftheCzechs.jpg|title=New York Times: Literary history of Czechs (Jan.4, 1925)|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was used in the Anglophone press before the German occupation of the Czech lands in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1939/03/20/archives/soviet-note-to-germany.html|title=Soviet Note to Germany|date=20 March 1939|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpress.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI/SharedView.Article.aspx?parm=%2FwB8ANL%2BnPwlFbqqHZmiA2bODax0AAxGfBgq4FZFSaR94CtNu1UI%2FxFmhikXq9%2FgYw%3D%3D&amp;mode=image&amp;href=PLS%2f1939%2f12%2f28&amp;page=6|title=RUSSIA BETRAYED BY FROST|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48344226|title=Dr. Benes Broadcasts To His Countrymen - LONDON, March 15. - Barrier Miner (Broken Hill, NSW : 1888 - 1954) - 16 Mar 1940|website=Trove|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/pages/results/?state=&amp;date1=1789&amp;date2=1943&amp;proxtext=Czechia&amp;x=15&amp;y=10&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=basic|title=Search Results « Chronicling America « Library of Congress|website=chroniclingamerica.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption of ''Czechia''===
In accordance with Resolution No. 4 I. of the UN conference on the standardization of geographic names (Geneva 1967) and Resolution No. 2 III. of the UN conference on the standardization of geographic names (Athens 1977), the Terminological Committee of the Czech Office for Surveying, Mapping, and Cadaster in cooperation with the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs standardized ''Czechia'' as the English translation of ''Česko'' in early 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Names of States and their Territorial Parts, The Terminological Committee of the Czech Office for Surveying, Mapping and Cadaster, Prague 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other names suggested in the 1990s included ''Czechomoravia'' or ''Czechlands''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-05-10/news/9805100369_1_czech-republic-czechomoravia-moravia-and-silesia Rocks, David. 1998. After 5 Years, Czech Republic Still Searching for a Short Name. ''Chicago Tribune'' (May 10), p. 4.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2000 a short name had still not been fully adopted by the Czech authorities. At that time, the Second Secretary, Press and Politics at the British Embassy in Prague, Giles Portman, showed a willingness to accept the name ''Czechia''. Portman said in 2000, "Czechs still use the name ''Česká republika'' rather than ''Česko'', and the English equivalent, ''the Czech Republic'', rather than ''Czechia''. Were that pattern to change, we would have no problem at all with adapting accordingly. But we feel that the initiative for that change must come from the Czech side and not from us."&lt;ref&gt;Horová E.: Record of Proceedings of the 7th Public Hearing of the Senate, May 11, 2004 (Czech) recording Portman's letter from April 4, 2000 from the British embassy in Prague&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senat.cz/cinnost/slyseni_petice/stenozaznamy/|title=Senát Parlamentu České republiky|first=Kancelář Senátu Parlamentu České|last=republiky|date=1 January 2012|website=www.senat.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Czech president [[Miloš Zeman]] recommended the wider official use of ''Czechia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/whats-in-a-name-czech-republic-mulls-shock-rebranding-as-czechia-8874839.html|title=What's in a name?

==Other languages==
The equivalent of the Czech short form {{lang|cs|Česko}} is in routine use by most other languages. In a few cases (for example [[Polish language|Polish]] {{lang|pl|Czechy}}, [[Croatian language|Croatian]] {{lang|sh|Češka}} and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] {{lang|sh|Чешка/Češka}}) this form had historically been used for Bohemia. Other languages adopted new short forms such as {{lang|ar|تشيكيا}} ''Tshīkyā'' in [[Arabic]].&lt;!--Note that the example {{lang|zh|捷克}} (''Jiékè'' in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]) in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] does not make sense in this context because the exact same Chinese characters have been used to translate the Czech part of Czechoslovakia--&gt; In most cases, the new form has more or less completely replaced the formal name for most usages. However, usage in Spanish and French remains mixed, with the forms {{lang|es|Chequia}} and {{lang|fr|Tchéquie}} occasionally being used alongside the longer formal names {{lang|es|República Checa}} and {{lang|fr|République tchèque}}.

===German===
In German, the term applicable to the Czech part of Czechoslovakia used to be {{lang|de|Tschechei}}, comparable to {{lang|de|Slowakei}} for [[Slovakia]]. However, the usage of that term began to have negative connotations in connection with the [[Nazis]], who used the term {{lang|de|Rest-Tschechei}} "remaining Czechia" when [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|they annexed the western parts of Czechoslovakia in early 1939]]. Since the restoration of Czechoslovakia and after the Second World War, the term {{lang|de|Tschechien}} is in use instead, as suggested by the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well as German and Austrian linguists. {{lang|de|Tschechien}} is a term from the 19th century that was originally used for the Czech lands that were part of [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zum Begriff "Tschechei": Problematik und Sprachgebrauch|url=http://www.czech-tourist.de/tschechei.htm|website=Czech Tourist (Germany)|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Foreign Office]] uses Tschechien on its official list of countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Aussenpolitik/Laender/Laenderinfos/01-Nodes_Uebersichtsseiten/TschechischeRepublik_node.html%7D%7D|title=Tschechien|website=Auswärtiges Amt|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Republic of the Congo]]''' &amp;ndash; also known as  '''Congo-Brazzaville''' or the '''Congo''', is a [[List of sovereign states|sovereign country]] located in [[Central Africa]].&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{cite web|date=July 3, 2009|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cf.html|title=Republic of the Congo|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is bordered by [[Gabon]], [[Cameroon]], the [[Central African Republic]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the [[Angola]]n [[exclave]] province of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]], and the [[Gulf of Guinea]].

The [[republic]] is a former [[France|French]] [[colony]].  Upon independence in 1960, the former French region of Middle Congo became the Republic of the Congo. After a quarter century of [[Marxism]], Congo became a [[multi-party democracy]] in 1992. However, a brief civil war in 1997 ended in the restoration of former Marxist President [[Denis Sassou Nguesso]] to power.

'''Puntland''' ({{lang-so|Puntlaand}}, {{lang-ar|أرض البنط}}), officially the '''Puntland State of Somalia''' ({{lang-so|Dowladda Puntland ee Soomaaliya}}, {{lang-ar|بونتلاند دولة الصومال}}), is a region in northeastern [[Somalia]]. Centered on the town of [[Garoowe]] in the [[Nugal, Somalia|Nugal]] province, its leaders declared the territory an [[States and regions of Somalia|autonomous state]] in 1998 but is internationally recognized as an [[autonomous region]] of [[Somalia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puntlandgovt.com/puntland-state-of-somalia Puntland State of Somalia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Puntland is bordered by [[Somaliland]] to its west, the [[Gulf of Aden]] in the north, the [[Guardafui Channel]] in the east, the central [[Galmudug]] region in the south, and [[Ethiopia]] in the southwest. There are two major geographical apices in Puntland, namely the [[Cape Guardafui]] which forms the tip of the Horn of Africa, and [[Ras Hafun]], the easternmost place on the continent.

The name "Puntland" is derived from the [[Land of Punt]] mentioned in [[ancient Egypt]]ian sources, although the exact location of the fabled territory is still a mystery. Many studies suggest that the Land of Punt was located in present-day Somalia,&lt;ref&gt;Dan Richardson, ''Egypt'', (Rough Guides: 2003), p. 404 {{ISBN|1858281881}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian McMahan, ''Secrets of the Pharaohs'', (HarperCollins: 1998), p. 92 {{ISBN|0380797208}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others propose that it was situated elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;David B. O'Connor, Stephen Quirke, Quir O'Connor, ''Mysterious lands'', (UCL Press: 2003), p. 64 {{ISBN|1598742078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Northern Sultanates===
{{main article|Somali aristocratic and court titles}}
[[File:Sultan Mohamoud Ali Shire 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mohamoud Ali Shire]], [[Sultan]] of the [[Warsangali Sultanate]]]]
The [[Warsangali Sultanate]] was an imperial ruling house centred in northeastern and in some parts of southeastern Somalia. It was one of the largest sultanates ever established in the territory, and, at the height of its power, included the [[Sanaag]] region and parts of the northeastern [[Bari, Somalia|Bari]] region of the country, an area historically known as [[Maakhir]] or the ''Maakhir Coast''. The Sultanate was founded in the 13th century in northern Somalia by a group of Somalis from the [[Warsangali]] branch of the [[Darod]] clan, and was ruled by the descendants of the [[Gerad Dhidhin]]. In the late 19th century, the influential [[Sultan]] [[Mohamoud Ali Shire]] governed the Sultanate, assuming control during some of its most turbulent years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warsangeli.org Warsangeli Sultanate]. Warsangeli.org. Retrieved on 20 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Garesadihafun.jpg|thumb|left|One of the forts of the [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] (Migiurtinia) in [[Hafun]]]]

The [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] (Migiurtinia) was founded in the mid-18th century. It rose to prominence the following century, under the reign of the resourceful Boqor (King) [[Osman Mahamuud]].&lt;ref name="Metz"&gt;Helen Chapin Metz, ''Somalia: a country study'', (The Division: 1993), p. 10 {{ISBN|0844407755}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Centred in [[Aluula]], it controlled much of northern and central Somalia in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The polity maintained a robust trading network, entered into treaties with foreign powers, and exerted strong centralized authority on the domestic front.&lt;ref&gt;''Horn of Africa'', Volume 15, Issues 1–4, (Horn of Africa Journal: 1997), p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Transformation towards a regulated economy'', (WSP Transition Programme, Somali Programme: 2000) p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Haji Bashir Ismail Yusuf2.jpg|thumb|upright|MP [[Haji Bashir Ismail Yusuf]], first legislator for [[Bosaso]] and first president of Somali parliament]]

The Majeerteen Sultanate was nearly destroyed in the mid-1800s by a power struggle between Boqor Osman and his ambitious cousin, [[Yusuf Ali Kenadid]]. After almost five years of battle, the young upstart was finally forced into exile in [[Yemen]]. A decade later, in the 1870s, Kenadid returned from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] with a band of [[Hadhramaut|Hadhrami]] [[musketeer]]s and a group of devoted lieutenants. With their assistance, he managed to overpower the local clans and establish the [[Sultanate of Hobyo]] in 1878.&lt;ref name="Metz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee V. Cassanelli, ''The shaping of Somali society: reconstructing the history of a pastoral people, 1600–1900'', (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1982), p. 75 {{ISBN|0812278321}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1889, Boqor Osman entered into a treaty with [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], making his realm an Italian [[protectorate]]. His rival Sultan Kenadid had signed a similar agreement vis-a-vis his own Sultanate the year before. Both rulers had signed the protectorate treaties to advance their own expansionist objectives, with Boqor Osman looking to use Italy's support in his ongoing power struggle with Kenadid over the Majeerteen Sultanate. Boqor Osman and Sultan Kenadid also hoped to exploit the conflicting interests among the European imperial powers that were then looking to control the Somali peninsula, so as to avoid direct occupation of their territories by force.&lt;ref name="Majsult"&gt;The Majeerteen Sultanates&lt;/ref&gt;

With the gradual extension into northern Somalia of European colonial rule, all three sultanates were annexed to [[Italian Somaliland]] and [[British Somaliland]] in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Majsult"/&gt; The local commercial hub of [[Bosaso]] was represented in the [[Parliament of Somalia|parliament]] of the succeeding [[Trust Territory of Somaliland]] by the MPs [[Haji Bashir Ismail Yusuf]] and Ugaas Yassin Ugaas Abdirahman.&lt;ref&gt;International Labour Office &amp; League of Nations, ''Record of proceedings'', (International Labour Office: 1956), p.249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hehbiy"&gt;[http://puntlandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ismail.pdf H. E. Hagi Bashir Ismail Yousuf] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AdpucTkQ?url=http://puntlandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ismail.pdf |date=13 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the northern sultanates' former domain is today coextensive with the autonomous Puntland region in northeastern Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;Istituto italo-africano, ''Africa: rivista trimestrale di studi e documentazione'', Volume 56, (Edizioni africane: 2001), p. 591.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment===
[[File:Somalian10ef5-1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed]], one of the founders of Puntland]]
Following the outbreak of the [[Somali Civil War]] in 1991, a homegrown constitutional conference was held in Garoowe in 1998 over a period of three months. Attended by the area's political elite, traditional elders (''Issims''), members of the business community, intellectuals and other civil society representatives, the autonomous Puntland State of Somalia was established to deliver services to the population, offer security, facilitate trade, and interact with domestic and international partners.&lt;ref&gt;His Excellency Abdirahman Mohamed Mohamud (Farole). President of Puntland State of Somalia [http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Puntland_s_Experience_in_Peace-building_and_State-building.shtml Somalia: Puntland's Experience in Peace-building and State-building] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017121333/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Puntland_s_Experience_in_Peace-building_and_State-building.shtml |date=17 October 2013 }}. garoweonline.com (3 April 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed]] served as the fledgling state's founding president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Somalia Business Law Handbook: Strategic Information and Laws|date=2013|publisher=International Business Publications|isbn=1438771045|page=102|url=http://www.google.com/books?id=mUIdWpwofCcC&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As stipulated in Article 1 of the [[Transitional Federal Charter of the Somali Republic]], Puntland is a part of the Federal State of Somalia. As such, the region seeks the unity of the [[Somalis]] and adheres to a federal system of government.&lt;ref name="MOPIC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mopicpl.com/Application/Puntland.pdf|title=Ministry of Planning and International Corporation|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the secessionist region of Somaliland to its west, Puntland is not trying to obtain international recognition as a separate nation.&lt;ref name="RRPuntland"&gt;{{cite web|title=Range Resources: Speculative Buy at 25.5p - Target price 56p |url=http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/research_Reports/gecr_29Nov07_RangeResources_mainnote.pdf |publisher=Range Resources |accessdate=21 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120100415/http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/research_Reports/gecr_29Nov07_RangeResources_mainnote.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-20 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both regions have one thing in common: they base their support upon clan elders and their organizational structure along lines based on clan relationships and [[kinship]].&lt;ref name="RRPuntland"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wardheernews.com/Articles_09/March/18_somaliland_faisal.pdf Local and Global Norms: Challenges to "Somaliland's" Unilateral Secession] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606161640/http://wardheernews.com/Articles_09/March/18_somaliland_faisal.pdf |date=6 June 2013 }}. (PDF) . Retrieved on 20 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1998, Puntland has also been in territorial disputes with Somaliland over the [[Sool, Somalia|Sool]] and [[Sanaag]] regions.

The legal structure of Puntland consists of the judiciary, legislative (House of Representatives) and the executive (the President and his nominated Council of Ministries) branches of government.&lt;ref name="MOPIC"/&gt; Though relatively peaceful, the region briefly experienced political unrest in 2001 when then President of Puntland, Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, one of the founding fathers of the Puntland State and its first president, wanted his term extended. Ahmed and [[Jama Ali Jama]] fought for control of the region, with Ahmed emerging victorious the following year. Ahmed served his second term as president until October 2004, when he was elected [[List of Presidents of Somalia|President of Somalia]]. He was succeeded in office by [[Mohamed Hashi]], who served until January 2005 when he lost a re-election bid in parliament to General [[Mohamud Muse Hersi]] "Adde".

==Politics==
{{main article|Government of Puntland}}

===Muse administration===
[[File:Cadde1.jpg|thumb|[[Mohamud Muse Hersi]]]]
In March 2005, then President Muse began an ambitious plan to build an airport in Puntland's commercial capital of [[Bosaso]], a project which is now complete and referred to as [[Bender Qassim International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.puntlandgovt.com/en/currentissues/information/further_information_add.php?id=27 |title=Puntland State Of Somalia |publisher=Puntlandgovt.com |date=18 March 2005 |accessdate=29 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420151618/http://www.puntlandgovt.com/en/currentissues/information/further_information_add.php?id=27 |archivedate=20 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puntlandgovt.com/en/currentissues/information/current_issues_more.php?id=412 |title=The President Tours the Bossaso Airport Construction Site |publisher=Puntlandgovt.com |date=31 August 2007 |accessdate=29 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107090353/http://www.puntlandgovt.com/en/currentissues/information/current_issues_more.php?id=412 |archivedate=7 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, Muse held meetings with Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi, the Crown Prince and Deputy Ruler of [[Ras al-Khaimah]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE), where the two leaders signed an agreement on a deal for setting up of a dedicated livestock quarantine facility to facilitate the import of [[livestock]] from Somalia to the UAE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ameinfo.com/116856.html |title=RAK and Puntland State of Somalia sign agreements to boost bilateral cooperation &amp;#124; Government of Ras Al Khaimah |publisher=AMEinfo.com |date= |accessdate=29 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728101945/http://www.ameinfo.com/116856.html |archive-date=28 July 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, Muse also signed a [[United Arab Emirates dirham|Dh]]170 million agreement with [[Dubai]]'s [[Lootah Group]] to support the construction of an airport, seaport and free zone in the coastal city of Bosaso. Muse indicated that "I believe that when we finish all these projects our people will benefit by getting good health services, education and overall prosperity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hiiraan.com/news2/2008/Nov/puntland_the_land_of_opportunity.aspx |title=Puntland: The land of opportunity |publisher=Hiiraan.com |date=November 2008 |accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Farole administration===
[[File:Abdirahman Farole.jpg|thumb|left|[[Abdirahman Farole]]]]
In January 2009, [[Abdirahman Farole]] was elected the new President of Puntland. Upon assuming office, the Farole administration implemented a number of reforms, particularly in the security and judicial sectors. To bolster the region's justice system, numerous new prosecutors, judges and other court personnel as well as additional prison guards were hired and trained. In July 2010, the Puntland Council of Ministers unanimously approved a new anti-terrorism law to more efficiently handle terror suspects and their accomplices; a special court is also expected to be established within the region's existing criminal courts system to facilitate the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Puntland_Cabinet_approves_counterterrorism_law.shtml |title=Somalia: Puntland Cabinet approves counterterrorism law |publisher=Garoweonline.com |date=2010-07-17 |accessdate=2010-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514132216/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Puntland_Cabinet_approves_counterterrorism_law.shtml |archivedate=14 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiscally, a transparent, [[Government budget|budget]]-based [[public finance]] system was established, which has reportedly helped increase public confidence in government. In addition, a new regional constitution was drafted and later passed on 15 June 2009, which is believed to represent a significant step toward the eventual introduction of a [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] political system to the region for the first time;&lt;ref name="GARW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Editorial_29/Somalia_President_Farole_the_Pride_of_Puntland_Editorial.shtml |title=President Farole – the Pride of Puntland |publisher=Garowe Online |date=2010-05-12 |accessdate=2010-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619122328/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Editorial_29/Somalia_President_Farole_the_Pride_of_Puntland_Editorial.shtml |archivedate=19 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such a system already exists in the adjacent Somaliland region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/14904 |title=Somaliland women prepare strategy for election |publisher=Afrol.com |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More modest reforms were also put into motion in the social sector, particularly in the education and healthcare fields. The regional government has hired more healthcare workers and teachers, with major plans under way for school and hospital renovations.&lt;ref name="GARW"/&gt; One of the most significant new reforms enacted by the incumbent Puntland administration is the launching in May 2009 of the [[Puntland Agency For Social Welfare]] (PASWE), the first organization of its kind in Somali history. The agency provides medical, educational and counselling support to vulnerable groups and individuals such as orphans, the disabled and the blind. PASWE is overseen by a Board of Directors, which consists of religious scholars (''[[Ulama|ulema]]''), business people, intellectuals and traditional elders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Puntland_leader_launches_welfare_agency_printer.shtml |title=Somalia: Puntland leader launches welfare agency |publisher=Garoweonline.com |accessdate=2010-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024151636/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Puntland_leader_launches_welfare_agency_printer.shtml |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratization process===
{{main article|Puntland presidential election, 2014}}
On 15 June 2009, the Puntland government passed a new regional draft constitution, representing a significant step toward the eventual introduction of a [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] political system to the region for the first time.&lt;ref name="GARW"/&gt;
[[File:Somdbihd6.png|thumb|right|Women at a political function during the Puntland democratisation process]]

On 15 April 2012, the Puntland government opened a four-day constitutional convention officially inaugurating the new [[constitution of Puntland]]. Overseen by the Puntland Electoral Commission (PEC), the constitution represented the final step in the extant regional democratization process and was scheduled to be followed by the formation of political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Somalia: Puntland constitutional convention opens in Garowe |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Puntland_constitutional_convention_opens_in_Garowe_printer.shtml |accessdate=19 April 2012 |newspaper=Garowe Online |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131203174745/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Puntland_constitutional_convention_opens_in_Garowe_printer.shtml |archive-date=3 December 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 September 2012, the [[Puntland Electoral Commission]] announced that the registration process for political parties in Puntland was now open. This came after the passing of the Political Association Law, the Referendum Act, the District Elections Law and the inauguration of the state constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Somalia: ‘Registration of political associations open’: Puntland Election Commission |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Registration_of_political_associations_open_Puntland_Election_Commission_printer.shtml |accessdate=18 September 2012 |newspaper=Garowe Online |date=12 September 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131203174815/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Registration_of_political_associations_open_Puntland_Election_Commission_printer.shtml |archive-date=3 December 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They will also be challengers in the next elections, scheduled for January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Somalia: Puntland MPs amend electoral law |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Puntland_MPs_amend_electoral_law_printer.shtml |accessdate=19 November 2012 |newspaper=Garowe Online |date=12 November 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131203174747/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Puntland_MPs_amend_electoral_law_printer.shtml |archive-date=3 December 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 November 2012, President Farole announced the launching of his new political party, [[Horseed (political party)|Horseed]]. The association counts over 200 members and represents the incumbent Puntland government, including Vice President [[Abdisamad Ali Shire]] and the state Ministers. It is the first prospective party to register for an application with the Transitional Puntland Electoral Commission (TPEC).

===State flag===
{{main article|Flag of Puntland}}
[[File:Flag of Puntland.svg|thumb|Puntland's [[Flag of Puntland|state flag]]]]
On 22 December 2009, Puntland MPs introduced a new [[Flag of Puntland|state flag]] at a parliamentary session in Garowe. With 38 of 41 legislators endorsing the motion, it also permitted the creation of a new state anthem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia: Puntland parliament endorse new flag|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Puntland_parliament_endorse_new_flag_printer.shtml|accessdate=17 July 2013|newspaper=Garowe Online|date=22 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017121253/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Puntland_parliament_endorse_new_flag_printer.shtml|archive-date=17 October 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puntland's new regional flag consists of three colours: white, blue and green.

*''Top'': the blue stripe with the white star in the centre symbolizes the [[flag of Somalia]]
*''Centre'': the white stripe in the centre represents peace and stability in the region
*''Bottom'': the green stripe symbolizes the natural wealth of the Puntland State of Somalia

==Administrative divisions==

As stipulated in Article 3 of the [[Transitional Federal Charter of the Somali Republic]], Puntland consists of the following regions:&lt;ref name="MOPIC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160105080132/http://taleex.net/english/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/MAP_PUNTLAND1.jpg Map of Puntland State of Somalia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Election and administrative structure|url=http://plstate.so/about/|website=plstate|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Redistricting and border disputes===
{{Main article|Puntland–Somaliland dispute}}
In January 2009, [[Maakhir]] was officially incorporated into Puntland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Somalia - Maakhir|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Somalia.html#Maakhir|publisher=Worldstatesmen|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Control of the western [[Sool, Somalia|Sool]], [[Sanaag]] and [[Ayn, Somalia|Cayn]] (SSC) provinces is disputed with the autonomous [[Khatumo State]] (formerly HBM-SSC or Hoggaanka Badbaadada iyo Mideynta SSC) and [[Somaliland]] regions of Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wardheernews.com/Articles_2010/June/Buh/29_Somaliland_recognition_&amp;_the_HBM-SSC_Factor.html|title=Somaliland痴 Quest for International Recognition and the HBM-SSC Factor|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528122058/http://wardheernews.com/Articles_2010/June/Buh/29_Somaliland_recognition_%26_the_HBM-SSC_Factor.html|archivedate=28 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 April 2013, the Puntland government announced the creation of a new region named [[Cape Guardafui|Gardafuul]]. Carved out of the Bari region, it consists of three districts and has its capital at [[Aluula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puntlandpost.com/garoowe-gobal-degmooyin-cusub-oo-maalmahan-si-rasmi-ah-ugu-soo-biiraaya-gobalada-degmooyinka-puntland/|title=Puntlandpost.com - All About Somalia and Puntland|work=Puntland Post|accessdate=1 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613145006/http://www.puntlandpost.com/garoowe-gobal-degmooyin-cusub-oo-maalmahan-si-rasmi-ah-ugu-soo-biiraaya-gobalada-degmooyinka-puntland/|archivedate=13 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to naming this new region, the previous government of Puntland created three regions, all carved out of the existing regions: [[Karkaar]] was carved out of [[Bari Region|Bari]], [[Haylaan]] out of [[Sanaag]], and Ayn out of [[Togdheer]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puntlandgovt.com/puntland-state-of-somalia/|title=Puntland State Of Somalia|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Sambalaxx.jpg|thumb|A [[camel]] peering over the leafier portions of Puntland's [[Cal Madow]] mountain range]]
Puntland is geographically situated in the northeastern portion of [[Somalia]]. It is bordered by [[Somaliland]] to its west, the [[Gulf of Aden]] in the north, the [[Indian Ocean]] in the southeast, the central [[Galmudug]] region of Somalia in the south, and [[Ethiopia]] in the southwest. Puntland occupies a total land area of 212,510 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="resources figures"&gt;http://siteresources.worldbank.org/SOMALIAEXTN/Resources/PuntlandFigures.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or roughly one-third of Somalia's geographical area.&lt;ref name="MOPIC"/&gt;

===Climate===
The region is [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]], with a warm climate and average daily temperatures ranging from {{convert|27|°C|°F|1}} to {{convert|37|°C|°F|1}}. These climatic conditions favor [[pastoralism]] as the most effective use of land in most parts of the region. The most valuable grazing land includes the [[Haud|Hawd]] region in the high plateau to the west of the [[Mudug]] and [[Sool, Somalia|Sool]] regions of Somalia, and into Ethiopia and the low [[Nugaal]] valley. Mild temperatures, by contrast, are experienced only along the high mountain ranges of [[Bari, Somalia|Bari]]. In all other areas, Puntland is generally characterized by tropical desert heat.&lt;ref name="MOPIC"/&gt;

Rainfall is sparse and variable, with no single area receiving more than {{convert|400|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of rain annually. Nomads primarily rely on [[Water well|wells]] as a source of water rather than [[surface water]]. There are four main seasons around which pastoral and agricultural life revolve, and these are dictated by shifts in the wind patterns. Puntland's seasons are:&lt;ref name="MOPIC"/&gt;

* ''Jilal'' – from January to March; the harshest dry season of the year
* ''Gu'' – from April to June; the main rainy season
* ''Xagaa'' – from July to September; the second dry season
* ''Deyr'' – from October to December; the shorter and less reliable rainy season&lt;!-- [[Template:Geographic location]] --&gt;

==Education==
{{main article|Education in Somalia}}
[[File:Punstacomlab2.jpg|thumb|A computer classroom in [[Puntland State University]]'s Garowe campus]]
Following the outbreak of the civil war in Somalia, numerous problems arose with regard to access to education in rural areas and along gender lines, quality of educational provisions, responsiveness of school curricula, educational standards and controls, management and planning capacity, and financing. To address these concerns, the Puntland government is in the process of developing an educational policy to guide the region's scholastic process as it embarks on the path of reconstruction and economic development. The latter includes a gender sensitive national education policy compliant with world standards, such as those outlined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.puntlandgovt.com/education.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929135728/http://education.puntlandgovt.com/education.php|title=Education|archivedate=29 September 2010|publisher=Ministry of Education - Puntland State of Somalia|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this and other educational measures at work are the government's enactment of legislation aimed at securing the educational interests of girls,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.puntlandgovt.com/girlseducation.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830060937/http://education.puntlandgovt.com/girlseducation.php|title=Girl's Education |archivedate=30 August 2010|publisher=Ministry of Education - Puntland State of Somalia|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; promoting the growth of an [[Early childhood education|Early Childhood Development]] (ECD) program designed to reach parents and care-givers in their homes as well as in the ECD centers for 0- to 5-year-old children,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.puntlandgovt.com/child.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830060916/http://education.puntlandgovt.com/child.php|title=Chlidren Education (''sic'') |archivedate=30 August 2010|publisher=Ministry of Education - Puntland State of Somalia|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and introducing incentive packages to encourage teachers to work in remote rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.puntlandgovt.com/nomads.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830060830/http://education.puntlandgovt.com/nomads.php|title=Education for Nomads |archivedate=30 August 2010|publisher=Ministry of Education - Puntland State of Somalia|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Puntland government, the Ministry of Education is responsible for developing and managing the region's educational needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.puntlandgovt.com/the_ministry.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929133003/http://education.puntlandgovt.com/the_ministry.php|title=The Ministry |archivedate=29 September 2010|publisher=Ministry of Education - Puntland State of Somalia|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is headed by the Minister Mohamud Bile Dubbe, under whom a Vice Minister and Director General help oversee a Post-Primary Education Division (PPED) and a Basic Education Directorate (BED), among other boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.puntlandgovt.com/minister.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929135750/http://education.puntlandgovt.com/minister.php|title=Hon.

The educational system of Puntland comprises two years of Early Childhood Development (ECD), eight years of [[primary education]] (four years of lower primary and four years of upper primary) and four years of [[secondary education]]. [[Tertiary education]] comprises an average of four years,&lt;ref name="Educsys"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.puntlandgovt.com/syseducation.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830144734/http://education.puntlandgovt.com/syseducation.php|title=Educational System |archivedate=30 August 2010|publisher=Ministry of Education - Puntland State of Somalia |accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the region currently counting seven major universities: [[Puntland State University]] in [[Garowe]], Puntland State University in [[Galkayo]], Bosaso College in [[Bosaso]], [[East Somalia University]] in [[Qardho]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastsomaliauniversity.com/ East Somalia University].

Puntland's Ministry of Education also recognizes [[Nonformal learning|non-formal education]] (NFE) and [[Vocational education|technical/vocational education and training]] (TVET) as integral parts of the region's educational system.&lt;ref name="Educsys"/&gt;

From 2005/2006 to 2006/2007, there was a significant increase in the number of schools in Puntland, up 137 institutions from just one year prior. During the same period, the number of classes in the region increased by 504, with 762 more teachers also offering their services. Total student enrollment increased by 27% over the previous year, with girls lagging only slightly behind boys in attendance in most regions. The highest class enrollment was observed in the northernmost [[Bari Region|Bari]] region, and the lowest was observed in the under-populated [[Ayn, Somalia|Ayn]] region. The distribution of classrooms was almost evenly split between urban and rural areas, with marginally more pupils attending and instructors teaching classes in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100910173552/http://education.puntlandgovt.com/BES_presentation2007.pdf Basic education survey].

==Demographics and religion==
[[File:Punmosq.jpg|thumb|upright|A mosque in [[Bosaso]]]]
{{main article|Islam in Puntland}}
As of 2015, the population of Puntland is estimated at 4.2 million residents, 65% of whom are [[nomad]]s.&lt;ref name="MOPIC"/&gt; The region is primarily inhabited by people from the [[Somali people|Somali]] ethnic group, with the [[Darod]] especially well-represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Africa Confidential, Volume 48|year=2007|publisher=Miramoor Publications Limited|page=131|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N74sAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a number of [[Meheri people|Mehri]] residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farah|first=Mohamed I.|title=Politics and Society in Somalia's North-Eastern Region|journal=Life &amp; Peace Review|date=April 1994|volume=8|issue=4|url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Newsletters/peace.html|accessdate=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puntland's population growth rate is quite high due in part to an influx of people from southern Somalia and from neighboring Northeast African countries. Currently, 30% of the region's residents live in the fast-growing towns of [[Bosaso]], [[Gardo]], [[Galdogob]], [[Garowe]] and [[Galkayo]]. Approximately 70% of the population is also below the age of 30.&lt;ref name="MOPIC"/&gt;

The [[population density]] in Puntland is estimated at about 18 persons per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="MOPIC"/&gt;

As with the rest of Somalia, [[Islam]] is the main religion of the Puntland region. 100% of all residents of Puntland are [[Muslim]]s.&lt;ref name="MOPIC"/&gt;

==Transportation==
In terms of public transportation, bus services operate in [[Bosaso]], [[Garowe]], [[Las Anod]], [[Galkayo]] and [[Qardho]]. Shuttle services between the region's major towns and adjacent hamlets are also available via different types of vehicles, such as 4 wheel drives and light goods vehicles (LGV). As of May 2015, over 70,000 vehicles are registered with the Puntland Ministry of Works and Transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Puntland sends caveat to drivers without legal driving license|url=http://goobjoog.com/english/?p=13752|accessdate=10 May 2015|agency=Goobjoog|date=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Garoweresid6.jpg|thumb|left|Roadside view of a neighborhood in Garowe]]

Puntland is traversed by a 750&amp;nbsp;km north–south highway. It connects major cities in the northern part of Somalia, such as Garowe, Bosaso and Galkayo, with towns in the south.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waayaha.net/view.php?articleid=7880 The First 100 Days in Office] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223041615/http://www.waayaha.net/view.php?articleid=7880 |date=23 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Puntland Highway Authority completed rehabilitation work on the central artery linking Garowe with Galkayo.&lt;ref name="sabahionline.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Puntland to rehabilitate Bosaso-Qardo road|url=http://sabahionline.com/en_GB/articles/hoa/articles/newsbriefs/2012/10/22/newsbrief-07|accessdate=6 November 2012|newspaper=Sabahi|date=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transportation body also started an upgrade and repair project in June 2012 on the large thoroughfare between the regional capital and Bosaso.&lt;ref name="Ptubgh"&gt;{{cite news|title=Puntland to upgrade Bosaso-Garowe highway|url=http://sabahionline.com/en_GB/articles/hoa/articles/newsbriefs/2012/06/28/newsbrief-07|accessdate=6 November 2012|newspaper=Sabahi|date=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, renovations began in October 2012 on the freeway linking Bosaso with Qardho.&lt;ref name="sabahionline.com"/&gt; Plans are also in the works to construct new roads connecting littoral towns in the region to the main highway.&lt;ref name="Ptubgh"/&gt;
[[File:Bosasairp.jpg|thumb|The [[Bender Qassim International Airport]] in Bosaso in 2016, prior to renovations]]

Bosaso has a major [[seaport]], which was constructed during the mid-1980s for annual livestock shipments to the [[Middle East]]. In January 2012, a renovation project was launched, with KMC contracted to upgrade the harbor.

For air transportation, local airlines offer flights to various domestic and international locations, such as [[Djibouti]], [[Addis Ababa]], [[Dubai]] and [[Jeddah]]; they also provide flights for the [[Hajj]] and [[Umrah]] pilgrimages. The most prominent airlines in Puntland are [[Jubba Airways]], Osob Air and [[Daallo Airlines]], which operate from [[Bender Qassim International Airport]] in Bosaso and [[Abdullahi Yusuf International Airport]] (formerly Galkayo Airport) in Galkayo, among other places. In late September 2013, a launching ceremony of tender process for the Bosaso airport's renovations was held at the facility. The renovations will include the extension of the airport's gravel runway from 1,800&amp;nbsp;m to 2,650&amp;nbsp;m. The runway's width will also be widened from 30&amp;nbsp;m to 45&amp;nbsp;m, and feature 7.5&amp;nbsp;m gravel shoulders on both sides. According to Puntland Deputy Minister of Civil Aviation Abdiqani Gelle, the Puntland government plans to carry out similar upgrades at the [[Garowe International Airport]] in Garowe, the Abdullahi Yusuf International Airport in Galkayo, and the [[Qardho Airport]] in Qardho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia: 20 companies compete for Bossaso Airport runway bid|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_20_companies_compete_for_Bossaso_Airport_runway_bid_printer.shtml|accessdate=2 October 2013|newspaper=Garowe Online|date=30 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215237/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_20_companies_compete_for_Bossaso_Airport_runway_bid_printer.shtml|archivedate=4 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puntland has the lowest rate of poverty in [[Somalia]], with 27%, compared to 50% in [[Somaliland]] and 57% in [[Mogadishu]]. Experts believe this is because of higher consumption and higher labour force participation. Households in Puntland consume a higher quantity per capita per item and more items per household. The lower rate of poverty does not appear to be driven by household size, as the average in Puntland is 5.2, compared to 5.7 in [[Somaliland]] and 4.5 in [[Mogadishu]]. Puntland is doing better in various important indicators of well-being. For instance, the literacy rate in Puntland is 64% compared to the national average of 55%. Additionally, households in Puntland also outperform the average in other educational outcomes such as enrolment and educational attainment. 70% of households in Puntland have access to improved water sources compared to the national average of 58%. Therefore, Puntland’s higher performance on non-monetary indicators of well-being are inline with its lower rate of poverty.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/325991506114032755/pdf/Output-P160456-v7.pdf|title=Somali Poverty Profile 2016|last=Pape|first=Utz|last2=di Filippo|first2=Mario|date=June 2017|website=The World Bank|publisher=The World Bank|page=91-102|type=PDF|format=PDF|access-date=|last3=Nunez|first3=Gonzalo|last4=Wollburg|first4=Philip}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, a new commercial market opened in Bosaso's northern Dayaha ("Star") neighborhood, near the seaport. Approximately half a kilometer in size, it was designed to ensure easy vehicle access. The market is the result of careful planning between Puntland government officials and civil society representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia: New market opens in Bossaso|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Wararka_19/Somalia_New_market_opens_in_Bossaso.shtml|accessdate=13 November 2012|newspaper=Garowe Online|date=14 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005001933/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Wararka_19/Somalia_New_market_opens_in_Bossaso.shtml|archivedate=5 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil exploration===
{{main article|Oil exploration in Puntland}}
[[File:Puntland oil.png|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Oil exploration in Puntland|Oil blocks]] in Puntland]]
In the 2000s, the Puntland government began official negotiations with foreign oil companies over exploration rights in the area. The provincial authorities in October 2005 granted [[Range Resources]] a majority stake in two sizable land-based mineral and hydrocarbon exploration licenses, in addition to offshore rights. The onshore [[Nugaal Valley|Nugaal]] and [[Dharoor Valley]] blocks in question span over 14,424 km2 and 24,908 km2, respectively. Two years later, Range Resources obtained a 100% interest in the two blocks and concurrently farmed out 80% of that share to Canmex Minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oil and Gas Exploration and Production - Playing a Better Hand|url=http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/research_Reports/lloydsEJ_feb12.pdf|publisher=Range Resources|accessdate=14 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017183314/http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/research_Reports/lloydsEJ_feb12.pdf|archivedate=17 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, the Puntland administration, which was then led by President Mohamud Muse Hersi, signed the Puntland Product Sharing Agreement (PSA) with Range Resources Limited and the Canmex Minerals subsidiary Canmex Holdings (Bermuda) II Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2007 Annual Report|url=http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Financial_Reports/RRS_Annual_Report_2007__PRINTERS_FINAL_.pdf|publisher=Range Resources|accessdate=14 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321194039/http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Financial_Reports/RRS_Annual_Report_2007__PRINTERS_FINAL_.pdf|archivedate=21 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a change in leadership in 2009, the Puntland government, now led by President Abdirahman Mohamud Farole, sought to renegotiate the profit sharing agreement with Range Resources to ensure more favorable terms for the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theage.com.au/business/youre-not-sacked-youve-been-realigned-20090203-7wud.html|title= You're not sacked, you've been realigned|author= Mark Hawthorne|date= 4 February 2009|work= |publisher= [[The Age]]|accessdate=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Puntland government gave the green light to the first official oil exploration project in Puntland and Somalia at large.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/25907/red-emperor-range-rally-on-puntland-drilling-update-25907.html Red Emperor, Range rally on Puntland drilling update] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613101117/http://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/25907/red-emperor-range-rally-on-puntland-drilling-update-25907.html |date=13 June 2015 }}.

'''Richard Coates''' (born 16 April 1949, in [[Grimsby]], Lincolnshire, and educated at [[Wintringham School]]) is an English linguist. He is professor of [[linguistics]] (alternatively professor of [[onomastics]]) at the [[University of the West of England]], Bristol. From 1977 to 2006 he taught at the [[University of Sussex]], where he served as professor of linguistics (1991–2006) and as Dean of the School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences (1998–2003). From 1980–9 he was assistant secretary and then secretary of the [[Linguistics Association of Great Britain]]. He has been honorary director of the [[Survey of English Place-Names]] since 2003, having previously (1997–2002) served as president of the [[English Place-Name Society]] which conducts the Survey. From 2002 to 2008, he was secretary of the [[International Council of Onomastic Sciences]], a body devoted to the promotion of the study of names, and elected as one of its two vice-presidents from 2011–14 and 2014-17. He was elected a fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] in 1992 and of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] in 2001.

His main academic interests are proper names (both from the historical and the theoretical perspective), [[historical linguistics]] in general, the [[philology]] of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Romance languages|Romance]] and [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] languages, regional variation in language, and [[local history]]. He is editor of the Survey of English Place-Names for [[Hampshire]] and principal investigator of the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council|AHRC]]-funded project Family Names of the United Kingdom (FaNUK), running from 2010–16, of which [[Patrick Hanks]] is lead researcher.

He has written books on the names of the [[Channel Islands]], the local place-names of [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]], Hampshire and [[Sussex]], the dialect of Sussex, and, with [[Andrew Breeze]], on Celtic place-names in England, as well as about 400 academic articles, notes, and collections on related topics. For example, in 1998, he introduced a new etymology of the name ''London'', deriving it from the pre-Celtic [[Old European hydronymy|Old European]] ''*(p)lowonidā'', meaning 'boat river' or 'swim river', i.e. 'river too wide or deep to ford', and suggested that this was a name given to the part of the [[River Thames]] which flows through London; from this, the settlement gained the Celtic form of its name, ''*Lowonidonjon'', by suffixation.&lt;ref name="coates1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coates|first=Richard|year=1998|title=A new explanation of the name of London|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|volume=96|issue=2|pages=203–229|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1467-968X.00027|doi=10.1111/1467-968X.00027}}&lt;/ref&gt; His main contribution to linguistic theory is The Pragmatic Theory of Properhood, set out in a number of articles since 2000.&lt;ref name="coates2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coates|first=Richard|year=2006|title=Properhood|journal=Language|volume=82|issue=2|pages=356–382|doi=10.1353/lan.2006.0084}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coates3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coates|first=Richard|year=2006|title=Some consequences and critiques of The Pragmatic Theory of Properhood|journal=Onoma|volume=41|pages=27–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coates4"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coates|first=Richard|year=2007|title=A strictly Millian approach to the definition of the proper name|journal=Mind and Language|volume=24|issue=4|pages=433–444|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0017.2009.01369.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coates5"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coates|first=Richard|year=2012|title=Eight issues in The Pragmatic Theory of Properhood|journal=Acta Linguistica Lithuanica/ Lietuvių kalbotyros klausimai|volume=66|pages=119–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also the author of ''Word Structure'', a students' introduction to [[morphology (linguistics)|linguistic morphology]] (Routledge), and of online resources on [[Shakespeare]]'s character-names and on the place-names of [[Hayling Island]].

[[Senegal]] is subdivided into four levels of [[administrative division]]s.  

== Regions ==
{{See|Regions of Senegal}}
{{stack|[[Image:Regions of Senegal.svg|right|450px|Regions of Senegal]]}}

At the top level are the [[Regions of Senegal]] and their elected administrative body. The 14 regions (''régions'', singular - ''région''), are administered by a ''Conseil Régionaux'', which is elected by population weight at the [[Arrondissements of Senegal|Arrondissement]] level.

== Departments ==
{{See|Departments of Senegal}}

Regions are subdivided into [[Departments of Senegal|Departments]], which are strictly administrative entities with no independent political power.  

== Arrondissements ==
{{See|Arrondissements of Senegal}}

Departments are made up of [[Arrondissements of Senegal|Arrondissements]]. These are also purely administrative structures, with prefects appointed by the central government.

== Communes ==
{{See|Communes of Senegal}}
City arrondissements (such as in Dakar and Pikine) are divided into [[Communes of Senegal|''Communes d'arrondissement'']]. In the [[Dakar Region]], since 1996, the four Arrondissements have been subdivided into such Communes d'arrondissement, with appointed Sub-Prefects, answerable to their Arrondissement Prefects. Outside the large cities, the  built up areas are titled ''communes de ville'' and the rural arrondissements divided into ''communautés rurales''  which maintain the same powers: city councils and mayors, directly elected. 

Senegal's subdivisions number 14 ''régions'', 45 ''départements'', 133 ''arrondissements'', 46 ''communes d'arrondissement'',  113 ''communes de ville'' and 370 ''communautés rurales''.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.uael.sn/article.php3?id_article=32 List of current local elected officials] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819053719/http://www.uael.sn/article.php3?id_article=32 |date=2007-08-19 }} from Union des ''Associations d’ Elus Locaux (UAEL) du Sénégal''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2367">'''Sum''', '''sumu''', '''sumon''', and '''somon''' (Plural: ''sumd'') are a type of administrative district used in [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Mongolia]], and [[Russia]].

==China==
In [[Inner Mongolia]], a '''sumu''' (Mongolian: {{MongolUnicode|ᠰᠤᠮᠤ}}, transliteration: ''sumu''; {{Zh|c=苏木}}, [[pinyin]]: ''sūmù'') is a [[Administrative divisions of China|township-level political/administrative division]]. The ''sumu'' division is equivalent to a [[Townships of the People's Republic of China|township]] but is unique to Inner Mongolia. It is therefore larger than a [[village of China|gaqa]] (Mongolian: {{Lang|mn|{{MongolUnicode|ᠭᠠᠴᠠᠭᠠ}} гацаа}}) and smaller than a [[Banners of Inner Mongolia|banner]] (the [[Inner Mongolia]] equivalent of the [[County (People's Republic of China)|county]]-level division).

''Sumu'' whose population is predominated by [[ethnic minorities of China|ethnic minorities]] are designated [[ethnic sumu]]&amp;nbsp;– parallel with the [[ethnic township]] in the rest of China.  {{Asof|2010}}, there is only one ethnic sumu in China, the [[Evenk Ethnic Sumu]].

==[[Mongolia]]==
{{Main|Sums of Mongolia}}

A sum ({{Lang-mn|сум}}) is the second level administrative subdivision below the [[Aimag]]s (provinces), roughly comparable to a [[County]] in the [[United States]]. There are 331 sums in Mongolia. Each sum is again subdivided into ''[[bag (country subdivision)|bags]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ole Bruun Precious Steppe: Mongolian Nomadic Pastoralists in Pursuit of the Market.  2006- Page 68 "The historical administrative units of aimag, sum, and bag (Khotont constitutes one of nineteen sums in Arkangai aimag) still form the bases of "&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russia==
In [[Russia]], a sumon is an administrative division of the [[Tuva|Tuva Republic]], and somon is that of the [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryat Republic]].  Both are describing the Russian term "[[selsoviet]]".

'''Taiga''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aɪ|ɡ|ə}}; {{lang-rus|тайга́|p=tɐjˈɡa}}; possibly of [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]&lt;ref&gt;"taiga." ''Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1)''. Random House, Inc. 12 Mar. 2008. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/taiga ''web link'']&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/taiga|title=taiga {{!}} Definition of taiga in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; origin), also known as '''boreal forest''' or '''snow forest''', is a [[biome]] characterized by [[pinophyta|coniferous]] [[forest]]s consisting mostly of [[pine]]s, [[spruce]]s, and [[larch]]es.

The taiga is the world's largest biome apart from the oceans. In North America it covers most of inland [[Canada]], [[Alaska]], and parts of the northern continental United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trails.com/list_11901_list-plants-animals-canadian-wilderness.html |title=List of Plants &amp; Animals in the Canadian Wilderness |publisher=Trails.com |date=2010-07-27 |accessdate=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Eurasia]], it covers most of [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], much of [[Norway]], some of the [[Scottish Highlands]], some lowland/coastal areas of [[Iceland]], much of [[Russia]] from [[Karelia]] in the west to the [[Pacific Ocean]] (including much of [[Siberia]]), and areas of northern [[Kazakhstan]], northern [[Mongolia]], and northern [[Japan]] (on the island of [[Hokkaidō]]). However, the main tree species, the length of the growing season and summer temperatures vary. For example, the taiga of North America mostly consists of spruces; [[Scandinavia]]n and [[Finland|Finnish]] taiga consists of a mix of [[Norway spruce|spruce]], pines and [[Betula|birch]]; Russian taiga has spruces, pines and larches depending on the region, while the [[Eastern Siberian taiga]] is a vast larch forest.

A different use of the term taiga is often encountered in the English language, with "boreal forest" used in the United States and [[Boreal forest of Canada|Canada]] to refer to only the more southerly part of the biome, while "taiga" is used to describe the more barren areas of the northernmost part of the biome approaching the [[tree line]] and the [[tundra]] biome. Hoffman (1958) discusses the origin of this differential use in North America and why it is an inappropriate differentiation of the Russian term. Although at high elevations taiga grades into [[alpine tundra]] through [[Krummholz]], it is not exclusively an alpine biome; and unlike [[Montane ecology#Subalpine zone|subalpine forest]], much of taiga is lowlands.

Taiga is the world's largest land biome, making up 29% of the world's forest cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilds.mb.ca/taiga/tbsfaq.html |title=Taiga biological station: FAQ |publisher=Wilds.mb.ca |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest areas are located in Russia and Canada. The taiga is the terrestrial biome with the lowest annual average temperatures after the [[tundra]] and permanent ice caps. Extreme winter minimums in the northern taiga are typically lower than those of the tundra. The [[Oymyakon|lowest reliably recorded temperatures]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] were recorded in the taiga of northeastern Russia. The taiga or boreal forest has a [[subarctic climate]] with very large temperature range between seasons, but the long and cold winter is the dominant feature. This climate is classified as ''Dfc'', ''Dwc'', ''Dsc'', ''Dfd'' and ''Dwd'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]] scheme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radford.edu/~swoodwar/CLASSES/GEOG235/biomes/taiga/taiga.html |title=radford:Taiga climate |publisher=Radford.edu |accessdate=2011-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609021800/http://www.radford.edu/~swoodwar/CLASSES/GEOG235/biomes/taiga/taiga.html |archivedate=2011-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that the short summer (24&amp;nbsp;h average 10&amp;nbsp;°C (50&amp;nbsp;°F) or more) lasts 1–3 months and always less than 4 months. In Siberian taiga the average temperature of the coldest month is between {{convert|-6|°C}} and {{convert|-50|°C}}.&lt;ref name="VOL page 568"&gt;''Encyclopedia Universalis'' édition 1976 VOL.2 ASIE – Géographie physique, page 568 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some much smaller areas grading towards the oceanic ''Cfc'' climate with milder winters, whilst the extreme south and (in Eurasia) west of the taiga reaches into [[humid continental climate]]s (''Dfb'', ''Dwb'') with longer summers. The mean annual temperature generally varies from −5&amp;nbsp;°C to 5&amp;nbsp;°C (23&amp;nbsp;°F to 41&amp;nbsp;°F),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/boreal.htm |title=Marietta the Taiga and Boreal forest |publisher=Marietta.edu |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there are taiga areas in eastern Siberia and interior Alaska-[[Yukon]] where the mean annual reaches down to −10&amp;nbsp;°C (14&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldclimate.com/cgi-bin/data.pl?ref=N62E129+1102+24959W |title=Yakutsk climate |publisher=Worldclimate.com |date=2007-02-04 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=na0607 |name= Interior Alaska-Yukon lowland taiga |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some sources, the boreal forest grades into a temperate mixed forest when mean annual temperature reaches about 3&amp;nbsp;°C (37&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=na0406 |name=The eastern forest – boreal transition|accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Discontinuous permafrost]] is found in areas with mean annual temperature below 0&amp;nbsp;°C, whilst in the ''Dfd'' and ''Dwd'' climate zones [[continuous permafrost]] occurs and restricts growth to very shallow-rooted trees like [[Siberian larch]]. The winters, with average temperatures below freezing, last five to seven months. Temperatures vary from −54&amp;nbsp;°C to 30&amp;nbsp;°C (−65&amp;nbsp;°F to 86&amp;nbsp;°F) throughout the whole year. The summers, while short, are generally warm and humid. In much of the taiga, −20&amp;nbsp;°C (−4&amp;nbsp;°F) would be a typical winter day temperature and 18&amp;nbsp;°C (64&amp;nbsp;°F) an average summer day.

The [[growing season]], when the vegetation in the taiga comes alive, is usually slightly longer than the climatic definition of summer as the plants of the boreal biome have a lower threshold to trigger growth. In Canada, Scandinavia and Finland, the growing season is often estimated by using the period of the year when the 24-hour average temperature is {{convert|+5|C}} or more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enr.gov.nt.ca/_live/documents/documentManagerUpload/Taiga_Shield_References.pdf Canada: Taiga Shield reference]{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Taiga Plains in Canada, growing season varies from 80 to 150 days, and in the Taiga Shield from 100 to 140 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geography.ridley.on.ca/CGC1D/Students/NORTH/Geography%20Project/Ecozones.htm |title=Climate of Canadian ecozones |publisher=Geography.ridley.on.ca |accessdate=2011-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505201153/https://geography.ridley.on.ca/CGC1D/Students/NORTH/Geography%20Project/Ecozones.htm |archivedate=2011-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources claim 130 days growing season as typical for the taiga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/biomes/forests.php#boreal |title=Berkley: about biomes |publisher=Ucmp.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources mention that 50–100 frost-free days are characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/taiga.htm |title=Taiga |publisher=Blueplanetbiomes |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data for locations in southwest Yukon gives 80–120 frost-free days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yukon.taiga.net/swyukon/frost.cfm |title=Southwest Yukon:Frost-free days |publisher=Yukon.taiga.net |accessdate=2011-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724091601/https://yukon.taiga.net/swyukon/frost.cfm |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The closed canopy boreal forest in [[Kenozersky National Park]] near [[Plesetsk]], [[Arkhangelsk Oblast|Arkhangelsk Province]], Russia, on average has 108 frost-free days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wild-russia.org/bioregion2/2-KenozerskyNP/2_kenoz.htm |title=Kenozersky National Park |publisher=Wild-russia.org |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longest growing season is found in the smaller areas with oceanic influences; in coastal areas of Scandinavia and Finland, the growing season of the closed boreal forest can be 145–180 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anzf31/anz31-123-129.pdf |title=University of Helsinki: Carabid diversity in Finnish taiga |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shortest growing season is found at the northern taiga–tundra [[ecotone]], where the northern taiga forest no longer can grow and the tundra dominates the landscape when the growing season is down to 50–70 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/tundra.htm |title=Tundra |publisher=Blueplanetbiomes |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhptv.org/NatureWorks/nwep8a.htm |title=NatureWorks:Tundra |publisher=Nhptv.org |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 24-hr average of the warmest month of the year usually is 10&amp;nbsp;°C (50&amp;nbsp;°F) or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saskschools.ca/~gregory/arctic/Aintro.html |title=The Arctic |publisher=saskschools.ca |accessdate=2011-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410080512/https://www.saskschools.ca/~gregory/arctic/Aintro.html |archivedate=2011-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; High [[latitude]]s mean that the [[sun]] does not rise far above the horizon, and less [[solar energy]] is received than further south. But the high latitude also ensures very long summer days, as the sun stays above the horizon nearly 20 hours each day, with only around 6 hours of daylight occurring in the dark winters, depending on latitude. The areas of the taiga inside the [[Arctic Circle]] have [[midnight sun]] in mid-summer and [[polar night]] in mid-winter.

The taiga experiences relatively low [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] throughout the year (generally 200–750&amp;nbsp;mm annually, 1,000&amp;nbsp;mm in some areas), primarily as [[rain]] during the summer months, but also as [[fog]] and [[snow]]. This fog, especially predominant in low-lying areas during and after the thawing of frozen Arctic seas, means that sunshine is not abundant in the taiga even during the long summer days. As [[evaporation]] is consequently low for most of the year, precipitation exceeds evaporation, and is sufficient to sustain the dense vegetation growth. Snow may remain on the ground for as long as nine months in the northernmost extensions of the taiga ecozone.&lt;ref&gt;A.P. Sayre, ''Taiga'', (New York: Twenty-First Century Books, 1994) 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, taiga grows to the south of the 10&amp;nbsp;°C July [[Isotherm (contour line)|isotherm]], but occasionally as far north as the 9&amp;nbsp;°C (48&amp;nbsp;°F) July isotherm.&lt;ref&gt;Arno &amp; Hammerly 1984, Arno ''et al.'' 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Rich in spruces, Scots pines in the western Siberian plain, the taiga is dominated by larch in Eastern Siberia, before returning to its original floristic richness on the Pacific shores. Two deciduous trees mingle throughout southern Siberia: birch and [[Populus tremula]].&lt;ref name="VOL page 568"/&gt; [[File:Skjomtinden &amp; Kongsbakktinden from Bogen, 2010 September.JPG|thumb|left|Late September in the [[fjord]]s near [[Narvik]], Norway. This oceanic part of the forest can see more than 1,000 mm precipitation annually and has warmer winters than the vast inland taiga]]
The southern limit is more variable, depending on rainfall; taiga may be replaced by [[forest steppe]] south of the 15&amp;nbsp;°C (59&amp;nbsp;°F) July isotherm where rainfall is very low, but more typically extends south to the 18&amp;nbsp;°C (64&amp;nbsp;°F) July isotherm, and locally where rainfall is higher (notably in eastern [[Siberia]] and adjacent [[Outer Manchuria]]) south to the 20&amp;nbsp;°C (68&amp;nbsp;°F) July isotherm. In these warmer areas the taiga has higher species diversity, with more warmth-loving species such as [[Korean pine]], [[Jezo spruce]], and [[Manchurian fir]], and merges gradually into [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed temperate forest]] or, more locally (on the [[Pacific Ocean]] coasts of North America and Asia), into coniferous [[temperate rainforest]]s where oak and hornbeam appear and join the conifers, birch and [[Populus tremula]].

The area currently classified as taiga in Europe and North America (except Alaska) was [[Wisconsin glaciation|recently glaciated]]. As the glaciers receded they left [[Kettle (geology)|depressions]] in the topography that have since filled with water, creating [[lake]]s and [[bog]]s (especially [[muskeg]] soil) found throughout the taiga.
[[File:Yukon River near Carmacks, Yukon -a.jpg|thumb|right|[[Yukon river|Yukon]], Canada. Several of the world's longest rivers go through the taiga, including [[Ob River|Ob]], [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]], [[Lena River|Lena]], and [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie]].]] In [[Sweden]] the taiga is associated with the [[Norrland terrain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sporrong |first=Ulf |chapter=The Scandinavian landscape and its resources |editor-last=Helle |editor-first=Knut|date=2003 |title=The Cambridge History of Scandinavia |publisher=Cambridge University Press |issue=1 |pages=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soils==
Taiga [[soil]] tends to be young and poor in nutrients. It lacks the deep, organically enriched [[soil profile|profile]] present in temperate deciduous forests.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Sayre, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The thinness of the soil is due largely to the cold, which hinders the development of soil and the ease with which plants can use its nutrients.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Fallen leaves and [[moss]] can remain on the [[forest floor]] for a long time in the cool, moist climate, which limits their organic contribution to the soil; [[acid]]s from [[evergreen]] [[Pine needle|needles]] further leach the soil, creating [[spodosol]], also known as [[podzol]].&lt;ref&gt;Sayre, 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the soil is acidic due to the falling pine needles, the forest floor has only [[lichens]] and some mosses growing on it. In clearings in the forest and in areas with more boreal deciduous trees, there are more herbs and berries growing. Diversity of soil organisms in the boreal forest is high, comparable to the [[tropical rainforest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-10-reveals-true-diversity-life-soils.html |title=Study reveals for first time true diversity of life in soils across the globe, new species discovered |publisher=Physorg.com |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
[[File:BaikalForest (pixinn.net).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Boreal forest near [[Lake Baikal]] in [[Russia]]]]
Since [[North America]] and [[Asia]] used to be connected by the [[Bering land bridge]], a number of animal and plant [[species]] (more animals than plants) were able to colonize both continents and are distributed throughout the taiga biome (see [[Circumboreal Region]]). Others differ regionally, typically with each [[genus]] having several distinct species, each occupying different regions of the taiga. Taigas also have some small-leaved [[deciduous]] trees like [[birch]], [[alder]], [[willow]], and [[Populus|poplar]]; mostly in areas escaping the most extreme winter cold. However, the [[Larix gmelinii|Dahurian larch]] tolerates the coldest winters in the Northern Hemisphere in eastern Siberia. The very southernmost parts of the taiga may have trees such as [[oak]], [[maple]], [[elm]] and [[tilia|lime]] scattered among the conifers, and there is usually a gradual transition into a temperate mixed forest, such as the [[eastern forest-boreal transition]] of eastern Canada. In the interior of the continents with the driest climate, the boreal forests might grade into temperate grassland.

There are two major types of taiga. The southern part is the '''closed canopy forest''', consisting of many closely spaced trees with mossy ground cover. In clearings in the forest, shrubs and wildflowers are common, such as the [[fireweed]]. The other type is the '''lichen woodland''' or '''sparse taiga''', with trees that are farther-spaced and [[lichen]] ground cover; the latter is common in the northernmost taiga.&lt;ref&gt;Sayre, 12-3.&lt;/ref&gt; In the northernmost taiga the forest cover is not only more sparse, but often stunted in growth form; moreover, [[ice pruning|ice pruned]] asymmetric black spruce (in North America) are often seen, with diminished foliage on the windward side.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan, [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=44751 ''Black Spruce: Picea mariana'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. Nicklas Stromberg, November, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005174426/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=44751 |date=2011-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, Scandinavia and Finland, the boreal forest is usually divided into three subzones: The '''high boreal''' (north boreal) or taiga zone; the '''middle boreal''' (closed forest); and the '''southern boreal''', a closed canopy boreal forest with some scattered temperate deciduous trees among the conifers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=George H. La Roi |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/boreal-forest/ |title=Boreal forest |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as maple, elm and oak. This southern boreal forest experiences the longest and warmest growing season of the biome, and in some regions (including Scandinavia, Finland and western Russia) this subzone is commonly used for agricultural purposes. The boreal forest is home to many types of [[berries]]; some are confined to the southern and middle closed boreal forest (such as [[fragaria|wild strawberry]] and [[mitchella repens|partridgeberry]]); others grow in most areas of the taiga (such as [[cranberry]] and [[cloudberry]]), and some can grow in both the taiga and the low arctic (southern part of) tundra (such as [[bilberry]], [[cornus canadensis|bunchberry]] and [[lingonberry]]).

The forests of the taiga are largely [[Pinophyta|coniferous]], dominated by [[larch]], [[spruce]], [[fir]] and [[pine]]. The woodland mix varies according to geography and climate so for example the [[Eastern Canadian forests]] ecoregion of the higher elevations of the [[Laurentian Mountains]] and the northern [[Appalachian Mountains]] in Canada is dominated by balsam fir ''[[Abies balsamea]]'', while further north the [[Eastern Canadian Shield taiga]] of northern Quebec and Labrador is notably black spruce ''[[Picea mariana]]'' and tamarack larch ''[[Larix laricina]]''.

[[Evergreen]] species in the taiga (spruce, fir, and pine) have a number of adaptations specifically for survival in harsh taiga winters, although larch, which is extremely cold-tolerant,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forest.jrc.ec.europa.eu/european-atlas-of-forest-tree-species/atlas-download-page/|title=Forest|website=forest.jrc.ec.europa.eu|access-date=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; is [[deciduous]]. Taiga trees tend to have shallow roots to take advantage of the thin soils, while many of them seasonally alter their [[biochemistry]] to make them more resistant to freezing, called "hardening".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Sayre, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The narrow conical shape of northern conifers, and their downward-drooping limbs, also help them shed snow.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

Because the sun is low in the horizon for most of the year, it is difficult for plants to generate energy from [[photosynthesis]]. Pine, spruce and fir do not lose their leaves seasonally and are able to photosynthesize with their older leaves in late winter and spring when light is good but temperatures are still too low for new growth to commence. The adaptation of evergreen needles limits the water lost due to [[transpiration]] and their dark green color increases their absorption of sunlight. Although precipitation is not a limiting factor, the ground freezes during the winter months and plant roots are unable to absorb water, so desiccation can be a severe problem in late winter for evergreens.
[[File:Ptilium crista-castrensis.jpg|thumb|left|Moss (''[[Ptilium crista-castrensis]]'') cover on the floor of taiga]]

Although the taiga is dominated by coniferous forests, some [[flowering plant|broadleaf trees]] also occur, notably [[birch]], [[aspen]], [[willow]], and [[rowan]]. Many smaller [[herbaceous]] plants, such as [[fern]]s and occasionally [[allium tricoccum|ramps]] grow closer to the ground. Periodic stand-replacing [[wildfire]]s (with return times of between 20–200 years) clear out the tree canopies, allowing sunlight to invigorate new growth on the forest floor. For some species, wildfires are a necessary part of the life cycle in the taiga; some, e.g. [[jack pine]] have cones which only open to release their seed after a fire, dispersing their seeds onto the newly cleared ground; certain species of fungi (such as [[morchella|morels]]) are also known to do this. [[Grass]]es grow wherever they can find a patch of sun, and [[moss]]es and [[lichen]]s thrive on the damp ground and on the sides of tree trunks. In comparison with other biomes, however, the taiga has low biological diversity.
[[File:Fire Morels.jpg|thumb|right|Jack pine cones and morels after fire in a boreal forest.]]

Coniferous trees are the dominant plants of the taiga biome. A very few species in four main genera are found: the evergreen spruce, fir and pine, and the deciduous larch. In North America, one or two species of fir and one or two species of spruce are dominant. Across Scandinavia and western Russia, the [[Scots pine]] is a common component of the taiga, while taiga of the [[Russian Far East]] and [[Mongolia]] is dominated by [[larch]].

==Fauna==
[[File:Brown-bear-in-spring.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brown bear]], [[Kamchatka peninsula]]. Brown bears are among the largest and most widespread taiga [[omnivore]]s.]]
The boreal forest, or taiga, supports a relatively small range of animals due to the harshness of the climate. Canada's boreal forest includes 85 species of [[mammals]], 130 species of fish, and an estimated 32,000 species of [[insect]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hww.ca/hww2.asp?id=354 |title=hww:Nature in the boreal forest biome |publisher=Hww.ca |accessdate=2011-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103083916/https://www.hww.ca/hww2.asp?id=354 |archivedate=2011-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Insects play a critical role as [[pollinator]]s, [[decompose]]rs, and as a part of the food web. Many nesting birds rely on them for food in the summer months. The cold winters and short summers make the taiga a challenging biome for [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s, which depend on environmental conditions to regulate their body temperatures, and there are only a few species in the boreal forest including [[common garter snake|red-sided garter snake]], [[vipera berus|common European adder]], [[blue-spotted salamander]], [[northern two-lined salamander]], [[Siberian salamander]], [[wood frog]], [[northern leopard frog]], [[boreal chorus frog]], [[American toad]], and [[Canadian toad]]. Most hibernate underground in winter. Fish of the taiga must be able to withstand cold water conditions and be able to adapt to life under ice-covered water. Species in the taiga include [[Alaska blackfish]], [[northern pike]], [[walleye]], [[longnose sucker]], [[white sucker]], various species of [[cisco (fish)|cisco]], [[lake whitefish]], [[round whitefish]], [[pygmy whitefish]], [[Arctic lamprey]], various [[Thymallus|grayling]] species, [[brook trout]] (including sea-run brook trout in the Hudson Bay area), [[chum salmon]], [[Hucho taimen|Siberian taimen]], [[lenok]] and [[lake chub]].

The taiga is home to a number of large [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] [[mammal]]s, such as [[moose]] and [[reindeer]]/[[caribou]]. Some areas of the more southern closed boreal forest also have populations of other deer species such as the [[elk]] (wapiti) and [[roe deer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hww.ca/hww2.asp?id=98 |title=Wapiti facts and range |publisher=Hww.ca |accessdate=2011-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103152034/https://www.hww.ca/hww2.asp?id=98 |archivedate=2011-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.borealforest.org/world/mammals/western_roe_deer.htm |title=western roe deer: facts and range |publisher=Borealforest.org |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest animal in the taiga is the [[wood bison]], found in northern Canada, Alaska and has been newly introduced into the Russian far-east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/pn-np/ab/elkisland/ne/ne5.aspx|title=Government of Canada to Send Wood Bison to Russian Conservation Project|access-date=2012-12-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209204726/https://www.pc.gc.ca/pn-np/ab/elkisland/ne/ne5.aspx|archive-date=2013-02-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small mammals of the Taiga biome include [[rodent]] species including [[beaver]], [[squirrel]], [[North American porcupine]] and [[vole]], as well as a small number of [[lagomorph]] species such as [[snowshoe hare]] and [[mountain hare]]. These species have adapted to survive the harsh winters in their native ranges. Some larger mammals, such as [[bear]]s, eat heartily during the summer in order to gain weight, and then go into [[hibernation]] during the winter. Other animals have adapted layers of fur or feathers to insulate them from the cold. Predatory mammals of the taiga must be adapted to travel long distances in search of scattered prey or be able to supplement their diet with vegetation or other forms of food (such as [[raccoon]]s). Mammalian predators of the taiga include [[Canada lynx]], [[Eurasian lynx]], [[stoat]], [[Siberian weasel]], [[least weasel]], [[sable]], [[American marten]], [[North American river otter]], [[European otter]], [[American mink]], [[wolverine]], [[Asian badger]], [[Fisher (animal)|fisher]], [[gray wolf]], [[coyote]], [[red fox]], [[brown bear]], [[American black bear]], [[Asiatic black bear]], [[polar bear]] (only small areas at the taiga – tundra ecotone) and [[Siberian tiger]].

More than 300 species of [[bird]]s have their [[nest]]ing grounds in the taiga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.borealbirds.org/forest.shtml |title=Boreal songbird initiative |publisher=Borealbirds.org |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Siberian thrush]], [[white-throated sparrow]], and [[black-throated green warbler]] [[bird migration|migrate]] to this [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] to take advantage of the long summer days and abundance of [[insect]]s found around the numerous bogs and lakes. Of the 300 species of birds that summer in the taiga only 30 stay for the winter.&lt;ref&gt;Sayre, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; These are either [[carrion]]-feeding or large [[Bird of prey|raptor]]s that can take live mammal prey, including [[golden eagle]], [[rough-legged buzzard]] (also known as the rough-legged hawk), and [[raven]], or else seed-eating birds, including several species of [[grouse]] and [[crossbill]]s.

Wildland Fire 10:405–413.&lt;/ref&gt; The fire history that characterizes an [[ecosystem]] is its ''fire regime'', which has 3 elements: (1) fire type and intensity (e.g., crown fires, severe surface fires, and light surface fires), (2) size of typical fires of significance, and (3) frequency or return intervals for specific land units (Heinselman 1981).&lt;ref name="hein2"&gt;Heinselman, M.L. 1981. Fire intensity and frequency as factors in the distribution and structure of northern ecosystems. p. 7–57 ''in ''Proceedings of the Conference: Fire Regimes in Ecosystem Properties, Dec. 1978, Honolulu, Hawaii. USDA, For. Serv., Washington DC, Gen. Tech. Rep. WO-26.&lt;/ref&gt; The average time within a fire regime to burn an area equivalent to the total area of an ecosystem is its ''fire rotation'' (Heinselman 1973)&lt;ref name="hein1"&gt;Heinselman, M.L. 1973. Fire in the virgin forests of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, Minnesota. Quart. Res. 3:329–382.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''fire cycle'' (Van Wagner 1978).&lt;ref name="van"&gt;Van Wagner, C.E. 1978. Age-class distribution and the forest cycle. Can. J. For. Res. 8:220–227.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Heinselman (1981)&lt;ref name="hein2"/&gt; noted, each physiographic site tends to have its own return interval, so that some areas are skipped for long periods, while others might burn two-times or more often during a nominal fire rotation.

The dominant fire regime in the boreal forest is high-intensity crown fires or severe surface fires of very large size, often more than 10,000 ha, and sometimes more than 400,000 ha (Heinselman 1981).&lt;ref name="hein2" /&gt; Such fires kill entire stands. Fire rotations in the drier regions of western Canada and Alaska average 50–100 years, shorter than in the moister climates of eastern Canada, where they may average 200 years or more. Fire cycles also tend to be long near the tree line in the subarctic spruce-lichen woodlands. The longest cycles, possibly 300 years, probably occur in the western boreal in floodplain white spruce (Heinselman 1981).&lt;ref name="hein2" /&gt;

Amiro et al. (2001)&lt;ref name="amiro" /&gt; calculated the mean fire cycle for the period 1980 to 1999 in the Canadian boreal forest (including taiga) at 126 years. Increased fire activity has been predicted for western Canada, but parts of eastern Canada may experience less fire in future because of greater precipitation in a warmer climate (Flannigan et al. 1998).&lt;ref name="flann"&gt;Flannigan, M.D.; Bergeron, Y.; Engelmark, O.; Wotton, B.M. 1998. Future wildfire in circumboreal forests in relation to global warming. J. Veg. Sci. 9:469–476.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mature boreal forest pattern in the south shows [[Abies balsamea|balsam fir]] dominant on well-drained sites in eastern Canada changing centrally and westward to a prominence of [[Picea engelmannii|white spruce]], with [[Picea mariana|black spruce]] and [[Larix laricina|tamarack]] forming the forests on peats, and with jack pine usually present on dry sites except in the extreme east, where it is absent (Rowe and Scotter 1973).&lt;ref name="rowe4"&gt;Rowe, J.S. and Scotter, G.W. 1973. Fire in the boreal forest. Quaternary Res. 3:444–464. [E3680, Coates et al. 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of fires are inextricably woven into the patterns of vegetation on the landscape, which in the east favour black spruce, paper birch, and jack pine over balsam fir, and in the west give the advantage to aspen, jack pine, black spruce, and birch over white spruce. Many investigators have reported the ubiquity of charcoal under the forest floor and in the upper soil profile, e.g., La Roi (1967).&lt;ref name="la"&gt;La Roi, G.H. 1967. Ecological studies in the boreal spruce–fir forests of the North American taiga. I. Analysis of the vascular flora. Ecol. Monogr. 37:229–253.&lt;/ref&gt; Charcoal in [[soil]]s provided Bryson et al. (1965)&lt;ref name="bryson"&gt;Bryson, R.A.; Irving, W.H.; Larson, J.A. 1965. Radiocarbon and soil evidence of former forest in the southern Canadian tundra. Science 147(3653):46–48.&lt;/ref&gt; with clues about the forest history of an area 280&amp;nbsp;km north of the then current tree line at Ennadai Lake, District Keewatin, Northwest Territories.

Two lines of evidence support the thesis that fire has always been an integral factor in the boreal forest: (1) direct, eye-witness accounts and forest-fire statistics, and (2) indirect, circumstantial evidence based on the effects of fire, as well as on persisting indicators (Rowe and Scotter 1973).&lt;ref name="rowe4" /&gt; The patchwork mosaic of forest stands in the boreal forest, typically with abrupt, irregular boundaries circumscribing homogenous stands, is indirect but compelling testimony to the role of fire in shaping the forest. The fact is that most boreal forest stands are less than 100 years old, and only in the rather few areas that have escaped burning are there stands of white spruce older than 250 years (Rowe and Scotter 1973).&lt;ref name="rowe4" /&gt; The prevalence of fire-adaptive morphologic and reproductive characteristics of many boreal plant species is further evidence pointing to a long and intimate association with fire. Seven of the ten most common trees in the boreal forest—[[jack pine]], [[Pinus contorta|lodgepole pine]], [[aspen]], [[Populus balsamifera|balsam poplar]] (''Populus balsamifera''), [[Betula papyrifera|paper birch]], [[Larix laricina|tamarack]], [[Picea mariana|black spruce]]—can be classed as pioneers in their adaptations for rapid invasion of open areas. White spruce shows some pioneering abilities, too, but is less able than black spruce and the pines to disperse seed at all seasons. Only balsam fir and alpine fir seem to be poorly adapted to reproduce after fire, as their cones disintegrate at maturity, leaving no seed in the crowns.

The oldest forests in the northwest boreal region, some older than 300 years, are of white spruce occurring as pure stands on moist [[floodplain]]s (Rowe 1970).&lt;ref name="rowe3"&gt;Rowe, J.S. 1970. Spruce and fire in northwest Canada and Alaska. p. 245–254 ''in'' Komarek, E.V. (Ed.). Proc. 10th Annual Tall Timbers Fire Ecology Conference, Tallahassee FL.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the frequency of fire is much less than on adjacent uplands dominated by pine, black spruce and aspen. In contrast, in the Cordilleran region, fire is most frequent in the valley bottoms, decreasing upward, as shown by a mosaic of young pioneer pine and broadleaf stands below, and older spruce–fir on the slopes above (Rowe and Scotter 1973).&lt;ref name="rowe4" /&gt; Without fire, the boreal forest would become more and more homogeneous, with the long-lived white spruce gradually replacing pine, aspen, balsam poplar, and birch, and perhaps even black spruce, except on the [[peat]]lands (Raup and Denny 1950).&lt;ref name="raup"&gt;Raup, H.M.; Denny, C.S. 1950. Photointerpretation of the terrain along the southern part of the Alaska highway. US Geol. Surv. Bull. 963-D:95–135.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats==

===Human activities===
[[File:Plesetsk satellite assembling facilities.JPG|thumb|[[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]] is situated in the taiga]]

Large areas of [[Siberia]]'s taiga have been harvested for lumber since the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. Previously, the forest was protected by the restrictions of the Soviet Forest Ministry, but with the collapse of the Union, the restrictions regarding trade with Western nations have vanished. Trees are easy to harvest and sell well, so loggers have begun harvesting Russian taiga evergreen trees for sale to nations previously forbidden by Soviet law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.american.edu/TED/TAIGA.HTM |title=Taiga Deforestation |publisher=American.edu |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]], eight percent of the taiga is protected from development, the provincial government allows forest management to occur on Crown land under rigorous constraints.

The main forestry practice in the boreal forest of Canada is [[clearcutting]], which involves cutting down most of the trees in a given area, then replanting the forest as a monocrop (one species of tree) the following season.

Some of the products from logged boreal forests include [[toilet paper]], copy paper, newsprint, and lumber. More than 90% of boreal forest products from Canada are exported for consumption and processing in the United States.

Some of the larger cities situated in this biome are [[Murmansk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldclimate.com/cgi-bin/data.pl?ref=N68E033+1202+0006410G2 |title=Murmansk climate |publisher=Worldclimate.com |date=2007-02-04 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arkhangelsk]], [[Yakutsk]], [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldclimate.com/cgi-bin/data.pl?ref=N61W149+1302+502820C |title=Anchorage climate |publisher=Worldclimate.com |date=2007-02-04 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yellowknife]], [[Tromsø]], [[Luleå]], and [[Oulu]].

Most companies that harvest in Canadian forests are certified by an independent third party agency such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), Sustainable Forests Initiative (SFI), or the Canadian Standards Association (CSA). While the certification process differs between these groups, all of them include forest stewardship, respect for aboriginal peoples, compliance with local, provincial or national environmental laws, forest worker safety, education and training, and other environmental, business, and social requirements. The prompt renewal of all harvest sites by planting or natural renewal is also required.

===Climate change===
[[File:Snowscape (6701322581).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Seney National Wildlife Refuge]]
During the last quarter of the twentieth century, the zone of latitude occupied by the boreal forest experienced some of the greatest temperature increases on Earth. Winter temperatures have increased more than summer temperatures. The number of days with extremely cold temperatures (e.g., −20 to −40&amp;nbsp;°C (−4 to −40&amp;nbsp;°F) has decreased irregularly but systematically in nearly all the boreal region, allowing better survival for tree-damaging insects. In summer, the daily low temperature has increased more than the daily high temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.arcus.org/witness-the-arctic/2009/3/article/507 |title=Coincidence and Contradiction in the Warming Boreal Forest |doi=10.1029/2005GL023331 |publisher=ARCUS |accessdate=2012-01-14|bibcode=2005GeoRL..3215715W }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Fairbanks, Alaska, the length of the frost-free season has increased from 60–90 days in the early twentieth century to about 120 days a century later. Summer warming has been shown to increase water stress and reduce tree growth in dry areas of the southern boreal forest in central Alaska, western Canada and portions of far eastern Russia. Precipitation is relatively abundant in Scandinavia, Finland, northwest Russia and eastern Canada, where a longer growth season (i.e. the period when sap flow is not impeded by frozen water) accelerate tree growth. As a consequence of this warming trend, the warmer parts of the boreal forests are susceptible to replacement by grassland, parkland or temperate forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.libraryindex.com/pages/3196/Boreal-Forests-Climate-Change.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727080310/http://www.libraryindex.com/pages/3196/Boreal-Forests-Climate-Change.html |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Siberia, the taiga is converting from predominantly needle-shedding larch trees to evergreen conifers in response to a warming climate. This is likely to further accelerate warming, as the evergreen trees will absorb more of the sun's rays. Given the vast size of the area, such a change has the potential to affect areas well outside of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110325022352.htm |title=Russian boreal forests undergoing vegetation change, study shows |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02417.x |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2011-03-25 |accessdate=2012-01-14|bibcode=2011GCBio..17.2370S }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In much of the boreal forest in Alaska, the growth of white spruce trees are stunted by unusually warm summers, while trees on some of the coldest fringes of the forest are experiencing faster growth than previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsminer.com/view/full_story/12094427/article-New-study-states-boreal-forests-shifting-as-Alaska-warms |title=Fairbanks Daily News-Miner – New study states boreal forests shifting as Alaska warms |publisher=Newsminer.com |accessdate=2012-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119115807/https://www.newsminer.com/view/full_story/12094427/article-New-study-states-boreal-forests-shifting-as-Alaska-warms |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lack of moisture in the warmer summers are also stressing the birch trees of central Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morello |first=Lauren |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=forest-changes-in-alaska-reveal-changing-climate |title=Forest Changes in Alaska Reveal Changing Climate |publisher=Scientific American |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insects===
Recent years have seen outbreaks of insect pests in forest-destroying plagues: the spruce-bark beetle (''[[Dendroctonus rufipennis]]'') in [[Yukon]] and Alaska;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/INSTAAR/AW2004/get_abstr.html?id=88 |title=A New Method to Reconstruct Bark Beetle Outbreaks |publisher=Colorado.edu |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[mountain pine beetle]] in [[British Columbia]]; the [[aspen]]-leaf miner; the [[larch sawfly]]; the spruce budworm (''[[Choristoneura fumiferana]]'');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/subsite/budworm |title=Spruce budworm and sustainable management of the boreal forest |publisher=Cfs.nrcan.gc.ca |date=2007-12-05 |accessdate=2011-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202122739/https://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/subsite/budworm |archivedate=2008-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the spruce coneworm.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/journals/pnw_2006_chapin001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pollution===

The effect of [[Sulfur dioxide|sulphur dioxide]] on woody boreal forest species was investigated by Addison et al. (1984),&lt;ref name="add"&gt;Addison, P.A.; Malhotra, S.S.; Khan, A.A. 1984. Effect of sulfur dioxide on woody boreal forest species grown on native soils and tailings. J. Environ. Qual. 13(3):333–336.&lt;/ref&gt; who exposed plants growing on native soils and tailings to 15.2 μmol/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (0.34 ppm) of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; assimilation rate (NAR). The Canadian maximum acceptable limit for atmospheric SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is 0.34 ppm. Fumigation with SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; significantly reduced NAR in all species and produced visible symptoms of injury in 2–20 days. The decrease in NAR of deciduous species (trembling aspen [''Populus tremuloides''], willow [''Salix''], green alder [''Alnus viridis''], and white birch [''Betula papyrifera'']) was significantly more rapid than of [[Pinophyta|conifers]] (white spruce, black spruce [''Picea mariana''], and jack pine [''Pinus banksiana'']) or an evergreen angiosperm (Labrador tea) growing on a fertilized Brunisol. These metabolic and visible injury responses seemed to be related to the differences in S uptake owing in part to higher gas exchange rates for [[deciduous]] species than for [[Pinophyta|conifers]]. Conifers growing in oil sands tailings responded to SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a significantly more rapid decrease in NAR compared with those growing in the Brunisol, perhaps because of predisposing toxic material in the tailings. However, [[Sulfur|sulphur]] uptake and visible symptom development did not differ between conifers growing on the 2 substrates.

Acidification of precipitation by anthropogenic, acid-forming emissions has been associated with damage to vegetation and reduced forest productivity, but 2-year-old white spruce that were subjected to simulated acid rain (at pH 4.6, 3.6, and 2.6) applied weekly for 7 weeks incurred no statistically significant (P 0.05) reduction in growth during the experiment compared with the background control (pH 5.6) (Abouguendia and Baschak 1987).&lt;ref name="abou"&gt;Abouguendia, Z.M.; Baschak, L.A. 1987. Response of two western Canadian conifers to simulated acidic precipitation. Water, Air and Soil Pollution 33:15–22.&lt;/ref&gt; However, symptoms of injury were observed in all treatments, the number of plants and the number of needles affected increased with increasing rain acidity and with time. Scherbatskoy and Klein (1983)&lt;ref name="scher"&gt;Scherbatskoy, T.; Klein, R.M. 1983. Response of spruce Picea glauca and birch Betula alleghaniensis foliage to leaching by acidic mists. J. Environ. Qual. 12:189–195.&lt;/ref&gt; found no significant effect of [[chlorophyll]] concentration in [[white spruce]] at pH 4.3 and 2.8, but Abouguendia and Baschak (1987)&lt;ref name="abou" /&gt; found a significant reduction in white spruce at pH 2.6, while the foliar sulphur content significantly greater at pH 2.6 than any of the other treatments.

==Protection==
[[File:Peatbogg-pine.JPG|thumb|upright|Peat bog in [[Dalarna]], Sweden. [[Bog]]s and peatland are widespread in the taiga. They are home to a unique flora, and store vast amounts of carbon. In western Eurasia, the [[Scots pine]] is common in the boreal forest.]]

Many nations are taking direct steps to protect the ecology of the taiga by prohibiting logging, mining, oil and gas production, and other forms of development. In February 2010 the Canadian government established protection for 13,000 square kilometres of boreal forest by creating a new 10,700-square-kilometre park reserve in the Mealy Mountains area of eastern Canada and a 3,000-square-kilometre waterway provincial park that follows alongside the Eagle River from headwaters to sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nationalgeographic.com/blogs/news/chiefeditor/2010/02/boreal-landscapes-added-to-canada-parks.html|title= Boreal landscapes added to Canada's parks Boreal landscapes added to Canada's parks |last=Braun |first=David|date=February 7, 2010|work=NatGeo News Watch: News Editor David Braun's Eye on the World|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=17 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Canadian provincial governments, Ontario and Quebec, introduced measures in 2008 that would protect at least half of their northern boreal forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gillespie|first=Kerry|title=Ontario to protect vast tract|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/460305|accessdate=25 June 2012|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marsden|first=William|title=Charest promises to protect north|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=129450f0-d3c0-4337-8f09-9977ff6c1f40|accessdate=25 June 2012|newspaper=Montreal Gazette|date=2008-11-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405215648/https://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=129450f0-d3c0-4337-8f09-9977ff6c1f40|archivedate=5 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both provinces admitted it will take years to plan, work with Aboriginal and local communities and ultimately map out precise boundaries of the areas off-limits to development, the measures are expected to create some of the largest protected areas networks in the world once completed. Both announcements came the following year after a letter signed by 1,500 scientists called on political leaders to protect at least half of the boreal forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1,500 Scientists Worldwide Call for Protection of Canada's Boreal Forest|url=http://www.borealbirds.org/scienceletter.shtml|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The taiga stores enormous quantities of [[carbon]], more than the world's temperate and tropical forests combined, much of it in [[wetland]]s and [[peatland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2387060 |title=Boreal forest and global change |date= July 2008|pmid=18006417 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2007.2196 |volume=363 |issue=1501 |journal=Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. |pages=2245–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, current estimates place boreal forests as storing twice as much carbon per unit area as tropical forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: The Carbon the World Forgot|url=http://www.borealbirds.org/carbonreport.shtml|publisher=Boreal Songbird Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural disturbance==
One of the biggest areas of research and a topic still full of unsolved questions is the recurring disturbance of fire and the role it plays in propagating the lichen woodland.&lt;ref name="Kurkowski 1911"&gt;Kurkowski, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon of wildfire by lightning strike is the primary determinant of understory vegetation and because of this, it is considered to be the predominant force behind community and ecosystem properties in the lichen woodland.&lt;ref name="Nilsson 421"&gt;Nilsson, 421.&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of fire is clearly evident when one considers that understory vegetation influences tree seedling germination in the short term and decomposition of biomass and nutrient availability in the long term.&lt;ref name="Nilsson 421"/&gt; The recurrent cycle of large, damaging fire occurs approximately every 70 to 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding the dynamics of this ecosystem is entangled with discovering the successional paths that the vegetation exhibits after a fire. Trees, shrubs, and lichens all recover from fire-induced damage through vegetative reproduction as well as invasion by propagules.&lt;ref name="Johnson 200"&gt;Johnson, 200&lt;/ref&gt; Seeds that have fallen and become buried provide little help in re-establishment of a species. The reappearance of lichens is reasoned to occur because of varying conditions and light/nutrient availability in each different microstate.&lt;ref name="Johnson 200"/&gt; Several different studies have been done that have led to the formation of the theory that post-fire development can be propagated by any of four pathways: self replacement, species-dominance relay, species replacement, or gap-phase self replacement.&lt;ref name="Kurkowski 1911"/&gt; Self replacement is simply the re-establishment of the pre-fire dominant species. Species-dominance relay is a sequential attempt of tree species to establish dominance in the canopy. Species replacement is when fires occur in sufficient frequency to interrupt species dominance relay. Gap-Phase Self-Replacement is the least common and so far has only been documented in Western Canada. It is a self replacement of the surviving species into the canopy gaps after a fire kills another species. The particular pathway taken after a fire disturbance depends on how the landscape is able to support trees as well as fire frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Kurkowski, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; Fire frequency has a large role in shaping the original inception of the lower forest line of the lichen woodland taiga.

It has been hypothesized by Serge Payette that the spruce-moss forest ecosystem was changed into the lichen woodland biome due to the initiation of two compounded strong disturbances: large fire and the appearance and attack of the spruce budworm.&lt;ref name="Payette 289"&gt;Payette, 289.&lt;/ref&gt; The spruce budworm is a deadly insect to the spruce populations in the southern regions of the taiga. J.P. Jasinski confirmed this theory five years later stating “Their [lichen woodlands] persistence, along with their previous moss forest histories and current occurrence adjacent to closed moss forests, indicate that they are an [[alternative stable state]] to the spruce–moss forests”.&lt;ref&gt;Jasinski, 561.&lt;/ref&gt;

* October 23–29: Royalist forces in Brittany and the Vendée briefly capture several cities, but are quickly driven out by the French army. 
* November 1: Bonaparte meets with Sieyès; the two men dislike each other, but agree to a parliamentary coup d'état to replace the Directory. 
* November 3: Bonaparte meets with [[Joseph Fouché|Fouché]], the Minister of Police, who agrees not to interfere with a coup d'état. 
* November 6: The Councils of the Ancients and the Five Hundred offer a banquet to Bonaparte at the former [[Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris|church of Saint Sulpice]]. 
* November 7: General Jourdan proposes that Bonaparte join him in a Jacobin coup d'état against the Directory. Bonaparte refuses.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
* November 9: The [[18 Brumaire|coup d'état of 18 Brumaire]] begins. French troops loyal to Bonaparte occupy key points in Paris. Lucien Bonaparte, the president of the Council of Five Hundred, warns the deputies that a "terrorist" plot against the legislature has been discovered, and asks that the meetings of the Councils, scheduled for the next day, be moved for their security to the [[Château de Saint-Cloud|château of Saint-Cloud]], some 10 kilometers west of Paris. Bonaparte is named [[Commander-in-chief]] of the army in Paris.
* As agreed in advance, two members of the Directory who are complicit in the coup, Sieyès and Ducos, offer their resignation. A third, Barras, is talked into resigning by Talleyrand. The two Jacobin directors, Gohier and [[Jean-François-Auguste Moulin|Moulin]], are arrested by the soldiers of General Moreau and confined at the [[Luxembourg Palace]]. Fouché proposes to arrest the leading Jacobin members of the Council of Five Hundred, but Bonaparte does not feel it is necessary, which proves to be a mistake. By the end of the day, Paris is entirely under the control of Bonaparte and officers loyal to him.
*November 10: As proposed by Bonaparte, the members of the two Councils are transported to the château of Saint-Cloud. 6,000 soldiers have been assembled by Bonaparte there, soldiers who are largely hostile to the Councils because of delays in their pay.
* Bonaparte speaks first to the Council of the Ancients, explaining the need for a change in government.  The upper Council listens in silence and votes without opposition to accept Bonaparte's proposal.  Bonaparte then addresses the Council of Five Hundred, meeting in the ''orangerie'' of the domain of Saint-Cloud. Here his reception is much different: the Jacobin members protest angrily, insult and shout down Bonaparte, threatening to declare him outside the law, which would have led to his immediate arrest.  While the Council debated in great confusion inside, Lucien Bonaparte takes Bonaparte outside, and tells the waiting soldiers that the deputies had tried to assassinate Bonaparte. The soldiers, furious, invade the meeting hall and chase out the deputies at the point of bayonets. In the absence of the opposition deputies, two parliamentary commissions name Bonaparte, Sieyès and Duclos as the provisional consuls of a new government.
* November 11–22: Bonaparte and the two other Provisional Consuls form a new government, [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier|Berthier]] as minister of War, Talleyrand in charge of foreign relations, Fouché as minister of Police, and Cambacérès as minister of Justice. 
* December 1: Bonaparte rejects a constitution proposed by Sieyès. 
* December 24: The Councils, now firmly under the control of Bonaparte, adopt the [[Constitution of the Year VIII]]. The new [[French Consulate|Consulate]] is formally established, with Bonaparte as First Consul, Cambacérès as Second Consul, and [[Charles-François Lebrun, duc de Plaisance|Charles-François Lebrun]] as Third Consul. Traditional histories mark this date as the end of the [[French Revolution]] . {{Sfn|Tulard, Fayard and Fierro|page=410}}

[[File:Traffic Tower, Meriden CT.jpg|thumb|Traffic Tower, Meriden Connecticut - 2014]]

A '''traffic tower''' is a permanent raised structure providing a clearer view of traffic conditions than can be had from street level and protection for the traffic controller from the hazards of moving vehicles.

Some traffic towers are fitted with manually operated lights and/or signals.  Other traffic towers rely on handsignals to direct traffic.  In some cases, traffic towers offer a central control location for lights at more than one intersection.

Many traffic towers have been replaced by automated [[traffic lights]].  Many remaining traffic towers are significant landmarks and have been retained or moved to other locations as historic structures.

The last remaining traffic tower in the United Kingdom is in [[Bicester, Oxfordshire]].

[[File:Gammelströmmen, Tyresö, 2007-06-25, inlet of Tyresö-Flaten.jpeg|thumb|Gammelströmmen. the inflow of lake Tyresö-Flaten.]]
'''Tyresö-Flaten''' is a [[lake]] in [[Tyresö Municipality]], south of [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].

The lake forms part of the [[Tyresån Lake System]] and as such is considered important for recreational activities such as angling and bathing.&lt;ref name="Tyresö" /&gt;  Common fish species include [[European perch|Perch]], [[Zander]] [[Northern pike|Pike]], [[Trout|Lake trout]]&lt;!--- Insjööring ---&gt;, [[Carp Bream]], and [[Rutilus|Roach]].&lt;ref name="Tyresö-fish"&gt;Tyresö Municipality, ''Fiske''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental impact ==
When water stagnate in late summer [[hydrogen sulfide]] and oxygen shortage occurs in lake sediments.  However, level of bacteria are low and the lake is considered safe for bathing. No contaminations except nutritive salt have been reported.&lt;ref name="Tyresö" /&gt;

The '''Union of South American Nations''' ('''USAN'''; {{lang-es|links=no|Unión de Naciones Suramericanas}}, '''UNASUR'''; {{lang-pt|links=no|União de Nações Sul-Americanas}}, '''UNASUL'''; {{lang-nl|links=no|Unie van Zuid-Amerikaanse Naties}}, '''UZAN'''; and sometimes referred to as the '''South American Union''') is an [[Intergovernmentalism|intergovernmental]] [[regional organization]] comprising twelve South American countries.

The [[UNASUR Constitutive Treaty]] was signed on 23 May 2008, at the Third Summit of Heads of State, held in [[Brasília]], Brazil.&lt;ref name=bbc2 /&gt; According to the Constitutive Treaty, the Union's headquarters will be located in [[Quito]], Ecuador.&lt;ref name=bloomberg1/&gt; On 1 December 2010, Uruguay became the ninth state to ratify the UNASUR treaty, thus giving the union full legality.&lt;ref name=buenosairesherald1/&gt;&lt;ref name=MercoPress2/&gt; As the Constitutive Treaty entered into force on 11 March 2011, UNASUR became a legal entity during a meeting of Foreign Ministers in [[Ciudad Mitad del Mundo|Mitad del Mundo]], Ecuador, where they had laid the foundation stone for the Secretariat Headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telesurtv.net/secciones/noticias/89973-NN/sede-de-unasur-llevara-el-nombre-de-nestor-kirchner |title=Sede de Unasur llevará el nombre de Néstor Kirchner |publisher=telesur |language=Spanish |date=9 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901073430/http://www.telesurtv.net/secciones/noticias/89973-NN/sede-de-unasur-llevara-el-nombre-de-nestor-kirchner/ |archivedate=1 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[South American Parliament]] will be located in [[Cochabamba]], Bolivia, while the headquarters of its bank, the [[Bank of the South]] are located in [[Caracas]], Venezuela.&lt;ref name=bloomberg1 /&gt;

On 4 May 2010, at a heads of state summit held in [[Campana, Buenos Aires Province|Campana]], {{convert|75|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Buenos Aires]], former Argentine President [[Néstor Kirchner]] was unanimously elected the first [[Secretary General of UNASUR]] for a two-year term. The new post was conceived as a first step towards the creation of a permanent bureaucratic body for a [[supranational union]], which will eventually replace the political bodies of [[Mercosur]] and CAN.

==Overview==
At the [[2004 South American Summit|Third South American Summit]] on 8 December 2004, presidents or representatives from 12 South American nations signed the ''[[Cusco Declaration]]'', a two-page statement of intent announcing the foundation of the South American Community. Panama and Mexico attended the signing ceremony as observers in Brazil.

The mechanics of the new entity came out of the First South American Community of Nations Heads of State Summit, which was held in Brasília on 29–30 September 2005. An important operating condition of UNASUR is that no new institutions will be created in the first phase, so as not to increase [[bureaucracy]], and the community will use the existing institutions belonging to the previous [[trade blocs]].

===Background===

{{main|Latin American integration}}
{{see also|Pan-Americanism}}
[[File:Presidentes de países da América do Sul durante a primeira reunião do CASA (4).jpg|thumb|left|Heads of State of the then South American Community of Nations in [[Brasilia]] in September 2005.]]
Between the 15th and 19th centuries, the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese]] colonization brought about the establishment and development of [[colonial empire]]s in the Americas that integrated politically, economically and culturally vast extensions of the continent each with their respective metropolis.

Since the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] a trend towards the political integration of the newly born republics of [[Hispanic America]] became strong in the thinking of several independence leaders, influenced in turn by the [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spanish Enlightenment]] and the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution|American]] revolutions. A notable early exponent of this trend was [[Francisco de Miranda]], who envisioned a federated republic encompassing all of Hispanic America, which he called "Colombia".

The independence war efforts saw the concurrence of integrated armies composed by Spanish Americans of diverse regions on both sides of the conflict (v.g. [[Patriot (Spanish American Revolution)|Patriots]] and [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|Royalists]]), and fighting all over the territories of many future nations. For example, the [[Army of the Andes]] which was gathered in the [[United Provinces of the River Plate]] fought in [[Chilean War of Independence|Chile]], [[Peruvian War of Independence|Peru]] and Ecuador, and later integrated with [[Military career of Simón Bolívar|Simón Bolívar's Army]] (which itself included troops of future Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador) to further fight in Peru and the [[Upper Peru]].

By the 1820s, the main proponent of a federation of the newly born republics was [[Simón Bolívar]], although this idea was shared by many notable contemporaries, including [[José de San Martín]] and [[Bernardo de Monteagudo]], under either republican or constitutional monarchical governments. In 1826, Bolívar summoned a conference to be held in Panama, which was to be known as the [[Congress of Panama|"Amphictyonic" Congress of Panama]] because of the parallelism with the Hellenic [[Amphictyonic League]]. The Congress was attended by [[Gran Colombia]] (including present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Panama and Ecuador), the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] (including present-day Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala), the [[United Mexican States (1824–1864)|United Mexican States]], and Peru. The ostensible intention was to form a defensive league that could prevent foreign expansionism and foster the interests of the Spanish American republics. The Congress' conclusions, however, were not ratified by the participants, except for Gran Colombia. Soon after, both Gran Colombia and the United Provinces of Central America fell apart and the whole of Hispanic America was [[Balkanization|balkanized]] by competing national governments.

By the 1990s, however, Brazil had consolidated as the most powerful country in South America (accounting for half of the regional GDP) and began to promote the notion of a united South America (a new regional framing) where Brasilia would be pivotal. The project did not take hold until the United States' foreign policy priorities turned to other regions in the 2000s.

===Formation===
{{main|Cusco Declaration}}
[[File:Unasul 12.jpg|thumb|South American presidents gathered during an extraordinary meeting for the signing of the [[UNASUR Constitutive Treaty]] in May 2008 in Brasilia.]]
The complete integration between the Andean Community and the [[Mercosur]] nations was formalized during the meeting of South American heads of state that took place on 23 May 2008 in [[Brasília]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agenciabrasil.gov.br/noticias/2008/05/08/materia.2008-05-08.7468185918/view Ministros da América do Sul vão a Caracas preparar encontro da Unasul] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705233544/http://www.agenciabrasil.gov.br/noticias/2008/05/08/materia.2008-05-08.7468185918/view |date=5 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2004 South American Summit]], representatives of twelve South American nations signed the [[Cuzco Declaration]], a two-page letter of intent announcing the establishment of the then-named "South American Community of Nations". Panama and Mexico were present as observers. The leaders announced the intention of modeling the new community in the mold of the [[European Union]], including a unified passport, a parliament and, eventually, a single currency. The then Secretary General of the Andean Community [[Allan Wagner]] speculated that an advanced union such as the EU should be possible within the next fifteen years.

===Naming===
[[File:Kirchner-UN General Assembly (2007).jpg|thumb|[[Néstor Kirchner]], first Secretary General of UNASUR]]
On 28 December 2005, Chilean former foreign minister Ignacio Walker proposed that the Union's former designation, the '''South American Community of Nations''', abbreviated as '''CSN''', be changed to ''South American Union''; nevertheless, many members responded that that proposal had already been rejected to prevent confusion since its acronym of U.S.A. (Spanish: ''Unión Sudamericana'') would be easily confused for the United States of America. In the press, the phrase "United States of South America" was bandied about as an [[analogy]] to the United States to reflect the economic and political power that the union would have on the world stage.&lt;ref&gt;The phrase has been used in the past for this same purpose. It has never been officially proposed or used. Collazo, Ariel B.

The name was finally changed on 16 April 2007 to ''Union of South American Nations''. The new name was jointly agreed by all member states during the first day of meeting at the First [[South American Energy Summit]],&lt;ref name=terra1 /&gt; held at [[Isla Margarita]], Venezuela.

=== Leadership crisis ===
After Colombian Ernesto Samper completed his term as Secretary General in January 2017, the UNASUR governments have been unable to reach consensus on the organization's future leadership.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Venezuela, with the support of Bolivia and Suriname, has blocked the nomination of Argentine diplomat José Octavio Bordón.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://es.mercopress.com/2018/04/23/convocan-a-reunion-de-unasur-en-mayo-para-intentar-superar-division|title=Convocan a reunión de Unasur en mayo para intentar superar división|last=|first=|date=23 April 2018|work=MercoPress|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, six members of UNASUR—Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay and Peru—joined in forming the Lima Group, a coalition of Western Hemisphere nations that repudiates the Venezuela government of Nicolás Maduro as antidemocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/es/grupo-de-lima/t-41378602|title=Grupo de Lima {{!}} América Latina|date=14 November 2017|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|accessdate=15 February 2018|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, Maduro was disinvited from the [[8th Summit of the Americas|Summit of the Americas]] hosted by Peru (held in Lima in April 2018). In response, Bolivia's leftist president [[Evo Morales]] urged Unasur to defend Venezuela, stating "Unasur should call an emergency meeting and enforce the sovereignty of a brotherly people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Evo-Morales-Unasur-Must-Reinforce-Venezuelan-Sovereignty-20180213-0034.html|title=Evo Morales: 'Unasur Must Reinforce Venezuelan Sovereignty'|last=|first=|date=13 February 2018|work=teleSUR|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morales acceded to the rotating role of president [[pro tempore]] of UNASUR on 17 April 2018.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On 20 April 2018, six countries—Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay and Peru—announced that they would suspend their own membership for a year until the regional group became more organized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/6-countries-suspend-membership-in-unasur-regional-bloc/2018/04/21/0b52ce72-4519-11e8-b2dc-b0a403e4720a_story.html|title=6 countries suspend membership in UNASUR regional bloc|last=|first=|date=2018-04-21|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=2018-04-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180421062416/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/6-countries-suspend-membership-in-unasur-regional-bloc/2018/04/21/0b52ce72-4519-11e8-b2dc-b0a403e4720a_story.html|archive-date=2018-04-21|dead-url=yes|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chilean Foreign Minister Roberto Ampuero stated that the organization "isn't getting anywhere, there is no integration" and that "We can't be throwing this money to an institution that doesn't work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-bc-ams-gen-chile-unasur-20180423-story.html|title=UNASUR, posible signo de fracaso en integración regional|last=Associated Press|first=|date=23 April 2018|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A briefing sent to the Brazilian cabinet stated that the countries share the view that Bolivia's leadership of the block has been ineffective.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2018/04/21/unasur-under-pressure-six-nations-including-brazil-and-argentina-suspend-their-memberships|title=Unasur under pressure: six nations, including Brazil and Argentina, suspend their memberships|last=|first=|date=21 April 2018|work=MercoPress|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paraguayan Foreign Minister stated that his country's objection concerned the failure to put a new Secretary General in place, and the need to make the organization less ideological, but did not reflect negatively on Bolivia's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eldeber.com.bo/mundo/Paraguay-ve-necesario-redireccionar-a-Unasur--20180423-7141.html|title=Paraguay ve necesario 'redireccionar' a Unasur|last=EFE|first=|date=24 April 2018|website=www.eldeber.com.bo|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bolivian Foreign Minister Fernando Huanacuni called an emergency meeting for May 2018 to attempt to resolve the crisis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Countries renouncing the treaty ===
==== Colombia ====
On 28 August 2018, Colombian president [[Iván Duque]] announced that foreign minister [[Carlos Holmes Trujillo|Carlos Holmes]] had officially notified Unasur of their intention to leave the bloc within the next 6 months, denouncing it as an institution created by Hugo Chávez to sideline existing international treaties and referring to it as an accomplice to what they referred to as the [[Human rights in Venezuela|dictatorship in Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eltiempo.com/politica/gobierno/colombia-oficializa-su-retiro-de-unasur-por-carta-enviada-260910|title='En seis meses, Colombia estará oficialmente fuera de Unasur': Duque|last=|first=|date=2018-08-28|work=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]|access-date=2018-08-28|language=es-CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/latinoamerica/ivan-duque-nos-retiramos-unasur-por-denunciar-crisis-venezuela_249588|title=Iván Duque: Nos retiramos de la Unasur por no denunciar crisis en Venezuela|last=|first=|date=2018-08-28|work=[[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]]|access-date=2018-08-28|language=es-VE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aporrea.org/internacionales/n330495.html|title=(VIDEO) Iván Duque: Colombia saldrá oficialmente de Unasur en seis meses|last=|first=|date=2018-08-28|work=[[Aporrea]]|access-date=2018-08-28|language=es-VE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:UNASUR (Ecuador).jpg|thumb|left|Former headquarters of UNASUR]]

The presidents of each member nation will have an annual meeting, which will be the top political mandate. The first meeting was held in [[Brasilia]] on 29 and 30 September 2005. The second meeting was held in [[Cochabamba]], Bolivia, on 8 and 9 December 2006. The third meeting was held in Brasília – this meeting should have taken place in Indias (Colombia), but was postponed because of tension between Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela. It was at this meeting that UNASUR was formalized and in which the [[UNASUR Constitutive Treaty|Constitutive Treaty]] of the organization was signed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itamaraty.gov.br/sala-de-imprensa/notas-a-imprensa/entrada-em-vigor-do-tratado-constitutivo-da-unasul Entrada em vigor do Tratado Constitutivo da UNASUL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201145605/http://www.itamaraty.gov.br/sala-de-imprensa/notas-a-imprensa/entrada-em-vigor-do-tratado-constitutivo-da-unasul |date=1 February 2012 }}. [[Ministério das Relações Exteriores do Brasil]]. Access in 14 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The foreign ministers of each country will meet once every six months. They will make concrete proposals for action and executive decision. The Permanent Representative Committee of the President of [[Mercosur]] and the Director of the Mercosur Department, the Secretary General of the [[Andean Community]], the Secretary General of [[ALADI]] and the Permanent Secretaries of any institution for regional cooperation and integration, [[Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization]], Among others, will also attend these meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itamaraty.gov.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2394:reuniao-extraordinaria-do-conselho-de-ministras-e-ministros-das-relacoes-exteriores-da-unasul&amp;catid=42:notas&amp;lang=pt-br&amp;Itemid=280 |title=Reunião Extraordinária do Conselho de Ministras e Ministros das Relações Exteriores da UNASUL |date=12 March 2014 |publisher=[[Ministério das Relações Exteriores do Brasil]] |accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

On 9 December 2005, the Strategic Reflection Commission on the South American Integration Process was created. It consists of 12 members, whose function is to elaborate proposals that will help in the process of integration among the South American nations. These proposals were to be made at the 2nd UNASUR Meeting (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://noticias.uol.com.br/ultnot/efe/2006/05/30/ult1767u68341.jhtm |title=Brasil e Chile reafirmam aposta na integração sul-americana |publisher=[[Universo Online|UOL]] |date=30 May 2006 |accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Executive Committee, created at the 2nd UNASUR Meeting, was transformed into the Political Commission or Council of Deputies, in accordance with the Decisions of the Political Dialogue. The text prepared by heads of state to form UNASUR was approved at the 3rd UNASUR Meeting in Brasília on 23 May 2008. This meeting was scheduled to take place in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 24–28 January 2008, but was postponed because of tensions between Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela.

===Secretary General===
{{main article|Secretary General of the Union of South American Nations}}

[[File:Ernesto Samper (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ernesto Samper]], the most recent [[Secretary General of the Union of South American Nations|Secretary General]].]]
A Secretary General is the legal representative of the Secretariat in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]]. Former Ecuadorian president [[Rodrigo Borja]] was nominated to this position but resigned a few days before the formation of the USAN in May 2008. On 4 May, [[Néstor Kirchner]] of Argentina was appointed as the first Secretary General, despite resistance from Colombia, Uruguay, and Peru. After the death of Néstor Kirchner in 2010, there was a period of time when the position went unfilled, which eventually ended when [[María Emma Mejía Vélez]] was elected in March 2011. After Ernesto Samper completed his term in January 2017, UNASUR members have been unable to come to consensus on a successor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Economic and Financial Council of Unasur was established on 12 August 2011, in [[Buenos Aires]], during a meeting of Finance Ministers and representatives of the Central Banks of the twelve countries of the region. Argentine Deputy Economy Minister Roberto Feletti said that the Council would study measures to strengthen regional trade in national currencies without the use of dollar. "We have reached an agreement on three axes of work and one of them is to move forward with multilateral payment mechanisms, to sustain trade and protect the volumes of reserves," Feletti said, noting that trade between countries in the region moves 120&amp;nbsp;billion dollars Yearly. "The use of national currencies, excluding the dollar, protects reserves and increases trade because there are lower transaction rates." He also detailed plans of the technical groups focused on the development and strengthening of Development Banks, such as the Andean Development Corporation (CAF) and the [[Bank of the South]]. He explained that the technicians will review the Latin American Reserve Fund (FLAR), aiming at in order to give greater capacity to intervene to the governments of the bloc in case of speculative attacks against currency or [[sovereign debt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://economia.estadao.com.br/noticias/economia+geral,ministros-da-unasul-querem-ampliar-comercio-sem-dolar,80031,0.htm Ministros da Unasul querem ampliar comércio sem dólar].

The Health Council aims to strengthen, by establishing a South American political institution with expertise in sanitary issues, the development of solutions to challenges that transcend national borders, developing values and mutual interests among the neighboring countries, thus facilitating the interaction of the Member States health authorities through the exchange of knowledge and technology in the region.
The South American Health Council (SHC) is composed of the Health Ministries of Unasur Member States. In order to achieve the Council’s goals, the Coordinating Committee – responsible for preparing propositions of Agreements and Resolutions – was created.

It is in charge of coordinating the activities of all its bodies and managing the Technical Secretary. The Pro Tempore President has a two-year term that may be extended for another two years, being unconditionally succeeded by a president from a different country.
The SHC is supported by the Technical Secretary in charge of the Pro Tempore Presidency (PTP) and two countries of the previous and following PTP, in order to ensure the continuity of works. It is technically supported by the South American Institute for Government in Health ([[South American Institute of Government in Health|ISAGS]]).

The population is formed by descendants of Europeans (mainly [[Spaniards]], Portuguese and Italians), [[Africans]] and [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]]. There is a high percentage of [[mestizos]] that vary greatly in composition according to each place. There is also a minor population of [[Asians]], especially in Brazil. The two main languages are by far Spanish and Portuguese, followed by French, English and Dutch in smaller numbers. Economically, Brazil, Argentina and Colombia are the wealthiest and most developed nations in the continent.{{Citation needed|reason=Chile and Uruguay tend to do better in measures of human development and happiness; this needs clarification as well|date=February 2018}}

In recent decades the economies of South America have been transformed into fully competitive and efficient markets. In recent years, one characteristic of the economy of UNASUR has been its excessive growth and high competitiveness, leading to world profits alongside China and India. This economic situation is marked by policies favoring market opening, aimed at the exploitation of natural resources, industrialization and a very attractive destination for investors. In spite of all this, the situation is marked by immense regional differences and by an irregularity in the distribution of the income that stands out at world level, although it is recognized as one of the regions of the world where poverty and inequality have been reduced more energetically in recent decades.

There are regions with very high industrialization, where the main economic flows move, while there are sectors where there are hardly any industries. Most of the possessions are concentrated in the hands of a minority of the population, whereas millions of individuals experience different levels of privations arriving, in extreme cases, to the absolute poverty. However, it is necessary to emphasize that poverty in South America has been reduced in a surprising way, especially in the [[Southern Cone]] and North of South America. Today, thanks to the development of many South American nations, it has allowed the world, their eyes on some governments, even forming part of economic blocs like [[G20]] and [[BRICS]]. Although this reality is common to the entire South American group, the countries of the so-called Southern Cone (Argentina, [[South Region, Brazil|southern Brazil]], Chile, and Uruguay) present more positive socioeconomic data and high [[Human Development Index|HDI]] rates.

The South American economy is divided between the mineral extractivism in the Amazon region and the agriculture present in practically all its States. Industrialization is of medium level to high in diverse regions, although very strong the presence of local industries of origin Foreign (multinational). The extraction and export of oil is notable in Venezuela, which owns some of the largest world reserves, in Argentina and in the Atlantic Ocean compared to the Brazilian states of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] and [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]]. Bolivia stands out for the production of natural gas, with important reserves of this matter that in recent years have led to what has been known as the "Gas War."

The richest and most industrialized regions of the continent are: São Paulo State in Brazil, where its main financial center (in its capital), the main technological centers in South America ([[São Carlos]], [[São José dos Campos]] and [[Campinas]]) and its largest and most mobile port -; Followed by the Fluvial-Industrial axis of Paraná between [[Rosario]] and [[La Plata]] in Argentina centered in Buenos Aires (second most active port and city with higher GDP); And for the also Brazilian State of Rio de Janeiro.

Brazil and Argentina are considered the regional leaders of South America. They are the two largest nations and the two largest economies in South America. These are the only South American countries that are members of the G-20 and Brazil, specially, as member of the BRICS. They're also the largest producers and exporters of agricultural products of the continent.

The highest [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|nominal GDP]] in 2017 is Brazil (8th worldwide) with 2,140,940&amp;nbsp;trillion dollars, followed by Argentina (21st worldwide) with 628,935&amp;nbsp;billion dollars, and Colombia (31st at the global level) with 306,439&amp;nbsp;billion dollars.

The highest [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|GDP]] in 2017 is in Brazil (8th worldwide) with 3,216&amp;nbsp;billion dollars, Argentina (27th worldwide) with 913&amp;nbsp;billion dollars, and Colombia (31st Worldwide) with 720&amp;nbsp;billion dollars.

The highest [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP per capita]] in 2017 is held by Chile with US$24,113, followed by Uruguay with 21,527 and Argentina with 20,047. In terms of [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|nominal per capita GDP]], the ranking is headed by Uruguay with US$15,679, Chile with US$13,576, and Argentina with US$12,503.

The [[Initiative for the Integration of the Regional Infrastructure of South America]] is currently underway, with investments estimated at US$38&amp;nbsp;billion from the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], the Andean Development Corporation, the [[Brazilian Development Bank|National Bank for Economic and Social Development]] and the Financial Fund for Development of the Plata Basin.&lt;ref name="Integração"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.integracao.gov.br/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=33da18bd-46e0-4700-af1d-774790f8f31e&amp;groupId=10157 |title=Iniciativa para a Integração da Infraestrutura Regional Sul-Americana (IIRSA) |publisher=[[Ministério da Integração Nacional]] |accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial integration plans through the infrastructure cooperation of UNASUR came with the construction of the Bioceanic Corridor and the [[Interoceanic Highway]]. Roads that will link more firmly the countries of the [[Pacific coast]], especially Chile and Peru, with the countries of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast]] like Brazil and Argentina, extending highways through the continent, allowing better connections of the ports to Bolivia and more internal parts of Argentina, Peru And Brazil. The Pacific Highway, between Peru and Brazil, began to be built in September 2005, financed 60% by Brazil and 40% by Peru, and was completed in December 2010.&lt;ref name="Integração"/&gt;

The South American Energy Ring will interconnect Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay with natural gas from various sources, such as the Camisea Gas project in Peru and the Tarija gas deposits in Bolivia. Although this proposal has been signed and ratified, political and economic difficulties in Argentina and Bolivia have delayed this initiative, and to this day, this agreement remains more a protocol than a current project, since Chile and Brazil are already building LNG terminals for Gas from external suppliers.&lt;ref name="Integração"/&gt;

===Economic development===
[[File:GDP PPP 2017 Selection.svg|lang=en|250px|thumb|Selection of GDP PPP data (top 10 countries and blocks) in no particular order]]
Presidents of the seven founding countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Paraguay, Venezuela and Uruguay) officially launched the South American Bank in Buenos Aires in December 2007.  The heads of all the founding countries were at the ceremony, with the exception of President [[Tabaré Vázquez]] of Uruguay. The capital will be US$7b, with Venezuela responsible for US$3b and Brazil US$2b. The headquarters will be located in Caracas with offices in Buenos Aires and La Paz.&lt;ref name=MercoPress1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc1 /&gt;

The [[Bank of the South]] will finance economic development projects to improve local competitiveness and to promote the scientific and technological development of the member states. Its founding charter affirms that the bank will promote projects in a "stable and equal" manner and priorities will be oriented towards reinforcing South American integration, reducing asymmetries, and promoting an egalitarian distribution of investments.

The Brazilian Minister, Guido Mantega, stated that the bank is not similar to the [[International Monetary Fund]]; it will be a credit institution similar to the [[World Bank]].

===Monetary policy===
{{main article|Single South American currency|Bank of the South}}
[[File:Banco del Sur.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Rafael Correa]], [[Evo Morales]], [[Néstor Kirchner]], [[Cristina Fernández]], [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], [[Nicanor Duarte]], and [[Hugo Chávez]] at the signing of the founding charter of the Bank of the South]]
The [[Bank of the South]] (Portuguese: Banco do Sul, Spanish: Banco del Sur, Dutch: Bank van het Zuiden, English: Bank of the South) will establish monetary policy and finance development projects. One of the objectives of monetary union is to establish a [[Single South American currency]]. Support for the creation of this currency was provided in January 2007 by Peruvian President [[Alan García]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/200701/17/eng20070117_342024.html ''Peruvian president calls for single currency in South America'']. People's Daily Online (17/01/07). Retirado em 22 de setembro de 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and other South American authorities expressed themselves in favor, as Bolivian President [[Evo Morales]] in April of that year, who proposed that the currency Only one denominated "Pacha" ("earth" in [[Quechua language]]), however, except for the right of each country to suggest a name for the common currency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cut.org.br/site/start.php?infoid=9375&amp;sid=22 Evo propõe criação de moeda única para a Unasul] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116101124/http://www.cut.org.br/site/start.php?infoid=9375&amp;sid=22 |date=16 November 2016 }}. Retirado em 21 de Janeiro de 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The South American economy is divided between mineral industry in the Amazon region and agriculture, which is present in practically all member states. Industrialization is advanced in several regions, although there is a strong presence of local industries of foreign (multinational) origin. In Brazil and Argentina the level of industrialization is intense.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121215061601/http://www.analitica.com/zonaempresarial/5690854.asp La industria bancaria latinoamericana contemplará más inversiones, dice un nuevo reporte de Economist Intelligence Unit Strategica Comunicación Global], 9 June 2008. Accessadate 18 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defense policy==
{{main article|South American Defense Council}}
[[File:Unasul 1.jpg|left|thumb|Soldier of the [[Brazilian Army]] patrols the surroundings of the Summit of Heads of State of Unasur in 2008, held in Brasilia.]]

The [[South American Defense Council]] (CDS) was proposed by Venezuela and Brazil to serve as a mechanism for regional security, promoting military co-operation. From the beginning Brazil, Argentina and Chile, the countries that took the leadership of the project, made clear that they did not intend to form a [[NATO]]-like alliance, but a cooperative security arrangement, enhancing multilateral military cooperation, promoting confidence and security building measures and fostering defense industry exchange. Colombia initially refused to join the defense council due to the strong military ties it has with the United States through the [[Plan Colombia]]. However, after reviewing the proposal they decided to join on 20 July 2008.&lt;ref name=ecodiario1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=people1 /&gt;

Shortly following the signing by Colombia's President, President of Chile [[Michelle Bachelet]] appointed a working group to investigate and draft a plan for the new council. Finally, on 10 March 2009, the 12 nation members held, in Chile, the first meeting of the newly formed council.&lt;ref name=coha1 /&gt;

In mid-2010, UNASUR played a key role in mediating the [[2010 Colombia–Venezuela diplomatic crisis]]. On 1 September 2010, the agency "UnasurHaití" was created to provide US$100&amp;nbsp;million in help to Haiti.&lt;ref name=pagina12 /&gt;

==Democracy==
[[File:Bicentenario Argentina - Presidentes.jpg|thumb|South American presidents in front of the [[Casa Rosada]], Buenos Aires, during the bicentenary of the [[May Revolution]].]]
On 26 November 2010, the Additional Protocol on Commitment to Democracy was signed in the city of [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], [[Cooperative Republic of Guyana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itamaraty.gov.br/temas/america-do-sul-e-integracao-regional/unasul/protocolo-adicional-ao-tratado-constitutivo-da-unasul-sobre-compromisso-com-a-democracia Protocolo Adicional ao Tratado Constitutivo da Unasul sobre Compromisso com a Democracia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630031333/http://www.itamaraty.gov.br/temas/america-do-sul-e-integracao-regional/unasul/protocolo-adicional-ao-tratado-constitutivo-da-unasul-sobre-compromisso-com-a-democracia |date=30 June 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol derives from the mandate established in the Buenos Aires Declaration of 1 October 2010, which affirms that member states will not tolerate a challenge to institutional authority, nor attempt to strike a legitimately constituted civilian power, adopting concrete and immediate measures in case of breach of constitutional order. It is applicable "in the event of a breach or threat of a breach of the democratic order, of a violation of the constitutional order or in any situation that endangers the legitimate exercise of power and the observance of democratic values and principles."&lt;ref name="Democracia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isags-unasur.org/it_biblioteca.php?cat=1&amp;lg=1&amp;bb=166 |publisher=Unasul |title=Protocolo adicional Tratado Constitutivo UNASUL compromisso democracia |date=26 November 2010 |accessdate=6 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220005715/http://www.isags-unasur.org/it_biblioteca.php?cat=1&amp;lg=1&amp;bb=166 |archive-date=20 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event of such a situation, the Council of Heads of State and Government or the Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs may be convened extraordinarily by the Pro-Tempore Presidency of the Union, ex officio or at the request of the affected State or another member of UNASUR, to deliberate on the application of sanctions to the affected state. Among the political and diplomatic sanctions envisaged by the Protocol, the following stand out:&lt;ref name="Democracia"/&gt;
*Suspension of the right to participate in the different organs and instances of Unasur&lt;ref name="Democracia"/&gt;
*Partial or total closure of land borders with the affected State, including suspension or limitation of trade, air and sea transportation, communications, energy supply, services and supply.

==Free movement of people==
[[File:Passaporte brasileiro 2015 (cortado).jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Brazilian passport]] with the indication of [[Mercosur]].]]
Visits by South American citizens to any South American independent country of up to 90 days only require an identification document issued by the traveler's country. In November 2006, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, and Uruguay agreed to abolish visa requirements for tourists between any of those nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6182760.stm S American 12 cut travel red tape], BBC News (November 25, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercosur, along with its Associate members of Bolivia, Chile, Colombia and Ecuador established that their territories together form an "area of free residence with the right to work" to all its citizens, with no additional requirements other than nationality. The Free Movement and Residence Agreement was established in the [[Brasília]] summit based in a previous document signed on 6 December 2002.&lt;ref&gt;¿Puedo residir o trabajar libremente en otros Estados Partes del MERCOSUR? {{cite web|url=http://www.mercosur.int/t_generic.jsp?contentid%3D3963%26site%3D1%26channel%3Dsecretaria%26back%3Dyes |title=Archived copy |accessdate=17 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113102634/http://www.mercosur.int/t_generic.jsp?contentid=3963&amp;site=1&amp;channel=secretaria&amp;back=yes |archivedate=13 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizens of any Mercosur countries will have a simplified process in temporary residence visa of up to two years in any other member countries, with the requirements of a valid passport, [[birth certificate]], and no criminal record. Temporary residence can become permanent if a licit means of living can be verified.

At a summit in Guayaquil, Ecuador on 4 December 2014, UNASUR general secretary Ernesto Samper announced, "We have approved the concept of South American citizenship," including the creation of a single passport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/11057|title=UNASUR Moves toward Continental Freedom of Movement, Venezuela Makes “Equality” Call|date=5 December 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral monitors==
UNASUR has also initiated the creation of [[election monitoring|electoral monitor teams]] that could replace the monitors from the [[Organization of American States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/04/201241272337682401.html|title=Obama in Cartagena: No change, dwindling hope|first=Alex|last=Main|website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1958, when he began to publish monographs and articles during his first fieldwork in [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]], and later in the [[Alborz]] region of [[Iran]], to his monumental and highly acclaimed, ''Les Nations du Prophète'' (1993) and ''Minorités en Islam'' (1997), he has maintained his deep interest in [[Persian Empire|Persia]] and the Iranian civilization. He was also a contributor to [[Encyclopædia Iranica]], submitting articles ranging from "Abadan" to "Boundaries", "Cholera", "Darya?", "Earthquakes", "Famines", and a series of forthcoming articles on "Geography".  A bibliography of de Planhol’s wide-ranging publications up to 1995 has been compiled and published by Professor Daniel Balland in ''Geographie Historique et Culturelle de l’Europe: Hommage au Professor Xavier de Planhol'', by Jean-Robert Pitte (1995).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/aboutiranica/int_committee.html Encyclopaedia Iranica] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006080926/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/aboutiranica/int_committee.html |date=October 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
