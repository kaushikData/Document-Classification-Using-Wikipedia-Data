'''Agnieszka Osiecka''' (9 October 1936 – 7 March 1997) was a [[poet]], [[writer]], author of theatre and television screenplays, film director and journalist. She was a prominent Polish songwriter, having authored the lyrics to more than 2000 songs, and is considered an icon of Polish culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38504469|title=Women's studies encyclopedia|last=|first=|date=1999|publisher=Greenwood Press|others=Tierney, Helen.|year=|isbn=9780313310720|edition=Rev. and expanded|location=Westport, Conn.|pages=1107|oclc=38504469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Osiecka was born in [[Warsaw]], the only child of Wiktor Osiecki, a [[Serbia]]n-born pianist and composer, and a scholar Maria Sztechman of [[Serbs|Serbian]]-[[Vlachs|Vlach]] descent. She spent her early years in [[Zakopane]] where her father played the piano at the Watra Restaurant. After World War II the Osiecki family moved to Warsaw and settled in the Saska Kępa borough. The small flat soon became Osiecka’s favourite place to work. She lived there almost her entire life. After her death, the ''Okularnicy'' Foundation placed a commemorative plaque on the building.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://culture.pl/en/artist/agnieszka-osiecka|title=Agnieszka Osiecka {{!}} Artist {{!}} Culture.pl|work=Culture.pl|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnieszka was exceptionally gifted. She completed her coursework much more quickly than other students and graduated from Marie Curie-Skłodowska High School in 1952. She trained as a swimmer at Legia Sports Club and studied journalism at the [[University of Warsaw]] (1957–61) and film-directing at the prestigious [[National Film School in Łódź]] (1957–61) but dropped film-directing and started writing. Osiecka published essays and articles in the student press during her university years. She joined the famous [[Student Satirical Theatre]] (STS) in 1954 and wrote 166 political and lyrical songs for this company. She used to say "I am a journalist, that is why some of my songs are reports which rhyme." She served on the artistic board of the STS Theatre until it closed in 1972.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Agnieszka Osiecka monument Warsaw 01.jpg|thumb|Agnieszka Osiecka monument in Warsaw]]
1962 marked her debut on [[Polskie Radio|Polish National Radio]]. Renown Polish actress [[Kalina Jędrusik]] sang Osiecka's lyrics to a hit song by Franciszka Leszczyńska called "My First Ball" (''Mój pierwszy bal''). One year later at the first [[National Festival of Polish Song in Opole]] in 1963 Agnieszka achieved a major success winning the main prize and six other prizes for her lyrics: "Piosenka o Okularnikach“ (music by Jarosław Abram), as well as "Białe małżeństwo,“ "Czerwony kapturek,“ "Kochankowie z ulicy Kamiennej,“ "Solo na kontrabasie“ and "Ulice wielkich miast.“&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archiwumagnieszkiosieckiej.pl/dlibra/text?id=about-archive|title=dLibra Digital Library|last=Center|first=PSNC, Poznan Supercomputer and Networking|website=www.archiwumagnieszkiosieckiej.pl|language=en|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was now recognised as a prominent young poet and the Polish National Radio offered her a job to create and lead a team to broadcast ''The Radio Song Studio''. She also worked on theatre and television productions. Together with composer Adam Sławiński she wrote a series called "Listy śpiewające“ ("Singing Letters“). Her first major theatre show "Niech no tylko zakwitną jabłonie“ ("Let the Apple-trees Bloom") was staged at the [[Ateneum Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=1985|title=Theatre in Poland 1984|url=|journal=London Theatre Record|publisher=I. Herbert|volume=5|issue=1-13|pages=s.589|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her lyrics were set to music by such composers as [[Krzysztof Komeda]], [[Seweryn Krajewski]], [[Adam Sławiński]], [[Zygmunt Konieczny]], and others.

==Personal life==
Osiecka and her partner, the famous journalist [[Daniel Passent]], had their only child, a daughter, [[Agata Passent|Agata]], in 1973.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Masurian Lake District was among Osiecka's favorite places in Poland. She liked to vacation there in the 1960s/70s with Polish intellectuals and artists. As a student she worked there for one of the local newspapers and in the autumn of her life she wrote for the [[Atelier Theatre]] in [[Sopot]]. She was a frequent visitor to the Halama writers' retreat house in Zakopane, in the Tatra Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archiwumagnieszkiosieckiej.pl/dlibra/text?id=about-archive|title=dLibra Digital Library|last=Center|first=PSNC, Poznan Supercomputer and Networking|website=www.archiwumagnieszkiosieckiej.pl|language=en|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Agnieszka Osiecka published numerous books and released many records (see the full list at www.okularnicy.org.pl). She is considered one of the most important, prolific and gifted persons in postwar Polish culture and history. Osiecka died on 7 March 1997 after a battle of several years with  colon cancer. She is buried at the [[Powązki Cemetery]] in Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/13541404/agnieszka-osiecka|title=Agnieszka Osiecka (1936-1997) - Find A Grave...|website=www.findagrave.com|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Agnieszka Osiecka Okularnicy Foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archiwumagnieszkiosieckiej.pl Agnieszka Osiecka Okularnicy Foundation. Homepage.]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded by her daughter shortly after the poet's death. The Okularnicy Foundation promotes Osiecka’s work, runs the Poet's Archive, organizes the annual singing competition  "Let us Remember Agnieszka Osiecka“, manages the Internet archive and publishes books.&lt;ref&gt;Biblioteka Narodowa (2018), [http://www.archiwumagnieszkiosieckiej.pl/dlibra The Digital Archive of Agnieszka Osiecka.] National Library of Poland.&lt;/ref&gt;

To honour her creative output and her work at the National Polish Radio, the Music Studio was named after Osiecka in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.studianagran.com.pl/studia/m1/historia/lang,2 |title=The Agnieszka Osiecka Music Studio |author=Webmania.pl |website=StudiaNagran.com.pl |language=pl |access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19186">The '''anglicisation of [[personal names]]''' is the change of non-English-language personal names to spellings nearer English sounds, or substitution of equivalent or similar English personal names in the place of non-English personal names.

==Anglicisation of personal names==

===Classical, Medieval and Renaissance figures===
{{main|List of English translated personal names}}
A small number of figures, mainly very well-known classical and religious writers, appear under English names—or more typically under Latin names, in English texts. This practice became prevalent as early as in English-language translations of the [[New Testament]], where translators typically renamed figures such as Yeshu and Simon bar-Jonah as [[Jesus]] and [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and treated most of the other figures in the New Testament similarly. (In contrast, translations of the [[Old Testament]] traditionally use the original names, more or less faithfully transliterated from the original Hebrew.) Transatlantic explorers such as Zuan Caboto and Cristoforo Colombo became popularly known as [[John Cabot]] and [[Christopher Columbus]]; English-speakers anglicized and Latinized the name of the Polish astronomer Mikołaj Kopernik to (Nicholas) [[Copernicus]], and the English-speaking world typically knows the French-born theologian Jean Calvin as [[John Calvin]]. Such Anglicizations became less usual after the sixteenth century.

===Non-English-language areas of the British and Irish Isles===
{{main|Irish names}}
Most [[Gaelic language]] surnames of Ireland, Scotland, and the [[Isle of Man]] have been anglicised at some time. The Gaels were among the first Europeans to adopt surnames during the Dark Ages. Originally, most Gaelic surnames were composed of the given name of a child's father, preceded by Mac (''son'') or Nic (or ''Ní'', both being variants of ''nighean'', meaning ''daughter'') depending on the sex. These surnames would not be passed down another generation, and a woman would keep her birth surname after marriage. The same was originally true of Germanic surnames which followed the pattern [father's given name]+son/daughter (this is still the case in [[Iceland]], as exemplified by the singer [[Björk|Björk Guðmundsdóttir]] and former [[Prime Minister of Iceland|Prime Minister]] [[Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson]]).

Over the centuries, under the influence of post-Medieval English practice, this type of surname has become static over generations, handed down the male lineage to all successive generations so that it is no longer indicates the given name of a holder's father any more than the suffix -son on a Germanic language surname does today. Among English-speaking peoples of Gaelic heritage, the use of ''Nic'' as a prefix for daughters has been replaced by ''Mac'', regardless of sex (as per [[Geraldine McGowan]], [[Alyth McCormack]], and [[Sarah McLachlan]]). Wives also began to take on the surnames of their husbands.

Another common pattern of surname was similar to that preceded by Mac/Nic, but instead was preceded by Ó or Ui, signifying a grandchild or descendant. Not all Gaelic surnames signified relationship to a forebear, however. Some signified an ancestral people or homeland, such as ''MacDhubhghaill'' (son of a dark-haired foreigner; referring to one type of Scandinavian), ''MacFhionnghaill'' (son of a fair-haired foreigner; also referring to a Scandinavian people), MacLachlainn or MacLachlainneach (son of the Scandinavian). Others indicated the town or village of a family's origin, sometimes disguised as an ancestor's name as in [[Ó Creachmhaoil]], which prefixes a [[toponym]] as though it was the name of a person. As with other culturo-linguistic groups, other types of surnames were often used as well, including trade-names such as ''MacGhobhainn'', ''Mac a'Ghobhainn'' or ''Mac Gabhainn'' (''son of the smith''), and physical characteristics such as hair colour.

In Anglicising Gaelic names, the prefixes ''Mac'', ''Nic'', and ''Ó'' were frequently removed (the name ''MacPhearais'', by example, was sometimes anglicised as ''Pierce'' or ''Piers'', identically to the given name; ''Ó Leannáin'' and ''Ó Lionáin'' have both been anglicised as ''Lennon''; ''Ó Ceallaigh'' and ''Ó Cadhla'' have been anglicised as ''Kelly''). Where they were retained, ''Mac'' was often rendered ''Mc'', ''M', ''or ''Mag-'' (the last is seen in renderings such as ''Maguire'' for ''Mac Uidhir'') and ''Ó/Ui'' became ''O'''. ''MacGhobhainn'', ''Mac a'Ghobhainn'' and ''Mac Gabhainn'' (''son of the smith'') were anglicised as ''McGowan'', ''Gowan'', ''McGavin'', and ''Gavin''. In surnames which had been prefixed ''Mac'', the final hard ''c'' sound remained when the ''Mac'' was removed. As Gaelic spelling rules required the first letter of a name preceded by Mac or Nic to be lenited (unless it was an l, n, or r) with the addition of an h after (silencing it, or changing its sound), and for the last vowel to be slender (i or e) if male, the Anglicised form of a Gaelic name could look quite different. By example, ''MacPhearais'' (''Mac+Pearas''=''son of Pierce'') has been anglicised as ''Corish'', and ''MacInnis'' has been anglicised as ''Guinness''.

Gaelic names were also sometimes anglicised by translating the prefix ''Mac'' into the suffix ''son'', as per the Germanic practice. ''MacPhearais'', consequently, has been anglicised as ''Pearson'', and ''MacAoidh'' (Mac+Aodh) has been anglicised as ''Hewson'' (it is also anglicised as ''McHugh'' and ''Hughes''). The Gaelic ''MacSheain'' or ''MacSheathain'' (son of Seán) has similarly been anglicised ''Johnson'' (it has also been less thoroughly anglicised as ''MacIain'' and ''MacIan'').

The other main changes made in Anglicisation from Gaelic are the removal of silent letters, and respelling according to English phonetics (as ''Ó Creachmhaoil'' or ''Creachmhaoil'' became ''Crockwell'', and ''MacDhubhghaill'' became ''Dougal''). ( [[Ó Briain]] has often become O'Brien, [[Ó Rothláin]] became Rowland, [[O'Neill dynasty|Ó Néill]] became O'Neill and some surnames like Ó Súilleabháin may be shortened to just O'Sullivan or Sullivan. Similarly, native [[Scotland|Scottish]] names were altered such as Somhairle to Sorley, Mac Gill-Eain to MacLean, and Mac Aoidh to Mackay. Many [[Wales|Welsh]] names have also been altered, such as 'ap Hywell' to [[Powell (surname)|Powell]], or 'ap Siôn' to [[Jones (surname)|Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Wilgar Boal, J. Neville H. Douglas, Jenitha A. E. Orr  Integration and division: geographical perspectives on the ... Northern Ireland 1982 - Page 42 "Substantial assimilation in the form of the anglicisation of personal names, language, religion, or the adoption of new agricultural practices, house forms, and other aspects of British material culture could only be anticipated in the lowland"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration to English-speaking countries===
Anglicisation of non-English-language names was common for immigrants, or even visitors, to English speaking countries. An example is the German composer [[Johann Christian Bach]], the "London Bach," who was known as "John Bach" after emigrating to England.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Siblin ''The Cello Suites: J. S. Bach, Pablo Casals, and the Search for a ...'' 2011  - Page 234 "Known as the “London Bach,” he travelled to Italy, converted to Roman Catholicism, and enjoyed celebrity status in England, going by the name John Bach. Only fourteen years old when Bach died, Johann Christian apparently occupied a ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time in which there were large influxes of immigrants from [[Europe]] to the United States and United Kingdom during the 19th and 20th centuries, the given names and surnames of many immigrants were changed.

Traditionally common Christian given names could be substituted: such as James for the etymologically connected Jacques. Alternatively phonetical similarities, such as Joe for Giò (Giovanni or Giorgio); or abbreviation, Harry for Harilaos.

The anglicisation of a personal name now usually depends on the preferences of the bearer. Name changes are less common today for Europeans emigrating to the United States than they are for people originating in, or descending from those who emigrated from, [[East Asian]] countries.

====French surnames====
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}
[[French people|French]] immigrants to the United States (both those of [[Huguenot]] and [[French-Canadian]] background) often accommodated those unfamiliar with [[French language|French]] pronunciations and spellings by altering their surnames in either of two ways: spellings were changed to fit the traditional pronunciation (Pariseau became Parizo, Boucher became Bushey, Mailloux became Mayhew, Cartier became Carter, Carpentier became Carpenter), or pronunciations were changed to fit the spelling (Benoît, pronounced {{IPA-fr|bənwa}}, became {{IPAc-en|b|ɛ|n|ˈ|ɔɪ|t}}). In some cases, it could go either way (Gagné, pronounced {{IPA-fr|ɡaɲe}}, become {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|æ|ɡ|n|i}} or Gonyea), or something only slightly similar (Bourassa became Bersaw).

Some anglicized French-Canadian surnames:

Besides simple abbreviation or anglicization of spelling, there are some conventional English versions of or nicknames for Greek names which were formerly widely used and are still encountered:&lt;ref&gt;Mencken, all editions, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Greek Personal Names" , Central Intelligence Agency, 1 June 1962, revised and updated by Anastasia Parianou, 2007 http://www.fredonia.edu/faculty/emeritus/edwinlawson/greeknames/greek_10-22-09_final.pdf{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greekboston.com/name-days/ Greek Boston, "Greek Name Day Calendar"]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Slavic given names====
Having immigrated to Canada and United States in the late 19th &amp;ndash; early 20th centuries many [[Ukrainians]] looked for English equivalents to their given names. In some cases, Canadian or American-born children received two names: the English one (for official purposes) and a Ukrainian one (for family or ethnic community use only).

====German surnames====
Anglicization of family surnames occurred frequently among American born children of [[German Americans|German immigrants]].

====Dutch surnames====
When [[Dutch people|Dutch]] immigrants arrived in the United States, often their names got changed. This was either done on purpose, to make the name easier to write and remember, or by accident because the clerk didn't know how to spell the name and wrote it down phonetically.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dutchgenealogy.nl/english-versions-of-dutch-last-names/ "English versions of Dutch last names"], by Yvette Hoitink, ''dutchgenealogy.nl'', 15 may 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dutchancestrycoach.com/content/making-sense-your-dutch-surname "Making Sense Of Your Dutch Surname"], ''dutchancestrycoach.com'', 27 june 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Coastal Salish=====
[[Coastal Salish]] people were often given "Boston Names" by early European settlers.  These English names often had similar sounds to original [[Lushootseed]] names. &lt;ref name="HistoryLink-Comeford"&gt;{{cite web |last=Dougherty |first=Phil |date=October 5, 2007 |title=Comeford, James Purcell (1833–1909) |url=http://www.historylink.org/File/8309 |work=HistoryLink |accessdate=January 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Comeford |first=T.

When [[Lushootseed]] names were integrated into English, they were often recorded and pronounced very differently.  An example of this is [[Chief Seattle]]. The name Seattle is an Anglicisation of the modern Duwamish conventional spelling '''Si'ahl''', equivalent to the modern [[Lushootseed language|Lushootseed]] spelling ''siʔaɫ'' {{IPA-sal|ˈsiʔaːɬ|IPA:}}. He is also known as '''Sealth''', '''Seathle''', '''Seathl''', or '''See-ahth'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.historylink.org/File/5071|title=Chief Seattle (Seattle, Chief Noah [born si?al, 178?-1866])|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burr Harrison Duval''' (1809 – March 27, 1836) was the commander of the [[Kentucky Mustangs]], First Regiment Volunteers, a group of Kentucky long-riflemen formed in [[Bardstown, Kentucky]], in November 1835 during the [[Texas Revolution]]. He and hundreds of others surrendered to the Mexican army at [[Goliad, Texas]], only to be executed in the [[Goliad Massacre]].

==Early life and family==
Burr H. Duval was the son of [[William Pope Duval]] and Nancy Hynes. He was born in 1809 in [[Bardstown, Kentucky|Bardstown]]. William Pope Duval was the first and longest-serving (twelve years) [[Territory of Florida|Territorial]] [[Governor of Florida]]. Burr Duval's brother, [[John Crittenden Duval]] (1816–1897), who later became a writer, was captured with him at Goliad; however, his life was spared. Another brother, [[Thomas Howard DuVal]] (1813-1880), had a distinguished judicial career in Texas.

He attended [[St. Joseph's College (Kentucky)|St. Joseph's College]] in Bardstown.

==Texas Revolution==
After forming the Kentucky Mustangs, the group traveled to Texas to fight for independence from [[Mexico]]. They arrived at [[Quintana, Texas]], in December 1835. Duval and his company were put under the command of Colonel [[James Walker Fannin]], with Duval given the rank of captain.

The Mustangs, along with the five other companies under Fannin's command, were in [[Goliad, Texas]], on March 14, 1836, when they received orders from Commander-in-Chief of the Texas Army [[Sam Houston]] to retreat to [[Victoria, Texas]]. Fannin delayed the retreat from [[Presidio La Bahia]] in Goliad, waiting for reinforcements.

Once it was learned that the reinforcements had been defeated on their way to Goliad, Colonel Fannin ordered the retreat. Captain Duval and his men began to retreat with the regiment, however, by the time the order came, the Mexican army under the command of José de Urrea had completely surrounded the town of Goliad. Duval and all of the men under Fannin's command were forced to surrender to the Mexican army on March 19, 1836.

A week following the surrender, [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] ordered the execution of most of the captured men. Colonel Fannin, Burr Duval and almost 400 other men were executed on March 27 in what became known as the [[Goliad Massacre]].

==Honors==
[[Duval County, Texas]], is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA111#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

[[File:Nino2009.jpg|thumb|The [[Santo Niño de Cebu]], enshrined in the [[Philippines]]. ]]
The '''Christ Child''', also known as '''Divine Infant''', '''Baby Jesus''', '''Infant Jesus''', '''Child Jesus''',  the '''Holy Child''', and '''Santo Niño''', refers to [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] from his [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity]] to age 12. 

The four [[Canonical Gospel]]s accepted by most Christians today lack any narration of the years between Jesus' infancy and the [[Finding in the Temple]] when he was 12.

==Liturgical feast days==
[[Liturgical feast]]s relating to Christ's infancy and the Christ Child include:
* [[Christmas|The Feast of the Nativity of Jesus Christ]] (25 December);
* The [[Feast of the Circumcision of Christ#Eastern Orthodox Church]] (1 January - [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]);
* The [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of the Epiphany]] (6 January)
* The [[Christmas in the Philippines#Feast of the Santo Niño|Feast of the Santo Niño]] (Third Sunday in January - [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Philippines]])
* The [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Feast of the Presentation in the Temple]] (2 February)

==Depictions in art==
[[File:Anthony pereda.jpg|thumb|left|[[Saint Anthony of Padua]] adoring the Christ Child. Oil on canvas, 1622 by [[Antonio de Pereda]].]]
From about the third or fourth century onwards, the child Jesus is frequently shown in paintings, and sculpture. Commonly these are [[Nativity of Jesus in art|nativity]] scenes showing the birth of Jesus, with his mother [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], and her husband [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]].

Depictions as a baby with the Virgin Mary, known as ''[[Madonna and Child]]'', are [[iconography|iconographical]] types in [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] and [[Western Christianity|Western]] traditions. Other scenes from his time as a baby, of his [[Circumcision of Jesus|circumcision]], presentation at the temple, the [[adoration of the Magi]], and the [[flight into Egypt]], are common.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, George. ''Signs &amp; symbols in Christian art'', 1966, Oxford University Press US, p.76&lt;/ref&gt;  Scenes showing his developing years are more rare but not unknown.
[[File:Sant'Apollinare Nuovo, mosaico della Madre di Dio in trono con il Bambino, circondata da quattro angeli. - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Sant'Apollinare Nuovo, mosaico della Madre di Dio in trono con il Bambino, circondata da quattro angeli. - panoramio]]

Saint Joseph, [[Anthony of Padua]], and [[Saint Christopher]] are often depicted holding the Christ Child. The [[Christian mystic]]s [[Saint Teresa of Avila]], [[Saint Therese of Lisieux]], along with the devotees of [[Divino Niño]] such as [[Mother Angelica]] and Father Giovanni Rizzo claim to have had apparitions of [[Jesus]] as a toddler.

===During the Middle Ages===
The Christ Child was a popular subject in European wood sculpture beginning in the 1300s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/102095/unknown-maker-italian-christ-child-italian-about-1700/ "Christ Child", The J.Paul Getty Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of the Christ child was well known in Spain under the title ''Montanesino'' after the [[Santo (art)|santero]] sculptor [[Juan Martínez Montañés]] who began the trend. These icons of the Christ Child was often posed in the ''[[contrapposto]]'' style in which the positioning of the knees reflected in the opposite direction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://media.ehs.uen.org/html/ArtHistoryQ1/Greek_Sculpture_01/CONTRAPPOSTO_1.htm|title =Contrapposto|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://archive.is/20150416150009/http://media.ehs.uen.org/html/ArtHistoryQ1/Greek_Sculpture_01/CONTRAPPOSTO_1.htm|archivedate =2015-04-16|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to ancient depictions of the [[Roman Emperor]].

The growth of images being made were quite popular among nobility, while some images were also used to colonize kingdoms such of Spain and Portugal. Colonial images of the Christ child also began to wear [[vestments]], a pious practice developed by the santero culture in later colonial years, carrying the depiction of holding the ''[[globus cruciger]]'', a bird symbolizing a [[soul]] or the [[Holy Spirit]] or various paraphernalia related to its locality or region.

The symbolism of the Child Jesus in art reached its apex during the [[Renaissance]]: the [[Holy Family]] was a central theme in the works of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and many other masters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269769/Holy-Family "Holy Family", Encyclopædia Britannica Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Tàladh Chrìosda''==
''[[Taladh Chriosda|Tàladh Chrìosda]]'' (Christ Child Lullaby) is a Scottish carol from Moidart, Scotland. The [[Catholic priest]] Father Ranald Rankin, wrote the lyrics for Midnight Mass around the year 1855.  He originally wrote 29 verses in [[Scottish Gaelic]], but the popular English translation is limited to five. The melody, ''Cumha Mhic Arois'' (lament for Mac Àrois), is from the Hebrides and was a sung as a protective charm for the fisherman away at sea. The rhythm mirrors the rhythm of the surf. It is sung in the [[Hebrides]] at Midnight Mass of Christmas Eve.

==In the apocryphal texts==
In some [[Biblical apocrypha|apocryphal]] texts, the [[Infancy Gospels]] grew up with legendary accounts of the intervening period, and these are sometimes depicted. These stories were intended to show Jesus as having extraordinary gifts of power and knowledge, even from the youngest age. One common pious tale has the young Jesus animating sparrows out of clay belonging to his playmates. When admonished for doing so on the Sabbath, he causes the birds to fly away.&lt;ref name=roten&gt;[http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/Jesus%20as%20a%20Child.pdf Roten, J. and Janssen, T., "Jesus as a Child"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==As pious image of veneration==
Several historically significant images of Jesus Christ as a child have received [[Canonical Coronation]]s from the [[Pope]], namely the [[Infant Jesus of Prague]], the [[Santo Niño de Cebú]] in [[the Philippines]], and the [[Santo Bambino of Aracoeli]] in [[Rome]].

In the seventeenth century veneration of the Christ Child under the title the "Little King of Beaune" was promoted by French Carmelites.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HQmCKFvm9KoC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=Little+King+of+Beaune&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OCYD9uOIQn&amp;sig=K8uO6jiMuc_nDhkamQ6SqO9cPKI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9iu3cja3KAhVMGT4KHc4xCQ4Q6AEIQjAL#v=onepage&amp;q=Little%20King%20of%20Beaune&amp;f=false Descouvemont, Pierre., ''Therese and Lisieux'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1996] {{ISBN|9780802838360}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late nineteenth century devotion to the Holy Child of Remedy developed in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anadesanbartolome.org/agenda_remedios.html "Brief History of the Holy Child of Remedy", Friends of Anne of St. Bartolomew]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hazara people}}
'''Dawood Sarkhosh''' (also spelled as '''Daud Sarkhosh''' ([[Dari-Persian]]: {{nq|داوود سرخوش}}) born on 1971 in [[Daykundi]], [[Afghanistan]]) is a [[Poetry|poet]], [[singer]], and [[musician]]. He belongs to the [[Hazara people]] which is the third largest ethnic group in Afghanistan.

== Early life ==
Sarkhosh's inspiration was his older brother [[Sarwar Sarkhosh]], a nationalist and legendary musician of his times who was killed during the civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sarwarsarkhosh.com/%D8%B2%D9%86%D8%AF%DA%AF%DB%8C%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%87-%D8%B2%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%87-%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%B4%D9%87%DB%8C%D8%AF-%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%AE%D9%88%D8%B4/|title=زندگینامه زنده یاد شهید سرور سرخوش – شهید سرور سرخوش|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sarwarsarkhosh.com|language=fa-IR|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarkhosh learned playing [[dambura]] and singing from him at the age of seventeen. After the death of his brother Sarkhosh migrated to [[Pakistan]] first to [[Peshawar|Peshawar city]] then moved to [[Quetta]].&lt;ref name="OfficialSite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawoodsarkhosh.com/index.php?underside=bio.html|title=Biography of Dawood Sarkhosh|publisher=Sarkhosh's Official Site|pages=|accessdate=April 30, 2012|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Sarkhosh revived his skills by singing and composing songs inspired by a sense of [[nationalism]] and suffering in exile. He didn't sing for commercial gain, but out of nostalgia and to convey the feelings about [[refugee]] life as experienced by refugees of Afghanistan dispersed throughout the world. They went to his concerts in their thousands, marking Sarkhosh's rise as a singer.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} It was in Quetta that he mastered the [[Pump organ|harmonium]] under the [[Pakistani]] composer [[Arbab Ali Khan]].&lt;ref name="OfficialSite"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Dawood Sarkhosh is married to Kubra Nekzad Sarkhosh with three kids named; Saboor, Zulfiqar and Yasir. They live and work in [[Austria]] now.&lt;ref name="OfficialSite"/&gt;

{{Main|Douglas MacArthur}}
[[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] '''[[Douglas MacArthur]]''' (January 26, 1880 – April 5, 1964) was an [[Americans|American]] general and [[Field Marshal (Philippines)|field marshal]] of the [[Philippine Army]]. He was a [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]] during the 1930s and played a prominent role in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]] during World War II. He received the [[Medal of Honor]] for his service in the [[Philippines Campaign (1941–1942)|Philippines Campaign]].

MacArthur was recalled to active duty in 1941 as commander of [[U.S. Army Forces in the Far East]]. A series of disasters followed, starting with the destruction of his air force on December 8, 1941, and the invasion of the Philippines by the Japanese. MacArthur's forces were soon compelled to withdraw to [[Bataan]], where they held out until May 1942. In March 1942, MacArthur, his family and his staff left [[Corregidor]] in [[PT boat]]s, and [[Douglas MacArthur's escape from the Philippines|escaped to Australia]], where MacArthur became Supreme Commander, [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific Area]]. For his defense of the Philippines, MacArthur was awarded the Medal of Honor. After more than two years of fighting in the Pacific, he fulfilled a promise to return to the Philippines. He officially accepted Japan's surrender on September 2, 1945.

==Philippines Campaign (1941–42)==

On July 26, 1941 Roosevelt federalized the Philippine Army, recalled MacArthur to active duty in the U.S. Army as a two star/major general, and named him commander of [[U.S. Army Forces in the Far East]] (USAFFE). MacArthur was promoted to lieutenant general the following day,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morton|1953|p=19.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then to general on December 20. At the same time, Sutherland was promoted to major general, while Marshall, [[Spencer B. Akin]], and [[Hugh John Casey]] were all promoted to brigadier general.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rogers|1990|p=100.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 31, 1941 the [[Philippine Department]] had 22,000 troops assigned, 12,000 of whom were [[Philippine Scouts]]. The main component was the [[Philippine Division]], under the command of Major General [[Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright IV|Jonathan M. Wainwright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morton|1953|p=21.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between July and December 1941 the garrison received 8,500 reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morton|1953|p=50.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After years of parsimony, much equipment was shipped. By November, a backlog of 1,100,000 shipping tons of equipment intended for the Philippines had accumulated in U.S. ports and depots awaiting vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morton|1953|pp=35–37.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 0330 local time on December 8, 1941, Sutherland learned of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and informed MacArthur. At 0530, [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]] General [[George Marshall]] ordered MacArthur to execute the existing war plan, [[United States color-coded war plans#Rainbow plans|Rainbow Five]]. MacArthur did nothing. When, on three occasions, [[Lewis H. Brereton|Gen. Breteron]] requested permission to attack Japanese bases in [[Formosa]] (now called [[Taiwan]]), in accordance with prewar intentions, he was refused. At 12:30, the Japanese pilots of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service|11th Air Fleet]] achieved complete tactical surprise when they [[attack on Clark Field|attacked Clark Field]] and the nearby fighter base at [[Iba Airfield|Iba Field]]. They destroyed or disabled 18 of [[Far East Air Force (United States)|Far East Air Force]]'s 35 [[B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]]s, 53 of its 107 [[Curtiss P-40|P-40]]s, three [[Seversky P-35|P-35]]s, and more than 25 other aircraft. Substantial damage was done to the bases, and casualties totaled 80 killed and 150 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morton|1953|pp=84–88.}}&lt;/ref&gt; What was left of the Far East Air Force was all but destroyed over the next few days.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morton|1953|p=97.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MacArthur and Sutherland s265357.jpg|thumb|right|300px|MacArthur (center) with his Chief of Staff, Major General [[Richard K. Sutherland]], in the [[Malinta Tunnel|Headquarters tunnel]] on [[Corregidor]], Philippines, March 1, 1942.|alt=Two men sitting at a desk.]]
Prewar defense plans assumed the Japanese could not be prevented from landing on [[Luzon]] and called for U.S. and Filipino forces to abandon Manila and retreat with their supplies to the [[Bataan|Bataan peninsula]]. MacArthur attempted to slow the Japanese advance with an initial defense against the Japanese landings. However, he reconsidered his confidence in the ability of his Filipino troops when the Japanese landing force made a rapid advance after landing at [[Lingayen Gulf]] on December 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morton|1953|p=125.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently ordered a [[Battle of Bataan|retreat to Bataan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morton|1953|p=163.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manila was declared an [[open city]] and on December 25 MacArthur moved his headquarters to the island fortress of [[Corregidor]] in [[Manila Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rogers|1990|pp=118–121.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of air raids by the Japanese destroyed all the exposed structures on the island and USAFFE headquarters was moved into the [[Malinta Tunnel]]. Later most of the headquarters moved to Bataan, leaving only the nucleus with MacArthur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogers|1990|pp=125–141.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The troops on Bataan knew that they had been written off but continued to fight. Some blamed Roosevelt and MacArthur for their predicament. A ballad sung to the tune of "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]" called him "Dugout Doug."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=65–66.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most clung to the belief that somehow MacArthur "would reach down and pull something out of his hat."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|p=68.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 1, 1942 MacArthur was offered and accepted a payment of $500,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1/2|1941|r=1}}}} million in current value) from [[President Quezon]] of the Philippines as payment for his pre-war service. MacArthur's staff members also received payments: $75,000 for Sutherland, $45,000 for Richard Marshall, and $20,000 for Huff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogers|1990|p=165.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Petillo&gt;{{harvnb|Petillo|1979|pp=107–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenhower, after being appointed [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force]], was also offered money by Quezon, but declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Halberstam|2007|p=372.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These payments were known only to a few in Manila and Washington, including President Roosevelt and Secretary of War [[Henry L. Stimson]], until they were made public by historian Carol Petillo in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Warren | first1=Jim | last2=Ridder | first2=Knight | title=MacArthur Given $500,000 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/01/29/macarthur-given-500000/3ad863a3-8caa-4792-b038-d91bb3f804b4/ | date=29 January 1980 | newspaper=''[[The Washington Post]]'' | accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SecretPayment"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Secret Payment (January - February 1942) &amp;#124; American Experience | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/macarthur/peopleevents/pandeAMEX103.html | publisher=[[PBS]] | accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the payments had been fully legal,&lt;ref name="SecretPayment"/&gt; the revelation tarnished MacArthur's reputation.&lt;ref name="SecretPayment"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=860&amp;dat=19800130&amp;id=SjAQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lo8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6803,1835463 |newspaper=[[Ellensburg Daily Record]] |title=But writer says she has proof – Claims MacArthur took half million denied|date=January 30, 1980 |accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Escape to Australia and Medal of Honor citation===
In February 1942, as Japanese forces tightened their grip on the Philippines, MacArthur was ordered by President Roosevelt to relocate to Australia. MacArthur discussed the idea with his staff that he resign his commission and fight on as a private soldier in the Philippine resistance but Sutherland talked him out of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|p=98.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of March 12, 1942, MacArthur and a select group (that included his wife Jean and son Arthur, as well as Sutherland, Akin, Casey, Marshall, [[Charles A. Willoughby|Willoughby]], [[LeGrande A. Diller|Diller]], and [[Harold H. George|George]]) left Corregidor in four PT boats. MacArthur, his family and Sutherland traveled in&lt;!--this is the correct usage, don't change it--&gt; ''[[PT 41]]'', commanded by Lieutenant [[John D. Bulkeley]]. The others followed in ''[[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-34|PT 34]]'', ''[[PT 35]]'' and ''[[PT 32]]''. MacArthur and his party reached [[Del Monte Airfield]] in Bukidnon province on the island of [[Mindanao]] two days later. General George Marshall sent three U.S. Navy B-17s to pick them up. Two of them arrived, and brought the entire group to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morton|1953|pp=359–360.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rogers|1990|pp=190–192.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacArthur arrived on March 17 at [[Batchelor Airfield]], about {{convert|60|mi|km}} south of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], before flying to [[Alice Springs]], where he took [[the Ghan]] through the Australian outback to [[Adelaide, South Australia|Adelaide]]. His famous speech, in which he said, "I came out of Bataan and I shall return", was first made at [[Terowie]], a small railway township in South Australia on March 20. Upon his arrival in Adelaide, MacArthur abbreviated this to the now-famous, "I came through and I shall return" that made headlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=105–106.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington asked MacArthur to amend his promise to, "We shall return". He ignored the request.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,974392-6,00.html

For his leadership in the defense of the Philippines, General Marshall decided to award MacArthur the Medal of Honor, the decoration for which he had twice previously been nominated. It was admitted that MacArthur had not actually performed acts of valor in battle on Bataan but the 1927 award to [[Charles Lindbergh]] set a precedent. MacArthur chose to accept the medal on the basis that "this award was intended not so much for me personally as it is a recognition of the indomitable courage of the gallant army which it was my honor to command."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|p=132.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur MacArthur, Jr. and Douglas MacArthur thus became the first father and son to be awarded the Medal of Honor. They remained the only pair until 2001 when [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was awarded posthumously for his service during the [[Spanish–American War]], [[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.]] having received one posthumously for his service during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |accessdate=May 7, 2010 |url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/amacart.htm |title=Arthur MacArthur, Jr. |publisher=Arlington National Cemetery Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0101/16/se.04.html |title=President Clinton Awards Medals of Honor to Corporal Andrew Jackson Smith and President Teddy Roosevelt|date=January 16, 2001|publisher=CNN.com|accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Papuan Campaign===
Anticipating that the Japanese would strike at [[Port Moresby]] again, the garrison was strengthened and MacArthur ordered the establishment of new bases at [[Merauke]] and [[Milne Bay]] to cover its flanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milner|1957|pp=39–41.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Battle of Midway]] in June 1942 led to plans to exploit this victory with a limited offensive in the Pacific. MacArthur's proposal for an attack on the main Japanese base at Rabaul met with objections from the U.S. Navy, which favored a less ambitious approach and objected to an Army general being in command of what would be an [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious operation]]. The resulting compromise called for a three-stage advance, with the first, the [[Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu–Tanambogo|seizure of the Tulagi area]], being conducted by the [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Pacific Ocean Areas command]], under Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]]. The later stages would be conducted under MacArthur's command as [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|Supreme Allied Commander, South West Pacific Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Milner|1957|pp=46–48.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Cartwheel===
[[File:Elkton Plan.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Elkton III Plan, March 1943|alt=Topographic map of Papua New Guinea with arrows indicating an Allied advance along the northern coast towards the Admiralty Islands.]]
At the Pacific Military Conference in March 1943, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] approved General MacArthur's plan for Operation Cartwheel, an advance on Rabaul. Owing to a shortage of resources, particularly [[heavy bomber]] aircraft, the final stage of the plan, the capture of Rabaul itself, was postponed until 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|1982|pp=312–334.}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacArthur explained his strategy:
{{quote|My strategic conception for the Pacific Theater, which I outlined after the Papuan Campaign and have since consistently advocated, contemplates massive strokes against only main strategic objectives, utilizing surprise and air-ground striking power supported and assisted by the fleet. This is the very opposite of what is termed "island hopping" which is the gradual pushing back of the enemy by direct frontal pressure with the consequent heavy casualties which will certainly be involved. Key points must of course be taken but a wise choice of such will obviate the need for storming the mass of islands now in enemy possession. "Island hopping" with extravagant losses and slow progress...is not my idea of how to end the war as soon and as cheaply as possible. New conditions require for solution and new weapons require for maximum application new and imaginative methods. Wars are never won in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willoughby|1966|p=100.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lieutenant General [[Walter Krueger]]'s [[Sixth United States Army|Sixth Army]] headquarters arrived in SWPA in early 1943 but MacArthur had only three American divisions, and they were tired and depleted from the fighting at Buna and [[Guadalcanal]]. As a result, "it became obvious that any military offensive in the South-West Pacific in 1943 would have to be carried out mainly by the Australian Army."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dexter|1961|p=12.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[New Guinea]], a country without roads, large-scale transportation of men and material would have to be accomplished by aircraft or ships. A multi-pronged approach was employed to solve this problem. Disassembled [[landing craft]] were shipped to Australia, where they were assembled in Cairns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Casey|1959|pp=31–33.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of these small landing craft was to be greatly extended by the [[Amphibious warfare ship|landing ships]] of Rear Admiral [[Daniel E. Barbey]]'s [[VII Amphibious Force]], which began arriving in late 1942.&lt;ref name="Morison, pp. 130-132"/&gt; Barbey's force formed part of Carpender's newly formed Seventh Fleet.&lt;ref name="Morison 1950 30–32"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morison, pp. 130-132"&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1950|pp=130–132.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carpender reported to MacArthur as Supreme Allied Commander, SWPA, but to Admiral [[Ernest King]] as Commander Seventh Fleet, which was part of King's [[United States Fleet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leary|1988|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Seventh Fleet had no aircraft carriers, the range of naval operations SWPA was limited by that of the fighter aircraft of the [[Fifth Air Force]]. Although a few long-range [[P-38 Lightning]] fighters had arrived in SWPA in late 1942, further deliveries were suspended owing to the demands of [[Operation Torch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|p=220.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:C-47 transport planes loaded for Nadzab.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Generals Kenney and MacArthur watch [[C-47]] transport planes loaded with paratroops for the drop at Nadzab.|alt=A steel plank runway with identical aircraft lined up along its length at right. Two small figures stand off to the left of the runway.]]
The main offensive began with the [[landing at Lae]] by Major General [[George Wootten]]'s [[9th Division (Australia)|Australian 9th Division]] and the [[Engineer Special Brigade (United States)#2nd Engineer Special Brigade|2nd Engineer Special Brigade]] on September 4, 1943. The next day MacArthur watched the [[landing at Nadzab]] by [[Airborne forces|paratroops]] of the [[503rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|503rd Parachute Infantry]] from a B-17 circling overhead. The B-17 made the trip on three engines because one failed soon after leaving Port Moresby, but MacArthur insisted that it fly on to Nadzab.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|p=327.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this, MacArthur was awarded the [[Air Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=179.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vasey's [[7th Division (Australia)|Australian 7th Division]] and Wooten's 9th Division converged on Lae, which fell on September 16. MacArthur advanced his timetable, and ordered the 7th Division to capture [[Battle of Kaiapit|Kaiapit]] and [[Finisterre Range campaign|Dumpu]], while the 9th Division mounted an [[Huon Peninsula campaign|amphibious assault on Finschhafen]]. Here, the offensive bogged down. Part of the problem was that MacArthur had based his decision to assault Finschhafen on Willoughby's assessment that there were only 350 Japanese defenders at Finschhafen when there were actually nearly 5,000. A furious battle ensued.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=328–329.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Landings to Western New Guinea.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Westward Drive along New Guinea, February–July 1944|alt=Topographic map of the island of New Guinea and the surrounding islands with arrows indicating an Allied advance along the northern coast.]]
In early November, MacArthur's plan for a westward advance along the coast of New Guinea to the Philippines was incorporated into plans for the war against Japan approved at the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=364–365.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hayes|1982|pp=487–490.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, airmen reported no signs of enemy activity in the [[Admiralty Islands]]. Although his intelligence staff did not agree that the islands had been evacuated, MacArthur ordered an amphibious landing on [[Los Negros Island]], marking the beginning of the [[Admiralty Islands campaign]]. MacArthur accompanied the assault force aboard {{USS|Phoenix|CL-46|6}}, the flagship of Vice Admiral [[Thomas C. Kinkaid]], who had recently replaced Carpender as commander of the Seventh Fleet. MacArthur, who came ashore with Kinkaid only seven hours after the first wave of landing craft, was awarded the [[Bronze Star]] for his actions in this campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=189.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After six weeks of fierce fighting, the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] captured the islands; the campaign officially ended on 18 May 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willoughby|1966|pp=137–141.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacArthur now bypassed the Japanese forces at [[Hansa Bay]] and [[Wewak]], and assaulted [[Landing at Hollandia|Hollandia]] and [[Landing at Aitape|Aitape]], which Willoughby reported to be lightly defended. Although they were out of range of the Fifth Air Force's fighters based in the Ramu Valley, the timing of the operation allowed the aircraft carriers of the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] to provide air support.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willoughby|1966|pp=142–143.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though risky, the operation turned out to be a brilliant success. MacArthur caught the Japanese off balance and cut off Lieutenant General [[Hatazō Adachi]]'s [[Eighteenth Army (Japan)|Japanese XVIII Army]] in the Wewak area. Because the Japanese were not expecting an attack, the garrison was weak, and Allied casualties were correspondingly light. However, the terrain turned out to be less suitable for airbase development than first thought, forcing MacArthur to seek better locations further west. Moreover, while bypassing Japanese forces had great tactical merit, it had the serious strategic drawback of tying up large numbers of Allied troops in order to contain them, and Adachi was far from beaten. In the [[Battle of Driniumor River]], he would bring on "the New Guinea campaign's bloodiest and most strategically useless battle."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taafe|1998|pp=100–103.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1944, President Roosevelt summoned MacArthur to meet with him in Hawaii "to determine the phase of action against Japan." Nimitz and MacArthur agreed that the next step should be to advance on the southern and central Philippines. MacArthur emphasized the moral and political issues involved in a decision to liberate or bypass Luzon. He also spoke briefly of his plan to use the Australian Army to liberate Indonesia. Although the issue was not settled, both Roosevelt and Leahy were convinced of the soundness of MacArthur's plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=526–533.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, Halsey's carriers made a series of air strikes on the Philippines. Opposition was feeble and Halsey concluded that Leyte was "wide open" and possibly undefended, and recommended that projected operations be skipped in favor of an assault on Leyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Drea|1992|pp=152–159.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Douglas MacArthur lands Leyte1.jpg|thumb|left|300px|"I have returned" — General MacArthur returns to the Philippines.|alt=Seven men in uniform wade through the surf.]]
On October 20, 1944, troops of Krueger's Sixth Army [[Battle of Leyte|landed on Leyte]], while MacArthur watched from {{USS|Nashville|CL-43|6}}. That afternoon he arrived off the beach. The advance had not progressed far; snipers were still active and the area was under sporadic mortar fire. When his whaleboat grounded in knee-deep water, MacArthur requested a landing craft, but the beachmaster was too busy to grant his request. MacArthur was compelled to wade ashore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

Since Leyte was out of range of Kenney's land-based aircraft, MacArthur was entirely dependent on carrier aircraft for cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=228.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese air activity soon increased, with raids on [[Tacloban]], where MacArthur decided to establish his headquarters, and on the fleet offshore. MacArthur enjoyed staying on ''Nashville''{{'}}s bridge during air raids, although several bombs landed close by, and two nearby cruisers were hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=561–562.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next few days, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] staged a major counterattack in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]]. MacArthur attributed the near-disaster to command being divided between himself and Nimitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|pp=222–231.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor did the campaign ashore proceed smoothly. The timing of the assault so late in the year forced the combat troops, pilots, and the supporting logistical units to contend with heavy monsoonal rains that disrupted the airbase construction program. Adverse weather and valiant Japanese resistance slowed the American advance ashore. MacArthur was forced to ask Nimitz to recall the carriers to support the Sixth Army but they proved to be no substitute for land-based aircraft, and the lack of air cover permitted the Japanese Army to pour troops into Leyte.&lt;ref name="MacArthur, p. 231"&gt;{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|pp=231–234.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=568–569.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of December, Krueger's headquarters estimated that 5,000 Japanese remained on Leyte, and on December 26 MacArthur issued a communiqué announcing that "the campaign can now be regarded as closed except for minor mopping up." Yet Eichelberger's [[Eighth United States Army|Eighth Army]] would kill more than 27,000 Japanese on Leyte between then and the end of the campaign in May 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=602–603.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 18, 1944, MacArthur was promoted to the new [[five-star rank]] of [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] — one day before Nimitz was promoted to [[Fleet Admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]], also a five-star rank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.army.mil/faq/faq-5star.htm Five-Star Generals and Dates of Rank].

MacArthur's next move was the [[Battle of Mindoro|invasion of Mindoro]], where there were good potential airfield sites around the [[San Jose, Occidental Mindoro|San Jose]] area. Willoughby estimated, correctly as it turned out, that the island had only about 1,000 Japanese defenders. The problem this time was getting there. A parachute drop was considered, but the airfields on Leyte lacked the space to hold the required transport aircraft. Kinkaid balked at sending escort carriers into the restricted waters of the [[Sulu Sea]], and Kenney could not guarantee land based air cover. The operation was clearly hazardous, and MacArthur's staff talked him out of accompanying the invasion on the ''Nashville''. As the invasion force entered the Sulu Sea, a [[kamikaze]] struck ''Nashville'', killing 133 people and wounding 190 more, including the task force commander, Brigadier General [[William C. Dunkel]]. The landings were made unopposed on December 15, 1944, and within two weeks Australian and American engineers had three airstrips in operation, but "not since [[Operation Shingle|Anzio]] had the navy experienced so much difficulty supporting an amphibious operation after the initial landing." The resupply convoys were repeatedly attacked by kamikaze aircraft and on December 26–27 a Japanese naval force attacked the area, sinking a destroyer and damaging other ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=604–609.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The way was now clear for the [[Battle of Luzon|invasion of Luzon]]. This time, based on different interpretations of the same intelligence data, Willoughby's G-2 Section at GHQ estimated the strength of General [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]]'s forces on Luzon at 137,000, while that of Sixth Army estimated it at 234,000. The Sixth Army Brigadier General [[Clyde D. Eddleman]] attempted to lay out the reasons for the Sixth Army's assessment, but MacArthur's response was "Bunk!". He felt that even Willoughby's estimate was too high. "Audacity, calculated risk, and a clear strategic aim were MacArthur's attributes," and he was prepared to disregard the intelligence estimates. However, all the estimates were too low: Yamashita had more than 287,000 troops on Luzon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Drea|1992|pp=180–187.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This time MacArthur traveled on the {{USS|Boise|CL-47|6}}, watching as the ship was near-missed by a bomb and torpedoes fired by [[midget submarine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=619–620.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GHQ communiqué read: "The decisive battle for the liberation of the Philippines and the control of the Southwest pacific is at hand. General MacArthur is in personal command at the front and landed with his assault troops."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|p=622.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacArthur's primary concern was the capture of the port of Manila and the airbase at [[Clark Air Base|Clark Field]], which were required to support future operations. He urged his front line commanders on.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|p=629.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 25, 1945 he moved his advanced headquarters forward to [[Hacienda Luisita]], closer to the front than Krueger's at [[Calasiao, Pangasinan|Calasiao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|p=623.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 30, MacArthur ordered the 1st Cavalry Division's commander, Major General [[Verne D. Mudge]], to conduct a rapid advance on Manila. On February 3, it reached the northern outskirts of Manila and the campus of the [[University of Santo Tomas]] where 3,700 internees were liberated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=632–633.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unknown to the Americans, Rear Admiral [[Sanji Iwabuchi]] had decided to defend Manila to the death. The [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]] raged for the next three weeks.&lt;ref name="Drea, pp. 195-200"&gt;{{harvnb|Drea|1992|pp=195–200.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to spare the civilian population, MacArthur prohibited the use of air strikes, but thousands of civilians died in the crossfire or Japanese massacres.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=642–644.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also refused to restrict the traffic of civilians who clogged the roads in and out of Manila, placing humanitarian concerns above military ones except for emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|p=654.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of MacArthur's 8,000-volume military library, which included books inherited from his father, was lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|p=635.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he continued his habit of reading military history and biography until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1985|p=364.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his part in the capture of Manila, MacArthur was awarded his third Distinguished Service Cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=244.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern Philippines===

Although MacArthur had no specific directive from the Joint Chiefs to do so, and the fighting on Luzon was far from over, he committed the Eighth Army, Seventh Fleet and [[Thirteenth Air Force]] to a series of operations to liberate the remainder of the Philippines from the Japanese. A series of 52 amphibious landings were made in the central and southern Philippines between February and July 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=737–741.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the GHQ communiqué on July 5, MacArthur announced that the Philippines had now been liberated and all operations ended, although Yamashita still held out in northern Luzon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|p=749.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in May 1945, MacArthur used his Australian troops in the [[Borneo campaign (1945)|invasion of Borneo]]. MacArthur accompanied the [[Battle of North Borneo|assault on Labuan]] on USS ''Boise'', and visited the troops ashore, along with Lieutenant General Sir [[Leslie Morshead]] and [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[William Bostock]]. En route back to his headquarters in Manila, he visited [[Davao City|Davao]], where he told Eichelberger that no more than 4,000 Japanese remained alive on Mindanao. A few months later, six times that number would surrender. In July 1945, he set out on ''Boise'' once more to be with the Australian 7th Division for the [[Battle of Balikpapan (1945)|landing at Balikpapan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=757–761.}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacArthur was awarded his fourth Distinguished Service Medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=260.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1945, MacArthur became commander in chief U.S. Army Forces Pacific (AFPAC), in charge of all Army and Army Air Force units in the Pacific, except the [[Twentieth Air Force]]. At the same time, Nimitz became commander of all naval forces. Command in the Pacific therefore remained divided. GHQ became AFPAC headquarters in addition to SWPA. MacArthur created two new commands, AFMIDPAC under Lieutenant General [[Robert C. Richardson, Jr.]], and AFWESPAC under Lieutenant General [[Wilhelm D. Styer]], which absorbed [[USASOS]] and USAFFE.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=725–726.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reorganization, which took some months to actually accomplish, was part of preparations for [[Operation Downfall]], the invasion of Japan. The first phase, the invasion of [[Kyushu]], known as Operation Olympic, was scheduled to commence on November 1, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=765–771.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion was pre-empted by the [[surrender of Japan]] in August 1945. On September 2, MacArthur accepted the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|formal Japanese surrender]] aboard {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}}, thus ending hostilities in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1975|pp=786–792.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of his role as a maritime strategist, the U.S. Navy awarded him the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacArthur|1964|p=265.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Esther Hicks''' ([[née]] '''Weaver''', born March 5, 1948) is an American [[inspirational speaker]] and [[author]]. She has co-written nine books with her husband '''Jerry Hicks''', presented numerous workshops on the [[law of attraction (New Thought)|law of attraction]] with Abraham Hicks Publications and appeared in the original version of the 2006 film ''[[The Secret (2006 film)|The Secret]]''.&lt;ref name="shaking"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/25/fashion/25attraction.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/M/Motion%20Pictures |date=February 25, 2007 |work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Shaking Riches out of the Cosmos |accessdate=November 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hicks' books, including the series ''The Law of Attraction'', are — according to Esther Hicks — "translated from a group of non-physical entities called Abraham."

==Biography==
Esther Weaver was born in [[Coalville, Utah]]. In 1980 she married Jerry Hicks, then a successful [[Amway]] distributor. In his early life Jerry Hicks had been a circus acrobat for two years in Cuba, and then, beginning in 1948, had toured for 20 years as a musician, MC, and comedian.&lt;ref name="shaking" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dirty" /&gt;&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt; Esther has one daughter, Tracy, by her former marriage.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="australian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24223394-5012694,00.html | title=The secret of Rhonda's success |work=[[The Australian]] | date=August 23, 2008 |accessdate=April 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerry Hicks died on 18 November 2011 from [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abe-blog.com/2011/11/23/note-from-esther-about-jerry/ |work=Law of Attraction blog |title=Note from Esther about Jerry |date=November 23, 2011 |accessdate=December 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline of Abraham–Hicks' teachings==
According to Esther and Jerry Hicks, "Abraham" consists of a group of entities which are "interpreted" by Esther Hicks. Abraham have described themselves as "a group consciousness from the non-physical dimension". They have also said, "We are that which you are. You are the leading edge of that which we are. We are that which is at the heart of all religions." Abraham has said through Esther that, whenever one feels moments of great love, exhilaration, or pure joy, that is the energy of [[Source (disambiguation)| source]] and that is who Abraham is.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

Esther herself calls Abraham "infinite intelligence", and to Jerry they are "the purest form of love I've ever experienced". Her teachings (known as "Abraham–Hicks teachings") are based on this experience. The basic tenets of the teachings includes one that says that people create their own [[reality]] through their attention and focus.  [[Emotion]]s are a person's guidance system that indicate how close or distant that person is to how their Source feels about a particular topic of focus.  [[Personal life| Life]] is meant to be fun and easy. The essence of Abraham–Hicks' teachings since 1986 has been presented as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.abraham-hicks.com |title= Abraham-Hicks Official Website, About |accessdate= 27 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Individual]]s are physical extensions of the non-physical.
* People are in their bodies because they chose to [[being| be]].
* The basis of [[life (disambiguation)| life]] is [[freedom]]; the purpose of life is joy; the result of life is  growth.
* People are [[creator (disambiguation)| creators]]; they create with their thoughts and attention.
* Whatever people can imagine clearly with emotion, by creating a perfect [[vibration]]al match, is theirs to be, or do, or have.
* Individuals [[choice| choose]] their creations as they choose their focus.
* Emotions indicate what people are creating, either [[consciousness| consciously]] or unconsciously.
* The [[universe]] adores people; it knows their broadest intentions.
* Individuals are invited to happily relax into their natural [[well-being]] and know that all is well.
* Life is not meant to be a struggle, but a process of allowing.
* People are creators of "thoughtways" on their unique "paths of joy".
* Desirable physical manifestations such as [[money]], relationships, and lifestyle success are by-products of focusing on joy.
* Individuals may depart their body without illness or pain.
* People cannot [[death| die]]; their lives are everlasting.  Death of the physical body does not end the life of the individual. 
* The [[nature]] of the universe is life-affirming.  It is infinite, creative and expanding.
* All desire can be fulfilled.
* Individuals are not only a part of the universe but are the very source of it.

A large part of Hicks' work centers around the law of attraction, a concept which [[William Walker Atkinson]] (1862–1932) wrote about in his book ''Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction in the Thought World'' (1906).&lt;ref name="Thought Vibration"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
Esther Hicks narrated and appeared in the original version of the film ''The Secret'', as well as being a central source of the film's inspiration.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt; The footage featuring Hicks was removed from the later "Extended Edition" after the film's creator [[Rhonda Byrne]], who has been involved in contractual disputes and litigation regarding the film, rescinded the original contract covering Hicks' participation,&lt;ref name="australian" /&gt; and asked that Hicks relinquish her "intellectual property rights in these areas forever".&lt;ref name="Esther_Hicks"&gt;{{cite web |title=Letter to Friends |url=http://www.meetup.com/Washington-Abraham-Hicks/boards/view/viewthread?thread=2283719 |accessdate=April 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an open letter posted on the internet, Hicks stated that she had been "uncomfortable with what felt to us like a rather aggressive marketing campaign," and that ultimately Abraham gave her the following advice: "Whenever you are given an ultimatum that says, 'if you don't do this, then we will have to do such and such,' it is best that you just let it go and move on. Otherwise there is always another, and this, and this, and this."&lt;ref name="Esther_Hicks" /&gt; The letter doesn't condemn Byrne, but clarifies why Hicks no longer appears in ''The Secret''.

Hicks has since posted a video on YouTube further explaining her discomfort with ''The Secret'' and finally, her decision to discontinue involvement with the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFp-iPSPplE |title=Abraham: The Secret behind ''The Secret'' — Esther &amp; Jerry Hicks |publisher=[[YouTube]] | date=April 28, 2007 |accessdate=December 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since that book they have also published ''The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent'' (January 2006), ''The Law of Attraction'' (October 2006), ''The Astonishing Power of Emotions'' (September 2008), ''Money and the Law of Attraction: Learning to Attract Health, Wealth &amp; Happiness,'' and ''The Vortex: Where the Law of Attraction Assembles All Cooperative Relationships'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/31/books/bestseller/bestpaperadvice.html?_r=1&amp;8bu&amp;emc=bu&amp;oref=slogin |title=Best Sellers, August 31, 2008 |work=[[The New York Times]] | date=August 31, 2008 |accessdate=November 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Vortex"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2009-10-04/paperback-advice/list.html |title=Best Sellers, October 4, 2009 |work=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 4, 2009 |accessdate=March 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of fictional children's books, ''Sara I'', ''II'', and ''III'', is also available.

'''Ferdinand Nahimana''' (born 15 June 1950 in Gatonde commune)&lt;ref name="Ferdinand Nahimana"/&gt; is a [[Rwanda]]n historian, who was convicted of participating in the [[Rwandan genocide]].

Nahimana was co-founder of the radio station [[Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines]] (RTLM), which during the genocide broadcast information and propaganda that helped coordinate the killings and fuel the hatred against [[Tutsi]] and moderate [[Hutu]] victims. 

==Personal life==
Ferdinand Nahimana was born on 15 July in the Gatonde commune, in the [[Ruhengeri Prefecture]]. He is married with four children.&lt;ref name="ti"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trialinternational.org/latest-post/ferdinand-nahimana/ |title=FERDINAND NAHIMANA |publisher=Trial International |date=2016-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He holds a Doctorate of History from the [[University Paris Diderot]]. Between 1979 and 2007, he published many books and articles about Rwandan history. 

==Rwandan genocide==
Under the terms of the [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha peace agreements]], he was nominated as Higher Education Minister for Culture and Scientific Research. He was regarded as ideologue of the "[[Hutu Power]]" movement in Rwanda, and a member of President [[Juvenal Habyarimana|Habyarimana]]'s inner circle. Nahimana co-founded the [[Coalition for the Defence of the Republic]] (CDR) party.&lt;ref name="ti" /&gt;

Between 1979 and 1994, Nahimana is alleged to have written and published articles encouraging an uprising against the Tutsis and moderate Hutus.&lt;ref name="ti" /&gt;

Having been dismissed from the [[Radio Rwanda|Rwandan National Radio]] in 1993, he took part in the creation of the “Radio Télévision Libre des Milles Collines (RTLM)”, and according to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), became its director.&lt;ref name="ti" /&gt; Due to this involvement, he was accused of having "directly encouraged" the killings. Between April 1993 and 31 July 1994, Ferdinand Nahimana was accused of having planned, directed and supported the broadcasts of the RTLM. The ICTR prosecutor alleged that “he was aware of the programmes and the effect that these programmes had on the population”.&lt;ref name="ti" /&gt;

He was further accused of having organised, with the assistance of his brother, meetings between the MRND and the [[Interahamwe]] military in the [[Ruhengeri Prefecture]], with the intent of discussing the killings of Tutsis and Hutus.&lt;ref name="ti" /&gt;

In April 1994, as the violence erupted in Rwanda after President [[Juvénal Habyarimana]]'s death in a plane crash, the [[France|French]] embassy took Ferdinand Nahimana in, thereby helping him escape to [[Burundi]]. He was later arrested in [[Cameroon]] on 27 March 1996.&lt;ref name="ICTR 01" /&gt; Nahimana returned to Rwanda following [[Operation Turquoise]] through [[Democratic Republic of Congo|Zaire]]. Nahimana was arrested in Cameroon 26 March 1996.&lt;ref name="ti" /&gt;

==Trial and sentence==
Nahimana was prosecuted at the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]], together with two others who had been involved with the RTLM: [[Hassan Ngeze]] and [[Jean Bosco Barayagwiza]]. Nahimana claimed that he was innocent and denied having editorial control of the RTLM broadcasts during the killings: ''"I couldn't recognise the RTLM of those days from the one that existed before 6 April. It had been appropriated by radicals, what are now called extremists, whose way of seeing and doing things I did not share"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ics.leeds.ac.uk/papers/vp01.cfm?outfit=pmt&amp;folder=141&amp;paper=417 | title=Hate Radio: Rwanda from Radio Netherlands | publisher =[[University of Leeds]] | date=2003-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Hate Media|hate media]] trials" received attention since it was the first time since the [[Nuremberg trials]] that [[hate speech]] had been prosecuted as a war crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.washtimes.com/world/20031203-113817-3449r.htm | title=Hateful words a war crime | publisher =[[The Washington Times]] | date=2003-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 3, 2003, Ferdinand Nahimana was sentenced to life imprisonment, guilty of [[genocide]], [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit genocide, [[incitement]], directly and publicly, to commit genocide, [[complicity]] in genocide and [[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]]. Hassan Ngeze also got a life sentence, and Jean Bosco Barayagwiza was sentenced to 35 years in prison. Despite the sentences' possible impact on freedom of the press, [[Reporters Without Borders]] welcomed the outcome of the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/print.php3?id_article=8709 |title=Two sentenced to life imprisonment in hate media trial |publisher=[[Reporters Without Borders]] |date=2003-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210123/http://www.rsf.org/print.php3?id_article=8709 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nahimana, founder of the Radio Télévision Libre des Mille collines (RTLM) was convicted for his responsibility as a senior ranking official on the radio starting 6 April 1994, date on which he no longer exerted any role, according to his French lawyer Jean-Marie Biju- Duval. 

The Rwandan historian was convicted for having done nothing to stop the inflammatory content of the RTLM radio programmes after 6 April 1994, as he had, according to the judgment, an authority on the personnel of the radio station. 

Ferdinand Nahimana [[appeal|appealed]] his conviction, and the trial before the Appeals Chamber opened on 16 January 2007. On 28 November 2007, the Appeals Chamber reduced his prison term to 30 years. The Appeals Chamber overturned some of his convictions, notably those which concerned events that had taken place before 1994. The Appeals Chamber also overturned the initial conclusion that there had been an agreement between the RTLM, the CDR, and Kangura to assist in committing genocide. It therefore reversed the charges against Nahimana under Article 6(1) of the Stature, but upheld those under Article 6(3)—namely, those of "inciting directly and publicly to the commission of genocide and for persecution as a crime against humanity" by means of the RTLM broadcasts after 6 April 1994.&lt;ref name="ti"/&gt;

In December 2008, he has been transferred from Arusha (Tanzania) to Mali (in West Africa).&lt;ref name="ti"/&gt;

=== Controversy over conviction ===
A 2010 book written by journalist and historian Hervé Deguine argues that the motives invoked in Nahimana's trial were based on very little evidence except that he founded and was one of the owners of the radio station, exposing arguments and circumstantial evidence against his conviction. He concludes his book by affirming that on the basis of judicial proofs, Nahimana should be released.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation| last1=Deguine| first1=Hervé| lastauthoramp=yes| title=Un idéologue dans le génocide rwandais| publisher=Mille et une nuits| place=Paris| edition=1st| year=2010| pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frances Elena Farmer''' (September 19, 1913{{em dash}}August 1, 1970) was an American actress and television host. She appeared in over a dozen feature films over the course of her career, though she garnered notoriety for the various sensationalized accounts of her life, especially her [[involuntary commitment]] to a [[psychiatric hospital]] and subsequent mental health struggles.

A native of [[Seattle]], Washington, Farmer began acting in stage productions while a student at the [[University of Washington]]. After graduating, she began performing in [[summer stock|stock theater]] before signing a film contract with [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1936. She made her film debut in ''[[Too Many Parents]]'' (1936), followed by a lead role in the musical western, ''[[Rhythm on the Range]]'' (1936). Unhappy with the opportunities given to her by the studio, Farmer returned to stock theater in 1937 before being cast in the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of [[Clifford Odets]]'s ''[[Golden Boy (play)|Golden Boy]]'', staged by New York City's [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]]. She followed this with two Broadway productions directed by [[Elia Kazan]] in 1939, but a battle with [[clinical depression|depression]] and [[binge drinking]] caused her to drop out of a subsequent [[Ernest Hemingway]] stage adaptation.

Farmer returned to Los Angeles, earning supporting roles in the comedy ''[[World Premiere (film)|World Premiere]]'' (1941) and the film noir ''[[Among the Living (1941 film)|Among the Living]]'' (1941). In 1942, publicity of her reportedly erratic behavior began to surface, and after several arrests and committals to psychiatric institutions, Farmer was diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]]. At the request of her family, particularly her mother, she was relocated to an institution in her home state of Washington, where she remained a patient until 1950. Farmer attempted an acting comeback, mainly appearing as a television host in [[Indianapolis]] on her own series, ''[[Frances Farmer Presents]]''. Her final film role was in the 1958 drama ''[[The Party Crashers]]'', after which she spent the majority of the 1960s occasionally performing in local theater productions staged by [[Purdue University]]. In the spring of 1970, she was diagnosed with [[esophageal cancer]], of which she died several months later, aged 56.

She has been the subject of various works, including two feature films and several books, many of which focus heavily on her time spent institutionalized, during which she claimed to have been subject to various systemic abuses.&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;{{cite web|work=Yahoo! Movies|title=Frances Farmer Biography|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/person/frances-farmer/biography.html|deadurl=yes|accessdate=July 9, 2018|archivedate=December 24, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224120047/https://movies.yahoo.com/person/frances-farmer/biography.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her posthumously-released autobiography, ''Will There Really Be a Morning?'' (1972) details these claims significantly. A disputed 1978 biography of her life, ''Shadowland'', alleged that Farmer underwent a transorbital [[lobotomy]] during her institutionalization, and a [[Frances (film)|1982 biographical film]] based on her life depicted this event as truth, resulting in renewed interest in her life and career.

==Life and career==
===1913–1935: Early life===
Frances Elena Farmer{{sfn|Bragg|2005|p=66}}  was born on September 19, 1913 in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], the daughter of Lillian ([[née]] Van Ornum; 1873{{en dash}}1955), a boardinghouse operator and [[dietician]]{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=44}} and Ernest Melvin Farmer (1874{{en dash}}1956), a lawyer.{{Sfn|Shelley|2010|p=6}} Her father was originally from [[Spring Valley, Minnesota]],{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=7}} while her mother was from [[Oregon]], and a descendant of [[American pioneer|pioneers]].{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=7}} Farmer had an older sister, Edith; one older brother, Wesley,{{Sfn|Shelley|2010|p=6}} and an older half-sister, Rita, conceived during her mother's first marriage.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=5}} Prior to the birth of Wesley and Edith, Ernest and Lillian had given birth to a daughter who died of [[pneumonia]] in infancy.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=7}} When she was four years old, Farmer's parents separated, and her mother relocated with the children from their home in North Seattle to [[Los Angeles]], where her sister Zella was living.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=7}} In early 1925, the family moved north to [[Chico, California]], where Lillian pursued a career performing nutrition research.{{sfn|Agan|1979|pages=9–10}} Shortly after arriving in Chico, Lillian concluded that caring for the children was interfering with her ability to work.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=10}} The children's Aunt Zella then drove them to [[Albany, Oregon]], where they boarded a train back to Seattle to live with their father.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=10}}

[[File:Frances Farmer 1935 newspaper photo.png|thumb|left|upright=.7|Farmer in a press photo for her winning the ''Voice of Action'' writing contest, April 10, 1935]]
Farmer's inconsistent home life had a notable effect on her, and upon returning to Seattle, she recalled: "In certain ways, that train trip represented the end of my dependent childhood. I began to understand that there were certain things one could expect from adults, and others that one could not expect...&amp;nbsp; being shunted from one household to another was a new adjustment, a fresh confusion, and I groped for ways to compensate for the disorder."{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=9}} The following year, her mother returned to Seattle after her home in Chico burned down in a house fire.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=10}} In Seattle, the family shared a household, though Lillian and Ernest remained separated despite his attempts to reconcile their marriage.{{Sfn|Shelley|2010|p=7}}{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=10}} In the fall of 1929, when Farmer was sixteen, Lillian and Ernest divorced, and Lillian relocated to a cottage in [[Bremerton, Washington]], while the children remained with their father.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=7}}

In 1931, while a senior at [[West Seattle High School]], Farmer entered and won $100 from [[The Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards]], a writing contest sponsored by ''Scholastic Magazine'', with her controversial essay "God Dies."&lt;ref name=wp&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Washington Post]]|title=The Unraveling of Frances Farmer|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1983/01/23/the-unraveling-of-frances-farmer/8b1160fd-9535-474b-84e7-8bc08be388a7/|date=January 23, 1983|accessdate=August 13, 2018|author=Estrin, Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a precocious attempt to reconcile her wish for, in her words, a "superfather" God, with her observations of a chaotic and godless world. In her autobiography, she wrote that the essay was influenced by her reading of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]: "He expressed the same doubts, only he said it in German: 'Gott ist tot.' God is dead. This I could understand. I was not to assume that there was no God, but I could find no evidence in my life that He existed or that He had ever shown any particular interest in me. I was not an [[atheist]], but I was surely an [[agnostic]], and by the time I was sixteen I was well indoctrinated into this theory."{{Sfn|Farmer|1972|p=159}}

After graduating high school, Farmer enrolled at the [[University of Washington]], initially majoring in [[journalism]].{{sfn|Farmer|1972|p=48}} She worked various odd jobs to pay her tuition, including as an [[Usher (occupation)|usherette]] in a cinema, a waitress, a [[tutor]], and a laborer in a soap factory.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=7}} For a time, she also worked as a singing waitress at [[Mount Rainier National Park]].{{sfn|Farmer|1972|p=48}} During her sophomore year, Farmer became involved with the university's drama department productions, which were considered citywide cultural events and were frequented accordingly. While a student at UW, Farmer starred in numerous plays, including ''[[Helen of Troy]]'', ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]'', and ''[[Uncle Vanya]]''.{{sfn|Agan|1979|pages=11–13}} In late 1934, she starred in the UW production of ''Alien Corn'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Frances Farmer: A Seattle Girl Reaches Broadway Via Hollywood|journal=Life|date=January 17, 1938|volume=4|issue=3|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wkoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q=frances%20farmer%20alien%20corn|publisher=Time Inc.|issn=0024-3019|via=Google Books}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; which earned her favorable reviews in local press.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=11}}

During her final year of college in 1935, Farmer won a subscription contest for the [[leftist]] newspaper, ''The Voice of Action''.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=11}} The first prize was a trip to the [[Soviet Union]]—Farmer accepted the prize, despite her mother's strong objections, so that she could see the pioneering [[Moscow Art Theatre]]. Farmer's interest in such topics fostered speculations that Farmer was not only an atheist, but a [[Communism|Communist]] as well.{{Sfn|Shelley|2010|p=8}} The same year, she graduated from the university earning a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[theatre|drama]].{{sfn|Farmer|1972|p=48}}&lt;ref name="ae"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/frances-farmer-9542364#early-career|work=The Biography Channel|title=Frances Farmer Biography|accessdate=February 16, 2016|publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1935–1936: First films and rise to fame===
[[File:Frances Farmer Paramount still.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.8|Farmer in ''[[Rhythm on the Range]]'' (1936)]]
Returning from the Soviet Union in the summer of 1935, Farmer stopped in [[New York City]], hoping to launch a legitimate theater career.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|pages=9–11}} There she met talent agent Shepard Traube,{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=9}} who referred her to [[Paramount Pictures]] talent scout [[Oscar Serlin]], who arranged for a screen test.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=10}} Paramount offered her a seven-year contract, which Farmer signed in New York City on her 22nd birthday.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=10}} After completing screen tests in [[Long Island]], Farmer relocated to Los Angeles to begin working for Paramount.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|pages=9–10}} Upon arriving, she underwent dental surgery to fix a gap in her front teeth, and spent long hours screen-testing and training on the Paramount studio lot.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=11}} In November 1935, she was cast in the [[B-movie]] ''[[Too Many Parents]]'' (1936), a comedy about young men in military school.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=12}} The film was a box office success.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=12}} After completing the film in February 1936, Farmer wed fellow Paramount contract player [[Leif Erickson (actor)|Leif Erickson]], whom she met on the studio lot.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=16}} She was then cast in a lead role in the drama ''[[Border Flight]]''.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=79-80}}{{Sfn|Reid|2013|p=11}}

Later that year, Farmer was cast in her first "A" feature, ''[[Rhythm on the Range]]'', a Western starring [[Bing Crosby]].{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=17}} She recalled of the film: "I had had a crush on him [Crosby] since my high school days, and stood in awe of the fact that in my first important film I was actually working as his leading lady."{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=18}} ''Rhythm on the Range'' earned favorable reviews and brought Farmer an enhanced public reputation.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=17}} After its release, Paramount studio head [[Adolph Zukor]] phoned her and told her that "now that she was a rising star she'd have to start acting like one."{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=17}} Farmer was resistant, however, and spent most of her time at her home in [[Laurel Canyon]] with Erickson, forgoing invitations to Hollywood parties and events.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=17}} In an attempt to make Farmer marketable, Paramount chose to brand her in press releases as "the star who would not go Hollywood," focusing on her "eccentric" fashion tastes.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=17}}

During the summer of 1936, she was loaned to [[Samuel Goldwyn]] to appear in ''[[Come and Get It (1936 film)|Come and Get It]]'', based on the novel by [[Edna Ferber]], in which she portrayed a young woman who falls in love with her mother's husband.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=18}} [[Howard Hawks]] was originally signed to direct, but was replaced by [[William Wyler]] midway through production; Farmer was indignant and clashed with Wyler during filming.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=18}} He would later state: "The nicest thing I can say about Frances Farmer is that she is unbearable."{{sfn|Malone|2015|p=35}} Though her working relationship with Wyler was tumultuous, Hawks remembered Farmer admirably, saying that she "had more talent that anyone I ever worked with."{{sfn|Karney|1984|p=62}} Because it was set in the [[Pacific Northwest]], producers chose to premiere the film in Seattle, Farmer's hometown.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=18}} At the premiere, Farmer was notably quiet and spoke little to reporters, which resulted in news coverage branding her as cold and aloof.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=18}} Despite this coverage of the premiere, ''Come and Get It'' earned praise from the public and critics, with several reviews greeting Farmer as a new found star, some likening her to [[Greta Garbo]].{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=18}}

In 1937, she was loaned to [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] to star opposite [[Cary Grant]] in ''[[The Toast of New York]]'', the story of a [[Wall Street]] tycoon.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=18}} The film's production was turbulent as Farmer was unhappy with the rebranding of her character from a hard-edged vixen to "an [[ingénue]] fresh from [[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm|Sunnybrook]]."{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=18}} On set, she argued with director [[Rowland V. Lee]] and gave belittling interviews to the press.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=19}} Unsatisfied with the direction of her career after ''The Toast of New York'', Farmer resisted the studio's control and resisted every attempt they made to glamorize her private life. However, Farmer was sympathetically described in a 1937 ''[[Collier's]]'' article as being indifferent about the clothing she wore and was said to drive an older-model "green roadster."{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=16}} Also in 1937, she appeared in the crime drama ''[[Exclusive (film)|Exclusive]]'' opposite [[Fred MacMurray]], and the [[Technicolor]] adventure film ''[[Ebb Tide (1937 film)|Ebb Tide]]''.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=19}}

===1937–1941: Transition to theater===
[[File:Group-Theatre-1938.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|Leif Erickson and Farmer (front row, far left) with members of the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]] in 1938]]
Unsatisfied with the expectations of the [[studio system]] and wanting to enhance her reputation as a serious actress, Farmer left Hollywood in mid-1937 to do [[summer stock]] on the East Coast, performing in [[Westchester, New York]] and [[Westport, Connecticut]].{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=16}} There, she attracted the attention of director [[Harold Clurman]] and playwright [[Clifford Odets]], who invited her to appear in a three-month production of Odets' play ''[[Golden Boy (play)|Golden Boy]]'',{{sfn|Shelley|2010|pages=16–20}} produced by the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]].{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=19}} The play opened in November 1937 and ran for a total of 248 performances.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=20}} Her performance at first received mixed reviews, with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine commenting that she had been miscast.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=19}} Due to Farmer's box office appeal, however, the play became the biggest hit in the Group's history. By 1938, when the production had embarked on a national tour, regional critics from [[Washington D.C.]] to [[Chicago]] gave her rave reviews.&lt;ref name="shedding"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frances Farmer: Shedding Light on ''Shadowland''|url=http://jeffreykauffman.net/francesfarmer/sheddinglight.html|work=Shadowland|accessdate=January 4, 2013|author=Kauffman, Jeffrey|origyear=1999|year=2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721105027/http://jeffreykauffman.net/francesfarmer/sheddinglight.html|archive-date=July 21, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the run of ''Golden Boy'', Farmer began a romantic affair with Odets, but he was married to actress [[Luise Rainer]] and did not offer Farmer a commitment.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|pages=18–22}} Farmer felt betrayed when Odets suddenly ended the relationship; and when the Group chose another actress for its London run{{en dash}}an actress whose family helped secure funds for the play{{en dash}}she came to believe that the Group had used her drawing power selfishly to further the success of the play.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|pages=18–22}}{{sfn|Agan|1979|pages=19–21}} Disheartened, Farmer returned to Los Angeles to star opposite husband Erickson in ''[[Ride a Crooked Mile]]'' (1938).{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=20}} In April 1939, she performed in a short-run [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''Quiet City'', an experimental play directed by [[Elia Kazan]].{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=22}} In November that year, she returned to Broadway portraying Melanie in ''[[Thunder Rock (play)|Thunder Rock]]'', also directed by Kazan, and produced by the Group Theater.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=20}} The play was not well-received, and Farmer was profoundly unhappy after its closing in December 1939.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=20}} She subsequently accepted a role in a Broadway adaptation of [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories|The Fifth Column]]'', which she was scheduled to begin rehearsing in early 1940.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=20}} During rehearsals, Farmer began [[binge drinking]] in an effort to alleviate her [[clinical depression|depression]].{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=20}} She ultimately chose to withdraw from the production, resulting in a $1,500 fine from the Theater Guild, for "unprofessionalism."{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=20}}

She returned to Paramount, who assigned her a role in ''[[South of Pago Pago]]'' (1940), in which she portrayed Ruby, a woman traveling with a group of adventurers searching for pearls on an island.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=21}} She was then loaned to [[Warner Bros.]] to star in ''[[Flowing Gold]]'', an adventure drama set against the oil industry, opposite [[John Garfield]].{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=20}} After completing the film, Farmer returned to the East Coast to appear in summer stock theater.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=21}} Following a "lonely winter" spent living in New York City, Farmer drove back to Los Angeles in the spring of 1941, and rented a lavish mansion in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]].{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=21}} Her next film was ''[[World Premiere (film)|World Premiere]]'' (1941), a comedy starring [[John Barrymore]].{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=21}} She followed this with a supporting part in the [[film noir]] ''[[Among the Living (1941 film)|Among the Living]]'' (1941), co-starring with [[Susan Hayward]] and [[Albert Dekker]].{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=21}}

During this time, Farmer was "seeking in work a respite from her personal struggles."{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=21}} Clurman temporarily moved into her Santa Monica home to keep her company while she completed filming of ''[[Badlands of Dakota]]'', a Western in which she starred as [[Calamity Jane]] opposite [[Robert Stack]].{{sfn|Agan|1979|pages=21–22}} Farmer again fought with the studio over the role, which she felt was over-glamorized, further damaging her reputation with studio executives.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=22}} She next appeared opposite [[Tyrone Power]] and [[Roddy McDowall]] in the film ''[[Son of Fury]]'' (1942) (on loan-out to [[20th Century Fox]]), portraying the scheming daughter of a British aristocrat.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=22}} Later that year, Paramount suspended her after she refused to accept a part in the film ''[[Take a Letter, Darling]]'' and voided her contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19580512&amp;id=WQsTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7QQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1569,2098076|title=Francis Farmer Notes Lack Of Activity At Film Studio|last=Thomas|first=Bob|work=Ocala Star-Banner|location=Ocala, Florida|page=6|accessdate=August 26, 2014|via=Newspapers.com}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&amp;dat=19430114&amp;id=LglQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DFUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2901,1703067|title=Frances Farmer Gets Six Months For Drunk Driving|date=January 15, 1943|work=The Evening Independent|page=8|accessdate=August 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, her marriage to Erickson had disintegrated, and he began dating actress [[Margaret Hayes]].{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=27}} Their divorce was finalized on June 12, 1942,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=860&amp;dat=19571223&amp;id=aQVPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7UsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7102,6748754|title=Frances Farmer Returns To Hollywood For Another Try At Career|date=December 23, 1957|work=Ellensburg Daily Record|page=10|location=Ellensburg, Washington|via=Google News|accessdate=August 16, 2014}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Erickson married Hayes the same day.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=27}}

===1942–1949: Legal troubles and psychiatric confinement===
On October 19, 1942, Farmer was stopped by [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica Police]] for driving with her headlights on bright in the wartime [[blackout (wartime)|blackout]] zone that affected most of the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1983&amp;dat=19421020&amp;id=JQJgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QyANAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4309,4104387|title=Frances Farmer, Actress, Jailed|date=October 20, 1942|work=San Jose Evening News|location=San Jose, California|via=Google News|page=8|accessdate=August 26, 2014}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reports stated she was unable to produce a driver's license and was verbally abusive to the officers.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=22}}{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=236}} The police suspected her of being drunk and she was jailed overnight.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=236}} Farmer was fined $500 and given a 180-day suspended sentence.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=22}} She immediately paid $250 and was put on probation.&lt;ref name="petersburg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19430115&amp;id=9SFPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dk0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7320,5089605|title=Actress Jailed But Only After Battle With Police|date=January 14, 1943|work=St. Petersburg Times|location=St. Petersburg, Florida|page=12|accessdate=August 26, 2014|via=Google News}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=238}} With her vehicle impounded and her driver's license suspended, Farmer holed up in her Santa Monica home and denied the press interviews.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=22}}

In November 1942, her agent secured her a role in an independent film adaptation of [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''Murder at Laudice'', which was set to film in [[Mexico City]].{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=24}} Upon arriving in Mexico, she discovered that the shooting script was unfinished, and the production never reached fruition.{{efn|According to Farmer's sister Edith, she dropped out of the production after waiting two weeks in Mexico City for script rewrites to take places.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=29}}}} While in Mexico City, Farmer was allegedly charged with [[public intoxication|drunk and disorderly conduct]] and disturbing the peace, and was forced by authorities to return to the United States.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=24}} Upon returning to California, she found her Santa Monica home had been cleared of her possessions and inhabited by a strange family.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=24}} Farmer would later contend that her mother and sister-in-law had stripped the house and stored her belongings while she was gone.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=24}} Her mother rented her a room at the [[Knickerbocker Hotel (Los Angeles)|Knickerbocker Hotel]] in Hollywood, where she temporarily took residence.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=24}}

By January 1943, Farmer had failed to pay the remainder of her fine, and a [[bench warrant]] was issued for her arrest. At almost the same time,{{sfn|Bragg|2005|p=69}} a studio hairdresser filed an [[assault]] charge alleging that Farmer had hit her in the face and dislocated her jaw on set.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=238}} Shortly after, Farmer was allegedly seen running down [[Sunset Boulevard]] topless after getting into a brawl at a bar.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=238}} On January 14, 1943, police traced Farmer to the Knickerbocker and arrived at her room to arrest her. Getting no answer, they entered her room with a pass key.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=238}} Farmer did not surrender peacefully,&lt;ref name=Tmn /&gt; and was dragged out of the hotel nude to police headquarters.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=238}}

At her hearing the following morning, Farmer behaved erratically: She claimed the police had violated her [[civil rights]], demanded an attorney, and threw an [[inkwell]] at the judge, resulting in her being restrained by bailiffs.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=25}}{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=32}} When asked about her drinking habits, Farmer told the judge: "I put liquor in my milk...&amp;nbsp; in my coffee and in my orange juice."{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=25}} She also admitted to regularly drinking [[History of Benzedrine|benzedrine]].{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=25}} The judge ultimately sentenced her to 180 days in jail.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=32}} While being escorted from the courtroom, Farmer lashed out, knocking down a policeman and bruising another, along with a matron; she ran to a phone booth where she tried to call her attorney, but was subdued by the police.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|pages=32–34}} When they physically carried her away, she shouted: "Have you ever had a broken heart?"&lt;ref name="petersburg"/&gt;{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=32}}

Through the efforts of her sister-in-law, a deputy sheriff in Los Angeles County, Farmer avoided jail time and was instead transferred to the psychiatric ward of [[Los Angeles General Hospital]] on January 20.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=32}} There, she was diagnosed with "[[manic depressive]] [[psychosis]], probably the forerunner of a definite [[dementia praecox]]."{{sfn|Commire|Klezmer|2000|p=390}} Days later, with assistance from the [[Screen Actors Guild]], she was transferred to the Kimball Sanitarium, a minimum-security psychiatric institute in the [[San Fernando Valley]].{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=26}} Resident psychiatrists Donald A. Nicholson and George Price both examined Farmer, and formally diagnosed her with [[paranoid schizophrenia]].{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=33}} She was administered [[insulin shock therapy]], a treatment then accepted as standard psychiatric procedure, and whose side effects included intense [[nausea]].{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=33}} Her family later claimed they did not give their consent to the treatment,{{sfn|Shelley|2010|pages=33–34}} as documented in her sister's self-published book, ''Look Back in Love'', and in court records; Farmer herself would later allege that she was given insulin treatments for 90 consecutive days.{{sfn|Bragg|2005|p=75}} After spending nine months at the Kimball Sanitarium, Farmer walked out of the institute one afternoon and traveled to her half-sister Rita's house, over {{convert|20|mi|km}} away. The pair then called their mother, Lillian, in Seattle to complain about the insulin treatments.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|pages=33-36}}

Lillian traveled to California and began a lengthy legal battle to take formal guardianship of her daughter from the state of California. Although several psychiatrists testified that Farmer needed further treatment, her mother prevailed. The two of them left Los Angeles by train on September 13, 1943.&lt;ref name="shedding"/&gt; Farmer moved in with her parents in West Seattle, but she and her mother fought bitterly. Farmer wrote in her autobiography: "Mamma and I had fought, argued, threatened, and screamed until it had finally come down to a climax of two exhausted women sitting across from each other in a small, cluttered kitchen. We were enemies who had grown tired of pretending."{{sfn|Farmer|1972|p=13}} After one violent physical attack, Lillian had Farmer committed to [[Western State Hospital (Washington State)|Western State Hospital]] at [[Steilacoom, Washington|Steilacoom]], Washington.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=40}} Three months later, in early July 1944, she was pronounced "completely cured" and released.{{sfn|Dunkelberger|Neary|2014|p=115}} Shortly after her release, on July 15, Farmer was arrested for [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] in [[Antioch, California]].{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=35}}

In January 1945, Farmer's father brought her to stay at her aunt's ranch in [[Yerington, Nevada]].&lt;ref name=reno/&gt;{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=35}} During her stay, Farmer ran away from the residence.{{sfn|Arnold|1978|p=138}} She was discovered several days later at a movie theater in [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], and returned by police to her aunt's home.&lt;ref name=reno&gt;{{cite news|date=January 14, 1945|title=Reno Police Return 'Lost' Frances Farmer|p=8|work=Wisconsin State Journal|location=Madison, Wisconsin|publisher=United Press|via=Newspapers.com|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22759602/wisconsin_state_journal/}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several months later, on May 18, 1945, Lillian filed for a [[Competency evaluation (law)|sanity hearing]] for Farmer after she ran away from their home in Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Brooklyn Daily Eagle]]|location=Brooklyn, New York|title=Seeks Sanity Hearing For Frances Farmer|p=1|date=May 18, 1945|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22759623/the_brooklyn_daily_eagle/|via=Newspapers.com}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hearing was held on May 21, during which it was ruled that Farmer was be re-committed to Western State Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Frances Farmer Sent Back to Hospital|publisher=Associated Press|date=May 21, 1945|p=10|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22759671/the_los_angeles_times/|via=Newspapers.com}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; She would remain an inmate of the hospital for the following five years, with the exception of a brief parole in 1946.&lt;ref name="shedding"/&gt; Throughout her internment, Farmer remained in the high-security ward for the hospital's "violent" patients.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=40}} Her treatment at Western State would be subject to significant public and critical [[#Western State|discussion in the years after her death]].{{sfn|Dunkelberger|Neary|2014|p=115}}

===1950–1958: Post-hospitalization and comeback attempt===
On March 23, 1950, at her parents' request, Farmer was paroled back into her mother's care.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=53}} One year later, on March 25, 1951, Farmer was formally discharged from the jurisdiction of Western State, but was not made aware of it for two years; in the interim, she believed her re-commitment to the hospital an imminent threat.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=28}} In June 1953, upon discovering her discharge, Farmer requested that her mother's [[conservatorship]] be lifted, which was successfully awarded by the Superior Court.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=29}}{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=53}} With her freedom restored, Farmer took a job sorting laundry at the [[Fairmont Olympic Hotel (Seattle)|Olympic Hotel]] in Seattle,{{sfn|Commire|Klezmer|2000|p=392}} the same hotel where she had been fêted in 1936 at the world premiere of ''Come and Get It''.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=40}} While working at the Olympic Hotel, a co-worker set Farmer up on a [[blind date]] with Alfred H. Lobley, a 45-year-old city utility worker.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|pages=51–54}} The two married in April 1954,{{sfn|Commire|Klezmer|2000|p=392}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hayes|first=Peter|title=Frances Farmer, once film star wins big fight; Plans comeback|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19570508&amp;id=zd5QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qyUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6578,4950391|accessdate=July 20, 2012|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date= May 8, 1957|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|via=Google News}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved in with Farmer's mother Lillian, who was growing senile and needed assistance at home.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=29}} Within the year, Lillian was sent to a nursing home, after which Farmer's marriage to Lobley began to disintegrate.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=54}}

Farmer remained estranged from her mother until her death of a [[stroke]] in March 1955. After their mother's death, Farmer's sister Edith relocated to [[Portland, Oregon]] to be nearer to their father, who died there the following year on July 15, 1956, also of a stroke.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=43}} During this time, Farmer and Edith corresponded occasionally via letters.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=42}} Edith claimed that on one occasion Farmer visited her in Portland, where the two spent an afternoon at [[The Grotto]], a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] sanctuary they had once visited with their father.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=52}}

[[File:Frances Farmer c. 1958.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Woman with hair pinned up, smiling|Farmer {{circa}} 1958]]
In late 1957, Farmer separated from Lobley and relocated to [[Eureka, California]], where she found work as a bookkeeper and secretary at a commercial photo studio.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=43}}{{sfn|Agan|1979|pages=29–30}} In Eureka, she met Leland C. Mikesell, an independent broadcast promoter from [[Indianapolis]], who recognized her at a local bar.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=30}} The two soon became romantic, and Mikesell envisioned a career comeback for her.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=30}} They relocated to [[San Francisco]], where Farmer temporarily worked as a clerk at the Park Sheraton Hotel.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=30}}{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=43}} In 1958, she and Mikesell married.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=58}}

In a December 1957 interview with ''[[Modern Screen]]'', Farmer said: "I blame nobody for my fall. I had to face agonizing decisions when I was younger. The decisions broke me. But, too, there was a lack of philosophy in my life. With faith in myself and in God I think I have won the fight to control myself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=[[Modern Screen]]|date=December 1957|p=90|url=https://archive.org/stream/modernscreen51unse#page/n1045/|via=Internet Archive|title=The Seven Christmases of Frances Farmer|author=DeBlasio, Ed|issn=0026-8429}}&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently made two appearances on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', during one of which she played guitar and sang "[[Aura Lea|Aura Lee]]," a folk song she had performed in ''Come and Get It'' (1936).{{sfn|Agan|1979|pages=30–31}} She also appeared on ''[[This Is Your Life]]'', the latter program perceived by the actress as an opportunity to clarify the veracity of the publicity that she had received throughout her career thus far. Farmer explained to ''This is Your Life'''s host, Ralph Edwards:

{{quote|I would very much like to correct some impressions which arose out of a lot of stories that were written—about me, I guess; but they weren't about me—suggesting things that I couldn't possibly have been doing. Which I never did. I wasn't in a position to defend myself at the time these stories were published. And I'm very happy to be here tonight to let people see that I am the kind of person I am and not a legend that arose.&lt;ref name="Tmn"/&gt;}}

Edwards later asked Farmer about her supposed alcoholism: "Other stories accuse you of being an alcoholic. Were you, Frances?" Farmer's reply was, "No, I was never an alcoholic.", an adamant denial that also applied to Edwards' subsequent question about "dope."&lt;ref name="Tmn" /&gt;

In August 1957, Farmer returned to the stage in [[New Hope, Pennsylvania]], for a summer stock production of [[Enid Bagnold]]'s ''[[The Chalk Garden]]''.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=31}} Through the spring of 1958, Farmer appeared in several live television dramas, some of which are preserved on [[kinescope]]; the same year, she made her last film, ''[[The Party Crashers]]'', a [[potboiler]] drama produced by Paramount and described by one writer as "a crappy B-movie about wild teenagers and stupid adults."&lt;ref name="Tmn" /&gt;{{Sfn|Shelley|2010|p=65}} Then, in the July 1958, Farmer accepted the lead role in a production of ''Yes, My Darling Daughter'', due to the reciprocal arrangements that existed between one of the summer stock East Coast theaters that she performed in and venues in the Midwest; this particular role was based at a theater in [[Indianapolis]].{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=50}}

===1959–1964: Stage and television work===
Farmer's stage work proved to be beneficial, as she received the opportunity to host her own daytime movie program, ''Frances Farmer Presents.''  The show was created after a television executive from the local [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company (NBC)]] [[WRTV#As an ABC affiliate|affiliate]], WFBM-TV (now known as [[WRTV]]), saw her performance in ''The Chalk Garden'' in August 1958.&lt;ref name="Tmn" /&gt; Farmer's television program made her popular as an amiable host, and she subsequently received an award as a local businesswoman of the year.&lt;ref name="Tmn" /&gt; However, by March 1959 national wire service reports indicated that she had separated from Mikesell, and that he was suing her for breach of contract.{{efn|Edith claimed the lawsuit against Farmer totaled $50,000, though Farmer herself would claim in a letter to Edith that the suit was actually $200,000.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=49}}}} In 1959, Farmer moved in with Jeanira "Jean" Ratcliffe, a widow with whom she became good friends in Indianapolis.{{sfn|Lund|1980|p=28}}

In 1962, Farmer appeared in a [[Purdue University]] production of [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]''.&lt;ref name="Tate"&gt;{{cite web|title=Farmer, Frances (1913-1970) -- Part 2 HistoryLink.org Essay 5059|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=5059|work=HistoryLink.org|publisher=Historylink|accessdate=January 4, 2013|last=Tate|first=Cassandra|format=Essay|date=January 17, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, her divorce from Mikesell was finalized in Indianapolis.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=32}} ''Frances Farmer Presents'' eventually ended at the end of the summer of 1964; the station's general manager had fired her in April of that year, hired her back two months later, but then dismissed Farmer permanently in late-August/early-September, aggravated by her alleged drinking binges.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=32}} Farmer continued her stage work and accepted a role in a Purdue Summer Theatre production of [[Ketti Frings]]' ''[[Look Homeward, Angel (play)|Look Homeward, Angel]]'' after the demise of her television host role.&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt; In 1965, Farmer played the role of Claire Zachanassian in the university's production of [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]]'s ''[[The Visit (play)|The Visit]]'', which ran at the Loeb Playhouse on the Purdue University campus from October 22 to October 30, 1965; the latter production has been described in the following manner:

{{quote|The Purdue production wasn't to be the slick Broadway or Hollywood adaptations of the play, but the original "grotesque version." Zachanassian, the richest woman in the world, yet also weirdly handicapped (she sports a wooden leg and an ivory hand), has returned triumphantly (but as an old woman) to the impoverished village of her youth. She offers to save its citizens from poverty on one terrible condition: that they kill Albert Ill, the local grocer, who'd broken her heart when they were teenagers. Zachanassian is a charming and terrible figure—imagine the lovechild of [[Frankenstein]] and [[Greta Garbo]].&lt;ref name="Tmn" /&gt;}}

During the production of ''The Visit'', Farmer was involved in a drunk-driving accident.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=55}} When confronted by police, she recalled: "Rather than answering as Frances Farmer, I reverted to my role in the play and [suddenly became] the richest woman in the world, shouting to high heaven that I would buy his goddamned town. I got out stiff-legged and ivory-handed, quoting all the imperious lines I could remember. Unfortunately, this did not [sit] well with the [cop], and a patrol car took me to jail."&lt;ref name="Tmn" /&gt; Ironically, following the appearance of the incident in the media, the next night's performance of ''The Visit'' completely sold out. Farmer was very reluctant to return to the stage, but was encouraged by Ratcliffe; Farmer recounted the experience of the performance in her autobiography: "[T]here was a long silent pause as I stood there, followed by the most thunderous applause of my career. [The audience] swept the scandal under the rug with their ovation." It was "my finest and final performance. I knew I would never need to act onstage again. I felt satisfied and rewarded."{{sfn|Farmer|1972|p=292}}

===1965–1970: Final years===
During the early and mid-1960s, Farmer was actress-in-residence at [[Purdue University]], and spent the majority of her free time painting and writing poetry.{{sfn|Agan|1979|pages=31–33}} Farmer and Ratcliffe attempted to start a small company producing cosmetics, but although their products were successfully field-tested, the project failed after their funds were [[embezzlement|embezzled]] by the man who handled their investment portfolio.{{Sfn|Farmer|1972|pages=310–311}} In 1968, she formally converted to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] as she claimed to have felt God in her life and sensed that she "would have to find a disciplined avenue of faith and worship."{{sfn|Lund|1980|p=28}} She recounted her experience: {{quote|I had never given great concern to organized religion, and I was like a wayfaring stranger until one day I found myself sitting in Saint Joan of Arc, the Catholic church of our neighborhood.

It was quiet and dark, and I studied the massive altar and understood, for the first time, the power and meaning of the Crucifixion.{{sfn|Lund|1980|pages=28–29}}}} Farmer had a great affection for the Saint Joan of Arc church and attended services there regularly in her last years of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rose, Rita|title=Frances Farmer, Part 4: Friends saw Frances as generous, loving|work=[[The Indianapolis Star]]|date=January 26, 1983|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, she also gave up drinking,{{Sfn|Farmer|1972|p=309}} and began considering writing an [[autobiography]]: She negotiated a collaboration with [[Lois Kibbee]], who encouraged her to tape-record her life story.{{sfn|Agan|1979|pages=32–33}} The experience was emotionally jarring for Farmer, specifically the revisiting of medical records from her institutionalization.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=33}} The book went unfinished, though Ratcliffe would utilize its manuscript in compiling Farmer's posthumously-released autobiography, ''Will There Really Be a Morning?''.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=34}}

==Death==
Farmer was diagnosed with [[esophageal cancer]] in the spring of 1970, which was attributed to her lifelong habit of heavy smoking.{{Sfn|Sellers|2010}} She was hospitalized for three weeks, before being sent home for a brief period.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=33}} She died of the cancer at Indianapolis Community Hospital on August 1, 1970.{{sfn|Agan|1979|p=33}}{{sfn|Donnelly|2003|pages=240-41}} She is interred at Oaklawn Memorial Gardens Cemetery in [[Fishers, Indiana]].{{Sfn|Stoner|2011|p=20}}

==Posthumous controversies==
===Allegations of psychiatric mistreatment===
{{anchor|Western State}}[[File:Western State Hospital, Washington.png|thumb|upright=.9|right|The details of Farmer's confinement at [[Western State Hospital (Washington)|Western State Hospital]] ''(pictured)'' were subject to significant controversy and discussion after her death]]
In the years following Farmer's death in 1970, her treatment at Western State was the subject of serious discussion and wild speculation. [[Kenneth Anger]] included a chapter relating her breakdown in ''[[Hollywood Babylon]]''. Farmer's posthumously-published autobiography ''Will There Really Be a Morning?'', described a brutal incarceration. In the book, Farmer claimed she had been brutalized and mistreated in numerous ways. Some of the claims included being forced to eat her own [[feces]]{{sfn|Friedrich|1976|p=30}} and act as a [[sexual slavery|sex slave]] for male doctors and orderlies. Farmer recounted her stay in the state asylum as "unbearable terror": "I was raped by orderlies, gnawed on by rats and poisoned by tainted food. I was chained in padded cells, strapped into strait-jackets and half-drowned in ice baths."{{sfn|Harris|Landis|1997|p=146}}

Farmer's close friend and housemate, Ratcliffe, arranged the publication of ''Will There Really Be a Morning?''. Controversy exists over what portions of the book Ratcliffe may have edited or ghostwritten. Ratcliffe claimed she only wrote the final chapter dealing with Farmer's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&amp;dat=19830330&amp;id=Ot4qAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GYMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6874,6044552|title=Frances Farmer's life surfaces in films, plays|last=Rose|first=Rita|date=March 30, 1983|work=The Deseret News|page=9|accessdate=August 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lobotomy claims===
In 1978, Seattle film reviewer William Arnold published ''Shadowland,'' which for the first time alleged that Farmer had been the subject of a transorbital [[lobotomy]].{{sfn|Arnold|1978|pages=155–159}} Scenes of Farmer being subjected to this lobotomy procedure were featured in the 1982 film ''[[Frances (film)|Frances]]'',{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=5}} which had initially been planned as an adaptation of ''Shadowland'', though its producers ultimately reneged on their agreement with Arnold.&lt;ref name="shedding"/&gt; During a court case against [[Brooksfilms]] (the film's producers), Arnold revealed that the lobotomy episode and much of his biography about Farmer was "fictionalized".&lt;ref name="shedding"/&gt; Years later, on a [[DVD]] commentary track of the ''Frances'' movie, director [[Graeme Clifford]] stated, "We didn't want to nickel and dime people to death with facts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|title=Frances|year=2002|publisher=Anchor Bay Entertainment|format=DVD|asin= B00005OCK1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farmer's family, her former lovers, and her three ex-husbands all denied, or did not confirm, that the procedure was completed.&lt;ref name="Tmn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Burn All the Liars|url=http://www.themorningnews.org/article/burn-all-the-liars|work=The Morning News|publisher=The Morning News LLC|accessdate=January 4, 2013|last=Evans|first=Matt|date= February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmer's sister, Edith, said the hospital asked her parents' permission to perform the lobotomy, but her father was "horrified" by the notion and threatened legal action "if they tried any of their [[guinea pig]] operations on her."{{Sfn|Bragg|2015|p=80}} Western State Hospital recorded all the lobotomies performed during Farmer's period there. Since a lobotomy was considered a ground-breaking medical procedure, the hospital did not attempt to conceal its work. Although nearly 300 patients received the procedure, no evidence supports a claim that Farmer was among them.&lt;ref name="shedding"/&gt; In 1983, Seattle newspapers interviewed former hospital staff members, including all of the lobotomy ward nurses who were on duty during Farmer's years at Western State, and they all stated Farmer was never a patient on that ward. [[Walter Freeman (neurologist)|Dr. Walter Freeman]]'s private patient records contained no mention of Farmer. Dr. Charles Jones, psychiatric resident at Western State during Farmer's stays, also stated that Farmer never underwent the lobotomy procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagitriverjournal.com/NearbyS-W/NSH/NSH1-Intro.html|title=History of Northern State Hospital, of Sedro-Woolley, Washington Part 1: Introduction and overview|last=Bourasaw|first=Noel V.|date=September 24, 2001|work=Skagit River Journal|accessdate=August 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer Jeffrey Kauffmann published an extensive online essay titled "Shedding Light on ''Shadowland''," which debunks numerous elements of Arnold's book, including the allegation regarding the lobotomy.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=5}}

==In popular culture==
In 1982, [[Jessica Lange]] portrayed Farmer in the feature film ''[[Frances (film)|Frances]]''; the film depicts Farmer undergoing a lobotomy, the validity of which has been disputed in subsequent years.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=217}} The following year, a television adaptation of Farmer's autobiography, ''Will There Really Be a Morning'', was released with [[Susan Blakely]] portraying her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&amp;dat=19830222&amp;id=OfEgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CHQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4698,4086381|title=TV movie about Frances Farmer differs in focus from theater version|last=Rothenberg|first=Fred|date=February 22, 1983|work=The Day|page=24|accessdate=August 26, 2014|via=Google News}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another feature film based on her life, ''Committed'', was produced in 1984.{{sfn|Shelley|2010|p=227}}

In music, she is portrayed in the songs "Ugly Little Dream" (1985) by [[Everything but the Girl]],{{Sfn|Shelley|2010|p=65}} "Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle" (1993) by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]],{{Sfn|Shelley|2010|p=65}} and "Frances Farmer" by [[Drive-By Truckers|Patterson Hood]].{{Sfn|Shelley|2010|p=65}} She was also the subject of a stage play by [[Sally Clark]] titled ''[[List of Canadian plays#S|Saint Frances of Hollywood]]'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/30/theater/reviews/a-rising-stars-startling-flameout.html|title=A Rising Star's Startling Flameout|date=July 30, 2005|author=Hoban, Phoebe|accessdate=August 13, 2018}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francis Dolarhyde''' is a fictional character and a primary antagonist of [[Thomas Harris]]' 1981 novel ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]''.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Dolarhyde is a [[serial killer]] who [[familicide|murders entire families]] by shooting them in their beds. He is nicknamed "The Tooth Fairy" due to the nocturnal nature of his crimes, his tendency to bite his victims' bodies, the uncommon size and sharpness of his teeth and other apparent [[Oral stage|oral fixation]]s. He kills at the behest of an [[Dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]; he refers to [[alter ego|his other self]] as "The Great Red Dragon" after [[William Blake]]'s painting ''[[The Great Red Dragon Paintings|The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed in Sun]]''. He believes that killing people—or "changing" them, as he calls it—allows him to more fully "become" the Dragon.

==Character history==
[[File:reddragon.jpg|thumb|right|''The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed in Sun'' – the painting with which Dolarhyde is obsessed.]]
Dolarhyde's backstory is supplied in the novel in detail and alluded to in the film adaptations. Born in [[Springfield, Missouri]] on June 14, 1938 with a [[cleft lip and palate]], he is abandoned by his mother and cared for in an orphanage until the age of five. He is then taken in by his grandmother, who subjects him to severe emotional and physical [[child abuse|abuse]], culminating in an incident in which she forces him to place his own penis between the blades of a pair of scissors after wetting the bed and threatening to castrate him should he wet the bed again. Shortly afterwards, he begins [[animal cruelty|torturing animals]]. After his grandmother becomes afflicted with [[dementia]], Dolarhyde is turned over to the care of his estranged mother and her husband in St. Louis; he is further abused by this family. After his step-siblings smash his face into a bathroom mirror, Dolarhyde hangs his sister's cat and is sent back to the orphanage. After being caught breaking into a house at age 17, he enlists in the [[United States Army]] rather than serve prison time. While on his tour in Japan and neighboring countries, he learns how to develop film and receives [[cosmetic surgery]] for his cleft palate.

After his honorable discharge, Dolarhyde gets a job with the Gateway Corp. in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], as the production chief of their home movies division. He also takes up [[bodybuilder|bodybuilding]] and becomes exceptionally strong; it is mentioned in the novel that even in middle age, Dolarhyde could have successfully competed in regional bodybuilding competitions, and at one point successfully [[clean and press|cleans and presses]] 300 pounds (which approaches record-setting status for the late 1970s). 

In his early 40s, Dolarhyde sees the William Blake painting ''The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed in Sun'', which gives voice to his alternate personality. Under the influence of "The Red Dragon," Dolarhyde murders two families in two months, on or near a [[full moon]]. (The novel implies that he had killed before that,&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter 35, after Dolarhyde's first sexual encounter with Reba McClain, he is described as a "damned murderer of eleven," more than the number of victims in both families.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps in Asia during his military service.&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter 31:"...he was able to go to Hong Kong twice on leave. Hong Kong and Kowloon could satisfy any appetite in 1959."&lt;/ref&gt;) Dolarhyde chooses his victims through the home movies that he edits as a [[film processing]] technician. In the days leading up to a full moon, Dolarhyde kills or injures the family pet and then spends nights in their backyard, watching the moon. On the night of the full moon, Dolarhyde uses a [[glass cutter]] to gain entry to the homes, then shoots his victims in their beds before ritualistically posing them around the master bed and engaging in [[necrophilia|necrophilic]] acts with the mothers' corpses. He then implants shards of mirror glass into his victims' eyes so he can see his own "transformation" into the Dragon. Dolarhyde believes that he is subjecting his victims to a process called "changing" which is beneficial to them in addition to helping him "become" the Dragon. To facilitate the process of "becoming," Dolarhyde travels to [[Hong Kong]] in order to have a rendering of the Blake dragon tattooed across his back and has two sets of [[dentures|false teeth]] made. One set is normal for his day-to-day life, while the other - based on a mold of his grandmother's deformed teeth - is ritualistically incorporated into the dragon persona he assumes during his killings. Due to the nocturnal nature of the murders and Dolarhyde's tendency to bite the corpses of his victims with the malformed dentures, the tabloid ''The National Tattler'' nicknames him "The Tooth Fairy", a nickname he hates.

[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[offender profiling|profiler]] [[Will Graham (character)|Will Graham]] is asked to return from early retirement to aid in his capture. Graham had previously captured Dr. [[Hannibal Lecter]], a psychiatrist and [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] serial killer whom Dolarhyde idolizes, and to whom he sends a "fan letter" describing his murders. Graham visits Lecter in the Baltimore State Forensic Hospital for the Criminally Insane, hoping that the doctor would be able to help identify the killer or at least assist in creating a psychological profile. Following this meeting, Lecter "helps" by sending Dolarhyde Graham's address in code with the note, "Save yourself - kill them all." FBI Agent-in-Charge [[Jack Crawford (character)|Jack Crawford]] intercepts the message in time to warn Graham's family and the local sheriff.

Dolarhyde becomes obsessed with coverage of his murders in ''The National Tattler'' and collects clippings about Lecter's arrest and trial, about Graham, and about his own murders. In an attempt to provoke Dolarhyde out of hiding, Graham gives an interview to [[Freddy Lounds]] of ''The Tattler'', in which he says that "The Tooth Fairy" is [[erectile dysfunction|impotent]], [[homosexuality|homosexual]], and possibly the product of [[incest]]; he also implies that Lecter is offended that the killer considers himself Lecter's equal. The interview enrages Dolarhyde, who kidnaps Lounds, glues him to an antique wheelchair, intimidates him into recanting his article on tape, and then bites his lips off. Dolarhyde then sets Lounds on fire and rolls him down an incline into ''The Tattler''{{'}}s parking garage.

Meanwhile, Dolarhyde falls in love with a [[blindness|blind]] co-worker named Reba McClane. The relationship initially quells his murderous impulses, but her presence only infuriates the other part of Dolarhyde's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]. Desperate now to retain control of himself, Dolarhyde flies to New York, where he goes to see the original Blake watercolor at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] and devours it, believing that doing so would destroy the Dragon. This plan fails, though, as his ingestion of the painting only makes the Dragon angrier. In a final effort to save McClane, Dolarhyde attempts to kill himself in a motel bathroom by hanging himself from the shower rod, but the noose breaks before he can successfully suffocate.

The FBI and police investigations have so far found little result as the next full moon, and murders, is approaching. Trace evidence has led to dead ends, the killer's partial fingerprint has no match on file, and authorities can find no connection between the families. Eventually Graham realizes that the killer must have had access to the families' home movies, using details from the film to plan entry to the family homes. Both families' film was processed at the same facility. From this fact, police eventually narrow down on Dolarhyde as the suspect.

Now completely under the thrall of the Dragon and aware of the investigation closing in on him, Dolarhyde plans to kill McClane and himself by setting his house on fire with her in it. He relents at the last minute, however, and frees her. Hearing a shotgun blast, McClane feels around Dolarhyde's burning living room and discovers what appears to be his dead body, which is incinerated in the subsequent blaze. However, Dolarhyde actually shot the corpse of a gas station attendant who had earlier offended him by leering at McClane, and whom he had kidnapped in order to stage his own disappearance. Police rescue McClane from the burning house.

Based on McClane's testimony and the male corpse in his house with the face ruined by a shotgun blast, he is believed to have killed himself. However, analysis eventually reveals that the corpse's fingerprints don't match prints at the crime scenes. Dolarhyde travels to Graham's home in Florida, attacks Graham and stabs him in the face. Graham's wife Molly intercepts Dolarhyde, however, and shoots him dead.

==Film adaptations==
[[Image:Francisdolarhydemanhunter.jpg|right|thumb|Tom Noonan as Francis Dolarhyde in ''Manhunter''.]] 
Dolarhyde has been twice portrayed in film adaptations of Harris' novel: by [[Tom Noonan]] in 1986's ''[[Manhunter (film)|Manhunter]]'' (in which he was called "Dollarhyde")&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9a0de3dd1538f936a2575bc0a960948260|title=SCREEN: 'MANHUNTER'|first=Walter|last=Goodman|date=August 15, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Ralph Fiennes]] in 2002's ''[[Red Dragon (2002 film)|Red Dragon]]''.&lt;ref name=NYT2&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9804E1D91F38F937A35753C1A9649C8B63|title=FILM REVIEW; Taking A Bite Out Of Crime|first=Elvis|last=Mitchell|authorlink=Elvis Mitchell|date=October 4, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In deleted scenes in ''Red Dragon'', Dolarhyde's Great Red Dragon personality is voiced by [[Frank Langella]].

==Television adaptation==
On January 13, 2015, [[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]] was cast as Dolarhyde and appeared in season 3 of the television series ''[[Hannibal (TV series)|Hannibal]]'', beginning in episode 8, "The Great Red Dragon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Slezak|url=https://tvline.com/2015/01/13/hannibal-season-3-cast-richard-armitage-dolarhyde/|title=''Hannibal'' Recruits ''The Hobbit'' Star Richard Armitage For Killer Role|website=[[TV Line]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=January 13, 2015|accessdate=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolarhyde was referenced in the series premiere as the unseen murderer of the Marlowe family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|first=Bryan|last=Fuller|user=BryanFuller|url=https://twitter.com/BryanFuller/status/322167756235632641|website=Bryan Fuller's verified Twitter|title=The Marlowe Murders that open the #HANNIBAL Premiere are actually the first murders committed by Francis Dolarhyde, aka, the #REDDRAGON|number=322167756235632641|date=April 10, 2015|accessdate=August 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this continuity, Dolarhyde and Lecter ([[Mads Mikkelsen]]) communicate directly by telephone, and Dolarhyde's inner discussions with the Dragon are instead depicted as therapy sessions with Lecter. In the series finale, "The Wrath of the Lamb", Lecter and Graham ([[Hugh Dancy]]) kill Dolarhyde together; Graham stabs him, while Lecter bites his throat out.

==Inspiration==

Harris loosely based Francis Dolarhyde on the then-unidentified serial killer known as [[Dennis Rader|"BTK" (Bind, Torture, Kill)]], who at the time of the book's publication was terrorizing [[Kansas]] with a series of murders, beginning with the murder of an entire family in their own home. Like Dolarhyde, BTK engaged in [[necrophilia]]c acts with his victims' bodies; he also wrote letters to the police alluding to an abusive childhood and being under the control of an outside influence, which he referred to as "Factor X". Harris had consulted with FBI Agent [[John E. Douglas]] prior to writing the book, and Douglas had served as a consultant on the BTK case for Kansas police. Harris was so impressed with Douglas that he borrowed aspects of his life story and personality for Will Graham and Jack Crawford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Beattie|authorlink=Robert Beattie|title=[[Nightmare in Wichita]]|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|location=London, England|date=2005|ISBN=0451217381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gregory Donovan Ostertag''' (born March 6, 1973) is an American retired professional [[basketball]] player. He spent most of his career with the [[Utah Jazz]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). He played in college at the [[University of Ohio]].

==High school and college==
Ostertag starred at [[Duncanville High School]] in Duncanville, Texas, a suburb of Dallas.  He averaged 22.5 points and 13 rebounds per game during his senior season,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1991_767640/big-guy-concerns-north-shore-duncanville-s-7-2-cen.html Houston Chronicle: "Big Guy Concerns North Shore"]&lt;/ref&gt; and capped the year by leading the Panthers to the 1991 state championship, the first-ever for the school's boys basketball team.

After his successful high school career, Ostertag joined the basketball team at the [[University of Kansas]].  Standing 7-foot-2 and weighing 280 pounds, Ostertag provided a strong presence in the paint, helping the Jayhawks reach the [[NCAA]] [[Final Four]] in 1993.  Statistically, his best season was his junior year (1993–94), when he averaged 10.3 points and 8.8 rebounds per game.  Most impressive, he set a school record by blocking 97 shots that year.  He graduated in 1995 with career totals of 968 points and 770 rebounds, along with 258 blocked shots – the highest total in the history of Kansas and the [[Big 8 Conference]] at that time (since surpassed by [[Jeff Withey]]).

==Professional career==
The [[Utah Jazz]] selected Ostertag with the 28th pick in the first round of the [[1995 NBA draft]]. The Jazz hoped he could fill a void in the team's defense created by the retirement of [[Mark Eaton (basketball)|Mark Eaton]] a few seasons earlier. Ostertag saw limited action in his rookie year, but emerged as Utah's starting center during his second season. The Jazz made back-to-back appearances in the [[NBA Finals]] in 1997 and 1998, with Ostertag providing strong defense in the playoffs against the likes of [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]], [[Tim Duncan]], and [[Shaquille O'Neal]].

Envisioning him as a potentially dominant defender in the future, the Jazz signed Ostertag to a long-term contract extension worth $39 million over six years. However, throughout the remainder of his career, Ostertag struggled with poor physical conditioning and inconsistent play, much to the chagrin of his coaches and teammates. Also, he constantly frustrated Jazz fans with his clumsiness and lack of skill on offense.  
Nevertheless, Ostertag made valuable contributions to the team on the defensive side of the floor, providing size and intimidation in the paint.  He never played full starter-level minutes, thus hindering his overall statistical totals, but he was one of the most efficient shot-blockers in the league during his career. He led the NBA in blocked shot percentage twice (in 2000 and 2002)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/o/ostergr01.html Greg Ostertag Profile at Basketball-Reference.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and was particularly good at gaining possession of the ball after blocking a shot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://82games.com/comm16.htm 82games.com "A study of the value of blocked shots"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ostertag's contract expired in 2004, making him a free agent in the league.  After nine seasons in Utah, he joined the [[Sacramento Kings]]. He played one year in Sacramento, before the Kings sent him back to Utah in a "mega-trade" that involved five teams and 13 players—the largest trade in NBA history.  Ostertag played one final season ([[2005-06 NBA season|2005-06]]) with the Jazz, seeing limited action. He played his final game on April 19—a home contest against the [[Golden State Warriors]]. Having previously announced his retirement, and that game being the last of the season, Ostertag received a standing ovation from Jazz fans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/635201148/Fans-give-Ostertag-a-warm-send-off.html Deseret News: Fans give Ostertag a warm send-off]&lt;/ref&gt;  He played 3:36 in the game, all in the first quarter. Fittingly, he blocked a shot and grabbed a rebound—and missed two free throws. The Jazz won the game, giving the team a final record of 41-41 for the year, ensuring that Ostertag retired having never played for a losing team for his entire NBA career.

In December 2011, Ostertag returned to professional basketball. He signed with the [[Texas Legends]] of the [[NBA Development League]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mavsblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2011/12/former-jazz-center-ostertag-begins-comeb.html Dallas Morning News: Former Jazz center Ostertag begins comeback Thursday at Frisco] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107195658/http://mavsblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2011/12/former-jazz-center-ostertag-begins-comeb.html |date=2012-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after playing 10 games with the Legends, he ended his comeback due to knee injury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/dallas/nba/story/_/id/7480054/former-utah-jazz-big-man-greg-ostertag-abandons-comeback Greg Ostertag scuttles comeback]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Off the court==
In 2002, he donated a [[kidney]] to save the life of his sister Amy (Hall) Ostertag, who was dying of kidney disease; upon his return he became the first player in NBA history to play after donating an organ.&lt;ref name=profile&gt;[http://www.nba.com/playerfile/greg_ostertag/printable_player_files.html Greg Ostertag player profile at NBA.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307122916/http://www.nba.com/playerfile/greg_ostertag/printable_player_files.html |date=2009-03-07 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; He has since been an advocate of [[organ donation]]. 

Ostertag lives on a small cattle farm in [[Mount Vernon, Texas|Mount Vernon]], Texas with his wife Shannon. Together they have one child, daughter Charlestynn (born in 2013). Ostertag also has three children from a previous marriage, son Cody (born in 1993), daughter Bailey (born in 1997), and daughter Shelby (born in 1999).

In 2014, a prominent Los Angeles based street-artist, Ostertag, began using Ostertag's name to promote his art.&lt;ref&gt;http://instagram.com/ostertagmademedoit/&lt;/ref&gt;

Ostertag is the co-founder of The Ostertag Group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theostertaggroup.com/about|title=theostertaggroup|website=theostertaggroup|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, an umbrella company that owns and operates ML Edwards &amp; Co&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mledwardsco.com|title=mledwardsco|website=mledwardsco|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Watermelon Mills Coffeehouse&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.watermelonmills.com|title=watermelonmills|website=watermelonmills|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Ostertag Construction&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ostertagconstruction.com|title=ostertagconstruction|website=ostertagconstruction|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

On July 2, 1790,  Marchant was nominated by President [[George Washington]] to be the first [[United States federal judge|judge]] of the newly created [[United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Created by 1 Stat. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Marchant was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on July 3, 1790, and received his commission the same day, serving until his death in 1796.

'''Jerod Impichch&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;achaaha' Tate''' (born July 25, 1968 in [[Norman, Oklahoma]]) is a [[Chickasaw]] classical composer and pianist.&lt;ref name="gehrke"&gt;[http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/10/24/jaredtate/ Karl Gehrke, "American Indian traditions come to classical music"], Minnesota Public Radio, 26 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; His compositions are inspired by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] history and culture.

He has had several commissioned works, which have been performed by major orchestras in Washington, DC; San Francisco, Detroit, and Minneapolis, among others. When the [[San Francisco Symphony Chorus]] performed and recorded his work ''Iholba' '' in 2008, it was the first time the chorus had sung any work in Chickasaw or any American Indian language.&lt;ref name="oteri"/&gt;

Tate has also worked to develop younger musicians and composers. He is founder and artistic director of the Chickasaw Chamber Music Festival. He was Co-Founder and Composition Instructor for the Chickasaw Summer Arts Academy. He has served as composer-in-residence. Since 2011 he has been an adjunct instructor on the music faculty of [[Oklahoma City University]].

==Biography==
Jerod Sheffer Impichch&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;achaaha' Tate&lt;ref name="kennedynso"/&gt; was born in 1968 in [[Norman, Oklahoma]], and is a citizen of the [[Chickasaw Nation]]. With both parents involved in music, theatre and dance, he grew up immersed in classical music. His Chickasaw father, Charles Tate, is a classically trained pianist and baritone, who played at home as well as in professional performance. Through his paternal grandmother, Jerod Tate is part of the Shawi clan.&lt;ref name="oteri"/&gt; His mother, Dr. Patricia Tate, is of Manx Irish descent.&lt;ref name="oteri"/&gt; She was a professor of dance and a choreographer.&lt;ref name="gehrke"/&gt; His parents recognized and nurtured Jerod's musical talent. His parents were influential in encouraging his work in music, and by accompanying his father to tribal events, Jerod heard much American Indian music among the peoples of Oklahoma.

His Chickasaw middle name, ''Impichch&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;achaaha’'', means “high corncrib.” It is his inherited traditional Chickasaw house name, traditionally used in a manner similar to a European-American surname.&lt;ref name="oteri"/&gt; A corncrib is a small hut used for the storage of corn and other vegetables. In traditional Chickasaw culture, the corncrib was built high off of the ground on stilts to keep its contents safe from foraging animals.&lt;ref name="oteri"/&gt;

Tate received his BM in Piano Performance from [[Northwestern University]], where he studied with Dr. Donald J. Isaak. He received his MM in Piano Performance and Composition from the [[Cleveland Institute of Music]], where he studied with Elizabeth Pastor and Dr. [[Donald Erb]].&lt;ref name="chicktv"&gt;[http://www.chickasaw.tv/arts/list/jerod-tate Jerod Tate Profile and Videos], American Composers Forum, ''Chickasaw Arts and Humanities'', Chickasaw.TV&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before he began his piano studies at the Cleveland Institute of Music, his mother Dr. Patricia Tate commissioned his first composition, asking him for a ballet score. He wrote ''Winter Moons,'' exploring traditions of the tribes from the Northern Plains and Rockies, which premiered at the [[University of Wyoming]] in 1992. He found this was a way to combine American Indian tradition and classical training.&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt; The Colorado Ballet subsequently performed this ballet in 1994 and 1996.

Tate later commented about the experience of composing this work: "I didn't mix my identities of being a classically trained musician and being an American Indian. I never saw that there was even a possible relationship between those two until I started composing. And that's when they came together in a way that made me feel just wonderful."&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt; After this, he returned to the Cleveland Institute of Music and initiated his second major, in composition, in addition to piano studies. He also worked with his father and others to study Chickasaw music more deeply.&lt;ref name="oteri"/&gt;

Tate has said an important influence was Hungarian composer [[Béla Bartók]], ”the first ethnomusicologist that was aware of his own folk music; he did it so naturally and so joyfully that I felt the same impulse to do the same thing from where I come from.”&lt;ref name="oteri"&gt;{{NewMusicBox|id=native-composer-jerod-impichchaachaaha-tate|title=Native Composer: Jerod Impichchaachaaha' Tate|composer=Jerod Impichchaachaaha' Tate|author=[[Frank J. Oteri]]|conducted=October 17, 2008|published=April 1, 2009}} (includes video)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
In 1994 Dr. Bill Burkhardt held a convention in [[Boulder, Colorado]] about and with American Indian composers, who have highlight their innovations in working with traditional instruments and forms within classical music structure. The American Composers Forum, based in Minneapolis and working to support the composition of new music, implemented the First Nations Composers Initiative (FNCI). FNCI has commissioned several works from North American Indian composers. FNCI is no longer active. The American Composers Forum itself has commissioned three large-scale works from Tate.

His works have been commissioned and performed by the National Symphony Orchestra, The San Francisco Symphony and San Francisco Symphony Chorus, The Detroit Symphony, the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, the South Dakota Symphony Orchestra, Colorado Ballet, Canterbury Choral Society, among others.&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt; Tate has said that he works with "sound icons," comparing his use of traditional flutes and drums, to the way that visual artists explore iconic images associated with American Indians: feathers, horses, etc.&lt;ref name="chicktv"/&gt;

In 2007 the San Francisco Symphony and San Francisco Symphony Chorus performed and recorded his ''Tracing Mississippi'' and ''&lt;u&gt;I&lt;/u&gt;holba','' released together in 2008. This was the first time the chorus had sung any work in Chickasaw or in any American Indian language. Tate said they took on the challenge just like learning how to sing in any other language.&lt;ref name="oteri"/&gt;

Tate worked with the noted musician, [[R. Carlos Nakai]], composing ''À Bec Quintet'' (2009), a woodwind quintet for him. Nakai premiered it at the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival.&lt;ref name="digest"/&gt;

In a program on American Indian classical music and composers, [[NPR]] noted that some tribes have funded education programs and other initiatives for young composers.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98884176 Felix Contreras, "American Indian Composers Go Classical"], ''[[All Things Considered]]'', [[NPR]], 1 January 2009, accessed 9 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Tate is among musicians who have developed institutions for the performance and composition of music by American Indians. He is founder and artistic director of the Chickasaw Chamber Music Festival. He was Co-Founder and Composition Instructor for the Chickasaw Summer Arts Academy.

In 2009, Tate conceived, coordinated and implemented the CD project ''Oshtali: Music for String Quartet.'' The album consists of original compositions by his students from the Chickasaw Summer Arts Academy; it is the first professional recording in history of works by young American Indian composers. A second CD recording from the Chickasaw Summer Arts Academy, entitled ''Tobachi,'' was released in 2013. The third CD recording, entitled ''Taloowa' Chokma'si''', was released in 2016. All three recordings were recorded, produced and released on the Grammy Award-winning label, Azica Records.

He has also served as composer-in-residence. In 1997, Tate was Composer-in-Residence for the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts/National Symphony Orchestra American Residency Program in the state of Wyoming.&lt;ref name="kennedynso"&gt;[http://www.zoominfo.com/p/Jared-Tate/576728784 "Jerod Tate"], ZoomInfo, 19 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 and 2005, Tate was Composer-in-Residence for the Grand Canyon Music Festival’s Native American Composer Apprentice Project. In 2007, he was Composer-in-Residence for The Joyce Foundation/American Composers Forum, teaching composition to American Indian high school students in [[Minneapolis]]. In 2011 Tate was selected as Composer-Mentor of the 2012 Essentially Choral program supported by the Jerome Foundation.&lt;ref name="jerome"&gt;[http://www.jeromefdn.org/news/201108/jerod-tates-emmy-award-science-composing "Jerod Tate's Emmy Award for 'The Science of Composing' "], Jerome Foundation, 15 August 2011, accessed 9 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Tate joined the Bass School of Music at [[Oklahoma City University]] as an adjunct instructor of orchestration.&lt;ref name="ocu"&gt;[http://www.okcu.edu/music/faculty-staff/bio/?id=444 "Faculty and Staff"], Music Dept., Oklahoma City University&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In reviewing a performance of ''Iholba’ (The Vision), for Solo Flute, Orchestra and Chorus,'' which was commissioned by the [[National Symphony Orchestra]] and premiered at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, ''The Washington Post'' said, “Tate’s connection to nature and the human experience was quite apparent in this piece...rarer still is his ability to effectively infuse classical music with American Indian nationalism.”{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

'''Levi Yitzchak Schneerson''', (1878-1944), was a [[Chabad|Chabad-Lubavitch]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[rabbi]] in [[Dnipro|Yekatrinoslav]], [[Ukraine]]. He was the father of the seventh and last [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] [[Rebbe]], Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]].

==Biography==
Rabbi Levi Yitzchak was born on the 18th day of Nissan, 5638 (1878) in the town of Podrovnah (near [[Gomel]]) to Rabbi Baruch Schneur and Zelda Rachel Schneerson. His great-great grandfather was the third Chabad Rebbe, Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneersohn]] of [[Lubavitch]].

In 1900, Levi Yitzchak married [[Chana Schneerson|Chana Yanovski]], whose father, Rabbi {{Interlanguage link multi|Meir Shlomo|he|3=מאיר שלמה ינובסקי}}, was the Rabbi of the Ukrainian city of [[Mykolaiv|Nikolaiev]]. In 1902, their eldest son, Menachem Mendel was born. He was later to become the [[Rebbe]] of [[Chabad-Lubavitch|Lubavitch]].

Schneerson lived in Nikolaiev until 1909, when he was appointed to serve as the Rabbi of [[Dnepropetrovsk|Yekatrinoslav]]. In 1939 he was arrested by the [[Bolsheviks|communist]] regime for his fearless stance against the Party's efforts to eradicate Jewish learning and practice in the [[Soviet Union]], and particularly for distributing [[Matzah]] to the Jews of Yekatrinoslav.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/5490/is-matzah-the-key-to-soviet-jews-survival/ "Is Matzah the Key to Soviet Jews Survival."] Jweekly.com.&lt;/ref&gt; After more than a year of torture and interrogations in [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s prisons, he was sentenced to exile to a remote village Chiali in [[Kazakhstan]]. Shortly before his death, Levi Yitzchak was able to move to [[Almaty]], where he was warmly welcomed by the small [[Jews in Kazakhstan|Lubavitcher community]]. There he died on the 20th of Av, 5704 (1944).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2283906/jewish/Rabbi-Levi-Yitzchak-Schneerson.htm "Rabbi Levi Yitzchak Schneerson (1878–1944) The life and legacy of the Rebbe’s father"] chabad.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Levi Yitzchak was buried at a cemetery in Almaty. A Chabad Lubavitch synagogue named in his honour has been built near his gravesite.

Schneerson was a distinguished [[Kabbalah|Kabbalist]]. Some of his writings have been published in a five volume set under the name ''Likkutei Levi Yitschok''. Most of it, however, was burned or confiscated by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities, and has yet to be returned to the Chabad movement.

Initially, the students accepted, but all declined the offer to return later as some of those students were already approached by different entertainment companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://entertain.naver.com/ranking/read?oid=109&amp;aid=0003594500|title=[단독] '아이돌학교' 탈락 8人, 일반반 안간다..엠넷 "가능성 오픈"|last=Kim|first=Eun-ae|date=2017-08-09|website=Naver|access-date=2017-08-14|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4223">'''Los Pepes''', a name derived from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] phrase "'''Pe'''rseguidos por '''P'''ablo '''Es'''cobar"("'''Pe'''rsecuted by '''P'''ablo '''Es'''cobar"), was a short-lived [[vigilante]] group composed of enemies of [[Pablo Escobar]]. They waged a small-scale war against the [[Medellín Cartel]] in the early 1990s, which ended in 1993 following the death of Escobar.

==History==

===Links to authorities===

There are reports that Los Pepes had ties to some members of the [[Colombian National Police]], especially the [[Search Bloc]] (Bloque de Búsqueda), with whom they exchanged information in order to execute their activities against Escobar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/spanish/informes/1998/guerra4A.html |title=human rights watch &amp;#124; colombia ? guerra sin cuartel |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to documents released to the public by the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in 2008, "Colombian National Police director general [[Miguel Antonio Gómez Padilla]] said 'that he had directed a senior CNP intelligence officer to maintain contact with [[Fidel Castaño]], paramilitary leader of Los Pepes, for the purposes of intelligence collection'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB243/index.htm |title=Paramilitaries and the United States: "Unraveling the Pepes Tangled Web" |publisher=Gwu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
After Escobar was shot and killed when fighting against the Search Bloc in 1993, several of their leaders eventually went on to become leaders of a national paramilitary alliance in Colombia, the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia]]  (AUC), a paramilitary death squad that was formed not only for the purpose of fighting the Cartel but also the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC), a Marxist guerrilla group.  The Castaño Brothers ([[Carlos Castaño Gil|Carlos]] 1965–2004, [[Vicente Castaño|Vicente]] and [[Fidel Castaño|Fidel]], who went missing in 1994) were founders of several paramilitary groups and the driving force behind the AUC's creation.

Another member of Los Pepes, Diego Murillo Bejarano aka "[[Don Berna]]", eventually became [[Inspector General]] of the AUC as well as an important drug trafficker with [[The Office of Envigado]].

The [[Institute for Policy Studies]] is searching for details of what connections the CIA and DEA had to Los Pepes. They have launched a lawsuit under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] against the CIA. That suit has resulted in the declassification of thousands of documents from the CIA as well as other U.S. agencies including the Department of State, Drug Enforcement Administration, Defense Intelligence Agency and the U.S Coast Guard. These documents have been made public at the website Pepes Project.&lt;ref&gt;http://pepes.exposed/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/corru/doc/pepes.html |title=Equipo Nizkor - ¿Cuál fue la relación de la DEA y la CIA con Los Pepes? |publisher=Derechos.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depictions==
[[Mark Bowden]]'s book ''[[Killing Pablo]]'' highlights some of the operations of Los Pepes and describes some of the forms of cooperation and support that the group allegedly received from members of the [[Colombian National Police]].

Los Pepes are featured in seasons 2 and 3 of the [[Netflix]] television series ''[[Narcos]]''.

'''Lucas and Marcus Dobre-Mofid''' (born January 28, 1999), collectively known as '''The Dobre Twins''',  are an [[United States|American]] dancing duo and [[YouTubers|YouTube personalities]] who rose to prominence on the now-defunct video application [[Vine (service)|Vine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=These twin brothers dancing in a supermarket are going viral and it’s cause they’re amazing |first=Christina  |last=Pellegrini |work=[[Yahoo!]] |date=October 23, 2016 |accessdate=April 19, 2017 |url=https://www.yahoo.com/style/twin-brothers-dancing-supermarket-going-191646491.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their [[YouTube]] channel has 12 million subscribers. The twins are also part of a YouTube channel called "Dobre Brothers", with their siblings Cyrus and Darius, where they post vlogs two times a week.

== Personal life ==
The twins were born in [[Maryland]] to Romanian Olympic gymnast [[Aurelia Dobre]] and Boz Mofid, the owner of the Dobre Gymnastics Academy in Maryland. They have two older brothers, Cyrus (born 1993) and Darius (born 1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Popular Twin Vloggers Are The Sons Of Former Romanian World Champion Gymnast|first=Dvora |last=Meyers |work=[[Deadspin]] |date=July 21, 2017 |accessdate=July 26, 2017  |url=https://deadspin.com/popular-twin-vloggers-are-the-sons-of-former-romanian-w-1797108750}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Career ==
Lucas and Marcus were known as Vine stars called "TwinBotz". By December 2014, they had gained over 300,000 followers. The twins used the app to showcase their talent, including break dancing, gymnastics, and comedy stunts, such as backflips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Top 100 Most Subscribed YouTube Channels Worldwide • February 2017 |first=Joshua |last=Cohen|work=[[Tubefilter]] |date=March 30, 2017 |accessdate=April 20, 2017 |url=https://www.tubefilter.com/2017/03/30/top-100-most-subscribed-youtube-channels-worldwide-february-2017/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their popularity led them to a collaboration with fellow Vine star Jake Paul. Lucas and Marcus then became two of the original members of Paul's Team 10, increasing their overall popularity on YouTube.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Eventually, the twins became homesick and posted a video titled "The truth about everything..." in which they explained that leaving the team in L.A. and moving back to Maryland was a result of missing family. 

Since leaving, the twins' YouTube channel "Lucas and Marcus" has 12 million subscribers.{{when|date=October 2018}} Their "Dobre Brothers" channel, created June 17, 2017, has 3 million subscribers.{{when|date=June 2018}}

The four brothers, Lucas, Marcus, Cyrus, and Darius then moved back to L.A. Their popularity helped them earn a spot to speak in New York at AT&amp;T's Later Haters expo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=AT&amp;T focuses on teens with ‘Later Haters’ push for digital positivity |first=Ilyse|last=Liffreing|work=[[Digiday]]|date=March 26, 2018|accessdate=March 27, 2018 |url=https://digiday.com/marketing/att-focuses-teens-later-haters-push-digital-positivity/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, it was announced that the Dobre Brothers have signed with [[Creative Artists Agency]] (CAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Social-Media Stars The Dobre Brothers Sign With CAA |first=Todd |last=Spangler|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=March 15, 2018 |accessdate=March 16, 2018 |url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/dobre-brothers-lucas-marcus-caa-1202728053/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marie Perolz''' (7 May 1874 – 12 December 1950) was also known as Mary Perolz and Máire Perolz, and as ''Miss Peroze'' in one crucial document.  She was an advanced Irish nationalist, whose career mirrored that of her husband, James Michael 'Citizen' Flanagan and her friend [[Constance Markievicz]].  She was a member of the radical women's group [[Inghinidhe na hÉireann]] (which in English would mean Daughters of Ireland) and the [[Irish Volunteers]] women's auxiliary [[Cumann na mBan]].

Mary Perolz was born at Limerick on 7 May 1874, the third child of Richard Perolz and Bridget Carter.  Her father and great-grandfather were printers by trade, which informed her literary career.

She joined Inghinidhe na hÉireann at its foundation in 1900.  She was a member of the Provisional Committee led by [[Maud Gonne]] and later Constance Markievicz, and whose members included the Gifford sisters and [[Helena Molony]]. She introduced other women such members of her extended family like [[Rose McNamara]] to the organisation.&lt;ref name="CSO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-1916/1916irl/cpr/cwr/rmcn/|title=Rose McNamara (1885–1957)|publisher=Central Statistics Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was frequently involved in the theatre, and acted the first ever play in Irish staged publicly in Dublin, playing Meadda in December 1902 in ''Eillis agus an Bhean Deirce'' ''(Ellis and the Beggar Woman)'' by playwright [[Peadar Toner Mac Fhionnlaoich]], better known under his pseudonym, Cú Uladh.

Perolz, as her friends called her, taught Irish history and language in classes organised by Inghinidhe na hÉireann for Dublin schoolchildren, conducted by lantern light at night. Marie and Helena Molony were stalwarts of the Liberty Players and National Players with the young actor Captain Sean Connolly, who would die in the [[Easter Rising]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Townshend, "Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion", p.162.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist, actress and revolutionary==

By 1916, Perolz was a committed revolutionary, having joined Cumann na mBan and the syndicalist [[Irish Citizen Army]], of which her friend Constance Markievicz was a leading officer.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Military History (BMH), Witness Statements (WS) (Margaret Keogh).&lt;/ref&gt; She was a friend of [[James Connolly]] and in contact with [[Jim Larkin]], the leaders of the [[Irish Transport and General Workers' Union]]. She worked for the [[Irish Women Workers' Union]] (IWWU), and attended Trade Union Congress meetings at Sligo on its behalf.

Perolz was registered at the official owner of ''Spark'', a weekly socialist newspaper published between February 1915 and April 1916, edited by Markievicz.  At an important public meeting in March 1916, she spoke as Markievicz, who was banned under the [[Defence of the Realm Act 1914]] from making appearances. Perolz read the text of Markievicz's speech and read the exclusion order imposed, and answered the questions of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;McCoole, Sinead, "No Ordinary Women", p.53.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Easter Rising]] Perolz took a vital message from [[Patrick Pearse|Padraic Pearse]] to Waterford,&lt;ref&gt;http://snap.waterfordcoco.ie/collections/ejournals/100704/100704.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Cork, Limerick and Tipperary calling out the troops, and also arranged six other people to carry the same message around the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://mspcsearch.militaryarchives.ie/docs/files//PDF_Pensions/R2/MSP34REF20982MaryMarieFlanagan/WMSP34REF20982MaryMarieFlanagan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As she cycled through Cork she met [[Tomás Mac Curtain]] and [[Terence MacSwiney]] in their broken-down car, on their way to inform volunteers that the Rising was cancelled. On the flyleaf of a pocket book, she was carrying was written the secret message from Pearse: "We go into action at noon today. PHP."  The initialled notepaper took Mac Curtain and MacSwiney by surprise, as they had expected orders to be signed rather than initialled.&lt;ref&gt;The information was provided by the Bureau of Military History interviews. Townshend, p.255.&lt;/ref&gt; She got back to Dublin by Wednesday of Easter Week.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth McCarthy's pension application in Military Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Rising Perolz hid out in Tralee,&lt;ref&gt;Townshend, pp.261–2.&lt;/ref&gt;  but she was betrayed and arrested on 2 May 1916, and brought to [[Dublin Castle]] under escort and imprisoned at [[Mountjoy Jail]]. The charge against her was her 'ownership' of James Connolly's ''Spark'', 'the seditious weekly paper'.&lt;ref&gt;"The Spark" during the period of its circulation was estimated to be 2,382 copies.&lt;/ref&gt; Sedition was a felonious crime, equivalent to treason, and could carry the death penalty. On 5 June, [[John Maxwell (British Army officer)|General Maxwell]] was still awaiting orders for her deportation to England. Constance Markievicz, detained under Defence of the Realm Regulation 14B, was sent to Oxford Jail. [[Kathleen Lynn]] was sent to Bath women's prison. James Connolly's secretary [[Winifred Carney]] went with Marie, [[Helena Molony]], [[Brigid Foley|Brighid Foley]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0398.pdf#page=2&lt;/ref&gt; and Ellen Ryan to Aylesbury Prison.&lt;ref&gt;Mannix Joyce, 'The Story of Limerick and Kerry in 1916', "Capuchin Annual" 1966, pp.339–342.&lt;/ref&gt;  From an initial tally of 73 arrests, these were the only women imprisoned in England after the Rising.&lt;ref&gt;Lil Conlon, ''Cumann na mBan and the Women of Ireland, 1913–1925'', (Kilkenny: Kilkenny People Ltd, 1969), p.23.&lt;/ref&gt;  They finally left Dublin on 20 June 1916. Perolz was sent to serve a sentence at [[Lewes Prison]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Gen. John Maxwell to the Secretary of State for the War Office, 5 June 1916, Class WO141/20. PRO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCoole, Sinead, ''No Ordinary Women'', p.56.&lt;/ref&gt;

On their arrival in England, the women were given seven days to appeal against the sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Notice Regulation Order 14B 1916. Class HO144/1457/314179. PRO.&lt;/ref&gt; The appeals were sent to a judge in the British High Court in London.

Perolz' arrest scandalised her family; several resolved to change their surname to 'Prole', to disassociate themselves from her. After questions in the British parliament and a court appearance, Perolz and Breda Foley were released in July 1916. They were issued with travel warrants and expected to use them to go home to Ireland, landing at [[Dún Laoghaire]].&lt;ref&gt;Class 10 114/1455/313106/0. PRO.  McCoole, op cit., p.56.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately she was made Acting President of the Irish Women Workers' Union in Markievicz's stead.  She travelled to England to greet her friend on her release from Aylesbury Prison on 17 June 1917, and accompanied her back to Ireland.

==Personal life==

Perolz and James Michael Flanagan, a leftist affectionately known as 'Citizen Flanagan', fell in love in 1919 and moved to live at 127 Botanic Road, Glasnevin, Dublin. She continued to work for women's rights in the labour movement. They married in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;http://mspcsearch.militaryarchives.ie/docs/files//PDF_Pensions/R2/24SP910JamesMichaelFlanagan/WDP18721JAMESMICHAELFLANAGAN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; She died on 12 December 1950.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives pension records&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Kurtz''' (December 21, 1925 – October 20, 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://centerforinquiry.net/paul_kurtz_obituary|title=Paul Kurtz, 1925–2012|publisher=Center For Inquiry|date=22 October 2012|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a prominent American [[scientific skeptic]] and [[Secular humanism|secular humanist]]. He has been called "the father of secular humanism".&lt;ref name=POI&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/paul_kurtz_the_new_atheism_and_secular_humanism/ |title= Paul Kurtz – The New Atheism and Secular Humanism |publisher=CFI |date=September 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]], having previously also taught at Vassar, Trinity, and Union colleges, and the New School for Social Research.

Kurtz founded the publishing house [[Prometheus Books]] in 1969. He was also the founder and past chairman of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSI, formerly the ''Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal'', CSICOP), the [[Council for Secular Humanism]], and the [[Center for Inquiry]]. He was editor in chief of ''[[Free Inquiry]]'' magazine, a publication of the Council for Secular Humanism.

He was co-chair of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (IHEU) from 1986 to 1994.&lt;ref name="iheu.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/paul-kurtz-extraordinary-proponent-humanism-1925-2012|title=Paul Kurtz an extraordinary proponent of Humanism, 1925–2012|publisher=International Humanist and Ethical Union|date=22 October 2012|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], Humanist Laureate, president of the [[International Academy of Humanism]] and Honorary Associate of [[Rationalist International]]. As a member of the [[American Humanist Association]], he contributed to the writing of [[Humanist Manifesto II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II | title=Humanist Manifesto II | publisher=American Humanist Association | accessdate=October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an editor of ''[[The Humanist]]'', 1967–78.

Kurtz published over 800 articles or reviews and authored and edited over 50 books. Many of his books have been translated into over 60 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Sandhu, Ranjit |author2=Matt Cravatta.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Media-Graphy: A Bibliography of the Works of Paul Kurtz Fifty-One Years, 1952–2003 |publisher=Amherst, NY: Center for Inquiry, International |year= 2004 |ISBN=978-1-59102-273-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Kurtz was born in Newark, New Jersey, into a [[Jewish]] family,&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.reuters.com/faithworld/2012/10/23/paul-kurtz-leading-advocate-of-secular-humanism-dead-at-86/&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Sara Lasser and Martin Kurtz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9OJSW5dkM8C&amp;pg=PR10|title=Toward a New Enlightenment: The Philosophy of Paul Kurtz|authors=Paul Kurtz, Vern L. Bullough, Timothy J. Madigan|year=1994|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=x|isbn=9781560001188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurtz received his [[bachelor's degree]] from [[New York University]], and the [[Master's degree]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree from [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name="NYTobit"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/nyregion/paul-kurtz-humanist-and-philosopher-dead-at-86.html | title=Paul Kurtz, 86, Humanist Publisher, Dies | publisher=The New York Times | date=October 24, 2012 | accessdate=October 24, 2012 | author=Weber, Bruce | pages=B19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurtz was [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] in his youth, but has said that serving in the [[United States Army]] in [[World War II]] taught him the dangers of ideology. He saw the [[Buchenwald]] and [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] after they were liberated, and became disillusioned with [[Communism]] when he encountered Russian slave laborers who had been taken to [[Nazi Germany]] by force but refused to return to the [[Soviet Union]] at the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Dinitia|title=A Vigorous Skeptic Of Everything but Fact; His Target: The Paranormal on TV and in Film|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/19/arts/vigorous-skeptic-everything-but-fact-his-target-paranormal-tv-film.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secular humanism==
Kurtz was largely responsible for the secularization of humanism.&lt;ref name=POI/&gt; Before Kurtz embraced the term "[[secular humanism]]," which had received wide publicity through fundamentalist Christians in the 1980s, humanism was more widely perceived as a religion (or a [[pseudoreligion]]) that did not include the supernatural. This can be seen in the first article of the original [[Humanist Manifesto]] which refers to "Religious Humanists" and by Charles and Clara Potter's influential 1930 book ''Humanism: A New Religion''.

Kurtz used the publicity generated by fundamentalist preachers to grow the membership of the [[Council for Secular Humanism]], as well as strip the religious aspects found in the earlier humanist movement. He founded the [[Center for Inquiry]] in 1991. There are now some 40 Centers and Communities{{clarify|date=May 2014}}&lt;!--These two capitalized terms really need to be clarified since they have not been mentioned before this.--&gt; worldwide, including in Los Angeles, Washington, New York City, London, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Moscow, Beijing, Hyderabad, Toronto, Dakar, Buenos Aires and Kathmandu.

In 1999 Kurtz was given the International Humanist Award by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]. He had been a board member of IHEU between 1969 and 1994, and in a tribute by former colleague at both [[IHEU]] and the [[Council for Secular Humanism]] Matt Cherry, Kurtz was described as having "had a strong commitment to international humanism – a commitment to humanism beyond US borders never seen matched by another American. He did a lot to expand IHEU as a member of the IHEU Growth and Development Committee (with [[Levi Fragell]] and [[Rationalist International|Rob Tielman]]) and then when he was co-chair, also with Rob and Levi. He always pushed IHEU to be bigger and bolder."&lt;ref name="iheu.org"/&gt;

In 2000 he received the International Rationalist Award by [[Rationalist International]]. In 2001, he debated Christian philosopher [[William Lane Craig]] over the nature of morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|8F6y_6fIjAY|Is Goodness Without God Good Enough?}} October 24, 2001 at Franklin &amp; Marshall College.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=Nathan L. |date=January 16, 2009 |title=Is Goodness without God Good Enough?: A Debate on Faith, Secularism, and Ethics |url= |location= |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers |isbn=978-0742551718 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurtz believed that the nonreligious members of the community should take a positive view on life. [[Religious skepticism]], according to Paul Kurtz, is only one aspect of the secular humanistic outlook. In an interview with [[D.J. Grothe]], he stated that a categorical imperative of secular humanism is "genuine concern for the well-being of other humans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grothe|first1=D.J.|authorlink=D.J. Grothe |title=Paul Kurtz - A Kinder, Gentler Secularism|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/paul_kurtz_a_kinder_gentler_secularism/|website=Point of Inquiry|publisher=Center for Inquiry|accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Council of Secular Humanism's Los Angeles conference (7–10 October 2010), tension over the future of humanism was on display as Kurtz urged a more accommodationist approach to religion while his successors argued for a more adversarial approach.&lt;ref&gt;See the ''LA Times'' article reviewing the exchange titled [http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/10/local/la-me-humanists-20101010 "Religious Skeptics Disagree on How Aggressively to Challenge the Devout"]. For the LA conference in question, see http://www.secularhumanism.org/laconference {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915155904/http://secularhumanism.org/laconference/ |date=2010-09-15 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 18, 2010, he resigned from all these positions.&lt;ref&gt;See his [http://paulkurtz.net/apologia.html open letter of resignation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529042751/http://paulkurtz.net/apologia.html |date=2010-05-29 }} on his personal website.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Center for Inquiry accepted his resignation as chairman emeritus, board member, and as editor in chief of ''[[Free Inquiry]]'' as being the culmination of a years-long "leadership transition", thanking him "for his decades of service" while also alluding to "concerns about Dr. Kurtz's day-to-day management of the organization".&lt;ref&gt;Center for Inquiry. "[http://www.centerforinquiry.net/news/center_for_inquiry_board_statement CFI Board accepts Paul Kurtz's resignation]." Center for Inquiry. 18 May [[2010 in literature|2010]]. (accessed May 18, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Kurtz renewed his efforts in organized humanism by founding The [[Institute for Science and Human Values]] and its journal ''The Human Prospect: A NeoHumanist Perspective'' in June 2010.

==Critique of the paranormal==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Schizophrenia]] --&gt;
[[Image:Ken-RayPaulRandiKen photo at TAM8.jpg|thumb|350px|left|[[Ray Hyman]], Paul Kurtz, [[James Randi]], and [[Kendrick Frazier|Ken Frazier]] at TAM8, July 2010, Las Vegas, after their session on the history of the modern skeptical movement]]

Another aspect in Kurtz's legacy is his critique of the [[paranormal]]. In 1976, CSICOP started ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', its official journal. Like [[Martin Gardner]], [[Carl Sagan]], [[Isaac Asimov]], [[James Randi]], [[Ray Hyman]] and others, Kurtz has popularized [[scientific skepticism]] and [[critical thinking]] about claims of the paranormal.

Concerning the founding of the modern skeptical movement, Ray Hyman states that in 1972, he, along with James Randi and Martin Gardner, wanted to form a skeptical group called S.I.R. (Sanity In Research). The three of them felt they had no administration experience, saying "we just had good ideas", and were soon joined by [[Marcello Truzzi]] who provided structure for the group. Truzzi involved Paul Kurtz and they together formed [[CSICOP]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2olEw13NxUs|title=Ray Hyman – The Life of an Expert Skeptic, Part 2 – For Good Reason|publisher=[[JREF]]|date=2012-01-20 |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hyman|authorlink=Ray Hyman|first=Ray|title=IIG Award:Ray Hyman 2011|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrK7l_EwdBQ|accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurtz wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[An] explanation for the persistence of the paranormal, I submit, is due to the transcendental temptation. In my book by that name, I present the thesis that paranormal and religious phenomena have similar functions in human experience; they are expressions of a tendency to accept [[magical thinking]]. This temptation has such profound roots within human experience and culture that it constantly reasserts itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/si/2001-07/kurtz.html Quarter Century of Skeptical Inquiry, Paul Kurtz (Skeptical Inquirer July 2001)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305043319/http://csicop.org/si/2001-07/kurtz.html |date=2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''The Transcendental Temptation'', Kurtz analyzes how provable are the claims of [[Jesus]], [[Moses]], and [[Muhammad]], as well as the founders of religions on American soil such as [[Joseph Smith]] and [[Ellen White]]. He also evaluates the activities of the most famous modern [[psychic]]s and what he believes are the fruitless researches of [[Parapsychology|parapsychologists]]. ''The Transcendental Temptation'' is considered among Kurtz's most influential writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.csicop.org/list/listarchive/msg00214.html |title = Paul Kurtz to Receive Award From Univ.of Buffalo |author = Barry Karr |authorlink= Barry Karr|website = www.csicop.org |date =2001-05-11 |access-date = 2016-06-02 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20010914060726/http://www.csicop.org/list/listarchive/msg00214.html |archive-date = 2001-09-14 |dead-url = true
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He promoted what he called "Skepticism of the Third Kind," in which skeptics actively investigate claims of the paranormal, rather than just question them. He saw this type of skepticism as distinct from the "first kind" of extreme [[philosophical skepticism]], which questions the possibility that anything can be known, as well as the "second kind" of skepticism, which accepts that knowledge of the real world is possible but is still largely a philosophical exercise.&lt;ref name="POI1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/paul_kurtz_skepticism_of_the_third_kind/ | title=Paul Kurtz - Skepticism of the Third Kind | publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]] | work=[[Point of Inquiry]] Podcast | date=10 March 2006 | accessdate=17 January 2014 | author=Grothe, DJ | authorlink= D. J. Grothe }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 April 2007, Kurtz appeared on [[Penn &amp; Teller]]'s television show ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|Bullshit!]]'' arguing that [[exorcism]] and [[Satanism|Satanic cult]]s are merely "hype and paranoia".&lt;ref name="PandT"&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/episodes.do?episodeid=127162&amp;ep=505 |title = Episode 5:  Exorcism |work = [[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|Bullshit!]] |publisher = Showtime.com |date = 19 April 2007 |accessdate = 2007-05-22 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070425093939/http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/prevepisodes.do?episodeid=s5%2Fexorcism |archivedate = 2007-04-25 |deadurl = yes |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eupraxsophy===&lt;!-- 'Eupraxsophy' redirects here --&gt;
Kurtz coined the term eupraxsophy (originally ''eupraxophy'') to refer to philosophies or life stances such as [[secular humanism]] and [[Confucianism]] that do not rely on belief in the transcendent or supernatural. A ''eupraxsophy'' is a [[irreligion|nonreligious]] life stance or [[worldview]] emphasizing the importance of living an [[ethical]] and exuberant life, and relying on [[Rationality|rational]] methods such as [[logic]], [[observation]] and [[science]] (rather than [[faith]], [[mysticism]] or [[revelation]]) toward that end. The word is based on the Greek words for "good", "practice", and "wisdom". Eupraxsophies, like religions, are cosmic in their outlook but eschew the supernatural component of religion, avoiding the "transcendental temptation," as Kurtz puts it. Although critical of supernatural religion, he has attempted to develop affirmative ethical values of naturalistic humanism.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, Bill. ''Dictionary of Atheism, Skepticism, &amp; Humanism'', Prometheus Books, 2006, page 175. "Eupraxsophy stands for 'a set of convictions and practices offering a cosmic outlook and an ethical guide to life'."&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Paul Kurtz Lecture Series===
In June 2010, the [[University at Buffalo|State University of New York at Buffalo]] announced the establishment of the Paul Kurtz Lecture Series. The series will bring notable speakers to the University's campus in Amherst, New York, to speak on topics relevant to the philosophy of humanism and philosophical naturalism. Kurtz had made the bequest and charitable gift annuity to the University, where he taught from 1965 to 1991, to help promote the development of critical intelligence in future generations of SUNY at Buffalo students. On November 5, 2010, the University announced that cognitive scientist [[Steven Pinker]] would inaugurate the new Paul Kurtz Lecture Series on December 2, 2010.

===Institute for Science and Human Values===
Paul Kurtz conceived of the ''Institute for Science and Human Values'' in 2009 as yet another branch of the umbrella group, the Center for Inquiry. Upon his resignation from the Center for Inquiry he launched the Institute for Science and Human Values as a separate entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board Members|url=http://www.instituteforscienceandhumanvalues.net/organization.htm|publisher=ISHV|accessdate=2012-10-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018084429/http://www.instituteforscienceandhumanvalues.net/organization.htm|archivedate=2012-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oppenheimer|first=Mark|title=Closer Look at Rift Between Humanists Reveals Deeper Divisions|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/02/us/02beliefs.html|accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In ISHV's first press release Kurtz said ISHV hoped to "rehumanize secularism" and "find out how to better develop the common moral virtues that we share as human beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulkurtz.net/events.htm |title=Apologia |publisher=Paulkurtz.net |date= |accessdate=2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurtz was editor-in-chief of ISHV's journal, ''The Human Prospect: A NeoHumanist Perspective''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehumanprospect.com{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
The [[asteroid]] [[6629 Kurtz]] was named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=6629+Kurtz |title=6629 Kurtz (1982 UP) |publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting of the executive council of CSI in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]] in April 2011, Kurtz was selected for inclusion in CSI's Pantheon of Skeptics.  The Pantheon of Skeptics was created by CSI to remember the legacy of deceased fellows of CSI and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pantheon of Skeptics|url=http://www.csicop.org/about/the_pantheon_of_skeptics|website=CSI|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|accessdate=30 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131054129/http://www.csicop.org/about/the_pantheon_of_skeptics|archivedate=31 January 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career: 1980–84===
Paul Oakenfold describes his early life as a "bedroom DJ" in a podcasted interview with [[Vancouver]]'s ''24 Hours'', stating he grew up listening to [[The Beatles]].

Oakenfold's musical career began in the late 1970s, when he met Trevor Fung and 
began helping him DJ [[soul music]] in a [[Covent Garden]] wine bar. Here in [[London]], he also met Rumours where he played [[Earth, Wind and Fire]] and popular [[United Kingdom|British]] bands.&lt;ref name="Paul Oakenfold Goes Hollywood"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pauloakenfold/articles/story/5932383/paul_oakenfold_goes_hollywood |title=Paul Oakenfold Goes Hollywood |accessdate=2008-06-11 |work=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

In 1981, 18-year-old Oakenfold and his friend Ian Paul moved to [[New York City]]. Oakenfold worked as a courier in West [[Harlem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Paul-Oakenfold-Biography/887820CD0D81734B48256C3200095A8C|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214012234/http://sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Paul-Oakenfold-Biography/887820CD0D81734B48256C3200095A8C|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 February 2009|title=PAUL OAKENFOLD BIOGRAPHY|date=14 February 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] was overtaking dance music as the most popular sound in the area (see [[1984 in music]]). Oakenfold and Paul used fake identification&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ministryofsound.com/News/Features/20071108_oakenfold1.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112103400/http://www.ministryofsound.com/News/Features/20071108_oakenfold1.htm|archivedate=12 November 2007|title=Oakenfold – Blagging it at Studio 54, Extract from ''Paul Oakenfold: The Authorised Biography'' |accessdate=2008-06-11 |publisher=Ministry of Sound}}&lt;/ref&gt; to sneak into various dance clubs, like Studio 54, where they met members of the band [[Maze (band)|Maze]], [[Bobby Womack]] and [[Bob Marley]], whom they also interviewed, claiming to be ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Melody Maker]]'' journalists.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Returning  to London, Oakenfold began breaking into the mainstream, as an [[A&amp;R]] man for [[Champion Records]]. At that time, he signed [[DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince]], as well as [[Salt-n-Pepa]]. Oakenfold appeared on the ''[[Blue Peter]]'' [[BBC]] programme for children with a breakdancing crew. He became a promoter and British agent for the [[Beastie Boys]] and [[Run-D.M.C.]]. Since then, he appeared at The Project in [[Streatham]] playing soul and [[jazz]] music.&lt;ref name="pobio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Paul-Oakenfold-Biography/887820CD0D81734B48256C3200095A8C |title=Paul Oakenfold Biography |accessdate=2008-06-10 |publisher=Sing 365 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429072412/http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Paul-Oakenfold-Biography/887820CD0D81734B48256C3200095A8C |archivedate=29 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://music.yahoo.com/ar-288173-bio--Paul-Oakenfold |title=Paul Oakenfold Biography |accessdate=2008-06-10 |publisher=Yahoo Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perfecto Records and fame: 1985–91===
{{Main|Perfecto Records}}
In 1987, Oakenfold travelled to the island of [[Ibiza]] for a week to celebrate his birthday. Trevor Fung, Nicky Holloway, Ian Saint Paul, Danny Rampling and Johnny Walker accompanied him. Oakenfold convinced the owner of a venue in England to host an "Ibiza Reunion" party after-hours. He had previously made an attempt, but it failed as the crowd was not prepared for the [[acid house]] style until 1987 when the party was successful. After that, the night became a classic and became one of the UK's major acid house nights, known as ''Spectrum'' at [[Heaven (nightclub)]] in [[Charing Cross]]. The party was best known for the "Theatre of Madness", as more than 1,500 people were present on Monday nights, until it went down; with the financial issues it changed its name to the "Land of Oz". Artists like [[Alex Paterson]] DJ'd in the VIP [[chillout]] area known as the "White Room", which gave Oakenfold more free time, and then he began producing music under the alias "[[Electra (band)|Electra]]" in 1988. Members included Nick Divaris, [[John Rocca|John "Johnny" Rocca]] and Micky. Also in 1988 he decided to create a place where new artists could develop their careers. At that moment, [[Perfecto Records]] was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perfectorecords.com/ |title=About Perfecto |accessdate=2008-06-10 |publisher=Perfecto Records}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He collaborated with his friend [[Steve Osborne]]&lt;ref name="pobio" /&gt; on various projects. In 1990, he worked with Terry Farley, [[Andrew Weatherall]] and Osborne on two remixes for [[Happy Mondays]]. The remixes of "Rave On" and "Hallelujah" were released on the ''Madchester Rave On'' EP, as well as "Step On", a covered version adapted from [[John Kongos]]' 1971 hit "He's Gonna Step On You". The song reached the Top 5 position in the UK.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} He was invited as a guest DJ to Spike Island, a [[gig (musical performance)|gig]] with [[The Stone Roses]]. Pleased with the last single, the Happy Mondays gave Oakenfold and Osborne the opportunity to produce their third studio album, ''[[Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/release/161904 |title=Happy Mondays – Pills 'N Thrills And Bellyaches |accessdate=2008-06-10 |publisher=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album entered the UK charts at #1 with pre-sales of 150,000. The album was named [[NME]]'s "1990 Album of The Year", and both Oakenfold and Osborne won the 1991 [[Brit Award]] for "Best Producer".&lt;ref name="thrillscom"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pills-n-thrills.com/happy-mondays-biography.html |title=Happy Mondays – Pills 'N Thrills And Bellyaches |accessdate=2008-06-10 |publisher=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|This is a tremendous record and a gauntlet chucked at all the other would-be legends in town... Wild, brash, corrosive funk rock, grimly northern and yet pan-cultural in a Tesco shoplifter kind of way.|||says [[NME]] in a 9 out of 10 review.&lt;ref name="thrillscom" /&gt;}}

As they continued releasing only four singles as [[Electra (band)|Electra]], in Full Frequency Range Recordings (FFRR) founded and run by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1's]] [[Pete Tong]], the duo created a new alias under the name Perfecto. They remixed [[Massive Attack]]'s "Safe From Harm" as well as many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Perfecto |title=Perfecto |accessdate=2008-06-10 |publisher=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grace (band)|Grace]] was formed in the late 1990s, consisting of Oakenfold and Osborne and various singers, including jazz singer [[Dominique Atkins]] and Patti Low.

===Tours and nightclubs: 1992–2000===

In 1992, when [[U2]] released their song "[[Even Better Than the Real Thing]]", the Perfecto remix reached a higher charted position than the original song. In 1993 with the success of his last remix as Perfecto, he was hired by [[U2]] to provide the warm-up sonics to their [[Zoo TV]] world tour, and replaced [[BP Fallon]] on the 1993 legs in [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Japan]], with more than fifty shows in Zooropa '93 and Zoomerang from 7 May to 10 December of the same year.

In September 1994 and again in 1998 he teamed up with [[Steve Osborne]] and [[Ben Hillier]] to remix the [[Rolling Stones]]'s song [[You Got Me Rocking]] and [[Duran Duran]]'s song [[Out of My Mind (Duran Duran song)|Out Of My Mind]]. He began producing his own tracks as well, continuing to remix songs from popular artists.  He began using [[Goa music]], something he discovered on the beaches of [[Goa]] in [[India]], fusing it with similar-sounding European tracks to create his own distinct sound. He took this to the mainstream in 1994 and created a pair of two-hour sets for [[BBC Radio 1]]'s ''[[Essential Mix]]'' the first of these was broadcast in the early hours of Sunday 20 March 1994, with the second being the legendary "Goa Mix" broadcast on Sunday 18 December 1994.  In 1995, he became the first DJ to play on the main stage at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] for 90,000 people, which he considers his favorite [[gig (musical performance)|gig]].&lt;ref name="ministry"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ministryofsound.com/news/features/20071108_oakenfoldinterview |title=Paul Oakenfold Interview |accessdate=2008-06-11 |publisher=Ministry of Sound |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109095946/http://www.ministryofsound.com/news/features/20071108_oakenfoldinterview |archivedate=9 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His album ''[[Perfecto Fluoro (Paul Oakenfold album)|Perfecto Fluoro]]'' became the #1 essential dance collection of Boston Beat during 1996 with [[Jamiroquai]]'s ''[[Travelling Without Moving]]''.&lt;ref name="pobio" /&gt; The group Grace dissolved in 1997 as Oakenfold was touring as a performance DJ more frequently and could not commit to recording.

On 9 June 1997 Oakenfold created ''[[GU004|Global Underground 004: Paul Oakenfold, Live in Oslo]]'' (GU004) which is a double mix CD in the [[Global Underground]] series, compiled and mixed by Oakenfold; it is the first work he created for GU. The mix was recorded live at Cosmopolite Club in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], as part of the official launch of the [[Quart Festival]]. It showcases Oakenfold's eclectic taste in music at the time, as the mix combines various forms of dance music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/release/36480 |title=Paul Oakenfold – Global Underground: Live In Oslo |accessdate=2008-06-11 |publisher=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Oakenfold mixed one disc of the double album ''[[Fantazia Presents the House Collection 6]]'', a UK [[house music]] compilation series. Oakenfold became Cream's resident DJ from 1997 – 1999. During this time, he began to concentrate on the release of ''[[Tranceport (album)|Tranceport]]'' in 1998.

In 1998 and 1999, Oakenfold took the first place in "DJmag's Top 100 DJs". With the two-year contract as a resident in [[Liverpool]]'s Cream, it was in 1999 that he released ''[[Resident. Two Years of Oakenfold at Cream.]]'' on [[Virgin Records|Virgin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Resident-Two-Years-Oakenfold-Cream/dp/B00000ILM2 |title=Resident: Two Years of Oakenfold at Cream

The compilation was released on 25 May 1998, with the US release on 19 January 1999. This was the second production from Oakenfold with GU and it contained trance, [[drum and bass]], progressive house, progressive trance, [[breakbeat]] and [[Downtempo]]. This became his last work with GU.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In 1999, he moved to the United States where he went on tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/oakenfold_paul/bio.jhtml |title=Paul Oakenfold |accessdate=2008-06-10 |publisher=VH1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, he created fourteen tracks of jazz, soul, house and goa based styles with Mitchell Oakenfold. Twenty-four ''[[audio signal processing|FX]] and scratches'' loops and sounds were included too, each consisting of six seconds; the album cover says ''"Only for DJs and Producers"'' and was released on Music of Life.

In March 2000 he teamed up with [[Steve Osborne]], [[Andy Gray (musician)|Andy Gray]] and [[Bruno Ellingham]] to remix [[Moby]]'s song [[Natural Blues]]. He produced a [[Trance (music)|Trance]] remix.

Sometime before July 2000, he teamed up with [[Andy Gray (musician)|Andy Gray]] to write and produce the theme for the [[Channel 4]] reality show ''[[Big Brother (UK TV series)|Big Brother]]'' under the name [[Elementfour]]. The series started airing on 18 July 2000. The programme and theme have since moved over to [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] since 18 August 2011.

In September 2000 he opened the new [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|Digital Radio]] station [[Ministry of Sound Radio]] with a live mix from the famous London club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pearlman |first=Julia |url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/470243/ministry-sound-debuts-cdquality-radio-station-realnetworks-radiopass/ |title=Ministry of Sound debuts CD-quality radio station on RealNetworks RadioPass - Brand Republic News |publisher=Brandrepublic.com |date=2005-04-13 |accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pioneer in America: 2000–01===
{{Main|Fresno|Area Festival|Swordfish (soundtrack)}}
After his success in Europe, one of Oakenfold's first major events in America was [[Fresno, California]]'s [[Cyberfest]] on 22 July 2000. The 500 acre indoor and outdoor central California location had the biggest dance capacity ever in America. An estimated 80,000 dancers and music lovers from [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], and [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] were welcomed that day. Cyberfest 2000, also known as the "Festival Of The Future" featured other DJs such as [[Chemical Brothers]], [[Brian Transeau|BT]], and [[Carl Cox]]. Cyberfest 2000 paved the way for other major events in the area such as the [[Electric Daisy Carnival]] in Los Angeles in 2010.

In 2001, Oakenfold took part in the first [[Area Festival]] tour. This tour featured [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[Carl Cox]], [[The Orb]], [[OutKast]], and [[The Roots]]. He later released a new [[compilation album]], ''[[Perfecto Presents Ibiza|Perfecto Presents: Ibiza]]''.

2001 also saw the release of the video game ''[[Frequency (video game)|Frequency]]'', for which Oakenfold produced one track, "See It".

[[Global Underground]] sold over 150,000 copies of Oakenfold's previous ''Global Underground: New York''. A spokesperson for the label claimed that in the US, demand for UK dance music had been increasing in the past couple of years, and now made up over two-thirds of the label's sales. The Global Underground New York office opened in on [[Ninth Avenue (Manhattan)|Ninth Avenue]] in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/paul-oakenfold/7788 |title=Boxed Takes Bite of Big Apple |accessdate=2008-06-11 |publisher=NME}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mekka Electronic Music Festival, otherwise known as the "electronic [[Lollapallooza]]" took place in ten cities in the US and [[Canada]] during August and September, including [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Toronto]] and [[San Francisco]].

Most of the tracks are collaborations with [[Andy Gray (musician)|Andy Gray]], the remix of [[N.E.R.D.]]'s "Lapdance" which gained total notability from other tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,1143070,00.html |title=Swordfish: The Album |accessdate=2008-06-10 |publisher=Artist Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soundtrack was produced under [[Village Roadshow]] and [[Warner Bros.]] and distributed through [[London-Sire Records]].

Oakenfold recorded a track with [[Crazy Town]] vocalist [[Shifty Shellshock]] at the end of the year for his new album. In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Shellshock said that the track known as "[[Starry Eyed Surprise]]" was created after the pair met at a Crazy Town show.&lt;ref name="starryeyed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/paul-oakenfold/8721 |title=Oakenfold's Cray 'Starry-Eyed' Sensation |accessdate=2008-06-11 |publisher=NME}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bunkka: 2002–04===
{{Main|Bunkka|Creamfields}}
In 2002, ''[[Bunkka]]'' became his first official studio album when he signed to [[Maverick Records|Maverick]]. The name ''Bunkka'' came from [[Peter Gabriel]]'s studio in the UK, where the album was recorded. An extended play was released featuring live versions of four songs under Peoplesound Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/release/471930 |title=Oakenfold – Bunkka (Live) |accessdate=2008-06-11 |publisher=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also Oakenfold's best selling album to date, with sales largely exceeding 1,000,000 (1 million) copies worldwide.

{{cquote|For the past 10 years I've been creating music under various different names, but I was never comfortable with putting out an Oakenfold record...

"I'd always wanted to do something that represented my own musical background... I grew up on pop music, I love guitar bands and I was very influenced and involved in hip-hop during the early days, so I wanted to build from those roots upwards rather than doing a contemporary dance record."|source=— &lt;small&gt;said Paul Oakenfold on several interviews.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="pobio" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/paul-oakenfold/9801 |title=Oakey Ropes In Some Blokies! |accessdate=2008-06-11 |publisher=NME}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The album features vocals from Jane's Addiction vocalist [[Perry Farrell]] on "Time of Your Life" and [[Shifty Shellshock]] of Los Angeles rock and rap band [[Crazy Town]] on "[[Starry Eyed Surprise]]"; [[Ice Cube]] on "Get Em Up"; and [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]] and [[Nelly Furtado]] on "The Harder They Come". The album contains appearances by [[Ashley Walters (actor)|Asher D]] of [[So Solid Crew]] on "[[Southern Sun/Ready Steady Go|Ready Steady Go]]", and [[Grant Lee Philips|Grant-Lee Philips]], founder of the 90's Los Angeles rock band [[Grant Lee Buffalo]] is also included with [[Carmen Rizzo]]'s version of his song "Motion".

In an earlier episode, "The Imposter", of [[Radio Free Roscoe]], a 2005 series on [[The N]], a character Travis Strong DJed to the song, acting as if it were his own. It has more recently been used in the film adaptation ([[Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker]]) of [[Anthony Horowitz]]'s novel [[Stormbreaker (novel)|Stormbreaker]], [[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]] and it was reproduced with [[Korean language|Korean]] lyrics for the film ''[[Collateral (film)|Collateral]]'', the song has also been used during the performances of extreme freestyle water ski jumpers, the song later became the theme song for the TV Show [[TRL Italy]] since 2003 until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Paul+Oakenfold |title=Paul Oakenfold |accessdate=2008-06-11 |publisher=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; An EP of "The Harder They Come" was released on Perfecto and featured other works from Oakenfold and other artists.

In 2005, Oakenfold was contacted by the car manufacturer [[Toyota]] to create a free promotional CD available from [[aygo]].com to promote a new Toyota car. The CD contained only seven songs which he worked on with Ian Green; the album was entitled ''Feed Your Mind''.

{{cquote|I think the [[Hollywood Bowl]] was the most memorable experience. It's a very unique venue that never had a DJ play there before me. The likes of [[Frank Sinatra]] and the [[Beatles]] had performed there so it's a truly magnificent place – it holds about 15,000 – and it was a big achievement for me as much as Wembley and the Great Wall because it had never been done. After seeing that gig, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s management were there and asked me to be the opening act for her on her 2006 tour, which also added to the experience!|||said Oakenfold in a [[Ministry of Sound]] interview.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="ministry" /&gt;}}

During Oakenfold's career he has remixed a variety of songs from [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], like "[[What It Feels Like for a Girl]]", "[[Hollywood (Madonna song)|Hollywood]]", "[[American Life (song)|American Life]]", "[[Sorry (Madonna song)|Sorry]]" and later in 2008 "[[Give It 2 Me (Madonna song)|Give It 2 Me]]" from her album ''[[Hard Candy (Madonna album)|Hard Candy]]'', Oakenfold went on tour with Madonna for two months opening her presentation in the [[Confessions Tour]], previously he had supported her in 2004 at [[Slane Castle]] in [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twopandas.com/paul-oakenfold-madonna |title=Paul Oakenfold supports Madonna on her tour |accessdate=2008-06-12 |publisher=Two Pandas |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512073322/http://www.twopandas.com/paul-oakenfold-madonna |archivedate=12 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His sets lasted for an hour and a half, followed by Madonna's two-hour show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kittyradio.com/soapbox/jukebox/8487-madonna-tour-info-stadiums-get-new-look-stage.html |title=Madonna Tour info: Stadiums to get new look stage |accessdate=2008-06-12 |publisher=Kitty Radio |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617011310/http://kittyradio.com/soapbox/jukebox/8487-madonna-tour-info-stadiums-get-new-look-stage.html |archivedate=17 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Receiving unsuccessful reviews, the first single "[[Faster Kill Pussycat]]", a collaboration with the actress [[Brittany Murphy]], was released on 2 May 2006; the second single was "[[Sex 'n' Money]]".

'''Pavlos Kouroupis''' (Greek: Παύλος Κουρούπης) was a [[Greece|Greek]] soldier born in 1929 in [[Kalamata]].

==Biography==
Kouroupis was an officer in the [[Hellenic Army]], at the time of the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974, he was a Lt. Colonel and CO of the 251st Battalion of the [[Cypriot National Guard]], the unit closest to the Turkish landing site. With his unit, he opposed the Turkish army at the [[Battle of Pentemili beachhead]], stalling its advance for two days. He was forced to retreat before vastly superior Turkish numbers. He was presumed dead during the defence of [[Keryneia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7900">'''Richard Alexander''' is an [[Indiana]] man wrongfully convicted of [[rape]] and later exonerated by [[DNA profiling|DNA evidence]].

== Arrest and conviction ==
In 1996 a suspected [[Serial rape|serial rapist]] dubbed by local media the "River Park Rapist" preyed on female residents of [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]], [[Indiana]]. Police arrested Richard Alexander (then 30 years old) in August 1996 for four of the rapes, largely on the basis of the statements of the victims.

[[DNA]] evidence definitively excluded him as a suspect in one of the [[rape]]s, although both the victim and her fiancé continued to insist that Alexander was the perpetrator.&lt;ref name="ip"&gt;[http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/48.php "Richard Alexander"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812021712/http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/48.php |date=August 12, 2010 }}. ''The [[Innocence Project]]''. Retrieved December 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all of the investigators were convinced of his guilt, particularly as three similar rapes occurred while Alexander was in police custody.&lt;ref name="fof"&gt;Newton, M. (2004) ''The Encyclopedia of High-Tech Crime and Crime-Fighting''. [[Checkmark Books]], an imprint of [[Facts on File, Inc.]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of one of the rapes that took place while he was in custody, Alexander's picture was accidentally placed in a photo-lineup shown to the victim. She selected his photograph as that of her assailant, despite his incarceration at the time of the offense.&lt;ref name="ip"/&gt;

Nevertheless, Alexander was prosecuted for the three rapes, with charges totaling two counts of [[robbery]], two counts of criminal deviate conduct, two counts of attempted rape, confinement, attempted robbery, rape, [[burglary]] and [[auto theft]].&lt;ref name="ip"/&gt; His 1997 trial ended in a [[hung jury]], with two of the three black jurors voting with the nine white jurors for conviction. He was re-tried for the crimes in 1998 by an all-white jury. At the second trial, one of the victims, though identifying Alexander as her assailant, asserted that he had a hairless chest without [[tattoo]]s. When it was demonstrated that Alexander had a hairy, heavily tattooed chest, he was acquitted of that rape.&lt;ref name="ip"/&gt; Nevertheless, he was convicted of the other two and was sentenced to seventy years in prison.&lt;ref name="fof"/&gt;

== Exoneration ==
In 2001, with Alexander already having served five years in prison, an alleged burglar and [[Child sexual abuse|child molester]] named Michael Murphy confessed to one of the two rapes of which Alexander had been convicted, knowing details only the true assailant would know.&lt;ref name="ip"/&gt; With this revelation, a judge ordered a new round of DNA testing in Alexander's case. Hairs found at the scene of the rape were submitted to [[Genetic fingerprinting#Mitochondrial analysis|mitochondrial DNA testing]].&lt;ref&gt;Cultice, C. [https://web.archive.org/web/20040207221847/http://www.export.gov/comm_svc/press_room/news/articles/reliagene_1003.html "Who Dunnit?: DNA Testing Exporter Helps Make the Case (or Not)"] . United States Government, [http://www.export.gov/ Export Portal]. Retrieved December 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Alexander's original conviction, such testing was not available in the state of [[Indiana]]. The tests proved that the DNA did not match Alexander's profile, but did match Murphy's.&lt;ref name="ip"/&gt;

Because of this new development, Indiana prosecutors came to believe that Alexander was in fact not responsible for any of the rapes. In the remaining rape for which he was incarcerated, the evidence against him consisted of the victim's tentative identification of his voice and an eyewitness's visual identification of Alexander. The Indiana prosecutor and Alexander's defense attorney filed a joint [[Motion (legal)|motion]] to have Alexander's convictions overturned.&lt;ref name="ip"/&gt;

The courts granted the motion, and Alexander was exonerated of all charges and released from prison on December 12, 2001.&lt;ref name="fof"/&gt; It is now believed that the River Park Rapist was actually two separate perpetrators.

== Lawsuit ==
On June 4, 2002, Richard Alexander filed a federal [[Lawsuit|suit]] against the city of [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]], its police department and 14 of its officers, including Sgt. Cindy Eastman, an officer instrumental in securing Alexander's release. His lawyer, Roseann P. Ivanovich, said she expected to ask for about $55 million in damages ($10 million for every year spent in prison).&lt;ref name="tij"&gt;Coyne, T. (2002) "Man Freed by DNA Sues South Bend, Indiana Police". ''The Associated Press''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the allegations in the 48-page lawsuit:

* Police showed photos of Alexander to rape victims who said they had not seen enough of their attackers' faces for a positive identification.
* Police coerced or constructed the identifications of Alexander that were used at his trial.
* Police destroyed evidence and ignored Alexander's [[alibi]]s.&lt;ref name="tij"/&gt;

The civil rights lawsuit was eventually dismissed by the [[United States district court]], a decision which Alexander appealed. But on January 3, 2006, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] upheld the district court's dismissal of Alexander's lawsuit. The court stated that Alexander had not proven his rights were violated during the trial which yielded his wrongful conviction.&lt;ref&gt;''Alexander v. City of South Bend''. Docket #04-2535. Citation 433 F3d 550. January 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsequent legal troubles ==
On May 22, 2007, Alexander pleaded guilty to one count of [[Battery (crime)|battery]] for having beaten a former girlfriend with a lead pipe in 2005. As part of his [[plea bargain]], a second count of battery was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southbendtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070522/News01/70522061|title=South Bend man wrongfully imprisoned for five years pleads guilty to battery|work=[[South Bend Tribune]]|year=2007|accessdate=May 23, 2007}}{{Dead link|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 14, 2007, Alexander was sentenced to eight years in prison, with two years suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox28.com/News/index.php?ID=20102 |title=Alexander Goes Back to Prison |work=[[WSJV]] |year=2007 |accessdate=July 1, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928070237/http://www.fox28.com/News/index.php?ID=20102 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sergeant '''Robert Allen Owens''' (September 13, 1920 – November 1, 1943) was a [[United States Marine]] who was [[killed in action]] during [[World War II]].  He was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumous]]ly awarded [[United States|his nation's]] highest military award &amp;mdash; the [[Medal of Honor]] &amp;mdash; for his heroic actions on his first day in combat at [[Bougainville campaign (1944-45)|Bougainville]].  The commanding general of the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]] described Owens' heroism &amp;mdash; "Among many brave acts on the beachhead of Bougainville, no other single act saved the lives of more of his comrades or served to contribute so much to the success of the landings."&lt;ref name="USMCbio"&gt;United States Marine Corps biography.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Robert Allen Owens was born in Greenville, South Carolina, on September 13, 1920. The family later moved to [[Spartanburg, South Carolina|Spartanburg]], which young Owens listed as his home town. After two years in high school, he went to work as a textile worker in a neighboring town. He worked at that for five years before his enlistment in the Marine Corps on February 10, 1942.

==Marine Corps service==
In 1942, Owens went through [[recruit training]] at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island|Parris Island]], South Carolina, and then Owens continued his training with the  1st Training Battalion of the 1st Marine Division, then located in New River, North Carolina. In June, the unit's designation was changed to Company A, [[1st Battalion 3rd Marines|1st Battalion]], [[3rd Marine Regiment (United States)|3rd Marines]], [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]]. The Division left the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]  and the 3rd Marines' first overseas station at [[Tutuila]], [[American Samoa]], in September 1942. Later they went to New Zealand and Guadalcanal to train for their first combat assignment. After 21 months of training, Owens would see his first and only combat mission.

===Medal of Honor action===
On November 1, 1943, the [[Landings at Cape Torokina|Marine amphibious landing at Cape Torokina]], [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], was strongly resisted by the sole piece of artillery available to the Japanese defenders, a well-camouflaged [[Type 94 75 mm Mountain Gun|75 millimeter regimental gun]]. Strategically placed and protected within a [[coconut]] log bunker, the gun had already destroyed four landing craft and damaged ten others, seriously threatening the success of the operation. No boats could approach the beach without passing within 150 yards or less from the muzzle. The emplacement was so situated that it could only be attacked from the front and also in a position whereby rifle fire and grenades could not reach the gun crew.

Sizing up the situation, Sgt Owens decided that the only way to neutralize the gun was to charge it directly from the front. Calling on four volunteers to assist him, he positioned them where they could place supporting bunkers under fire. At the moment when he judged he had a fair chance of reaching his objective, the six-feet-three, 232-pound Marine charged right into the very mouth of the still rapidly firing cannon. Entering the emplacement through the fire port, he chased the Japanese out the back where they were cut down by his rifleman. Pursuing them, he in turn was instantly killed.

It was discovered that a round had been placed in the chamber and the breech was almost closed at the moment that Sgt Owens came through the fire port. Over 150 rounds of high-explosive shells were stacked and ready for firing. The enemy had counted heavily on this weapon to stop the Marine landing. They made several determined but fruitless efforts to recapture the piece. Maj Gen [[Allen H. Turnage]], Commanding General of the 3rd Marine Division, said, "Among many brave acts on the beachhead of Bougainville, no other single act saved the lives of more of his comrades or served to contribute so much to the success of the landings."&lt;ref name="USMCbio"/&gt;

==Posthumous recognitions==
General [[Alexander A. Vandegrift]], then [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]], and Maj Gen Turnage so strongly recommended the Medal of Honor for Sgt Owens, who had already received the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]] posthumously, that the case was reviewed and the generals' recommendations were adopted. The medal was presented to the hero's father at his home in Drayton, South Carolina, on August 12, 1945, by Maj Gen Clayton B. Vogel, then Commanding General at Parris Island.

Initially buried in the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps Cemetery on Bougainville, Sgt Owens' remains were later reinterred in the [[Manila American Cemetery]] formally  Fort McKinley U.S. Military Cemetery .

==Medal of Honor citation==
The [[President of the United States]] takes pride in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR posthumously to
&lt;center&gt;
'''SERGEANT ROBERT A. OWENS'''&lt;br/&gt;
UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS
&lt;/center&gt;
for service as set forth in the following CITATION:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving with a marine division, in action against enemy Japanese forces during extremely hazardous landing operations at Cape Torokina, Bougainville, Solomon Islands, on 1 November 1943. Forced to pass within disastrous range of a strongly protected, well-camouflaged Japanese 75-mm. regimental gun strategically located on the beach, our landing units were suffering heavy losses in casualties and boats while attempting to approach the beach, and the success of the operations was seriously threatened. Observing the ineffectiveness of marine rifle and grenade attacks against the incessant, devastating fire of the enemy weapon and aware of the urgent need for prompt action, Sgt. Owens unhesitatingly determined to charge the gun bunker from the front and, calling on 4 of his comrades to assist him, carefully placed them to cover the fire of the 2 adjacent hostile bunkers. Choosing a moment that provided a fair opportunity for passing these bunkers, he immediately charged into the mouth of the steadily firing cannon and entered the emplacement through the fire port, driving the guncrew out of the rear door and insuring their destruction before he himself was wounded. Indomitable and aggressive in the face of almost certain death, Sgt. Owens silenced a powerful gun which was of inestimable value to the Japanese defense and, by his brilliant initiative and heroic spirit of self-sacrifice, contributed immeasurably to the success of the vital landing operations. His valiant conduct throughout reflects the highest credit upon himself and the [[United States Department of the Navy|U.S. Naval Service]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Sean Franklin Sasser''' (October 25, 1968 – August 7, 2013) was an American educator, pastry chef and reality television personality best known for his appearances on MTV's ''[[The Real World: San Francisco]]'', which depicted his relationship with fellow AIDS activist [[Pedro Zamora]]. Although not one of the original cast members himself, Sasser's relationship with Zamora was one of the focal points of that season. This included a [[commitment ceremony]] in which the two exchanged vows, the first such ceremony for a same sex couple on television, and considered a landmark event in the medium.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;Duke, Alan; Carter, Chelsea, J. (August 8, 2013). [http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/08/showbiz/sean-sasser-death/index.html "Sean Sasser, whose ceremony with partner on 'Real World' was TV first, dies"]. [[CNN]]. Retrieved November 28, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USAToday&gt;Oldenburg, Ann (August 8, 2013). [https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2013/08/08/real-world-star-sean-sasser-dies-at-44/2632631 "'Real World' star Sean Sasser dies at 44"]. ''[[USA Today]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Sean Franklin Sasser was born on October 25, 1968 in Detroit, where he grew up. When he was six, his parents divorced, after which his father, an Army sergeant, was mostly absent from his life,&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost&gt;McGonough, Megan (August 13, 2013). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/sean-sasser-part-of-one-of-tvs-first-gay-romances-dies-at-44/2013/08/13/d6cc1a4c-035e-11e3-9259-e2aafe5a5f84_story.html "Sean Sasser, part of one of TV’s first gay romances, dies at 44"]. ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=POZ&gt;Jones, Anderson (June 1997). [http://www.poz.com/articles/241_1725.shtml "Nowhere Else to Go"]. ''[[POZ (magazine)|POZ]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; sending a [[Casio]] watch to him every year on his birthday. (Years later his father called when Sasser was in Minneapolis, and left a message with Sasser's boyfriend, but left no number and did not call back.)&lt;ref name=POZ/&gt; Sasser's mother, Patricia Sasser, continued to raise Sasser and his younger sister. Sasser attended a private school, which he said was probably not typical of most African-American young people in urban Detroit. He later attended [[Cass Technical High School]], a select [[college-preparatory]] [[magnet school]].&lt;ref name=POZ/&gt; After high school, Sasser attended the [[University of Chicago]] to study [[Near Eastern]] civilizations and become an [[archeologist]], commenting, "I wanted to be one of the first major black archeologists to call the bluff on all this Egyptian stuff that was stolen by other cultures." However, he found himself bored and depressed, and barely completed his freshman year.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost/&gt; Sasser dropped out of college,&lt;ref name=POZ/&gt; intending initially to take a year off. After he [[came out]] as gay to his devoutly religious mother (the daughter of a minister mother),&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost/&gt; he attempted to enlist in the [[United States Navy]], explaining in a 1997 interview, "I didn't want to be gay anymore. I thought it would work. You know, the discipline, all that stuff." Before he could leave his home, however, a mandatory blood test revealed that the 19-year-old Sasser was [[HIV-positive]]. He decided to enroll in [[culinary school]], as he had always been fond of cooking, and wanted to open his own restaurant.&lt;ref name=POZ/&gt;

After finishing school, Sasser found jobs cooking in local Chicago restaurants, but was too fixated on the idea of dying from AIDS. Realizing that he "needed to figure out how to keep living", he moved to San Francisco, whose greater HIV awareness and diversity allowed him to find people he more easily related to&amp;nbsp;– specifically, HIV-positive people closer to his own age&amp;nbsp;– which raised his spirits. Sasser joined a youth HIV-positive movement that advocated attention for adolescents with the disease, and began speaking to groups about his own experience with HIV. He subsequently assisted a support group called Bay Area Positives, for young people of color. He appeared in a number of videos on behalf of the group, including "Not Me", which aired on [[PBS]]. He was photographed by [[Annie Leibovitz]] for a national AIDS awareness campaign.&lt;ref name=POZ/&gt;

==Relationship with Pedro Zamora and ''The Real World''==
Sasser attended the 1993 Lesbian and Gay March on [[Washington D.C.|Washington]], where he introduced himself to a fellow AIDS educator named [[Pedro Zamora]]. Although Sasser did not characterize his meeting Zamora as love at first sight (they were both involved with other people at the time), he was moved by Zamora's presence and conviction, recalling, "I was kind of like, 'Wow.' I had never run across someone who was as good at it as he was." Sasser encouraged Zamora to call him if Zamora ever visited San Francisco. Sasser subsequently learned that producers of ''[[The Real World]]'' were looking for an HIV-positive person to cast in the 1994 season in San Francisco season, where Sasser had been living for a couple of years, and eventually learned that the person cast was Zamora, whom Sasser felt was ideal for the role.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost/&gt;&lt;ref name=POZ/&gt;&lt;ref name=PedroAndMe103-109&gt;[[Winick, Judd]] (2000). ''[[Pedro and Me: Friendship, Loss, and What I Learned]]''. Henry Holt &amp; Co. pp. 103-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sasser had been living in San Francisco for a couple of years in the 1990s. When Zamora moved into ''The Real World'' San Francisco loft, he and Sasser began dating. Zamora asked the show's producers for permission to go out on the second date without cameras, so that he and Sasser could get to know one another in a more natural setting. After the producers allowed this, Sasser and Zamora fell in love, and their relationship became a focal point of the season.&lt;ref name=POZ/&gt;&lt;ref name=PedroAndMe103-109/&gt; Their relationship met with the approval of Zamora's housemates and close friends, [[Judd Winick]] and [[Pam Ling]], the latter of whom joked that Sasser and Zamora "would become the mayors of [[The Castro, San Francisco|Castro Street]]". Winick adds that whereas Sasser was a private person who harbored the ability to pack up and leave town on short notice, Zamora's openness led them to discuss more permanent living arrangements as a couple.&lt;ref name=POZ/&gt; Sasser proposed to Zamora, and the two exchanged vows in a [[commitment ceremony]] in the loft,&lt;ref name=PedroAndMe103-109/&gt;&lt;ref name=ep19&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/358228/cant-wait.jhtml#id=1607636 |title=Video of Episode 19 of '&amp;#39;The Real World: San Francisco'&amp;#39; ("Love Rules") at |publisher=MTV.com |date=March 28, 2009 |accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first such ceremony for a same-sex couple in television history.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

After production on ''The Real World'' ceased in June 1994, Zamora visited his family in [[Miami]] before returning to San Francisco to live with Sasser. In August 1994, Zamora was diagnosed in New York City with [[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy]] (PML),&lt;ref name=POZ/&gt;&lt;ref name=PedroAndMe119-137&gt;Winick (2000). pp. 119-137.&lt;/ref&gt; and was given three to four months to live.&lt;ref name=PedroAndMe119-137/&gt; On September 3, Zamora was flown to Mercy Hospital in Miami, where his family could be close to him.&lt;ref name=People11.28.94&gt;Israel, Betsy (November 28, 1994). [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20104536,00.html "HIV, And Positive, Pedro Zamora of MTV's Real World Lived His Too-Brief Life To Its Limit"]. ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''. Vol. 42, No. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tribute&gt;''A Tribute to Pedro Zamora'' MTV. November 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; His family was not accepting of Sasser, however,&lt;ref name=POZ/&gt; and because the PML gradually took away Zamora's ability to speak,&lt;ref name=POZ/&gt;&lt;ref name=PedroAndMe141-161&gt;Winick (2000). pp. 141-161.&lt;/ref&gt; Zamora was unable to explicitly communicate to them the importance of Sasser in his life. This led to confrontations between Sasser and the Zamoras, who told him that "Pedro did not need to have a lover anymore", and mostly excluded Sasser from Zamora during his final days.&lt;ref name=POZ/&gt; Zamora died on November 11, 1994.&lt;ref name=People11.28.94/&gt;&lt;ref name=PedroAndMe141-161/&gt;&lt;ref name=MiamiHerald&gt;Rothaus, Steve (March 22, 2009). [http://miamiherald.typepad.com/gaysouthflorida/2009/03/years-after-his-death-aids-activist-pedro-zamora-is-celebrated-on-film.html "Years After his Death, A Young AIDS Activist's Life is Celebrated on Film: Remembering Pedro"]. ''[[The Miami Herald]]''. p. 1E.&lt;/ref&gt; Sasser returned to San Francisco two days later.&lt;ref name=POZ/&gt; Six months after Zamora's death, he resumed his speaking engagements for [[LGBT]] and HIV issues. In 1995, he spoke at the inaugural White House AIDS conference, and was appointed by President [[Bill Clinton]] to the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost/&gt; He moved to Atlanta in late 1995, in order to be with his boyfriend, and hoped to open a café.&lt;ref name=POZ/&gt;

In 2008 [[Bunim-Murray Productions]] produced a film, ''[[Pedro (film)|Pedro]]'', directed by Nick Oceano, dramatizing Zamora's life. In the film, Sasser is portrayed by DaJuan Johnson.&lt;ref name=pedromovie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pedrothemovie.com/cast_crew.html|title=''Pedro'': Cast and Crew|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=2008|accessdate=January 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sasser took issue with the film's portrayal of his relationship with Zamora's family. In the film, after Zamora is hospitalized in Miami, his father and brothers initially refuse to accept Sasser as Zamora's spouse, telling Sasser that their time in San Francisco is over, and attempt to keep them apart. After Zamora objects to this, Zamora's family is made to watch the video of their commitment ceremony, and accept Sasser as Zamora's husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people = Nick Oceano (Director); [[Dustin Lance Black]], [[Paris Barclay]] (Writers)|title=Pedro|medium=Made for TV movie|publisher=[[Bunim/Murray Productions]]/MTV|location=United States|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sasser, who regretted not having had an opportunity to spend more time with Zamora, says that this was not what occurred in reality, saying, "I have a lot of resentment toward dealing with his family's homophobia, as well as dealing with him dying... It's troublesome. If there had been some sort of support behind our commitment ceremony... I had a hard time dealing with his family. With Pedro's death and being allowed in the hospital... I don't know. Maybe it could have helped the family deal with my presence, you know?"&lt;ref name=POZ/&gt;

==After ''The Real World''==
Sasser was a pastry chef at Ritz-Carlton hotel properties and head pastry chef at [[The Nines (hotel)|The Nines]], a luxury hotel in [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Byron (October 22, 2008). [http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-9733-to_the_nines.html "To the Nines: Adding it all up at Portland’s most luxurious new hotel."] ''[[Willamette Week]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DiGuglielmo, Joey (September 18, 2013). [http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/09/18/remembering-sean-sasser/ "Remembering Sean Sasser"]. ''[[Washington Blade]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] in 2012, where, as a pastry chef at a restaurant called RIS,&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost/&gt; he was praised by the ''[[Washington Blade]]'' for his homemade ice cream and sorbets.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Jonathan (May 16, 2013). [http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/05/16/gay-pastry-chef-sean-sasser-sweet-tooth-dining-ris/ "Sasser's sweet tooth"]. ''Washington Blade''.&lt;/ref&gt; Sasser said of his work, "I want to serve desserts and pastries that people recognize and love to eat, but sometimes with an unexpected twist of surprise."&lt;ref name=People8.8.13&gt;Gosgrove Baylis, Sheila (August 8, 2013). [http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20724140,00.html "Sean Sasser, of ''The Real World'', Dies at 44"]. ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Sasser married Michael Kaplan,&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt;&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost/&gt;&lt;ref name=People8.8.13/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBSNews&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-207_162-57597640/sean-sasser-real-world-star-dies-at-44/ "Sean Sasser, 'Real World' star, dies at 44"]. [[CBS News]]. August 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; whom he had dated off and on since the 1990s, and with whom he had moved in six years prior.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; While living in the District, Sasser served as a board member of the AIDS Alliance for Children, Youth and Families. He was active in youth and mentoring organizations, and he and Kaplan served as foster parents to a 4-year-old girl.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
In July 2013, Sasser, who had been HIV-positive for 25 years, was also diagnosed with [[mesothelioma]], a rare cancer of the lungs.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; Sasser had no known occupational exposure to asbestos, the primary cause of mesothelioma, though studies suggest that "chronic immunosuppression enhances susceptibility to mesothelioma."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Various|url=http://www.casesjournal.com/content/2/1/7498|title=Mesothelioma in an HIV/AIDS patient without history of asbestos exposure: possible role for immunosuppression in mesothelioma: a case report|work=[[Cases Journal]]|date=May 11, 2009|volume=2|page=7498}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at his home on August 7, 2013, at the age of 44.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt;&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost/&gt;&lt;ref name=People8.8.13/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBSNews/&gt; In accordance with his wishes, his body was cremated, and his ashes spread upon places he had been or wished to visit.&lt;ref name=CBSNews/&gt; He is survived by his husband, Michael, mother, Patricia, and his sister, a dancer who lives in Detroit with her husband and daughter.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost/&gt;&lt;ref name=POZ/&gt;

Sasser's relationship with Zamora is credited with breaking a taboo against showing two men in a loving, stable relationship on television. ''[[Real World: Miami]]'' cast member Dan Renzi, himself openly gay, stated, "Long before ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'' or ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'' showcased gay people on TV living mainstream lives, and before the magic of [[protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitor]] 'cocktails' turned HIV into a manageable disease, Sasser gave a brave face to both issues and brought those taboo topics to educate millions of young Americans."&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez, Maria Elena (August 8, 2013).

The Sean Sasser Memorial Endowment Fund at AIDS United was established in September 2013 to mobilize support for programs that improve the health outcomes for gay men of color.

In various occult movements, '''Secret Chiefs''' are said to be transcendent cosmic authorities, a [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] responsible for the operation and moral calibre of the [[cosmos]], or for overseeing the operations of an [[esotericism|esoteric]] organization that manifests outwardly in the form of a [[magical order]] or lodge system. Their names and descriptions have varied through time, dependent upon those who reflect their experience of contact with them. They are variously held to exist on higher [[planes of being]] or to be [[incarnate]]; if incarnate, they may be described as being gathered at some special location, such as [[Shambhala]], or scattered through the world working anonymously.

One early and influential source on these entities is [[Karl von Eckartshausen]], whose ''The Cloud Upon The Sanctuary'', published in 1795, explained in some detail their character and motivations. Several 19th and 20th century [[occultism|occultists]] claimed to belong to or to have contacted these Secret Chiefs and made these communications known to others, including [[H.P. Blavatsky]] (who called them the "Tibetan Masters" or [[Mahatmas]]), [[C.W. Leadbeater]] and [[Alice A. Bailey]] (who called them [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]]), [[Guy Ballard]] and [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] (who called them [[Ascended Master]]s), Aleister Crowley (who used the term to refer to members of the upper three grades of his order, [[A∴A∴]] ), [[Dion Fortune]] (who called them the "esoteric order"), and [[Max Heindel]] (who called them the "Elder Brothers").

One source is the 12th Century Persian [[Ali Hujwiri]]. In his divine court, there are three hundred ''akhyār'' (“excellent ones”), forty ''abdāl'' (“substitutes”), seven ''abrār'' (“piously devoted ones”), four ''awtād'' (“pillars”) three ''nuqabā'' (“leaders”) and one qutb.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"All these saints know one another and cannot act without mutual consent. It is the task of the Awtad to go round the whole world every night, and if there should be any place on which their eyes have not fallen, next day some flaw will appear in that place, and they must then inform the Qutb in order that he may direct his attention to the weak spot and that by his blessings the imperfection may be remedied".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another is from [[Ibn Arabi|Ibn Arabī]], who lived in Moorish Spain. It has a more exclusive structure.  There are eight ''nujabā'' (“nobles”), twelve ''nuqabā'', seven ''abdāl'', four ''awtād'', two ''a’immah'' (“guides”), and the qutb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Lindsay|title=Encyclopedia of Religion, Second Edition|year=2005|publisher=Thomson Gale|location=Farmington Hills, MI|isbn=0-02-865733-0|pages=8821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 20th century Sufi [[Inayat Khan]], there are seven degrees in the hierarchy. In ascending order, they are [[Pir (Sufism)|Pir]], [[Buzurg (Sufism)|Buzurg]], [[Wali#Use in Tasawuf/Sufism|Wali]], [[Ghaus]], Qutb, [[Prophet of Islam|Nabi]] and [[Rasul]] He does not say how the levels are populated. Pirs and Buzurgs assist the spiritual progress of those who approach them. Walis may take responsibility for protecting a community and generally work in secret. Qutbs are similarly responsible for large regions. Nabis are charged with bringing a reforming message to nations or faiths, and hence have a public role. Rasools likewise have a mission of transformation of the world at large.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wahiduddin.net/mv2/IX/IX_12.htm The Spiritual Hierarchy, from the Spiritual Message of Hazrat Inayat Khan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theosophy==
Helena Blavatsky's [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]], a blend of Western Occultism and Asian religious philosophy, proposed the existence of a society of Secret Chiefs called the [[Great White Brotherhood]]. Later offshoots of the [[Theosophical Society]] used the term [[Ascended master]] or Mahatma.

In the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], Ascended Master are believed to be spiritually [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightened]] beings who in past incarnations were ordinary humans, but who have undergone a series of spiritual transformations originally called ''initiations''.

Both "Mahatmas" and "Ascended Master" are terms used in the Ascended Master Teachings. Ascended Master is based on the Theosophical concept of the Mahatma or ''Master of the Ancient Wisdom.'' However, "Mahatmas" and "Ascended Masters" are believed by some to differ in certain respects.

==Occultism==

===The Golden Dawn===
{{main article|Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn}}

The ''Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn'' was founded by those claiming to be in communication with the Secret Chiefs. One of these  Secret Chiefs was [[Anna Sprengel]]. Her name and address were decoded from the [[Cipher Manuscripts]].

===S.L. MacGregor Mathers===
{{main article|Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers}}

In 1892, Mathers was convinced that he had contacted these Secret Chiefs, and that this confirmed his position as head of the Golden Dawn.&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;Wilson 1987, page 48&lt;/ref&gt; He declared this in a manifesto four years later saying that they were human and living on [[Earth]], yet possessed terrible superhuman powers.&lt;ref name="wilson"/&gt; He used this status to found the ''Second Order'' within the Golden Dawn,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 1987, page 54&lt;/ref&gt; and to introduce the ''Adeptus Minor'' [[ritual]].&lt;ref&gt;F. King 1978, page 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aleister Crowley===
{{main article|Aleister Crowley}}

While in Algeria in 1909, Crowley, along with [[Victor Benjamin Neuburg|Victor Neuburg]], recited numerous [[Enochian]] Calls or Aires. After the fifteenth Aire, he was told that he had attained the grade of [[A∴A∴#Magister Templi|Magister Templi]] (Master of the Temple), which meant that he himself was now on the level of these Secret Chiefs, although this declaration caused many legitimate occultists to stop taking him seriously if they had not done so already.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 1987, page 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. King 1978, page 54&lt;/ref&gt; He also described this attainment as a possible and in fact a necessary step for all who truly followed his path.&lt;ref&gt;''One Star in Sight'', available at http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/aba/app2.html says the order in question "''is composed of those who have crossed the Abyss...the two crises -- the Angel and the Abyss --- are necessary features in every career.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, when Aleister Crowley died, he left behind a sketch of one of the "Secret Chiefs", Crowley's invisible mentor that he called LAM. The sketch looks like a [[Grey Alien]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Kenneth. ''Outside the Circles of Time''. London: Frederick Muller Ltd., 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fourth way and related teachings==

===G. I. Gurdjieff===
{{Main article|Fourth way}}
The Graeco-Armenian [[G. I. Gurdjieff]]'s teachings, known as the Fourth Way, mentioned a "Universal Brotherhood" and also a mysterious group of monks called the ''[[Sarmoung]]'' (also: ''Sarman'', ''Sarmouni''). Both groups were described as in possession of advanced knowledge and powers, and as being open to suitable candidates from all creeds. He also believed in advanced kinds of humans called "man number 6" and "man number seven", of whom he said:-

&lt;blockquote&gt;
They cannot perform actions opposed to their understanding or have an understanding which is not expressed by actions. At the same time there can be no discords among them, no differences of understanding. Therefore their activity is entirely co-ordinated and leads to one common aim without any kind of compulsion because it is based upon a common and identical understanding.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

...although he never  explicitly linked "higher man" to his "brotherhoods".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duversity.org/PDF/Gurdjieff,%20Bennet%20and%20the%20Fourth%20Way.pdf Gurdjieff, Bennett and the Fourth Way]&lt;/ref&gt;

===J. G. Bennett===
[[J. G. Bennett]], was both a prominent student of Gurdjieff and an independent thinker. In his work ''[[The Dramatic Universe]]'' he speculated on a discarnate Hidden Directorate, or "[[Demiurge|Demiurgic]] intelligences". He later linked the Hidden Directorate with a historically attested lineage of [[Sufi]]s, the [[Khwajagan]]. These theories, influenced by a Turkish Sufi called Hasan Shushud,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jgbennett.org/tag/hasan-shushud/ Hasan Shushud at jgbennet.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readingrumi.com/hasan-shushud/ Hasan Shushud at readingrumi.com]&lt;/ref&gt; were spelled out in his last book, ''Masters of Wisdom''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Masters-Wisdom-Bennett-Spiritual-Classic/dp/1881408019 Bennet's Masters of Wisdom on Amazon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.systematics.org/journal/misc/mwca.pdf Translation of Shushud's Masters of Wisdom]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Idries Shah===
The Afghan-Scottish teacher [[Idries Shah]] regarded himself as a Sufi, not a Fourth Way exponent, although he took on pupils from Bennett's, and other, Gurdjieff groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duversity.org/institute_2.htm Shah's interactions with Bennett at duversity.org]&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned the Sarmoung or Sarman several times in his works. Shah also linked a number of Western initiatory groups such as the Rosicrucians and [[Freemason]]s to Sufis.

===Ernest Scott===
In 1986, the journalist [[Edward Campbell (journalist)|Edward Campbell]] wrote a book, ''The People of the Secret'', under the [[pseudonym]] "Ernest Scott".&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;{{cite web

'''St Paul's Cray''' is an area of South East [[Greater London|London]] within the [[London Borough of Bromley]]. It is located south of [[Sidcup]] and north of [[Orpington]].

==The area==
The village includes a small parade of shops, as well as part of the industrial estate on Cray Avenue that connects to its sister [[St Mary Cray]]. The former Broomwood pub is now a [[McDonald's]] and lies on the main road. Like St Mary Cray, St Paul's Cray is home to a large ex-traveller community as well as many descendants of Irish travellers who moved south from [[Bermondsey]] after the docks shut. The local football team, [[Cray Wanderers F.C.]], is one of the oldest football clubs in the world.&lt;ref name=oldclub&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.craywanderersjfc.co.uk/club/History |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127210001/http://www.craywanderersjfc.co.uk/club/History |archivedate=27 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cray Wanderers were looking to return to the area at [[Sandy Lane (Cray Wanderers Stadium)|Sandy Lane]]. In September 2013, permission to develop Sandy Lane was refused by LB Bromley. Cray Wanderers announced on 6 October 2014 an intention to purchase Flamingo Park, adjacent to the A20 Sidcup by-pass, subject to receiving planning permission from LB Bromley for a football stadium and sports centre to be built there.

==History==
Though modern in appearance, St Paul’s Cray has an ancient history. Romans camped along the banks of the river, and even earlier settlements are suggested by the mysterious dene holes, caverns shaped in the chalk, which have been found on either side of the valley.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;London Borough of Bromley Official Guide, published by authority of the Council of the London Borough of Bromley, 1971/74&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Simon de Cray held the manor in the time of Edward I. He took his name from St Paul’s Cray. He was knighted for his part in the Scottish wars. He became Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in 1275.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;An Illustrated Guide to St Mary Cray and t © St Mary Cray Action Group 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The name St Paul’s Cray has no direct connection with St Paul the Apostle; it is simply an abbreviation of St Paulinus Cray. The 11th-century church, made redundant in 1978 but now occupied by the Redeemed Christian Church of God,&lt;ref name="St Paulinus Churchyard"&gt;{{cite web|title=St Paulinus Churchyard|url=http://www.londongardensonline.org.uk/gardens-online-record.asp?ID=BRO080|website=London Gardens Online|publisher=London Parks &amp; Gardens Trust|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is sited on Main Road on the attractive riverside section of the St Paul’s Cray Conservation Area. From its structural form, it would appear to be a possibly Saxon foundation and certainly earlier than the thirteenth-century St Mary’s. A rare dedication suggests that a church could have occupied the site in the early seventh century. (Paulinus was an early Christian missionary, and a close contemporary of Augustine who subsequently became Archbishop of York and Bishop of Rochester.)&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The area was known in the 16th century as Paul Crey. [[William Camden]] born in 1551 writes in a 1610 travel guide in a section on Kent: "Here the riverlet Crey, anciently called Crecan , intermingleth it selfe with Darent, ? when in his short course he hath imparted his name to five townlets which hee watereth,as Saint Marie Crey, Pauls Crey, Votes-Crey, North Crey,? and Crey-ford in former ages Crecanford, where Hengest the Saxon, the eighth yeare after his arrivall, joyned battaile with the Britans, and after hee had slaine their captaines brought them under with so great a slaughter that afterwards hee never stood in feare of them, but established his kingdome quietly in Kent."
&lt;ref&gt;Britain, or, a Chorographicall Description of the most flourishing Kingdomes, England, Scotland, and Ireland by William Camden, 1610 http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/text/chap_page.jsp?t_id=Camden&amp;c_id=12&amp;p_id=3354#pn_28&lt;/ref&gt;

While some development has taken place on the east side of the old village, open country with a belt of woodland extends to the hamlet of Hockenden and the borough boundary. On the west side, a large housing estate to accommodate 10,000 of London’s overspill has swallowed up farm and woodland since the Second World War. This new township which extends as far west as Chislehurst Common has its own shopping centre, churches, schools, library and industrial estate.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Sports facilities are found at the recreation ground, with Hoblingwell Wood to the rear.

==Nearby Areas==
St Paul's Cray borders [[Foots Cray]] to the north, [[Ruxley]] to the north east, [[Swanley]] to the east, [[St Mary Cray]] to the south east and south, [[Petts Wood]] to the south west and west and [[Chislehurst]] to the north west.

==Transport==
St Pauls Cray is served by [[Transport for London]] bus routes 51 to [[Woolwich]] via [[Sidcup]] and to [[Orpington]], 273 to [[Lewisham]] via [[Grove Park, Lewisham|Grove Park]] and to [[Petts Wood]], B14 to [[Bexleyheath]] via Sidcup and to Orpington, R1 to [[Green Street Green]], and R11 to Sidcup and Green Street Green. The nearest rail link to St Paul's Cray is at [[St Mary Cray station]].

'''''The Bad Popes''''' is a 1969 book by E. R. Chamberlin documenting the lives of eight of the most controversial [[pope]]s (papal years in parentheses):

'''Vivien Theodore Thomas''' (August 29, 1910 – November 26, 1985)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=George D. |title=Profiles in Hue |page=76 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OANpT_Bl1c8C&amp;pg=PA76 |year=2011 |publisher=Light of the Savior Ministries |isbn=978-1-4568-5119-4 |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[African-American]] [[surgical technician]] who developed the procedures used to treat [[blue baby syndrome]] (now known as cyanotic heart disease) in the 1940s. He was the assistant to surgeon [[Alfred Blalock]] in Blalock's experimental animal laboratory at [[Vanderbilt University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and later at the [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. He served as supervisor of the surgical laboratories at Johns Hopkins for 35 years. In 1976 Hopkins awarded him an honorary doctorate and named him an instructor of surgery for the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]].&lt;ref name="JHMI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalarchives.jhmi.edu/vthomas.htm|title=Vivien T. Thomas, L.L.D.|work=Medical archives|publisher=Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without any education past high school, Thomas rose above poverty and racism to become a [[cardiac surgery]] pioneer and a teacher of operative techniques to many of the country's most prominent surgeons.

A [[PBS]] documentary ''Partners of the Heart'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/dome/0301/close_up.cfm |title=Almost a Miracle |publisher=Hopkinsmedicine.org |date= |accessdate=March 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302102051/http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/dome/0301/close_up.cfm |archivedate=March 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was broadcast in 2003 on PBS's [[American Experience]]. In the 2004 HBO movie, ''[[Something the Lord Made]]'', Vivien Thomas was portrayed by [[Mos Def]].

==Early life==

Thomas was born in [[New Iberia, Louisiana]], and was the son of Mary (Eaton) and William Marco Thomas.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=3}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vivien Theodore Thomas|url=http://taneya-kalonji.com/family/getperson.php?personID=I104&amp;tree=8|website=taneya-kalonji.com|publisher=Taneya &amp; Kalonji|accessdate=October 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grandson of a slave, he attended [[Martin Luther King Magnet at Pearl High School|Pearl High School]] in Nashville in the 1920s.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=5}} Thomas had hoped to attend college and become a doctor, but the [[Great Depression]] derailed his plans.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=8}} He worked at [[Vanderbilt University]] in the summer of 1929 doing carpentry{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=7}} but was laid off in the fall. In that same year, Thomas enrolled in the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial College as a premedical student.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://medicalarchives.jhmi.edu:8080/webcat/request/DoMenuRequest?SystemName=JHMI&amp;UserName=wa+public&amp;Password=&amp;TemplateProcessID=6000_1051&amp;logoLink=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalarchives.jhmi.edu%2F&amp;leftWelcomeWidth=525&amp;SearchKeyword=vivien+thomas|title = The Alan Mason Chesney Medical Archives of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions|date = 2006|accessdate = February 25, 2015|website = medicalarchives.jhmi.edu|publisher = The Alan Mason Chesney Medical Archives of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the wake of the stock market crash in October, Thomas put his educational plans on hold, and, through a friend, in February 1930 secured a job as surgical research technician with Dr. [[Alfred Blalock]] at [[Vanderbilt University]].{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=9}} On his first day of work, Thomas assisted Blalock with a surgical experiment on a [[Anna (dog)|dog]].{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=12}} At the end of Thomas's first day, Blalock told Thomas they would do another experiment the next morning. Blalock told Thomas to "come in and put the animal to sleep and get it set up". Within a few weeks, Thomas was starting surgery on his own.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|pp=9–13}} Thomas was classified and paid as a [[janitor]],{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=43}} despite the fact that by the mid-1930s, he was doing the work of a [[Postdoctoral researcher]] in the lab.

Before meeting Blalock, Thomas married Clara and had two daughters.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=48}} When Nashville's banks failed nine months after starting his job with Blalock and Thomas' savings were wiped out,{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=9}} he abandoned his plans for college and medical school, relieved to have even a low-paying job as the Great Depression deepened.

==Working with Blalock==
[[File:Vivien Thomas.jpg|thumb|Vivien Thomas in the lab]]
Thomas and Blalock did groundbreaking research into the causes of hemorrhagic{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=33}} and traumatic [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]].{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=48}} This work later evolved into research on [[crush syndrome]]{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=66}} and saved the lives of thousands of soldiers on the battlefields of [[World War II]].{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=66}} In hundreds of experiments, the two disproved traditional theories which held that shock was caused by [[toxins]] in the blood.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=67}} Blalock, a highly original scientific thinker and something of an iconoclast, had theorized that shock resulted from fluid loss outside the vascular bed and that the condition could be effectively treated by fluid replacement.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=67}} Assisted by Thomas, he was able to provide incontrovertible proof of this theory, and in so doing, he gained wide recognition in the medical community by the mid-1930s. At this same time, Blalock and Thomas began experimental work in vascular and [[cardiac surgery]],{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=33}} defying medical taboos against operating upon the [[heart]]. It was this work that laid the foundation for the revolutionary lifesaving surgery they were to perform at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|Johns Hopkins]] a decade later.

==Working at Johns Hopkins==
By 1940, the work Blalock had done with Thomas placed him at the forefront of American surgery, and when he was offered the position of Chief of Surgery at his alma mater Johns Hopkins in 1941,{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=38}} he requested that Thomas accompany him.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=38}} Thomas arrived in [[Baltimore]] with his family in June of that year,{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=57}} confronting a severe housing shortage and a level of [[racism]] worse than they had endured in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=58}} Hopkins, like the rest of Baltimore, was rigidly segregated, and the only black employees at the institution were janitors. When Thomas walked the halls in his white lab coat, many heads turned. He began changing into his city clothes when he walked from the laboratory to Blalock's office because he received so much attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Timmermans|first=Stefan|date=April 2003|title=A Black Technician and Blue Babies|url=|journal=Social Studies of Science|volume=33|pages=197–229|doi=10.1177/03063127030332014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he lived in the 1200 block of Caroline Street in the community now known as [[Oliver, Baltimore]].

==Blue baby syndrome==

]]
In 1943, while pursuing his shock research, Blalock was approached by [[pediatric]] cardiologist [[Helen Taussig]],{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=80}} who was seeking a surgical solution to a complex and fatal four-part heart anomaly called [[tetralogy of Fallot]] (also known as [[blue baby syndrome]], although other cardiac anomalies produce blueness, or [[cyanosis]]). In infants born with this defect, blood is shunted past the lungs, thus creating oxygen deprivation and a blue pallor.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=80}} Having treated many such patients in her work in Hopkins's Harriet Lane Home, Taussig was desperate to find a surgical cure. According to the accounts in Thomas's 1985 autobiography and in a 1967 interview with medical historian Peter Olch, Taussig suggested only that it might be possible to "reconnect the pipes"{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=89}} in some way to increase the level of blood flow to the lungs but did not suggest how this could be accomplished. Blalock and Thomas realized immediately that the answer lay in a procedure they had perfected for a different purpose in their Vanderbilt work, involving the [[anastomosis]] (joining) of the [[subclavian artery]] to the [[pulmonary artery]], which had the effect of increasing blood flow to the lungs.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=89}} Thomas was charged with the task of first creating a blue baby-like condition in a dog, and then correcting the condition by means of the pulmonary-to-subclavian anastomosis.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=82}} Among the dogs on whom Thomas operated was one named Anna, who became the first long-term survivor of the operation and the only animal to have her portrait hung on the walls of Johns Hopkins. In nearly two years of laboratory work involving 200 dogs, Thomas was able to replicate two of the four cardiac anomalies involved in [[tetralogy of Fallot]].{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=86}} He did demonstrate that the corrective procedure was not lethal, thus persuading Blalock that the operation could be safely attempted on a human patient.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=91}}  Blalock was impressed with Thomas's work; when he inspected the procedure performed on Anna, he reportedly said, "This looks like something the Lord made."&lt;ref&gt;[http://reprints.longform.org/something-the-lord-made-mccabe "This looks like something the Lord made."] long form.org, retrieved June 8, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even though Thomas knew he was not allowed to operate on patients at that time, he still followed Blalock's rules and assisted him during surgery.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=92}}

==Decisive surgery==

On November 29, 1943
, the procedure was first tried on an eighteen-month-old infant named [[Eileen Saxon]].{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=92}}  The blue baby syndrome had made her lips and fingers turn blue, with the rest of her skin having a very faint blue tinge.  She could only take a few steps before beginning to breathe heavily. Because no instruments for cardiac surgery then existed, Thomas adapted the needles and clamps for the procedure from those in use in the animal lab.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=97}} During the surgery itself, at Blalock's request, Thomas stood on a step stool at Blalock's shoulder and coached him step by step through the procedure.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=94}} Thomas performed the operation hundreds of times on a dog, whereas Blalock only once as Thomas' assistant.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=94}} The surgery was not completely successful, though it did prolong the infant's life for several months.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=96}} Blalock and his team operated again on an 11-year-old girl, this time with complete success, and the patient was able to leave the hospital three weeks after the surgery.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=96}} Next, they operated upon a six-year-old boy, who dramatically regained his color at the end of the surgery.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=96}} The three cases formed the basis for the article that was published in the May 1945 issue of the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'', giving credit to Blalock and Taussig for the procedure. Thomas received no mention.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=97}}
[[File:Blalock shuntWiki.jpg|thumb|Schematic representation of the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig anastomosis between the right subclavian artery and right pulmonary artery. A / initial anastomosis - B / modified anastomosis.]]

News of this groundbreaking story was circulated around the world by the [[Associated Press]].{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=97}} [[Newsreels]] touted the event, greatly enhancing the status of Johns Hopkins and solidifying the reputation of Blalock, who had been regarded as a maverick up until that point by some in the Hopkins old guard.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=99}} Thomas' contribution remained unacknowledged, both by Blalock and by Hopkins. Within a year, the operation known as the [[Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt]] had been performed on more than 200 patients at Hopkins, with parents bringing their suffering children from thousands of miles away.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=99}} 

==Skills==
Thomas's surgical techniques included one he developed in 1946 for improving [[Circulatory system|circulation]] in patients whose [[great vessels]] (the [[aorta]] and the pulmonary artery) were transposed.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=122}} A complex operation called an atrial septectomy, the procedure was executed so flawlessly by Thomas that Blalock, upon examining the nearly undetectable suture line, was prompted to remark, "Vivien, this looks like something the Lord made".{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=122}} To the host of young surgeons Thomas trained during the 1940s,{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=109}} he became a figure of legend, the model of a dexterous and efficient cutting surgeon. "Even if you'd never seen surgery before, you could do it because Vivien made it look so simple," the renowned surgeon [[Denton Cooley]]{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=92}} told ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]'' magazine in 1989. "There wasn't a false move, not a wasted motion, when he operated." Surgeons like Cooley, along with Alex Haller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Vivien |title=Pioneering Research in Surgical Shock and Cardiovascular Surgery|pages=1154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Spencer,{{sfn|Thomas|1985|pp=175, 194}} [[Rowena Spencer]],{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=121}} and others credited Thomas with teaching them the surgical technique that placed them at the forefront of medicine in the United States. Despite the deep respect Thomas was accorded by these surgeons and by the many black lab technicians he trained at Hopkins, he was not well paid.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=130–135}}  He sometimes resorted to working as a [[bartender]], often at Blalock's parties. This led to the peculiar circumstance of his serving drinks to people he had been teaching earlier in the day. Eventually, after negotiations on his behalf by Blalock, he became the highest paid technician at Johns Hopkins by 1946, and by far the highest paid African-American on the institution's rolls.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=142}} Although Thomas never wrote or spoke publicly about his ongoing desire to return to college and obtain a medical degree, his widow, the late Clara Flanders Thomas, revealed in a 1987 interview with ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]'' writer Katie McCabe that her husband had clung to the possibility of further education throughout the blue baby period and had only abandoned the idea with great reluctance. Mrs. Thomas stated that in 1947, Thomas had investigated the possibility of enrolling in college and pursuing his dream of becoming a doctor, but had been deterred by the inflexibility of [[Morgan State University]], which refused to grant him credit for life experience and insisted that he fulfill the standard freshman requirements. Realizing that he would be 50 years old by the time he completed college and medical school, Thomas decided to give up the idea of further education.

==Relations with Blalock==
Blalock's approach to the issue of Thomas's race was complicated and contradictory throughout their 34-year partnership. On the one hand, he defended his choice of Thomas to his superiors at Vanderbilt and to Hopkins colleagues, and he insisted that Thomas accompany him in the operating room during the first series of tetralogy operations. On the other hand, there were limits to his tolerance, especially when it came to issues of pay, academic acknowledgment, and his social interaction outside of work. Tension with Blalock continued to build when he failed to recognize the contributions that Thomas had made in the world-famous blue baby procedure, which led to a rift in their relationship. Thomas was absent in official articles about the procedure, as well as in team pictures that included all of the doctors involved in the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Vivien |title=Mr. Vivien Thomas Discusses Dr. Alfred Blalock |page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Blalock's death from cancer in 1964 at the age of 65,{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=214}} Thomas stayed at Hopkins for 15 more years. In his role as director of Surgical Research Laboratories, he mentored a number of African-American lab technicians as well as Hopkins' first black cardiac resident, [[Levi Watkins]], Jr., whom Thomas assisted with his groundbreaking work in the use of the [[Defibrillator|automatic implantable defibrillator]].

Thomas' nephew, Koco Eaton, graduated from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, trained by many of the physicians his uncle had trained. Eaton trained in [[orthopedics]] and is now the team doctor for the [[Tampa Bay Rays]].

==Institutional acknowledgment==
In 1968, the surgeons Thomas trained — who had then become chiefs of surgical departments throughout America — commissioned the painting of his portrait (by Bob Gee, oil on canvas, 1969, The Johns Hopkins Alan Mason Chesney Medical Archives){{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=219}} and arranged to have it hung next to Blalock's in the lobby of the Alfred Blalock Clinical Sciences Building.

In 1976, [[Johns Hopkins University]] presented Thomas with an [[honorary doctorate]].&lt;ref name = "JHMI" /&gt; Because of certain restrictions, he received an Honorary [[Doctor of Laws]], rather than a [[medical doctorate]], but it did allow the staff and students of [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] and [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]] to call him doctor.  After having worked there for 37 years, Thomas was also finally appointed to the faculty of the School of Medicine as Instructor of Surgery. Due to his lack of an official medical degree, he was never allowed to operate on a living patient.&lt;ref name = "JHMI" /&gt;

In July 2005, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine began the practice of splitting incoming first-year students into four colleges, each named for famous Hopkins faculty members who had major impacts on the history of medicine. Thomas was chosen as one of the four, along with [[Helen B. Taussig|Helen Taussig]], [[Florence Sabin]], and [[Daniel Nathans]].

==Legacy==
Following his retirement in 1979, Thomas began work on an autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;''Partners of the Heart: Vivien Thomas and his Work with Alfred Blalock'', {{ISBN|0-8122-1634-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died of [[pancreatic cancer]] on November 26, 1985, and the book was published just days later. Having learned about Thomas on the day of his death, [[Washingtonian (magazine)|''Washingtonian'']] writer Katie McCabe brought his story to public attention in a 1989 article entitled "Like Something the Lord Made", which won the 1990 [[National Magazine Award]] for Feature Writing and inspired filmmaker [[Andrea Kalin]] to make the [[PBS]] documentary ''Partners of the Heart'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/dome/0301/close_up.cfm |title=Almost a Miracle |publisher=Hopkinsmedicine.org |date= |accessdate=March 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302102051/http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/dome/0301/close_up.cfm |archivedate=March 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was broadcast in 2003 on PBS's [[American Experience]] and won the [[Erik Barnouw Award|Organization of American Historians's Erik Barnouw Award]] for Best History Documentary in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oah.org/activities/awards/barnouw/winners.html OAH.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603010229/http://www.oah.org/activities/awards/barnouw/winners.html |date=June 3, 2009 }}, OAH Erik Barnouw Award Winners&lt;/ref&gt; McCabe's article, brought to Hollywood by Washington, D.C. dentist Irving Sorkin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/5649.html |title=Like Something the Lord Made; The Vivien Thomas Story |publisher=Washingtonian.com |date= |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed the basis for the [[Emmy]] and [[Peabody Award]]-winning 2004 HBO film ''[[Something the Lord Made]]''.

Thomas's legacy as an educator and scientist continued with the institution of the Vivien Thomas Young Investigator Awards, given by the Council on Cardiovascular Surgery and Anesthesiology beginning in 1996. In 1993, the [[Congressional Black Caucus Foundation]] instituted the Vivien Thomas Scholarship for Medical Science and Research sponsored by [[GlaxoSmithKline]]. In fall 2004, the [[Baltimore City Public School System]] opened the [[Vivien T. Thomas Medical Arts Academy]], and on January 29, 2008, [[MedStar Health]] unveiled the first "Rx for Success" program at the Academy, joining the conventional curriculum with specialized coursework geared to the health care professions. In the halls of the school hangs a replica of Thomas's portrait commissioned by his surgeon-trainees in 1969.{{sfn|Thomas|1985|p=219}} The ''Journal of Surgical Case Reports'' announced in January 2010 that its annual prizes for the best case report written by a doctor and best case report written by a medical student would be named after Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jscr.co.uk JSCR Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wilfred Bouma''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈʋɪlfrəd ˈbʌu̯ma}};&lt;ref&gt;''Wilfred'' in isolation: {{IPA-nl|ˈʋɪlfrət|}}.&lt;/ref&gt; born 15 June 1978) is a Dutch former [[association football|footballer]] who played most notably for [[PSV Eindhoven]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]]. Bouma was a technically refined left back or centre back known for his hard working nature, defensive positioning and tackling ability.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in [[Helmond]], [[North Brabant]], Bouma started his career at amateur club SV Rood-Wit '62 before joining [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] on a youth contract in 1994. The PSV head coach at the time, [[Aad de Mos]] handed him his professional debut against [[Willem II (football club)|Willem II]] on 26 October 1994 which his team lost 2–1. After not featuring for a long time, he was loaned out to [[MVV]] in 1996 and played in the [[Eerste Divisie]] where he scored seven goals in 18 games. The following season, he scored sixteen goals in 33 games after helping his team back into the [[Eredivisie]]. After impressing at [[Fortuna Sittard]] in 1998–99, he was drafted back into the PSV squad the following season.

===PSV===
At PSV, he played as a left winger and as forward because of his quick pace and direct passing, teaming up with [[Arnold Jan Bruggink|Arnold Bruggink]] and at times, with [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]].

When [[Arthur Numan]] departed to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] at the end of the 1999–00 season, Bouma was moved to left-back where he had to compete with Danish international [[Jan Heintze]].

With the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] qualifiers entering its crucial stages, Bouma was handed his international debut for the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]] against the [[Republic of Ireland]] on 2 September 2000. In the [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2004]] tournament in Portugal, he was chosen by [[Dick Advocaat]] to play as a central defender and he has also retained that spot while playing for PSV under [[Guus Hiddink]] in the 2004–05 season.

===Aston Villa===
[[File:Wilfred Bouma Chelsea v. Aston Villa 1.png|thumb|100px|Bouma before an [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] game in 2007]]
Just before the close of the international [[transfer window]], Bouma signed for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on 30 August 2005 for £3.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Villa land Dutch defender Bouma| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4194370.stm| publisher=BBC Sport| date = 30 August 2005| accessdate = 12 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He struggled to establish himself during the 2005–06 campaign at [[Villa Park]], as his debut season was heavily tarnished with injuries. However, when [[Martin O'Neill]] replaced boss [[David O'Leary]], Bouma – after recovering from a hamstring injury – replaced stand-in left-back [[Gareth Barry]].

Under O'Neill, Bouma begun to flourish during the [[2006–07 Aston Villa F.C. season|2006–07 season]] – he established himself as first choice left back and went on to total 28 appearances in the claret and blue shirt. This led to Bouma becoming a cult hero at [[Villa Park]], most notably for his strong tackling, and determined nature in defence. This turn in form also attributed to Bouma reclaiming his place in the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch National Team]], playing in the friendly against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] in February 2007, the tour of Asia in June 2007 and the following [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying]] fixtures.

On 9 February 2008, Bouma – who was in the process of making his 76th appearance in claret and blue – netted his only goal for the club in the 48th minute of the match against [[Newcastle United]]. The deflected goal levelled the game at 1–1, before a hat-trick by teammate [[John Carew]], wrapped up a 4–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7223963.stm|title=Aston Villa 4–1 Newcastle|publisher=BBC|date=9 February 2008|accessdate=2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon returning from international duty for [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]] at [[Euro 2008]], Bouma participated in both legs of Aston Villa's [[2008 UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]] third round tie against [[Odense BK|Odense]], however the second leg at [[Villa Park]] on 26 July 2008 was marred by a serious ankle injury to the full-back. Bouma caught his studs on the turf as he attempted to challenge opposition forward [[Baye Djiby Fall]]. Initially, the injury looked like a horrific break, however reports later confirmed that Bouma had suffered a dislocation, an injury which looked set to keep him out until October. His recovery however took much longer. Bouma's increasing importance to the Villa cause, as well as his 'cult-hero status' was noted as he was carried off early in the tie whilst being accompanied by a 30,000 strong chant of support by the Villa faithful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/7527180.stm|title = Horror injury for Villa's Bouma |publisher=BBC|date=26 July 2008 |accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 2008, Bouma signed a new two-year deal at [[Villa Park]] with the option of a third year.

In January 2009 it was announced that Bouma, along with other long-term absentee [[John Carew]] had returned to full training. He was scheduled to return on 16 February for the reserves but he pulled out at the last minute because he "felt sore". On 2 March 2009, Bouma finally played 90 minutes in a 4–3 win in a reserve match against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. However, he suffered a setback on his road to recovery in April after learning bone fragments had broken away from his ankle, and underwent surgery soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/8004750.stm|title = Ankle injury ends Bouma's season|publisher=BBC|date=17 April 2009 |accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 September 2009, after being out of action for fourteen months, it was announced that Bouma had resumed full training with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/8259666.stm|title=Bouma resumes training for Villa|publisher=BBC|date=16 September 2009 |accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bouma's injury worries were not yet over. Yet to make a return to Villa's first team, Bouma suffered another setback and was again out of action with a stubbed toe injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~1895909,00.html|title=Bouma Suffers Another Setback|publisher=AVFC|date=6 December 2009|accessdate=30 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923181302/http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~1895909,00.html|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 January 2010, Aston Villa announced that Bouma had finally returned to full training following eighteen months of absence through injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~1948306,00.html|title=Bouma is Back|publisher=Aston Villa Football Club|date=29 January 2010|accessdate=30 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923181304/http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~1948306,00.html|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Bouma played a full ninety minutes for the Aston Villa reserves in February 2010, he never made a return to the first team. On 6 May 2010, Aston Villa confirmed that Bouma was set to leave the club at the end of the [[2009–10 Aston Villa F.C. season|2009–2010]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teamtalk.com/news/2483/6137002/Bouma-shown-the-exit-door-by-Villa|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509164533/http://www.teamtalk.com/news/2483/6137002/Bouma-shown-the-exit-door-by-Villa|archivedate=9 May 2010|title=Bouma shown the exit door by Villa|publisher=Teamtalk.com|date=6 May 2010 |accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bouma said his goodbyes to the Villa faithful during half-time of the home defeat to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn]] in their final league game, later stating that he intended to address the fans but "just couldn't do it" after becoming too emotional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/bouma-thanks-aston-villa-fans-emotional-farewell-868971|title=Bouma thanks Aston Villa fans for emotional farewell|work=Tribal Football|date=28 May 2010|accessdate=28 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601012548/http://tribalfootball.com/bouma-thanks-aston-villa-fans-emotional-farewell-868971|archivedate=1 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to PSV===
On 26 June 2010, it was revealed that Bouma's former club [[PSV Eindhoven]] had offered him a trial at the club in an attempt to revive his career and he joined up with the rest of the PSV squad for pre-season training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Wilfred Bouma offered trial at PSV| url = http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/aston-villa-fc/aston-villa-news/2010/06/26/aston-villa-wilfred-bouma-offered-trial-at-psv-97319-26731965/| work=Birmingham Mail| date = 26 June 2010| accessdate = 26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bouma later sealed his return on 30 August 2010, signing a two-year contract with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Bouma seals homecoming to PSV| url = http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=1521277.html?| publisher=UEFA| date = 30 August 2010| accessdate = 30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bouma scored his first goal since his return to the Netherlands in a 3–0 home win against [[VVV-Venlo]]. Bouma played 66 minutes during a record [[Eredivisie]] 10–0 victory over [[Feyenoord]].

Bouma continued his good goal scoring form when he netted his third goal in only 16 league games during the 0–3 away win against [[VVV-Venlo]]. On 24 February 2011 Bouma was handed the captain's armband for the final five minutes of the [[UEFA Europa League]] match against [[Lille OSC]] that PSV went on to win 3–1 on the day and 5–3 on aggregate.

==International career==
[[File:Wilfred Bouma Oranje.jpg|thumb|150px|Bouma training with the Netherlands.]]
Bouma was a member of the Dutch squad at the [[1995 FIFA World Youth Championship]]. As of July 2008, Wilfred Bouma has played for the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] 35 times, scoring twice. Bouma made his debut on 2 September 2000, in the 2–2 draw with the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]. Several steady appearances followed in the coming years, including 4 appearances at [[Euro 2004]], whilst playing as a centre-back. Bouma was included in the Dutch squad for [[Euro 2008]], and he made 2 appearances, coming on as a 78th substitute against [[France national football team|France]] and playing the full 90 minutes against [[Romania national football team|Romania]]. Bouma's only two goals at international level came within 4 months of each other, as the defender netted in the 3–2 defeat to [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] in the group stage of Euro 2004. He then went on to net the opener against [[Republic of Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]] in October of the same year, in a match which ended 2–2.

'''William Kenneth Hartmann''' (born June 6, 1939) is a noted [[planetary science|planetary scientist]], artist, author, and writer. He was the first to convince the scientific mainstream that the [[Giant impact hypothesis|Earth had once been hit by a planet sized body]] ([[Theia (planet)|Theia]]), creating both the [[moon]] and the Earth's 23.5° tilt.&lt;ref name=Cat1&gt;''[[Birth of the Planet]], November 24, 2008, [[Channel 4]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Pennsylvania]] in 1939,&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book |title=Contemporary Authors: New Revision Series |author=Watson, T. |date=2005 |publisher=Cengage Gale |isbn=9780787678944 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E8NC9lyOiM4C |accessdate=2015-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; he received his B.S. in physics from [[Pennsylvania State University]], and an M.S. in geology and PhD in astronomy from the [[University of Arizona]]. His career spans over 40 years, from work in the early 1960s with [[Gerard P. Kuiper|Gerard Kuiper]] on [[Mare Orientale]], and work on the [[Mariner 9]] Mars mapping project, to current work on the [[Mars Global Surveyor]] imaging team. He is currently a senior scientist at the [[Planetary Science Institute]].

He has long been one of America's leading [[space art]]ists (strongly influenced by [[Chesley Bonestell]]), and has written and illustrated numerous books on the [[history of Earth]] and the [[Solar System]], often in collaboration with artist [[Ron Miller (artist and author)|Ron Miller]].

Hartmann is a Fellow of the [[International Association of Astronomical Artists]]. His written work also includes textbooks, short fiction, and novels, the most recent being published in 2003. In 1997 he was the first recipient of the ''[[Carl Sagan Medal]] for Excellence in Public Communication in [[Planetary Science]]'' from the [[American Astronomical Society]], [[Division for Planetary Sciences]].

Hartmann was a member of the 1966–1968 University of Colorado UFO Project (informally known as the [[Condon Committee]]), a controversial{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} public study of [[UFO]]s sponsored by the U.S. Air Force. He primarily investigated photographic evidence, and rejected most as unreliable or inconclusive; in his studies published in the Committee's final report, he concluded two cases - Great Falls (motion pictures of two bright light sources difficult to reconcile with known aircraft) and McMinnville (two photographs of a saucer-shaped craft)&lt;ref&gt;Condon Report: Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects (1968), 119.&lt;/ref&gt; - were unexplained and particularly noteworthy as probative evidence of the reality of UFOs.

Asteroid [[3341 Hartmann]] is named after him.

[[File:Swetlana_Alexijewitsch_2013.jpg|thumb|right|[[Svetlana Alexievich]], born in Ukraine but grew up in Belarus. Won the 2015 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]]]
The modern-day characteristics of '''women in Belarus''' evolved from the events that happened in the [[history of Belarus]], particularly when the "concept of equal rights for women was first developed and substantiated in the late 16th century". The so-called Grand Duchy Charter of 1588 - one of the most important legal documents in [[Belarus]]ian history - protected the dignity of Belarusian women under the law.&lt;ref name&gt;[http://un.by/en/publications/thema/belwomen/19-02-04-4.html Belarusian Women as seen Through an Era], United Nations in Belarus.&lt;/ref&gt; Women in Belarus and their contribution to [[Culture of Belarus|Belarusian society]] is celebrated annually on the 8th of March, during [[International Women's Day]].&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;

== Population ==
In 2000, 53% of the population of Belarus was female. The 2017 estimated median age for Belarusian women is 43.1.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bo.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Belarusian women fall into the 25-54 age range. 

&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The average [[life expectancy]] for Belarusian women is at around 74 years old.&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;[http://www.everyculture.com/A-Bo/Belarus.html#b Belarus], everyculture.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in society ==
According to tradition, setting food on the table is customarily done by women. Caring for the household and the rearing of children are also traditionally delegated to them.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;
{{Expand section|date=June 2013}}

== Organizations for women ==
Feminist groups in Belarus first appeared in 1991, and then more were formed onwards. These organizations included the Union of Women in Belarus (formerly known as the Belarusian Committee of Soviet Women), the League of Women in Belarus, the Committee of Soldiers' Mothers, the Women's Christian-Democratic Movement, the Belarusian feminist movement "For the Renaissance of the Fatherland", the League of Women-Electors, and the Women's Liberal Association.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;

== Gender rights ==
Married women in Belarus are entitled to retain personal and private property, income, investments, and other assets earned by them.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;
