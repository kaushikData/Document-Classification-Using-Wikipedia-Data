'''''Boerenjongens''''' ({{IPA-nl|buːrə(n)ˈjɔŋə(n)s}}) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] dish of [[raisins]] soaked in [[brandy]]. The name means "farmer boys" in [[Dutch language|Dutch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van der Sijs|first=Nicoline|title=Cookies, coleslaw, &amp; Stoops: The influence of Dutch on the North American Languages|year=2009|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|location=Amsterdam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qIsDdUSYJMIC&amp;pg=PA121}}&lt;/ref&gt; This recipe is especially popular with older [[Dutch people|Dutch]] people and traditionally consumed at holidays or birthdays. In the city of [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] and other cities in the countryside like [[Enschede]] there is often boerenjongens-flavoured ice cream for sale.

In [[United States|America]], it is sometimes made with [[whiskey]] instead of brandy.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

A variation to this recipe, apricots in ''brandewijn'', is called ''[[boerenmeisjes]]'' ({{lang-en|farmer girls}}).

The '''Catholic Church in [[Ivory Coast]]''' is part of the worldwide [[Catholic Church]], under the spiritual leadership of the [[Pope]] in [[Rome]]. Catholicism arrived in Ivory Coast through the arrival of [[France|French]] settlers.

The Catholic Church is the world's largest Christian church, and its largest religious grouping. There are an estimated 2.8 million baptised Catholics in Ivory Coast, 17.2% of the population (according to the 2014 Census),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ins.ci/n/documents/RGPH2014_expo_dg.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in 15 [[Diocese]]s. There are 800 [[priest]]s and 1,500 men and women in religious orders.

The [[Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro]] in [[Yamoussoukro]], is the largest church in the world, larger even than [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome.

'''Sino–Lithuanian relations''' ({{lang-lt|Lietuvos-Kinijos santykiai}}) are the [[bilateralism|bilateral]] [[International relations|foreign relations]] between the [[Two Chinas]] and [[Lithuania]]. PR China has an embassy in [[Vilnius]]. Lithuania has an embassy in [[Beijing]].

Sino-Lithuanian relations dates back to 1921 when the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] recognized Lithuania until its occupation and subsequent annexation by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1940. Modern diplomatic relations between 2 countries were established on 14 September 1991. Both the PRC and ROC did not [[State continuity of the Baltic states|recognize]] the incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union.

In 1992, Embassy of China was established in Vilnius, in 1995, Embassy of Lithuania was established in Beijing.

[[File:RadioUniversidadeDeCoimbra2010.jpg|thumb|RUC main studio]]
'''Coimbra University Radio''' (Portuguese: '''Rádio Universidade de Coimbra''' - '''RUC''') is a [[university radio]] station of the [[Coimbra Academic Association]] ([[students' union]]) of the [[University of Coimbra]] in [[Coimbra]], [[Portugal]].

It broadcasts on 107.9 FM (also broadcasts on-line). The Center of Experimental Radio was founded in the 1940s but it was only on 1 March 1986&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ruc.pt/historia/&lt;/ref&gt; that the radio obtained the authorization to broadcast on FM.&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Sousa Lamy ''A Academia de Coimbra, 1537-1990: história, praxe, boémia'' 1990 Page 138 "Rádio Universidade de Coimbra (RUC) A 1/3/1986 iniciou as suas emissões, sendo-lhe concedido o alvará de licenciamento a 30 de Março de 1989."&lt;/ref&gt;

The studios and offices of this university radio station are located in the main building of the Associação Académica de Coimbra, in the city centre. One of its trademarks is that there are no set playlists for any of the programs broadcast. This allows for an exceptionally wide range of musical genres.

The radio gives courses in Programming, Technic and News, that students from the University of Coimbra can join.

For its 25th anniversary, the radio hosted concerts of the indie Swedish band [[the Radio Dept.]],&lt;ref&gt;http://briefing.pt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10162:radio-universidade-de-coimbra-celebra-25-anos-com-concerto-pelos-suecos-the-radio-dept-&amp;catid=49:lusa&amp;Itemid=65 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522160029/http://briefing.pt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10162%3Aradio-universidade-de-coimbra-celebra-25-anos-com-concerto-pelos-suecos-the-radio-dept-&amp;catid=49%3Alusa&amp;Itemid=65 |date=2011-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Eleanor Friedberger]] from the rock duo [[The Fiery Furnaces]] and the Welsh songwriter [[Euros Childs]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15477">'''East Asian studies''' is a distinct [[multidisciplinary]] field of scholarly enquiry and education that promotes a broad [[humanistic]] understanding of [[East Asia]] past and present. The field includes the study of the region's [[East Asian cultural sphere|culture]], [[Adoption of Chinese literary culture|written language]], history, and political institutions. East Asian Studies is located within the broader field of [[Asian studies]] and is also [[interdisciplinary]] in character, incorporating elements of the [[social sciences]] ([[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[politics]] etc.) and [[humanities]] ([[literature]], [[history]], [[art]], [[film]], [[music]], etc.), among others. The field encourages scholars from diverse disciplines to exchanges ideas on scholarship as it relates to the East Asian experience and the experience of East Asia in the world. In addition, the field encourages scholars to educate others to have a deeper understanding of, and appreciation and respect for, all that is East Asia and, therefore, to promote peaceful human integration worldwide.

At universities throughout North America and the Western World, the study of East Asian Humanities is traditionally housed in EALC (''East Asian Languages and Civilizations'' or ''Cultures'') departments, which run majors in Chinese and Japanese Language and Literature, and sometimes Korean Language and Literature. East Asian Studies programs, on the other hand, are typically interdisciplinary centers that bring together literary scholars, historians, anthropologists, sociologists, political scientists, etc. from their various departments and schools to promote instructional programs, conferences, and lecture series of common interest. East Asian Studies centers also often run interdisciplinary undergraduate and master's degree programs in East Asian Studies.

==Subfields==
;[[Chinese studies|Sinology]]
The sub-field dedicated to [[China]], [[Chinese history]] [[Chinese culture]], [[Chinese literature]] and the [[Chinese language]]. In the context of the [[Republic of China]] also specified as [[Taiwan studies]] ([[Academia Sinica]]).

;[[Japan studies|Japanology]]
The sub-field dedicated to [[Japan]], [[Japanese culture]], [[Japanese history]],  [[Japanese literature]] and the [[Japanese language]]. The foundation of the [[Asiatic Society of Japan]] at [[Yokohama]] in 1872 by men such as [[Ernest Satow]] and [[Frederick Victor Dickins]] was an important event in the development of Japanese studies as an academic discipline.

;[[Korean studies|Koreanology]]
The sub-field dedicated to [[Korea]], [[Korean culture]],  [[History of Korea|Korean history]], [[Korean literature]], and the [[Korean language]]. The term Korean studies first began to be used in the 1940s, but did not attain widespread currency until [[South Korea]] rose to economic prominence in the 1970s. In 1991, the South Korean government established the [[Korea Foundation]] to promote Korean studies.

;[[Mongolian studies]]
The sub-field dedicated to [[Mongolia]], [[Mongolian culture]], [[Mongolian literature]] and the [[Mongolian language]]. Mongolian studies are also presented as a sub-field of the study of [[Inner Asia]] (as opposed to East Asia). The [[American Center for Mongolian Studies]] was founded in 2002.

==History==
In universities across the United States, as part of the [[opposition to the Vietnam War]] in the 1960s, younger faculty and graduate students criticized the field for complicity in what they saw as [[American imperialism]]. In particular, the [[Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars]] debated and published alternative approaches not centered in the United States or funded, as many American programs were, by the American government or major foundations. They charged that Japan was held up as a model of non-revolutionary modernization and the field focused on [[modernization theory]] in order to fend off revolution. 

In the following decades, many critics were inspired by [[Edward Said]]'s 1978 book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'', while others, writing from the point of view of the quantitative or theoretical social sciences, saw area studies in general and East Asian studies in particular, as amorphous and lacking in rigor.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Farquhar, James Hevia, "Culture and Postwar American Historiography of China," ''positions'' 1.2 (1993): 486-525; Andrew Gordon, “Rethinking Area Studies, Once More” ''The Journal of Japanese Studies'' 30. 2, (Summer 2004): 417-429.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critiques were also mounted from other points in the political spectrum. Ramon H. Myers and Thomas A. Metzger, two scholars based at the generally conservative [[Hoover Institution]], charged that "the 'revolution' paradigm increasingly overshadowed the 'modernization' paradigm" and "this fallacy has become integral to much of the writing on modern Chinese history", discrediting or ignoring other factors in the history of modern China.&lt;ref&gt;"Sinological Shadows: The State of Modern China Studies in the United States," The Washington Quarterly (Spring 1980): 87-114, quote at p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, notable scholars of East Asian studies have long occupied professorships at prominent universities in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, France and Italy, while recent publications also suggest that the “Nordic countries offer some unique contributions in the field of East Asian studies.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hebert | first = David | title = International Perspectives on Translation, Education, and Innovation in Japanese and Korean Societies | publisher = Springer | location = New York | url = https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319684321 | year = 2018 }} {{ISBN|9783319684321}}, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Essex South West''' was a [[European Parliament constituency|constituency]] of the [[European Parliament]] located in the [[United Kingdom]], electing one [[Member of the European Parliament]] by the [[first-past-the-post]] electoral system. Created in [[European Parliament election, 1979 (United Kingdom)|1979]] for the first elections to the European Parliament, it was abolished in 1994 and succeeded by the constituencies of [[Essex West and Hertfordshire East (European Parliament constituency)|Essex West and Hertfordshire East]] and [[Essex South (European Parliament constituency)|Essex South]].

==Boundaries==

On its creation in 1979, it consisted of the [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|parliamentary constituencies]] of [[Basildon (UK Parliament constituency)|Basildon]], [[Brentwood and Ongar (UK Parliament constituency)|Brentwood and Ongar]], [[Chelmsford (UK Parliament constituency)|Chelmsford]], [[Epping Forest (UK Parliament constituency)|Epping Forest]], [[Harlow (UK Parliament constituency)|Harlow]] and [[Thurrock (UK Parliament constituency)|Thurrock]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Boundary Commission for England]], ''European Assembly Constituencies'', December 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1984 boundary changes based on the new UK parliamentary constituencies created in 1983, it consisted of Basildon, [[Billericay (UK Parliament constituency)|Billericay]], Brentwood and Ongar, [[Castle Point (UK Parliament constituency)|Castle Point]], Chelmsford, Epping Forest, Harlow and Thurrock.&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament Information Office, ''MEPs and their constituencies'', December 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The constituency was abolished in 1994. Brentwood and Ongar, Chelmsford, Epping Forest and Harlow became part of [[Essex West and Hertfordshire East (European Parliament constituency)|Essex West and Hertfordshire East]]. Basildon, Billericay, Castle Point and Thurrock were now part of the new constituency of [[Essex South (European Parliament constituency)|Essex South]].&lt;ref&gt;''The European Parliament 1994-1999 : MEPs and European constituencies in the United Kingdom'', London : UK Office of the European Parliament, November 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Estonian Space Office''' ('''ESO'''; {{lang-et|'''Eesti Kosmosebüroo'''}}) is the unit established within {{Interlanguage link multi|Enterprise Estonia|et|3=Ettevõtluse Arendamise Sihtasutus}} by the [[Government of Estonia]] to facilitate membership in the [[European Space Agency]] and related commercial and research ties. In addition ESO serves as a contact point with the [[International Astronautical Federation|IAF]], [[European Association for the International Space Year|EURISY]] and [[European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites|EUMETSAT]] in procurement-related matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About the Space Office | url = http://www.eas.ee/kosmos/en/estonian-space-office/about-the-space-office |work = eas.ee | publisher = EAS | accessdate = 14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ESO is not a [[space agency]]. State space policy as it exists is managed through the Space Affairs Council at the [[Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications]]. ESO functions as a centre for technology and business competence alongside [[Tartu Observatory]] which has responsibility for space science, space exploration and remote sensing. Various activities within the [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development]] of the European Union for education, science and innovation, including funding for space programs, are coordinated by the [[Archimedes Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Estonian Space Governance System and Activities Today | url = http://www.eas.ee/kosmos/en/estonia-and-space/estonian-space-governance-system |work = eas.ee | publisher = EAS | accessdate = 14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, the [[Riigikogu]] has had a 'Space Studies Support Group' (''Kosmose valdkonna toetusrühm'') currently chaired by [[Anne Sulling]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6842">'''Etiquette in Europe''' is not uniform.  Even within the [[regions of Europe]], etiquette may not be uniform: within a single country there may be differences in [[Norm (sociology)|customs]], especially where there are different linguistic groups, as in [[Switzerland]] where there are [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] speakers.&lt;ref name=PiE&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8h6abwB15Q0C|title=Politeness in Europe|author=Leo Hickey, Miranda Stewart|year=2005|isbn=1-85359-737-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this heterogeneity, many points of etiquette have spread through Europe and many features are shared. The ancient Roman Empire is a historical source, and the cosmopolitan royalty and also nobility were effective in spreading etiquette throughout Europe. For example, in the [[Palace of Versailles]], where French nobility was concentrated, a complicated etiquette was developed.

==Language and forms of address==

It is never acceptable to write an anonymous letter or one that purports to be signed by somebody other than the writer (but does not make that clear).

Many languages use different 2nd person pronouns to denote formality or familiarity when addressing people (the [[T–V distinction]]). This also applies in common phrases such as "How are you?".&lt;ref&gt;Hervey Sandor, Ian Higgins, Sandor G J Hervey. (2002) ''Thinking French Translation'', Routledge (UK). p. 46. {{ISBN|0-415-25522-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of an inappropriately familiar form may be seen as derogatory, insulting or even aggressive. Conversely, forms that are inappropriately formal may be seen as impolitely snobbish&lt;ref&gt;Michel Walter Pharand. (2001) ''Bernard Shaw and the French'', University Press of Florida. p. 113. {{ISBN|0-8130-1828-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or distant.

The way politeness is expressed varies greatly with language and region. For example, addressing a person with an honorific or title may be expected in some languages, but seen as intrusive or too formal in others.

In many parts of Europe, using someone's first name also denotes a certain level of friendship. In social interactions with strangers, the last name and/or more formal mode of address is used, usually until the people involved agree to move to an informal level. However, this may not apply among young people, among members of particular groups (e.g. students) or in informal settings. Also among countries that border each other vast differences can be noticed in the use of titles, first names and pronounces{{clarifyme|date=January 2017}}, as is the case in the Netherlands compared with Belgium and Germany.&lt;ref name="1,2122,,00.html"&gt;[http://www.dhl-usa.com/usgov/isr/culture/1,2122,,00.html Cultural Tips] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527233457/http://www.dhl-usa.com/usgov/isr/culture/1,2122,,00.html |date=May 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flowers==
&lt;!-- Please only put this image and its caption back in the article if you have a good reference that proves the caption's statement is true. Also please specify which countries. Thanks.
[[File:Chrysanthemums.jpg|thumb|[[Chrysanthemums]] are only appropriate for [[funerals]].]] --&gt;
In some countries, such as in Italy, [[chrysanthemums]] are given only at funerals. In France, red roses are given to the beloved person when the giver is in [[love]].&lt;ref&gt; [Mitschke &amp; Tano (2011). Espaces:Rendez-vous avec le monde francophone. pg.308.] &lt;/ref&gt; In [[Finland]], the same applies except that [[Graduation|school leavers]] are often given red roses on passing their [[matriculation examination]] ([[abitur]]).&lt;ref name="Virtual Finland"&gt;[http://finland.fi/public/default.aspx?contentid=162939&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US thisisFINLAND: With free, high-quality education for all]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hats and coats==
Among many segments of the European population, for example, in the United Kingdom, it is considered impolite to wear a hat or other head covering indoors, especially in churches, schools, private homes and respected public institutions. In churches, however, ladies may be exempt from this rule.

Wearing coats, boots or other outer garments inside someone’s home is often frowned upon as well.  Sitting down to eat at table wearing a hat or coat etc. is even worse. Also one should remove one's hat when showing deference. Removing one's hat is also a form of respectful greeting: the origin of this is that knights were expected to remove their helmets when meeting their king; not doing so would be a sign of mistrust and hostility.&lt;ref&gt;Turunen, Ari, Partanen, Markus. Uusi ulkokultaisen käytöksen kirja. Atena, Jyväskylä, 2007. S. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Money==
Talking or asking about one's personal wealth, possessions or success in business is widely viewed as vulgar. People will rarely say how much money they make or have in the bank nor will they request such information from someone else. It is impolite to ask colleagues about their salary and in some places of work it is forbidden.&lt;ref name="loonzakje"&gt;[http://www.loonwijzer.be/index.php?pid=85 De Belg laat niet graag in zijn loonzakje kijken] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110231257/http://www.loonwijzer.be/index.php?pid=85 |date=2006-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even elsewhere, for example where government employees' salaries are publicly known, it is still considered extremely rude to ask individuals how much they earn.

==Exposure==
In Europe, what qualifies as [[indecent exposure]] includes generally at least the exposure of genitalia or anus. In case of women, exposing nipples is not seen as proper conduct, but this is not always considered criminal, and depends on individual countries' nudity laws. For the issue of breastfeeding babies in public, see ''[[Breastfeeding in public]]''. The intentional exposure of bare buttocks towards someone, [[mooning]], is a deliberate insult. However, [[public nudity]] may be allowed in some circumstances, which vary by country. Within Dutch society nudity is less sexualized as in for example the [[English-speaking world]] and resembles more the views of other Northern European cultures, as can be seen in the [[Sauna in the Dutch language area|sauna]] customs. In [[sauna]]s, the rules about nudity vary according to the country. On nudist beaches, multigender saunas and in the changing rooms of swimming pools in some countries, keeping one's clothes on is frowned upon. Here it is good manners to undress.

An '''expanded granular sludge bed''' ('''EGSB''') reactor  is a variant of the [[upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion]] (UASB) concept for [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic wastewater treatment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uasb.org:80/discover/agsb.htm |title=Anaerobic Granular Sludge Bed Reactor Technology |last1=Field |first1=Jim |last2=Sierra |first2=Reyes |date=2003-04-27 |publisher=University of Arizona |archive-date=2006-07-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060706215607/http://www.uasb.org/discover/agsb.htm |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinguishing feature is that a faster rate of upward-flow velocity is designed for the wastewater passing through the sludge bed. The increased flux permits partial expansion (fluidisation) of the granular sludge bed, improving wastewater-sludge contact as well as enhancing segregation of small inactive suspended particle from the sludge bed. The increased flow velocity is either accomplished by utilizing tall reactors, or by incorporating an effluent recycle (or both). A scheme depicting the EGSB design concept is shown in this [https://web.archive.org/web/20060706215607/http://www.uasb.org/discover/agsb.htm#figure%201 EGSB diagram].

The EGSB design is appropriate for low strength soluble wastewaters (less than 1 to 2 g soluble [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]]/l) or for wastewaters that contain inert or poorly biodegradable suspended particles which should not be allowed to accumulate in the sludge bed.

The '''Gharmi''', or '''Garmi people''' ({{lang-tg|Ғармӣ}}, {{lang-tg|Ğarmî/Ƣarmī/غرمى}}), are one of the original groups of [[Tajik people|Tajiks]], originate from the [[Rasht Valley]] in central [[Tajikistan]]. From the 1920s to 1955 there was a [[Gharm]] [[oblast]] in Tajikistan, and henceforth people from central Tajikistan were known as Gharmis. During the 1950s many Gharmis were forced to migrate from central Tajikistan to the [[Vakhsh River|Vakhsh River Valley]] in western Tajikistan. Gharmis were in large excluded from government positions which were dominated by individuals from [[Khujand]] and [[Kulob]]. Gharmis who settled in [[Qurghonteppa Oblast]] are frequently described as a [[clan]] group that found social niches in education and the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{

The '''Goseibai Shikimoku''' (御成敗式目) or the '''Formulary of Adjudications''' was the legal code of the [[Kamakura shogunate]] in [[Japan]], promulgated by third [[shikken]] [[Hōjō Yasutoki]] in 1232. It is also called '''Jōei Shikimoku''' (貞永式目) after the [[Japanese era name|era name]].

Before enacting the Goseibai Shikimoku, the Kamakura shogunate conducted trials without formal laws. After the [[Jōkyū War]], an increasing number of land disputes between its [[gokenin|vassals]], aristocrats and peasants made fair trials indispensable. Thereafter Hōjō Yasutoki compiled the outline with 51 article headings and 13 Hyojoshu (councilors) completed it.

Supplementary articles to the Goseibai Shikimoku, called Tsuika (追加), were issued afterward. The [[Muromachi shogunate]] also adopted the Goseibai Shikimoku as the basic law. The Goseibai Shikimoku was largely repealed during the [[Edo period]], though parts of it stayed in used until 1868, but was widely used as a textbook for writing in [[Terakoya|temple school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shikokuhenrotrail.com/japanhistory/kamakurahistory.html A Chronology of Japanese History]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Henry O'Neil de Hane Segrave''' (22 September 1896 &amp;ndash; 13 June 1930) was an early British pioneer in [[land speed record|land speed]] and [[water speed record]]s. Segrave, who set three land and one water record, was the first person to hold both titles simultaneously and the first person to travel at over {{convert|200|mph}} in a land vehicle. He died in an accident in 1930 shortly after setting a new world water speed record on [[Windermere]] in the [[Lake District]], England. The [[Segrave Trophy]] was established to commemorate his life.

==Early life==
Segrave, who was a British national, was born on 22 September 1896 in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] to an American mother and an Irish father. He was raised in [[Ireland]] and attended [[Eton College]] in [[England]].

==First World War==
In 1914 he gained a commission in the [[Royal Warwickshire Regiment]]. In January 1916 he joined the [[Royal Flying Corps]] where he served as a fighter pilot (he retained his commission in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment). He sustained wounds in 1915 and 1916. Segrave became a flight commander as a temporary [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in July 1916. After the war, he transferred to the [[Royal Air Force]] Administrative Branch in 1919 but soon resigned his commission due to his war injuries.

==Motor sports==
[[File:Henry Segrave at the 1922 French Grand Prix (4).jpg|thumb|Segrave at the [[1922 French Grand Prix]] held in [[Strasbourg]].]]
After the conclusion of the war, British motor manufacturers were starting to build more reliable and faster vehicles. Although motor racing was in its infancy, Segrave would soon become a championship winning driver.

In 1921 Segrave won the first long-distance car race to be run in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. The 200-mile Race, which was organised by the [[British Automobile Racing Club|Junior Car Club]] for 1,500 c.c. light cars, was held at [[Brooklands]] in Surrey. Segrave won in a [[Darracq and Company London|Darracq]]-made [[Talbot]] that were marketed as Talbot-Darracqs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|newspaper=[[Manchester Guardian]]|date= 24 October 1921|title=Segrave Triumphs at Brooklands|page=Page 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|title=Brooklands 200-mile Race Result|date= 16 November 1921|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year Segrave competed in his first ever [[French Grand Prix]], Darracq was reorganised as part of the [[Darracq and Company London#S.T.D. Motors|S.T.D. Motors]] conglomerate. To impress Breton automobile designer, [[Louis Coatalen]], in order to gain a place in the formidable Sunbeam-Talbot-Darrac Works team, Segrave, changed fourteen covers{{explanation needed|date=June 2018}} on his Talbot, a rebadged highly advanced [[Straight-eight engine|straight eight]] [[Overhead camshaft|dual overhead camshaft (dohc)]]  [[Grand Prix Sunbeams 1921, 1922 TT|1921 Sunbeam Grand Prix]].&lt;ref&gt;Segrave H O D (1928) The Lure of Speed, P. 88-89 and Nickols, Ian; Karslake, Kent (1956). Motoring Entente (1956), p.186&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1922 [[1922 French Grand Prix]], Segrave was forced to retire in his [[Grand Prix Sunbeams 1922]] because of chemical burns.&lt;ref&gt;H O D (1928) The Lure of Speed,  P. 121-122&lt;/ref&gt;

When he won the 1923 [[French Grand Prix]] in a [[Sunbeam Motor Car Company|Sunbeam]], he became the first [[British people|Briton]] to win a Grand Prix in a British car. In 1924 he won the [[San Sebastian Grand Prix]] at [[Circuito Lasarte]] (Spain). After a further win at [[Circuit of Miramas|Miramas]] in [[France]], he retired from racing to concentrate on speed records.

==Speed career==
===Land===
[[File:Golden Arrow (6315532497) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Segrave's ''[[Golden Arrow (land speed racer)|Golden Arrow]]'' at the [[National Motor Museum, Beaulieu]].]]
On 16 March 1926, Segrave set his first [[land speed record]] of {{convert|152.33|mph}} using ''Ladybird'', a 4-litre [[Sunbeam Tiger (1925)|Sunbeam Tiger]] on [[Ainsdale|Ainsdale beach]] at [[Southport]], England. This record was broken a month later by [[J.G. Parry-Thomas]] driving [[Babs (Land speed record car)|Babs]], a custom-built car with a 27-litre {{convert|450|hp|abbr=on}} V12 [[Liberty L-12|Liberty]] aero engine.

A year later he became the first person to travel over {{convert|200|mph}} when he regained the land speed record at the [[Daytona Beach Road Course]] on 29 March 1927. Using ''Mystery'' (but also known as 'the Slug'), a [[Sunbeam 1000 hp|1000 HP Sunbeam]], he recorded a speed of {{convert|203.79|mph}}.

On 11 March 1929, Segrave set his final land speed record again at [[Daytona Beach Road Course#World speed records|Daytona Beach]]. Using a new car designed for him by Captain [[Jack Irving]] and named the ''[[Golden Arrow (land speed racer)|Golden Arrow]]'' he set a new record of {{convert|231.45|mph}}. Segrave never attempted another land speed record after witnessing the high-speed death of American racing driver, [[Lee Bible]], who was trying to set a new land speed record on March 13, 1929, at [[Ormond Beach, Florida|Ormond Beach]], [[Florida]]. The ''Golden Arrow'', which was never used again, has only {{convert|18.74|mi}} on the clock. The vehicle is on display along with Segrave's [[Sunbeam 350HP]] and [[Sunbeam 1000 hp]] at the [[National Motor Museum, Beaulieu]].

On the 90th anniversary of Segrave setting his first historic record, his original Sunbeam racing car returned to Southport where it was driven down Ainsdale beach in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sunbeam car driven by Sir Henry Segrave returns to Southport|date=16 March 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-35822519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09943, Sir Henry Segrave.jpg|thumb|Segrave aboard ''Miss Alacrity'' in 1929.]]
Segrave had ''[[Miss England I]]'' built in 1928, in an attempt to retrieve the [[Harmsworth Trophy]] from the American [[Gar Wood]] whose series of high-powered [[aircraft engine|aero-engines]] driven [[Miss America (speedboats)|''Miss America'']] boats had made him a multiple water speed record holder and the first man to travel over {{convert|100|mph|kn km/h|abbr=on}} on water. Although Segrave had already used aero-engines in some of his land-speed record setting vehicles, ''Miss England I'' used a single [[Napier Lion]] engine. Instead Segrave believed the boat's speed would come from its advanced lightweight planing-hull design. Wood - along with other American boat designers - thought the design was too flimsy for the speeds. Wood sportingly offered to help Segrave, particularly sharing his experiences in propeller and rudder design.

After his 1929 land speed record, Segrave immediately went to [[Miami]] for his speedboat race with Wood which he won. It was the American's first defeat in nine years. After Segrave returned to Britain, he was knighted for his many accomplishments.

==Death==
On Friday 13 June 1930, a few months after receiving his knighthood, Segrave drove ''[[Miss England II]]'' to a new record of {{convert|98.76|mph|kn km/h|abbr=on}} average over two runs on [[Windermere]]. However, on the third run the boat capsized at full speed. Chief engineer Victor Halliwell was killed by the boat rolling over on him as it crashed. Mechanic Michael "Jack" Willcocks survived with a broken arm after being thrown from the craft. Segrave, who was rescued unconscious as the boat sank, regained consciousness for a moment and asked about the fate of "his men". Shortly after being told that he had broken the record he died from acute [[Pulmonary hemorrhage|lung hemorrhage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-IDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA534&amp;dq=1930+plane+%22Popular&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5SWNTvvhIM63tge6lc2DDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=1930%20plane%20%22Popular&amp;f=true "Boat Speeds More Than a Hundred Miles An Hour"] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1931, p. 534&lt;/ref&gt; Although a large floating branch was discovered near the crash, there has been no definitive cause for the accident. Other theories include the boat's construction. Concerns were raised that its hull was too light in design and construction, particularly around the craft [[Hydroplane (boat)|hydroplane]] which was found partially detached after the crash.

[[Kaye Don]] subsequently broke two more world water speed records in ''Miss England II''.

==Aircraft designer==
When Segrave's interest in flying returned in the late 1920s he designed an aircraft for luxury touring. The prototype, known as the [[Blackburn Segrave|Saro Segrave Meteor]] was a wooden twin-engined monoplane. It first flew on 28 May 1930. However, development was delayed due to Segrave's death a month later. Only three metal versions of the [[Blackburn Segrave]] were subsequently built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Jackson|first= A.J.|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= British Civil Aircraft since 1919|year= 1974|publisher= Putnam|location= London|isbn=0-370-10014-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1930 the [[Segrave Trophy]] was established to recognise any British national who demonstrated the most outstanding accomplishments in the possibilities of transport by land, sea, air, or water. The trophy is awarded by the [[Royal Automobile Club]]. 
Recipients include [[Malcolm Campbell]] (1932), [[Stirling Moss]] (1957), [[Richard Noble]] (1983), [[Lewis Hamilton]] (2007) and [[John Surtees]] (2013).

'''Inmarsat-4 F3''' is a communications [[I-4 satellite]] operated by the [[United Kingdom|British]] satellite operator [[Inmarsat]]. It was launched into a [[geosynchronous orbit]] at 22:43 GMT on 18 August 2008,&lt;ref name="ILS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilslaunch.com/news-081908 |title=ILS PROTON SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHES INMARSAT-4 F3 SATELLITE |date=2008-08-19 |publisher=International Launch Services |accessdate=2009-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923142147/http://www.ilslaunch.com/news-081908 |archivedate=2008-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by a [[Proton-M]]/[[Briz-M]] Enhanced [[carrier rocket]]. It is currently located at 97.65° West longitude, providing coverage of the Americas.&lt;ref name="FCC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/inmarsat-list|title=Inmarsat List &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; FCC.gov|date=|website=US Federal Communications Commission|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323091955/http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/inmarsat-list|archivedate=March 23, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It entered service on 7 January 2009.

Like the earlier [[Inmarsat-4 F1]] and [[Inmarsat-4 F2|F2]] satellites, Inmarsat-4 F3 was constructed by [[EADS Astrium]], using a [[Eurostar E3000]]  [[satellite bus|bus]]. It has a mass of 5,960 kilograms, and is expected to operate for 13 years.&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/inmarsat-4.htm|title=Inmarsat-4|last=Krebs|first=Gunter|publisher=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally slated for launch using an [[Atlas V]] 531, but was transferred to Proton due to a large backlog of Atlas launches.

In the United States, Inmarsat ground stations are licensed to operate at 1525-1559 MHz and 1626.5-1660.5 MHz.  The 1544-1545 MHz and 1645.5-1646.5 MHz bands are reserved for safety and distress communications.&lt;ref name="FCC"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intelsat 706''' (also known as '''IS-706''' and '''Intelsat 7-F6''') is a [[geostationary]] [[communication]] [[satellite]] that was built by [[Space Systems/Loral]] ('''SSL'''). It is located in the orbital position of 157 degrees east longitude and it is currently in an [[inclined orbit]]. The same is owned by [[Intelsat]]. The satellite was based on the LS-1300 platform and its estimated useful life was 15 years.&lt;ref name="gsp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/intelsat-7a.htm|title=Intelsat-7A (706, 707, 708)|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The satellite was successfully launched into space on May 17, 1995,&lt;ref name="gsp"/&gt; at 06:34, using an [[Ariane 4]] vehicle from the [[Guiana Space Centre]], [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]].&lt;ref name="gsp"/&gt; It had a launch mass of 4,180&amp;nbsp;kg.

The Intelsat 706 is equipped with 26 transponders in [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] and 10 in [[Ku band]] to provide broadcasting, business-to-home services and [[telecommunications]]. It was positioned over the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and has the transponder capacity to relay 110,000 [[telephone]] calls simultaneously.&lt;ref name="infosat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infosatellites.com/intelsat706-satellite-information-norad-23571.html|title=Intelsat 706 - Satellite details|accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iskra Delta''' was a [[computer]] manufacturer from [[Slovenia]], and one of the biggest computer producers in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] that saw its own end with the breakup of the country.  It started in 1974 as Elektrotehna, the Ljubljana representative of [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], a USA minicomputer manufacturer with an office in Belgrade.  It began assembling PDP-11 minicomputers in Ljubljana from DEC processors and [[Ampex]] disks in 1978.  Rapid expansion over all major Yugoslav Republics.  It had a joint venture with [[Energoinvest]], Sarajevo.  Video terminals assembly was in Paka, Slovenj Gradec. Forced merger with Iskra and [[Gorenje]] computer divisions resulted in Iskra-Delta's enlargement to 2,000 employees.  Delays with microcomputer technology and freer import brought its collapse in 1988.

'''Ivorians in France''' consist of migrants from [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and their descendants living and working in France. They are one of the [[diaspora]]s from [[Black Africa]] in France.

== History ==
Prior to 1990, immigration from the Ivory Coast to France was very limited. It was mostly students and businessmen who wanted to return to [[Côte d'Ivoire]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.letelegramme.com/ig/generales/france-monde/france/qui-sont-les-ivoiriens-de-france-23-01-2011-1183500.php&lt;/ref&gt; But with the economic crisis and the politic instability of their home country, many chose to remain in France and the Ivorian population increased.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1570">'''Kiprotich''' is a [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] name, common in parts of [[Kenya]] and [[Uganda]] inhabited by the Kalenjin people.

[[File:Mail-cover-documents-p19-normal.gif|thumb|Request for mail cover form]]
'''Mail cover''' is a law enforcement investigative technique in which the [[United States Postal Service]], acting at the request of a law enforcement agency, records information from the outside of letters and parcels before they are delivered and then sends the information to the agency that requested it.&lt;ref name=nytpickering&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/us/monitoring-of-snail-mail.html|title=U.S. Postal Service Logging All Mail for Law Enforcement|publisher=New York Times|date=July 3, 2013|first=Ron|last=Nixon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Postal Service grants mail cover surveillance requests for about 30 days and may extend them for up to 120 days.

Mail covers can be requested to investigate criminal activity or to protect national security. On average the Postal Service grants 15,000 to 20,000 criminal activity requests each year.&lt;ref name=nytpickering/&gt; It rarely denies a request{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}.

Mail cover is defined by the U.S. Postal Regulations 39 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] 233.3&lt;ref&gt;[[Code of Federal Regulations]]: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/39/233.3 U.S. Postal Regulations 39 CFR 233.3 - Mail covers.] "(c) Definitions.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Internal Revenue Manual]]&lt;ref&gt; [[Internal Revenue Manual]]: [https://web.archive.org/web/20051128151216/http://www.irs.gov/irm/part9/ch04s13.html#d0e25473 9.4.10.2.1  (03-26-2002) Definitions Relating to Mail Covers] "The following are USPS mail cover definitions: ...."&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:

:Mail cover is the process by which a nonconsensual record is made of any data appearing on the outside cover of sealed or unsealed mail; or by which a record is made of the contents of any unsealed mail, as allowed by law, to obtain information to protect national security; locate a fugitive; obtain evidence of the commission or attempted commission of a crime; obtain evidence of a violation or attempted violation of a postal statute; or assist in the identification of property, proceeds, or assets forfeitable under law. &lt;ref&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Mail+cover Free Legal Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

As mail cover does not involve the reading of the mail but only information on the outside of the [[envelope]] or [[Packaging and labeling|package]] that could be read by anyone seeing the item anyway, it is not considered by court precedent a violation of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]].  However, there has been criticism of the practice by some,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = mail cover - Everything2.com|url = http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1281744|website = everything2.com|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly due to the delay in mail the process might cause, though regulations prohibit mail cover from delaying mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=totse.com {{!}} Inside The Postal Mail Cover |url=http://www.totse.com/en/conspiracy/institutional_analysis/postal.html |date=2008-04-19 |accessdate=2015-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419063000/http://www.totse.com/en/conspiracy/institutional_analysis/postal.html |archivedate=April 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to official statistics obtained through a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] request by the [[National Law Journal]], the number of mail covers in 1984 was 9,022 and increased to 14,077 in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first1=Elizabeth |last1= Amon |first2=Michael |last2=Ravnitzky| title = 'We're Getting Popular,' Says a Mail Cover Supervisor| work = [[National Law Journal]]| date = 2002-04-01| accessdate = 2015-12-18| url = http://www.nationallawjournal.com/id=900005529986/Were-Getting-Popular-Says-a-Mail-Cover-Supervisor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2001, the Postal Service has been effectively conducting mail covers on all American postal mail as part of the [[Mail Isolation Control and Tracking]] program.&lt;ref name=nytpickering/&gt;

Types of Japanese facial armour include the ''somen'', ''menpō'', ''hanbo'' or ''hanpo'', and ''happuri''.

==Description==
Men-yoroi were facial armour which covered all or part of the face and provided a way to secure the top-heavy ''[[kabuto]]'' (helmet). The ''Shinobi-no-o'' (chin cord) of the kabuto would be tied under the chin of the men-yoroi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TPw7m2qrRloC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=menpo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fHUeTZGBMsKt8Aa00oGTDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=menpo&amp;f=false ''Samurai 1550-1600''], Anthony J. Bryant, Angus McBride, Osprey Publishing, 1994 p.28&lt;/ref&gt; There were small hooks called ''ori-kugi'' or posts called ''odome'' located on various places to help secure the kabuto's chin cord. Men-yoroi may be constructed from iron or leather, or a combination of both. They may have a [[lacquer]]ed or rusted type of finish and can include a variety of facial details, such as [[moustache]]s, fierce teeth and a detachable nose.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IQ3FAZG94ZsC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=mengu+armour&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wtInT67_N4ar2AWYlZTuAg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=mengu%20armour&amp;f=true ''Samurai: The Weapons and Spirit of the Japanese Warrior''], Author Clive Sinclaire, Publisher Globe Pequot, 2004, {{ISBN|978-1-59228-720-8}} P.30,138&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;he Watanabe Art Museum Samurai Armour Collection (Kabuto &amp; Mengu, Volume I) Trevor Absolon (Author), Brian Snoody (Illustrator), Barry Till (Preface), Anthony J.

Bryant (Foreword) Publisher(Toraba), 2011 P.234]&lt;/ref&gt; Most men-yoroi with the exception of the happuri had a small hole underneath the chin for sweat drainage.

Men-yoroi are similar to masks worn by armored cavalry and infantry in ancient Chinese armies from the [[Han Dynasty]] to the [[Song Dynasty]].

[[File:Mohor Besar Raja-Raja.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The seal containing the [[coat of arms]] of nine [[Malay states]], and is inscribed with the word "Great Seal of the Malay Rulers" in [[Jawi script]], displayed in the [[Istana Negara, Jalan Istana|Royal Museum]], Kuala Lumpur.]]
The '''monarchies of Malaysia''' refer to the [[constitutional monarchy]] system as practised in [[Malaysia]]. The political system of Malaysia is based on the [[Westminster system|Westminster]] [[parliamentary system]] with the features of a federation.

Nine of the [[states and federal territories of Malaysia|states]] of Malaysia are constitutionally headed by traditional [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] rulers. The nine states are collectively referred to as the ''Malay States''. State constitutions limit eligibility for the thrones to male Malay muslims of royal descent. Seven are hereditary monarchies based on [[agnatic primogeniture]]; they are [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Johor]], [[Perlis]], [[Pahang]], [[Selangor]] and [[Terengganu]]. In [[Perak]], the throne rotates among three branches of the royal family loosely based on [[agnatic seniority]]. One state, [[Negeri Sembilan]], is an [[elective monarchy]]; the ruler is elected from male members of the royal family by hereditary chiefs. All rulers except those of [[Perlis]] and [[Negeri Sembilan]] use the title ''[[Sultan]]''. The ruler of Perlis is styled ''[[Raja]]'', while the ruler of Negeri Sembilan is known as ''[[Yang Di Pertuan Besar]]''.

Every five years or when a vacancy occurs, the rulers convene in the [[Conference of Rulers]] ({{lang-ms|Majlis Raja-Raja}}) to elect among themselves the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], the federal constitutional monarch and [[head of state]] of Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Sourcetext|source=Constitution of Malaysia|chapter=|verse=Article 38 |range=-2(b) }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Yang di-Pertuan Agong is elected among the rulers,&lt;ref name="dfat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/malaysia/malaysia_brief.html |title=Malaysia country brief |publisher=dfat.gov.au |date=September 2013 |accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia as a whole is also an elective monarchy.

==Roles==

Each of the nine rulers serves as the head of state of his own state, as well as the head of the religion of [[Islam]] in his state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Sourcetext|source=Constitution of Malaysia|chapter=|verse=Article 3 |range=-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other constitutional monarchs around the world, the rulers do not participate in the actual governance in their states; instead, each of them is bound by convention to act on the advice of the head of government of his state, known as [[Menteri Besar]] (pl. Menteri-menteri Besar). However, the ruler of each state has discretionary powers in appointing the Menteri Besar that commands a majority in the [[state legislative assemblies of Malaysia|state legislative assembly]], and refusing a dissolution of the state assembly when requested by the Menteri Besar.

The [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] is the federal [[head of state]]. His symbolic roles include being the [[Commander-in-Chief of the Malaysian Armed Forces|Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Malaysian Armed Forces]], and carrying out diplomatic functions such as receiving foreign diplomats and representing Malaysia on [[state visits]]. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong is the head of Islam in his own state, the four states without rulers ([[Penang]], [[Malacca]], [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]]) and the [[Federal Territories (Malaysia)|Federal Territories]]. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong is required to delegate all his state powers to a [[regent]], except for the role of head of Islam. Similar to other rulers, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong acts on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]], and has discretionary powers in appointing the Prime Minister that commands a majority in the [[Dewan Rakyat]], the [[lower house]] of the [[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliament]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Sourcetext|source=Constitution of Malaysia|chapter=|verse=Article 43 |range=-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and refusing a dissolution of the Parliament. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong also appoints the [[Yang di-Pertua Negeri]], the ceremonial governors for the four states without rulers, on the advice of the Prime Minister and the [[Chief Ministers in Malaysia|Chief Ministers]] of the states.

A unique feature of the constitutional monarchy in Malaysia is the [[Conference of Rulers]], consisting of the nine rulers and the four Yang di-Pertua Negeris. The Conference convenes triannually to discuss various issues related to state and national policies. The most important role of the Conference is to elect the Yang di-Pertuan Agong every five years or when a vacancy occurs. Only the rulers participate in the election of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, as well as discussions related to rulers' privileges and religious observances. The Conference's other role in the federal governance of the country is to give consent to amendments of certain entrenched provisions of the federal [[Constitution of Malaysia|constitution]], namely those pertaining to the status of the rulers, the special privileges of the [[Bumiputra]], the status of the [[Malay language]] as the national language, and the status of Islam as the religion of the federation.

==History==
Historically, various Malay kingdoms flourished on the [[Malay peninsula]]. The earliest kingdoms were influenced by [[Hindu]] culture, the most notable being [[Langkasuka]] in present-day Kedah. In the 15th century, the [[Malacca Sultanate]] became the dominant power on the peninsula. The Malacca Sultanate was the first Malay Muslim state based on the peninsula that was also a real regional maritime power. After the fall of Malacca in 1511, several local rulers emerged in the northern part of the peninsula which later fell under [[Siam]]ese influence, while two princes of the Malaccan royal family founded Johor and Perak respectively. The Sultanate of Johor emerged as the dominant power on the peninsula. The vast territory of Johor led to some areas gaining autonomy, which gradually developed into independent states.

In the 19th century, as various infighting among the Malay aristocracy threatened British economic interests in the region, the British began a policy of intervention. The British concluded treaties with some Malay states, installing “[[resident (title)|residents]]” as advisors to the rulers, who soon became the ''de facto'' ruling powers of their states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri17chisrich#page/478/mode/2up |title=The Encyclopædia Britannica : a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These residents held power in everything except in religion affairs and Malay customs. In 1895, the governance of Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, Perak and Selangor were combined as the [[Federated Malay States]], headed by a Resident General based in [[Kuala Lumpur]]. The British wrestled Kedah, Kelantan, Perlis and Terengganu from Siamese influence, and in turn they each received a British "advisor". Johor was the last state to succumb to British pressure, receiving an advisor in 1914. These five states were known as the [[Unfederated Malay States]].

In 1946, after [[World War II]], the British combined the Federated Malay States and the Unfederated Malay States, together with two of the [[Straits Settlements]], Penang and Malacca, to form the [[Malayan Union]] which was headed by a British governor. Under the terms of the Union, the Malay rulers conceded all their powers to the [[British Crown]] except in religious matters. Widespread opposition by Malay nationalists led to the reform of Malayan Union to become the [[Federation of Malaya]] in 1948, in which the rulers were restored to their symbolic role as heads of state.

The present form of constitutional monarchy in Malaysia dates from 1957, when the Federation of Malaya gained independence. The rulers serve as constitutional heads of their states, with the state executive powers exercised by state governments elected by the people. The rulers elect among themselves a federal head of state, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, with the federal executive powers exercised by an elected federal government. The form of constitutional monarchy was retained when Malaysia was formed in 1963.

==Kedah==
{{Further|Kedah Kingdom|Kedah Sultanate}}
According to the ''[[Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa]]'', the [[Kedah Kingdom|Kingdom of Kedah]] was founded around 630 CE by Maharaja Derbar Raja, who arrived from [[Bandar-Abbas|Gameroon]], [[Persia]]. The [[Kedah Sultanate|Sultanate of Kedah]] was founded when the last [[Hindu]] king, Phra Ong Mahawangsa, converted to [[Islam]] in 1136. He took the name [[Sultan Mudzafar Shah I|Sultan Mudzafar Shah]]. Sultan Mudzafar's descendants continue to rule Kedah today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kedah |url=http://www.royalark.net/Malaysia/kedah2.htm |work=Royal Ark |accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seat of the Sultan of Kedah is [[Anak Bukit]].&lt;ref&gt;''Malaysia in history'' (1956). Malaysian Historical Society. Volumes 3–5, p 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kelantan==
{{Further|Sultan of Kelantan}}
After centuries of subordination by [[Majapahit]], [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]], [[Siam]] and [[Terengganu]], [[Muhammad I of Kelantan|Long Muhammad]], son of Long Yunus, declared himself Sultan in 1800 and gained recognition as a tributary by the Siamese. Control over Kelantan was transferred to the [[British Malaya|British]] under the [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kelantan |url=http://www.royalark.net/Malaysia/kelantan.htm |work=Royal Ark |accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state capital, [[Kota Bharu]], also serves as the royal city. The main palace for ceremonial functions is Istana Balai Besar, while Istana Negeri serves as the current sultan's residence. The previous sultan, who is still living, resides at Istana Mahkota.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Ismail Ibrahim (17 March 2011).

==Johor==
The early Sultans of Johor claimed to be a continuation of the [[Malacca Sultanate]]. The first Sultan, [[Alauddin Riayat Shah II of Johor|Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah II]] was the son of the last Sultan of Malacca, who reigned from 1528. In the 19th century, with support from the British, the [[Temenggong]] family gained recognition as rulers of the state. Its first sultan, [[Abu Bakar of Johor|Maharaja Abu Bakar]] is known as the founder of "modern Johor". His descendants rule the state today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Johor |url=http://www.royalark.net/Malaysia/johor.htm |work=Royal Ark |accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sultan of Johor resides in the capital, [[Johor Bahru]].

==Negeri Sembilan==
Negeri Sembilan's monarchy incorporates a form of federalism, whereby the state is divided into smaller ''luak'' (chiefdoms), each with a ruling ''[[undang]]'' (chieftain). Four of the major chieftains elect the [[Yang di-Pertuan Besar]] (Yam Tuan Besar), who is the Head of State of Negeri Sembilan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Negeri Sembilan |url=http://www.royalark.net/Malaysia/negri2.htm |work=Royal Ark |accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Yam Tuan Besar was [[Raja Melewar]], who united the nine small states of Negeri Sembilan, each of which were ruled by a local chieftain.&lt;ref name="n9"&gt;{{cite news |title=History in the making: Negri Sembilan welcomes a new ruler after 40 years |url=http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2009/10/26/lifefocus/4878019&amp;sec=lifefocus |publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)]] |author=S.

Raja Melewar was succeeded by other princes sent from Pagaruyung, whose sons did not inherit the throne until Raja Raden in 1831, who was the son of Raja Lenggang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Negeri Sembilan |url=http://www.royalark.net/Malaysia/negri2.htm |work=Royal Ark |accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seat of the Yam Tuan Besar is [[Seri Menanti]].

===Chieftains / Undang===
{{Further|Undang}}

Chieftains are selected among the nobility in each Luak, following [[matrilineal]] inheritance, part of the state's ''[[Adat perpatih]]'' customs. The Undang of Sungai Ujong is chosen among the Waris Hulu and Waris Hilir families, and inherits the title ''Dato' Klana Petra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sungai Ujong |url=http://www.royalark.net/Malaysia/sungai.htm |work=Royal Ark |accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Undang of Jelebu is elected among the four noble houses, Waris Jelebu, Waris Ulu Jelebu, Waris Sarin and Waris Kemin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jelebu |url=http://www.royalark.net/Malaysia/jelebu.htm |work=Royal Ark |accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undang of Johol are a succession of members of two families in the female line which are Perut Gemencheh and Perut Johol.

The Jamalullails are of [[Arab]] descent and continue to rule the state of Perlis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Perlis |url=http://www.royalark.net/Malaysia/perlis.htm |work=Royal Ark |accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seat of the Raja of Perlis is [[Arau]].

==Perak==
{{details| Perak}}

The Perak sultanate is founded by the son of the last sultan of Malacca, Sultan Muzaffar Shah. His descendants still live until this day. The Sultan of Perak resides in Istana Iskandariah in [[Kuala Kangsar]].

==Selangor==
{{details|Selangor Sultanate}}

The first Sultan of Selangor was HRH Sultan Sallehuddin Shah of Selangor. He took the title as the Sultan on November 1742. He was the son of the famous Bugis warrior Prince Daeng Chelak. 

The state of Selangor is on the west coast of Peninsular of Malaysia and is bordered by [[Perak]] to the north, [[Pahang]] to the east, [[Negeri Sembilan]] to the south and the [[Strait of Malacca]] to the west. It surrounds the Federal Territories of [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Putrajaya]], both of which were once under Selangor's territorial sovereignty.

The Sultan of Selangor resides in [[Klang, Malaysia|Klang]].

==Terengganu==
{{details| Terengganu}}

The state of Terengganu is situated in north-eastern Peninsular Malaysia, and is bordered in the northwest by [[Kelantan]], the southwest by [[Pahang]], and the east by the [[South China Sea]]. Several outlying islands, including [[Pulau Perhentian]], Pulau Kapas and [[Pulau Redang]], are also a part of the state.

==Succession==
In seven of the Malay states, [[succession order]] is generally determined roughly by [[primogeniture#Agnatic primogeniture|agnatic primogeniture]]. No female may become ruler, and female line descendants are generally excluded from succession.

In Negeri Sembilan, the [[Yamtuan Besar]] of the state is nominally elected by a council of Four Ruling Chieftains (''Undang Empat''), although succession stays within the state royal family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ceremony and protocol |url=http://www.mmail.com.my/content/16837-installation-11th-yang-dipertuan-besar-negri-sembilan-tuanku-muhriz-ibni-almarhum-tuan |publisher=[[Malay Mail]] |work=Installation of the 11th Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negri Sembilan Tuanku Muhriz Ibni Almarhum Tuanku Munawir |author=Radi Mustapha |date=26 October 2008 |accessdate=5 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622013652/http://www.mmail.com.my/content/16837-installation-11th-yang-dipertuan-besar-negri-sembilan-tuanku-muhriz-ibni-almarhum-tuan |archivedate=22 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, after the death of Tuanku Munawir, his son, [[Muhriz of Negeri Sembilan|Tunku Muhriz]] was not selected as the next Yamtuan Besar because of his youth. Instead, the Chieftains elected his uncle, [[Jaafar of Negeri Sembilan|Tuanku Jaafar]], to succeed his father. In 2008, upon the death of Tuanku Jaafar, the Chieftains passed over Jaafar's sons and elected Tunku Muhriz as the next ruler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tuanku Muhriz is new Negri Ruler |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/print/malaysia/Tuanku-Muhriz-is-new-Negri-Ruler/ |publisher=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=30 December 2008 |accessdate=5 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014203614/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/print/malaysia/Tuanku-Muhriz-is-new-Negri-Ruler/ |archivedate=14 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Perak, the throne is rotated among three branches of the royal family. The system originated in the 19th century during the reign of the 18th Sultan of Perak, when it was decided that the throne would rotate among his three sons and their descendants. There are six positions in the [[order of succession]], appointed by the reigning Sultan advised by his Royal Council. Traditionally, the eldest son of the reigning Sultan is placed at the end of the line. When a vacancy occurs in the line of succession, the persons behind in line is typically moved up, and the branch that formerly held the vacant seat is skipped. However, the order of succession is subjected to alteration by the Sultan and his Royal Council. For example, in 1987, Sultan [[Azlan Shah of Perak|Azlan Shah]] appointed his eldest son, [[Nazrin Shah of Perak|Raja Nazrin Shah]] as the Raja Muda (first in line to the throne), bypassing the candidates from the other two branches. The appointment was due to the demise of the previous Raja Muda, Raja Ahmed Sifuddin, and the renouncement of the Raja Di-hilir (second in line to the throne), Raja Ahmad Hisham, for health reasons.

The [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] is elected by and among the nine rulers (excluding minors) every five years or when a vacancy arises (by death, resignation, or deposition by majority vote of the rulers). The Yang di-Pertuan Agong serves a maximum of five years, and may not be re-elected until after all the other states had taken their turns. When the office was established in 1957, the order of seniority of the rulers was based on the length of their reigns on the state thrones. When the first cycle of rotation was completed in 1994, the order of the states in the first cycle became the basis of the order for the second cycle.

==Consorts==
The title of the consort of a monarch is not generally fixed and not automatically obtained [[Courtesy title|by courtesy]]. A consort may only use a title if it is granted to her either by order of the ruler or during a coronation ceremony.&lt;ref name="sultanah"&gt;{{cite news|title=No 'sultanah' title or special perks for 2 Johor consorts |url=http://www.nst.com.my/nst/articles/2rou/Article/ |publisher=[[New Straits Times]] |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=5 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219155227/http://www.nst.com.my/nst/articles/2rou/Article/ |archivedate=19 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The consorts of different states have different titles, some do not even receive one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=[Order of precedence for the Raja Permaisuri Agong, royal consorts and wives of Yang di-Pertua Negeri] |url=http://www.majlisraja-raja.gov.my/senarai%20susunan%20kanan%20dymm%20&amp;%20tyt2.html |publisher=Office of the Keeper of the Rulers' Seal |accessdate=15 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120061715/http://www.majlisraja-raja.gov.my/senarai%20susunan%20kanan%20dymm%20%26%20tyt2.html |archivedate=20 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of a consort in a state may also change depending on the ruler. For instance, the wife of [[Ismail Nasiruddin of Terengganu|Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin of Terengganu]] was known as the Tengku Ampuan Besar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yang di-Pertuan Agong IV |url=http://www.malaysianmonarchy.org.my/malaysianmonarchy/?q=en/ydpa4 |work=His Majesty and Her Majesty |publisher=MalaysianMonarchy.org.my |accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the wife of his grandson [[Mizan Zainal Abidin|Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin]] is known as the Sultanah (formerly Permaisuri).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yang di-Pertuan Agong XIII |url=http://www.malaysianmonarchy.org.my/malaysianmonarchy/?q=en/ydpa13 |work=His Majesty and Her Majesty |publisher=MalaysianMonarchy.org.my |accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Titles of consorts usually take the form Cik Puan, Raja Perempuan, Sultanah, Tengku Ampuan, Raja Permaisuri, Tengku Permaisuri, or Permaisuri.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Schedule 6.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1164">'''Mongolian cattle''' are a cattle breed native to [[Mongolia]] and [[Inner Mongolia]]. In 1949, Mongolian cattle began to be improved with crossbreeding to European breeds. 

Mongolian cattle have been herded for centuries by [[nomad]]s and are highly valued for their meat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecattlesite.com/breeds/beef/28/mongolian/overview The Cattle Site - Breeds]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/cattle/mongolian/index.htm Oklamhoma State University - Mongolian cattle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229203157/http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/cattle/mongolian/index.htm |date=2010-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, 40,000 of the breed died due to harsh winter conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mongolia-web.com/economy/1628-news-report-40000-mongolian-cattle-dead-due-to-harsh-winter Mongolia Web -News Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419031024/http://www.mongolia-web.com/economy/1628-news-report-40000-mongolian-cattle-dead-due-to-harsh-winter |date=2015-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''OSIM International Ltd''' ({{zh|s=傲胜国际企业|hp=Àoshèng guójì qǐyè}}), was originally established in [[Singapore]] in 1980 by Ron Sim, as an electrical and household appliance company under the name of R Sim Trading. With a small start-up capital, the company was mainly involved with the marketing of household products such as knives, knife sharpeners and mobile clothes drying rods. In 1989, the company registered the name Health Check and Care, and saw a shift in focus to healthy lifestyle products. The period following this saw tremendous growth for the company, and it developed outlets including [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]].

In 1993, the company officially launched the OSIM brand name and its distribution network expanded to 60 point-of-sale outlets in [[Asia]].  In 2002, OSIM opened its global business headquarters in Singapore at 65 Ubi Avenue 1. The Business Headquarters Status (BHQ) was awarded to OSIM by The Economic Development Board. In 1993, the company opened its first concept shop in [[Shanghai]], in the [[People’s Republic of China]].

In October 2005, OSIM made a strategic acquisition of US Nationwide specialty retailer [[Brookstone]]. OSIM is a combination of the surname of its founder, Sim, and 'O' that stands for the globe.

'''R3''' is a mostly planned [[Highways in Slovakia|expressway]] passing through central [[Slovakia]] in the north-south direction along the [[European route E77]].

It goes from SK/[[Hungary|H]] border, moving north around [[Krupina]] ([[Expressway R7 (Slovakia)|R7]]) to [[Zvolen]], from there is currently planned to share an 18&amp;nbsp;km section with [[R1 expressway (Slovakia)|R1]]/[[R2 expressway (Slovakia)|R2]] (there are alternative plans to direct it north of Zvolen, where in that case would share around 20&amp;nbsp;km with R1 to [[Banská Bystrica]], then it would turn west to join certain planned route), then turning north to [[Martin, Slovakia|Martin]], sharing a section with the [[Motorway D1 (Slovakia)|D1]], then splitting off in either [[Kraľovany]] or [[Ružomberok]], going through the [[Orava River]] valley to [[Trstená]], ending at SK/[[Poland|PL]] border.

From the total length of cca. 230&amp;nbsp;km (excluding shared sections), there are:
* 11,9&amp;nbsp;km in operation (around [[Oravský Podzámok]] and from Trstená to the Polish border as a two-lane road, the latter being an unlimited access road)
* 11,4&amp;nbsp;km planned (prior to the year 2010)

The rest is planned to be built after year 2010.

==Morphology==

Up to 6&amp;nbsp;cm long with an orange body with 50–60 segments. Body is composed of a wide anterior part of segments 15–17 and a long slim posterior part. Prostomium rectangular shaped with two lateral horns making it appear as a ''T. peristomium'' without chaetae. Parapodia small and oval at first increasing in size from segments 16–18. Four pairs of branching gills dorsally on 2-5 segment with chaetae.&lt;ref name=DKfauna&gt;{{cite book |author=Kirkegaard, J.

'''Voice of Mongolia''' is the official [[international broadcasting]] station of [[Mongolia]].

The Voice Of Mongolia is the country's only overseas broadcasting service and is operated by [[Mongol HD Television]], a private service broadcaster. Short-wave international broadcasting in [[Mongolia]] dates back over 40 years. The first broadcast in October, 1964 was a half hour transmission in [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]], beamed to [[China]]. In the next few years, Mongolian international broadcasting expanded in terms of languages used, broadcast hours and target areas. The English service of Radio Ulaanbaatar, which was renamed The Voice Of Mongolia on January 1, 1997, was launched on January 29, 1965. Today the output of The Voice Of Mongolia consists of various programmes designed to provide information about [[Mongolia]] and the Mongolians, their history, traditions and culture. It broadcasts a total of 8 hours a day in 5 languages: [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[English language|English]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

==Current broadcasts==
All of the Voice Of Mongolia's broadcasts come directly from its [[Khonkhor Transmitting Station]], about 25&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Ulan Bator]], Mongolia's capital. It broadcasts through Soviet-made 100, 250, and 500&amp;nbsp;kW transmitters and curtain antennas built in the mid sixties. The transmissions beamed to East Asia provide fair reception in South America, and the South Asian transmissions can be heard in Southern Africa and in Europe as well. However, this reception is influenced by propagation conditions and frequency congestion.
