      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2285">'''Anti-terrorism Act, 2009''' is a Bangladeshi legislative act that is designed to specifically target terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti Terrorism Act, 2009|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/bangladesh/document/papers/AntiTerrorism_Act2009.pdf|website=satp.org|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Law was formulated by the Grand Alliance government led by [[Bangladesh Awami League]] in 2009. The law was given retrospective effect from 11 June 2008. The law was designed to target terrorists and financial institutes used by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ali|first1=AMM Shawkat|title=Anti-terrorism Act, 2009|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Anti-terrorism_Act,_2009|website=en.banglapedia.org|publisher=Banglapedia|accessdate=30 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 amendment changed the highest punishment under the act to death penalty. In 2013 another amendment allowed for social media content to be entered as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bangladesh: New Amendment to Anti-Terrorism Act gags Freedom of Expression|url=https://www.fidh.org/en/region/asia/bangladesh/bangladesh-new-amendment-to-anti-terrorism-act-gags-freedom-of-expression-13457|website=Worldwide Movement for Human Rights|accessdate=30 September 2017|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Human Rights group, Odhikar, has called for the law to be repelled describing the act as a total for repression on those opposed to the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Odhikar’s concern about Anti-Terrorism Act 2009|url=http://odhikar.org/odhikars-concern-about-anti-terrorism-act-2009/|website=odhikar.org|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases under this act need government approval for trials to begin, which are sometimes delayed. Thus effectively placing the cases in legal limbo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=27 anti-terror cases stuck|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/27-anti-terror-cases-stuck-1258096|website=The Daily Star|accessdate=30 September 2017|language=en|date=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arizona flagstone''' is composed of rounded grains of [[quartz]] which are cemented by [[silica]]. Other minerals are present, mostly as thin seams of clay, [[mica]], secondary [[calcite]], and [[gypsum]]. Arizona flagstone is mainly quarried from the [[Coconino National Forest|Coconino]] and [[Prescott National Forest]]s.

Although [[flagstone]] and dimension stone are quarried from all over the state of [[Arizona]], the town of [[Ash Fork, Arizona]], is well known as the center of production and has proclaimed itself "The Flagstone Capital of the World". Extensive outcrops of Arizona flagstone are also found in [[Mohave County, Arizona|Mohave]], [[Coconino County, Arizona|Coconino]], [[Yavapai County, Arizona|Yavapai]], [[Navajo County, Arizona|Navajo]], [[Apache County, Arizona|Apache]], and [[Gila County, Arizona|Gila]] counties.

The '''Australian greyhound racing live baiting scandal''' is a series of events that occurred in at least three [[Australia]]n [[States and territories of Australia|states]] where [[Bait (luring substance)|live baiting]] of [[greyhound racing|racing greyhounds]] was exposed on [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC TV]] and in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''. On 16 February 2015, the Australian television current affairs program ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]'' revealed the use of live [[piglet (animal)|piglet]]s, [[Phalangeriformes|possums]] and [[rabbit]]s to train racing greyhounds had been occurring over some years, despite self-regulatory efforts to address the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meldrum-Hanna|first1=Caro|author2=Clark, Sam|title=Making a Killing|url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/2015/02/16/4178920.htm|website=abc.net.au|accessdate=18 February 2015|date=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Then and Now: 12 Months of Reform|url=http://www.grnsw.com.au/uploads/GRNSW-infographic-Then-%26-Now-A3-2.2.pdf|publisher=Greyhound Racing NSW|date=February 2016|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revelation led to suspensions, inquiries, widespread condemnation of the practice, and, following an inquiry, to the banning of greyhound racing in [[New South Wales]] from July 2017, and consequently, the [[Australian Capital Territory]] as well. The NSW ban was reversed on 11 October 2016, with conditions.

==Background==
{{further|Greyhound racing in Australia}}
[[Greyhound racing]] is an organized, competitive sport in which [[greyhound|greyhound dogs]] are raced around a track, chasing a mechanical lure over a fixed distance. Historically, the sport is based on the principle of [[Hare coursing|coursing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Genders, Roy |year=1981 |title=The Encyclopaedia of Greyhound Racing |publisher=Pelham Books Ltd |isbn=0-7207-1106-1 |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a legalised form of [[gambling]] in many jurisdictions. Some greyhound trainers believe that greyhounds will chase better, and hence have a greater chance of winning the race, if they have chased and caught a live animal during training.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The live bait animal is either attached to the mechanical lure, dragged in front of the greyhound, or thrown to it. The greyhound will often maim or kill the bait animal, resulting in death.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Controversy==
The greyhound industry and the law provide harsh penalties for the use of live baits in training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ANIMAL WELFARE PENALTY GUIDELINES|url=http://www.grv.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Animal-Welfare-Penalty-Guidelines-July-1-2014.pdf|website=grv.org.au|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is the use of live baits and lures in greyhound racing illegal?|url=http://kb.rspca.org.au/Is-the-use-of-live-baits-and-lures-in-greyhound-racing-and-other-dog-racing-illegal_241.html|website=rspca.org.au|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, accusations of live baiting in the Australian greyhound industry have arisen from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Brien|first1=Natalie|title=Vets claim live animals used as bait to train greyhounds|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/animals/vets-claim-live-animals-used-as-bait-to-train-greyhounds-20131123-2y2hg.html|accessdate=18 February 2015|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 February 2015, ''Four Corners'' exposed live baiting on training tracks in [[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The program included graphic surveillance footage, filmed by pro-animal activists, that showed various small animals being tied to mechanical lures where they were chased, caught and attacked by greyhounds for up to 30 minutes. Some animals had young taken and given to the dogs. The program also included interviews with many leading greyhound trainers and administrators who denied the practice of live baiting; some of them were subsequently shown to be involved in the live baiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Olding|first1=Rachel|title=Allegations of systemic cheating and live baiting within greyhound racing industry uncovered by Four Corners|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/allegations-of-systemic-cheating-and-live-baiting-within-greyhound-racing-industry-uncovered-by-four-corners-20150217-13gi30.html|accessdate=19 February 2015|work=smh.com.au|date=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program’s graphic content drew immediate and widespread criticism from animal protection groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Piglets, possums and rabbits tortured in sadistic greyhound training 'rituals'|url=http://www.animalsaustralia.org/take_action/greyhound-racing-live-baiting-exposed|website=animalsaustralia.org|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Belot|first1=Henry|title=RSPCA calls for tighter regulation of greyhound industry|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/rspca-calls-for-tighter-regulation-of-greyhound-industry-20150217-13gu65.html|accessdate=19 February 2015|date=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the wider community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Casey|first1=Brendan|title=Public outrage over live baiting in greyhound racing following ABC Four Corners investigation|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/public-outrage-over-live-baiting-in-greyhound-racing-following-abc-four-corners-investigation/story-fni0fit3-1227222407215|accessdate=19 February 2015|work=[[herald Sun]]|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National Party member of parliament and minister [[Barnaby Joyce]] criticised activists who apparently trespassed to record video of live baiting by trainers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Owens|first1=Jared|author2=Cormick, Brendan|title=Barnaby Joyce criticises activists in greyhound live-bait expose|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/barnaby-joyce-criticises-activists-in-greyhound-live-bait-expose/story-e6frg6nf-1227223167503|accessdate=19 February 2015|work=[[The Australian]]|date=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Insolvency}}
'''Bankruptcy''' is a legal status of a person or [[legal person|other entity]] who cannot repay debts to [[creditor]]s. In most jurisdictions, bankruptcy is imposed by a [[court order]], often initiated by the [[debtor]].

Bankruptcy is not the only legal status that an insolvent person may have, and the term ''bankruptcy'' is therefore not a synonym for [[insolvency]]. In some countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]], bankruptcy is limited to individuals; other forms of insolvency proceedings (such as [[liquidation]] and [[Administration (law)|administration]]) are applied to companies. In the [[United States]], ''bankruptcy'' is applied more broadly to formal insolvency proceedings. In France, the cognate French word ''banqueroute'' is used solely for cases of fraudulent bankruptcy, whereas the term ''faillite'' (cognate of "failure") is used for bankruptcy in accordance with the law.&lt;ref&gt;(fr) Dictionnaire Le Petit Larousse 2013, p 104 &amp; 446&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''bankruptcy'' is derived from Italian ''banca rotta'', meaning "broken bank", which may stem from a widespread custom in the [[Republic of Genoa]] of breaking a moneychanger's bench or counter to signify his insolvency, or which may be only a figure of speech.&lt;ref name="Loveland1912"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Olds Loveland|title=A treatise on the law and proceedings in bankruptcy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iqE9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA4|year=1912|publisher=The W.

==History==
{{Main|History of bankruptcy law}}
[[File:John Law cartoon (1720).png|thumb|upright=0.8|Failure of [[John Law (economist)|John Law]]'s [[Mississippi Company]] led to French national bankruptcy in 1720.]]

In [[Ancient Greece]], bankruptcy did not exist. If a man owed and he could not pay, he and his wife, children or servants were forced into "[[debt slavery]]", until the creditor recouped losses through their [[Manual labour|physical labour]]. Many [[Polis|city-states]]  in ancient Greece limited debt slavery to a period of five years; debt slaves had protection of life and limb, which regular slaves did not enjoy. However, servants of the debtor could be retained beyond that [[Time limit|deadline]] by the creditor and were often forced to serve their new lord for a lifetime, usually under significantly harsher conditions. An exception to this rule was [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], which by the [[Solonian Constitution|laws]] of [[Solon]] forbade enslavement for debt; as a consequence, most Athenian slaves were foreigners (Greek or otherwise).

The [[Statute of Bankrupts Act 1542|Statute of Bankrupts]] of 1542 was the first statute under [[English law]] dealing with bankruptcy or [[insolvency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Bankruptcy |first=Edward William Donoghue |last=Manson |volume=3 |page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bankruptcy is also documented in [[East Asia]]. According to [[al-Maqrizi]], the [[Yassa]] of [[Genghis Khan]] contained a provision that mandated the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for anyone who became bankrupt three times.

A failure of a nation to meet bond repayments has been seen on many occasions. [[Philip II of Spain]] had to declare four [[sovereign default|state bankruptcies]] in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596. According to Kenneth S. Rogoff, "Although the development of international capital markets was quite limited prior to 1800, we nevertheless catalog the various defaults of [[France]], [[Portugal]], [[Prussia]], [[Spain]], and the early Italian city-states. At the edge of Europe, Egypt, Russia, and Turkey have histories of chronic default as well."&lt;ref&gt;Carmen M. Reinhart, Kenneth S. Rogoff (2009). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ak5fLB24ircC&amp;pg=&amp;dq=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false This time is different: eight centuries of financial folly]''". Princeton University Press. p.30. {{ISBN|0-691-14216-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern law and debt restructuring==
The principal focus of modern insolvency legislation and business [[debt restructuring]] practices no longer rests on the elimination of insolvent entities, but on the remodeling of the financial and organizational structure of debtors experiencing [[financial distress]] so as to permit the rehabilitation and continuation of the business.

For private households, some argue that it is insufficient to merely dismiss debts after a certain period {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. It is important to assess the underlying problems and to minimize the risk of financial distress to re-occur. It has been stressed that debt advice, a supervised rehabilitation period, financial education and social help to find sources of income and to improve the management of household expenditures must be equally provided during this period of rehabilitation (Refiner ''et al.'', 2003; Gerhardt, 2009; Frade, 2010). In most EU Member States, debt discharge is conditioned by a partial payment obligation and by a number of requirements concerning the debtor's behavior. In the United States (US), discharge is conditioned to a lesser extent. The spectrum is broad in the EU, with the UK coming closest to the US system (Reifner et al., 2003; Gerhardt, 2009; Frade, 2010). The Other Member States do not provide the option of a debt discharge. Spain, for example, passed a bankruptcy law (''ley concurs'') in 2003 which provides for debt settlement plans that can result in a reduction of the debt (maximally half of the amount) or an extension of the payment period of maximally five years (Gerhardt, 2009), but it does not foresee debt discharge.&lt;ref&gt;Dubois &amp; Anderson (2010) Managing household debts: Social service provision in the EU. Working paper. Dublin: European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions. [http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/socialprotection/householdebts.htm euro found.europa.eu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107145903/http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/areas/socialprotection/householdebts.htm |date=2013-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, it is very difficult to discharge federal or federally guaranteed student loan debt by filing bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ferral|first1=Katelyn|title=Narrow bankruptcy laws make it nearly impossible to discharge student debt|url=http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/narrow-bankruptcy-laws-make-it-nearly-impossible-to-discharge-student/article_927360b1-48c0-5f4c-978b-fcffe910f490.html|accessdate=13 March 2018|agency=The Cap Times|publisher=Madison.com|date=28 December 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313214310/http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/narrow-bankruptcy-laws-make-it-nearly-impossible-to-discharge-student/article_927360b1-48c0-5f4c-978b-fcffe910f490.html|archivedate=13 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most other debts, those student loans may be discharged only if the person seeking discharge establishes specific grounds for discharge under the ''Brunner'' test,&lt;ref name=brunner&gt;{{cite web|last1=Treff|first1=Leslie|title="Undue Hardship" Under Section 523(a)(8): Can the Debtor's Student Loans Be Discharged?|url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/bankruptcy/b/bankruptcy-law-blog/archive/2012/08/30/quot-undue-hardship-quot-under-section-523-a-8-can-the-debtor-s-student-loans-be-discharged.aspx|website=LexisNexis Legal Newsroom|accessdate=13 March 2018|date=29 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314042415/https://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/bankruptcy/b/bankruptcy-law-blog/archive/2012/08/30/quot-undue-hardship-quot-under-section-523-a-8-can-the-debtor-s-student-loans-be-discharged.aspx|archivedate=14 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; under which the court evaluates three factors:
* If required to repay the loan, the borrower cannot maintain a minimal standard of living;
* The borrower's financial situation is likely to continue for most or all of the repayment period; and
* The borrower has made a good faith effort to repay the student loans.&lt;ref name=brunner/&gt;
Even if a debtor proves all three elements, a court may permit only a partial discharge of the student loan. Student loan borrowers may benefit from restructuring their payments through a [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13]] bankruptcy repayment plan, but few qualify for discharge of part or all of their student loan debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerson|first1=Seth J.|title=Separate Classification of Student Loans in Chapter 13|journal=Washington University Law Quarterly|date=January 1995|volume=73|issue=1|page=269|url=http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_lawreview/vol73/iss1/5|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223001445/http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_lawreview/vol73/iss1/5/|archivedate=2017-02-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fraud==
Bankruptcy [[fraud]] is a [[white-collar crime]]. While difficult to generalize across jurisdictions, common criminal acts under bankruptcy statutes typically involve concealment of assets, concealment or destruction of documents, conflicts of interest, fraudulent claims, false statements or declarations, and [[Fee fixing scandal|fee fixing]] or redistribution arrangements. Falsifications on bankruptcy forms often constitute [[perjury]]. Multiple filings are not in and of themselves criminal, but they may violate provisions of bankruptcy law. In the U.S., bankruptcy fraud statutes are particularly focused on the [[Mens rea|mental state]] of particular actions.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' 140 Cong. Rec. S14, 461 (daily ed. Oct. 6, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See'' 18 U.S.C. sec 152. [http://trac.syr.edu/laws/18USC152.html trac.syr.edu.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725123135/http://www.trac.syr.edu/laws/18USC152.html |date=2008-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bankruptcy fraud is a [[federal crime]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=18 U.S. Code § 157|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/html/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap9-sec157.htm|website=GPO|publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office|accessdate=14 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507212528/https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title18/html/USCODE-2011-title18-partI-chap9-sec157.htm|archivedate=7 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bankruptcy fraud should be distinguished from ''[[strategic bankruptcy]]'', which is not a [[crime|criminal]] act since it creates a real (not a fake) bankruptcy state. However, it may still work against the filer.

All assets must be disclosed in bankruptcy schedules whether or not the debtor believes the asset has a [[net value]]. This is because once a bankruptcy petition is filed, it is for the creditors, not the debtor, to decide whether a particular asset has value. The future ramifications of omitting assets from schedules can be quite serious for the offending debtor. In the United States, a closed bankruptcy may be reopened by motion of a creditor or the U.S. trustee if a debtor attempts to later assert ownership of such an "unscheduled asset" after being discharged of all debt in the bankruptcy. The trustee may then seize the asset and liquidate it for the benefit of the (formerly discharged) creditors. Whether or not a concealment of such an asset should also be considered for prosecution as fraud or [[perjury]] would then be at the discretion of the judge or U.S. Trustee.

To declare bankruptcy or for a creditor to lodge a petition, the debt must be at least $5,000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

All bankrupts must lodge a Statement of Affairs document with AFSA, which includes important information about their assets and liabilities. A bankruptcy cannot be annulled until this document has been lodged.

Ordinarily, a bankruptcy lasts three years from the filing of the Statement of Affairs with AFSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s149.html|title=BANKRUPTCY ACT 1966 - SECT 149 Automatic discharge|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=2017-01-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131191832/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ba1966142/s149.html|archivedate=2017-01-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Bankruptcy Trustee (in most cases, the Official Receiver) is appointed to deal with all matters regarding the administration of the bankrupt estate. The Trustee's job includes notifying creditors of the estate and dealing with creditor inquiries; ensuring that the bankrupt complies with their obligations under the Bankruptcy Act; investigating the bankrupt's financial affairs; realising funds to which the estate is entitled under the Bankruptcy Act and distributing dividends to creditors if sufficient funds become available.

For the duration of their bankruptcy, all bankrupts have certain restrictions placed upon them. For example, a bankrupt must obtain the permission of their trustee to travel overseas. Failure to do so may result in the bankrupt being stopped at the airport by the Australian Federal Police. Additionally, a bankrupt is required to provide their trustee with details of income and assets. If the bankrupt does not comply with the Trustee's request to provide details of income, the trustee may have grounds to lodge an Objection to Discharge, which has the effect of extending the bankruptcy for a further five years.

The realisation of funds usually comes from two main sources: the bankrupt's assets and the bankrupt's wages. There are certain assets that are protected, referred to as ''protected assets''. These include household furniture and appliances, tools of the trade and vehicles up to a certain value. All other assets of value are sold. If a house or car is above a certain value, the bankrupt can buy the interest back from the estate in order to keep the asset. If the bankrupt does not do this, the interest vests in the estate and the trustee is able to take possession of the asset and sell it.

The bankrupt must pay income contributions if their income is above a certain threshold. If the bankrupt fails to pay, the trustee can issue a notice to garnishee the bankrupt's wages. If that is not possible, the Trustee may seek to extend the bankruptcy for a further five years.

Bankruptcies can be annulled prior to the expiration of the normal three-year period if all debts are paid out in full. Sometimes a bankrupt may be able to raise enough funds to make an Offer of Composition to creditors, which would have the effect of paying the creditors some of the money they are owed. If the creditors accept the offer, the bankruptcy can be annulled after the funds are received.

After the bankruptcy is annulled or the bankrupt has been automatically discharged, the bankrupt's credit report status is shown as "discharged bankrupt" for some years. The maximum number of years this information can be held is subject to the retention limits under the Privacy Act.  How long such information is on a credit report may be shorter, depending on the issuing company, but the report must cease to record that information based on the criteria in the Privacy Act.

===Brazil===
In [[Brazil]], the Bankruptcy Law (11.101/05) governs court-ordered or out-of-court receivership and bankruptcy and only applies to public companies (publicly traded companies) with the exception of financial institutions, credit cooperatives, consortia, supplementary scheme entities, companies administering health care plans, equity companies and a few other legal entities. It does not apply to state-run companies.

Current law covers three legal proceedings. The first one is bankruptcy itself ("Falência"). Bankruptcy is a court-ordered liquidation procedure for an insolvent business. The final goal of bankruptcy is to liquidate company assets and pay its creditors.

The second one is Court-ordered Restructuring (''Recuperação Judicial''). The goal is to overcome the business crisis situation of the debtor in order to allow the continuation of the producer, the employment of workers and the interests of creditors, leading, thus, to preserving company, its corporate function and develop economic activity. It's a court procedure required by the debtor which has been in business for more than two years and requires approval by a judge.

The Extrajudicial Restructuring (''Recuperação Extrajudicial'') is a private negotiation that involves creditors and debtors and, as with court-ordered restructuring, also must be approved by courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2004-2006/2005/Lei/L11101.htm |title=Brazil.

===Canada===
{{Main|Insolvency law of Canada}}
Bankruptcy, also referred to as insolvency in Canada, is governed by the [[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]] and is applicable to businesses and individuals, for example, [[Target Canada]], the Canadian subsidiary of the [[Target Corporation]], the second-largest [[Discount store|discount retailer]] in the United States filed for bankruptcy in January 15, 2015, and closed all of its stores by April 12. The office of the [[Superintendent of Bankruptcy]], a [[federal government of Canada|federal agency]], is responsible for overseeing that bankruptcies are administered in a fair and orderly manner by all licensed Trustees in Canada.

Trustees in bankruptcy, 1041 individuals licensed to administer insolvencies, bankruptcy and proposal estates and are governed by the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act of Canada.

Bankruptcy is filed when a person or a company becomes insolvent and cannot pay their debts as they become due and if they have at least $1,000 in debt.

In 2011, the Superintendent of bankruptcy reported that trustees in Canada filed 127,774 insolvent estates. Consumer estates were the vast majority, with 122 999 estates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/br02805.html |title=Insolvency Statistics in Canada—2011 (Table 2) - Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy Canada |publisher=Ic.gc.ca |accessdate=2013-07-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629074911/http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/br02805.html |archivedate=2013-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The consumer portion of the 2011 volume is divided into 77,993 bankruptcies and 45,006 consumer proposals. This represented a reduction of 8.9% from 2010. Commercial estates filed by Canadian trustees in 2011 4,775 estates, 3,643 bankruptcies and 1,132 Division 1 proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/br02808.html |title=Insolvency Statistics in Canada—2011 (Table 3) - Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy Canada |publisher=Ic.gc.ca |accessdate=2013-07-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629065408/https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/eng/br02808.html |archivedate=2013-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This represents a reduction of 8.6% over 2010.

;Duties of trustees:
Some of the duties of the trustee in bankruptcy are to:
* Review the file for any fraudulent preferences or reviewable transactions
* Chair meetings of creditors
* Sell any non-exempt assets
* Object to the bankrupt's discharge
* Distribute funds to creditors

;Creditors' meetings:
Creditors become involved by attending creditors' meetings. The [[trustee]] calls the first meeting of creditors for the following purposes:
* To consider the affairs of the bankrupt
* To affirm the appointment of the trustee or substitute another in place thereof
* To appoint inspectors
* To give such directions to the trustee as the creditors may see fit with reference to the administration of the estate.

;Consumer proposals:
{{Main|Consumer bankruptcy in Canada}}
In Canada, a person can file a consumer proposal as an alternative to bankruptcy. A consumer proposal is a negotiated settlement between a debtor and their creditors.

A typical proposal would involve a debtor making monthly payments for a maximum of five years, with the funds distributed to their creditors. Even though most proposals call for payments of less than the full amount of the debt owing, in most cases, the creditors accept the deal—because if they do not, the next alternative may be personal bankruptcy, in which the creditors get even less money. The creditors have 45 days to accept or reject the consumer proposal. Once the proposal is accepted by both the creditors and the Court, the debtor makes the payments to the Proposal Administrator each month (or as otherwise stipulated in their proposal), and the general creditors are prevented from taking any further legal or collection action. If the proposal is rejected, the debtor is returned to his prior insolvent state and may have no alternative but to declare personal bankruptcy.

A consumer proposal can only be made by a debtor with debts to a maximum of $250,000 (not including the mortgage on their principal residence). If debts are greater than $250,000, the proposal must be filed under Division 1 of Part III of the [[Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada)|Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act]]. An Administrator is required in the Consumer Proposal, and a Trustee in the Division I Proposal (these are virtually the same although the terms are not interchangeable). A Proposal Administrator is almost always a licensed [[trustee]] in bankruptcy, although the [[Superintendent of Bankruptcy]] may appoint other people to serve as administrators.

In 2006, there were 98,450 personal insolvency filings in Canada: 79,218 bankruptcies and 19,232 consumer proposals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/en/br01702e.html "Insolvency in Canada in 2006"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329033435/http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/bsf-osb.nsf/en/br01702e.html |date=March 29, 2007 }}: Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy ([[Industry Canada]]).

===China===
{{Main|Bankruptcy in China}}
The People's Republic of China legalized bankruptcy in 1986, and a revised law that was more expansive and complete was enacted in 2007.

===Ireland===
[[Bankruptcy in the Republic of Ireland|Bankruptcy in Ireland]] applies only to [[natural person]]s. Other insolvency processes including [[liquidation]] and [[examinership]] are used to deal with corporate insolvency.

Irish bankruptcy law has been the subject of significant comment, from both government sources and the media, as being in need of reform. Part 7 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011&lt;ref name=ACTOF2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0023/sec0030.html#part7|title=Part 7 of the Civil Law Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2011|accessdate=21 September 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119020212/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0023/sec0030.html#part7|archivedate=19 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has started this process and the government has committed to further reform.

===India===
{{update|section|date=December 2016}}
{{Main|Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code}}
The [[Parliament of India]] in the first week of May 2016 passed [[Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code]] 2016 (New Code). Earlier a clear law on corporate bankruptcy did not exist, even though individual bankruptcy laws have been in existence since 1874. The earlier law in force was enacted in 1920 called the Provincial Insolvency Act.

The legal definitions of the terms bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation and dissolution are contested in the Indian legal system. There is no regulation or statute legislated upon bankruptcy which denotes a condition of inability to meet a demand of a creditor as is common in many other jurisdictions.

Winding up of companies was in the jurisdiction of the courts which can take a decade even after the company has actually been declared insolvent. On the other hand, supervisory restructuring at the behest of the [[Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction]] is generally undertaken using receivership by a public entity.

===The Netherlands===
Dutch bankruptcy law is governed by the Dutch Bankruptcy Code (''Faillissementswet''). The code covers three separate legal proceedings. 
* The first is the bankruptcy (''faillissement''). The goal of the bankruptcy is the liquidation of the assets of the company. The bankruptcy applies to individuals and companies. 
* The second legal proceeding in the ''Faillissementswet'' is the ''surseance van betaling''. The ''surseance van betaling'' only applies to companies. Its goal is to reach an agreement with the creditors of the company. Its is comparable to filing for protection against creditors. 
* The third proceeding is the ''schuldsanering''. This proceeding is designed for individuals only and is the result of a court ruling. The judge appoints a monitor. The monitor is an independent third party who monitors the individual's ongoing business and decides about financial matters during the period of the ''schuldsanering''. The individual can travel out of the country freely after the judge's decision on the case.

=== Russia ===
{{Main|Insolvency law of Russia}}
Federal Law No. 127-FZ "On Insolvency (Bankruptcy)" dated 26 October 2002 (as amended) (the "Bankruptcy Act"), replacing the previous law in 1998, to better address the above problems and a broader failure of the action.
Russian insolvency law is intended for a wide range of borrowers: individuals and companies of all sizes, with the exception of state-owned enterprises, government agencies, political parties and religious organizations. There are also special rules for insurance companies, professional participants of the securities market, agricultural organizations and other special laws for financial institutions and companies in the [[natural monopoly|natural monopolies]] in the energy industry.
Federal Law No. 40-FZ "On Insolvency (Bankruptcy)" dated 25 February 1999 (as amended) (the "Insolvency Law of Credit Institutions") contains special provisions in relation to the opening of insolvency proceedings in relation to the credit company. Insolvency Provisions Act, credit organizations used in conjunction with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.

Bankruptcy law provides for the following stages of insolvency proceedings:
• Monitoring procedure or Supervision (nablyudeniye);
• The economic recovery (finansovoe ozdorovleniye);
• External control (vneshneye upravleniye);
• Liquidation (konkursnoye proizvodstvo) and
• Amicable Agreement (mirovoye soglasheniye).

The main face of the bankruptcy process is the [http://arbir.ru/contact-insolvency-officer-cheskidov-roman.htm insolvency officer (trustee in bankruptcy, bankruptcy manager)]. At various stages of bankruptcy, he must be determined: the temporary officer in Monitoring procedure, external manager in External control, the receiver or administrative officer in The economic recovery, the liquidator. During the bankruptcy trustee in bankruptcy (insolvency officer) has a decisive influence on the movement of assets (property) of the debtor - the debtor and has a key influence on the economic and legal aspects of its operations.

===South Africa===
{{Main|South African insolvency law}}

===Switzerland===
{{Main|Insolvency law of Switzerland}}
Under [[Switzerland|Swiss]] law, bankruptcy can be a consequence of [[insolvency]]. It is a court-ordered form of debt enforcement proceedings that applies, in general, to registered commercial entities only. In a bankruptcy, all assets of the debtor are liquidated under the administration of the creditors, although the law provides for debt restructuring options similar to those under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy code.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, bankruptcy (Swedish: konkurs) is a formal process that may involve a company or individual. It is not the same as [[insolvency]], which is inability to pay debts that should have been paid. A creditor or the company itself can apply for bankruptcy. An external bankruptcy manager takes over the company or the assets of the person, and tries to sell as much as possible. A person or a company in bankruptcy can not access its assets (with some exceptions).

The formal bankruptcy process is rarely carried out for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skatteverket.se/konkurs/vadarkonkurs.4.14db52b102ed4e5fe380002973.html |title=Konkurs&amp;nbsp;– Vad är konkurs? |language=sv |publisher=Skatteverket.se |date=2009-05-28 |accessdate=2012-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809022942/http://www.skatteverket.se/konkurs/vadarkonkurs.4.14db52b102ed4e5fe380002973.html |archivedate=2011-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Creditors can claim money through the [[Enforcement Administration (Sweden)|Enforcement Administration]] anyway, and creditors do not usually benefit from the bankruptcy of individuals because there are costs of a [[Trustee in bankruptcy|bankruptcy manager]] which has priority. Unpaid debts remain after bankruptcy for individuals. People who are deeply in debt can obtain a debt arrangement procedure (Swedish: skuldsanering). On application, they obtain a payment plan under which they pay as much as they can for five years, and then all remaining debts are cancelled. Debts that derive from a ban on business operations (issued by court, commonly for tax fraud or fraudulent business practices) or owed to a crime victim as compensation for damages, are exempted from this—and, as before this process was introduced in 2006, remain lifelong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fattiga.se/news.php?item.51.6 |title=Evighetsgäldenärer, synpunkter från Skatteverket 2004 Skatteverkets skrivelse 041229 |language=sv |publisher=Fattiga.se |accessdate=2012-04-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314232824/http://www.fattiga.se/news.php?item.51.6 |archivedate=2012-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Debts that have not been claimed during a 3-10 year period are cancelled. Often crime victims stop their claims after a few years since criminals often do not have job incomes and might be hard to locate, while banks make sure their claims are not cancelled. The most common reasons for personal insolvency in Sweden are illness, unemployment, divorce or company bankruptcy.

For companies, formal bankruptcy is a normal effect of insolvency, even if there is a reconstruction mechanism where the company can be given time to solve its situation, e.g. by finding an investor. The formal bankruptcy involves contracting a bankruptcy manager, who makes certain that assets are sold and money divided by the priority the law claims, and no other way. Banks have such a priority. After a finished bankruptcy for a company, it is terminated. The activities might continue in a new company which has bought important assets from the bankrupted company.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main|UK insolvency law|Liquidation|Administration (insolvency)}}
[[Bankruptcy in the United Kingdom]] (in a strict legal sense) relates only to individuals (including [[Sole Trader Insolvency|sole proprietors]]) and [[partnership]]s. Companies and other [[corporation]]s enter into differently named legal insolvency procedures: [[liquidation]] and [[administration (law)|administration]] ([[administration order]] and [[administrative receivership]]). However, the term 'bankruptcy' is often used when referring to companies in the media and in general conversation. Bankruptcy in Scotland is referred to as [[sequestration (law)|sequestration]]. To apply for bankruptcy in Scotland, an individual must have more than £1,500 of debt.

A [[trustee in bankruptcy]] must be either an [[Official Receiver]] (a civil servant) or a licensed [[insolvency practitioner]]. Current law in England and Wales derives in large part from the [[Insolvency Act 1986]]. Following the introduction of the [[Enterprise Act 2002]], a UK bankruptcy now normally last no longer than 12 months, and may be less if the Official Receiver files in court a certificate that investigations are complete. It was expected that the UK Government's liberalisation of the UK bankruptcy regime would increase the number of bankruptcy cases; initially, cases increased, as the Insolvency Service statistics appear to bear out. Since 2009, the introduction of the [[Debt Relief Order]] has resulted in a dramatic fall in bankruptcies, the latest estimates for year 2014/15 being significantly less than 30,000 cases.

Bankruptcy in the United States is a matter placed under [[Law of the United States|federal jurisdiction]] by the [[United States Constitution]] (in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 4), which empowers [[United States Congress|Congress]] to enact "uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States".

While bankruptcy cases are always filed in [[United States Bankruptcy Court]] (an adjunct to the [[U.S. District Courts]]), bankruptcy cases, particularly with respect to the validity of claims and exemptions, are often dependent upon State law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 U.S. Code § 522 - Exemptions|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/522|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809225102/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/522|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Bankruptcy Exemption defines the property a debtor may retain and preserve through bankruptcy. Certain real and personal property can be exempted on "Schedule C"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/RulesAndPolicies/rules/BK_Forms_Official_2010/B_006C_0410.pdf |title=Schedule C- Property Claimed as Exempt |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610221416/http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/RulesAndPolicies/rules/BK_Forms_Official_2010/B_006C_0410.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of a debtor's bankruptcy forms, and effectively be taken outside the debtor's bankruptcy estate. Bankruptcy exemptions are available only to individuals filing bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/Bankruptcy/BankruptcyBasics/Glossary.aspx |title=Bankruptcy Exemptions Available to Individuals |publisher=Uscourts.gov |accessdate=2014-03-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310230239/http://www.uscourts.gov/FederalCourts/Bankruptcy/BankruptcyBasics/Glossary.aspx |archivedate=2014-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two alternative systems that can be used to "exempt" property from a bankruptcy estate, federal exemptions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/522 |title=Federal Bankruptcy Exemptions: 11 USC § 522 |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=2014-03-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226000317/http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/522 |archivedate=2014-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (available in some states but not all), and state exemptions (which vary widely between states). For example, Maryland and Virginia, which are adjoining states, have different personal exemption amounts that cannot be seized for payment of debts. This amount is the first $6,000 in property or cash in Maryland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Maryland, Sec. 11–504|url=http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmStatutesText.aspx?article=gcj&amp;section=11-504&amp;ext=html&amp;session=2018RS&amp;tab=subject5|website=General Assembly of Maryland|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019220929/http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmStatutesText.aspx?article=gcj&amp;section=11-504&amp;ext=html&amp;session=2018RS&amp;tab=subject5|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but normally only the first $5,000 in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Virginia, Sec. 34-4.

After a bankruptcy petition is filed, the court schedules a hearing called a ''341 meeting'' or ''meeting of creditors'', at which the bankruptcy trustee and creditors review the petitioner's petition and supporting schedules, question the petitioner, and can challenge exemptions they believe are improper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a 341(a) Meeting of Creditors?|url=http://www.canb.uscourts.gov/faq/general-bankruptcy/what-341a-meeting-creditors|website=United States Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of California|publisher=United States Courts|accessdate=14 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611070109/http://www.canb.uscourts.gov/faq/general-bankruptcy/what-341a-meeting-creditors|archivedate=11 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chapters====
There are six types of bankruptcy under the [[Title 11 of the United States Code|Bankruptcy Code]], located at Title 11 of the [[United States Code]]:
* [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]]: basic liquidation for individuals and businesses; also known as straight bankruptcy; it is the simplest and quickest form of bankruptcy available
* [[Chapter 9, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 9]]: municipal bankruptcy; a federal mechanism for the resolution of municipal debts
* [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]]: rehabilitation or reorganization, used primarily by business debtors, but sometimes by individuals with substantial debts and assets; known as corporate bankruptcy, it is a form of corporate financial reorganisation which typically allows companies to continue to function while they follow debt repayment plans
* [[Chapter 12, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 12]]: rehabilitation for family farmers and fishermen;
* [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13]]: rehabilitation with a payment plan for individuals with a regular source of income; enables individuals with regular income to develop a plan to repay all or part of their debts; also known as Wage Earner Bankruptcy
* [[Chapter 15, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 15]]: ancillary and other international cases; provides a mechanism for dealing with bankruptcy debtors and helps foreign debtors to clear debts.

An important feature applicable to all types of bankruptcy filings is the [[automatic stay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 U.S. Code § 362 - Automatic stay|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/362|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827104847/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/362|archivedate=27 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The automatic stay means that the mere request for bankruptcy protection automatically halts most lawsuits, repossessions, foreclosures, evictions, garnishments, attachments, utility shut-offs, and debt collection activity.

The most common types of [[personal bankruptcy]] for individuals are Chapter 7 and Chapter 13. Chapter 7, known as a "straight bankruptcy" involves the discharge of certain debts without repayment. Chapter 13, involves a plan of repayment of debts over a period of years. Whether a person qualifies for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 is in part determined by income.&lt;ref name="C7Basics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 7 Basics|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-7-bankruptcy-basics|website=United States Courts|publisher=Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts|accessdate=14 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629140922/http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-7-bankruptcy-basics|archivedate=29 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 7 Means Test Calculation|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/form_b_122a-2.pdf|website=United States Courts|publisher=Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts|accessdate=14 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501105632/http://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/form_b_122a-2.pdf|archivedate=1 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many as 65% of all U.S. consumer bankruptcy filings are Chapter 7 cases.

Before a consumer may obtain bankruptcy relief under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13, the debtor is to undertake [[credit counselling]] with approved counseling agencies prior to filing a bankruptcy petition and to undertake education in personal financial management from approved agencies prior to being granted a discharge of debts under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13. Some studies of the operation of the credit counseling requirement suggest that it provides little benefit to debtors who receive the counseling because the only realistic option for many is to seek relief under the Bankruptcy Code.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Yvonne D. (2007). "Bankruptcy Reform: Value of Credit Counseling Requirement Is Not Clear (GAO-07-203)". Washington, D.C.: Government Accountability Office. p. (Highlights). {{LCCN|2007414394}}. {{OCLC|156274430}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporations and other business forms normally file under Chapters 7 or 11.

=====Chapter 7=====
{{main|Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code}}
Often called "straight bankruptcy" or "simple bankruptcy," a Chapter 7 bankruptcy potentially allows debtors to eliminate most or all of their debts over a period of as little as three or four months. In a typical consumer bankruptcy, the only debts that survive a Chapter 7 are [[student loan]]s, [[child support]] obligations, some tax bills and criminal fines. Credit cards, pay day loans, personal loans, medical bills, and just about all other bills are discharged.

In Chapter 7, a debtor surrenders non-exempt property to a bankruptcy trustee, who then liquidates the property and distributes the proceeds to the debtor's unsecured creditors. In exchange, the debtor is entitled to a discharge of some debt. However, the debtor is not granted a discharge if guilty of certain types of inappropriate behavior (e.g., concealing records relating to financial condition) and certain debts (e.g., spousal and child support and most student loans). Some taxes are not discharged even though the debtor is generally discharged from debt. Many individuals in financial distress own only exempt property (e.g., clothes, household goods, an older car, or the tools of their trade or profession) and do not have to surrender any property to the trustee.&lt;ref name="C7Basics"/&gt; The amount of property that a debtor may exempt varies from state to state (as noted above, Virginia and Maryland have a $1,000 difference.) Chapter 7 relief is available only once in any eight-year period. Generally, the rights of secured creditors to their collateral continues, even though their debt is discharged. For example, absent some arrangement by a debtor to surrender a car or "reaffirm" a debt, the creditor with a [[security interest]] in the debtor's car may repossess the car even if the debt to the creditor is discharged.

Ninety-one percent of U.S. individuals who petition for relief under Chapter 7 hire an attorney to file their petitions.&lt;ref name="uscourts.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/Statistics/BankruptcyStatistics/BAPCPA/2013/Tables2A-2X.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215234421/http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/Statistics/BankruptcyStatistics/BAPCPA/2013/Tables2A-2X.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical cost of an attorney is $1,170.00.&lt;ref name="uscourts.gov"/&gt; Alternatives to filing with an attorney are: filing pro se,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/FormsAndFees/Forms/BankruptcyForms.aspx|title=Bankruptcy Forms|author=|date=|website=uscourts.gov|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505070637/http://www.uscourts.gov/FormsAndFees/Forms/BankruptcyForms.aspx|archivedate=5 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; hiring a non-lawyer petition preparer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Preparing Petitions: It Irks the Lawyers, But Is It Lawyering?|author=Adam Liptak|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/13/us/preparing-petitions-it-irks-the-lawyers-but-is-it-lawyering.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=August 13, 2002|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624170126/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/13/us/preparing-petitions-it-irks-the-lawyers-but-is-it-lawyering.html|archivedate=June 24, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or using online software to generate the petition.

To be eligible to file a consumer bankruptcy under Chapter 7, a debtor must qualify under a statutory "means test".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pewlaw.com/bankruptcy/arizona-bankruptcy-means-test/|title=Arizona Bankruptcy Means Test - Pew Law Center|newspaper=Pew Law Center|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108190251/http://pewlaw.com/bankruptcy/arizona-bankruptcy-means-test/|archivedate=2017-01-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The means test was intended to make it more difficult for a significant number of financially distressed individual debtors whose debts are primarily consumer debts to qualify for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The "means test" is employed in cases where an individual with primarily consumer debts has more than the average annual income for a household of equivalent size, computed over a 180-day period prior to filing. If the individual must "take" the "means test", their average monthly income over this 180-day period is reduced by a series of allowances for living expenses and secured debt payments in a very complex calculation that may or may not accurately reflect that individual's actual monthly budget. If the results of the means test show no disposable income (or in some cases a very small amount) then the individual qualifies for Chapter 7 relief. An individual who fails the means test will have their Chapter 7 case dismissed, or may have to convert the case to a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.

If a debtor does not qualify for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, either because of the Means Test or because Chapter 7 does not provide a permanent solution to delinquent payments for secured debts, such as mortgages or vehicle loans, the debtor may still seek relief under Chapter 13 of the Code. A Chapter 13 plan often does not require repayment to general unsecured debts, such as credit cards or medical bills.

Generally, a trustee sells most of the debtor's assets to pay off creditors. However, certain debtor assets will be protected to some extent by bankruptcy exemptions. These include Social Security payments, unemployment compensation, limited equity in a home, car, or truck, household goods and appliances, trade tools, and books. However, these exemptions vary from state to state.

=====Chapter 11=====
{{main|Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code}}
In Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the debtor retains ownership and control of assets and is re-termed a [[debtor in possession]] (DIP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 U.S. Code § 1101 - Definitions for this chapter|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1101|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019221324/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1101|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debtor in possession runs the day-to-day operations of the business while creditors and the debtor work with the Bankruptcy Court in order to negotiate and complete a plan. Upon meeting certain requirements (e.g., fairness among creditors, priority of certain creditors) creditors are permitted to vote on the proposed plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 U.S. Code § 1126 - Acceptance of plan|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1126|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019220225/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/1126|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a plan is confirmed, the debtor continues to operate and pay debts under the terms of the confirmed plan. If a specified majority of creditors do not vote to confirm a plan, additional requirements may be imposed by the court in order to confirm the plan. Debtors filing for Chapter 11 protection a second time are known informally as "Chapter 22" filers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204124204577151211961572458|title=Twinkies Maker Preparing for Chapter 11 Filing|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=January 10, 2012|first=Mike|last=Spector|first2=Julie|last2=Jargon|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709060131/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204124204577151211961572458|archivedate=July 9, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Chapter 13=====
{{main|Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code}}
In Chapter 13, debtors retain ownership and possession of all their assets, but must devote some portion of future income to repaying creditors, generally over three to five years.&lt;ref name="el"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What is Chapter 13 Bankruptcy|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/bankruptcy/chapter_13_bankruptcy.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=19 October 2017|date=15 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019220135/https://www.expertlaw.com/library/bankruptcy/chapter_13_bankruptcy.html|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of payment and period of the repayment plan depend upon a variety of factors, including the value of the debtor's property and the amount of a debtor's income and expenses.&lt;ref name="bbasics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 13 - Bankruptcy Basics|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-13-bankruptcy-basics|website=United States Courts|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020210719/http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-13-bankruptcy-basics|archivedate=20 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this chapter, the debtor can propose a repayment plan in which to pay creditors over three to five years. If the monthly income is less than the state's median income, the plan is for three years, unless the court finds "just cause" to extend the plan for a longer period. If the debtor's monthly income is greater than the median income for individuals in the debtor's state, the plan must generally be for five years. A plan cannot exceed the five-year limit.&lt;ref name="bbasics"/&gt;

Relief under Chapter 13 is available only to individuals with regular income whose debts do not exceed prescribed limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 U.S. Code § 109 - Who may be a debtor|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/109|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019220224/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/109|archivedate=19 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the debtor is an individual or a sole proprietor, the debtor is allowed to file for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy to repay all or part of the debts. Secured creditors may be entitled to greater payment than unsecured creditors.&lt;ref name="el"/&gt;

In contrast to Chapter 7, the debtor in Chapter 13 may keep all property, whether or not exempt. If the plan appears feasible and if the debtor complies with all the other requirements, the bankruptcy court typically confirms the plan and the debtor and creditors are bound by its terms. Creditors have no say in the formulation of the plan, other than to object to it, if appropriate, on the grounds that it does not comply with one of the Code's statutory requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, Rule 3015.

When the debtor completes payments pursuant to the terms of the plan, the court formally grant the debtor a discharge of the debts provided for in the plan.&lt;ref name="bbasics"/&gt; However, if the debtor fails to make the agreed upon payments or fails to seek or gain court approval of a modified plan, a bankruptcy court will normally dismiss the case on the motion of the trustee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, Rule 1017.

===Europe===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2007}}
In 2004, the number of insolvencies reached record highs in many European countries. In [[France]], company insolvencies rose by more than 4%, in [[Austria]] by more than 10%, and in [[Greece]] by more than 20%. The increase in the number of insolvencies, however, does not indicate the total financial impact of insolvencies in each country because there is no indication of the size of each case. An increase in the number of bankruptcy cases does not necessarily entail an increase in bad debt write-off rates for the economy as a whole.

Bankruptcy statistics are also a trailing indicator. There is a time delay between financial difficulties and bankruptcy. In most cases, several months or even years pass between the financial problems and the start of bankruptcy proceedings. Legal, tax, and cultural issues may further distort bankruptcy figures, especially when comparing on an international basis. Two examples:
* In [[Austria]], more than half of all potential bankruptcy proceedings in 2004 were not opened, due to insufficient funding.
* In [[Spain]], it is not economically profitable to open insolvency/bankruptcy proceedings against certain types of businesses, and therefore the number of insolvencies is quite low. For comparison: In [[France]], more than 40,000 insolvency proceedings were opened in 2004, but under 600 were opened in Spain. At the same time the average bad debt write-off rate in France was 1.3% compared to Spain with 2.6%.

The insolvency numbers for private individuals also do not show the whole picture. Only a fraction of heavily indebted households file for insolvency. Two of the main reasons for this are the stigma of declaring themselves insolvent and the potential business disadvantage.

Following the soar in insolvencies in the last decade, a number of European countries, such as France, Germany, Spain and Italy, began to revamp their bankruptcy laws in 2013. They modelled these new laws after the image of Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Currently, the majority of insolvency cases have ended in liquidation in Europe rather than the businesses surviving the crisis. These new law models are meant to change this; lawmakers are hoping to turn bankruptcy into a chance for restructuring rather than a death sentence for the companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323296504578398612178796882|title=Europe Builds Own Chapter 11|last=Ball|first=Deborah|date=2013-04-05|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-11-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122222544/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323296504578398612178796882|archivedate=2016-11-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effective sovereign bankruptcy==
Technically, states do not collapse directly due to a [[sovereign default]] event itself.  However, the tumultuous events that follow may bring down the state, so in common language we do describe states as being bankrupted.

Some examples of this are when a Korean state bankrupted Imperial China causing its destruction, or more specifically, when [[Chang'an]]'s ([[Sui Dynasty]]) war with [[Pyongyang]] ([[Goguryeo]]) in 614 A.D. ended in the former's disintegration within 4 years, although the latter also seemingly entered into decline and fell some 56 years later.&lt;ref&gt;"Koguryo". Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved October 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example is when the United States, with heavy financial backing from its allies (creditors), bankrupted the [[Soviet Union]] which led to the latter's demise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wais.stanford.edu/History/history_ussrandreagan.htm|title=The Collapse of the Soviet Union and Ronald Reagan|author=|date=|website=wais.stanford.edu|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322191321/http://wais.stanford.edu/History/history_ussrandreagan.htm|archivedate=22 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8802">{{for|the seventeenth century French revolt|Revolt of the papier timbré}}

The '''''bonnets rouges''''' (red caps) movement began in October, 2013 in [[Brittany]]. It was a protest movement, largely targeting a new tax on truck-transport (billed as an "''[[ecotax]]e''" by the government). Through a combination of demonstrations and violent actions, which included the destruction of many highway tax portals, the movement forced the French government to rescind the tax.

[[File:Portique anti-écotaxe.JPG|thumb|An anti-tax sign affixed to an “ecotaxe” portal a few days before it was destroyed]]

The protesters considered the tax harmful to Breton agriculture, which was already having a difficult time competing with its counterparts in Europe.

They wore red caps, in reference to the seventeenth century [[revolt of the papier timbré]] which was particularly active in Brittany, though the [[Phrygian cap]] as a protest symbol goes back much further.

== Activity ==
Hundreds of red-cap-wearing demonstrators protested against the highway tax portal at Pont-de-Buis on 28 October 2013, and during the course of the protest a demonstrator had his hand blown off when he picked up a grenade thrown by law enforcement.

Soon after, the French government announced that it would be temporarily suspending the new tax until 2015 at the earliest.&lt;ref&gt;“[http://www.menafn.com/1093714583/France-delays-ecotax-on-road-transport-after-protests France delays ‘ecotax’ on road transport after protests]” ''MENAFN'' 29 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

This did not satisfy the demonstrators, who went on to destroy more than two dozen tax portals, and many smaller radar-camera-like outposts, by the first week of November.&lt;ref&gt;“[http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/11/06/france-tax-idINL5N0IR2JF20131106 France’s Hollande defies Breton tax protest]” ''Reuters'' 6 November 2013; “[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article3914235.ece?CMP=OTH-gnws-standard-2013_11_05 Lorry spy destroyed in green tax protest]” ''The Times'' 6 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; These would typically be destroyed by fire, often by filling tires, stacked at their bases, with flammable material and lighting them. Sometimes, less-destructive means were used, such as wrapping the radar cameras in plastic and topping them with ''bonnets rouges'' of their own.&lt;ref&gt;“[http://www.republicain-lorrain.fr/actualite/2013/11/15/les-six-radars-deguises-en-bretons Haut-Doubs: les six radars déguisés en «Bretons»]” ''Le Républicain Lorrain'' 15 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

By late November, 46 tax radars and portals had been destroyed, and other anti-tax groups were beginning to try direct action, including farmers and equestrians who snarled traffic in Paris with their tractors and horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/24/france-equestrian-tax-protest-paris |title=French horse riders take tax protest on to streets of Paris |last=Willsher |first=Kim |date=2013-11-24 |work=The Guardian |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of November, the movement massed in Carhaix and simultaneously used shipping trucks to blockade highways throughout France.&lt;ref&gt;“[http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/france-la-crise-sociale/20131130.OBS7696/bretagne-plus-de-30-000-bonnets-rouges-dans-la-rue.html Bretagne : les Bonnets rouges gagnent le pari de la mobilisation]” ''L’Obs'' 30 November 2013; “[http://lci.tf1.fr/economie/social/grogne-contre-l-ecotaxe-ce-samedi-la-liste-de-barrages-routiers-8321689.html Manifestations anti-écotaxe : la liste des barrages routiers dans toute la France]” ''MYTF1 News'' 29 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  At one point the demonstrators held an auction at which they sold off bits and pieces of previously-destroyed road tax portals as souvenirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lesechos.fr/30/11/2013/lesechos.fr/0203159681148_ecotaxe---les-bonnets-ont-reussi-leur-demonstration.htm#851cSulkQoMQMmSA.99 |title=Ecotaxe : les Bonnets ont réussi leur démonstration  |date=30 November 2013 |work=Les Echos |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an amusing moment, a hundred employees of Ecomouv, the quasi-private company responsible for collecting the new tax, held a holiday party in Metz. Posing for a group photo in front of the company offices in their [[Santa Claus]] hats, police mistook them for a demonstration of the ''bonnets rouges'', and they quickly intervened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2013/12/20/des-salaries-d-ecomouv-qui-fetaient-noel-pris-pour-des-bonnets-rouges_968063 |title=Des salariés d'Ecomouv qui fêtaient Noël pris pour des bonnets rouges |date=20 December 2013 |work=Libération |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By January, the number of highway tax and radar-ticket machines destroyed had topped 200.&lt;ref&gt;“[http://www.networkvisio.com/n31-france/article-fronde-des-bonnets-rouges-plus-de-125-radars-vandalises-en.html?id=6747 Fronde des Bonnets Rouges : plus de 250 radars vandalisés en trois mois]” ''Network Visio'' 17 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This had the desired effect. In 2013, for the first time since ticket-giving radar cameras had been installed in France, the number of tickets issued by the machines declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/automobile/2013/12/17/30002-20131217ARTFIG00464-radars-en-2013-les-automobilistes-ont-ete-moins-flashes.php |title=Radars : en 2013, les automobilistes ont été moins flashés |last=Duportail |first=Judith |date=2013-12-17 |work=Le Figaro |language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government made its first big counterattacks in the Spring. Eleven suspected ''bonnets rouges'' were arrested and charged with conspiracy in April.&lt;ref&gt;“[http://www.letelegramme.fr/bretagne/radars-bretons-un-sur-quatre-a-disparu-19-04-2014-10130833.php Radars bretons.

Destruction of highway tax portals, however, continued. The eleven conspirators were convicted and sentenced to between four and 18 months imprisonment, along with a total of about €10,000 in fines. The same day the sentences were declared, farmers in Brittany invaded the city of Morlaix, dumped their produce in big piles in the streets, set fire to the tax office, and blockaded the area to keep fire trucks from responding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29294096 |title=French farmers torch tax office |date=2014-09-20 |work=BBC News |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September and October, three other French tax offices were put to the torch, and French tax officials complained of feeling threatened.&lt;ref&gt;“[http://www.economiematin.fr/news-ras-le-bol-fiscal-incendies-perceptions-revolution Ras-le-bol-fiscal : Quatre perceptions ont brûlé depuis la rentrée]” ''économie matin'' 3 October 2014; “[http://www.lefigaro.fr/impots/2014/10/02/05003-20141002ARTFIG00256-les-agents-des-impots-craignent-d-etre-les-victimes-de-la-fronde-fiscale.php Les agents des impôts craignent d'être les victimes de la «fronde fiscale»]” ''Le Figaro'' 2 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The French government finally decided, in late October, to abandon the hated tax entirely. The cost to the government was enormous. In addition to the loss of anticipated revenue from the tax (€390 million per year) and the property damage and other costs associated with the demonstrations, the government was required to pay compensation to Ecomouv, the quasi-private company that had contracted to administer the tax, and others — nearly one billion euros in all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2015/02/20/l-abandon-de-l-ecotaxe-coutera-pres-d-un-milliard-d-euros-a-l-etat_4580664_3244.html |title=L’abandon de l’écotaxe coûtera près d’un milliard d’euros à l’Etat |last=Rémi |first=Barroux |date=20 February 2015 |work=Le Monde |language=fr-FR |trans-title=The abandonment of the eco-tax will cost the state nearly 1 billion euros}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The senior treasurer of the journal is Professor James Crawford A.C. S.C. and the current editors-in-chief are Daniel Clarry, Valentin Jeutner and Cameron Miles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cjicl.org.uk/thejournal/editors-2013-2014/|title=Editors 2013-2014 - CJICL|work=CJICL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CJICL Annual Conference ==

The journal hosts an International and Comparative Law Conference annually at Cambridge, usually at St John’s Divinity School. The first Conference   discussed the theme "Agents of Change: The Individual as a Participant in the Legal Process" and was attended by about. 110 participants from all over the world - Europe, the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia – and at all stages in their academic career: from graduate students and young academics to established professors and practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cam.ac.uk/press/news/2012/05/launch-of-the-cambridge-journal-of-international-and-comparative-law-cjicl/1879|title=Launch of the Cambridge Journal of International and Comparative Law (CJICL)|work=cam.ac.uk|access-date=2013-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806023008/http://www.law.cam.ac.uk/press/news/2012/05/launch-of-the-cambridge-journal-of-international-and-comparative-law-cjicl/1879#|archive-date=2012-08-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The second annual conference was held in May, 2013 on the theme of "Legal Tradition in a Diverse World", which saw ca. 150 participants presenting over 50 papers  and included a key note address by [[Judge Yusuf]] of the International Court of Justice, a key note debate between Professors [[James Crawford (jurist)|James Crawford]] and [[Alain Pellet]] chaired by Professor Catherine Redgwell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.all-souls.ox.ac.uk/people.php?personid=2203|title=All Souls College, Oxford|work=ox.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a key note lecture by Professor [[H. Patrick Glenn]].

== UK Supreme Court Review ==

The journal publishes an annual special issue, the 'UK Supreme Court Review' that   examines the decisions of the UK Supreme Court from the preceding judicial year. It is the only journal to produce a full issue review of the previous three terms of the work of the UK Supreme Court. I &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cjicl.org.uk/thejournal/cjicl/|title=About the CJICL - CJICL|work=CJICL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The past two issues of the UK Supreme Court Review have featured articles from judges of the highest appellate courts internationally, including, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers (formerly the President of the UK Supreme Court), Justice Marie Deschamps of the Supreme Court of Canada, Justice Hayne of the High Court of Australia, and Justice Gummow (formerly of the High Court of Australia).

== CJICL Online ==

The journal also maintains an online platform (called CJICL Online) which aims to provide a forum for discussion of on-going legal affairs related to the subject.

{{canon law}}
'''''Cathedraticum''''' (a [[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]] word from ''[[cathedra]]'', episcopal seat or throne) is a specified sum of money to be paid annually toward a [[bishop]]. It is a mark of honour and a sign of subjection to the [[cathedral]] church, from which its name is derived.
 
==History==
{{main|Legal history of the Catholic Church}}
In [[Early Christianity]], financing the bishop was tendered rather through custom than by [[canon law]]. The earliest legislation on the subject seems to be a canon of the [[Second Council of Braga]] (572); according to its decree, only [[parish church]]es and [[chapter (religion)|chapter]]s were obliged to pay the cathedraticum (Can. Placuit, 10, qu. 3), because at the time of the Council of Braga the sacraments were administered to the faithful in parochial churches only.

When in the course of time, many other ecclesiastical edifices were built and endowed, it was judged proper that these also should pay the cathedraticum. Hence Pope [[Honorius III]] made a universal law (cap. Conquerente, de Off. Ordin.) that not only chapters and parish churches, but also endowed chapels and benefices should be subject to the same tax (Rota coram Tan. decis, 228), which was to be paid to the bishop on the occasion of his annual [[Canonical Visitation|visitation]] of his diocese. The amount of the cathedraticum was fixed in ancient times at two solidi (coins; a [[solidus (coin)|solidus]] was one seventy-second part of a pound of gold). According to canonists, this remains the obligatory amount of the tax, unless custom establishes a different sum. If a smaller amount than the original tax becomes customary in a diocese, the bishop must be content with this reduced pension, nor can he command a return to the higher sum (S. C. C. in Amalph., 1705). In general it is presumed that the quantity of the cathedraticum will be determined by reasonable custom according to the exigencies of various dioceses and countries. Where custom has not fixed the sum, the S. [[Congregation of the Council]] declared that either the amount paid by a neighbouring diocese or the equivalent of the original two solidi must be taken as the proper tax (In Albin., 1644).

The [[regular clergy]] are not obliged to pay the cathedraticum for their monasteries and conventual churches, as is expressly stated in the "Corpus Juris" (cap. Inter cætera, viii, caus. 10). The reason is found in the very idea of the cathedraticum, which is given by a church or benefice in sign of subjection to the jurisdiction of the bishop. As exempt regulars are immediately subject to the Holy See, there is no obligation on them to pay the cathedraticum. In the case, however, that regulars administer parish churches or secular benefices, they are subject to the tax, inasmuch as such institutions fall under diocesan law. It has also been declared that confraternities which have no churches in the strict sense of the word, but only chapels, are exempt from this episcopal tax ("In Firmana, Cathedr."). As the cathedraticum pertains to episcopal rights, it is privileged and consequently no prescription can totally abrogate it. This is expressly declared by the S. Congregation of the Council (In Amalph., 1707), when it decrees that no contrary custom, even of immemorial antiquity, can exempt from the payment of this tax. It is also to be noted that, according to the common law, the cathedraticum is to be uniform for all institutions in a diocese, without regard to the opulence or poverty of the benefices.

Owing to the phraseology of the [[Council of Trent]] (Sess. XXIV, cap. ii), a controversy arose as to whether this council had abrogated the cathedraticum. The S. Congregation of the Council gave the following interpretation: "The Council did not abolish the cathedraticum; but desired that it be paid, not at the time of the episcopal visitation, but rather at the diocesan synod." It is owing to the custom of paying this tax at the synod that the name synodaticum has been given to it. By law, however, there is, strictly speaking, no fixed time for making this payment. For although as a rule it is customary to do so in the synod, yet custom or agreement can place it at another time. In fact the S. Congregation of the Council has declared that the cathedraticum must be paid, even in those years in which no diocesan synod is celebrated (In Perus., Cathedr., 1735). As the cathedraticum is a mark of subjection to the cathedral church, the bishop cannot exempt any benefice from this tax. On the other hand, he cannot demand it from clerics or priests who have no benefices, even though he plead ancient custom to the contrary (S. C. Ep. In Compsan., 1694). He can require it, however, from the diocesan seminary if benefices have been incorporated with it. In like manner he can demand the cathedraticum from monasteries with which secular churches and benefices have been united. An exception to this law was made, however, for the Order of St. John of Jerusalem in 1630.

All this concerns the laws on the cathedraticum where the Church is canonically established. Obviously, in so-called missionary countries, where benefices are practically unknown, such laws cannot apply. As, however, it is only equitable that the diocese should support its bishop, especially as he has no episcopal benefice, a pension which retains the canonical name of cathedraticum is usually paid to the bishop in most missionary countries. There is no uniform law on the subject. The question necessarily occupied the attention of various synods and the conclusion was unanimous that a tax analogous to the cathedraticum should be imposed on dioceses for the support of their bishops. Thus the Eighth [[Provincial Council of Baltimore]], held in 1855, declared in its seventh decree: "As it is just that the bishop who watches over the salvation of all, should receive from all the faithful of the diocese whatever is necessary for his proper support and for enabling him to execute his office, we decree that he may demand for this purpose a part of the revenues of all churches in which the care of souls is exercised". The Cardinal Prefect of the Propaganda, writing to the bishops of the Province of Cincinnati in 1857, says: "The right of the bishop to receive support from his diocese has been recognized; nevertheless, the application and determination of the means of support can best be treated of in diocesan synods, because cognizance can then be taken of the state and condition of each diocese". The Provincial Council of New Orleans in 1856 calls this subsidy the "right of cathedraticum, either to sustain the bishop or to provide for various necessities of the diocese". It states that each bishop of the province should determine the amount in a diocesan synod. In Canada, the Provincial Council of Halifax in 1857 declares: "As the bishop is constituted not for one part but for all parts of his diocese, and as he labours and watches for all alike, all are obliged to contribute for his proper sustenance". The [[Second Plenary Council of Baltimore]] in 1866, likewise states that "it is evidently equitable and just that all the faithful of each diocese should contribute to the support of their bishop, who bears the solicitude for all".

As to the determination of the quantity of the cathedraticum, we find the First Provincial Council of Cincinnati requesting [[Propaganda Fide]] to sanction some uniform method, but the latter preferred to commit this to the diocesan synods. In the acts of the First Provincial Council of Quebec in 1851, we fine the following scheme "proposed" to Propaganda. It is there said to be similar to that already sanctioned for some bishops in Canada and Ireland: each bishop is to receive a third of the revenues of one or two parishes; or the fourth or fifth part of three or four parishes; or the tenth part of practically all the parishes in his diocese, having regard to the circumstances of each parish. Propaganda sanctioned the employment of the last-named provision in 1852. In the Province of Halifax, Canada, it was decreed in 1857 that a collection be taken up annually in October for the support of the bishops. In England, the Third Provincial Council of Westminster in 1859 placed the amount of the cathedraticum at one half pound sterling. It declared that the liability to pay this tax was obligatory on each cathedral chapter; on priests ordained for the mission, who receive salaries from churches or oratories; on those who have the [[cure of souls]]; and on all who preside over churches and public oratories unless they can prove a special exemption.

In the United States, the Eighth [[Provincial Council of Baltimore]], when vindicating the right of the bishop to part of the revenues of the churches, enumerates as such revenues, the renting of pews, the collections taken up during Mass and the offerings made at baptisms and marriages. An identical decree was adopted by the Second Council of the Province of Australia in 1869, but Propaganda did not sanction it and declared that the matter should preferably be determined by the various diocesan synods. This was likewise the opinion of the Fathers of the Second Plenary Council of Baltimore in 1866. As a consequence, different methods of computing the cathedraticum prevail throughout the United States. In one prominent diocese, for example, the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of each church must pay one-fifth of his revenue if it exceed one thousand dollars, or one-third if it be less. The revenue in question is declared to be made up of the [[pew rent]]s, the collections during Divine service and the [[funeral stipend]]s. Finally the diocesan arrangement for the cathedraticum has been declared by Propaganda Fide (as in 1872) to be a binding law on those whom it concerns.

'''House Resolution 2796''' ('''HR 2796''', The Civil Rights Uniformity Act of 2017) is a bill in the [[United States House of Representatives]] that was introduced on June 7, 2017 by Representative [[Pete Olson]] [R-TX-22] and originally cosponsored by Reps. [[Brian Babin]] [R-TX-36], [[Ralph Abraham (politician)|Ralph Lee Abraham]] [R-LA-5], and [[Vicky Hartzler]] [R-MO-4].&lt;ref name=115HR2796&gt;{{USBill|115|H.R.|2796|pipe=Text of the Civil Rights Uniformity Act of 2017 |site=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed legislation would prohibit the interpretation of the word "sex" or "gender" to include "gender identity," and would require the terms "man" or "woman" to refer exclusively to a person's biologically-assigned gender in the interpretation of federal civil rights laws, federal administrative agency regulations, and federal guidance. The bill has attracted five additional cosponsors since its introduction.

According to the bill summary,
{{quote |text=This bill prohibits the word "sex" or "gender" from being interpreted to mean "gender identity," and requires "man" or "woman" to be interpreted to refer exclusively to a person's genetic sex, for purposes determining the meaning of federal civil rights laws or related federal administrative agency regulations or guidance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No federal civil rights law shall be interpreted to treat gender identity or transgender status as a protected class, unless it expressly designates "gender identity" or "transgender status" as a protected class. |source=HR 2796 Summary&lt;ref name=115HR2796 /&gt; }}

Rep.

==Bill Text==
'''A BILL'''
To repeal executive overreach, to clarify that the proper constitutional authority for social transformation belongs to the legislative branch.

:''Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,''
'''SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.'''

This Act may be cited as the “Civil Rights Uniformity Act of 2017”.

'''SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSE.'''

{{ordered list |style=margin-left: 2 em |type=lower-latin
 |Findings.—Congress finds the following:
 {{ordered list |style=margin-left: 2 em |type=decimal
  |Over the past half century, Congress has passed numerous civil rights laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of “sex”, a designation long understood to be grounded in objective biology up to the present day. There is no evidence that Congress or the American people ever understood the word sex or gender in civil rights laws to include subjective self-identification.
  |For years, advocates have pressed Congress to include a person’s subjective self-declared “gender identity” in Federal civil rights laws that prohibit sex discrimination. Congress has declined to do so except for the [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act|Shepard-Byrd Act of 2009]] and the [[Violence Against Women Act#2012–2013 legislative battle and reauthorization|Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013]] where gender identity is defined as “actual or perceived gender-related characteristics” with “gender”, there referring to characteristics associated with biological males and females.
  |This demonstrates that when Congress wants to protect sex, it does so explicitly; when it wants to also elevate gender identity it does so explicitly; and when it does not want to elevate gender identity, it can do so either explicitly or by simply not disturbing the status quo.
  |Despite the complete clarity of this point, President Barack Obama’s administration has attempted to effectively replace the word “sex” with the phrase “gender identity” for purposes of Federal antidiscrimination law and policy through a series of unilateral executive actions.
  |For example, on December 15, 2014, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Department of Justice would reinterpret the ban on “sex” discrimination under [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VII|title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] to encompass “gender identity”. This was followed on March 27, 2015, by an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission decision holding that declining to use a female pronoun to address a male who identifies as female constituted “sex” discrimination under title VII.
  |On May 9, 2016, the Obama administration sued the State of North Carolina and threatened it with fines and loss of Federal funding if it did not adopt the administration’s incorrect readings of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and [[title IX]] of the [[Education Amendments of 1972]].
  |On May 13, 2016, the Departments of Justice and Education issued a “significant guidance” letter stating that under title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 “when a school provides sex-segregated activities and facilities, transgender students must be allowed to participate in such activities and access such facilities consistent with their gender identity.” The guidance further states that schools “must treat a student’s gender identity as the student’s sex” including in the context of “sex-segregated restrooms, locker rooms, shower facilities, housing, and athletic teams, as well as single-sex classes.” In other words, the Departments consider it a title IX violation if a person of the male sex who self-identifies as a female is not granted unfettered access to women’s or girls’ dorms, showers, locker rooms, and bathrooms. This, despite assurance that such a thing would never happen from the likes of Ruth Bader Ginsburg who wrote in 1975 that “separate places to disrobe, sleep, perform personal bodily functions are permitted, in some situations required, by regard for individual privacy.” This position was codified in Federal regulations, {{CodeFedReg|34|106|33}}, which state that recipients of Federal funds “may provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex,” with sex obviously referring to biology.
  |Also on May 13, 2016, the Department of Health and Human Services finalized regulations that redefined the Affordable Care Act’s prohibition on “sex” discrimination in federally funded health programs and activities to cover “gender identity”, thereby opening health care professionals and insurers to extensive liability if they decline to participate in or pay for “gender transition” treatments or “sex change” operations.
  |The Obama administration’s actions are an affront to the rule of law, the separation of powers, the will of the people, language, history, safety, privacy, and biological realities.
 }}
 |Purpose.—The purposes of this Act are—
 {{ordered list |style=margin-left: 2 em |type=decimal
  |to prevent the executive branch from unilaterally rewriting Federal civil rights laws by enacting or implementing any policy or undertaking any enforcement action that is based on construing the term “sex” or “gender” to mean “gender identity”; and
  |to ensure that gender identity is not treated as a protected class in Federal law or policy without the affirmative approval of the people’s representatives in Congress.
 }}
}}
'''SEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF POLICIES REDEFINING SEX TO MEAN GENDER IDENTITY.'''

{{ordered list |style=margin-left: 2 em |type=lower-latin
 |Rule Of Construction.—In determining the meaning of any Federal civil rights law, and of any related ruling, regulation, guidance, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the words “sex” and “gender” and their equivalents shall not be interpreted to mean “gender identity” or its equivalent, and the words “man” and “woman” and their equivalents shall refer exclusively to a person’s genetic sex.
 |Rule Of Interpretation.—No Federal civil rights law shall be interpreted to treat gender identity or transgender status as a protected class, unless such law expressly designates “gender identity” or “transgender status” as a protected class.
 |Definition Of “Federal Civil Rights Law”.—For purposes of this Act, the term “Federal civil rights law” means any Federal law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex or gender, including title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 ({{USC|20|1681}} et seq.), the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] ({{USC|42|2000a}} et seq.), the [[Fair Housing Act]] ({{USC|42|3601}} et seq.), the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] ({{USPL|111|148}}), and any other Federal law or provision thereof prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex or gender.

The '''Constitution of Zaire''' ({{lang-fr|Constitution du Zaïre}}), was [[Promulgation|promulgated]] on 15 August 1974, revised on 15 February 1978, and [[Constitutional amendment|amended]] on 5 July 1990. Defining state power as an extension of the individual powers of [[Mobutu Sese Seko]], the 1974 constitution codified Zaire as a [[One-party state|one-party]] [[dictatorship]] and enshrined the status of [[Mobutism]] as the state ideology, together with the dominant position of the ruling [[Popular Movement of the Revolution]] (MPR) party.{{sfn|Young|Turner|1985|p=64}} The 1974 constitution was the third in the [[History of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo's post-independence history]], replacing earlier constitutions adopted to replace the original [[basic law]] of 1960, adopted [[Luluabourg Constitution|in 1964]] and 1967.{{sfn|Young|Turner|1985|p=41}}{{sfn|Historical Dictionary of the DRC|2010|pp=110-1}}

According to academics [[M. Crawford Young]] and [[Thomas Turner (academic)|Thomas Turner]], the 1974 constitution should be seen as the culmination of a period of Zairean political history beginning in 1970.{{sfn|Young|Turner|1985|pp=63-4}} The phase was marked by growing national self-confidence and the emergence of Mobutu's ''[[Authenticité (Zaire)|Authenticité]]'' policy to remove non-"authenic" foreign influences from Zairean society.{{sfn|Young|Turner|1985|pp=63-4}} Young and Turner describe the 1974 constitution as the "normative embodiment of the Mobutist state at its apogee" and argued that it was an unprecedented legal expression of "centralized, untrammelled personal power".{{sfn|Young|Turner|1985|p=69}} Under the provisions of the Constitution, the MPR was recognised as Zaire's only "institution" and its president as President of Zaire itself with total power over government and judiciary (Articles 28 and 30). Mobutism was declared the state ideology (Article 46) and all Zaireans were automatically made members of the MPR (Article 8).{{sfn|Young|Turner|1985|p=69}} Mobutu himself was exempted from the restrictions on power mentioned in the document and given the power to unilaterally modify the document at will.{{sfn|Young|Turner|1985|p=70}} The state of Zaire's legal system as established by the constitution led [[Marcel Lihau]], a jurist and former president of the Supreme Court of Justice who had fled the country, to remark that "Mobutu is the constitution in Zaire".{{sfn|West Africa|1988|p=521}} Young and Turner did, however, note that the "Mobutist state never approximated the leviathan vision embodied in the constitution".{{sfn|Young|Turner|1985|p=70}} In particular, after [[Shaba I]] and [[Shaba II]] invasions (1977–78), Mobutu was forced to liberalize Zaire's political structure to allow contested elections and a degree of political dissent.{{sfn|Historical Dictionary of the DRC|2010|p=112}}

The 1974 constitution remained in force, with some subsequent modifications, until the collapse of the Mobutu regime during the [[First Congo War]]. In 1994, the first of two Transitional Constitutions were adopted; the current [[Constitution of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] was adopted in 2006.{{sfn|Historical Dictionary of the DRC|2010|p=113}}

In [[finance]] and [[financial law]], '''dematerialization''' refers to the substitution of paper-form [[Security (finance)|securities]] by [[book-entry]] securities.  This is a form of [[indirect holding system]] where an intermediary, such as a [[Brokerage firm|broker]] or [[central securities depository]], or the issuer itself (e.g., French system) holds a record of the ownership of shares usually in electronic format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.icicidirect.com/newsiteContent/Institute/equities/basics_on_stock_market_5.html?height=450&amp;width=650 |title=What Is Dematerialization? |publisher=[[ICICI Bank]] |accessdate=December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9_8UW_H72NsC&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=dematerialisation%20securities&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q=dematerialisation%20securities&amp;f=false |title=Property Rights in Investment Securities and the Doctrine of Specificity |author=Erica Johansson |date=2009 |page=41 |isbn=978-3-540-85903-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dematerialization of securities such as stocks has been a major trend since the late 1960s, with the result that by 2010 the majority of global securities were held in dematerialized form.

==History==
Although the phenomenon is ancient, since [[Book entry|book-entry]] systems for recording securities have been noted from civilisations as early as [[Assyria]] in 2000 BC, it gained new prominence with the advent of computer technology in the late 20th century. Even during the period when [[Stock certificate|paper certificates]] were popular, book-entry systems continued since many small firms could not afford printing secured paper-form securities.  These book-entry securities were often held under the control of an attorney who acts as a [[notary]] to certify the existence of the securities, as well as their authenticity.

Since the 1960, dematerialization has effected more and more listed companies in the United States and more recently in the [[European Union]], where dematerialized securities represent often more than 99% of the securities listed on [[regulated markets]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/financial-markets/docs/securities-law/first_consultation_summary_en.pdf "Summary of responses received in respect of the EU consultation on legal certainty of securities holding and transactions"], European Commission&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the phenomena of dematerialization of [[Security (finance)|securities]] issued by large firms is mostly undertaken via [[Central Securities Depository]], a national or regional institution holding the notary function, such as the [[Depository Trust Company]] (DTC) in the United States or [[Euroclear]] Group in part of the EU, which itself entrusts banks and investment firms to act as intermediaries between issuers and investors for the custody of these securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/WhitePapers/Dematerialize_Securities_July_2012.pdf |title=A proposal to fully dematerialize physical securities |publisher=DTCC |date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, dematerialized securities are often referred as intermediated securities, in particular by the [[Unidroit convention on substantive rules for intermediated securities]].

'''Dynalite''' is a lighting and automation control system developed in Sydney, Australia by a company of the same name. In 2009 the company was bought by Philips to become Philips-Dynalite. The system is commonly used for [[Lighting control system|lighting control]], [[building automation]], [[home automation]] and [[room automation]] applications and is sold worldwide.

==System design==
The Dynalite system consists of:

User Interfaces - Switches, panels, motion and heat sensors, touch screens and recently IOS devices,

Panels are typically standard sized (Australian or European standard size) wall switch plates, but instead of normal rocker switches, they have buttons of various designs, usually with an indicator LED inside.

Output devices - Dimmers, Relays, LED drivers and [[Digital Addressable Lighting Interface|DALI]], [[Digital_Serial_Interface|DSI]] and [[0-10_V_lighting_control|0–10&amp;nbsp;volt]] controllers.

The dimmers range anywhere from a single 240&amp;nbsp;V relay controller to leading and trailing edge 1-20 amp [[dimmer]] devices.

Network Backbone Devices:
Network connectors extend the range of the network, as well as providing integration with other technologies such as AMX, Crestron, etc.

Through the 100-BT device, the communication network can be extended over TCP/IP networks, which also allows the use of computer systems which can integrate into the system.

==Areas and channels==

The network components are all used to set a system of Areas and Channels. Any given lighting, fan, louvre, and relay circuit is a Channel in an Area.

For example, a house might have 3 rooms. Each room is called an Area. The kitchen may contain overhead lights, a range-hood fan and lights over the bench. These three are called Channels.

Those Areas and Channels are in states called Presets. In Preset 1, typically, all lights etc. are fully on, in Preset 4, all of the lights are off. This is all customisable either by the programmer, or if it has been allowed, by the end user as well.

So, sending 'Area 3 Preset 4' will turn off the lights in Area 3 (room 3). Sending 'Area 3 Preset 2' will set the lights to a low level, which is customisable.

Channels can also be sent presets aside from the preset of the area to which they belong. 'Area 3 Preset 4' turns off the lights, then 'Area 3 Channel 7 Preset 1' will turn that light back on.

==Communications==
Dynalite components communicate using [[DyNet]]. The physical layer consists of a modified [[RS-485]] TIA/EIA-485-A serial bus running along CAT5 cable, blue and blue/white carry the hot and cold signal respectively, orange and orange/white carry +12&amp;nbsp;V DC, green and green/white carry 0&amp;nbsp;V, Brown and Brown/white are unused. End of line termination is required &lt;ref&gt;http://lighting.philips.com/pwc_li/main/subsites/dynalite/library_support/assets/technical_guides/control_principles_rev_d.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DyNet 1''' is the most commonly used protocol over the bus, being messages of 8 bytes of data, the 8th byte being a checksum. Data is send at speed of 9600 [[baud]], 8 bits, no parity, 1 stopbit (8N1). Commonly there are two types of message sent via DyNet 1: logical and physical. Logical messages talk to Areas and Channels, and physical messages talk directly to the devices. These 2 are typically called 1C and 5C messages, on account of the first byte of their message.

A 1C message consist of: [1C] [Area] [Data 1] [OpCode] [Data 2] [Data 3] [Join] [Checksum]

Area is the Logical Area the message is to control.

OpCode defines the Action to be taken on the Area.

Join is a bitswitch which can be used to filter out selected channels.

An OpCode of 00 to 03 means the action is to send the given area into preset 1 to 4 plus 8 times the value of Data 3 over the time specified by Data 1 and Data 2.

An OpCode of 0A to 0D means the action is to send the given area into preset 5 to 8 plus 8 times the value of Data 3 over the time specified by Data 1 and Data 2.

That gives a possibility of 8 × 255 presets. A usual job uses 4 to 8, and generally preset 4 is reserved to 'Off' or 'all to 0%'.

'''DyNet 2''' is used mainly to upload data to devices on the network. It allows larger messages of data to be sent at higher speeds (115200 [[baud]]), significantly reducing lag time.

==Advantages==

Each device contains its own [[programmable logic controller]] and follows the [[peer-to-peer]] model, the main advantage of this is that there is no reliance on a single central controller, the system is capable of a high level of [[Resilience (network)|resilience]] and therefore well suited to situations where total failure could be a safety issue, such as lighting systems in public places.

The 'Message on Change' system only sends a message every time a lighting state is to change, as opposed to the [[DMX512|DMX]] protocol, which is constantly streaming the entire data-map. This allows for much more devices on a single bus, but also leads to missed messages - as below.

As most of the [[DyNet]] is openly published, it is possible to integrate with third party devices.

==Disadvantages==

The DyNet protocol offers no error correction or transmission control, each network message is sent on a 'best effort' basis. This means that if a transmitted message is corrupted or missed by a receiving device, there is nothing to pick up that the message was not received, but also makes for much faster communication and response to user input in ideal situations.
The design opens the possibility of devices missing messages. In the case of a user pushing a button to turn on a light, this does not present a large problem as the user will probably notice and press the button again, but if it is an automated message say, from a timeclock, there is potential for an important message turning on outside lights of a shopping center to be missed. The usual workaround for this is to simply send the important message twice or more.

The previous Dynalite programming software (dLight 2) commonly in use up to 2011, (and still sometimes used for older equipment) was built progressively upon a Windows 3.11 application, and hides many undocumented keyboard shortcuts which are necessary to program a system.

The Envision editor was launched in 2010 and is designed to be more intuitive and easy to use. It is designed for programmers - it is not expected that end users will be able to set up their own systems, one needs training (usually free) provided by Dynalite distributors.

==Jurisprudence==
"Ex tempore" is a legal term that means 'at the time'. A judge who hands down a decision in a case soon or straight after hearing it is delivering a decision ''ex tempore''. Another way a judge may deliver a decision is to [[Reserved decision|reserve his decision]] and deliver it later in written form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In [[Australia]], intermediate-level courts tend to have a heavy case load, and so many decisions are delivered ''ex tempore'' for reasons of time and necessity. Because many decisions are ''ex tempore'', intermediate-level courts' decisions are not binding on inferior courts - that is to say, that in [[New South Wales]], the District Court's decisions are not binding on the Local Court (see Valentine v Eid (1992) 27 NSWLR 615 and ''[[stare decisis]]'').

Ex tempore decisions are not binding on later courts due to the quick nature of their delivery after the hearing of a case. Therefore, these decisions are of persuasive authority only and a later court, dealing with a case of similar facts, can reach a different conclusion if it is appropriate and the court in question believes that their decision is more suitable.

The '''Anderson case''' took place in [[Canada West]] from 1860 to 1861. The case dealt with whether or not to extradite an escaped slave to the United States on the charge of murder. The majority of the presiding judges who handled the case agreed that there was sufficient evidence to prove criminality of the extraditable offence. The decision was based upon the terms laid out in Article X of the [[Webster–Ashburton Treaty]] of 1842. Anderson was released, however, on a technicality.

==Background==

John Anderson was an [[African-American]] slave who escaped to Canada, evading the pursuit of bounty hunters. While on the run he killed a farmer from [[Howard County, Missouri]]. Anderson stabbed the farmer, Seneca Digges, who died shortly after. Digges intended to legally recapture Anderson, and ultimately send him back into his master’s custody. Anderson lived and worked in [[Canada West]] from 1854 to April 1860, managing to keep a low profile. He was eventually arrested and held by Magistrate William Matthews in [[Brantford, Ontario]].

==Legal and political significance==
[[File:John Anderson ILNv38p223.jpg|thumb|left|From the Illustrated London News 1861]]
Some have argued that the Anderson case, aside from igniting a media, legal, and political frenzy, had a profound impact on Canada’s future relationship with Britain (Brode 1989, Farwell 1912, Reinders 1975). It also set an important precedent for Canadian leaders to make the superior courts handle the most political divisive decisions, which had originally been reserved for the executive branch of government.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Brode (1989), ''The Odyssey of John Anderson'', pp. 107–108, The Osgoode Society, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;
John Anderson's motive for escape arose following his sale to another farmer. He realized he would never see his family again in such a situation, and this was unbearable. He hoped to become a legitimate free man and work so he could earn enough money to purchase his family out of bondage. Escape to Canada became his only option after he allegedly killed Missouri farmer Seneca Digges "by accident" when an attempt on his capture was made by Digges. When Anderson got to Canada there were wanted posters everywhere. The Canadian citizenry and the government at the time engaged in heated debate over whether it was acceptable for Anderson to live free in their country. Some people thought that he was dangerous and might end up killing Canadian farmers. Others denied feeling any threat of danger from the man, and argued for him to stay.

==Assistance==

Anti-slavery associations from Britain and pre-Confederation Canada played an instrumental role in assisting Anderson before, during, and after the case. [[Sir John A. Macdonald]], made use of public funds to foot the bill for Anderson’s legal defences.&lt;ref&gt;J. K. Johnson and Carole B. Stelmack, eds (1969) ''Papers of the Prime Ministers: Volume II; The Letters of Sir John A. Macdonald 1858–1861'', p. 357,  Public Archives of Canada, Ottawa.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain attempts to intervene==

A crucial feature in the whole situation occurred while Anderson was awaiting an appeal of the Canadian court’s initial decision, which stipulated that he should indeed be extradited. The British [[Court of Queen’s Bench]] attempted to interfere by sending a [[writ]] of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' for him to appear before a court in London, England, to Britain's Canadian subjects who were already in the process of handling the situation. "Not only was the writ ‘an evil precedent’, but it could lead to further conflict between English and Canadian judicatures."&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Reinders, "The John Anderson Case, 1860–1, A Study in Anglo-Canadian Imperial Relations" (1975), ''The Canadian Historical Review'', Vol. 56:4 p. 407, University of Toronto Press, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt; The English courts never got their chance to handle the case because Anderson’s appeal was expedited to the Court of Common Pleas. He was released due to faulty wording in the [[warrant (law)|warrant]].

==Reactions==

The issue with the English [[writ]], and the negative reaction to it, uncovered the need for written clarification of the relationship between English and Canadian courts. As one result, the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1862]] was passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] in 1862, which denied British courts the right to issue writs of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' for British colonies or dominions with their own courts capable of doing so. It reaffirmed that Canadian jurisdictions had become self-sufficient and did not take kindly to interferences in their judicial system.&lt;ref&gt;Brode (1989), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a significant case to study in Canada’s legal, political, and social heritage.

'''FDA Preemption''' is the legal theory in the [[United States]] that exempts product manufacturers from [[tort]] claims regarding [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved products. FDA Preemption has been a highly contentious issue. In general, consumer groups are against it while the FDA and pharmaceutical manufacturers are in favor of it, arguing that the FDA should set both the floor and the ceiling for drug regulation.  Michigan is the only state that voluntarily applies FDA Preemption to its own state tort law through a regulatory compliance defense, although Michigan's law has been controversial and efforts to repeal it are underway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1425564 When and How to Defer to the FDA: Learning from Michigan's Regulatory Compliance Defense] Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review, Vol. 15, p. 565, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevant cases==
* ''[[Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc.]]'' (2008) The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that manufacturers of FDA-approved devices are protected from liability under state laws.
* ''[[Wyeth v. Levine]]'' (2009)  The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Vermont tort law was not preempted in this case.

A '''FOIL request''' refers to a formal submission requesting information from [[New York state]] on the basis of New York's Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). Such requests are closely analogous to [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA request]]s to the United States government based on its Freedom of Information Act.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="995">'''Farm tin''' or the '''tin dues''' was one of a number of payments required of [[tin]] miners in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]].  The holder of a [[mining sett]] was required to pay a portion of the [[black tin]] extracted to the holder of the [[tin bounds]] in which the sett was granted. The portion was the "farm tin".&lt;ref&gt;Bainbridge (1867) p.62&lt;/ref&gt; The portion was normally interpreted to be one-twelfth of extracted tin: they were also required to play [[toll tin]], calculated at one fifteenth.&lt;ref&gt;Gunning (1833) p.197&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1816">The '''fraud-on-the-market theory''' is the idea that [[stock]] prices are a function of all material information about the company and its business. It applies to [[Security (finance)|securities]] markets, where it can be assumed that all material information is available to [[investor]]s. The theory states that under these conditions, there is a [[Causality|causal]] link between any misstatement and any stock purchaser, because the misstatements defraud the entire market and thus affect the price of the stock. Therefore, a material misstatement's effect on an individual purchaser is no less significant than the effect on the entire market.

According to this theory, "When an investor buys or sells stock at the market price, his or her reliance may be presumed, assuming that he or she pleads that: (1) the information allegedly misrepresented was publicly known, (2) it was material, (3) the stock was traded in an efficient market, and (4) the plaintiff traded in the stock in the relevant period."&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/corpgov/2014/06/24/supreme-court-upholds-fraud-on-the-market-presumption-in-halliburton/&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraud on the market theory applies to [[Civil law (legal system)|civil]] enforcement of [[SEC Rule 10b-5]] which "prohibits any act or omission resulting in [[fraud]] or deceit in connection with the purchase or sale of any security."  The use of this theory was established in [[Basic Inc. v. Levinson|Basic]] and affirmed in [[Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co.|Halliburton]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dandodiary.com/2014/06/articles/securities-litigation/halliburton-u-s-supreme-court-declines-to-overturn-basic-allows-defendants-to-rebut-presumption-of-reliance/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20716">The '''Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act''', abbreviated '''HITECH Act''', was enacted under Title XIII of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] ({{USPL|111|5}}). Under the HITECH Act, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] is spending $25.9 billion to promote and expand the adoption of [[health information technology]].&lt;ref&gt;HHS.gov/Recovery [https://www.hhs.gov/recovery/programs/ Recovery Act-Funded Programs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514174203/http://www.hhs.gov/recovery/programs/# |date=2013-05-14 }} [https://www.hhs.gov/recovery/programs/#Health|Health Information Technology (IT) section] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514174203/http://www.hhs.gov/recovery/programs/#Health{{!}}Health#Health{{!}}Health |date=2013-05-14 }}, also known as [[Health information technology|HIT]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Washington Post]] reported the inclusion of "as much as $36.5 billion in spending to create a [[Nationwide Health Information Network|nationwide network]] of [[electronic health record]]s."&lt;ref name="WAPO200905"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/15/AR2009051503667.html "The Machinery Behind Health-Care Reform"], ''The Washington Post'', May 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; At the time it was enacted, it was considered "the most important piece of health care legislation to be passed in the last 20 to 30 years"&lt;ref name="hungry-contractors"&gt;[http://ww2.gazette.net/stories/07242009/businew181942_32521.shtml Contractors hungry for stimulus], July 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and the "foundation for health care reform."&lt;ref name="hungry-contractors"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2009/03/05/why-and-how-secretary-sebelius-should-avoid-a-network-monopoly/ Why and How Secretary Sebelius Should Avoid a Network Monopoly], ADRIAN GROPPER MD, Mar 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[National Coordinator for Health Information Technology]], Dr. [[Farzad Mostashari]], has explained: "You need information to be able to do [[Population health#Population health management (PHM)|population health management]]. You can serve an individual quite well; you can deliver excellent customer service if you wait for someone to walk through the door and then you go and pull their chart.

== Implementation and effects ==
In the years since the law was passed, [[electronic health records in the United States]] have become more common, but it's unclear how much this was caused by the law.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adler-Milstein|first=Julia|last2=Jha|first2=Ashish K.|date=August 2017|title=HITECH Act Drove Large Gains In Hospital Electronic Health Record Adoption|url=https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2016.1651|journal=Health Affairs|language=en|volume=36|issue=8|pages=1416–1422|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2016.1651|issn=0278-2715}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaningful use incentives in the law only applied to certain types of hospitals, however, and a 2017 study suggests that these hospitals did adopt electronic health records more aggressively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Subtitle A – Promotion of Health Information Technology==

===Part 1 – Improving Health Care Quality, Safety, and Efficiency===

====Electronic health records (EHR)====
The HITECH Act set [[meaningful use]] of interoperable EHR adoption in the health care system as a critical national goal and incentivized EHR adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ehrmeaningfuluse/introduction.html|work=Meaningful Use|publisher=CDC|accessdate=31 October 2011|author=CDC|authorlink=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date=Jun 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=blumenthal2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blumenthal|first1=D.|title=Launching HITECH|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=362|issue=5|pages=382–385|year=2010|pmid=20042745|doi=10.1056/NEJMp0912825}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "goal is not adoption alone but 'meaningful use' of EHRs—that is, their use by providers to achieve significant improvements in care."&lt;ref name=blumenthaltavenner&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blumenthal|first1=D.|last2=Tavenner|first2=M.|title=The "Meaningful Use" Regulation for Electronic Health Records|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=363|issue=6|pages=501–504|year=2010|pmid=20647183|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1006114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Title IV of the act promises maximum incentive payments for [[Medicaid]] to those who adopt and use "certified EHRs" of $63,750 over 6 years beginning in 2011. Eligible professionals must begin receiving payments by 2016 to qualify for the program. For Medicare the maximum payments are $44,000 over 5 years. Doctors who do not adopt an EHR by 2015 will be penalized 1% of Medicare payments, increasing to 3% over 3 years. In order to receive the EHR stimulus money, the HITECH act (ARRA) requires doctors to show "meaningful use" of an EHR system. As of June 2010, there are no penalty provisions for Medicaid.&lt;ref name="dbt.consultantlive.com"&gt;Habib JL. [http://dbt.consultantlive.com/display/article/1145628/1581538 EHRs, meaningful use, and a model EMR]. ''Drug Benefit Trends.'' May 2010;22(4):99-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Health information exchange]] (HIE) has emerged as a core capability for hospitals and physicians to achieve "meaningful use" and receive stimulus funding. Starting in 2015, hospitals and doctors will be subject to financial penalties under Medicare if they are not using electronic health records.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Pear, Robert. "Warnings Over Privacy of U.S. Health Network." ''New York Times'', February 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Meaningful use=====
The main components of meaningful use are:
* The use of a certified EHR in a meaningful manner, such as e-prescribing.
* The use of certified EHR technology for electronic exchange of health information to improve quality of health care.
* The use of certified EHR technology to submit clinical quality and other measures.
In other words, providers need to show they're using certified EHR technology in ways that can be measured significantly in quality and in quantity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CMS EHR Meaningful Use Overview|url=http://www.cms.gov/ehrincentiveprograms/30_Meaningful_Use.asp|work=EHR Incentive Programs|publisher=Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services|accessdate=31 October 2011|author=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services|authorlink=Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services|date=Oct 12, 2011 |dead-url=no |archive-date=30 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030081815/https://www.cms.gov/EHRIncentivePrograms/30_Meaningful_Use.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaningful use of EHRs intended by the US government incentives is categorized as follows:
* Improve care coordination
* Reduce healthcare disparities
* Engage patients and their families
* Improve population and public health
* Ensure adequate privacy and security

The Obama Administration's Health IT program intends to use federal investments to stimulate the market of electronic health records:
* Incentives: to providers who use IT
* Strict and open standards: To ensure users and sellers of EHRs work towards the same goal
* Certification of software: To provide assurance that the EHRs meet basic quality, safety, and efficiency standards

The detailed definition of "meaningful use" was rolled out in 3 stages. Details of each stage were hotly debated by various groups.{{which|date=March 2017}}
Stage 1 was finalized in July 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=July 13, 2010 |location=Washington, DC |title=Secretary Sebelius Announces Final Rules To Support 'Meaningful Use' of Electronic Health Records |publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services |url=https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2010pres/07/20100713a.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715075135/http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2010pres/07/20100713a.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Stage 2 in August 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=August 23, 2012 |title=HHS announces next steps to promote use of electronic health records and health information exchange |publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services |url=https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2012pres/08/20120823b.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916030707/http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2012pres/08/20120823b.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and Stage 3 in October 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Federal Register|80|62761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Meaningful use Stage 1=====
The first steps in achieving meaningful use are to have a certified electronic health record (EHR) and to be able to demonstrate that it is being used to meet the requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meaningful Use Definition &amp; Objectives|url=https://www.healthit.gov/providers-professionals/meaningful-use-definition-objectives|website=HealthIT.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stage 1 contains 25 objectives/measures for Eligible Providers (EPs) and 24 objectives/measures for eligible hospitals. The objectives/measures have been divided into a core set and menu set. EPs and eligible hospitals must meet all objectives/measures in the core set (15 for EPs and 14 for eligible hospitals). EPs must meet 5 of the 10 menu-set items during Stage 1, one of which must be a public health objective.&lt;ref&gt;See subsection (e), {{cite web|title=42 CFR Sec. 495.6.   Meaningful use objectives and measures for EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs.|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2011-title42-vol5/pdf/CFR-2011-title42-vol5-part495.pdf|website=Government Publishing Office|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Full list of the Core Requirements and a full list of the Menu Requirements.

Core Requirements:
# Use computerized order entry for medication orders.
# Implement drug-drug, drug-allergy checks.
# Generate and transmit permissible prescriptions electronically.
# Record demographics.
# Maintain an up-to-date problem list of current and active diagnoses.
# Maintain active medication list.
# Maintain active medication allergy list.
# Record and chart changes in vital signs.
# Record smoking status for patients 13 years old or older.
# Implement one clinical decision support rule.
# Report ambulatory quality measures to CMS or the States.
# Provide patients with an electronic copy of their health information upon request.
# Provide clinical summaries to patients for each office visit.
# Capability to exchange key clinical information electronically among providers and patient authorized entities.
# Protect electronic health information (privacy &amp; security)

Menu Requirements:
# Implement drug-formulary checks.
# Incorporate clinical lab-test results into certified EHR as structured data.
# Generate lists of patients by specific conditions to use for quality improvement, reduction of disparities, research, and outreach.
# Send reminders to patients per patient preference for preventive/ follow-up care
# Provide patients with timely electronic access to their health information (including lab results, problem list, medication lists, allergies)
# Use certified EHR to identify patient-specific education resources and provide to patient if appropriate.
# Perform medication reconciliation as relevant
# Provide summary care record for transitions in care or referrals.
# Capability to submit electronic data to immunization registries and actual submission.
# Capability to provide electronic syndromic surveillance data to public health agencies and actual transmission.

To receive federal incentive money, CMS requires participants in the Medicare EHR Incentive Program to "attest" that during a 90-day reporting period, they used a certified EHR and met Stage 1 criteria for meaningful use objectives and clinical quality measures. For the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program, providers follow a similar process using their state's attestation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physicianspractice.com/meaningful-use/content/article/1462168/2009082 |last=Torrieri |first=Marisa |title=Dealing with Meaningful Use Attestation Aggravation |website=Physicians Practice |date=December 24, 2011 |publisher=UBM Medica LLC |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108093124/http://www.physicianspractice.com/meaningful-use/content/article/1462168/2009082 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the government for the first time charged an EHR vendor with falsely representing to customers and the government that its EHR system met the requirements for meaningful use. eClinicalWorks agreed to pay $155 million to settle government charges and a [[Qui tam|"qui tam" lawsuit]]  brought by a whistleblower who implemented eClinicalWorks' system at Rikers Island Correctional Facility in New York City.&lt;ref name="ecwdoj"&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Health Records Vendor to Pay $155 Million to Settle False Claims Act Allegations|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/electronic-health-records-vendor-pay-155-million-settle-false-claims-act-allegations|website=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also alleged that ECW paid kickbacks for referrals.&lt;ref name="ecwdoj"/&gt; The government also reached separate settlement agreements with three eClinicalWorks employees who will pay a total of $80,000 to the government to settle civil allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arndt|first1=Rachel Z.|title=eClinicalWorks will pay $155 million for misleading users|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170531/NEWS/170539978|accessdate=16 October 2017|publisher=Modern Healthcare|date=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HIT Policy Committee recommends a policy framework for the development and adoption of a nationwide health information technology infrastructure that permits the electronic exchange and use of health information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.1:/ H.R. 1] Subtitle A, Sec. 3002.&lt;/ref&gt;

====HIT Standards Committee====
The HIT Standards Committee recommends to the National Coordinator standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria. The Standards Committee also harmonizes, pilot tests, and ensures consistency with the [[Social Security Act]].

===Part 1 – Improved Privacy Provisions and Security Provisions===
The HITECH Act requires entities covered by the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] to report data breaches, which affect 500 or more persons, to the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (U.S.HHS), to the news media, and to the people affected by the data breaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= HIPAA/HITECH Enforcement Action Alert
|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/hipaahitech-enforcement-action-alert |publisher=Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius LLP|work=The [[National Law Review]]|date=2012-03-22|accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subtitle extends the complete Privacy and Security Provisions of HIPAA to the business associates of covered entities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2009-title42/html/USCODE-2009-title42-chap156-subchapIII-partA-sec17931.htm 42 U.S.C. §17931]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the extension of updated civil and criminal penalties to the pertinent business associates. These changes are also required to be included in any business-associate agreements among the covered entities. On November 30, 2009, the regulations associated with the enhancements to HIPAA enforcement took effect.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2009pres/10/20091030a.html HHS Strengthens HIPAA Enforcement]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant change brought about in Subtitle D of the HITECH Act is the new breach notification requirements. This imposes new notification requirements on covered entities, business associates, vendors of personal health records (PHR) and related entities if a breach of unsecured protected health information (PHI) occurs. On April 27, 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued guidance on how to secure protected health information appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/privacy/privacy-and-security-guide.pdf Guide to Privacy and Security of Electronic Health Information]&lt;/ref&gt; Both HHS and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) were required under the HITECH Act to issue regulations associated with the new breach notification requirements. The HHS rule was published in the Federal Register on August 24, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/pdf/E9-20169.pdf Health and Human Services Breach Notification Rule]&lt;/ref&gt; and the FTC rule was published on August 25, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/pdf/E9-20142.pdf Federal Trade Commission Breach Notification Rule]&lt;/ref&gt;

The final significant change made in Subtitle D of the HITECH Act implements new rules for the accounting of disclosures of a patient's health information. It extends the current accounting for disclosure requirements to information that is used to carry out treatment, payment and health care operations when an organization is using an [[electronic health record]] (EHR). This new requirement also limits the timeframe for the accounting to three years instead of six as it currently stands. These changes took effect January 1, 2011, for organizations implementing EHRs between January 1, 2009 and January 1, 2011, and January 1, 2013, for organizations who had implemented an EHR prior to January 1, 2009.

On July 14, 2010, HHS issued a rule that listed categories that included 701,325 entities and 1.5 million business associates who would have access to patient information without patient consent after the patient had given general consent to their medical practitioner's [[HIPAA]] release.&lt;ref name="privacy1"&gt;Federal Register Document [https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2010/07/14/2010-16718/modifications-to-the-hipaa-privacy-security-and-enforcement-rules-under-the-health-information 2010-16718] tables under paragraphs 75 FR 40911 [http://www.federalregister.gov/a/2010-16718/p-334 334], [http://www.federalregister.gov/a/2010-16718/p-376 376].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="privacy2"&gt;Health Freedom Watch Newsletter [http://www.forhealthfreedom.org/Newsletter/September2010.html September 2010], [http://www.forhealthfreedom.org/Newsletter/September2010.html#Article3 Proposed Changes to Privacy Rule Won't Ensure Privacy]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1246">An '''immutable characteristic''' is any sort of physical attribute which is perceived as being unchangeable, entrenched and innate. The term is often used to describe segments of the population which share such attributes and are contrasted from others by those attributes, and is used in [[human rights law]] to classify [[protected class|protected group]]s of people who should be protected from civil or criminal actions which are directed against those immutable characteristics.

For example, a legal debate about [[sexual orientation]] concerns whether it is a mutable or immutable characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0AMN4_xZJDsC|title = The Mismeasure of Desire: The Science, Theory, and Ethics of Sexual Orientation|last = Stein|first = Edward|date = 2001-04-12|publisher = OUP USA|isbn = 9780195142440|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If it is immutable, then homosexuality, bisexuality, asexuality, heterosexuality, etc., are all immutable characteristics that naturally occur and cannot be changed.  If it is mutable, then those characteristics ''can'' be changed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17376">Russia incurred much international criticism for its conduct during the [[Second Chechen War]], which started in 1999. The governments of the United States and other countries condemned deaths and expulsions among civilians. The [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] (UNHCR) passed two resolutions in 2000 and 2001 condemning human rights violations in Chechnya and requiring Russia to set up an independent national commission of inquiry to investigate the matter. However, a third resolution on these lines failed in 2004. The [[Council of Europe]] in multiple resolutions and statements between 2003 and 2007 called on Russia (a member of the Council) to cease human rights violations. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) between 2005 and 2007 conducted legal cases brought by Chechens against the Russian government, and in many of these cases held Russia responsible for deaths, disappearances and torture.

==Governments==

===Western countries===

There had been strong international condemnation of [[Russia]]'s threat to [[civilian]]s to get out of the Chechen [[Capital (political)|capital]], [[Grozny]], or be considered an enemy target and destroyed. The [[United States]] and the [[European Union]] denounced the move. There had been speculation about possible [[economic sanctions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/554019.stm Putin rebuffs Chechnya warnings ], BBC News, 7 December 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

[[US President]] [[Bill Clinton]] said Russia would "pay a heavy price" for its current tactics, facing [[international isolation]]. The EU also urged Russia to end what they called disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force in Chechnya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/553304.stm 'Russia will pay for Chechnya'], BBC News, 7 December 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]] [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] [[Robin Cook]] has "wholeheartedly condemned" the Russian [[ultimatum]] to the people of Grozny to flee or die. "We condemn vigorously what [[Slobodan Milošević|Milosevic]] did in [[Kosovo]] and we condemn vigorously what Russia is doing in Chechnya," he said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/554075.stm UK condemns Chechnya ultimatum], BBC News, 7 December 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 18, 1999, then presidential candidate [[George W. Bush]] strongly criticised Russia over its [[military campaign]] in Chechnya, saying [[foreign aid]] to Russia should be suspended if Russian policy did not change. "I think Russia has stepped over the bounds," Bush said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bush condemns US isolationism|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/527105.stm|accessdate=12 September 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=18 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States statement in response to Human Rights Commission Resolution on Chechnya in 2000 noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As Secretary [[Madeleine Albright|Albright]] noted in her March 24th speech to the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|Commission]], "We cannot ignore the fact that thousands of Chechen civilians have died and more than 200,000 have been driven from their homes." Together with other delegations, we have expressed our alarm at the persistent, credible reports of [[human rights violations]] by Russian forces in Chechnya, including [[summary execution|extrajudicial killings]]. There are also reports that Chechen [[separatists]] have committed abuses, including the killing of civilians and prisoners. ... The war in Chechnya has greatly damaged Russia's international standing and is isolating Russia from the [[international community]]. Russia's work to repair that damage, both at home and abroad, or its choice to risk further isolating itself, is the most immediate and momentous challenge that Russia faces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usembassy-israel.org.il/publish/press/state/archive/2000/april/sd50427.htm U.S. Response to Human Rights Commission Resolution on Chechnya (Statement issued by Harold Hongju Koh and Nancy Rubin in Geneva)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906153240/http://www.usembassy-israel.org.il/publish/press/state/archive/2000/april/sd50427.htm |date=2013-09-06 }}, U.S. Department of State, April 26, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other countries===
On December 9, 1999, at a meeting with [[Li Peng]], [[People's Republic of China]]'s legislative chairman and the [[communist]] government's most [[hard-line]] leader, [[Boris Yeltsin]] told reporters he wanted to send a message to Clinton, who had criticized Russia for causing civilian casualties in Chechnya. "It seems Mr. Clinton has forgotten Russia is a great power that possesses a [[nuclear arsenal]]. We aren't afraid at all of Clinton's anti-Russian position. I want to tell President Clinton that he alone cannot dictate how the world should live, work and play. It is us who will dictate," Yeltsin said. Yeltsin and [[President of the People's Republic of China]] [[Jiang Zemin]] discussed both criticized U.S. global dominance. "Jiang Zemin completely understands and fully supports Russia's actions in combatting [[terrorism]] and [[extremism]] in Chechnya," Russian [[Foreign Minister]] [[Igor Ivanov]] said afterwards. Chinese Foreign Ministry said that China "understands and supports the efforts made by Russia in safeguarding national unity and [[territorial integrity]]."'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seacoastonline.com/1999news/12_9_w1.htm Yeltsin wins Chinese support on Chechnya] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050501103447/http://www.seacoastonline.com/1999news/12_9_w1.htm |date=2005-05-01 }}, Associated Press, December 9, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 September 2002, after [[Saddam Hussein]]'s meeting with the Chechen pro-Moscow President [[Akhmad Kadyrov]], [[Iraq]]'s Foreign Minister [[Naji Sabri]] stated the country's position with regard to Chechnya, namely that Chechnya is an integral part of Russia. "Iraq is firmly against any manifestations of separatism in Russia."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iraq/2001/32-051001.html PRO-MOSCOW CHECHEN ADMINISTRATION HEAD IN IRAQ], Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 5 October 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Council of Europe]] Resolutions and Recommendations on 'The [[human rights]] situation in the [[Chechen Republic]]':

*[http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-DocDetails-EN.asp?FileID=17266&amp;lang=EN Recommendation 1679 (2004)]

In June 2005, the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE)]] examined Russia's progress in honoring the obligations and commitments it undertook on joining the Council of Europe in 1996. PACE passed a resolution which stated that there had been very little progress in relation to the obligation to bring to justice those responsible for human rights violations. The resolution called on the Russian authorities to "take effective action to put an immediate end to the ongoing [[forced disappearance|'disappearances']], [[torture]], arbitrary [[detention (imprisonment)|detention]] in illegal and secret facilities, and unlawful killings" reported in Chechnya.

The June 9, 2006 PACE report by [[Dick Marty]] said "It is hardly possible to speak of secret detention centers in Council of Europe member states without mentioning Chechnya. Mr Bindig's very recent report also notes not only numerous cases of forced disappearance and torture, but also the existence of secret places of detention."&lt;ref&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?Link=/CommitteeDocs/2006/20060606_Ejdoc162006PartII-FINAL.htm Alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers involving Council of Europe member states] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060610064258/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?Link=%2FCommitteeDocs%2F2006%2F20060606_Ejdoc162006PartII-FINAL.htm |date=2006-06-10 }}, Council of Europe, 07.06.2006&lt;/ref&gt; It quoted "Damning recent accounts by witnesses."

On March 13, 2007 the new Council of Europe report said ''"resort to torture and other forms of ill-treatment by members of law enforcement agencies and security forces continues, as does the related practice of unlawful detentions."'' The Council said it felt forced to make public its findings in light of the Russian authorities' "failure to improve the situation" despite detailed recommendations following the torture committee's visits to Chechnya the previous year.

===European Court of Human Rights===
In October 2004, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) agreed to try cases brought by Chechen civilians against the [[Russian government]]. As of November 2007, 35 cases were decided.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srji.org/en/legal/cases]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[trial]] concluded in February 2005. The Court ruled that the Russian government violated several articles of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], including a [[clause]] on the protection of [[property]], a guarantee of the right to life, and a ban on [[torture]] and inhumane or degrading treatment, and ordered the Russian government to pay [[Damages|compensation]] to the six [[plaintiff]]s of the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4295249.stm Russia 'committed Chechnya abuse'], BBC News, 24 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The cases concerned the Russian federal forces' indiscriminate [[strategic bombing|aerial bombing]] of a civilian convoy of refugees fleeing [[Grozny]] in October 1999; the "disappearance" and subsequent extrajudicial execution of five individuals in [[Grozny]] in January 2000; and the indiscriminate aerial and [[artillery]] [[bombardment]] of the village of [[Katyr-Yurt]] in February 2000. The compensations were not paid, [[NGO]]s claim that applicants to the court are met with repressions, including murders and disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/03/10/russia10298.htm Russian Federation/Chechnya: Human Rights Concerns for the 61st Session of the U.N.

In summer 2006 the European Court on Human Rights decided the first cases concerning [[forced disappearance]]s in Chechnya; it was excepted the decisions by the European Court might play an important role in changing Chechnya's terrible human rights situation, as more than 100 disappearance cases related to Chechnya are pending in the court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2006/07/28/002.html European Court Sides With Chechen Mother], ''The Moscow Times'', July 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The cases included one where the court ordered Russia to pay 35,000 [[euros]] to the mother of [[Khadzhi-Murat Yandiyev]] for violating her son's "right to life" as well as failing "to conduct an effective investigation" into his February 2000 disappearance. Key evidence in the case, according to court documents, was [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZW1uwMma5w video footage] filmed by a reporter for [[NTV Russia|NTV]] and [[CNN]] television showing Colonel-General [[Alexander Ivanovich Baranov|Alexander Baranov]], ordering soldiers to "finish off" and "shoot" Yandiyev; Baranov has since been promoted and awarded a [[Hero of Russia]] medal and made responsible for all [[Defense Ministry]] forces in the North Caucasus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5219254.stm Russia censured over Chechen man], BBC News, 27 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 12, 2006, the Court held [[Russian Federation|Russian state]] responsible for the summary execution of the Estamirov family during the February 5, 2000 [[Novye Aldi massacre]] by the [[OMON]] forces. "Russian and Chechen security forces should take this decision as a warning that the abuse and murder of innocent civilians cannot be met by impunity," said Europe and Central Asia director at [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2006/10/13/russia14384.htm Russia Condemned for Chechnya Killings], Human Rights Watch, October 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; At least 11 other incidents of summary executions committed on the same day in the same region of Chechnya are pending before the Court.

On November 9, 2006, the Court ruled the Russian government complicit in the murder and abduction of three Chechen civilians, including a case on the disappearance and presumed death of two Chechens from the same family. The court sided with Marzet Imakayeva, a Chechen woman who fled Russia two years ago to seek [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in the United States; it also said the way Imakayeva's complaints were dealt with by Russian authorities constituted "inhuman treatment." The bodies of Imakayeva family members have never been found; in the other ruled case the abductee, [[Nura Luluyeva]], turned up in a [[mass grave]] eight months later.

On January 8, 2007, the Court has condemned Russia in the first torture case from Chechnya to be heard by the ECHR. In its [[Judgment (law)|judgment]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=812996&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 CASE OF CHITAYEV AND CHITAYEV v. RUSSIA], European Court of Human Rights, 18 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the Court held that the applicants Adam and Arbi Chitayev had been held in unacknowledged detention, that they had been subjected to torture, and that the Russian authorities have not properly investigated their allegations.

==United Nations==

===UNHCR===
A resolution adopted in April 2000&lt;ref&gt;UN Human Rights Commission [http://www.refworld.org/docid/3b00f2ba44.html Resolution 2000/58]&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR)]] called for Russia, among other things, to establish a "national broad-based and independent commission of inquiry" into abuse, with a view to bringing perpetrators to justice and preventing [[impunity]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/press/2000/04/chech0425a.htm U.N. Chechnya Vote Welcomed], Human Rights Watch, April 25, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time in the UNHCR history it had criticized a permanent [[United Nations Security Council]] member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=15106 UN Holds Hearing on Abuses in Chechnya], Reuters, April 6, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; However, Russia has not fulfilled the resolution's requirements.

On April 20, 2001, the UNHCR adopted another resolution&lt;ref&gt;UN Human Rights Commission [http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/bb42f0bbfeaa0419c1256a3b0022bb85?Opendocument Resolution 2001/24]&lt;/ref&gt; condemning human rights violations in Chechnya perpetrated by federal forces, citing "forced disappearances, extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions, torture, and other inhuman and degrading treatment." The resolution called on Russia to "ensure that both civilian and military prosecutor's offices undertake systematic, credible and exhaustive criminal investigations and prosecutions" of all violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. It reiterated its requirement, also made in 2000 resolution, for Russia to establish a national commission of inquiry to investigate crimes in Chechnya; despite Russia's failure to create such a commission or ensure effective prosecutions after the 2000 resolution, the commission declined to call for the creation of an international commission of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/chechnya2/Mgrave-04.htm THE INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE], Human Rights Watch, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2004 the Commission rejected another resolution on Chechnya. 23 of 53 countries voted against the resolution, while 12 countries voted for the resolution&amp;mdash;mainly European Union countries. Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Lavrov]] said "all attempts to depict the situation in Chechnya as a human rights problem have been unrealistic."&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.pravda.ru/news/russia/17-04-2004/56648-0/  Sergey Lavrov satisfied with UN decision on Chechnya], ''Pravda'', 17.04.2004&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 22, 2006, [[UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]], [[Louise Arbour]], said she was deeply shocked by accounts of torture and [[kidnapping]]s in Chechnya. She recommended the creation of an independent body to investigate [[war crimes|crimes committed during the war]].

On March 30, 2006, [[Manfred Nowak]], the United Nations investigator on torture said that Moscow had agreed to let him visit Russia, including the troubled region&amp;mdash;the first such trip by a UN torture envoy in more than a decade.

'''John of Utynam''' is the recipient of the first known English [[patent]], granted in 1449 by [[King Henry VI]]. John was a master glass-maker from [[Flanders]] who came to England to make the windows for [[Eton College]]. The patent granted him a 20-year monopoly on the making of [[stained glass]].

The [[Republic of Venice]] had begun issuing patents to glass-makers in the early 1420s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6076">The '''Law on euthanasia and assisted suicide'''  ({{lang-fr|Loi sur l’euthanasie et l’assistance au suicide}}) is a law that came into force in 2009 in Luxembourg, legalising euthanasia.

== Contents ==
The most important part of the law is the guarantee that doctors performing active euthanasia or assisting to commit suicide will not be liable to prosecution. The condition for this is that the patient should be terminally ill and in insufferable pain, and should voluntarily, deliberately and repeatedly confirm in writing their desire to end their own life. 16- to 18-year-olds may also request euthanasia if their parents or legal guardians consent. With patients who are not in a position to consent, a living will may suffice. Doctors must have several detailed conversations with the patient about their decision. They must also seek the opinion of a second doctor. All cases of euthanasia must be reviewed by a monitoring commission, which will contact a prosecutor if they find violations of the law.

The law used the Belgian Law on Euthanasia of 28 May 2002 as a model, and came into force on 17 March 2009 after its publication in the Grand Duchy's gazette, the ''Mémorial''. Luxembourg was the third European Union member state and the third state worldwide to legalise euthanasia.

== Legislative history ==
The bill was introduced in the Chamber of Deputies by LSAP and Green members, and the Chamber approved the law at first reading on 19 February 2008 with 30 votes for, 26 against, and 3 abstentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.welt.de/politik/article1700073/Luxemburg-erlaubt-Aerzten-aktive-Sterbehilfe.html|title = Luxemburg erlaubt Ärzten aktive Sterbehilfe|last = |first = |date = 20 February 2008|work = Die Welt|access-date = |via = |language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before a law can come into force, its constitutionality must be reviewed by the Council of State. When this happened, the Council of State raised concerns due to legal uncertainties. It took the parliament until late 2008 to clear up these doubts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aerzteblatt.de/nachrichten/33983|title = Luxemburg entscheidet wohl erst im Frühjahr über Sterbehilfe|date = 9 October 2008|accessdate = 13 December 2015|website = aerzteblatt.de|publisher = |last = |first = |language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the law was approved again with 31 votes for, 26 against, and 3 abstentions on 18 December.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://webarchiv.bundestag.de/archive/2010/0824/dasparlament/2008/52/EuropaWelt/23110051.html#|title = Künftig ohne Vetorecht: Parlament entmachtet Großherzog Henri|last = Stölb|first = Marcus|date = 22 December 2008|journal = Aus Politik und Zeitgeschichte|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = 52|language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Grand-Duke Henri had announced his intention not to assent to the law for reasons of conscience. After Henri's refusal, the prime minister [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] agreed with all parties in the Chamber to enact a constitutional amendment which would strip the Grand-Duke of some of his power and would only leave him the right to promulgate laws the word "approves" in Article 34 of the Constitution would be deleted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchiv.bundestag.de/archive/2010/0824/dasparlament/2008/50-51/EuropaWelt/22979141.html Marcus Stölb: ''Ein Großherzog wird entmachtet.''] Das Parlament Nr. 50/51 vom 8. Dezember 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The Chamber approved this amendment at first reading with 56 votes for and one abstention on 11 December 2008.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A petition against the amendment failed on 11 February 2009 with only 796 rather than the necessary 25,000 signatures,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerzteblatt.de/nachrichten/35523/Initiative_gegen_Verfassungsaenderung_in_Luxemburg_gescheitert.htm ''Initiative gegen Verfassungsänderung in Luxemburg gescheitert.''] aerzteblatt.de vom 20. Februar 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and on 12 March all the 52 Deputies who were present approved the law at second reading.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wort.lu/wort/web/letzebuerg/artikel/10139/verfassungsaenderung-in-zweiter-lesung-verabschiedet.php ''Verfassungsänderung in zweiter Lesung verabschiedet.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123010150/http://wort.lu/wort/web/letzebuerg/artikel/10139/verfassungsaenderung-in-zweiter-lesung-verabschiedet.php |date=2011-11-23 }} Luxemburger Wort vom 13. März 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand-Duke, who had to assent to a law for the last time, did so. Thus, the euthanasia law was promulgated with the signatures of the Grand-Duke and Health Minister [[Mars Di Bartolomeo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aerzteblatt.de/nachrichten/35837/Luxemburg_setzt_Sterbehilfe-Gesetz_in_Kraft.htm|title = Luxemburg setzt Sterbehilfe-Gesetz in Kraft|date = 17 March 2009|accessdate = |website = aerzteblatt.de|publisher = |last = |first = |language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''low-profit limited liability company''' ('''L3C''') is a legal form of [[business entity]] in the [[United States]] that was created to bridge the gap between [[non-profit]] and for-profit investing by providing a structure that facilitates investments in socially beneficial, for-profit ventures by simplifying compliance with [[Internal Revenue Service]] rules for program-related investments, a type of investment that private foundations are allowed to make.&lt;ref name="The Triple Pundit: L3C: A More Creative Capitalism"&gt;{{cite news|last=Witkin|first=Jim|title=The L3C: A More Creative Capitalism|url=http://www.triplepundit.com/2009/01/the-l3c-a-more-creative-capitalism/|accessdate=25 July 2011|newspaper=[[The Triple Pundit]]|date=15 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;{{cite news |title= IRS Rule Could Help the Fledgling L3C Corporate Form |first=Anne |last= Field |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/annefield/2012/05/04/irs-rules-could-help-the-fledgling-l3c/ |newspaper=[[Forbes]] |date=4 May 2012 |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sunday Sitdown with Marc J.

==Concept==
An L3C is a for-profit, [[social enterprise]] venture that has a stated goal of performing a socially beneficial purpose, not maximizing income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Capriccioso |first= Caryn |last2= Zwetsch |first2= Rick |last3= Shaver |first3=Erin |date=May 2010 |title= Who is the L3C Entrepreneur?|publisher= InterSector Partners, L3C |format=white paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN Money - profit isn't the point"&gt;{{cite news|last=Zouhali-Worrall|first=Malika|title=For L3C companies, profit isn't the point|url=http://money.cnn.com/2010/02/08/smallbusiness/l3c_low_profit_companies/|accessdate=25 July 2011|newspaper=[[CNN Money]]|date=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/law_firm_pro_bono_alternatives|title=For more good: Law firms find other ways to provide service to society|newspaper=ABA Journal|access-date=2017-02-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a hybrid structure that combines the legal and tax flexibility of a traditional LLC, the social benefits of a nonprofit organization, and the branding and market positioning advantages of a social enterprise.&lt;ref name="ABA"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lane |first=Marc |date=December 2011 |title= Social Enterprises: A New Business Form Driving Social Change |journal=American Bar Association |volume=16 |series=The Young Lawyer |issue=3  |accessdate=September 18, 2012 |url=http://www.americanbar.org/publications/young_lawyer/2011-12/december_2011/social_enterprises_new_business_form_driving_social_change.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chronicleillinois.com/news/cook-county-news/new-business-model-may-make-illinois-delaware-social-enterprise/|title=New business model may make Illinois ‘Delaware of social enterprise’ - Chronicle Media|date=2017-02-12|newspaper=Chronicle Media|access-date=2017-02-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The L3C is obligated to be mission-driven so there is a clear order of priorities for its fiduciaries.&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt;

The L3C is designed to make it easier for socially oriented businesses to attract investments from foundations and additional money from private investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Dozens of Companies Are Sprouting With the Same Goal: Doing Good|first=Grant |last=Williams |url=http://philanthropy.com/article/Dozens-of-Companies-Are/57786/|newspaper= Philanthropy Today |publisher= The Chronicle of Philanthropy | date=12 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seechangemagazine.com/?p=3521|title=A Model for Change: Chicagoan County engages social enterprise to combat poverty - SEE Change Magazine|date=2016-10-11|newspaper=SEE Change Magazine|access-date=2017-02-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the traditional LLC, the L3C's articles of organization are required by law to mirror the federal tax standards for program-related investing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Stankorb, Sarah| url=http://www.good.is/post/where-did-social-enterprise-come-from-anyway/ |title=Where Did Social Enterprise Come From, Anyway? | publisher= GOOD Worldwide  |date=8 March 2012 |accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A program-related investment (PRI) is one way in which foundations can satisfy their obligation under the Tax Reform Act of 1969 to distribute at least 5% of their assets every year for charitable purposes.&lt;ref name="ABA" /&gt; While foundations usually meet this requirement through grants, investments in L3Cs and charities that qualify as PRIs can also fulfill the requirement while allowing the foundations to receive a return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://technori.com/2012/10/2591-feel-good-do-good/ |title= How Social Entrepreneurship is Changing Chicago (and the World) |last=Segal |first=Jeff |date=12 October 2012 |work= Technori |accessdate=31 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
An L3C is established pursuant to the law of the state in which the entity is formed. To authorize the organization of an L3C, legislation must be passed that amends the state's general limited liability company law.  Thus far, legislation has been passed in Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina (authorizing legislation repealed in 2013), North Dakota, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, and Wyoming and the federal jurisdictions of the Crow Indian Nation of Montana and the Oglala Sioux Tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Federal and State Taxation of Limited Liability Companies, ¶2602.01 ([[CCH (company)|CCH / Wolters Kluwer]] 2014 Ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ACD Legislation"&gt;{{cite web|title=L3C Legislation|url=http://americansforcommunitydevelopment.org/laws|publisher=Americans for Community Development|accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L3C Legislation was approved in Puerto Rico on December 22, 2015 by Act 233-2015&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 11, 2013, the Secretaries of State of the ten states and two Indian Nations that authorize them reported that 711 active L3Cs are in operation.&lt;ref name="Lane, Marc"&gt;{{Cite report|author=Lane, Marc |author2=Bodor, Brandon |author3=Agha, Mavara |date=January 2013 |title=Preliminary Report |url=http://socialenterprise-chicago.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Task-Force-Report_1.16.13-to-General-Assembly.pdf |publisher=Governor's Task Force on Social Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Enterprise |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102140113/http://socialenterprise-chicago.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Task-Force-Report_1.16.13-to-General-Assembly.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; HB 1299 was introduced on January 14, 2013 in North Dakota, which would authorize the organization of L3Cs.  Legislation has been written for 26 additional states but has not yet been introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Considering Legislation in Your State? |url= http://www.americansforcommunitydevelopment.org/considering |publisher=Americans for Community Development |accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, 2012, the IRS released proposed regulations that broaden the landscape of what constitutes an acceptable PRI by adding nine new examples of investments that would qualify, along with some general principles.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of Program-Related Investments, 77 Fed. Reg. 23429, 23430 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; An amendment to the Illinois L3C law that would allow for a more expansive description of the purposes for which L3Cs can be created, consistent with the proposed examples of PRIs set forth by the IRS in 2012, unanimously passed the Illinois Senate on April 17, 2013, and has been referred to the Illinois House Rules Committee.&lt;ref&gt;S.B. 2359, 98th Gen. Assem. (Ill. 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report | date=April 2013 |title= Six Month Report|url= http://illinoistaskforce.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/task-force-six-month-report_4-22-13.pdf |publisher=Governor's Task Force on Social Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Enterprise }}&lt;/ref&gt; The expanded clause would make Illinois the first state to authorize L3Cs whose purposes may reflect the whole range of statutorily sanctioned PRIs to include religious, scientific, and literary organizations.&lt;ref name="Lane, Marc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author=Lane, Marc | date=16 September 2013 |title=SEA-Chicago and the Illinois Task Force on Social Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Enterprise: A Strategic Partnership  |url= https://se-alliance.org/sea-news/sea-chicago-and-the-illinois-task-force-on-social-innovation-entrepreneurship-and-enterprise-a-strategic-partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Emerging Legal Forms Allow Social Entrepreneurs to Blend Mission And Profits|url= http://www.triplepundit.com/2014/03/emerging-legal-forms-allow-social-entrepreneurs-blend-mission-profits/ |author=Marc J. Lane |date= March 11, 2014|publisher=Triple Pundit }}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation is also pending at federal level that will simplify the process for receiving IRS approval that an investment qualifies as a PRI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americansforcommunitydevelopment.org/proposedfedlegislation |title= Council on Foundations, Americans for Community Development Applaud Reps.

As of January 1, 2014, North Carolina no longer authorizes L3Cs; however, current L3Cs can continue to use the designation.&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2075">'''Merchet''' Also: -ett, -ete, -eit, -eat, -iett, -i(e)te, -iatte, mershet(e, '''marchet''', -eit, market&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merchet|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/dost/merchet|website=Dictionary of the Scots Language, ''Dictionar o the Scots Leid''|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a fine paid on a [[marriage]] during the [[Middle Ages]] in [[England]]. The word derives from the plural form of daughter, ''merched'', in old [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. Merchet was payment to a peasant's lord, whether by the persons marrying, or by a father for his son or daughter, or by a brother for his sister.&lt;ref name="rolls"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rolls Series, Volume 31, Issue 2, Part 6; Volume 31, Issue 11|date=1891|publisher=[[Longman &amp; Company]]|location=Great Britain. [[Public Record Office]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VL9KAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theories regarding the practice include recompense for the loss of a worker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=merchet|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/merchet|website=Your Dictionary|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but one idea most prominent when the word ''merchet'' was used, is that of ransom--and not necessarily the ransom of a female. Merchet is the ransom of flesh and blood, more often, perhaps, of the peasant's daughter or sister than of his son. All the curious theories which have grown up around the term, on the assumption that it had relation only to girls, are unfounded mainly because of the incorrect term assigned to the practice. The etymology of the term must be sought not in the root of any word having reference to maids or daughters in particular, but in the root of an unknown word having reference to blood, to purchase, to redemption or enfranchisement, or the price paid for it, or to a particular kind of tax, fine, impost, or exaction.&lt;ref name="rolls"/&gt;

The '''National Service Act (1964)''', was an Australian federal law, passed on 24 November 1964, which required 20-year-old males to serve in the Army for a period of twenty-four months of continuous service (reduced to eighteen months in 1971) followed by three years in the Reserve. The Defence Act was amended in May 1965 to provide that conscripts could be obliged to serve overseas, and in March 1966 Prime Minister [[Harold Holt]] announced that National Servicemen would be sent to Vietnam to fight in units of the Australian Regular Army. 

On 5 November 1964 Cabinet decided to introduce a compulsory selective National Service scheme. In announcing this decision to Parliament, Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] referred to 'aggressive Communism', developments in Asia such as 'recent Indonesian policies and actions' and a 'deterioration in our strategic position' as being influential in the decision being reached (see Parliamentary Debates, House of Representatives, 25th Parliament, 1st Session, pp. 2517–2724). The Government had concluded that Australia had inadequate defence manpower and aimed to increase the strength of the Army to 33,000 by the end of 1966 by introducing national service.

Between 1965 and December 1972 over 800,000 men registered for National Service. Some 63,000 were conscripted and over 19,000 served in Vietnam. Although registration was compulsory, a process of selection by ballot determined who would be called up. Two ballots were conducted each year. The ballots selected several dates in the selected period and all males with corresponding birthdays were called up for national service. The ballot was conducted using a lottery barrel and marbles representing birthdays.

Conscription ended as one of the first acts of the newly elected [[Whitlam]] Labor Government in December 1972.

The '''National Transitional Legislative Assembly''' (NTLA) was  [[Liberia]]'s legislative body during the country's transition from civil war to democratic rule (October 2003&amp;ndash;January 2006).

==Background==
The NTLA was created as part of an August 2003 peace agreement that ended a [[Second Liberian Civil War|civil war]] between government forces of [[President of Liberia|President]] [[Charles G. Taylor|Charles Taylor]] and two rebel groups - [[Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy]] (LURD) and the [[Movement for Democracy in Liberia]] (MODEL). It also called for the creation of a broad-based [[transitional government]] that would rule for two years, ending with the holding of [[Elections in Liberia|elections]] in October 2005 and the installation of a democratically elected government by January 2006.

==Composition==
The NTLA replaced the [[bicameral]] [[Legislature of Liberia|Legislature]], which was [[Liberian elections, 1997|elected]] in 1997. It consisted of 76 appointed members representing the Taylor government, [[Rebellion|rebel]] groups, [[List of political parties in Liberia|political parties]], and [[civil society]]. The distribution of seats among these groups is as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|Government of Liberia
|align="center"|12 Seats

|Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD)

|Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL)

|Political Party Representatives
|align="center"|18 Seats
|-
|County Representatives
|align="center"|15 Seats
|-
|Civil Society and Special Interest Groups

|-
|}

'''Note:''' Civil Society and Special Interest Groups included the National Bar Association, Liberian business organizations, Women's organizations, [[Trade union]]s, Teachers unions, Liberians in the [[Diaspora]], and Youth organizations.

==Responsibilities==
According to the 2003 peace agreement, the responsibilities of the National Transitional Legislative Assembly were to:
#Function as a legislative body.
#Approve the policies and programs of the National Transitional Government of Liberia (NTGL) for implementation by the cabinet.
#Encourage and support the emergence of a new democratic space, particularly in the areas of [[human rights]] and [[freedom of expression]].

==Leadership==
The NTLA was led by a [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] and Deputy Speaker elected by Assembly members.

[[George Dweh]], a founding member of LURD and [[Eddington Varmah]], a [[Justice Minister]] in the Taylor government were elected unopposed as Speaker and Deputy Speaker in October 2003. Both were suspended indefinitely on 14 March 2005, along with two other members, for spending money without proper authorization. A vote held on 17 March resulted in [[George Koukou]] being elected acting Speaker and [[David Gbala]] chosen as Deputy Speaker. Koukou received 39 votes while his only opponent [[Fayah Gbollie]], a former presidential candidate and representative of the [[Free Democratic Party (Liberia)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP), won 4.

The [[Bill against Pornography and Pornoaction]] came into effect in Indonesia in 2008.&lt;ref name="Karishma Vaswani" /&gt; In June 2010 Ariel was charged with breaking the law by appearing in two sex videos found on the Internet.&lt;ref name="Karishma Vaswani" /&gt; Ariel claims the tapes were stolen from his house and posted online without his consent, but the judge said the pop star did nothing to prevent their widespread distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20030221-504083.html | work=CBS News | title=Nazril Irham Update: Indonesian Pop Singer Sentenced to 3 1/2 Years in Jail for Sex Tapes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TV presenter [[Luna Maya]] and [[soap opera]] star [[Cut Tari]] denied being the women in the videos.&lt;ref name="Karishma Vaswani" /&gt; On July 9, 2011, Cut Tari finally admitted to being in one of three sex videos. Her lawyer Hotman Paris Hutapea said her client had confessed to featuring in the video with band lead singer Nazril 'Ariel' Ilham. The confession made as his client did not want to preempt the police's investigation into the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/07/09/cut-tari-admits-being-sex-video.html |title=Cut Tari admits being in sex video |publisher=[[The Jakarta Post]]|date=July 9, 2010|accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sex video prompted an outpouring of criticism from [[Islam in Indonesia|conservative Muslims]].&lt;ref name="Karishma Vaswani"/&gt;

Ariel was held in custody from his arrest until his trial, in Bandung, West Java, which began in November 2010. On 31 January 2011 a guilty verdict resulted in three years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

'''''People v. Gleghorn''''', [[California Court of Appeal]], 193 Cal. App. 3d 196, 238 Cal. Rptr. 82 (1987), is a legal case illustrative of when a defendant forfeits his [[right to self-defense]], because his own uncharged culpable acts set in motion the conditions in which self-defense would be needed; he caused the condition of his own defense.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;''Criminal Law - Cases and Materials'', 7th ed. 2012, [[Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business]]; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], [[Guyora Binder]], {{ISBN|978-1-4548-0698-1}}, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|526-8}}&lt;ref&gt;Killing in Self-Defence, F Leverick, p123&lt;/ref&gt; This principle put forth by the court as to the underlying murder case was generalized to other kinds of cases.&lt;ref name = CCOOD&gt;Robinson, Paul H., ''Causing the Conditions of One's Own Defense: A Study in the Limits of Theory in Criminal Law Doctrine'' (1985).

The court wrote: 
::''"Not every assault gives rise to the right to kill in self-defense... Generally, if one makes a felonious assault upon another... the original assailant cannot slay his adversary in self-defense unless he has first, in good faith, declined further combat, and has fairly notified him that he has abandoned the affray. However, when the victim of simple [[assault]] responds in a sudden and deadly counterassault, the original aggressor need not attempt to withdraw and may use reasonable force in self-defense."'' 

This principle put forth by the court as to the underlying murder case was generalized to other kinds of cases "where the actor is not only culpable as to causing the defense conditions, but also has a culpable state of mind ''as to causing himself to engage in the conduct constituting the offense'', the state should punish him for causing the ultimate justified or excused conduct."&lt;ref name = CCOOD/&gt;

In its opinion, the court noted the unusual nature of the underlying facts in the case:
::''"May a person who enters the habitat of another at 3 o'clock in the morning for the announced purpose of killing him, and who commences to beat the startled sleeper's bed with a stick and set fires under him, be entitled to use deadly force in self defense after the intended victim shoots him in the back with an arrow? Upon these bizarre facts, we hold that he may not..."''

'''Phillip D. Kline''' (born December 31, 1959) is a former Kansas state legislator (1992-2000), former district attorney of [[Johnson County, Kansas|Johnson County]], and the [[Kansas Attorney General|Attorney General of Kansas]] from January 2003 to January 2007. Kline, a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], lost re-election as attorney general to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] challenger, Johnson County District Attorney [[Paul J. Morrison|Paul Morrison]], on November 7, 2006, 58%-41%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ljworld.com/news/politics/elections/2006/kansas/ag/ "Race for Attorney General"], ''Lawrence Journal-World''; retrieved January 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been appointed by the Republican County Central Committee over Steve Howe to fill the vacancy left by Paul Morrison's election as Kansas Attorney General, Kline became the district attorney of Johnson County on the day he left office as attorney general, essentially switching jobs with Morrison. Kline then ran for a full term as district attorney, but was defeated by Howe in the August 5, 2008, Republican primary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2006/dec/12/kline_chosen_johnson_county_district_attorney 'Kline chosen as Johnson County District Attorney'], [[Lawrence Journal World]], John Hanna, 12 December 2006. Retrieved 21 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 18, 2013, Kline's Kansas [[Admission to practice law|law license]] was indefinitely suspended by the [[Kansas Supreme Court]], which held in a written opinion that there was "clear and convincing evidence" that Kline committed 11 violations of [[Attorney misconduct|conduct rules]] while he was the state's top law enforcement officer from January 2003 to January 2007 and later as Johnson County's District Attorney.&lt;ref name=suspended&gt;{{cite news|work=The Wichita Eagle|url=http://www.kansas.com/2013/10/18/3065275/kansas-supreme-court-indefinitely.html|title=Kansas Supreme Court Indefinitely Suspends Phill Kline's State Law License|first=Rick|last=Plumlee|accessdate=October 18, 2013|date=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in office, Kline served as Chairman of the Republican Attorneys' General Association, Co-Chairman of the National Violent Sexual Predator Apprehension Task Force, President of the Midwest Association of Attorneys General, Prosecutor of the Year for the National Alliance of the Mentally Ill and Executive Committee Member of the National Association of Attorneys General.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kcur.org/post/da-candidates-battle-over-experience-abortion#stream/0 DA Candidates Battle Over Experience, Abortion], ''[[KCUR]]'', Maria Carter, Jul 30, 2008.

Kline was a polarizing figure in state politics, largely surrounding the issue of [[Abortion in the United States|abortion]].&lt;ref name="nyt-kansas"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[New York Times]]|date=November 22, 2011|accessdate=November 22, 2011|first=A.G.|last=Sulzberger|title=Kansas Abortion Prosecution Loses Some Steam, but Fire Is Still Hot|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/23/us/kansas-abortion-prosecution-loses-some-steam-but-fire-is-still-hot.html|quote=The case emerged from a long investigation by one of the state’s most polarizing elected officials, Phill Kline, who had used his position as Kansas attorney general and later as Johnson County district attorney to crusade against abortion providers, earning a series of official rebukes along the way for his tactics, including a recommendation last month by a state board that he be prohibited from practicing law in the state.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He filed charges against Dr. [[George Tiller]], a late-term abortion provider, and led a years-long effort to prosecute [[Planned Parenthood]] in Kansas, which he said had failed to submit reports when young women (15 and younger) came to get abortions.&lt;ref name="nyt-kansas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deception"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=February 21, 2011|accessdate=November 22, 2011|title=Phill Kline says deception OK in abortion investigations|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/news/national/central/view.bg?&amp;articleid=1318449&amp;format=&amp;page=1&amp;listingType=natce#articleFull}} {{dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kline is currently an assistant professor at [[Liberty University]], an evangelical fundamentalist college in Lynchburg, Virginia.

==Early life and political career==
Born in [[Kansas City, Kansas]], Kline grew up in [[Shawnee, Kansas|Shawnee]], a community on the Kansas side of the [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area]]. He was the third of five children; his father abandoned the family when Kline was five years old, leaving his mother to be a [[single parent]].&lt;ref name="family"&gt;Mann, Fred (October 8, 2006). "Family, past shape Kline's efforts as attorney general", ''[[Wichita Eagle]]''; accessed May 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kline graduated from [[Shawnee Mission Northwest High School]] and subsequently attended the [[University of Central Missouri]] in [[Warrensburg, Missouri]], where he became an active member of [[Phi Sigma Epsilon]] fraternity (now [[Phi Sigma Kappa]]). He was a member of the varsity wrestling team with a partial [[wrestling]] scholarship, and a member of the cross country team. He earned a [[bachelor's degree|B.S.]] in business communications in 1982.&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; During college, he worked as a weekend radio DJ in Clinton, Missouri and as a summer news broadcaster for [[Kansas City, Missouri]], [[AM broadcasting|AM radio]] station [[WHB]].{{cn|date=May 2017}} 

On Friday, July 17, 1981 he was broadcasting live from the Hyatt Regency Kansas City in Kansas City, Missouri, when two vertically contiguous [[Hyatt Regency walkway collapse|walkways collapsed]] onto a Tea Dance being held in the hotel's lobby. The falling walkways killed 114 and injured a further 216 people. At the time, it was the deadliest structural collapse in U.S. history. After graduating college, he worked in public relations for the [[Worlds of Fun]] and [[Oceans of Fun]] amusement parks in Kansas City in order to save money for [[law school]].{{cn|date=May 2017}}

Kline received his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from the [[University of Kansas School of Law]] in 1987, and was an Associate Editor for the ''Kansas Law Review''.  He entered private practice as an associate with [[Blackwell Sanders]], a large firm in Kansas City specializing in [[corporate law]]. He married his wife, Deborah, in 1989, and settled in Shawnee close to where he grew up. The Klines have one daughter, Hillary, born in 1992. They are members of the Central [[Church of the Nazarene]] in [[Lenexa, Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncnnews.com/nphweb/media/umedia/HQ1/NCN/enews_archive/old/gnews0247.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714162358/http://www.ncnnews.com/nphweb/media/umedia/HQ1/NCN/enews_archive/old/gnews0247.html |date=July 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving Blackwell Sanders, Kline hosted two radio programs: ''The Phill and Mary Show'' on Kansas City AM station [[KMBZ (AM)|KMBZ]], and ''Face Off With Phill Kline'' on [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]] AM station [[WIBW (AM)|WIBW]].  He also served as the finance director of the Johnson County Republican Committee.{{citation needed||date=August 2015}}

While still a law student, Kline ran for [[U.S. Congress]] in 1986.  Kline won the Republican [[primary election]] but was defeated in the general election by the incumbent, Democrat [[Jim Slattery]]. In 1992, Kline won election to the [[Kansas House of Representatives]], where he represented the 18th District. which included Shawnee. There, he chaired the House Appropriations Committee and was a member of several oversight committees. He was a member of the advisory committee for Kansas [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Bob Dole]]'s [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential campaign]]. Kline remained in the Kansas House until 2000, when he ran for election to the [[United States House of Representatives]], seeking the [[3rd Congressional District of Kansas|Third District]] seat held by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Congressman [[Dennis Moore (politician)|Dennis Moore]]. Although Kline won the Republican primary, he lost the general election to Moore, 184,050 to 145,542 votes, 54.8% to 43.3%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2004election.pdf], ''[[Clerk of the House of Representatives]]'', Jeff Trandahl, June 7, 2005. Retrieved 24 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attorney General of Kansas==
In 2002, Kline won election as attorney general of Kansas, defeating fellow Republican David Adkins of [[Leawood, Kansas|Leawood]] in the primary and Democrat [[Chris Biggs]] of [[Junction City, Kansas|Junction City]] in the general election. On becoming attorney general, Kline and his family moved to [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]].&lt;ref name=Topeka /&gt;

===''Kansas v. Marsh''===
In December 2005 and April 2006, he successfully argued before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Kansas v. Marsh]]'', wherein the Court reversed a ruling made by the [[Kansas Supreme Court]] that the state's [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]] was unconstitutional.

===Abortion controversy===
In 2005, Kline began investigating possible cases of child rape and illegal partial-birth and late-term [[abortion]]s. In doing so, Kline requested the redacted medical records (without names) of 90 women and girls who either gave birth to a child or had an abortion. His office was ultimately granted these redacted records by the Kansas Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/25/national/25kansas.html | work=The New York Times | title=Kansas Prosecutor Demands Files on Late-Term Abortion Patients | first=Jodi | last=Wilgoren | date=February 25, 2005 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = records/&gt;

On December 21, 2006, Kline charged abortion provider Dr. [[George Tiller]] with more than 30 misdemeanors, most involving abortions Tiller allegedly performed on minors. But just hours after the charges were unsealed, a [[Sedgwick County, Kansas|Sedgwick County]] judge threw them out "at the request of Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston, who said her office had not been consulted by Kline."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hegeman|first1=Roxana|title=Kansas Court Dismisses Abortion Charges|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/22/AR2006122201272.html|work=Washington Post|agency=AP|date=December 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on June 28, 2007, a 19-count indictment was unexpectedly filed against Tiller by Kline's successor, [[Paul J. Morrison]]. On March 27, 2009, Dr. Tiller was found [[Acquittal|not guilty]] of all 19 misdemeanor charges stemming from some abortions he performed at his Wichita clinic in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Doctor acquitted in late-term abortion case|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/29918417/|work=NBC News|agency=Associated Press|date=March 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the acquittal, Tiller was charged on December 12, 2008 by the Kansas Board of Healing Arts (KBHA) on 11 counts of illegal late-term abortions. The board had many appointees of anti-abortion Governor Sam Brownback, including a member from [[Operation Rescue West]] (ORW).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ksbha.org/Press_Releases/12-12-08_tillerpetition.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107191754/http://www.ksbha.org/Press_Releases/12-12-08_tillerpetition.pdf|date=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = records/&gt; On May 31, 2009, while serving as an usher at his church's Sunday morning services, Tiller was assassinated by [[Scott Roeder]], an ORW member who had the cell phone number of convicted clinic arsonist [[Cheryl Sullenger]], on a post-it note on his dashboard when he was apprehended fleeing, a few hours after the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kansas.com/946/story/834444.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606062339/http://www.kansas.com/946/story/834444.html |archivedate=2009-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = records/&gt;

In a related matter, Kline was named a defendant in a suit brought in the [[United States District Court for the District of Kansas]] challenging a state law requiring "doctors and other professionals"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Federal judge sides with abortion rights group|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/12376396/ns/us_news-life/t/federal-judge-sides-abortion-rights-group/|work=NBC News|agency=Associated Press|date=April 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; to report "all consensual [[age of consent|underage]] sexual activity as sexual abuse."&lt;ref name="court"&gt;''Aid for Women v. Foulston'', [[Case citation|427 F.Supp.2d 1093]], 1095 (D. Kan. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 18, 2006, Judge J. Thomas Marten agreed and issued a [[permanent injunction]], ruling that such a policy violated the children's rights to informational privacy and could not be justified by Kansas law.&lt;ref name="court"/&gt;

In 2006, Kline and [[Operation Save America|Operation Rescue]] claimed that Robert A. Estrada, an alleged rapist, was captured with the help of abortion clinic medical records subpoenaed as a result of Kline's investigation.&lt;ref name="CJOnline"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hanna|first1=John|title=D.A. says Kline wasn't involved|url=http://www.cjonline.com/stories/100306/leg_kline2.shtml|work=The Topeka Capitol-Journal|date=October 3, 2006|access-date=2006-11-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121070120/http://cjonline.com/stories/100306/leg_kline2.shtml|archive-date=2006-11-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The District Attorney who prosecuted Estrada challenged Operation Rescue's claims, stating that Kline and the records had no involvement in the prosecution.&lt;ref name="CJOnline"/&gt;

Kline was suspended from practicing law due to the fact that he illegally accessed private medical records of women who made the choice to have an abortion. He obtained some records provided on his demand to Dr. Kristin Neuhaus, whose prosecution he pursued after Dr. Tiller's assassination, and illegally disclosed them, including discussing them with disgraced Fox News host [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] on television.&lt;ref name = records&gt;[https://www.counterpunch.org/2014/05/02/supreme-court-upholds-disbarment-of-anti-abortion-kansas-ex-ag-phill-kline/ Supreme Court Upholds Disbarment of Anti-Abortion Kansas Ex-AG Phill Kline], ''[[CounterPunch]]'', Dave Lindorff,  May 2, 2014. Retrieved 25 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kansas Supreme Court stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Ultimately, we unanimously conclude the weight of the aggravating factors—i.e., Kline's inability or refusal to acknowledge the line between overzealous advocacy and operating within the bounds of the law and his professional obligations; his selfish motives; and his lengthy and substantial pattern of misconduct—weigh more heavily than the mitigating factors and merit his indefinite suspension."''&lt;ref&gt;Lach, Eric.

===''State v. Limon''===
During his tenure, in the case of ''[[State v. Limon]]'', Kline defended a Kansas law which provided substantially higher sentencing guidelines for acts of homosexual [[statutory rape]] compared to equivalent heterosexual acts. A Kansas trial court upheld the law, the [[Kansas Court of Appeals]] affirmed that decision, and the Supreme Court of Kansas declined to hear the case. The party challenging the law was barely 18 at the time of the offense, and both Limon and the other boy were residents of a home for the mentally disabled. Kline had repeatedly referred to the older boy as a "predator."&lt;ref name=LJW&gt;[http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2005/nov/19/matthew_limon_returning_court_new_charge/ Matthew Limon returning to court on new charge], ''[[Lawrence Journal World]]'', Carl Manning (AP), November 19, 2005. Retrieved June16, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  His counsel applied to the Supreme Court of the United States for a [[writ of certiorari]].

In June 2003, the Supreme Court issued a [[GVR Order]], remanding the case for reconsideration in light of the Supreme Court's then-recent decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', which held that a similar Texas law violated the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]]. The Attorney General's office continued to pursue the matter, seeking to distinguish the Kansas law from the Texas law. The Kansas Court of Appeals upheld the earlier decision 2-1, but the Kansas Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of Limon and overturned his conviction in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kscourts.org/cases-and-opinions/opinions/supct/2005/20051021/85898.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of his release he had served 5½ years of a seventeen-year sentence. If the participants had been of opposite sexes, the maximum sentence for the older one would have only been 15 months.&lt;ref name=LJW /&gt;

===2006 and 2008 re-election campaigns===
Kline ran for re-election as attorney general in 2006. On November 7, 2006, he lost to Democratic challenger and [[Johnson County, Kansas|Johnson County]] District Attorney [[Paul J. Morrison]]. Kline received 41 percent of the vote.&lt;ref name="slevin"&gt;Slevin, Peter. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/29/AR2006122901220.html "Trounced at Polls, Kansas GOP Is Still Plagued by Infighting"], ''Washington Post'', December 30, 2006, pg. A2.&lt;/ref&gt; To oppose Kline in the general election, Morrison had changed his political affiliation from Republican to Democratic in the fall of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2006/nov/08/morrison_vows_focus_crime/ Morrison vows focus on crime], ''[[Lawrence Journal World]]'', Scott Rothschild, November 8, 2006. Retrieved June 17, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 11, 2006, Johnson County Republican Precinct committeepersons narrowly selected Kline over fellow Republican Steve Howe to serve the remaining two years of Morrison's term as county district attorney.&lt;ref name="slevin"/&gt;  With 60% of the vote, Howe defeated Kline in the August 5, 2008 Republican primary for a full term as district attorney.

====Church memorandum controversy====
In late September 2006, an internal election campaign memo from Kline to his campaign staff was leaked to [[The Interfaith Alliance]] and quickly was picked up by bloggers, resulting in much discussion and controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewsonfirst.org/06c/kline_memo.html Kansas Attorney General writes orders for a reelection campaign operation "in each church"], JewsOnFirst.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Wilson (American journalist)|Wilson, Bruce]], [http://www.talk2action.org/story/2006/9/19/123927/589 Kansas Attorney General Kline's Leaked Memo For Church Involvement In Politics], ''[[Talk2Action]]'', September 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In the memo, Kline tells his staff how to form a campaign committee for him at each church that will educate and register voters, "encourage people to contribute and volunteer," and network with their own email lists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewsonfirst.org/06c/kline_memo.pdf Kline memo], JewsOnFirst.org&lt;/ref&gt; Kline has defended the memo and the mobilization of churches it calls for, insisting it does not violate [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|IRS regulations governing the tax-exempt status of churches]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjonline.com/stories/091506/leg_agdebate.shtml Kline defends memo during debate] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926233932/http://www.cjonline.com/stories/091506/leg_agdebate.shtml |date=2007-09-26 }}, ''Topeka Capital-Journal'', September 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; under which a church stands to lose its tax-exempt status for officially supporting a political candidate, if the [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue]] so determines.

==Work attendance and residency controversy==
[[KCTV]], a Kansas City CBS affiliate, aired an investigative report that addressed accusations that Kline did not reside within Johnson County as required by state law, and that he spent an inadequate amount of time at the district attorney's office.&lt;ref name="kctv5.com"&gt;[http://www.kctv5.com/news/14699737/detail.html KCTV5 News Investigates Phill Kline - News Story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129211925/http://www.kctv5.com/news/14699737/detail.html |date=2007-11-29 }}, KCTV5.com; accessed May 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He had rented a small apartment in Stilwell, and was registered to vote from that location. The KCTV reporters said in their report they were unable to observe Kline or his family at the address.  On two occasions, Kline was tailed by reporters from Johnson County back to Topeka, the location of his primary residence.&lt;ref name="kctv5.com"/&gt; 
 
The Johnson County Sheriff's Office initially refused KCTV-5 access to records that log ID card passes at the Johnson County Courthouse garage, citing security concerns.  Through exercise of the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], KCTV initially received redacted and incomplete records via the Johnson County Sheriff's Office.  According to the report, the security system only saves 90 days worth of data and purged much of the electronic records in question.&lt;ref name="kctv5.com"/&gt; The KCTV report, based on the incomplete records, also suggested that Kline spent an inadequate amount of time in the Johnson Country District Attorney's Office, averaging only 29 hours per week.&lt;ref name="kctv5.com"/&gt;  KCTV5 devoted an entire 10pm newscast to deal with criticisms leveled at KCTV5's handling of the investigation the following day.&lt;ref name=Topeka&gt;[https://www.pitch.com/news/article/20587548/kline-buys-joco-house-from-campaign-donors Kline buys JoCo house from campaign donors], ''[[The Pitch (newspaper)|The Pitch]]'', Justin Kendall, July 1, 2008. Retrieved June 17, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-electoral career==
In January, 2009, Kline left Kansas to become a visiting professor at the [[Liberty University School of Law]], in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]]. He is now an associate professor at the school, which has combined with the [[Jesse Helms School of Government]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.pitch.com/plog/2009/01/guess_what_phill_kline_blogs_about Guess what Phill Kline blogs about?]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[The Pitch (newspaper)|The Pitch]]'', Justin Kendall, January 26, 2009. Retrieved June 15, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===License to practice law suspended===
In 2010 the Kansas Supreme Court Disciplinary Administrator brought formal professional ethics charges against Kline before the [[Kansas Supreme Court]] based on perjury, an illegal file transfer, misleading legal guidance that Kline had provided to the grand jury in the Johnson County clinic case, the O'Reilly appearance, and several other matters. Kline's ethics trial began on February 21, 2011. He testified that he had the right to deceive state agencies to gain information in abortion investigations and that he had no duty to promptly notify a trial judge that he had provided flawed information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |title=Phill Kline says deception OK in abortion investigations|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/700112162/Kline-says-deception-OK-in-abortion-investigations.html|first=John|last=Hanna|work=Deseret News|date=2011-02-21|accessdate=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 13, 2011, the Kansas state Board of Discipline of Attorneys recommended that Kline's [[Admission to practice law|law license]] be indefinitely suspended, citing a pattern of repeatedly misleading statements, "dishonest and selfish motives", and a failure to "take any responsibility for his misconduct."  Kline disputed the Board's findings as politically motivated.&lt;ref name="aba-board"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[ABA Journal]]|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/ethics_panel_recommends_indefinite_suspension_for_ex-kansas_ag|title=Ethics Panel Recommends Indefinite Suspension for Ex-Kansas AG|first=Mark|last=Hansen|accessdate=June 15, 2018|date=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendation to suspend his license went to the state's Supreme Court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Cooper, Brad|title=Kansas board backs indefinite suspension for Phill Kline|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2011/10/13/3206427/disciplinary-board-says-phill.html|work=Kansas City Star|date=October 13, 2011|accessdate=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Kline's demands resulted in the unusual recusal of five Justices and a substitute appeals court judge from the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cjonline.com/state/2012-08-14/kline-seeks-ouster-judge-disciplinary-panel Kline seeks ouster of judge from disciplinary panel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170605043423/http://cjonline.com/state/2012-08-14/kline-seeks-ouster-judge-disciplinary-panel |date=2017-06-05 }}, ''Topeka [[Capital Journal]]'', Tim Carpenter, August 14, 2012. Retrieved 24 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The court indefinitely suspended Kline's law license on October 18, 2013. The costs to the taxpayers of defending his license came to nearly $600,000.&lt;ref name=suspended/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Rizzo, Tony|title=Phill Kline indefinitely suspended from practicing law|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2013/10/18/4560734/kline-indefinitely-suspended-from.html#storylink=cpy |work=Kansas City Star|date=October 18, 2013|accessdate=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] -- the only level of federal court which could overrule the state supreme court decision&lt;ref name="fed_court_rejects_2017_07_03_ljworld_com"&gt;[[Associated Press]], [http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2017/jul/03/federal-court-rejects-ex-ags-lawsuit-against-kansa/?kansas_legislature "Federal court rejects ex-AG’s lawsuit against Kansas Supreme court,"] July 3, 2017, ''[[Lawrence Journal-World]]'' Retrieved June 15, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; -- announced on April 28, 2014 that it was declining to hear Kline's request to review the suspension of his Kansas license to practice law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press |title= Supreme Court rejects appeal from ex-Kansas Attorney General Kline over suspended law license|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2014/04/28/high-court-turns-down-ex-kansas-attorney-general|work=U.S. News &amp; World Report|date=April 28, 2014|accessdate=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Kline continued to pursue the matter as a federal case, in federal District court, where he lost in 2016. He then appealed that decision to the [[10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]] in Denver -- losing again, July 3, 2017, by the decision of a three-judge panel who refused to allow the case to be reopened in federal court.&lt;ref name="fed_court_rejects_2017_07_03_ljworld_com" /&gt;

By offering bi-weekly and monthly installment loans, Plain Green helps consumers meet their emergency, cash-flow needs quickly and online. Plain Green markets, underwrites, and services its own portfolio.

==History==
In 2011, Plain Green Loans issued over 121,000 loans.&lt;ref name = "missoulian"/&gt; Because the Chippewa Cree Tribe is a [[Sovereignty|sovereign nation]] which enjoys tribal immunity, it is not subject to state laws which seek to prevent [[usury]] by regulating high-interest lending.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10012473 | title= The Guardian | work=Tribe's high-interest online lending venture booms | date=December 26, 2011 | agency=AP Foreign | accessdate=December 27, 2011 | author=Volz, Matt | location=London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, a coalition of Indian tribes welcomed a Colorado court ruling that tribal immunity has no territorial boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indian tribes welcome ruling on sovereignty |url=http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_19968984|accessdate=15 February 2012|newspaper=Denver Post|date=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, several members of the tribe were convicted of illegally siphoning seven percent of the company's revenues which totaled $25 million over a three-year period.&lt;ref name="funneled"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://flatheadbeacon.com/2014/09/09/chippewa-cree-tribal-members-funneled-cash-lending-company/|title=Chippewa Cree Tribal Members Funneled Cash from Lending Company|date=September 9, 2014|accessdate=21 June 2015|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;


In January 2018, there was a successful settlement was reported between Plain Green Loans and BEH Gaming Ltd related to loans to the Chippewa Cree Tribe and Chippewa Cree Tribe Development Corporation. The settlement and Plain Green’s payment of the debt to BEH releases the Chippewa Cree Tribe and Chippewa Cree Tribe Development Corporation from all liability. The agreement settles a lawsuit filed by Florida-based BEH Gaming Ltd in 2014 (Case # DV-14-142 in the 12th Judicial District Court in Hill County, Montana) to repay loans to expand Northern Winz Hotel and Casino. &lt;ref&gt; Ross, Alex (January 5, 2018). “Havre Daily News”. Plain Green settles with BEH over loan lawsuit.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

'''Princess Elisabeth Antarctica''', located on [[Utsteinen Nunatak]] in [[Queen Maud Land]] ({{coord|71.949944|S|23.347079|E|format=dms|region:AQ|display=inline}}), is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] scientific polar research station, which went into service on February 15, 2009. 

==History==
The station, designed, built and operated by the [[International Polar Foundation]], is the first polar base that combines eco-friendly construction materials, clean and [[efficient energy use]], optimization of the station's energy consumption and clever waste-management techniques.

Testing phase in [[Brussels]] and building construction in [[Antarctica]] was coordinated by Belgian main contractor [[BESIX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.solaripedia.com/13/23/princess_elisabeth_antarctica_polar_station.html |title =Project: Princess Elisabeth Antarctica Polar Station |access-date =2 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The station is built against a ridge (The Utsteinen ridge) that is exposed to gales of up to {{Convert|300|km/h|mph}}. The station can withstand such strong winds through its aerodynamic shape and its foundation anchoring of several metres deep into the [[permafrost]]. [[Philippe Samyn]], a Belgian architect, was involved in designing the shell and underlying structure. The upper deck of the building is the actual station and looks over the ridge edge. The lower deck contains a garage for [[snowcat]] vehicles and other utilities. 

The Princess Elisabeth base is the only [[Zero emission|zero-emission]] base on the Antarctic, and runs entirely on solar and wind energy through the use of a micro [[smart grid]]. The station is connected to nine [[wind turbine]]s that stretch out along the Utsteinen ridge. It houses up to 16 scientists at a time. 

The station is named after [[Princess Elisabeth, Duchess of Brabant]], the eldest daughter of [[King Philippe of Belgium]].

==Ownership dispute== 
There was a protracted dispute between the [[government of Belgium]] and [[Alain Hubert]] as to which party controls the base.&lt;ref name="SciMag" &gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/01/science-suffers-cold-war-over-polar-base |publisher=''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' |title=Science suffers in cold war over polar base |first=Martin |last=Enserink |date=January 17, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118170422/http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/01/science-suffers-cold-war-over-polar-base |archive-date=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Belgian Government has alleged financial mismanagement by the base's private operators, the International Polar Foundation.&lt;ref name="SciMag" /&gt; Disputes over ownership and control of the base have led to a reduction in scientific research being undertaken at the base.&lt;ref name="SciMag" /&gt; As per ''[[L'Echo]]'', the head of the [[Belgian Federal Science Policy Office]], René Delcourt, has stated that no Belgian scientists would be sent to the station in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.brusselstimes.com/rss-feed/7135/princess-elisabeth-polar-station-canadian-scientist-expected-in-january-uncertainty-about-belgians |publisher=''[[The Brussels Times]]'' |title=Princess Elisabeth polar station – Canadian scientist expected in January, uncertainty about Belgians |date=December 9, 2016 |access-date=January 20, 2017 |first=Christopher |last=Vincent |quote=The announcement coincided with a report in l’Echo daily in Belgium that there “will be no [Belgian] State mission to Antartica this year” [...] The daily reported that the head of Belgium’s Federal Science Policy Office, René Delcourt, had informed the International Polar Foundation in a letter dated the 1st of December that Belgium would not send any scientists to the polar station this year.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispute was resolved on 9 June 2017 as a judgement ruled by the Belgian Council of State. Publicly announced on June 30, 2017 as the "Pax Antarctica", the settlement between the International Polar Foundation and the Belgian government includes the Belgian government fully owning the base, the International Polar Foundation receiving contracts to operate the base for the next six years, and a cessation of all legal proceedings. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PAX ANTARCTICA|url=http://www.polarfoundation.org/news_press/press_release/pax_antarctica|website=International Polar Foundation|accessdate=24 February 2018|date=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research work resumed in November 2017, with 24 scientists from 12 different countries expected at the base. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Apelblat|first1=M.|title=Belgian polar station in Antarctica starts to work again|url=http://www.brusselstimes.com/brussels/9645/belgian-polar-station-in-antarctica-starts-to-work-again|website=Brussels Times|accessdate=24 February 2018|date=26 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Principles of European Tort Law''''' ('''PETL''') are a compilation of guidelines by the [[European Group on Tort Law]] aiming at the harmonization of European [[tort law]]. They are not intended to serve as a model code, even though their wording may resemble statutory texts. At least with respect to form and structure, they resemble a U.S. [[Restatement of the Law]].

The Principles of European Tort Law are intended to serve as a common framework for the further development of national tort laws and also of singular European legislation, which could avoid a further drifting-apart of piecemeal rule-making both on a national and on the European level.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10564">'''Recognition''' is the process in some jurisdictions whereby a man is recognised as the father of a child in situations where there is no [[presumption of paternity]], generally due to the mother being unwed. Historically due to the [[Roman law]] principle of ''[[Mater semper certa est]]'' (the mother is always certain) this action was not available to mothers, but since the introduction of [[in-vitro fertilisation]] this has changed. It is an act that confers [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimacy]] on the child.

== Overview ==
When a child is born the mother is known, but the father is not certain. When the mother is married, the husband is presumed to be the father (see [[presumption of legitimacy]]). When the mother is unmarried, some jurisdictions require the father to take extra steps to be recognised as the father, the [[presumption of paternity]] does not apply. The laws vary between jurisdictions but common themes are:
* the mother must give consent
* a child can only be 'recognised' once
* if the child is old enough it must also give consent
* it can often be done prior to the birth of the child
There is no requirement that the recogniser actually be the biological father. In fact, if the child already has a legal father (by the presumption of paternity or by prior recognition) the biological father may not be allowed to recognise their own biological child unless the legal father voluntarily denies fatherhood; a child may only have one legal father. This can happen in cases where the presumed father discovers a child is not their biological child (see [[paternity fraud]]). In this case the law holds the rights of the "social father" above those of the "biological father".

In all cases it is a voluntary act by the father to recognise a child.

== The Netherlands ==
Article 199 of Book 1 of the [[Burgerlijk Wetboek]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Artikel 199 BW1 |url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/jci1.3:c:BWBR0002656&amp;amp;boek=1&amp;amp;titeldeel=11&amp;amp;afdeling=1&amp;amp;artikel=199&amp;amp;z=2013-01-01&amp;amp;g=2013-01-01 |website=wetten.overheid.nl |accessdate=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; determines that the man who recognises a child becomes the child's legal father. This can be done by a [[public instrument]], or by an ''act of recognition'', completed by a officer of the [[Register office]]. It also the lists situations where 'recognition' may be considered invalid.
* the blood relationship between the recogniser and the mother is such that it would not be possible to marry.
* the recogniser has not reached the age of 16.
* the mother has not given consent (if the child has not reached the age of 16).
* the child has not given consent (if the child is older than 12)
* the child already has two legal parents.
The requirement for the mother to consent can be overridden by a court, but only if the recogniser is the biological father, or if the lifelong partner of the mother consented to an act that could have led to the birth of the child, unless it would disrupt the relationship between the mother and the child, or it would not be in the best interests of the child.

The act of recognising a child does not automatically grant [[legal guardianship]], this must be applied for separately via [[court order]].

Since 2014 the act of recognition is also available to women who wish to be recognised as the mother of a child born to another women, for example if they are in a lesbian relationship.

In 2012 over 90% of all children of unwed mothers were recognised before the first year of age. Of the children born in 2000 only 9% remained unrecognised in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2012/45/kinderen-van-niet-gehuwde-ouders-vaker-erkend Kinderen van niet gehuwde ouders vaker erkend]''. CBS 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Denial of fatherhood ===
Denial of fatherhood is possible, but only if the presumed father is not the biological father&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Artikel 200 BW1|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/jci1.3:c:BWBR0002656&amp;amp;boek=1&amp;amp;titeldeel=11&amp;amp;afdeling=2&amp;amp;artikel=200&amp;amp;z=2013-01-01&amp;amp;g=2013-01-01 |website=wetten.overheid.nl |accessdate=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This procedure can be initiated by any of the father, the mother or the child.
* the mother within one year of the birth of the child
* the father within one year of when he becomes aware that he is not the biological father
* the child within three years of becoming aware of who the biological father is, or before three years after the age of majority.

== Belgium ==
Recognition in Belgium is set out in Article 315 and subsequent articles of the Belgian Burgerlijk Wetboek&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Artikel 319 BW1 |url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/loi_a1.pl?language=nl&amp;la=N&amp;cn=1804032130&amp;table_name=wet&amp;&amp;caller=list&amp;N&amp;fromtab=wet&amp;tri=dd+AS+RANK&amp;rech=1&amp;numero=1&amp;sql=(text+contains+(%27%27))#LNK0044 |website=www.ejustice.just.fgov.be |accessdate=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
* A child born to a married woman or within 300 days of divorce has the husband as legal father (presumption of paternity)
* The presumption does not apply if the presumed parents were not (formally) living together 300 days prior to the birth, unless the presumed parents make a declaration at the registration of the birth.
* The recognition can occur at birth, or later via any [[legal instrument]], with the exception of a [[Will and testament|testament]].
* A child can be recognised only once, subsequent acts of recognition are invalid as long as the previous acts are valid.
** If there is no mother on the birth certificate, and act of recognition can be done by a woman.
** If there is no legal father, another women may recognise the child. The child will then legally have two mothers, the second mother is then referred to as '''meemoeder''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' ("together mother").
If the man/woman recognising a child is married to someone other than the legal mother of the child, then the act of recognition cannot be enforced until the spouse has been notified.

A challenge to the presumed legal fatherhood can be started:
* by the mother, within one year of the birth;
* by the legal father, within one year of discovering they are not the biological father;
* by the biological father, within one year of discovering they are the biological father;
* by the child, no earlier than the age of 12 and no later than the age of 22, or within one year of discovery the legal father is not the biological father.
A challenge cannot succeed if the legal father is the social father; that is, they act as a father toward the child, and they are considered the father by others (in ''possession of status'' – ''{{Interlanguage link multi|bezit van staat|nl}}'').

== France ==
Whether the parents are married or not, maternal affiliation is automatically established once the name of the woman is on the birth certificate. By contrast, if the parents are not married to each other, the [[presumption of paternity]] does not apply. By article 312 and the following articles of the Civil Code, paternity may be assumed in this case by a  man wishing to recognise the child, by a declaration made in a [[public instrument]] before&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Translation French Civil Code 2013 (en) |url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/Media/Traductions/English-en/code_civil_20130701_EN |website=www.legifrance.gouv.fr |accessdate=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
* a registrar, recognition is inserted into the birth certificate if it is made simultaneously with the declaration of birth, otherwise by explicit act.
* a notary, by deed, for example a valid testament.
* a court (the statement is inserted in the minutes of hearing).
Recognition can be done before birth ("déclaration sur le ventre"), during the declaration of birth or afterwards.

France recognises the possibility of [[anonymous birth]] for unwed women, in which case the mother's name does not appear on the birth certificate. In this case recognition by the mother after the fact is also possible.

== Germany ==
The legal framework for the recognition of paternity is defined in section 1594 of the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German Civil Code]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Section 1594 BGB (english) |url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bgb/englisch_bgb.html#p5513 |website=www.gesetze-im-internet.de |accessdate=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A child has in certain circumstances (initially) no legal father. This is always the case where no legal presumption of paternity exists, for example if at the time of birth the mother is unmarried  or [[divorced]] or the marriage is legally annulled, or if the husband is deceased more than 300 days before the child's birth. The same applies to a child whose origin is unclear (a foundling) or if the previous paternity in the context of [[paternity fraud]] was excluded.

In these cases, an recognition of paternity by a man together with the consent of the child's mother results in the legal paternity of the child. Whether the recogniser is also the biological father of the child is irrelevant; the legislature intended to create with the process of the recognition of paternity the possibility for legal paternity for men that fill an actual father role ("social father"), in the absence of a biological father (for example in blended families). The act of recognition is not an assertion by a man that he is in fact the biological father of the child.

== Poland ==
Family and Guardianship Code in art. 64&lt;ref name="2018-07-15"&gt;{{cite web |title=Polish Family Code (english) |url=https://kenarova.com/law/Family%20Code.pdf |website=kenarova.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that the recognition of paternity can occur if
* there is no presumption that the father of the child is the husband of the mother (such presumption exists if the child was born during the marriage or before three hundred days after the divorce).
* the presumption has been rebutted (this can only occur as a result of an action for denial of paternity).
In the case of any of the above two situations, paternity can occur by the acknowledgement of paternity by the father or by judgement of a court.

The statement necessary to establish paternity may be submitted by a person if they are at least 16 years of age and there are no grounds for [[Capacity (law)|legal incapacitation]].

If a man having recognised paternity does not have full legal capacity, he may make a statement necessary for the recognition of paternity only before a court guardianship.

Retrieved January 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ordinarily referred to as '''Regulation FD''' or '''Reg FD''', is a regulation that was promulgated by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) in August 2000.&lt;ref name = "FD Adoption"&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-7881.htm Adoption of Final Rule]. Retrieved January 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The regulation is codified as {{USCFR|17|243}}. Although "FD" stands for "fair disclosure," as can be learned from the adopting release, the regulation was and is codified in the Code of Federal Regulations simply as Regulation FD.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reg FD in e-CFR |url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?amp;node=17:4.0.1.1.4&amp;rgn=div5}}&lt;/ref&gt;Subject to certain limited exceptions, the rules generally prohibit public companies from disclosing previously nonpublic, [[material information]] to certain parties unless the information is distributed to the public first or simultaneously.

The regulation sought to stamp out [[selective disclosure]], in which some investors (often large [[institutional investor]]s) received [[market moving information]] before others (often smaller, individual investors), and were allowed to trade on it.  Under Regulation FD, selective disclosure may be made so long as the company firsts collects a confidentiality agreement from the other party (or the other party is already subject to a duty of trust and confidence).  Although the agreement need not include an undertaking not to trade on the information, the regulation was heavily driven by a desire to make it easier to prosecute recipients of selective information for insider trading, because in many instances only persons who owe such a duty are subject to such prosecution.  Thus, the SEC explained in the Proposing Release: 

"To make clear the scope of the Regulation, paragraph (b) of Rule 100 expressly states that the Rule does not apply to disclosures of material information to persons who are bound by duties of trust or confidence not to disclose or use the information for trading. Paragraph (b) expressly refers to several types of persons whose misuse of the information would subject them to insider trading liability under Rule 10b-5: (1) "temporary" insiders of an issuer – e.g., outside consultants, such as its attorneys, investment bankers, or accountants;42 and (2) any other person who has expressly agreed to maintain the information in confidence, and whose misuse of the information for trading would thus be covered either under the "temporary insider" or "misappropriation" theory." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reg FD Proposal (see text accompanying footnotes 42 and 43) |url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/34-42259.htm#P60_38580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, in essence, there is an exception to Regulation FD that allows disclosure to anyone who is an insider, or becomes a "temporary insider," subject to insider trading prohibitions.

On April 2, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission said companies can use social media to disseminate information if certain requirements are met. As with company websites, investors’ access to the chosen social media platform must not be restricted and investors must be notified about which social media will be used to disseminate information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Birnbach|first=Deborah|title=SEC Clarifies Social Media Use and Reg FD Compliance|url=http://www.goodwinprocter.com/Publications/Newsletters/Client-Alert/2013/0405_SEC-Clarifies-Social-Media-Use-and-Reg-FD-Compliance.aspx?article=1|accessdate=8-9-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1990s, most individual investors followed the progress of their stock holdings by receiving phone calls from their [[stockbroker|broker]], by reading annual or quarterly reports mailed to them by the company, by reading news in newspapers or financial publications, or by calling the company with questions. Most investors relied primarily upon [[stockbroker|full service broker]]s, such as [[Merrill Lynch]], for trading advice.

During the 1990s, Internet usage became widespread and online discount brokers such as [[Charles Schwab Corporation|Charles Schwab]], [[E-Trade]] and [[Ameritrade]] allowed individual investors to trade stocks online at the push of a button.  At the same time, these investors began using the Internet to research stocks and make timely, more informed trading decisions.  The Internet placed a plethora of rich research information into the hands of investors, who became more empowered than ever to make their own informed investing decisions.  As these investors learned the joys of real-time stock quotes and near-real-time access to press releases, they began to demand even more access.

By 1999, individual investors became more aware of quarterly analyst [[Earnings call|conference calls]], where a company's management would disclose the results of the quarter and answer analyst questions about the company's past performance and future prospects. At the time, most companies did not allow small investors to attend their calls.  

One small investor, Mark Coker, founded a company called Bestcalls.com, a directory of conference calls open to all investors, to help persuade public companies to open up all their calls ([http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1999/04/02/BU83193.DTL] and [http://www.thestreet.com/comment/siliconbabylon/734615.html]). Coker campaigned in the press to educate individual investors about the benefits of conference call attendance as a fundamental research tool, and worked constructively with the SEC to educate them about the pervasiveness of selective disclosure on earnings conference calls. At the same time, companies such as Onstream Media, [[Broadcast.com]], Vcall.com, Shareholder.com and [[Thomson Financial]] (now [[Thomson Reuters]]) offered webcasting technology and services that made it more practical, and more affordable, for companies to allow all investors to listen in.  

In December 1999, the SEC proposed Regulation FD. Thousands of individual investors wrote the SEC and voiced their support for the regulation.  But support was not unanimous. Large institutional investors, accustomed to benefiting from selectively disclosed material information, fought vigorously against the proposed regulation. They argued that fair disclosure would lead to less disclosure.  In October 2000, the SEC promulgated Regulation FD.

'''Report of the International Commission to Inquire into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan Wars''' is a document published in the [[Washington D.C.]] in 1914 by the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]].

The International Commission to Inquire into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan Wars consisted of university professors and other prominent individuals from [[French Third Republic|France]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], United States, [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austro-Hungary|Austria]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. Among the members of the Commission there were three [[Nobel Prize]] winners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IzI0uOZ2j6gC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=serbia+albania+1912&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=8#v=onepage&amp;q=serbia%20albania%201912&amp;f=false Miranda Vickers, The Albanians: a modern history (p. 72)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission went to the [[Balkans]] at the beginning of August and remained until the end of September 1913. After returning to [[Paris]] all the material was processed and released in the form of detailed [[report]]. The report speaks of the numerous violations of international conventions and [[war crimes]] committed during the [[Balkan Wars]]. The information collected were published by the Endowment in the early summer of 1914, but were soon overshadowed by the beginning of the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=199 Other Balkan Wars: A 1913 Carnegie Endowment Inquiry in Retrospect]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Safety management system''' (SMS) is a comprehensive management system designed to manage safety elements in the workplace. It includes policy, objectives, plans, procedures, organisation, responsibilities and other measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://safetysolutions.co.nz/mhf/| title=Major Hazard Facility| publisher=Safety Solutions Limited| accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SMS is used in industries that manage significant safety risks, including aviation, petroleum, chemical, electricity generation and others.

==Description==
An SMS provides a systematic way to identify hazards and control risks while maintaining assurance that these risk controls are effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/saso/library/media/SASO_Briefing_Managers_Toolkit.pdf |title=System Approach for Safety Oversight| accessdate=2009-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203709/http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/saso/library/media/SASO_Briefing_Managers_Toolkit.pdf |archivedate=November 21, 2010| work=SASO Outreach| date=Spring 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; SMS can be defined as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...a businesslike approach to safety. It is a systematic, explicit and comprehensive process for managing safety risks. As with all management systems, a safety management system provides for goal setting, planning, and measuring performance. A safety management system is woven into the fabric of an organization. It becomes part of the culture, the way people do their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tc.gc.ca/civilaviation/SystemSafety/Pubs/tp13739/menu.htm Transport Canada publication TP 13739] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616122701/http://www.tc.gc.ca/CivilAviation/systemSafety/pubs/tp13739/menu.htm |date=June 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For the purposes of defining safety management, safety can be defined as: &lt;blockquote&gt;... the reduction of risk to a level that is as low as is reasonably practicable.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are three imperatives for adopting a safety management system for a business – these are ethical, legal and financial.

There is an implied moral obligation placed on an employer to ensure that work activities and the place of work to be safe, there are legislative requirements defined in just about every jurisdiction on how this is to be achieved and there is a substantial body of research which shows that effective safety management (which is the reduction of risk in the workplace) can reduce the financial exposure of an organisation by reducing direct and indirect costs associated with accident and incidents.

To address these three important elements, an effective SMS should:
* Define how the organisation is set up to manage risk.
* Identify workplace risk and implement suitable controls.
* Implement effective communications across all levels of the organisation.
* Implement a process to identify and correct non-conformities.
* Implement a continual improvement process.

A safety management system can be created to fit any business type and/or industry sector.

==Basic safety-management components==

===International Labour Organization SMS model===
Since there are many models to choose from to outline the basic components of a safety management system, the one chosen here is the international standard promoted by the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO). In the ILO document,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ilo.org/safework/info/standards-and-instruments/WCMS_107727/lang--en/index.htm| title=ILO-OSH 2001 Guidelines on Occupational Safety and Health Management Systems| date=1 January 2009| publisher=International Labour Organisation| isbn=92-2-111634-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the safety management basic components are:
* Policy
* Organizing
* Planning and implementation
* Evaluation
* Action for improvement

Although other SMS models use different terminology, the process and workflow for safety management systems are usually similar;
# Policy – Establish within policy statements what the requirements are for the organization in terms of resources, defining management commitment and defining occupational safety and health (OSH) targets
# Organizing – How is the organization structured, where are responsibilities and accountabilities defined, who reports to who and who is responsible for what.
# Planning and Implementation – What legislation and standards apply to our organization, what OSH objectives are defined and how are these reviews, hazard prevention and the assessment and management of risk.
# Evaluation – How is OSH performance measured and assessed, what are the processes for the reporting of accidents and incidents and for the investigation of accidents and what internal and external audit processes are in place to review the system.
# Action for Improvement – How are preventative and corrective actions managed and what processes are in place to ensure the continual improvement process. There is a significant amount of detail within each of these sections and these should be examined in detail from the ILO-OSH Guidelines document.

==Regulatory perspective==

===Implications===
A SMS is intended to act as a framework to allow an organisation, as a minimum, to meet its legal obligations under [[occupational safety and health]] law. The structure of a SMS is generally speaking, not of itself a legal requirement but it is an extremely effective tool to organise the myriad aspects of occupational safety and health (OSH) that can exist within an organisation, often to meet standards which exceed the minimum legal requirement.

An SMS is only as good as its implementation – effective safety management means that organisations need to ensure they are looking at all the risks within the organization as a single system, rather than having multiple, competing, ‘Safety Management Silos.’&lt;ref name="FSF AeroSafetyWorld"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://flightsafety.org/asw/may08/asw_may08_p12-17.pdf| title=Safety Management Systems| first1=Andy| last1=Evans| first2=John| last2=Parker| date=May 2008| work=Beyond Safety Management Systems| pages=12–17| publisher=AeroSafety World}}&lt;/ref&gt; If safety is not seen holistically, it can interfere with the prioritization of improvements or even result in safety issues being missed. For example, after an explosion in March 2005 at BP's [[Texas City Refinery (BP)]] the investigation concluded that the company had put too much emphasis on personal safety thus ignoring the safety of their processes.&lt;ref name="sunnyday"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sunnyday.mit.edu/Baker-panel-report.pdf| title=Report of the BP US Refineries Independent Safety Review Panel| first=James A| last=Baker| date=January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The antidote to such silo thinking is the proper evaluation of all risks, a key aspect of an effective SMS.&lt;ref name="sunnyday"/&gt;

==Implementation==

===Adoption for industry sectors===
There are a number of industry sectors worldwide which have recognised the benefits of effective safety management. The regulatory authorities for these industries have developed safety management systems specific to their own industries and requirements, often backed up by regulation. Below are examples from different industry sectors from a number of varied worldwide locations.

====Civil aviation====
The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] has recommended that all aviation authorities implement SMS regulatory structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.icao.int/safety/SafetyManagement/Pages/default.aspx| title=Safety Management| publisher=ICAO}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICAO has provided resources to assist with implementation, including the ICAO Safety Management Manual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.icao.int/safety/SafetyManagement/Documents/Doc.9859.3rd%20Edition.alltext.en.pdf| title=Safety Management Manual| publisher=ICAO| date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the traditional occupational safety focus of SMS, the ICAO focus is to use SMS for managing aviation safety.  ''Id''.

The ICAO High-level Safety Conference 2010 recommendation 2/5 proposed the development of a new Annex (19) dedicated to Safety Management. 
The Annex was published in February 2013 and entered into force on November 14, 2013.
The benefits identified of this approach included: 
* Address safety risks proactively;
* Manage and support strategic regulatory and infrastructure developments;
* Re-enforce the role played by the State in managing safety at the State level, in coordination with service providers;
* Stress the concept of overall safety performance in all domains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icao.int/safety/SafetyManagement/Pages/Annex-19,-1st-Edition---Executive-summary.aspx Annex 19 (Safety Management Systems) Executive Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210131909/http://www.icao.int/safety/SafetyManagement/Pages/Annex-19%2C-1st-Edition---Executive-summary.aspx |date=December 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States has introduced SMS for airports through an advisory circular&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.faa.gov/airports/resources/advisory_circulars/| work=Advisory Circular 150/5200-37| title=Introduction to Safety Management Systems for Airport Operators| date=28 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other guidance.&lt;ref name="FAA"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/sms/| title=Safety Management Systems| publisher=FAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States announced at the 2008 EASA/FAA/TC International Safety Conference that they would be developing regulations to implement SMS for repair stations, air carriers, and manufacturers. The FAA formed a rulemaking committee to address the implementation (known as the SMS ARC).&lt;ref&gt;http://pmaparts.wordpress.com/2010/02/17/can-you-implement-a-sms-program Blog Entry on the SMS ARC Progress: Can You Implement a SMS Program?&lt;/ref&gt; The SMS ARC reported its findings to the FAA on March 31, 2010.  The Report recognizes that many of the elements of SMS already exist in the U.S. regulations, but that some elements do not yet exist.&lt;ref&gt;Safety Management Systems Aviation Rulemaking Committee, Final Report&lt;/ref&gt;  A draft of what the US SMS rule might look like was proposed by one trade association that participated in the ARC.&lt;ref&gt;http://pmaparts.wordpress.com/2010/03/17/a-possible-look-for-sms-regulations/ Draft Part 195 (Safety Management Systems).&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, the FAA is supporting voluntary pilot projects for SMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/saso/library/media/SMS_Brochure.pdf |title=Safety Management System, The Future of AFS Oversight |accessdate=2009-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607022340/http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/saso/library/media/SMS_Brochure.pdf| archivedate=7 June 2011| publisher=FAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] has also required that all FAA services and offices adopt a common Aviation Safety (AVS) Safety Management System (AVSSMS).&lt;ref name="FAA" /&gt; This is what ICAO calls a State Safety Program (SSP).

The Federal Aviation Administration published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for the establishment of SMS for air carriers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-11-05/pdf/2010-28050.pdf ''Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: Safety Management Systems for Part 121 Certificate Holders'', 75 Fed. Reg. 68224 (November 5, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  That NPRM explains that it is intended to serve as the foundation for rules that would later be applied to Part 135 operators, Part 145 repair stations and Part 21 manufacturers.  ''Id''.  Several U.S. trade associations filed comments in response to the air carrier NPRM, including the Aviation Suppliers Association (ASA) comments in response to the SMS NPRM.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aviationsuppliers.org/ASA/files/ccLibraryFiles/Filename/000000000572/2011-03-07%20ASA%20SMS%20NPRM%20Comments.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the Modification and Replacement Parts Association (MARPA)&lt;ref&gt;http://pmaparts.org/gvt/2011-03-07_MARPA_SMS_NPRM_Comments.pdf MARPA's Comments in response to the SMS NPRM.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among these comments were arguments for developing separate SMS regulations for other certificate holders, in order to make sure that SM remains a usable tool for advancing safety (rather than a uniform but useless paperwork exercise).  In addition, the Federal Aviation Administration has also filed a NPRM for SMS for airports,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-10-07/pdf/2010-25338.pdf ''Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: Safety Management System for Certificated Airports'', 75 Fed. Reg. 62008 (October 7, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; which would be separate from the rules for SMS for air carriers (consistent with the arguments of the trade associations).

The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) began the process of implementing Safety Management System (SMS) regulations by issuing Terms of Reference (TOR) on July 18, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://pmaparts.wordpress.com/2011/07/28/easa-begins-the-process-of-implementing-sms-rules/ ''See'' Dickstein, ''EASA Begins the Process of Implementing SMS Rules'' (July 28, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  That was followed by a Notice of Proposed Amendment (NPA) issued on January 21, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://aviationsuppliers.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/european-sms-proposal-will-likely-affect-distributors/ ''See'' Dickstein, ''European SMS Proposal Will Likely Affect Distributors'' (January 21, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  The proposed EASA regulation would apply to repair stations,&lt;ref&gt;http://hub.easa.europa.eu/crt/docs/viewnpa/id_199 ''See'' Notice of Proposed Amendment (NPA) 2013-01 (Jan 21, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; but would have significant ancillary effects on other aviation industry sub-sectors.&lt;ref&gt;http://aviationsuppliers.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/european-sms-proposal-will-likely-affect-distributors/ ''See'' Dickstein, ''European SMS Proposal Will Likely Affect Distributors'' (January 21, 2013) (discussing the potential effect of the rule on aircraft parts distributors).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maritime industry====
The [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO) is another organization that has adopted SMS.  All international passenger ships and oil tankers, chemical tankers, gas carriers, bulk carriers and cargo ships of 500 gross tons or more are required to have a Safety Management System.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imo.org/humanelement/mainframe.asp?topic_id=287{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} International Safety Management (ISM) Code 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In the preamble to the International Safety Management (ISM) Code, the IMO states, “The cornerstone of good safety management is commitment from the top. In matters of safety and pollution prevention it is the commitment, competence, attitudes and motivation of individuals at all levels that determines the end result.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.admiraltylawguide.com/conven/ismcode1993.html The International Safety Management Code IMO Assembly Resolution A.741(18) – 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Railway industry====
[[Transport Canada]]’s Rail Safety Directorate incorporated SMS into the rail industry in 2001. The Rail Safety Management System requirements are set out in the ''Railway Safety Management System Regulations''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2001-37/FullText.html laws-lois.justice.gc.ca: "Railway Safety Management System Regulations"]&lt;/ref&gt; The objectives of the Rail Safety Management System Regulations are to ensure that safety is given management time and corporate resources and that it is subject to performance measurement and monitoring on par with corporate financial and production goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/railsafety/publications-tp13548-267.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928175257/http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/railsafety/publications-tp13548-267.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of SMS in the rail industry has not been positive, as a 2006 Toronto Star review of Transportation Safety Board data indicated that rail accidents were soaring.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/article/202496 Freight train accidents soar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209204806/http://www.thestar.com/article/202496 |date=February 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have argued that this evidence should preclude the adoption of SMS in the aviation sector.&lt;ref name="ca.news.yahoo.com"&gt;[http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/capress/090823/utravel/transport_safety_1 New rules for aviation safety a flight plan to disaster, critics warn]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Transportation Safety Board data show that the accident rate in the rail industry has actually varied around the average over that 10-year period. Since the Toronto Star article was published, the accident rate has decreased. The Transportation Safety Board reported that “a total of 1,143 rail accidents were reported to the TSB in 2008, a 14% decrease from the 2007 total of 1,323 and an 18% decrease from the 2003–2007 average of 1,387” and also noted that, in 2008, rail incidents reported under the TSB mandatory reporting requirements reached a 26-year low of 215.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/stats/rail/prelim-2008/index.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927232326/http://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/stats/rail/prelim-2008/index.asp |archivedate=September 27, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RSMSR has in 2015 been updated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2015-26/FullText.html laws-lois.justice.gc.ca: "Railway Safety Management System Regulations, 2015"]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14203">The '''''Seattle process''''' or '''''Seattle way'''''&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;{{cite book |title=Economic Development in American Cities: The Pursuit of an Equity Agenda |last=Bennett |first=Michael |year=2008 |publisher=SUNY Press |quote="The Seattle Way, while time consuming, reflects the city's bias toward openness, accessibility, and citizen participation." |isbn= |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a term stemming from the political procedure in [[Seattle]] and [[King County, Washington|King County]], and to a lesser extent other cities and the [[Washington (state)#Law and government|Washington state government]]. The term has no strict definition but refers to the pervasively slow process of dialogue, deliberation, participation, and municipal introspection before making any decision and the time it takes to enact any policy. An early definition came from a 1983 editorial in the ''[[Seattle Weekly]]'', "the usual Seattle process of seeking consensus through exhaustion."&lt;ref name=Moody&gt;{{cite book |title=Seattle and the Demons of Ambition: From Boom to Bust in the Number One City of the Future |last=Moody |first=Fred |year=2004 |publisher=Macmillan |location= |isbn= |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other definitions==
"In its positive connotation the Seattle Way values popular participation, transparent process and meaningful debate. More negatively, it has been decried as a culture that values process and debate over results, that bogs down and can't get important things done."—Mark Purcell, Recapturing Democracy.&lt;ref name=Purcell&gt;{{cite book|title= Recapturing Democracy: Neoliberalization and the Struggle for Alternative Urban Futures|last=Purcell |first=Mark Hamilton |year=2008 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |pages=111, 119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Seattle Way usually is defined as circular consultation reaching indecision. But it also consists of an uninvolved electorate and public decisions taken carelessly, without regard for experience elsewhere and unmindful of consequence."—Ted Van Dyk, contributing columnist to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer&lt;ref name=VanDyk2004&gt;{{cite news|title=Seattle Way blocks transportation issues|first=Ted|last=Van Dyk|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=February 19, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to the election of [[Wes Uhlman]] as mayor in 1969, civic decision making was relatively quick and powerful groups could influence civic leaders without seeking wide consensus.&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Economist |volume=361 |pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Expand, how/why did Uhlman change things? --&gt;

Proponents of the Seattle process, such as former city councilman [[Richard Conlin]], praised it as a thoughtful method of generating the best results at the expense of time.&lt;ref name=TimesMay2005&gt;{{cite news |title=Seattle Councilman Conlin flaunting penchant for process |first=Jim |last=Brunner |newspaper=Seattle Times |date=27 May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, opponents referred to Conlin in 2005 as the "Duke of Dither" for his devotion to process.&lt;ref name=Balter2005&gt;{{cite news |title=Monorail casts large shadow over City Council races |first=Joni |last=Balter |newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=21 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Seattle process became more drawn out, it has been criticized, usually by business interests as too slow and dithering. As an example, during the massive redevelopment of the [[Cascade, Seattle|Cascade]] and [[South Lake Union]] neighborhoods in the early 21st century it was criticized by [[Vulcan Inc.]] and [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]] that an in-depth discussion of all of the ideas would wear out the patience of other groups providing [[financial capital]]. Meanwhile, neighborhood activists complained that the proposed development ignored the neighborhood plans that were previously, and laboriously, developed in a consensual process.&lt;ref name=Purcell/&gt; City neighborhood activists generally like the deliberative process.&lt;ref name=Galloway2006&gt;{{cite news|title=Seattle City Council forges dull legacy |quote= "I am sure from the point of view of the downtown let's-get-it-done crowd, this council may deliberate too long. But the much-maligned 'Seattle process' may be a good thing,"|first=Angela |last=Galloway |newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=September 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ho2006&gt;{{cite news|title=City urged to pick up pace of decisions |quote= "The argument that this is a 'Seattle way' and a 'Seattle process' is a compliment in many aspects, because the people here have a greater tendency to examine a project and get a better deal," said Kent Cammerer, a Greenwood activist. |first=Vanessa |last=Ho |newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=March 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process has also been criticized for bland results.&lt;ref name=Galloway2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Westneat2011&gt;{{cite news|title=An outpouring of viaduct love |quote="I have a difficult time imagining that the famous Seattle process could ever come up with anything that exciting,"|first=Danny|last=Westneat|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=Jan 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
The Seattle process as an informal method values study, discussion and civic engagement. It will involve numerous stakeholder groups. It requires the community to present effective data, and for organizers to translate data from different constituencies into useful reports for decision makers.&lt;ref name=Whitacre&gt;{{cite book |title=Community perspectives on obesity prevention in children: workshop summaries |last=Whitacre |first=Paula |authorlink= |author2=Annina Catherine Burns |author3=Cathy Liverman  |year=2010 |publisher=National Academies Press |location= |isbn= |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using process to seek out consensus and hearing all opinions even extends to the corporate boardroom, not just government.&lt;ref name=Lyke1999&gt;{{cite news|title=Seattle will extend a hand in greeting and raise another in protest for WTO  |quote=Decisions are by consensus, and discussions in corporate boardrooms and council chambers can be interminable. This "Seattle Process," it is said, may satisfy everyone but pleases no one. "It's a very frustrating process. People talk forever. But the city does get things done, eventually," says Richard Morrill, a University of Washington professor who has spent decades studying Seattle and its demographics. |first=ML |last=Lyke|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=November 22, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods of participation typically include council meetings, neighborhood forums, ballot measures, and marches. Stakeholder groups are all-inclusive and usually include citizens, corporations, non-profits, neighborhood representatives, and [[identity politics|identity]] or [[advocacy group|issue]] specific groups.&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt;

Despite being called a "process" there is no definitive methodology to the Seattle process; in fact, while writing about Seattle taking four decades to build a light-rail line, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it a "mysterious and maddening phenomenon".&lt;ref name=NYTimes2009&gt;{{cite news |title=After Years of Debate, Light Rail Trains Enter Town |first=William |last=Yardley |newspaper=New York Times |date=31 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of the public meetings and methods open to the public, the Seattle process also causes delay while politicians either tinker with, or obstruct, proposals.&lt;ref name=TimesMay2005 /&gt; Other cities in the area declare their ability to get projects because of the lack of Seattle process.&lt;ref name=CheekJune2008&gt;{{cite news|title=Bremerton could teach Seattle a lesson about its waterfront |quote=Mark another reason comparisons may be unfair: no Seattle Process in Bremerton.|first=Lawrence|last=Cheek|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=June 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
The Seattle process, and claimed devotion to it, has been an issue in political races. In the 2001 Mayoral Election candidate [[Greg Nickels]] used devotion to Seattle process as an issue against his opponent, city attorney [[Mark Sidran]], who promised a more decisive style.&lt;ref name=nytimes2001&gt;{{cite news |title=Winner Emerges in Seattle Mayor's Race |first=SAM HOWE |last=VERHOVEK |newspaper=New York Times |date=17 November 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, eight years later Nickel's style as Mayor would be criticized in a re-election race as top-down, autocratic, and antithetical to the Seattle process.&lt;ref name=TimesAug2009&gt;{{cite news |title=Making nice: Seattle mayor's style a primary issue |first=George |last=Tibbits |newspaper=Seattle Times |date=9 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shibu Soren''' (born 11 January 1944) is an Indian politician who thrice served as [[Chief Minister of Jharkhand]], first in 2005 for 10 day (2nd March to 12th March), then from 2008 to 2009 and again from 2009 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = Rediff|url = http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/aug/27jhar.htm|title = Shibu Soren sworn in as Jharkhand CM|accessdate = 30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = IndianKanoon|url = http://indiankanoon.org/doc/782555/|title = Shibu Soren vs Cbi on 10 March, 1999|accessdate = 10 March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = TimesofIndia|url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-11-28/india/27801788_1_ajay-kumar-mehta-shailendra-bhattacharya-shashi-nath-jha|title = Shibu Soren, four others convicted in murder case|accessdate = 28 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sworn in as the third [[Chief Minister of Jharkhand]] on 30 December 2009 after winning the Jharkhand Assembly elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/aug/29soren.htm|title = Jharkhand CM Shibu Soren wins trust vote|accessdate = 2008-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned on 30 May 2010 after failing to obtain coalition support from the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]], his national party partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/05/31/stories/2010053158860100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Shibu Soren resigns; trust vote today | date=31 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He previously represented the [[Dumka (Lok Sabha Constituency)|Dumka]] constituency of Jharkhand in the [[14th Lok Sabha]], and is the President of the [[Jharkhand Mukti Morcha]] (JMM) political party, a constituent of the [[United Progressive Alliance|UPA]].

On 9 January 2009, Soren was defeated in the by-election for the Tamar assembly constituency by political novice Gopal Krishan Patar, alias Raja Peter, of the Jharkhand Party by a margin of over 9,000 votes. After the Assembly elections Soren once again formed the Government along with the BJP, and was sworn in as Chief Minister of Jharkhand on 30 December 2009.

He was the Minister for Coal in the [[Union Cabinet]] in November 2006, when a Delhi district court found him guilty in the murder of his private secretary Shashi Nath Jha in 1994.&lt;ref name=rediff&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been indicted in the past on other criminal charges.

==Life==
Soren was born in Nemra village of [[Ramgarh district]], in what was, at the time, [[Bihar]] [[States and territories of India|state]], India. He completed his schooling in the same district. During his schooling his father was murdered by "mahajans" (money lenders). He started selling wood as a small business. He got married to Roopi Kisku. He has three sons Durga, Hemant, and Basant and a daughter, Anjali.

Soren began his political career in the early 1970s and quickly became known as a tribal leader. On 23 January 1975, he allegedly incited a campaign to drive away "outsiders", or the 'non-tribal' people. At least eleven people were killed. Soren and numerous others were charged with various crimes related to this incident. After extended legal proceedings, Soren was acquitted on 6 March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/politics/soren-acquitted-in-chirudih-massacre-case_10024753.html Soren acquitted in Chirudih massacre case] Thaindian News. 6 March 2008. Retrieved 13 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, possibly related incitement charges—dating from two earlier deaths in 1974—remain pending.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/politics/verdict-in-murder-case-involving-soren-june-15_100374265.html Verdict in murder case involving Soren 15 June] Thaindian News. 3 June 2010.

Retrieved 13 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

He lost his first [[Lok Sabha]] election in 1977. He was first elected to the Lok Sabha in 1980. An arrest warrant was issued against him. He was subsequently elected to the Lok Sabha in 1989, 1991 and 1996 as well. In 2002, he was elected to the [[Rajya Sabha]]. He won the [[Dumka]] Lok Sabha seat in a by-election the same year and resigned his Rajya Sabha seat. He was re-elected in 2004.

He became the Union Coal Minister in the [[Manmohan Singh]] government, but was asked to resign following an arrest warrant in his name in the thirty-year-old Chirudih case. He was one of the main accused amongst 69, with allegations to kill 10 people (including 9 Muslims) on 23 January 1975, in a clash between tribals and Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 1975 Chirudih massacre: Past catches up with Shibu Soren, arrest warrant issued|url = http://m.indiatoday.in/story/court-declares-shibu-soren-absconder-in-1975-chirudih-massacre-case/1/195758.html|website = m.indiatoday.in|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the warrant was issued, he initially went underground. He resigned on 24 July 2004. He was able to secure bail after spending over a month in judicial custody; released on bail on 8 September, he was re-inducted into the Union Cabinet and given back the coal ministry on 27 November 2004, as part of a deal for a Congress-JMM alliance before assembly elections in [[Jharkhand]] in February/March 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2004/11/28/stories/2004112808950100.htm Soren back in Union Cabinet] ''[[The Hindu]]''. 28 November 2004. Retrieved 22 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 March 2005, after much political bargaining and quid pro quo he was invited to form the government in [[Jharkhand]] by the Governor of Jharkhand. He resigned as Chief Minister nine days later, on 11 March, following his failure to obtain a [[vote of confidence]] in the assembly.

==Life imprisonment and acquittal==
On 28 November 2006, Soren was found guilty in a twelve-year-old case involving the kidnapping and murder of his former personal secretary Shashinath Jha. It was claimed that Jha was abducted from the [[Dhaula Kuan]] area in [[Delhi]] on 22 May 1994 and taken to Piska Nagari village near [[Ranchi]] where he was killed. The CBI chargesheet stated that Jha's knowledge of the reported deal between the Congress and the JMM to save the Narasimha Rao government during the July 1993 [[no-confidence motion]] and an act of sodomy was the motive behind the murder. The charge-sheet asserted that: "Jha was aware of the illegal transactions and also expected and demanded a substantial share out of this amount from Soren." [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927122055/http://news.indlaw.com/527C7CE8127F523ABA578A792E73B70B].

Soren resigned from his post of [[Union Minister]] for Coal after [[Prime Minister]] [[Manmohan Singh]] demanded that he do so in the wake of the verdict. This is the first case of a Union Minister of the Government of India being found guilty of involvement in a murder. On 5 December 2006, Shibu Soren was sentenced to life imprisonment. A Delhi court rejected his bail plea, stating: 'We cannot overlook the fact that the appellant (Soren) has been convicted after a detailed and elaborate trial only in November 2006 and sentenced in December 2006.

A '''smart contract''' is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a [[contract]]. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties. These transactions are trackable and irreversible.

Proponents of smart contracts claim that many kinds of contractual clauses may be made partially or fully self-executing, self-enforcing, or both. The aim of smart contracts is to provide security that is superior to traditional contract law and to reduce other [[transaction costs]] associated with contracting. Various [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]] have implemented types of smart contracts.

==History==
Smart contracts were first proposed by [[Nick Szabo]], who coined the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2014/01/21/bitcoin-is-not-just-digital-currency-its-napster-for-finance/ |title=Bitcoin is not just digital currency. It’s Napster for finance |last=Morris |first=David Z. |date=21 January 2014 |website=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With the present implementations, based on [[Blockchain (database)|blockchains]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stafford|first1=Philip|last2=Murphy|first2=Hannah|title=Has the blockchain hype finally peaked?|url=https://www.ft.com/content/5e48f9ec-b651-11e6-ba85-95d1533d9a62|website=ft.com|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "smart contract" is mostly used more specifically in the sense of general purpose computation that takes place on a blockchain or distributed ledger. In this interpretation, used for example by the Ethereum Foundation&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buterin|first1=Vitalik|title=Ethereum Whitepaper|url=https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper/f18902f4e7fb21dc92b37e8a0963eec4b3f4793a|website=github|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or IBM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cachin|first1=Christian|title=Architecture of the Hyperledger Blockchain Fabric|url=https://www.zurich.ibm.com/dccl/papers/cachin_dccl.pdf|website=ibm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a smart contract is not necessarily related to the classical concept of a contract, but can be any kind of computer program.

In 2018, a [[US Senate]] report said:  "While smart contracts might sound new, the concept is rooted in basic contract law. Usually, the judicial system adjudicates contractual disputes and enforces terms, but it is also common to have another arbitration method, especially for international transactions. With smart contracts, a program enforces the contract built into the code."&lt;ref name=usSenate201803&gt;[https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/aaac3a69-e9fb-45b6-be9f-b1fd96dd738b/chapter-9-building-a-secure-future-one-blockchain-at-a-time.pdf Chapter 9:  Building a Secure Future, One blockchain at a time], [[US Senate]] [[Joint Economic Committee]], March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementations==
[[Byzantine fault tolerance|Byzantine fault tolerant]] algorithms allowed digital security through decentralization to form smart contracts. Additionally, the programming languages with various degrees of [[Turing-complete]]ness as a built-in feature of some [[blockchain]]s make the creation of custom sophisticated logic possible.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Notable examples of implementation of smart contracts are:
* [[Bitcoin]] also provides a Turing-incomplete Script language that allows the creation of custom smart contracts on top of Bitcoin like [[Multisignature|multisignature accounts]], payment channels, escrows, time locks, atomic cross-chain trading, oracles, or multi-party lottery with no operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=7th International Conference on Principles of Security and Trust (POST)|year=2018|last1=Atzei|last2=Bartoletti|last3=Cimoli|last4=Lande|last5=Zunino|first1=Nicola|first2=Massimo|first3=Tiziana|first4=Stefano|first5=Roberto|contribution=SoK: unraveling Bitcoin smart contracts|contribution-url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/192.pdf|chapter-format=PDF|publisher=European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ethereum]] implements a nearly Turing-complete language on its blockchain, a prominent smart contract framework.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|title=6th International Conference on Principles of Security and Trust (POST)|year=2017|last1=Atzei|last2=Bartoletti|last3=Cimoli|first1=Nicola|first2=Massimo|first3=Tiziana|contribution=A survey of attacks on Ethereum smart contracts|contribution-url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/1007.pdf|chapter-format=PDF|publisher=European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[RootStock]] (RSK) is a smart contract platform that is connected to the [[Bitcoin]] blockchain through [[Sidechain (ledger)|sidechain]] technology. RSK is compatible with smart contracts created for Ethereum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas Bocek |date= 15 September 2017 |title=Digital Marketplaces Unleashed |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-49275-8_19 |publisher=Springer-Verlag GmbH |pages=169–184 |isbn=978-3-662-49274-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fc17.ifca.ai/wtsc/Trust%20in%20Smart%20Contracts%20is%20a%20Process,%20As%20Well.pdf | title=Trust in Smart Contracts is a Process, As Well}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/264f/c40b4224b2bb7c23e4f84a0e728945fea525.pdf | title=Scripting smart contracts for distributed ledger technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Replicated titles and contract execution==
Szabo proposes that smart contract infrastructure can be implemented by replicated asset registries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://szabo.best.vwh.net/securetitle.html | author=Nick Szabo | title=Secure Property Titles with Owner Authority | year=2005 | accessdate=January 12, 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115142013/http://szabo.best.vwh.net/securetitle.html | archivedate=January 15, 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and contract execution using [[Merkle trees|cryptographic hash chains]] and [[Byzantine fault tolerance|Byzantine fault tolerant]] replication. [[Askemos]] implemented this approach
in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;?doi=10.1.1.11.5050&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf | year=2002 | author=Jörg F. Wittenberger | title=Askemos a distributed settlement |

(later adding [[SQLite]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://monami.hs-mittweida.de/frontdoor/index/index/docId/476 | title=Erstellung eines Archivierungskonzepts für die Speicherung rückverfolgbarer Datenbestände im Askemos-System | year=2009 | author=Martin Möbius}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://core.ac.uk/display/33987564 | title=Entwicklung einer Datenbankschnittstelle als Grundlage für Shop-Systeme unter dem Betriebssystem Askemos |  year=2010 | author=Tom-Steve Watzke}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as contract script language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://askemos.org/A0e80fdd97a7b6e7af87c5d294f39a96c | title=Beweiswürdigung elektronischer Dokumente im Zivilprozess unter vergleichender Betrachtung von qualifizierten elektronischen Signaturen nach dem Signaturgesetz und dem Askemos-Verfahren | author=RA Markus Heinker | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One proposal for using bitcoin for replicated asset registration and contract execution is called "colored coins".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24620-bitcoin-moves-beyond-mere-money.html | publisher=New Scientist | author= Hal Hodson| title=Bitcoin moves beyond mere money | date=20 November 2013 | accessdate=12 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Replicated titles for potentially arbitrary forms of property, along with replicated contract execution, are implemented in different projects.

{{asof|2015}}, [[UBS]] was experimenting with "smart bonds" that use the [[bitcoin]] [[Blockchain (database)|blockchain]]&lt;ref name="newsweek20150912"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ross|first=Rory |url=http://europe.newsweek.com/smart-money-blockchains-are-future-internet-329278 |title=Smart Money: Blockchains Are the Future of the Internet |work=[[Newsweek]] |date=2015-09-12 |accessdate=2016-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
in which payment streams could hypothetically be fully automated, creating a self-paying instrument.&lt;ref name="IFRasia20150611"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wigan|first=David |url=http://www.ifrasia.com/bitcoin-technology-will-disrupt-derivatives-says-banker/21202956.article |title=Bitcoin technology will disrupt derivatives, says banker |work=IFR Asia |date=2015-06-11 |accessdate=2016-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security issues==
A smart contract is "a computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a [[contract]]".&lt;ref name="tapscott2016"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin is Changing Money, Business, and the World|last1=Tapscott|first1=Don|last2=Tapscott|first2=Alex|date=May 2016|isbn=978-0670069972|pages=72, 83, 101, 127|authorlink=Don Tapscott}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2016-07-3 per copy of book in hand; do not have a URL link --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A blockchain-based smart contract is visible to all users of said blockchain. However, this leads to a situation where bugs, including security holes, are visible to all yet may not be quickly fixed.&lt;ref name=Peck20160528&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/networks/ethereums-150-million-dollar-dao-opens-for-business-just-as-researchers-call-for-a-moratorium|title=Ethereum’s $150-Million Blockchain-Powered Fund Opens Just as Researchers Call For a Halt|first=M.|last=Peck|date=28 May 2016|work=[[IEEE Spectrum]]|publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such an attack, difficult to fix quickly, was successfully executed on [[The DAO (organization)|The DAO]] in June 2016, draining {{USD|50 million}}&lt;!-- approximate US dollar value of the drained Ether --&gt; in [[Ether (value token)|Ether]] while developers attempted to come to a solution that would gain consensus.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iqdupont.com/assets/documents/DUPONT-2017-Preprint-Algorithmic-Governance.pdf|title=Experiments in Algorithmic Governance: A history and ethnography of "The DAO", a failed Decentralized Autonomous Organization|last=DuPont|first=Quinn|date=2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730133911/http://iqdupont.com/assets/documents/DUPONT%2D2017%2DPreprint%2DAlgorithmic%2DGovernance.pdf|archive-date=2017-07-30|dead-url=yes|accessdate=29 July 2017|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The DAO program had a time delay in place before the hacker could remove the funds; a hard fork of the Ethereum software was done to claw back the funds from the attacker before the time limit expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-25/this-is-your-company-on-blockchain|title=This Is Your Company on Blockchain|last=Coy|first=Peter|date=25 August 2016|work=|last2=Kharif|first2=Olga|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek|access-date=2016-12-05|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues in Ethereum smart contracts, in particular, include ambiguities and easy-but-insecure constructs in its contract language Solidity, compiler bugs, Ethereum Virtual Machine bugs, attacks on the blockchain network, the immutability of bugs and that there is no central source documenting known vulnerabilities, attacks and problematic constructs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Notable History ==
On August 17, 2007, TorrentFreak reported that [[Comcast]] had begun [[Bandwidth throttling|throttling]] its upload bandwidth, specifically against BitTorrent users. This made [[Glossary of BitTorrent terms#Seed|seeding]], which is an essential part of the BitTorrent protocol, effectively impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=132115 |title=Comcast Takes on TorrentFreak |first=Ryan |last=Lawler |date=2007-08-21 |accessdate=2010-06-14 |publisher=Light Reading}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later determined that Comcast was using [[Sandvine]] products, which implement network traffic shaping and policing, and include support for both blocking new and forcefully terminating established network connections. [[Comcast]] has denied these claims whenever they have been asked to comment. A guide, for customer service representatives when asked about Comcast's BitTorrent throttling, was leaked to [[The Consumerist]] on October 26, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://consumerist.com/consumer/leaks/comcasts-we-dont-throttle-bittorrent-internal-talking-points-memo-315791.php |title=Comcast's "We Don't Throttle BitTorrent" Internal Talking Points Memo |publisher=[[The Consumerist]] |date=2007-10-26 |accessdate=2010-06-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027093002/http://consumerist.com/consumer/leaks/comcasts-we-dont-throttle-bittorrent-internal-talking-points-memo-315791.php |archivedate=2007-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008 through to March 2011 TorrentFreak ran short lived video news service titled 'torrentfreak.tv directed by [[Andrej Preston]], founder of torrent site [[Suprnova]] made available for streaming and download on [[Mininova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ernesto|title=TorrentFreak TV Is Back!|url=http://torrentfreak.com/torrentfreak-tv-is-back/|accessdate=2 January 2015|date=March 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roettgers|first1=Janko|title=Suprnova.org: Former Pirate King Embraces Web Video|url=https://gigaom.com/2011/05/14/suprnova-torrent-site-web-video/|accessdate=2 January 2015|date=May 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 21, 2013, Comcast threatened TorrentFreak for writing about publicly available court documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Franceschi-Bicchierai|first1=Lorenzo|title=Comcast Threatens to Sue TorrentFreak for Copyright Infringement|url=http://mashable.com/2013/08/21/comcast-torrentfreak-copyright-infringement/|accessdate=2 January 2015|date=August 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comcast Threatens to Sue TorrentFreak for Copyright Infringement (updated)|url=https://torrentfreak.com/comcast-threatens-to-sue-torrentfreak-for-copyright-infringement-130821/ |publisher=TorrentFreak |date=2013-08-21 |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying document links a Comcast subscriber with the [[Prenda Law]] firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comcast Business Record Affidavit|url=https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/Georgia_Northern_District_Court/2--12-cv-00262/AF_Holdings_LLC_v._Patel/61/15/|publisher=Docket Alarm, Inc.|accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court case where the document was filed was a copyright infringement lawsuit brought by AF Holdings for alleged infringement of an adult movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Docket for AF Holdings, LLC v.

[[File:HK Support Gao 20100413.jpeg|thumb|305x305px|[[Hong Kong]] Lawyers held a conference in 2010 on China "weiquan" (human rights) lawyers supporting jailed Beijing lawyer [[Gao Zhisheng]]]]
'''Weiquan lawyers''' ({{zh|维权律师}}), or “rights protection” lawyers, refer to a small but influential movement of lawyers, legal practitioners, scholars and activists who help Chinese citizens to assert their constitutional, civil rights and/or public interest through litigation and legal activism. Weiquan lawyers represents many cases regarding labour rights, land rights, official corruption, victims of torture, migrants' rights.&lt;ref name="MarazziChen2012"/&gt;

Since the 1980s, as China’s leadership became cognizant of the importance of the legal system and legal profession to advance economic development, training for lawyers dramatically increased. From 1986 to 1992, the number of lawyers in the country more than doubled from 21,500 to 45,000,  and by 2008 had reached 143,000.&lt;ref name="peopledaily"/&gt;

The proportion of Weiquan lawyers is very small, relative the number of legal professionals in China. The number of lawyers actively focusing on civil rights issues has been estimated by legal scholar [[Teng Biao]] to number "only a few dozen."&lt;ref&gt;Teng Biao, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/24/AR2009072402940.html 'Chinese Human Rights Lawyers Under Assault'], Washington Post, 25 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The lawyers face considerable personal and professional obstacles, and Weiquan lawyering demands substantial commitment to their cause. According to [[Fu Hualing]] and [[Richard Cullen (attorney)|Richard Cullen]], “Weiquan lawyers act principally out of commitment, not because of any financial concerns. They accept weiquan cases to pursue their cause, and typically charge no legal fees.”&lt;ref name="ssrn"/&gt; The lawyers often face threats, harassment, and even detention when taking on cases, and they find themselves targets of repression ahead of sensitive events.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Kaiman, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/13/china-cracks-down-dissent-tiananmen-anniversary China cracks down on dissent ahead of Tiananmen anniversary], The Guardian, 13 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of Weiquan lawyers ==
Weiquan activists include law professors with university teaching positions—including He Weifang, [[Xu Zhiyong]], and Teng Biao—professional lawyers, and “[[barefoot lawyer]]s,” who are self-taught and often lack any formal legal education.  Several of China’s more high-profile Weiquan lawyers fall into the latter category, including [[Guo Feixiong]] and [[Chen Guangcheng]].  Many barefoot lawyers are peasants who teach themselves enough law to file civil complaints, engage in litigation, and educate fellow citizens about their rights.&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt;

Because corporate law firms are generally not hospitable to Weiquan lawyers and legal aid workers operate within the government system, Weiquan lawyers in large cities tend to work as solo practitioners in partnership firms with other like-minded lawyers.&lt;ref name="ssrn"/&gt; The [[Beijing Global Law Firm]] and [[Yitong Law Firm]] are examples of such organizations.

Rana Siu Inboden and William Inboden note that a disproportionate number of influential Weiquan lawyers identify with the [[Christianity in China|Christian]] faith, including [[Gao Zhisheng]], Chen Guangcheng, [[Zheng Enchong]], and [[Li Heping]], among others.&lt;ref name="purdue"/&gt;

== Different approaches ==
There are at least two distinctive (and sometimes competing) approaches to Weiquan activism. Among Weiquan lawyers, the pragmatists (or consequentialists) are more deferential to the existing legal systems and institutions, and only pursue courses of actions that are likely to produce incremental improvements and reforms. These activists may reject approaches that are liable to be met with official reprisals. By contrast, the "radical" Weiquan activists (those adopting a deontological approach) view rights defending as a moral obligation that is to be pursued regardless of potential consequences.&lt;ref name="fordham"/&gt; Radical lawyers such as Gao Zhisheng are more inclined to take on the most "sensitive" cases—such as those of [[Falun Gong]] adherents—simply because it is the "right thing to do," even though the prospects of success are minimal. A pragmatist may become radicalized once they encounter the limits of possible reform.&lt;ref name="fordham"/&gt;
